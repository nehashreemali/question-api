  "content": "Stannis Baratheon is the head of House Baratheon of Dragonstone and the Lord of Dragonstone. He is the secondborn son of Steffon Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End, and Lady Cassana Estermont.[14] He has an older brother, King Robert I Baratheon, and a younger brother, Lord Renly Baratheon. Stannis serves on Robert's small council as the master of ships.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Stannis is portrayed by Stephen Dillane.\n\nLike his brothers, King Robert and Lord Renly, Stannis is a large man—tall, broad-shouldered, and sinewy.[15] Jon Snow notes that Stannis towers over him.[16] Stannis has dark blue eyes and a heavy brow. His head has only a fringe of black hair \"like the shadow of a crown\", and his blue-black beard is cropped closely on his square jaw.[15] Stannis's face has a tightness to it like cured leather, and he has hollow cheeks, and thin, pale lips.[15] He often clenches his jaw,[17][18][19] and he grinds his teeth when he is angry.[15][9][20]\n\nStannis is a serious, stubborn, rarely-forgiving, hard man with a strong sense of duty and justice.[21][22][23][24][11][9][7] He is proud and protective of his honor.[25][9][26][27] In his adult life, Stannis is increasingly embittered by the lack of affection he receives from Robert, even though he serves the king as well as he can.[15][13]\n\nStannis is an accomplished commander, sailor, and warrior[22] with no thirst for battle, instead commanding from the rear.[28] He has never had the affection of nobles or smallfolk,[15][9][29][30] but he can command fierce loyalty from soldiers and knights.[31][19] Feasts at his court are quiet and dignified.[15]\n\nStannis is not a man for easy courtesies,[17] and he has always been uncomfortable around women, even his own wife, Lady Selyse of House Florent. During his years serving on the small council in King's Landing, he has left his wife on Dragonstone. Stannis rarely sleeps with Selyse and takes no joy in it, and they have one daughter, Shireen Baratheon.[15]\n\nInfluenced by Melisandre, a red priestess of R'hllor, the Lord of Light, Stannis adopts a new sigil which depicts the stag of House Baratheon enclosed within a red heart surrounded by orange flame.[17] Stannis dresses more plainly than many of his noble peers.[9][17] He sometimes wears a grey wool tunic, a dark red mantle, and a plain black leather belt from which hang his sword and dagger.[11] On campaign he wears a studded leather jerkin over quilted doublet, worn boots, breeches of brown roughspun, and a belt studded with garnets and yellow topaz.[17] Other armor includes wool and boiled leather[24] or grey plate inlaid with a flaming heart.[32]\n\nStannis's squires are Devan Seaworth and Bryen Farring,[9] and Ser Andrew Estermont served as his squire years ago.[5] Stannis is cordial but not friendly with Lord Jon Arryn, Robert's Hand of the King.[21] Stannis is also not a friend of Lord Eddard Stark, though he respects Ned's honor and honesty.[16]\n\nBorn in 264 AC,[12] Stannis is the second son of Lady Cassana Estermont and Steffon Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End and head of House Baratheon. He has an older brother, Robert, and a younger brother, Renly.[14][33]\n\nWhen Stannis was no more than four years old, his father took him and Robert to the Red Keep in King's Landing. Stannis believed he saw King Aerys II Targaryen on the Iron Throne, holding court. Stannis was impressed, and he and Robert agreed that the king had been as noble as the skulls of the Targaryen dragons were fearsome. It was years later that Steffon told him that it had been the Hand of the King, Lord Tywin Lannister, whom they had seen, as King Aerys had cut himself on the throne earlier that day and Tywin had taken over for him.[5]\n\nAs a lad, Stannis found an injured goshawk and nursed it back to health. He named the bird Proudwing, but his brother Robert called it Weakwing, as it would never fly higher than the treetops and never soared. In contrast, Robert owned a gyrfalcon named Thunderclap which never missed a strike. Eventually, Stannis's great-uncle, Ser Harbert, convinced him to abandon the bird, stating that Stannis was making a fool of himself with it.[9]\n\nGrowing up, Stannis always stood in the shadow of his older brother. Whatever Stannis did, Robert had done first and better.[15] These feelings remained until adulthood.[19] Cressen, the maester at Storm's End, came to care deeply for Stannis, moreso than for his brothers, as he felt Stannis was the one who needed him the most, as the most unloved of the three.[15] Even in his youth, Stannis had been an introverted child, who was mature beyond his years, solemn and joyless.[13]\n\nIn 278 AC, Stannis's parents were sent on a mission by King Aerys II to Volantis to find a bride for Rhaegar Targaryen, Stannis's cousin and the crown prince, but they were unsuccessful.[34] Maester Cressen remembers how Lord Steffon had written to him a fortnight before his return, stating that he had found a splendid fool in Volantis who would delight Robert and who might even teach Stannis how to laugh, in time.[15] Stannis and Robert were both present at Storm's End when Steffon and Cassana were expected to return from their voyage, looking on from the parapets of the castle. When the Windproud came in sight of Storm's End, the two brothers witnessed how the ship was smashed against the rocks in Shipbreaker Bay and swallowed by the sea, with Steffon and Cassana drowning.[15] According to Stannis, he lost his faith in the Seven that day.[9] The only survivor of the wreck was the fool, Patchface, who washed up on the shore on the third day.[15]\n\nWhen King Aerys II Targaryen demanded the heads of Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark after the executions of Lord Rickard and Brandon Stark, Lord Jon Arryn instead raised his banners in revolt. Eddard and Robert returned to their homes to call their own banners during Robert's Rebellion against House Targaryen. The resulting decision that Stannis faced—whether to be loyal to his older brother and liege, Robert, or to his king, Aerys—was a difficult one.[11] Stannis was at Storm's End when Robert returned from the battles at Summerhall with his prisoners, whom he kept at Storm's End, and eventually befriended. Stannis warned his brother that the men he had befriended were men who had wanted to deliver him to Aerys to be burned; while Stannis would have thrown them in a dungeon, Robert made them his allies.[30]\n\nStannis remained behind at Storm's End when Robert marched again. After Robert was defeated at Ashford, forces from the Reach besieged the seat of House Baratheon, surrounding Storm's End on land and blockading it by sea. Donal Noye smithed for Stannis and lost an arm during the siege of Storm's End.[35] Stannis successfully held Storm's End against the siege by Lords Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne,[21] which lasted a major part of the war. His garrison held under desperate conditions, only avoiding starvation by the timely intervention of Davos, a notorious smuggler, whose cargo of onions and salt fish allowed them to hold the fortress.[15]\n\nAfter the siege of Storm's End was lifted by Lord Eddard Stark, Stannis knighted Davos and, taking him into his service, allowed the new landed knight to choose the name Seaworth for his new House.[15] True to Stannis's sense of justice, he also punished Davos for his crimes as a smuggler by removing the first joint from each finger of Davos's left hand, as payment for his past crimes. Davos accepted the punishment on the condition that Stannis carry out the sentence himself, which Stannis did, using a cleaver for a cleaner cut.[15]\n\nFollowing the Sack of King's Landing and the surrender of the Tyrells at Storm's End, the new king, Robert I Baratheon, charged his brother Stannis with building a new royal fleet to seize the island of Dragonstone, the last stronghold in the possession of House Targaryen. A fierce storm destroyed the Targaryen fleet which had been protecting the island, while Dowager Queen Rhaella Targaryen died in labor at the castle of Dragonstone. Targaryen loyalists led by Ser Willem Darry smuggled the two Targaryen children, Viserys and Daenerys, from the island before Stannis's assault on Dragonstone. Robert blamed Stannis for letting the Targaryen heirs escape, although the two children had been spirited to safety in the Braavosian Coastland shortly before Stannis had set sail.[36][15][20]\n\nStannis was displeased to discover that King Robert had granted him Dragonstone, instead of the wealthier Storm's End, which was given to their younger brother Renly. Stannis resented this and believed it to be an intentional slight,[15] which Queen Cersei Lannister agrees with.[20] According to a semi-canon source, however, Robert had not necessarily meant it as such.[37] The castle had traditionally been the seat of the heir to the Iron Throne, the Prince of Dragonstone, during most of the Targaryen dynasty, so the then-childless Robert was granting it to his heir at that time, Stannis.[37] Now the Lord of Dragonstone, Stannis became the head of House Baratheon of Dragonstone. Stannis and Maester Cressen came to Dragonstone around 287 AC.[15]\n\nStannis wed Lady Selyse of House Florent. While Stannis and Selyse were dancing during the feast, King Robert deflowered Delena Florent, a cousin of Selyse, on the wedding bed. This coupling led to the birth of Edric Storm, the only officially acknowledged bastard of the king. Stannis insisted that the boy was a slight upon the honor of his wife's house and promptly shipped him off to his brother Renly at Storm's End.[38] Stannis only does his duty in the marriage bed once or twice a year, taking no joy in it.[15] Though he once hoped for sons, Stannis has only had a daughter, Shireen, with Selyse.[15]\n\nLord Stannis was appointed to the small council[21] of King Robert I Baratheon as the master of ships, and he left Selyse and Shireen on Dragonstone when he traveled to King's Landing.[15]. Stannis only occasionally writes to Selyse, and his visits are even fewer.[15]\n\nIn 289 AC, Stannis led the rebuilt royal fleet to the Sunset Sea to help suppress Greyjoy's Rebellion. Stannis lured Victarion Greyjoy, Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet, into a trap in the Straits of Fair Isle, and he destroyed much of the Iron Fleet in the ensuing sea battle off Fair Isle.[39][40] Afterwards, Stannis subdued Great Wyk in his brother's name.[41]\n\nStannis once led a fleet to Sisterton to suppress smuggling from the Three Sisters. He hanged a dozen friends of Lord Godric Borrell, and he threatened to hang Godric himself if any ships are wrecked if the Night Lamp were to go dark.[42]\n\nSer Axell Florent, Selyse's uncle, has served as the castellan of Dragonstone for ten years while Stannis has been away at King's Landing.[9]\n\nDespite his loyalty and service to his elder brother, Stannis has always felt underappreciated by King Robert. Instead of thanking Stannis for holding Storm's End against the Tyrells during Robert's Rebellion, the king thanked his old friend, Lord Eddard Stark, for lifting the siege. Instead of thanking Stannis for capturing Dragonstone for him, Robert blamed Stannis for the escape of Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen, even though they left Dragonstone before Stannis had set sail.[15]\n\nStannis has helped Lord Jon Arryn, Robert's Hand of the King, in ruling the Seven Kingdoms, but he has received little or no acknowledgment or thanks from his elder brother, who spends his time hunting, drinking, and whoring.[15] Stannis feels that Storm's End, the ancestral seat of House Baratheon, was his by rights after Robert took the Iron Throne, and has told Robert so on multiple occasions. In due time, Storm's End was given to young Renly instead.[20]\n\nKing Robert once rejected Stannis's proposal to outlaw brothels.[21] Stannis has outlawed prostitution on his island of Dragonstone.[9] Dragonstone's maester, the elderly Cressen, fell and broke his hip in 297 AC.[15]\n\nEventually, Stannis began to suspect that the children of Queen Cersei Lannister—Prince Joffrey, Princess Myrcella, and Prince Tommen Baratheon—were not actually Robert's. Lord Varys, the master of whisperers, suggests the idea had been mentioned to Stannis by an unnamed individual.[26] Convinced that Robert would not believe him, Stannis confided his suspicions with Lord Arryn, the King's Hand.[17]\n\nStannis and Jon investigated the matter, visiting several of Robert's baseborn children in the capital, including visits to the shop of Tobho Mott and to Chataya's brothel.[21][25][38] According to Gendry, Tobho's apprentice, Stannis and Jon often went riding together, with Renly excluded.[21][25] During their investigations, Jon agreed with Stannis that his young son and heir, Robert Arryn, would be fostered with Stannis on Dragonstone.[21] Jon had begun to gather proof when he suddenly died,[17] with Stannis believing that Cersei had Jon killed.[17][11]\n\nStannis expects to be named the new Hand of the King after the sudden death of Lord Jon Arryn,[15][17] but King Robert I Baratheon instead leaves for the north to offer the position to his old friend, Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.[43] A resentful Stannis leaves for Dragonstone[44][45][21] not long after with much of the royal fleet.[46]\n\nStannis plans his next move,[45] believing that Queen Cersei Lannister poisoned Jon.[15] Rather than have young Robert Arryn fostered with Stannis as planned, Jon's widow Lysa flees back to the Vale of Arryn with her son after Jon's death.[47] Since Maester Cressen has become ill after his fall the previous year, the Citadel sends Pylos to Dragonstone, with the young maester arriving mere days before Stannis closes off the isle.[15]\n\nEddard wonders why Stannis left King's Landing, believing it was due to the discovery of whatever secret Jon was allegedly murdered for, although not realizing that Stannis was also slighted by Robert's selection of Eddard as his new Hand. Ned Stark, via Grand Maester Pycelle, sends a raven with a polite letter requesting Lord Stannis to return to his seat on the small council.[48] Stannis does not attend the Hand's tourney in King's Landing.[25]\n\nDuring Eddard's investigation of Jon's death, he discovers that Stannis and Jon had spent a great deal of time together. When he is told Stannis and Jon visited a brothel, when Stannis is normally so righteous to the point of prudish, Eddard gets closer to the truth.[21] Stannis does not attend the Hand's tourney in King's Landing.[25]\n\nRobert is mortally wounded by a boar while hunting in the kingswood, and the dying king wants Eddard to rule as regent for his son, Joffrey Baratheon.[23] Since Joffrey is not actually Robert's son, Ned alters the phrasing of Robert's will without his knowledge and plans to bring Stannis to the Iron Throne instead of Joffrey. Lord Stark tasks Tomard with personally delivering a letter to Stannis on Dragonstone when the Wind Witch sails north.[23] Ned rejects Lord Renly Baratheon's recommendation to take Cersei's children into custody, and Lord Stark instead allies with Lord Petyr Baelish, who warns that raising Stannis to the throne will bring war.[23] Eddard is outmaneuvered by Robert's widow, Queen Cersei, and betrayed by Lord Baelish, and Fat Tom is slain by gold cloaks during the arrest of Eddard Stark in the throne room before he can depart the capital.[49] Cersei shows the letter which would have been brought to Stannis to Ned's captive daughter, Sansa Stark.[50]\n\nWar breaks out in the Seven Kingdoms after Robert's death.[51] During Joffrey's first court session, Stannis, his wife Selyse, and daughter Shireen are listed by Grand Maester Pycelle among those required to swear fealty to the new king.[52] Rather than allowing Eddard to join the Night's Watch after confessing to treason, Joffrey has Lord Stark publicly executed at the Great Sept of Baelor.[53] Eddard's eldest son, Robb Stark, is declared King in the North at Riverrun after the Battle of the Camps.[54]\n\nLord Varys reports that Robert's youngest brother, Renly, has been crowned at Highgarden, and that Stannis is said to be building ships, hiring sellswords, and bringing a shadowbinder from Asshai to Dragonstone. Lord Tywin Lannister, Joffrey's Hand, thinks that Stannis is a greater threat the boy king's other rivals.[55]\n\nStannis declares himself king on Dragonstone. He sends Ser Davos Seaworth to gather support for him among the stormlords, but none are willing to join him. His supporters from the narrow sea include Lords Ardrian Celtigar, Monford Velaryon, Duram Bar Emmon, and Guncer Sunglass.[4] Stannis hires sellswords from Myr and Lys,[15] and he also has the support of the sellsails Salladhor Saan, self-styled as the Prince of the Narrow Sea, and Morosh the Myrman.[4] The older maester at Dragonstone, Cressen, suggests to Stannis that he makes an alliance against the Lannisters with Robb Stark, who has been declared King in the North, but Stannis objects to ruling only half a kingdom. Cressen then proposes that Stannis sends Shireen, his only child and heir, to the Eyrie, to make an alliance with Lady Lysa Arryn. Stannis's wife, Selyse Florent, objects, stating that Stannis should not have to beg for help, and Stannis sides with her.[15]\n\nSelyse has converted to the faith of R'hllor, the Lord of Light, giving Melisandre, a red priestess, a base of power on Dragonstone. Selyse tells Stannis that the red comet is a sign that Stannis's time has come, and that he must sail from Dragonstone now to conquer.[15] Selyse claims that Renly Baratheon's men will join Stannis once Renly dies, and that Melisandre has seen Renly dead in her flames. Cressen is horrified by the thought of fratricide and objects, but Stannis dismisses him. Cressen attempts to poison Melisandre with the strangler, but he does and she survives unscathed.[15] Pylos henceforth serves as Stannis's sole maester at Dragonstone.[9]\n\nThough Stannis is not a follower of R'hllor,[15] he renounces the Faith of the Seven for the Lord of Light. Queen's men ruin the sept at Dragonstone, and statues of the Seven are publicly burned before Dragonstone's gates. During this sacrifice, Melisandre proclaims that Stannis is Azor Ahai reborn, and has him pull a sword, Lightbringer, out of the burning carving of the Mother.[9] In private, Sallador tells Davos that the sword is not the real Lightbringer. The pious Lord Sunglass renounces Stannis for having destroyed the sept, and he is imprisoned with the surviving sons of Ser Hubard Rambton, who fought the queen's men in defense of the sept.[9]\n\nStannis writes a letter announcing his claim to the Iron Throne and the bastardy of Joffrey, Myrecella and Tommen, which he plans to send to the lords of the Seven Kingdoms by raven, and to the ports of Westeros and the Free Cities by ship.[9] Davos tells Stannis that he has no proof of the incest between Queen Cersei Lannister and her brother, Ser Jaime Lannister, but Stannis claims that Robert's bastard son Edric Storm is proof, though he does not have access to boy at Storm's End. Davos further informs Stannis that it would be unwise to declare for the Lord of Light, if he wishes to win over the followers of the Seven, but Stannis rejects the notion, as he believes Melisandre has power.[9]\n\nHaving already declared for the throne, Renly Baratheon, Stannis's younger brother, slowly marches with a huge host on the roseroad from Highgarden toward King's Landing.[9][56] King Robb Stark sends his mother Catelyn south as an envoy. When Catelyn meets Renly at Bitterbridge, Renly tells her he will have Stannis's support against King Joffrey. Catelyn reminds Renly that Stannis has a stronger claim as the elder brother, but Renly scoffs at the idea of the unpopular Stannis becoming king. As Renly and Catelyn converse, Renly is surprised when a rider brings words that Stannis has besieged Storm's End, which is held for Renly by Ser Cortnay Penrose.[29]\n\nFrom Bitterbridge, Renly rushes to Storm's End with ten thousand[57] of his host to meet Stannis, claiming that he has another hundred thousand on their way.[17] Stannis and Renly parley, and Renly offers Stannis a chance to swear him his fealty, which Stannis angrily rejects. He calls Renly a traitor, as well as threatens Robb Stark to his mother, Lady Catelyn Stark. When it becomes clear that Renly, who does not care about Stannis's letter and is confident in his own strength, will not swear to him, Stannis leaves, promising a battle at dawn.[17]\n\nCatelyn informs Renly about the murder attempt on her son Bran's life, which she blames on the Lannisters. Catelyn now believes that Bran saw Cersei and Jaime having sex. She asks leave to go to Stannis to tell him of her suspicions, suggesting that Stannis, Renly, and Robb all cast aside their crowns to call a Great Council, but Renly refuses. As the would-be king prepares for battle, a shadow kills him; Stannis's shadow, according to Catelyn.[57] Most of the forces Renly had brought with him to Storm's End join Stannis, though Ser Loras Tyrell, and Lords Randyll Tarly and Mathis Rowan do not.[30]\n\nFollowing Renly's death, Stannis is troubled by terrible nightmares, and only Melisandre, who now shares his pavilion, can soothe him to sleep.[24] He confides in Davos that he sometimes dreams of Renly's death, but that he is innocent, as he had been in his bed when Renly was slain, and that his squire, Devan Seaworth, had been unable to wake him. Stannis is vexed by Renly having offered him a peach during their parley.[24]\n\nStannis has surrounded Storm's End by land and sea, and he promises that the garrison might go free unharmed is the castle is yielded up to him in a fortnight.[58] The castellan, Cortnay Penrose, continues to refuse, however, even during the last parley a fortnight later, as yielding requires giving the boy Edric to Stannis. Cortnay challenges Stannis to single combat to decide the matter, but Stannis refuses. Melisandre tells Stannis that she has seen Cortnay's death in her flames. Unwilling to leave Storm's End untaken out of fear that it will be viewed as a defeat, and determined to get a hold of Robert's bastard to prove the incest, Stannis orders Davos to land a small boat beneath the castle, unseen in the black of the night, without anyone else knowing about it, taking Melisandre with him.[24] Davos rows Melisandre beneath Storm's End, where she gives birth to a shadow which resembles Stannis and enters the castle.[24] That same night, Cortnay falls off a tower of the castle to his death,[59] and his lieutenant, Lord Elwood Meadows, yields the castle to Stannis,[60] who subsequently burns the godswood of Storm's End.[61] It is said that Cortnay threw himself off the tower, and his guards could not find anyone else in the room, nor had they seen anyone else enter. However, Lord Varys believes Cortnay to have been killed with magic.[59]\n\nWith Storm's End fallen, Stannis is free to march for King's Landing, which has been preparing for his arrival.[61] Stannis's bannermen convince him that Melisandre should not join him on the campaign, as a battlefield is no place for a woman and she might get credit for his victory as a sorceress. Stannis sends Melisandre and Edric to Dragonstone, and he begins marching north from Storm's End toward the kingswood and the southern shore of the Blackwater Rush. Meanwhile, Ser Imry Florent leads Stannis's fleet north along Massey's Hook toward Blackwater Bay.[62]\n\nTo prevent people in the city from joining Stannis, Tyrion Lannister, the acting Hand of the King, has the High Septon spread the news that Stannis means to burn to Great Sept of Baelor.[61] Tyrion has his Vale clansmen light fires to burn the grass which would be consumed by Stannis's horses, while killing his scouts and raiding his baggage train. In response, Stannis's vanguard sets the kingswood afire, to smoke the clansmen out.[63]\n\nStannis attacks King's Landing during the Battle of the Blackwater, with most of Stannis's ships entering the harbor to land soldiers and face the smaller fleet of King Joffrey. The Lannisters light wildfire and raise a giant iron chain to prevent ships from sailing out of the harbor, and most ships in both fleets are destroyed. Stannis's soldiers use the destroyed ships as a bridge to reach the gates of the city, however, and they come close to victory. The forces of Lords Tywin Lannister and Mace Tyrell arrive unexpectedly, led by the \"ghost\" of Renly Baratheon (who is later revealed to have been Ser Garlan Tyrell, dressed in Renly's armor),[64] and Stannis's soldiers are overwhelmed or surrender. Ser Richard Horpe and Ser Justin Massey convince Stannis to retreat.[65]\n\nWhile Stannis is away, Melisandre and Queen Selyse burn Lord Guncer Sunglass and Ser Hubard Rambton's sons.[9] Defeated on the Blackwater, Stannis returns to Dragonstone on the Lysene ships of Salladhor Saan[66] with the few men that remain to him, most of them queen's men from House Florent.[67] Stannis names Lord Alester Florent as his Hand of the King, but refuses to see anyone but Melisandre, brooding in the Stone Drum instead. He does not eat, and tales are told claiming that Stannis and Melisandre go down into the Dragonmont to watch the fires inside.[67]\n\nAfter Ser Davos Seaworth is arrested for his plan to kill Melisandre,[67] Melisandre visits him in the dungeon. The shadowbinder informs the Onion Knight that she dare not make another shadow with Stannis as his \"fires burn so low\" that doing so might kill him.[68] Lord Florent, losing faith in Stannis's chances for success, prepares to offer peace to Lord Tywin Lannister, now King Joffrey's Hand. In exchange for giving up his claim to the Iron Throne and retracting all he said regarding the bastardy of Cersei Lannister's children, Stannis would be accepted back into the king's peace and allowed to rule as Lord of Dragonstone and Lord of Storm's End. Alester wishes to seal the bargain by offering Princess Shireen Baratheon in marriage to Prince Tommen Baratheon. However, before Alester can give the letter to Sallador and have it secretly delivered to King's Landing, Lord Florent is arrested for treason and imprisoned with Davos in the dungeon.[68]\n\nMelisandre asks Stannis to relinquish Edric Storm, the bastard son of the late King Robert I Baratheon, over to her, claiming that king's blood will allow her to wake a stone dragon. Stannis refuses, however.[68][11] The priestess believes that Stannis is the prince that was promised.[11]\n\nStannis has Davos released from the dungeon and brought before him. While escorting Davos to Stannis in the Chamber of the Painted Table, Ser Axell Florent tries to make Davos tell Stannis that Axell should be named the King's Hand to succeed his elder brother, Lord Alester. When Davos sees Stannis, the king appears ten years older, shrunken and beginning to be grey-haired. Stannis agrees with Davos that Axell's plan to attack Claw Isle should be rejected, and he names Davos as Lord of the Rainwood, Admiral of the Narrow Sea, and his new Hand of the King. Stannis reveals that he has seen a high hill in a forest, where men in black had made a ring of torches, and where shapes were moving through the snow. Melisandre again asks for Edric, but Stannis refuses, ordering her to use leeches which had been feeding on the boy instead. Stannis throws three leeches into a fire one by one, stating the names of the other three surviving kings (Joffrey Baratheon, Balon Greyjoy, and Robb Stark) of the War of the Five Kings.[11]\n\nBalon falls to his death at Pyke[69] and Robb is killed in the Red Wedding,[70] leading to a discussion among Stannis's counselors whether Edric should be sacrificed to wake a dragon from stone, as Melisandre claims will happen. Davos attempts to convince Stannis not to sacrifice Edric once they are alone, but Stannis admits that, should Joffrey die as well, he is willing to consider doing it.[5]\n\nUpon hearing the news of Joffrey's death at his royal wedding, Stannis is willing to sacrifice Edric, though he still does not like the idea.[18] Several knights and lordlings have greater loyalty to Stannis and the Faith than to Melisandre and R'hllor.[5] These king's men are willing to help Davos smuggle Edric to safety from Dragonstone under the care of Ser Andrew Estermont.[18] Stannis is furious, but Davos urges Stannis to sail for the Wall, claiming that \"a king protects his people, or he is no king at all\", and the Onion Lord presents his king with Maester Aemon's letter asking for aid for the Night's Watch, of which Stannis had been unaware.[18]\n\nMelisandre sacrifices Lord Florent to R'hllor to gain favorable winds for the journey north,[42] and Stannis sails on Sallador's ships from Dragonstone to the Wall. He leaves Selyse and Shireen at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea while marching west with all his forces.[71] Guided by Cotter Pyke and his men from Eastwatch,[71] Stannis's army arrives in time to defeat the wildling host gathered by Mance Rayder, King-Beyond-the-Wall, during the battle beneath the Wall.[72]\n\nStannis occupies the King's Tower at Castle Black.[71] Though he plans to burn Mance, once a deserter from the Night's Watch, for treason, he is willing to allow the other free folk through the Wall if they swear to R'hllor, settling them in the Gift. He has Jon Snow, the bastard son of the late Lord Eddard Stark and the half brother of Robb Stark, brought to him, and the king offers to legitimize the youth and name him Lord of Winterfell in exchange for Jon's help in winning the north to his side. Stannis allows Jon time to think about the offer, which Jon is reluctant to accept because it would require the burning of the godswood of Winterfell.[16]\n\nAs Stannis needs to negotiate with the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, he is displeased that after ten days of voting, the black brothers still have not yet chosen a new commander to succeed the late Jeor Mormont, and calls several of the higher ranking men to him to inform them that he will choose a Lord Commander for them, if they do not come to a decision that same day.[10] Stannis informs Maester Aemon and Samwell Tarly that he has sent word to his castellan, Ser Rolland Storm, to begin mining dragonglass at Dragonstone to fight the Others, and he confirms that he is aware of Aemon's Targaryen ancestry. Aemon requests to see Lightbringer, and Stannis grants the request.[10] Thanks to Samwell's involvement,[10] Jon Snow is elected as Lord Commander,[73] preventing him from accepting Stannis's offer.\n\nAccording to Princess Arianne Martell, Stannis has been attainted by the Crown.[74]\n\nStannis, the self-styled King of Westeros,[75] remains at the King's Tower of Castle Black. He plans to use Val, whom his men call the \"wildling princess\", to seal the peace between the northmen and the free folk.[76] Lord Commander Jon Snow has given Stannis food, shelter, the Nightfort, and leave to settle some free folk in the Gift. Stannis sends ravens to the northern lords, demanding their fealty, but only House Karstark replies, swearing Stannis their allegiance.[76]\n\nBefore blaming her brother Tyrion for the murder of her father, Lord Tywin, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister suspects Stannis's involvement. She recalls that she would have eventually dealt with Stannis and Renly, but Lord Eddard Stark's investigations had forced her to kill  Robert first.[77] Cersei is giddy as a maiden when she learns that Stannis has left Dragonstone, and she believes that Stannis has finally admitted defeat and gone into exile.[78]\n\nWhen news reaches King's Landing that Stannis is now in the north, Cersei is furious.[78] She sends two thousand Lannister soldiers to Dragonstone to defeat the small garrison Stannis had left behind and take the castle.[78] Meanwhile, Lord Roose Bolton, the new Warden of the North, and two thousand soldiers from House Frey are to deal with Stannis and his few thousand soldiers in the north.[78] Cersei wishes to deal with the Greyjoys only after Stannis has been defeated.[79] News reaches King's Landing that the Golden Company has broken its contract with Myr, and it is being said that they have been hired by Stannis instead.[79] The small council receives reports that Stannis's Hand of the King, Lord Davos Seaworth, has traveled to White Harbor and that he had been arrested by Lord Wyman Manderly. Cersei orders him to execute Davos.[79]\n\nIn Braavos, Maester Aemon becomes convinced that Melisandre has misread the signs that had convinced her that Stannis is Azor Ahai reborn.[80]\n\nStannis keeps his wildling prisoners beyond the Wall. He rides down the kingsroad almost as far as Queenscrown, prowls through the empty hovels of Mole's Town, inspects the ruins at Queensgate and Oakenshield, and walks atop the Wall each night with Melisandre, while selecting prisoners for questioning during the day.[3] House Mormont has refused to join Stannis, whereas House Manderly's reply to Stannis's letter only made excuses. Jon Snow, the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, refuses to give Stannis ownership of the sixteen castles at the Wall that are unoccupied by the black brothers, and he asks Stannis for men instead to serve under the command of his own commanders.[3]\n\nStannis sends Lord Davos Seaworth to White Harbor to treat with Lord Wyman Manderly on his behalf,[81][82] as well sends Ser Richard Horpe and Ser Justin Massey as envoys south.[81] Stannis approves of Jon's execution of Janos Slynt,[81] and he has Mance Rayder burned in sacrifice to R'hllor as punishment for having deserted the Night's Watch.[32] In reality, however, Stannis has unknowingly burned Rattleshirt, whom Melisandre had used a glamor upon to look like Mance.[27] Stannis offers the remaining free folk the choice between bending the knee or returning beyond the Wall to die. Most of the free folk bend the knee and are allowed south of the Wall.[32]\n\nStannis wins the support of half of the forces of House Umber, commanded by Mors Umber. The remainder of the Umber forces have marched for House Bolton, under the command of Hother Umber, as the Greatjon remains a captive of House Frey at the Twins after the Red Wedding.[83] Stannis plans to march with the wildlings on the Dreadfort, as Ramsay Bolton has marched south to recover Moat Cailin from ironborn. Jon warns that the Dreadfort will learn of Stannis's approach long before he can ever reach the castle, and Moat Cailin will fall quickly, which means that Ramsay and his father, Lord Roose Bolton, are free to march against Stannis with their entire force. Additionally, marching with wildlings will only serve to turn the northmen against Stannis. Instead, Jon proposes that Stannis visit the mountain clans, including the Flints, Wulls, Norreys and Liddles. Instead of the Dreadfort, Jon suggests marching against Deepwood Motte to fight the ironborn of Asha Greyjoy. In exchange, the wildlings remain at the Wall.[83]\n\nAt White Harbor, Lord Wyman Manderly arrests Stannis's envoy and Hand, Davos Seaworth, and fakes his execution. In secret, he promises to swear loyalty to Stannis if Davos can bring him Rickon Stark.[84]\n\nStannis follows the advice of Lord Commander Snow and marches west to the northern mountains, although one of his squires, Davos's son Devan, remains at Castle Black with Melisandre. The red priestess later thinks that her bed has seen little use since Stannis's departure.[27][27] The king wins over several of the mountain clans, gathering an additional three thousand men for his army. Stannis then recovers Deepwood Motte from the ironborn,[41] returning the castle to House Glover.[84] Stannis is joined by the Mormonts, as well as by smallfolk fleeing from the ironborn and survivors from the battle outside the gates of Winterfell, men once sworn to the Hornwoods, Cerwyns, and Tallharts.[2] Asha and several ironborn are taken captive.[41]\n\nStannis and his army march on Winterfell, taking Asha with them, but they are slowed by heavy snows in the wolfswood, and Stannis is forced to encamp at a small crofters' village three days west of Winterfell.[85][86][19] Arnolf Karstark and Mors Umber have begun to march as well, and plan to join Stannis near Winterfell.[2][85] Arnolf eventually finds Stannis at the crofters' village.[87] Many of Stannis's men succumb to the blizzard, including his remaining squire, Bryen Farring. When four Peasebury men are condemned for cannibalism, Stannis allows them to be burned by Ser Godry Farring, with the queen's men believing them to be sacrifices to ward off the blizzard.[87]\n\nTycho Nestoris, an emissary from the Iron Bank of Braavos, arrives at the Wall. As Queen Regent Cersei Lannister has ceased the Iron Throne's payments of loans, the Iron Bank wishes to broach the subject to Stannis. Jon Snow receives the banker and realizes that if Stannis gives in to the demands of the Iron Bank, the Braavosi will give him their support, which might win him the Iron Throne.[88] Alys Karstark arrives at Castle Black and warns Jon that her uncle, Arnolf, is only feigning loyalty to Stannis. In truth he sides with House Bolton, and is planning to betray Stannis at the opportune moment. Jon sends a message to Deepwood in an attempt to warn Stannis.[88] Tycho travels to Deepwood in search of Stannis, and from there continues to the crofters' village as well. Near Winterfell, Tycho finds Mors Umber with a captive Theon Greyjoy and \"Arya Stark\" (actually Jeyne Poole), whom he brings with him to Stannis.[87]\n\nJon Snow receives a taunting letter at Castle Black from Ramsay, stating that Stannis was killed along with most of his army in seven days of battle.[89]\n\nAt the crofters' village, Stannis prepares for the looming battle against the Boltons. He signs a contract with Tycho Nestoris and plans to send the banker back to the Wall for safety. Tycho brought a message from Jon Snow informing Stannis of Arnolf Karstark's planned treachery, so Stannis has Arnolf, his son Arthor, and his three grandsons arrested and plans to execute them. The king sends Ser Justin Massey to escort \"Arya Stark\" back to Castle Black to reunite her with Jon, in gratitude for the Lord Commander's counsel of gathering the northern mountain clans. Justin is to then travel to Braavos and use money from the Iron Bank to hire twenty thousand sellswords for Stannis. Stannis tells Justin that he may hear of Stannis's death in Braavos, but even if that news is true, the knight is to follow the orders as to seat his daughter, Princess Shireen Baratheon, on the Iron Throne. Stannis next receives Asha Greyjoy, and informs her that her brother Theon must be executed, as showing him mercy would mean losing all of the northmen. Asha suggests that Stannis behead Theon with Lightbringer before a weirwood at a nearby isle.[65]\n\nAccording to George R. R. Martin, Stannis is partially inspired by Tiberius Caesar, particularly the portrayal by George Baker in I, Claudius.[93][94]\n\nIn an early draft of A Game of Thrones, Stannis was Lord of Storm's End while Renly was Lord of Dragonstone.[95]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nLike his brothers, King Robert and Lord Renly, Stannis is a large man—tall, broad-shouldered, and sinewy.[15] Jon Snow notes that Stannis towers over him.[16] Stannis has dark blue eyes and a heavy brow. His head has only a fringe of black hair \"like the shadow of a crown\", and his blue-black beard is cropped closely on his square jaw.[15] Stannis's face has a tightness to it like cured leather, and he has hollow cheeks, and thin, pale lips.[15] He often clenches his jaw,[17][18][19] and he grinds his teeth when he is angry.[15][9][20]\n\nStannis is a serious, stubborn, rarely-forgiving, hard man with a strong sense of duty and justice.[21][22][23][24][11][9][7] He is proud and protective of his honor.[25][9][26][27] In his adult life, Stannis is increasingly embittered by the lack of affection he receives from Robert, even though he serves the king as well as he can.[15][13]\n\nStannis is an accomplished commander, sailor, and warrior[22] with no thirst for battle, instead commanding from the rear.[28] He has never had the affection of nobles or smallfolk,[15][9][29][30] but he can command fierce loyalty from soldiers and knights.[31][19] Feasts at his court are quiet and dignified.[15]\n\nStannis is not a man for easy courtesies,[17] and he has always been uncomfortable around women, even his own wife, Lady Selyse of House Florent. During his years serving on the small council in King's Landing, he has left his wife on Dragonstone. Stannis rarely sleeps with Selyse and takes no joy in it, and they have one daughter, Shireen Baratheon.[15]\n\nInfluenced by Melisandre, a red priestess of R'hllor, the Lord of Light, Stannis adopts a new sigil which depicts the stag of House Baratheon enclosed within a red heart surrounded by orange flame.[17] Stannis dresses more plainly than many of his noble peers.[9][17] He sometimes wears a grey wool tunic, a dark red mantle, and a plain black leather belt from which hang his sword and dagger.[11] On campaign he wears a studded leather jerkin over quilted doublet, worn boots, breeches of brown roughspun, and a belt studded with garnets and yellow topaz.[17] Other armor includes wool and boiled leather[24] or grey plate inlaid with a flaming heart.[32]\n\nStannis's squires are Devan Seaworth and Bryen Farring,[9] and Ser Andrew Estermont served as his squire years ago.[5] Stannis is cordial but not friendly with Lord Jon Arryn, Robert's Hand of the King.[21] Stannis is also not a friend of Lord Eddard Stark, though he respects Ned's honor and honesty.[16]\n\n\n## History\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n\nBorn in 264 AC,[12] Stannis is the second son of Lady Cassana Estermont and Steffon Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End and head of House Baratheon. He has an older brother, Robert, and a younger brother, Renly.[14][33]\n\nWhen Stannis was no more than four years old, his father took him and Robert to the Red Keep in King's Landing. Stannis believed he saw King Aerys II Targaryen on the Iron Throne, holding court. Stannis was impressed, and he and Robert agreed that the king had been as noble as the skulls of the Targaryen dragons were fearsome. It was years later that Steffon told him that it had been the Hand of the King, Lord Tywin Lannister, whom they had seen, as King Aerys had cut himself on the throne earlier that day and Tywin had taken over for him.[5]\n\nAs a lad, Stannis found an injured goshawk and nursed it back to health. He named the bird Proudwing, but his brother Robert called it Weakwing, as it would never fly higher than the treetops and never soared. In contrast, Robert owned a gyrfalcon named Thunderclap which never missed a strike. Eventually, Stannis's great-uncle, Ser Harbert, convinced him to abandon the bird, stating that Stannis was making a fool of himself with it.[9]\n\nGrowing up, Stannis always stood in the shadow of his older brother. Whatever Stannis did, Robert had done first and better.[15] These feelings remained until adulthood.[19] Cressen, the maester at Storm's End, came to care deeply for Stannis, moreso than for his brothers, as he felt Stannis was the one who needed him the most, as the most unloved of the three.[15] Even in his youth, Stannis had been an introverted child, who was mature beyond his years, solemn and joyless.[13]\n\nIn 278 AC, Stannis's parents were sent on a mission by King Aerys II to Volantis to find a bride for Rhaegar Targaryen, Stannis's cousin and the crown prince, but they were unsuccessful.[34] Maester Cressen remembers how Lord Steffon had written to him a fortnight before his return, stating that he had found a splendid fool in Volantis who would delight Robert and who might even teach Stannis how to laugh, in time.[15] Stannis and Robert were both present at Storm's End when Steffon and Cassana were expected to return from their voyage, looking on from the parapets of the castle. When the Windproud came in sight of Storm's End, the two brothers witnessed how the ship was smashed against the rocks in Shipbreaker Bay and swallowed by the sea, with Steffon and Cassana drowning.[15] According to Stannis, he lost his faith in the Seven that day.[9] The only survivor of the wreck was the fool, Patchface, who washed up on the shore on the third day.[15]\n\n\n## Robert's Rebellion\n\n\nWhen King Aerys II Targaryen demanded the heads of Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark after the executions of Lord Rickard and Brandon Stark, Lord Jon Arryn instead raised his banners in revolt. Eddard and Robert returned to their homes to call their own banners during Robert's Rebellion against House Targaryen. The resulting decision that Stannis faced—whether to be loyal to his older brother and liege, Robert, or to his king, Aerys—was a difficult one.[11] Stannis was at Storm's End when Robert returned from the battles at Summerhall with his prisoners, whom he kept at Storm's End, and eventually befriended. Stannis warned his brother that the men he had befriended were men who had wanted to deliver him to Aerys to be burned; while Stannis would have thrown them in a dungeon, Robert made them his allies.[30]\n\nStannis remained behind at Storm's End when Robert marched again. After Robert was defeated at Ashford, forces from the Reach besieged the seat of House Baratheon, surrounding Storm's End on land and blockading it by sea. Donal Noye smithed for Stannis and lost an arm during the siege of Storm's End.[35] Stannis successfully held Storm's End against the siege by Lords Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne,[21] which lasted a major part of the war. His garrison held under desperate conditions, only avoiding starvation by the timely intervention of Davos, a notorious smuggler, whose cargo of onions and salt fish allowed them to hold the fortress.[15]\n\nAfter the siege of Storm's End was lifted by Lord Eddard Stark, Stannis knighted Davos and, taking him into his service, allowed the new landed knight to choose the name Seaworth for his new House.[15] True to Stannis's sense of justice, he also punished Davos for his crimes as a smuggler by removing the first joint from each finger of Davos's left hand, as payment for his past crimes. Davos accepted the punishment on the condition that Stannis carry out the sentence himself, which Stannis did, using a cleaver for a cleaner cut.[15]\n\n\n## Lord of Dragonstone\n\n\nFollowing the Sack of King's Landing and the surrender of the Tyrells at Storm's End, the new king, Robert I Baratheon, charged his brother Stannis with building a new royal fleet to seize the island of Dragonstone, the last stronghold in the possession of House Targaryen. A fierce storm destroyed the Targaryen fleet which had been protecting the island, while Dowager Queen Rhaella Targaryen died in labor at the castle of Dragonstone. Targaryen loyalists led by Ser Willem Darry smuggled the two Targaryen children, Viserys and Daenerys, from the island before Stannis's assault on Dragonstone. Robert blamed Stannis for letting the Targaryen heirs escape, although the two children had been spirited to safety in the Braavosian Coastland shortly before Stannis had set sail.[36][15][20]\n\nStannis was displeased to discover that King Robert had granted him Dragonstone, instead of the wealthier Storm's End, which was given to their younger brother Renly. Stannis resented this and believed it to be an intentional slight,[15] which Queen Cersei Lannister agrees with.[20] According to a semi-canon source, however, Robert had not necessarily meant it as such.[37] The castle had traditionally been the seat of the heir to the Iron Throne, the Prince of Dragonstone, during most of the Targaryen dynasty, so the then-childless Robert was granting it to his heir at that time, Stannis.[37] Now the Lord of Dragonstone, Stannis became the head of House Baratheon of Dragonstone. Stannis and Maester Cressen came to Dragonstone around 287 AC.[15]\n\nStannis wed Lady Selyse of House Florent. While Stannis and Selyse were dancing during the feast, King Robert deflowered Delena Florent, a cousin of Selyse, on the wedding bed. This coupling led to the birth of Edric Storm, the only officially acknowledged bastard of the king. Stannis insisted that the boy was a slight upon the honor of his wife's house and promptly shipped him off to his brother Renly at Storm's End.[38] Stannis only does his duty in the marriage bed once or twice a year, taking no joy in it.[15] Though he once hoped for sons, Stannis has only had a daughter, Shireen, with Selyse.[15]\n\n\n## Master of Ships\n\n\nLord Stannis was appointed to the small council[21] of King Robert I Baratheon as the master of ships, and he left Selyse and Shireen on Dragonstone when he traveled to King's Landing.[15]. Stannis only occasionally writes to Selyse, and his visits are even fewer.[15]\n\nIn 289 AC, Stannis led the rebuilt royal fleet to the Sunset Sea to help suppress Greyjoy's Rebellion. Stannis lured Victarion Greyjoy, Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet, into a trap in the Straits of Fair Isle, and he destroyed much of the Iron Fleet in the ensuing sea battle off Fair Isle.[39][40] Afterwards, Stannis subdued Great Wyk in his brother's name.[41]\n\nStannis once led a fleet to Sisterton to suppress smuggling from the Three Sisters. He hanged a dozen friends of Lord Godric Borrell, and he threatened to hang Godric himself if any ships are wrecked if the Night Lamp were to go dark.[42]\n\nSer Axell Florent, Selyse's uncle, has served as the castellan of Dragonstone for ten years while Stannis has been away at King's Landing.[9]\n\n\n## Recent History\n\n\nDespite his loyalty and service to his elder brother, Stannis has always felt underappreciated by King Robert. Instead of thanking Stannis for holding Storm's End against the Tyrells during Robert's Rebellion, the king thanked his old friend, Lord Eddard Stark, for lifting the siege. Instead of thanking Stannis for capturing Dragonstone for him, Robert blamed Stannis for the escape of Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen, even though they left Dragonstone before Stannis had set sail.[15]\n\nStannis has helped Lord Jon Arryn, Robert's Hand of the King, in ruling the Seven Kingdoms, but he has received little or no acknowledgment or thanks from his elder brother, who spends his time hunting, drinking, and whoring.[15] Stannis feels that Storm's End, the ancestral seat of House Baratheon, was his by rights after Robert took the Iron Throne, and has told Robert so on multiple occasions. In due time, Storm's End was given to young Renly instead.[20]\n\nKing Robert once rejected Stannis's proposal to outlaw brothels.[21] Stannis has outlawed prostitution on his island of Dragonstone.[9] Dragonstone's maester, the elderly Cressen, fell and broke his hip in 297 AC.[15]\n\nEventually, Stannis began to suspect that the children of Queen Cersei Lannister—Prince Joffrey, Princess Myrcella, and Prince Tommen Baratheon—were not actually Robert's. Lord Varys, the master of whisperers, suggests the idea had been mentioned to Stannis by an unnamed individual.[26] Convinced that Robert would not believe him, Stannis confided his suspicions with Lord Arryn, the King's Hand.[17]\n\nStannis and Jon investigated the matter, visiting several of Robert's baseborn children in the capital, including visits to the shop of Tobho Mott and to Chataya's brothel.[21][25][38] According to Gendry, Tobho's apprentice, Stannis and Jon often went riding together, with Renly excluded.[21][25] During their investigations, Jon agreed with Stannis that his young son and heir, Robert Arryn, would be fostered with Stannis on Dragonstone.[21] Jon had begun to gather proof when he suddenly died,[17] with Stannis believing that Cersei had Jon killed.[17][11]\n\n\n## Recent Events\n\n\n\n## A Game of Thrones\n\n\nStannis expects to be named the new Hand of the King after the sudden death of Lord Jon Arryn,[15][17] but King Robert I Baratheon instead leaves for the north to offer the position to his old friend, Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.[43] A resentful Stannis leaves for Dragonstone[44][45][21] not long after with much of the royal fleet.[46]\n\nStannis plans his next move,[45] believing that Queen Cersei Lannister poisoned Jon.[15] Rather than have young Robert Arryn fostered with Stannis as planned, Jon's widow Lysa flees back to the Vale of Arryn with her son after Jon's death.[47] Since Maester Cressen has become ill after his fall the previous year, the Citadel sends Pylos to Dragonstone, with the young maester arriving mere days before Stannis closes off the isle.[15]\n\nEddard wonders why Stannis left King's Landing, believing it was due to the discovery of whatever secret Jon was allegedly murdered for, although not realizing that Stannis was also slighted by Robert's selection of Eddard as his new Hand. Ned Stark, via Grand Maester Pycelle, sends a raven with a polite letter requesting Lord Stannis to return to his seat on the small council.[48] Stannis does not attend the Hand's tourney in King's Landing.[25]\n\nDuring Eddard's investigation of Jon's death, he discovers that Stannis and Jon had spent a great deal of time together. When he is told Stannis and Jon visited a brothel, when Stannis is normally so righteous to the point of prudish, Eddard gets closer to the truth.[21] Stannis does not attend the Hand's tourney in King's Landing.[25]\n\nRobert is mortally wounded by a boar while hunting in the kingswood, and the dying king wants Eddard to rule as regent for his son, Joffrey Baratheon.[23] Since Joffrey is not actually Robert's son, Ned alters the phrasing of Robert's will without his knowledge and plans to bring Stannis to the Iron Throne instead of Joffrey. Lord Stark tasks Tomard with personally delivering a letter to Stannis on Dragonstone when the Wind Witch sails north.[23] Ned rejects Lord Renly Baratheon's recommendation to take Cersei's children into custody, and Lord Stark instead allies with Lord Petyr Baelish, who warns that raising Stannis to the throne will bring war.[23] Eddard is outmaneuvered by Robert's widow, Queen Cersei, and betrayed by Lord Baelish, and Fat Tom is slain by gold cloaks during the arrest of Eddard Stark in the throne room before he can depart the capital.[49] Cersei shows the letter which would have been brought to Stannis to Ned's captive daughter, Sansa Stark.[50]\n\nWar breaks out in the Seven Kingdoms after Robert's death.[51] During Joffrey's first court session, Stannis, his wife Selyse, and daughter Shireen are listed by Grand Maester Pycelle among those required to swear fealty to the new king.[52] Rather than allowing Eddard to join the Night's Watch after confessing to treason, Joffrey has Lord Stark publicly executed at the Great Sept of Baelor.[53] Eddard's eldest son, Robb Stark, is declared King in the North at Riverrun after the Battle of the Camps.[54]\n\nLord Varys reports that Robert's youngest brother, Renly, has been crowned at Highgarden, and that Stannis is said to be building ships, hiring sellswords, and bringing a shadowbinder from Asshai to Dragonstone. Lord Tywin Lannister, Joffrey's Hand, thinks that Stannis is a greater threat the boy king's other rivals.[55]\n\n\n## A Clash of Kings\n\n\nStannis declares himself king on Dragonstone. He sends Ser Davos Seaworth to gather support for him among the stormlords, but none are willing to join him. His supporters from the narrow sea include Lords Ardrian Celtigar, Monford Velaryon, Duram Bar Emmon, and Guncer Sunglass.[4] Stannis hires sellswords from Myr and Lys,[15] and he also has the support of the sellsails Salladhor Saan, self-styled as the Prince of the Narrow Sea, and Morosh the Myrman.[4] The older maester at Dragonstone, Cressen, suggests to Stannis that he makes an alliance against the Lannisters with Robb Stark, who has been declared King in the North, but Stannis objects to ruling only half a kingdom. Cressen then proposes that Stannis sends Shireen, his only child and heir, to the Eyrie, to make an alliance with Lady Lysa Arryn. Stannis's wife, Selyse Florent, objects, stating that Stannis should not have to beg for help, and Stannis sides with her.[15]\n\nSelyse has converted to the faith of R'hllor, the Lord of Light, giving Melisandre, a red priestess, a base of power on Dragonstone. Selyse tells Stannis that the red comet is a sign that Stannis's time has come, and that he must sail from Dragonstone now to conquer.[15] Selyse claims that Renly Baratheon's men will join Stannis once Renly dies, and that Melisandre has seen Renly dead in her flames. Cressen is horrified by the thought of fratricide and objects, but Stannis dismisses him. Cressen attempts to poison Melisandre with the strangler, but he does and she survives unscathed.[15] Pylos henceforth serves as Stannis's sole maester at Dragonstone.[9]\n\nThough Stannis is not a follower of R'hllor,[15] he renounces the Faith of the Seven for the Lord of Light. Queen's men ruin the sept at Dragonstone, and statues of the Seven are publicly burned before Dragonstone's gates. During this sacrifice, Melisandre proclaims that Stannis is Azor Ahai reborn, and has him pull a sword, Lightbringer, out of the burning carving of the Mother.[9] In private, Sallador tells Davos that the sword is not the real Lightbringer. The pious Lord Sunglass renounces Stannis for having destroyed the sept, and he is imprisoned with the surviving sons of Ser Hubard Rambton, who fought the queen's men in defense of the sept.[9]\n\nStannis writes a letter announcing his claim to the Iron Throne and the bastardy of Joffrey, Myrecella and Tommen, which he plans to send to the lords of the Seven Kingdoms by raven, and to the ports of Westeros and the Free Cities by ship.[9] Davos tells Stannis that he has no proof of the incest between Queen Cersei Lannister and her brother, Ser Jaime Lannister, but Stannis claims that Robert's bastard son Edric Storm is proof, though he does not have access to boy at Storm's End. Davos further informs Stannis that it would be unwise to declare for the Lord of Light, if he wishes to win over the followers of the Seven, but Stannis rejects the notion, as he believes Melisandre has power.[9]\n\nHaving already declared for the throne, Renly Baratheon, Stannis's younger brother, slowly marches with a huge host on the roseroad from Highgarden toward King's Landing.[9][56] King Robb Stark sends his mother Catelyn south as an envoy. When Catelyn meets Renly at Bitterbridge, Renly tells her he will have Stannis's support against King Joffrey. Catelyn reminds Renly that Stannis has a stronger claim as the elder brother, but Renly scoffs at the idea of the unpopular Stannis becoming king. As Renly and Catelyn converse, Renly is surprised when a rider brings words that Stannis has besieged Storm's End, which is held for Renly by Ser Cortnay Penrose.[29]\n\nFrom Bitterbridge, Renly rushes to Storm's End with ten thousand[57] of his host to meet Stannis, claiming that he has another hundred thousand on their way.[17] Stannis and Renly parley, and Renly offers Stannis a chance to swear him his fealty, which Stannis angrily rejects. He calls Renly a traitor, as well as threatens Robb Stark to his mother, Lady Catelyn Stark. When it becomes clear that Renly, who does not care about Stannis's letter and is confident in his own strength, will not swear to him, Stannis leaves, promising a battle at dawn.[17]\n\nCatelyn informs Renly about the murder attempt on her son Bran's life, which she blames on the Lannisters. Catelyn now believes that Bran saw Cersei and Jaime having sex. She asks leave to go to Stannis to tell him of her suspicions, suggesting that Stannis, Renly, and Robb all cast aside their crowns to call a Great Council, but Renly refuses. As the would-be king prepares for battle, a shadow kills him; Stannis's shadow, according to Catelyn.[57] Most of the forces Renly had brought with him to Storm's End join Stannis, though Ser Loras Tyrell, and Lords Randyll Tarly and Mathis Rowan do not.[30]\n\nFollowing Renly's death, Stannis is troubled by terrible nightmares, and only Melisandre, who now shares his pavilion, can soothe him to sleep.[24] He confides in Davos that he sometimes dreams of Renly's death, but that he is innocent, as he had been in his bed when Renly was slain, and that his squire, Devan Seaworth, had been unable to wake him. Stannis is vexed by Renly having offered him a peach during their parley.[24]\n\nStannis has surrounded Storm's End by land and sea, and he promises that the garrison might go free unharmed is the castle is yielded up to him in a fortnight.[58] The castellan, Cortnay Penrose, continues to refuse, however, even during the last parley a fortnight later, as yielding requires giving the boy Edric to Stannis. Cortnay challenges Stannis to single combat to decide the matter, but Stannis refuses. Melisandre tells Stannis that she has seen Cortnay's death in her flames. Unwilling to leave Storm's End untaken out of fear that it will be viewed as a defeat, and determined to get a hold of Robert's bastard to prove the incest, Stannis orders Davos to land a small boat beneath the castle, unseen in the black of the night, without anyone else knowing about it, taking Melisandre with him.[24] Davos rows Melisandre beneath Storm's End, where she gives birth to a shadow which resembles Stannis and enters the castle.[24] That same night, Cortnay falls off a tower of the castle to his death,[59] and his lieutenant, Lord Elwood Meadows, yields the castle to Stannis,[60] who subsequently burns the godswood of Storm's End.[61] It is said that Cortnay threw himself off the tower, and his guards could not find anyone else in the room, nor had they seen anyone else enter. However, Lord Varys believes Cortnay to have been killed with magic.[59]\n\nWith Storm's End fallen, Stannis is free to march for King's Landing, which has been preparing for his arrival.[61] Stannis's bannermen convince him that Melisandre should not join him on the campaign, as a battlefield is no place for a woman and she might get credit for his victory as a sorceress. Stannis sends Melisandre and Edric to Dragonstone, and he begins marching north from Storm's End toward the kingswood and the southern shore of the Blackwater Rush. Meanwhile, Ser Imry Florent leads Stannis's fleet north along Massey's Hook toward Blackwater Bay.[62]\n\nTo prevent people in the city from joining Stannis, Tyrion Lannister, the acting Hand of the King, has the High Septon spread the news that Stannis means to burn to Great Sept of Baelor.[61] Tyrion has his Vale clansmen light fires to burn the grass which would be consumed by Stannis's horses, while killing his scouts and raiding his baggage train. In response, Stannis's vanguard sets the kingswood afire, to smoke the clansmen out.[63]\n\nStannis attacks King's Landing during the Battle of the Blackwater, with most of Stannis's ships entering the harbor to land soldiers and face the smaller fleet of King Joffrey. The Lannisters light wildfire and raise a giant iron chain to prevent ships from sailing out of the harbor, and most ships in both fleets are destroyed. Stannis's soldiers use the destroyed ships as a bridge to reach the gates of the city, however, and they come close to victory. The forces of Lords Tywin Lannister and Mace Tyrell arrive unexpectedly, led by the \"ghost\" of Renly Baratheon (who is later revealed to have been Ser Garlan Tyrell, dressed in Renly's armor),[64] and Stannis's soldiers are overwhelmed or surrender. Ser Richard Horpe and Ser Justin Massey convince Stannis to retreat.[65]\n\n\n## A Storm of Swords\n\n\nWhile Stannis is away, Melisandre and Queen Selyse burn Lord Guncer Sunglass and Ser Hubard Rambton's sons.[9] Defeated on the Blackwater, Stannis returns to Dragonstone on the Lysene ships of Salladhor Saan[66] with the few men that remain to him, most of them queen's men from House Florent.[67] Stannis names Lord Alester Florent as his Hand of the King, but refuses to see anyone but Melisandre, brooding in the Stone Drum instead. He does not eat, and tales are told claiming that Stannis and Melisandre go down into the Dragonmont to watch the fires inside.[67]\n\nAfter Ser Davos Seaworth is arrested for his plan to kill Melisandre,[67] Melisandre visits him in the dungeon. The shadowbinder informs the Onion Knight that she dare not make another shadow with Stannis as his \"fires burn so low\" that doing so might kill him.[68] Lord Florent, losing faith in Stannis's chances for success, prepares to offer peace to Lord Tywin Lannister, now King Joffrey's Hand. In exchange for giving up his claim to the Iron Throne and retracting all he said regarding the bastardy of Cersei Lannister's children, Stannis would be accepted back into the king's peace and allowed to rule as Lord of Dragonstone and Lord of Storm's End. Alester wishes to seal the bargain by offering Princess Shireen Baratheon in marriage to Prince Tommen Baratheon. However, before Alester can give the letter to Sallador and have it secretly delivered to King's Landing, Lord Florent is arrested for treason and imprisoned with Davos in the dungeon.[68]\n\nMelisandre asks Stannis to relinquish Edric Storm, the bastard son of the late King Robert I Baratheon, over to her, claiming that king's blood will allow her to wake a stone dragon. Stannis refuses, however.[68][11] The priestess believes that Stannis is the prince that was promised.[11]\n\nStannis has Davos released from the dungeon and brought before him. While escorting Davos to Stannis in the Chamber of the Painted Table, Ser Axell Florent tries to make Davos tell Stannis that Axell should be named the King's Hand to succeed his elder brother, Lord Alester. When Davos sees Stannis, the king appears ten years older, shrunken and beginning to be grey-haired. Stannis agrees with Davos that Axell's plan to attack Claw Isle should be rejected, and he names Davos as Lord of the Rainwood, Admiral of the Narrow Sea, and his new Hand of the King. Stannis reveals that he has seen a high hill in a forest, where men in black had made a ring of torches, and where shapes were moving through the snow. Melisandre again asks for Edric, but Stannis refuses, ordering her to use leeches which had been feeding on the boy instead. Stannis throws three leeches into a fire one by one, stating the names of the other three surviving kings (Joffrey Baratheon, Balon Greyjoy, and Robb Stark) of the War of the Five Kings.[11]\n\nBalon falls to his death at Pyke[69] and Robb is killed in the Red Wedding,[70] leading to a discussion among Stannis's counselors whether Edric should be sacrificed to wake a dragon from stone, as Melisandre claims will happen. Davos attempts to convince Stannis not to sacrifice Edric once they are alone, but Stannis admits that, should Joffrey die as well, he is willing to consider doing it.[5]\n\nUpon hearing the news of Joffrey's death at his royal wedding, Stannis is willing to sacrifice Edric, though he still does not like the idea.[18] Several knights and lordlings have greater loyalty to Stannis and the Faith than to Melisandre and R'hllor.[5] These king's men are willing to help Davos smuggle Edric to safety from Dragonstone under the care of Ser Andrew Estermont.[18] Stannis is furious, but Davos urges Stannis to sail for the Wall, claiming that \"a king protects his people, or he is no king at all\", and the Onion Lord presents his king with Maester Aemon's letter asking for aid for the Night's Watch, of which Stannis had been unaware.[18]\n\nMelisandre sacrifices Lord Florent to R'hllor to gain favorable winds for the journey north,[42] and Stannis sails on Sallador's ships from Dragonstone to the Wall. He leaves Selyse and Shireen at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea while marching west with all his forces.[71] Guided by Cotter Pyke and his men from Eastwatch,[71] Stannis's army arrives in time to defeat the wildling host gathered by Mance Rayder, King-Beyond-the-Wall, during the battle beneath the Wall.[72]\n\nStannis occupies the King's Tower at Castle Black.[71] Though he plans to burn Mance, once a deserter from the Night's Watch, for treason, he is willing to allow the other free folk through the Wall if they swear to R'hllor, settling them in the Gift. He has Jon Snow, the bastard son of the late Lord Eddard Stark and the half brother of Robb Stark, brought to him, and the king offers to legitimize the youth and name him Lord of Winterfell in exchange for Jon's help in winning the north to his side. Stannis allows Jon time to think about the offer, which Jon is reluctant to accept because it would require the burning of the godswood of Winterfell.[16]\n\nAs Stannis needs to negotiate with the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, he is displeased that after ten days of voting, the black brothers still have not yet chosen a new commander to succeed the late Jeor Mormont, and calls several of the higher ranking men to him to inform them that he will choose a Lord Commander for them, if they do not come to a decision that same day.[10] Stannis informs Maester Aemon and Samwell Tarly that he has sent word to his castellan, Ser Rolland Storm, to begin mining dragonglass at Dragonstone to fight the Others, and he confirms that he is aware of Aemon's Targaryen ancestry. Aemon requests to see Lightbringer, and Stannis grants the request.[10] Thanks to Samwell's involvement,[10] Jon Snow is elected as Lord Commander,[73] preventing him from accepting Stannis's offer.\n\n\n## A Feast for Crows\n\n\nAccording to Princess Arianne Martell, Stannis has been attainted by the Crown.[74]\n\nStannis, the self-styled King of Westeros,[75] remains at the King's Tower of Castle Black. He plans to use Val, whom his men call the \"wildling princess\", to seal the peace between the northmen and the free folk.[76] Lord Commander Jon Snow has given Stannis food, shelter, the Nightfort, and leave to settle some free folk in the Gift. Stannis sends ravens to the northern lords, demanding their fealty, but only House Karstark replies, swearing Stannis their allegiance.[76]\n\nBefore blaming her brother Tyrion for the murder of her father, Lord Tywin, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister suspects Stannis's involvement. She recalls that she would have eventually dealt with Stannis and Renly, but Lord Eddard Stark's investigations had forced her to kill  Robert first.[77] Cersei is giddy as a maiden when she learns that Stannis has left Dragonstone, and she believes that Stannis has finally admitted defeat and gone into exile.[78]\n\nWhen news reaches King's Landing that Stannis is now in the north, Cersei is furious.[78] She sends two thousand Lannister soldiers to Dragonstone to defeat the small garrison Stannis had left behind and take the castle.[78] Meanwhile, Lord Roose Bolton, the new Warden of the North, and two thousand soldiers from House Frey are to deal with Stannis and his few thousand soldiers in the north.[78] Cersei wishes to deal with the Greyjoys only after Stannis has been defeated.[79] News reaches King's Landing that the Golden Company has broken its contract with Myr, and it is being said that they have been hired by Stannis instead.[79] The small council receives reports that Stannis's Hand of the King, Lord Davos Seaworth, has traveled to White Harbor and that he had been arrested by Lord Wyman Manderly. Cersei orders him to execute Davos.[79]\n\nIn Braavos, Maester Aemon becomes convinced that Melisandre has misread the signs that had convinced her that Stannis is Azor Ahai reborn.[80]\n\n\n## A Dance with Dragons\n\n\nStannis keeps his wildling prisoners beyond the Wall. He rides down the kingsroad almost as far as Queenscrown, prowls through the empty hovels of Mole's Town, inspects the ruins at Queensgate and Oakenshield, and walks atop the Wall each night with Melisandre, while selecting prisoners for questioning during the day.[3] House Mormont has refused to join Stannis, whereas House Manderly's reply to Stannis's letter only made excuses. Jon Snow, the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, refuses to give Stannis ownership of the sixteen castles at the Wall that are unoccupied by the black brothers, and he asks Stannis for men instead to serve under the command of his own commanders.[3]\n\nStannis sends Lord Davos Seaworth to White Harbor to treat with Lord Wyman Manderly on his behalf,[81][82] as well sends Ser Richard Horpe and Ser Justin Massey as envoys south.[81] Stannis approves of Jon's execution of Janos Slynt,[81] and he has Mance Rayder burned in sacrifice to R'hllor as punishment for having deserted the Night's Watch.[32] In reality, however, Stannis has unknowingly burned Rattleshirt, whom Melisandre had used a glamor upon to look like Mance.[27] Stannis offers the remaining free folk the choice between bending the knee or returning beyond the Wall to die. Most of the free folk bend the knee and are allowed south of the Wall.[32]\n\nStannis wins the support of half of the forces of House Umber, commanded by Mors Umber. The remainder of the Umber forces have marched for House Bolton, under the command of Hother Umber, as the Greatjon remains a captive of House Frey at the Twins after the Red Wedding.[83] Stannis plans to march with the wildlings on the Dreadfort, as Ramsay Bolton has marched south to recover Moat Cailin from ironborn. Jon warns that the Dreadfort will learn of Stannis's approach long before he can ever reach the castle, and Moat Cailin will fall quickly, which means that Ramsay and his father, Lord Roose Bolton, are free to march against Stannis with their entire force. Additionally, marching with wildlings will only serve to turn the northmen against Stannis. Instead, Jon proposes that Stannis visit the mountain clans, including the Flints, Wulls, Norreys and Liddles. Instead of the Dreadfort, Jon suggests marching against Deepwood Motte to fight the ironborn of Asha Greyjoy. In exchange, the wildlings remain at the Wall.[83]\n\nAt White Harbor, Lord Wyman Manderly arrests Stannis's envoy and Hand, Davos Seaworth, and fakes his execution. In secret, he promises to swear loyalty to Stannis if Davos can bring him Rickon Stark.[84]\n\nStannis follows the advice of Lord Commander Snow and marches west to the northern mountains, although one of his squires, Davos's son Devan, remains at Castle Black with Melisandre. The red priestess later thinks that her bed has seen little use since Stannis's departure.[27][27] The king wins over several of the mountain clans, gathering an additional three thousand men for his army. Stannis then recovers Deepwood Motte from the ironborn,[41] returning the castle to House Glover.[84] Stannis is joined by the Mormonts, as well as by smallfolk fleeing from the ironborn and survivors from the battle outside the gates of Winterfell, men once sworn to the Hornwoods, Cerwyns, and Tallharts.[2] Asha and several ironborn are taken captive.[41]\n\nStannis and his army march on Winterfell, taking Asha with them, but they are slowed by heavy snows in the wolfswood, and Stannis is forced to encamp at a small crofters' village three days west of Winterfell.[85][86][19] Arnolf Karstark and Mors Umber have begun to march as well, and plan to join Stannis near Winterfell.[2][85] Arnolf eventually finds Stannis at the crofters' village.[87] Many of Stannis's men succumb to the blizzard, including his remaining squire, Bryen Farring. When four Peasebury men are condemned for cannibalism, Stannis allows them to be burned by Ser Godry Farring, with the queen's men believing them to be sacrifices to ward off the blizzard.[87]\n\nTycho Nestoris, an emissary from the Iron Bank of Braavos, arrives at the Wall. As Queen Regent Cersei Lannister has ceased the Iron Throne's payments of loans, the Iron Bank wishes to broach the subject to Stannis. Jon Snow receives the banker and realizes that if Stannis gives in to the demands of the Iron Bank, the Braavosi will give him their support, which might win him the Iron Throne.[88] Alys Karstark arrives at Castle Black and warns Jon that her uncle, Arnolf, is only feigning loyalty to Stannis. In truth he sides with House Bolton, and is planning to betray Stannis at the opportune moment. Jon sends a message to Deepwood in an attempt to warn Stannis.[88] Tycho travels to Deepwood in search of Stannis, and from there continues to the crofters' village as well. Near Winterfell, Tycho finds Mors Umber with a captive Theon Greyjoy and \"Arya Stark\" (actually Jeyne Poole), whom he brings with him to Stannis.[87]\n\nJon Snow receives a taunting letter at Castle Black from Ramsay, stating that Stannis was killed along with most of his army in seven days of battle.[89]\n\n\n## The Winds of Winter\n\n\nAt the crofters' village, Stannis prepares for the looming battle against the Boltons. He signs a contract with Tycho Nestoris and plans to send the banker back to the Wall for safety. Tycho brought a message from Jon Snow informing Stannis of Arnolf Karstark's planned treachery, so Stannis has Arnolf, his son Arthor, and his three grandsons arrested and plans to execute them. The king sends Ser Justin Massey to escort \"Arya Stark\" back to Castle Black to reunite her with Jon, in gratitude for the Lord Commander's counsel of gathering the northern mountain clans. Justin is to then travel to Braavos and use money from the Iron Bank to hire twenty thousand sellswords for Stannis. Stannis tells Justin that he may hear of Stannis's death in Braavos, but even if that news is true, the knight is to follow the orders as to seat his daughter, Princess Shireen Baratheon, on the Iron Throne. Stannis next receives Asha Greyjoy, and informs her that her brother Theon must be executed, as showing him mercy would mean losing all of the northmen. Asha suggests that Stannis behead Theon with Lightbringer before a weirwood at a nearby isle.[65]\n\n\n## Quotes by Stannis\n\n\n\n## Quotes about Stannis\n\n\n\n## Family\n\n\n\n## Behind the Scenes\n\n\nAccording to George R.
