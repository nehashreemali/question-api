  "content": "Brienne Tarth,[5] commonly called Brienne of Tarth after her island home,[1] is the only living child and heir of Lord Selwyn Tarth of Evenfall.[6] Brienne is sometimes called the Maid of Tarth[7] and mocked as Brienne the Beauty.[8]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Brienne is portrayed by Gwendoline Christie.\n\nBrienne is unfeminine in appearance and is considered unattractive by Westerosi standards.[1] She is tall, muscular, flat-chested, and ungainly,[1] with long, shoulder-length brittle straw-colored hair[9] and broad, coarse features that are covered in freckles. Brienne's teeth are prominent and crooked. Her mouth is wide, her lips are swollen, and her nose has been broken more than once.[1] She has large, beautiful blue eyes.[10][2] Her fingers are thick and callused.[11] Brienne is horse-faced.[12]\n\nWhen asked about her height, George R. R. Martin replied:\n\nBrienne has spent most of her life as the object of scorn, rejection and—at best—pity. When she tried to dress and act like a proper lady, she was met with mockery and disdain for her unattractive appearance and lack of feminine social graces; when she turned to a career more suited to her talents as a warrior, she received only contempt and resentment for her gender despite her considerable skill.[14] Perhaps because of this background, Brienne is as awkward in personality as she is in appearance. While Lady Maege and Dacey Mormont have found respect and acceptance as female warriors,[15] Brienne yearns for respect and acceptance from others, and easily gives her love and loyalty to the few people who treat her with any degree of genuine courtesy.[11][16] Brienne hates roses[17] because of her history with Ronnet Connington.[18]\n\nBrienne can be headstrong and judgmental, but she is also honest, straightforward, loyal and determined. Although she has received poor treatment from most knights, Brienne clings to a naively idealized concept of knighthood. Despite—or perhaps because of—the fact that she has no expectation of ever being recognized by society for her accomplishments, she nevertheless strives to live up to the ideal of a true knight at all times.[18]\n\nInstead of a lady's attire, Brienne wears a velvet doublet quartered rose-and-azure, breeches, boots, and a fine-tooled swordbelt.[1] Brienne's dented steel armor is a brilliant, deep blue cobalt, and she also has mail.[1] Brienne has a sword,[19] and she wields a blunt morningstar during melees.[1] She also knows how to wield an axe.[10] Her black destrier is barded with the quartered sun-and-moon heraldry of House Tarth.[1]\n\nBrienne was born to Lord Selwyn Tarth, Lord of Evenfall Hall, on the island of Tarth. Her mother died when she was so young that she does not remember her.[10] She had a single older brother, Galladon, who drowned when he was eight and she was four, and two sisters, both of whom died in the cradle.[18] This makes her the only living offspring of Lord Selwyn, a fact that naturally encouraged him to find a suitable match for her. Given her ugly and ungainly appearance and attitude, however, the task was a difficult one, especially since Brienne was bent on a martial life rather than a marital one, more comfortable with a sword than in the company of court society. She was tutored by her septa, Roelle, and had the equivalent of a knight's training by a master-at-arms, Ser Goodwin.[14][17] Brienne has known Ser Cortnay Penrose since she was a girl.[20] Brienne has learned many songs by heart since Evenfall Hall always had singers in her youth.[10]\n\nBrienne's father successfully found three men willing to betroth her, though all the betrothals fell through. A younger son of Lord Bryen Caron was Brienne's first betrothed. They met only once, on the occasion of their betrothal, when she was seven and he was ten. The boy died two years later from a chill, along with his father, mother and sisters. Had he not died, Brienne would have been wed to him within the year of her first flowering.[9] The second betrothal was to Ser Ronnet Connington, who was six years older than her. On their meeting, Red Ronnet gave her a rose, and told her it was all she would have of him, breaking the betrothal as he felt she was a \"freak\".[21] The last man Brienne was betrothed to, Ser Humfrey Wagstaff, warned her he would insist she act like \"a proper woman\" once they were wed. Though only sixteen, Brienne replied she would only accept such a demand from a man who could beat her in combat. In the effort, Humfrey ended up with three broken bones and a broken betrothal.[14]\n\nAfter that, Lord Selwyn stopped trying to arrange a marriage for Brienne.[14] Brienne's only positive encounter with a man occurred when House Tarth's liege, Lord Renly Baratheon, visited their island during his coming of age progress. He crossed paths with Brienne and treated her courteously, and she fell in love with him.[9] Sometime later, Lord Selwyn sent his daughter to Storm's End.[20] Renly's fool has made cruel japes about Brienne.[10]\n\nBrienne supports Renly Baratheon when he declares himself king. She travels from Tarth to Highgarden by way of Bronzegate, Bitterbridge, and the roseroad.[22] Brienne cries bitter tears[18] when Renly is wed to Margaery Tyrell at Highgarden.[23]  In Renly's camp outside Highgarden, Brienne is continuously mocked. Some of the young knights wager on who will be the first to get her maidenhead and begin to court her and treat her chivalrously, until Lord Randyll Tarly puts an end to it, warning Brienne that her presence is the cause of the problem.[8]\n\nBrienne joins Renly in his march to King's Landing during the War of the Five Kings.[1] She proves her mettle with a morningstar in a melee at Bitterbridge, defeating Ser Loras Tyrell, the Knight of Flowers, as well as many of her mocking suitors. She asks to join the Rainbow Guard as her prize, becoming Brienne the Blue. Renly awards her the rainbow cloak he had been hoping to give to Ser Barristan Selmy. Brienne sharply reminds Catelyn Stark, an envoy of Robb Stark, the new King in the North, of the courtesy due Renly as a king. Brienne is later dismayed when Renly denies the need for an escort during his stroll with Catelyn after the night's feast.[1]\n\nAt Renly's parley with his brother, Stannis Baratheon, at the siege of Storm's End, Brienne is his standard-bearer. After the negotiations fail, she is assigned to do the same in the upcoming clash, riding in the vanguard alongside Loras, the Lord Commander of the Rainbow Guard.[24] The next day at dawn, she is arming Renly for battle against his brother when a shadow enters his tent and assassinates him. Brienne is accused of the murder by Ser Emmon Cuy. Since her own sword is absent, Brienne fends off Emmon with Renly's blade. Catelyn convinces Ser Robar Royce that Brienne is innocent, and she takes Brienne with her when the northern envoys flee the camp.[19]\n\nWhen Loras finds Renly's body, he kills Emmon and Robar, both members of the Rainbow Guard, in a rage.[25] As Stannis continues his siege of Storm's End, Ser Cortnay Penrose defends Brienne's honor after she is accused by Ser Guyard Morrigen of having slain Renly.[20]\n\nBrienne leaves her plate armor and horse at Storm's End, but keeps the rainbow cloak. After discarding her other blood-stained clothes, Brienne receives spare garb from the large Ser Wendel Manderly, one of Catelyn's escorts. When they arrive at Riverrun, Brienne wants to leave to take revenge with Renly's sword on Stannis for Renly's death, but Catelyn convinces Brienne to enter her service instead.[11] Brienne remains within Riverrun to help defend the castle during the Battle of the Fords. Catelyn gives her gowns, mail, and boiled leather.[10] Brienne is present when Lady Stark speaks with the Kingslayer, Ser Jaime Lannister, in his dungeon cell, and gives Catelyn her sword when it is asked for.[26]\n\nAt Riverrun, after receiving news that her sons Bran and Rickon Stark have been killed, Catelyn decides to free Ser Jaime Lannister, making Brienne escort him to King's Landing to fulfill the promise made by Jaime's brother Tyrion, the Hand of the King, to return her daughters Sansa and Arya if the Kingslayer were freed. Ser Cleos Frey, Jaime's cousin, accompanies them as an envoy.[27]\n\nBrienne defends Jaime ably. She learns much of his history that is little known to Westeros at large and the two develop a grudging respect for each other. They make for the capital by boat, throwing off pursuit from Riverrun when Brienne scales a cliff and rolls a boulder onto Ser Robin Ryger's pursuing galley.[2] The trio depart the Red Fork and continue by land. At the Inn of the Kneeling Man, Brienne's wariness prevents the group from taking the innkeeper's travel advice, as he is in league with bandits and is attempting to lead them into ambush.[28]\n\nLater, they are ambushed by different outlaws on the Duskendale road near Maidenpool. Cleos is killed and Jaime tries to escape, dueling Brienne with Cleos's sword. Manacled and out of practice, Jaime is surprised to learn that Brienne is stronger than him.[12] Jaime cannot defeat Brienne, who holds his head underwater. Their fighting is interrupted by the Brave Companions, however. Four Bloody Mummers beat Brienne, knocking out two of her teeth. Zollo then chops off Jaime's sword hand.[12] His fighting ability gone, Jaime despairs for his life, but Brienne convinces him to live for revenge. In turn, Jaime prevents Zollo, Rorge, and Shagwell from raping Brienne.[29] The Brave Companions confiscate Brienne's armor and Renly's sword.[30]\n\nAt Harrenhal, the two share a bath and Jaime reveals he stopped the wildfire plot of King Aerys II Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion. Qyburn brings her a pink gown, which Jaime thinks she looks ridiculous wearing. Lord Roose Bolton sends Jaime on his way, but keeps Brienne as Vargo Hoat's prize.[30] Jaime returns after dreaming of her, however, and rescues her from the bear pit of Harrenhal.[3] Brienne bites Vargo Hoat's ear,[3] which leaves him delirious from infection.[31] Steelshanks Walton escorts Brienne and Jaime toward King's Landing, and Brienne is shocked when Ser Bertram Beesbury informs them at Brindlewood of Catelyn's death in the Red Wedding.[31]\n\nAfter their arrival in King's Landing, the pair are confronted by Ser Loras Tyrell, who still believes Brienne guilty of Renly's regicide. Jaime has Brienne arrested for her own protection,[31] and he arranges for Loras to speak to her; this finally dispels Brienne's blame.[32]\n\nJaime entrusts Brienne with the Valyrian steel longsword given to him by his father Tywin, naming it Oathkeeper. He sends her to seek the vanished Sansa Stark, to fulfill his promise to Catelyn. As Oathkeeper was forged from the metal of Eddard Stark's greatsword, Ice, Brienne is using Stark steel to rescue the Stark girl. Along with this, Jaime gives her two bags full of coin, a mail hauberk, a Lothston shield, and a letter signed by King Tommen I Baratheon saying that she is on a royal mission.[7]\n\nSer Jaime Lannister is sent by his sister, Queen Cersei Lannister, to subdue the remaining rebels in the riverlands. At Harrenhal he strikes Ronnet Connington for mocking Brienne.[21]\n\nUnbeknownst to Brienne, Sansa Stark is hiding at the Eyrie under the assumed name of Alayne Stone with Lord Petyr Baelish.[33] Brienne searches for Sansa along the Rosby road in the crownlands, meeting Illifer the Penniless, Creighton Longbough, and Shadrich, although she leaves them behind at the Old Stone Bridge.[9] She visits the Dun Fort in Duskendale and has her shield repainted to the arms of Ser Duncan the Tall. Podrick Payne, once the squire of Sansa's husband Tyrion Lannister, tries to discretely follow her on the Duskendale road, and Brienne allows the boy to join her quest at the Hollard castle.[14]\n\nBrienne's next stop is at Maidenpool, which she only enters with the unwanted aid of Ser Hyle Hunt, one of the knights who had mockingly courted her in Renly's camp. There she finds Lord Randyll Tarly dispensing justice; he begrudgingly allows her to continue her search. At the Stinking Goose she meets Nimble Dick Crabb, who leads her after a fool, whom she believes is Dontos Hollard, who might have Sansa with him.[8] Brienne wishes Jaime Lannister had come with her, but realizes his place is with the king.[17]\n\nTraveling through Crackclaw Point, the trio arrive at the Whispers, the ruined hall of Nimble Dick's ancestors from House Crabb. They meet a band of Brave Companions remnants led by the fool Shagwell, the psychotic jester. Shagwell kills Dick, but Brienne then kills Pyg and Timeon with Oathkeeper. She forces Shagwell to dig a grave for Dick and then kills him as well when the fool turns on her. Hyle joins her party, having followed her from Maidenpool.[17]\n\nFollowing the sellswords' information, Brienne heads back to the riverlands to find Sandor Clegane, who was reported to be with a girl, unbeknownst to her to be the wrong daughter. At Maidenpool they join with Meribald, an itinerant septon, who accompanies them to Saltpans. From there she visits the nearby Quiet Isle, where the Elder Brother assures her that the Hound is dead.[18]\n\nAt the inn at the crossroads near the Trident, Brienne encounters another group of former Brave Companions led by Rorge, who has been masquerading as Sandor while raping and murdering in the riverlands. Defending the orphans at the inn, the outnumbered Brienne kills Rorge but is grievously wounded by Biter, who chews the flesh off her cheek.[34] Before passing out, she sees what she thinks is his foot-long tongue, but in reality is the bloody tip of the spear Gendry uses to kill Biter and save her. Despite rescuing her, Gendry and the remaining members of the brotherhood without banners take her captive, along with Podrick and Hyle. Delirious from the bite, she calls out for Jaime Lannister.[35]\n\nThe undead Catelyn Stark, now leading the brotherhood as \"Lady Stoneheart\", does not believe Brienne's explanation of her search for Sansa and instead judges her to be a traitor who is serving House Lannister, due to her sword with a golden lion's head as its pommel, and the letter signed and sealed by King Tommen I Baratheon stating that Brienne is \"about his business\".[35] Brienne is given the choice of \"sword or noose\" — either prove her loyalty by killing Jaime Lannister, or hang. Brienne refuses to choose and is sentenced to hang, along with her two companions, Podrick and Ser Hyle.[35] According to a semi-canon source, when she sees Podrick choking, she shouts \"sword\" to save him.[35][36]\n\nHaving been spared by the brotherhood, Brienne appears briefly at Pennytree when Jaime camps there. She asks Jaime to help her save Sansa Stark from the Hound, claiming they are a day's ride away. She tells Jaime, however, that he must go with her alone, or the Hound will kill Sansa.[37] Cersei is skeptical when she is informed that her twin, Jaime, disappeared with a woman in the riverlands.[38]\n\nPrevious speculation on Brienne's descent included that Brienne descends from Ser Duncan the Tall, a former Lord Commander of the Kingsguard during the reign of King Aegon V Targaryen. An argument often raised was that a shield bearing Duncan's personal arms was in the armory at Evenfall Hall, and that Brienne later used these arms while traveling in the crownlands and riverlands.[14] Though George R. R. Martin initially only confirmed that a descendant of Duncan appears in the books,[40][41] in 2016 at Balticon, Martin confirmed Brienne's descent, stating that the exact relation between Duncan and Brienne would be \"revealed in time\".[42]\n\nIn an early draft of A Storm of Swords, instead of being saved by Jaime, Brienne is raped repeatedly by the Brave Companions.[43]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nBrienne is unfeminine in appearance and is considered unattractive by Westerosi standards.[1] She is tall, muscular, flat-chested, and ungainly,[1] with long, shoulder-length brittle straw-colored hair[9] and broad, coarse features that are covered in freckles.
