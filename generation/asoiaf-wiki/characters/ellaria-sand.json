  "content": "Ellaria Sand is the beloved paramour of Prince Oberyn Martell, and the mother of the four youngest \"Sand Snakes,\" Oberyn's bastard daughters. Ellaria herself is the bastard daughter of Harmen Uller, Lord of Hellholt.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Ellaria is portrayed by Indira Varma.\n\nAlthough not accounted as a beautiful woman, Ellaria is regarded as attractive and eye-catching, with an exotic, sensuous flair.[3] She has black hair.[4] She is described as a good woman, strong and brave, with a gentle heart.[5] Ellaria is believed to worship a Lysene love goddess.[3] She is described by her paramour, Oberyn Martell, as being sexually adventurous and potentially bisexual.[4] Lady Olenna Tyrell, who is angry at Oberyn for having crippled her grandson Willas Tyrell in a tourney accident, disparages Ellaria as \"the serpent's whore\".[1]\n\nWhen Oberyn Martell travels to King's Landing to take the seat on the small council offered to his brother Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, Ellaria accompanies him.[4] Oberyn hints to Tyrion Lannister that Ellaria wants to sleep with Queen Cersei Lannister.[4][6]\n\nShe is a guest at the royal wedding of King Joffrey I Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell, seated with other Dornishmen at a place of honor, but away from the Tyrells.[7]\n\nEllaria is also present at the trial by combat for Tyrion Lannister, where Oberyn serves as his champion, and she witnesses Oberyn's death at the hands of Ser Gregor Clegane.[8]\n\nAfter Oberyn's death, Ellaria escorts his remains back to Dorne. After Prince Doran arrests the eldest Sand Snakes, Ellaria and her daughters are secluded in the Water Gardens, to prevent them from being used in the plots of others.[9]\n\nEllaria is present at the feast in honor of Ser Balon Swann's arrival at Sunspear, where he delivers the skull of Gregor Clegane to Prince Doran.[5]\n\nEllaria is later summoned to Doran's private chambers for a conference between him, his daughter Arianne Martell, and the eldest Sand Snakes. She becomes distraught when she hears Obara Sand's statement that Gregor's death \"is a start\". With Tywin Lannister, Robert Baratheon, Amory Lorch and now the Mountain dead, everyone who was part of the death of Elia Martell and her children, Ellaria wants it to be an end. Ellaria fears for her own daughters, who admire Obara, Nymeria, and Tyene Sand, and fears where the quest for revenge will lead them. Doran comforts Ellaria, and tells her to go to her girls while promising no harm will come to them, and then continues the conference without her.[5]\n\nDoran sends Ellaria to her father Harmen Uller's seat at Hellholt, along with her youngest daughter, Loreza Sand. Ellaria's daughter Elia is one of Arianne's traveling companions, Obella is sent to Sunspear to serve as a cupbearer to the wife of its castellan, Ser Manfrey Martell, and Dorea remains at the Water Gardens with Doran.[10]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nAlthough not accounted as a beautiful woman, Ellaria is regarded as attractive and eye-catching, with an exotic, sensuous flair.[3] She has black hair.[4] She is described as a good woman, strong and brave, with a gentle heart.[5] Ellaria is believed to worship a Lysene love goddess.[3] She is described by her paramour, Oberyn Martell, as being sexually adventurous and potentially bisexual.[4] Lady Olenna Tyrell, who is angry at Oberyn for having crippled her grandson Willas Tyrell in a tourney accident, disparages Ellaria as \"the serpent's whore\".[1]\n\n\n## Recent Events\n\n\n\n## A Storm of Swords\n\n\nWhen Oberyn Martell travels to King's Landing to take the seat on the small council offered to his brother Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, Ellaria accompanies him.[4] Oberyn hints to Tyrion Lannister that Ellaria wants to sleep with Queen Cersei Lannister.[4][6]\n\nShe is a guest at the royal wedding of King Joffrey I Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell, seated with other Dornishmen at a place of honor, but away from the Tyrells.[7]\n\nEllaria is also present at the trial by combat for Tyrion Lannister, where Oberyn serves as his champion, and she witnesses Oberyn's death at the hands of Ser Gregor Clegane.[8]\n\n\n## A Feast for Crows\n\n\nAfter Oberyn's death, Ellaria escorts his remains back to Dorne.
