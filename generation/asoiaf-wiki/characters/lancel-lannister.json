  "content": "Lancel Lannister is a member of House Lannister of Casterly Rock and is the eldest son of Ser Kevan Lannister. Lancel and his cousin, Tyrek Lannister, are squires to King Robert I Baratheon.[3]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Lancel is portrayed by Eugene Simon.\n\nA handsome and strong youth, Lancel has the thick sandy hair and green eyes of House Lannister. He has a wisp of a mustache.[4][5] The boy is said to closely resemble his cousin, Ser Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard,[5] whom he admires.[6]\n\nLancel is humorless, self-assured, arrogant as a Lannister, and impatient.[4][5] Comely and well spoken,[7] Lancel is able to sing.[4] The youth is eager for glory.[8]\n\nLancel's attire includes slashed red velvet with black silk undersleeves, a jeweled dagger, and a gilded scabbard hanging from his swordbelt.[5]\n\nQueen Cersei Lannister insisted that King Robert I Baratheon take her cousins, Lancel and Tyrek, as squires.[9] Cersei's father, Lord Tywin Lannister, ordered his nephew to obey all of Cersei's instructions.[10]\n\nRobert I Baratheon insults his squires, the cousins Lancel and Tyrek Lannister, for not being able to fit armor on the fat king.[9]\n\nAfter Robert is mortally wounded by a boar, Ser Barristan Selmy informs Lords Eddard Stark and Varys that Lancel had supplied wine to the king during the hunt in the kingswood.[11] When Varys asks Lancel about the hunt, the youth says he was given the wineskins from his cousin, Queen Cersei Lannister, who said they were her husband's favorite vintage.[12]\n\nWith Ser Jaime Lannister, her twin and lover, a captive of Robb Stark, Cersei sleeps with Lancel,[2] although the youth never finishes inside her.[5][6] Cersei, the regent for King Joffrey I Baratheon, insists that her cousin be knighted as Ser Lancel.[13] Tyrion Lannister, the acting Hand of the King, learns from his sister that the alcohol supplied by Lancel to Robert was strongwine fortified to be more potent than the king was accustomed.[14]\n\nLancel becomes Cersei's new favorite.[13] During one visit to Cersei's chambers in the Red Keep, Tyrion hears Lancel singing \"The Seasons of My Love\" to the accompaniment of a harpist and a piper.[4]\n\nAfter Tyrion has Pycelle imprisoned, Cersei sends an emboldened Lancel to Tyrion to demand the release of the Grand Maester. Tyrion gets Lancel to admit his involvement in Robert's death and that he is sleeping with Cersei. Tyrion blackmails his shamed cousin into spying on Cersei for him.[5] The new knight later reveals to Tyrion that Cersei is discretely meeting with the Kettleblack brothers.[15]\n\nLancel survives the riot of King's Landing, riding to the Red Keep with Cersei and Prince Tommen Baratheon. When Tyrion kicks King Joffrey, Ser Balon Swann restrains Lancel.[15]\n\nIn the royal sept at the Red Keep, Lancel informs Tyrion that Cersei plans for Prince Tommen to be sheltered at Rosby with Lord Gyles Rosby. Tyrion sends Ser Jacelyn Bywater to secure Tommen at Rosby under Tyrion's influence.[8]\n\nLancel wants his own command[8] in the upcoming battle against Stannis Baratheon, Joffrey's uncle, which is granted.[16][17] His arm is wounded during the Battle of the Blackwater, and the sight of Lancel in his bloody surcoat causes some women in the Queen's Ballroom to scream. Lancel angrily objects to Cersei's demand to have Joffrey brought inside Maegor's Holdfast, as the king's disappearance from the battle would cause desertion among his defenders. Lancel offers to stay by Joffrey's side as long as the king remains in the fight, but the queen responds by striking his wound, which bleeds anew. Sansa Stark has a serving man bring Lancel to Maester Frenken for treatment.[18] Stannis's army is eventually defeated with the arrival of Lords Tywin Lannister and Mace Tyrell.[18]\n\nFor his services to Joffrey, Lancel is named the new Lord of Darry in the riverlands.[19] Cersei believes this is a sop by Tywin to Ser Kevan Lannister, his brother and Lancel's father.[20] It is feared that Lancel will lose his arm or even his life.[19]\n\nLancel suffers from an ulcerating wound which does not heal.[21] Kevan tells Tyrion that Lancel has praised Tyrion's efforts at the Blackwater, and that Cersei has been visiting his son's sickbed to pray for him.[22] Tywin considers wedding Lancel to Sansa, but Kevan does not feel Lancel would be healthy enough to consummate the marriage.[22] Tywin instead arranges for the girl to wed Tyrion.[23] With Lancel wounded and Martyn a prisoner of Robb Stark, Kevan becomes overcome with grief after Lord Rickard Karstark murders his third son, Willem Lannister.[21]\n\nAfter the Red Wedding, Tywin tells Tyrion that Lancel must marry a girl from House Frey according to his alliance with Lord Walder Frey.[24]\n\nKevan brings Lancel from his sickbed to attend the wedding feast of King Joffrey and Margaery Tyrell. The thin Lancel is now ghastly looking, with white and brittle hair. Sansa praises Lancel's valor and strength, causing Lancel and Kevan to both beam. Father and son have seats of honor near the Iron Throne. Joffrey chokes to death during the feast, and Cersei accuses Tyrion of murder.[25]\n\nLord Petyr Baelish informs Sansa that he sent the Kettleblack brothers to King's Landing so they could be found by Bronn and Lancel.[26]\n\nAfter Jaime frees Tyrion from the black cells to avoid execution for Joffrey's death, Tyrion tells his brother that their sister Cersei has been sleeping with various men, including Lancel. Tyrion kills their father, Lord Tywin, during his escape.[27]\n\nMaester Ballabar helps treat Lancel as he recovers. A grey-faced Lancel attends the funeral of his uncle, Lord Tywin. Lancel tells Cersei that the High Septon prayed with him to help his recovery, and Lancel develops a new-found piety to the Faith of the Seven. Worried that Lancel might reveal her secrets, Cersei suggests that Lancel pray silently.[20] Lancel attends the wedding of King Tommen and Margaery.[28] It is rumored in King's Landing that Lancel's wounds have made him unable to reproduce.[6] The High Septon dies in his sleep;[29] unbeknownst to Lancel, Cersei has had the religious leader assassinated by Ser Osney Kettleblack.[30]\n\nSer Harwyn Plumm clears out broken men from Darry.[28] Jaime, bothered by Tyrion's claim that Cersei slept with Lancel, insults his cousin when Lancel departs King's Landing for Darry with his father and two septons.[31] Lancel quarters the lion of House Lannister with the plowman of House Darry on the arms of House Lannister of Darry.[6] Lancel weds Amerei Frey, but they do not consummate the marriage.[6]\n\nLancel is ambivalent as to rumors of the promiscuity of his new wife. Instead of his bedchamber, Lancel sleeps in the castle's sept. He commands his retainers to never disturb him during his prayers. The young lord is guarded by sparrows and Poor Fellows. Kevan departs Darry after quarreling with his son.[6]\n\nLancel prays in the sept instead of attending the welcoming feast when Jaime arrives at Darry. Jaime finds the barefoot Lancel looking like a beggar in his roughspun tunic and hair shirt. Lancel has shaved the crown of his head and has attempted to grow a beard. The fasting Lancel claims he receives visions from the Seven each night, and that he dreamed of being killed by Jaime after admitting to his sins. Lancel admits to having supplied King Robert with the strongwine and to having slept with Cersei, whom he loved. The young lord also says he had confessed his sins to the late High Septon. Lancel explains he is joining the High Sparrow and the Warrior's Sons, and that Harwyn can have Darry and Amerei after he renounces them. Jaime refuses his cousin's repeated requests to pray together.[6]\n\nWhen Jaime arrives at the siege of Riverrun, Ser Daven Lannister is shocked to hear of their cousin's decisions, while Genna Lannister is not surprised.[32]\n\nCersei sees Lancel among the Warrior's Sons in the capital.[30]\n\nLancel is one of Cersei's accusers after she is arrested by the Faith. The imprisoned queen admits to the High Sparrow that she slept with Lancel, but she denies having conspired with Lancel to kill King Robert.[33] Under the command of Ser Theodan the True, Lancel makes up part of Cersei's escort in her walk of atonement.[34]\n\nKevan Lannister, the Lord Regent for King Tommen, considers naming his son Lancel to the Kingsguard. Kevan is assassinated by Varys, however.[35]\n\nLancel may be a reference by George R. R. Martin to Lancelot, one of the Knights of the Round Table who had an adulterous affair with Queen Guinevere.  Martin is a keen reader of the Matter of Britain.[37]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nA handsome and strong youth, Lancel has the thick sandy hair and green eyes of House Lannister.
