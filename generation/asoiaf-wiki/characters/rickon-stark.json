  "content": "Rickon Stark is Eddard and Catelyn's youngest child, only three years old when the series begins. Rickon is a naturally aggressive and strong-willed child, but his youth makes it difficult for him to cope with the terrible changes that come to his family and life.  He is usually accompanied by his direwolf, Shaggydog.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Rickon is portrayed by Art Parkinson.[4]\n\nRickon favors his mother Catelyn in appearance, having the bright blue eyes, auburn hair, and easy smile of a Tully.[5][6][7]\n\nYoung Rickon is playful, but temperamental and stubborn.[8][9] He has breathless laughter[10] and fiercely tries to be like his older brothers.[11] Rickon's family often thinks of him as a baby.[12][13][14]\n\nRickon wears an ermine mantle.[15] His bedchamber is half a turn below Bran's in a tower at Winterfell.[16]\n\nBorn at Winterfell in 295 AC, Rickon is the third son and youngest child of Catelyn and Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell. Maester Luwin helped deliver the child.[17] Rickon's brothers are Robb and Bran, while his sisters are Sansa and Arya. Rickon also has a bastard half-brother, Jon Snow, from whom Rickon begs sweets.[7]\n\nLord Eddard Stark allows his children to adopt a litter of direwolves found by Jon Snow.[18] Rickon is initially afraid of his pup,[19] which he eventually names Shaggydog.[20] At the feast welcoming King Robert I Baratheon to Winterfell, Jon prods his half brother on when Rickon stops to visit him during the procession.[21]\n\nWhen Eddard departs for King's Landing to serve Robert as Hand of the King, he leaves his youngest son at Winterfell with the boy's mother, Catelyn Stark, and eldest brother, Robb.[17] Bran Stark was supposed to join his sisters, Sansa and Arya, with Eddard in the capital, but Rickon's older brother becomes comatose after falling from the First Keep.[20]\n\nA grief-stricken Catelyn lingers at Bran's bedside, so Rickon follows Robb around, crying. After Bran wakes from his coma, Catelyn departs Winterfell to inform Eddard of the catspaw assassin, leaving Robb to rule the castle.[6] Rickon enjoys running with Shaggydog, Grey Wind, and Summer—the direwolves of Robb and Bran—in the castle's yard.[8] Rickon becomes upset whenever Robb departs Winterfell to address matters in the north.[8] When the direwolves threaten Tyrion Lannister, Rickon calls Shaggy back to him.[8]\n\nHaving learned that Robb is marching south to rescue their father from imprisonment in King's Landing, an upset Rickon hides in the crypt of Winterfell. Rickon slashes at Robb's men with a rusty sword, and Shaggydog wounds Gage and Mikken. Rickon cries even more when Shaggy is chained in Farlen's kennel, and the boy refuses to bid farewell when Robb departs Winterfell.[22]\n\nBran has a dream of Eddard in the crypt, so Osha and Maester Luwin bring the boy to the vaults so he can see that his father's tomb is empty. Shaggydog jumps out of the shadows and wounds Luwin, however, and Summer begins fighting with Shaggy. Four-year-old Rickon, who had freed Shaggy from the kennel, explains that he had also dreamed that Eddard would be coming home. Rickon accompanies the group to Luwin's tower, and the maester shows obsidian arrowheads to the boys. Rickon cries when a raven then arrives at the tower bringing word that Eddard has been executed by order of King Joffrey I Baratheon in the capital.[23]\n\nAfter the Battle of the Camps, Robb is proclaimed King in the North at Riverrun by northmen and rivermen,[24] and his brothers become princes.[25]\n\nRickon is initially upset when Big Walder and Little Walder Frey arrive at Winterfell as wards, according to the alliance between Houses Stark and Frey.[26] When Little Walder knocks the Rickon into a pool while playing lord of the crossing, Shaggydog bites him. Ser Rodrik Cassel, the castellan of Winterfell, confines Shaggydog and Summer, both direwolves at Winterfell, to the godswood.[26]\n\nRickon then becomes friends with the Frey cousins, playing other games like monsters and maidens, rats and cats, and come-into-my-castle. Bran is angered when his brother shows the crypt of Winterfell to their guests.[26] Rickon sits near the Freys during the harvest feast.[15]\n\nWith his mother Catelyn away in the south, Rickon refuses to have his hair cut, and instead bites a girl who tries to cut his long, unruly hair.[15] Maester Luwin discounts the dreams which Bran and Rickon experienced before Winterfell was informed of Lord Eddard's death,[27] while Jojen Reed explains he has had green dreams of the Stark brothers in the crypt[9] and also of the boys being flayed by Reek.[9]\n\nTheon Greyjoy and his ironborn raiders capture Winterfell. Rickon, Bran, and the Reed siblings become his hostages. Meera Reed protects Rickon when Stygg kills Mikken.[28] After Osha, Hodor, the direwolves, and the Reed and Stark siblings vanish from the castle, Theon and Reek hunt for them in the wolfswood to no avail.[16] The hunters instead kill two miller's sons at the Acorn Water; Reek flays the children's bodies, and Theon presents their tarred heads to Winterfell as those of the missing Starks.[29]\n\nIn King's Landing, Varys receives word of Bran and Rickon's murder, and informs acting Hand of the King Tyrion Lannister, who informs his sister, Queen Cersei. Both fear that Catelyn Stark will kill Robb's hostage, their brother Jaime, in revenge. Cersei notes that they still hold their own hostage, Sansa Stark, and Tyrion reminds her that they must take good care of her.[30]\n\nAt Riverrun, Catelyn receives word of Bran and Rickon's murder, and decides to free Jaime Lannister to exchange for her daughters.[11][31][32] During the Battle of the Blackwater, Sansa Stark sings a prayer for her siblings.[33] At Harrenhal, Arya Stark becomes teary-eyed after learning of her brothers' fate.[34]\n\nIn actuality, Rickon and his companions have secretly hidden from Theon in the crypts, and they survive the sack of Winterfell by Reek, who is actually Ramsay Snow.[35][1] The group emerges from the crypts to find Winterfell in ruins. In the godswood, they discover a mortally wounded Maester Luwin, who tells them that Bran and Rickon need to be separated and taken into hiding. Osha agrees to look after Rickon, taking the prince and Shaggydog to parts unknown.[1]\n\nTraveling north toward the Wall, Bran Stark wonders if Osha took his brother to White Harbor or the Last Hearth.[36]\n\nRobb Stark, the King in the North, sleeps with Jeyne Westerling at the Crag after having been informed of his brothers' supposed deaths. Robb then marries Jeyne, breaking his promise to marry a daughter of Lord Walder Frey.[37]\n\nAfter Lord Hoster Tully dies at Riverrun, Catelyn thinks her father will be awaited in the afterlife by his grandsons, Bran and Rickon.[38]\n\nWhen Jon Snow returns to Castle Black after the great ranging and spying on a group of free folk, Maester Aemon informs him of his brothers' murders and of the burning of Winterfell. Jon cannot quite believe Theon would do that.[39]\n\nSansa, expecting to marry Willas Tyrell, hopes to one day name sons after Rickon, Bran, and Eddard.[40] However, Lord Tywin Lannister forces her to marry Tyrion Lannister,[41][42] so that House Lannister can one day claim Winterfell.[38] To prevent that possibility, King Robb names his half brother Jon as his heir.[43][44] Robb and Catelyn are then murdered by Freys and Boltons in the Red Wedding.[45]\n\nMost of Westeros believes Rickon dead, but Lord Wyman Manderly and Robett Glover learn from Wex Pyke, Theon's onetime squire and a survivor of the sack of Winterfell, that the boy is alive. Wex tells them—via writing and chalk drawings since he is mute—that Ramsay killed Rodrik Cassel, not Theon, in the battle at Winterfell, and that Wex followed a boy, a woman, and a direwolf after they left the castle.[46] Wex learned that Osha was taking Rickon to Skagos.[47]\n\nWhen Lord Davos Seaworth attempts to convince Lord Manderly to take up Stannis Baratheon's cause, Wyman brings Wex into their meeting in the New Castle and explains to Davos what Wex witnessed. Wyman explains that in order for House Manderly to accept Stannis as king, Davos must use his smuggling skills to retrieve Wyman's liege lord from Skagos—Rickon, the heir of House Stark with Robb dead and Bran's fate unknown.[46]\n\nRamsay, who is now Lord of Winterfell,[48] tells his father, Roose Bolton, that he intends to kill Bran and Rickon with his hounds if the Stark boys reappear.[49]\n\nTheon, who has been tortured by Ramsay, is hated and considered a kinslayer for his alleged murder of Bran and Rickon.[50][51] Theon has a difficult time remembering what really happened,[49] but eventually recalls more clearly.[50]\n\nNorthmen in Stannis's army at the crofters' village want the king to execute Theon for having killed Bran and Rickon. Theon incoherently tries to explain his true actions to his sister, Asha Greyjoy.[52]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nRickon favors his mother Catelyn in appearance, having the bright blue eyes, auburn hair, and easy smile of a Tully.[5][6][7]\n\nYoung Rickon is playful, but temperamental and stubborn.[8][9] He has breathless laughter[10] and fiercely tries to be like his older brothers.[11] Rickon's family often thinks of him as a baby.[12][13][14]\n\nRickon wears an ermine mantle.[15] His bedchamber is half a turn below Bran's in a tower at Winterfell.[16]\n\n\n## History\n\n\nBorn at Winterfell in 295 AC, Rickon is the third son and youngest child of Catelyn and Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell.
