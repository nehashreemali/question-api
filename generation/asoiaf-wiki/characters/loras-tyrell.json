  "content": "Loras Tyrell, also known as the Knight of Flowers,[3] is a knight from House Tyrell and the third son of Lord Mace Tyrell of Highgarden and his wife, Lady Alerie Hightower. He is a highly skilled knight and jouster. His tournament successes, dazzling good looks, and ostentatious showmanship has made him a celebrated figure in the courts of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nHis personal coat of arms is three golden roses on a field of green, indicating his position as a third son.[9][10]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Loras is portrayed by Finn Jones.\n\nLoras is exceptionally handsome.[1][10] His hair is a mass of lazy brown curls[1] and ringlets[11] which tumble over his eyes,[12] which have been described as brown,[13] liquid gold,[1] big,[11] and intelligent and lively.[10] Tyrion Lannister thinks Loras is beautiful and already a legend, and that half the girls in the Seven Kingdoms want to bed him and all the boys want to be him.[14] Sansa Stark also thinks Loras is beautiful, and that he is lithe and graceful with wonderful eyes.[15]\n\nLoras is beloved by the smallfolk, especially women. While courteous he is still thirsty for glory and can be short-tempered and impetuous. Tyrion finds him a prickly lad.[14] According to a semi-canon source, Loras is homosexual,[16] and his father, Mace, and grandmother, Olenna, are aware of his sexuality.[17] Loras is Mace's favorite son.[18]\n\nDespite his youth and slender frame, Loras is a capable warrior, using axes, lances, morningstars, and swords to deadly effect.[10][19] According to George R. R. Martin, a case can be made that Loras is the greatest active swordsman in Westeros.[20] When asked about the strongest fighters, he again mentions Loras.[21] Loras's silver armor, which is decorated with sapphires and twining black vines,[22] was made by Tobho Mott.[23] He also uses silver mail and a green shield.[10] Golden roses decorate the crest of his helm.[10] Loras wears a cloak of forget-me-nots sewn to a heavy woolen cape.[22] His horses include a speedy grey mare[22] and a tall white stallion.[10]\n\nLoras was born at Highgarden[7] in 282 AC.[6] He has two older brothers, Willas and Ser Garlan, and one younger sister, Margaery.\n\nLoras squired for Lord Renly Baratheon at Storm's End,[13][24] and grew close to him. According to a semi-canon source, he soon became Renly's lover.[7] At the young age of fifteen, Loras received his knighthood.[25]\n\nLoras purchased his armor from Tobho Mott's shop in the Street of Steel in King's Landing.[23] During the tourney on Prince Joffrey's name day in 298 AC, at the age of fifteen, Loras defeated Ser Hosteen Frey[3] and Ser Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard in the joust.[26] Renly's brother, King Robert I Baratheon, won a Valyrian steel dagger from Loras's victory.[27]\n\nSer Loras participates in the Hand's tourney, wearing armor wrought with jeweled flowers and a cape of woven roses. Amongst his victories are Ser Robar Royce and three members of the Kingsguard. With each victory, he hands a white rose to a pretty girl in the crowd. He then hands a red rose to Sansa Stark, who is overwhelmed by his gallantry and is thereafter infatuated with him.[1] Although reputed to be gallant, Loras rides a mare in heat against Ser Gregor Clegane, noted as an underhanded tactic by some. This inflames the huge knight's stallion, which bucks him, prompting Gregor to attack Loras. After Sandor Clegane comes to his rescue, Loras forfeits the final round to the Hound.[1]\n\nLord Renly Baratheon and Loras secretly plot to have Renly's eldest brother, King Robert I Baratheon, spurn Queen Cersei Lannister in favor of Loras's sister, Margaery.[28] Renly approaches Lord Eddard Stark with a painting of the girl in hopes that she resembles Eddard's late sister, Lyanna, but this is not the case.[23]\n\nWhen Eddard, sitting the Iron Throne in Robert's stead as the Hand of the King, sends a party led by Lord Beric Dondarrion to capture or kill Gregor Clegane, Loras is disappointed at not having been chosen instead of Beric.[29]\n\nLoras is mentioned by Lord Petyr Baelish as a possible ally for Lord Stark against Cersei in the succession crisis after Robert's death, but Ned decides it is the City Watch he must have. When Renly flees King's Landing after Lord Stark spurns his request for aid in seizing power, Loras rides south out of the city with him, along with fifty retainers. Lord Varys suspects they ride for either Storm's End or Highgarden.[30] After Joffrey Baratheon is crowned in the power struggle they fled from, both Loras and Renly are named among the nobles he demands must swear fealty to him or stand accused of treason.[31]\n\nRenly weds Margaery at Highgarden and claims the throne with the support of Lord Mace Tyrell and his sons.[32]\n\nSer Loras's father, Lord Mace Tyrell, serves as Hand to Renly Baratheon.[5] Their army gathers at Highgarden, and Renly makes Loras the head of his Rainbow Guard, an ostentatious version of the traditional Kingsguard. The two remain inseparable even after Renly's wedding. During his march, Renly holds a great melee at Bitterbridge of one hundred sixteen knights. Wielding a longaxe, Loras is one of the final two combatants and Renly cheers for him, but he loses to Brienne of Tarth, who is given the last place in his Rainbow Guard.[10]\n\nAfter his failed parley with his elder brother, Stannis, at Storm's End, Renly appoints Loras to lead the vanguard in the coming battle, choosing him over Lord Randyll Tarly, Ser Guyard Morrigen, and many other candidates.[33] When the bannermen leave Renly's pavilion, the king asks Loras to stay and help him pray.[34] Later, after Renly's death at the hands of a shadow assassin,[34] Loras goes berserk, killing Ser Emmon Cuy and Ser Robar Royce, the two Rainbow Guards who were outside the king's tent when he was slain, as well as another guard.[35] Loras later admits to Jaime Lannister that he concluded that since they had done nothing to stop Renly's death, and let the culprit escape, they must have aided the murder willingly.[13]\n\nWith Renly dead, King Joffrey's small council expects Loras to return to Margaery at Bitterbridge. Lord Petyr Baelish is dispatched to Bitterbridge to seek an alliance.[35] Stannis sends Ser Parmen Crane and Ser Erren Florent to recruit Renly's infantry at Bitterbridge,[36] but they are captured by the Tyrells.[37]\n\nPetyr travels to Bitterbridge and then Highgarden, where he negotiates an alliance between the Tyrells and Baratheons.[38] Meanwhile, riders from Bitterbridge inform Lord Tywin Lannister, who rendezvouses with Mace's army.[39] Loras participates in the defeat of Stannis by the Lannisters and Tyrells in the Battle of the Blackwater.[40] Afterward, Joffrey agrees to wed Renly's widow, Margaery, and Loras is granted a place in the Kingsguard.[40]\n\nSer Loras joins the Kingsguard at the behest of his father, Lord Mace, to protect his sister, Margaery, when she becomes queen.[41] The appointment also allows Loras to avoid marriage, a prospect complicated by his ambiguous sexuality, and his continued mourning for Renly. Loras quickly becomes popular with the citizens of King's Landing. When Tyrion asks him why he chose to join the Kingsguard at only seventeen, Loras explains that he is a third son and that \"When the sun has set, no candle can replace it\".[14]\n\nSansa Stark thinks Loras looks even finer in the white of the Kingsguard than in the greens and golds of House Tyrell. The only spot of color on him now is a brooch that clasps his cloak, the rose of Highgarden wrought in soft yellow gold, nestled in a bed of delicate green jade leaves. The grip of his sword is white leather and its pommel is a rose in alabaster.[15] During her wedding celebrations with Tyrion Lannister, Sansa is asked to dance by Loras's brother, Ser Garlan. Although Sansa is unhappy to marry the Imp, Garlan tells her Tyrion would be a better husband than Loras.[42]\n\nLoras attends the wedding of King Joffrey and his sister, Margaery Tyrell. After Joffrey dies from poison during his wedding feast, Queen Cersei Lannister orders the Kingsguard to arrest Tyrion.[43]\n\nWhen Ser Jaime Lannister, absentee Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, returns to the King's Landing, Loras recognizes Brienne of Tarth among his companions and confronts her immediately about Renly's mysterious death. At his request, Jaime has Brienne arrested.[44] During the Kingsguard meeting in the White Sword Tower, Loras blames Sansa, who has disappeared from the capital, for Joffrey's poisoning.[13] Loras reveals to Jaime that his brother, Garlan the Gallant, wore Renly's famous armor and impersonated the fallen king at the Battle of the Blackwater, since Renly's armor was too large to fit Loras.[13] Loras also reveals he buried Renly in a place they knew from when he was a squire at Storm's End. Loras agrees to question and judge Brienne fairly.[13] Loras confronts Brienne and becomes more accepting of her innocence in the death of Renly.[45] Loras laughs during the trial of Tyrion.[46]\n\nAt the Fingers, Petyr Baelish tells Sansa that during his negotiations with the Tyrells at Highgarden, he planted the idea of Loras joining the Kingsguard.[38]\n\nSer Loras stands vigil with Ser Jaime over the corpse of Lord Tywin Lannister.[47] Jaime later notices Loras skillfully training and tries to educate the youth about historical members of the Kingsguard.[47] Cersei objects to Loras's offer to train young King Tommen I Baratheon in the ways of an armed knight.[24] When Jaime departs to bring order to the riverlands, he wants Loras to command in his stead in King's Landing, which upsets Cersei.[48] King Tommen is impressed with Loras's actions and demeanor, and the knight spends much of his time with his sister, Queen Margaery.[49]\n\nAfter the taking of the Shields by the ironborn, Cersei refuses to allow the Redwyne fleet to depart the siege of Dragonstone and deal with Euron Greyjoy, King of the Isles and the North. Loras volunteers to take command and hasten the siege.[50] Three thousand smallfolk, mostly women, see Loras off when he sails to Dragonstone aboard the new dromonds of the grand admiral, Lord Aurane Waters.[51]\n\nAurane tells Cersei that Loras has taken Dragonstone. After Stannis's castellan, Ser Rolland Storm, declined Loras's offer of single combat, Loras led the assault on the castle. The reported victory is said to have been needlessly bloodthirsty and true to Cersei's hopes, it is reported that Loras was horribly injured by quarrels, maces, and boiling oil in the battle.[51]\n\nSer Loras is reportedly gravely injured at Dragonstone. The last report that the imprisoned Cersei received was that he had been dying of his wounds received whilst taking the castle.[52] Lord Mace Tyrell tells Ser Kevan Lannister, King Tommen's Lord Regent, that his son's men searched Dragonstone and did not find gold, gemstones, or dragon eggs.[53]\n\nAccording to George R. R. Martin, Loras is partially inspired by Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall.[55] According to Dark Sword Miniatures, Martin has said that Loras looks like \"a young 1970’s teen idol – all pretty and with nice hair.\"[56]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nLoras is exceptionally handsome.[1][10] His hair is a mass of lazy brown curls[1] and ringlets[11] which tumble over his eyes,[12] which have been described as brown,[13] liquid gold,[1] big,[11] and intelligent and lively.[10] Tyrion Lannister thinks Loras is beautiful and already a legend, and that half the girls in the Seven Kingdoms want to bed him and all the boys want to be him.[14] Sansa Stark also thinks Loras is beautiful, and that he is lithe and graceful with wonderful eyes.[15]\n\nLoras is beloved by the smallfolk, especially women.
