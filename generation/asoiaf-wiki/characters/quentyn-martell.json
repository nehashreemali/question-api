  "content": "Prince Quentyn Nymeros Martell, better known simply as Quentyn Martell, is a knight from House Martell. He is the second child and eldest son of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, and Lady Mellario of Norvos.\n\nQuentyn looks like his father, Doran.[9] Quentyn is short-legged and stocky, thickly built, with a plain square face,[3] brown hair,[5][1] brown eyes, and stubble on his cheeks.[10] He has a high forehead, broad nose, and square jaw.[1][10] He does not smile easily.[1]\n\nQuentyn is earnest, well-behaved,[9] sensible, and dutiful,[5] but solemn and not handsome.[10][3] He is cautious by nature[1] and filled with doubts, fears, and insecurities.[2][1][11] Quentyn does not want to be remembered as a failure, and cannot bear the thought of his father's disappointment,[4][5][1] nor does he want friends to die for nothing.[4]\n\nFostered at Yronwood, Quentyn came to see Cletus Yronwood, his dearest friend, as a brother in all but blood,[1] and Cletus's father, Lord Anders, as a second father.[4] Quentyn's elder sister, Princess Arianne Martell, has resented him for years under the belief that Doran intends to name Quentyn as heir to Dorne.[9]\n\nQuentyn speaks the Volantene[1] and Ghiscari tongues.[5][11] While he can read and write High Valyrian, he has had little practice in speaking it.[1] A virgin,[11] Quentyn is uncomfortable around girls.[3][1]\n\nQuentyn was born the second child of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, and his wife, Lady Mellario of Norvos.[12] At a young age, Quentyn was sent to be fostered by Anders Yronwood, Lord of Yronwood, whom he served as a page and later squire.[13] Quentyn was fostered at Yronwood to repair the relationship between Houses Martell and Yronwood, which had been damaged by a duel between Quentyn’s uncle, Prince Oberyn Martell, and Lord Edgar Yronwood, more than a decade before. Edgar and Oberyn had both taken cuts during this duel, but while Oberyn recovered, Edgar's wounds festered and he eventually died. This led to whispers that Oberyn had fought with a poisoned blade,[14] so sending Quentyn to Yronwood was to settle this blood debt.[15] Mellario felt Quentyn was too young to be sent away, however, and the boy's fosterage was one of the strains on his parents' marriage.[15]\n\nWhen Quentyn first arrived at Yronwood, he was smitten with Lord Anders's eldest daughter, Ynys. His crush lasted until the day she wed Ryon Allyrion and left Yronwood. Quentyn received his first kiss from one of the Drinkwater twins, though he never knew which one.[1]\n\nAbout 290 AC, Prince Doran wrote a letter in which he instructed his son to do all required of him by the maester and master-at-arms at Yronwood, as Quentyn would one day rule Dorne, and he therefore needed to be strong of both mind and body.[13] Quentyn's elder sister, Princess Arianne Martell, then fourteen years old, secretly discovered the letter while it was still being written, however. Arianne is Doran's heir by Dornish custom, and she has since resented Quentyn under the belief that Doran intends to be succeeded by her younger brother.[13] Arianne is unaware, however, that the Prince of Dorne had negotiated a secret marriage pact by which Arianne is to wed the exiled Viserys Targaryen and Quentyn would instead become the successor to Dorne.[16]\n\nAt Yronwood, Quentyn befriended Anders's eldest son, Cletus, Cletus's cousin Archibald, Gerris Drinkwater, and Willam Wells.[1]\n\nQuentyn received his knighthood at the age of eighteen,[17] from Lord Anders Yronwood, after turning down the same offer made by his uncle, Prince Oberyn.[13]\n\nQuentyn has been riding horses since he was six,[11] and has been trained with spear and sword and shield since he was old enough to walk.[2] Amongst the people in Dorne, Quentyn is little known.[15]\n\nAfter Joffrey I Baratheon has been crowned king, Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, and his sons are among those commanded to present themselves at court in King's Landing to swear fealty to the Iron Throne.[18]\n\nQuentyn is among those Lord Tywin Lannister, Joffrey's Hand of the King, considers as a possible candidate in marriage for his daughter, the widowed Queen Cersei Lannister.[19]\n\nQuentyn is believed to be in the Boneway with the host of Anders Yronwood, Lord of Yronwood. However, in truth, Quentyn has crossed the narrow sea in secret.[13] His sister, Princess Arianne Martell, erroneously believes Quentyn is recruiting the Golden Company to displace her as heir of Dorne, with the approval of their father, Doran.[13][15]\n\nAfter Arianne's coup to crown Princess Myrcella Baratheon fails,[15] she is arrested and confined at Sunspear for several weeks.[16] When she confronts her father, Arianne reveals that she is aware that Quentyn traveled across the narrow sea, and that Prince Doran had considered Quentyn his heir. Doran then tells Arianne the truth about a secret marriage pact, and reveals what Quentyn has been sent east for.[16]\n\nQuentyn has been sent by his father Doran, Prince of Dorne, to bring Daenerys Targaryen, Queen of Meereen, to Dorne. Quentyn's party includes Ser Gerris Drinkwater, Ser Willam Wells, the cousins Ser Cletus and Ser Archibald Yronwood, and Maester Kedry. They sail from the Planky Town across the narrow sea to Lys, where Quentyn reluctantly plays the role of a merchant.[1] They change ships in Lys, boarding the Meadowlark. When the Meadowlark is boarded by corsairs near the Disputed Lands, however, Willam, Cletus, and Kedry are slain.[1]\n\nQuentyn and his remaining companions, Gerris and Archibald, spend more time in Volantis than they had expected, due to the Targaryen campaign in Slaver's Bay, attempting to find a ship willing to bring them to Meereen. Gerris pretends to be a wine merchant looking for a ship to take him and his two \"servants\" to Meereen, but every captain they try to convince to take them on this journey refuses, and in the end they are forced to consider seeking passage on the smuggler's ship Adventure.[1] While the war between Astapor and Yunkai has not yet reached Meereen, no trade ships are leaving for the city as the fighting pits are closed and the slave trade has been banned.[20][1]\n\nIn Dorne, Prince Doran tells his daughter, Princess Arianne Martell, that he has heard how a great fleet, mostly Volantene ships, has set sail from Lys, and that there had been talk about elephants. Believing that it might be Daenerys, Doran states that, if Quentyn is with her, he will bring her up to the Greenblood if he can.[21] In truth, however, the Golden Company has set sail from Volantis for their landing in the stormlands.[22][23]\n\nEventually, Quentyn and his two companions join the Windblown, a mercenary company hired by Yunkai, as a way to reach Daenerys from Volantis.[1][2] Quentyn is given the nickname \"Frog\" by the other sellswords, and he acts as the squire to Archibald, who is called \"Greenguts\".[22]\n\nThe three disguised Dornishmen fight alongside the Windblown during the siege of Astapor. Quentyn, Gerris and Archibald plan to desert once they are north of Yunkai, but the Tattered Prince orders them and other Westerosi from the company to defect to Daenerys's side. The Tattered Prince wants to make sure that, should the tide turn, he will be still on the winning side.[2] The feigned Windblown turncloaks are eventually found by the Stormcrows, and Daario Naharis brings them to Meereen,[24] where Quentyn dresses plainly.[3]\n\nDaario brings the feigned turncloaks to Queen Daenerys in her audience chamber and presents them as recruits of his Stormcrows. Quentyn and his friends reveal that they are knights, but ask for privacy in order to reveal their names. After the court is cleared, Quentyn hands over his \"gift\", a parchment containing a secret pact, signed by Ser Willem Darry and Prince Oberyn Martell, with the Sealord of Braavos witnessing the signatures. The pact was for Viserys Targaryen to wed Quentyn's sister, Arianne, in return for Dorne's support in helping the exile regain the Iron Throne. With Viserys having died at Vaes Dothrak, however, Quentyn now offers himself as a husband for Daenerys in return for the support of Dorne. Daario mocks Quentyn, angering his companions. Daenerys orders Quentyn and his friends to be treated courteously, and reveals her upcoming marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq. She gives the Dornishmen a room in the Great Pyramid.[10] While Ser Barristan Selmy, Lord Commander of the Queensguard, believes Quentyn's arrival changes everything, Daenerys disagrees, and she wonders about Quaithe's prophecy and the \"sun's son\".[10]\n\nQuentyn approaches Daenerys the next day, the day of her wedding, wondering if he has displeased her. Daenerys tells Quentyn that one day, she will come to Westeros and look to Dorne for help.[10] Quentyn reveals to Daenerys and her court that the other Windblown who had joined the Stormcrows had done so under false pretenses, and the feigned turncloaks are arrested.[3]\n\nQuentyn and his companions are present at the feast held to celebrate the signing of the peace between Meereen and Yunkai. Queen Daenerys invites him to meet Rhaegal and Viserion. The dragons frighten Quentyn, but nonetheless he tells Daenerys about his own Targaryen blood. Daenerys tells him that he does not belong in Meereen, and urges him to return home, as her court is not a safe place for him. Quentyn refuses, and tells Daenerys about her namesake during their journey back up the pyramid.[3]\n\nQuentyn tries to speak with Daenerys on the day Daznak's Pit is opened, but is denied an audience. He is in attendance when Daenerys disappears from Daznak's Pit atop Drogon,[25] and is later present when King Hizdahr is presented with Captain Groleo's head. Barristan questions Quentyn about his possible involvement in the food which poisoned Belwas, but soon concludes that Quentyn is innocent. With Daenerys gone, Barristan advises the three Dornishmen to return home and forget about the pact, but Quentyn declines, stating that he cannot return to Dorne empty handed.[5]\n\nQuentyn's companions are keen to return to Dorne, but the prince plans to tame at least one of Daenerys's dragons due to his Targaryen ancestry. He arranges a meeting with the Tattered Prince, hiring the Windblown's help in seizing Rhaegal and Viserion. The Tattered Prince agrees, asking for Pentos in return. Quentyn signs an agreement.[4]\n\nDressed as Brazen Beasts, Quentyn and his companions go to the pit where the dragons are kept. The Tattered Prince had given them the code word of \"dog\" to be used by the Brazen Beasts that day, but with Barristan's coup occurring at the same time, the Brazen Beasts guarding the door are not aware of the code word. Gaining access to the dragons, Quentyn eventually attempts to tame Viserion, but Rhaegal bathes Quentyn from behind with dragonfire. The Windblown mercenaries flee, and both dragons escape.[11]\n\nMissandei takes care of Quentyn, but he dies in Daenerys's bed three days later, covered in burns. Upon seeing the extent of the prince's injuries, Barristan, Hand of the Queen in Daenerys's absence, thinks it would have been better if Rhaegal had just eaten him alive, as his death would haven been quicker and less painful in such a case.[6] The imprisoned Archibald and Gerris claim Quentyn's actions were done for love of Daenerys, but Barristan insists they were done out of duty for Dorne. The surviving Dornish knights agree to act as Barristan's envoys to the Tattered Prince.[6]\n\nOn her way to Griffin's Roost, Princess Arianne Martell wonders about Quentyn's whereabouts if he does not turn out to be with Jon Connington. She wonders if he has wed Daenerys Targaryen.[9] Once at Griffin's Roost, her sworn shield, Ser Daemon Sand, states that they now know her brother is not at Storm's End.[26]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nQuentyn looks like his father, Doran.[9] Quentyn is short-legged and stocky, thickly built, with a plain square face,[3] brown hair,[5][1] brown eyes, and stubble on his cheeks.[10] He has a high forehead, broad nose, and square jaw.[1][10] He does not smile easily.[1]\n\nQuentyn is earnest, well-behaved,[9] sensible, and dutiful,[5] but solemn and not handsome.[10][3] He is cautious by nature[1] and filled with doubts, fears, and insecurities.[2][1][11] Quentyn does not want to be remembered as a failure, and cannot bear the thought of his father's disappointment,[4][5][1] nor does he want friends to die for nothing.[4]\n\nFostered at Yronwood, Quentyn came to see Cletus Yronwood, his dearest friend, as a brother in all but blood,[1] and Cletus's father, Lord Anders, as a second father.[4] Quentyn's elder sister, Princess Arianne Martell, has resented him for years under the belief that Doran intends to name Quentyn as heir to Dorne.[9]\n\nQuentyn speaks the Volantene[1] and Ghiscari tongues.[5][11] While he can read and write High Valyrian, he has had little practice in speaking it.[1] A virgin,[11] Quentyn is uncomfortable around girls.[3][1]\n\n\n## History\n\n\nQuentyn was born the second child of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, and his wife, Lady Mellario of Norvos.[12] At a young age, Quentyn was sent to be fostered by Anders Yronwood, Lord of Yronwood, whom he served as a page and later squire.[13] Quentyn was fostered at Yronwood to repair the relationship between Houses Martell and Yronwood, which had been damaged by a duel between Quentyn’s uncle, Prince Oberyn Martell, and Lord Edgar Yronwood, more than a decade before.
