  "content": "Victarion Greyjoy is a member of House Greyjoy and is a younger brother of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands. Victarion is the Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet,[4] and his flagship is the Iron Victory.\n\nVictarion is a large and powerful man, with a bull's broad chest,[3] a boy's flat stomach,[3] and huge hands.[5] His hair is flecked with grey.[3] Theon Greyjoy considers his uncle to be an old man.[6] Victarion is less handsome than his brother Euron.[3]\n\nVictarion is a follower of the Drowned God,[7] and Aeron Greyjoy considers Victarion to be more godly than their despised elder brother, Euron Crow's Eye.[8] Victarion is a capable commander and a fierce warrior in battle, but he has a calm demeanor outside of it, thinking of enemies who show bravery with great respect.[9] He is willing to wear plate armor while sailing because he has no fear of drowning.[7] Victarion loves the ships of the Iron Fleet,[3] and he always wants wine after a battle.[7]\n\nThe Lord Captain wears heavy grey chain mail over boiled black leather.[3] When preparing for combat, Victarion also wears heavy plate.[10] He wears padded gloves underneath his iron gauntlets of lobstered steel plate.[7] Victarion's tall black warhelm is decorated with an iron kraken, whose tentacles coil down below his jaw.[3] He carries a longsword and a dirk,[3] but prefers to use his fearsome steel axe[5] with a shield.[7] Victarion's cloak is made of nine layers of gold cloth sewn like the kraken of his House, and its arms reach his boots.[3]\n\nVictarion dislikes laughter, fearing that it means he is being made fun of by others, and the realization of mockery angers him.[11] Theon and Asha Greyjoy consider their uncle to be a grey bullock, with Theon recalling Victarion as dutiful but unambitious and Asha finding him dim.[12] According to George R. R. Martin, Victarion is \"dumb as a stump\"[13] and \"a dullard and a brute\".[14]\n\nTwo of Victarion's brothers, Euron and Aeron, often mocked him when they were boys.[11] Euron later gave Victarion his first woman to make him a man.[7]\n\nVictarion and his two elder brothers, Balon and Euron, convinced their father Quellon, Lord of the Iron Islands, to join Robert's Rebellion, and the ironborn raided the Reach late in the war. After Quellon was killed in a battle at the Mander, however, the new Lord Balon returned to the Iron Islands with his younger brothers.[8][15]\n\nVictarion's first wife died in childbirth, birthing a stillborn daughter, and his second wife was stricken by a pox.[3]\n\nVictarion recognized the greatness of Balon and followed him loyally. He commanded the great fleet constructed by Balon, the Iron Fleet, during Greyjoy's Rebellion. During the war, using a plan Euron had concocted, they sailed into Lannisport and burned the Lannister fleet at anchor.[12] Victarion tossed the first torch onto the flagship of Lord Tywin Lannister.[3] Later in the rebellion, the Iron Fleet was smashed by Stannis Baratheon in a sea battle off Fair Isle, during which Golden Storm, the vessel of Victarion's younger brother Aeron, was chopped in half by Stannis's warship, Fury.[8]\n\nVictarion continued to serve Balon faithfully as Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet after the rebellion's end, and he took a third spouse, a salt wife.[3] According to a semi-canon source,[16] she had an affair with Euron, however, and was impregnated by him. When Victarion confronted his brother, Euron laughed and claimed the woman was willing. To retain his honor and prevent the cuckoldry from becoming public,[3] a sobbing Victarion beat his love[7] to death and left her body on the shore for crabs to eat. Only the taboo against kinslaying kept Victarion from doing the same to Euron.[3] Victarion has not touched a woman since, nor has he forgiven Euron,[3] who was forced into exile by Balon in 297 AC.[12][8] Balon commanded that neither speak of what happened.[3]\n\nIn addition to his third wife, Victarion has beaten four men to death with his fists.[3] Victarion thrashed Harras Harlaw on multiple occasions when Harras was young.[7]\n\nBalon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, gather his forces to Pyke in preparation for an ironborn invasion of the north during the War of the Five Kings. Victarion loans his steersman, Rymolf Stormdrunk, to his nephew, Theon Greyjoy, who has returned to the Iron Islands after years on the mainland.[12] During a feast in the Great Hall of Pyke, Victarion laughs when Asha Greyjoy makes fun of her brother, Theon. After the feast, Victarion discusses tides and winds with Balon in the lord's solar.[12]\n\nBalon declares himself King of the Iron Islands,[17] and he sends Victarion with the Iron Fleet to sail up the Saltspear and the Fever River.[12] Moat Cailin falls to Victarion's surprise assault.[18]\n\nTheon deviates from his harrying of the Stony Shore and orchestrates the capture of Winterfell,[17] and Balon styles himself King of the Isles and the North.[19] Theon intends to hold Meera and Jojen Reed captive to prevent their father, Lord Howland Reed, from attacking Victarion's men holding Moat Cailin, but the Reed children vanish from Winterfell.[20]\n\nRobb Stark, the King in the North, is informed at Hag's Mire of Balon falling to his death at Pyke and the return of his exiled brother, Euron Crow's Eye. Robb thinks that Victarion will leave Moat Cailin to claim Balon's throne.[21]\n\nVictarion wears mail and leather day and night at the ruins of Moat Cailin for protection from crannogmen. Red Ralf Stonehouse, Ralf Kenning, Ralf the Limper, and Nute the Barber support Victarion becoming king. After hearing that his younger brother Aeron Damphair has called for a kingsmoot to determine Balon's successor, Victarion returns to the Iron Islands with his fleet. He leaves a token force under the command of Ralf Kenning to defend Moat Cailin.[3]\n\nVictarion makes a claim to the Seastone Chair as Balon's brother and second-in-command, and he holds a great feast for famous captains on the shore of Nagga's Cradle. Victarion receives the support of Fralegg the Strong and Alvyn Sharp, and Hotho Harlaw suggests his twelve-year-old daughter as a queen for the widowed Lord Captain. Lord Baelor Blacktyde is wary, however, as Victarion intends to continue the war. Victarion refuses the offer of his niece, Asha Greyjoy, to share rule with him as king and her as his Hand, and he rejects her plan to make peace with northmen.[3]\n\nRed Ralf, Ralf the Limper, and Nute serve as Victarion's champions during the kingsmoot on Old Wyk, and his men offer silver, gold, and gems to the gathered captains. Victarion gives a brief speech in which he offers to continue Balon's war, but the crowd ultimately favors Euron after he promises to conquer Westeros with dragons.[5]\n\nAeron asks for Victarion's help in raising the Iron Islands against Euron, but Victarion's obedient and dutiful nature keeps him following his new king's orders, despite his personal hatred for Euron.[7] Victarion has the Iron Fleet stop Lord Blacktyde from departing Nagga's Cradle, and Euron then has Baelor executed for not accepting his kingship.[7] Euron gives Victarion a dusky woman taken from a slaving ship to serve as his bedwarmer. Victarion is reluctant to accept anything from his hated brother, but he relents when Euron threatens to have the woman killed.[7]\n\nVictarion leads the taking of the Shields, slaughtering unarmored sailors and winning a duel with Ser Talbert Serry, the son of Lord Osbert Serry, but his left hand is wounded during the fight. After his victory, Victarion watches helplessly as Euron steals Nute's allegiance by naming him Lord of Oakenshield. Victarion also deplores the cruelty Euron displays toward the slain lords' women.[7]\n\nDuring a private meeting in Lord Hewett's castle, Victarion spits out the shade-of-the-evening he is given by his brother. Euron asks Victarion to find Daenerys Targaryen in Slaver's Bay and deliver Euron's marriage proposal, and the new king explains that Victarion will receive the Seastone Chair once Euron claims the Iron Throne. Victarion agrees, but he secretly plans on courting Daenerys for himself.[7]\n\nAfter Theon negotiates the yielding of Moat Cailin, Ramsay Bolton executes the small garrison left behind by Victarion.[22]\n\nVictarion's Iron Fleet sails east, capturing prizes in the Redwyne Straits and along the coast of Dorne. After the Stepstones, they split into three squadrons and set sail for Meereen. Victarion's squadron follows the coast of the Disputed Lands, visits Volantis, and continues past the Valyrian peninsula. Also aboard Iron Victory is the dusky woman, whom Victarion sleeps with. Victarion loses nearly half his ships by the time the Iron Fleet reaches the Isle of Cedars. Victarion's wounded hand continues to trouble him, and he suspects that Kerwin, the maester from Greenshield that Euron sent to accompany him, is poisoning him. Victarion also dislikes the monkeys which board his ships from the Isle of Cedars.[11]\n\nA red priest named Moqorro is discovered clinging to wreckage out at sea by Grief. The crew of Iron Victory want Moqorro killed when Grief's captain, the Vole, brings him before their leader, but Moqorro convinces Victarion to allow him to treat his wounded hand. Behind closed doors, Moqorro apparently uses magic on the Lord Captain; when Victarion emerges from his cabin, his left hand is charred and blackened. Victarion has his men kill Maester Kerwin, for Moqorro has claimed his death will bring good winds,[11] and Victarion has Tom Tidewood garb the red priest in the black and gold colors of House Greyjoy.[23]\n\nThe Iron Fleet captures Ghiscari Dawn while continuing north toward Meereen, and Victarion has its captain drowned as a sacrifice to the Drowned God for claiming that Daenerys has died.[23] When the ironborn capture Dove, Victarion claims the Myrish eye of its captain for himself.[23] When the captains of two captured galleys repeat the claim that Daenerys is dead, Victarion beheads them and kills most of their crew. Victarion frees their enslaved oarsmen are freed, but then forces them to row for the Iron Fleet.[23] Victarion strangles the master of a fishing ketch after the fisherman laughs at the ironman's lack of knowledge of the Dothraki sea.[23]\n\nMoqorro, like Melisandre, can apparently see the future in the flames, and he prays before nightfires to aid Victarion in his quest. The Iron Victory's crew live in great fear of Moqorro and call him the Black Flame. Victarion begins making offerings to both the Drowned God and Moqorro's red god, R'hllor. When the Iron Fleet captures a Yunkish slaver galley, Willing Maiden, Victarion has the captive boys join the ironmen as rowers and gives the captive girls to his captains. Victarion claims the seven prettiest girls for himself, sets them adrift in a burning ketch, and has the girls burn and drown as sacrifices to his two gods. Victarion shows Dragonbinder, the dragon horn given to him by Euron, to Moqorro, and the red priest tells the ironman he must claim the horn with blood.[23]\n\nJust as the second siege of Meereen resumes, Victarion and the Iron Fleet arrive in Meereen's bay.[24]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nVictarion is a large and powerful man, with a bull's broad chest,[3] a boy's flat stomach,[3] and huge hands.[5] His hair is flecked with grey.[3] Theon Greyjoy considers his uncle to be an old man.[6] Victarion is less handsome than his brother Euron.[3]\n\nVictarion is a follower of the Drowned God,[7] and Aeron Greyjoy considers Victarion to be more godly than their despised elder brother, Euron Crow's Eye.[8] Victarion is a capable commander and a fierce warrior in battle, but he has a calm demeanor outside of it, thinking of enemies who show bravery with great respect.[9] He is willing to wear plate armor while sailing because he has no fear of drowning.[7] Victarion loves the ships of the Iron Fleet,[3] and he always wants wine after a battle.[7]\n\nThe Lord Captain wears heavy grey chain mail over boiled black leather.[3] When preparing for combat, Victarion also wears heavy plate.[10] He wears padded gloves underneath his iron gauntlets of lobstered steel plate.[7] Victarion's tall black warhelm is decorated with an iron kraken, whose tentacles coil down below his jaw.[3] He carries a longsword and a dirk,[3] but prefers to use his fearsome steel axe[5] with a shield.[7] Victarion's cloak is made of nine layers of gold cloth sewn like the kraken of his House, and its arms reach his boots.[3]\n\nVictarion dislikes laughter, fearing that it means he is being made fun of by others, and the realization of mockery angers him.[11] Theon and Asha Greyjoy consider their uncle to be a grey bullock, with Theon recalling Victarion as dutiful but unambitious and Asha finding him dim.[12] According to George R.
