  "content": "Robb Stark is the eldest son of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully and is the heir of House Stark to Winterfell and the north. He is called the Young Wolf by friend[10][16] and foe[17][18] alike.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Robb is portrayed by Richard Madden.[19]\n\nRobb opens the series as a boy of fourteen years.[20] His appearance favors his Tully side, with blue eyes and thick red-brown hair.[20] When he grows a beard, it is redder than his auburn hair.[21] Fast[20] and strong for his age,[8] Robb is more muscular than his half brother, Jon Snow.[20]\n\nRobb is his father Eddard's son, with a keen sense of justice[14] and courtesy.[22][23] He shares his father's devotion to honor[2] and is caring toward his younger brother Bran.[8] Despite his youth, Robb forces himself to act more lordly and take on responsibility when needed.[8][24] Robb is a follower of the old gods[1] and is frequently accompanied by his direwolf, Grey Wind.[10][1]\n\nArya Stark wants to be as strong as her oldest brother,[25][26] and Sansa and Bran admire Robb's bravery.[27][28] Robb and Jon Snow are best friends and constant companions.[29] Robb and Theon Greyjoy, Eddard's ward and hostage, are friends, with Robb seeming to admire Theon[30] and Theon thinking of Robb like a younger brother.[11]\n\nOn formal occasions Robb wears grey wool trimmed with white, the colors of House Stark,[31] and he also has ringmail and boiled leather.[32] Robb wields a longsword[30][1] and a dagger on his belt,[24] and his oak shield, banded white and grey with iron, is decorated with a snarling direwolf's head.[24][22][10] Robb has a fur-trimmed cloak[24] which he wears over his surcoat, both of which are white.[2] When on campaign, his armor includes grey chainmail over bleached leathers,[24] plate,[1] mailed gloves,[10] and a visor with a helm.[10] His horses include a big grey-and-white gelding,[30] a grey stallion,[10] and a piebald gelding.[10] Robb is better with a lance than Jon, although Jon is more skilled with a sword.[33]\n\nRobb was conceived during the first fortnight of the marriage of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully[10]—on the wedding night at Riverrun, according to Catelyn.[6] While Eddard rode south to fight in Robert's Rebellion, Catelyn remained at House Tully's castle. Near the end of the war, she gave birth at Riverrun[10] with the aid of Maester Luwin.[34] After war ended Catelyn traveled to Winterfell with Robb.[7]\n\nRobb was raised at Winterfell as his father's heir, and is the closest of companions with his half-brother Jon Snow.[7] Robb and Jon trained together at arms ever since they were big enough to walk, and played at being mighty knights and heroes.[35] Once, Robb and Jon built a great mountain of snow above a gate. They were spotted by Mance Rayder, then a brother of the Night's Watch, who had accompanied the visiting Lord Commander Qorgyle. Mance promised not to tell on them, and the two boys eventually dumped the snow on Fat Tom, the slowest of Lord Eddard's household guards, who chased them around afterward.[36]\n\nAfter Greyjoy's Rebellion in 289 AC, Eddard brought to Winterfell a hostage, Theon Greyjoy, the last surviving son of Lord Balon Greyjoy. Robb came to befriend Theon and enjoy the elder boy's company.[30][11] Theon joined Robb and Jon in their training at arms under the tutelage of Ser Rodrik Cassel,[37] and Robb and Theon trained at sword fighting at the staircases of Winterfell.[38] The Stark children, Jon, and Theon were also educated by Maester Luwin.[39] Catelyn resented whenever Jon defeated Robb in a task put before the two youths.[35]\n\nWhen Bran was only a few years old, Robb took his siblings into the crypt of Winterfell to show them the empty tombs that would be theirs one day. Jon, having covered himself with flour to appear as a ghost, tried to scare his half siblings by emerging from a tomb, and a sobbing Bran wrapped his arms around the legs of a laughing Robb.[40]\n\nWhen Alys Karstark was six, Lord Rickard Karstark brought his daughter to Winterfell in an attempt to betroth her to Eddard's heir.[41] Although no betrothal was arranged, Robb courteously told Alys that she danced beautifully.[23] Robb has often attended Lord Stark's councils,[42] and he has hunted in the wolfswood with his father, Jon, and Jory Cassel.[42] Eddard enjoys hawking with his heir.[43]\n\nRobb attends the execution of Gared and discovers a litter of six direwolf pups in the snow. He claims one of the direwolves for his own and names him Grey Wind.[20] Shortly after the court of King Robert I Baratheon arrives at Winterfell, Robb spars with the crown prince, Joffrey, using wooden swords. Bad blood develops between the two when Joffrey challenges Robb to spar with live steel. Ser Rodrik Cassel, Winterfell's master-at-arms, does not allow it, to the mockery and chagrin of many of the present retainers of House Lannister.[34] Robb escorts Princess Myrcella Baratheon, to the feast in the Great Hall of Winterfell.[31]\n\nWhen his father Eddard, Lord of Winterfell, is named Hand of the King to Robert and journeys south to King's Landing, Robb remains in Winterfell to rule in his father's stead with the help of his mother, Catelyn Stark.[34] She becomes traumatized when her younger son Bran is crippled by a fall from the First Keep, however, so more responsibility falls on Robb.[44] After an assassin tries to kill the comatose Bran,[44] Catelyn travels to King's Landing to inform Eddard.[45]\n\nRobb holds court as the Stark in Winterfell, meeting with Tyrion Lannister and Yoren in the Great Hall and traveling to distant holdfasts.[8] While riding in the wolfswood, Robb and his friend, Theon Greyjoy, rescue the crippled Bran from wildlings and deserters from the Night's Watch, with Robb killing an axeman with his sword and then subduing Osha. Robb criticizes Theon for shooting an arrow near Bran.[30]\n\nAfter word arrives of Eddard's arrest in King's Landing for treason against the late king Robert's successor, Joffrey, Robb calls the Stark bannermen to Winterfell. Maege Mormont, Lady of Bear Island, tries to interest Robb in a granddaughter, and Medger Cerwyn, Lord of Cerwyn, introduces him to his own daughter, Jonelle. Halys Hornwood, Lord of the Hornwood, offers gifts in return for land and rights, while Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort, and Robett Glover both seek battle command. When Jon Umber, Lord of the Last Hearth, threatens Robb's authority, the youth has Grey Wind attack the Greatjon, biting off two fingers; a laughing Lord Umber becomes Robb's greatest champion. Despite his youth and inexperience, Robb unites the bannermen.[24]\n\nWhen Robb marches south to the riverlands, his motives are to support his mother Catelyn's family, House Tully, in response to the invasion of House Lannister from the westerlands, and to bring back his father Eddard.[24] Bran remains at Winterfell with Maester Luwin[24] and Rodrik Cassel.[46]\n\nRobb begins growing a beard while marching south.[46] He resides in the Gatehouse Tower while encamped at Moat Cailin, where his host is joined by Catelyn, Ser Brynden Tully, and the levies from White Harbor.[46] They learn that Riverrun has been besieged by a host led by Ser Jaime Lannister, whilst another force led by Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, approaches from the south. Robb plans to split his forces, sending his foot under the command of Lord Bolton to engage Tywin's army, while himself crossing the Green Fork with the majority of his horse so he can lift the siege of Riverrun.[46]\n\nFor allowing Robb to cross the river at the Twins and grant the northman his allegiance, Walder Frey, Lord of the Crossing, extracts the price of a marriage contract, ensuring that Robb will marry one of his daughters after the war is finished. Olyvar Frey, one of Walder's sons, becomes Robb's personal squire.[22]\n\nJason Mallister, Lord of Seagard, joins Robb as he continues south toward Riverrun.[10] Robb is protected by a battle guard of highborn warriors who become his friends and companions.[10]\n\nWith the aid of his great-uncle, Brynden the Blackfish, Robb achieves complete surprise in ambushing Jaime in the Whispering Wood, annihilating the Lannister horsemen. Before being captured, Jaime slays Torrhen and Eddard Karstark and Daryn Hornwood while fighting to get to Robb.[10] Shortly thereafter Robb lifts the siege of Riverrun through the Battle of the Camps,[1] scattering Jaime's remaining forces. This forces Tywin's army, which had scored a victory against Roose Bolton's foot in the battle on the Green Fork, to retreat back to Harrenhal.[47]\n\nMeanwhile, Eddard Stark is executed for treason at the Great Sept of Baelor at the command of King Joffrey, effectively ending the possibility of peace between Stark and Lannister. In the Great Hall of Riverrun, Robb, now Lord of Winterfell, is conflicted over whom to support after Renly Baratheon is crowned at Highgarden in opposition to Joffrey. When Lord Umber offers his sword and proclaims Robb to be King in the North, the assembled northmen and river lords also bend the knee and take up the Greatjon's call.[1] The rivermen later grant Robb the title King of the Trident.[48]\n\nJon Snow deserts Castle Black so he can help his half brother, Robb, in the south, but Jon's new brothers in the Night's Watch convince him to return to the Wall.[49]\n\nKing Joffrey I Baratheon has Ser Boros Blount beat Sansa Stark after learning that her brother has been crowned King in the North.[50]\n\nRiverrun's smith creates for Robb a crown inspired by the ancient crowns of the Kings of Winter. The hammered bronze circlet is incised with runes of the First Men, and is surmounted with nine black iron spikes shaped like longswords.[21]\n\nDuring the harvest feast at Winterfell, Wyman Manderly, Lord of White Harbor, offers to mint coinage for Robb and build him a warfleet. Ser Rodrik Cassel states he will forward Wyman's offers to Robb.[51]\n\nRemaining idle for a time at Riverrun, Robb sends Theon Greyjoy, who fought alongside him in the Whispering Wood, to Pyke with the goal of securing an alliance with his father Balon, Lord of the Iron Islands, against the Lannisters in exchange for recognition of the independence of the Iron Islands.[21] Theon is rebuffed outright by Balon, who responds to the offer for peace with a large-scale invasion of the north.[12][52] Theon attacks the Stony Shore,[13] and Balon styles himself King of the Isles and the North.[53]\n\nRobb sends Ser Cleos Frey, a Lannister-allied captive from the Whispering Wood, to King's Landing with peace terms for Queen Regent Cersei Lannister.[21] Robb's terms are rejected, however, by Cersei, the small council, and Tyrion Lannister, the acting Hand of the King.[54] Robb also sends ravens to his aunt, Lysa Arryn, at the Eyrie, but receives no response.[55]\n\nRobb also sends his mother, Catelyn, south to treat with the late King Robert's youngest brother, Renly Baratheon.[21][55] Catelyn is unable to secure any meaningful treaty with either Renly[55] or his elder brother Stannis, who has besieged Renly's seat of Storm's End after also declaring himself king.[56] Catelyn flees back to Riverrun[16] after witnessing Renly's assassination by a shadow.[52]\n\nWhile the envoys depart on their ultimately unsuccessful missions, Robb heads west to deal with Stafford Lannister's host before it is fully trained.[21] Catelyn's brother, Ser Edmure Tully, holds Riverrun and guards Robb's rear.[16] Bypassing the Golden Tooth using a goat track found by Grey Wind, Robb smashes Stafford's host in the Battle of Oxcross; Rymund the Rhymer composes \"Wolf in the Night\" to honor the victory.[16] Robb has his bannermen plunder parts of the westerlands.[16] He captures several castles, including Ashemark,[57] seat of Lord Damon Marbrand, and the Crag,[58] seat of Lord Gawen Westerling, whom Robb had captured in the Whispering Wood.\n\nAfter learning that Lord Tywin Lannister is marching west, Edmure sends word for Ser Helman Tallhart to depart the Twins and aid Lord Roose Bolton in capturing Tywin's previous base, Harrenhal. Edmure believes that the Lannister host can thus be caught between Riverrun and Harrenhal, and Tywin can then be defeated once Robb returns from the west.[59] In the Battle of the Fords, Edmure's host fends off Tywin's attempt to cross the Red Fork and return to the westerlands.[60]\n\nTheon leads a small group of ironborn in the capture of Winterfell,[61] claiming the title Prince of Winterfell for himself.[62] After Robb's brothers, Bran and Rickon, disappear from the castle, Theon has the bodies of two peasant boys presented in their image.[63] The Stark brothers have actually hidden in the crypt of Winterfell, however, and thus survive the sack of Winterfell by Ramsay Snow.[64]\n\nFollowing Tywin Lannister's victory over Stannis Baratheon in the Battle of the Blackwater, the Freys encamped at Harrenhal with Lord Bolton believe that Robb should bend the knee. Ostensibly by Robb's command, Roose sends word for Helman Tallhart to burn Darry and then join Robett Glover and Harrion Karstark in attacking Duskendale.[26][65] Robb's sister Arya, who is disguised as a servant, overhears the Freys speak of having been betrayed.[26]\n\nHaving suffered a wound in the storming of the Crag, Robb is tended to by Jeyne Westerling, Gawen's daughter. When Robb learns of the supposed deaths of Bran and Rickon, Jeyne comforts Robb, which leads to his taking her maidenhead. In an effort to preserve her honor, Robb weds Jeyne immediately thereafter.[2] However, the Frey host that had accompanied Robb into the westerlands are furious and withdraw their support, with Black Walder Frey threatening to kill Jeyne. Olyvar Frey wants to remain with Robb as as his squire, but Ser Ryman Frey insists he return to the Twins with his kin.[2] Robb shaves his beard but allows his hair to grow to his shoulders.[2]\n\nAbandoning the castles he had taken in the west,[5] Robb returns to Riverrun with his new wife in tow, much to his mother Catelyn's horror as, having pledged to wed a daughter of House Frey, this was not a slight that Lord Walder Frey is likely to overlook.[2] Catelyn wishes that Robb had wed the more powerful Margaery Tyrell instead of Jeyne.[2]\n\nSer Edmure Tully, acting Lord Paramount of the Trident whilst his father Hoster Tully lays on his deathbed, met Tywin Lannister's army as they attempted to cross the Red Fork near Riverrun and threw them back. While the Battle of the Fords prevented Tywin's force from approaching Robb's from the rear, Robb's plan had been to entangle Tywin's army in a chase in the west while Stannis Baratheon marched on King's Landing. Being thrown back at Riverrun allowed Tywin's force to turn around and arrive at the capital in time for the Battle of the Blackwater, which turned the tide of the battle, and indeed the war, in House Lannister's favor. Robb and Ser Brynden Tully reprimand Edmure in private.[2]\n\nRobb learns that in her grief over the supposed murder of two of her sons, Catelyn released Jaime Lannister from captivity and entrusted him with a mission to return her daughters Sansa and Arya to her, if possible.[2] This earns her the enmity of Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, as Jaime had slain two of Rickard's sons, Eddard and Torrhen, while they defended Robb in the Whispering Wood; Rickard requires vengeance for their deaths. In response to Jaime's release, Lord Karstark sends his horsemen to search the countryside for Jaime and then leads a small group in murdering two prisoners, Tion Frey and Willem Lannister, in a tower of Riverrun. For this crime, Robb sentences Lord Karstark to death and beheads Rickard himself with a poleaxe in the godswood of Riverrun.[14]\n\nAfter learning of the defeat of Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart in the battle at Duskendale, Robb is dumbfounded as to why his northern infantry even attacked the town.[66] With problems on every side, Robb seems only to take solace in the company of the Westerlings: his loving wife Jeyne, her brother Ser Raynald his banner-bearer, and their younger brother, Robb's new squire Rollam. With all others, he is the solemn King in the North. A solitary Robb burns an unsent letter and spends his time reviewing maps.[66]\n\nWhen Lord Hoster Tully finally passes away, Robb aids six rivermen in pushing his grandfather's funereal boat into the Red Fork.[67] He meets with Lame Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers, envoys of Lord Walder Frey, who had been slighted by Robb's marriage to Jeyne Westerling. Robb suggests that his uncle Edmure, now Lord of Riverrun, wed one of Lord Walder's daughters in his stead, a proposal to which Edmure reluctantly agrees.[66]\n\nLeaving Jeyne behind at Riverrun and appointing Brynden the Blackfish as Warden of the Southern Marches, Robb takes his host north toward the Twins, where Edmure is to marry Roslin Frey.[6] Once the wedding is done, Robb intends to then return to the north, reclaim his territory, much of which has been conquered by the ironborn, and avenge Bran and Rickon. Because he believes his brothers dead and Arya lost, and fearing that, by the laws of succession, were he to die without issue, Winterfell and the north would go to Sansa's new husband, Tyrion Lannister, Robb discusses the matter of his succession with his mother at Oldstones. To her chagrin, Robb suggests that, if he were to die, his bastard half-brother Jon Snow should succeed him.[6]\n\nAt Hag's Mire, Robb sends Maege Mormont and Galbart Glover, Master of Deepwood Motte, north to Howland Reed, Lord of Greywater Watch, to procure crannogmen who can guide Robb through the Neck and thus allow him to attack the ironborn unawares at Moat Cailin. Robb provides letters containing false orders in order to protect Maege and Galbart if they are captured. Robb has a small group of supporters—Catelyn, Edmure, Maege, Galbart, Jason Mallister, and Greatjon Umber—witness his choice of successor,[6] which according to a semi-canon source is a legitimized Jon Snow.[7]\n\nThe Brave Companions capture Jaime Lannister in the field, chop off his sword hand, and bring him to Harrenhal. Instead of returning Jaime to captivity in Riverrun, Lord Roose Bolton allows Jaime to continue on to King's Landing.[65] When Roose asks Jaime to give his regards to his father, Lord Tywin, Jaime says he will do so if Roose conveys his own to Robb.[68]\n\nBecause Grey Wind is aggressive toward Freys when Robb arrives at the Twins, the direwolf is penned up. When Robb tries to apologize to Lord Frey, Walder instead has the young king beg for pardon from his assembled daughters and granddaughters. Once that is done, Robb and Catelyn ask for food and wine, signifying guest right.[69] After Lord Bolton arrives with the remaining northern infantry, mostly Boltons and Karstarks, he claims to Robb that Robett Glover had attacked Duskendale out of grief for Deepwood. Roose also reveals that Theon Greyjoy, Robb's one-time friend, is being tortured at the Dreadfort by his son, Ramsay Snow.[69]\n\nDespite guest right, Walder betrays Robb during the feast after the wedding of Roslin and Edmure. In what is later known as the Red Wedding, Robb's companions and men are murdered by Freys, fur-clad northmen, and sellswords disguised as musicians. Having been struck by multiple arrows, Robb weakly calls out to his mother and Grey Wind. Catelyn tries to trade her son's life for Jinglebell, but Walder cares not for his lackwit grandson. Catelyn watches Roose Bolton deliver the final blow to her son, stabbing him through the heart while stating, \"Jaime Lannister sends his regards\".[70] Driven mad with despair, Catelyn murders Jinglebell and is killed shortly thereafter by Ser Raymund Frey.[70][71] Grey Wind, who had been chained outside to placate the Freys, is also slain via crossbow bolts, his head removed and sewn onto Robb's body as a final insult to the King in the North.[72]\n\nMost of the river lords surrender in the aftermath of the Red Wedding, although Riverrun remains held by the Blackfish.[73] Roose Bolton is named Warden of the North and his son Ramsay is legitimized.[74] Ramsay is also to wed \"Arya Stark\", but Jaime recognizes that the girl to be presented to House Bolton is an impostor.[74]\n\nUnder the leadership of the reborn Catelyn Stark, now called Lady Stoneheart, the vengeful brotherhood without banners kill Freys in the riverlands.[71][75][76] Brienne of Tarth sees Catelyn holding Robb's crown after reclaiming it from a whore.[75]\n\nSer Jaime Lannister peacefully resolves the siege of Riverrun and takes Robb's widow, Jeyne Westerling, into custody. Jeyne has torn her clothes out of mourning, and her mother, Sybell Spicer, affirms for Jaime that the girl is not pregnant with Robb's child. Sybelle has also confiscated the crown which Robb had given the girl.[76]\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle beneath the Wall, Stannis Baratheon requests homage from the bannermen of the north. From Bear Island, Lyanna Mormont responds with the message that \"Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is STARK.\"[77]\n\nThe Frey envoys at White Harbor—Rhaegar, Ser Jared, and Symond—tell the Merman's Court that Robb turned into a wolf as a warg and slew the knights Wendel Manderly, Tytos Frey, and Garse Goodbrook.[78] Meeting in secret, Wendel's father, Lord Wyman, and Robett Glover assure Stannis's envoy, Lord Davos Seaworth, that they does not believe the Frey lies, and Wyman tasks Davos with finding Robb's youngest brother, Rickon Stark.[79] The three Freys disappear while traveling from White Harbor to Barrowton.[80]\n\nBran Stark trains as a greenseer in the cave of the three-eyed crow. In one vision of the godswood of Winterfell, Bran sees a younger version of his father Eddard praying, \"let them grow up close as brothers, with only love between them\".[81]\n\nJaime Lannister ends the siege of Raventree, as Tytos Blackwood, Lord of Raventree Hall, was the last river lord to continue flying the Stark banner.[82]\n\nNow a mutilated captive of House Bolton at Winterfell, Theon Greyjoy regrets having sided with his own family, House Greyjoy, against House Stark, realizing that Robb had been more a brother to him than his actual kin, Rodrik and Maron.[38]\n\nIn an early draft of A Game of Thrones, Robb was 12 years old rather than 14.[86]\n\nThis page uses content from the English Wikipedia.

They were spotted by Mance Rayder, then a brother of the Night's Watch, who had accompanied the visiting Lord Commander Qorgyle. Mance promised not to tell on them, and the two boys eventually dumped the snow on Fat Tom, the slowest of Lord Eddard's household guards, who chased them around afterward.[36]\n\nAfter Greyjoy's Rebellion in 289 AC, Eddard brought to Winterfell a hostage, Theon Greyjoy, the last surviving son of Lord Balon Greyjoy.

He claims one of the direwolves for his own and names him Grey Wind.[20] Shortly after the court of King Robert I Baratheon arrives at Winterfell, Robb spars with the crown prince, Joffrey, using wooden swords. Bad blood develops between the two when Joffrey challenges Robb to spar with live steel. Ser Rodrik Cassel, Winterfell's master-at-arms, does not allow it, to the mockery and chagrin of many of the present retainers of House Lannister.[34] Robb escorts Princess Myrcella Baratheon, to the feast in the Great Hall of Winterfell.[31]\n\nWhen his father Eddard, Lord of Winterfell, is named Hand of the King to Robert and journeys south to King's Landing, Robb remains in Winterfell to rule in his father's stead with the help of his mother, Catelyn Stark.[34] She becomes traumatized when her younger son Bran is crippled by a fall from the First Keep, however, so more responsibility falls on Robb.[44] After an assassin tries to kill the comatose Bran,[44] Catelyn travels to King's Landing to inform Eddard.[45]\n\nRobb holds court as the Stark in Winterfell, meeting with Tyrion Lannister and Yoren in the Great Hall and traveling to distant holdfasts.[8] While riding in the wolfswood, Robb and his friend, Theon Greyjoy, rescue the crippled Bran from wildlings and deserters from the Night's Watch, with Robb killing an axeman with his sword and then subduing Osha. Robb criticizes Theon for shooting an arrow near Bran.[30]\n\nAfter word arrives of Eddard's arrest in King's Landing for treason against the late king Robert's successor, Joffrey, Robb calls the Stark bannermen to Winterfell. Maege Mormont, Lady of Bear Island, tries to interest Robb in a granddaughter, and Medger Cerwyn, Lord of Cerwyn, introduces him to his own daughter, Jonelle. Halys Hornwood, Lord of the Hornwood, offers gifts in return for land and rights, while Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort, and Robett Glover both seek battle command. When Jon Umber, Lord of the Last Hearth, threatens Robb's authority, the youth has Grey Wind attack the Greatjon, biting off two fingers; a laughing Lord Umber becomes Robb's greatest champion. Despite his youth and inexperience, Robb unites the bannermen.[24]\n\nWhen Robb marches south to the riverlands, his motives are to support his mother Catelyn's family, House Tully, in response to the invasion of House Lannister from the westerlands, and to bring back his father Eddard.[24] Bran remains at Winterfell with Maester Luwin[24] and Rodrik Cassel.[46]\n\nRobb begins growing a beard while marching south.[46] He resides in the Gatehouse Tower while encamped at Moat Cailin, where his host is joined by Catelyn, Ser Brynden Tully, and the levies from White Harbor.[46] They learn that Riverrun has been besieged by a host led by Ser Jaime Lannister, whilst another force led by Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, approaches from the south. Robb plans to split his forces, sending his foot under the command of Lord Bolton to engage Tywin's army, while himself crossing the Green Fork with the majority of his horse so he can lift the siege of Riverrun.[46]\n\nFor allowing Robb to cross the river at the Twins and grant the northman his allegiance, Walder Frey, Lord of the Crossing, extracts the price of a marriage contract, ensuring that Robb will marry one of his daughters after the war is finished. Olyvar Frey, one of Walder's sons, becomes Robb's personal squire.[22]\n\nJason Mallister, Lord of Seagard, joins Robb as he continues south toward Riverrun.[10] Robb is protected by a battle guard of highborn warriors who become his friends and companions.[10]\n\nWith the aid of his great-uncle, Brynden the Blackfish, Robb achieves complete surprise in ambushing Jaime in the Whispering Wood, annihilating the Lannister horsemen. Before being captured, Jaime slays Torrhen and Eddard Karstark and Daryn Hornwood while fighting to get to Robb.[10] Shortly thereafter Robb lifts the siege of Riverrun through the Battle of the Camps,[1] scattering Jaime's remaining forces. This forces Tywin's army, which had scored a victory against Roose Bolton's foot in the battle on the Green Fork, to retreat back to Harrenhal.[47]\n\nMeanwhile, Eddard Stark is executed for treason at the Great Sept of Baelor at the command of King Joffrey, effectively ending the possibility of peace between Stark and Lannister. In the Great Hall of Riverrun, Robb, now Lord of Winterfell, is conflicted over whom to support after Renly Baratheon is crowned at Highgarden in opposition to Joffrey. When Lord Umber offers his sword and proclaims Robb to be King in the North, the assembled northmen and river lords also bend the knee and take up the Greatjon's call.[1] The rivermen later grant Robb the title King of the Trident.[48]\n\nJon Snow deserts Castle Black so he can help his half brother, Robb, in the south, but Jon's new brothers in the Night's Watch convince him to return to the Wall.[49]\n\n\n## A Clash of Kings\n\n\nKing Joffrey I Baratheon has Ser Boros Blount beat Sansa Stark after learning that her brother has been crowned King in the North.[50]\n\nRiverrun's smith creates for Robb a crown inspired by the ancient crowns of the Kings of Winter. The hammered bronze circlet is incised with runes of the First Men, and is surmounted with nine black iron spikes shaped like longswords.[21]\n\nDuring the harvest feast at Winterfell, Wyman Manderly, Lord of White Harbor, offers to mint coinage for Robb and build him a warfleet. Ser Rodrik Cassel states he will forward Wyman's offers to Robb.[51]\n\nRemaining idle for a time at Riverrun, Robb sends Theon Greyjoy, who fought alongside him in the Whispering Wood, to Pyke with the goal of securing an alliance with his father Balon, Lord of the Iron Islands, against the Lannisters in exchange for recognition of the independence of the Iron Islands.[21] Theon is rebuffed outright by Balon, who responds to the offer for peace with a large-scale invasion of the north.[12][52] Theon attacks the Stony Shore,[13] and Balon styles himself King of the Isles and the North.[53]\n\nRobb sends Ser Cleos Frey, a Lannister-allied captive from the Whispering Wood, to King's Landing with peace terms for Queen Regent Cersei Lannister.[21] Robb's terms are rejected, however, by Cersei, the small council, and Tyrion Lannister, the acting Hand of the King.[54] Robb also sends ravens to his aunt, Lysa Arryn, at the Eyrie, but receives no response.[55]\n\nRobb also sends his mother, Catelyn, south to treat with the late King Robert's youngest brother, Renly Baratheon.[21][55] Catelyn is unable to secure any meaningful treaty with either Renly[55] or his elder brother Stannis, who has besieged Renly's seat of Storm's End after also declaring himself king.[56] Catelyn flees back to Riverrun[16] after witnessing Renly's assassination by a shadow.[52]\n\nWhile the envoys depart on their ultimately unsuccessful missions, Robb heads west to deal with Stafford Lannister's host before it is fully trained.[21] Catelyn's brother, Ser Edmure Tully, holds Riverrun and guards Robb's rear.[16] Bypassing the Golden Tooth using a goat track found by Grey Wind, Robb smashes Stafford's host in the Battle of Oxcross; Rymund the Rhymer composes \"Wolf in the Night\" to honor the victory.[16] Robb has his bannermen plunder parts of the westerlands.[16] He captures several castles, including Ashemark,[57] seat of Lord Damon Marbrand, and the Crag,[58] seat of Lord Gawen Westerling, whom Robb had captured in the Whispering Wood.\n\nAfter learning that Lord Tywin Lannister is marching west, Edmure sends word for Ser Helman Tallhart to depart the Twins and aid Lord Roose Bolton in capturing Tywin's previous base, Harrenhal. Edmure believes that the Lannister host can thus be caught between Riverrun and Harrenhal, and Tywin can then be defeated once Robb returns from the west.[59] In the Battle of the Fords, Edmure's host fends off Tywin's attempt to cross the Red Fork and return to the westerlands.[60]\n\nTheon leads a small group of ironborn in the capture of Winterfell,[61] claiming the title Prince of Winterfell for himself.[62] After Robb's brothers, Bran and Rickon, disappear from the castle, Theon has the bodies of two peasant boys presented in their image.[63] The Stark brothers have actually hidden in the crypt of Winterfell, however, and thus survive the sack of Winterfell by Ramsay Snow.[64]\n\nFollowing Tywin Lannister's victory over Stannis Baratheon in the Battle of the Blackwater, the Freys encamped at Harrenhal with Lord Bolton believe that Robb should bend the knee. Ostensibly by Robb's command, Roose sends word for Helman Tallhart to burn Darry and then join Robett Glover and Harrion Karstark in attacking Duskendale.[26][65] Robb's sister Arya, who is disguised as a servant, overhears the Freys speak of having been betrayed.[26]\n\n\n## A Storm of Swords\n\n\nHaving suffered a wound in the storming of the Crag, Robb is tended to by Jeyne Westerling, Gawen's daughter. When Robb learns of the supposed deaths of Bran and Rickon, Jeyne comforts Robb, which leads to his taking her maidenhead. In an effort to preserve her honor, Robb weds Jeyne immediately thereafter.[2] However, the Frey host that had accompanied Robb into the westerlands are furious and withdraw their support, with Black Walder Frey threatening to kill Jeyne. Olyvar Frey wants to remain with Robb as as his squire, but Ser Ryman Frey insists he return to the Twins with his kin.[2] Robb shaves his beard but allows his hair to grow to his shoulders.[2]\n\nAbandoning the castles he had taken in the west,[5] Robb returns to Riverrun with his new wife in tow, much to his mother Catelyn's horror as, having pledged to wed a daughter of House Frey, this was not a slight that Lord Walder Frey is likely to overlook.[2] Catelyn wishes that Robb had wed the more powerful Margaery Tyrell instead of Jeyne.[2]\n\nSer Edmure Tully, acting Lord Paramount of the Trident whilst his father Hoster Tully lays on his deathbed, met Tywin Lannister's army as they attempted to cross the Red Fork near Riverrun and threw them back. While the Battle of the Fords prevented Tywin's force from approaching Robb's from the rear, Robb's plan had been to entangle Tywin's army in a chase in the west while Stannis Baratheon marched on King's Landing. Being thrown back at Riverrun allowed Tywin's force to turn around and arrive at the capital in time for the Battle of the Blackwater, which turned the tide of the battle, and indeed the war, in House Lannister's favor. Robb and Ser Brynden Tully reprimand Edmure in private.[2]\n\nRobb learns that in her grief over the supposed murder of two of her sons, Catelyn released Jaime Lannister from captivity and entrusted him with a mission to return her daughters Sansa and Arya to her, if possible.[2] This earns her the enmity of Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, as Jaime had slain two of Rickard's sons, Eddard and Torrhen, while they defended Robb in the Whispering Wood; Rickard requires vengeance for their deaths. In response to Jaime's release, Lord Karstark sends his horsemen to search the countryside for Jaime and then leads a small group in murdering two prisoners, Tion Frey and Willem Lannister, in a tower of Riverrun. For this crime, Robb sentences Lord Karstark to death and beheads Rickard himself with a poleaxe in the godswood of Riverrun.[14]\n\nAfter learning of the defeat of Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart in the battle at Duskendale, Robb is dumbfounded as to why his northern infantry even attacked the town.[66] With problems on every side, Robb seems only to take solace in the company of the Westerlings: his loving wife Jeyne, her brother Ser Raynald his banner-bearer, and their younger brother, Robb's new squire Rollam. With all others, he is the solemn King in the North. A solitary Robb burns an unsent letter and spends his time reviewing maps.[66]\n\nWhen Lord Hoster Tully finally passes away, Robb aids six rivermen in pushing his grandfather's funereal boat into the Red Fork.[67] He meets with Lame Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers, envoys of Lord Walder Frey, who had been slighted by Robb's marriage to Jeyne Westerling. Robb suggests that his uncle Edmure, now Lord of Riverrun, wed one of Lord Walder's daughters in his stead, a proposal to which Edmure reluctantly agrees.[66]\n\nLeaving Jeyne behind at Riverrun and appointing Brynden the Blackfish as Warden of the Southern Marches, Robb takes his host north toward the Twins, where Edmure is to marry Roslin Frey.[6] Once the wedding is done, Robb intends to then return to the north, reclaim his territory, much of which has been conquered by the ironborn, and avenge Bran and Rickon. Because he believes his brothers dead and Arya lost, and fearing that, by the laws of succession, were he to die without issue, Winterfell and the north would go to Sansa's new husband, Tyrion Lannister, Robb discusses the matter of his succession with his mother at Oldstones. To her chagrin, Robb suggests that, if he were to die, his bastard half-brother Jon Snow should succeed him.[6]\n\nAt Hag's Mire, Robb sends Maege Mormont and Galbart Glover, Master of Deepwood Motte, north to Howland Reed, Lord of Greywater Watch, to procure crannogmen who can guide Robb through the Neck and thus allow him to attack the ironborn unawares at Moat Cailin. Robb provides letters containing false orders in order to protect Maege and Galbart if they are captured. Robb has a small group of supporters—Catelyn, Edmure, Maege, Galbart, Jason Mallister, and Greatjon Umber—witness his choice of successor,[6] which according to a semi-canon source is a legitimized Jon Snow.[7]\n\nThe Brave Companions capture Jaime Lannister in the field, chop off his sword hand, and bring him to Harrenhal. Instead of returning Jaime to captivity in Riverrun, Lord Roose Bolton allows Jaime to continue on to King's Landing.[65] When Roose asks Jaime to give his regards to his father, Lord Tywin, Jaime says he will do so if Roose conveys his own to Robb.[68]\n\nBecause Grey Wind is aggressive toward Freys when Robb arrives at the Twins, the direwolf is penned up. When Robb tries to apologize to Lord Frey, Walder instead has the young king beg for pardon from his assembled daughters and granddaughters. Once that is done, Robb and Catelyn ask for food and wine, signifying guest right.[69] After Lord Bolton arrives with the remaining northern infantry, mostly Boltons and Karstarks, he claims to Robb that Robett Glover had attacked Duskendale out of grief for Deepwood. Roose also reveals that Theon Greyjoy, Robb's one-time friend, is being tortured at the Dreadfort by his son, Ramsay Snow.[69]\n\nDespite guest right, Walder betrays Robb during the feast after the wedding of Roslin and Edmure. In what is later known as the Red Wedding, Robb's companions and men are murdered by Freys, fur-clad northmen, and sellswords disguised as musicians. Having been struck by multiple arrows, Robb weakly calls out to his mother and Grey Wind. Catelyn tries to trade her son's life for Jinglebell, but Walder cares not for his lackwit grandson. Catelyn watches Roose Bolton deliver the final blow to her son, stabbing him through the heart while stating, \"Jaime Lannister sends his regards\".[70] Driven mad with despair, Catelyn murders Jinglebell and is killed shortly thereafter by Ser Raymund Frey.[70][71] Grey Wind, who had been chained outside to placate the Freys, is also slain via crossbow bolts, his head removed and sewn onto Robb's body as a final insult to the King in the North.[72]\n\nMost of the river lords surrender in the aftermath of the Red Wedding, although Riverrun remains held by the Blackfish.[73] Roose Bolton is named Warden of the North and his son Ramsay is legitimized.[74] Ramsay is also to wed \"Arya Stark\", but Jaime recognizes that the girl to be presented to House Bolton is an impostor.[74]\n\n\n## A Feast for Crows\n\n\nUnder the leadership of the reborn Catelyn Stark, now called Lady Stoneheart, the vengeful brotherhood without banners kill Freys in the riverlands.[71][75][76] Brienne of Tarth sees Catelyn holding Robb's crown after reclaiming it from a whore.[75]\n\nSer Jaime Lannister peacefully resolves the siege of Riverrun and takes Robb's widow, Jeyne Westerling, into custody. Jeyne has torn her clothes out of mourning, and her mother, Sybell Spicer, affirms for Jaime that the girl is not pregnant with Robb's child. Sybelle has also confiscated the crown which Robb had given the girl.[76]\n\n\n## A Dance with Dragons\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle beneath the Wall, Stannis Baratheon requests homage from the bannermen of the north. From Bear Island, Lyanna Mormont responds with the message that \"Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is STARK.\"[77]\n\nThe Frey envoys at White Harbor—Rhaegar, Ser Jared, and Symond—tell the Merman's Court that Robb turned into a wolf as a warg and slew the knights Wendel Manderly, Tytos Frey, and Garse Goodbrook.[78] Meeting in secret, Wendel's father, Lord Wyman, and Robett Glover assure Stannis's envoy, Lord Davos Seaworth, that they does not believe the Frey lies, and Wyman tasks Davos with finding Robb's youngest brother, Rickon Stark.[79] The three Freys disappear while traveling from White Harbor to Barrowton.[80]\n\nBran Stark trains as a greenseer in the cave of the three-eyed crow. In one vision of the godswood of Winterfell, Bran sees a younger version of his father Eddard praying, \"let them grow up close as brothers, with only love between them\".[81]\n\nJaime Lannister ends the siege of Raventree, as Tytos Blackwood, Lord of Raventree Hall, was the last river lord to continue flying the Stark banner.[82]\n\nNow a mutilated captive of House Bolton at Winterfell, Theon Greyjoy regrets having sided with his own family, House Greyjoy, against House Stark, realizing that Robb had been more a brother to him than his actual kin, Rodrik and Maron.[38]\n\n\n## Quotes by Robb\n\n\n\n## Quotes about Robb\n\n\n\n## Family\n\n\n\n## Behind the scenes\n\n\nIn an early draft of A Game of Thrones, Robb was 12 years old rather than 14.[86]",
