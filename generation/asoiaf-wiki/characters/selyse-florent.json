  "content": "Selyse Florent, also known as Selyse Baratheon,[1] is a noblewoman of House Florent and a niece of Alester Florent, Lord of Brightwater Keep. She is the wife of Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone, and together they have one daughter, Shireen Baratheon.[3][4]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Selyse is portrayed by Sarah MacKeever (Season 2) and Tara Fitzgerald (Seasons 3 - 5).\n\nSelyse is as tall as her husband, Stannis Baratheon.[5] Pinched and hard,[6] she is thin of body and face, with pale eyes, a sharp nose, and the Florent trait of too-large ears.[5] Selyse has thin lips,[7] and hair grows on her upper lip despite her plucking it daily.[5] Her smile can be thin[8] or as bright and brittle as her jewelry.[5] Her mouth is stern and her voice a whip.[5][6] Selyse is not considered a particularly attractive woman.[9]\n\nSelyse and Stannis have a loveless marriage, and the two have little patience for each other. They have one daughter, Shireen, a sad little girl bearing a disfigurement from greyscale.[5] Selyse is a haughty and cold woman, but she is protective of her daughter.[10][8]\n\nSelyse enjoys sewing.[1] She wears jewels[5] and an ermine mantle.[11]\n\nSelyse married Stannis in either 286 AC or 287 AC.[12] During the wedding feast, Stannis's elder brother, King Robert I Baratheon, deflowered Delena Florent, a cousin of Selyse, in the bed made for the newlyweds. Delena became pregnant and gave birth to a boy, Edric Storm.[13][14]\n\nStannis is not fond of his wife.[9] They sleep together only once or twice a year,[5] and despite their hopes they have only a daughter, Shireen;[3] Selyse believes that Edric's existence has cursed them to have no sons.[6] Stannis rarely sends letters from King's Landing to his wife at Dragonstone.[5]\n\nSome years before the start of A Song of Ice and Fire, Lord Varys informed Robert's small council that Selyse had taken up with a red priestess, Melisandre of Asshai, in Dragonstone.[9] Selyse has asked Stannis that they be wed again in a ceremony of the Lord of Light.[7]\n\nWhen Melisandre attached herself to Stannis Baratheon, Selyse became her most fervent supporter and immediately took to worshiping R'hllor, the Lord of Light. Selyse's uncle, Ser Axell Florent, soon converts as well.[10]\n\nSelyse becomes Stannis's queen after he claims the Iron Throne. Within the ranks of those who follow Stannis, those who believe in R'hllor are named queen's men after Selyse.[14] Selyse's crown matches that of Stannis, red gold with points in the shape of flames.[10] Selyse tells Stannis that the red comet is the banner of R'hllor and a sign for her husband.[5] When Stannis hosts a feast for his supporters, Selyse commands Maester Cressen to wear the helm of the fool Patchface[5] Selyse prays when Melisandre burns the statues of the Seven taken from the sept at Dragonstone.[14]\n\nIn order to discredit Stannis, the small council of King Joffrey I Baratheon spreads rumors that the father of Selyse's daughter, Shireen, is not Stannis, but instead Patchface.[9]\n\nWhen Stannis sails for Storm's End, he leaves Selyse and Axell on Dragonstone.[15] Selyse's influence on her husband becomes greater after Renly Baratheon is killed at Storm's End and Selyse's family from House Florent go over to Stannis. Selyse's brother, Ser Imry Florent, leads Stannis's fleet.[16] Their hopes are shattered when the fleet is destroyed during the Battle of the Blackwater.[16][17]\n\nAfter the Battle of the Blackwater and the subsequent flight by Stannis's forces to Dragonstone, Stannis remains enclosed in the Stone Drum, unwilling to speak with anyone. Selyse, with the help of her uncle, Lord Alester Florent, now the Hand of the King, holds court during Stannis's self-imposed silence.[18] Alester is later imprisoned for treason, however.[19]\n\nThe queen prays at the nightfiress of Melisandre.[20] Selyse tries to help Melisandre persuade Stannis to sacrifice Robert I Baratheon's bastard, Edric Storm. The sacrifice of Edric would supposedly wake the stone dragon statues on Dragonstone. Davos Seaworth, Stannis's new Hand, prevents this and has the boy shipped off to the Free Cities.[20]\n\nDavos advises that the real enemy is in the north, based on a letter from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch.[20] Stannis agrees and travels with Selyse and most of his remaining army to the Wall. Selyse and Shireen remain at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea while Stannis travels west to save Castle Black from the invading wildlings.[21]\n\nSelyse remains at Eastwatch while Stannis is at Castle Black.[22]\n\nSelyse holds a feast for Salladhor Saan and his captains before they sail south from Eastwatch for White Harbor.[23] Selyse becomes unhappy with her accommodations at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and her treatment by its commander, Cotter Pyke. She demands that she be allowed to move into the Nightfort that was to be given to Stannis when repaired.[24] Selyse's uncle, Ser Axell Florent, begins styling himself the Queen's Hand.[24]\n\nWhen it is found that the Nightfort is habitable, Selyse leaves Eastwatch for Castle Black with Shireen, Patchface, Tycho Nestoris, and serving girls and lady companions. The fifty queen's men who accompany her include knights, sworn swords, and men-at-arms, with Narbert Grandison, Benethon Scales, Brus Buckler, Patrek of King's Mountain, Dorden the Dour, Malegorn of Redpool, Lambert Whitewater, and Perkin Follard having places of honor by her side. Selyse is given the royal chamber in the King's Tower of Castle Black. Selyse and her knights are disgusted by Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun, but Shireen is fascinated by the giant.[10] Selyse is also made anxious by Ghost, the direwolf of Jon Snow, the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.[1]\n\nDuring the wedding of Sigorn and Alys Karstark, Selyse reverently stares into Melisandre's fire and joins the red priestess's prayers. Axell leads a toast to Stannis, Selyse, and R'hllor during the wedding feast, and in-between courses he leads his niece to the floor to begin the dancing.[7]\nSelyse is cold toward Val when the so-called wildling princess tells her that the free folk will not kneel to Stannis or accept R'hllor. Val expresses her concern about Shireen's greyscale to Jon.[1]\n\nSelyse disapproves of Lord Commander Snow's plan to send a ranging to rescue wildlings at Hardhome.[8] Tormund laughs at Selyse always surrounding herself with guards.[8]\n\nSelyse arranges the weddings of Gerrick Kingsblood's three daughters to Axell, Ser Brus Buckler, and Ser Malegorn of Redpool. She claims that Gerrick is the true King of the Wildlings, descended in an unbroken male line from Raymun Redbeard, a great King-Beyond-the-Wall. However, Tormund states Gerrick is descended from Raymun Redbeard's younger brother, the Red Raven, instead of the king, and that kingship among the free folk is not hereditary. Selyse also wants Val to marry Ser Patrek, but is rebuffed.[8]\n\nJon receives a letter from Ramsay Snow which claims that Stannis has been killed in battle. Ramsay demands that Jon relinquish Selyse, Shireen, and Melisandre.[8] Narbert and Benethon attend Jon's speech in the Shieldhall, but Selyse herself does not. Patrek is killed by Wun Wun outside Hardin's Tower while trying to get to Val, and Jon is attacked in the mutiny at Castle Black.[8]\n\nSelyse's name is once misspelled as \"Selsye\" in A Storm of Swords.[27]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nSelyse is as tall as her husband, Stannis Baratheon.[5] Pinched and hard,[6] she is thin of body and face, with pale eyes, a sharp nose, and the Florent trait of too-large ears.[5] Selyse has thin lips,[7] and hair grows on her upper lip despite her plucking it daily.[5] Her smile can be thin[8] or as bright and brittle as her jewelry.[5] Her mouth is stern and her voice a whip.[5][6] Selyse is not considered a particularly attractive woman.[9]\n\nSelyse and Stannis have a loveless marriage, and the two have little patience for each other.
