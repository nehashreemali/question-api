  "content": "Euron Greyjoy, known as Crow's Eye[1] and Euron Crow's Eye,[3] is a member of House Greyjoy and is the eldest of Lord Balon Greyjoy's younger brothers.\n\nEuron is captain of the Silence, a ship crewed entirely by mutes whose tongues he ripped out. The personal coat of arms of the Crow's Eye is a red eye with a black pupil beneath a black iron crown supported by two crows.[7]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Euron is portrayed by Pilou Asbæk.\n\nA handsome man, Euron is the most comely of the sons of the late Lord Quellon Greyjoy.[6] He has pale skin, black hair, and a neat dark beard.[6]\n\nEuron wears a black leather patch over his left eye,[6] and sometimes a red leather eyepatch.[8] He is nicknamed Crow's Eye, possibly because the leather patch conceals a \"black eye shining with malice\", per his nephew, Theon Greyjoy.[9] Euron's right eye is as blue as the summer sky and is called his \"smiling eye\".[6] Additionally, since Euron has begun drinking shade of the evening, his lips have turned blue.[8]\n\nEuron has a black reputation.[10] He is considered cunning[2] and mocking,[6][8] and has a glib tongue.[8] The Crow's Eye is hated by his brothers Aeron,[3] who considers him godless, and Victarion, as Euron impregnated his third wife.[6]\n\nDespite his dangerous and mercurial nature, Euron has little trouble in drawing men to his service, especially freaks and fools.[11] While most ironborn captains keep the lion's share of plunder, Euron takes almost nothing for himself.[12] Victarion thinks of Euron's supporters as his pets.[6]\n\nWhen he was a boy, Euron had a dream that he could fly.[8] He often mocked his younger brother Victarion when they were children.[13] Another brother, Aeron, has terrible memories associated with Euron and the sound of a rusted iron hinge.[6]\n\nBalon Greyjoy and his younger brothers, Euron and Victarion, convinced their father, Lord Quellon Greyjoy, to join Robert's Rebellion, and they raided the Reach late in the war. After Quellon was killed in a battle at the Mander, however, the new Lord Balon returned to the Iron Islands with his brothers.[3][14]\n\nRejecting the authority of the Iron Throne, Balon declared himself King of the Iron Islands in 289 AC. At the outset of Greyjoy's Rebellion, Euron concocted a plan to sail into Lannisport and burn the Lannister fleet at anchor. Led by Victarion, the Iron Fleet followed Euron's plan and destroyed the westerlands' naval force.[2] Balon's rebellion was eventually defeated by King Robert I Baratheon, however.[15]\n\nEuron has often gone reaving.[6] In 297 AC, he was sent away from the Iron Islands by Lord Balon as punishment for seducing or raping Victarion's third wife, a salt wife, and he was warned never to return while Balon was alive. Victarion would have killed Euron if not for the taboo against kinslaying.[3] Euron laughed at Victarion when they parted.[6]\n\nEuron has several sons born to whores and captured women, but does not have any regard for his bastards. One such boy is ten years old with woolly hair and skin the color of mud.[8]\n\nSince Euron's banishment, the Silence has sailed, pillaged, and raped all over the known world. Euron boasts to have travelled to Asshai and even sailed the Smoking Sea and walked the smoking ruins of Valyria.[16] Euron also claims to have owned a dragon egg which a Myrish wizard was unable to hatch.[8] The Crow's Eye alleges he tossed the egg into the sea during one of his foul moods.[8]\n\nSailing on Silence, Euron is an outlaw, pirate, and raider.[1]\n\nHaving returned to Pyke for the first time since Greyjoy's Rebellion, Theon Greyjoy notes that his uncle Euron's ship, Silence, is not in the fleet gathered at Lordsport by his father, Lord Balon Greyjoy.[17][2]\n\nNews comes to Robb Stark, King in the North, via the captain of the Myraham that Balon, self-styled King of the Isles and the North, fell to his death from Pyke. Euron returned to Lordsport and claimed the Seastone Chair. When Lord Sawane Botley objected to his claim, Euron had him drowned in a cask of seawater.[10]\n\nEuron claims to have captured a galleas out of Qarth that held four warlocks,[8] including Pyat Pree,[5] When one warlock threatened him, Euron killed the man and fed him to the other three, who he now holds hostage.[8] The ship had a cask of shade of the evening, the wine of warlocks, which Euron took up drinking.[8] According to a semi-canon source, he also seized the warlocks' dragon horn.[18]\n\nAeron Greyjoy is informed that his elder brother, Euron, returned to the Iron Islands the day after Balon's death and seized the Seastone Chair. The Damphair calls for a kingsmoot to contest Euron.[3] The timing of Euron's return is questioned by Asha Greyjoy and Lord Rodrik Harlaw.[11] Sawane's son Tristifer reports that the Crow's Eye has been bribing supporters with treasure.[11]\n\nEuron mocks his younger brothers, Victarion and Aeron, and his niece, Asha, when he meets his kin at Nagga's Cradle.[6] During the kingsmoot on Old Wyk, Euron has Cragorn blow the dragon horn, which Euron claims he found in the feared ruins of Valyria, and he brags about having sailed all over the known world, including Asshai. Euron promises to conquer all of Westeros for the ironborn using dragons, which he claims he can bind to his will with the horn.[16] Although Aeron considers the Crow's Eye to be a godless man, Euron is elected king, besting his Victarion, Asha, and other contenders.[16]\n\nAsha flees from Old Wyk, and Aeron disappears after promising to raise smallfolk in rebellion.[8] Euron gives plunder from throughout the known world to the ironborn captains.[8] The Crow's Eye has Lord Baelor Blacktyde killed when the man refuses to accept him as his king, taking Baelor's sable cloak as a trophy.[8] Cragorn dies with charred lungs.[8]\n\nEuron begins raids upon the Reach, intending to sell captives into slavery in Essos. After the taking of the Shields, Euron holds a victory's feast in Lord Hewett's castle with the tied and gagged Lord Humfrey Hewett seated next to him. The Crow's Eye forces Humfrey's daughters and granddaughters to serve food and drink to the victorious ironborn. Euron takes Humfrey's bastard daughter, Falia Flowers, as a bedmate, and under her suggestion commands the noble-born ladies to strip and serve his men naked.[8]\n\nEuron weakens possible rivals by giving lands and titles to key followers of theirs. However, he fails to move the ironborn beyond raiding, as they are reluctant to embark on a dangerous journey in search of dragons after Lord Harlaw points out all the hazards of such an endeavor. Euron sends Victarion and the Iron Fleet to find Daenerys Targaryen, court her in his name, and bring her and her dragons to Westeros. He tells Victarion that he can succeed him on the Seastone Chair after Euron takes the Iron Throne.[8]\n\nIronborn attack the Mander,[19] the Arbor,[19] and reach the Whispering Sound.[7] Queen Regent Cersei Lannister tasks Ser Loras Tyrell with resolving the siege of Dragonstone so that the Redwyne fleet can be freed to deal with the ironborn.[19]\n\nEuron styles himself King of the Iron Islands and the North,[20] although he ignores Balon's conquests in the north, including Moat Cailin, Deepwood Motte, and Torrhen's Square.[21] With Asha Greyjoy having fled the Iron Islands for Deepwood, Euron weds her to Erik Ironmaker using a seal as her proxy.[21]\n\nBefore Victarion Greyjoy departs with the Iron Fleet for Meereen, Euron gives him Maester Kerwin,[13] an unnamed dusky woman,[13], and the dragon horn.[22] Victarion plans to claim Queen Daenerys Targaryen as his own bride instead of bringing her to the Crow's Eye.[13] During his voyage east, Victarion remembers that \"Euron's gifts are poisoned\" when he hears Moqorro, a rescued red priest, state that those who blow the horn die.[22]\n\nEuron has his mutes capture Aeron Damphair after the kingsmoot, and imprisons him in the belly of the Silence. Euron admits to causing the deaths of Harlon, Robin, and Balon, making him a kinslayer. He also admits he expects the followers to which he granted the Shield Islands to fail to hold them, thus ridding himself of potential enemies. Euron no longer wears his driftwood crown, but instead wears an iron crown with points made from shark teeth. He forces Aeron to drink shade of the evening, and the Damphair has visions of Euron on a throne of skulls and then a bloody Iron Throne, with gods impaled on its spikes. A later vision sees Euron as a kraken-like figure with a tentacled face, seated on the Iron Throne, with a shadow woman by his side.\n\nPrior to sailing against the Redwyne fleet and the ships of House Hightower, Euron wears a suit of black scale armor with various patterns, glyphs, and arcane symbols. Aeron believes it to be made of Valyrian steel.[12]\n\nEuron has Aeron bound to the prow of the Silence, where he is joined by Falia, pregnant but tongueless. Euron also orders his captains to bind the priests and septons and warlocks he has kidnapped to the prows of their respective ships.[12]\n\nThis page uses content from the English Wikipedia.
