  "content": "Alliser Thorne is a knight from House Thorne who now serves as the master-at-arms of the Night's Watch at Castle Black. While capable, he is bitter and humorless, and is particularly hated by many recruits of the Night's Watch who have been trained by him.[3]\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Alliser is portrayed by Owen Teale.\n\nAlliser is a slim man of fifty years with sharp features.[4][5] Jon Snow considers him spare and hard,[4] as well as compact and sinewy.[6] Alliser's black eyes[7] resemble onyx,[4] obsidian,[8] and flint,[6] and his black hair is streaked with grey.[4][5] He can have a thin smile[7] and a sharp[4] voice, cold[9] and flinty.[10]\n\nThe knight is humorless, bitter, and mean spirited,[11][9][12] but more clever and dangerous than Janos Slynt.[6][13] Jon and Tyrion Lannister both consider Alliser to be a poor instructor.[11]\n\nAlliser wears crisp black leathers[4] with his fur-trimmed cloak and polished boots.[6] He carries a longsword.[14]\n\nPrior to joining the Night's Watch, Alliser was a knight who fought on the side of House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion. Following the Sack of King's Landing and the defeat of the Targaryens, surviving knights[2] like Alliser and Ser Jaremy Rykker were given the choice by Lord Tywin Lannister between death or taking the black.[11]\n\nAs master-at-arms responsible for training new recruits, Ser Alliser gives Jon Snow the mocking nickname \"Lord Snow\". His disdain turns into hatred when Jon replies to one of his mockeries, provoking the hilarity of the whole common room of Castle Black.[4] The humorless Alliser takes the mockeries of Tyrion Lannister poorly when Tyrion is invited to the table of the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, Jeor Mormont, during his visit to the Wall.[11]\n\nAt Winterfell, Yoren refers to Jon as \"Ser Alliser's bane\".[15]\n\nAlliser has disdain for the cowardly Samwell Tarly, a new recruit who refuses to defend himself during sparring sessions. Jon Snow befriends Sam, however, and convinces other recruits not to beat Sam despite Alliser's orders.[9]\n\nWhen Jon is appointed to the stewards instead of the rangers, Alliser appears so delighted that Jon thinks he is behind it. Sam, however, explains to Jon that the appointment indicates Jon will be trained by Jeor in command.[8]\n\nAlliser never misses an occasion to provoke the young bastard. The evening Jon learns of the imprisonment of his father, Lord Eddard Stark, in King's Landing for treason, Alliser's jeers anger Jon, who tries to attack him with a knife, before being stopped and put under arrest.[16]\n\nThis hostility between Alliser and Jon, and the master-at-arms' old friends who are well-placed at court, lead Lord Commander Mormont to send Alliser to the new king, Joffrey I Baratheon. Alliser is to show the severed hand of Jafer Flowers, who turned into a wight, to the court.[17]\n\nSer Endrew Tarth takes Alliser's place as the master-at-arms of Castle Black.[17]\n\nThoren Smallwood, considered one of Alliser's henchmen by Jon Snow, wants to succeed the missing Benjen Stark as First Ranger.[18]\n\nAlliser sails from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea[17] to King's Landing, where he asks for an audience. Tyrion Lannister, now the acting Hand of the King, remembering his dislike for Alliser, delays a meeting, however, and has Bronn find poor quarters in the Red Keep for the visitor.[12]\n\nWhen Alliser eventually appears before the small council in the throne room, Jafer's hand has rotted away to bones and Alliser's story of wights is mocked by Tyrion. The Hand allows for word to be put out in King's Landing that the Night's Watch is in need of men. When Tyrion dismisses Alliser from court, he asks the knight to give his regards to Lord Commander Mormont and Jon Snow.[5]\n\nAlliser serves as the new master-at-arms of Eastwatch.[19] He falls in with Janos Slynt,[2] who has been exiled to the Watch by Tyrion.[20]\n\nAlliser, Janos, Ser Glendon Hewett, and other men from Eastwatch travel to Castle Black during the battle beneath the Wall. They accuse Jon, who has been leading the defense against the wildlings of Mance Rayder, of being a turncloak and an oathbreaker, and the captive Rattleshirt verifies that Jon had killed Qhorin Halfhand.[6] To prove he is not a traitor, Jon is sent by Alliser to assassinate Mance in a meeting north of the Wall. The meeting is interrupted by the arrival of Stannis Baratheon's host, however.[21]\n\nDuring the choosing for a new Lord Commander after Jeor's death, Alliser comes in sixth in voting on the first day and loses votes on the second day, as many black brothers resent having been trained by him. He withdraws his name and decides to support Janos.[3] Alliser expects Othell Yarwyck, the First Builder, to support Janos as well, but a reluctant Othell shocks Alliser by instead mentioning Jon Snow, who is soon after elected as the new Lord Commander.[10]\n\nAlliser complains that Jon's election was overseen by the blind Maester Aemon with Jon's friend, Sam Tarly, by his side.[22]\n\nTo separate Janos Slynt and Alliser, Jon appoints Janos to command the garrison at Greyguard. When Janos refuses to obey orders, Jon personally beheads him with Longclaw. Alliser is present when the sentence is given but does not interfere, much to Jon's disappointment.[7]\n\nAlliser opposes Jon's decision to let wildlings pass south of the Wall, although Jon thinks the master-at-arms has become more circumspect after Janos's execution.[23]\n\nJon later orders Alliser to accompany Dywen and another seasoned ranger in scouting beyond the Wall. Alliser is angry, but accepts the mission, not wanting to give Jon cause to execute him as well. He then states that he will return from the ranging, one way or the other.[14]\n\nJon is troubled that Alliser's friend, Glendon Hewett, commands at Eastwatch while Cotter Pyke is away.[24]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nAlliser is a slim man of fifty years with sharp features.[4][5] Jon Snow considers him spare and hard,[4] as well as compact and sinewy.[6] Alliser's black eyes[7] resemble onyx,[4] obsidian,[8] and flint,[6] and his black hair is streaked with grey.[4][5] He can have a thin smile[7] and a sharp[4] voice, cold[9] and flinty.[10]\n\nThe knight is humorless, bitter, and mean spirited,[11][9][12] but more clever and dangerous than Janos Slynt.[6][13] Jon and Tyrion Lannister both consider Alliser to be a poor instructor.[11]\n\nAlliser wears crisp black leathers[4] with his fur-trimmed cloak and polished boots.[6] He carries a longsword.[14]\n\n\n## History\n\n\nPrior to joining the Night's Watch, Alliser was a knight who fought on the side of House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion.
