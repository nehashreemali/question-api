  "content": "Varys, also known as the Spider, is the master of whisperers on the small council of King Robert I Baratheon,[7] a position he previously held for King Aerys II Targaryen.[8] In the television adaptation Game of Thrones he is played by Conleth Hill.[9]\n\nVarys is a plump, bald eunuch with soft hands and round shoulders.[10][11] He powders his hands and round face[11][2][12] and uses perfumes of lavender,[13][14] lilac,[15] and rosewater.[16]\n\nWhen at court, Varys wears rich silk, velvet, and damasks.[15] His attire includes on one occasion a vest of woven gold thread over a purple silk gown,[1] and a lavender brocade on another.[17] His robes include patterned damask[18] and flowing lavender,[19] and his pointed slippers of soft velvet[1] allow him to move silently.[20][21] Varys clads himself in black when mourning.[10]\n\nVarys's outward manner is effeminate,[10] obsequious, mysterious, and scrupulous.[22] He has sly and unctuous smiles,[23][24] and he presents himself as afraid of blood[1] and disapproving of violence.[25] Varys often titters.[19][26][27] He usually speaks in a cloying tone, but he can sound as sharp as a whip when needed.[15]\n\nAs a trained mummer, Varys is a master of disguise and can alter his voice, gait, smell, and overall appearance, employing different wardrobes, make-up and wigs, to become unrecognizable.[15][28][12]\n\nSecrets are Varys's trade, and his skill at acquiring them has earned him a reputation for being seemingly omniscient. According to Tyrion Lannister and Lord Petyr Baelish, Varys has informers everywhere.[29][30] Crucial to his trade is a spy network of children whom he refers to as his little mice (in Pentos)[31] or little birds (in Westeros).[1]\n\nVarys's history of providing information to all sides, of aiding enemies, of pitting rivals against one another, and of manipulation to achieve his ends has earned him a reputation of being distasteful and untrustworthy among the nobles at court.[3][19] In private, however, he claims to value order, stability, and peace above all, and professes loyalty to those who work for those goals as well.[22][11]\n\nLord Varys is not a true lord, but he is addressed as such as a courtesy for being a member of the small council.[1][17] As the master of whisperers, he has the task of fostering division amongst the enemies of the Iron Throne,[32] and gathering information on all that happens in the realm.\n\nVary's small and spare apartments are three snug windowless chambers under the north wall of the Red Keep, and he sleeps on a stone bed.[12]\n\nAccording to Grand Maester Pycelle, Varys was born as a slave in Lys.[3]\n\nVarys says he was apprenticed as an orphan to a troupe of mummers who worked the Free Cities, Oldtown, and occasionally King's Landing. During their stay in Myr, a certain man offered a large sum of money for Varys, an offer his master found too tempting to refuse. The man gave Varys a potion that made him powerless to move or speak, but did nothing to dull his senses as his manhood was cut off at the stem, then burnt in a brazier in a blood magic ritual. Years later Varys would recall a voice in a language he didn't understand emerged from the flames. The man had no further use for Varys and tossed him out on the streets alone to die, Varys out of spite for the sorcerer vowed to live. Varys claims to have held a hatred for all things magical ever since.[28] He resorted to begging, prostitution, and thievery, eventually becoming the best thief in Myr, until a rival forced him out and he fled to Pentos.[28][31]\n\nImpoverished and despised in Pentos, Varys made an agreement with a poor bravo, Illyrio Mopatis. Varys would steal objects from lesser thieves and Illyrio would get the objects back for their original owners for a small fee. Soon, everyone in Pentos who ever had valuables stolen from them knew who to ask to get their belongings back, and the thieves knew who to sell the stolen goods items. Varys and Illyrio quickly grew rich. Realizing the value of information, Varys began training his spy network to acquire the information, letters, ledgers and charts of the wealthy and powerful.  The little mice were agile orphans purchased by Varys.[31]\n\nTheir trade in information increased Varys and Illyrio's wealth tenfold, and in time Varys became so infamous that word of his talents reached the ears of King Aerys II Targaryen in Westeros across the narrow sea. In his growing paranoia, Aerys no longer trusted his son, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, his wife, Queen Rhaella Targaryen, or his Hand of the King, Lord Tywin Lannister.[31]\n\nVarys was brought to Aerys's court at some point after the death of Lord Steffon Baratheon in 278 AC.[33] As a spymaster in King's Landing, Varys's influence grew with Aerys's increasing paranoia. According to Ser Barristan Selmy, \"the rot in King Aerys's reign began with Varys\",[34] while Maester Yandel would count Varys among the \"lickspittle lords\" that surrounded the king.[35] Varys was always quick to point out any traitors Aerys might have missed,[36]. He used the crown's gold to create his spy network,[33] whom he called his \"little birds\". Varys mastered the secret passages within the Red Keep. Varys alerted Aerys to the possibility that his son Rhaegar was using attendance at the tourney at Harrenhal as a pretext to rally lords to his cause in removing Aerys as king.[37] This caused Aerys to attend the tournament, the first time he had left the Red Keep since the Defiance of Duskendale, four years prior.[37]\n\nFollowing Rhaegar's defeat during the Battle of the Trident near the end of Robert's Rebellion, Varys counseled King Aerys against opening the city gates[36] when Tywin Lannister appeared at King's Landing with an army of twelve thousand men.[8] Aerys, however, decided to listen to Grand Maester Pycelle and opened his gates to the Lannister forces. The Mad King was then killed by Ser Jaime Lannister of his own Kingsguard during the Sack of King's Landing.[36]\n\nVarys, Grand Maester Pycelle, and Ser Jaime Lannister were pardoned during the coronation of Robert I Baratheon,[38] and Varys was allowed to remain master of whisperers for the new king.[34] In Robert's name, Varys sends gifts such as swords, ponies, and fur-trimmed cloaks to Edric Storm, the king's bastard being raised at Storm's End.[34]\n\nVarys has reported on Viserys Targaryen's movements for years,[39] and he informed the small council that Selyse Florent had taken up with a red priest.[40]\n\nOne of Varys's spies, Ser Jorah Mormont, sends word from Essos that the exiled Princess Daenerys Targaryen has wed Khal Drogo. Varys sends a rider to inform King Robert I Baratheon, who is returning from Winterfell with his new Hand of the King, Lord Eddard Stark.[8] In King's Landing, Varys tells Catelyn Stark he does not recognize the Valyrian steel dagger used to attack her son Bran at Winterfell. Lord Petyr Baelish, however, claims to have once owned it and then lost it to Tyrion Lannister.[1]\n\nEddard dislikes Varys during his first meeting with the small council,[2] finding him unnerving.[3] After the Hand's tourney, however, Varys disguises himself and, bypassing Ned's guards, meets Lord Stark at his chambers in the Tower of the Hand. He warns Eddard that Queen Cersei Lannister is trying to kill King Robert. He states that his goal is peace and stability and professes to assist Lord Stark in his investigations against House Lannister. Varys also reveals that the former hand, Lord Jon Arryn, was poisoned with the tears of Lys.[15]\n\nIn the depths of the Red Keep, Arya Stark observes a disguised Varys meeting with Magister Illyrio Mopatis, who is asking to delay a war between Houses Stark and Lannister until the right time. Arya does not recognize the men, and Eddard believes the two are merely mummers when told about them by his daughter.[41]\n\nVarys brings Jorah's report of Daenerys being pregnant to the small council, which results in Robert's command to assassinate both her and her unborn child.[23] When Robert goes hunting in the kingswood, Varys attends court while Eddard sits the Iron Throne in the king's absence.[25]\n\nWhen King Robert is wounded while hunting a boar, Eddard orders Varys to halt the attempts on Daenerys's life.[20] Varys is in attendance when Cersei has Eddard arrested in the throne room.[13]\n\nAfter Robert dies from his wounds, Varys remains master of whisperers for the new king, Joffrey I Baratheon. When Joffrey demands that someone take the blame for his father's death, Varys suggests Ser Barristan Selmy.[24] Joffrey and Cersei dismiss Barristan from the Kingsguard, a move many outside the council see as a folly.[21]\n\nVarys visits Eddard in the black cells disguised as a gaoler. Varys persuades Ned that for the sake of his daughter, Sansa Stark, he must falsely confess to treason so Cersei will allow him to take the black, thus delaying a war between Stark and Lannister.[22] Despite Varys's intentions to spare Lord Stark's life, however, King Joffrey goes against the council's wishes and decides at the last minute to have Ned executed, much to the shock of Varys and the other onlookers at the Great Sept of Baelor.[18]\n\nTyrion Lannister acts as Hand of the King while his father, Lord Tywin Lannister, is on campaign during the War of the Five Kings. When Tyrion visits his lover, Shae, at the Broken Anvil, he finds that Varys is already aware of her presence in King's Landing.[24] Although Tywin had forbidden Tyrion from bringing Shae to the capital,[42] Tyrion settles her in a manse near the Iron Gate.[19][43]\n\nAn uneasy alliance forms between Varys and Tyrion, with the master of whisperers providing the Hand with information.[19][40] Varys assists Tyrion in gaining control of the City Watch of King's Landing and informs him that Ser Lancel Lannister is sleeping with his cousin, Queen Cersei.[19][44] Varys and Ser Jacelyn Bywater unsuccessfully search for the missing Arya Stark.[45]\n\nVarys assists Tyrion in protecting Shae, setting a up a secret route from Chataya's brothel so Tyrion can visit her and keep her true identity secret from Tyrion's sister, Cersei,[40] and finding bodyguards for Tyrion's lover.[44] During their work together, Varys reveals to Tyrion the origins of how he became castrated as a eunuch.[44] It is also revealed that Varys was the one who sent Gendry with Yoren to join the Night's Watch, so the boy would not be killed by Cersei's agents simply for the crime of being the late King Robert's bastard.[19] Varys later helps guide Shae through the chamber of the dragon mosaic to surprise Tyrion in the Tower of the Hand.[46]\n\nAfter Tyrion Lannister recovers from the Battle of the Blackwater, he resumes his alliance with Varys, which includes assistance in continuing Tyrion's trysts with Shae.[12][29] Tyrion's father Tywin resumes the position of Hand of the King, and Tyrion instead becomes master of coin to replace Petyr Baelish.[47]\n\nVarys attends Tywin's meeting with the small council,[48] and Tywin and Varys discretely have Ser Gregor Clegane, Ser Samwell Spicer, and the brothers Plumm search for Ser Jaime Lannister after Tywin's eldest son disappears from captivity at Riverrun.[49]\n\nTyrion is put on trial for the murder of King Joffrey I Baratheon at his royal wedding. Varys testifies against Tyrion, providing detailed notes on conversations between the two and a great deal of seemingly-damning evidence.[16] Varys offers a reward for Sansa Stark, Tyrion's wife who went missing during the wedding,[49] and he sends fishermen to report on Stannis Baratheon's remaining strength at Dragonstone.[50]\n\nAfter Tyrion is condemned to die, Varys is forced at knifepoint by Jaime to help release his convicted brother, Tyrion,[14] and Varys drugs the gaolers with sweetsleep.[51] During the trip through the secret tunnels beneath the Red Keep, Varys leads Tyrion past a ladder that the dwarf recognizes as leading to the chamber of the Hand in the Tower of the Hand. Tyrion ascends the ladder to kill his father, Tywin.[51]\n\nDuring the siege of Meereen, Ser Barristan Selmy reveals to Queen Daenerys Targaryen's horror that Ser Jorah Mormont has been spying on her on behalf of Varys and the small council for gold and in hopes of gaining a royal pardon. Barristan tells her that she is watched and since the day of her wedding to Khal Drogo there has been an informer at her side.[52] After Meereen is taken, Jorah confesses he took the eunuch's gold and learned some ciphers and wrote some letters. He admits to Daenerys he had suspected that the wine intended for her in Vaes Dothrak had been poisoned after reading a letter from Varys brought there by caravan. Jorah tells her that Varys wanted her watched, but not harmed. The knight hoped his spying for Varys would allow him to return to Westeros, but Daenerys banishes Jorah for his betrayal.[53]\n\nCersei Lannister sends Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard to find Varys after her father's body is found, but the spymaster has vanished from the Red Keep without a trace. A dungeon turnkey named Rugen disappears as well.[54] In Rugen's living space a coin from House Gardener is discovered and shown to Cersei, increasing her mistrust of House Tyrell, who had replaced the Gardeners in the Reach during Aegon's Conquest.[55] Rugen is one of Varys's disguises.[56]\n\nCersei, now ruling in King's Landing as Queen Regent to her son, King Tommen I Baratheon, appoints Qyburn to fill the position of master of whisperers. Qyburn notes that many of Varys's spies came to him with secrets to sell, reinforcing Cersei's belief that Varys had always oversold his value.[57]\n\nSer Jaime Lannister thinks that Varys fled to the narrow sea with Tyrion, and he also considers the possibility that his brother had murdered Varys and left his body beneath the Red Keep.[58] Jaime begins to suspect that Varys might have had a hand in the disappearance of Tyrek Lannister, once one of King Robert's squires, during the riot of King’s Landing.[59]\n\nSer Shadrich searches for Sansa Stark in hopes of winning the gold offered as a reward by Varys.[60]\n\nVarys has Tyrion Lannister smuggled across the narrow sea to Pentos, where Tyrion meets Varys's old friend, Magister Illyrio Mopatis.[61] Tyrion learns that during Robert's Rebellion, Varys, a Targaryen loyalist, allegedly switched the baby Aegon with that of a peasant baby. With the realm believing the prince had died during the Sack of King's Landing, Varys had Aegon smuggled to Essos to be raised by Lord Jon Connington, the exiled Hand of the King and the friend of Aegon's father, Prince Rhaegar. To conceal Jon's activities, Varys concocted the false story that Jon had drank himself to death in Lys after being caught stealing from the Golden Company.[62][27] Varys, Illyrio, and the Golden Company now plot to wed the teenaged Aegon to Daenerys Targaryen, Queen of Meereen, and place him on the Iron Throne.[61][31][27] The landing of the Golden Company begins in the stormlands.[63]\n\nVarys employs the secret passages of the Red Keep to enter the chambers of Grand Maester Pycelle and kill him. He then dispatches one of his little birds to fetch Ser Kevan Lannister, now Lord Regent after Cersei's disgrace, under the pretext that the Grand Maester has a message for him. Varys shoots Kevan with a crossbow, going on to apologize and note that his actions are not out of malice but rather because Kevan's competent leadership threatens to undo Cersei's follies and years of Varys's careful planning. Kevan's death will sow further dissent between the Lannisters and Tyrells, making the realm easy prey for Aegon to arrive and be proclaimed king, for the good of the realm. Varys then summons several of his little birds to end Kevan's suffering.[64]\n\nVarys employs the use of various disguises to go about unnoticed. These include:\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nVarys is a plump, bald eunuch with soft hands and round shoulders.[10][11] He powders his hands and round face[11][2][12] and uses perfumes of lavender,[13][14] lilac,[15] and rosewater.[16]\n\nWhen at court, Varys wears rich silk, velvet, and damasks.[15] His attire includes on one occasion a vest of woven gold thread over a purple silk gown,[1] and a lavender brocade on another.[17] His robes include patterned damask[18] and flowing lavender,[19] and his pointed slippers of soft velvet[1] allow him to move silently.[20][21] Varys clads himself in black when mourning.[10]\n\nVarys's outward manner is effeminate,[10] obsequious, mysterious, and scrupulous.[22] He has sly and unctuous smiles,[23][24] and he presents himself as afraid of blood[1] and disapproving of violence.[25] Varys often titters.[19][26][27] He usually speaks in a cloying tone, but he can sound as sharp as a whip when needed.[15]\n\nAs a trained mummer, Varys is a master of disguise and can alter his voice, gait, smell, and overall appearance, employing different wardrobes, make-up and wigs, to become unrecognizable.[15][28][12]\n\nSecrets are Varys's trade, and his skill at acquiring them has earned him a reputation for being seemingly omniscient.

He then dispatches one of his little birds to fetch Ser Kevan Lannister, now Lord Regent after Cersei's disgrace, under the pretext that the Grand Maester has a message for him. Varys shoots Kevan with a crossbow, going on to apologize and note that his actions are not out of malice but rather because Kevan's competent leadership threatens to undo Cersei's follies and years of Varys's careful planning. Kevan's death will sow further dissent between the Lannisters and Tyrells, making the realm easy prey for Aegon to arrive and be proclaimed king, for the good of the realm. Varys then summons several of his little birds to end Kevan's suffering.[64]\n\n\n## Known Disguises\n\n\nVarys employs the use of various disguises to go about unnoticed.
