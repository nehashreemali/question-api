  "content": "Daemon II Blackfyre, also known as Daemon the Younger,[1] was the third son of Daemon I Blackfyre. He used the alias John the Fiddler, a hedge knight, while traveling incognito through the Seven Kingdoms. He led the brief Second Blackfyre Rebellion.[2]\n\nWhen meeting Daemon under his alias of \"Ser John the Fiddler\", Ser Duncan the Tall thought of him as a young man, lean and lithe, with a handsome clean-shaven face and fine features. He had collar-length black hair, and sparkling eyes that caught the deep blue of his doublet. Dunk later recognized that he had \"Egg's eyes\", that is, dark purple. After revealing himself as the son of Daemon I Blackfyre, Daemon the Younger washed the black dye from his hair to reveal its true silver-gold color.[2]\n\nAs John the Fiddler, Daemon wore a doublet made of dark blue silk edged in gold satin. The doublet's chest was embroidered with gold thread to depict his sigil, an engrailed cross with a golden fiddle and golden sword in the opposite quarters. He also wore a white silk doublet had with dagged sleeves lined with red satin, so long their points drooped down past his knees, and a heavy silver chain studded with large dark amethysts whose color matched his eyes. He also owned a purple tunic that brought out the color of his eyes. John wore enameled blue armor with gilded ringmail,[2] and per a semi-canon source, his helmet was also gilded.[4] His horse's trappings were blue silk with golden fiddles and golden swords. After Daemon revealed himself, the trappings of his warhorse displayed the three-headed dragon of House Blackfyre, black on a field of red.[2] According to a semi-canon source, Daemon's armor was enameled red, with a red helm crested with a black dragon.[4]\n\nAccording to Duncan, Daemon smelled of oranges and limes, with a hint of some strange eastern spice beneath.[2]\n\nDaemon had a love of music and fine things. He had a close relationship with Lord Alyn Cockshaw and appeared to be attracted to Dunk.[2][1] George R. R. Martin has confirmed that Daemon was gay.[5]\n\nDaemon had prophetic dreams. He correctly dreamed that his brothers Aegon and Aemon would die, and that Dunk would become a knight of the Kingsguard. He also dreamed that a dragon would hatch from an egg at Whitewalls, but this turned out to be a metaphor for Aegon \"Egg\" Targaryen revealing himself as a Targaryen prince.[2]\n\nDaemon was born in Westeros, the third son of Daemon I Blackfyre and Rohanne of Tyrosh. He was named after his father.[2] As a child, he became close friends with Alyn Cockshaw, and they were bullied by Daemon's older brothers, Aegon and Aemon. In 196 AC, when he was seven years old, his father began the First Blackfyre Rebellion. Daemon dreamed that Aegon and Aemon would die, and told them this, but they only laughed at him. After the death of Daemon's father and his older brothers at the Battle of the Redgrass Field, Daemon went into exile in Tyrosh with his surviving family and with his uncle Aegor \"Bittersteel\" Rivers.[2][6]\n\nIn Tyrosh, Daemon dreamed that a dragon would be born at Whitewalls. Lord Gormon Peake, a Blackfyre supporter, somehow heard of this, and convinced Daemon to cross the narrow sea and make a play for the Iron Throne. The pretext for gathering other lords to support Daemon was a wedding tourney that Lord Ambrose Butterwell would hold in 212 AC, at which the grand prize would be Butterwell's dragon egg. However, Bittersteel did not think much of Peake's plan, and mistrusted Daemon's dreams (or perhaps was troubled by his homosexuality), and so did not give him his support nor the sword Blackfyre.[2][1]\n\nUnder the guise of the hedge knight Ser John the Fiddler, Daemon happened across Ser Duncan the Tall and Egg while heading to Whitewalls for the tourney. Daemon was very friendly to Dunk, and suggested he come to the tourney. During the wedding feast, he was given a place of honor on the dais, uncommon for someone who was supposed to be a hedge knight. During the bedding, John had Dunk carry the new Lady Butterwell upstairs to the bedroom. Afterwards, Daemon, still under the guise of John, approached Duncan and told him about the dreams he was having, about Duncan wearing a white cloak in the future. He tried to win Duncan over to his side, but Duncan remained unsure, and then they were interrupted by Lord Gormon Peake. Alyn Cockshaw, who had been ecstatic at Daemon's return to Westeros, deeply resented Dunk for the loss of Daemon's attentions, and became his secret enemy.[2]\n\nDuring the tourney, Daemon unseated Ser Franklyn Frey and Ser Galtry the Green, but Dunk discovered that Peake had been bribing Daemon's opponents so that he would win the tourney. The dragon egg went missing, and Ser Glendon Flowers, who had turned down Peake's bribe, was charged with its theft and taken away to be tortured. Duncan learned of Daemon's true identity via Alyn Cockshaw and Maynard Plumm, and that evening approached him at the feast, publicly addressing him as \"Daemon\" and \"Your Grace\", to tell him that Glendon had been framed. Daemon decided to prove his tourney skills, and also give Glendon the power to defend himself against the charges, through a trial by battle with Daemon himself. While Daemon chose a war lance, Duncan suggested to Glendon that he use a tourney lance instead because of its longer length (as he had learned from Prince Baelor Targaryen in his trial of seven at the Ashford Tourney). Glendon, though still suffering from the effects of the torture, unhorsed Daemon in the first tilt of their joust. Daemon landed in a mud puddle, gaining the epithet \"the Brown Dragon\".[2]\n\nNews quickly spread that Lord Brynden Rivers, Bloodraven, was marching on Whitewalls to end what had become the Second Blackfyre Rebellion. Daemon tried to inspire the armsmen who were within the castle, but they had no intention of fighting for such a weak warrior who did not even have Blackfyre. Daemon met the oncoming army alone and challenged Bloodraven to single combat, but was instead arrested by Lord Rivers.[2]\n\nBloodraven kept Daemon alive as a hostage to prevent Aegor Rivers from crowning Daemon's younger brother, Haegon.[2] However, Daemon the Younger died a few years later while a hostage in the Red Keep, and Haegon and Bittersteel launched the Third Blackfyre Rebellion.[1]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nWhen meeting Daemon under his alias of \"Ser John the Fiddler\", Ser Duncan the Tall thought of him as a young man, lean and lithe, with a handsome clean-shaven face and fine features.
