  "content": "Kevan Lannister is a knight from House Lannister and is the younger brother of Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock. He is the POV character for the epilogue of A Dance with Dragons.\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Kevan is portrayed by Ian Gelder.[3]\n\nKevan is a big man with broad shoulders and a thick waist.[4] His short blond hair[4] is balding,[5] and he has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows the line of his massive jaw.[5] Kevan has green eyes and fair skin.[6] A portly man,[5] Kevan is not necessarily considered handsome.[6]\n\nKevan is devoted to his elder brother, Lord Tywin Lannister.[7] Cersei thinks her uncle is tireless, prudent, and reliable,[8] and Tyrion thinks Kevan is solid and steady.[9] Kevan considers the Vale mountain clans to be savages.[5]\n\nDespite not being  a lord, just a household knight, Kevan's strategic thinking, significant retinue, and personal wealth has made him a man of significant standing.[6][10]\n\nKevan dresses near as splendidly as Tywin,[11] clasping his crimson wool cloak with a golden lion's head brooch.[4] Kevan also owns a quilted wool doublet the color of charcoal.[6] He wields a sword.[5]\n\nKevan was a confidant and companion for his elder brother, Tywin since childhood.[12] Recognizing the competency of Tywin at an early age, Kevan did his best to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow.[13] In contrast, Tywin had stormy relations with his other brothers, Tygett and Gerion.[13]\n\nLord Tytos Lannister sent young Kevan to Castamere to serve as a page and then squire to Lord Roger Reyne.[12] Ser Tywin, Kevan, and Tygett fought in the War of the Ninepenny Kings, during which Kevan was knighted by Lord Reyne.[12]\n\nAt sixteen, Kevan visited the Free Cities on his coming of age tour.[14]\n\nUpon the return to Casterly Rock, Ser Tywin charged Kevan with the task of ridding the westerlands of robber knights and bandit outlaws who had taken advantage of the weak rule of their father, Lord Tytos.[12] Tywin also had Kevan collect the outstanding debts owed to Casterly Rock, and those who could not pay immediately had to surrender a family member as a hostage till the debt was settled. As Ser Harys Swyft was not able to pay at the time, he handed his daughter Dorna into Kevan's custody.[15] Kevan would eventually fall in love with Dorna[16] and marry her by 266 AC.[15]\n\nIn contrast to Ser Harys, Lord Roger Reyne refused to pay and Lord Walderan Tarbeck sought out Lord Tytos to convince him to countermand Tywin's actions. Tywin had Walderan imprisoned, however, and in response Lady Ellyn Tarbeck kidnapped Stafford Lannister. Tywin refused to be part of Tytos's negotiations with Ser Reynard Reyne, so Tytos had Kevan exchange Walderan for Stafford at Castamere.[15]\n\nAccording to a semi-canon source, Kevan aided Tywin in suppressing the Reyne-Tarbeck revolt in 261 AC. Ellyn laughed at Kevan when he demanded the surrender of Tarbeck Hall.[17] Ellyn was slain when Tywin attacked the castle, however.[15]\n\nSer Kevan has had four children with his wife: Lancel, twin boys Martyn and Willem, and a daughter, Janei.[18]\n\nTytos Lannister died in 267 AC, making Tywin the new Lord of Casterly Rock. Kevan was Tywin's closest confidant, sharing all of his counsels.[6] As a second son, Kevan became a household knight and served his older brother, though this meant he held no lands of his own. Kevan did hold certain incomes and was frequently rewarded by Tywin for his good service despite his lack of status, and he set aside chests of coin from this and his generous inheritance from his late father, Lord Tytos Lannister.[6]\n\nIn 274 AC, the Princess of Dorne and her children, Oberyn and Elia Martell, came to Casterly Rock to see Lady Joanna Lannister. Unfortunately, their visit came shortly after Joanna died giving birth to Tyrion Lannister. Tywin, in his grief, placed Kevan in charge of entertaining their Dornish guests.[19]\n\nKevan is remembered by his nephew, Jaime, as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.[20] He fought in a melee at King's Landing, but was thrown from his horse by Thoros of Myr, whose flaming sword terrified his horse.[21] Kevan has visited Dragonstone.[10] Kevan has two hundred knights under his command, with gold to hire sellswords and influence to double his numbers.[6] One of his sons, Lancel Lannister, squires for King Robert I Baratheon.[22]\n\nSer Kevan's eldest son, Lancel Lannister, provides strongwine[23] to King Robert I Baratheon as his squire during a hunt in the kingswood, and the king is mortally wounded while drunkenly hunting boar.[24][25] Kevan accompanies his elder brother, Lord Tywin Lannister, when war breaks out in the riverlands after Robert's death. The Lannisters capture Raventree and Harrenhal.[5]\n\nAt the battle on the Green Fork, Kevan commands the center, a large mixed force. Tywin intends the left flank to break and for Kevan to wheel around to crush the advancing northmen against the Green Fork, but the cautious northern commander, Lord Roose Bolton, withdraws rather than fall into this trap. Following their victory, the Lannisters discover that Robb Stark was not present in the battle.[26]\n\nWhile the Lannister army is hurrying south, Robb captures Ser Jaime Lannister, Tywin's eldest son, and Willem Lannister, one of Kevan's twin sons, in the battle in the Whispering Wood,[27] and Robb then relieves Riverrun with the Battle of the Camps. When word reaches the Lannisters at the crossroads inn, Kevan defends Jaime's actions to Ser Harys Swyft.[28] Tywin orders Kevan to command Ser Gregor Clegane, Ser Amory Lorch, and Vargo Hoat to lead their reavers in raiding the riverlands, while Tywin leads the rest of their host to Harrenhal.[28]\n\nAfter the deaths of Ser Cedric Payne and Ser Lorimer the Belly, Kevan takes charge of Podrick Payne[29] and sends him to King's Landing to squire for his nephew, Tyrion Lannister.[30]\n\nQueen Regent Cersei Lannister, Kevan's niece and Robert's widow, has Lancel Lannister granted knighthood[31] and begins sleeping with her cousin.[32] Martyn Lannister, Kevan's other twin son, is captured by Robb Stark, now the King in the North, in the Battle of Oxcross.[33]\n\nKevan accompanies Tywin when the Lannisters depart Harrenhal.[11] They attempt to force their way back to the westerlands, but they are repelled at the Red Fork by Ser Edmure Tully in the Battle of the Fords.[34] The Lannisters then join the Tyrells and defeat Stannis Baratheon in the Battle of the Blackwater, though Ser Lancel is wounded in the fighting.[35] After the battle, Kevan announces some of the rewards for the victors on behalf of King Joffrey in the throne room of the Red Keep.[36] Tywin has Lancel named Lord of Darry[36] per Kevan's request.[6][13]\n\nKing Joffrey I Baratheon appoints Ser Kevan to his small council as master of laws.[37] Kevan pays off and dismisses the remaining guards of his wounded nephew, Tyrion Lannister,[38] and the uncle warmly greets Tyrion when he rejoins the council.[39] Kevan is concerned for Lancel, who was wounded at the Blackwater.[39] During the wedding of Tyrion and Sansa Stark, Kevan dances with Lady Janna Fossoway and Sansa.[40]\n\nAfter Catelyn Stark releases Ser Jaime Lannister from captivity at Riverrun, Lord Rickard Karstark murders Willem Lannister and Tion Frey, two of Robb's prisoners, to avenge Jaime's killing of Torrhen and Eddard Karstark in the Whispering Wood.[41] With Willem now dead, Martyn still a captive, and Lancel weakened, Kevan becomes consumed by worry and grief. As a result, Tywin relies on Tyrion more than he would prefer.[9] Robb agrees to exchange Martyn for Robett Glover.[42]\n\nKevan is present when news of the Red Wedding is received. He is appalled by Joffrey's statement that he wants the head of Robb so he can serve it to his sister, Sansa, at his own wedding to Margaery Tyrell, a request that Tywin refuses to grant.[43]\n\nKevan gives Joffrey a magnificent red leather jousting saddle for his wedding.[44] He escorts Lady Olenna Tyrell during the wedding procession and is pleased at the wedding feast when Sansa praises Lancel's valor.[45] Joffrey chokes to death during the feast,[45] and Tyrion is accused of regicide and kinslaying.[7]\n\nKevan reluctantly believes that his nephew is guilty, although Tyrion denies involvement. Tyrion names Sansa as a witness to his defense, but Kevan is unable to find her in King's Landing.[7] In fact, Lord Petyr Baelish and Olenna conspired to poison the king, and Petyr smuggled the unsuspecting Sansa to the Vale of Arryn.[46] Kevan visits Tyrion nightly and relays Tywin's offer that Tyrion admit guilt and join the Night's Watch, but Tyrion instead insists on trial by combat. Kevan attends the duel, during which Tyrion's champion, Prince Oberyn Martell, is slain by Ser Gregor Clegane.[47]\n\nKevan has King Tommen I Baratheon sign documents in the aftermath of the Red Wedding. He unsuccessfully attempts to mend the breach between Tywin and Jaime.[48] Varys and Jaime free Tyrion before he is to be executed; Tyrion then kills Tywin with a crossbow in the Tower of the Hand.[49]\n\nWhen the body of Lord Tywin Lannister is discovered, Ser Kevan is one of the first to be notified of his brother's death. He prays by the bedside of his brother,[8] shaken and wearied by the murder. He attends Tywin's funeral in the Great Sept of Baelor.[6] Lancel, contrite for his involvement in King Robert's death and for having slept with his cousin Cersei,[50] prays with the High Septon[6] and confesses his sins.[50]\n\nCersei, the Queen Regent, offers her uncle the position of Hand of the King. Kevan doubts Cersei's leadership, however, and he reveals Tywin informed him of his plan to send her back to the westerlands as Lady of Casterly Rock with a new husband before his death. Kevan states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him regent for King Tommen I Baratheon as well as Hand and she returns to the Rock. He also advises choosing Lord Mathis Rowan or Lord Randyll Tarly as Hand of the King instead. Cersei refuses Kevan's demands, however, and throws wine in his face when he insults how she raised Joffrey. Kevan insinuates to Cersei[6] and later Jaime[20] that he is aware of the incest between the twins.\n\nCersei appoints two Lannister cousins in positions for which Kevan was better suited; Daven is made Warden of the West and Damion is named castellan of Casterly Rock. Kevan is angered that Daven received the title of warden, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. At Tommen's wedding to Margaery, Cersei suggests that Kevan hunt down the Hound, but he rebuffs her.[51]\n\nKevan heads the escort—one hundred crossbowmen, three hundred men-at-arms, and the lords of the west—that is to return Tywin's body to the westerlands to be buried in Casterly Rock.[20] Cersei appoints Ser Harys Swyft, as Hand of the King. Harys is the father of Dorna Swyft, Kevan's wife, so Cersei keeps him close as a threat against Kevan.[16]\n\nKevan helps his son Lancel restore Castle Darry, the estate Kevan had won for him.[20] He arranges for Lancel to wed Amerei Frey, who has Darry ancestry, so that the smallfolk will more easily accept House Lannister of Darry.[20][50] The now-pious Lancel quarrels with his father, however, and Kevan departs after the wedding. Lancel eventually renounces Darry so that he can join the Warrior's Sons,[50] as Cersei has allowed the Faith Militant to reform.[52]\n\nA brooding Kevan spends three days at the siege of Riverrun while returning west, but he is distant to Daven.[13] Sent by Cersei to pacify the riverlands and resolve Riverun, Jaime discusses Kevan with his aunt, Genna Lannister, the sister of Kevan and Tywin. Genna mentions that Kevan's dutiful nature is evident in Jaime, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.[13]\n\nAfter Cersei is imprisoned by the Faith, Harys and Grand Maester Pycelle send a raven to Casterly Rock offering Kevan the regency.[53]\n\nLord Davos Seaworth is brought before Lord Godric Borrell at Breakwater. Since Kevan is not in control of King Tommen I Baratheon, Godric allows Davos to continue on to White Harbor.[54]\n\nKevan accepts the role of regent to Tommen, returns to King's Landing, and sets about trying to fix the mess that Cersei made. As a concession to House Tyrell, Kevan names Lord Mace Tyrell as Hand of the King, Lord Paxter Redwyne as master of ships, and Lord Randyll Tarly as master of laws.[4]\n\nKevan visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son, Lancel. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.[4] After Cersei confesses to having slept with the Kettleblack brothers,[4] Kevan sends Osmund and Osfryd to the dungeons.[10] In order to appease the High Sparrow and redeem the shame to House Lannister, inspired by what Tywin did to their father's mistress,[10] Kevan has Cersei perform a walk of atonement from the Great Sept of Baelor to the Red Keep. Kevan has Jocelyn Swyft cover the nude Cersei when she arrives at the castle.[55]\n\nKevan discusses with the small council how to deal with Jon Connington and his \"feigned dragon\", Aegon Targaryen, who have invaded the stormlands with the Golden Company. Kevan sends his good-father, Ser Harys Swyft, to Braavos to negotiate the crown's financial problems with the Iron Bank. He is suspicious of Ser Robert Strong, the new member of the Kingsguard produced by Qyburn.[10] He later has supper with the freed Cersei and King Tommen.[10]\n\nAfter dinner, Kevan is told by a servant that Pycelle is seeking him, and in the Grand Maester's chamber Kevan finds a white raven announcing winter's arrival. Varys suddenly shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow, and the wounded Kevan notices that Pycelle has already been slain. Varys explains he bears Kevan no malice, but he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's misrule. With his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe that Kevan was murdered by Tyrion Lannister or House Tyrell. The Tyrells, in turn, will suspect Cersei herself, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne. This would open the way for Prince Aegon to take the throne. Varys then commands his \"little birds\" to finish Kevan off.[10]\n\nKevan Lannister is married to Lady Dorna of House Swyft, with whom he has three sons, Lancel, Willem and Martyn, and a daughter, Janei.\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nKevan is a big man with broad shoulders and a thick waist.[4] His short blond hair[4] is balding,[5] and he has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows the line of his massive jaw.[5] Kevan has green eyes and fair skin.[6] A portly man,[5] Kevan is not necessarily considered handsome.[6]\n\nKevan is devoted to his elder brother, Lord Tywin Lannister.[7] Cersei thinks her uncle is tireless, prudent, and reliable,[8] and Tyrion thinks Kevan is solid and steady.[9] Kevan considers the Vale mountain clans to be savages.[5]\n\nDespite not being  a lord, just a household knight, Kevan's strategic thinking, significant retinue, and personal wealth has made him a man of significant standing.[6][10]\n\nKevan dresses near as splendidly as Tywin,[11] clasping his crimson wool cloak with a golden lion's head brooch.[4] Kevan also owns a quilted wool doublet the color of charcoal.[6] He wields a sword.[5]\n\n\n## History\n\n\n\n## Youth\n\n\nKevan was a confidant and companion for his elder brother, Tywin since childhood.[12] Recognizing the competency of Tywin at an early age, Kevan did his best to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow.[13] In contrast, Tywin had stormy relations with his other brothers, Tygett and Gerion.[13]\n\nLord Tytos Lannister sent young Kevan to Castamere to serve as a page and then squire to Lord Roger Reyne.[12] Ser Tywin, Kevan, and Tygett fought in the War of the Ninepenny Kings, during which Kevan was knighted by Lord Reyne.[12]\n\nAt sixteen, Kevan visited the Free Cities on his coming of age tour.[14]\n\n\n## Reyne-Tarbeck Revolt\n\n\nUpon the return to Casterly Rock, Ser Tywin charged Kevan with the task of ridding the westerlands of robber knights and bandit outlaws who had taken advantage of the weak rule of their father, Lord Tytos.[12] Tywin also had Kevan collect the outstanding debts owed to Casterly Rock, and those who could not pay immediately had to surrender a family member as a hostage till the debt was settled.
