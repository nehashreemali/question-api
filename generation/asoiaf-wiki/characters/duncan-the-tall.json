Duncan then served Aegon after he ascended the Iron Throne, eventually becoming Lord Commander of the Kingsguard for Aegon V.\n\nDuncan's personal arms were a green shooting star above an elm tree proper on sunset,[1][7] but he also briefly used, while competing as a mystery knight in a tournament, the sigil of an unknown knight, \"a hanged man swinging grim and gray beneath a gallows tree.\"[3]\n\nIn the television adaptation A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, Duncan will be portrayed by Peter Claffey.[8]\n\nDuncan was an inch shy of seven feet tall.[1][3] He had thick, shaggy hair which sun-streaked in the summer. After the events at Standfast in 211 AC, he had a dagger scar on his cheek.[2][3] Dunk was strong and quick, and was taught jousting and swordplay.[1] He was better with a sword than with a lance,[3] and even better with an axe or mace.[2]\n\nDuncan had a humble personality, and frequently thought of himself as thick-headed, recalling how Ser Arlan had often said, \"Dunk the lunk, thick as a castle wall\", and referred to him as \"slow as an aurochs\".[1]\n\nHaving grown up in the slums of Flea Bottom, Duncan spoke with a recognizable King's Landing accent.[2]\n\nDuncan's earliest memories were of living as a street urchin in the Flea Bottom slums of King's Landing.[1] His closest friends went by the names of Ferret, Rafe, and Pudding. By his own admission, they were \"little monsters\" with Duncan, at the time still known as \"Dunk\", the worst of all.[3] Sometimes they would sell[2] or even dump[3] pieces of meat of dubious origin to the local pot shops that made the bowls of brown. Dunk was an orphan[1] who never knew either of his parents. It may be that he is a bastard. He believed his father might have been a criminal, and once hoped to someday go to the north and eventually the Wall, where he could perhaps meet some tall old man who looked like him.[2]\n\nSer Arlan of Pennytree, a hedge knight, took Dunk as his new squire three or four years after the death of his previous squire, Roger of Pennytree, during the final battle of the First Blackfyre Rebellion in 196 AC.[N 1][2] He found the young Dunk, aged five or six,[1] in King's Landing chasing a pig and took him on.[3] Arlan raised Dunk, and together they traveled all over Westeros, except the north.[2] Though they never visited Pennytree, where Arlan was from,[3] they served Lord Leo Tyrell at Highgarden during one of the first few years that Dunk served Arlan,[1] visited King's Landing in 205 AC,[3] served Lord Florent for half a year and joined Lord Dondarrion in the hunt for the Vulture King, both in 206 AC, and visited Lannisport in 208 AC,[1] amongst other places. As well, Duncan accompanied Arlan when he was one of several knights hired by a Dornish merchant who wanted to travel from Lannisport to the Prince's Pass in Dorne.[2]\n\nDunk learned sword-fighting from Ser Arlan,[1] though he still recalls his fighting experience from Flea Bottom as well.[1][2] Ever since the first time that Arlan had let Duncan hold a sword, Duncan had dreamt of becoming a knight of the Kingsguard.[3]\n\nDunk was not sure exactly how old he was because he grew up as an abandoned orphan in the streets of King's Landing, and his unusually large height from a young age made it difficult to guess. By 209 AC he loosely thought he must be about 16 or 17 years old, which would place his birth somewhere between 191 to 193 AC.[1]\n\nIn 209 AC, a tourney was to be held at Ashford in the Reach. Ser Arlan of Pennytree died on the way to the castle, however, and after Dunk had buried the hedge knight, he decided to compete in the tourney at Ashford Meadow in Arlan's stead. At an inn along the way, Dunk met a drunken man who claimed to have dreamed about him, and who became distraught at the sight of him. Dunk also met a bald-headed boy who begged Dunk to be allowed to become his squire when Duncan left. Duncan refused, left, and shortly thereafter arrived at Ashford. Duncan made camp, and that evening discovered the bald boy from the inn at his camp. When the boy assumed that Dunk's name was short for Duncan, Dunk agreed, calling himself Ser Duncan the Tall, for his height and because it sounded powerful. The boy claimed to be called \"Egg\" and said he came from King's Landing, causing Dunk to believe the boy was an orphan from Flea Bottom, just like he had been. Because he did not have a squire, Dunk accepted Egg as his squire for the duration of the tourney. That night, in their camp under an elm tree, Dunk saw a green falling star, which he believed was lucky.[1]\n\nOnce at the tourney grounds, Duncan was forced to sell Sweetfoot, one of his horses, and Arlan's old armor, in order to buy armor of his own from Steely Pate. He met a puppeteer named Tanselle, who was performing at a stall on the tourney grounds. The day after Dunk's arrival, he went to register for the tourney, which required knighthood to participate. Identifying himself as Ser Duncan the Tall, Dunk told Plummer, Lord Ashford's steward, how Arlan had knighted him before his death. Several of his thoughts and actions, as well as other facts, however, suggest that his tale is not completely true.[N 2] Plummer suggested that Duncan find someone to vouch for him and return the next day. Unable to find anyone, Duncan returned to the castle the next day, where he accidentally interrupted Prince Baelor and Prince Maekar Targaryen, who were occupied with the missing Princes Daeron and Aegon, two of Maekar's sons. After Duncan explained his problem to the princes, Baelor recalled jousting against Arlan years before, and vouched for Duncan, allowing his participation. Since Dunk's shield displayed the winged chalice arms of the late Ser Arlan, Baelor said he could not bear the sigil himself, as he was not Arlan's trueborn son. Dunk paid Tanselle to paint over the shield with a new design, a green shooting star above an elm tree at sunset; a sunset because Ser Arlan liked them, an elm for the tree by his camp, and a shooting star for the lucky one he had seen.[1]\n\nWhen Tanselle was attacked by Prince Aerion Targaryen, Duncan rushed to her defense, attacking the prince in the process. When Aerion's guards intervened, Egg protected Duncan from further harm by revealing his identity as Prince Aegon. Duncan was arrested and brought to the castle, where Prince Baelor informed him how Prince Daeron had claimed to his father that the missing Aegon had been kidnapped by a robber knight, while Aerion was twisting the puppeteer story into treason. Due to the lies of both Aerion and Daeron, Maekar became furious with Duncan. Baelor was forced to allow Aerion a trial, and Aerion demanded a trial of seven.[1]\n\nWith help from Aegon, Duncan found six allies: Ser Robyn Rhysling, Ser Humfrey Hardyng, Lord Lyonel Baratheon, Ser Humfrey Beesbury, the newly-knighted Raymun Fossoway, and Prince Baelor. Aerion was supported by Daeron, Maekar, Ser Steffon Fossoway, Ser Willem Wylde, Ser Donnel of Duskendale, and Ser Roland Crakehall (Kingsguard), the latter three being knights of the Kingsguard. To his surprise, Duncan discovered that the smallfolk supported him, as he had remembered his vows as a knight[1] (\"protecting the weak and defending the innocent\")[11][12][13] by protecting Tanselle. During the combat, Duncan eventually found himself facing Aerion one on one, and he managed to best Aerion by using his strength and his fighting skills from Flea Bottom. Duncan forced Aerion to yield. As Daeron had already faked his defeat—as he had promised Duncan the day before—Duncan was declared cleared free of all charges.[1]\n\nHumfrey Beesbury was slain in the fighting, and Humfrey Hardyng died from his wounds in the night. Prince Baelor was mortally wounded as well by his own brother, Prince Maekar, leaving Duncan feeling extremely guilty. Maekar offered Duncan a place at Summerhall so his son Aegon could squire for Duncan. While Duncan agreed to take the prince as his squire, he insisted on remaining a hedge knight, convinced it would teach Egg humility. Maekar agreed.[1]\n\nDuncan and Aegon traveled to Dorne, passing through the Prince's Pass and eventually reaching Vaith, where Duncan accidentally insulted Lady Cassella Vaith, the first highborn woman he had ever met. During the crossing of the desert, Duncan's horse Chestnut died,[2] and he and Aegon had to ride double on Thunder.[2] While in 209 AC and 210 AC the Great Spring Sickness ran its course through Westeros, Duncan and Aegon were able to avoid encountering this plague as they were in Dorne, one of the two places where the plague had not come.[2]\n\nDuncan and Aegon took a poleboat down the Greenblood to Planky Town, where they took passage on the galleas White Lady to Oldtown.[2][3] Aboard the ship, Duncan had his first experience of combat at sea when he helped repel some raiders.[3] In Oldtown, Aegon's brother Aemon measured Duncan, and found he was an inch short of seven feet.[2]\n\nAt some point, Duncan and Aegon were gifted a mule, Maester, by one of Aegon's brothers,[2] presumably Aemon.[N 3]\n\nDuncan and Aegon took service with Ser Eustace Osgrey, a poor and broken landed knight, at Standfast in the Reach. Also employed was Ser Bennis of the Brown Shield, an old acquaintance of Duncan from his time with Arlan. Duncan and Bennis discovered that peasants of the widowed Rohanne Webber, Lady of Coldmoat had dammed the Chequy Water. Bennis provoked Rohanne by cutting the cheek of one of her peasants. Duncan and Bennis began training a small levy of peasants for Eustace.\n\nSince Eustace refused to travel to Coldmoat, Duncan went to the castle to try to reason with Lady Webber. Though sexual tension charged their meeting, Rohanne refused Duncan and told him about Eustace's support of Daemon Blackfyre during the Blackfyre Rebellion. Shocked by the revelation, Duncan attempted to leave Eustace's service, but a fire in the nearby woods caused him to suspect that Rohanne had already started her campaign against Eustace.[2]\n\nDuncan knew that the battle was a lost cause. He disbanded Eustace's meager levies, but promised to be by his side when he faced Rohanne. Meeting with her forces, Duncan cut his own cheek, claiming he was the one who attacked Rohanne's peasant. Lady Webber and Ser Eustance refused to back down, however, and they decided upon trial by combat. Duncan represented the elderly Eustace, and Rohanne's champion was her overbearing castellan, Ser Lucas Inchfield. Duncan's wrestling ability compensated for his lack of swordsmanship, and he managed to kill Lucas Longinch, though Duncan received major wounds himself and almost drowned in the stream in which they had been fighting.[2]\n\nAfter recuperating, Duncan discovered that Eustace and Rohanne had settled their differences and decided to marry. Duncan felt rejected, but was confronted by Rohanne shortly before he left. He took one kiss from Rohanne and cut off a length of her signature braid as a keepsake, after which he and Aegon took their leave.[2]\n\nDuncan and Aegon traveled to the riverlands, where they visited Stoney Sept. Though they had been on their way to take up service with Lord Beron Stark against the ironborn on the northern coast, they changed their destination after a chance meeting on the road. They encountered a group led by Gormon Peake, Lord of Starpike, Lord Alyn Cockshaw, and a hedge knight named Ser John the Fiddler. The latter invited Duncan to attend the wedding of Ambrose Butterwell, Lord of Whitewalls to the daughter of Lord Frey, Lord of the Crossing, stating that the victor's prize at the celebratory wedding tourney at Whitewalls was to be a dragon egg. Though the company traveled on without him, Duncan decided to go as well, and he befriended the fellow hedge knights Ser Kyle the Cat, Ser Maynard Plumm, and Ser Glendon Ball on his way to Whitewalls.[3]\n\nAt Whitewalls, Aegon became suspicious about the intentions of the wedding, and he informed Duncan that the majority of the nobles present had fought for House Blackfyre during the Blackfyre Rebellion. Duncan later had an encounter with John the Fiddler, who told him that Duncan had appeared to him in a dream in which Duncan had worn the all white armor of the Kingsguard. The Fiddler said his dreams always came true, stating that he had dreamed his brothers dead once, and though they had not believed him, they had died. The Fiddler also informed Duncan that he had dreamed about a dragon hatching from an egg at Whitewalls.[3]\n\nDuncan entered the joust as the Gallows Knight, a mystery knight named for the hanged man sigil on his shield, which he had bought to replace the one destroyed by the Longinch but had not had time to have painted with his own arms. Duncan was defeated in his first tilt by Ser Uthor Underleaf, who confessed that someone had attempted to bribe him to kill Duncan in the final tilt. Whilst searching for Aegon, Duncan ran into Glendon, who had been far more successful than Duncan during the tourney, and invited him to come north after the tourney, which Glendon declined. Glendon told Duncan that Lord Peake had offered him a place at Starpike, on the condition that Glendon would let the Fiddler win. Glendon had refused, angering Gormon. Duncan next ran into the Fiddler, and began to realize John's true identity, as well as that the tourney had been rigged as to make the Fiddler victorious.[3]\n\nLord Peake accused Glendon Ball of stealing the dragon egg, and the youth was imprisoned. When Duncan attempted to intervene, Alyn Cockshaw pulled him back, telling Duncan to follow him, if he wanted to find Aegon. Alyn attempted to kill Duncan out of jealousy for the attention the Fiddler had shown Duncan. Though injured, Duncan threw Alyn down a well to drown, an action witnessed by Maynard Plumm. Maynard helped Duncan see to his injuries and informed him of Aegon's location.[3]\n\nAegon falsely told Lord Butterwell that he and Duncan were spies sent to investigate the tournament and that his father, Prince Maekar Targaryen, was on his way with an army. Frightened, Ambrose pled for his innocence. Ser Tommard Heddle attempted to seize Aegon in the sept, but was slain by Duncan in the combat that ensued. Duncan ordered Aegon to ride for Maidenpool, and he confronted the Fiddler, calling him by his true name, Daemon. Duncan accused Lord Peake of bribing the contestants in Daemon's favor, and of falsely charging Glendon with the theft of the dragon egg. Furious about the accusations, Daemon challenged Glendon with a joust as a means of trial by combat.[3]\n\nGlendon defeated Daemon Blackfyre easily early the next morning, and moments later a loyalist army led by Lord Brynden Rivers, the Hand of the King, arrived at Whitewalls. Daemon was arrested, and those who had supported him executed or punished, causing the Second Blackfyre Rebellion to be suppressed before it had even begun. Lord Brynden allowed Duncan and Aegon to continue their travels, and hinted as to how the dragon's egg had been stolen, leading Duncan to realize the involvement of the dwarfs who had performed at the wedding.[2]\n\nAn unknown amount of time after Whitewalls, Duncan and Aegon visited Winterfell.[14]\n\nPresumably in honor of Ser Duncan, Prince Aegon Targaryen named his firstborn son and heir Duncan (however, when asked about it, George R. R. Martin refused to answer).[15] Prince Duncan was called \"Duncan the Small\".[16]\n\nIn late 233 AC, after Aegon had ascended the throne as Aegon V Targaryen, Duncan escorted the king's brother, Maester Aemon, to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, where Aemon was going to join the Night's Watch.[17]\n\nDuncan eventually joined the Kingsguard. While it is unknown when exactly he took his vows, the first known mention of him as a Kingsguard knight is in 236 AC.[4]\n\nIn 236 AC, Ser Duncan fought in the Fourth Blackfyre Rebellion and personally slew Daemon III Blackfyre, the Blackfyre Pretender.[4]\n\nIn 239 AC, when Prince Duncan Targaryen broke his betrothal to Lord Lyonel Baratheon's daughter and married a commonborn girl known as Jenny of Oldstones instead, the enraged Lyonel renounced his fealty to the Iron Throne. Duncan served as King Aegon V's champion in the trial by combat, in which he bested Lyonel, thereby ending his short rebellion.[4][18]\n\nIn 252 AC or 253 AC Duncan, by then Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, participated in a winter tourney at King's Landing, where he was defeated by a sixteen-year-old Barristan Selmy.[16]\n\nIn 259 AC, Duncan perished along with King Aegon V and Prince Duncan, among others, in the tragedy of Summerhall.[19][4] Little is known about the events of the tragedy, but it seems that the Lord Commander's valor saved some of the survivors from dying in the great fire that consumed Summerhall.[4]\n\nWhile in the Round Room of White Sword Tower, Ser Jaime Lannister admires previous men who served as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, including Duncan. He also reads Ser Barristan Selmy's entry in the White Book, which states Barristan defeated Duncan during the winter tourney at King's Landing in which Barristan had participated as a mystery knight.[16]\n\nFor unknown reasons, a shield with Dunk's original arms came to reside in the armory of Lord Selwyn Tarth at Evenfall Hall. While at Duskendale, Selwyn's daughter, Brienne, remembering the arms, has them painted on her shield so she can travel the crownlands and riverlands incognito.[20]\n\nMaester Aemon relates that when he joined the Night's Watch, his brother Egg insisted that Ser Duncan accompany him to Eastwatch.[17] Aemon also dreams of his youth in Oldtown, a time when he was drinking at the Quill and Tankard with Egg and \"that big knight he served\".[21]\n\nWhile in the cave of the three-eyed crow, Bran Stark has visions of the past looking through the heart tree in the godswood of Winterfell. Among the visions is a slender brown-haired girl kissing a knight as tall as Hodor,[22] possibly Duncan.\n\nAt the time of the tourney at Ashford Meadow in The Hedge Knight, Dunk owned three horses which he had inherited from Ser Arlan of Pennytree:\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin has stated that readers have met a descendant of Dunk in A Song of Ice and Fire.[6] He later stated that he gave a strong hint to Dunk's descendant in A Feast for Crows.[23] Given that in A Feast for Crows, Brienne recalls finding a shield with Dunk's sigil in the armories of Tarth,[20] it was widely speculated but not confirmed that she is descended from Duncan the Tall. However, in 2016 at Balticon, Martin confirmed Brienne's descent, stating that the exact relationship between Duncan and Brienne would be \"revealed in time\".[24]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nDuncan was an inch shy of seven feet tall.[1][3] He had thick, shaggy hair which sun-streaked in the summer. After the events at Standfast in 211 AC, he had a dagger scar on his cheek.[2][3] Dunk was strong and quick, and was taught jousting and swordplay.[1] He was better with a sword than with a lance,[3] and even better with an axe or mace.[2]\n\nDuncan had a humble personality, and frequently thought of himself as thick-headed, recalling how Ser Arlan had often said, \"Dunk the lunk, thick as a castle wall\", and referred to him as \"slow as an aurochs\".[1]\n\nHaving grown up in the slums of Flea Bottom, Duncan spoke with a recognizable King's Landing accent.[2]\n\n\n## History\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n\nDuncan's earliest memories were of living as a street urchin in the Flea Bottom slums of King's Landing.[1] His closest friends went by the names of Ferret, Rafe, and Pudding. By his own admission, they were \"little monsters\" with Duncan, at the time still known as \"Dunk\", the worst of all.[3] Sometimes they would sell[2] or even dump[3] pieces of meat of dubious origin to the local pot shops that made the bowls of brown.

Also employed was Ser Bennis of the Brown Shield, an old acquaintance of Duncan from his time with Arlan.

Duncan next ran into the Fiddler, and began to realize John's true identity, as well as that the tourney had been rigged as to make the Fiddler victorious.[3]\n\nLord Peake accused Glendon Ball of stealing the dragon egg, and the youth was imprisoned. When Duncan attempted to intervene, Alyn Cockshaw pulled him back, telling Duncan to follow him, if he wanted to find Aegon. Alyn attempted to kill Duncan out of jealousy for the attention the Fiddler had shown Duncan. Though injured, Duncan threw Alyn down a well to drown, an action witnessed by Maynard Plumm. Maynard helped Duncan see to his injuries and informed him of Aegon's location.[3]\n\nAegon falsely told Lord Butterwell that he and Duncan were spies sent to investigate the tournament and that his father, Prince Maekar Targaryen, was on his way with an army. Frightened, Ambrose pled for his innocence. Ser Tommard Heddle attempted to seize Aegon in the sept, but was slain by Duncan in the combat that ensued. Duncan ordered Aegon to ride for Maidenpool, and he confronted the Fiddler, calling him by his true name, Daemon. Duncan accused Lord Peake of bribing the contestants in Daemon's favor, and of falsely charging Glendon with the theft of the dragon egg. Furious about the accusations, Daemon challenged Glendon with a joust as a means of trial by combat.[3]\n\nGlendon defeated Daemon Blackfyre easily early the next morning, and moments later a loyalist army led by Lord Brynden Rivers, the Hand of the King, arrived at Whitewalls. Daemon was arrested, and those who had supported him executed or punished, causing the Second Blackfyre Rebellion to be suppressed before it had even begun. Lord Brynden allowed Duncan and Aegon to continue their travels, and hinted as to how the dragon's egg had been stolen, leading Duncan to realize the involvement of the dwarfs who had performed at the wedding.[2]\n\n\n## Later life\n\n\nAn unknown amount of time after Whitewalls, Duncan and Aegon visited Winterfell.[14]\n\nPresumably in honor of Ser Duncan, Prince Aegon Targaryen named his firstborn son and heir Duncan (however, when asked about it, George R. R. Martin refused to answer).[15] Prince Duncan was called \"Duncan the Small\".[16]\n\nIn late 233 AC, after Aegon had ascended the throne as Aegon V Targaryen, Duncan escorted the king's brother, Maester Aemon, to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, where Aemon was going to join the Night's Watch.[17]\n\nDuncan eventually joined the Kingsguard. While it is unknown when exactly he took his vows, the first known mention of him as a Kingsguard knight is in 236 AC.[4]\n\nIn 236 AC, Ser Duncan fought in the Fourth Blackfyre Rebellion and personally slew Daemon III Blackfyre, the Blackfyre Pretender.[4]\n\nIn 239 AC, when Prince Duncan Targaryen broke his betrothal to Lord Lyonel Baratheon's daughter and married a commonborn girl known as Jenny of Oldstones instead, the enraged Lyonel renounced his fealty to the Iron Throne. Duncan served as King Aegon V's champion in the trial by combat, in which he bested Lyonel, thereby ending his short rebellion.[4][18]\n\nIn 252 AC or 253 AC Duncan, by then Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, participated in a winter tourney at King's Landing, where he was defeated by a sixteen-year-old Barristan Selmy.[16]\n\nIn 259 AC, Duncan perished along with King Aegon V and Prince Duncan, among others, in the tragedy of Summerhall.[19][4] Little is known about the events of the tragedy, but it seems that the Lord Commander's valor saved some of the survivors from dying in the great fire that consumed Summerhall.[4]\n\n\n## Recent Events\n\n\n\n## A Storm of Swords\n\n\nWhile in the Round Room of White Sword Tower, Ser Jaime Lannister admires previous men who served as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, including Duncan. He also reads Ser Barristan Selmy's entry in the White Book, which states Barristan defeated Duncan during the winter tourney at King's Landing in which Barristan had participated as a mystery knight.[16]\n\n\n## A Feast for Crows\n\n\nFor unknown reasons, a shield with Dunk's original arms came to reside in the armory of Lord Selwyn Tarth at Evenfall Hall. While at Duskendale, Selwyn's daughter, Brienne, remembering the arms, has them painted on her shield so she can travel the crownlands and riverlands incognito.[20]\n\nMaester Aemon relates that when he joined the Night's Watch, his brother Egg insisted that Ser Duncan accompany him to Eastwatch.[17] Aemon also dreams of his youth in Oldtown, a time when he was drinking at the Quill and Tankard with Egg and \"that big knight he served\".[21]\n\n\n## A Dance with Dragons\n\n\nWhile in the cave of the three-eyed crow, Bran Stark has visions of the past looking through the heart tree in the godswood of Winterfell. Among the visions is a slender brown-haired girl kissing a knight as tall as Hodor,[22] possibly Duncan.\n\n\n## Steeds\n\n\nAt the time of the tourney at Ashford Meadow in The Hedge Knight, Dunk owned three horses which he had inherited from Ser Arlan of Pennytree:\n\n\n## Progeny\n\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin has stated that readers have met a descendant of Dunk in A Song of Ice and Fire.[6] He later stated that he gave a strong hint to Dunk's descendant in A Feast for Crows.[23] Given that in A Feast for Crows, Brienne recalls finding a shield with Dunk's sigil in the armories of Tarth,[20] it was widely speculated but not confirmed that she is descended from Duncan the Tall. However, in 2016 at Balticon, Martin confirmed Brienne's descent, stating that the exact relationship between Duncan and Brienne would be \"revealed in time\".[24]\n\n\n## Quotes by Duncan\n\n\n\n## Quotes about Duncan\n",
