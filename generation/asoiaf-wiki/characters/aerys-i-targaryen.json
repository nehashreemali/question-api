  "content": "Aerys I Targaryen was Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and the thirteenth Targaryen king to sit the Iron Throne. He succeeded his father, King Daeron II Targaryen.[2]\n\nAccording to semi-canon sources, Aerys was spindly and stooped, with long, straight hair. He had a long, thin face, a long, thin mustache and a long pointed beard, and his eyes were often red-rimmed from reading. He wore the crown of his grandfather, King Aegon IV Targaryen.[3] On his coinage, he was depicted with a beard.[4]\n\nAerys was a bookish man who preferred reading to ruling, and it was said in the Seven Kingdoms that \"Aerys would sooner bring a book to his bed rather than his wife\".[5] His obsession with reading made him forgetful of other tasks, such as changing his clothes or donning his crown.[3]\n\nAerys Targaryen was the second son of King Daeron II Targaryen and Queen Myriah Martell.[6] He was very much interested in books about ancient prophecy and the higher mysteries.[7] At some point, Aerys read a prophecy that spoke about the return of dragons.[4]\n\nHe was married to his cousin, Lady Aelinor Penrose, but he never showed any interest in getting her with child, instead shunning her bed. According to rumor, Aerys did not even consummate the marriage.[7][5]\n\nAerys became king in 209 AC, following the death of his father, King Daeron II Targaryen, and Daeron's immediate heirs, Princes Valarr and Matarys in the Great Spring Sickness. The plague continued for some time under his rule.[7] Upon becoming king, Aerys appointed his uncle, Brynden Rivers, known as Bloodraven, as Hand and let him rule while he occupied himself with the study of books and lore.[5] A new Grand Maester was also elected, and said to be involved in sorcery.[5] As Aerys had not yet fathered a child on his wife Aelinor, his small council, hoping that Aerys shunned her bed because he disliked her, urged Aerys to set Aelinor aside and take another wife. Aerys would not hear of it, however, and they remained married.[7]\n\nAerys's reign began during the Great Spring Sickness, and at its start suffered a great drought that lasted more than a year.[5] It was widely held that travel was less safe during the reign of Aerys than under his father Daeron II's.[4]\n\nAerys's reign was furthermore troubled by war. In 212 AC, Lord Dagon Greyjoy led the ironborn in raiding Fair Isle, the Arbor, and the north.[4] That same year, Lord Gormon Peake, a Blackfyre loyalist, brought Daemon II Blackfyre to the Seven Kingdoms from across the narrow sea and attempted to gather support for an insurrection, the Second Blackfyre Rebellion. Thanks to Brynden Rivers's network of spies and the actions of Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire, this rebellion ended at the Whitewalls tourney with relatively little bloodshed.[4][7]\n\nThe Third Blackfyre Rebellion was launched in 219 AC and ended with the capture of Ser Aegor Rivers and the death of Haegon I Blackfyre. Aegor Rivers was brought to King's Landing in chains and while Lord Brynden Rivers and Prince Aerion Targaryen wanted him put to death, King Aerys I sentenced him to take the black instead.[7]\n\nThroughout his reign, Aerys acknowledged four different heirs. First was his brother Rhaegel, who died in 215 AC when he choked on a lamprey pie.[7] Aerys next acknowledged Rhaegel's only son Aelor as his heir, but Aelor died in 217 AC during a mishap caused by his twin sister and wife, Aelora.[7] Aerys's third heir was Aelora.[8] However, she was mad with grief following her brother's death, and committed suicide some time later, leaving Aerys to recognize his fourth and last heir to the throne, his youngest brother Maekar. When Aerys died in 221 AC, Maekar succeeded him.[7][9]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nAccording to semi-canon sources, Aerys was spindly and stooped, with long, straight hair.
