  "content": "Nymeria Sand, nicknamed Lady Nym, is a bastard daughter of Oberyn Martell and a noblewoman from Volantis. She is the second oldest of the infamous Sand Snakes, so named for their bastard origin and the nickname of their father, the \"Red Viper\".\n\nIn the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Nymeria is portrayed by Jessica Henwick and stated to be the daughter of a YiTish noblewoman instead of a Volantene one.\n\nNymeria is twenty-five years old, slim and slender as a willow, with straight black hair worn in a long braid which pulls back from a widow's peak.[1][4] She has dark eyes[1] which are large and lustrous.[4] Her full lips are wine red and curve in a silken smile,[1][4] and she has high cheekbones.[1] Areo Hotah describes Nym as having pale white skin in A Feast for Crows,[1] a fact confirmed by the semi-canon app A World of Ice and Fire,[3] but mentions her olive skin in A Dance with Dragons.[4] Nymeria has all the beauty that her elder sister Obara Sand lacks but is no less deadly.[1] Although elegant, Nym is vengeful.[4]\n\nNymeria dresses gracefully in shimmering lilac robes with a silk cape of cream and copper,[1] and she also owns a yellow silk gown so sheer it reveals spun gold and jewels worn underneath.[4] Nymeria rides a gold sand steed with a mane like white silk.[1] Nym usually conceals a dozen daggers on her person[4] and is proficient with the hidden blades.[1]\n\nNymeria is good friends with Jeyne and Jennelyn Fowler.[5]\n\nNymeria's mother comes from the noblest blood of Volantis,[1] the Free City where Nym was born.[6]\n\nYoung Nym sometimes joined in play at the Water Gardens with her sister, Tyene Sand, her cousin, Princess Arianne Martell, Garin, Andrey Dalt, Sylva Santagar, the Fowler twins, and the Archon's green-haired daughter.[5] Arianne keeps in her boot a throwing knife gifted to her by Nymeria.[7]\n\nNymeria is abed with the Fowler twins, Jeyne and Jennelyn, when she is told of the death of her father, Prince Oberyn Martell, in King's Landing.[1] Ser Daemon Sand sends her a raven explaining how Ser Gregor Clegane was poisoned by Oberyn and is now dying.[1]\n\nAccompanied by a dozen mounted spearmen, Nymeria meets Doran Martell, the Prince of Dorne and Oberyn's elder brother, en route from the Water Gardens to Sunspear. She demands vengeance for the death of her father and rejects the offer Lord Tywin Lannister made Doran for Gregor's head. Instead of open war, Nymeria wants to assassinate Tywin, his children Queen Regent Cersei and Ser Jaime Lannister, and his grandchild, King Tommen I Baratheon. After visits from Nym's other sisters, Doran has the Sand Snakes arrested and confined in the Spear Tower of Sunspear.[1]\n\nNymeria and her sisters are released and are present at the feast at Sunspear when Ser Balon Swann presents the Mountain's skull to Doran. Balon seems discomforted by her silk gown. When Balon tells the manner of Gregor's death, Nymeria celebrates his suffering. When Ricasso raises a toast to King Tommen, Nym declines with a flick of her wrist.[4]\n\nDoran sends Nymeria to King's Landing to take the vacant Dornish seat on the small council.[4]\n\n\n## Appearance and Character\n\n\nNymeria is twenty-five years old, slim and slender as a willow, with straight black hair worn in a long braid which pulls back from a widow's peak.[1][4] She has dark eyes[1] which are large and lustrous.[4] Her full lips are wine red and curve in a silken smile,[1][4] and she has high cheekbones.[1] Areo Hotah describes Nym as having pale white skin in A Feast for Crows,[1] a fact confirmed by the semi-canon app A World of Ice and Fire,[3] but mentions her olive skin in A Dance with Dragons.[4] Nymeria has all the beauty that her elder sister Obara Sand lacks but is no less deadly.[1] Although elegant, Nym is vengeful.[4]\n\nNymeria dresses gracefully in shimmering lilac robes with a silk cape of cream and copper,[1] and she also owns a yellow silk gown so sheer it reveals spun gold and jewels worn underneath.[4] Nymeria rides a gold sand steed with a mane like white silk.[1] Nym usually conceals a dozen daggers on her person[4] and is proficient with the hidden blades.[1]\n\nNymeria is good friends with Jeyne and Jennelyn Fowler.[5]\n\n\n## History\n\n\nNymeria's mother comes from the noblest blood of Volantis,[1] the Free City where Nym was born.[6]\n\nYoung Nym sometimes joined in play at the Water Gardens with her sister, Tyene Sand, her cousin, Princess Arianne Martell, Garin, Andrey Dalt, Sylva Santagar, the Fowler twins, and the Archon's green-haired daughter.[5] Arianne keeps in her boot a throwing knife gifted to her by Nymeria.[7]\n\n\n## Recent Events\n\n\n\n## A Feast for Crows\n\n\nNymeria is abed with the Fowler twins, Jeyne and Jennelyn, when she is told of the death of her father, Prince Oberyn Martell, in King's Landing.[1] Ser Daemon Sand sends her a raven explaining how Ser Gregor Clegane was poisoned by Oberyn and is now dying.[1]\n\nAccompanied by a dozen mounted spearmen, Nymeria meets Doran Martell, the Prince of Dorne and Oberyn's elder brother, en route from the Water Gardens to Sunspear.
