Those to whom good things come by way of inheritance, however,\r\nare often among the latest to comprehend their own advantage; they\r\nsuppose it to be the common condition. And no doubt I had nearly arrived\r\nat man's estate before it occurred to me that the lines of few fishers\r\nof men were cast in places so pleasant as mine. I was the son of a\r\nman of high desert, who had such friends as he deserved; and these\r\ncompanions and admirers of his gave to me in the beginning of my days\r\na kindly welcome and encouragement generated from their affection and\r\nreverence for him. Without doing a stroke of work for it, I found myself\r\nearly in the enjoyment of a principality of good will and fellowship--a\r\nspecies of freemasonry, I might call it, though the secret was patent\r\nenough--for the rights in which, unaided, I might have contended my\r\nlifetime long in vain. Men and women whose names are consecrated apart\r\nin the dearest thoughts of thousands were familiars and playmates of my\r\nchildhood; they supported my youth and bade my manhood godspeed. But\r\nto me, for a long while, the favor of these gracious giants of mind and\r\ncharacter seemed agreeable indeed, but nothing out of the ordinary; my\r\ntacit presumption was that other children as well as I could if they\r\nwould walk hand in hand with Emerson along the village street, seek in\r\nthe meadows for arrow-heads with Thoreau, watch Powers thump the brown\r\nclay of the \"Greek Slave,\" or listen to the voice of Charlotte Cushman,\r\nwhich could sway assembled thousands, modulate itself to tell stories to\r\nthe urchin who leaned, rapt, against her knees. Were human felicity so\r\nomnipresent as a happy child imagines it, what a world would this be!\r\n\r\nIn time, my misapprehension was corrected, rather, I think, through the\r\napplication to it of cold logic than by any rude awakening. I learned\r\nof my riches not by losing them--the giants did not withdraw their\r\ngraciousness--but by comparing the lot of others with my own. And yet,\r\nto tell the truth--perhaps I might better leave it untold; only in these\r\nchapters, especially, I will not begin with reserves--to say truth,\r\nthen, my world, during my father's lifetime, and afterwards for I will\r\nnot say how long, was divided into two natural parts, my father being\r\none of them, and everybody else the other. Hence I was led to regard the\r\nparties of the latter part, rich or poor, giants or pygmies, as being,\r\nafter all, of much the same stature and value. The brightness (in the\r\nboy's estimation) of the paternal figure rendered distinctions between\r\nother brightnesses unimportant. The upshot was, in short, that I\r\ninclined to the opinion that while compassion was unquestionably due to\r\nother children for not having a father like mine, yet in other respects\r\nmy condition was not egregiously superior to theirs. They might not know\r\nthe Brownings or the Julia Ward Howes; but then, very likely, the Smiths\r\nand the Joneses, whom they did know, were nearly as good.\r\n\r\nAfter fifty years, of course, such prepossessions yield to experience.\r\nMy father was the best friend I ever had, and he will always stand in\r\nmy estimation distinct from all other friends and persons; but I can now\r\nrecognize that in addition to the immeasurable debt I owe him for being\r\nto me what he was in his own person, he bestowed upon me a privilege\r\nalso immeasurable in the hospitality of these shining ones who were his\r\nintimates. Did the gift cost him nothing? Nothing, in one sense. But,\r\nagain, what does it cost a man to walk upright and cleanly during\r\nthe years of his pilgrimage: to deal justly with all, and charitably:\r\ndiligently to cultivate and develop every natural endowment: always to\r\nseek truth, tell it, and vindicate it: to discharge to the utmost of his\r\nability every duty that was intrusted to him: to rest content, in the\r\nline of his calling, with no work inferior to his best: to say no word\r\nand do no act which, were they known, might weaken the struggle against\r\ntemptation of any fellow-creature? These qualities were the price at\r\nwhich Hawthorne bought his friends; and in receiving those friends from\r\nhim, his children could not but feel that the bequest represented his\r\nunfaltering grasp upon whatever is pure, lofty, and generous in human\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nYes, whatever it may cost a man of genius to be all his life a good\r\nman, and to use and develop his genius to the noblest ends only, that my\r\nfather's friends cost him, and in that amount am I his debtor; and the\r\nlonger I myself live, and the more I see of other men, the higher and\r\nrarer do I esteem the obligation. Moreover, in speaking of his friends,\r\nI was thinking of those who personally knew him; but the world is full\r\nto-day of friends of his who never saw him, to whom his name is my best\r\nand surest introduction. Once, only three years since, in the remote\r\nheart of the Colorado mountains, I chanced to enter the hut of an aged\r\nminer; he sat in a corner of the little family room; on the wall near\r\nhis hand was fixed a small bookshelf, filled with a dozen dog-eared\r\nvolumes. The man had for years been paralyzed; he could do little more\r\nthan to raise to that book-shelf his trembling hand, and take from it\r\none or other of the volumes. When this helpless veteran learned my name,\r\nhe uttered a strange cry, and his face worked with eager emotion; the\r\nwife of his broad-shouldered son brought me to him in his corner; his\r\nold eyes glowed as they perused me. I could not gather the meaning of\r\nhis broken, trembling speech; the young woman interpreted for me. Was I\r\nrelated to the great Hawthorne? \"Yes; I am his son.\" \"His son!\" Seldom\r\nhave I met a gaze harder to sustain than that which the paralytic bent\r\nupon me. Would I might have worn, for the time being, the countenance of\r\nan archangel, so to fill out the lineaments, drawn during so many lonely\r\nyears by his imagination and his reverence, of his ideal writer! \"The\r\nson of Hawthorne!\" He said no more, save by the strengthless pressure of\r\nhis hands upon my own; the woman told me how all the books on the little\r\nshelf were my father's books, and for fifteen years the old man had read\r\nno others. Helpless tears of joy, of gratitude, of wonder ran down the\r\nfurrows of his cheeks into his white beard. And how could I at whom he\r\nso gazed help being moved: on that desolate, unknown mountain-side, far\r\nfrom the world, the name which I had inherited was loved and honored!\r\nOne does not get one's privileges for nothing. My father gave me power\r\nto make my way, and cast sunshine on the path; but he made the path\r\narduous, too!\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, I now ask who will to look in my mirror, and see\r\nreflected there some of the figures and the scenes that have made my\r\nlife worth living. As I peer into the dark abysm of things gone by, many\r\nplaces that seemed at first indistinct, grow clearer; but many more must\r\nremain impenetrable. Upon the whole, however, I am surprised to find how\r\nmuch is still discernible. Nearly a score of years ago I published,\r\nin the shape of a formal biography of Hawthorne and his wife, the\r\nconsecutive facts of their lives, and numerous passages from their\r\njournals and correspondence. My aim is different now; I wish to indite\r\nan informal narrative from my own point of view, as child, youth, and\r\nman. There will be gaps in it--involuntary ones; and others occasioned\r\nby the obligation to retain those pictures only that seem likely to\r\narouse a catholic interest. Yet there will be a certain intimacy in the\r\nstory; and some matters which history would omit as trivial will be here\r\nadduced, for the sake of such color and character as they may contain.\r\nI shall not stalk on stilts, or mouth phrases, but converse comfortably\r\nand trustfully as between friends. If a writing of this kind be not\r\nflexible, unpretending, discursive, it has no right to be at all. Art is\r\nnot in question, save the minor art that lives from line to line. Gossip\r\nabout men, women, and things--it can amount to little more than that.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier chapters the dramatis personae and the incidents must\r\nnaturally group themselves about the figure of my father; for it was\r\nthus that I saw them. To his boy he was the fountain of love, honor, and\r\nenergy; and to the boy he seemed the animating or organizing principle\r\nof other persons and events. With his death, in my eighteenth year, the\r\nworld appeared disordered for a season; then, gradually, I learned to do\r\nmy own orientation. I was destined to an experience superficially\r\nmuch more active and varied than his had been; and it was a world\r\nsuperficially very different from his in which I moved and dealt\r\nThere must follow a corresponding modification in the character of the\r\nnarrative; yet that, after all is superficial, too. For the memory of\r\nmy father has always been with me, and has doubtless influenced me more\r\nthan I am myself aware. And certainly but for him this book would never\r\nhave been attempted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n     Value of dates--My aunt Lizzie's efforts--My father's\r\n     decapitation--My mother's strong-box--The spirit of The\r\n     Scarlet Letter--The strain of imaginative composition--My\r\n     grandmother Hawthorne's death--Infantile indifference to\r\n     calamity--The children's plays and books--The house on Mall\r\n     Street--Scarlet fever--The study on the third floor--The\r\n     haunted mahogany writing-desk--The secret drawers--The\r\n     upright Egyptian--Mr. Pickwick--My father in 1850--The\r\n     flowered writing-gown, and the ink butterfly--Driving the\r\n     quill pen--The occupants of the second floor--Aunt Louisa\r\n     and Aunt Ebe--The dowager Mrs. Hawthorne--I kick my aunt\r\n     Lizzie--The kittens and the great mystery--The greatest book\r\n     of the age.\r\n\r\nMy maternal aunt, Miss Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, was a very learned\r\nwoman, and a great student of history, and teacher of it; and by the aid\r\nof huge, colored charts, done by my uncle Nat Peabody and hung on the\r\nwalls of our sitting-room, she labored during some years to teach me all\r\nthe leading dates of human history--the charts being designed according\r\nto a novel and ingenious plan to fix those facts in childish memory. But\r\nas a pupil I was always most inapt and grievous, in dates and in matters\r\nmathematical especially; so that I gave her inexhaustible patience many\r\na sad hour. To this day I cannot tell in what year was fought the battle\r\nof Marathon, or when John signed Magna Charta; though the battle itself,\r\nand the scene of the barons with menacing brows gathered about John,\r\nstood clearly pictured in my imagination. Dates were arbitrary, and to\r\nmy memory nothing arbitrary would stick. Nevertheless, when I am myself\r\nconstructing a narrative, whether it be true or fictitious, I am\r\nwedded to dates, and cannot be divorced from them. It must be set\r\ndown precisely when the events took place, in what years the dramatis\r\npersonae were born, and how old they were when each juncture of their\r\nfortunes came to pass. I can no more dispense with dates than I can talk\r\nwithout consonants; they carry form, order, and credibility. Or they\r\nare like the skeleton which gives recognizable shape to men and animals.\r\nNothing mortal can get on without them..\r\n\r\nWhether this addiction be in the nature of a reaction from my childish\r\nperversity, giving my erudite and beloved aunt Lizzie (as I called her)\r\nher revenge so long after our lessons are over; or how else to explain\r\nit, I know not; but it leads me to affirm here that the nadir of my\r\nfather's material fortunes was reached about the year 1849. At that time\r\nhis age was five-and-forty, and I was three.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this financial depression were several. One morning he\r\nawoke to find himself deprived, by political chicanery, of the income\r\nof a custom-house surveyorship which for some while past had served\r\nto support his small family. Now, some men could have gone on writing\r\nstories in the intervals between surveying customs, and have thus placed\r\nan anchor to windward against the time when the political storm should\r\nset in; but Nathaniel Hawthorne was devoid of that useful ability. Nor\r\nhad he been able to spend less than he earned; so, suddenly, there he\r\nwas on his beam-ends. Leisure to write, certainly, was now abundant\r\nenough; but he never was a rapid composer, and even had he been so, the\r\nmarket for the kind of things he wrote was, in the middle of the past\r\ncentury, in New England, neither large nor eager. The emoluments were\r\nmeagre to match; twenty dollars for four pages of the Democratic Review\r\nwas about the figure; and to produce a short tale or sketch of that\r\nlength would take him a month at least. How were a husband and wife and\r\ntheir two children to live for a month on the mere expectation of\r\ntwenty dollars from the Democratic Review--which was, into the bargain,\r\nterribly slow pay? Such was the problem which confronted the dark-haired\r\nand grave-visaged gentleman as he closed his desk in the Salem\r\ncustom-house for the last time, and put on his hat to walk home.\r\n\r\nThanks, however, to some divine foresight on my mother's part, aided by\r\na wonderful talent for practical economy, she had secretly contrived\r\nto save, out of her weekly stipends, small sums which in the aggregate\r\nbulked large enough to make an important difference in the situation. So\r\nwhen her husband disclosed his bad news, she opened her private drawer\r\nand disclosed her banknotes, with such a smile in her eyes as I can\r\neasily picture to myself. Stimulated by the miracle, he remembered that\r\nthe inchoate elements of a story, in which was to figure prominently a\r\nletter A, cut out of red cloth, or embroidered in scarlet thread, and\r\naffixed to a woman's bosom, had been for months past rumbling round in\r\nhis mind; now was the time of times to shape it forth. Yonder upon the\r\ntable by the window stood the old mahogany writing-desk so long unused;\r\nhere were his flowered dressing-gown and slippers down-at-heel. He ought\r\nto be able to finish the story before the miraculous savings gave out;\r\nand then all he would have to do would be to write others. And, after\r\nall, to be rid of the surveyorship was a relief.\r\n\r\nBut matters were not to be run off quite so easily as this. The Scarlet\r\nLetter, upon coming to close quarters with it, turned out to be not a\r\nstory of such moderate caliber as Hawthorne had hitherto been used to\r\nwrite, but an affair likely to extend over two or three hundred pages,\r\nwhich, instead of a month or so, might not be completed in a year; yet\r\nit was too late to substitute something more manageable for it--in the\r\nfirst place, because nothing else happened to be at his disposal, and\r\nsecondly, because The Scarlet Letter took such intimate hold upon\r\nthe vitals of his heart and mind that he was by no means able to free\r\nhimself from it until all had been fulfilled. Only men of creative\r\ngenius know in what glorious and harrowing thraldom their creations hold\r\nthem. Having once been fairly begun, The Scarlet Letter must inevitably\r\nfinish itself for good or ill, come what might to the writer of it.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: BIRTHPLACE OF NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE AT SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS]\r\n\r\nThis is a story of people and events, not a study in literary criticism;\r\nbut the writing of The Scarlet Letter was an event of no trifling\r\nimportance in the story of its author's life. To read the book is an\r\nexperience which its readers cannot forget; what its writing must have\r\nbeen to a man organized as my father was is hardly to be conveyed in\r\nwords. Hester, Dimmesdale, and Chillingworth--he must live through each\r\none of them, feel their passion, remorse, hatred, terror, love; and he\r\nmust enter into the soul of the mysterious nature of Pearl. Such things\r\ncannot with impunity be done by any one; the mere physical strain, all\r\nconditions being favorable, would be almost past bearing. But my father,\r\nthough uniformly his bodily health was all his life sound, was never\r\nwhat I would call a robust man; he was exquisitely balanced. At the time\r\nhe began his book he was jaded from years of office drudgery, and he was\r\nin some anxiety as to the issue of his predicament. The house in\r\nwhich he dwelt, small and ill-placed in a narrow side-street, with no\r\npossibility of shutting out the noise of traffic and of domestic alarms,\r\ncould not but make the work tell more heavily upon him. But in addition\r\nto this there were fortuitous occasions of emotional stress, all of\r\nwhich I shall not mention; but among them were the distasteful turmoil\r\naroused by his political mishap; and, far more poignant, the critical\r\nillness of his mother. Circumstances led to her being housed under his\r\nroof; there she lingered long at death's door, and there at last she\r\ndied. He profoundly loved her; but deep-rooted, too, in both of them was\r\nthat strange, New England shyness, masking in visible ice the underlying\r\nemotion. Not since his boyhood had their mutual affection found free,\r\nnatural expression; and now, in this final hour, that bondage of habit\r\ncaused the words of tenderness to stumble on their lips. The awful\r\nmajesty of approaching death, prompting them to \"catch up the whole\r\nof love and utter it\" ere it be too late, wrought this involuntary\r\nself-repression into silent agony.\r\n\r\nShe died; his own health was shaken to its foundations; his children\r\nfell ill, his wife underwent acute suffering; and through all this, and\r\nmore, The Scarlet Letter must be written. No wonder that, when he came\r\nto read the story in manuscript to his wife, his voice faltered and\r\nbroke; and she slipped to her knees and hid her face on her arms in the\r\nchair. \"I had been suffering,\" he commentated, long afterwards, \"from\r\na great diversity and severity of emotion.\" Great works of art--things\r\nwith the veritable spirit of enduring life in them--are destined to be\r\nborn in sore travail and pain. Those who give them birth yield up their\r\nown life to them.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period--say, about 1850--that my own personal\r\nrecollections, in a shadowy and incoherent way, begin. The shadows are\r\nexclusively of time's making; they were not of the heart. All through\r\nthe trials of my parents I retained a jocund equanimity (save for some\r\ntrifling childish ailments) and esteemed this world a friendly and\r\nagreeable place. The Scarlet Letter dashed my spirits not a whit; I\r\nknew not of its existence, by personal evidence, till full a dozen years\r\nlater; and even the death of my grandmother left me light of heart, for\r\nthe passing of the spirit from the body can but awaken the transient\r\ncuriosity of a child of four. For the rest, my physical environment, in\r\nitself amusing and interesting enough to me, had its chief importance\r\nfrom the material it afforded on which to construct the imaginary\r\nscenes and characters of my play. My sister Una and myself were forever\r\nenacting something or somebody not ourselves: childish egoism oddly\r\ndecking itself in the non-ego. We believed in fairies, in magic, in\r\nangels, in transformations; Hans Christian Andersen, Grimm, The Black\r\nAunt (oh, delectable, lost volume) were our sober history-books, and\r\nRobinson Crusoe was our autobiography. But I did occasionally take note\r\nof concrete appearances, too; and some of them I remember.\r\n\r\nThe house--the third which we had inhabited since my father became\r\nsurveyor--was on Mall Street, and was three stories in height, with a\r\nyard behind and at one end; this yard, which was of importance to my\r\nsister and myself, had access to the street by a swinging gate. There\r\nwere three or four trees in it, and space for play. The house was but\r\none room deep, and lying as it did about north and south, the rooms were\r\nopen to both the morning and the afternoon sunshine. They opened one\r\ninto the other in a series; and when my father was safe up-stairs in\r\nhis study, my mother would open all the doors of the suite on the lower\r\nfloor, and allow the children to career triumphantly to and fro. No\r\nnoise that we could make ever troubled her nerves, unless it was the\r\nnoise of conflict; the shriek of joy, however shrill, passed by her\r\nharmless; but the lowest mutter of wrath or discontent distressed her;\r\nfor of such are the mothers of the kingdom of heaven! And so zealous was\r\nour regard for her just and gentle law that I really think we gave way\r\nas little as most children to the latter.\r\n\r\nOf course, whenever the weather permitted, we were out in the yard,\r\nor even promenaded for short distances up and down the street. And\r\nonce--\"How are you?\" inquired a friend of the family, as he drove by\r\nin his wagon. \"Oh, we've got the scarlet fever!\" we proudly replied,\r\nstepping out gallantly along the sidewalk. For we were treated by a\r\nhomoeopathic doctor of the old school, who was a high-dilutionist, and\r\nmortal ills could never get a firm grip on us. In winter we rejoiced in\r\nthe snow; and my father's story of the Snow Image got most of its local\r\ncolor from our gambols in this fascinating substance, which he could\r\nobserve from the window of his study.\r\n\r\nThe study was on the third floor of the house, secluded from the turmoil\r\nof earth, so far as anything could be in a city street. No one\r\nwas supposed to intrude upon him there; but such suppositions are\r\nineffectual against children. From time to time the adamantine gates\r\nfell ajar, and in we slipped. It seemed a heavenly place, tenanted by a\r\nbeing possessed of every attribute that our imaginations could ascribe\r\nto an angel. The room and its tenant glimmer before me as I write,\r\nluminous with the sunshine of more than fifty years ago. Both were\r\nequipped for business rather than for beauty; furniture and garments\r\nwere simple in those Salem days. A homely old paper covered the walls, a\r\nbrownish old carpet the floor. There was an old rocking-chair, its black\r\npaint much worn and defaced; another chair was drawn up to the table,\r\nwhich stood to the left of the eastern window; and on the table was a\r\nmahogany desk, concerning which I must enter into some particulars.\r\nIt was then, and for years afterwards, an object of my most earnest\r\nscrutiny. Such desks are not made nowadays.\r\n\r\nWhen closed, it was an oblong mahogany box, two feet long by half that\r\nwidth, and perhaps nine inches high. It had brass corners, and a brass\r\nplate on the top, inscribed with the name, \"N. Hawthorne.\" At one end\r\nwas a drawer, with a brass handle playing on a hinge and fitting into\r\na groove or socket when down; there was a corresponding handle at the\r\nother end, but that was for symmetry only; the one drawer went clear\r\nthrough the desk. I often mused over the ethics of this deception.\r\n\r\nBeing opened, the desk presented a sloping surface two feet square,\r\ncovered with black velvet, which had been cut here and there and pasted\r\ndown again, and was stiffened with many ink-spatterings. This writing\r\nsurface consisted of two lids, hinged at their junction in the centre;\r\nlifting them, you discovered two receptacles to hold writing-paper and\r\nother desk furniture. They were of about equal capacity; for although\r\nthe upper half of the desk was the more capacious, you must not forget\r\nthat two inches of it, at the bottom, was taken up by the long drawer\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\nBut there was, also, a more interesting curtailment of this interior\r\nspace. Along the very top of the desk, as it lay open, was a narrow\r\nchannel, perhaps a couple of inches wide and deep, divided into three\r\nsections; two square ones, at the opposite ends, held the ink-bottle and\r\nthe sand-bottle; the long central one was for quill pens. These, in\r\nthe aggregate, appeared to the superficial eye to account for all that\r\nremained of the cubic contents of the structure; but the supreme mystery\r\nand charm of the affair was that they did not!\r\n\r\nNo; there was an esoteric secret still in reserve; and for years it\r\nremained a secret to me. The bottle-sockets and pen-tray did not reach\r\ndown to the level of the long drawer by nearly an inch. Measurement\r\nwould prove that; but you would have said that the interval must be\r\nsolid wood; for nothing but a smooth panel met the eye when you pulled\r\naside the sheets of writing-paper in their receptacle to investigate.\r\nBut the lesson of this world, and of the desk as a part of it, is that\r\nappearances are not to be trusted. The guile of those old desk-makers\r\npasses belief.\r\n\r\nI will expose it. In the pen-tray lay a sort of brass nail, as long as\r\nyour little finger, and blunt at the end. Now take the sand-bottle from\r\nits hole. In one corner of the bottom thereof you will see a minute\r\naperture, just big enough to admit the seemingly useless brass nail.\r\nStick it in and press hard. With an abrupt noise that makes you jump, if\r\nyou are four or five years old, that smooth, unsuspected strip of\r\npanel starts violently forward (propelled by a released spring) and\r\nreveals--what? Nothing less than the fronts of two minute drawers. They\r\nfit in underneath the pen-tray, and might remain undiscovered for a\r\nhundred years unless you had the superhuman wit to divine the purpose of\r\nthe brass nail. The drawers contain diamonds, probably, or some closely\r\nfolded document making you the heir to a vast estate. As a matter of\r\nfact, I don't know what they contained; the surprise of the drawers\r\nthemselves was enough for me. I need not add that I did not guess the\r\nriddle myself; but nothing that I can call to mind impressed me more\r\nthan when, one day, my father solved it for me with his little brass\r\nwand. At intervals, afterwards, I was allowed to work the miracle\r\nmyself, always with the same thrill of mysterious delight. The desk was\r\nhuman to me; it was alive.\r\n\r\nThere were little square covers for the ink and sand-bottles; and on\r\nthe under sides of these were painted a pair of faces; very ruddy in the\r\ncheeks they were, with staring eyes and smiling mouths; and one of them\r\nwore a pair of black side-whiskers. They were done by my father, with\r\noil--colors filched from my mother's paint-box. They seemed to me\r\nportraits of the people who lived in the desk; evidently they enjoyed\r\ntheir existence hugely. And when I considered that the desk was also\r\nsomehow instrumental in the production of stories--such as the Snow\r\nImage--of a delectable and magical character, the importance to my mind\r\nof the whole contrivance may be conceived. When I grew beyond child's\r\nestate, I learned that it had also assisted at the composition of The\r\nScarlet Letter. If ever there were a haunted writing-desk, this should\r\nhave been it; but the ghosts have long since carried it away, whither I\r\nknow not.\r\n\r\nOn the table were two ornaments; one, the finely moulded figure of\r\nan Egyptian in bronze, the wide Egyptian head-dress falling on the\r\nshoulders, the arms lying rigidly at the sides, with fists clinched.\r\nGenerations of handling had made it almost black, but the amiable\r\nexpression of the little countenance--the figure was about seven inches\r\ntall--greatly endeared it to me. Its feet were pressed close together\r\non a small round stand; but one day somebody set it down on a hot stove,\r\nwhere it remained without flinching till the feet were melted off. After\r\nsome years my mother had an ebony stump affixed to it, preserving the\r\nproportions of the figure and setting it once more erect. He was of\r\ngreater endurance and of finer physical if not of moral development than\r\nthe Tin Soldier of Hans Christian Andersen. The other ornament, less\r\nthan half the Egyptian's size, and also made of bronze, was a warrior in\r\nmediaeval armor, whose head lifted off, showing a sharp-pointed rod\r\nthe sheath of which was the body. Its use was to pick the wicks of the\r\noil-lamps of that epoch, and its name was Mr. Pickwick. When afterwards\r\nI became acquainted with the world's Mr. Pickwick, I supposed his\r\ncreator had adopted the name from our bronze warrior; but the world's\r\nPickwick was made of stuff more enduring than bronze; he remains, but\r\nour little warrior has vanished.\r\n\r\nI come now to the human occupant of this chamber of marvels. I see a\r\ntall, strong man, whose wide-domed head was covered with wavy black\r\nhair, bushing out at the sides. It thinned somewhat over the lofty crown\r\nand brow; the forehead was hollowed at the temple and rounded out above,\r\nafter the Moorish style of architecture. Under heavy, dark eyebrows were\r\neyes deep-set and full of light, marvellous in range of expression,\r\nwith black eyelashes. All seemed well with me when I met their look. The\r\nstraight, rather salient nose had a perceptible cleft at the tip, which,\r\nI was told, was a sign of good lineage; muddy-mettled rascals lacked it;\r\nso that I was much distressed by the smooth, plebeian bluntness, at that\r\ntime, of my own little snub. The mouth, then unshaded by a mustache,\r\nhad a slight upward turn at the corners, indicative of vitality and\r\ngood-humor; the chin rounded out sharply convex from the lip. The round,\r\nstrong column of the neck well supported the head; my mother compared it\r\nwith that of the Apollo Belvedere, a bust of which stood in the corner\r\nof our sitting-room. The head was deep--a great distance between the\r\nbase of the ear and the wing of the nostril--and was well filled out\r\nbehind. Above the blue of the shaven beard the complexion showed clear\r\nwhite and red, announcing a strong heart and good digestion. My father\r\nshaved himself daily; I was not permitted to see the operation, but\r\nI knew he lathered, and wondered why. He was naturally athletic;\r\nbroad-shouldered and deep in the chest, lean about the loins, weighing\r\nnever over one hundred and eighty pounds; his height was five feet ten\r\nand three-quarter inches; his legs and feet were slender and graceful,\r\nhis gait long and springy, and he could stand and leap as high as his\r\nshoulder. In the house he wore slippers, which seemed always old and\r\ndown-at-heel.\r\n\r\nIn the house, also, he wore a writing-gown, made for him some years\r\nbefore by my mother; it reached nearly to his heels, and had been a\r\ngorgeous affair, though now much defaced. The groundwork was purple,\r\ncovered all over with conventional palm-leaf in old-gold color; the\r\nlining was red. This lining, under the left-hand skirt of the gown, was\r\nblackened with ink over a space as large as your hand; for the author\r\nwas in the habit of wiping his pen thereon; but my mother finally\r\nparried this attack by sewing in the centre of the place a penwiper in\r\nthe shape of a butterfly.\r\n\r\nWhile story-writing, the door of the study was locked against all the\r\nworld; but after noon he became approachable, except during The Scarlet\r\nLetter period, when he wrote till evening. He did not mind my seeing him\r\nwrite letters; he would sit with his right shoulder and head inclined\r\ntowards the desk; the quill squeaked softly over the smooth paper, with\r\nfrequent quick dips into the ink-bottle; a few words would be written\r\nswiftly; then a pause, with suspended pen, while the next sentence was\r\nforming in the writer's mind. When he miswrote, instead of crossing out\r\nthe word, he would smear it out with his finger, and rewrite over\r\nthe smear; so that his page had a mottled appearance. The writing was\r\naccompanied by intermittent nods of the head, as one would say, \"Sic\r\ncogito!\" So far as he is concerned, the shadows close in on me here.\r\n\r\nBut I have said that the house was of three stories, and I have\r\naccounted for two of them only. The second was occupied by my\r\ngrandmother Hawthorne and her two daughters, Aunt Louisa and Aunt Ebe\r\n(the latter appellation being an infantile version of her name invented\r\nby my father, who was her junior, and used by us to distinguish between\r\nher and that other Elizabeth who was Aunt Lizzie Peabody). Of my\r\ngrandmother Hawthorne I have no personal recollection at all; she was\r\na Manning, a beautiful old lady, whom her son resembled. She had been\r\na recluse from society for forty years; it was held to be good form, in\r\nthat age and place, to observe such Hindoo rites after the death of a\r\nhusband; hers had died in his thirty-fourth year in Surinam. But she\r\nhad also insensibly fallen into the habit of isolating herself in some\r\ndegree from her own family; they were all of them addicted to solitude\r\nof the body, though kindly enough disposed in the abstract. When we\r\nwent to live in the Mall Street house, the old lady and her daughters\r\nuprooted themselves from their home of many years in Herbert Street and\r\ndwelt with us; and that quaint crystallization of their habits was in a\r\nmeasure broken up. But the dowager Mrs. Hawthorne, it soon appeared, had\r\ncome there to die; she was more than seventy years old. My aunt Louisa I\r\nseem dimly to recall as a tall, fragile, pale, amiable figure, not very\r\neffective. My aunt Ebe I afterwards came to know well, and shall defer\r\nmention of her. So I was encompassed by kindly petticoats, and was very\r\nhappy, but might have been better for a stout playmate of my own sex.\r\nI had a hobby-horse, which I rode constantly to fairy-land in quest of\r\ntreasure to bestow upon my friends. I swung with Una on the gate, and\r\nlooked out upon the wonder of the passing world. The tragedy of my\r\ngrandmother's death, which, as I have said, interrupted the birth of\r\nThe Scarlet Letter, passed me by unknowing, or rather without leaving a\r\ntrace upon my memory. On the other hand, I can reconstitute vividly two\r\nabsurd incidents, destitute of historical value. After my grandmother\r\nHawthorne's death I fell ill; but the night before the disease declared\r\nitself, I was standing in a chair at the nursery window, looking out at\r\nthe street-lamp on the corner, and my aunt Lizzie Peabody, who had just\r\ncome on from Boston, was standing behind me, lest I should fall off.\r\nNow, I was normally the most sweet-tempered little urchin imaginable;\r\nyet suddenly, without the faintest warning or provocation, I turned\r\nround and dealt my loving aunt a fierce kick in the stomach. It deprived\r\nher of breath for a space; but her saintly nature is illustrated by the\r\nfact that the very first use she made of her recovered faculties was\r\nto gasp out, \"Sophie, the child must be ill!\" Fortunately for my\r\nreputation, the illness was not long in arriving. The other episode must\r\nhave happened at about the same period, and is likewise concerned with\r\nAunt Lizzie. We had a cat, and the cat had had kittens a day or two\r\nbefore. Aunt Lizzie came into the nursery, where Una and I were building\r\nhouses of blocks, and sat down in the big easy-chair. The cat was in\r\nthe room, and she immediately came up to my aunt and began to mew and to\r\npluck at her dress with her claws. Such attentions were rare on pussy's\r\npart, and my aunt noticed them with pleasure, and caressed the animal,\r\nwhich still continued to devote its entire attention to her. But there\r\nwas something odd in the sound of her mewing and in the intent regard of\r\nher yellow eyes. \"Can anything be the matter with pussy?\" speculated\r\nmy aunt. At that moment my father entered the room, and my aunt rose to\r\ngreet him. Then the massacre was revealed, for she had been sitting upon\r\nthe kittens. Their poor mother pounced upon them with a yowl, but it\r\nwas too late. My dear aunt was rather a heavy woman, and she had been\r\nsitting there fifteen minutes. We all stood appalled in the presence of\r\nthe great mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day a big man, with a brown beard and shining brown eyes, who\r\nbubbled over with enthusiasm and fun, made his appearance and talked\r\nvolubly about something, and went away again, and my father and mother\r\nsmiled at each other. The Scarlet Letter had been written, and James\r\nT. Fields had read it, and declared it the greatest book of the age. So\r\nthat was the last of Salem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n     Horatio Bridge's \"I-told-you-so\"--What a house by the sea\r\n     might have done--Unknown Lenox--The restlessness of youth--\r\n     The Unpardonable Sin and the Deathless Man--The little red\r\n     house--Materials of culture--Our best playmates--The mystery\r\n     of Mrs. Peter's dough--Our intellectual hen--Fishing for\r\n     poultry--Yacht-building--Swimming with one foot on the\r\n     ground--Shipwreck--Our playfellow the brook--Tanglewood--\r\n     Nuts--Giants and enchanters--Coasting--Wet noses, dark eyes,\r\n     ambrosial breath--My first horseback ride--Herman Melville's\r\n     stories--Another kind of James--The thunder-storm--Yearning\r\n     ladies and melancholy sinners--Hindlegs--Probable murder--\"I\r\n     abominate the sight of it!\"--The peril of Tanglewood--The\r\n     truth of fiction--An eighteen-months' work--We leave five\r\n     cats behind.\r\n\r\nHoratio Bridge, my father's college friend, was a purser in the navy and\r\nlived in Augusta, Maine, his official residence being at Portsmouth. He\r\nhad kept in closer touch with the romancer than any of his other friends\r\nhad since their graduating days, and he had been from the first a\r\nbeliever in his coming literary renown. So, when The Scarlet Letter\r\nshone eminent in the firmament of book-land, it was his triumphant\r\n\"I-told-you-so\" that was among the earliest to be heard. And when my\r\nfather cast about for a more congenial place than Salem to live in, it\r\nwas to Bridge that he applied for suggestions. He stipulated that the\r\nplace should be somewhere along the New England sea-coast.\r\n\r\nHad this wish of his been fulfilled it might have made great\r\ndifferences. Hawthorne had always dwelt within sight and sound of the\r\nAtlantic, on which his forefathers had sailed so often between the\r\nIndies and Salem port, and Atlantic breezes were necessary to his\r\ncomplete well-being. At this juncture physical health had for the first\r\ntime become an object to him; he was run down by a year of suffering and\r\nhard work, and needed nature's kindest offices. A suitable house of\r\nhis own by the sea-side would probably have brought him up to his best\r\nphysical condition to begin with, and kept him so; and it would so have\r\nendeared itself to him that when, two or three years later, Pierce had\r\noffered him a foreign appointment he might have been moved to decline\r\nit, and have gone on writing American romances to the end--to the\r\nadvantage of American letters. Concord had its own attractions; but it\r\nnever held him as the sea would have done, nor nourished his health, nor\r\nstimulated his genius. A house of his own beside the Atlantic might well\r\nhave added twenty years to his life.\r\n\r\nBut it was not upon the knees of the gods.\r\n\r\nBridge's zealous efforts failed to find a place available, and after an\r\nuneasy interval, during which his friend wandered uncomfortably about\r\nBoston and the neighborhood (incidentally noting down some side-scenes\r\nafterwards to be incorporated in The Blithedale Romance), a cottage\r\nin the Berkshire Hills was spoken of, and upon examination seemed\r\npracticable. Lenox, at that time, was as little known as Mount Desert;\r\nit was not until long afterwards that fashion found them out and made\r\nthem uninhabitable to any but fashionable folks. Moreover, my father had\r\nseen something of Lenox a dozen years before.\r\n\r\nA dozen years before he was not yet betrothed to Sophia Peabody; he\r\nalready loved her and she him; but her health seemed an insuperable\r\nbarrier between them. This and certain other matters were weighing\r\nheavily upon his soul, and his future seemed dark and uncertain. He\r\nthought of taking a voyage round the world; he thought of getting into\r\npolitics; he even thought--as young men full of life sometimes will--of\r\ndeath. What he finally did, with native good sense, was to make a\r\ntwo-months' trip in the mountainous region to the westward, to change\r\nthe scene and his state of mind, and to get what artists call a fresh\r\neye. He chose North Adams as his headquarters, and forayed thence in\r\nvarious directions over a radius of twenty miles. He was then beginning\r\nto revolve one of the two great romance themes that preoccupied his\r\nwhole after-life, neither of which was he destined to write. This was\r\nthe idea of the Unpardonable Sin; the other was the conception of the\r\nDeathless Man. The only essay we have towards the embodiment of the\r\nfirst vision is the short fragment published in Mosses from an Old\r\nManse, called \"Ethan Brand.\" The other was attempted in various forms,\r\nof which Septimius, Dr. Grimshawe's Secret, and The Dolliver Romance,\r\nall posthumously published, are the most important.\r\n\r\nBut Stockbridge, Pittsfield, and Lenox had been included among his\r\nhaunts during the break-away above mentioned, and he remembered that the\r\nscenery was beautiful, the situation remote, and the air noble. Next to\r\nthe sea it seemed an ideal place to recuperate and write in. Thither,\r\nat all events, he resolved to go, and early in the summer of 1850 we\r\narrived at the little red house above the shores of Stockbridge Bowl,\r\nwith bag and baggage. Little though the house was, the bag and baggage\r\nwere none too much to find easy accommodation in it.\r\n\r\nA fair-sized city drawing-room of these sumptuous contemporary days\r\ncould stow away in a corner the entire structure which then became our\r\nhabitation, and retain space enough outside it for the exploitation of\r\nsocial functions. Nevertheless, by the simple expedient of making the\r\ninterior divisions small enough, this liliputian edifice managed to\r\ncontain eight rooms on its two floors (including the kitchen). One of\r\nthe rooms was, in fact, the entrance-hall; you stepped into it across\r\nthe threshold of the outer door, and the staircase ascended from it. It\r\nwas used as an extension of the drawing-room, which opened out of it.\r\nThe drawing-room adjoined the dining-room, with windows facing the\r\nwest, with a view of the mountains across the lake, and the dining-room\r\ncommunicated with the kitchen. One of the western-looking up-stairs\r\nrooms served as my father's study; my sister Una had her chamber, I mine\r\n(which was employed as the guest-chamber upon occasion), and our parents\r\nthe other. What more could be asked? for when Rose was born, her crib\r\nstood beside her mother's bedstead.\r\n\r\nWhen we were not asleep--that is, during twelve hours out of the\r\ntwenty-four--Una's existence and mine were passed mainly in the outer\r\nsitting-room and in the dining-room. There was plenty to entertain us.\r\nI had my rocking-horse, which I bestrode with perfect fearlessness; my\r\nporcelain lion, which still survives unscathed after the cataclysms\r\nof half a century; my toy sloop, made for me by Uncle Nat; and a\r\njack-knife, all but the edge and point, which had been removed out of\r\ndeference to my youth. Una had a doll, a miniature mahogany centre-table\r\nand bureau, and other things in which I felt no interest. In common,\r\nwe possessed the box of wooden bricks, and the big portfolio containing\r\ntracings by my mother, exquisitely done, of Flaxman's \"Outlines of the\r\nIliad and Odyssey\" and other classic subjects. We knew by heart the\r\nstory of all these mythological personages, and they formed a large\r\npart of our life. They also served the important use of suggesting to my\r\nfather his Wonder-Book and Tanglewood Tales stories, and, together with\r\nthe figures of Gothic fairy-lore, they were the only playmates, with the\r\nexception of our father and mother, that we had or desired.\r\n\r\nBut our father and mother were, of course, the main thing, after all.\r\nShe was with us all day long; he, from the time he stopped writing,\r\nearly in the afternoon, till our bed-time. They answered all our\r\nquestions about things animate and inanimate, physical and metaphysical;\r\nand that must have taken time, for our curiosity was magnificent; and\r\n\"The Old Boy,\" my father records, \"asked me today what were sensible\r\nquestions--I suppose with a view to asking me some.\" They superintended\r\nour projections of creation on the black-board--a great, old-fashioned\r\nblack-board, the like of which I have not since beheld; they read to us\r\nand told us stories. Many of these stories were of incidents of their\r\nown child-life; and there was also the narrative of our mother's voyage\r\nto Cuba and back, and residence there when she was about eighteen or\r\ntwenty--a fascinating chronicle. Meal-times were delectable festivals,\r\nnot only because the bread-and-milk, the boiled rice and tapioca\r\npudding, and eggs and fruit tasted so good, but by reason of the broad\r\noutlook out of window over the field, the wood, the lake, and the\r\nmountains; supper-time, with the declining sun pouring light into\r\nthe little room and making the landscape glorious, was especially\r\nexhilarating. Ambrosial was the bread baked by Mrs. Peters, the taciturn\r\nand serious religious person of color who attended to our cooking; the\r\nprize morsels were the ends, golden brown in hue, crunching so crisply\r\nbetween our teeth. I used to wonder how a being with hands so dark as\r\nthose of Mrs. Peters managed to turn out dough so immaculate. She would\r\nplunge them right into the ivory-hued substance, yet it became only\r\nwhiter than before. But the life of life was, of course, out-doors.\r\nThere was a barn containing a hay-mow and a large hen-coop, soon\r\npopulous with hens and chickens, with an heroic snow-white rooster to\r\nkeep them in order. Hens are the most audacious and presuming of pets,\r\nand they have strong individuality.\r\n\r\nOne of our brood was more intellectual and enterprising than the others;\r\nshe found a way of getting out of the coop, no matter how tightly it\r\nwas shut up; and she would jump in our laps as we sat eating a piece\r\nof bread in the barn doorway and snatch it away from us; but I think we\r\nsometimes sat there with the bread on purpose to have her do it. Once or\r\ntwice--until I was detected and stopped--I enjoyed the poignant delight\r\nof fishing for hens out of the barn loft; my tackle consisted of a bent\r\npin at the end of a string tied to a stick. It was baited with a grain\r\nof corn, or a bit of rag would do as well, for hens have no hereditary\r\nsuspicion of anglers, and are much more readily entrapped than fishes.\r\nPulling them up, squawking and fluttering, was thrilling, but, of\r\ncourse, it was wrong, like other thrilling things, and had to be\r\nforegone. A less unregenerate experiment was fastening two grains of\r\ncorn to the ends of a long bit of thread; two hens would seize each\r\na grain and begin swallowing thread until they interfered, with each\r\nother, when a disgorgement would take place. It was an economical\r\nsport--the one bit of thread and the two corn-grains would last all\r\nday--and, in view of the joy afforded to the spectators, did not seem\r\ntoo unkind. My father had mechanical talent, and with an old door-knob\r\nand some strips of shingle he would make a figure of a man with a saw;\r\nyou fixed it to the edge of a table, set the door-knob swinging, and the\r\ncreature would saw with the most absurd diligence. From the same shingle\r\nhe would construct a pugilist, who, being set up where the wind played\r\nupon him, would swing his arms interminably. It was yacht-building,\r\nhowever, that afforded us most entertainment. A shingle was whittled to\r\na point at one end; a stick with a square paper slipped on it was stuck\r\nup in the middle, and a rudder made fast to the stern; such a boat would\r\nsail boldly out upon the vastness of the lake, till the eye could no\r\nlonger follow the diminishing white speck. These days beside the lake\r\nwere full of good things. The water was clear, with a white sand bottom;\r\nwe were given swimming-lessons in the hot summer weather; having waded\r\nin up to our middles, we faced towards the shore, where sat our father\r\nwith a long fishing-pole, the end of which he kept within our reach,\r\nand bade us lean forward on the water and kick up our feet. But, for my\r\npart, I kept one foot on the bottom. It was not till years afterwards\r\nthat I mustered courage to take it off, and that was in a lake three\r\nthousand miles from Stockbridge Bowl, with the towers of the castle of\r\nChillon reflected in its calm surface.\r\n\r\nWe also made limited use of a leaky old punt, which one day capsized and\r\nemptied its whole crew into the water, luckily close to shore. We fished\r\nfor gold carp for hours together, and during our two summers we caught a\r\ncouple of them; there were thousands of them swimming about; but a bent\r\npin with the bait washed off is not a good lure. In winter, the lake had\r\nfive feet of ice on it, which lasted far into the spring, and once or\r\ntwice we got aboard this great raft and tracked across it, with as much\r\nawe and enthusiasm as ever Kane had felt in his arctic explorations. In\r\nall, we became intimate friends with the lake idea, new to us then, but\r\nnever to grow stale; and our good fortune favored us during after-life\r\nwith many lovely lakes and ponds, including such gems as Rydal, Walden,\r\nand Geneva.\r\n\r\nWater, in another enchanting guise, dashed and gurgled for us in the\r\nbrook that penetrated like a happy dream the slumber of the forest that\r\nbordered on the lake. The wooded declivity through which it went was\r\njust enough to keep it ever vocal and animated. Gazing down upon it, it\r\nwas clear brown, with glancing gleams of interior green, and sparkles\r\ndiamond white; tiny fishes switched themselves against the current with\r\nquivering tails; the shaggy margins were flecked with sunshine, and\r\nbeautiful with columbines, violets, arbutus, and houstonias. Fragments\r\nof rock and large pebbles interrupted its flow and deepened its mellow\r\nsong; above it brooded the twilight of the tall pines and walnuts,\r\nresponding to its merriment with solemn murmurings. What playfellow is\r\nmore inexhaustible than such a brook, so full of life, of motion, of\r\nsound and color, of variety and constancy. A child welcomes it as an\r\nanswer to its own soul, with its mystery and transparency, its bounded\r\nlawlessness, its love of earth and its echoes of the sky. In winter our\r\nbrook had a new charm: it ran beneath a roof of ice, often mounded with\r\nsnow; its voice sounding cheerful as ever in those inscrutable caverns,\r\nas if it discoursed secret wonders of fairy-land, and carried treasures\r\nof the elves and gnomes. Zero, with his utmost rigors, could not still\r\nits speech for a day or fix his grip upon those elastic limbs. Indeed,\r\nthe frosty god conspired with it for our delight; building crystal\r\nbridges, with tracery of lace delicater than Valenciennes, and spangled\r\nstring-pieces, and fretted vaultings, whimsical sierras, stalactite and\r\nstalagmite. An icicle is one of those careless toys of nature which\r\nthe decorative art of man imitates in vain. They are among the myriad\r\ndecorations of children's palaces.\r\n\r\nTo Tanglewood, as we called it, at all seasons of the year, came\r\nHawthorne and his wife and children. In spring there was the issuing\r\nforth of the new life from beneath the winter coverlid; the first\r\ndiscovery of sociable houstonias, and the exquisite tints and fragrance\r\nof the mayflower on its dark, bearded stalk. When June became perfect,\r\nand afterwards till nuts were ripe, my father loved to lie at full\r\nlength upon the mossy and leaf-strewn floor, looking up at the green\r\nroof, the lofty whispering-gallery of vaulted boughs, with its azure\r\nlattices and descending sunlight-shafts; wrapped in imaginings some of\r\nwhich were afterwards to delight the world; but many more of them, no\r\ndoubt, were fated to join the glorious company of untold tales. Beside\r\nhim sat our mother, on a throne which we had fashioned for her from the\r\nupright stump of a tree; round about them played the little girl and\r\nboy. They brought all the treasures which this wonderfully affluent\r\nworld afforded: flowers in all seasons; strawberries, small but of\r\npotent flavor, which the little boy would gather with earnest diligence,\r\nand fetch to the persons he loved, mashed into premature jam in his\r\nsmall fist; exciting turtles with variegated carapaces, and heads and\r\nfeet that went in and out; occasional newts from the plashy places; and\r\nin autumn, hatfuls of walnuts. There were chestnuts, too, upon whose\r\nprickly hulls the preoccupied children would sometimes inadvertently\r\nplump themselves. Our father was a great tree-climber, and he was also\r\nfond of playing the role of magician. \"Hide your eyes!\" he would say,\r\nand the next moment, from being there beside us on the moss, we would\r\nhear his voice descending from the sky, and behold! he swung among the\r\ntopmost branches, showering down upon us a hail-storm of nuts. There was\r\na big cavern behind the kitchen chimney, which gradually became filled\r\nwith these harvests, and on winter evenings they were brought forth and\r\ncracked with a hammer on the hearth-stone.\r\n\r\nThe wide field, or croft, which sloped from the house to the wood was\r\nthickly grown with mullein-stalks, against which I waged war with an\r\nupper section of one of my father's old broken canes, for I took them\r\nfor giants, and stubborn, evil-minded enchanters. I slew them by scores;\r\nbut I could make no way against the grasshoppers, which jumped against\r\nmy bare legs and pricked them. There were wasps, too; one of them stung\r\nUna on the lower lip as she was climbing over a rail-fence. Her lip at\r\nonce assumed a Bourbon contour, and I reached the conclusion, by some\r\ntacit syllogism of infancy, that the rail-fence was at least half to\r\nblame for the catastrophe, and always carefully avoided it. I likewise\r\navoided the wasps; a certain trick they have of giving a hitch to their\r\nafter-parts as they walk along always struck me as being obviously\r\ndiabolical.\r\n\r\nWhen the snows came, two and three feet deep, we got out the family\r\nsled from its summer lodging in the barn and went forth, muffled in\r\ninterminable knit tippets and other woollen armor, to coast down the\r\nlong slope. Our father sat in front with the reins in his hands and his\r\nfeet thrust out to steer, and away we went clinging fast behind him.\r\nSometimes we swept triumphantly to the bottom; at other times we\r\nwould collide with some hidden obstacle, and describe each a separate\r\ntrajectory into the snow-banks. We made enormous snow-balls by beginning\r\nwith a small one and rolling it over and over in the soft snow till\r\nit waxed too vast for our strength; two or three of these piled one on\r\nanother would be sculptured by the author of The Scarlet Letter into a\r\nsnow-man, who would stand stanch for weeks. Snow-storms in Lenox began\r\nearly and lasted till far into April. The little red house had all it\r\ncould do, sometimes, to lift its upper windows above them. In the front\r\nyard there was a symmetrical balsam fir-tree, tapering like a Chinese\r\npagoda. One winter morning we found upon one of its lower boughs a\r\nlittle brown sparrow frozen stiff. We put it in a card-board coffin, and\r\ndug out a grave for it beneath the fir, with a shingle head-stone. The\r\nfuneral ceremonies had for the two mourners a solemnity such as is not\r\nalways felt at such functions in later life.\r\n\r\nOf the regular daily routine was the journey to Luther Butler's, quarter\r\nof a mile up the road, for milk and butter. I generally accompanied\r\nmy father, and saw placid Luther's cows, placid as himself, with their\r\nbroad, wet noses, amiable dark eyes, questionable horns, and ambrosial\r\nbreath. Mr. Tappan, our landlord, had horses, and once he mounted me on\r\nthe bare back of one of the largest of these quadrupeds, which, to the\r\nstupefaction of everybody, instantly set off at full gallop. Down\r\nthe road we thundered, the rider, with his legs sticking out at right\r\nangles, screaming with joy, for this transcended any rocking-horse\r\nexperiences. A hundred yards away there was a bend in the road. Just at\r\nthat point there was a manure-pile, which had long bided its time. I had\r\nhold of a strand of the horse's mane; but when he swerved at the bend I\r\nhad to let go, and after a short flight in air, the manure-pile received\r\nme in its soft embrace. Looking up the road, I saw Mr. Tappan, with\r\ndilated eyes and a countenance expressing keen emotion, coming towards\r\nme at a wonderful pace, and my father and mother following him at a\r\nshort distance. I did not myself mind the smell of manure, and the\r\nothers were glad to put up with it in consideration of my having escaped\r\nbroken bones.\r\n\r\nWe did not keep a dog, but Herman Melville, who often came over from\r\nPittsfield, had a large Newfoundland which he sometimes brought with,\r\nhim, and Mr. G. P. R. James, a novelist of the Walter Scott school, had\r\nanother, and I was permitted to bestride both of them; they were safe\r\nenough, but they would turn back their heads and lay their cold noses on\r\nmy leg; I preferred the now-forbidden horse. But Melville himself made\r\nup for everything by the tremendous stories he used to tell about the\r\nSouth Sea Islands and the whale fishery. Normally he was not a man of\r\nnoticeable appearance; but when the narrative inspiration was on him, he\r\nlooked like all the things he was describing--savages, sea-captains, the\r\nlovely Fayaway in her canoe, or the terrible Moby Dick himself. There\r\nwas vivid genius in this man, and he was the strangest being that ever\r\ncame into our circle. Through all his wild and reckless adventures,\r\nof which a small part only got into his fascinating books, he had been\r\nunable to rid himself of a Puritan conscience; he afterwards tried to\r\nloosen its grip by studying German metaphysics, but in vain. He was\r\nrestless and disposed to dark hours, and there is reason to suspect\r\nthat there was in him a vein of insanity. His later writings were\r\nincomprehensible. When we were living in England, he passed through the\r\nmidst of us on one of his aimless, mysterious journeys round the world;\r\nand when I was in New York, in 1884, I met him, looking pale, sombre,\r\nnervous, but little touched by age. He died a few years later. He\r\nconceived the highest admiration for my father's genius, and a deep\r\naffection for him personally; but he told me, during our talk, that he\r\nwas convinced that there was some secret in my father's life which had\r\nnever been revealed, and which accounted for the gloomy passages in\r\nhis books. It was characteristic in him to imagine so; there were many\r\nsecrets untold in his own career. But there were few honester or more\r\nlovable men than Herman Melville.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: HERMAN MELVILLE]\r\n\r\nJames (no relation of our distinguished contemporary) was a commonplace,\r\nmeritorious person, with much blameless and intelligent conversation;\r\nbut the only thing that recalls him personally to my memory is the fact\r\nof his being associated with a furious thunder-storm. My father and I\r\nwere alone in the house at the time; my mother had gone to West Newton\r\non a three weeks' visit. In the midst of the thunder and lightning, the\r\ndownpour and the hurricane, the crash of matter and the wreck of worlds,\r\nour door burst open, and behold! of all persons in the world to be\r\nheralded by such circumstances, G. P. R. James! Not he only, but close\r\nupon his heels his entire family, numerous, orthodox, admirable, and\r\ninfinitely undesirable to two secluded gentlemen without a wife\r\nand mother to help them out. But it was a choice between murder and\r\nhospitality, and come in they must. Never before or after did our\r\nliliputian drawing-room harbor so large an assemblage. They dripped on\r\nthe carpet, they were conventional and courteous; we made conversation\r\nbetween us; but whenever the thunder rolled, Mrs. James became ghastly\r\npale. Mr. James explained that this was his birthday, and that they were\r\non a pleasure excursion. He conciliated me by anecdotes of a pet magpie\r\nor raven who stole spoons. At last, the thunder-storm and the G. P. R.\r\nJameses passed off together.\r\n\r\nThere were many other visitors, not only old friends, but persons\r\nattracted thither out of the void by the fame of the book \"along whose\r\nburning leaves,\" as Oliver Wendell Holmes sang of it, \"his scarlet web\r\nour wild romancer weaves.\" It was a novel experience for the man who had\r\nbecome accustomed to regarding himself as the obscurest man of letters\r\nin America. Lonely, yearning ladies came; enthusiastic young men;\r\nmelancholy sinners. The little red house was not a literary Mecca only,\r\nbut a moral one. The dark-browed, kindly smiling author received them\r\nall courteously; he was invariably courteous. \"I would not have a\r\ndrunken man politer than I,\" he once answered me, when I asked him why\r\nhe had returned the salutation of a toper. What counsel he gave to\r\nthose who came to him as to a father confessor of course I know not; but\r\nlater, when I used to sit in his office in the Liverpool consulate,\r\nI sometimes heard him speak plain truths to the waifs and strays who\r\ndrifted in there; and truth more plain, yet bestowed with more humanity\r\nand brotherly purpose, I have never heard since. It made them tremble,\r\nbut it did them good. Such things made him suffer, but he never\r\nflinched from the occasion by a hair's-breadth. He must have loved his\r\nfellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nSomebody gave me a rabbit, which I named Hind-legs. I was deeply\r\ninterested in him for a while, especially when I learned that he could\r\nnot drink water; but he lasted only two weeks, and I am under the\r\nimpression that I killed him. Not that I loved him less; but children\r\nare prone to experiment with this singular thing called life when it\r\nis in their power. They do not believe that death can be other than\r\na transient phenomenon; the lifeless body may puzzle, but it does not\r\nconvince them. I was certainly not a cruel urchin, and I can recall\r\nnone but cordial sentiments towards Hindlegs on my part. I remember no\r\ndetails of the murder, if murder were done; but I do remember feeling\r\nno surprise when, one morning, Hindlegs was found dead. After so many\r\nyears, I will not bring against the owner of Hindlegs a verdict of\r\npositive guilt; but I suspect him. Hindlegs, at all events, achieved\r\nan immortality which can belong to few of his brethren; for my father,\r\nafter pooh-poohing the imbecile little bundle of fur for a day or two,\r\nconceived an involuntary affection for him, and reported his character\r\nand habits in his journal in a manner which is likely to keep his memory\r\nalive long after the hand that (perhaps) slew him is dust.\r\n\r\nIn default of dogs and Hindlegs, we had abundant cats. My father was\r\nalways fond of these mysterious deities of ancient Egypt, and they were\r\nnever turned away from our doors; but how so many of them happened\r\nto find us out in this remote region I cannot explain. It seems as if\r\ngoodwill towards cats spontaneously generated them. They appeared, one\r\nafter another, to the number of five; but when the time came for us to\r\nleave the red house forever, the cats would not and could not be packed\r\nup, and they were left behind. In my mind's eye I still see them,\r\nsquatting abreast, silhouetted against the sky, on the brow of the hill\r\nas we drove down the road; for they had scampered after our carry-all\r\nwhen we drove away. Cats teach Americans what they are slow to\r\nlearn--the sanctity and permanence of home.\r\n\r\nBut Lenox could not be a home for us. It was, indeed, a paradise for\r\nthe children; but the children's father was never well there. He had a\r\nsuccession of colds--as those affections are called; it was ascribed to\r\nthe variations of temperature during the summers; but the temperature\r\nwould not have troubled him had he not been hard hit before he went\r\nto Berkshire. He got out of patience with the climate, and was wont\r\nto anathematize it with humorous extravagance, as his way was: \"It is\r\nhorrible. One knows not for ten minutes together whether he is too cool\r\nor too warm. I detest it! I hate Berkshire with my whole soul. Here,\r\nwhere I had hoped for perfect health, I have for the first time been\r\nmade sensible that I cannot with impunity encounter nature in all her\r\nmoods.\" It was the summers that disagreed with him. \"Upon the whole,\"\r\nhe said, \"I think that the best time for living in the country is the\r\nwinter.\" It was during the winter that he did most of his writing. The\r\nHouse of the Seven Gables was written between September of 1850 and\r\nJanuary or February of 1851.\r\n\r\nBut composition took more out of him than formerly. He admitted to his\r\nsister Louisa that he was \"a little worn down with constant work,\" and\r\nadded that he could not afford any idle time now, being evidently of the\r\nopinion that his popularity would be short-lived, and that it behooved\r\nhim, therefore, to make the most of it. But \"the pen is so constantly\r\nin my fingers that I abominate the sight of it!\" he exclaimed. This was\r\nafter he had transgressed his custom of never writing in the hot months.\r\nHe began in June and finished in forty days the whole volume of The\r\nWonder-Book. He also read the tales to his domestic audience as fast as\r\nthey were written, and benefited, perhaps, by the expert criticism of\r\nthe small people. Many passages in the intercalated chapters, describing\r\nthe adventures of Eustace Bright and the Tangle-wood children, are based\r\non facts well known to his own two youngsters. And when Eustace tells\r\nhis hearers that if the dark-haired man dwelling in the cottage yonder\r\nwere simply to put some sheets of writing-paper in the fire, all of them\r\nand Tangle-wood itself would turn into cinders and vanish in smoke up\r\nthe chimney--even the present chronicler saw the point; though, at\r\nthe same time, he somehow could not help believing in the reality of\r\nPrimrose, Buttercup, Dandelion, Squash-blossom, and the rest. Thus early\r\ndid he begin to grasp the philosophy of the truth of fiction.\r\n\r\nThe House of the Seven Gables and The Wonder-Book were a fair\r\neighteen-months' work, and in addition to them Hawthorne had, before\r\nleaving Lenox, planned out the story of The Blithedale Romance; so\r\nthat after we got to West Newton--our half-way station on the road to\r\nConcord--he was prepared to sit down and write it. Long before we left\r\nConcord for England he had published Tangle-wood Tales, not to mention\r\nthe biography of Franklin Pierce. Una and her brother knew nothing about\r\nthe romances; they knew and approved the fairy tales; but their feeling\r\nabout all their father's writings was, that he was being wasted in his\r\nstudy, when he might be with them, and there could be nothing in any\r\nbooks, whether his own or other authors', that could for a moment bear\r\ncomparison with his actual companionship. What he set down upon the page\r\nwas but a less free and rich version of the things that came from his\r\nliving mouth in our heedless playtimes. \"If only papa wouldn't write,\r\nhow nice it would be!\" And, indeed, a book is but a poor substitute for\r\nthe mind and heart of a man, and it exists only as one of the numberless\r\nsorry makeshifts to which time constrains us, while we are waiting for\r\neternity and full communion.\r\n\r\nIt was a dreary day in the beginning of the second winter that we set\r\nout on our eastward journey; but Hawthorne's face was brighter than the\r\nweather warranted, for it was turned once more towards the sea. We were\r\ndestined, ere we turned back, to go much farther towards the rising\r\nsun than any of us then suspected. We took with us one who had not been\r\npresent at our coming--a little auburn-haired baby, born in May. Which\r\nare the happiest years of a man's life? Those in which he is too much\r\noccupied with present felicity to look either forward or backward--to\r\nhope or to remember. There are no such years; but such moments there may\r\nbe, and perhaps there were as many such moments awaiting Hawthorne as\r\nhad already passed.\r\n\r\nHis greatest work was done before he left his native land, and within\r\na year or two of his death he wrote to Richard Stoddard: \"I have been a\r\nhappy man, and yet I cannot remember any moment of such happy conspiring\r\ncircumstances that I would have rung a joy-bell at it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n     Chariots of delight--West Newton--Raw American life--Baby's\r\n     fingers--Our cousin Benjamin's untoward head--Our uncle\r\n     Horace--His vacuum--A reformer's bristles--Grace Greenwood's\r\n     first tears--The heralding of Kossuth--The decorated engine--\r\n     The chief incident of the reception--Blithedale and Brook\r\n     Farm--Notes from real life--Rough draughts--Paths of\r\n     composition--The struggle with the Pensioner--Hawthorne's\r\n     method--The invitation of Concord--Four wooden walls and a\r\n     roof--Mr. Alcott's aesthetic carpentering--Appurtenances of\r\n     \"The Wayside\"--Franklin Pierce for President\"--The most\r\n     homeless people in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe sky that overhung Hawthorne's departure from Lenox was gray with\r\nimpending snow, and the flakes had begun to fall ere the vehicle in\r\nwhich his family was ensconced had reached the railway station in\r\nPittsfield. Travel had few amenities in those days. The cars were\r\nall plain cars, with nothing to recommend them except that they went\r\ntolerably fast--from twenty to thirty miles an hour. They were chariots\r\nof delight to the children, who were especially happy in occupying the\r\nlast car of the train, from the rear windows of which they could look\r\ndown upon the tracks, which seemed to slide miraculously away from\r\nbeneath them. The conductor collected the tickets--a mysterious rite.\r\nThe gradually whitening landscape fled past, becoming ever more level\r\nas we proceeded; by-and-by there was a welcome unpacking of the\r\nluncheon-basket, and all the while there were the endless questions to\r\nbe asked and faithfully answered. It was already dark by the time we\r\nwere bundled out at the grimy shed which was called the depot, at West\r\nNewton, where we were met by the Horace Manns, and somehow the transit\r\nto the latter's house, which we were to occupy for the winter, was made.\r\nThe scene was gloomy and unpleasant; the change from the mountains\r\nof the west depressing; and, for my part, I cannot remember anything\r\nagreeable in this raw little suburb. American life half a century ago\r\nhad a great deal of rawness about it, and its external aspect was ugly\r\nbeyond present belief. We may be a less virtuous nation now than we were\r\nthen, but we are indescribably more good to look at. And the West Newton\r\nof to-day, as compared with that of 1851, will serve for an illustration\r\nof this truth.\r\n\r\nHorace Mann's house was a small frame dwelling, painted white, with\r\ngreen blinds, and furnished with a furnace stiflingly hot. One of\r\nthe first things the baby did was to crawl under the sofa in the\r\nsitting-room and lay her small fingers against the radiator or register,\r\nor whatever it is called, through which the heat came. She withdrew them\r\nwith a bitter outcry, and on the tip of each was a blister as big as the\r\ntip itself. We had no glorious out-door playground in West Newton; it\r\nwas a matter of back yards and sullen streets. The snow kept piling up,\r\nweek after week; but there was no opportunity to put it to its proper\r\nuse of coasting. The only redeeming feature of the physical situation\r\nthat I recall is the momentous fact of a first pair of red-topped boots.\r\nThey were very uncomfortable, and always either wet or stiff as iron\r\nfrom over-dryness; but they made their wearer as happy as they have made\r\nall other boys since boots began. A boy of six with high boots is bigger\r\nthan most men.\r\n\r\nBut if the outward life was on the whole unprepossessing, inward\r\nsucculence was not lacking. We had the Manns, to begin with, and the\r\nfirst real acquaintance between the two sets of children opened here.\r\nMary Peabody, my mother's elder sister, had married Horace Mann, whose\r\nname is honorably identified with the development in this country of\r\ncommon-school education. They had three children, of about our age,\r\nall boys. A statue in bronze of Horace Mann stands in front of the\r\nState-house in Boston, and the memory of the strenuous reformer well\r\nmerits the distinction. He took things seriously and rather grimly, and\r\nwas always emphatically in earnest. He was a friend of George Combe, the\r\nphrenologist, after whom his second boy was named; and he was himself\r\nso ardent a believer in the new science that when his younger son,\r\nBenjamin, was submitted to him for criticism at a very early age he\r\ndeclared, after a strict phrenological examination, that he was not\r\nworth bringing up. But children's heads sometimes undergo strange\r\ntransformations as they grow up, and Benjamin lived to refute abundantly\r\nhis father's too hasty conclusion in his case. He became eminent as an\r\nentomologist; George followed the example of his father on educational\r\nlines. Horace, who died comparatively early, was an enthusiastic\r\nnaturalist, who received the unstinted praise and confidence of the\r\ngreat Agassiz. My uncle Horace, as I remember him, was a very tall\r\nman, of somewhat meagre build, a chronic sufferer from headaches and\r\ndyspepsia. His hair was sandy, straight, rather long, and very thick; it\r\nhung down uncompromisingly round his head. His face was a long square,\r\nwith a mouth and chin large and immitigably firm. His eyes were\r\nreinforced by a glistening pair of gold-bowed spectacles. He always wore\r\na long-skirted black coat. His aspect was a little intimidating to small\r\npeople; but there were lovely qualities in his nature, his character\r\nwas touchingly noble and generous, and the world knows the worth of his\r\nintellect. He was anxious, exacting, and dogmatic, and was not always\r\nable to concede that persons who differed from him in opinion could\r\nbe morally normal. This was especially noticeable when the topic of\r\nabolition happened to come up for discussion; Horace Mann was ready\r\nto out-Garrison Garrison; he thought Uncle Tom's Cabin a somewhat\r\nmilk-and-water tract. He was convinced that Tophet was the future home\r\nof all slave-holders, and really too good for them, and he practically\r\nworshipped the negro. Had he occupied a seat in Congress at that\r\njuncture, it is likely that the civil war might have been started a\r\ndecade sooner than it was. My father and mother were much more moderate\r\nin their view of the situation, and my mother used to say that if\r\nslavery was really so evil and demoralizing a thing as the abolitionists\r\nasserted, it was singular that they should canonize all the subjects of\r\nthe institution. But, as a rule, all controversy with the indignant zeal\r\nof our relative was avoided; in his eyes any approach to a philosophical\r\nattitude on the burning question was a crime. Nor were his convictions\r\nless pronounced on the subject of total abstinence from liquor and\r\ntobacco. Now, my father smoked an occasional cigar, and it once came\r\nabout that he was led to mention the fact in Horace Mann's hearing. The\r\nreformer's bristles were set in a moment. \"Do I understand you to say,\r\nMr. Hawthorne, that you actually use tobacco?\" \"Yes, I smoke a cigar\r\nonce in a while,\" replied my father, comfortably. Horace Mann could not\r\nkeep his seat; he started up and paced the room menacingly. He had a\r\nhigh admiration for my father's genius, and a deep affection for him\r\nas a man, and this infidelity to the true faith seemed to him the more\r\nappalling. But he would be true to his colors at all costs, and after\r\na few moments he planted himself, tall and tragic, before his\r\ninterlocutor, and spoke, in a husky voice, to this effect: \"Then, Mr.\r\nHawthorne, it is my duty to tell you that I no longer have the same\r\nrespect for you that I have had.\" Then he turned and strode from the\r\nroom, leaving the excommunicated one to his reflections. Faithful are\r\nthe wounds of a friend, and my father was as much touched as he was\r\namused by this example of my uncle's candor. Of course, there was a\r\ngreat vacuum in the place where my uncle's sense of humor might have\r\nbeen; but there are a time and place for such men as he, and more than\r\nonce the men without sense of humor have moved the world.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Manns, there were visitors--the succession of whom,\r\nindeed, was henceforth to continue till the end of my father's earthly\r\npilgrimage. Among the earliest to arrive was Grace Greenwood, wading\r\nenergetically to our door through the December snow. She was one of the\r\nfirst, if not the first, of the tribe of women correspondents; she had\r\nlately returned, I think, from England, and the volume of her letters\r\nfrom that strange country was in everybody's hands. She was then a young\r\nwoman, large and handsome, with dark hair and complexion, and large,\r\nexpressive eyes, harmonious, aquiline features, and a picturesque\r\nappearance. She wore her hair in abundant curls; she exhaled an\r\natmosphere of romance, of graceful and ardent emotions, and of almost\r\noverpowering sentiment. In fact, she had a genuine gift for expression\r\nand description, and she made an impression in contemporary letters. We\r\nmight smile now--and, in truth, we sometimes did then--over some of her\r\npages; but much of her work would still be called good, if resuscitated\r\nfrom the dusty book-shelves of the past. I remember one passage in her\r\nEnglish Letters which was often quoted in our family circle as a typical\r\nillustration of the intensity of the period: \"The first tears,\" wrote\r\nGrace, \"that I had shed since leaving my dear native land fell fast into\r\nthe red heart of an English rose!\" Nothing could be better than that;\r\nbut the volume was full of similar felicities. You were swimming in\r\nradiant tides of enthusiastic appreciation, quotations from the poets\r\nand poetical rhapsodies; incidents of travel, humorous, pathetic, and\r\ngraphic; swirling eddies of word-painting, of moral and ethical and\r\nhistorical reflection; withal, an immense, amiable, innocent, sprawling\r\ntemperament. And as was her book, so was Grace herself; indeed, if any\r\none could outdo the book in personal conversation, Grace was that happy\r\nindividual. What she accomplished when she embarked, full-sailed, upon\r\nthe topic of The Scarlet Letter and The House of the Seven Gables may\r\nbe pictured to themselves by persons endowed with the rudiments of\r\nimagination; I must not attempt to adorn this sober page with an\r\nattempted reproduction of the scene. Mortal language reeled and cracked\r\nunder the strain of giving form to her admiration; but it was so honest\r\nand well meant that it could not but give pleasure even in the midst of\r\nbewilderment. My father bowed his head with a painful smile; but I dare\r\nsay it did him good when the ordeal was over.\r\n\r\nAt this time the reverberations of the European revolutionary year,\r\n1848, were still breaking upon our shores. President Polk had given\r\nmortal offence to Austria by sending over a special commissioner to\r\ndetermine whether the seceding state of Hungary might be recognized as\r\na belligerent. In 1850 the Austrian representative, Baron Huelsmann,\r\nhad entered upon a correspondence with our own Daniel Webster. The baron\r\nremonstrated, and Daniel mounted upon the national bird and soared in\r\nthe patriotic empyrean. The eloquence of the Secretary of State perhaps\r\naroused unwarranted expectations in the breasts of the struggling\r\nrevolutionists, and the Hungarian man of eloquence set out for the\r\nUnited States to take the occasion by the forelock. Not since the visit\r\nof Lafayette had any foreigner been received here with such testimonials\r\nof public enthusiasm, or listened to by such applausive audiences:\r\ncertainly none had ever been sent home again with less wool to show for\r\nso much cry. In 1851, the name of Kossuth was the most popular in the\r\ncountry, and when it was learned that he had accepted an invitation to\r\nspeak in our little West Newton, we felt as if we were almost embarked\r\nupon a campaign--upon an altruistic campaign of emancipation against the\r\nHapsburg oppressor. The excitement was not confined to persons of mature\r\nage and understanding; it raged among the smaller fry, and every boy\r\nwas a champion of Kossuth. The train conveying the hero from New York\r\nto Boston (whence he was to return to West Newton after the reception\r\nthere) was timed to pass through our midst at three o 'clock in the\r\nafternoon, and our entire population was at the track-side to see it go\r\nby. After one or two false alarms it came in sight round the curve, the\r\nsmokestack of the engine swathed in voluminous folds of Old Glory. The\r\nsmoke-stacks of those days were not like our scientific present-day\r\nones; they were huge, inverted cones, affording ample surface for\r\ndecoration. The train did not stop at our station; but Kossuth no doubt\r\nlooked out of the window as he flew past and bowed his acknowledgments\r\nof our cheers. He was to return to us the next day, and, meanwhile, the\r\ntown-hall, or the church, or whatever building it was that was to be the\r\nscene of his West Newton triumph was put in order for his reception. The\r\nperson who writes these words, whose ears had eagerly devoured the story\r\nof the Hungarian revolt, wished to give the august visitor some personal\r\nassurance of his distinguished consideration, and it was finally agreed\r\nby his indulgent parents that he should print upon a card the legend,\r\n\"GOD BLESS YOU, KOSSUTH,\" and be afforded an opportunity personally to\r\npresent it to the guest of the nation. Many cards had been used and\r\ncast aside before the scribe, his fingers tremulous with emotion, had\r\nproduced something which the Hungarian might be reasonably expected to\r\nfind legible. Then, supported by his father and mother, and with his\r\nuncles, aunts, and cousins doubtless not far off, he proceeded proudly\r\nbut falteringly to the scene of the presentation. He dimly recalls a\r\nlarge interior space, profusely decorated with stars and stripes, and\r\nalso the colors of Hungary. At the head of the room was a great placard\r\nwith \"WELCOME, KOSSUTH\" inscribed upon it. There was a great throng\r\nand press of men and women, a subdued, omnipresent roar of talk, and a\r\nsetting of the tide towards the place where the patriot stood to receive\r\nour personal greetings. The scribe whom I have mentioned, being as\r\nyet brief of stature, was unable to see anything except coat-tails\r\nand petticoats, until of a sudden there was a breaking away of these\r\nobstacles and he found himself in close proximity to a gentleman\r\nof medium height, strongly built, with a mop of dark hair framing a\r\nhandsome, pale, smiling face, the lower parts of which were concealed\r\nby a thick brown beard. It was Kossuth, and there was that in his\r\ncountenance and expression which satisfied all the dreams of his\r\nadmirer. He was chatting and shaking hands with the elder persons; and\r\nin a minute we were moving on again, and the printed card, for which\r\nthe whole function had been created, had not been presented. At the\r\nlast moment, in an agony of apprehension, the boy pulled at his mother's\r\nskirt and whispered piteously, \"But my card!\" She heard and remembered;\r\nbut need was for haste; we had already passed the vantage-point. She\r\nsnatched it from the tightly gripping fingers of the bearer, handed\r\nit to Kossuth, and at the same moment, with a gesture, directed his\r\nattention to her small companion. The Hungarian read the inscription\r\nat a glance, looked me in the eyes with a quick smile of comprehension,\r\nand, stepping towards me, laid his hand upon my head. It was a great\r\nmoment for me; but as I went away I suddenly dissolved in tears, whether\r\nfrom the reaction of emotion, or because I had not myself succeeded in\r\ndelivering my gift, I cannot now determine. But Kossuth thereby became,\r\nand for years he continued to be, the most superb figure in my political\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nAll this while The Blithedale Romance was being written. Inasmuch as it\r\nwas finished on the last day of April, 1852, it could not have occupied\r\nthe writer more than five months in the composition. Winter was his best\r\ntime for literary work, and there was winter enough that year in West\r\nNewton. In the middle of April came the heaviest snowstorm of the\r\nseason. Brook Farm (modified in certain respects to suit the conditions)\r\nwas the scene of the story, and Brook Farm was within a fair walk of\r\nWest Newton. I visited the place some thirty years later, and found the\r\ngeneral topographical features substantially as described in the book.\r\nIn 1852 it was ten years since Hawthorne had lived there, and though he\r\nmight have renewed his acquaintance with it while the writing was\r\ngoing on, there is no record of his having done so; and considering the\r\nunfavorable weather, and the fact that the imaginative atmosphere which\r\nwriters seek is enhanced by distance in time, just as the physical\r\neffect of a landscape is improved by distance of space, makes it\r\nimprobable that he availed himself of the opportunity. His note-books\r\ncontain but few comments upon the routine of life of the community; his\r\nletters to his wife (then Sophia Peabody) are somewhat fuller; one can\r\ntrace several of these passages, artistically metamorphosed, in the\r\nromance. The episode of the masquerade picnic is based on fact, and the\r\nscene of the recovery of Zenobia's body from the river is a tolerably\r\nclose reproduction of an event in Concord, in which, several years\r\nbefore, Hawthorne had been an actor.\r\n\r\nThe portrayal in the story of city life from the back windows of the\r\nhotel, is derived from notes made just before we went to Lenox; there\r\nare the enigmatic drawing-room windows, the kitchen, the stable, the\r\nspectral cat, and the emblematic dove; the rain-storm; the glimpse\r\nof the woman sewing in one of the windows. There is also a passage\r\ncontaining a sketch of the personage who served as the groundwork for\r\nOld Moody. \"An elderly ragamuffin, in a dingy and battered hat, an old\r\nsurtout, and a more than shabby general aspect; a thin face and a red\r\nnose, a patch over one eye, and the other half drowned in moisture. He\r\nleans in a slightly stooping posture on a stick, forlorn and silent,\r\naddressing nobody but fixing his one moist eye on you with a certain\r\nintentness. He is a man who has been in decent circumstances at some\r\nformer period of his life, but, falling into decay, he now haunts about\r\nthe place, as a ghost haunts the spot where he was murdered. The word\r\nragamuffin,\" he adds, with characteristic determination to be exact,\r\n\"does not accurately express the man, because there is a sort of shadow\r\nor delusion of respectability about him, and a sobriety, too, and a kind\r\nof dignity in his groggy and red-nosed destitution.\" Out of this subtle\r\ncorrection of his own description arose the conception of making Old\r\nMoody the later state of the once wealthy and magnificent Fauntleroy.\r\nBut one of the most striking and imaginative touches in the passage,\r\nlikening the old waif to a ghost haunting the spot (Parker's liquor-bar)\r\nwhere he was murdered, is omitted in the book, because, striking though\r\nit was, it was a little too strong to be in keeping with the rest of the\r\nfictitious portrait. How many writers, having hit upon such a simile,\r\nwould have had conscience and self-denial enough, not to mention fine\r\nenough artistic sense, to delete it!\r\n\r\nThe craftsman's workmanship may occasionally be traced in this way; but,\r\nas a rule, it is difficult to catch a glimpse of him in his creative\r\nmoments. If he made rough draughts of his stories, he must have\r\ndestroyed them after the stories themselves were completed; for none\r\nsuch, in the case of his finished products, was left. I have seen\r\nthe manuscripts of all his tales except The Scarlet Letter, which was\r\ndestroyed by James T. Fields's printers--Fields having at that time\r\nno notion of the fame the romance was to achieve, or of the value that\r\nwould attach to every scrap of Hawthorne's writing. All the extant\r\nmanuscripts are singularly free from erasures and interlineations; page\r\nafter page is clear as a page of print. He would seem to have taught\r\nhimself so thoroughly how to write that, by the time the series of his\r\nlonger romances began, he was able to say what he wished to say at a\r\nfirst attempt. He had the habit, undoubtedly, of planning out the work\r\nof each day on the day previous, generally while walking in solitude\r\neither out-of-doors or, if that were impracticable, up and down the\r\nfloor of his study. It was this habit which created the pathway along\r\nthe summit of the ridge of the hill at Wayside, in Concord; it was a\r\ndeeply trodden path, in the hard, root-inwoven soil, hardly nine inches\r\nwide and about two hundred and fifty yards in length. The monotonous\r\nmovement of walking seemed to put his mind in the receptive state\r\nfavorable for hearing the voices of imagination. The external faculties\r\nwere quiescent, the veil of matter was lifted, and he was able to peruse\r\nthe vision beyond.\r\n\r\n[MAGE: JAMES T. FIELDS]\r\n\r\nBut there is an important exception to this rule to be noted in the\r\nmatter of his fictitious narratives which were posthumously published.\r\nThese, as I have elsewhere said, are all concerned with a single\r\ntheme--the never-dying man. There are two complete versions of\r\nSeptimius, of about equal length, and many passages in the two are\r\nidentical. There is a short sketch on somewhat different lines, called\r\n(by the editor) The Bloody Footstep; and there is still another, and\r\na much more elaborate attempt to embody the idea in the volume which\r\nI have entitled Doctor Grimshawe's Secret. All these, in short, are\r\nstudies of one subject, and they were all unsatisfactory to the author.\r\nThe true vein of which he had been in search was finally discovered in\r\nThe Dolliver Romance, but the author's death prevented its completion.\r\n\r\nIn this series of posthumous manuscripts there is a unique opportunity\r\nfor making a study of the esoteric qualities of my father's style and\r\nmethods, and on a future occasion I hope to present the result of my\r\ninvestigations in this direction. There is, furthermore, in connection\r\nwith them, a mass of material of a yet more interesting and interior\r\ncharacter. While writing the Grimshawe, he was deeply perplexed by\r\ncertain details of the plot; the meaning of the Pensioner, and his\r\nproper function in the story, was one of these stumbling-blocks. But\r\nthe prosperity of the tale depended directly upon the solution of this\r\nproblem. Constantly, therefore, in the midst of the composition, he\r\nwould break off and enter upon a wrestling-match with the difficulty.\r\nThese wrestling-matches are of an absorbing significance; they reveal to\r\nus the very inmost movements of the author's mind. He tries, and\r\ntries again, to get at the idea that continues to elude him; he forms\r\ninnumerable hypotheses; he sets forth on the widest excursions; he gets\r\nout of patience with himself and with his Pensioner, and often damns\r\nthe latter in good set terms; but he will not give up the struggle; his\r\nresolve to conquer is adamantine, and the conflict is always renewed.\r\nAnd there it all stands in black and white; one of the most instructive\r\nchapters in literary criticism in the world--the battle of a great\r\nwriter with himself. The final issue, after all, was hardly decisive,\r\nfor although a tolerable modus vivendi was reached and a truce declared,\r\nit is evident that Hawthorne regarded the entire scheme of the story as\r\na mistake, and it is concluded in a perfunctory and indifferent manner.\r\n\r\nBut it may be doubted whether anything of this sort ever took place\r\nin the making of any of the other stories. These depend but in a\r\nsubordinate degree upon what is called technically plot interest. The\r\nauthor's method was to take a natural, even a familiar incident, and\r\nto transmute it into immortal gold by simply elucidating its inner\r\nspiritual significance. The Scarlet Letter is a mere plain story of love\r\nand jealousy; there is no serious attempt to hide the identity of Roger\r\nChillingworth or the guilt of the minister. The only surprise in The\r\nHouse of the Seven Gables consists in the revelation of the fact that\r\nMaule reappears after several generations in the person of his modern\r\ndescendant. The structure of The Blithedale Romance appears more\r\ncomplicated; but that is mainly because, in a masterly manner, the\r\nauthor keeps the structural lines out of sight and concentrates\r\nattention upon the interplay of character. The scaffolding upon which\r\nare hung the splendid draperies of The Marble Faun is, again, of the\r\nsimplest formation, though the nature of the materials is unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nThis is a digression; the present volume, as I have already stated,\r\nis not designed to include--except incidentally-anything in the way of\r\nliterary criticism.\r\n\r\nBlithedale having been finished and published, the question of where to\r\nsettle down permanently once more came up for an answer. Of course, our\r\nsojourn at Mr. Mann's house had been a temporary expedient only; and for\r\nthat matter, the Manns, following the example of most Americans before\r\nand since, had rented the place merely as a stepping-stone to something\r\nelse. My father's eyes again turned with longing towards the sea-shore;\r\nbut the fitting nook for him there still failed to offer itself. People\r\nare naturally disposed to return to places in which they have formerly\r\nlived, and Concord could not but suggest itself to one who had passed\r\nsome of the happiest years of his life among its serene pastures and\r\npiney forests. This suggestion, moreover, was supplemented by the\r\nurgent invitations of his old friends there, and Mr. Emerson, who was a\r\npractical man as well as a philosopher, substantiated his arguments by\r\nthrowing into the scale a concrete dwelling. It was an edifice which\r\nnot even the most imaginative and optimistic of house-agents would have\r\nfound it easy to picture as a sumptuous country-seat; it was just four\r\nwooden walls and a roof, and they had been standing for a hundred years\r\nat least. The occupants of this house had seen the British march past\r\nfrom Boston on the 19th of April, 1775, and a few hours later they had\r\nseen them return along the same dusty highway at a greatly accelerated\r\npace and under annoying circumstances. There was a legend that a man had\r\nonce lived there who had announced that death was not an indispensable\r\ndetail of life, and that he for his part intended never to die; but\r\nafter many years he had grown weary of the monotony of his success, or\r\nhad realized that it would take too long a time to prove himself in\r\nthe right, and rather than see the thing through he allowed himself to\r\ndepart. The old structure, in its original state, consisted of a big,\r\nbrick chimney surrounded by four rooms and an attic, with a kitchen\r\ntacked on at the rear. It stood almost flush with the side-path along\r\nthe highway; behind it rose a steep hill-side to a height of about one\r\nhundred feet; in front, on the other side of the road, stretched broad\r\nmeadows with a brook flowing through the midst of them. Such conditions\r\nwould not seem altogether to favor a man wedded to seclusion.\r\n\r\nBut the thing was not at this juncture quite so bad as it had been. Mr.\r\nAlcott, whose unselfish devotion to the welfare of the human race made\r\nit incumbent upon his friends to supply him with the means of earthly\r\nsubsistence, had been recently domiciled in the house by Mr. Emerson\r\n(how the latter came into possession of it I have forgotten, if ever\r\nI knew), and he had at once proceeded to wreak upon it his unique\r\narchitectural talent. At any rate, either he himself or somebody in his\r\nbehalf had set up a small gable in the midst of the front, thrown out a\r\ndouble bow-window, and added a room on the west side. This interrupted\r\nthe deadly, four-square uniformity, and suggested further improvements.\r\nMr. Alcott certainly built the summer-house on the hill-side, and\r\nterraced the hill, which was also planted with apple-trees. Another\r\nsummer-house arose in the meadow opposite, which went with the property,\r\nand rustic fences separated the domain from the road. The dwelling was\r\nnow fully as commodious as the red house at Lenox, though it had no\r\nMonument Mountain and Stockbridge Bowl to look out upon.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: THE WAYSIDE (Showing Nathaniel Hawthorne and his wife)]\r\n\r\nThe estate, comprising, I think, forty-two acres, all told, including\r\nupward of twenty acres of second-growth woodland above the hill,\r\nperfectly useless except for kindling-wood and for the sea-music which\r\nthe pine-trees made, was offered to my father at a reasonable enough\r\nfigure, to be his own and his heirs' forever. He came over and looked\r\nat the place, thought \"The Wayside\" would be a good name for it, and\r\nwas perhaps helped to decide upon taking it by the felicity of this\r\nappellation. It was close upon the highway, undeniably; but then the\r\nhighway was so little travelled that it might almost as well not have\r\nbeen there. One might, also, plant a high hedge in place of the fence\r\nand make shift to hide behind it. One could enlarge the house as need\r\ndemanded; an affluent vegetable garden could be laid out in the meadow,\r\nand fruit and ornamental trees could be added to the slopes of the\r\nhill-side. The village was removed to a distance of a trifle over a\r\nmile, so that the roar of its traffic would not invade this retreat; and\r\nMr. Emerson sat radiating peace and wisdom between the village and\r\n\"The Wayside\"; while Mr. Alcott shone with ancillary lustre only a\r\nstone's-throw away. Thoreau and Ellery Channing were tramping about\r\nin the neighborhood, and Judge Hoar and his beautiful sister dispensed\r\nsweetness and light in the village itself. Walden Pond, still secluded\r\nas when only the Indians had seen the sky and the trees reflected in\r\nit, was within a two-mile walk, and the silent Musketaquid stole on its\r\nlevel way beyond the hill on the other side. Surely, a man might travel\r\nfar and not find a spot better suited for work and meditation and\r\ndiscreet society than Concord was.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, the necessity of settling down somewhere was a main\r\nconsideration. Concord, was inviting in itself, but it was also\r\nrecommended by the argument of exclusion; no other place so desirable\r\nand at the same time so easy of attainment happened to present itself.\r\nIt did not lie within sound and sight of the ocean; but that was the\r\nworst that could be urged against it. A man must choose, and Concord\r\nwas, finally, Hawthorne's choice.\r\n\r\nAt this epoch he had not contemplated, save in day-dreams, the\r\npossibility of visiting the Old World. His friend, Franklin Pierce, had\r\njust become President-elect, but that fact had not suggested to his mind\r\nthe change in his own fortunes which it was destined to bring about.\r\nHe was too modest a critic of his own abilities to think that his work\r\nwould ever bring him money enough for foreign travel, and, therefore,\r\nin accepting Concord as his home, he believed that he was fixing the\r\nboundaries of his future earthly experience. It was not his ideal;\r\nno imaginative man can ever hope to find that; but as soon as we have\r\ncalled a place our Home, it acquires a charm that has nothing to do with\r\nmaterial conditions. The best-known song in American poesy has impressed\r\nthat truth upon Americans--who are the most homeless people in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n     A transfigured cattle-pen--Emerson the hub of Concord--His\r\n     incorrigible modesty--Grocery-store sages--To make common\r\n     men feel more like Emerson than he did--His personal\r\n     appearance--His favorite gesture--A glance like the reveille\r\n     of a trumpet--The creaking boots--\"The muses are in the\r\n     woods\"--Emerson could not read Hawthorne--Typical versus\r\n     individual--Benefit from child-prattle--Concord-grape Bull--\r\n     Sounds of distant battle--Politics, sociology, and grape-\r\n     culture--The great white fence--Richard Henry Stoddard--A\r\n     country youth of genius--Whipple's Attic salt--An unwritten\r\n     romance--The consulship retires literature--Louisa's\r\n     tragedy--Hard hit--The spiritual sphere of good men--Nearer\r\n     than in the world--The return of the pilgrim.\r\n\r\nMy father's first look at \"The Wayside\" had been while snow was still\r\non the ground, and he had reported to his wife that it resembled a\r\ncattle-pen.\r\n\r\nBut the family advent was effected in June, and although a heavy rain\r\nhad fallen while the domestic impedimenta were in transit, wetting the\r\nmattresses and other exposed furniture, yet when the summer sun came out\r\nthings began to mend. My mother and Una came a day ahead of the others,\r\nand with the help of carpenters and upholsterers, and a neighboring\r\nIrishman and his wife for cleaning and moving purposes, they soon got\r\nhuman order into the place of savage chaos. The new carpet was down in\r\nthe study, the walls had been already papered and the wood-work grained,\r\nthe pictures were hung in their places, and the books placed on their\r\nshelves. By the time the father, the boy, the baby, and the nurse drove\r\nup in the hot afternoon a home had been created for their reception.\r\n\r\nMr. Emerson was, and he always remained, the hub round which the wheel\r\nof Concord's fortunes slowly and contentedly revolved. He was at\r\nthis time between forty-five and fifty years old, in the prime of\r\nhis beneficent powers. He had fulfilled the promise of his unique\r\nyouth--obeyed the voice at eve, obeyed at prime. The sweet austerity of\r\nhis nature had been mellowed by human sorrows--the loss of his brothers\r\nand of his eldest son; he had the breadth and poise that are given by\r\nknowledge of foreign lands, and friendships with the best men in them;\r\nhe had the unstained and indomitable independence of a man who has\r\nalways avowed his belief, and never failed to be true to each occasion\r\nfor truth; he had the tranquillity of faith and insight, and he was\r\nalert with that immortal curiosity for noble knowledge the fruit of\r\nwhich enriches his writings. Upon his modestly deprecating brows was\r\nalready set the wreath of a world-wide fame, and yet every village\r\nfarmer and store-keeper, and every child, found in his conversation the\r\nwisdom and companionship suited to his needs, and was made to feel\r\nthat his own companionship was a valued gift. Emerson becomes more\r\nextraordinary the further we get away from him in years; illustrating\r\nthe truth which Landor puts into the mouth of Barrow in one of his\r\nImaginary Conversations, that \"No very great man ever reached the\r\nstandard of his greatness in the crowd of his contemporaries: this hath\r\nalways been reserved for the secondary.\" The wealth contained in his\r\nessays has only begun to be put in general circulation, and the harvest\r\nof his poetry is still more remote; while the sincere humility of the\r\nman himself, who was the best incarnate example of many of his ideals,\r\nstill puzzles those critics who believe every one must needs be inferior\r\nto his professions.\r\n\r\n\"Though I am fond of writing and of public speaking,\" said Emerson, \"I\r\nam a very poor talker, and for the most part prefer silence\"; and he\r\nwent on to compare himself in this respect with Alcott, \"the prince of\r\nconversers.\" Alcott was undoubtedly the prince of fluency, and\r\nEmerson rarely, in private dialogue, ventured to string together many\r\nconsecutive sentences; but the things he did say, on small occasion or\r\ngreat, always hit the gold. On being appealed to, or when his turn came,\r\nhe would hang a moment in the wind, and then pay off before the\r\nbreeze of thought with an accuracy and force that gave delight with\r\nenlightenment. The form was often epigrammatic, but the air with which\r\nit was said beautifully disclaimed any epigrammatic consciousness or\r\nintention. It was, rather, \"I am little qualified to speak adequately,\r\nbut this, at least, does seem to me to be true.\" In the end, therefore,\r\nas the interlocutor thought it all over, he was perhaps surprised to\r\ndiscover that, little in quantity as Emerson may have said during the\r\ntalk, he had yet said more than any one else in substance. But it may be\r\nadmitted that he was even better in listening than in speech; his\r\nlook, averted but attentive, with a smile which seemed to postpone full\r\ndevelopment to the moment when his companion should have uttered the\r\nexpected apple of gold in the picture of silver, was subtly stimulating\r\nto the latter's intellect, and prompted him to outdo himself. His\r\nquestions were often revelations, discovering truth which the other\r\nonly then perceived, and thus beguiling him into admiration of his own\r\nsupposed intelligence. In this, as in other things, he acted upon the\r\nprecept that it is more blessed to give than to receive gratification;\r\nhe never seemed to need any other happiness than that of imparting it.\r\nAnd so selflessly and insensibly were the riches of his mind and nature\r\ncommunicated to the community that innocent little Concord could not\r\nquite help believing that its wealth and renown were somehow a creation\r\nof its own. The loafers in Walcott & Holden's grocery store were, in\r\ntheir own estimation, of heroic stature, because of the unegoistic\r\ncitizen who dwelt over yonder among the pines. Emerson was a great man,\r\nno doubt; but then he was no more than their own confessed equal, or\r\ninferior!\r\n\r\nThis will and power to secularize himself is perhaps Emerson's unique\r\nattribute. It is comparatively easy to stand on mountain-tops and to\r\nride Pegasus; but how many of those competent to such feats could at the\r\nsame time sit cheek by jowl with hucksters and teamsters without a trace\r\nof condescension, and while rubbing shoulders with the rabble of the\r\nstreet in town-meeting, speak without arrogance the illuminating and\r\ndeciding word? This, at last, is the true democracy that levels up\r\ninstead of down. An Emerson who can make common men feel more like\r\nEmerson than he himself did is the kind of man we need to bring America\r\nup to her ideals.\r\n\r\nEmerson was ungainly in build, with narrow, sloping shoulders, large\r\nfeet and hands, and a projecting carriage of the head, which enhanced\r\nthe eagle-like expression of his glance and features. His head was\r\nsmall; it was covered (in 1852) with light brown hair, fine and\r\nstraight; he was cleanshaven save for a short whisker; the peaked ends\r\nof an uncomfortable collar appeared above the folds of a high, black\r\nsilk stock. His long-skirted black coat was commonly buttoned up; he\r\nwore, on different occasions, a soft felt hat or a high silk one, the\r\nlatter, from use, having become in a manner humanized. On the street he\r\nkept his face up as he walked along, and perceived the approach of an\r\nacquaintance afar off, and the wise, slow smile gleamed about his mouth\r\nas he drew near. \"How do you do?\" was sometimes his greeting; but more\r\noften, \"Good-bye!\" or \"Good-night!\"--an original and more sensible\r\ngreeting. Though ungainly in formation, he was not ungraceful in bearing\r\nand action; there was a fitness and harmony in his manifestations\r\neven on the physical plan. On the lecture platform he stood erect and\r\nunadorned, his hands hanging folded in front, save when he changed the\r\nleaf of his manuscript, or emphasized his words with a gesture: his\r\ncustomary one, simple but effective, was to clinch his right fist,\r\nknuckles upward, the arm bent at the elbow, then a downward blow of the\r\nforearm, full of power bridled. It was accompanied by such a glance\r\nof the eyes as no one ever saw except from Emerson: a glance like the\r\nreveille of a trumpet. Yet his eyes were not noticeably large, and their\r\ncolor was greenish-gray; but they were well set and outlined in his\r\nhead, and, more than is the case with most men, they were the windows\r\nof his soul. Wendell Phillips had an eloquent and intrepid eye, but it\r\npossessed nothing approaching the eloquence and spiritual influence of\r\nEmerson's. In every Lyceum course in Concord, Emerson lectured once or\r\ntwice, and the hall was always filled. One night he had the misfortune\r\nto wear a pair of abominably creaking boots; every slightest change of\r\nposture would be followed by an outcry from the sole-leather, and\r\nthe audience soon became nervously preoccupied in expecting them. The\r\nsublimest thoughts were mingled with these base material accompaniments.\r\nBut there was nothing to be done, unless the lecturer would finish his\r\nlecture in his stocking-feet, and we were fain to derive a fortuitous\r\ninspiration from observing the unfaltering meekness with which our\r\nphilosopher accepted the predicament. I have forgotten the subject of\r\nthe lecture on that occasion, but the voice of the boots will always\r\nsound in my memory.\r\n\r\nIn his own house Emerson shone with essential hospitality, and yet he\r\nwonderfully effaced himself; any one but he might hold the centre of\r\nthe stage. You felt him everywhere, but if you would see him, you must\r\nsearch the wings. He sat in his chair, bending forward, one leg crossed\r\nover the other, his elbows often supported on his knee; his legs were\r\nrather long and slender, and he had a way, after crossing his leg, of\r\nhitching the instep of that foot under the calf of the other leg, so\r\nthat he seemed braided up. He seldom stood in a room, or paced to and\r\nfro, as my father was fond of doing. But the two men were almost equally\r\naddicted to outdoor walking, and both preferred to walk alone. Emerson\r\nformed the habit of betaking himself to Walden woods, which extended to\r\nwithin a mile or so of his door; thence would he return with an exalted\r\nlook, saying, \"The muses are in the woods to-day\"; and no one who has\r\nread his Woodnotes can doubt that he found them there. Occasionally\r\nChanning, Thoreau, or my father would be his companion; Alcott preferred\r\nto busy himself about his rustic fences and summer-houses, or to sit\r\nthe centre of a circle and converse, as he called it; meaning to\r\nsoliloquize, looking round from face to face with unalterable faith and\r\ncomplacency.\r\n\r\nMy father read Emerson with enjoyment; though more and more, as he\r\nadvanced in life, he was disposed to question the expediency of stating\r\ntruth in a disembodied form; he preferred it incarnate, as it appears in\r\nlife and in story. But he could not talk to Emerson; his pleasure in his\r\nsociety did not express itself in that form. Emerson, on the other hand,\r\nassiduously cultivated my father's company, and, contrary to his general\r\nhabit, talked to him continuously; but he could not read his romances;\r\nhe admitted that he had never been able to finish one of them. He loved\r\nto observe him; to watch his silence, which was full of a kind of speech\r\nwhich he was able to appreciate; \"Hawthorne rides well his horse of the\r\nnight!\" My father was Gothic; Emerson was Roman and Greek. But each was\r\nprofoundly original and independent. My father was the shyer and more\r\nsolitary of the two, and yet persons in need of human sympathy were able\r\nto reach a more interior region in him than they could in Emerson. For\r\nthe latter's thought was concerned with types and classes, while the\r\nformer had the individual touch. He distrusted rules, but had faith\r\nin exceptions and idiosyncrasies. Emerson was nobly and magnanimously\r\npublic; my father, exquisitely and inevitably private; together they met\r\nthe needs of nearly all that is worthy in human nature.\r\n\r\nEmerson rose upon us frequently during our early struggles with our\r\nnew abode, like a milder sun; the children of the two families became\r\nacquainted, the surviving son, Edward, two years my elder, falling to\r\nmy share. But Emerson himself also became my companion, with a humanity\r\nwhich to-day fills me with grateful wonder. I remember once being taken\r\nby him on a long walk through the sacred pine woods, and on another\r\noccasion he laid aside the poem or the essay he was writing to entertain\r\nUna in his study, whither she had gone alone and of her own initiative\r\nto make him a call! It is easy to compliment a friend upon his children,\r\nbut how many of us will allow themselves to be caught and utilized by\r\nthem in this fashion? But Emerson's mind was so catholic, so humble, and\r\nso deep that I doubt not he derived benefit even from child-prattle. His\r\nwife rivalled him in hospitality, though her frail health disabled her\r\nfrom entering into the physical part of social functions with the same\r\nfortitude; in these first months we were invited to a party where we\r\nwere fellow-guests with all the other children of Concord. There they\r\nwere, their mothers with them, and everything in sight that a child at\r\na party could require. My new friend Edward mounted me on his pony, and\r\nhis father was at hand to catch me when I fell off. Such things sound\r\nincredible, but they are true. A great man is great at all times, and\r\nall over.\r\n\r\nThoreau, Channing, and Alcott were also visible to us at this time, but\r\nof none of them do I find any trace in my memory; though I know, as\r\na matter of fact, that Channing and my father once permitted me to\r\naccompany them on a walk round the country roads, which inadvertently\r\nprolonged itself to ten miles, and I knew what it was to feel\r\nfoot-weary. But another neighbor of ours, hardly less known to fame,\r\nthough in a widely different line of usefulness, makes a very distinct\r\npicture in my mind; this was Ephraim Wales Bull, the inventor of the\r\nConcord grape. He was as eccentric as his name; but he was a genuine\r\nand substantive man, and my father took a great liking to him, which was\r\nreciprocated. He was short and powerful, with long arms, and a big head\r\ncovered with bushy hair and a jungle beard, from which looked out a pair\r\nof eyes singularly brilliant and penetrating. He had brains to think\r\nwith, as well as strong and skilful hands to work with; he personally\r\ndid three-fourths of the labor on his vineyard, and every grape-vine had\r\nhis separate care. He was married and had three children, amiable\r\nbut less interesting than himself. He had, also, a tremendous temper,\r\nevidenced by his heavy and high-arched eyebrows, and once in a while he\r\nlet slip upon his helpers in the vineyard this formidable wrath, which\r\ncould easily be heard in our peaceful precincts, like sounds of distant\r\nbattle. He often came over and sat with my father in the summer-house on\r\nthe hill, and there talked about politics, sociology (though under some\r\nother name, probably), morals, and human nature, with an occasional\r\nlecture on grape-culture. He permitted my sister and me to climb the\r\nfence and eat all the grapes we could hold; it seems to me he could\r\nhardly have realized our capacity. During our second summer he built a\r\nmost elaborate fence along the road-front of his estate; it must have\r\nbeen three hundred yards long and it was as high as a man could reach;\r\nthe palings, instead of being upright, were criss-crossed over one\r\nanother, leaving small diamond-shaped interstices. The whole was painted\r\nbrilliant white, to match the liliputian cottage in which the Bull\r\nfamily contrived (I know not how) to ensconce itself. When the fence was\r\nbuilt, Mr. Bull would every day come forth and pace slowly up and down\r\nthe road, contemplating it with the pride of a parent; indeed, it was no\r\npuny achievement, and when I revisited Concord, thirty years later,\r\nthe great white fence was still there, with a few gaps in it, but still\r\neffective. But the builder, and the grapes--where were they? Where are\r\nCheops, and the hanging gardens of Babylon?\r\n\r\nAmong many visitors came Richard Henry Stoddard, already a poet, but\r\nanxious to supplement the income from his verses by a regular stipend\r\nfrom the big pocket of Uncle Sam. His first coming was in summer, and\r\nhe and my father went up on the hill and sat in the summer-house there,\r\nlooking out upon the wide prospect of green meadows and distant woods,\r\nbut probably seeing nothing of them, their attention being withdrawn to\r\nscenes yet fairer in the land of imagination and memory. Stoddard was\r\nthen, as always, a handsome man, strong and stanch, black-haired and\r\nblack-bearded, with strong eyes that could look both fierce and tender.\r\nHe was masculine, sensitive, frank, and humorous; his chuckle had\r\ninfinite merriment in it; but, as his mood shifted, there might be\r\ntears in his eyes the next moment. He was at that time little more\r\nthan five-and-twenty years old, and he looked hardly that; he was a New\r\nEngland country youth of genius. Nature had kindled a fire in him which\r\nhas never gone out. Like my father, he was affiliated with the sea, and\r\nhad its freshness and daring, though combined with great modesty, and he\r\nfelt honored by the affection with which he inspired the author of The\r\nScarlet Letter. It was not until his second visit, in the winter,\r\nthat the subject of a custom-house appointment for him came up; for my\r\nfather, being known as a close friend of the President, whose biography\r\nhe had written for the campaign, became the object of pilgrimages other\r\nthan literary ones. He received sound advice, and introductions, which\r\naided him in getting the appointment, and he held it for nearly twenty\r\nyears--more to the benefit of the custom-house than of poetry, no\r\ndoubt, though he never let poetry escape him, and he is to-day a mine\r\nof knowledge and wisdom on literary subjects. There is an immense human\r\nardor, power, and pathos in Stoddard; better than any other American\r\npoet does he realize the conception of his great English brother--the\r\nlove of love, the hate of hate, the scorn of scorn. The world has proved\r\nimpotent to corrupt his heroic simplicity; he loved fame much, but truth\r\nmore. He is a boy in his heart still, and he has sung songs which touch\r\nwhatever is sweetest, tenderest, and manliest in the soul of man.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: EDWIN P. WHIFFLE]\r\n\r\nE. P. Whipple, essentially a man of letters, and famous in his day as a\r\ncritic of literature, appeared often in \"The Wayside.\" His verdict on a\r\nbook carried weight; it was an era when literary criticism was regarded\r\nseriously, and volumes devoted to critical studies had something more\r\nthan, a perfunctory vogue. He had written penetrating and cordial things\r\nabout my father's books, and foretold the high place which he would\r\nultimately occupy in our Pantheon. He was rich in the kind of Attic salt\r\nwhich, was characteristic of Boston in the middle century; the product\r\nof an almost excessive culture erected on sound, native brains. He had\r\nabounding wit; not only wit of the sort that begets mirth, but that\r\nlarger and graver wit which Macaulay notices in Bacon's writings--a\r\npure, irradiating, intellectual light. It had often the effect of an\r\nactual physical illumination cast upon the topic. He was magnificent as\r\na dinner-table companion. He was rather a short, thick-shouldered man,\r\nwith a big head on a short neck, a broad, projecting forehead, prominent\r\neyes, defended by shiny spectacles, and bushy whiskers. He is not\r\nremembered now, probably because he never produced any organic work\r\ncommensurate with his huge talent. Analyses of the work of others,\r\nhowever just, useful, and creative, do not endure unless they are\r\nassociated with writing of the independent sort. Whipple, with all his\r\nability and insight, never entered the imaginative field on his own\r\naccount, and in the press of wits he falls behind and is forgotten.\r\n\r\nMy father had come to Concord with the idea of a new romance in his\r\nmind; he designed it to be of a character more cheerful than the\r\nforegoing ones. It was never written, and but the slightest traces of\r\nwhat it might have been are extant. Herman Melville had spent a day\r\nwith us at Concord, and he had suggested a story to Hawthorne; but the\r\nlatter, after turning it over in his mind, came to the conclusion that\r\nMelville could treat the subject better than he could; but Melville\r\nfinally relinquished it also. It seems likely, however, that this\r\nprojected tale was not the one which Hawthorne had originally been\r\nmeditating. At all events, it was postponed in favor of a new book of\r\nwonder-stories from Greek mythology--the first one having had immediate\r\npopularity, and by the time this was finished, the occasion had arrived\r\nwhich led to the writing of Pierce's biography. This, in turn, was\r\nfollowed by the offer by the President to his friend of the Liverpool\r\nconsulate, then the most lucrative appointment in the gift of the\r\nadministration; and Hawthorne's acceptance of it caused all literary\r\nprojects to be indefinitely abandoned.\r\n\r\nBut even had there been time for the writing of another book, the death\r\nof Hawthorne's sister Louisa would doubtless have unfitted him for a\r\nwhile from undertaking it. This was the most painful episode connected\r\nwith his life; Louisa was a passenger on a Hudson River steamboat which\r\nwas burned. She was a gentle, rather fragile woman, with a playful humor\r\nand a lovable nature; she had not the intellectual force either of her\r\nbrother or of her sister Elizabeth; but her social inclinations were\r\nstronger than theirs. She was a delightful person to have in the house,\r\nand her nephew and niece were ardently in love with her. She was on her\r\nway to \"The Wayside\" when the calamity occurred, and we were actually\r\nexpecting her on the day she perished. Standing on the blazing deck,\r\nwith the panic and the death-scenes around her, the gentle woman had to\r\nmake the terrible choice between the river and the fire. She was alone;\r\nthere was none to advise or help her or be her companion in inevitable\r\ndeath. Her thoughts must have gone to her brother, with his strength and\r\ncourage, his skill as a swimmer; but he was far away, unconscious of her\r\ndesperate extremity. She had to choose, and the river was her choice.\r\nWith that tragic conception of the drowning of Zenobia fresh in his\r\nmind, the realization of his sister's fate must have gained additional\r\npoignancy in my father's imagination. He was hard hit, and the traces of\r\nthe blow were manifest on him. After about a month, he made a journey to\r\nthe Isles of Shoals with Franklin Pierce, and in that breezy outpost\r\nof the land he spent some weeks, much to his advantage. This was in the\r\nautumn of 1852, and I recall well enough the gap in things which his\r\nlong absence made for me, and my perfect joy when the whistle of the\r\ntrain at the distant railway station signalled his return. Twenty\r\nminutes had to elapse before the railroad carriage could bring him\r\nto our door; they were long and they were brief, after the manner\r\nof minutes in such circumstances. He came, and there was a moment of\r\nindescribable glory while he leaped from the carriage and faced the\r\nsituation on the doorstep of his home. His countenance was glowing with\r\nhealth and the happiness of home-coming. I thought him, as I always did,\r\nthe most beautiful of human beings, by which I do not mean beautiful\r\nin feature, for of that I was not competent to hold an opinion; but\r\nbeautiful in the feelings which he aroused in me beholding him. He was\r\nbeautiful to be with, to hear, touch, and experience. Such is the effect\r\nof the spiritual sphere of good men, in whom nature and character\r\nare harmonious. My father got his appointment from Washington in the\r\nfollowing March, 1853. His wife had but one solicitude in leaving\r\nAmerica; her mother was aged and in delicate health, and their parting\r\nmight be forever in this world. But a month before the appointment was\r\nconfirmed, her mother quietly and painlessly died. It was as if she had\r\nwished not to be separated from her beloved daughter, and had entered\r\ninto the spiritual state in the expectation of being nearer to her there\r\nthan she could be in the world. My mother always affirmed that she\r\nwas conscious of her mother's presence with her on momentous occasions\r\nduring the remainder of her own life.\r\n\r\nJune came; the farewells were said, we were railroaded to Boston,\r\nembarked on the Cunard steamship Niagara, Captain Leitch, and steamed\r\nout of Boston Harbor on a day of cloudlessness and calm. Incoming\r\nvessels, drifting in the smoothness, saluted us with their flags, and\r\nthe idle seamen stared at us, leaning over their bulwarks. The last\r\nof the low headlands grew dim and vanished in the golden haze of the\r\nafternoon. \"Go away, tiresome old land!\" sang out my sister and myself;\r\nbut my father, standing beside us, gazing westward with a serious look,\r\nbade us be silent. Two hundred and twenty years had passed since our\r\nfirst ancestor had sought freedom on those disappearing shores, and our\r\nfather was the first of his descendants to visit the Old Home whence he\r\ncame. What was to be the outcome? But the children only felt that the\r\nocean was pleasant and strange, and they longed to explore it.

But, with the exception of the red smoke-stack\r\nwith the black ring round the top, there was little similarity between\r\nthe boat that took us to England and the mammoths that do that service\r\nfor travellers now adays. The Niagara was about two hundred and fifty\r\nfeet long, and was propelled by paddle-wheels, upon the summits of\r\nwhose curving altitudes we were permitted to climb in calm weather.\r\nThe interior decorations were neat and pretty, but had nothing of the\r\npalatial and aesthetic gorgeousness which educates us in these later\r\nages. The company of passengers was so small that a single cow, housed\r\nin a pen on deck, sufficed for their needs in the way of milk, and there\r\nwere still left alive and pecking contentedly about their coop a number\r\nof fowls, after we had eaten all we could of their brethren at the ten\r\ndinners that were served during the voyage. The crew, from the captain\r\ndown, were all able seamen, friendly and companionable, and not so\r\nnumerous but that it was easy to make their individual acquaintance. The\r\nmost engaging friend of the small people was the carpenter, who had his\r\nshop on deck, and from whom I acquired that passion for the profession\r\nwhich every normal boy ought to have, and from the practice of which I\r\nderived deep enjoyment and many bloody thumbs and fingers for ten years\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nBut we had companionship historically at least more edifying. William\r\nD. Ticknor, the senior partner of my father's publishers, was the only\r\nfigure familiar at the outset. He was one of the most amiable of men,\r\nwith thick whiskers all round his face and spectacles shining over\r\nhis kindly eyes; a sturdy, thick-set personage, active in movement and\r\ngenial in conversation. It was James T. Fields who usually made the\r\ntrips to England; but on this occasion Fields got no farther than\r\nthe wharf, where the last object visible was his comely and smiling\r\ncountenance as he waved his adieux. Conspicuous among the group on the\r\nafter-deck, as we glided out of the smooth harbor of Boston, was an\r\nurbane and dignified gentleman of perhaps sixty years of age, with a\r\nclean-shaven mouth and chin, finely moulded, and with what Tennyson\r\nwould call an educated whisker, short and gray, defining the region\r\nin front of and below his ears. He spoke deliberately, and in language\r\ncarefully and yet easily chosen, with intonations singularly distinct\r\nand agreeable, giving its full value to every word. This was our first\r\nnative Englishman; no less a personage than Mr. Crampton, in fact, the\r\nBritish Minister, who was on his way to Halifax. He had fine, calm,\r\nquietly observant eyes, which were pleasantly employed in contemplating\r\nthe beauty of that summer seascape--an opalescent ocean, and islands\r\nslumbering in the July haze. Near him stood a light-built, tall,\r\nathletic individual, also obviously English, but thirty years younger;\r\nfull, also, of artistic appreciation; this was Field Talfourd, who was\r\nan artist, and many things besides; a man proficient in all forms\r\nof culture. His features were high and refined, and, without being\r\nhandsome, irresistibly attractive. He turned out to be a delightful\r\nplaymate for the children, and astonished them and the rest of the\r\ncompany by surprising gymnastic feats in the rigging. The speech of\r\nthese two Britishers gave the untravelled American a new appreciation of\r\nthe beauty and significance of the English language. Not all Englishmen\r\nspeak good English, but when they do, they beggar eulogy.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: JAMES T. FIELDS, NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE, AND WILLIAM D. TICKNOR]\r\n\r\nGeorge Silsbee was likewise of our party; he was an American of the\r\nBrahman type, a child of Cambridge and Boston, a man of means, and an\r\nindefatigable traveller. He had the delicate health and physique of the\r\nAmerican student of those days, when out-door life and games made no\r\npart of our scholastic curricula. He may have been forty years old,\r\nslight and frail, with a thin, clean-shaven face and pallid complexion,\r\nbut full of mind and sensibility. We do not heed travellers now, and I\r\nam inclined to think they are less worth heeding than they used to be.\r\nIt is so easy to see the world in these latter days that few persons see\r\nit to any purpose even when they go through the motions of doing so. But\r\nto hear George Bradford or Silsbee talk of England, France, and Italy,\r\nin the fifties, was a liberal education, and I used sometimes to stare\r\nfascinated at the boots of these wayfarers, admiring them for the\r\nwondrous places in which they had trodden. Silsbee travelled with his\r\nartistic and historic consciousness all on board, and had so much to say\r\nthat he never was able to say it all.\r\n\r\nBut to my father himself were accorded the honors of the captain's\r\ntable, and for him were fired the salutes of cannon which thundered us\r\nout of Boston Harbor and into Halifax. These compliments, however, were\r\npaid to him not as a man of letters, but as a political representative\r\nof his country, and, let a man be as renowned as he will on his personal\r\naccount, he will still find it convenient, in order to secure smooth and\r\nagreeable conditions on his way through the world, to supplement that\r\ndistinction with recommendations from the State Department. Respect for\r\nrank is the last infirmity even of noble republican minds, and it oils\r\nthe wheels of the progress of those who possess it. An American widow\r\nof my later acquaintance, a lady of two marriageable daughters and small\r\nsocial pretensions in her own country, toured Europe with success\r\nand distinction, getting all the best accommodations and profoundest\r\nobeisances by the simple device of placing the word \"Lady\" before her\r\nmodest signature in the hotel registers. She was a lady, of course, and\r\nhad a right so to style herself, and if snobbish persons chose to read\r\ninto the word more than it literally meant, that was not Mrs. Green's\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nAmerican commerce still existed in 1853, and the Liverpool consulate was\r\nsupposed to have more money in it than any other office in the gift\r\nof the administration. As a matter of fact, several of my father's\r\npredecessors had retired from their tenure of office with something\r\nhandsome (pecuniarily speaking) to their credit; whether the means by\r\nwhich it had been acquired were as handsome is another question. Be\r\nthat as it may, Congress, soon after my father's accession, passed a\r\nlaw cutting down the profits about three-fourths, and he was obliged to\r\npractise the strictest economy during his residence abroad in order to\r\ncome home with a few thousand dollars in his pocket. Nevertheless, the\r\ndignity, in the official sense, of this consular post was considerable,\r\nand it brought him, in combination with his literary fame, a good deal\r\nmore attention in England than he well knew what to do with. But, in one\r\nway or another, he also made friends there who remained to the end among\r\nthe dearest of his life and more than countervailed all the time and\r\nenergy wasted on the Philistines.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic, all the way across, with the exception of one brief\r\nemotional disturbance between lunch and dinner-time, wore a smile of\r\nfatuous serenity. The sun shone; the vast pond-surface oilily undulated,\r\nor lay in absolute flatness, or at most defiled under our eyes in\r\nendless squadrons of low-riding crests. My mother, whose last experience\r\nof sea-ways had been the voyage to Cuba, in which the ship was all but\r\nlost in a series of hurricanes, was captivated by this soft behavior,\r\nand enjoyed the whole of it as much, almost, as her husband, who\r\nexpanded and drank in delight like a plant in the rain. But, in truth,\r\nthese must have been blessed hours for them both. Behind them lay nearly\r\neleven years of married life, spent in narrow outward circumstances,\r\nlightened only towards the last by the promise of some relaxation from\r\nstrain, during which they had found their happiness in each other, and\r\nin the wise and tender care of their children, and in the converse of\r\nchosen friends. They had filled their minds with knowledge concerning\r\nthe beauties and interests of foreign lands, with but a slender\r\nexpectation of ever beholding them with bodily sight, but none the less\r\nwell prepared to understand and appreciate them should the opportunity\r\narrive. And now, suddenly, it had arrived, and they were on the way to\r\nthe regions of their dreams, with the prospect of comparative affluence\r\nadded. They had nearly twelve years of earthly sojourn together before\r\nthem, the afternoon sunshine to be clouded a little near the close by\r\nthe husband's failing health, but glorified more and more by mutual\r\nlove, and enriched with memories of all that had before been unfulfilled\r\nimaginings. This voyage eastward was the space of contemplation between\r\nthe two periods, and the balm of its tranquillity well symbolized the\r\npeace of soul and mind with which they awaited what the horizons were to\r\ndisclose.\r\n\r\nThe right way to approach England for the first time is not by the\r\nwest coast, but by the south, as Julius Caesar did, beckoned on by the\r\nghostly, pallid cliffs that seem to lift themselves like battlements\r\nagainst the invader. It is historically open to question whether there\r\nwould have been any Roman occupation, or any Saxon or Norman one\r\neither, for that matter, but for the coquetry of those chalk cliffs.\r\nAn adventurer, sighting the low and marshy shores of Lancashire, and\r\nmuddying his prows in the yellow waters of the Mersey, would be apt\r\nto think that such a land were a good place to avoid. But the race of\r\nadventurers has long since died out, and their place is occupied by the\r\nwide-flying cormorants of commerce, to whom mud flats and rock deserts\r\npresent elysian beauties, provided only there be profit in them.\r\nOne kind of imagination has been superseded by another, and both are\r\nnecessary to the full exploitation of this remarkable globe that we\r\ninhabit.\r\n\r\nBut even the level capes of Lancashire were alluring to eyes that saw\r\nEngland, our venerable mother, loom behind them, with her thousand\r\nyears' pageantry of warfare and civilization. The egregious little\r\nisland is a thirsty place; the land drinks rain as assiduously as do its\r\ninhabitants beer and other liquors. Heavy mists and clouds enveloped it\r\nas we drew near, and ushered us up the Mersey into a brown omnipresence\r\nof rain. The broad, clear sunshine of the Atlantic was left behind, and\r\nwe stood on wet decks and were transported to sloppy wharfs by means\r\nof a rain-sodden and abominably smoking little tug-boat--as the way\r\nwas fifty years ago. Liverpool was a gray-stone labyrinth open to the\r\ndeluge, and its inhabitants went to and fro with umbrellas over their\r\nheads and black respirators over their mouths, looking as if such were\r\ntheir normal plight--as, indeed, it was. Much of this was not needed to\r\nquench the enthusiasm of the children. The Waterloo Hotel, to which, by\r\nadvice of friends, we were driven, seemed by its very name to carry out\r\nthe idea of saturation, which the activities of nature so insistently\r\nconveyed. It was intensely discomfortable, and though the inside of the\r\nhotel was well supplied with gloomy English comforts, and the solemn\r\nmeals were administered with a ceremonious gravity that suggested their\r\nbeing preliminaries to funerals, yet it was hard to be light-hearted.\r\nThe open-grate coal fires were the most welcome feature of this summer\r\nseason, and no doubt the wine list offered the best available substitute\r\nfor sunlight; but we had not been trained to avail ourselves of it.\r\nWe drank water, which certainly appeared an idle proceeding in such a\r\nclimate. In Liverpool, however, or in its suburbs, we were to live for\r\nthe better part of four years, and we must make the best of it. And\r\nthere is in English people, when rightly approached, a steady and\r\nsystematic geniality that not only makes handsome amends for their\r\nweather, but also accounts for the otherwise singular fact that the\r\ncountry is inhabited at all. A people with a smaller fund of interior\r\nwarmth could not have endured it. The French talk about conquering\r\nEngland, but they could not hold it if they did, and it is one of the\r\nstanding puzzles of history how the Romans, an Italian race, were able\r\nto maintain themselves under these skies during four centuries. It may\r\nbe objected that the present English population is not indigenous to the\r\nisland; but they are the survival of the fittest and toughest selected\r\nfrom many aspirants. Nor can it be doubted that the British hunger for\r\nempire in all parts of the world is due to nothing so much as to their\r\nanxiety to have a plausible pretext for living elsewhere than at home.\r\n\r\nMy father took the rain, as he took everything that could not be helped,\r\nphilosophically, and it seemed to do him no harm; indeed, his health\r\nwas uniformly good all through his English residence. It did not suit so\r\nwell my mother, who was constitutionally delicate in the lungs; she was\r\nsoon obliged to adopt the English respirator, and finally was driven\r\nto take refuge for the greater part of a year in Lisbon and Madeira,\r\nreturning only a little before the departure of the family for Italy in\r\n1858. But there must have been in him an ancestral power of resistance\r\nstill effective after more than two centuries of transplantation; he\r\ngrew ruddy and robust while facing the mist and mirk, and inhaling the\r\nsmoky moisture that did service for air. Nor was his health impaired by\r\nthe long hours in the daily consulate--a grimy little room barely five\r\npaces from end to end, with its dusty windows so hemmed in by taller\r\nbuildings that even had there been any sunshine to make the attempt, it\r\ncould never have succeeded in effecting an entrance through them. Here,\r\nfrom ten in the morning until four in the afternoon, he dealt with all\r\nvarieties of scamps and mendicants, fools and desperadoes, and all the\r\ntribe of piratical cutthroats which in those days constituted a large\r\npart of the merchant marine. Calamity, imbecility, and rascality were\r\nhis constant companions in that dingy little den; and the gloomy and\r\nsooty skies without but faintly pictured the moral atmosphere which\r\nthey exhaled; he entered deeply into all their affairs, projects, and\r\ncomplaints, feeling their troubles, probably, at least as keenly as\r\nthey did themselves, and yet he came out of it all with clear eyes and a\r\nsound digestion. I presume the fact may have been that he unconsciously\r\nregarded the whole affair somewhat as we do a drama in a theatre; it\r\nworks upon our sensibilities, and yet we do not believe that it is real.\r\nThere was nothing in the experience germane to his proper life; it could\r\nnot become a part of him, and therefore its posture towards him\r\nremained inveterately objective. The only feature of it that quickened a\r\nresponsive chord in him was the revelation of the intolerable condition\r\nof the sailors in many of our ships, and upon these abuses he enlarged\r\nin his communications to Washington. Improvements were made in\r\nconsequence of his remonstrances; but the American merchant service had\r\nalready begun its downward career, and it is only very lately, owing to\r\ncauses which are too novel and peculiar to be intelligently discussed\r\nas yet, that our flag is once more promising to compete against that of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIt would be misleading to say, however, that my father was not\r\ninterested in his consulate work; there was a practical side in him\r\nwhich took hold of the business in man-fashion, and transacted it so\r\nefficiently as to leave no room for criticism, and nobody can produce\r\nvoluntary effects without feeling in himself a reaction from them. He had\r\noccasion to look into the privacy of many human hearts, to pity them and\r\nadvise them, and from such services and insights he no doubt obtained a\r\nresidue of wisdom which might be applied to his own ulterior uses.\r\nThese were indirect and incidental issues; but from the consulate qua\r\nconsulate Hawthorne was radically alien, and when he quitted it, he\r\ncarried away with him no taint or trace of it. As he says in his remarks\r\nupon the subject, he soon came to doubt whether it were actually himself\r\nwho had been the incumbent of the office at all.\r\n\r\nBut Providence does not deny manna to man in his extremity, and to my\r\nfather it came in the shape of a few English friends, and in occasional\r\nescapes from the office into the outside England where, after the\r\ncenturies of separation, he found so much with which he could still feel\r\nprofoundly akin. His most constant friendly visitor was Henry A. Bright,\r\na university man, the son of a wealthy local merchant, who sent ships\r\nto Australia, and was related (as most agreeable Englishmen are--though\r\nthere are shining exceptions) to the aristocratic class. Bright, at this\r\ntime, could not have been over thirty years of age; he was intensely\r\nEnglish, though his slender figure and mental vivacity might make him\r\nseem near to the conventional American type. But through him, as through\r\nan open window, Hawthorne was enabled to see far into the very heart of\r\nEngland. Bright not merely knew England; he was England, and England at\r\nits best, and therefore also at its most insular and prejudiced. It\r\nwas unspeakably satisfying and agreeable to encounter a man at once so\r\nuncompromising and so amiable, so wrong-headed (from the American point\r\nof view) and so right-hearted. He was drawn to my father as iron is\r\ndrawn to the magnet; on every outward point they fought each other like\r\nthe knight errants of old, while agreeing inwardly, beneath the surface\r\nof things, as few friends are able to agree. Each admired the other's\r\nonslaughts and his prowess, and, by way of testifying his admiration,\r\nstrove to excel himself in his counter attacks. The debate was always\r\nbeginning, and in the nature of things it could never end; the effect\r\nof their blows was only to hammer each the other more firmly into his\r\nprevious convictions. Probably all the things that are English and all\r\nthe things that are American never before or since received such full\r\nand trenchant exposition as was given them by Hawthorne and by Bright.\r\nThe whole subject of monarchy and aristocracy as against republicanism\r\nand democracy was threshed out to the last kernel by champions each of\r\nwhom was thoroughly qualified to vindicate his cause. Each, constrained\r\nby the stress of battle to analyze and expound his beliefs more\r\npunctually than ever before, thereby convinced himself while leaving his\r\nadversary undaunted; and, of course, both were right. For this world is\r\nso constituted that two things incompatible in outward manifestation may\r\nin their roots be one and the same, and equally appeal to the suffrages\r\nof honest men. England and America are healthy and vigorous in\r\nproportion as they differ from each other, and a morbid and vicious\r\ntendency in either is noticeable the moment either begins to take a\r\nleaf from the other's book. My father and Bright could not have been the\r\nlifelong friends that they were had either of them yielded his point or\r\nstooped to compromise.\r\n\r\nApart from political matters, and such social themes as were nearly\r\nallied to them, the two friends had many points of agreement and\r\nsympathy. Bright had from the first been an ardent and intelligent\r\nadmirer of the romancer's writings, and though they might often differ\r\nin their estimates of individual works, they were in hearty accord as\r\nto the principles which underlie all literature and art. Upon matters\r\nrelating to society, my father was more apt to accept theories which\r\nBright might propound than to permit of their being illustrated in his\r\nown person; he would admit, for example, that a consul ought to mingle\r\nsocially with the people to whom he was accredited; but when it came\r\nto getting him out to dinner, in evening dress and with a speech in\r\nprospect, obstacles started up like the armed progeny of the Dragon's\r\nTeeth. For, though no one enjoyed real society more than he did, he was\r\nardently averse from conversing as an official with persons between whom\r\nand himself as a man there could be little sympathy. Almost as much,\r\ntoo, did he dislike to meet the polite world merely on the basis of the\r\nbooks that he had written, which his entertainers were bound to\r\npraise whether or not they had read or comprehended them, and to whose\r\nwell-meant but inexpert eulogies he must constantly respond with the\r\nthreadbare and pathetic phrase, \"I'm glad you liked it.\" Bright, of\r\ncourse, insisted that fame and position carried obligations which must\r\nbe met, and he was constantly laying plots to inveigle or surprise\r\nhis friend into compliance. He often succeeded, but he failed quite as\r\nfrequently, so that, as a Mrs. Malaprop might have said, Hawthorne as\r\na social lion was a rara avis, from first to last. The foible of\r\nartificial, as distinguished from spontaneous, society is that it so\r\nseldom achieves simple human relations.\r\n\r\nAnother chief friend of his was Francis Bennoch. England would never\r\nhave seemed \"our old home\" to my father, without the presence and\r\ncompanionship of these two men. Both had literary leanings, both were\r\ngenial, true, and faithful; but in other respects they were widely\r\ndissimilar. Bright was of the pure Saxon type; Bennoch represented Great\r\nBritain at large; there were mingled in him English, Irish, and\r\nScotch ancestry. In himself he was a superb specimen of a human being;\r\nbroad-shouldered, straight, and vigorous, massive but active, with a\r\nmellow, joyful voice, an inimitable brogue, sparkling black eyes full\r\nof hearty sunshine and kindness, a broad and high forehead over bushy\r\nbrows, and black, wavy hair. He bubbled over with high spirits, humor,\r\nand poetry, being, indeed, a poet in achievement, with a printed\r\nand bound volume to show for it--songs, lyrics, and narrative poems,\r\ncomposed in the spirit of Burns and Scott. He was at this time one\r\nof the handsomest men in England, with a great heart, warmer than any\r\nsummer England ever knew, and a soul of ardor and courage, which sent\r\nthrough his face continual flashes of sympathy and fellowship. One\r\nnaturally thought and spoke of him in superlatives; he was the kindest,\r\njolliest, most hospitable, most generous and chivalrous of men, and\r\nhis affection and admiration for my father were also of the superlative\r\nkind. He had made a fortune in the wool business, and had an office\r\nin Wood Street, London; but his affairs permitted him to make frequent\r\nexcursions to Liverpool, and to act as his American friend's guide\r\nand cicerone to many places in England which would otherwise have been\r\nunknown to him. My father enjoyed these trips immensely; Bennoch's\r\ncompanionship gave the right keynote and atmosphere to the sights they\r\nsaw. A real Englishman owns his country, and does the honors of it to a\r\nvisitor as if it were his private estate. Discussions of politics and of\r\nthe principles of government never arose between these two, as they did\r\nbetween my father and Bright; for Bennoch, though one of the most loyal\r\nand enthusiastic of her Majesty's subjects, and full of traditional\r\nrespect for the British nobility, was by nature broadly democratic,\r\nand met every man as an equal and a brother. One often finds this\r\ncontradiction in Englishmen; but it is such logically only. A man\r\nborn to the traditions of monarchy and aristocracy accepts them as the\r\nnatural background of his ideas, just as the English landscape is the\r\nsetting of his house and park; he will vindicate them if assailed; but\r\nordinarily they do not consciously affect his mental activities, and he\r\nwill talk good republicanism without being aware of it. The monarchy is\r\na decoration, a sentiment, a habit; as a matter of fact, England is more\r\ndemocratic in many essentials than we have as yet learned how to\r\nbe. Bennoch was not a university man, and lacked the historical\r\nconsciousness that Bright so assiduously cultivated; he lived by feeling\r\nand intuition more than by deliberate intellectual judgments. He was\r\nemotional; tears would start to his eyes at a touch of pathos or pity,\r\nas readily as the laughter of a moment before. So lovable, gallant,\r\nhonest, boyish a man is seldom born into this modern world-boyish as\r\nonly the manliest men can be. He died thirty years after the time I\r\nwrite of, the same fresh and ardent character as ever, and loving and\r\nserving Hawthorne's children for Hawthorne's sake. I shall have occasion\r\nto mention him hereafter; but I have dwelt upon him here, both because\r\nhe made it forever impossible for any one who knew him well to do other\r\nthan love the land which could breed such a man, and because, for the\r\nAmerican Hawthorne, he was as a hospitable gate-way through which the\r\nEngland of his dreams and imaginings was entered upon as a concrete and\r\ndelightful reality.\r\n\r\nWith Bright and Bennoch on his right hand and on his left, then, my\r\nfather began his English experience. The two are frequently mentioned\r\nin his English journals, and Bennoch figures as one of the subordinate\r\ncharacters in the posthumous romance called Doctor Grimshawe's Secret.\r\nIt is but a sketch of him, however, and considerably modified from the\r\nbrilliant and energetic reality. Meanwhile the consul began to accustom\r\nhimself to the routine of the consulate, and his family, leaving the\r\nsombre respectability of the Waterloo Hotel, moved, first, to the\r\nhospitable boarding-house of Mrs. Blodgett, and afterwards to a private\r\ndwelling in Rock Park, Rock Ferry, on the opposite side of the Mersey,\r\nwhere we were destined to dwell for several years. They were years full\r\nof events very trifling in themselves, but so utterly different from\r\neverything American as to stamp themselves upon the attention and the\r\nmemory. It is the trifling things that tell, and give character to\r\nnations; extraordinary things may occur anywhere, and possess little\r\nnational flavor. In another chapter I will attempt some portrayal of\r\nthis English life of fifty years since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\n     Patricians and plebeians--The discomforts of democracy--\r\n     Varieties of equality--Social rights of beggars--The coming\r\n     peril--Being dragged to the rich--Frankness of vulgarity and\r\n     hopelessness of destitution--Villages rooted in the\r\n     landscape--Evanescence of the spiritual and survival of the\r\n     material--\"Of Bebbington the holy peak\"--The Old Yew of\r\n     Eastham--Malice--prepense interest--History and afternoon\r\n     tea--An East-Indian Englishman--The merchantman sticks in\r\n     the mud--A poetical man of the world--Likeness to\r\n     Longfellow--Real breakfasts--Heads and stomachs--A poet-\r\n     pugilist--Clean-cut, cold, gentle, dry--A respectable female\r\n     atheist--The tragedy of the red ants--Voluptuous struggles--\r\n     A psalm of praise.\r\n\r\nIn a country whose ruling principle is caste, it might be expected that\r\nthe line of cleavage between the upper and the lower grades would be\r\npunctually observed. It is assumed that democracy levels and aristocracy\r\ndistinguishes and separates. My father was not long in remarking,\r\nhowever, that there was a freedom of intercourse between the patrician\r\nand the plebeian--between people of all orders--such as did not exist in\r\nAmerica. And the fact, once perceived, was not difficult of explanation.\r\nIn a monarchy of a thousand years' standing, every individual knows his\r\nplace in the social scale and never thinks of leaving it. He represents\r\na fixed function or element in the general organism, and holds to it as\r\na matter of course, just as, in the human body, the body does not aspire\r\nto be the head, nor the liver or heart to take the place of lungs\r\nor stomach. The laborer looks back upon an ancestry of laborers; the\r\nshopkeeper has been a shopkeeper for unnumbered generations; the artisan\r\non the bench to-day does the same work that his father and grandfathers\r\ndid before him; the noble inherits his acres as inevitably as the sun\r\nrises, and sits in the House of Lords by immemorial usage and privilege.\r\nSocial position all along the line being thus anchored in the nature\r\nof things, as it were, there is no anxiety on any one's part as to\r\nmaintaining his status. He is secure where he is, and nothing and nobody\r\ncan change him. There is no individual striving to rise nor fear to\r\nfall. Consequently there can and must be entire freedom of mutual\r\nconversation; the marquis with a revenue of half a million a year meets\r\nas an equal his gardener who gets ten pounds a month, and the tailor\r\nin his measuring-room offers a glass of sherry to his noble patron who\r\ncomes to him for a new coat. Each is at his ease, conscious that he\r\nperforms a use and fills a place which no one else can fill or perform,\r\nand that nothing else matters. The population is a vast mutual-benefit\r\nassociation, without envy on the one side or contempt on the other. And\r\nsocial existence moves as smoothly as a well-oiled and adjusted machine.\r\n\r\nThis agreeable condition is impossible in a democracy--at all events, in\r\na democracy like ours, which is based upon the assumption that all men\r\nare equal. Nevertheless, we are on the right track, and the English\r\nare on the wrong one; for the agreeable English system obstructs the\r\ninsensible infiltration of fresh material into old forms, which is\r\nessential to the continued health of the latter; while the democracy,\r\non the other hand, will gradually learn that it is just as honorable and\r\ndesirable to be a good shoemaker, for example, as a good millionaire;\r\nthat human life, in short, is a complex of countless different uses,\r\neach one of which is as important on its own plane as any of the others.\r\nBut the intermediate period is undeniably irksome.\r\n\r\nSo my father noticed, not without a certain satisfaction, that even\r\nbeggars, in England, are not looked down upon, and that their rights,\r\nsuch as they are, are recognized. In the steamboat waiting-room at Rock\r\nFerry, and in the boats themselves, he saw tramps and mendicants take\r\nthe best place at the fire or on the companion-way without rebuke and\r\nwithout consciousness of presumption, and he saw the landlord of a\r\nhotel, with a fortune of six hundred thousand pounds, wait at table\r\nas deferentially as any footman in his employ. He was struck by the\r\ncontentment with which, in winter, women went barefoot in the streets,\r\nand by the unpretentious composure with which the common herd, on\r\nholidays, disported themselves in public, not seeking to disguise their\r\nnative vulgarity and shabbiness. At the same time, he could not help\r\na misgiving that the portentous inequality between rich and poor must\r\nfinally breed disaster; the secluded luxury of the rich was too strongly\r\ncontrasted with the desperate needs of the poor. This contrast was very\r\nmarked in England fifty years ago, and was comparatively unknown in our\r\nown country--though to-day we can hardly lay to our souls the nattering\r\nunction of such a difference. The rage for wealth has done for us in a\r\ngeneration what caste did for England in a thousand years.\r\n\r\nMy father, when opportunity offered, was always finding himself among\r\nthe poor and their dwellings; he had to be dragged to the rich, though\r\namong them, too, he found, when brought in contact with them, many\r\ninteresting points of dissimilarity from ourselves. His office as consul\r\nnaturally took him often to the police courts, where magistrates passed\r\nupon the squalid cases cited before them, and in the consulate itself\r\nhe saw specimens enough of human crime and misery. He visited the\r\npoor-house and the insane asylum, he was approached by swindlers of all\r\ntypes, and often he went to fairs and other resorts of public out-door\r\namusement and watched the unwashed populace at its play. Beggars\r\nfollowed him on the streets, awaited him in their chosen coigns of\r\nvantage on the corners, or haunted him on the ferry-boat that took\r\nhim each day from his home to his office. Wherever he encountered\r\nthe forsaken of fortune, he found food for sympathy, and, in spite of\r\nassurances that he was only encouraging mendicancy, he often gave them\r\nmoney. It was hard for him to believe that there could be abject poverty\r\nwhere there was work for all, and the appeal of man in want to man in\r\nplenty was too strong for him easily to resist it. He liked the very\r\nfrankness of vulgarity and hopeless destitution of these people, and was\r\nappalled by the simplicity with which they accepted things as they were.\r\nThere was no restlessness, as in America--no protest against fate. It\r\nwas harrowing enough to see conditions so miserable; it was intolerable\r\nto see them acquiesced in by the victims as inevitable. He learned,\r\nafter a while, to harden himself somewhat against manifest imposition;\r\nbut the refusal to give cost him quite as much in discomfort as giving\r\ndid in purse.\r\n\r\nThe country villages and cottages, however, afforded him compensating\r\npleasure. In the neighborhood of Rock Ferry, on the shore of the\r\nMersey opposite from Liverpool, there were two or three ancient little\r\nsettlements which he loved to visit. The thatched and whitewashed\r\ncottages, with their tiny gardens of hollyhocks and marigolds, seemed\r\nlike parts of the framework of the land; the passage of centuries only\r\nserved to weld them more firmly in their places. The villages were\r\nmassed together, each in a small space, instead of being dispread\r\nloosely over a township, as in his native New England, and enduring\r\nstone and plaster took the place of timber and shingles. But the\r\nchurches, small and fabulously ancient, affected him most. He placed his\r\nhand on stones which had been set in place before William the Conqueror\r\nlanded in England, and this physical survival seemed to bring into his\r\nactual presence the long succession of all the intervening ages. These\r\nstructures, still so solid and serviceable, had witnessed the passing of\r\nthe entire procession of English history; all the mighty men and events\r\nof her career had come and gone while they remained unscathed. Under his\r\nfeet were the graves of the unknown dead; within the narrow precincts he\r\ninhaled that strange, antique odor of mortality that made him feel as\r\nif he were breathing the air of long-dead centuries. This apparent\r\nevanescence of the spiritual attested by the survival of the material is\r\none of the most singular and impressive of sensations; it takes history\r\nout of the realm of the mind, and brings it into sensible manifestation.\r\nIt is almost as affecting as if the very figures of departed actors of\r\nformer ages were to reappear and rub shoulders with us of today, and\r\ncast their shadows in the contemporary sunshine.\r\n\r\nOn most of these walks in the neighborhood of Rock Ferry I was my\r\nfather's companion, but, though my legs could march beside his, my\r\nmental-equipment could not participate in his meditations. He would\r\noccasionally make some half-playful, imaginative remark, calculated to\r\nhelp me realize the situation that was so vividly present to himself.\r\nHis thoughts, however deep, were always ready to break into playfulness\r\noutwardly. We often walked through the village of Bebbington, whose\r\nchurch had a high stone steeple, nearly to the summit of which the\r\nancient ivy had clambered. And as it came in view he would always say,\r\nin a sort of recitative, perhaps reminiscent of Scott's narrative poems,\r\nwhich he was at that time reading aloud to us, \"There is of Bebbington\r\nthe holy peak!\" To which I would as constantly rejoin, \"'Of Bebbington\r\nthe holy spire,' father!\"--being offended by his use of a word so\r\nunmusical as peak. He would only smile and trudge onward. He was\r\nsomewhat solicitous, I suspect, to check in his son any tendency towards\r\nmere poetical sentiment; his own imaginative faculty was rooted in\r\ncommon-sense, and he knew the value of the latter in curbing undue\r\nexcursions into the fanciful and transcendental.\r\n\r\nIn Eastham, on the village green, stood an old yew-tree which, six\r\ncenturies before, had been traditionally called The Old Yew of Eastham,\r\nand was probably at least coeval with the village itself, which was one\r\nof the oldest in England. It was of enormous girth, and was still in\r\nleaf; but nothing but the bark was left of the great trunk; all the wood\r\nhad decayed away so long ago that the memory of man held no record of\r\nit. There was a great conical gap in one side, like an open door, and it\r\nwas my custom--as it had doubtless been that of innumerable children of\r\nages gone--to enter this door and \"play house\" in the spacious interior.\r\nMeanwhile my father would seat himself on the twisted roots without, and\r\nlet his thoughts drift back to the time when this huge hulk had first\r\ncast a slender shadow over the greensward of primitive, Saxon England.\r\nIt was a massive tree before the Domesday Book was begun; Chaucer\r\nwould not be heard of for four hundred years to come; and where was\r\nShakespeare? What was suspected of America? Yet here was this venerable\r\nvegetable, still with life enough left in it, perhaps, to see the end of\r\nEnglish monarchy. The yew was a fact; but the ghosts were the reality,\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nThese obscure village antiquities, which had no special history\r\nattaching to them, were in a way more impressive than the great ruins of\r\nEngland, which had formed the scene and background of famous events. The\r\nlatter had become conventional sights, which the tourist felt bound to\r\ninspect under the voluble and exasperating guidance of a professional\r\nshowman; and this malice-prepense sort of interest and picturesqueness\r\nalways tried Hawthorne's patience and sympathy a little. It is the\r\nunknown past that is most fascinating, that comes home closest to the\r\nheart. The things told of in history books are hackneyed, and they\r\npartake of the unreality inherent in the descriptions of the writers.\r\nBut the unrecorded things are virgin, and enter into our most private\r\nsympathies and realization. My father viewed and duly admired the\r\ngreat castles, palaces, and cathedrals of England; but he loved the old\r\nvillages and their appurtenances, and could dream dreams more moving\r\nunder the shadow of Eastham Yew than in Westminster Abbey itself.\r\n\r\nThe historic houses and country-seats which were still inhabited were\r\nstill more difficult to get in touch with from the historic point of\r\nview; the present dazzled the past out of sight. One was told who built\r\nthis facade, who added that wing, who was imprisoned in yonder tower;\r\nwhere Queen Elizabeth slept, and the foot of what martyr imprinted the\r\nBloody Footstep on the threshold.\r\n\r\nBut you listened to these tales over a cup of tea in the drawing-room,\r\nor between the soup and the roast beef at the dinner-table, and\r\nthey were not convincing. How were these ruddy-cheeked, full-bodied,\r\nhospitable personages who sat about you to be held compatible with the\r\nromantic periods and characters that they described? The duck and the\r\ngreen pease, the plum-pudding and the port, the white neck-cloths and\r\nthe bare necks were too immediate and potent. In many cases, too,\r\nthe denizens of the ancient houses were not lineal descendants of the\r\noriginal founders; they were interlopers, by purchase or otherwise. In\r\nthemselves they were kind and agreeable, their manners were excellent,\r\nthey helped one to comprehend the England of the passing moment; but\r\nthey only clipped the wings of imagination and retrospect. It was\r\nonly after an interval of some years that Hawthorne was able so far to\r\nrecover from the effect of their obtrusive existence as to be able to\r\nsee through them and beyond them to the splendid and gloomy vistas in\r\nfront of which they were grouped.\r\n\r\nYet England, past and present, rich and poor, real and ideal, did\r\nsomehow enter into him and become a part of his permanent consciousness,\r\nand he liked it better than anything else he had known. Even the social\r\nlife, though he came to it under some compulsion, rewarded him in the\r\nlong run. One of the first personal invitations was to the country-seat\r\nof the Brights, where he met the family and relatives of his friend\r\nHenry Bright. Bright's father was a remarkable figure; he resembled an\r\nEast-Indian more than an Englishman. He was dark, slender, courteous,\r\nand vivid; in long after-years I saw Brahmins like him in India. I would\r\nliken him to a rajah, except that rajahs of his age are commonly become\r\ngross and heavy from indulgence, whereas he had an almost ascetic\r\naspect. His manners were singularly soft and caressing; he courted his\r\nwife, when he returned each day from business, as if they were still\r\nin their honeymoon, and his conduct towards all who surrounded him was\r\nsimilarly polished. He did not in the least resemble his Saxon son; and\r\nfor my part, looking at him from the primitive boy stand-point, I never\r\nsuspected that he was related to my father's young friend. He had made a\r\nfortune in colonial trade, and may possibly have been born in India. At\r\nthis juncture the dealings of his firm were chiefly with Australia, and\r\nthe largest merchant steamship then in the world had just been built for\r\nthem, and Hawthorne was invited to the launching. For a British merchant\r\nprince such an occasion could not but be of supreme importance and\r\npride. Mr. Bright's Oriental visage was radiant; his white hair seemed\r\nto shine with an added lustre; the reserve of the Englishman was\r\nforgotten, and he showed the excitement and emotion that he felt. There\r\nwas a distinguished company on the great deck to witness his triumph\r\nand congratulate him upon it. All went well; at the appointed signal the\r\nretaining obstructions were cut away, and the mighty vessel began its\r\ndescent into the waiting river. A lady of his family smashed a bottle\r\nof wine over the graceful bows. For a few moments there was a majestic,\r\nsweeping movement downward; then, of a sudden, it was checked. It was\r\nas if a great life had been quenched at the instant when its heart first\r\nbegan to throb. A murmur of dismay ran through the assemblage; but it\r\nwas in the face of Mr. Bright that the full tragedy of the disaster was\r\ndisplayed. Never was seen a swifter change from the highest exultation\r\nto the depths of consternation. The color left his cheeks; heavy lines\r\nappeared about his handsome mouth; his eyes became fixed, and seemed to\r\nsink into his head; his erect figure drooped like that of one who has\r\nreceived a mortal blow. It was only that the ship had stuck in the deep\r\nmud of the river bottom; but all ship-owners are superstitious, and the\r\nold man foreboded the worst. The ship was floated again some days later;\r\nbut the omens were fulfilled; she was lost on her first voyage. I do not\r\nremember seeing Mr. Bright after this event, but I know he never again\r\nwas the same man as before.\r\n\r\nRichard Monckton Milnes, who was afterwards Lord Houghton, was greatly\r\nattracted towards my father, who liked him; but circumstances prevented\r\ntheir seeing much of each other. Milnes was then forty-five years old;\r\nhe was a Cambridge man, and intimate with Tennyson, Hallam, and other\r\nmen of literary mark, and he was himself a minor poet, and warm in the\r\ncause of literature. During his parliamentary career, in 1837, he was\r\ninstrumental in passing the copyright act. He had travelled in Greece\r\nand Italy in his twenties; was fond of society, and society of him. A\r\nmore urbane and attractive English gentleman did not exist; everything\r\nthat a civilized man could care for was at his disposal, and he made the\r\nmost of his opportunities. His manners were quiet and cordial, with a\r\ntouch of romance and poetry mingling with the man-of-the-world tone in\r\nhis conversation, and he was quite an emotional man. I have more than\r\nonce seen tears in his eyes and heard a sob in his voice when matters\r\nthat touched his heart or imagination were discussed. There was, indeed,\r\na vein of sadness and pessimism in Milnes, though only his intimates\r\nwere aware of it; it was the pessimism of a man who has too much leisure\r\nfor intellectual analysis and not enough actual work to do to keep him\r\noccupied. It lent a fine flavor of irony to some of his conversation.\r\nHe was liberal in politics and liberal in his attitude towards life in\r\ngeneral; but there was not force enough in him, or, at any rate, not\r\nstimulus enough, to lift him to distinction. Some of his poems, however,\r\nbetrayed a deep and radical vein of thought. He was of middle height,\r\nwell made, light built, with a large and well-formed head and wavy, dark\r\nhair. His likeness to Longfellow was marked, though he was hardly so\r\nhandsome a man; but the type of head and face was the same--the forehead\r\nand brain well developed, the lower parts of the countenance small and\r\nrefined, though sensuous. His eyes were dark, brilliant, and expressive.\r\nHe, like the old poet Rogers, made a feature of giving breakfasts to\r\nchosen friends, and as he had the whole social world to choose from,\r\nand unfailing good taste, his breakfasts were well worth attending. They\r\nwere real breakfasts--so far as the hour was concerned--not lunches or\r\nearly dinners in masquerade; but wine was served at them, and Milnes\r\nwas very hospitable and had an Anacreontic or Omar touch in him.\r\nTo breakfast with him, therefore, meant--unless you were singularly\r\nabstemious and strong-minded--to discount the remaining meals of the\r\nday. But the amount of good cheer that an Englishman can carry and seem\r\nnot obscured by it surprises an American. A bottle or so of hock of a\r\nmorning will make most Americans feel that business, for the rest of\r\nthat day, is an iridescent dream; but an Englishman does not seem to be\r\nburdened by it--at any rate, he did not fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: RICHARD MONCKTON MILNES]\r\n\r\nAnother hearty companion was Bryan Waller Procter, who, for literary\r\nuses, anagrammed his name into Barry Cornwall, and made it famous, fifty\r\nyears ago, as that of the best song-writer in contemporary England. But\r\nhe had made a literary reputation before the epoch of his songs; there\r\nwere four or five dramatic and narrative poems to his credit published\r\nduring the first quarter of the last century. Procter was, indeed,\r\nalready a veteran in 1854, having been born in 1787, and bred to the\r\nbar, to which he was admitted in 1831. But he spent the active thirty\r\nyears of his life in the discharge of that function which seems often\r\nsought by respectable Englishmen-commissioner of lunacy. He sent my\r\nfather a small volume containing the Songs, and some fragments; they\r\nfully deserved their reputation. The fragments were mostly scraps of\r\ndramatic dialogue, of which one at least sticks in my memory:\r\n\r\n\"She was a princess; but she fell; and now Her shame goes blushing down\r\na line of kings.\"\r\n\r\nAs I recollect him, he may have looked like a commissioner of lunacy,\r\nbut he did not look like a poet; he was rather undersized, with a\r\ncompact head and a solemn face, and the quietest, most unobtrusive\r\nbearing imaginable. He was a well-made little man, and he lived to a\r\ngreat age, dying some time in the seventies, at the age of eighty-seven.\r\nHe told my father that after leaving Harrow School he was distinguished\r\nin athletics, and for a time sparred in public with some professional\r\nbruiser. He had been a school-mate of Byron and Sir Robert Peel, and had\r\nknown Lamb, Kean, and the other lights of that generation. He was a most\r\nlikeable and remunerative companion. His wife, who survived him (living,\r\nI think, to be over ninety), was a woman of intellect and charm, and she\r\nretained her attractiveness to the end of her life. There are poets who\r\nare consumed early by their own fires, and others who are gently warmed\r\nby them beyond the common span of human existence, and Barry Cornwall\r\nwas one of these, and transmitted his faculty, through sympathetic\r\naffection, to his wife.\r\n\r\nOf renown not less than the song-writer's was the metaphysical\r\ntheologian, James Martineau, then in the Liverpool epoch of his career.\r\nHe was a clean-cut, cold, gentle, dry character, with a somewhat\r\nEmersonian cast of countenance, but with the Emersonian humanity and\r\nhumility left out. Like Emerson, he had ascended a Unitarian pulpit,\r\nbut, unlike Emerson, he stayed there long after what he was pleased to\r\nregard as his convictions had ceased to possess even a Unitarian degree\r\nof religious quality. He was always apostolic in his manner, and his\r\nutterances were ex cathedra, and yet his whole long life was a story\r\nof changing views on the subjects he had chosen to be the theme of his\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nHe was the great opponent of orthodoxy in his day, yet he led his\r\nfollowers to no goal more explicit than might be surmised from a study\r\nof Kant and Hegel. He was, however, sincere in his devotion to\r\nthe will-o'-the-wisp that he conceived to be the truth, and he was\r\ncourageous enough to admit that he never satisfied himself. There was\r\nchilly and austere attraction about the man; he was so elevated\r\nand superior that one could hardly help believing that he must know\r\nsomething of value, and this illusion was the easier because he did know\r\nso much in the way of scholarly learning. My father felt respect for\r\nhis character, but was bored by his metaphysics--a form of intellectual\r\nathletics which he had exhausted while still a young man. James's sister\r\nHarriet was also of the company. She was so deaf as to be obliged to use\r\nan ear-trumpet, and she was as positive in her views (which had become\r\navowedly atheistic) as her brother, and whenever any one began to\r\nutter anything with which she disagreed, she silenced him by the simple\r\nexpedient of dropping the ear-trumpet. In herself, she was an agreeable\r\nold lady; but she seldom let her opinions rest long enough for one to\r\nget at her on the merely human side, and she cultivated a retired life,\r\npartly on account of her deafness, partly because her opinions made\r\nsociety shy of her, and partly because she did not think society worth\r\nher time and attention. She was a good woman, with a mind of exceptional\r\ncaliber, but the world admired more than it desired her.\r\n\r\nAs a relief from the consideration of these exalted personages, I am\r\ndisposed to relate a tragic anecdote about our friend Henry Bright.\r\nEarly in our Rock Ferry residence he came to dine with us--or I rather\r\nthink it was to supper. At any rate, it was an informal occasion, and\r\nthe children were admitted to table. My mother had in the cupboard a jar\r\nof excellent raspberry jam, and she brought it forth for the delectation\r\nof our guest. He partook of it liberally, and said he had never eaten\r\nany jam so good; it had a particular tang to it, he declared, which\r\noutdid his best recollections of all previous raspberry jam from his\r\nboyhood up. While he was in the midst of these rhapsodies, and still\r\nconsuming their subject with enthusiasm, my mother, who had taken some\r\nof the jam on her own plate, suddenly made a ghastly discovery. The\r\njam-pot had been for several days standing in the cupboard with its top\r\noff, or ajar, and an innumerable colony of almost microscopic red ants\r\nhad discovered it, and launched themselves fervently upon it and into\r\nit; it had held them fast in its sweet but fatal embrace, and other\r\nmyriads had followed their fellows into the same delicious and\r\ndestructive abyss. What the precise color of the ants may have been\r\nbefore they became incorporate with the jam is not known; but as the\r\ncase was, they could be distinguished from it only by their voluptuous\r\nstruggles in its controlling stickiness. Only the keenest eye could\r\ndiscern them, and the eyes of Henry Bright were among the most\r\nnear-sighted in England. Besides, according to his custom, he was\r\ntalking with the utmost volubility all the time.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? My father and mother stealthily exchanged an awful\r\nlook, and the question was settled. It was too late to recall the\r\nants which our friend had devoured by tens of thousands. It seemed not\r\nprobable that, were he kept in ignorance of his predicament, they\r\nwould do him any serious bodily injury; whereas, were he enlightened,\r\nimagination might get in her fatal work. Accordingly, a rigorous silence\r\nupon the subject was maintained, and the dear innocent actually devoured\r\nnearly that whole potful of red ants, accompanying the meal with a\r\ncontinual psalm of praise of their exquisite flavor; and never till the\r\nday of his death did he suspect what the secret of that flavor was. I\r\nbelieve the Chinese eat ants and regard them as a luxury. Very likely\r\nthey are right; but at that period of my boyhood I had not heard of\r\nthis, and then and often afterwards did I meditate with misgivings upon\r\nthe predicament of Henry Bright's stomach after his banquet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\n     Life in Rock Park--Inconvenient independence of lodgings--\r\n     The average man--\"How many gardeners have you got?\"--\r\n     Shielded by rose-leaves of culture and refinement--The\r\n     English middle class--Prejudice, complacency, and Burke's\r\n     Peerage--Never heard of Tennyson or Browning--Satisfaction\r\n     in the solid earth--A bond of fellowship--A damp, winding,\r\n     verdurous street--The parent of stucco villas--Inactivity of\r\n     individual conscience--A plateau and a cliff-dwelling--\"The\r\n     Campbells are Coming!\"--Sortes Virgiliance--A division in\r\n     the family--Precaution against famine--English praying and\r\n     card-playing--Exercise for mind and body--Knight-errantry--\r\n     Sentimentality and mawkishness--The policeman and the\r\n     cobbler--A profound truth--Fireworks by lamplight--Mr.\r\n     Squarey and Mrs. Roundey--Sandford and Merton--The ball of\r\n     jolly.\r\n\r\nThat life at Rock Park had in it more unadulterated English quality than\r\nany other with which we became conversant while in England. With the\r\nexception of a short sojourn in Leamington, it was the only experience\r\nvouchsafed us of renting a house. All the rest of the time we lived in\r\nlodging or boarding houses, or in hotels. The boarding-houses of England\r\nare like other boarding-houses; the hotels, or inns, in the middle of\r\nthe last century, were for the most part plain and homely compared with\r\nwhat we have latterly been used to; but the English lodging-house system\r\nhad peculiarities. You enjoyed independence, but you paid for it with\r\ninconveniences. The owner of the house furnished you with nothing except\r\nthe house, with its dingy beds, chairs, tables, and carpets. Everything\r\nelse necessary to existence you got for yourself. You made your own\r\ncontracts with butcher, baker, and grocer. You did your own firing and\r\nlighting. Your sole conversation with the owner was over the weekly bill\r\nfor the rooms. You might cater to yourself to the tune of the prince or\r\nof the pauper, as your means or your inclination suggested, but you\r\nmust do it upon the background of the same dingy rooms. Dingy or not so\r\ndingy, the rooms, of course, never fitted you; they were a Procrustes\r\nbed, always incompatible, in one way or in another, with the proportions\r\nwhich nature had bestowed upon you. You wondered, in your misanthropic\r\nmoments, whether there ever was or could be any one whom English\r\nlodgings would exactly fit. Probably they were designed for the average\r\nman, a person, as we all know, who exists only in the imagination of\r\nstatisticians. And if the environment shows the man, one cannot help\r\nrejoicing that there is so little likelihood of one's forming the\r\naverage man's acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing peculiar about rented houses in England beyond the\r\ninnate peculiarities attaching to them as English. If the house were\r\nunfurnished, and you had leisure to pick and choose, you might suit\r\nyourself tolerably well, always with the proviso that things English\r\ncould be suitable to the foreigner. And certainly, in the 1850's, the\r\nEnglish commanded living conditions more desirable, on the whole, than\r\nAmericans did. They understood comfort, as distinct from luxury--a pitch\r\nof civilization to which we are even now but just attaining. There\r\nwas not then, and until the millennium there will probably never be,\r\nanything else in the world which so ministered to physical ease and\r\ngeneral satisfaction as did the conditions of life among the English\r\nupper classes. Kublai Khan, in Xanadu, never devised a pleasure-dome so\r\nalluring to mere human nature-especially the English variety of it--as\r\nwas afforded by an English nobleman's country-seat. Tennyson's Palace\r\nof Art is very good in poetry, but in real life the most imaginative and\r\nenergetic real-estate dealer could not have got so good a price for it\r\nas would gladly have been paid for the dwelling of, for example,\r\nthe Duke of Westminster. \"How many gardeners have you got?\" asked an\r\nAmerican Minister of the duke of the period, after meeting a fresh\r\ngardener, during a long afternoon stroll through the grounds, at each\r\nnew turn of the path. \"Oh, I don't know--I fancy about forty,\" replied\r\nthe duke, somewhat taken aback by this demand for precise information\r\nconcerning the facts of his own establishment, which, until that moment,\r\nhe probably supposed had been attended to by Providence. And really,\r\nthe machinery of life in such a place is so hidden, it is so nearly\r\nautomatic, that one might easily believe it to be operated according to\r\nsome law of nature. The servants are (or were) so well trained, they did\r\ntheir jobs so well, that you were conscious only of their being done;\r\nyou never saw them a-doing. The thought happened to cross your mind, of\r\na morning, that you would like to take a drive at eleven o'clock; you\r\nwere not aware that you had mentioned the matter; but at eleven o'clock\r\nthe carriage was, somehow, at the door. At dinner, the dishes appeared\r\nand disappeared, the courses succeeded one another, invisibly, or as if\r\nby mere fiat of the will; you must be very wide-awake to catch a footman\r\nor butler meddling with the matter. You went up to the bedroom to change\r\nyour dress; you came down with it changed; but only by an effort could\r\nyou recall the fact that a viewless but supremely efficient valet had\r\nbeen concerned in the transaction. The coal fire in the grate needed\r\npoking; you glanced away for a moment; when you looked at the fire again\r\nit had been poked--had, to all appearance, poked itself. And so in all\r\nrelations; to desire was to get; to picture a condition was to realize\r\nit. You were shielded on every side by rose-leaves of culture and\r\nrefinement; all you had to do was to allow your mind to lapse from\r\none conception to another, and then, lifting your languorous eyelids,\r\nbehold! there you were--as Mr. James would say.\r\n\r\nBut I set out to tell not of noblemen's country-seats, but of Rock\r\nPark. Rock Park was one of the typical abodes of the English respectable\r\nmiddle-class, and the English middle-class, respectable, or not\r\naltogether respectable, is the substance of England. Not until you have\r\nfelt and smelt and tasted that do you know what England really is.\r\nFifty years ago, the people in question were dull, ignorant, material,\r\nselfish, prejudiced, conventional; they were hospitable, on conventional\r\nlines; they were affable and even social, so long as you did not awaken\r\ntheir prejudices; they were confidential and communicative, if you\r\nconceded at the outset that England was the best of all countries and\r\nthe English the leading nation of the world. They read a newspaper\r\nresembling in every particular themselves; usually several of them\r\nunited in a subscription to a single copy, which passed solemnly from\r\nhand to hand. They were slow and methodical, never taking short-cuts\r\nacross lots; but they were punctual; they knew their own business and\r\nbusiness associates, their circle of relatives, their dwelling and\r\nsocial place, and Burke's Peerage; but they knew nothing else. In a\r\ngroup of intelligent persons of this degree, question was raised, once\r\nupon a time, of two English poets; but not one of the group had heard\r\nof either; the poets were Alfred Tennyson and Robert Browning. This may\r\nseem merely absurd or apocryphal; but consider the terrible power of\r\nconcentration which it implies! And consider the effect which the impact\r\nagainst such a clay wall must make upon a man and an American like my\r\nfather!\r\n\r\nWell, the very surprise and novelty of the adventure amused and\r\ninterested him, and even won a good deal upon his sympathies. He loved\r\nthe solid earth as well as the sky above it, and he was glad of the\r\nassurance that this people existed, though he might be devoutly thankful\r\nthat two hundred years of America had opened so impassable a gulf\r\nbetween him and them. Indeed, the very fact of that impassability may\r\nhave made his intercourse with them the easier--at any rate, on\r\nhis side. On their side, they regarded him with a dim but always\r\nself-complacent curiosity; had he not been a consul, they would probably\r\nnot have regarded him at all. Of course they--the Rock Park sort of\r\npeople--had never read his books; literary cultivation was not to\r\nbe found in England lower down than the gentleman class. My father,\r\ntherefore, was never obliged to say, \"I'm glad you liked it\" to them.\r\nAnd that relief, of itself, must have served as a substantial bond of\r\nfellowship.\r\n\r\nRock Park, as I remember it, was a damp, winding, verdurous street,\r\nprotected at each end by a small granite lodge, and studded throughout\r\nits length with stuccoed villas. The villas were mended-on to each other\r\n(as one of the children expressed it) two and two; they had front yards\r\nfilled with ornamental shrubbery, and gardens at the back, an acre or\r\ntwo in extent; they were fenced in with iron pickets, and there were\r\ngates to the driveways, on which the children swung. Every normal child\r\nsupposes that gates are made for no other purpose. The trees were not\r\nlarge, but there were many of them, and they were thick with leaves.\r\nThere was a damp, arboreal smell everywhere, mingled with the finer\r\nperfume of flowers and of the hawthorns and yellow laburnums. Flowers,\r\nespecially purple English violets, grew profusely in the gardens, and\r\ngooseberry-bushes, bearing immense gooseberries such as our climate\r\ndoes not nourish. There were also armies of garden--snails, handsome\r\ngasteropods, which were of great interest to me; for I was entering,\r\nat this period, upon a passionate pursuit of natural history. For many\r\nyears I supposed that the odor of the violets proceeded from snails, and\r\nto this day I always associate snails with violets, or vice versa. Una,\r\nRose, and I were given each a section of a garden-bed for our own; I\r\ncultivated mine so assiduously that it became quite a deep hole; but I\r\ndo not recall that anything ever grew in it. The soil was a very rich\r\nloam, and ceaseless diligence must have been required in me to keep it\r\nbarren.\r\n\r\nGray skies, frequent showers, a cool or semi-chilly mildness, varied\r\nevery little while by the intrusion of a yellow fog from Liverpool,\r\nover the river--such was the climate of Rock Park. There were occasional\r\npassages of sunshine; but never, that I recollect, an entire day of it.\r\nThe stucco of the villas was streaked with green dampness, and peeling\r\noff here and there. I suspect that the fashion of castellated, stuccoed\r\nvillas may have been set in the eighteenth century by Horace Walpole\r\nwhen he built that marvellous edifice known as Strawberry Hill. I first\r\nsaw that achievement twenty years after the time of which I now write,\r\nand recognized in it, as I thought, the parent of my former Rock Park\r\nhome and of innumerable of the latter's kindred. Strawberry Hill is\r\nsprawling and vast, the progeny are liliputian, but the family likeness\r\nis striking. The idea is to build something which shall seem to be all\r\nthat it is not. The gray-white stucco pretends to be stone, and the\r\nlines of the stone courses are carefully painted on the roughened\r\nsurface; but nobody, since Horace's time, could ever have been deceived\r\nby them. The castellated additions and ornamentation are all bogus, of\r\nthe cheapest and vulgarest sort. It is singular that a people so sincere\r\nand solid as the English are supposed to be should adopt this fashion\r\nfor their dwellings. But then they are used to follow conventions and\r\nadopt fashions set them by those whom they esteem to be their betters,\r\nwithout thought, or activity of individual conscience. It is rather\r\nmatter for wonder, remembering what rascals and humbugs many of their\r\n\"betters\" have been, that middle-class England is not more of a whited\r\nsepulchre than it is. I do not mean to cast any reflections upon the\r\nadmirable and beguiling Horace; but he was a highly civilized person,\r\nand had a brother named Robert, and perhaps solid sincerity should not\r\nbe expected from such a combination.\r\n\r\nOur villa, within, was close and comfortable enough, for its era\r\nand degree; but the furniture was ponderous and ugly to the point of\r\nnightmare. The chairs, tables, and sofas wore the semblance of solid\r\nmahogany, twisted and tortured in a futile struggle to achieve elegance;\r\nthe carvings, or mouldings, were screwed or glued on, and the lines of\r\nstructure, intended to charm the eye, accomplished only the discomfort\r\nof the body. The dining-table was like a plateau; the sideboard\r\nresembled a cliff-dwelling. The carpets were of the Brussels ilk:\r\nacanthus-leaves and roses and dahlias wreathed in inextricable\r\nconvolutions, glowing with the brightest and most uncompromising\r\nhues. The lace curtains were imitation lace; the damask curtains\r\nwere imitation damask. The bedsteads.... But this is not a History of\r\nEngland. After all, we were snug and comfortable. On the walls were\r\nportraits of the family whose house this was; by name, Campbell; the\r\nhouse-painter, or wood-grainer, one would suppose, had a leaning towards\r\nthis branch of art. I never saw the originals of these portraits, but,\r\nupon the assumption that they had been faithfully interpreted by the\r\nartist, I used to think, in my childish folly, that the refrain of the\r\nold song, \"The Campbells are Coming,\" was meant as a phrase or threat to\r\nfrighten people. Who would not have run upon such an announcement? As\r\nI have already made one confession in these pages not reflecting credit\r\nupon myself, I may as well make another now. Just thirty years after\r\nthe events I am describing, somebody wrote to me from Rock Park, stating\r\nthat the local inhabitants were desirous of putting up on the house\r\nwhich Hawthorne had occupied there a marble or bronze slab, recording\r\nthe fact for the benefit of pilgrims. The committee, however, did not\r\nknow which of three or four houses was the right one, and the writer\r\nenclosed photographs of them all, and requested me to put a cross over\r\nour former habitation. Now, all the houses in Rock Park had been turned\r\nout of the same mould, and I knew no more than my interrogator which was\r\nwhich. But I reflected that the committee had been put to trouble and\r\nexpense for photographs, postage-stamps, and what not, and that all that\r\nwas really wanted was something to be sentimental over. So, rather than\r\ndisappoint them, I resorted to a kind of sortes Virgillana; I shut my\r\neyes, turned round thrice, and made a mark at hazard on the line of\r\nphotographs. The chances against my having hit it right were only four\r\nto one; the committee were satisfied, the pilgrims have been made happy,\r\nand it is difficult to see where harm has been done. Nevertheless, the\r\nmatter has weighed somewhat on my conscience ever since, and I am glad\r\nto have thus lightened myself of it. What would one better do in such\r\ncircumstances? Is history written in this way?\r\n\r\nThe custom of our family in America had been to take all our meals\r\ntogether; but in England the elders take lunch at noon, tea at four or\r\nfive, and dinner at seven or eight, while the children dine at noon and\r\nsup at six. This arrangement was adopted in Rock Park. My father used to\r\nleave home for the consulate at nine, and return--unless kept away by an\r\nofficial or social engagement--at five or six. There was appointed\r\nfor us children a nurse or governess, to oversee and administer our\r\nsupplies; our father and mother dining, with such guests as might happen\r\nto be present, late in the evening. We were sometimes allowed to come in\r\nat dessert, to eat a few nuts and raisins and exhibit our infantile good\r\nmanners. This domestic separation was a matter of much speculation and\r\ncuriosity to our immature minds; we used to haunt the hall through which\r\nthe servants carried the dishes, smoking and fragrant, from the kitchen\r\nto the dining-room, and once in a while the too-indulgent creatures\r\nwould allow us to steal something. How ravishingly delicious things thus\r\nacquired taste! And we, fancying, of course, that they must be not less\r\ndelicious for the folks at table, used to marvel how they could ever\r\nbear to leave off eating. The dinners were certainly rather elaborate\r\ncompared with the archaic repasts of Salem or of Concord; but they were\r\nas far inferior in grandeur and interminableness to the astonishing\r\nbanquets at which, in some great houses, our father and mother were\r\npresent. Consider, for example, this dinner, in no way remarkable among\r\nsuch functions, at the Hollands's, about this time. There were twelve\r\npersons at table. The service was of solid silver; two enormous covers\r\nwere on the table before the soup was served; being removed, they\r\nrevealed turbot and fried fish. Then followed boiled turkey and\r\nroast goose, and between them innumerable smaller dishes, including\r\nchicken-pies, ragouts, cutlets, fricasees, tongue, and ham, all being\r\nplaced in their silver receptacles on the table; on the sideboard was\r\na vast round of boiled beef, as a precaution against famine. With the\r\nsweets were served grouse and pheasants; there were five kinds of wine,\r\nnot including the champagne, which was consumed as a collateral all\r\nthe way along. The pudding which followed these trifles was an heroic\r\ncompound, which Gargantua might have flinched from; then came the nuts\r\nand raisins, then the coffee, then the whiskey and brandy. There were\r\npeople in England, half a century ago, who ate this sort of dinners six\r\nor seven times a week, and thought nothing of it. They actually ate and\r\ndrank them--did not merely glance at them and shake their heads. The\r\nancient Scandinavians, Gauls, Saxons, and Normans, of whom they were\r\ndescendants, could not have done more. One cannot help respecting such\r\nprodigious trencher-men and women, or wonder that the poverty-stricken\r\nclass were ill-fed. Dinner in England had become a very different thing\r\nwhen I lived there twenty years later, and though port and Madeira were\r\ngenerally on the table, the only man whom I saw habitually drink them\r\nwas Robert Browning! Possibly this is the reason the British got such a\r\nthrashing in South Africa the other day.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner at Rock Park--or, if it were to be a late affair,\r\nbefore--we would have family prayers, in which the servants joined. This\r\nwas in deference to English custom; not that we were irreligious, but we\r\nhad not before been accustomed to express our religious feelings in just\r\nthat manner. All being grouped in a semicircle, my father would open the\r\nBible and read a chapter; then he would take a prayer-book containing\r\nthirty or forty well-considered addresses to the Almighty, and everybody\r\nwould kneel down and cover their eyes with their hands. The \"Amen\"\r\nhaving been reached, and echoed by every one, all would rise to their\r\nformer positions, and the servants would file out of the room. It\r\nmust have been somewhat of an effort for my father to go through\r\nthis ceremony; but I think he did it, not only for the reason above\r\nmentioned, but also because he thought it right that his children\r\nshould have the opportunity of gaining whatever religious sentiment such\r\nproceedings might inculcate. But I do not think that he had much faith\r\nin the practice as an English institution. Indeed, he has somewhere\r\nwritten that the English \"bring themselves no nearer to God when they\r\npray than when they play cards.\"\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: ROBERT BROWNING]\r\n\r\nI understood long afterwards, as I did not at the time, how closely my\r\nfather and mother studied in all things the welfare and cultivation of\r\ntheir children. They were not formal or oppressive about it; all went\r\npleasantly and with seeming spontaneity, as if in accordance with our\r\nown desire; but we were wisely and needfully guided. We were never sent\r\nto school during our seven years in Europe; but either we were taught\r\nour lessons by our parents at home or by governesses. In addition to the\r\nconstant walks which I took with my father, he encouraged me to join\r\na cricket club in the Park, and sent me to Huguenin's gymnasium in\r\nLiverpool, to the Cornwallis swimming-baths, and to a dancing-academy\r\nkept by a highly ornamental Frenchman, and he bought me an enormous\r\nsteel hoop, and set me racing after it at headlong speed. Nor did he\r\nneglect to stimulate us in the imaginative and aesthetic side. From the\r\ndate of our settlement in England to the end of his life, he read aloud\r\nto us in the evenings many of the classics of literature. Spenser's The\r\nFaerie Queene, the Don Quixote of Cervantes, the poems and novels of\r\nScott, Grimm's and Andersen's Fairy Tales, much of Defoe and Swift,\r\nGoldsmith's Vicar of Wake field, Coleridge's Ancient Mariner (he\r\nhimself was very fond of that poem), and many other things, and I cannot\r\noverestimate the good they did me. His talks to me during our walks\r\ngave me, under the guise of pleasantry, not so much specific information\r\nconcerning things (though that was not wanting), but--character; that\r\nis, the questions he put to me, the remarks and comments he made, the\r\nstories he told, were all calculated to give me a high idea of human\r\nduties and aspirations; to encourage generosity, charity, courage,\r\npatriotism, and independence. From the reading of The Faerie Queene and\r\nof Don Quixote I conceived a vehement infatuation for mediaeval chivalry\r\nand knight-errantry; I adopted the motto of the order, \"Be faithful,\r\nbrave, and true in deed and word\"; and I indulged in waking dreams of\r\nheroic adventures in quest of fair renown, and to succor the oppressed.\r\nAll this he encouraged and abetted, though always, too, with a sort\r\nof twinkle of the eye, lest I should take myself too seriously and wax\r\npriggish. He permitted me to have a breastplate and a helmet with a\r\ngolden dragon crest (made by our nurse out of pasteboard covered with\r\ntinsel-paper), and he bought me a real steel sword with a brass hilt\r\nwrought in open-work; I used to spend hours polishing it, and picturing\r\nto myself the giants and ogres I would slay with it. Finally--with that\r\nhumorous arching of the eyebrow of his--he bade me kneel down, and with\r\nmy sword smote me on the shoulder, and dubbed me knight, saying, \"Rise\r\nup, Sir Julian!\" It was worth many set moral homilies to me. He knew the\r\nadvantage of leading a boy to regard the practice of boyish and manly\r\nvirtues not as a burden but as a privilege and boon, and of making\r\nthe boy's own conscience his judge. His handling of the matter was,\r\nof course, modified so as to reach the inner springs of my particular\r\nnature and temperament, which he thoroughly understood. Withal, he\r\nnever failed to hold up to ridicule anything showing a tendency to the\r\nsentimental; he would test me on this point in various ways, and always\r\nbetrayed pleasure when he found me quick to detect the sentimental or\r\nmawkish taint in literature or life. I breathed a manly, robust, and\r\nbracing atmosphere in his company, and when I reflect upon what were\r\nmy proclivities to folly during this impressionable period, I thank my\r\nstars for such a father.\r\n\r\nThere was abundant quiet and seclusion in Rock Park, and had my father\r\nbeen able to do any writing, he could hardly have found a retreat more\r\nsuitable. The tradesmen called early at the houses in the Park, their\r\nwagon-wheels making no sound upon the unpaved street, and the two\r\npolicemen, who lived in the stone lodges, kept the place free from\r\nbeggars and peddlers. These policemen, pacing slowly along in their\r\nuniforms, rigid and dignified, had quite an imposing aspect, and it was\r\nsome time before we children discovered that they were only men, after\r\nall. Each had a wife and children, who filled to overflowing the tiny\r\nhabitations; when their blue coats and steel-framed hats were off, they\r\nwere quite humble persons; one of them eked out his official salary by\r\nmending shoes. After following with awe the progress along the sidewalk\r\nof the officer of public order, stalking with solemn and measured gait,\r\nand touching his hat, with a hand encased in a snow-white cotton glove,\r\nto such of the denizens of the Park as he might encounter, it was\r\nquite like a fairy-tale transformation to see him squatting in soiled\r\nshirt-sleeves on his cobbler's bench, drawing waxed thread through holes\r\nin a boot-sole. I once saw one of them, of a Sunday afternoon, standing\r\nat ease in the doorway of his lodge, clad in an old sack-coat which I\r\nrecognized as having been my father's. I am constitutionally reverent\r\nof law and order; but the revelation of the domestic lives of these\r\npolicemen gave me an insight, which I have never since lost, into the\r\nprofound truth that the man and the officer are twain.\r\n\r\nThere were perhaps twenty families living in the Park, of whom we became\r\nacquainted with two only; the people who lived next door to us (whose\r\nname I have forgotten), and Mr. and Mrs. Squarey, who dwelt higher up\r\nthe street. The people next door had two boys of about my own age, with\r\nwhom I played cricket, and it was from the back windows of their house\r\nthat I saw for the first time an exhibition of fireworks in their\r\ngarden; I remember that when, just before the show began, they put out\r\nthe lamp in the room, I asked to have it relighted, in order that\r\nI might see the as yet unexperienced wonder. There are folks who go\r\nhunting for the sun with a lantern.\r\n\r\nMr. Squarey was tall and stiff of figure, with a singularly square\r\ncountenance, with a short whisker on each side of it; but spiritually he\r\nwas most affable and obliging; so was his wife; but as she was short and\r\nglobular, my father was wont to refer to her, in the privacy of domestic\r\nintercourse, as Mrs. Roundey. They were profuse in invitations to go\r\nwith us to places--to Chester, to the Welsh show-places, and so forth;\r\nand although I think my father and mother would rather have gone alone,\r\nthey felt constrained to accept these suggestions. It was in their\r\ncompany, at all events, that I first saw Chester \"Rows\"; and also,\r\nfrom some coign of vantage on those delightful old walls, an English\r\nhorse-race, with jockeys in silk caps and jackets tinted like the\r\nrainbow. Mr. Squarey's demeanor towards my sisters and myself was\r\nlike that of the benevolent tutor in Sandford and Merton, with which\r\nexcellent work we were very conversant at that time; as, likewise, with\r\nEdgeworth's Parents' Assistant, and with still another engaging volume\r\ncalled, I think, the Budget of something; at any rate, it had two or\r\nthree little boys and girls in it, who were anxious to acquire useful\r\nand curious information on many subjects, which was afforded them\r\nin generous measure by their highly cultivated elders. Such\r\nflower-garlanded instruction was the best specifically juvenile\r\nliterature which those primitive ages afforded. \"Pray, mamma, why does\r\nthe sun rise in the east instead of in the west?\" \"Pray, papa, why was\r\nKing Alfred called 'The Good'?\" Mrs. Markham's History of England was\r\nconstructed upon the same artless principle. What a distance we have\r\ntravelled since then!\r\n\r\nBut it was a good and happy life in Rock Park, and I think our father\r\nand mother enjoyed it almost as much as we children did. They were\r\nmeeting people many of whom were delightful--I shall try to paint the\r\nportraits of some of them in the next chapter--and they were seeing\r\ntowns and castles and places of historic and picturesque interest; and\r\nmy father was earning more money than ever before, though less than a\r\nquarter as much as he would have earned had not Congress, soon after his\r\naccession to office, cut down the emoluments. This was England; the\r\nOld Home, and the Old World, for the understanding of which they had\r\nprepared themselves all their lives previous. My father once said, \"If\r\nEngland were all the world, it would still have been worth while for the\r\nCreator to have made it.\" The children were radiantly content with their\r\nlot; and it is on record that the little boy once remarked, \"I don't\r\nremember when I came down from heaven; but I'm glad I happened to\r\ntumble into so good a family.\" The same individual, rolling on the\r\nfloor in excess of mirth over some childish comicality, panted out, \"Oh,\r\nmamma, my ball of jolly is so big I can't breathe!\" The ball of jolly\r\nbecame a household word for years thereafter. It was well nourished in\r\nthose days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n     Cataclysmic adventures--On the trail of dazzling fortunes--\r\n     \"Lovely, but reprehensible Madham\"--The throne saves the\r\n     artist--English robin redbreast--A sad and weary old man--\r\n     \"Most indelicate woman I've ever known\"--Perfectly chaste--\r\n     Something human stirred dimly--\"She loves me; she loves\r\n     me!\"--The Prince of Wales and half-a-crown--Portentous and\r\n     thundering title--Honest English simplicity--\"The spirit\r\n     lacking\"--Abelard, Isaac Newton, and Ruskin--A famous and\r\n     charming woman of genius--Deep and wide well of human\r\n     sympathy--The whooping-cough.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1854 we were visited by John O'Sullivan, his wife and\r\nmother, and a young relative of theirs, Miss Ella Rogers. O'Sullivan\r\nhad been appointed Minister to the Court of Portugal, and was on his way\r\nthither. He was a Democrat of old standing; had edited the Democratic\r\nReview in 1837, and had made my father's acquaintance at that time\r\nthrough soliciting contributions from him; later they became close\r\nfriends, and when my sister Una was born, he sent her a silver cup,\r\nand was ever after called \"Uncle John\" in the family, and, also,\r\noccasionally, \"the Count\"--a title which, I believe, had some warrant in\r\nhis ancestry. For, although an American, Uncle John was born at sea\r\noff the coast of Spain, of an Irish father and a mother of aristocratic\r\nconnections or extraction (I am a little uncertain, I find, on this\r\npoint); I think her parents were Italian. Uncle John had all the\r\ncharming qualities of the nations mentioned, and none of their\r\nobjectionable ones; though this is not to say that he was devoid of\r\ntender faults, which were, if anything, more lovable than his virtues.\r\nBeneath a tranquil, comely, and gentle exterior burned all the fire\r\nand romance of the Celt; his faith and enthusiasm in \"projects\" knew no\r\nbounds; he might be deceived and bankrupted a hundred times, and\r\nwould toe the mark the next time with undiminished confidence. He was\r\ncontinually, and in the quietest way, having the most astonishing and\r\ncataclysmic adventures; he would be blown up, as it were, by a dynamite\r\nexplosion, and presently would return from the sky undisturbed, with\r\nonly a slight additional sparkle in his soft eyes, and with the lock of\r\nhair that fell gracefully over his forehead only a trifle disordered.\r\nThe most courteous and affectionate of men, with the most yielding and\r\nself-effacing manners, he had the spirit of a paladin, and was afraid of\r\nnothing. He would empty his pockets--or if, as too often happened, they\r\nwere already empty, he would pledge his credit to help a friend out of\r\na hole; and, on the other hand, he was always hot upon the trail of\r\na dazzling fortune, which, like Emerson's Forerunners, never was\r\novertaken. It would not long have availed him, had it been otherwise,\r\nfor never was there a Monte Cristo who lavished wealth as O'Sullivan\r\nhabitually did in anticipation, and would undoubtedly have done in\r\nfact had the opportunity been afforded him. He was gifted with a low,\r\nmelodious, exquisitely modulated voice, and a most engaging and winning\r\nmanner, and when he set out to picture the simple and easy methods\r\nwhereby he proposed to make millions, it was next to impossible to\r\nresist him. He was like a beautiful, innocent, brilliant child, grown\r\nup, endowed with an enchanter's wand, which was forever promising all\r\nthe kingdoms of the earth to him, but never (as our modern phrase is)\r\ndelivered the goods. He regarded my father as a king of men, and he had,\r\ntimes without number, been on the very edge of making him, as well as\r\nhimself, a multifold millionaire. However, President Pierce did what he\r\ncould for him by giving him the Portuguese mission (after first offering\r\nit to my father), and O'Sullivan did excellent work there. But he became\r\ninterested--abstractly--in some copper-mines in Spain, which, as he\r\nclearly demonstrated, could be bought for a song, and would pay a\r\nthousand per cent, from the start. Partly to gratify him, and partly\r\nwith the hope of at least getting his money back, my father finally, in\r\n1858 or 1859, advanced him ten thousand dollars to finance the scheme. I\r\nsaw the dear old gentleman, a generation later, in New York; he had the\r\nsame clear, untroubled, tranquil face as of old; his hair, though\r\ngray, was as thick and graceful as ever; his manner was as sweet and\r\nattractive; but though, in addition to his other accomplishments, he had\r\nbecome an advanced spiritualist, he had not yet coined into bullion his\r\ngolden imagination. He had forgotten the Spanish copper-mines, and I\r\ntook care not to remind him of them. Peace to his generous, ardent, and\r\nloving soul!\r\n\r\nUncle John's wife was a good mate for him, in her own way as brilliant\r\nand fascinating as he and with an unalterable belief in her husband's\r\ndestiny. She was a tall, slender woman, with kindling eyes, a lovely\r\nsmile, and a wonderful richness and vivacity of conversation; nor have\r\nI ever since known so truly witty a woman. But she lacked the delightful\r\nmellowness and tenderness for which Uncle John was so remarkable.\r\nThe mother, Madame O'Sullivan, as she was called, was a type of the\r\nfinegrained, gently bred aristocrat, every outline softened and made\r\ngracious by the long lapse of years through which she had lived. She sat\r\nlike a picture of reverend but still animated age, with white, delicate\r\nlace about her pale cheeks and dark, kindly, weary eyes, and making a\r\nfrost-work over her silvery hair. As for Miss Ella Rogers, it is with\r\nsome embarrassment that I refer to her; inasmuch as I fell violently in\r\nlove with her at first sight, and I have reason to think that she never\r\nfully appreciated or adequately responded to my passion, though, at the\r\ntime, I was nearly one-third of her age--she being five-and-twenty. She\r\nwas a dark and lively beauty, thoroughly self-possessed, and versed in\r\nsocial accomplishments, and gifted with dramatic talent. She afterwards\r\nmade a great impression in the court of the Portuguese monarch, and more\r\nthan once the King himself chose her as his partner in the ball. Reports\r\nof these gayeties came to my ears; and I found the other day part of\r\na letter which I addressed to her, remonstrating against these royal\r\nflirtations. It is written in pencil, upon the blue office-paper of\r\nthe consulate, and I can recall distinctly the small, indignant boy and\r\nknight-errant, sitting at the desk opposite his hugely diverted father,\r\nand beginning his epistle thus: \"Lovely, but reprehensible Madham!\"\r\nI suspect that I consulted my father as to the spelling of the second\r\nadjective, for it shows signs of having been overhauled; but after that\r\nmy feelings became too strong for me, and the remainder of the letter is\r\northographically so eccentric that it was probably cast aside and a copy\r\nmade of it. But the rough draught, by some inconceivable chance, was\r\nkept, and turns up now, after half a century, with a strange thread of\r\npathos woven by time into the texture of its absurdity. Poor, little,\r\nlovely reprehensible Madham! Her after-career was not a happy one.\r\n\r\nThese agreeable persons filled our stuccoed villa full, and gave\r\npoignant addition to the quiet, gray beauty of that English spring. A\r\nyear or so later, when my mother's health compelled her to escape to a\r\nwarmer climate from fog-ridden Liverpool, she went with my sisters to\r\nLisbon, where the O'Sullivans were by that time established, and spent\r\nseveral months with them, and saw all the splendors of the naive but\r\nbrilliant little court of Dom Pedro V. She brought home a portfolio\r\nof etchings presented to her, and done by his youthful Majesty; which\r\nindicate that his throne, little as he cared for it, preserved him from\r\nthe mortification of failing as an artist.\r\n\r\nEarly in the winter of the following year (1855), Mr. James Buchanan,\r\nappointed Minister to the Court of St. James, found his way to my\r\nfather's retreat in Rock Park. The English winter was a mild affair\r\ncompared with our recent experiences of the arctic snows of Lenox; there\r\nwas no coasting, and not much snow-balling; but we had the pleasure of\r\nmaking friends with the English robin-redbreast, a most lovable little\r\ncreature, who, every morning, hopped confidingly on our window-sill and\r\ntook bread-crumbs almost from our hands. The old American diplomatist\r\nand President that was to be (though he vehemently disclaimed any such\r\npossibility) distracted our attention from robin for a day or two.\r\nHe had the aspect, perhaps cultivated for political and democratic\r\npurposes, of a Pennsylvania farmer; he was, I believe, born on a farm in\r\nFranklin County, in that State, at the beginning of the last decade of\r\nthe eighteenth century. He was tall and ungainly in figure, though he\r\nbore himself with a certain security and dignity; his head was high\r\nand thinly covered with gray hair; he carried it oddly, a little on\r\none side; it was said at the time that this was due to his having once\r\nattempted suicide by cutting his throat. His visage--heavy, long, and\r\nnoticeable--had the typical traits of the American politician of that\r\nepoch; his eyes were small, shrewd, and twinkling; there was a sort of\r\nprofessional candor in his bearing, but he looked like a sad and weary\r\nold man. He talked somewhat volubly to my father, who kept him going by\r\na question now and then, as his way generally was with visitors. There\r\nwas a flavor of rusticity in his speech; he was not a man of culture or\r\npolish, though unquestionably of great experience of the world. He was\r\ndressed in a wide-skirted coat of black broadcloth, and wore a white\r\nchoker put on a little askew. The English, who were prone to be critical\r\nof our representatives, made a good deal of fun of Mr. Buchanan, and\r\ntold anecdotes about him which were probably exaggerated or apocryphal.\r\nIt was alleged, for example, that, speaking of the indisposition of a\r\nfemale relative of his, he had observed that it was due to the severity\r\nof the English climate. \"She never enjoyed delicate health at home,\" he\r\nhad declared; \"in fact, she was always one of the most indelicate women\r\nI've ever known.\" And it was asserted that he had been admonished by\r\nthe Lord High Chamberlain, or by the Gold Stick-in-Waiting, for\r\nexpectorating upon the floor of her Majesty's palace at a levee. Such\r\nribaldries used to be popular in English mouths concerning American\r\nvisitors before the war; they were all of similar tenor. Mrs. Abbott\r\nLawrence was described as having bought a handsome shawl at a shop\r\non Lord Street, in Liverpool, and to have walked down that populous\r\nthoroughfare with her new purchase on her shoulders, ignorant that\r\nit bore the legend, inscribed on a white card, which the salesman had\r\nneglected to remove, \"Perfectly chaste.\" The same lady was reported as\r\nsaying, in asking an invitation to a ball on behalf of Mrs. Augustus\r\nPeabody, of Boston, \"I assure you, on our side of the water, Mrs.\r\nPeabody is much more accustomed to grant favors than to ask them.\" Such\r\nanecdotes seem to bear upon them the stamp of the British manufacturer.\r\nThere would not seem to be much harm in them, yet it is such things\r\nthat sometimes interfere most acutely with the entente cordials between\r\nnations. We had another glimpse of Mr. Buchanan, in London, about a year\r\nlater, and he then remarked to my mother, indirectly referring to such\r\nreports, that the Queen had treated him very kindly. For the present, he\r\nfaded from the Rock Park horizon, and we returned to the robin; nor have\r\nI been able to understand how it happened that he made so distinct an\r\nimpression upon my memory. But a child's memory is unaccountable, both\r\nin what it loses and in what it retains.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Sunday forenoon, when it was not too cold for the young folks to\r\nbe swinging on that gate which has been mentioned, and the elders were\r\nin-doors, enjoying the holiday in their own way, we descried an old\r\ngentleman approaching up the winding street. As he drew nearer he\r\npresented rather a shabby, or, at least, rusty appearance. His felt hat\r\nwas not so black as it had been; his coat was creased and soiled; his\r\nboots needed a blacking. He swung a cane as he stumped along, and there\r\nwas a sort of faded smartness in his bearing and a knowingness in\r\nhis grim old visage, indicating some incongruous familiarity with the\r\nmanners of the great world. He came to a halt in front of the house,\r\nand, after quizzing it for a moment, went up the steps and beat a\r\nfashionable tattoo with the knocker.\r\n\r\nSummoned in-doors soon afterwards, we found this questionable personage\r\nsitting in the drawing-room. His voice was husky, but modulated to the\r\ninflections of polite breeding; he used a good many small gestures, and\r\ngrinned often, revealing the yellow remains of his ancient teeth; he\r\nlaughed, too, with a hoarse sound in his throat. There was about him\r\nan air of determined cheerfulness and affability, though between the\r\nefforts the light died down in his wrinkled old eyes and the lines of\r\nhis face sagged and deepened. He offered to kiss my sisters, but they\r\ndrew back; he took my hand in his own large, dry one with its ragged\r\nnails and swollen joints. At length he inveigled my younger sister to\r\nhis knee, where she sat gazing unflinchingly and solemnly into him with\r\nthat persistence which characterizes little girls of four or five who\r\nare not quite sure of their ground. Her smooth, pink-and-white cheeks\r\nand unwinking eyes contrasted vividly with his seamed yellowness and\r\nblinking grin; for a long time he coquetted at her, and played peep-bo,\r\nwithout disturbing her gravity, making humorous side comments to the\r\non-lookers meanwhile. There was a ragged and disorderly mop of gray\r\nhair on his head, which showed very dingy beside the clear auburn of\r\nthe child's. One felt a repulsion from him, and yet, as he chatted and\r\nsmirked and acted, there was a sort of fascination in him, too. Some\r\noriginal force and fire of nature still glowed and flickered in his\r\nold carcass; something human stirred dimly under the crust of\r\nself-consciousness and artificiality. Rose's adamantine seriousness\r\nfinally relaxed in a faint smile, upon which he threw up his hands,\r\nemitted a hoarse cackle of triumph, and exclaimed, \"There--there it is!\r\nI knew I'd get it; she loves me--she loves me!\" He then permitted her to\r\nslip down from his knee and withdraw to her mother, and resumed the talk\r\nwhich our entrance had interrupted. It was chiefly about people of whom\r\nwe youngsters knew nothing--though our ignorance only argued ourselves\r\nunknown, for he named persons all famous in their day. He had seen\r\nGeorge IV., Napoleon, Talleyrand, Wellington; he had been intimate with\r\nColeridge, De Quincey, Wordsworth, Lamb, Monk Lewis; he was a sort of\r\nelder brother or deputy uncle to Tennyson, Browning, Dickens; he\r\nhad quaffed mountain-dew with Walter Scott and had tramped the moors\r\nshoulder to shoulder with Kit North; the courts of Europe were his\r\nfamiliar stamping-grounds; he had the nobility and gentry at his\r\nfinger-ends; he was privileged, petted, and sought after everywhere; if\r\nthere were any august door we wished to enter, any high-placed personage\r\nwe desired to approach, any difficult service we wanted rendered, he was\r\nthe man to help us to our object. Who, then, was he? He has long been\r\nutterly forgotten; but he was well known, or notorious, during the first\r\nhalf of the last century; he was such a character as could flourish only\r\nin England. His name was William Jerdan; he was born in 1785, and was\r\nnow, therefore, about seventy years old. He had started in life\r\npoor, with no family distinction, but with some more or less useful\r\nconnections either on the father's or the mother's side. He had somehow\r\ngot an English education, and he had pursued his career on the basis of\r\nhis native wits, his indomitable effrontery and persistence, his\r\nfaculty of familiarity, his indifference to rebuffs, his lack of shame,\r\nconscience, and morality. How he found the means to live nobody could\r\ntell, but he uniformly lived well and had enjoyed the good things of the\r\nworld. After maintaining his ground during the first twenty or thirty\r\nyears, it had probably been easier for him to forge along afterwards,\r\nfor he could impose upon the new generation with his stories of success\r\nin the former one. Uncouth and ugly though he was by nature, the\r\nexternal polish and trick of good form which he had acquired, and, no\r\ndoubt, some inner force of social genius in him, had influenced men\r\nto tolerate and often to like him, and had given him extraordinary\r\ngood-fortune with women. He had not only been twice married, and had\r\nmany children born in wedlock, but his intrigues and liaisons had been\r\ninnumerable, and they had by no means been confined to the lower ranks\r\nof society. That he was a practised liar there can be no doubt, but he\r\nhad the long memory which the proverb recommends to liars, and he was\r\nso circumspect that few of his claims and pretensions lacked solid basis\r\nenough to make them pass current in a hurrying and heedless world. Now,\r\nhowever, in his age, he was wellnigh at the end of his tether; what we\r\nshould call his \"pull\" was losing its efficiency; he was lapsing to the\r\ncondition where he would offer to introduce a man to the Prince of Wales\r\nor to Baron Rothschild, and then ask him for the loan of five pounds--or\r\nhalf a crown, as the case might be. He was a character for Thackeray. He\r\nhaunted my father for a year or two more, and then vanished I know not\r\nwhere.\r\n\r\nPoor, dingy old Jerdan purported to be himself a literary man,\r\nthough the only thing of his that I ever heard of was a work in\r\nfour pretentious volumes of \"wretched twaddle\"--as my father called\r\nthem--which he published under the title of My Autobiography. It\r\ncontained a long array of renowned names, with passages appended of\r\nperfectly empty and conventional comment.\r\n\r\nBut other men crossed our path who had much sounder claims to renown in\r\nliterature; among them Samuel Warren, author of half a dozen books, two\r\nof which are still sometimes heard of--_The Diary of a Late Physician_\r\nand _Ten Thousand a Year_. He lived upon the reputation which these\r\nbrought him, though they were published, the first as long ago as 1830\r\nand the other only ten years later. Like many other authors, he fancied\r\nhimself capable of things far better than belonged to his true metier;\r\nand among the books in my father's library is one called _The Moral and\r\nIntellectual Development of the Present Age_--a thin volume, despite\r\nits portentous and thundering title--it carries the gloss, in Warren's\r\nhandwriting, \"the fruit of many a long year's reflection.\" So does every\r\nlight comedian imagine that he can play Hamlet. Of Warren himself I\r\nbarely recall a slight, light figure with a sharp nose and a manner\r\nlacking in repose; indeed, he was very much like a light comedian in\r\nlight comedy, eager to hold the centre of the stage, full of small\r\nmovements and remarks, and--which more interested us children--with\r\na gift for turning himself into other people by slight contortions\r\nof countenance and alterations of voice. The histrionic abilities of\r\nDickens probably affected the social antics of many writers at this\r\nepoch. Warren also told stories in a vivacious and engaging manner,\r\nthough, as they were about things and people out of the sphere of his\r\nyounger auditors, I remember only the way of the telling, not what was\r\ntold. I recalled, later, his anecdotes of Kit North, who was a friend of\r\nhis, on account of the contrast between the stalwart proportions of that\r\nold worthy and the diminutive physique of the novelist; they must have\r\nlooked, together, like a bear and a monkey. Warren was born in Wales,\r\nthough whether of Welsh ancestry I know not.\r\n\r\nWhen we saw him he was only a trifle over five-and-forty years of age,\r\nso his famous books must have been written when he was hardly more than\r\na boy.\r\n\r\nAs for Layard, eminent in his time for his work in Nineveh and Babylon,\r\nand afterwards as a statesman, he did not, I think, come to Rock Park,\r\nnor am I sure that I ever saw him. And yet it seems to me that I have\r\nthe picture in my mind of a vigorous, frank, agreeable personage who\r\nwas he; not a large man, still less a handsome one, but full of life,\r\nmanliness, and honest English simplicity. He was at this time, like so\r\nmany of his countrymen, very anxious concerning the Crimean War, then in\r\nits first stages, and vehemently opposed to the policy which had brought\r\nit about, for, up to that time, England and Russia had been on friendly\r\nterms, and Layard could see no promising or useful future for the\r\nTurk. My father shared his views, and he wrote the following passage\r\nin commenting upon the general European situation of that day and the\r\nprospects for England. It has never been printed, because it stood only\r\nfor the sentiment of the moment, but may be opportunely quoted now that\r\nthe aspect of European politics shows symptoms of soon undergoing vital\r\nchanges. \"The truth is,\" wrote my father, \"there is a spirit lacking in\r\nEngland which we in America do not lack; and for the want of it she will\r\nhave to resign a foremost position among the nations, even if there\r\nwere not enough other circumstances to compel her to do so. Her good\r\nqualities are getting out of date; at all events, there should be\r\nsomething added to them in the present stage of the world.\" England has\r\na good deal changed since those words were written, and the changes have\r\nprobably been mainly for the better, though all the important ones have\r\ncaused our old mother discomfort and embarrassment. The medicine of\r\na new age, the subtle infiltration of anti-insular ideas, the slow\r\nemergence of the democracy have given her many qualms, but they are\r\nwholesome ones. Her best and most cultivated minds are now on the side\r\nof progress, instead of holding by the past, and, should the pinch come,\r\nthese may avail to save her better than martinet generals or unwieldy\r\nfleets. The \"spirit lacking\" in her in 1855 may, perhaps, be found in\r\nthem. Whether the spirit in question be as conspicuous with us as it\r\nused to be is another matter.\r\n\r\nHenry Bright was still our most frequent visitor, and he brought us the\r\nnews and gossip of the world. It was in 1855 that Millais married the\r\nlady who had been Mrs. Ruskin. English society was much fluttered\r\nby this event, and many of Ruskin's friends cut him for a time in\r\nconsequence of it. Ruskin was a man of a rare type, not readily\r\nunderstood in England, where a man is expected, in the fundamental\r\nqualities of his nature at least, to be like everybody else. There are\r\ntwo noted characters in history with whom, in some respects, he might be\r\ncompared, Isaac Newton being one and Abelard the other. All three were\r\nmen in whom, owing to causes either natural or accidental, the intellect\r\nwas able to absorb all the energies of the nature. The intellect thus\r\nacquired extraordinary power and brilliance, and appropriated to itself,\r\nin a sort of image, as it were, the qualities which no longer possessed\r\nmanifestation on the material plane. Nothing out of the way would,\r\ntherefore, be noticed, unless or until some combination of circumstances\r\nshould bring the exceptional condition into every-day light. This\r\nhappened with Ruskin, and he was, of course, unable to regard the\r\nmatter in the same light as his critics did. He viewed his wife's\r\ndisinclination towards him by the light of mere cold logic; and the\r\nreason his friends were alienated from him was, not that her grounds\r\nof objection to him were justifiable, but that Ruskin (according to the\r\ncommon report of the time, as quoted by Mr. Bright) did not see why he\r\nand she and Millais should discontinue their life in common as before.\r\nNeither Millais nor Mrs. Ruskin would, of course, accede to this\r\nproposition, and the divorce was accordingly obtained. Ruskin intended\r\nsimply to show magnanimity, and in the course of years this was\r\nrecognized and he was forgiven, just as we forgive a person for being\r\ncolor-blind. In our present stage of civilization we must, in certain\r\nmatters, follow strict convention on peril of ostracism, and nothing\r\nis less readily condoned in a man's conduct than any suspicion of\r\ncomplaisance. I did not see either Ruskin or Millais until 1879 or 1880,\r\nof which beholding I will speak when the time comes.\r\n\r\nBut we had with us for a short time a famous and charming woman of\r\ngenius, who made me for a season forget my infatuation for the beautiful\r\nElla Rogers. This was Charlotte Cushman. The acquaintance then begun was\r\nrenewed in Italy, and maintained till the end of her life. Such is the\r\npower of the spiritual in nature and character to dominate and even\r\nrender invisible the physical, that I was astonished, in after years, to\r\nhear Charlotte referred to as a woman of plain or unattractive features.\r\nTo me, won from the first by the expression, the voice, the sphere, the\r\nwarmth, strength, and nobility of her presence, she had always seemed\r\none of the handsomest as well as most delightful of women. She was in\r\nher fortieth year, but she had already announced her purpose of retiring\r\nfrom the stage. Some of her best work was done in the following twenty\r\nyears. Critics might call her face plain, or ugly, if they chose, but\r\nthere was no doubt that its range of expression was vast and poignant,\r\nthat it could reflect with immense energy the thoughts of the mind, and\r\ncould radiate the very soul of tragedy. Her figure was tall and superb\r\nand her carriage stately without any stiffness, and appalling though she\r\nwas as Lady Macbeth or Meg Merrilies, in our little drawing-room she was\r\nonly simple, sincere, gentle, and winning. Born actress though she was,\r\nher horizon was by no means restricted to things histrionic; she talked\r\nwell on many subjects, and was at no loss for means to entertain even so\r\nsmall and inexperienced a person as myself. I had never seen a theatre,\r\nand did not know what an actress was, but I loved her, and she was good\r\nto me. It was not the interest of the stories she told me, so much as\r\nthe personal influence that went with them, that entranced me. I was\r\nsensible of her kindness, and of the hearty good-will with which she\r\nbent her great and gracious self to the task of making me happy. That\r\nwonderful array of tiny charms on her watch-chain was beautiful and\r\nabsorbing, owing less to anything intrinsic in themselves than to some\r\nsparkling and lovable communication from their wearer. If a woman be\r\nonly large enough and vigorous enough to begin with, the stage seems to\r\ndevelop her as nothing else could--to bring out the best in her. It was\r\nperhaps the deep and wide well of human sympathy in Charlotte Cushman\r\nthat was at the bottom of her success in her profession, though, of\r\ncourse, she was greatly aided by her mental and physical gifts. I\r\nsuppose there may be women now capable of being actresses as great as\r\nshe was, but the audience to call forth their latent powers and ambition\r\nseems, just at present, to be lacking.\r\n\r\nOur social diversions at Rock Park were interrupted, at about this\r\nperiod, by the whooping-cough, which seized upon all of us together,\r\nand I well remember my father almost climbing up the wall of the room in\r\nsome of his paroxysms; but he treated it all as a joke, and was always\r\nready to laugh as soon as he got through coughing. It left no ill\r\neffects except upon my mother, who had bronchial trouble which, as I\r\nhave intimated, finally led to the breaking-up of our household. She was\r\nnot made for England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\n     Two New England consciences--Inexhaustible faith and energy--\r\n     Deep and abiding love of England--\"How the Water Comes Down\r\n     at Lodore\"--\"He took an' he let go\"--Naked mountains--The\r\n     unsentimental little quadruped--The human element in things\r\n     sticks--The coasts of England--A string of sleepy donkeys--\r\n     Unutterable boy-thoughts--Grins and chuckles like an ogress--\r\n     Hideous maternal parody--The adorable inverted bell-glass--\r\n     Strange things happen in the world--An ominous clouding of\r\n     the water--Something the world has never known--Overweening\r\n     security--An admonition not to climb too high--How vice may\r\n     become virtue by repetition--Corporal Blair's chest--Black-\r\n     Bottle Cardigan--Called to Lisbon.\r\n\r\nEmerson, as a matter of principle, was rather averse from travel, though\r\nhe made the trip to England twice; but he fortified his theory by his\r\npractice of searching out great men rather than historic or picturesque\r\nplaces. Ruskin's Modern Painters had not been written when Emerson first\r\nleft home, and I doubt if he read it at any time. He found his mountain\r\nscenery in Carlyle and his lakes and vales elsewhere among agreeable\r\npeople. My father's conscience worked in a different way; he thought\r\nhimself under obligations to see whatever in the way of towns, ruins,\r\ncathedrals, and scenery was accounted worthy a foreigner's attention;\r\nbut I think he would have enjoyed seeing them much more had that\r\nfeeling of obligation not been imposed upon him. Set sights, as he\r\noften remarked, wearied him, just because they were set; things that he\r\nhappened upon unpremeditatedly, especially if they were not described\r\nin guide-books, pleased him more and tired him less. It can hardly be\r\naffirmed, however, that he would have missed the set sights if he could\r\nhave done so, and no doubt he was glad, after the job was done, that he\r\nhad done it. And he was greatly helped along by the inexhaustible faith\r\nand energy in such matters of his wife; she shrank from no enterprise,\r\nand seemed always in precisely the right mood to appreciate whatever she\r\nbeheld. She could go day after day to a picture-gallery, and stay all\r\nday long; she would make herself as familiar with churches, castles, and\r\ncathedrals as she was with her own house; she would wander interminably\r\nand delightedly about old towns and cities, or gaze with never-waning\r\njoy upon lakes and mountains, and my father, accompanying her, was, in a\r\nmeasure, recuperated and strengthened by her enthusiasm. In the end, as\r\nis evidenced by Our Old Home and The Marble Faun, he got a good deal out\r\nof Europe. On the other hand, he seemed to think himself justified\r\nin avoiding persons as much as he decently might, even the most\r\ndistinguished; and if he had not been a consul, and a writer of books\r\nthat had been read, I doubt if he would have formed any acquaintances\r\nduring his foreign residence, and he would thereby have missed one of\r\nthe greatest and most enduring pleasures of memory that he took back\r\nwith him. For no one cared more for a friend, or was more stimulated and\r\nemancipated by one, than he. It may have been that he had passed the age\r\nof youthful buoyancy, of appetite for novelties; that he had begun to\r\nlack initiative. \"I have seen many specimens of mankind,\" he wrote down,\r\nin a mood of depression, in one of his note-books, \"but come to the\r\nconclusion that there is little variety among them all.\" That was\r\nscarcely a full thought, and he would never have let it pass in one\r\nof his considered books. He made and published many other remarks\r\non similar subjects of quite an opposite tenor, and these more truly\r\nrepresented his true feeling. But he did flag a little, once in a while,\r\nand the deep and abiding love of England which was his final sentiment\r\nhad somewhat the appearance of having been forced upon him against his\r\ninclination. We may surmise that he feared disappointment more than he\r\ncraved gratification.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: FRANCIS BANNOCH]\r\n\r\nFrom Liverpool we explored the strangeness of the land in all\r\ndirections. Bennoch or Bright sometimes took off my father alone;\r\nsometimes my father and mother would go with me, leaving my sisters at\r\nhome with the governess. Once in a while we all went together, as,\r\nfor example, to the Isle of Man or to Rhyl. So far as practicable, we\r\nchildren were made acquainted with the literature of places we were\r\nto visit before going there. Thus, before journeying to the Lakes and\r\nScotland, I had by heart a good deal of Wordsworth, Southey, Burns, and\r\nWalter Scott, and was able, standing amid the lovely uproar of Lodore,\r\nto shout out the story of how the water comes down there; and, again, on\r\nthe shores of Loch Katrine, at sunset, after spending a long hour on\r\nthe little white beach opposite Ellen's Isle, I ran along the road in\r\nadvance of my parents, and, climbing a cliff, saw the breadth of the\r\nlake below me, golden under the sunset clouds, and very aptly recited,\r\nas they came up, Sir Walter's descriptive verse:\r\n\r\n  \"One burnished sheet of living gold,\r\n  Loch Katrine lay, beneath him rolled!\"\r\n\r\nBut I was not always so well attuned to the environment. I had got hold\r\nof a hook and line at some hotel on the Lakes, and the old passion\r\nfor fishing, which had remained latent since Lenox days for lack of\r\nopportunity, returned upon me with great virulence. So, one day, when\r\nwe had set out in a row-boat to visit Rob Roy's cave, I requested, on\r\narriving there, to be permitted to stay in the boat, moored at the foot\r\nof the cliff, while the others climbed up into the cave, and, as soon as\r\nthey had disappeared, I pulled out my line, with a dried-up worm on the\r\nhook, and cast it over the side. I wanted to see the cave, but I wanted\r\nto catch a fish more. Up to that time, I think, I had caught nothing in\r\nall our pilgrimages. If ever Providence is going to give me success (I\r\nsaid to myself, devoutly), let it be now! Accordingly, just before the\r\nothers came back, I felt a strong pull on my line and hauled in amain.\r\nIn a moment the fish, which may have been nine inches long, but which\r\nseemed to me leviathan himself, broke the surface, wriggling this way\r\nand that vigorously; but that was the extent to which my prayer was\r\ngranted, for, in the words of a rustic fisherman who related his own\r\nexperience to me long afterwards, \"Just as I was a-goin' to land 'im,\r\nsir, he took an' he let go!\" My fish not only took and let go, but he\r\ncarried off the hook with him.\r\n\r\nI remember wandering with my father through a grassy old church-yard in\r\nsearch of Wordsworth's grave, which we found at last, looking quite\r\nas simple as his own most severely unadorned pastoral; but I had not\r\nattained as yet to the region of sentiment which makes such things\r\nimpressive. The bare mountains, the blue lakes, and the gray ruins\r\nfilled me with riotous intoxication. The North of England and Scotch\r\nmountains were much more effective in their nakedness than the wooded\r\nhills I had seen in Berkshire of Massachusetts, and their contours were\r\nmore sharply modelled and various. They were just large enough to make\r\ntheir ascent seem easy until you undertook it, then those seemingly\r\nmoderate slopes lengthened out unaccountably. The day we reached the\r\nhotel at the base of Helvellyn, I started, nothing doubting, to climb to\r\nits summit before supper; the weather was clear, the top looked close\r\nat hand, and I felt great surprise that the young gentleman mentioned in\r\nScott's poem (\"I climbed the dark brow of the mighty Helvellyn,\" etc.)\r\nshould have allowed himself to be lost. But after a breathless struggle\r\nof fifteen or twenty minutes, finding myself apparently no nearer my\r\ngoal than at first, I thought differently. Mr. Bright told my father,\r\nby-the-way, that the legend of the fidelity of the dead adventurer's\r\nlittle dog, \"who scared the hill-fox and the raven away,\" was far from\r\nbeing in accordance with the prosaic facts. This unsentimental little\r\nquadruped had, in truth, eaten up a large part of her master by the\r\ntime his remains were discovered, and had, furthermore, brought into the\r\nworld a litter of pups. Well, nothing can deprive us of the poem; but it\r\nis wholesome to face realities once in a while.\r\n\r\nUnless one have a vein of Ruskin in him, one does not recollect scenery,\r\nhowever enchanting, with the same particularity as persons. It is the\r\nhuman element in things that sticks to us. Scenes are more punctually\r\nrecalled in proportion as they are steeped in historic or personal\r\ninterest. The thatched cottages of Burns and of Shakespeare stand clear\r\nin my memory; I recall our ramble over the battlements of Carlisle,\r\nwhere imprisoned Queen Mary had walked three centuries before; I\r\nremember the dark stain on the floor of the dark room in which one of\r\nher lovers was slain; I can see the gray towers of Warwick rising above\r\nthe green trees and reflected in the still water; and, entering the keep\r\nof the castle, I behold myself again trying on the ponderous helmet of\r\nthe gigantic Guy, and climbing into his monstrous porridge-pot. But\r\nvain would be the attempt to marshal before my mind's eye the glorious\r\npageantry of the Trosachs, though, at the time of its actual revelation,\r\nit certainly seemed to make a far more vivid impression. The delight and\r\nexhilaration which such magnificence inspired are easily summoned back,\r\nbut not the incarnate features of them. Wild nature takes us out of\r\nourselves and refreshes us; but she does not reveal her secret to us, or\r\nally herself with anything in us less deep than the abstract soul--which\r\nalso is beyond our reach.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that my father did not like the seaside sojourns as well\r\nas anything else, apart from the historical connections; for the spirits\r\nof many seafaring forefathers murmured in his heart. But he did not so\r\nmuch care for the soft, yielding, brown sands on which the sea-waves\r\nbroke. The coasts to which he had been used in his youth were either\r\nrocky or firm as a macadamized road. Nor was he beguiled into\r\nforgetting the tedium of walking over them, as his companion was, by the\r\nfascination of the shells and sea curiosities to be picked up on them.\r\nMany a mile have I trotted along beside him or behind him, gathering\r\nthese treasures, while he strode forward, abstracted, with his gaze\r\nfixed towards the long ridge of the horizon. The sands at Rhyl, near\r\nwhich Milton's friend was said to have been lost, were like a rolling\r\nprairie; at low tide the white fringe of the surf could scarcely be\r\ndescried at their outermost verge, yet within a few hours it would\r\ncome tumbling back, flowing in between the higher levels, flooding and\r\nbrimming and overcoming, till it broke at our feet once more. Behind us\r\nrose the tumultuous curves and peaks of the Welsh hills; before us, but\r\ninvisible across the Irish Channel, the black coast of rainy Ireland.\r\nOne night, during a gale, a ship came ashore, so far out that it still\r\nseemed, in the morning, to be at sea, except for its motionlessness, and\r\nthe drenched and draggled crew came straggling in--or some of them.\r\nAt Southport the beach was narrower and the little sea-side settlement\r\nlarger and livelier; a string of sleepy donkeys always waited there,\r\nwith the rout of ragged and naughty little boys with sticks to thrash\r\nthem into a perfunctory and reluctant gallop for their riders. There was\r\nalways one boy, larger and also naughtier than the rest, who thrashed\r\nthe thrashers and took their pennies away from them. The prevailing\r\noccupation of the children at these places, as on all civilized shores,\r\napparently, was the building of sand-mountains and the digging of pits\r\nwith their little wooden spades. One day an elderly gentleman, with a\r\nsquare, ruddy face, edged with gray whiskers, who had stood observing my\r\nlabors in this kind for a long time, stepped up to me as I paused, and\r\nsaid, with a sort of amused seriousness, \"You'll do something when you\r\ngrow up, my little lad; your hill is bigger than any of the others'.\"\r\nHe nodded kindly to me and walked off, and I sat down beside my\r\nmountain and watched the tide come up and level it, thinking unutterable\r\nboy-thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe only approach to sea-side cliffs that we saw was at Whitby, on the\r\nYorkshire coast, where the abbey of St. Hilda stood, after whom the\r\nAmerican maiden in The Marble Faun was named. But the German Ocean was\r\nbleak and cold, and my experiences in it were even more harrowing than\r\nelsewhere; I can imagine nothing more dispiriting to a small boy than\r\nto be dragged down over a harsh beach in an old-fashioned British\r\nbathing-machine, its damp floor covered with gritty sand, with a tiny\r\nwindow too high up for him to look out of; undressing in the cold\r\ndraughtiness and trying to hang up his clothes on pegs too high for\r\nhim to reach; being tossed from side to side, and forward and\r\nbackward, meanwhile, by the irregular jerking and swaying of the dismal\r\ncontrivance, drawn by the amphibious horses of the region; until at last\r\nhe hears the waves begin to dash against it, and it comes to a pause in\r\na depth which he feels must be fathomless. Then comes a thumping at\r\nthe door, and he knows that the bathing-woman is hungrily awaiting his\r\nissuing forth. Nothing else is so terrible in the world--nothing even\r\nin Alice in Wonderland--to a small, naked, shivering boy as the British\r\nbathing-woman. There she stands, waist-deep in the swelling brine; she\r\ngrins and chuckles like an ogress; her red, grasping hands stretch\r\nforth like the tentacles of an octopus; she seizes her victim in an\r\nirresistible embrace, and with horrid glee plunges him head-under the\r\nadvancing wave. Ere he can fetch his breath to scream, down again he\r\ngoes, and yet again. The frigid, heavy water stings his cowering body;\r\nhe has swallowed quarts of it; his foot has come in contact with a crab\r\nor a starfish; before him rolls the tumultuous expanse of desolation,\r\nsurging forward to take his life; behind him are the rickety steps of\r\nthe bathing-machine, which, but now a chamber of torture, has become his\r\nsole haven of refuge. Buffeted by the billows, he makes shift at last\r\nfrantically to clamber back into it; he snatches the small, damp towels,\r\nand attempts to dry his shivering limbs; his clothes have fallen on the\r\nwet floor; he cannot force his blue toes into his oozy socks. At the\r\nmoment he is attempting to wriggle himself into his trousers the horse\r\nis hitched-to again, and the jerky and jolty journey back up the\r\nbeach begins. If the hair of a boy of ten could turn white in a single\r\nmorning, there would be many a hoary-headed youngster in British\r\nwatering-places. John Leech, in Punch, used to make pictures of the\r\nexperiences I have outlined, and I studied them with deep attention and\r\nsympathy. The artist, too, must have suffered from the sea-ogresses in\r\nhis youth, else he could not have portrayed the outrage so vividly. The\r\nmock-cheerfulness and hideous maternal parody of their \"Come, my little\r\nman!\" has no parallel in life or fiction. Nevertheless, such is the\r\nfortunate recuperative faculty of boyhood that day after day I would\r\nforget the horrors of that hour, and be happy in climbing over the\r\ndecayed chalk acclivities of Whitby, picking up the fossil shells that\r\nnestle there. Yonder on my table, as I write, lies a coiled ammonite\r\nfound there; it had been there ten thousand years or ages before I\r\ndetached it from its bed, and, for aught I know, my remotest posterity\r\nmay use it, as I have done, for a paper-weight. Thanks to eternal\r\njustice, the bathing-machines and the bathing-women will have gone to\r\ntheir place long ere then!\r\n\r\nMy father had given me a book called The Aquarium, written by Philip\r\nHenry Gosse (father of the present poet, essayist, and critic),\r\nillustrated with pictures of sea-anemones and other marine creatures\r\ndone from his own drawings in color, and so well done that nothing which\r\nhas been done since in the way of color-reproductions surpasses them.\r\nIt was delightfully written, and I absorbed it into my very soul, and my\r\ndreams by night and longings by day were for an aquarium of my own. At\r\nlast--I think this was at Southport--a glass jar was given me; it was\r\nan inverted bell-glass, mounted on a wooden stand, and it cost ten\r\nshillings. I wonder if men often love their wives or children with\r\nthe adoring tenderness that I lavished upon that bell-glass and its\r\ncontents! I got sand and covered the bottom; I found two jagged stones\r\nand leaned them against each other on the sand; I gathered fronds of\r\nulva latissima; I persuaded a boatman to bring me a bucket of salt-water\r\nfrom beyond the line of breakers, and I poured it carefully into the\r\njar. During the next twenty-four hours I waited impatiently for the\r\nwater to settle and clear; then I began to introduce the living inmates.\r\nI collected prawns and crabs and sea-snails, and a tiny sole or two, a\r\ncouple of inches long, and by good chance I found a small sepiola, or\r\ncuttle-fish, as big as a beetle, which burrowed in the sand and changed\r\ncolor magically from dark brown to faintest buff. I also had a pair of\r\nsoldier-crabs, which fought each other continually. When the sunlight\r\nfell on my aquarium, I saw the silver bubbles of oxygen form on the\r\ngreen fronds of the sea-weed; the little snails crawled along the sides\r\nof the glass, sweeping out their tiny, scythelike tongues at every step;\r\nthe prawns hovered in the shade of the stones or darted back and forward\r\nlight as thoughts; the soles scuffled over the surface of the sand or\r\nhid themselves in it from the stalking, felonious crabs. But I had\r\nno sea-anemones; they are not found on sandy coasts, and without\r\nsea-anemones my felicity could not be complete.\r\n\r\nBut strange things happen in this world occasionally, good as well as\r\nbad. There came up a heavy storm, and the next morning, walking with my\r\nfather on the beach, strewn with deep-sea flotsam and jetsam, we came\r\nupon the mast of a ship, water-logged till it had the weight of iron; it\r\nmight have been, as my father remarked, a relic of the Spanish Armada.\r\nAnd it was covered from end to end with the rarest and most beautiful\r\nspecies of sea-anemones!\r\n\r\nThis was fairy-land come true. I chipped off a handkerchiefful of the\r\nbest specimens, wishing I could take them all, and carried them to\r\nmy aquarium. I deposited them, each in a coign of vantage, and in the\r\ncourse of an hour or two they had swelled out their tinted bodies and\r\nexpanded their lovely tentacles, and the cup of my joy was full. This\r\nprosperity continued for near a week, during which I remained with my\r\nnose against the glass, as the street boys of Liverpool held theirs\r\nagainst the windows of pastry-cooks' shops. At length I noticed an\r\nominous clouding of the water, which, as Mr. Gosse had forewarned me,\r\nsignified disaster of some sort, and, searching for the cause, I finally\r\ndiscovered the body of the little sepiola, which had died without being\r\nmissed, and was contaminating with his decay the purity of the aquarium.\r\nThe water must be changed at once. I sent out the servant for a fresh\r\nbucketful from the sea, while I poured the polluted liquid from the jar.\r\n\r\nPresently the bucket of water was brought in. It was unusually clear.\r\nI filled the jar with it, and then, as bedtime was near, I left the\r\naquarium to settle down to business again. The next morning I hastened\r\nto it in my night-gown, and was confronted by a ghastly spectacle. The\r\ncrabs lay dead on the bottom, stomachs upward; the prawns hung lifeless\r\nand white from the rocks; the soldier-crabs were motionless, half out of\r\ntheir shells; the sea-anemones had contracted themselves into buttons,\r\nand most of them had dropped from their perches. Death had been rampant\r\nduring the night; but what could be the cause?\r\n\r\nA sudden suspicion caused me to put a finger in the water and apply it\r\nto my tongue. It was not salt-water at all, but had been taken fresh\r\nfrom the cistern. That traitress servant-girl, to save her indolence a\r\nfew steps, had destroyed my aquarium!\r\n\r\nI was too heart-broken to think of killing her; but she had killed\r\nsomething in me which does not readily grow again. My trust in my\r\nfellow-creatures was as shrunken and inanimate as the sea-anemones. We\r\nleft Southport soon after, and that was my last aquarium.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to lighter matters. I accompanied my father and mother on\r\nthat pilgrimage to Old Boston which is described in Our Old Home. The\r\nworld does not know that it is to my presence on the little steamer\r\non the trip down the level river, through the Lincolnshire fens, with\r\nnothing but the three-hundred-foot tower of St. Botolph's Church, in the\r\nextreme distance, to relieve the tedium of a twenty-four-mile journey\r\nmade at the rate of never more than six miles per hour--it is not known,\r\nI say, that to that circumstance is due my father's description of the\r\nonly incident which enlivened the way--the tragedy, namely, of the duck\r\nfamily. For it was that tragedy which stood out clearest in my memory,\r\nand when I learned, in Concord, that my father was preparing his paper\r\nabout Old Boston for the Atlantic Monthly, I besought him to insert an\r\naccount of the episode. The duck and her five ducklings had probably\r\nseen the steamer many times before, and had acquired a contempt for its\r\nrate of progression, imagining that it would always be easy to escape\r\nfrom it. But, somehow, in their overweening security, they lingered on\r\nthis occasion a little too long, and we succeeded in running them down.\r\nEven then, as my father notes, it was only one of them that was carried\r\nunder; but the shock to the nerves of the other youngsters must have\r\nstunted their growth, and the old bird cannot but have suffered tortures\r\nfrom anxiety and remorse.\r\n\r\nThe sadness caused by this event, added to the chilliness of the\r\nsea-wind which blew against us all the way down the river, rendered my\r\nfirst impressions of the ancient town, which had given its name to the\r\none I was born in, somewhat gloomy. But the next morning it brightened\r\nup, and our own spirits were correspondingly improved; insomuch that\r\nI struck my head a violent blow against the stone roof of the topmost\r\npinnacle of St. Botolph's tower, such was the zeal of my ascent into\r\nit. All this happened two years after the aquarium, in 1857, when I was\r\nolder and wiser, but had not yet outgrown the ambition to climb to the\r\ntop of all high places; this bump may have been an admonition not\r\nto climb too high. We went down and strayed into Mr. Porter's little\r\nbook-shop, and he transformed himself into a new and more genial\r\nproprietor of a virtuoso's collection, and showed us treasures, some\r\nof which his predecessor in Mosses from an Old Manse might not have\r\ndespised. I have never since then heard of his portrait in crayon of\r\nthe youthful Sterne; it would be worth a good deal to any latter-day\r\npublisher of his works in a de luxe edition. As for the green tassel\r\nfrom the bed of Queen Mary, in Holyrood House, there is a passage in\r\nmy father's description of it in his journal which, out of regard,\r\ndoubtless, for the feelings of Mr. Porter, he forbore to quote in his\r\npublished article; but as the good old gentleman (unless he has lived\r\nto be more than one hundred and twenty years old) must have gone to the\r\nplace where treasures are indestructible, I will reproduce it now. \"This\r\ntassel,\" says my father, \"Mr. Porter told us (with a quiet chuckle and\r\nhumorous self-gratulation), he had personally stolen, and really, for my\r\npart, though I hope I would not have done it myself, I thought it no sin\r\nin him--such valuables being attracted by a natural magnetism towards\r\nsuch a man. He obeys, in stealing them, a higher law than he breaks.\r\nI should like to know precisely what portion of his rich and rare\r\ncollection he has obtained in a similar manner. But far be it from me\r\nto speak unkindly or sneeringly of the good man; for he showed us great\r\nkindness, and obliged us so much the more by being greatly and evidently\r\npleased with the trouble that he took on our behalf.\" It may be added\r\nthat each new stealing enhances the value of all the previous ones,\r\nand therefore creates an obligation to steal yet more. Thus does an act\r\nwhich would, standing by itself, be criminal, become a virtue if often\r\nenough repeated.\r\n\r\nI am not arranging this narrative in chronological sequence; but I think\r\nit was in this year that we went to Manchester to see the exposition.\r\nThe town itself was unlovely; but, as we had Italy in prospect, it\r\nwas deemed expedient to accustom ourselves in some measure to the\r\ncompanionship of works of art, and the exhibition professed to contain\r\nan exceptionally fine and catholic collection of them. My father made a\r\nthorough study of them, going to learn and not to judge, and he learned\r\nmuch, though not quite to believe in Turner or to like the old masters.\r\nFor my own part, when not taken on these expeditions, I busied myself\r\nwith the building of a kite six feet high, of engineer's cambric, with a\r\nface painted on it, and used to go out and fly it on a vacant lot in the\r\nrear of our lodgings, accompanied by a large portion of the unoccupied\r\npopulation of Manchester. The kite broke its string one day, and I saw\r\nit descend over the roofs of a remote slum region towards the south, and\r\nI never recaptured it. But my chief energies were devoted to acquiring\r\nthe art of fencing with the small-sword from one Corporal Blair, of the\r\nFourth Dragoon Guards--a regiment which had distinguished itself in the\r\nCrimean War. The corporal was a magnificent-looking creature, and he\r\nwas as admirable inwardly as outwardly--the model of an English\r\nnon-commissioned officer. He used to come to our lodgings in his\r\nshort scarlet jacket and black trousers, and my father once asked\r\nhim, remarking the extraordinary prominence of his chest, what kind of\r\npadding was used to produce so impressive a contour. \"There's nothing\r\nhere but my linen, sir,\" answered the corporal, modestly, and blushing\r\na good deal; a fact which I, having often taken my lessons at the\r\nbarracks, in the private quarters of the corporal, where he permitted\r\nhimself to appear in his shirt-sleeves, already knew. My experience of\r\nthe British army not being so large as that of some other persons, I\r\nam unable to say whether there were many other soldiers in it fit to be\r\ncompared with Blair; but my acquaintance with mankind in general would\r\nlead me to infer that there could not have been then, and that there are\r\nstill less of such to-day. An army of six--footers like him, with his\r\nintelligence, instincts of discipline, capacity and expertness, physical\r\nstrength and activity, and personal courage, would easily account for\r\nmore than all of England's warlike renown and success; the puzzle is,\r\nhow to account for anything but disaster without them--though, to be\r\nsure, other armies might be equally lacking in Blairs. He was well\r\neducated, modest, and moral; he was a married man, with a wife who was\r\nthe model of a soldier's consort, and two or three little sons, all\r\nof them experts with the foils and the broadsword. It was against the\r\nregulations of the service for privates or non-commissioned officers to\r\nhave families, and, when Blair's connubial condition became known to the\r\nauthorities, he was degraded in rank from sergeant to corporal, though\r\nhe wore the Balaklava medal; for he had taken part in that immortal\r\ncharge, and I only wish I could recall the story of it as he\r\ntold it to me. His regiment had been under the command of Lord\r\nCardigan--\"Black-Bottle Cardigan,\" as he was nicknamed in the army,\r\non account of the well-known (real or apocryphal) incident. It was\r\nmy good--fortune, by-the-way, once to see this eminent captain. I was\r\ntaking my lesson at the barracks, when Blair told me that his lordship\r\nwas expected to visit them that afternoon. The hour appointed was three\r\no'clock. Punctually at three o'clock a carriage drove rapidly through\r\nthe gates of the barracks, and the guard turned out on the run and\r\nlined up to salute the noble occupant. But, much to their disgust, the\r\noccupant turned out to be some one else, not meriting a salute. The\r\nmen returned to the guard-room feeling as men do when they have been\r\nbetrayed into exertion and enthusiasm for nothing. However, in about ten\r\nminutes more, another carriage drove up, and out came the guard again\r\nand ranged themselves smartly, to please the eye of their martinet\r\ncommander, when lo! they had again been deceived. Again they retired\r\nwith dark looks, not being at all in a mood to recognize the humor of\r\nthe situation. This same thing actually occurred twice more, by which\r\ntime it was near four o'clock, and the men were wellnigh mutinous, and\r\nit became evident that, for some reason, Cardigan had been prevented\r\nfrom coming. Such being the case, the approach of still another carriage\r\nattracted no attention whatever, until it came to a half-pause, and I\r\nsaw, thrust out of the window, a stern, dark, warlike, soldierly face,\r\nfull of surprise and indignation--and this was Cardigan himself. The\r\nunhappy guard tumbled over themselves in vain efforts to get into form;\r\nit was too late, and the haughty and hot-tempered commander drove on\r\nwithout his salute. Blair, not being on guard duty, had no part in this\r\ncatastrophe, but I well remember his unaffected sorrow over it. He was\r\na grave man, though of an equable and cheerful temper, and he felt his\r\ncomrades' misfortune as his own. But I never heard that any casualties\r\noccurred in consequence of the mishap.\r\n\r\nI have left two years of our English sojourn unaccounted for. In\r\nthe summer of 1855, my father nearly made up his mind to resign his\r\nconsulship (since it had become hardly worth keeping from the money\r\npoint of view), and, after making a visit to Italy, going back to\r\nConcord. This plan seemed the more advisable, because my mother's lungs\r\ncould not endure the English climate. But while he was weighing the\r\nmatter, John O'Sullivan wrote from Lisbon, urgently inviting my mother\r\nand sisters to come out and spend a few months with him and his family\r\nthere. The Lisbon climate was a specific for bronchial disease; my\r\nfather could complete his term, and we could go to Italy the following\r\nyear. There was only one objection to this--it involved the parting of\r\nmy father from my mother, a thing which had never before happened. But\r\nit did not take him long to decide that it would be a good thing for\r\nher, and, therefore, in the long run, for him. Each loved the other\r\nunselfishly, and had the courage of such love. Liverpool without my\r\nmother would be a dismal trial for him to face; Lisbon without my father\r\nwould be tenfold an exile for her. But they made up their minds, each\r\nfor the other's sake, to undergo the separation, and accordingly, in the\r\nautumn of the year, she and my sisters sailed from Southampton, and my\r\nfather and I went back to Liverpool. How we fared there shall be told in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\n     If there were boarding-houses in paradise--Blodgett, the\r\n     delight of mankind--Solomon foresaw her--A withering retort--\r\n     A modest, puny poise about her--Hidden thoughts derived\r\n     from Mother Eve and Grecian Helen--The feminine council that\r\n     ruled the Yankee captains--Bonds of fraternity, double-\r\n     riveted and copper-fastened--Through the looking-glass--Men\r\n     only of the manliest sort--The lady-paramount--Hands which\r\n     were true works of art--Retained his dignity without putting\r\n     it on--Sighed heavily over my efforts--Unctuous M. Huguenin--\r\n     \"From dawn to eve I fell\"--The multum-in-parvo machine--\r\n     \"Beauty and the Beast\"--Frank Channing--\"Blood-and water!\"--\r\n     A lapful of Irish stew.\r\n\r\nIt was observed a little way back that English boarding-houses were much\r\nlike other boarding-houses in the civilized world. The rule is proved\r\nby the exception of Mrs. Blodgett's establishment. There never was such\r\nanother; there never will be; it was unique. It has vanished from earth\r\nlong since; but if there were boarding-houses in paradise, I should\r\ncertainly expect it to be found again there. Who was Mrs. Blodgett? Save\r\nthat she was a widow of the British middle class, I doubt if any one of\r\nher boarders knew. She had once been rich, and had lived at Gibraltar. I\r\nhave often meditated with fruitless longing about what manner of man Mr.\r\nBlodgett could have been. He must have been, like the Emperor Titus,\r\nthe delight of mankind in his day. He was a man, we must surmise, whose\r\ncharms and virtues were such that his wife, having felt the bliss and\r\nprivilege of knowing and living with him, registered a vow over his bier\r\nthat she would devote her future career to the attempt to make others as\r\nhappy as he had made her; that she would serve others as faithfully\r\nand generously as she had served him. It was a lofty and beautiful\r\nconception, for she must have perceived that only in that way could she\r\nkeep his blessed spirit near her; that the little heaven she would make\r\nin Duke Street, Liverpool, would attract him from the kindred heaven\r\nabove; that he would choose to hover, invisible, above her plenteous\r\ntable, inhaling the grateful aromas that arose from it as from a savory\r\nsacrifice, basking in the smiles and sympathizing in the satisfaction\r\nof the fortunate guests, triumphing in their recognition of his beloved\r\nconsort as a queen among women. One might almost fancy that the steam\r\narising from the portly soup-tureen assumed as it arose something\r\nsuggesting a human form; that from its airy and fragrant mistiness a\r\nshadowy countenance beamed down upon the good lady in black, with\r\nthe white cap, who ladled out the delicious compound to her waiting\r\ndevotees. The murmur of the tea-urn would seem to fashion itself into\r\nairy accents, syllabling, \"Mary, thy Blodgett is here!\" His genial\r\nspirit would preside over her labors in the kitchen, suggesting ever\r\nmore delightsome dishes and delicate desserts. He would warn her against\r\nundesirable inmates and intractable servants, and would inspire her\r\ntradesmen to serve her with the choicest comestibles and to temper\r\ntheir bills to the unprotected widow. At night he would bless her lonely\r\npillow with peace, and would gently rouse her in the morning to a new\r\nday of beneficences.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blodgett was about five feet four inches high, and may have weighed\r\ntwelve stone; into such limits were her virtues packed. She was perhaps\r\nin the neighborhood of her fiftieth year; her dark hair was threaded\r\nwith honorable gray. Her countenance was rotund and ruddy; it was the\r\nflower of kindness and hospitality in full bloom; but there was also\r\npower in the thick eyebrows and in the massy substance of the chin--of\r\nthe chins, indeed, for here, as in other gifts, nature had been generous\r\nwith her. There was shrewdness and discernment in the good-nature of her\r\neyes; she knew human nature, although no one judged it with more charity\r\nthan she. Her old men were her brothers, her young men were her sons,\r\nall children were her children. Solomon foresaw her in the most engaging\r\nof his Proverbs. Her maid-servants arose at six in the morning and\r\ncalled her blessed, for though her rule was strict it was just and\r\nloving. She was at once the mistress and the friend of her household; no\r\nYankee captain so audacious that he ventured to oppose her law; no cynic\r\nso cold as not to be melted by her tenderness. She was clad always in\r\nblack, with a white cap and ribbons, always spotless amid the grime of\r\nLiverpool; in her more active moments--though she was always active--she\r\nadded a white apron to her attire. She was ever anywhere where she\r\nwas needed; she was never anywhere where she could be dispensed with.\r\nWherever she went she brought comfort and a cheerful but not restless\r\nanimation. Her boarders were busy men, but it was always with an effort\r\nthat they wrenched themselves from her breakfast-table, and they sat\r\ndown to dinner as one man. She made them happy, but she would not spoil\r\nthem. \"You're a pretty young man!\" she said, severely, to complacent\r\nMr. Crane, when, one morning, he came late to breakfast. \"I always knew\r\nthat,\" returned he, reaching self-satisfiedly for the toast-rack. \"Well,\r\nI'm sure your glass never told you so!\" was the withering retort. Mr.\r\nCrane did not lift his neck so high after that. The grin that went round\r\nthe table was too crushingly unanimous.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blodgett was helped in her duties by her niece, Miss Maria, and by\r\nher sister, Miss Williams. Miss Maria was a little wisp of a woman; I\r\ndo not know her age then, but I think, were she alive today, she would\r\nconfess to about eighty-three. She wore ringlets, after the fashion\r\nof the early nineteenth-century books of beauty. Her face was thin and\r\nnarrow, and ordinarily pale; but when Miss Maria had been a little while\r\nin conversation with one or more of the gallant Yankee captains you\r\nmight see in the upper corner of each cheek a slight touch of red. For\r\nthough I would not call the little lady coquettish--that is too coarse\r\nand obvious a word--yet there was in her that inalienable consciousness\r\nof maidenhood, that sentiment, at once of attraction and of recoil,\r\ntowards creatures of the opposite sex, that gentle hope of pleasing man,\r\nthat secret emotion of being pleased by him, that tremor at the idea of\r\nbeing desired, and that flush at the thought of being desirable, which,\r\nI suppose, may animate the mystic sensibilities of spinsterhood. She\r\nwas anything but aggressive and confident, yet there was a modest, puny\r\npoise about her; she was like a plant that has always lived in a narrow,\r\ncity flower-pot, at a window too seldom visited by the sun, which has\r\nnever known the freedom of the rain, but has been skimpingly watered\r\nout of a toy watering-pot; which has never so much as conceived of the\r\ndaring and voluptuous charms of its remote sisters of the forest and\r\ngarden, but has cherished its rudimentary perfume and its incipient\r\ntints in a light reflected from brick walls and in the thin, stale\r\natmosphere of rear sitting-rooms. Yet it knows that it is a flower, and\r\nthat it might, somehow, fulfil its destiny and be beautiful. So Miss\r\nMaria had, no doubt, hidden thoughts remotely derived from Mother Eve\r\nand from Grecian Helen; she was aware of the potentiality in herself of\r\nall virgin privileges and powers, and assumed thereupon her own little\r\ndignity. Never but once did I see a masculine arm round Miss Maria's\r\ntrig, stiff little waist, and that was at Christmas-time, when there\r\nwere sprigs of mistletoe over every doorway; but, mistletoe or not, the\r\nowner of that arm, if he did succeed in ravishing a kiss, got his ears\r\nsmartly boxed the next moment. I don't know precisely what was Miss\r\nMaria's function in the economy of the household; I can fancy her\r\nsetting the table, and adding touches of neatness and prettiness;\r\ndusting the ornaments and fine china on the shelves of the whatnot;\r\nstraightening the frames of the pictures on the walls; and, in her less\r\nromantic moments, hemming towels or sheets, or putting up preserved\r\nfruits. I know she was always amiable and obliging and that everybody\r\nloved her.\r\n\r\nMiss Williams was a good deal the elder of her sister, and was of a\r\nclear white pallor and an aged delicacy and shyness that were very\r\ncaptivating. She had judgment and a clear, dispassionate brain, and\r\nI presume she acted the part in the little firm of a sort of court of\r\nappeals and final adviser and referee. She talked little and had little\r\nto do with outward affairs, but she sat observant and penetrating\r\nand formed conclusions in her mind. There had been no brother of The\r\nBlodgett to induce her to change her maidenly state, but I think there\r\nmust have been a quiet, touching romance somewhere hidden in the shadows\r\nof the previous forty or fifty years. She admired and delighted in her\r\nenergetic, practical sister as much as the latter adored her for her\r\nserenity and wisdom. There was between them an intimacy, confidence,\r\nand mutual understanding that were charming to behold. When the blessed\r\nBlodgett had died, one can imagine the vital support and consolation\r\nwhich Miss Williams had been able to afford to her afflicted sister.\r\nEach of them seemed, in some way, to explain and enlarge one's\r\nconception of the other. Widely different as they appeared outwardly,\r\nthere was a true sisterly likeness deep down in them. Such was the\r\nfeminine council that ruled the destinies of the Yankee captains and of\r\ntheir consul.\r\n\r\nThese captains and this consul formed nine-tenths of the population of\r\nthe house, and such other denizens as it had were at least Americans. I\r\nnever learned the cause of this predilection for representatives of the\r\ngreat republic and for the seafaring variety of them in particular. Be\r\nthat as it might (and it is an interesting inquiry in itself), it can\r\nbe readily understood that it worked out well as a business idea. There\r\nwere no quarrels or heart-burnings among the jolly occupants of Mrs.\r\nBlodgett's table; first, because they were all Americans in the country\r\nof their hereditary enemies, and, secondly, because they were all men\r\nof the same calling, and that calling the sea. The bonds of fraternity\r\nbetween them were double-riveted and copper-fastened. Thus all who had\r\nexperienced the Blodgett regime proclaimed its excellence far and wide,\r\nand the number of applicants always exceeded the accommodations; in\r\nfact, during this year 1855-56, our hostess was compelled to buy the\r\nhouse adjoining her own, and I had the rare delight of watching every\r\nstroke of work done by the carpenters and bricklayers who had the job\r\nof cutting a doorway through the wall from the old house to the new one.\r\nThere was something magical and adventurous in stepping through that\r\nopening for the first time--crossing a boundary which had maintained\r\nitself so long. Probably the sensation resembled that which Alice\r\nafterwards experienced when she stepped through the looking-glass into\r\nthe room on the other side. The additional accommodations were speedily\r\nfilled; but after the first fascination had worn off nobody regarded the\r\nnew house as comparable with the old one, and the people who roomed in\r\nit were looked down upon by their associates of the original dwelling.\r\nThey were, I believe, as much alike as two houses could be, and that is\r\nsaying much in this age, but the feeling was different, and the feeling\r\nis everything if you have a soul.\r\n\r\nIf the Blodgett house, or houses, were unique, so were the Yankee\r\nboarders. The race of our merchant-marine captains disappeared with\r\ntheir ships, and they will return no more. The loss is irretrievable,\r\nfor in many respects they held the ideal of patriotic and energetic\r\nAmericanism higher than it is likely to go again. When at sea, in\r\ncommand of and responsible for their ships and cargoes, they were, no\r\ndoubt, upon occasion, despots and slave-drivers; but their crews were\r\noften recruited from among the dregs of men of all nations, who would\r\ninterpret kindness as timidity and take an ell where you gave them\r\nan inch. No doubt, too, there were incarnate devils among these\r\ncaptains--actual monomaniacs of cruelty and viciousness--though none of\r\nthese were known at Mrs. Blodgett's. Round her board sat men only of\r\nthe manliest sort. They had the handiness and versatility of the sailor,\r\nwide and various knowledge of all quarters of the globe and of types of\r\nmankind, though, to be sure, their investigations did not proceed far\r\nbeyond their ports, and you were sometimes more astonished at what\r\nthey did not know than at what they did. They had the self-poise and\r\nself-confidence of men who day by day and month by month hold their\r\nlives in their hands, and are practised in finding a way out of danger\r\nand difficulty. They had a code of good manners and polite behavior\r\nwhich was not highly refined, but contained the sound, essential\r\nelements of courtesy; not expressed in fancy, but honest and solid. They\r\nhad great shrewdness, and were capable of really fine diplomacy, for\r\nthe school they attended demanded such proficiency. They had a dry,\r\nchuckling humor; a homely philosophy, often mingled with the queerest\r\nsuperstitions; a racy wit, smacking somewhat, of course, of the\r\nquarter-deck, or even of the forecastle; a seemingly incongruous\r\nsensibility, so that tears easily sprang to their eyes if the right\r\nchord of pathos were touched; a disposition to wear a high-colored\r\nnecktie and a broad, gold watch-chain, and to observe a certain\r\nsmartness in their boots and their general shore rigging; a good\r\nappetite for good food, and not a little discernment of what was good; a\r\ngreat and boylike enjoyment of primitive pleasures; a love of practical\r\njokes and a hearty roar of laughter for hearty fun; a self-respecting\r\nnaturalness, which made them gentlemen in substance if not in all\r\ntechnical details; a pungent contempt for humbug and artifice, though\r\nthey might not mind a good, swaggering lie upon occasion; a robust sense\r\nof honor in all matters which were trusted to their honorable feeling;\r\nand, to make an end of this long catalogue, a practical command of\r\nlanguage regarded as a means of expressing and communicating the\r\nessential core of thoughts, though the words might not always be\r\ndiscoverable in Johnson's dictionary or the grammatical constructions\r\nsuch as would be warranted by Lindley Murray. They were, upon the\r\naverage, good-looking, active, able men, and most of them were on the\r\nsunny side of forty. They were ready to converse on any subject, but\r\nif left to themselves they would choose topics proper to their\r\ncalling-ships and shipwrecks, maritime usages of various countries, of\r\nlaws of insurance, of sea-rights, of feats of seamanship, of luck and\r\nill luck, and here and there a little politics of the old-fashioned,\r\nelementary sort. They boasted themselves and their country not a little,\r\nand criticised everybody else, and John Bull especially, very severely\r\noften, but almost always very acutely, too. They would play euchre and\r\nsmoke cigars from nine o'clock till eleven, and would then go to bed and\r\nsleep till the breakfast-bell. Altogether, they were fine company, and\r\nthey did me much good. Such were the captains of our merchant marine\r\nabout the middle of the last century.\r\n\r\nSome of them would bring their wives with them for the voyage; uniformly\r\nrather pretty women, a trifle dressy, somewhat fragile in appearance,\r\nbut really sound enough; naive, simple, good souls, loving their\r\nhusbands and magnifying them, and taking a vicarious pride in their\r\nships and sea-craft. The lady-paramount of these, in my estimation, was\r\nthe wife of old Captain Howes, the inventor of Howes' patent rig, which\r\nhe was at that time perfecting. He would sometimes invite me up to his\r\nroom to see the exquisitely finished model which he had made with his\r\nown hands. He was the commodore of the captains, the oldest, wisest, and\r\nmost impressive of them; a handsome, massive, Jovelike old gentleman,\r\nwith the gentlest and most indulgent manners, and a straightforward,\r\nsimple mariner withal. He had ceased to make voyages, and was settled,\r\nfor the time being, in Liverpool. Mrs. Howes seemed, to my boyish\r\napprehension, to be a sort of princess of exquisite and gracious\r\nrefinement; I could imagine nothing in feminine shape more delicate,\r\nof more languid grace, of finer patrician elegance. She was certainly\r\nimmensely good-natured and indulgent towards me, and, in the absence of\r\nmy mother, tried to teach me to be less of an Orson; she had hands which\r\nwere true works of art, flexible, fine-grained, taper-fingered, and\r\nlily-white; these she used very effectively, and would fain have induced\r\nme to attempt the regeneration of my own dirty and ragged little fists.\r\nShe would beseech me, also, to part my hair straight, to forbear to soil\r\nmy jacket, and even to get my shoes blacked. I was thankful for these\r\nattentions, though I was unable to profit by them. Sometimes, at table,\r\nI would glance up to find her eyes dwelling with mild reproach upon me;\r\ndoubtless I was continually perpetrating terrible enormities. Had she\r\nherself been less perfect and immaculate, I might have felt more hopes\r\nof my own amendment; but I felt that I was not in her class at all, and\r\nI gave up at the start. She was a wonderful human ornament, the despair,\r\nI thought, of all pursuit, not to mention rivalry. Beside the heroic\r\nfigure of her captain, she looked like a lily mated with an oak; but\r\nthey were as happy a pair, and as well mated, as one could hope to see.\r\n\r\nI was, perhaps, more in my proper element among the captains down in\r\nthe smoking-room, which was at the back of the house, at the end of the\r\nhallway, on the left. My father sat there foot to foot with them, played\r\neuchre with them, listened to their yarns, laughed at their jokes, and\r\nfelt, probably, the spirit of his own old sea-captain ancestors stirring\r\nwithin him. Some of them were a little shy of his official position at\r\nfirst, and indeed he was occasionally constrained to adopt towards one\r\nor another of them, in the consulate, a bearing very different from the\r\neasy comradeship of the Blodgett evenings; but in process of time they\r\ncame to understand him, and accepted him, on the human basis, as a\r\nfriend and brother. My father had the rare faculty of retaining his\r\ndignity without putting it on. No one ever took liberties with him, and\r\nhe took none with anybody; yet there was no trace in his intercourse of\r\nstiffness or pose; there did not need to be, since there was behind his\r\neye that potentiality of self--protection which renders superfluous\r\nall outward demonstration of personal sanctity. On the other hand, he\r\nobviously elevated the tone of our little society; the stout captains,\r\nwho feared nothing else, feared their worser selves in his presence.\r\nNone of them knew or cared a straw for his literary genius and its\r\nproductions; but they were aware of something in him which they\r\nrespected as well as liked, and there was no member of the company who\r\nwas more popular or influential.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout letting me feel that I was the object of special solicitude or\r\nwatchfulness, my father knew all that I did, and saw to it that my\r\ntime was decently occupied. In addition to the dancing-lessons already\r\nmentioned (in which I became brilliantly proficient, and achieved such\r\nfeats in the way of polkas, mazurkas, hornpipes, and Scotch reels as\r\nfilled my instructor and myself with pride)--in addition to this, I was\r\ncloseted twice a week with a very serious and earnest drawing-master,\r\nwho taught me with infinite conscientiousness, and sighed heavily\r\nover the efforts which I submitted to him. The captains, who were my\r\nchampions and abettors in all things, might take in their large hands a\r\ndrawing of mine and the copy by the master which had been my model,\r\nand say, one to the other, \"Well, now, I couldn't tell which was\r\nwhich--could you?\" But the master could tell, and the certainty of it\r\nsteeped his soul in constant gloom. I doubt if he recovered from the\r\npangs I gave him. The fact was, I thought an hour of dancing with lovely\r\nMary Warren was worth all the art in the world. Another instructor to\r\nwhom I brought honor was thick-shouldered, portly, unctuous M. Huguenin,\r\na Swiss, proprietor of the once-famous gymnasium which bore his name.\r\nHe so anointed me with praise that I waxed indiscreet, and one day, as\r\nI was swinging on the rings, and he was pointing out to some prospective\r\npatrons my extraordinary merits, my grasp relaxed at the wrong moment\r\nand I came sailing earthward from on high. It seemed to me that, like\r\nMilton's Lucifer, \"from dawn to eve I fell,\" M. Huguenin sprinting to\r\nintercept my fall; but I landed on a mat and was little the worse\r\nfor it. I fear the prospective patrons were not persuaded, by my\r\nperformance, of the expediency of gymnastic training. On the other\r\nhand, M. Huguenin managed to dispose to my father of one of his\r\nmultum-in-parvo exercising-machines, on the understanding that it was to\r\nbe taken back at half-price on the expiration of our stay in Liverpool;\r\nbut, when that time came, M. Huguenin failed to remember having been a\r\nparty to any such understanding; so the big framework was boxed up, and\r\nfinally was resurrected in Concord, where I labored with it for seven or\r\neight years more during my home-comings from Harvard.\r\n\r\nIn the intervals of my other pursuits, I was, at this period, sent into\r\nsociety. The society at Mrs. Blodgett's was, indeed, all that I desired;\r\nbut it was doubtless perceived that it was not all that my polite\r\ndevelopment required; my Orsonism was too much indulged. I was sent\r\nalone to Sandheys, the Brights' and Heywoods' place, where I was\r\nmoderately ill at ease; and also to the house of a lady in town, who\r\nreceived a good deal of company, and there I was, at first, acutely\r\nmiserable. The formalities of the drawing-room and the elegant\r\nconversation overwhelmed me with the kind of torture which Swedenborg\r\nascribes to those spirits of the lower orders who are admitted\r\ntemporarily into the upper heavens. Unlike these unfortunates, however,\r\nI presently got acclimated; other boys of my age appeared, and numbers\r\nof little girls (Mary Warren among them), and now society occupied all\r\nmy thoughts. The lady of the house got up private theatricals--\"Beauty\r\nand the Beast\" was the play. I was cast for the parts of the Second\r\nSister and of the Beast; Mary Warren was the Beauty. I got by heart not\r\nonly my own lines, but those of all the other performers and the stage\r\ndirections. The play was received with applause, and after it was\r\ndone the actors were feted; my father was not present, but he appeared\r\ngreatly diverted by my account of the proceedings. He was probably\r\ntesting me in various ways to see what I was made of, and whether\r\nanything could be made of me. He encouraged my predilection for natural\r\nhistory by getting me books on conchology and taking me to museums\r\nto study the specimens and make pencil drawings of them. In these\r\navocations I was also companioned by Frank Channing, whose specialty\r\nwas ornithology, and who was making a series of colored portraits of the\r\nbirds in the museum, very cleverly done.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: WILLIAM HENRY CHANNING, 1855]\r\n\r\nFrank was the son of the Rev. William Henry Channing, who was pastor of\r\na Unitarian church in Liverpool; he had brought his family to England\r\nat about the same time that we came. He was a nephew, I believe, of\r\nthe William Ellery Channing who was one of the founders of American\r\nUnitarianism, and the brother, therefore, of the Ellery Channing of\r\nConcord. Frank inherited much of the talent of his family. He was\r\nafterwards sent to Oxford, where he took the highest honors. All\r\nintellectual operations came easy to him. He also showed a strong\r\nproclivity to art, and he was wonderfully clever in all kinds of fine\r\nhandwork. He was at this time a tall and very handsome boy, about two\r\nyears my senior. He was, like myself, fanatically patriotic, an American\r\nof Americans, and this brought us together in a foreign land; but, aside\r\nfrom that, I have seldom met a more fascinating companion. I followed\r\nhim about with joy and admiration. He used to make for me tiny little\r\nthree-masted ships, about six inches long, with all the rigging\r\ncomplete; they were named after the famous American clippers of the day,\r\nand he painted microscopic American flags to hoist over the taff-rail.\r\nHe tried to teach me how to paint in water-colors, but I responded\r\nbetter to his eloquence regarding the future of our country. He proved\r\nto me by a mathematical demonstration, which I accepted without in the\r\nleast understanding it, that in fifty years New York would be larger and\r\nmore populous than London at the end of the same period. This brilliant\r\nboy seemed fitted for the highest career in his native country; his\r\nfather did not contemplate a permanent stay in England, and in after\r\nyears I used to look for his name in our Senate, or among the occupants\r\nof the Supreme Bench. But, as it turned out, he never revisited America,\r\nexcept for short periods. His father was induced to remain abroad by\r\nthe success of his preaching, and Frank, after his career at Oxford, was\r\noverpowered by the subtle attractions of English culture, and could not\r\nseparate himself from the old country. I saw him once while I was at\r\nHarvard. He was an Englishman in all outward respects, and seemed to\r\nbe so inwardly likewise. The other day I heard of a Frank Channing in\r\nParliament; probably the same man. But either the effect upon him of his\r\nvoluntary expatriation--his failure to obey at eve the voice obeyed at\r\nprime--or some other cause, has prevented him from ever doing anything\r\nto attract attention, or to appear commensurate with his radiant\r\npromise. Henry James is the only American I know who has not suffered\r\nfrom adopting England; and even he might have risen higher than he has\r\ndone had he overcome his distaste to the external discomforts of the\r\ndemocracy and cast in his lot with ours.\r\n\r\nFrank's father was a tall, intellectual, slender Yankee, endowed with\r\nsplendid natural gifts, which he had improved by assiduous cultivation.\r\nIn the pulpit he rose to an almost divine eloquence and passion, and\r\na light would shine over his face as if reflected from the Holy Spirit\r\nitself. My father took a pew in his church, and sent me to sit in it\r\nevery Sunday; he never went himself. He was resolved, I suppose, if\r\nthere was any religion in me, to afford it an opportunity to come out.\r\nNow, I had a religious reverence for divine things, but no understanding\r\nwhatever of dogma of any sort. I never learned to repeat a creed, far\r\nless to comprehend its significance. I was moved and charmed by Mr.\r\nChanning's discourses, but I did not like to sit in the pew; I did\r\nnot like \"church.\" I remember nothing of the purport of any of those\r\nsermons; but, oddly enough, I do recall one preached by a gentleman who\r\nunited the profession of preacher with that of medicine; he occupied\r\nChanning's pulpit on a certain occasion, and preached on the text in\r\nJohn xix., 34: \"But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side,\r\nand forthwith came thereout blood and water.\" The good doctor, drawing\r\non his physiological erudition, demonstrated at great length how it was\r\npossible that blood should be mingled with the water, and showed at what\r\nprecise point in Christ's body the spear must have entered. I seem to\r\nhear again his mellifluous voice, repeating at the close of each passage\r\nof his argument, \"And forthwith came thereout blood-AND WATER!\" I did\r\nnot approve of this sermon; I was not carried to heaven in the spirit\r\nby it, as by Channing's; but somehow it has stuck in my memory all these\r\nforty-eight years.\r\n\r\nOften I stayed for a few days at a time at Channing's house; his wife\r\nwas a handsome, delicate, very nervous woman; his daughter Fanny was a\r\nbeauty, and became still more beautiful in after years; she was married,\r\nwhen past her first youth, to Edwin Arnold, author of \"The Light of\r\nAsia,\" and of many rhetorical leading articles in the London Telegraph.\r\nShe died a few years ago. They were, all of them, kind to me. I did\r\nthe best I could to be a good little boy there; but I recollect Mrs.\r\nChanning's face of sorrow and distress when, one day at dinner, I upset\r\ninto my lap my plate, which she had just filled with Irish stew--one\r\nof my best-loved dishes. \"Frank never does that,\" she murmured, as she\r\nwiped me up; \"never-never!\" Nobody looked cheerful, and I never got over\r\nthat mortification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\n     Bennoch and Bright like young housekeepers--\"What did you\r\n     marry that woman for?\"--\"Mrs. Caudle's Curtain Lectures\"--\r\n     \"The worst book anybody ever wrote\"--\"Most magnificent eye I\r\n     ever saw\"--A great deal of the feminine in Reade--Fire,\r\n     pathos, fun, and dramatic animation--A philosophical library\r\n     in itself--Amusing appanage of his own book--Oily and\r\n     voluble sanctimoniousness--Self-worship of the os-rotundus\r\n     sort--Inflamed rather than abated by years--\"Every word of\r\n     it true; but--\"--Better, or happier, because we had lived--\r\n     Appropriated somebody else's adventure--Filtering remarks\r\n     through the mind of a third person--A delightful Irishman--\r\n     Unparalleled audacity--An unregenerate opinion--The whole\r\n     line of Guelphs in it--\"Oh, that somebody would invent a new\r\n     sin!\"--\"The Angel in the House\"--Very well dressed--\r\n     Indomitable figure, aggressively American--Too much of the\r\n     elixir of life--A little strangeness between us--Sunshine\r\n     will always rest on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe central event of 1856 was the return from Lisbon and Madeira of my\r\nmother and sisters. Measuring time, as boys do (very sensibly), not by\r\nthe regulated pace of minutes, but by the vast spaces covered by desire,\r\nit appeared to me, for some decades, that they had been absent in those\r\nregions for years--two years at least; and I was astonished and almost\r\nincredulous when dates seemed to prove that the interval had been six or\r\neight months only. It was long enough.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the previous spring my father made two or three little\r\nexcursions of a few days or a week or so in various directions, commonly\r\nconvoyed by Bright or Bennoch, who were most enterprising on his behalf,\r\nfeeling much the same sort of ambition to show him all possible of\r\nEngland and leading English folk that a young housekeeper feels to show\r\nher visiting school-friend her connubial dwelling and its arrangements,\r\nand to take her up in the nursery and exhibit the children. Had my\r\nfather improved all his opportunities he would have seen a great deal,\r\nbut the consulate would have been administered by the clerks. He took\r\ntrips through Scotland and the north of England, and south to London and\r\nthe environs; dined at the Milton Club and elsewhere, visited the\r\nHouses of Parliament, spent a day with Martin Farquhar Tupper, author\r\nof Proverbial Philosophy, and still was not remarkably absent from the\r\ndingy little office down by the docks, or from the euchre games in Mrs.\r\nBlodgett's smoking-room. For the most part, I did not accompany him\r\non these excursions, being occupied in Liverpool with my pursuit of\r\nuniversal culture; yet not so much occupied as to prevent me from\r\nfeeling insolvent while he was away, and rich as Aladdin when he got\r\nback. For his part, he struggled with low spirits caused by anxiety lest\r\nthe next mail from Portugal should bring ill news of the beloved invalid\r\nthere (instead of the cheerful news which always did come); his real\r\nlife was suspended until she should return. Partings between persons\r\nwho love each other seem to be absolute loss of being; but that being\r\nrevives, with a new spiritual strength, when all partings are over.\r\n\r\nOf the people whom he met on these sallies, I saw some, either then or\r\nlater: Disraeli, Douglas Jerrold, Charles Reade, Tom Taylor, Bailey,\r\nthe author of that once-famous philosophic poem, \"Festus\"; Samuel Carter\r\nHall, and a few more. Disraeli, in 1856, had already been chancellor of\r\nthe exchequer and leader of the house, and was to hold the same offices\r\nagain two years later. He had written all but two of his novels, and had\r\nmarried the excellent but not outwardly attractive lady who did so\r\nmuch to sustain him in his career. At a dinner of persons eminent in\r\npolitical life, about this juncture, Mr. and Mrs. Disraeli were present,\r\nand also Bernal Osborne, a personage more remarkable for cleverness\r\nand aggressiveness, in the things of statesmanship, than for political\r\nloyalty or for a sense of his obligations to his associates. This\r\ngentleman had drunk a good deal of wine at dinner, and had sat next to\r\nMrs. Disraeli; when the ladies had left the table he burst out, with\r\nthat British brutality which often passes for wit, \"I say, Disraeli,\r\nwhat on earth did you marry that woman for?\" All talk was hushed by this\r\nastounding query, and everybody looked at the sallow and grim figure\r\nto whom it was addressed. Disraeli for some moments played with his\r\nwineglass, apparently unmoved; then he slowly lifted his extraordinary\r\nblack, glittering eyes to those of his questioner. \"Partly for a\r\nreason,\" he said, measuring his words in the silence, \"which you will\r\nnever be capable of understanding--gratitude!\" The answer meant much for\r\nboth of them; it was never forgotten, and it extinguished the clever and\r\naggressive personage. It was ill crossing swords with Disraeli.\r\n\r\nDouglas Jerrold was at the height of his fame and success in this year;\r\nhe died, I think, the year following, at the age of fifty-four. He was\r\nvery popular during his later lifetime, but he seems to have just missed\r\nthose qualities of the humorist which insure immortality; he is little\r\nmore than a name to this generation. He was the son of an actor, and\r\nhad himself been on the stage; indeed, he had tried several things,\r\nincluding a short service as midshipman in his Majesty's navy. He wrote\r\nsome two-score plays, and was a contributor to Punch from its outset;\r\nthere are several books to his credit; and he edited Lloyd's Weekly\r\nNewspaper, which was first called by his own name. But people who\r\nhave read or heard of nothing else of his, have heard of or read \"Mrs.\r\nCaudle's Curtain Lectures.\" Douglas Jerrold, however, is by no means\r\nfully pictured by anything which he wrote; his charm and qualities\r\ncame out in personal intercourse. Nor does the mere quotation of his\r\nbrightnesses do him justice; you had to hear and see him say them in\r\norder to understand them or him. He was rather a short man, with a short\r\nneck and thick shoulders, much bent, and thick, black hair, turning\r\ngray. His features were striking and pleasing; he had large, clear,\r\nprominent, expressive black eyes, and in these eyes, and in his\r\nwhimsical, sensitive mouth, he lived and uttered himself. They took all\r\nthe bitterness and sting out of whatever he might say. When he was\r\nabout to launch one of his witticisms, he fixed his eyes intently on his\r\ninterlocutor, as if to call his attention to the good thing coming, and\r\nto ask his enjoyment of it, quite apart from such application to himself\r\nas it might have. It was impossible to meet this look and to resent\r\nwhatever might go with it. Thus a friend of his, who wished to write\r\ntelling books but could not quite do it, came to him in haste one day\r\nand exclaimed, aggrievedly, \"Look here, Douglas, is this true that was\r\ntold me--that you said my last book was the worst I'd ever written?\"\r\nDouglas gazed earnestly into the flushed and troubled face, and said,\r\nin his softest tones, \"Oh no, my dear fellow, that isn't what I said at\r\nall; what I did say was that it was the worst book anybody ever wrote.\"\r\nSuch a retort, so delivered, could not but placate even an outraged\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nOf Charles Reade my father saw little, and was not impressed by what he\r\nsaw; but Reade, writing of him to my sister Una, five-and-twenty years\r\nafter, said, \"Your father had the most magnificent eye that I ever\r\nsaw in a human head.\" Reade was just past forty at the time he met my\r\nfather, and had just published _It Is Never Too Late to Mend_--the\r\nfirst of his great series of reform novels. Christie Johnstone and\r\nPeg Woffington were very clever, and written with immense vigor and\r\nkeenness, but did not give the measure of the man. I doubt if my father\r\nhad as yet read any of them; but later he was very fond of Reade's\r\nwritings. Certainly he could not but have been moved by The Cloister and\r\nthe Hearth, the greatest and most beautiful of all historical novels. He\r\nsaw in him only a tall, athletic, light-haired man with blue eyes. I\r\nwas more fortunate. I not only came to know Reade in 1879, but also\r\nknew several persons who knew him intimately and loved and admired him\r\nprodigiously; they were all in one story about him. He was then still\r\ntall and athletic, but his wavy hair and beard were gray; his face was\r\none of the most sensitive men's faces I ever saw, and his forehead was\r\nstraight and fine, full of observation and humor; his eyes were by turns\r\ntender and sparkling. There was a great deal of the feminine in Reade,\r\ntogether with his robust and aggressive masculinity. The fault of his\r\nhead was its lack of depth; there was not much distance from the ear to\r\nthe nostril, and the backhead was deficient. It was high above. There\r\nwas a discord or incongruity in his nature, which made his life not\r\nwhat could be called a happy one. He had the impulses of the radical and\r\nreformer, but not the iron or the impassivity which would have enabled\r\nhim to endure unmoved the attacks of conservatism and ignorance. He\r\nkicked against the pricks and suffered for it. He was passionate,\r\nimpatient, and extreme; but what a lovely, irresistible genius! He was\r\nnever a society figure, and withdrew more and more from personal contact\r\nwith people; but he kept up to the last the ardor of his attack upon the\r\nabuses of civilization--or what he deemed to be such. He fell into\r\nsome errors, but they were as nothing to the good he effected even in\r\nexternal conditions; and the happiness and benefit he brought to tens of\r\nthousands of readers by the fire, pathos, fun, sweetness, and--dramatic\r\nanimation of his stories, and by the nobility and lovableness of many\r\nof the characters drawn in them, are immeasurable, and will touch us and\r\nabide with us again when the welter of the present transition state has\r\npassed. His devotion to the drama injured his style as a novelist, and\r\nalso led him to adopt a sort of staccato manner of construction and\r\nstatement which sometimes makes us smile. But upon the ground proper to\r\nhis genius Reade had no rival. A true and full biography of him, by a\r\nman bold enough and broad enough to write it, would be a stirring book.\r\n\r\nBailey, the amiable mystical poet, whom my father mildly liked, was\r\nanother man my glimpses of whom came at a date much later than this.\r\nHe was a small, placid, gently beaming little philosopher, with a large\r\nbeard and an oval brow, and though he wrote several things besides\r\n\"Festus,\" they never detached themselves in the public mind from the\r\ngeneral theme of that production. Bailey himself seemed finally to have\r\nrecognized this, and he spent his later years (he lived to a great age)\r\nin issuing continually fresh editions of his book, with expansions and\r\nlater thoughts, until it got to be a sort of philosophical library in\r\nitself. He appeared in society in order to give his admirers opportunity\r\nto offer up their grateful homage, and to settle for them all questions\r\nrelative to the meaning of man and of religion. No misgivings troubled\r\nhim; his smile was as an unintermittent summer noonday. He was\r\naccompanied by his wife, with whom he seemed to be, as Tennyson\r\nsays, \"twinned, like horse's ear and eye.\" She relieved him from the\r\nembarrassing necessity of saying illuminative and eulogistic things\r\nabout himself and his great work. The book, upon its first publication,\r\nwas really read by appreciable numbers of persons; later, I think,\r\n\"Festus Bailey\" came to be, to the general mind, an amusing kind of\r\nappanage of his own work, which was now taken as read, but ceased to\r\nhave readers. How happy a little imperviousness may make a good man!\r\n\r\nTom Taylor, the dramatist, Punch contributor, and society wit, I\r\nremember only as a pale face and a black beard. His wit had something\r\nof a professional tang. There are many like him in club-land and hanging\r\nabout the stage; they catch up and remember all the satirical sayings,\r\nthe comicalities, and quips that they hear, and they maintain a sort\r\nof factory for the production of puns. Their repartee explodes like an\r\nAmerican boy's string of toy crackers, and involves, to set it going,\r\nno greater intellectual effort. They are not, in their first state, less\r\nintelligent than the common run of men--rather the contrary; but as\r\nsoon as they have gone so far as to acquire a reputation for wit, their\r\noutput begins to betray that sad, perfunctory quality which we find in\r\nwound-up music-boxes, and that mechanical rattle makes us forget that\r\nthey ever had brains. However, Tom Taylor, with his century of plays and\r\nadaptations--among them \"Our American Cousin,\" which the genius of\r\nan actor, if not its own merit, made memorable--should not be deemed\r\nunworthy of the reputation which, in his time and place, he won. He was\r\nat his best when, stimulated by applause and a good dinner, he portrayed\r\npersons and things with a kind of laughable extravagance, in the mode\r\nintroduced by Dickens. Men of his ilk grow more easily in our soil than\r\nin the English, and are much less regarded.\r\n\r\nHenry Stevens--\"the man of libraries,\" as my father calls him--was a\r\nNew-Englander, born in Vermont; he took betimes to books, came abroad,\r\nand was employed by the British Museum in getting together Americana,\r\nand by various collectors as an agent to procure books, and in these\r\ninnocent pursuits his amiable life was passed. He had a pleasing gift of\r\ndrollery, which made his companionship acceptable at stag-parties and\r\nin the smoking-room of the clubs, and he had also a fund of special\r\ninformation on literary subjects which was often of value. I met him\r\nin after-life--twenty-five years after--and age had not altered him,\r\nthough, perhaps, custom had somewhat staled his variety. He was of\r\nmedium stature, dark haired and bearded. With him was often seen the\r\negregious Mr. Pecksniff (as Samuel Carter Hall was commonly known to\r\nhis acquaintances since the publication of Martin Chuzzlewit ten\r\nyears before). Hall was a genuine comedy figure. Such oily and voluble\r\nsanctimoniousness needed no modification to be fitted to appear before\r\nthe footlights in satirical drama. He might be called an ingenuous\r\nhypocrite, an artless humbug, a veracious liar, so obviously were\r\nthe traits indicated innate and organic in him rather than acquired.\r\nDickens, after all, missed some of the finer shades of the character;\r\nthere can be little doubt that Hall was in his own private contemplation\r\nas shining an object of moral perfection as he portrayed himself before\r\nothers. His perversity was of the spirit, not of the letter, and thus\r\nescaped his own recognition. His indecency and falsehood were in his\r\nsoul, but not in his consciousness; so that he paraded them at the very\r\nmoment that he was claiming for himself all that was their opposite.\r\nNo one who knew him took him seriously, but admired the ability of his\r\nperformance, and so well was he understood that he did little or no\r\nharm beyond the venting of a spite here and there and the boring of his\r\nauditors after the absurdity of him became tedious. Self-worshippers\r\nof the _os-rotundus_ sort are seldom otherwise mischievous. He may be\r\nsufficiently illustrated by two anecdotes.\r\n\r\nThey both occurred at a dinner where I was a guest, and Bennoch sat at\r\nthe head of the table. Hall sat at Bennoch's left hand, and my place was\r\nnext to Hall's. The old gentleman--he was at this period panoplied\r\nin the dignity of a full suit of snow-white hair, and that unctuous\r\nsolemnity and simpering self-complacency of visage and demeanor which\r\nwere inflamed rather than abated by years--began the evening by telling\r\nin sesquipedalian language a long tale of an alleged adventure of his\r\nwith my father, which, inasmuch as there was no point to it, need not\r\nbe rehearsed here; but I noticed that Bennoch was for some reason hugely\r\ndiverted by it, and found difficulty in keeping his hilarity within due\r\nbounds of decorum, Hall's tone being all the while of the most earnest\r\ngravity. Later I took occasion to ask Bennoch the secret of his mirth;\r\nwas the tale a fiction? \"Not a bit of it,\" Bennoch replied; \"it's every\r\nword of it true; but what tickled me was that it was myself and not Hall\r\nwho was in the adventure with your father; but Hall has been telling it\r\nthis way for twenty years past, and has long since come to believe that\r\nhis lie is the truth.\" So ended the first lesson.\r\n\r\nThe second was administered shortly before the company dispersed.\r\nMr. Hall again got the floor to deliver one of his more formal moral\r\nhomilies. \"And, my dear friends--my very dear friends,\" he went\r\non, resting his finger-ends upon the table, and inclining his body\r\naffectionately towards his auditors, \"may I, as an old man--I think the\r\noldest of any of you here present--conclude by asking your indulgence\r\nfor an illustration from the personal experience and custom of one who\r\nmay, I think--who at least has ever striven to be, a humble Christian\r\ngentleman--may I, my dear friends, cite this simple example of what I\r\nhave been attempting to inculcate from my own personal practice, and\r\nthat of my very dear and valued wife, Mrs. Hall? It has for very many\r\nyears been our constant habit, before seeking rest at night, to kneel\r\ndown together at our bedside, and to implore, together, the Divine\r\nblessing upon the efforts and labors of the foregoing day. And before\r\noffering up that petition to the Throne of Grace, my friends \"--here\r\nthe orator's voice vibrated a little with emotion--\"we have ever been\r\nsedulous to ask each other, and to question our own hearts, as to\r\nwhether, during that day, some human fellow-creature had been made\r\nbetter, or happier, because we had lived. And very seldom has it\r\nhappened--very seldom, indeed, my dear friends, has it happened--that\r\nwe were unable to say to ourselves, and to each other, that, during\r\nthat day, some fellow-creature, if not more than one, had had cause for\r\nthankfulness because we had lived. And now I will beg of you, my dear\r\nfriends,\" added Mr. Hall, producing his large, white pocket-handkerchief\r\nand patting his eyes with it, \"to pardon a personal allusion, made in\r\nfulness of heart and brotherly feeling, and if there be found in it\r\nanything calculated to assist any of you towards a right comprehension\r\nof our Christian responsibilities towards our fellow-man, I entreat that\r\nyou take it into your hearts and bosoms, and may it be sanctified unto\r\nyou. I have done.\"\r\n\r\nThis report may be relied upon as substantially accurate, for the\r\nreporter made a note of the apologue and exhortation soon afterwards.\r\nMrs. Hall, like her husband, was of Irish birth, and an agreeable\r\nand clever woman. They were both born in 1800, and died, she in her\r\neighty-second, he in his ninetieth year. He remained the same Hall to\r\nthe very end of his long chapter, and really, if no one was the better\r\nbecause he had lived, I don't know that any one was the worse, in the\r\nlong run, either; and there have been Pecksniffs of whom as much could\r\nhardly be affirmed. There is, however, an anecdote of Hall which my\r\nfather tells, and seems to have credited; if it be true, it would appear\r\nthat once at least in his life he could hardly have implored the Throne\r\nof Grace for a blessing on the deeds of the day. \"He told me,\" writes my\r\nfather, \"(laughing at the folly of the affair, but, nevertheless, fully\r\nappreciating his own chivalry) how he and Charles Lever, about ten years\r\nsince, had been on the point of fighting a duel. The quarrel was made\r\nup, however, and they parted good friends, Lever returning to Ireland,\r\nwhence Mr. Hall's challenge had summoned him.\" I suspect good Mr. Hall\r\nmust have once more appropriated somebody else's adventure; it was not\r\nin the heat of youth that the bloody-minded and unchristian episode is\r\nsupposed to have occurred, but when Mr. Hall was in his forty-seventh\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nDurham, the sculptor, was a lifelong friend of Bennoch's, and was often\r\nin my father's company, and he manifested a friendly feeling towards my\r\nfather's son long afterwards. He was a man of medium height, compactly\r\nbuilt, with slightly curling hair, and a sympathetic, abstracted\r\nexpression of countenance. He was at this time making a bust of Queen\r\nVictoria, and he told us that it was contrary to court etiquette for her\r\nMajesty, during these sittings, to address herself directly to him,\r\nor, of course, for him directly to address her; they must communicate\r\nthrough the medium of the lady-in-waiting. The Queen, however, said\r\nDurham, sometimes broke through this rule, and so did the sculptor,\r\nthe democracy of art, it would seem, enabling them to surmount the\r\nobligation to filter through the mind of a third person all such remarks\r\nas they might wish to make to each other. Durham also said that when\r\nthe bust was nearly finished the Queen proposed that a considerable\r\nthickness of the clay should be removed from the model, which was done.\r\nThe bust, as an ideal work, was thereby much improved, but the likeness\r\nto her Majesty was correspondingly diminished. Years afterwards I\r\nwas talking with W. G. Wills, the painter and dramatist, a delightful\r\nIrishman of the most incorrigibly republican and bohemian type. He had,\r\na little while before, been giving lessons in painting to the Princess\r\nLouise, who married the Marquis of Lorne, and who was, herself,\r\nexceptionally emancipated for a royal personage. One day, said Wills\r\n(telling the story quite innocently), the Princess was prevented from\r\ncoming as usual to his studio, and he received a message from Windsor\r\nCastle, where the Princess and the Queen were staying, from the Queen's\r\nsecretary, commanding his presence there to give the Princess her\r\nlesson, and to spend the night. This would be regarded by the ordinary\r\nBritish subject not only as an order to be instantly and unhesitatingly\r\nobeyed, but as a high honor and distinction. \"But the fact is,\" said\r\nWills, with his easy smile, \"I'd promised to be at my friend\r\nCorkran's reception that evening, and, of course, I couldn't think of\r\ndisappointing him; there was no time to write, so I just sent a telegram\r\nto the castle saying I was engaged.\" Probably English society history\r\ndoes not contain a parallel to this piece of audacity, and one would\r\nhave liked to see the face of the private secretary of her Majesty\r\nwhen he opened the telegram. But Wills could not be made to recognize\r\nanything singular in the affair.\r\n\r\nCommenting in one of his private note-books, at this time, upon the\r\nsubject of modern sculpture in general, my father utters one of his\r\nunregenerate opinions. \"It seems to me,\" he says, \"time to leave off\r\nsculpturing men and women naked; such statues mean nothing, and might as\r\nwell bear one name as another; they belong to the same category as the\r\nideal portraits in books of beauty or in the windows of print-shops.\r\nThe art does not naturally belong to this age, and the exercise of it,\r\nI think, had better be confined to manufacture of marble fireplaces.\"\r\nAs we shall see, he modified this radical view before he left Italy; but\r\nthere is some ground of truth in it, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nHere is another bit of art criticism. He has been giving a detailed\r\ndescription of the sitting-room in one of our lodgings, and of the\r\nobjects contained in it, evidently as a part of his general practice to\r\nrecord the minor facts of English life, to serve as a background for the\r\nEnglish romance he hoped to write afterwards. \"On the mantle-piece,\" he\r\nwrites, \"are two little glass vases, and over it a looking-glass (not\r\nflattering to the beholder), and above hangs a colored view of some lake\r\nor seashore, and on each side a cheap colored print of Prince Albert\r\nand one of Queen Victoria. And, really, I have seen no picture, bust,\r\nor statue of her Majesty which I feel to be so good a likeness as this\r\ncheap print. You see the whole line of Guelphs in it--fair, blue-eyed,\r\nshallow-brained, commonplace, yet with a simple kind of heartiness and\r\ntruth that make one somewhat good-natured towards them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must see Dickens before I leave England,\" he wrote, commenting upon\r\nthe various tales he heard of him from henchmen and critics; but he\r\nnever did see him, nor Thackeray either, whom he perhaps wished still\r\nmore to meet. Thackeray visited America while we were abroad; and when\r\nDickens came to Boston to read, my father was dead. Nor did he see\r\nBulwer, an apostrophe by whom he quotes: \"Oh, that somebody would invent\r\na new sin, that I might go in for it!\" Tennyson he saw, but did not\r\nspeak with him. He sat at table, on one occasion, with Macaulay,\r\nand remarked upon the superiority over his portraits of his actual\r\nappearance. He made the acquaintance, which ripened into friendship,\r\nin Italy, of Robert Browning and his wife, and of Coventry Patmore, the\r\nauthor of \"The Angel in the House,\" a poem which he greatly liked. But,\r\nupon the whole, he came in contact with the higher class of literary\r\nmen in England less than with others, whom he was less likely to find\r\nsympathetic.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, when I had accompanied him to the consulate, there\r\nentered a tall, active man, very well dressed, with black, thick-curling\r\nhair and keen, blue eyes. He seemed under thirty years of age, but had\r\nthe self-confident manner of a man of the world, and a great\r\nbriskness of demeanor and speech. He sat down and began to tell of his\r\nexperiences; he had been all over the world, and knew everything about\r\nthe world's affairs, even the secrets of courts and the coming movements\r\nof international politics. He was a striking, handsome, indomitable\r\nfigure, and aggressively American. When he went away, he left with my\r\nfather a book which he had written, with an engraved portrait of\r\nthe author for frontispiece. This volume, faded and shelf-worn, but\r\napparently unread, bound in the execrable taste of a generation and a\r\nhalf ago, I recently found among my father's volumes. It bore on the\r\ntitle-page the dashing signature of George Francis Train. Train saw\r\nthings in the large--in their cosmic relations; from us he was going\r\nforth to make a fortune compared with which that of Monte Cristo would\r\nbe a trifle. He did make fortunes, I believe; but there seems to have\r\nbeen in his blood a little too much of the elixir of life--more than he\r\ncould thoroughly digest. His development was arrested, or was continued\r\non lines which carried him away from practical contact with that world\r\nwhich he believed he held in the hollow of his hand. My father suspected\r\nhis soundness; but in 1856 there seemed to be no height to which he\r\nmight not rise. The spiritual steam-engine in him, however, somehow got\r\nuncoupled from the mass of the machinery of human affairs, and has\r\nbeen plying in vacua, so to say, ever since. On the 9th of June came\r\na telegram from Southampton; my mother and sisters had arrived from\r\nMadeira. My father and I left Liverpool the next day, feeling that our\r\ntroubles were over. In the afternoon we alighted at the little seaport\r\nand took a cab to the Castle Hotel, close to the water. My father, with\r\na face full of light, sprang up-stairs to the room in which my mother\r\nawaited him; I found myself with my sisters and Fannie Wrigley, the\r\nfaithful nurse and companion who had accompanied them on their travels.\r\nHow tall and mature Una was! What a big girl baby Rose had become! There\r\nwas a little strangeness between us, but great good-will; we felt that\r\nthere were a great many explanations to be made. In a few minutes I was\r\ncalled up-stairs to my mother. At the first glance she seemed smaller\r\nthan formerly; her face appeared a little different from my memory of\r\nit; I was overcome by an odd shyness. She smiled and held out her arms;\r\nthen I saw my beloved mother, and a great passion of affection poured\r\nthrough me and swept me to her. I was whole again, and indescribably\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nThere was never such another heavenly room as that parlor in the Castle\r\nHotel; never another hotel so delightful, or another town to be compared\r\nwith Southampton. I was united to all I loved there, and in my thoughts\r\nsunshine will always rest on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\n     Talked familiarly with kings and queens--Half-witted girl\r\n     who giggled all the time--It gnawed me terribly--A Scotch\r\n     terrier named Towsey--A sentiment of diplomatic etiquette--\r\n     London as a physical entity--Ladies in low-necked dresses--\r\n     An elderly man like a garden-spider--Into the bowels of the\r\n     earth--The inner luminousness of genius--Isolated and tragic\r\n     situation--\"Ate ever man such a morsel before!\"--The great,\r\n     wild, mysterious Borrow--Her skeleton, huddled, dry, and\r\n     awful--\"Ma'am, you expose yourself!\"--Plane, spokeshave,\r\n     gouge, and chisel--\"I-passed-the-Lightning\"--Parallel-O-\r\n     grams-A graduate of Antioch--\"Continual cursing\"--A\r\n     catastrophe--\"Troubles are a sociable sisterhood\"--\"In truth\r\n     I was very sorry\"--He had dreamed wide--awake of these\r\n     things--A friend of Emerson and Henry James--Embarked at\r\n     Folkestone for France.\r\n\r\nWe spent our first reunited week at the Castle Hotel, which was founded\r\non an ancient castle wall, or part of it; traces of it were shown to\r\nguests. The harbor lapped the sea-wall in front; the Isle of Wight,\r\nwhite-ramparted, gleamed through the haze in the offing. I suppose,\r\nduring that week, we were enough employed in telling one another our\r\nhistories during our separation; and naturally that of my mother and\r\nsisters filled the larger space. They had brought home words and phrases\r\nin a foreign tongue, which made me feel very ignorant; they had talked\r\nfamiliarly with kings and queens; they had had exciting experiences in\r\nMadeira; they brought with them photographs and colored prints of people\r\nand places, unlike anything that I had seen. My mother, who was an\r\nunsurpassed narrator of events, gave us wonderful and vivid accounts of\r\nall they had seen and done, which I so completely assimilated that to\r\nthis day I could repeat a great deal of them; my father listened with\r\neyes like stars (as my mother would have said), and with a smile in the\r\ncorners of his mouth. It was glorious weather all the time, or so it\r\nseems to have been to me. My sisters and I renewed our acquaintance,\r\nand found one another none the worse. Nobody called on us except a Mrs.\r\nHume, with whom a stay of a fortnight was projected; she kept a girls'\r\nschool, and, this being vacation, she would take us as boarders. We\r\nwere starved there, as only a pinching, English, thin-bread-and-butter\r\nhousekeeper can starve people; and my sisters and I had for our playmate\r\na half-witted girl who was staying over the vacation, and who giggled\r\nall the time. Mrs. Hume had aroused my enthusiasm by telling me that\r\nthere were endless sea-anemones along the coast; but Providence seemed\r\nhostile to my sea-anemone proclivities; for it turned out that what Mrs.\r\nHume understood by sea-anemones was a small, white-flowering weed\r\nthat grew on the low bluff beside the water. I never told her my\r\ndisappointment, imagining that it would distress her; but it gnawed me\r\nterribly, and she did not merit such forbearance.\r\n\r\nWe would much better have stayed at the hotel, only that they charged us\r\nfourteen dollars a day, which was considered exorbitant in those days.\r\nThere were seven of us, including Fanny, the nurse. What an age, when\r\ntwo dollars a head was exorbitant! What Mrs. Hume charged us I know not,\r\nbut it is only just to admit that it must have been a good deal less\r\nthan one hundred dollars a week; though, again, it must not be forgotten\r\nthat translucent bread-and-butter is not expensive. We were sent there,\r\nI suppose, in order to remind us that this was still the world that we\r\nwere living in, after all, and not yet Paradise. We came out from her\r\nsobered and chastened, but cheerful still; and meanwhile we visited\r\nStonehenge and other local things of beauty or interest. Then Mr.\r\nBennoch (who, to tell the truth, had introduced Mrs. Hume to us) invited\r\nus to spend a month at his house in Blackheath, while he and his wife\r\nwere making a little tour in Germany, and we arrived at this agreeable\r\nrefuge during the first half of July. My father records that he was as\r\nhappy there as he had ever been since leaving his native land. It was\r\na pleasant little house, in a semi-countrified spot, and it contained,\r\nbesides the usual furniture proper to an English gentleman and his wife\r\nof moderate fortune, a little Scotch terrier named Towsey, who commanded\r\nmuch of the attention of us children, and one day inadvertently bit my\r\nthumb; and I carry the scar, for remembrance, to this day.\r\n\r\nMany well-known persons passed across our stage here; and London,\r\nwith all its wonders, was at our doors, the wide expanse of its\r\nsmoke-piercing towers visible in our distance. All the while my father\r\nkept the official part of himself at Liverpool, where his consular\r\nduties still claimed his attention; he went and came between Mrs.\r\nBlodgett's and Black-heath. The popularity of the incomparable\r\nboarding-house in Duke Street had continued to increase, and he was\r\nobliged to bestow himself in a small room at the back of the building,\r\nwhich was reputed to be haunted by the spirit of one of his predecessors\r\nin office, who had not only died in it, but had often experienced there\r\nthe terrors of delirium tremens; but the ghost, perhaps from a sentiment\r\nof diplomatic etiquette, never showed itself to my father. Or it may\r\nhave been that the real self of him being in Blackheath, what remained\r\nwas not sufficient to be conscious of a spiritual presence. He came and\r\nwent, like sunlight on a partly cloudy day. I recollect taking a walk\r\nover the Heath at evening with him and the doctor who was attending my\r\nmother; Mr. Bennoch was with us; it must have been just before he\r\nand his wife went to the Continent. After walking some distance (the\r\ngentlemen chatting together, and I gambolling on ahead) we came to the\r\nsummit of a low rise, from which we beheld London, flung out, all its\r\ngloomy length, before us; and in all my thoughts of London as a physical\r\nentity the impression then received of it returns to me. It lay vast,\r\nlow, and obscure in front of the dull red of the sunset, with dim\r\nlights twinkling dispersedly throughout it, and the dome of St. Paul's\r\ndoubtfully defining itself above the level. There is no other general\r\nview of London to be compared with this, seen under those conditions.\r\nSoon after, we came to some ridges and mounds, which, said Bennoch,\r\nmarked the place where were buried the heaps of the slain of some great\r\nprehistoric battle--one, at least, which must have taken place while\r\nthe Romans yet ruled Britain. It was a noble scene for such an antique\r\nconflict, when man met man, foot to foot and hand to hand, with sword\r\nand spear. My mind was full of King Arthur and his Round-Table knights\r\nof the Pendragonship, and I doubted not that their mightiest fight had\r\nbeen fought here.\r\n\r\nThere were many walks in London itself. One day, going west along the\r\nStrand, we found ourselves drawn into the midst of a vast crowd near\r\nCharing Cross; some royal function was in progress. Threading our\r\nway slowly through the press, we saw a troop of horsemen in steel\r\nbreastplates, with nodding plumes on their helmets, and drawn swords\r\ncarried upright on their thighs--the famous Horse Guards; and farther\r\non we began to see carriages with highly ornamental coachmen and footmen\r\npassing in dilatory procession; within them were glimpses of ladies in\r\nlow-necked dresses, feathers in their hair, and their necks sparkling\r\nwith jewels.\r\n\r\nAt length we turned off towards the north, and by-and-by were entering a\r\nhuge building of gray stone, with tall pillars in front of it, which my\r\nfather told me was the British Museum. What a place for a boy! Endless\r\nhalls of statues; enormous saloons filled with glass-cases of shells;\r\ncases of innumerable birds; acres of butterflies and other insects;\r\nstrange objects which I did not understand--magic globes of shining\r\ncrystal, enormous masses of iron which were said to have fallen from the\r\nsky; vases and jewels; and finally, at the farther end of a corridor,\r\na small door, softly opening, disclosed a circular room of stupendous\r\nproportions, domed above, the curving walls filled with myriads of\r\nbooks. In the centre was a circular arrangement of desks, and in the\r\nmidst of these an elderly man, like a garden-spider in his web; but it\r\nwas his duty to feed, not devour, the human flies who sat or walked to\r\nand fro with literary meat gathered from all over the world. It was my\r\nfirst vision of a great library.\r\n\r\nAnother time we went--all of us, I think--to the Tower of London. I\r\nvibrated with joy at the spectacle of the array of figures in armor, and\r\npicked out, a score of times, the suit I would most gladly choose to put\r\non. Here were St. George, King Arthur, Sir Scudamour, Sir Lancelot--all\r\nbut their living faces and their knightly deeds! Then I found myself\r\nimmured in dungeons with walls twenty feet thick, darksome and\r\nlow-browed, with tiny windows, and some of them bearing on their stones\r\nstrange inscriptions, cut there by captives who were nevermore to issue\r\nthence, save to the block. Here the great Raleigh had been confined;\r\nhere, the lovable, rash-tempered Essex; here, the noble Sir Henry Vane,\r\nwho had once trod the rocky coast of my own New England. Everywhere\r\nstood on the watch or paced about the Beef-eaters in their brilliant\r\nfifteenth-century motley. I have never since then passed the portals of\r\nthe Tower, nor seen again the incomparable gleam of the Koh-i-noor--if\r\nit were, indeed, the Koh-i-noor that I saw, and not a glass model\r\nfoisted on my innocence.\r\n\r\nAgain, I followed my father down many flights of steps, into the bowels\r\nof the earth; but there were lights there, and presently we passed\r\nthrough a sort of turnstile, and saw lengthening out before us two\r\nendless open tubes, of diameter twice or thrice the height of a man,\r\nwith people walking in them, and disappearing in their interminable\r\nperspective. We, too, entered and began to traverse them, and after we\r\nhad proceeded about half-way my father told me that the river Thames was\r\nflowing over our heads, with its ships on its surface, and its fishes,\r\nand its bottom of mud and gravel--under all these this illuminated\r\ncorridor, with ourselves breathing and seeing and walking therein. Would\r\nwe ever again behold the upper world and the sky? The atmosphere was not\r\npleasant, and I was glad to find myself climbing up another flight of\r\nstairs and emerging on the other side of the river, which we had crossed\r\non foot, dry-shod.\r\n\r\nOf the famous personages of this epoch I did not see much; only I\r\nremember that a woman who seemed taller than common, dressed in a dark\r\nsilk gown, and moving with a certain air of composure, as if she knew\r\nshe was right, and yet meant to be considerate of others; whose features\r\nwere plain, and whose voice had a resonance and modulation unlike other\r\nvoices, was spoken of in my hearing as bearing a name which I had heard\r\noften, and which had a glamour for my boyish imagination--Jenny Lind.\r\nThere also rises before me the dark, courteous visage and urbane figure\r\nof Monckton Milnes; but there was something more and better than mere\r\ncourtesy and urbanity about him; the inner luminousness, I suppose, of\r\nwhat was nearly genius, and would have been altogether that but for\r\nthe swaddling-clothes of rank and society which hampered it. My father\r\nthought him like Longfellow; but there was an English materialism about\r\nMilnes from which the American poet was free. Henry James told me\r\nlong afterwards a comical tale of how, being left to browse in Mimes's\r\nlibrary one afternoon, he strayed into an alcove of pretty and inviting\r\nvolumes, in sweet bindings, mellowed by age, and was presently terrified\r\nby the discovery that he was enmeshed in the toils of what bibliophiles\r\nterm, I think, \"Facetiae\"--of which Milnes had a collection unmatched\r\namong private book-owners. Milnes's social method was The Breakfast,\r\nwhich he employed constantly, and nothing could be more agreeable--in\r\nEngland; we cannot acclimate it here, because we work in the afternoon.\r\nOf Miss Bacon, of the Bacon-wrote-Shakespeare theory, I saw nothing, but\r\nheard much, for a time, in our family circle; my father seemed to have\r\nlittle doubt of her insanity, and absolute certainty of the despotic\r\nattitude she adopted towards her supporters, which was far more\r\nintolerable than the rancor which she visited on those who disregarded\r\nher monomaniacal convictions. My mother, out of pure compassion, I\r\nbelieve, for the isolated and tragic situation in which the poor woman\r\nhad placed herself, tried with all her might to read the book and\r\nbelieve the theory; she would take up the mass of manuscript night after\r\nnight, and wade through it with that truly saintlike self-abnegation\r\nwhich characterized her, occasionally, too, reading out a passage\r\nwhich struck her. The result was that she could not bring herself to\r\ndisbelieve in Shakespeare, but she conceived a higher admiration than\r\never of Bacon; and that, too, was characteristic of her.\r\n\r\nWe made several incursions into the surrounding country. One was to\r\nNewstead, where, from the talkative landlady of the hotel, we heard\r\nendless stories about Byron and his wife; this was before Mrs. Harriet\r\nBeecher Stowe published her well-intended but preposterous volume about\r\nthe poet. Then we visited Oxford, and were shown about by the mayor of\r\nthe town, and by Mr. S. C. Hall, and were at one moment bathed in the\r\nlight emanating from Lady Waldegrave, of which interview my father, in\r\nhis private note-book, speaks thus: \"Lady Waldegrave appeared; whereupon\r\nMr. Speirs (the mayor) instantly was transfigured and transformed--like\r\nthe English snob he is, worthy man--and looked humbler than he does in\r\nthe presence of his Maker, and so respectful and so blest that it was\r\npleasant to behold him. Nevertheless, she is but a brummagem kind of\r\ncountess, after all, being the daughter of Braham, the famous singer,\r\nand married first to an illegitimate son of an Earl Waldegrave--not\r\nto the legitimate son and possessor of the title (who was her first\r\nlove)--and after the death of these two to the present old Mr. Harcourt.\r\nShe is still in her summer, even if it be waning, a lady of fresh\r\ncomplexion and light hair, a Jewish nose (to which her descent entitles\r\nher), a kind and generous expression of face, but an officer-like\r\nfigure and bearing. There seems to be a peculiarity of manner, a lack\r\nof simplicity, a self-consciousness, which I suspect would not have been\r\nseen in a lady born to the rank which she has attained. But, anyhow, she\r\nwas kind to all of us, and complimentary to me, and she showed us\r\nsome curious things which had formerly made part of Horace Walpole's\r\ncollection at Twickenham--a missal, for instance, splendidly bound and\r\nbeset with jewels, but of such value as no setting could increase, for\r\nit was exquisitely illuminated by the own hand of Raphael himself! I\r\nheld the precious volume in my grasp, though I fancy (and so does my\r\nwife) that the countess scarcely thought it safe out of her own hands.\r\nIn truth, I suppose any virtuoso would steal it if he could; and Lady\r\nWaldegrave has reason to look to the safe-keeping of her treasures, as\r\nshe exemplified by telling us a story while exhibiting a little silver\r\ncase. This once contained a portion of the heart of Louis XII. (how\r\nthe devil it was got I know not), and she was showing it one day to\r\nStrickland, Dean of Westminster, when, to her horror and astonishment,\r\nshe saw him open the case and swallow the royal heart! Ate ever man such\r\na morsel before! It was a symptom of insanity in the dean, and I believe\r\nhe is since dead, insane.\" It was after this interview with the countess\r\nthat we visited Old Boston, and when my parents told old Mr. Porter\r\nabout the missal his jolly eyes took on a far-away expression, as if he\r\nsaw himself in the delightful act of purloining it, \"in obedience to a\r\nhigher law than that which he broke.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who, of all writing men, was nearest to my heart in those years,\r\nand long after, was George Borrow, whose book, Lavengro, I had already\r\nbegun to read. The publication of this work had made him famous, though\r\nhe had written two or three volumes before that, and was at this\r\nvery time bringing out its sequel, Romany Rye. But Borrow was never a\r\nhanger-on of British society, and we never saw him. One day, however,\r\nMr. Martineau turned up, and, the conversation chancing to turn on\r\nBorrow, he said that he and George had been school-mates, and that the\r\nlatter's gypsy proclivities had given him a singular influence over\r\nother boys. Finally, he had persuaded half a dozen of them to run away\r\nfrom the school and lead a life of freedom and adventure on the roads\r\nand lanes of England. To this part of Mr. Martineau's tale I lent an\r\neager and sympathetic ear; but the narrator was lowered in my estimation\r\nby the confession that he himself had not been a member of Borrow's\r\nparty. He went on to say that the fugitives had been pursued and\r\ncaptured and brought back to bondage; and upon Borrow's admitting that\r\nhe had been the instigator of the adventure, he was sentenced to be\r\nflogged, and that it was on the back of this very Martineau that he\r\nhad been \"horsed\" to undergo the punishment! Imagine the great, wild,\r\nmysterious Borrow mounted upon the ascetic and precise cleric that\r\nwas to be, and the pedagogue laying on! My father asked concerning the\r\naccuracy of some of Borrow's statements in his books, to which Martineau\r\nreplied that he could not be entirely depended on; not that he meant to\r\nmislead or misrepresent, but his imagination, or some eccentricity in\r\nhis mental equipment, caused him occasionally to depart from literal\r\nfact. Very possibly; but Borrow's imagination brought him much nearer to\r\nessential truth than adherence to what they supposed to be literal facts\r\ncould bring most men.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting expeditions of this epoch--though I cannot\r\nfix the exact date--was to an old English country-seat, built in the\r\ntime of Henry VIII., or earlier, and added to from age to age since\r\nthen, until now it presented an irregularity and incongruousness of\r\nplan which rendered it an interminable maze of delight to us children\r\nwandering through it. We were taken in charge by the children of the\r\nfamily, of whom there were no fewer than fourteen, all boys, with only\r\ntwelve years between the eldest and the youngest (some of them being\r\ntwins). Hide-and-seek at once suggested itself as the proper game for\r\nthe circumstances, but no set game was needed; the house itself was\r\nHide-and-seek House; you could not go twenty feet without getting lost,\r\nand the walls of many of the rooms had sliding panels, and passages\r\nthrough the thickness of them, and even staircases, so that when one\r\nof us went into a room there was no predicting where he would come out.\r\nFinally they brought us to a black, oaken door with a great, black\r\nlock on it, and bolts at the top and bottom; it was near the end of a\r\ncorridor, in the oldest wing of the building. The door, in addition to\r\nits native massiveness, was studded with great nails, and there were\r\nbands of iron or steel crossing it horizontally. When we proposed\r\nto enter, our friends informed us that this door had been closed one\r\nhundred and eighty years before and had never been opened since then,\r\nand that it had shut in a young woman who, for some reason, had become\r\nvery objectionable or dangerous to other persons concerned. The windows\r\nof the room, they added, had been walled up at the same time; so there\r\nthis unhappy creature slowly starved to death in pitch darkness. There,\r\ndoubtless, within a few feet of where we stood, lay her skeleton,\r\nhuddled, dry, and awful in the garments she wore in life. Sometimes,\r\ntoo, by listening long at the key-hole, you could hear a faint sound,\r\nlike a human groan; but it was probably merely the sigh of the draught\r\nthrough the aperture. This story so horrified me and froze my young\r\nblood that the fancies of Mrs. Radcliffe and Edgar Allan Poe seemed like\r\nfrivolous chatter beside it.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of September the Bennochs returned from the Continent,\r\nand we made ready to transfer ourselves to the lodgings in Southport\r\nwhich had been prepared for us. Bennoch, who was soon to meet with the\r\ncrucial calamity of his career, was in abounding spirits, and he told my\r\nfather an anecdote of our friend Grace Greenwood, which is recorded in\r\none of the private note-books. \"Grace, Bennoch says,\" he writes, \"was\r\ninvited to a private reading of Shakespeare by Charles Kemble, and she\r\nthought it behooved her to manifest her good taste and depth of feeling\r\nby going into hysterics and finally fainting away upon the floor.\r\nHereupon Charles Kemble looked up from his book and addressed himself to\r\nher sternly and severely. 'Ma'am,' said he, 'this won't do! Ma'am, you\r\ndisturb the company! Ma'am, you expose yourself!'\"\r\n\r\nThis last hit had the desired effect, for poor Grace probably thought\r\nthat her drapery had not adjusted itself as it ought, and that perhaps\r\nshe was really exposing more of her charms than were good to be imparted\r\nto a mixed company. So she came to herself in a hurry, and, after a few\r\nflutterings, subsided into a decorous listener. Bennoch says he had this\r\nstory from an eye-witness, and that he fully believes it; and I think it\r\nnot impossible that, betwixt downright humbug and a morbid exaggeration\r\nof her own emotions, Grace may have been betrayed into this awful fix. I\r\nwonder how she survived it!\r\n\r\nAt Southport we remained from the middle of September to the following\r\nJuly, 1857. In addition to my aquarium, I was deeply involved in the\r\nship-building industry, and, the more efficiently to carry out my\r\ndesigns, was apprenticed to a carpenter, an elderly, shirt-sleeved,\r\ngray-bearded man, who under a stern aspect concealed a warm and\r\ncompanionable heart. There were boys at the beach who had little models\r\nof cutters and yachts, and I conceived the project of making a sail-boat\r\nfor myself. My father seems to have thought that some practical\r\nacquaintance with the use of carpenter's tools would do me no harm--by\r\nadding a knowledge of a handicraft to my other culture--so he arranged\r\nwith Mr. Chubbuck that I should attend his work-shop for instruction.\r\nMr. Chubbuck, accordingly, gave me thorough lessons in the mysteries\r\nof the plane, the spokeshave, the gouge, and the chisel, and finally\r\npresented me with a block of white pine eighteen inches long and\r\nnine wide, and I set to work on my sloop. He oversaw my labors, but\r\nconscientiously abstained from taking a hand in them himself; the\r\nmodel gradually took shape, and there began to appear a bluff-bowed,\r\nbroad-beamed craft, a good deal resembling the French fishing-boats\r\nwhich I afterwards saw off the harbors of Calais and Havre. The outside\r\nform being done, I entered upon the delightful and exciting work of\r\nhollowing it out with the gouge, narrowly avoiding, more than once,\r\npiercing through from the hold into the outer world. But the little ship\r\nbecame more buoyant every day, and finally stood ready for her\r\ndeck. This I prepared by planing down a bit of plank to the proper\r\nthickness--or thinness--and carefully fitted it into its place, with\r\ncompanionways fore and aft, covered with hatches made to slide in\r\ngrooves. Next, with chisel, spoke-shave, and sand-paper, I prepared\r\nthe mast and fitted a top-mast to it, and secured it in its place with\r\nshrouds and stays of fine, waxed fishing-line. The boom and gaff\r\nwere then put in place, and Fanny Wrigley (who had aforetime made my\r\npasteboard armor and helmet) now made me a main-sail, top-sail, and jib\r\nout of the most delicate linen, beautifully hemmed, and a tiny American\r\nflag to hoist to the peak. It only remained to paint her; I was provided\r\nwith three delectable cans of oil-paint, and I gave her a bright-green\r\nunder-body, a black upper-body, and white port-holes with a narrow red\r\nline running underneath them. Thus decorated, and with her sails\r\nset, she was a splendid object, and the boys with bought models were\r\ndepressed with envy, especially when I called their attention to the\r\nstars and stripes. This boat-building mania of mine had originated while\r\nwe were at Mrs. Blodgett's, where the captain of one of the clippers\r\ngave me a beautiful model of his own ship, fully rigged, and perfect\r\nin every detail; only it would not sail, being solid. Concerning\r\nhis clipper, by-the-way, I once overheard a bit of dialogue in Mrs.\r\nBlodgett's smoking-room between my captain and another. \"Do you mean to\r\nsay,\" demanded the latter, \"that you passed the Lightning?\" To which\r\nmy captain replied, in measured and impressive tones,\r\n\"I-passed-the-Lightning!\" The Lightning, it may be remarked, was at that\r\ntime considered the queen of the Atlantic passage; she had made the trip\r\nbetween Boston and Liverpool in ten days. But my captain had once shown\r\nher his heels, nevertheless. I wanted to christen my sloop The Sea\r\nEagle, but my father laughed so much at this name that I gave it up;\r\nhe suggested The Chub, The Mud-Pout, and other ignoble titles, which I\r\nindignantly rejected, and what her name finally was I have forgotten.\r\nShe afforded me immense happiness.\r\n\r\nAt Southport we had a queer little governess, Miss Brown, who came to us\r\nhighly recommended both as to her personal character and for ability to\r\ninstruct us in arithmetic and geometry, geography, English composition,\r\nand the rudiments of French. She was barely five feet in height, and as\r\nthin and dry as an insect; and although her personal character came up\r\nto any eulogium that could be pronounced upon it, her ignorance of the\r\n\"branches\" specified was, if possible, greater than our own. She was\r\nparticularly perplexed by geometry; she aroused our hilarity by always\r\ncalling a parallelogram a parallel-O-gram, with a strong emphasis on\r\nthe penultimate syllable; and she spent several days repeating over to\r\nherself, with a mystified countenance, the famous words, \"The square\r\nof the hypothenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two legs.\"\r\nWhat were legs of a triangle, and how, if there were any, could they be\r\nsquare? She never solved this enigma; and although we liked little Miss\r\nBrown very much, she speedily lost all shadow of control over us; we\r\ntreated her as a sort of inferior sister, and would never be serious.\r\n\"English governess\" became for us a synonym for an amiable little\r\nnonentity who knew nothing; and I was surprised to learn, later, from\r\nthe early works of Miss Rhoda Broughton, that they could be beautiful\r\nand intelligent. Miss Brown did not outlast our residence in Southport.\r\n\r\nFrom Southport we removed to Manchester, and thence, after exhausting\r\nthe exposition, to Leamington, where we spent September and October of\r\n1857. We expected to proceed direct from Leamington to France and Italy,\r\nbut we were destined to be delayed in London till January of 1858.\r\n\r\nIt was in Leamington that we were joined by Ada Shepard. She was a\r\ngraduate of Antioch, a men-and-women's college in Ohio, renowned in its\r\nday, when all manner of improvements in the human race were anticipated\r\nfrom educating the sexes together. Miss Shepard had got a very\r\nthorough education there, so that she knew as much as a professor,\r\nincluding--what would be of especial service to us--a knowledge of most\r\nof the modern European languages. What seemed, no doubt, of even more\r\nimportance to her was her betrothal to her classmate, Henry Clay Badger;\r\nthey were to be married on her return to America. Meanwhile, as a matter\r\nof mutual convenience (which rapidly became mutual pleasure), she was\r\nto act as governess of us children and accompany our travels. Ada (as my\r\nfather and mother presently called her) was then about twenty-two years\r\nold; she had injured her constitution--never robust--by addiction to\r\nlearning, and had incidentally imbibed from the atmosphere of Antioch\r\nall the women's-rights fads and other advanced opinions of the day.\r\nThese, however, affected mainly the region of her intellect; in her\r\nnature she was a simple, affectionate, straightforward American maiden,\r\nwith the little weaknesses and foibles appertaining to that estate;\r\nand it was curious to observe the frequent conflicts between these\r\nspontaneous characteristics and her determination to live up to her\r\nacquired views. But she was fresh-hearted and happy then, full of\r\ninterest in the wonders and beauties of the Old World; she wrote,\r\nweekly, long, criss-crossed letters, in a running hand, home to\r\n\"Clay,\" the king of men; and periodically received, with an illuminated\r\ncountenance, thick letters with an American foreign postage-stamp on\r\nthem, which she would shut herself into her chamber to devour in secret.\r\nShe was a little over the medium height, with a blue-eyed face, not\r\nbeautiful, but gentle and expressive, and wearing her flaxen hair in\r\nlong curls on each side of her pale cheeks. She entered upon her duties\r\nas governess with energy and good-will, and we soon found that an\r\nAmerican governess was a very different thing from an English one\r\n(barring the Rhoda Broughton sort). Her special aim at present was to\r\nbring us forward in the French and Italian languages. We had already,\r\nin Manchester, made some acquaintance with the books of the celebrated\r\nOllendorff; and my father, who knew Latin well, had taught me something\r\nof Latin grammar, which aided me in my Italian studies. I liked Latin,\r\nparticularly as he taught it to me, and it probably amused him, though\r\nit must also often have tried his patience to teach me. I had a certain\r\naptitude for the spirit of the language, but was much too prone to leap\r\nat conclusions in my translations. I did not like to look out words\r\nin the lexicon, and the result was sometimes queer. Thus, there was\r\na sentence in some Latin author describing the manner in which the\r\nScythians were wont to perform their journeys; relays of fresh horses\r\nwould be provided at fixed intervals, and thus they were enabled to\r\ntraverse immense distances at full speed. The words used were, I think,\r\nas follows: \"Itaque conficiunt iter continuo cursu.\" When I translated\r\nthese, \"So they came to the end of their journey with continual\r\ncursing,\" I was astonished to see my father burst into inextinguishable\r\nlaughter, falling back in his chair and throwing up his feet in the\r\nebullience of his mirth. I heard a good deal of that \"continual cursing\"\r\nfor some years after, and I believe the incident prompted me to pay\r\nstricter attention to the dictionary than I might otherwise have done.\r\n\r\nHowever, what with Ollendorff and Miss Shepard, we regarded ourselves,\r\nby the time we were ready to set out for the Continent, as being in fair\r\ncondition to ask about trains and to order dinner. My mother, indeed,\r\nhad from her youth spoken French and Spanish fluently, but not Italian;\r\nmy father, though he read these languages easily enough, never attained\r\nany proficiency in talking them. After he had wound up his consular\r\naffairs, about the first week in October, we left Leamington and took\r\nthe train for a few days in London, stopping at lodgings in Great\r\nRussell Street, close to the British Museum.\r\n\r\nWe were first delayed by friendly concern for the catastrophe which at\r\nthis moment befell Mr. Bennoch. He was a wholesale silk merchant, but\r\nhis literary and social tendencies had probably led him to trust too\r\nmuch to the judgment and ability of his partners; at all events, on his\r\nreturn from Germany he had found the affairs of his establishment much\r\ninvolved, and he was now gazetted a bankrupt. In the England of those\r\ndays bankruptcy was no joke, still less the avenue to fortune which it\r\nis sometimes thought to be in other countries; and a man who had built\r\nup his business during twenty years by conscientious and honorable work,\r\nand who was sensitively proud of his commercial honor, was for a time\r\nalmost overwhelmed by the disaster. My father felt the most tender\r\nsympathy and grief for him, and we were additionally depressed by a\r\nreport, circumstantially detailed (but which proved to be unfounded),\r\nthat Mrs. Bennoch had died in childbirth--they had never had children.\r\n\"Troubles,\" commented my father \"(as I myself have experienced, and\r\nmany others before me), are a sociable sisterhood; they love to\r\ncome hand-in-hand, or sometimes, even, to come side by side, with\r\nlong-looked-for and hoped-for good-fortune.\" He was doubtless thinking\r\nof that dark and bright period when his mother lay dying in his house in\r\nSalem and The Scarlet Letter was waiting to be born.\r\n\r\nA few days later he went by appointment to Bennoch's office in Wood\r\nStreet, Cheapside, and I will quote the account of that interview for\r\nthe light it casts on the characters of the two friends:\r\n\r\n\"When I inquired for Bennoch, in the warehouse where two or three clerks\r\nseemed to be taking account of stock, a boy asked me to write my name on\r\na slip of paper, and took it into his peculiar office. Then appeared Mr.\r\nRiggs, the junior partner, looking haggard and anxious, poor man. He is\r\nsomewhat low of stature, and slightly deformed, and I fancied that he\r\nfelt the disgrace and trouble more on that account. But he greeted me\r\nin a friendly way, though rather awkwardly, and asked me to sit down a\r\nlittle while in his own apartment, where he left me. I sat a good while,\r\nreading an old number of Blackwood's Magazine, a pile of which I found\r\non the desk, together with some well-worn ledgers and papers, that\r\nlooked as if they had been pulled out of drawers and pigeon-holes and\r\ndusty corners, and were not there in the regular course of business.\r\nBy-and-by Mr. Riggs reappeared, and, telling me that I must lunch with\r\nthem, conducted me up-stairs, and through entries and passages where I\r\nhad been more than once before, but could not have found my way again\r\nthrough those extensive premises; and everywhere the packages of silk\r\nwere piled up and ranged on shelves, in paper boxes, and otherwise--a\r\nrich stock, but which had brought ruin with it. At last we came to that\r\npleasant drawing-room, hung with a picture or two, where I remember\r\nenjoying the hospitality of the firm, with their clerks all at the\r\ntable, and thinking that this was a genuine scene of the old life\r\nof London City, when the master used to feed his 'prentices at a\r\npatriarchal board. After all, the room still looked cheerful enough; and\r\nthere was a good fire, and the table was laid for four. In two or three\r\nminutes Bennoch came in--not with that broad, warm, lustrous presence\r\nthat used to gladden me in our past encounters--not with all that\r\npresence, at least--though still he was not less than a very genial\r\nman, partially be-dimmed. He looked paler, it seemed to me, thinner,\r\nand rather smaller, but nevertheless he smiled at greeting me, more\r\nbrightly, I suspect, than I smiled back at him, for in truth I was very\r\nsorry. Mr. Twentyman, the middle partner, now came in, and appeared as\r\nmuch or more depressed than his fellows in misfortune, and to bear it\r\nwith a greater degree of English incommunicativeness and reserve. But\r\nhe, too, met me hospitably, and I and these three poor ruined men sat\r\ndown to dinner--a good dinner enough, by-the-bye, and such as ruined men\r\nneed not be ashamed to eat, since they must needs eat something. It was\r\nroast beef, and a boiled apple-pudding, and--which I was glad to see, my\r\nheart being heavy--a decanter of sherry and another of port, remnants\r\nof a stock which, I suppose, will not be replenished. They ate pretty\r\nfairly, but scarcely like Englishmen, and drank a reasonable quantity,\r\nbut not as if their hearts were in it, or as if the liquor went to their\r\nhearts and gladdened them. I gathered from them a strong idea of what\r\ncommercial failure means to English merchants--utter ruin, present and\r\nprospective, and obliterating all the successful past; how little chance\r\nthey have of ever getting up again; how they feel that they must plod\r\nheavily onward under a burden of disgrace--poor men and hopeless men\r\nand men forever ashamed. I doubt whether any future prosperity (which\r\nis unlikely enough to come to them) could ever compensate them for this\r\nmisfortune, or make them, to their own consciousness, the men they were.\r\nThey will be like a woman who has once lost her chastity: no after-life\r\nof virtue will take out the stain. It is not so in America, nor ought it\r\nto be so here; but they said themselves they would never again have put\r\nunreserved confidence in a man who had been bankrupt, and they could\r\nnot but apply the same severe rule to their own case. I was touched by\r\nnothing more than by their sorrowful patience, without any fierceness\r\nagainst Providence or against mankind, or disposition to find fault with\r\nanything but their own imprudence; and there was a simple dignity, too,\r\nin their not assuming the aspect of stoicism. I could really have shed\r\ntears for them, to see how like men and Christians they let the tears\r\ncome to their own eyes. This is the true way to do; a man ought not to\r\nbe too proud to let his eyes be moistened in the presence of God and\r\nof a friend. They talked of some little annoyances, half laughingly.\r\nBennoch has been dunned for his gas-bill at Blackheath (only a pound or\r\ntwo) and has paid it. Mr. Twentyman seems to have received an insulting\r\nmessage from some creditor. Mr. Riggs spoke of wanting a little money\r\nto pay for some boots. It was very sad, indeed, to see these men of\r\nuncommon energy and ability, all now so helpless, and, from managing\r\ngreat enterprises, involving vast expenditures, reduced almost to reckon\r\nthe silver in their pockets. Bennoch and I sat by the fireside a little\r\nwhile after his partners had left the room, and then he told me that he\r\nblamed himself, as holding the principal position in the firm, for not\r\nhaving exercised a stronger controlling influence over their operations.\r\nThe two other men had recently gone into speculations, of the extent of\r\nwhich he had not been fully aware, and he found the liabilities of\r\nthe firm very much greater than he had expected. He said this without\r\nbitterness, and said it not to the world, but only to a friend. I am\r\nexceedingly sorry for him; it is such a changed life that he must\r\nlead hereafter, and with none of the objects before him which he might\r\nheretofore have hoped to grasp. No doubt he was ambitious of civic, and\r\neven of broader public distinction; and not unreasonably so, having the\r\ngift of ready and impressive speech, and a behavior among men that\r\nwins them, and a tact in the management of affairs, and many-sided\r\nand never-tiring activity. To be a member of Parliament--to be lord\r\nmayor--whatever an eminent merchant of the world's metropolis may\r\nbe--beyond question he had dreamed wide-awake of these things. And now\r\nfate itself could hardly accomplish them, if ever so favorably inclined.\r\nHe has to begin life over again, as he began it twenty-five years ago,\r\nonly under infinite disadvantages, and with so much of his working-day\r\ngone forever.\r\n\r\n\"At parting, I spoke of his going to America; but he appeared to think\r\nthat there would be little hope for him there. Indeed, I should be loath\r\nto see him transplanted thither myself, away from the warm, cheerful,\r\njuicy English life into our drier and less genial sphere; he is a good\r\nguest among us, but might not do well to live with us.\"\r\n\r\nBennoch was never lord mayor or member of Parliament; I do not know\r\nthat he cared to be either; but he lived to repay all his creditors with\r\ninterest, and to become once more a man in easy circumstances, honored\r\nand trusted as well as loved by all who knew him, and active and happy\r\nin all good works to the end of his days. There could be no keeping down\r\nsuch a man, even in England; and when I knew him, in after years, he was\r\nthe Bennoch of yore, grown mellow and wise.\r\n\r\nWe were now ready for the Continent, when symptoms of some malady began\r\nto manifest themselves among the younger persons of the family, which\r\npresently culminated in an attack of the measles. It was six weeks\r\nbefore we were in condition to take the road again. Meanwhile we were\r\nprofessionally attended by Dr. J. J. Garth Wilkinson, a homoeopathist, a\r\nfriend of Emerson and of Henry James the elder, a student of Swedenborg,\r\nand, at this particular juncture, interested in spiritualism. In a\r\nbiography of my father and mother, which I published in 1884, I alluded\r\nto this latter circumstance, and some time afterwards I received from\r\nhis wife a letter which I take this opportunity to print:\r\n\r\n\"4 FINCHLEY ROAD, N. W., June 19, 1885.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,--May I beg of you in any future edition of the Life of your\r\nfather to leave out your passage upon my husband and spiritualism? He\r\nis utterly opposed to it now. On Mr. Home's first appearance in England\r\nvery remarkable things did occur; but from the first I was a most\r\ndecided opponent, and by my firmness I have kept all I know and love\r\nfrom having anything to do with it for at least thirty-five years. You\r\nmay imagine, therefore, I feel hurt at seeing so spiritually minded\r\na man as my husband really is to be mixed up with so evil a thing as\r\nspiritism. You will pardon a faithful wife her just appreciation of\r\nhis character. One other author took the liberty of using his name in a\r\nsimilar way, and I wrote to him also. Believe me,\r\n\r\n\"Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\"E. A. WILKINSON.\"\r\n\r\nThe good doctor and his wife are now, I believe, both of them in the\r\nworld where good spirits go, and no doubt they have long ere this found\r\nout all about the rights and wrongs of spiritism and other matters, but\r\nthere is no doubt that at the time of my father's acquaintance with him\r\nthe doctor was a very earnest supporter of the cult. He was a man of\r\nmark and of brains and of most lovable personal quality; he wrote books\r\nwell worth deep study; Emerson speaks of \"the long Atlantic roll\" of\r\ntheir style. Henry James named his third son after him--the gentle and\r\nbrave \"Wilkie\" James, who was my school-mate at Sanborn's school in\r\nConcord after our return to America, and who was wounded in the fight at\r\nFort Fisher while leading his negro soldiers to the assault. But for the\r\npresent, Dr. Wilkinson, so far as we children knew him, was a delightful\r\nand impressive physician, who helped us through our measles in masterly\r\nstyle, under all the disadvantages of a foggy London winter.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of January, 1858--we were ready to start the next\r\nday--Bennoch came to take tea with us and bid us farewell. \"He keeps up\r\na manly front,\" writes my father, \"and an aspect of cheerfulness, though\r\nit is easy to see that he is a very different man from the joyous one\r\nwhom I knew a few months since; and whatever may be his future\r\nfortune, he will never get all the sunshine back again. There is a\r\nmore determinate shadow on him now, I think, than immediately after his\r\nmisfortunes; the old, equable truth weighs down upon him, and makes him\r\nsensible that the good days of his life have probably all been enjoyed,\r\nand that the rest is likely to be endurance, not enjoyment. His temper\r\nis still sweet and warm, yet, I half fancy, not wholly unacidulated by\r\nhis troubles--but now I have written it, I decide that it is not so,\r\nand blame myself for surmising it. But it seems most unnatural that\r\nso buoyant and expansive a character should have fallen into the\r\nhelplessness of commercial misfortune; it is most grievous to hear his\r\nmanly and cheerful allusions to it, and even his jokes upon it; as,\r\nfor example, when we suggested how pleasant it would be to have him\r\naccompany us to Paris, and he jestingly spoke of the personal restraint\r\nunder which he now lived. On his departure, Julian and I walked a good\r\nway down Oxford Street and Holborn with him, and I took leave of him\r\nwith the truest wishes for his welfare.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day we embarked at Folkestone for France, and our new life\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n     Old-Homesickness--The Ideal and the Real--A beautiful but\r\n     perilous woman with a past--The Garden of Eden a Montreal\r\n     ice-palace--Confused mountain of family luggage--Poplars for\r\n     lances--Miraculous crimson comforters--Rivers of human gore--\r\n     Curling mustachios and nothing to do--Odd behavior of grown\r\n     people--Venus, the populace, and the MacDaniels--The\r\n     happiness to die in Paris--Lived alone with her\r\n     constellations--\"O'Brien's Belt\"--A hotel of peregrinations--\r\n     Sitting up late--Attempted assassination--My murderer--An\r\n     old passion reawakened--Italian shells and mediaeval sea-\r\n     anemones--If you were in the Garden of Eden--An umbrella\r\n     full of napoleons--Was Byron an Esquimau?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo doubt my father had grown fond of England during his four years'\r\nresidence there. Except for its profits he had not, indeed, liked the\r\nconsular work; but even that had given zest to his several excursions\r\nfrom it, which were in themselves edifying and enjoyable. The glamour of\r\ntradition, too, had wrought upon him, and he had made friends and formed\r\nassociations. Such influences, outwardly gentle and unexacting, take\r\ndeeper hold of the soul than we are at the time aware. They show\r\ntheir strength only when we test them by removing ourselves from their\r\nphysical sphere.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, though he looked forward with pleasure to leaving England\r\nfor the Continent, he was no sooner on the farther side of the narrow\r\nseas than he began to be conscious of discomfort, which was only partly\r\nbodily or sensible. An unacknowledged homesickness afflicted him--an\r\nOld-Homesickness, rather than a yearning for America. He may have\r\nimagined that it was America that he wanted, but, when at last we\r\nreturned there, he still looked back towards England. As an ideal,\r\nAmerica was still, and always, foremost in his heart; and his death was\r\nhastened partly by his misgiving, caused by the civil war, lest her best\r\ndays were past. But something there was in England that touched a deep,\r\nkindred chord in him which responded to nothing else. America might\r\nbe his ideal home, but his real home was England, and thus he found\r\nhimself, in the end, with no home at all outside of the boundaries of\r\nhis domestic circle. A subconscious perception of this predicament,\r\ncombined with his gradually failing health, led him to say, in a moment\r\nof frank self-communion, \"Since this earthly life is to come to an end,\r\nI do not try to be contented, but weary of it while it lasts.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that Rome, vehemently as at first he rebelled against it,\r\ncame at last to hold a power over him. Rome, if you give it opportunity,\r\nsubtly fastens its grasp upon both brain and heart, and claims\r\nsympathies which are as undeniable as our human nature itself. Yet there\r\nis something morbid in our love for the mystic city, like a passion for\r\nsome beautiful but perilous woman with a past--such as Miriam in The\r\nMarble Faun, for example. Only an exceptionally vigorous and healthy\r\nconstitution can risk it without danger. Had my father visited Rome in\r\nhis young manhood, he might have both cared for it less and in a sense\r\nhave enjoyed it more than he did during these latter years of his life.\r\n\r\nBut from the time we left London, and, indeed, a little before that, he\r\nwas never quite himself physically. Our departure was made at the most\r\ninclement moment of a winter season of unusual inclemency; they said (as\r\nthey always do) that no weather to be compared with it had been known\r\nfor twenty years. We got up before dawn in London, and after a dismal\r\nride in the train to Folkestone, where the bitter waves of the English\r\nChannel left edgings of ice on the shingle beach where I went to pick\r\nup shells, we were frost-bitten all our two-hours passage across to\r\nBoulogne, where it became cold in dead earnest, and so continued all\r\nthrough Paris, Lyons, and Marseilles, and down the Mediterranean to\r\nGenoa and Civita Vecchia, and thence up the long, lonely, bandit-haunted\r\nroad to Rome, and in Rome, with exasperating aggravations, right up to\r\nApril, or later. My own first recollection of St. Peter's is that I\r\nslid on the ice near one of the fountains in the piazza of that famous\r\nedifice; and my father did the same, with a savage satisfaction, no\r\ndoubt, at thus proving that everything was what it ought not to be.\r\nEither in London, or at some intermediate point between that and Paris,\r\nhe caught one of the heaviest colds that ever he had; and its feverish\r\nand debilitating effects were still perceptible in May. \"And this is\r\nsunny Italy--and this is genial Rome!\" he wrathfully exclaims. It was\r\nlike looking forward to the Garden of Eden all one's life, and going\r\nto vast trouble and expense to get there, and, on arriving, finding the\r\nrenowned spot to be a sort of Montreal ice-palace. The palaces of Rome\r\nare not naturally fitted to be ice-palaces, and the cold feels all the\r\ncolder in them by consequence.\r\n\r\nBut I am going too fast. The first thing my father did, after getting on\r\nboard the little Channel steamer, was to go down in the cabin and drink\r\na glass of brandy-and-water, hot, with sugar; and he afterwards remarked\r\nthat \"this sea-passage was the only enjoyable part of the day.\" But the\r\nwind cut like a scimitar, and he came on deck occasionally only--as when\r\nI came plunging down the companion-way to tell him, with the pride of a\r\ndiscoverer, that France was broad in sight, and the sun was shining\r\non it. \"Oh!\" exclaimed my mother, looking up from her, pale\r\ndiscomfortableness on a sofa, with that radiant smile of hers, and\r\naddressing poor Miss Shepard, who was still further under the sinister\r\ninfluence of those historic alpine fluctuations which have upset so\r\nmany. \"Oh, Ada, Julian says the sun is shining on France!\" Ada never\r\nstirred. She was the most amiable and philosophic of young ladies; but\r\nif thought could visit her reeling brain at that moment, she probably\r\nwondered why Providence had been so inconsiderate as to sever Britain\r\nfrom its Gallic base in those old geologic periods before man was yet\r\nborn to sea-sickness.\r\n\r\nSunshine on the pale, smooth acclivities of France, and half a dozen\r\nbluff-bowed fishing-boats, pitching to the swell, were all that was\r\nnotable on our trip across; and of Boulogne I remember nothing, except\r\nthe confused mountain of the family luggage on the pier, and afterwards\r\nof its being fed into the baggage-car of the train. Ollendorff abandoned\r\nme thus early in my travels; nor was my father much better off. But Miss\r\nShepard, now restored to life, made amends for her late incompetence\r\nby discoursing with excited French officials with what seemed to me\r\npreternatural intelligence; indeed, I half doubted whether there were\r\nnot some conspiracy to deceive in that torrent of outlandish sounds\r\nwhich she and they were so rapidly pouring forth to one another.\r\nHowever, all turned out well, and there we were, in a compartment of a\r\nFrench railway-train, smelling of stale tobacco, with ineffective zinc\r\nfoot-warmers, and an increasing veil of white frost on the window-panes,\r\nwhich my sisters and myself spent our time in trying to rub off that\r\nFrance might become visible. But the white web was spun again as fast\r\nas we dissipated it, and nothing was to be seen, at all events, but\r\nlong processions of poplars, which interested me only because I imagined\r\nmyself using them as lances in some romantic Spenserian adventure of\r\nknight-errantry--for the spell of that chivalric dream still hung\r\nabout me. So we came to Amiens, a pallid, clean, chilly town, with\r\nhigh-shouldered houses and a tall cathedral, and thence went on to Paris\r\nat five o'clock. It was already dusk, and our transit to the Hotel de\r\nLouvre in crowded cabs, through streets much unlike London, is the sum\r\nof my first impressions of the wonderful city.\r\n\r\nThen, marshalled by princely yet deferential personages in rich\r\ncostumes, we proceeded up staircases and along gilded corridors to a\r\nsuite of sumptuous apartments, with many wax candles in candelabra,\r\nwhich were immediately lighted by an attendant, and their lustre was\r\nreflected from tall mirrors which panelled the rooms. The furniture\r\nthus revealed was costly and elegant, but hardly comfortable to an\r\nEnglish-bred sense; the ceilings were painted, the floor rich with\r\nglowing carpets. But the glow of color was not answered by a glow of any\r\nother sort; a deadly chill pervaded this palatial place, which fires, as\r\nbig as one's fist, kindled in fireplaces as large as hall bedrooms, did\r\nnothing to dissipate. Hereupon our elders had compassion on us, and,\r\ntaking from the tall, awful bedsteads certain crimson comforters, they\r\nplaced each of us in an easy-chair and tucked the comforters in over us.\r\nThese comforters, covered with crimson silk, were of great thickness,\r\nbut also of extraordinary lightness, and for a few minutes we had\r\nno confidence in their power to thaw us. But they were filled with\r\nswan's-down; and presently a novel and delightful sensation--that of\r\nwarmth--began to steal upon us. It steadily increased, until in quarter\r\nof an hour there might be seen upon our foreheads and noses, which were\r\nthe only parts of us open to view, the beads of perspiration. It was a\r\nmarvellous experience. The memory of the crimson comforters has remained\r\nwith me through life; light as sunset clouds, they accomplished the\r\nmiracle of importing tropic warmth into the circle of the frozen\r\narctic. I think we must have been undressed and night-gowned before this\r\ntreatment; at any rate, I have forgotten how we got to bed, but to bed\r\nwe somehow got, and slept the blessed sleep of childhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning my father, apparently as an accompaniment of his cold,\r\nwas visited by a severe nosebleed; no importance was attached to\r\nit, beyond its preventing him from going forth to superintend the\r\nexamination of our luggage at the custom-house--the mountain having been\r\nregistered through from London. This duty was, therefore, done by Miss\r\nShepard and my mother. The next day, at dinner, the nosebleeding began\r\nagain. \"And thus,\" observed my father, \"my blood must be reckoned among\r\nthe rivers of human gore which have been shed in Paris, and especially\r\nin the Place de la Concorde, where the guillotines used to stand\"--and\r\nwhere our restaurant was. But these bleedings, which came upon him at\r\nseveral junctures during his lifetime, and were uniformly severe and\r\nprolonged, probably had a significance more serious than was supposed.\r\nThe last one occurred not many weeks before his death, and it lasted\r\ntwenty-four hours; he was never the same afterwards. He joked about it\r\nthen, as now, but there was the forewarning of death in it.\r\n\r\nBut that day lies still unsuspected in the future, six years away.\r\nFor the present, we were in splendid Paris, with Napoleon III. in the\r\nTuileries, and Baron Haussmann regnant in the stately streets. For a\r\nweek we went to and fro, admiring and--despite the cold, the occasional\r\nicy rains, and once even a dark fog--delighted. In spirit and in\r\nsubstance, nothing could be more different from London. For my part,\r\nI enjoyed it without reservation; the cold, which depressed my sick\r\nfather, exhilarated me. For Notre Dame, the Tuileries, the Louvre, the\r\nMadeleine, the pictures, and the statues, I cared little or nothing; I\r\nhardly even heeded the column of the Place Vendome or the mighty mass\r\nof the Arc de Triomphe. But the Frenchiness of it all captivated me.\r\nThe throngs in the streets were kaleidoscopic in costume and character:\r\npriests, soldiers, gendarmes, strange figures with turbans and other\r\nOriental accoutrements; women gayly dressed and wearing their dresses\r\nwith an air; men with curling mustachios, and with nothing to do,\r\napparently, but amuse themselves; romantic artists with soft felt hats\r\nand eccentric beards; grotesque figures of poverty in rags and with\r\nominous visages, such as are never seen in London; martial music,\r\nmarching regiments, with gorgeous generals on horseback, with shining\r\nswords; church processions; wedding pageants crowding in and out of\r\nsuperb churches; newspapers, shop-signs, and chatter, all in French,\r\neven down to the babble of the small children. And the background of\r\nthis parade was always the pleasant, light-hued buildings, the majority\r\nof them large and of a certain uniformity of aspect, as if they had been\r\nmade in co-operation, and to look pretty, instead of independently and\r\nincongruously, as in England. These people seemed to be all playing and\r\nprattling; nobody worked; even the shopkeepers held holiday in their\r\nshops. Such was my boyish idea of Paris. Napoleon had been emperor only\r\nfive or six years; he had been married to Eugenie only four or five;\r\nand, so far as one could judge who knew nothing of political coups\r\nd'etat and crimes, he was the right man in the right place. Moreover,\r\nthe French bread was a revelation; it tasted better than cake, and\r\nwas made in loaves six feet long; and the gingerbread, for sale on\r\ninnumerable out-door stalls, was better yet, with quite a new flavor. I\r\nate it as I walked about with my father. He once took a piece himself,\r\nand, said he, \"I desired never to taste any more.\" How odd is,\r\nsometimes, the behavior of grown-up people!\r\n\r\nBut even my father enjoyed the French cookery, though he was in some\r\ndoubt whether it were not a snare of the evil one to lure men to\r\nindulgence. We dined in the banquet-hall of our hotel once or twice\r\nonly; in general we went to neighboring restaurants, where the food was\r\njust as good, but cost less. I was always hungry, but hungrier than ever\r\nin Paris. \"I really think,\" wrote my father, \"that Julian would eat a\r\nwhole sheep.\" In his debilitated state he had little appetite either for\r\ndinners or for works of art; he looked even upon the Venus of Milo with\r\ncoldness. \"It seemed,\" wrote he, speaking of the weather one morning,\r\n\"as if a cold, bitter, sullen agony were interposed between each\r\nseparate atom of our bodies. In all my experience of bad atmospheres,\r\nmethinks I never knew anything so atrocious as this. England has nothing\r\nto compare with it.\" The \"grip\" was a disease unnamed at that epoch,\r\nbut I should suppose that it was very vividly described in the above\r\nsentence. He had the grip, and for nearly six months he saw everything\r\nthrough its medium.\r\n\r\nBesides the Venus and the populace, we saw various particular persons. I\r\nwent with my father to the bank, and saw a clerk give him a long roll\r\nof bright gold coins, done up in blue paper; and we visited, or were\r\nvisited by, a Miss MacDaniel and her mother, two Salem women, \"of plain,\r\nNew England manners and appearance,\" wrote my father, \"and they have\r\nbeen living here for nearly two years. The daughter was formerly at\r\nBrook Farm. The mother suffered so much from seasickness on the passage\r\nthat she is afraid to return to America, and so the daughter is kept\r\nhere against her will, and without enjoyment, and, as I judge, in narrow\r\ncircumstances. It is a singular misfortune. She told me that she had\r\nbeen to the Louvre but twice since her arrival, and did not know Paris\r\nat all.\" This looks like a good theme for Mr. Henry James.\r\n\r\nWe called on the American minister to Paris, Judge John Young Mason,\r\na simple and amiable personage. He was rubicund and stolid, and talked\r\nlike a man with a grievance; but, as my father afterwards remarked, it\r\nwas really Uncle Sam who was the aggrieved party, in being mulcted\r\nof seventeen thousand dollars a year in order that the good old\r\njudge should sleep after dinner in a French armchair. The judge was\r\nanticipating being superseded in his post, but, as it turned out, was\r\nnot driven to seek second-rate employment to support himself in his old\r\nage; he had the happiness to die in Paris the very next year.\r\n\r\nBut the most agreeable of our meetings was with Miss Maria Mitchell, the\r\nastronomer, who, like ourselves, was stopping a few days in Paris on her\r\nway to Rome. She desired the protection of our company on the journey,\r\nthough, as my father remarked, she looked well able to take care of\r\nherself. She was at this time about forty years old; born in Nantucket;\r\nthe plainest, simplest, heartiest of women, with a face browned by the\r\nsun, of which she evidently was accustomed to see as much as of\r\nthe other stars in the heavens. Her mouth was resolute and full of\r\nexpression; but her remarkable feature was her eyes, which were dark and\r\npowerful, and had the kindest and most magnetic look of comradeship\r\nin them. Her dark hair was a little grizzled. She was dressed in plain\r\ngray, and was active and energetic in her movements. She was, as the\r\nworld knows, a woman of unusual intellect and character; but she had\r\nlived alone with her constellations, having little contact with the\r\nworld or practical knowledge of it, so that in many respects she was\r\nstill as much a child as I was, and I immediately knew her for my friend\r\nand playmate and loved her with all my heart. There was a charming\r\nquaintness and innocence about her, and an immense, healthy curiosity\r\nabout this new old world and its contents. She had a great flow of\r\nnative, spontaneous humor, and could say nothing that was not juicy\r\nand poignant. She was old-fashioned, yet full of modern impulses and\r\ntendencies; warmhearted and impulsive, but rich in homely common-sense.\r\nThough bold as a lion, she was, nevertheless, beset with the funniest\r\nfeminine timidities and misgivings, due mainly, I suppose, to her\r\nunfamiliarity with the ways of the world. There was already a friendship\r\nof long standing between her and Miss Shepard, and they did much of\r\ntheir sightseeing during the coming year together, and debated between\r\nthemselves over the statues and pictures. Her talk with us children was\r\nof the fine, countrified, racy quality which we could not resist; and in\r\nthe evenings, as we journeyed along, she told us tales of the stars\r\nand gave us their names. On the steamer going to Genoa, one night, she\r\npointed out to me the constellation Orion, then riding high aloft\r\nin glittering beauty, and I kindly communicated to my parents the\r\ninformation that the three mighty stars were known to men as O'Brien's\r\nBelt. This was added to the ball of jolly as a household word.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: MARIA MITCHELL]\r\n\r\nMiss Mitchell's trunk was contributed to our mountain, when we set\r\nout anew on our pilgrimage, with a result at first deplorable, for the\r\nnumber of our own pieces of luggage being known and registered in the\r\nofficial documents, it turned out, at our first stopping-place, that\r\nthe trunk of our new companion had been substituted for one of our\r\nown, which, of course, was left behind. It was ultimately recovered, I\r\nbelieve, but it seemed as if the entire world of French officialdom had\r\nto be upheaved from its foundations in order to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nOur route lay through Lyons to Marseilles. At Lyons I remember only the\r\nenormous hotel where we slept the first night, with corridors wandering\r\nlike interminable streets, up-stairs and down, turning corners,\r\nextending into vistas, clean-swept, echoing, obscure, lit only by the\r\nglimmering candle borne by our guide. We seemed to be hours on our\r\njourney through these labyrinths; and when at last we reached our rooms,\r\nthey were so cold and so unwarmable that we were fain to journey back\r\nagain, up and down, along and athwart, marching and countermarching past\r\nregiments of closed doors, until at length we attained the region of\r\nthe hotel dining-saloon, where it was at least two or three degrees\r\nless cold than elsewhere. After dinner we had to undertake a third\r\nperegrination to bed, and a fourth the next morning to get our train.\r\nThe rooms of the hotel were on a scale suited to the length of the\r\nconnecting thoroughfares, and the hotel itself stood hard by a great,\r\nempty square with a statue in the middle of it. But the meals were not\r\nof a corresponding amplitude. And I think it was at the railway station\r\nof this town that the loss of the trunk was discovered.\r\n\r\nThe region from Lyons to Marseilles, along the valley of the Rhone, with\r\nthe lower ranges of the Alps on our left hand, was much more picturesque\r\nthan anything France had shown us hitherto. Ancient castles crowned\r\nmany of the lower acclivities; there were villages in the vales, and\r\npresently vineyards and olive groves. The Rhone, blue and swift as its\r\ntraditions demanded, kept us close company much of the way; the whole\r\nrange of country was made for summer, and the wintry conditions under\r\nwhich we saw it seemed all the more improper. It must have been near\r\nmidnight when our train rolled into the station at Marseilles, and my\r\npleasure in \"sitting up late\" had long become stale.\r\n\r\nThe sun shone the next morning, and, being now in the latitude of\r\nFlorence and such places, it could not help being hot, though the shaded\r\nsides of the streets were still icy cold; and most of the streets were\r\nso narrow that there was a great deal of shade. The whole population\r\nseemed to be out-of-doors and collecting in the sun, like flies, a very\r\nanimated and voluble population and of a democratic complexion; the\r\nproportion of poor folks was noticeable, and the number of women, who\r\nseemed to camp out in the squares and market-places, and there gossip\r\nand do their knitting, as other women might at their firesides; but here\r\nthe sun is the only fire. But a good deal of the bustle this morning\r\nwas occasioned by the news from Paris that an attempt to assassinate\r\nNapoleon III. had been made the day before; had we remained one day\r\nlonger in Paris we might have assisted at the spectacle. The Marseilles\r\npeople seemed to take it comfortably; nobody was very sorry that the\r\nattempt had been made, nor very glad that it had not succeeded. It was\r\nsomething to talk about. It was ten years more before the French got\r\nthoroughly used to the nephew of his uncle and decided that he was, upon\r\nthe whole, a good thing; and soon after they lost him. And for a decade\r\nafter Sedan, chatting with the boulevardiers in Paris, they would\r\ncommonly tell me that they wished they had the empire back again.\r\nPerhaps they will have it, some day.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of filth in Marseilles streets and along her\r\nwharves and in the corners of her many public squares; and even our\r\nhotel, the \"Angleterre,\" was anything but clean; it was a tall, old\r\nrookery, from the windows of our rooms in which I looked down into an\r\nopen space between the strange, old buildings, and saw a juggler do his\r\nmarvels on a bit of carpet spread on the pavement, while a woman handed\r\nhim the implements of magic out of a very much travelled and soiled\r\ndeal-box. Later in the day, when the place was deserted, I heedlessly\r\nflung out of the window the contents of a glass of water, and, looking\r\nafter it in its long descent, I was horrified to see approaching a man\r\nof very savage and piratical aspect, with a terrible black beard and a\r\nslouch hat. As luck would have it, the water struck him full on the side\r\nof the face, probably the first time in many a year that he had felt the\r\nimpact of the liquid there. I withdrew my head from the window in alarm,\r\nmingled with the natural joy that a boy cannot help feeling at such a\r\ncatastrophe; and by-and-by, when I felt certain that he must have passed\r\non, I peeped out again, but what were my emotions at beholding him\r\nplanted terribly right under the window where he had been baptized, and\r\nstaring upward with a blood-thirsty expression. I immediately drew back\r\nagain, but too late--our eyes had met, and he had made a threatening\r\ngesture at me. I now felt that a very serious thing had happened, and\r\nthat if I ventured out upon the streets again I should assuredly be\r\nassassinated; that it would be no mere attempt, as in the case of the\r\nEmperor, but a pronounced success. I did not tell my fears to any of\r\nmy family--I had not, to say the truth, informed any of them of\r\nthe incident which had imperilled my life, but I no longer felt any\r\ncuriosity to see more of Marseilles, and was sincerely thankful when I\r\nfound myself, betimes next morning, on board the Calabrese, bound for\r\nGenoa. I never saw my murderer again, but I could make a fair likeness\r\nof him, I believe, to-day. The trip to Genoa, and onward to Civita\r\nVecchia, lasted two or three days, the steamer generally pursuing her\r\ncourse by night and laying up by day.\r\n\r\nThe first morning, soon after sunrise, found us approaching the bay\r\nof Genoa, with the sun rising over the Mediterranean on our right and\r\nthrowing its light upon the curving acclivity on which the city stands.\r\nThe water had a beautiful blue-green color and was wonderfully clear, so\r\nthat, looking down through it over the ship's side, as we glided slowly\r\nto our moorings, I saw sea-weeds and blocks of marble and other marine\r\ncuriosities which reawakened my old passion for aquariums. Indeed, to\r\nbe candid with the reader--as is my study throughout this\r\nnarrative--nothing in Genoa the Superb itself has, I find, remained with\r\nme so distinctly as that glimpse of the floor of the bay through the\r\nclear sea-water. I did not care to go up into the town and see the\r\npalaces and churches; I wanted to stay on the beach and hunt for\r\nshells--Italian shells--and classical or mediaeval sea-anemones. Of\r\ncourse, I had to go up into the town; and I saw, no doubt, the churches\r\nand the palaces, with their rooms radiant with the mellow brilliance of\r\nprecious marbles and painted ceilings, and statues and pictures,\r\nunder the personal conduct of no less an individual than Salvator Rosa\r\nhimself--for that was the name of our guide--and for years afterwards\r\nI never doubted that he was the creator of the paintings which, in Rome\r\nand elsewhere, bore his signature. I say I must have seen these things,\r\nbut in memory I cannot disentangle them from the innumerable similar\r\nobjects which I beheld, later, in other Italian cities; their soft\r\nsplendor and beautiful art could not hold their own for me beside that\r\ncool translucence of the Mediterranean inlet, with its natural marvels\r\ndimly descried as'I bent over the boat's side. It was for that, and not\r\nfor the other, that my heart yearned, and that became a part of me,\r\nall the more, no doubt, that it was denied me. Our aim in the world is\r\nbeauty and happiness; but we are late in learning that they exist in the\r\nwill and imagination, and not in this or that accredited and venerable\r\nthing or circumstance that is mechanically obtruded on our unready\r\nattention. If you were put down in the Garden of Eden, and told that you\r\nmight stay there an hour and no more, what would you do? How would you\r\n\"improve\" your time? Would you run to and fro, and visit the spot where\r\nAdam first stood erect, and the place where he sat when he named the\r\nanimals, and the thymey bank on which he slept while Eve was taking form\r\nfrom his rib, and the tree on which grew the fruit of the knowledge of\r\ngood and evil, and the precise scene of the temptation and the fall, and\r\nthe spot on which stood the altars on which Cain and Abel offered their\r\nsacrifices, and where, presently, wrathful Cain rose up against his\r\nbrother and slew him? Would you make sure of all these set sights in\r\norder that you might reply satisfactorily to the cloud of interviewers\r\nawaiting you outside the Garden? Or would you simply throw yourself down\r\non the grass wherever the angel happened to leave you, and try to see or\r\nto realize or to recall nothing, but passively permit your soul to feel\r\nand experience and grow what way it would, prompted by the inner voice\r\nand guided by the inner light, heedless of what the interviewers were\r\nexpecting and of what duty and obligation and the unique opportunity\r\ndemanded? It is worth thinking about. It may be conceded that there is\r\nsome risk to run.\r\n\r\nI next find myself in a coach, with four horses harnessed to it,\r\ntrundling along the road from Civita Vecchia to Rome; for of Monaco I\r\nrecall nothing, nor of Leghorn; and though we passed within sight of\r\nElba, I saw only a lonely island on our starboard beam. As for the\r\ncoach, it was a necessity, if we would continue our journey, for the\r\nrailroad was still in the future in 1858. The coach-road was not only as\r\nrugged and uneasy as it had been any time during the past three hundred\r\nyears, but it was outrageously infested by banditti; and, indeed, a\r\nrobbery had taken place on it only a week or two before. For miles and\r\nmiles on end it was totally destitute of dwellings, and those that we\r\nsaw might well have been the harboring-places of iniquity. Moreover, we\r\nwere so long delayed in making our start that it was already afternoon\r\nbefore we were under way, and finally one of our horses gave out ere\r\nwe were many miles advanced, compelling us to hobble along for the\r\nremainder of the trip at reduced speed. As the shades of evening began\r\nto fall, we saw at intervals sundry persons lurking along the roadway,\r\nclad in long cloaks and conical hats, with the suggestion of the barrel\r\nof a musket about them, and it is probable that we were preserved from a\r\ntragic fate only by the fortunate accident that we were just behind the\r\nmail-coach and might theoretically have hailed it for help had we been\r\nattacked. Meanwhile, my father, with ostensible pleasantry, suggested\r\nthat we should hide our gold coin (of which we carried a considerable\r\nstore) in various queer, out-of-the-way receptacles. I remember that\r\nan umbrella was filled with a handful or two of the shining pieces, and\r\nstuck with studied carelessness through the straps in the roof of the\r\nvehicle. This was regarded by us children as excellent sport, though I\r\nthink there was a lingering feeling of apprehension in the bottom of\r\nmy soul. My father kept a moderate sum in napoleons in his pockets, so\r\nthat, should the worst happen, the bandits might fancy it was our all.\r\nBut then there was our mountain of luggage, incredibly strapped on the\r\ntop of the conveyance, and behind it, and no reasonable bandits, one\r\nwould suppose, could have failed to be satiated with that. However,\r\nit was written that we were to reach Rome unscathed, albeit long after\r\ndark, and though we did not get past the Porta del Popolo without\r\nsuffering legalized robbery on the part of the custom-house officials.\r\nBut by that time we were so weary, downcast, and chilled that\r\ndepredation and outrage could not rouse or kindle us.\r\n\r\nWe ended, at last, in one of those refrigerator hotels to which our\r\ntravels had made us accustomed, in one of the hollow, dull, untoward\r\ncaverns of which I was presently put to bed and to sleep. \"Oh, Rome, my\r\ncountry, City of the Soul!\" Oh, Byron, were you an Esquimau?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n     Our unpalatial palace--\"Cephas Giovanni\"--She and George\r\n     Combe turned out to be right--A rousing temper--Bright\r\n     Titian hair--\"All that's left of him\"--The pyramidal man of\r\n     destiny--The thoughts of a boy are long, long thoughts--\r\n     Clausilia Bubigunia--Jabez Hogg and the microscope--A\r\n     stupendous surprise--A lifetime in fourteen months--My\r\n     father's jeremiades--\"Thank Heaven, there is such a thing as\r\n     whitewash!\"--\"Terrible lack of variety in the old masters\"--\r\n     \"The brazen trollop that she is!\"--Several distinct phases\r\n     of feeling--Springs of creative imagination roused--The\r\n     Roman fever--A sad book--Effects of the death-blow--The rest\r\n     is silence.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in Rome on the 17th of January, 1858, at eleven o'clock at\r\nnight. After a day or two at Spillman's Hotel, we moved into lodgings in\r\nthe Via Porta Pinciana, the Palazzo Larazani. The street extended just\r\nbelow the ridge of the Pincian Hill, and was not far from the broad\r\nflight of steps mounting upward from the Piazza d' Espagna, on the left\r\nas you go up. In spite of its resounding name, our new dwelling had\r\nnot a palatial aspect. It was of no commanding height or architectural\r\npretensions; a stuccoed edifice, attached on both sides to other\r\nedifices. The street, like other Roman streets, was narrow; it was dirty\r\nlike them, and, like them, was paved with cobble-stones. The place\r\nhad been secured for us by (I think) our friends the Thompsons; Mr.\r\nThompson--the same man who had painted my father's portrait in 1853--had\r\na studio hard by. The Thompsons had been living in Rome for five years\r\nor more, and knew the Roman ropes. They were very comfortable people\r\nto know; indeed, Rome to me would have been a very different and less\r\ndelightful place without them, as will hereafter appear. The family\r\nconsisted of Cephas Giovanni Thompson, the father and artist; his wife\r\nand his two sons and one daughter. \"Cephas Giovanni,\" being\r\ninterpreted, means plain Peter John; and it was said (though, I believe,\r\nunjustifiably) that Peter John had been the names originally given to\r\nThompson by his parents at the baptismal-font, but that his wife, who\r\nwas a notable little woman, a sister of Anna Cora Mowatt, the actress,\r\nwell known in America and England seventy years ago, had persuaded\r\nhim to translate them into Greek and Italian, as more suitable to the\r\nromantic career of an artist of the beautiful. I fancy the story arose\r\nfrom the fact that Mrs. Thompson was a woman who, it was felt, might\r\nimaginably conceive so ambitious a project. She was small, active,\r\nentertaining, clever, and \"spunky,\" as the New-Englanders would have\r\nsaid; indeed, she had a rousing temper, on occasion. Her husband, on\r\nthe other hand, had the mildest, wisely smiling, philosophic air, with a\r\nlow, slow voice, and a beard of patriarchal fashion and size, though as\r\nyet it was a rich brown, with scarcely a thread of silver in it. Brown\r\nand abundant, also, was his hair; he had steady, bright, brown eyes, and\r\nwas rather under the average height of Anglo-Saxon man. But for all this\r\nmild-shining aspect of his, his dark eyebrows were sharply arched, or\r\ngabled rather; and my mother, who had absorbed from her former friend,\r\nGeorge Combe, a faith in the betrayals of phrenology, expressed her\r\nprivate persuasion that good Mr. Thompson had a temper, too. She and\r\nGeorge Combe turned out to be right in this instance, though I am not\r\ngoing to tell the tale of how we happened to be made acquainted with the\r\nfact. Little thunder-storms once in a while occur in human skies as well\r\nas in the meteorological ones; and the atmosphere is afterwards all the\r\nsweeter and softer. No people could be more good, honest, and kind than\r\nthe Thompsons.\r\n\r\nThere was no other artist in Rome who could paint as well as Mr.\r\nThompson. That portrait of my father, to which reference has been made,\r\nwhich now hangs in my house, looks even better, as a painting, to-day\r\nthan it did when it was fresh from his easel. Rubens could not have laid\r\non the colors with more solidity and with truer feeling for the hues of\r\nlife. But the trouble with Thompson was that he had never learned how to\r\ndraw correctly; and this defect appeared to some extent in his portraits\r\nas well as in his figures. The latter were graceful, significant, full\r\nof feeling and character; but they betrayed a weakness of anatomical\r\nknowledge and of perspective. They had not the conventional\r\nincorrectness of the old masters preceding Raphael, but an incorrectness\r\nbelonging personally to Thompson; it was not excessive or conspicuous to\r\nany one, and certainly not to Thompson himself. But his color redeemed\r\nall and made his pictures permanently valuable. He was at this time\r\npainting a picture of Saint Peter being visited by an angel, which\r\nwas rich and beautiful; and he had some sketches of a series based on\r\nShakespeare's Tempest; and standing on one side in the studio was a\r\nglowing figure of a woman in Oriental costume, an odalisque, or\r\nsome such matter, which showed that his sympathy with life was not\r\na restricted one. Later in our acquaintance he fell in love with the\r\nbright Titian hair of my sister Rose, and made a little portrait of her,\r\nwhich was one of his best likenesses, apart from its admirable color; it\r\neven showed the tears in the child's eyes, gathering there by reason of\r\nher antipathy to posing.\r\n\r\nCora Thompson, the daughter, was the most good-natured and\r\nsunny-tempered of girls; she may have been fifteen at this time; she\r\ninherited neither the handsomeness of her father nor the sharp-edged\r\ncleverness of her mother; but she was lovable. Of the two boys, the\r\nyounger was named Hubert; he was about ten years old, small of his age,\r\nand not robust in make or constitution. He was, however, a smart, rather\r\nwitty youth, a little precocious, perhaps, and able to take care of\r\nhimself. Some five and twenty years after the date of which I am now\r\nwriting I was at a large political dinner in New York and was there\r\nintroduced to a Mr. Thompson, who was the commissioner of public works,\r\nand a party boss of no small caliber and power. He was an immense\r\npersonage, physically likewise, weighing fully three hundred pounds,\r\nand, though not apparently advanced in years, a thorough man of the\r\nworld and of municipal politics. After we had conversed for a few\r\nminutes, I was struck by a certain expression about my interlocutor's\r\neyebrows that recalled long-forgotten days and things. I remembered that\r\nhis name was Thompson, and had an impression that his initials were\r\nH. O. \"Are you little Hubert Thompson?\" I suddenly demanded. \"Why, of\r\ncourse I am--all that's left of him!\" he replied, with a laugh. So this\r\nwas the boy whom, a quarter of a century before, I could have held out\r\nat arm's-length. We talked over the old days when we played together\r\nabout the Roman streets and ruins. Nothing more reveals the essential\r\nstrangeness of human life than this meeting after many years with\r\npersons we have formerly known intimately, who are now so much changed\r\nin outward guise. We feel the changes to be unreal, and yet, there they\r\nare! Grover Cleveland was being groomed for his first Presidential term\r\nthen; Hubert was one of his supporters in New York, and he presented me\r\nto the pyramidal man of destiny. Poor Hubert died, lamentably, not\r\nlong after. He was a good and affectionate son. He was perhaps too\r\nkind-hearted and loyal for the political role which he enacted.\r\n\r\nThe elder Thompson boy was called Edmund, or, in my vernacular, Eddy.\r\nThere were in his nature a gravity, depth, and sweetness which won my\r\nheart and respect, and we became friends in that intimate and complete\r\nway that seems possible only to boys in their early teens. For that\r\nmatter, neither of us was yet over twelve; I think Eddy was part of\r\na year my junior. But you must search the annals of antiquity to find\r\nanything so solid and unalterable as was our friendship. He was the most\r\nabsolutely good boy I ever knew, but by no means goody-goody; he had\r\nhigh principles, noble ambitions, strong affections, the sweetest of\r\ntempers; his seriousness formed a healthy foil to my own more impetuous\r\nand hazardous character. \"The thoughts of a boy are long, long\r\nthoughts\"; and not in many long lifetimes could a tithe of the splendid\r\nprojects we resolved upon have been carried out. We were together from\r\nmorning till night, month after month; we walked interminably about Rome\r\nand frequented its ruins, and wandered far out over the Campagna and\r\nalong the shores of famous Tiber. We picked up precious antique marbles,\r\ncoins, and ancient curiosities of all sorts; we hunted for shells and\r\nbutterflies and lizards; our hearts were uplifted by the martial music\r\nof the French army bands, which were continually resounding throughout\r\nRome; and we admired the gleaming swords of the officers and the sharp,\r\npunctual drill and marching of the red-legged rank and file. We haunted\r\nthe lovely Villa Borghese, the Pincian Hill, the Villa Pamphili Doria;\r\nwe knew every nook and cranny of the Palace of the Csesars, the Baths\r\nof Caracalla, the Roman Forum, the Coliseum, the Egerian Grove; we were\r\nfamiliar with every gate that entered Rome; we drank at every fountain;\r\nwe lingered through the galleries of the Vatican and of the Capitol;\r\nwe made St. Peter's Church our refuge in inclement weather; we\r\nthreaded every street and by-way of the city; we were on friendly and\r\nconfidential terms with the custode of every treasure. And all the time\r\nwe talked about what we thought, what we felt, what we would do; there\r\nis no looking backward in boys' confidences; they live in the instant\r\npresent and in the infinite future. Eddy and I arranged to spend one\r\nlifetime in Central Africa, in emulation of the exploits of David\r\nLivingstone; there, freed from all civilized burdens, we would live, and\r\nwe would run, catch the wild goat by the hair, and hurl our lances in\r\nthe sun. At another epoch of our endless lives we would enter the army\r\nand distinguish ourselves in heroic war; we would have swords like\r\nsunbeams and ride steeds like Bucephalus. Then, and interleaved with all\r\nthis, as it were, there was an immense life of natural history; we would\r\nhave a private museum to rival the famous ones of nations. Eddy was\r\nespecially drawn towards insects, while my own predilection was still\r\nfor conchology; and both of us spent hours every week in classifying\r\nand arranging our respective collections, not to speak of the time we\r\ndevoted to hunting for specimens. Eddy had a green net at the end of\r\na stick, and became very skilful in making his captures; and how we\r\ntriumphed over a \"swallow-tail,\" so difficult to catch, or an unfamiliar\r\nspecies! Eddy had his pins and his strips of cork, and paper boxes;\r\nand his collections certainly were fairer to look upon, to the ordinary\r\nview, than mine; moreover, his was the more scientific mind and the\r\nnicer sense of order. For the display of my snail-shells I used bits of\r\ncard-board and plenty of gum-arabic; and I was affluent in \"duplicates,\"\r\nmy plan being to get a large card and then cover it with specimens of\r\nthe shell, in serried ranks. I also called literature to my aid, and\r\nproduced several little books containing labored descriptions of my\r\ncollection, couched, so far as possible, in the stilted and formal\r\nphraseology of the conchological works to which I had access, but with\r\noccasional outbursts after a style of my own. Here is a chapter from one\r\nof them; a pen-and-ink portrait of the shell is prefixed to the original\r\nessay:\r\n\r\n\"CLAUSILIA BUBIGUNIA\r\n\r\n\"This handsome and elegant little shell is found in mossy places, or\r\nin old ruins, such as the Coliseum--where it is found in immense\r\nnumbers--or the Palace of the Caesars. But in Italy it is common in any\r\nmossy ruin, in the small, moss-covered holes, where it is seen at the\r\nfarthest extremity. After a rain they always crawl out of their places\r\nof concealment in such numbers that one would think it had been raining\r\nclausilias. The shell, in large and fine specimens, is five-eighths of\r\nan inch in length. The young are very small and look like the top part\r\nof the spire of the adults. This shell is also largest in the middle,\r\nshaped something like a grain of wheat. It has nine whorls, marked by\r\nsmall white lines, which look like fine white threads of sewing-cotton;\r\nand just below them are marks which look like very fine and very small\r\nstitches of white cotton. The color of the shell, down to next to\r\nthe last whorl, is a brown color, but the very last whorl is a little\r\nlighter. The shell is covered all over with fine lines, but they need\r\nto be looked at through a magnifying-glass, they are so fine. The lip\r\nis turning out, and very thin; inside there are three ridges, two on the\r\ntop part of the mouth, and the other, which is very small, is below. The\r\nshell, when the animal is out of it, is semi-transparent, and the little\r\ncolomella, or pillar, can be indistinctly seen through.\"\r\n\r\nThere follows a detailed and loving description of the animal inhabiting\r\nthe shell, which I must reserve for a future edition. Of another species\r\nof snail, Helix strigata, our learned author observes that \"This shell\r\nis, when dead, one of those which is found on the banks of the Tiber. It\r\nis a strange circumstance that, although it is a land shell, it should\r\nbe found more on the banks of a river than anywhere else, and also only\r\non the banks of the Tiber, for it is not found on the banks of any other\r\nriver. Any one would think that dead shells were gifted with the power\r\nof walking about, for certainly it is an inexplicable wonder how they\r\ngot there.\" Of Helix muralis we are informed that \"The Romans eat these\r\nsnails, not the whole of them, but only their feet. In ancient times the\r\nmost wealthy people used to eat snails, and perhaps they ate the very\r\nones which the poorest people eat nowadays. It is most probable, for\r\nthere are a great many different kinds of snails round Rome, and the\r\nRomans would probably select the best.\" I may perhaps be permitted\r\nto remark that the correct orthography of this writer fills me with\r\nastonishment, inasmuch as in later life I have reason to know that\r\nhe often went astray in this respect. Of the uniform maturity of the\r\nliterary style, I have no need to speak.\r\n\r\nEddy's father was in the habit of giving him an income of two or three\r\npauls a week, dependent on his good behavior and punctual preparation of\r\nhis lessons; and since Eddy was always well behaved and faithful in his\r\nstudies, the income came in pretty regularly. Eddy saved up this revenue\r\nwith a view to buying himself a microscope, for the better prosecution\r\nof his zoological labors; being, also, stimulated thereto by the fact\r\nthat I already possessed one of these instruments, given me by my father\r\na year or two before. Mine cost ten shillings, but Eddy meant to get one\r\neven more expensive. I had, too, a large volume of six hundred pages on\r\nThe Microscope, Its History, Construction, and Uses, by Jabez Hogg, the\r\ncontents of which I had long since learned by heart, and which I gladly\r\ncommunicated to my friend. At length Eddy's economies had proceeded so\r\nfar that he was able to calculate that on his twelfth birthday he would\r\npossess a fortune of five scudi, and he decided that he would buy a\r\nmicroscope at that figure; it is needless to add that the microscope\r\nhad long since been selected in the shop, and was decidedly superior\r\nto mine. We could hardly contain our impatience to enter upon the\r\nmarvellous world whereof this instrument was the key; that twelfth\r\nbirthday seemed long in coming, but at last it came.\r\n\r\nI was to go with my friend to the shop to see him make the purchase;\r\nand I was at his house betimes in the morning. But what a stupendous\r\nsurprise awaited me! Eddy was too much excited to say anything; with a\r\nface beaming with emotion, he led me into the sitting-room, and there,\r\nupon the table, was a microscope. But such a microscope! It was of such\r\nunheard-of magnificence and elaborateness that it took my breath away,\r\nand we both stood gazing at it in voiceless rapture. It was tall and\r\nelegant, shining with its polished brass and mirrors, and its magnifying\r\npowers were such as to disclose to us the very heart of nature's\r\nmystery. It was quiet Mr. Thompson's birthday present to his son. That\r\ngentleman sat smiling in his armchair by the window, and presently he\r\nsaid, with a delightful archness, \"Well, Eddy, I suppose you are ready\r\nto give me back all that money you've been collecting?\" Eddy grinned\r\nradiantly. He spent his savings for microscope-slides and other\r\nappurtenances, and for weeks thereafter he could hardly take his\r\neye away from the object-lens. He was luminous with happiness, and I\r\nreflected his splendor from my sympathetic heart. Dear old Eddy! In\r\nafter years he entered West Point and became a soldier, and he died\r\nearly; I never saw him after parting from him in Italy in 1859. But he\r\nis still my first friend, and there has been no other more dear.\r\n\r\nI am not aware that Rome has ever been described from the point of\r\nview of a twelve-year-old boy, and it might be worth doing; but I have\r\ndelayed attempting it somewhat too long; the moving pictures in my\r\nmind have become too faded and confused. And yet I am surprised at the\r\nminuteness of some of my recollections; they have, no doubt, been kept\r\nalive by the numerous photographs of Rome which one carries about,\r\nand also by the occasional perusal of The Marble Faun and other Roman\r\nliterature. But much is also due to the wonderful separateness which\r\nRome retains in the mind. It is like nothing else, and the spirit of it\r\nis immortal. It seems as if I must have lived a lifetime there; and yet\r\nI cannot make out that our total residence in the city extended over\r\nfourteen months. Certainly no other passage of my boyhood time looms so\r\nlarge or is rooted so deep.\r\n\r\nBut the passion for Rome (unless one be a Byron) is not a plant of\r\nsudden growth, and I dare say that, during those first frigid weeks,\r\nI may have shared my father's whimsical aversion to the city. He has\r\ndescribed, in his journals, how all things seemed to be what they should\r\nnot; and he was terribly disgusted with the filth that defiled the ruins\r\nand the street corners. He was impressed by the ruins, but deplored\r\ntheir nakedness. \"The marble of them grows black or brown, it is true,\"\r\nsays he, \"and shows its age in that way; but it remains hard and\r\nsharp, and does not become again a part of nature, as stone walls do in\r\nEngland; some dry and dusty grass sprouts along the ledges of a ruin,\r\nas in the Coliseum; but there is no green mantle of ivy spreading itself\r\nover the gray dilapidation.\" We stumbled upon the Fountain of Trevi\r\nin one of our early rambles, not knowing what it was. \"One of these\r\nfountains,\" writes my father, referring to it, \"occupies the whole side\r\nof a great edifice, and represents Neptune and his steeds, who seem to\r\nbe sliding down with a cataract that tumbles over a ledge of rocks\r\ninto a marble-bordered lake, the whole--except the fall of water\r\nitself--making up an exceedingly cumbrous and ridiculous affair.\" He\r\ngoes to St. Peter's, and \"it disappointed me terribly by its want of\r\neffect, and the little justice it does to its real magnitude externally;\r\nas to the interior, I am not sure that it would not be even more grand\r\nand majestic if it were less magnificent, though I should be sorry to\r\nsee the experiment tried. I had expected something dim and vast, like\r\nthe great English cathedrals, only more vast and dim and gray; but there\r\nis as much difference as between noonday and twilight.\" The pictures,\r\ntoo, were apt in these first days to go against the grain with him.\r\nContemplating a fresco representing scenes in purgatory, he broke forth:\r\n\"I cannot speak as to the truth of the representation, but, at all\r\nevents, it was purgatory to look at this poor, faded rubbish. Thank\r\nHeaven, there is such a thing as whitewash; and I shall always be glad\r\nto hear of its application to old frescoes, even at the sacrifice of\r\nremnants of real excellence!\" Such growlings torture the soul of the\r\nconnoisseur; but the unregenerate man, hearing them, leaps up and shouts\r\nfor joy. He found the old masters, in their sacred subjects, lacking\r\nin originality and initiative; and when they would represent mythology,\r\nthey engendered an apotheosis of nakedness. His conclusion was that\r\n\"there is something forced, if not feigned, in our taste for pictures\r\nof the old Italian school.\" Of the profane subjects, he instances the\r\nFornarina, \"with a deep bright glow on her face, naked below the waist,\r\nand well pleased to be so, for the sake of your admiration--ready for\r\nany extent of nudity, for love or money--the brazen trollop that she is!\r\nRaphael must have been capable of great sensuality to have painted this\r\npicture of his own accord, and lovingly.\" These are the iconoclasms\r\nof the Goth and Vandal at their first advent to Rome. They remained to\r\nalter their mood, and extol what they had before assaulted; and so did\r\nmy father, as we shall see presently. But at first he was sick and cold\r\nand uncomfortable; and he consoled himself by hitting out at everything,\r\nin the secret privacy of his diary, since opened to the world. With\r\nwarmer weather came equanimity and kinder judgments; but there is\r\na refreshing touch of truth and justice even in these mutterings of\r\nexasperation.\r\n\r\nIt was not so much, I suppose, that Rome was cold as that my father had\r\nexpected it to be otherwise. When one is in a place where tradition and\r\nassociation invite the soul forth to be warmed and soothed and rejoiced,\r\nand the body, venturing out, finds nothing but chill winds and\r\nfrigid temperature and discomfort, the shock is much greater and\r\nmore disagreeable than if one had been in some northern Canada or\r\nSpitzbergen, where such conditions are normal. Ice in the arctic circle\r\nis all right and exhilarating, but in the Piazza of St. Peter's it is an\r\noutrage, and affects the mind and heart even more than the flesh.\r\n\r\nCircumstances caused my father to pass through several distinct phases\r\nof feeling while he was in Rome. First, his own indisposition and the\r\ninclement weather depressed and exasperated him.\r\n\r\nTime, in due course, brought relief in these respects, and he began\r\nto enjoy himself and his surroundings. Anon, the springs of creative\r\nimagination, long dormant in him, were roused to activity by thoughts\r\nconnected with the Faun of Praxiteles in the Capitol. He now became\r\nhappy in the way of his genius and immediately took a new interest\r\nin all things, looking at them from the point of view of possible\r\nbackgrounds or incidents for the romance which had begun to take form\r\nin his mind. He describes what he saw con amore, and all manner of\r\nharmonious ideas bloom through his thoughts, like anemones and other\r\nflowers in the Villa Pamphili and the Borghese. This desirable mood\r\ncontinued until, after our return to Rome from the Florentine visit, my\r\nsister caught the Roman fever. She lay for weeks in danger of death; and\r\nher father's anxiety about her not only destroyed in him all thoughts of\r\nliterary production and care for it, but made even keeping his journal\r\nno longer possible for him. That strain, so long continued, broke\r\nhim down, and he never recovered from it so as to be what he had been\r\nbefore. Nevertheless, when she became convalescent, the reaction from\r\nhis dark misgivings made him, for a time, as light-hearted as a boy;\r\nand, the carnival happening to be coincident with her recovery, he\r\nentered into the fun of it with a zest and enjoyment that surprised\r\nhimself. But, again, it presently became evident that her recovery was\r\nnot complete, and probably never would be so; the injury to her health\r\nwas permanent, and she was liable to recurrences of disease. His spirits\r\nsank again, not so low as before, but, on the other hand, they never\r\nagain rose to their normal level. It was in this saddened mood that he\r\nonce more took up the Roman romance and finished it; it is a sad book,\r\nand when there is a ray of sunshine across the page, it has a melancholy\r\ngleam. After we returned to Concord, his apprehensions concerning Una's\r\nunsound condition were confirmed; and, in addition, the bitter cleavage\r\nbetween North and South inspired in him the gloomiest forebodings. A\r\nwasting away of his whole physical substance ensued; and he died, almost\r\nsuddenly, while in years he might be considered hardly past the prime\r\nof his life. A sensitive eye can trace the effects of the death-blow\r\nall through The Marble Faun, and still more in Septimius and Grimshawe,\r\npublished after his death. In The Dolliver Romance fragment, which was\r\nthe last thing he wrote, there is visible once more some reminiscence\r\nof the old sunshine of humor that was so often apparent in his time of\r\nyouth and vigor; but it, too, has a sad touch in it, such as belongs\r\nto the last rays of the star of day before it sinks below the horizon\r\nforever. Night follows, and the rest is silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Roman carnival in three moods--Apples of Sodom--Poor,\r\n     battered, wilted, stained hearts--A living protest and\r\n     scourge--Dulce est desipere in loco--A rollicking world of\r\n     happy fools--Endless sunshine of some sort--Greenwich Fair\r\n     was worth a hundred of it--They thundered past, never\r\n     drawing rein--\"Senza moccolo!\"--Nothing more charming and\r\n     strange could be imagined--Girls surprised in the midst of\r\n     dressing themselves--A Unitarian clergyman with his fat\r\n     wife--Apparent license under courteous restraint--He laughed\r\n     and pelted and was pelted--William Story, as vivid as when I\r\n     saw him last--A too facile power--A deadly shadow gliding\r\n     close behind--Set afire by his own sallies--\"Thy face is\r\n     like thy mother's, my fair child!\"--Cleopatra in the clay--\r\n     \"War nie sein Brod mit thranen ass.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Roman carnival opened about a month after our arrival in Rome. The\r\nweather was bad nearly all the time, and my father's point of view was\r\ncorrespondingly unsympathetic. The contrast between his mood now and a\r\nyear later, when he was not only stimulated by his daughter's recovery\r\nfrom illness, but, also, was looking at everything rather as the\r\nromancer than as the man, is worth bringing out. My father likewise\r\ndescribes the carnival in the romance; there we see it in a third\r\nphase--as art. But the passages in the note-books are written from the\r\nrealistic stand-point. In her transcriptions of the journals for the\r\npress my mother was always careful to omit from the former everything\r\nthat had been \"used\" in the book; the principle, no doubt, was sound,\r\nbut it might be edifying for once, in a way, to do just the opposite, in\r\norder to mark, if we choose to take the trouble, what kind of changes or\r\nmodifications Hawthorne the romancer would make in the work of my father\r\nthe observer of nature. Take your Marble Faun and turn to two of the\r\nlatter chapters and compare them with the corresponding pages in my\r\nexcerpts from the journals in the Biography. In the latter you will\r\nfind him always in a critical and carping humor; seeing everything\r\nwith abundant keenness, but recognizing nothing worth while in it.\r\nThe bouquets, he noticed, for example, were often picked up out of the\r\nstreet and used again and again; \"and,\" he adds, \"I suppose they aptly\r\nenough symbolized the poor, battered, wilted, stained hearts that had\r\nflown from one hand to another along the muddy pathway of life, instead\r\nof being treasured up in one faithful bosom. Really, it was great\r\nnonsense.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true--such uncongenial interpretation--if you feel that way about\r\nit. And I remember, in my rambles along the famous thoroughfare, seeing\r\na saturnine old fellow in a dingy black coat and slouch hat, with a sour\r\nsnarl on his unprepossessing features, who made it his business, all\r\nday, to cuff and kick the little boys whom he caught throwing confetti,\r\nor picking up the fallen bouquets, and to shove the latter down into\r\nthe sewer which ran beneath the street, through the apertures opening\r\nunderneath the curb. He seemed to have stationed himself there as\r\na living protest and scourge against and of the whole spirit of the\r\ncarnival; to hate it just because the rest of the world enjoyed it, and\r\nto wish that he might make everybody else as miserable and uncharitable\r\nas he was. He was like a wicked and ugly Mrs. Partington, trying to\r\nsweep back the Atlantic of holiday merriment with his dirty mop. But\r\nthis crabbed humor of his, while it made him conspicuous against the\r\nbroad background of gayety, of course had no effect on the gayety\r\nitself. The flood of laughter, jocundity, and semi-boisterous frolic\r\ncontinued to roll up and down the Corso all day long, never attempting\r\nto be anything but pure nonsense, indeed, but achieving, nevertheless,\r\nthe wise end of nonsense in the right time and place--that of refreshing\r\nand lightening the mind and heart. Dulce est desipere in loco--that old\r\nsaw might have been made precisely to serve as the motto of the Roman\r\ncarnival; and very likely it was actually suggested to its renowned\r\nauthor by some similar sport belonging to the old Roman days, before\r\nChristianity was thought of. The young fellows--English, American, or\r\nof whatever other nationality--would stride up and down the overflowing\r\nstreet hour after hour, clad in linen dust-coats down to their heels,\r\nwith a bag of confetti slung on one side and another full of bouquets on\r\nthe other; and they would plunge a warlike hand into the former and hurl\r\nammunition at their rivals; or they would, pick out a bunch of flowers\r\nfrom the latter for a pretty girl--not that the flowers were worth\r\nanything intrinsically, nor was that their fault--but just to show\r\nthe fitting sentiment. There was only one rule, the unwritten one that\r\neverybody was to take everything that came with a smile or a laugh, and\r\nnever get angry at anything; and this universal good-humor lifted the\r\nwhole affair into a wholesome and profitable sphere. Then there was\r\nthe double row of carriages forever moving in opposite directions, and\r\npassing within easy arm's-reach of each other; and the jolly battle was\r\nwaged between their occupants, with side conflicts with the foot-farers\r\nat the same time. And as the same carriages would repass one another\r\nevery forty minutes or so, the persons in them would soon get to\r\nrecognize one another; and, if they were of the sterner sex, they would\r\nbe prepared to renew desperate battle; or if there was a pretty girl or\r\ntwo in one of them, she would be the recipient of a deluge of flowers\r\nor of really pretty bonbons. It was all play, all laughter, all a\r\nnew, rollicking world of happy fools, of comic chivalry, of humorous\r\ngallantry. For my part, I thought it was the world which I had been born\r\nto live in; and I was too happy in it to imagine even that anybody could\r\nbe less happy than I was. My sole grief was when my supply of confetti\r\nhad given out, and I had no money to buy more. I used to look at\r\nthose great baskets at the street-corners, filled with the white\r\nagglomeration, with longing eyes, and wish I had it all in my pockets.\r\nI picked up the fallen bouquets, muddy or not, with no misgiving, and\r\nflung them at the girls with the unquestioning faith of boyhood. I\r\nlooked up at the people in the windows and on the draped balconies with\r\nromantic emotions, and exchanged smiles and beckonings with them. The\r\nFebruary days were never long enough for me; I only wished that the\r\nwhole year was made up of those days; if it rained, or was cold, I never\r\nknew it. There was an endless sunshine of some sort which sufficed for\r\nme. But my father, at this epoch, could catch not a glimpse of it. \"I\r\nnever in my life knew a shallower joke than the carnival at Rome; such\r\na rainy and muddy day, too; Greenwich Fair (at the very last of which I\r\nassisted) was worth a hundred of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe masking day, and the ensuing night of the moccolo, were the\r\nculminating features of the carnival; and it was on the afternoon of\r\nthis day, I think, that the horse-race, with bare-backed horses, took\r\nplace. The backs of these horses, though bare of riders, had attached\r\nto them by strings little balls with sharp points in them, which, as the\r\nhorses ran, bobbed up and down, and did the office of spurs. The race\r\nwas preceded by a thundering gallop of cavalry down the whole length\r\nof the Corso (the street having been cleared of carriages beforehand),\r\nostensibly to prevent anybody from being run over by the race-horses;\r\nbut, as a matter of fact, if any one were killed, it was much more\r\nlikely to be by the ruthless riding of these helmeted dragoons than by\r\nthe riderless steeds. They thundered past, never drawing rein, no matter\r\nwhat stood or ran in their way; and then, after an interval, during\r\nwhich the long crowds, packed back on the opposite sidewalks, craned\r\nforward as far as they dared to see them, came the eight or ten racers\r\nat a furious pace. They were come and gone in a breath; and finally,\r\nafter the body of them were passed, came a laggard, who had been left at\r\nthe post, and was trying to make up for lost time. I believe it was this\r\nhorse who actually killed somebody on the course. The race over, back\r\ninto the street thronged the crowd, filling it from wall to wall; then\r\nthere was a gradual thinning away, as the people went home for supper;\r\nand finally came the night and the moccoli, with the biggest crowd of\r\nall. I was there with my twist of moccolo and a box of matches; except\r\nthe moccoli, there was no other illumination along the length of the\r\nCorso. But their soft lights were there by myriads, and made a lovely\r\nsight, to my eyes at least. \"Senza moccolo!\" was the universal cry;\r\nyoung knights-errant, singly or in groups, pressed their way up and\r\ndown, shouting the battle-cry, and quenching all lights within reach,\r\nwhile striving to maintain the flame of their own; using now the whisk\r\nof a handkerchief, now a puff of breath, now the fillip of a finger;\r\ncontriving to extinguish a fair lady's taper with the same effusion of\r\nvain words wherewith they told her of their passion. Most of the ladies\r\nthus assailed sat in the lower balconies, elevated only a foot or two\r\nabove the level of the sidewalk; but those in the higher retreats made\r\nwar upon one another, and upon their own cavaliers; none was immune from\r\nperil. The cry, uttered at once by such innumerable voices far and near,\r\nmade a singular murmur up and down the Corso; and the soft twinkling of\r\nthe lights, winking in and out as they were put out or relighted, gave\r\na singular fire-fly effect to the whole illumination. It seemed to me\r\nthen, and it still seems in the retrospect, that nothing more charming\r\nand strange could be imagined; and through it all was the constant\r\nblossoming of laughter, more inextinguishable than the moccoletti\r\nthemselves. The colors of the tapestries and stuffs dependent from the\r\nwindows and balconies glowed out in light, or were dimmed by shadow; and\r\nthe faces of the thousandfold crowd of festival-makers glimmered forth\r\nand were lost again on the background of the night, like the features of\r\nspirits in the glimpses of a dream. How long it all lasted I know not;\r\nbut it had its term, like other mortal things, even in this fairyland of\r\ncarnival; and when the last light was out the carnival was no more, and\r\nLent, unawares, had softly settled down upon us with the darkness.\r\n\r\nBut let us now listen to my father when, for the second time, he made\r\nproof of the carnival in the year following our return from Florence,\r\nand after Una had left her sick-room and could be at his side. \"The\r\nweather has been splendid,\" he writes, \"and the merriment far more free\r\nand riotous than as I remember it in the preceding year. Tokens of\r\nthe festival were seen in flowers on street-stands, or borne aloft on\r\npeople's heads, while bushels of confetti were displayed, looking like\r\nveritable sugarplums, so that a stranger might have thought that the\r\nwhole commerce and business of stern old Rome lay in flowers and sweets.\r\nOne wonders, however, that the scene should not be even more rich and\r\nvarious when there has been so long a time (the immemorial existence\r\nof the carnival) to prepare it, and adorn it with shapes of gayety\r\nand humor. There was an infinite number of clowns and particolored\r\nharlequins; a host of white dominoes; a multitude of masks, set in\r\neternal grins, or with monstrous noses, or made in the guise of monkeys,\r\nbears, dogs, or whatever beast the wearer chooses to be akin to; a great\r\nmany men in petticoats, and almost as many girls and women, no doubt, in\r\nbreeches; figures, too, with huge, bulbous heads and all manner of such\r\neasy monstrosities and exaggerations.. It is strange how the whole\r\nhumor of the thing, and the separate humor of each individual character,\r\nvanishes the moment I try to grasp it and describe it; and yet there\r\nreally was fun in the spectacle as it flitted by--for instance, in the\r\nlong line of carriages a company of young men in flesh-colored tights\r\nand chemises, representing a party of girls surprised in the midst of\r\ndressing themselves, while an old nurse in the midst of them expressed\r\nludicrous horror at their predicament. Then the embarrassment of\r\ngentlemen who, while quietly looking at the scene, are surrounded by\r\ngroups of maskers, grimacing at them, squeaking in their ears, hugging\r\nthem, dancing round them, till they snatch an opportunity to escape into\r\nsome doorway; or when a poor man in a black coat and cylinder hat is\r\nwhitened all over with a half-bushel of confetti and lime-dust; the mock\r\nsympathy with which his case is investigated by a company of maskers,\r\nwho poke their stupid, pasteboard faces close to his, still with the\r\nunchangeable grin; or when a gigantic female figure singles out some\r\nshy, harmless personage, and makes appeals to his heart, avowing her\r\npassionate love in dumb show, and presenting him with her bouquet; and a\r\nhundred other nonsensicalities, among which the rudest and simplest\r\nare not the least effective. A resounding thump on the back with a\r\nharlequin's sword, or a rattling blow with a bladder half full of dried\r\npease or corn, answers a very good purpose. There was a good deal of\r\nabsurdity one day in a figure in a crinoline petticoat, riding on an ass\r\nand almost filling the Corso with the circumference of crinoline from\r\nside to side. Some figures are dressed in old-fashioned garbs, perhaps\r\nof the last century, or, even more ridiculous, of thirty years ago, or\r\nin the stately Elizabethan (as we should call them) trunk hose, tunics,\r\nand cloaks of three centuries since. I do not know anything that I have\r\nseen queerer than a Unitarian clergyman (Mr. Mountford), who drives\r\nthrough the Corso daily with his fat wife in a one-horse chaise, with a\r\nwreath of withered flowers and oak leaves round his hat, the rest of his\r\ndress remaining unchanged, except that it is well powdered with the dust\r\nof confetti. That withered wreath is the absurdest thing he could wear\r\n(though, perhaps, he may not mean it to be so), and so, of course, the\r\nbest. I can think of no other masks just now, but will go this afternoon\r\nand try to catch some more.\" You see, he has that romance in view again.\r\n\"Clowns, or zanies,\" he resumes, after fresh inspection, \"appear in\r\ngreat troupes, dancing extravagantly and scampering wildly; everybody\r\nseems to do whatever folly comes into his head; and yet, if you consider\r\nthe matter, you see that all this apparent license is kept under\r\ncourteous restraint. There is no rudeness, except the authorized pelting\r\nwith confetti or blows of harlequins' swords, which, moreover, are\r\nwithin a law of their own. But nobody takes rough hold of another, or\r\nmeddles with his mask, or does him any unmannerly violence. At first\r\nsight you would think that the whole world had gone mad, but at the\r\nend you wonder how people can let loose all their mirthful propensities\r\nwithout unchaining the mischievous ones. It could not be so in America\r\nor in England; in either of those countries the whole street would go\r\nmad in earnest and come to blows and bloodshed were the populace to\r\nlet themselves loose to the extent we see here. All this restraint is\r\nself-imposed and quite apart from the presence of the soldiery.\"\r\n\r\nThis mood, we see, is far more gentle and sympathetic than the former\r\none; there is sunshine within as well as without; and, indeed, I\r\nremember with what glee my father took part in the frolic, as well as\r\nlooked on at it; he laughed and pelted and was pelted; he walked down\r\nthe Corso and back again; he drove to and fro in a carriage; he mounted\r\nto Mr. Motley's balcony and took long shots at the crowd below. The\r\nsombre spirit of criticism had ceased, for a time, to haunt him.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: WILLIAM WETMORE STORY]\r\n\r\nWe went quite often to the studio of William Story, whom my father had\r\nslightly known in Salem before he became a voluntary exile from America.\r\nMr. Story was at this time a small, wiry, nervous personage, smiling\r\neasily, but as much through nervousness as from any inner source or\r\noutward provocation of mirth, and as he smiled he would stroke his\r\ncheeks, which were covered with a short, brown beard, with the fingers\r\nand thumb of his right hand, while wrinkles would appear round his\r\nbright, brown eyes. \"He looks thin and worn already,\" wrote my father;\r\n\"a little bald and a very little gray, but as vivid as when I saw him\r\nlast; he cannot, methinks, be over thirty-seven.\" He was thirty-nine in\r\n1858. \"The great difficulty with him, I think, is a too facile power,\"\r\nmy father goes on; \"he would do better things if it were more difficult\r\nfor him to do merely good ones. Then, too, his sensibility is too quick;\r\nbeing easily touched by his own thoughts, he cannot estimate what is\r\nrequired to touch a colder and duller person, and so stops short of the\r\nadequate expression.\" He commented on the vein of melancholy beneath\r\nthe sparkle of his surface, as if, in the midst of prosperity, he was\r\nconscious of a \"deadly shadow gliding close behind.\" Boys of twelve are\r\nnot troubled with insight, unless of that unconscious, intuitive kind\r\nthat tells them that a person is likeable, or the reverse, no matter\r\nwhat the person may do or say. I liked Mr. Story, and thought him as\r\nlight of spirit as he seemed; not that he was not often earnest enough\r\nin his talks with my father, to whom he was wont to apply himself with\r\na sort of intensity, suggesting ideas, and watching, with his nervous\r\nsmile, my father's reception of them; plunging into deep matters, beyond\r\nmy comprehension, dwelling there a few minutes, and then emerging again\r\nwith a sparkle of wit; he was certainly very witty, and the wit was\r\nnative and original, not memorized. When he got into the current of\r\ndrollery, he would, as it were, set himself afire by his own sallies,\r\nand soar to astonishing heights, which had an irresistible contagion\r\nfor the hearers; and he would sometimes, sitting at a table with pen and\r\npaper at hand, illustrate his whimsicalities with lightning sketches\r\nof immense cleverness, considering their impromptu character. I have\r\npreserved a sheet of letter-paper covered with such drawings. The\r\nconversation had got upon Byron, whom Mr. Story chose to ridicule; as he\r\ntalked, he drew a head of \"Byron as he thought he was,\" followed by one\r\nof \"Byron as he was,\" and by another of \"Byron as he might have been,\"\r\nshowing a very pronounced negro type. Then he made a portrait of \"Ada,\r\nsole daughter of my house and heart,\" and wrote under it, \"Thy face was\r\nlike thy mother's, my fair child!\" a hideous, simpering miss, with\r\na snub nose and a wooden mouth--\"A poet's dream!\" He also showed the\r\nappearance of the Falls of Terni, \"as described by Byron,\" and\r\nadded studies of infant phenomena, mother's darlings, a Presidential\r\ncandidate, and other absurdities, accompanying it all with a running\r\ncomment and imaginative improvisations which had the charm of genius in\r\nthem, and made us ache with laughter, young and old alike. Such a\r\nman, nervous, high-strung, of fine perceptions and sensibilities, must\r\ninevitably pass through rapid and extreme alternations of feeling; and,\r\nno doubt, an hour after that laughing seance of ours, Mr. Story was\r\nplunged deep in melancholy. Yet surely his premonitions of evil were\r\nunfulfilled; Story lived long and was never other than fortunate.\r\nPerhaps he was unable to produce works commensurate with his\r\nconceptions; but unhappiness from such a cause is of a noble sort, and\r\nbetter than most ordinary felicities.\r\n\r\nI remember very well the statue of Cleopatra while yet in the clay.\r\nThere she sat in the centre of the large, empty studio, pondering on\r\nAugustus and on the asp. The hue of the clay added a charm to the figure\r\nwhich even the pure marble has not quite maintained. Story said that he\r\nnever was present while the cast of one of his statues was being made;\r\nhe could not endure the sight of the workmen throwing the handfuls of\r\nplaster at the delicate clay. Cleopatra was substantially finished, but\r\nStory was unwilling to let her go, and had no end of doubts as to the\r\nhandling of minor details. The hand that rests on her knee--should the\r\nforefinger and thumb meet or be separated? If they were separated, it\r\nmeant the relaxation of despair; if they met, she was still meditating\r\ndefiance or revenge. After canvassing the question at great length with\r\nmy father, he decided that they should meet; but when I saw the marble\r\nstatue in the Metropolitan Museum the other day I noticed that they\r\nwere separated. In the end the artist had preferred despair. Such things\r\nindicate the man's character, and, perhaps, explain his failure to reach\r\nthe great heights of art. He could not trust a great idea to manage\r\nitself, but sought subtler expression through small touches, and thus,\r\nfinally, lost the feeling of the larger inspiration. A little more of\r\nthe calm, Greek spirit would have done him good.\r\n\r\nHe had many projects for other statues, which he would build up in fancy\r\nbefore my father and discuss with him. His words and gestures made the\r\nideas he described seem actual and present, but he seldom got them\r\ninto marble; he probably found, upon trial, that they did not belong to\r\nsculpture. He had the ambition to make marble speak not its own language\r\nmerely, but those of painting and of poetry likewise; and when this\r\nproved impossible he was unhappy and out of conceit with himself, On\r\nthe other hand, he did good work in poetry and in prose; but neither\r\ndid these content him. After all, my father's observation hit the mark;\r\nthings came too easy to him. Goethe speaks the word for him:\r\n\r\n  \"Wer nie sein Brod mit thranen ass,\r\n   Er kennt euch nicht, ihr ewige Machte!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\n     Drilled in Roman history--Lovely figures made of light and\r\n     morning--What superb figures!--The breath and strength of\r\n     immeasurable antiquity--Treasures coming direct from dead\r\n     hands into mine--A pleasant sound of coolness and\r\n     refreshment--Receptacles of death now dedicated to life--The\r\n     Borghese is a forest of Ardennes--Profound and important\r\n     communings--A smiling deceiver--Of an early-rising habit--\r\n     Hauling in on my slack--A miniature cabinet magically made\r\n     Titanic--\"If I had a murder on my conscience\"--None can tell\r\n     the secret origin of his thoughts--A singularly beautiful\r\n     young woman--She actually ripped the man open--No leagues of\r\n     chivalry needed in Rome--A resident army--Five foot six--\r\n     Corsets and padding--She was wounded in the house of her\r\n     friends.\r\n\r\nWe children had been drilled in Roman history, from Romulus to Caesar,\r\nand we could, and frequently did, repeat by heart the Lays of Ancient\r\nRome by Macaulay, which were at that period better known, perhaps, than\r\nthey are now. Consequently, everything in Rome had a certain degree\r\nof meaning for us, and gave us a pleasure in addition to the intrinsic\r\nbeauty or charm that belonged thereto. Our imagination thronged the\r\nCapitol with senators; saw in the Roman Forum the contentions of the\r\ntribunes and the patricians; heard the populus Romanus roar in the\r\nColiseum; beheld the splendid processions of victory wind cityward\r\nthrough the Arch of Titus; saw Caesar lie bleeding at the base of\r\nPompey's statue; pondered over the fatal precipice of the Tarpeian\r\nRock; luxuriated in the hollow spaces of the Baths of Caracalla; lost\r\nourselves in gorgeous reveries in the palace of the Caesars, and haunted\r\nthe yellow stream of Tiber, beneath which lay hidden precious treasures\r\nand forgotten secrets. And we were no less captivated by the galleries\r\nand churches, which contained the preserved relics of the great old\r\ntimes, and were in themselves so beautiful. My taste for blackened old\r\npictures and faded frescoes was, indeed, even more undeveloped than\r\nmy father's; but I liked the brilliant reproductions in mosaic at St.\r\nPeter's and certain individual works in various places. I formed a\r\nromantic attachment for the alleged Beatrice Cenci of Guido, or of some\r\nother artist, and was very sorry that she should be so unhappy, though,\r\nof course, I was ignorant of the occasion of her low spirits. But I\r\nliked much better Guide's large design of Aurora, partly because I had\r\nlong been familiar with it on the head-board of my mother's bedstead.\r\nBefore her marriage she had bought a set of bedroom furniture, and had\r\npainted it a dull gold color, and on this surface she had drawn in fine\r\nblack lines the outlines of several classical subjects, most of them\r\nfrom Flaxman; but in the space mentioned she had executed an outline\r\nof this glorious work of the Italian artist. I knew every line of\r\nthe composition thoroughly; and, by-the-way, I doubt if a truer, more\r\ninspired copy of the picture was ever produced by anybody. But the color\r\nhad to be supplied by the observer's imagination; now, for the first\r\ntime, I saw the hues as laid on by the original painter. In spite of\r\ntime, they were pure and exquisite beyond description; these lovely\r\nfigures seemed made of light and morning. Another favorite picture of\r\nmine was the same artist's \"Michael Overcoming the Evil One,\" and I\r\neven had the sense to like the painting better than the mosaic copy.\r\nRaphael's \"Transfiguration\" I also knew well from the old engraving of\r\nit that used to hang on our parlor wall from my earliest recollections;\r\nit still hangs yonder. But I never cared for this picture; it was too\r\ncomplicated and ingenious--it needed too much co-operation from\r\nthe observer's mind. Besides, I had never seen a boy with anything\r\napproaching the muscular development of the epileptic youth in the\r\ncentre. The thing in the picture that I most approved of was the end of\r\nthe log in the little pool, in the foreground; it looked true to life.\r\n\r\nBut my delight in the statues was endless. It seems to me that I knew\r\npersonally every statue and group in the Vatican and in the Capitol.\r\nAgain and again, either with my parents, or with Eddy, or even alone,\r\nI would pass the warders at the doors and enter those interminable\r\ngalleries, and look and look at those quiet, stained-marble effigies.\r\nMy early studies of Flaxman had, in a measure, educated me towards\r\nappreciation of them. I never tired of them, as I did of the Cleopatras\r\nand the Greek Slaves. What superb figures! What power and grace and\r\nfleetness and athletic loins! The divine, severe Minerva, musing under\r\nthe shadow of her awful helmet; the athlete with the strigil, resting\r\nso lightly on his tireless feet; the royal Apollo, disdaining his own\r\nvictory; the Venus, half shrinking from the exquisiteness of her own\r\nbeauty; the swaying poise of the Discobulus, caught forever as he drew\r\nhis breath for the throw; the smooth-limbed, brooding Antinous; the\r\nterrible Laocoon, which fascinated me, though it always repelled me,\r\ntoo; the austere simplicity of the Dying Gladiator's stoop to death--the\r\nmost human of all the great statues; the heads of heroic Miltiades,\r\nof Antony, of solitary Caesar, of indifferent Augustus; the tranquil\r\nindolence of mighty Nile, clambered over by his many children--these,\r\nand a hundred others, spoke to me out of their immortal silence. I can\r\nconceive of no finer discipline for a boy; I emulated while I adored\r\nthem. Power, repose, beauty, nobility, were in their message: \"Do you,\r\ntoo, possess limbs and shoulders like ours!\" they said to me; \"such a\r\nbearing, such a spirit within!\" I cannot overestimate even the physical\r\ngood they did me; it was from them that I gained the inspiration for\r\nbodily development and for all athletic exercise which has, since then,\r\nhelped me over many a rough passage in the path of life. But they also\r\nawoke higher ambitions and conferred finer benefits.\r\n\r\nFrom these excursions into the ideal I would return to out-of-doors with\r\nanother inexhaustible zest. That ardent, blue Roman sky and penetrating,\r\nsoft sunshine filled me with life and joy. The breath and strength of\r\nimmeasurable antiquity emanated from those massive ruins, which time\r\ncould deface but never conquer. Emerald lizards basked on the hot walls;\r\nflowers grew in the old crevices; butterflies floated round them; they\r\nwere haunted by spirits of heroes. There is nothing else to be compared\r\nwith the private, intimate, human, yet sublimated affection which\r\nthese antique monuments wrought in me. They were my mighty brothers,\r\ncondescending to my boyish thoughts and fancies, smiling upon me,\r\nwelcoming me, conscious of my love for them. Each ruin had its separate\r\nindividuality for me, so that to-day I must play with the Coliseum,\r\nto-morrow with the Forum, or the far-ranging arches of the Aqueduct, or\r\nthe Temple of Vesta. Always, too, my eyes were alert for treasures in\r\nthe old Roman soil, coming, as it seemed, direct from the dead hands of\r\nthe vanished people into mine. I valued the scraps that I picked up thus\r\nmore than anything to be bought in shops or seen in museums. These\r\nbits of tinted marble had felt the touch of real Romans; their feet had\r\ntrodden on them, on them their arms had rested, their hands had grasped\r\nthem. Two thousand years had dulled the polish of their surfaces; I took\r\nthem to the stone-workers, who made them glow and bloom again--yellow,\r\nred, black, green, white. They were good-natured but careless men, those\r\nmarble-polishers, and would sometimes lose my precious relics, and when\r\nI called for them would say, every day, \"Domane--domane,\" or try to put\r\nme off with some substitute--as if a boy could be deceived in such\r\na matter! I once found in the neighborhood of a recent excavation a\r\nsemi-transparent tourmaline of a cool green hue when held to the light;\r\nit had once been set in the ring of some Roman beauty. It had, from long\r\nabiding in the earth, that wonderful iridescent surface which ancient\r\nglass acquires. Rose, my sister, picked up out of a rubbish heap a\r\nlittle bronze statuette, hardly three inches high, but, as experts said,\r\nof the best artistic period. Such things made our Roman history books\r\nseem like a tale of yesterday, or they transported us back across the\r\ncenturies, so that we trod in the footsteps of those who had been but a\r\nmoment before us.\r\n\r\nIn those warm days, after our walks and explorations, Eddy and I, and\r\nlittle Hubert, who sometimes was permitted to accompany us, though we\r\ndeemed him hardly in our class, would greatly solace ourselves with the\r\nclear and gurgling fountains which everywhere in Rome flow forth into\r\ntheir marble and moss-grown basins with a pleasant sound of coolness and\r\nrefreshment. Rome without her fountains would not be Rome; every memory\r\nof her includes them. In the streets, in the piazzas, in the wide\r\npleasaunces and gardens, the fountains allure us onward, and comfort us\r\nfor our weariness. In the Piazza d' Espagna, at the foot of the famous\r\nsteps, was that great, boat-shaped fountain whose affluent waters cool\r\nthe air which broods over the wide, white stairway; and not far away\r\nis the mighty Trevi, with its turmoil of obstreperous figures swarming\r\nround bragging Neptune, and its cataract of innumerable rills welling\r\nforth and plunging downward by devious ways to meet at last in the great\r\nbasin, forever agitated with baby waves lapping against the margins.\r\nThese, and many similar elaborate structures, are for the delight of\r\nthe eye; but there are scores of modest fountains, at the corners of\r\nthe ways, in shady or in sunny places, formed of an ancient sarcophagus\r\nreceiving the everlasting tribute of two open-mouthed lion-heads, or\r\nother devices, whose arching outgush splashes into the receptacle made\r\nto hold death, but now immortally dedicated to the refreshment of life.\r\nIt was at these minor fountains that we quenched our boyish thirst,\r\neach drinking at the mouth of a spout; and when we discovered that by\r\nstopping up one spout with our thumb the other would discharge with\r\ndouble force, we played roguish tricks on each other, deluging each\r\nother at unawares with unmanageable gushes of water, till we were forced\r\nto declare a mutual truce of honor. But what delicious draughts did we\r\nsuck in from those lion-mouths into our own; never elsewhere did\r\nwater seem so sweet and revivifying. And then we would peer into the\r\ntransparent depths of the old sarcophagus, with its fringes of green,\r\nsilky moss waving slightly with the movement of the water, and fish out\r\ntiny-spired water-shells; or dip in them the bits of ancient marbles\r\nwe had collected on our walk, to see the hues revive to their former\r\nsplendor. Many-fountained Rome ought to be a cure for wine-bibbers; yet\r\nI never saw an Italian drink at these springs; they would rather quaff\r\nthe thin red and white wines that are sold for a few baiocchi at the\r\ninns.\r\n\r\nThe Pincian Hill and the adjoining grounds of the Borghese Palace came\r\nat length to be our favorite haunts. The Borghese is a delectable spot,\r\nas my father remarks in one of those passages in his diary which\r\nwas afterwards expanded into the art-picture of his romance. \"Broad\r\ncarriageways,\" he says, \"and wood-paths wander beneath long vistas of\r\nsheltering boughs; there are ilex-trees, ancient and sombre, which, in\r\nthe long peace of their lifetime, have assumed attitudes of indolent\r\nrepose; and stone-pines that look like green islands in the air, so high\r\nabove earth are they, and connected with it by such a slender length of\r\nstem; and cypresses, resembling dark flames of huge, funereal candles.\r\nThese wooded lawns are more beautiful than English park scenery; all the\r\nmore beautiful for the air of neglect about them, as if not much care of\r\nmen were bestowed upon them, though enough to keep wildness from growing\r\ninto deformity, and to make the whole scene like nature idealized--the\r\nwoodland scenes the poet dreamed of--a forest of Ardennes, for instance.\r\nThese lawns and gentle valleys are beautiful, moreover, with fountains\r\nflashing into marble basins, or gushing like natural cascades from rough\r\nrocks; with bits of architecture, as pillared porticos, arches, columns,\r\nof marble or granite, with a touch of artful ruin on them; and, indeed,\r\nthe pillars and fragments seem to be remnants of antiquity, though put\r\ntogether anew, hundreds of years old, perhaps, even in their present\r\nform, for weeds and flowers grow out of the chinks and cluster on the\r\ntops of arches and porticos. There are altars, too, with old Roman\r\ninscriptions on them. Statues stand here and there among the trees, in\r\nsolitude, or in a long range, lifted high on pedestals, moss-grown, some\r\nof them shattered, all grown gray with the corrosion of the atmosphere.\r\nIn the midst of these sunny and shadowy tracts rises the stately front\r\nof the villa, adorned with statues in niches, with busts, and ornamented\r\narchitecture blossoming in stone-work. Take away the malaria, and it\r\nmight be a very happy place.\"\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: PENCIL SKETCHES IN ITALY, BY MRS. NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE]\r\n\r\nHere was a playground for boys of imaginative but not too destructive\r\nproclivities, such as the world hardly furnishes elsewhere. But much of\r\nmy enjoyment of it I ascribe to my friend Eddy. My conversation with\r\nno person since then has rivalled the profundity and importance of my\r\ncommunings with his sympathetic soul. We not only discussed our future\r\ndestinies and philosophical convictions, but we located in these\r\ndelicious retreats the various worlds which we purposed to explore and\r\ninhabit during the next few hundred years. Here we passed through by\r\nanticipation all our future experiences. Sometimes we were accompanied\r\nby other boys; but then our visits lost their distinction; we merely\r\nhad good times in the ordinary way of boys; we were robber barons,\r\nintrenched in our strongholds, and attacked by other robbers; or we ran\r\nraces, or held other trials of strength and activity, or we set snares\r\nfor the bright-colored fishes which lurked in some of the fountains. The\r\ngrounds were occasionally invaded by gangs of Italian boys, between whom\r\nand ourselves existed an irreconcilable feud. We could easily thrash\r\nthem in the Anglo-Saxon manner, with nature's weapons; but they would\r\nambush us and assail us with stones; and once one of them struck at\r\nme with a knife, which was prevented from entering my side only by the\r\nstout leather belt which I chanced to wear. We denounced these assassins\r\nto the smiling custode of the grounds, and he promised, smilingly, to\r\nbar the entrance to them thenceforth; but he was a smiling deceiver;\r\nour enemies came just the same. After all, we would have regretted their\r\nabsence; they added the touch of peril to our chronic romance which\r\nmade it perfect. It is forty-four years since then. Are there any other\r\nBorghese Gardens to come for me in the future, I wonder? There was a\r\nrough pathway along the banks of the Tiber, extending up the stream for\r\ntwo or three miles, as far as the Ponte Molle, where the corktrees grew,\r\nand farther, for aught I know. This was a favorite walk of mine, because\r\nof the fragments of antique marbles to be found there, and also the\r\nshells which so mysteriously abounded along the margin, as shown by the\r\nlearned conchological author hereinbefore cited. And, being of an early\r\nrising habit, it was my wont to get up long before breakfast and tramp\r\nup and down along the river for an hour or two, thinking, I suppose,\r\nas I gazed upon the turbulent flood, of brave Horatius disdainfully\r\nescaping from the serried hosts of Lars Porsena and false Sextus, or\r\nof Caesar and Cassius buffeting the torrent on a \"dare,\" and with lusty\r\nsinews flinging it aside. There were also lovely effects of dawn upon\r\nthe dome of St. Peter's, and the redoubtable mass of St. Angelo, with\r\nits sword-sheathing angel. Moreover, sunrise, at twelve years of age, is\r\nan exhilarating and congenial phenomenon. And I painted my experiences\r\nin colors so attractive that our Ada Shepard was inflamed with the idea\r\nof accompanying me on my rambles. She was a child in heart, though so\r\nmature in intellect, and her spirit was valiant, though her flesh was\r\ncomparatively infirm. It was my custom to set out about five o'clock\r\nin the morning, and Miss Shepard promised to be ready at that hour.\r\nBut after keeping awake most of the night in order not to fail of the\r\nappointment, she fell asleep and dreamed only of getting up; and, after\r\nwaiting for her for near an hour, I went without her. She was\r\nmuch mortified at her failure, and suggested a plan to insure her\r\npunctuality, in which I readily agreed to collaborate. When she went to\r\nbed she attached a piece of string to one of her toes, the other end of\r\nthe filament being carried underneath doors and along passages to my own\r\nroom. I was instructed to haul in on my slack at the proper hour; and\r\nthis I accordingly did, with good-will, and was at once made conscious\r\nthat I had caught something, not only by the resistance which my\r\nefforts encountered, but by the sound of cries of feminine distress and\r\nsupplication, heard in the distance. However, my companion appeared in\r\ndue season, and we took our walk, which, she declared, fulfilled all the\r\nanticipations which my reports had led her to form.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I cannot remember that we ever again made the expedition\r\ntogether; it is a mistake to try to repeat a perfect joy.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that I must have been a pretty constant visitor at St.\r\nPeter's. The stiff, heavy, leathern curtain which protects the entrance\r\nhaving been strenuously pushed aside (always with remembrance of\r\nCorinne's impossible act of grace and courtesy in holding it aside\r\nwith one hand for Lord Neville), the glorious interior expanded, mildly\r\nradiant, before me. As has been the case with so many other observers,\r\nthe real magnitude of the spectacle did not at first affect me; the\r\ncharacter of the decoration and detail prevented the impression of\r\ngreatness; it was only after many times traversing that illimitable\r\npavement, and after frequent comparisons with ordinary human\r\nmeasurements of the aerial heights of those arches and that dome, that\r\none conies to understand, by a sort of logical compulsion, how immense\r\nit all is. It is a miniature cabinet magically made titanic; but the\r\nmagic which could transform inches into roods could not correspondingly\r\nenlarge the innate character of the ornament; so that, instead of making\r\nthe miniature appear truly vast, it only makes us seem unnaturally\r\nsmall. Still, after all criticisms, St. Peter's remains one of the most\r\ndelightful places in the world; its sweet sumptuousness and imperial\r\nharmonies seem somehow to enter into us and make us harmonious, rich,\r\nand sweet. The air that we inhale is just touched with the spirit of\r\nincense, and mellowed as with the still memories of the summers of\r\nfive hundred years ago. The glistening surfaces of the colored marbles,\r\ndimmed with faint, fragrant mists, and glorified with long slants of\r\nbrooding sunshine, soothe the eye like materialized music; and the soft\r\ntwinkle of the candles on the altars, seen in daylight, has a jewel-like\r\ncharm. As I look back upon it, however, and contrast it with the\r\ncathedrals of England, the total influence upon the mind of St. Peter's\r\nseems to me voluptuous rather than religious. It is a human palace of\r\nart more than a shrine of the Almighty. A prince might make love to a\r\nprincess there without feeling guilty of profanation. St. Peter himself,\r\nsitting there in his chair, with his highly polished toe advanced, is\r\na doll for us to play with. On one occasion I was in the church with\r\nmy father, and the great nave was thronged with people and lined with\r\nsoldiers, and down the midst went slowly a gorgeous procession, with\r\nPope Pio Nono borne aloft, swayingly, the triple crown upon his head. He\r\nblessed the crowd, as he passed along, with outstretched hand. One can\r\nnever forget such a spectacle; but I was not nearly so much impressed in\r\na religious sense as when, forty years later, I stood in the portals of\r\na Mohammedan mosque in Central India and saw a thousand turbaned Moslems\r\nprostrate themselves with their foreheads in the dust before a voice\r\nwhich proclaimed the presence of the awful, unseen God.\r\n\r\nMy father enjoyed the church more after each visit to it. But it was the\r\nconfessionals and their significance that most interested him. \"What an\r\ninstitution the confessional is! Man needs it so, that it seems as if\r\nGod must have ordained it.\" And he dwells upon the idea with remarkable\r\nelaboration and persistence. Those who have followed the painful\r\nwanderings of heart-oppressed Hilda to the carven confessional in the\r\ngreat church, where she found peace, will recognize the amply unfolded\r\nflower of this seed. What I supposed to be my notion of St. Peter's\r\nlooking like the enlargement of some liliputian edifice is also there,\r\nthough I had forgotten it till I myself reread the pages. In this book\r\nof my memories, which is also the book of my forgettings, I must walk to\r\nand fro freely, if I am to walk at all. None can tell the secret origin\r\nof his thoughts.\r\n\r\nBesides the monumental and artistic features of Rome, the human side\r\nof it appealed to me. There was something congenial in the Romans, and,\r\nindeed, in the Italians generally, so that I seemed to be renewing my\r\nacquaintance with people whom I had partly forgotten. I picked up the\r\nconversational language with unusual ease, perhaps owing to the drilling\r\nin Latin which my father had given me; and I liked the easy, objectless\r\nways of the people, and the smiles which so readily took the place of\r\nthe sallow gravity which their faces wore in repose. But it was the\r\nTransteverini women who chiefly attracted me; they wore an antique\r\ncostume familiar enough in paintings, and they claimed to be descendants\r\nof the ancient race; they had the noble features and bearing which one\r\nwould have looked for in such descendants, at all events. Looking in\r\ntheir dark, haughty eyes, one seemed to pass back through the terrible\r\npicturesqueness of mediaeval Italy, with its Borgias and Bella Donnas,\r\nits Lorenzos and Fornarinas, to the Rome of Nero, Augustus, Scipio, and\r\nTarquin. Eddy and I would sometimes make excursions across the river to\r\nTranstevere, and stroll up and down those narrow streets, imagining\r\nall manner of suitable adventures and histories for the inhabitants,\r\nstalking there in their black and scarlet and yellow habiliments,\r\nand glancing imperially from under the black brows of their dark\r\ncountenances. One afternoon during the carnival I was in a dense crowd\r\nin the piazza, towards the lower end of the Corso, and found myself\r\npushed into the neighborhood of a singularly beautiful young woman of\r\nthis class, dressed in the height of her fashion, who was slowly making\r\nher way in my direction through the press. All at once a man, smartly\r\nclad in the garb of recent civilization, stepped in front of her and\r\nsaid something to her; what it was I knew not. She drew herself back,\r\nas from something poisonous or revolting, and the expression of her face\r\nbecame terrible. At the same time her right hand went swiftly to the\r\nmasses of her sable hair, and as swiftly back again, armed with the\r\nsmall, narrow dagger which these women wear by way of hair-pin. Before\r\nthe unhappy creature who had accosted her knew what was happening,\r\nshe thrust the dagger, with a powerful movement--while her white teeth\r\nshowed, set edge to edge, through her drawn lips--deep into his body.\r\nAs he collapsed forward she drew the weapon upward, putting the whole\r\nstrength of her body into the effort, and actually ripped the man open.\r\nDown he fell at her feet. There was a score or more of Roman citizens\r\nwithin arm's-reach of her at the moment; no one spoke, still less\r\nattempted to restrain her. On the contrary, as she turned they\r\nrespectfully opened a way for her through the midst of them, and none\r\nmade an offer to assist the dying wretch who lay writhing and faintly\r\ncoughing on the cobble-stone pavement of the piazza. I was soon elbowed\r\nquietly away from the spot where he lay; I caught a glimpse of the\r\ncrimson head-dress of his slayer passing away afar amid the crowd;\r\npresently the cocked hat of a gendarme appeared from another direction,\r\nadvancing slowly against manifest obstructions; everybody seemed to\r\nget in his way, without appearing to intend it. Such was the attitude\r\ntowards assassination of the Roman people in those days. I have often\r\nthought over the incident since then. Their sympathy is with private\r\nvengeance, never with ordained statute law. They love to use the poniard\r\nand to see it used, and will do their best to shield the users. Pity for\r\nthe victim they have none; they assume that he has his deserts. For\r\nthat matter, my own sympathies, filled though I was with horror at the\r\nspectacle of actual murder done before my eyes, were wholly with the\r\nsavage beauty, and not with the fatuous creature who had probably\r\ninsulted her. It is needless to say that the women of Transtevere were\r\nnot so often called upon to resent insults as are the ladies of New\r\nYork and other American cities. They did not wait for policemen or for\r\n\"leagues of chivalry\" to avenge them.\r\n\r\nTowards the French soldiers I was cordially disposed. Their dark-blue\r\ntunics and baggy, red peg-tops were never out of sight, and though I\r\nhad seen troops in England, and had once observed the march of a British\r\nregiment in Liverpool going to embark for the Crimea (whence, I believe,\r\nvery few of this particular regiment returned), yet the conception of a\r\nresident army first came to me in Rome. About the French army of those\r\ndays still hovered the lustre bestowed upon it by the deeds of the great\r\nNapoleon, which their recent exploits in the Crimea had not diminished.\r\nThere were among them regiments of fierce and romantic looking zouaves,\r\nwith Oriental complexions and semi-barbaric attire, marching with a long\r\nswing, and appearing savage and impetuous enough to annihilate anything;\r\nand there was also a brigade, the special designation of which I have\r\nforgotten, every man of which was a trained athlete, and whose drill\r\nwas something marvellous to witness. But the average French soldier was\r\nsimply a first-class soldier, good-natured, light-hearted, active, trim,\r\nand efficient; in height averaging not more than five foot six; carrying\r\nmuskets which seemed out of proportion large, though they handled them\r\nlightly enough, and wearing at their sides a short sword, like the sword\r\nof ancient Rome, which was also used as a bayonet. There was always a\r\ndrill or a march in progress somewhere, and sentinels paced up and down\r\nbefore the palaces. The officers were immensely impressive; the young\r\nones had wasp waists, surpassing those of the most remorseless belles\r\nof fashion; and the old ones were, en revanche, immensely stout in that\r\nregion, as if outraged nature were resolved to assert herself at last.\r\nBut, young or old, their swords were sun-bright and lovely to behold--I\r\nused to polish my own little weapon in vain in the attempt to emulate\r\nthem. Hopelessly envious was I, too, of the heroic chests of these\r\nwarriors (not knowing them to be padded, as the waists were corseted),\r\nand I would swell out my own little pectoral region to its utmost extent\r\nas I walked along the streets, thereby, though I knew it not, greatly\r\nbenefiting my physical organism. Of course I had no personal commerce\r\nwith the officers, but the rank and file fraternized with me and my\r\ncompanions readily; there was always a number of them strolling about\r\nRome and its environs on leave, in pairs or groups, and they were just\r\nas much boys as we were. They would let me heft their short, strong\r\nswords, and when they understood that I was gathering shells they would\r\nclimb lightly about the ruins, and bring me specimens displayed in their\r\nbroad, open palms. Our conversation was restricted to few words and many\r\ngrunts and gestures, but we understood one another and were on terms of\r\ngay camaraderie. A dozen years afterwards, when there was war between\r\nFrance and Germany, my sympathies were ardently with the former, and\r\ngreat were my astonishment and regret at the issue of the conflict. Man\r\nfor man, and rightly led and managed, I still believe that Gaul could\r\nwipe up the ground with the Teuton, without half trying. But there were\r\nother forces than those of Moltke and Bismarck fighting against poor\r\nFrance in that fatal campaign. She was wounded in the house of her\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\n     Miss Lander makes a bust--The twang of his native place--\r\n     Wholly unlike anybody else--Wise, humorous Sarah Clarke--\r\n     Back to the Gods and the Fleas--Horace Mann's statue--Miss\r\n     Bremer and the Tarpeian Rock--\"I was in a state of some\r\n     little tremor\"--Mrs. Jameson and Ruskin--Most thorough-going\r\n     of the classic tragedies--A well-grown calf--An adventure in\r\n     Monte Testaccio--A vision of death--A fantastic and\r\n     saturnine genius--A pitch-black place--Illuminations and\r\n     fireworks--The Faun-Enjoying Rome--First impressions--\r\n     Lalla's curses.\r\n\r\nWhile my father was conscientiously making acquaintance with the\r\nachievements of old-time art, modern artists were trying to practise\r\ntheir skill on him; he had already sat to Cephas Giovanni Thompson, and\r\nhe was now asked to contribute his head to the studio of a certain Miss\r\nLander, late of Salem, Massachusetts, now settled, as she intended,\r\npermanently in Rome. \"When I dream of home,\" she told him, \"it is\r\nmerely of paying a short visit and coming back here before my trunk is\r\nunpacked.\" Miss Lander was not a painter, but a sculptor, and, in spite\r\nof what my father had said against the nude in sculpture, I think he\r\nliked clay and marble as a vehicle of art better than paint and canvas.\r\nAt all events, he consented to give her sittings. He was interested in\r\nthe independence of her mode of life, and they got on very comfortably\r\ntogether; the results of his observation of her appear in the references\r\nto Hilda's and Miriam's unhampered ways of life in The Marble Faun.\r\nShe had, as I recall her, a narrow, sallow face, sharp eyes, and a long\r\nchin. She might have been thirty years old. Unlike Miss Harriet Hosmer,\r\nwho lived not far away, Miss Lander had no attractiveness for us\r\nchildren. I have reason to think, too, that my father's final opinion of\r\nher was not so favorable as his first one. Except photographs, no really\r\ngood likeness of my father was ever taken; the portrait painted in\r\nWashington, in 1862, by Leutze, was the least successful of them all.\r\nThe best, in my opinion, was an exquisitely wrought miniature of him at\r\nthe age of thirty, which I kept for a long time, till it was stolen by a\r\nfriend in London in 1880.\r\n\r\nPaul Akers, a Maine Yankee, with the twang of his native place still\r\nstrong in him after ten years in Rome, was another sculptor of our\r\nacquaintance; he was very voluble, and escorted us about Rome, and\r\nentertained us at his own studio, where he was modelling his best group,\r\n\"The Drowned Fisher-boy,\" as he called it. The figure is supposed to\r\nbe lying at the bottom of the sea, face upward, with a fragment of rock\r\nsupporting on its sharp ridge the small of the back--a most painful and\r\nuncomfortable attitude, suggesting that even in death there could be no\r\nrest for the poor youth. Mr. Akers was rather sharply critical of his\r\nmore famous brother-artists, such as Greenough and Gibson, and was\r\naccused by them, apparently not wholly without justification, of\r\nyielding too much to the influence of other geniuses in the designing\r\nof his groups. But he was a sensible and obliging little personage, and\r\nintroduced us to the studios of several of his fellow-artists in Rome,\r\nsome of which were more interesting than his own.\r\n\r\nBright little Miss Harriet Hosmer, with her hands in her jacket-pockets,\r\nand her short hair curling up round her velvet cap, struts cheerfully\r\nforth out of the obscurity of the past in my memory; her studio, I\r\nthink, adjoined that of Gibson, of whom I remember nothing whatever. Her\r\nmost notable production at that time was a Puck sitting on a toadstool,\r\nwith a conical shell of the limpet species by way of a cap; he\r\nsomehow resembled his animated and clever creator. Miss Hosmer's face,\r\nexpressions, gestures, dress, and her manifestations in general were\r\nperfectly in keeping with one another; there never was a more succinct\r\nand distinct individuality; she was wholly unlike anybody else, without\r\nbeing in the least unnatural or affected. Her social manner was of a\r\npersistent jollity; but no doubt she had her grave moments or hours, a\r\ngood and strong brain, and a susceptibility to tragic conceptions, as is\r\nshown by the noble figure of her Zenobia. This figure I saw in clay\r\nin her studio during our second season in Rome. Miss Hosmer's talk\r\nwas quick, witty, and pointed; her big eyes redeemed her round,\r\nsmall-featured face from triviality; her warm heart glowed through\r\nall she said and did. Her studio was a contrast to the classicality of\r\nGibson's, whose influence, though she had studied under him during her\r\nsix years' residence in Rome, had affected her technique only, not her\r\nconceptions or aims in art. We all liked her much. She was made known to\r\nus, I believe, through the medium of grave, wise, humorous Sarah Clarke,\r\nthe sister of the James Freeman Clarke who married my mother to my\r\nfather, and who, twenty-two years later, read over my father the burial\r\nservice. Sarah Clarke was often abroad; she was herself an admirable\r\nartist in water-color, and was always a dear friend of my mother's.\r\nAfter we had returned to Concord, in 1860, Miss Hosmer wrote to us, and\r\none of her letters has been preserved; I quote it, because it is like\r\nher:\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR MRS. HAWTHORNE,--It is not unlikely that you may be somewhat\r\nsurprised to hear from me; but after you have received the four dozen\r\nletters which, sooner or later, I intend writing you, you will cease to\r\nbe so. I begin at the present moment with the first of the forty-eight,\r\npartly for business and partly for pleasure. Reversing, then, the\r\norder of things which some unknown but well-regulated-minded individual\r\nconsidered to be correct, I will go in for pleasure first, under which\r\nhead I seek information respecting the health and well-being of all\r\nmembers of your family. It seems cruel that you should go off to the\r\nglorious Republic when there are other places in Rome besides the Piazza\r\nPoli. Now that you are safely out of it, I must try to persuade you that\r\nit was the most unhealthy place in the whole city, not only because\r\nI really believe it to be so, but that malaria may not be mingled and\r\ncherished with every remembrance of this delicious, artistic, fleay,\r\nmalarious paradise. But I suppose little short of a miracle would\r\ntransport you here again, not only because Una is probably becoming\r\nthe size of Daniel Lambert, in her native air, but because Julian is\r\nprobably weaving a future President's chair out of the rattans he is\r\ngetting at school. However that may be, the result is the same, I fear,\r\nas to your getting back to the Gods and the Fleas; and I must look\r\nforward to a meeting in America. Well, as that carries me over the\r\nocean, in my mind's eye, Mrs. Hawthorne, the business clause of my\r\nepistle is suggested--and it is this: I have just had a letter from my\r\nbest of friends, Mr. Crow, of St. Louis [she had studied anatomy in St.\r\nLouis before coming to Rome], who has been passing the summer in\r\nNew York and Boston, and he writes: 'They are talking in Boston of a\r\nmonument to the memory of Mr. Horace Mann, and I have said to one of the\r\nactive men engaged in it that if you could have the commission I would\r\nsubscribe handsomely towards it.' Now, it occurred to me that perhaps\r\nyou or yours might have an opportunity of saying a good word for me, in\r\nwhich case I would have you know how pleased and grateful I should be.\r\nYou may not have the occasion offered you, but if it chances, I commend\r\nmyself to you distintamente, and trust to your good-nature not to\r\nconsider me pushing for having suggested it. I send this through our\r\nwell-beloved Sarah Clarke, and hope it will arrive before 1861. When\r\nyou have nothing better to do, pray give me a line, always in care of\r\nPakenham & Hooker. Good-bye, dear Mrs. Hawthorne--my best love to Mr.\r\nHawthorne and the chicks--and the best wish I can make is that you are\r\nall as fat as yours always affectionately,\r\n\r\n\"HARRIET HOSMER.\"\r\n\r\nAll the influence which my father and mother possessed was given to Miss\r\nHosmer's cause, but some other person got the commission. I remember,\r\ntoo, that my mother, at Mrs. Mann's request, was at great pains to make\r\ndrawings for the face of the statue which now confronts from the slopes\r\nof Beacon Hill the culture and intelligence of Boston, which Horace\r\nMann did so much to promote. But he was not a subject which accommodated\r\nitself readily to the requirements of plastic art. There is a glimpse of\r\nMiss Hosmer in one of my father's diaries, which I will reproduce, for\r\nthe sake of indicating his amused and benevolent attitude towards her.\r\n\"She had on,\" says he, \"a neat little jacket, a man's shirt-bosom, and\r\na cravat with a brooch in it; her hair is cut short, and curls jauntily\r\nround her bright and smart little physiognomy; and, sitting opposite\r\nme at table, I never should have imagined that she terminated in a\r\npetticoat any more than in a fish's tail. However, I do not mean to\r\nspeak disrespectfully of Miss Hosmer, of whom I think very favorably;\r\nbut, it seems to me, her reform of the female dress begins with its\r\nleast objectionable part, and is no real improvement.\"\r\n\r\nOne evening we visited Miss Bremer, the novelist, of Sweden, who was\r\nthen near the end of her foreign travels, which had begun with her visit\r\nto America in 1849. She had met my father in Lenox, and had written of\r\nhim in the book of her travels. She was a small woman, with a big heart\r\nand broad mind, packed full of sense, sentiment, and philanthropy. She\r\nhad an immense nose, designed, evidently, for some much larger person;\r\nher conversation in English, though probably correct, was so oddly\r\naccented that it was difficult to follow her. She was a very lovable\r\nlittle creature, then nearing her sixtieth year. Most of her voluminous\r\nliterary work was done. Her house in Rome was near the Capitol and the\r\nTarpeian Rock; and after we had forgathered with her there for a\r\nwhile, she accompanied us forth--the moon being up--to see the famous\r\nprecipice. It was to this incident that we owe the scene in The Marble\r\nFaun, the most visibly tragic in my father's writings. \"The court-yard,\"\r\nhe writes in his notes, \"is bordered by a parapet, leaning over which\r\nwe saw a sheer precipice of the Tarpeian Rock, about the height of a\r\nfour-story house; not that the precipice was a bare face of rock, but\r\nit appeared to be cased in some sort of cement, or ancient stone-work,\r\nthrough which the primeval rock, here and there, looked grimly and\r\ndoubtfully. Bright as the Roman moonlight was, it would not show the\r\nfront of the wall, or rock, so well as I should have liked to see it,\r\nbut left it pretty much in the same degree of dubiety and half-knowledge\r\nin which the antiquarians leave most of the Roman ruins. Perhaps this\r\nprecipice may have been the Traitor's Leap; perhaps it was the one on\r\nwhich Miss Bremer's garden verges; perhaps neither of the two. At any\r\nrate, it was a good idea of the stern old Romans to fling political\r\ncriminals down from the very height of the Capitoline Hill on which\r\nstood the temples and public edifices, symbols of the institutions\r\nwhich they sought to violate.\" But there was no tragic suggestion in\r\nour little party, conducted about by the prattling, simple, affectionate\r\nlittle woman, so homely, tender, and charitable. \"At parting,\" wrote\r\nmy father, \"she kissed my wife most affectionately on each cheek,\r\n'because,' she said, 'you look so sweetly'; and then she turned towards\r\nmyself. I was in a state of some little tremor, not knowing what might\r\nbe about to befall me, but she merely pressed my hand, and we parted,\r\nprobably never to meet again. God bless her good heart, and every\r\ninch of her little body, not forgetting her red nose, big as it is\r\nin proportion to the rest of her! She is a most amiable little woman,\r\nworthy to be the maiden aunt of the whole human race!\"\r\n\r\nVenerable Mrs. Jameson, author of a little library of writings on\r\nItalian art, was likewise of our company occasionally; and she evinced\r\na marked liking for my father, which was remarkable, inasmuch as he was\r\nable to keep no sort of pace with her in her didactic homilies, which\r\nwere delivered with a tranquil, ex-cathedra manner, befitting one who\r\nwas the authority on her subject; one would no more have thought of\r\nquestioning her verdicts than those of Ruskin; but I should have liked\r\nto see the latter and her together, with a difference between them. Her\r\nlegs were less active than her mind, and most of our expeditions with\r\nher were made in carriages, from which she dispensed her wisdom placidly\r\nas we went along, laying the dust of our ignorance with the droppings\r\nof her erudition, like a watering-cart. However, she so far condescended\r\nfrom her altitudes as to speak very cordially of my father's books, for\r\nwhich he expressed proper acknowledgment; and she had a motherly way\r\nof holding his hand in hers when he took leave of her, and looking\r\nmaternally in his face, which made him somewhat uneasy. \"Were we to meet\r\noften,\" he remarked,\r\n\r\n\"I should be a little afraid of her embracing me outright--a thing to be\r\ngrateful for, but by no means to be glad of!\" We drove one day to some\r\nexcavations which had just been opened near the tomb of Cecilia Metella,\r\noutside the walls of Rome. Both Christian and Roman graves had been\r\nfound, and they had been so recently discovered that, as my father\r\nobserved, there could have been very little intervention of persons\r\n(though much of time) between the departure of the friends of the\r\ndead and our own visit. The large, excavated chambers were filled with\r\nsarcophagi, beautifully sculptured, and their walls were ornamented with\r\nfree-hand decoration done in wet plaster, a marvellous testimony to the\r\nrapid skill of the artists. The sarcophagi were filled with the bones\r\nand the dust of the ancient people who had once, in the imperial prime\r\nof Rome, walked about her streets, prayed to her gods, and feasted at\r\nher banquets. My father remarked on the fact that many of the sarcophagi\r\nwere sculptured with figures that seemed anything but mournful in their\r\ndemeanor; but Mrs. Jameson said that there was almost always, in\r\nthe subject chosen, some allusion to death, instancing the story of\r\nMeleager, an Argonaut, who, I think, slew the Calydonian boar, and\r\nafterwards his two uncles, who had tried to get the boar's hide away\r\nfrom Meleager's beloved Atalanta; whereupon the young hero was brought\r\nto death by his mother, who in turn killed herself. It is one of the\r\nmost thoroughgoing of the classic tragedies, and was a favorite theme\r\nfor the sculptors of sarcophagi. Certainly, in the sarcophagi of the\r\nVatican the bas-reliefs are often scenes of battle, the rush of men and\r\nhorses, and the ground strewn with dead; and in others, a dying person\r\nseems to be represented, with his friends weeping along the sides of the\r\nsarcophagus; but often, too, the allusion to death, if it exists at all,\r\nis very remote. The old Romans, like ourselves, had individual ways of\r\nregarding the great change; according to their mood and faith, they were\r\nhopeful or despairing. But death is death, think of it how we will.\r\n\r\nI think it was on a previous occasion that I went with my father, afoot,\r\nalong this same mighty Appian Way, beside which rise so many rounded\r\nstructures, vast as fortresses, containing the remains of the dead of\r\nlong ago, and culminating in the huge mass of the Cecilia Metella tomb,\r\nwith the mediaeval battlements on its summit. And it was on that walk\r\nthat we met the calf of The Marble Faun: \"A well-grown calf,\" my father\r\nsays in his notes, \"who seemed frolicsome, shy, and sociable all at the\r\nsame time; for he capered and leaped to one side, and shook his head, as\r\nI passed him, but soon came galloping behind me, and again started aside\r\nwhen I looked round.\" How little I suspected then (or the bull-calf\r\neither, for that matter) that he was to frolic his way into literature,\r\nand go gambolling down the ages to distract the anxious soul of the\r\nlover of Hilda! Another walk of ours was to the huge, green mound of the\r\nMonte Testaccio; it was, at that period, pierced by numerous cavities,\r\nin the dark coolness of which stores of native wines were kept; and\r\nthey were sold to customers at the rude wooden tables in front of the\r\nexcavations, in flasks shaped like large drops of water, protected with\r\nplaited straw. When, nowadays, in New York or other cities here, I go to\r\nan Italian restaurant, I always call for one of these flasks, and think,\r\nas I drink its contents, of that afternoon with my father. It was the\r\nfirst time I had been permitted to taste a fermented liquor. I liked it\r\nvery much, and got two glasses of it; and when we rose to depart I was\r\ngreatly perplexed, and my father was vastly tickled, to discover a lack\r\nof coherence between my legs and my intentions. It speedily passed off,\r\nfor the wines are of the lightest and airiest description; but when, a\r\nlittle later on in life, I came to read that Horatian verse describing\r\nhow, turning from barbaric splendors such as the Persians affect, he\r\nbinds his brows with simple myrtle, and sips, beneath the shadow of his\r\ngarden bower, the pure vintage of the native grape, I better appreciated\r\nthe poetry of the theme from having enjoyed that Testaccionesque\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nIt was in Rome, too, that I first came in contact with death. It aroused\r\nmy liveliest curiosity, but, as I remember, no alarm; partly, I suspect,\r\nbecause I was unable to believe that there was anything real in the\r\nspectacle. The scene has been woven into the texture of the Italian\r\nromance; it is there described almost as it actually presented itself\r\nto the author's observation. A dead monk of the Capuchin order lay on a\r\nbier in the nave of their church, and while we looked at him a stream\r\nof blood flowed from his nostrils. We went down afterwards, I recollect,\r\ninto the vaults, and saw the fine, Oriental loam in which the body was\r\nto lie; and it seems to me there were arches and other architectural\r\nfeatures composed of skulls and bones of long-dead brothers of the\r\norder. He must have been a fantastic and saturnine genius who first\r\nsuggested this idea.\r\n\r\nAnother subterranean expedition of ours was to the Catacombs, the\r\nmidnight passages of which seemed to be made of bones, and niches\r\ncontaining the dust of unknown mortality, which were duskily revealed in\r\nthe glimmer of our moccoli as we passed along in single file. Sometimes\r\nwe came to chambers, one of which had in it a bier covered with glass,\r\nin which was a body which still preserved some semblance of the\r\nhuman form. There were occasional openings in the vaulted roof of the\r\ncorridors, but for the most part the darkness was Egyptian, and for a\r\nfew moments a thrill of anxiety was caused by the disappearance either\r\nof my sister Una or of Ada Shepard; I forget which. They were soon\r\nfound, but the guide read us a homily upon the awful peril of lifelong\r\nentombment which encompassed us. But the air was dry and cool, and the\r\nwhole adventure, from my point of view, enjoyable.\r\n\r\nAgain, we went down a long flight of steps somewhere near the Forum,\r\ntill we reached a pitch-black place, where we waited till a guide came\r\nup from still lower depths, down into which we followed him--each with\r\na moccolo--till we felt level earth or stone beneath our feet, and stood\r\nin what I suppose is as lightless a hole as can exist in nature. It was\r\nwet, too, and the smell of it was deadly and dismal. This, however, was\r\nthe prison in which the old Romans used to confine important prisoners,\r\nsuch as Jugurtha and the Apostle Peter; and here they were strangled to\r\ndeath or left to starve. It was the Mamertine Prison. I did not like it.\r\nI also recall the opening of an oubliette in the castle of San Angelo,\r\nwhich affected me like a nightmare. Before leaving Concord, in 1853, I\r\nhad once tumbled through a rotten board into a well, dug by the side of\r\nthe road ages before, and had barely saved myself from dropping to the\r\nbottom, sixty feet below, by grabbing the weeds which grew on the margin\r\nof the hole. I was not much scared at the moment; but the next day,\r\ntaking my father to the scene of the accident, he remarked that had I\r\nfallen in I never could have got out again; upon which I conceived a\r\nhorror of the well which haunts me in my dreams even to this day. Only\r\na tuft of grass between me and such a fate! I was, therefore, far from\r\ncomfortable beside the oubliette, and was glad to emerge again into the\r\nRoman sunshine.\r\n\r\nOne night we climbed the Pincian Hill, and saw, far out across Rome,\r\nthe outlines of St. Peter's dome in silver light. While we were thinking\r\nthat nothing could be more beautiful, all of a sudden the delicate\r\nsilver bloomed out into a golden glory, which made everybody say,\r\n\"Oh!\" Was it more beautiful or not? Theoretically, I prefer the silver\r\nillumination; but, as a matter of fact, I must confess that I liked the\r\ngolden illumination better. We were told that the wonder was performed\r\nby convicts, who lay along the dome and applied their matches to the\r\nlamps at the word of command, and that, inasmuch as the service was apt\r\nto prove fatal to the operators, these convicts were allowed certain\r\nalleviations of their condition for doing it. I suppose it is done by\r\nelectricity now, and the convicts neither are killed nor obtain any\r\nconcessions. Such are the helps and hindrances of civilization!\r\n\r\nShortly after this, on a cool and cloudy night, I was down in the\r\nPiazza, del Popolo and saw the fireworks, the only other pyrotechnic\r\nexhibition I had witnessed having been a private one in Rock Park,\r\nwhich, I think, I have described. This Roman one was very different, and\r\nI do not believe I have ever since seen another so fine. The whole front\r\nof the Pincian was covered with fiery designs, and in the air overhead\r\nwonderful fiery serpents and other devices skimmed, arched, wriggled,\r\nshot aloft, and detonated. A boy accepts appearances as realities; and\r\nthese fireworks doubtless enlarged my conceptions of the possibilities\r\nof nature, and substantiated the fables of the enchanters.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: THE MARBLE FAUN]\r\n\r\nThe Faun of Praxiteles, as the world knows, attracted my father, though\r\nhe could not have visited it often; for both in his notes and in his\r\nromance he makes the same mistake as to the pose of the figure: \"He has\r\na pipe,\" he says in the former, \"or some such instrument of music in the\r\nhand which rests upon the tree, and the other, I think, hangs carelessly\r\nby his side.\" Of course, the left arm, the one referred to, is held\r\nakimbo on his left hip. That my father's eyes were, however, already\r\nawake to the literary and moral possibilities of the Faun is shown by\r\nhis further observations, which are much the same as those which appear\r\nin the book. \"The whole person,\" he says, \"conveys the idea of an\r\namiable and sensual nature, easy, mirthful, apt for jollity, yet not\r\nincapable of being touched by pathos. The Faun has no principle, nor\r\ncould comprehend it, yet is true and honest by virtue of his simplicity;\r\nvery capable, too, of affection. He might be refined through his\r\nfeelings, so that the coarser, animal part of his nature would be\r\nthrown into the background, though liable to assert itself at any time.\r\nPraxiteles has only expressed the animal part of the nature by one (or,\r\nrather, two) definite signs--the two ears, which go up in a little peak,\r\nnot likely to be discovered on slight inspection, and, I suppose, they\r\nare covered with downy fur. A tail is probably hidden under the garment.\r\nOnly a sculptor of the finest imagination, most delicate taste, and\r\nsweetest feeling would have dreamed of representing a faun under this\r\nguise; and, if you brood over it long enough, all the pleasantness of\r\nsylvan life, and all the genial and happy characteristics of the brute\r\ncreation, seem to be mixed in him with humanity--trees, grass, flowers,\r\ncattle, deer, and unsophisticated man.\" This passage shows how much\r\nmy father was wont to trust to first impressions, and even more on the\r\nmoral than on the material side. He recognized a truth in the first\r\ntouch--the first thought--which he was wary of meddling with afterwards,\r\ncontenting himself with slightly developing it now and then, and\r\nsmoothing a little the form and manner of its presentation. The finest\r\nart is nearest to the most veritable nature--to such as have the eye to\r\nsee the latter aright. Rome, like other ancient cities which have fallen\r\nfrom the positive activity of their original estate, has one great\r\nadvantage over other places which one wishes to see (like London, for\r\ninstance), that the whole business of whoever goes there, who has any\r\nbusiness whatever, is to see it; and when the duty-sights have been\r\nduly done, the sight-seer then first begins to live his true life in\r\nindependence and happiness, going where he lists, staying no longer than\r\nhe pleases, and never knowing, when he sallies forth in the morning,\r\nwhat, or how many, or how few things he will have accomplished by\r\nnightfall.\r\n\r\nThe duty to see is indeed the death of real vision; the official\r\ncicerone leads you anywhere but to the place or thing that you are in\r\nthe mood to behold or understand. But with his disappearance the fun\r\nand the pageant begin; one's eyes are at last opened, and beauty and\r\nsignificance flow in through every pore of the senses. It is in this\r\nbetter phase of his Roman sojourn that I picture my father; he trudges\r\ntranquilly and happily to and fro, with no programme and no obligations,\r\nabsorbing all things with that quiet, omnivorous glance of his; pausing\r\nwhenever he takes the fancy, and contemplating for moments or minutes\r\nwhatever strikes his fancy; often turning aside from egregious\r\nspectacles and giving his attention to apparent trifles, to the mere\r\npassing show; pondering on the tuft of flowers in a cranny of the\r\nColiseum wall, on the azure silhouette of the Alban Mountains, on the\r\nmoss collected on the pavement beneath the aperture in the roof of the\r\nPantheon, on the picturesque deformity of old, begging Beppo on the\r\nsteps of the Piazza, d' Espagna. I am trudging joyously beside\r\nhim, hanging on to his left hand (the other being occupied with his\r\nhook-headed cane), asking him innumerable questions, to which he\r\ncomfortably, or abstractedly, or with humorous impatience, replies; or\r\nI run on before him, or lag behind, busy with my endless occupation of\r\npicking up things to me curious and valuable, and filling with them my\r\nmuch-enduring pockets; in this way drinking in Rome in my own way,\r\nalso, and to my boyish advantage. He tells me tales of old Rome, always\r\napposite to the occasion; draws from me, sometimes, my private views as\r\nto persons, places, and scenes, and criticises those views in his own\r\nterse, arch, pregnant way, the force and pertinency whereof are revealed\r\nto me only in my later meditations upon them. It is only after one has\r\nbegun to deal in this way with Rome that its magic and spell begin to\r\nwork upon one; and they are never to be shaken off. Anxiety and pain may\r\nbe mingled with them, as was the case with my father before we said\r\nour final farewell to the mighty city; but it is thereby only the more\r\nendeared to one. Rome is one of the few central facts of the world,\r\nbecause it is so much more than a fact. Byron is right--it is the city\r\nof the soul.\r\n\r\nOn one of the last evenings of our first season we went to the\r\nThompsons', and were there shown, among other things, a portfolio\r\nof sketches. There is in The Marble Faun a chapter called \"Miriam's\r\nStudio,\" in which occurs a reference to a portfolio of sketches by\r\nMiriam herself; the hint for it may have been taken from the portfolio\r\nof Mr. Thompson, though the sketches themselves were of a very different\r\nquality and character. The latter collection pleased me, because I was\r\njust beginning to fill an album of my own with such lopsided attempts to\r\nrepresent real objects, and yet more preposterous imaginative sallies as\r\nmy age and nature suggested. My father was interested in them on account\r\nof the spiritual vigor which belongs to the artist's first vision of\r\nhis subject. In their case, as well as in his own, he felt that it was\r\nimpossible, as Browning put it, to \"recapture that first, fine, careless\r\nrapture.\" But the man of letters has an advantage over the man of paint\r\nand canvas in the matter of being able to preserve the original spirit\r\nin the later, finished design.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of this first season in Rome the Bryants came to town,\r\nand the old poet, old in aspect even then, called on us; but he was not\r\na childly man, and we youngsters stood aloof and contemplated with awe\r\nhis white, Merlin beard and tranquil but chilly eyes. Near the end of\r\nMay William Story invited us to breakfast with him; the Bryants and Miss\r\nHosmer and some English people were there; and I understood nothing of\r\nwhat passed except the breakfast, which was good, until, at the end of\r\nthe session, my father and Story began to talk about the superstition as\r\nto Friday, and they agreed that, of course, it was nonsense, but that,\r\nnevertheless, it did have an influence on both of them. It probably has\r\nan influence on everybody who has ever heard of it. Many of us protest\r\nindignantly that we don't believe in it, but the protest itself implies\r\nsomething not unlike believing.\r\n\r\nFinally, on the 24th of May, we left our Pincian palace, and got into\r\nand on the huge _vettura_ which was to carry us to Florence, a week's\r\njourney. It was to be one of the most delightful and blessed of our\r\nforeign experiences; my father often said that he had enjoyed nothing\r\nelse so much, the vetturino (who happened to be one of the honestest and\r\nsweetest-tempered old fellows in Italy) taking upon himself the entire\r\nmanagement of everything, down to ordering the meals and paying the\r\ntolls, thus leaving us wholly unembarrassed and free from responsibility\r\nwhile traversing a route always historically and generally scenically\r\ncharming. But we were destined, on the threshold of the adventure, to\r\nundergo one of those evil quarters of an hour which often usher in a\r\nperiod of special sunshine; for we were forced into a desperate conflict\r\nwith our servant-girl, Lalla, and her mother over a question of wages.\r\nThe girl had done chores for us during our residence at the Palazzo\r\nLarazani, and had seemed to be a very amiable little personage; she\r\nwas small, slim, and smiling, and, though dirty and inefficient, was no\r\nworse, so far as we could discover, than any other Roman servant-girl.\r\nWhen we had fixed on the date of our departure, Lalla had been asked how\r\nmuch warning she wanted; she replied, a fortnight; which, accordingly,\r\nwas given her, with a few days thrown in for good measure. But when the\r\nday arrived she claimed a week's more pay, and her old mother had a bill\r\nof her own for fetching water. According to my observation, travelling\r\nAmericans have little or no conscience; to avoid trouble they will\r\nsubmit to imposition, not to mention their habit of spoiling tradesmen,\r\nwaiters, and other foreign attendants by excessive tips and payments.\r\nBut my father and mother, though apt enough to make liberal bargains,\r\nwere absolutely incorruptible and immovable when anything like barefaced\r\nrobbery was attempted upon them; and they refused to present Lalla and\r\nher mother with a single baioccho more than was their due. Moreover, the\r\npatrone, or proprietor, of the Palazzo had mulcted them some six scudi\r\nfor Lalla's profuse breakages of glass and crockery during our stay.\r\n\r\nIt was early morning when we set out, and only the faithful Thompsons\r\nwere there to bid us farewell. Lalla and her tribe, however, were\r\non hand, and violently demanded the satisfaction of their iniquitous\r\nclaims. \"No!\" said my father, and \"No!\" said my mother, like the judges\r\nof the Medes and Persians. Thereupon the whole House of Lalla, but Lalla\r\nand her mother especially, gave us an example of what an Italian can do\r\nin the way of cursing an enemy. Ancient forms of malediction, which had\r\nbeen current in the days of the early Roman kings, were mingled with\r\nevery damning invention that had been devised during the Middle Ages,\r\nand ever since then; and they were all hurled at us in shrill, screaming\r\ntones, accompanied by fell and ominous gestures and inarticulate yells\r\nof superheated frenzy. Nothing could surpass the volubility of this\r\ncursing, unless it were the animosity which prompted it; no crime that\r\nanybody, since Cain slew Abel, had or could have committed deserved\r\na tenth part of the calamities and evil haps which this preposterous\r\nfamily called down upon our heads, who had committed no crime at\r\nall, but quite the contrary. When, in after-years, I heard Booth, as\r\nRichelieu, threaten \"the curse of Rome\" upon his opponents, I shuddered,\r\nwondering whether he had any notion what the threat meant. Through it\r\nall my mother's ordinarily lovely and peaceful countenance expressed\r\na sad but unalterable determination; and my father kept smiling in a\r\ncertain dangerous way that he sometimes had in moments of great peril or\r\nstress, but said nothing; while Mr. Thompson indignantly called upon\r\nthe cursers to cease and to beware, and my dear friend Eddy looked\r\ndistressed to the verge of tears. He squeezed my hand as I got into the\r\n_vettura_, and told me not to mind--the Lalla people were wicked,\r\nand their ill-wishes would return upon their own heads. A handful of\r\nten-cent pieces, or their Roman equivalent, would have stopped the whole\r\noutcry and changed it into blessings; but I think my father would not\r\nhave yielded had the salvation of Rome and of all Italy depended\r\nupon it. His eyes gleamed, as I have seen them do on one or two other\r\noccasions only, as we drove away, with the screams pursuing us, and that\r\nsmile still hovered about his mouth. But we drove on; Gaetano cracked\r\nhis long whip, our four steeds picked up their feet and rattled our\r\nvehicle over the Roman cobble-stones; we passed the Porta del Popolo,\r\nand were stretching along, under the summer sunshine, upon the white\r\nroad that led to Florence. It was a divine morning; the turmoil and the\r\nstrife were soon forgotten, and for a week thenceforward there was\r\nonly unalloyed felicity before us. Poor, evil-invoking Lalla had passed\r\nforever out of our sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n     In Othello's predicament--Gaetano--Crystals and snail-\r\n     shells--Broad, flagstone pavements--Fishing-rods and blow-\r\n     pipes--Ghostly yarns--Conservative effects of genius--An\r\n     ideal bust and a living one--The enigma of spiritualism--A\r\n     difficult combination to overthrow--The dream-child and the\r\n     Philistine--Dashing and plunging this way and that--Teresa\r\n     screamed for mercy--Grapes and figs and ghostly voices--My\r\n     father would have settled there--Kirkup the necromancer--A\r\n     miraculous birth--A four-year-old medium--The mysterious\r\n     touch--An indescribable horror--Not even a bone of her was\r\n     left--Providence takes very long views.\r\n\r\nThe railroad which now unites Rome with Florence defrauds travellers\r\nof some of the most agreeable scenery in Italy, and one of the most\r\ntime-honored experiences; and as for the beggars who infested the route,\r\nthey must long since have perished of inanition--not that they needed\r\nwhat travellers gave them in the way of alms, but that, like Othello,\r\ntheir occupation being gone, they must cease to exist. Never again could\r\nthey look forward to pestering a tourist; never exhibit a withered arm\r\nor an artistic ulcer; never mutter anathemas against the obdurate, or\r\ncall down blessings upon the profuse. What was left them in life? And\r\nwhat has become of the wayside inns, and what of the vetturinos? A\r\nman like Gaetano, by himself, was enough to modify radically one's\r\nconception of the possibilities of the Italian character. In appearance\r\nhe was a strong-bodied Yankee farmer, with the sun-burned, homely,\r\nkindly, shrewd visage, the blue jumper, the slow, canny ways, the silent\r\nperception and enjoyment of humorous things, the infrequent but timely\r\nspeech. It was astonishing to hear him speaking Italian out of a mouth\r\nwhich seemed formed only to emit a Down-East drawl and to chew tobacco.\r\nIn disposition and character this son of old Rome was, so far as we,\r\nduring our week of constant and intimate association with him, could\r\njudge, absolutely without fault; he was mild, incorruptible, and placid,\r\nas careful of us as a father of his children, and he grew as fond of\r\nus as we were of him, so that the final parting, after the journey was\r\ndone, was really a moving scene. I have found the tribe of cabbies, in\r\nall countries, to be, as a rule, somewhat cantankerous and sinister;\r\nbut Gaetano compensated for all his horse-driving brethren. To be sure,\r\n_vettura_ driving is not like cabbing, and Gaetano was in the habit of\r\ngetting out often and walking up the hills, thus exercising his liver.\r\nBut he must have been born with a strong predisposition to goodness,\r\nwhich he never outgrew.\r\n\r\nSave for a few showers, it was fine weather all the way, and a good part\r\nof the way was covered on foot by my father and me; for the hills were\r\nmany, and the winding ascents long, and we would alight and leave\r\nthe slow-moving vehicle, with its ponderous freight, behind us, to be\r\novertaken perhaps an hour or two later on the levels or declivities.\r\nGaetano was a consummate whip, and he carried his team down the descents\r\nand round the exciting turns at a thrilling pace, while the yards of\r\nwhiplash cracked and detonated overhead like a liliputian thunder-storm.\r\nOn the mountain-tops were romantic villages, surrounding rock-built\r\ncastles which had been robber strongholds centuries before, and we\r\ntraversed peaceful plains which had been the scenes of famous Roman\r\nbattles, and whose brooks had run red with blood before England's\r\nhistory began. We paused a day in Perugia, and received the Bronze\r\nPontiff's benediction; the silent voices of history were everywhere\r\nspeaking to the spiritual ear. Meanwhile I regarded the trip as being,\r\nprimarily, an opportunity to collect unusual snail-shells; and we passed\r\nthrough a region full of natural crystals, some of them of such size as\r\nto prompt my father to forbid their being added to our luggage. I could\r\nnot understand his insensibility. Could I have had my way, I would have\r\nloaded a wain with them. I liked the villages and castles, too, and\r\nthe good dinners at the inns, and the sound sleeps in mediaeval beds\r\nat night; but the crystals and the snail-shells were the true aim and\r\nsustenance of my life. My mother and sister sketched continually, and\r\nMiss Shepard was always ready to tell us the story of the historical\r\nfeatures which we encountered; it astounded me to note how much she knew\r\nabout things which she had never before seen. One afternoon we drove\r\ndown from surrounding heights to Florence, which lay in a golden haze\r\ncharacteristic of Italian Junes in this latitude. Powers, the sculptor,\r\nhad promised to engage lodgings for us, but he had not expected us\r\nso soon, and meanwhile we put up at a hotel near by, and walked out a\r\nlittle in the long evening, admiring the broad, flagstone pavements and\r\nall the minor features which made Florence so unlike Rome. The next day\r\nbegan our acquaintance with the Powers family, who, with the Brownings,\r\nconstituted most of the social element of our sojourn. Powers had an\r\nagreeable wife, two lovely daughters, and a tall son, a few years older\r\nthan I, and a pleasant companion, though he could not take the place of\r\nEddy Thompson in my heart. He was clever with his hands, and soon began\r\nto make fishing-rods for me, having learned of my predilection for the\r\nsport. There were no opportunities to fish in Florence; but the rods\r\nwhich Bob Powers produced were works of art, straight and tapering, and\r\nmade in lengths, which fitted into one another--a refinement which was\r\nnew to me, who had hitherto imagined nothing better than a bamboo pole.\r\nBob finally confided to me that he straightened his rods by softening\r\nthe wood in steam; but I found that they did not long retain their\r\nstraightness; and, there being no use for them, except the delight of\r\nthe eye, I presently lost interest in them. Then Bob showed me how to\r\nmake blow-pipes by pushing out the pith from the stems of some species\r\nof bushy shrub that grew outside the walls. He made pellets of clay from\r\nhis father's studio; and I was deeply affected by the long range and\r\naccuracy of these weapons. We used to ensconce ourselves behind the\r\nblinds of the front windows of Powers's house, and practise through the\r\nslats at the passers-by in the street. They would feel a smart hit and\r\nlook here and there, indignant; but, after a while, seeing nothing\r\nbut the innocent fronts of sleepy houses, would resume their way. Bob\r\ninherited his handiness from his father, who seemed a master of all\r\ncrafts, a true Yankee genius. He might have made his fortune as an\r\ninventor had he not happened to turn the main stream of his energy in\r\nthe direction of sculpture. I believe that the literary art was the only\r\none in which he did not claim proficiency, and that was a pity, because\r\nPowers's autobiography would have been a book of books. He was a\r\nSwedenborgian by faith, but he also dabbled somewhat in spiritualism,\r\nwhich was having a vogue at that time, owing partly to the exploits of\r\nthe American medium Home. Marvellous, indeed, were the ghostly yarns\r\nPowers used to spin, and they lost nothing by the physical appearance of\r\nthe narrator, with his tall figure, square brow, great, black eyes, and\r\nimpressive gestures; his voice, too, was deep and flexible, and could\r\nsink into the most blood-curdling tones. My recollection is that Powers\r\nwas always clad in a long, linen pinafore, reaching from his chin to his\r\nfeet, and daubed with clay, and on his head a cap made either of paper,\r\nlike a baker's, or, for dress occasions, of black velvet. His homely\r\nways and speech, which smacked of the Vermont farm as strongly as if he\r\nhad just come thence, whereas in truth he had lived in Florence, at this\r\ntime, about twenty years, and had won high fame as a sculptor, tempted\r\none to suspect him of affectation--of a pose; and there is no doubt that\r\nPowers was aware of the contrast between his physical presentment and\r\nhis artistic reputation, and felt a sort of dramatic pleasure in it.\r\nNevertheless, it would be unjust to call him affected; he was a big man,\r\nin all senses of the term, and his instinct of independence led him to\r\nrepudiate all external polish and ear-marks of social culture, and to\r\nsay, as it were, \"You see, a plain Vermont countryman can live half a\r\nlifetime in the centre of artificial refinement and rival by the works\r\nof his native genius the foremost living artists, and yet remain the\r\nsame simple, honest old sixpence that he was at home!\" It was certainly\r\na more manly and wholesome attitude than that of the ordinary American\r\nforeign resident, who makes a point of forgetting his native ways and\r\npoint of view, and aping the habits and traits of his alien associates.\r\nAnd, besides, Powers had such an immense temperament and individuality\r\nthat very likely he could not have modified them successfully even had\r\nhe been disposed to do so.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: HIRAM POWERS]\r\n\r\nHis daughters, as I have said, were lovely creatures. Powers was at this\r\ntime modelling an ideal bust of a woman, and one day I went into his\r\nstudio expecting to find Bob there, but the studio was empty but for the\r\nbust, which I now had an opportunity to contemplate at my ease for the\r\nfirst time. I thought it very beautiful, and there was something about\r\nthe face which reminded me of somebody, I could not decide who. Just\r\nthen a portiere in the doorway parted, and in came a living bust, a\r\nreality in warm flesh and blood, compared with which the ideal seemed\r\nsecond-rate. It belonged to one of Powers's daughters, who had come\r\nfor a sitting; she was serving as her father's model. Upon seeing the\r\nunexpected boy, fixed there in speechless admiration, the young lady\r\nuttered a scream and vanished. I now knew whom the face of the clay\r\neffigy reminded me of, and afterwards when I saw beautiful statues I\r\nthought of her, and shook my head.\r\n\r\nMy father and Powers took a strong fancy to each other, and met and\r\ntalked a great deal. As I just said now, spiritualism was a fad at that\r\ntime, and Powers was pregnant with marvels which he had either seen\r\nor heard of, and which he was always ready to attempt to explain on\r\nphilosophical grounds. My father would listen to it all, and both\r\nbelieve it and not believe it. He felt, I suppose, that Powers was\r\ntelling the truth, but he was not persuaded that all the truth was in\r\nPowers's possession, or in any one else's. Powers also had a great deal\r\nto say concerning the exoteric and esoteric truths of sculpture; his\r\nracy individuality marked it all. He would not admit that there was any\r\nlimit to what might be done with marble; and when my father asked him\r\none day whether he could model a blush on a woman's cheek, he said,\r\nstoutly, that the thing was possible. My father, as his manner was\r\nwith people, went with the sculptor as far as he chose to carry him,\r\naccepting all his opinions and judgments, and becoming Powers, so far as\r\nhe might, for the time being, in order the better to get to the root of\r\nhis position. And then, afterwards, he would return to his own self, and\r\nquietly examine Powers's assertions and theories in the dry light. My\r\nfather was two men, one sympathetic and intuitional, the other critical\r\nand logical; together they formed a combination which could not be\r\nthrown off its feet.\r\n\r\nWe had already met the Brownings in London; but at this period they\r\nbelonged in Italy more than anywhere else, and Florence formed the best\r\nsetting for the authors both of Aurora Leigh and of Sordello. They lived\r\nin a villa called Casa Guidi, and with them was their son, a boy\r\nyounger than myself, whom they called Pennini, though his real name\r\nwas something much less fastidious. Penni, I believe, used to be an\r\nassistant of Raphael early in the sixteenth century, and Pennini may\r\nhave been nicknamed after him. His mother, who was an extravagant woman\r\non the emotional and spiritual plane, made the poor little boy wear\r\nhis hair curled in long ringlets down his back, and clad him in a fancy\r\ncostume of black velvet, with knickerbockers and black silk stockings;\r\nhe was homely of face, and looked \"soft,\" as normal boys would say. But\r\nhis parents were determined to make an ideal dream-child of him, and, of\r\ncourse, he had to submit. I had the contempt for him which a philistine\r\nboy feels for a creature whom he knows he can lick with one hand tied\r\nbehind his back, and I had nothing whatever to say to him. But Pennini\r\nwas not such a mollycoddle and ass as he looked, and when he grew up he\r\ngave evidence enough of having a mind and a way of his own. My mother\r\ntook him at his mother's valuation, and both she and my father have\r\nexpressed admiration of the whole Browning tribe in their published\r\njournals. Mrs. Browning seemed to me a sort of miniature monstrosity;\r\nthere was no body to her, only a mass of dark curls and queer, dark\r\neyes, and an enormous mouth with thick lips; no portrait of her has\r\ndared to show the half of it. Her hand was like a bird's claw. Browning\r\nwas a lusty, active, energetic person, dashing and plunging this way and\r\nthat with wonderful impetus and suddenness; he was never still a moment,\r\nand he talked with extraordinary velocity and zeal. There was a mass\r\nof wild hair on his head, and he wore bushy whiskers. He appeared very\r\ndifferent twenty years later, when I met him in London, after his wife's\r\ndeath; he was quiet and sedate, with close-cut silvery hair and pointed\r\nbeard, and the rather stout, well-dressed figure of a British gentleman\r\nof the sober middle class. It is difficult to harmonize either of these\r\noutsides with the poet within--that remarkable imagination, intellect,\r\nand analytical faculty which have made him one of the men of the\r\ncentury. There was a genial charm in Browning, emphasized, in this\r\nearlier time, with a bewildering vivacity and an affluence of courtesy.\r\nIn his mature phase he was still courteous and agreeable when he chose\r\nto be so, but was also occasionally supercilious and repellent, and\r\nassiduously cultivated smart society. I once asked him, in 1879, why he\r\nmade his poetry so often obscure, and he replied, frankly, that he did\r\nso because he couldn't help it; the inability to put his thoughts in\r\nclear phrases had always been a grief to him. This statement was, to me,\r\nunexpected, and it has a certain importance.\r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks in Casa Bella, opposite Powers's house, Florence grew\r\nso hot that we were glad of an opportunity to rent the Villa Montauto,\r\nup on the hill of Bellosguardo, less than a mile beyond the city gate.\r\nThe villa, with two stories and an attic, must have been nearly two\r\nhundred feet long, and was two or three rooms deep; at the hither end\r\nrose a tower evidently much older than the house attached to it. Near\r\nthe foot of the tower grew an ancient tree, on a projecting branch of\r\nwhich we soon had a swing suspended, and all of us children did some\r\nvery tall swinging. There was a little girl of ten belonging to the\r\nestate, named Teresa, an amiable, brown-haired, homely little personage.\r\nWe admitted her to our intimacy, and swung her in the swing till she\r\nscreamed for mercy. The road from Florence, after passing our big iron\r\ngate on the east, continued on westward, beneath the tower and the\r\nparapet of the grounds; beyond extended the wide valley of the Arno,\r\nwith mountains hemming it in, and to the left of the mountains, every\r\nevening, Donati's comet shone, with a golden sweep of tail subtending\r\ntwenty degrees along the horizon. The peasant folk regarded it with\r\nforeboding; and I remember seeing in the book-shops of Rome, before we\r\nleft, pamphlets in both Italian and English, with such titles as \"Will\r\nthe great comet, now rapidly approaching, strike the earth?\" It did not\r\nstrike the earth, but it afforded us a magnificent spectacle during\r\nour stay in Montauto, and the next year it was followed by war between\r\nAustria and France and the evacuation of Venice.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Bellosguardo sloped from the villa north and east, and\r\nthis declivity was occupied by a podere of some dozen acres, on which\r\ngrew grape-vines, olive and fig trees. Every morning, about ten o'clock,\r\nthe peasants on the estate would come in loaded with grapes, which they\r\npiled up on a large table in the reception-hall on the ground floor. We\r\nate them by handfuls, but were never able to finish them. Between times\r\nwe would go out among the fruit trees and devour fresh figs, luscious\r\nwith purple pulp. I had three or four rooms to myself at the western\r\nextremity of the house; they were always cool on the hottest days. There\r\nI was wont to retire to pursue my literary labors; I was still writing\r\nworks on conchology. My sister Una had rooms on the ground floor,\r\nadjoining the chapel. They were haunted by the ghost of a nun, and\r\nseveral times the candle which she took in there at night was moved by\r\ninvisible hands from its place and set down elsewhere. Ghostly voices\r\ncalled to us, and various unaccountable noises were heard now and then,\r\nboth within and without the house; but we children did not mind them,\r\nnot having been bred in the fear of spirits. Indeed, at the instance\r\nof Mrs. Browning, who was often with us, we held spirit seances,\r\nMiss Shepard being the medium, though she mildly protested. Long\r\ncommunications were written down, but the sceptics were not converted,\r\nnor were the believers discouraged. \"I discern in the alleged\r\ncommunications from my wife's mother,\" wrote my father, \"much of her own\r\nbeautiful fancy and many of her preconceived ideas, although thinner\r\nand weaker than at first hand. They are the echoes of her own voice,\r\nreturning out of the lovely chambers of her heart, and mistaken by her\r\nfor the tones of her mother.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost every day some of us made an incursion into Florence. The town\r\nitself seemed to me more agreeable than Rome; but the Boboli Gardens\r\ncould not rival the Borghese, and the Pitti and Uffizi galleries were\r\nnot so captivating as the Vatican and the Capitol. However, the Cascine\r\nand the Lung' Arno were delightful, and the Arno, shallow and placid,\r\nflowing through the midst of the city, was a fairer object than the\r\nmuddy and turbulent Tiber. Men and boys bathed along the banks in the\r\nafternoons and evenings; and the Ponte Vecchio, crowded with grotesque\r\nlittle houses, was a favorite promenade of mine. There was also a large\r\nmarketplace, where the peasant women sold the produce of their farms. My\r\ninsatiable appetite for such things prompted me often to go thither\r\nand eat everything I had money to buy. One day I consumed so many fresh\r\ntomatoes that I had a giddiness in the back of my head, and ate no more\r\ntomatoes for some years. But the place I best liked was the great open\r\nsquare of the Palazzo Vecchio, with the statues of David and of Perseus\r\nunder the Loggia dei Lanzi, a retreat from sun and rain; and the Duomo\r\nand Giotto's Campanile, hard by. The pavements of Florence, smooth as\r\nthe surface of stone canals, were most soothing and comfortable after\r\nthe relentless, sharp cobble-stones of Rome; the low houses that\r\nbordered them seemed to slumber in the hot, still sunshine. What a\r\nsunshine was that! Not fierce and feverish, as in the tropics, but soft\r\nand intense and white. Who would not live in Florence if he could? I\r\nthink my father would have settled there but for his children, to whom\r\nhe wished to give an American education. The thought was often in his\r\nmind; and he perhaps cherished some hope of returning thither later\r\nin life, and letting old age steal gently upon him and his wife in\r\nthe delicious city. But the Celestial City was nearer to him than he\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\nThere was a magical old man in Florence named Kirkup, an Englishman,\r\nthough he had dwelt abroad so many years that he seemed more Florentine\r\nthan the Florentines themselves. He had known, in his youth, Byron,\r\nShelley, Hunt, and Edward Trelawney. After that famous group was\r\ndisparted, Kirkup, having an income sufficient for his needs, came to\r\nFlorence and settled there. He took to antiquarianism, which is a sort\r\nof philtre, driving its votaries mildly insane, and filling them\r\nwith emotions which, on the whole, are probably more often happy than\r\ngrievous. But Kirkup, in the course of his researches into the past,\r\ncame upon the books of the necromancers, and bought and studied them,\r\nand began to practise their spells and conjurations; and by-and-by,\r\nbeing a great admirer and student of Dante, that poet manifested himself\r\nto him in his lonely vigils and told him many unknown facts about his\r\ncareer on earth, and incidentally revealed to him the whereabouts of the\r\nnow-familiar fresco of Dante on the wall of the Bargello Chapel, where\r\nit had been hidden for ages beneath a coat of whitewash. In these occult\r\nresearches, Kirkup, of course, had need of a medium, and he found among\r\nthe Florentine peasants a young girl, radiantly beautiful, who possessed\r\nan extraordinary susceptibility to spiritual influences. Through her\r\nmeans he conversed with the renowned dead men of the past times. But one\r\nday Regina (such was the girl's name), much to the old man's surprise,\r\ngave birth to a child. She herself died, in Kirkup's house, soon after,\r\nand on her death-bed she swore a solemn oath on the crucifix that the\r\nbaby's father was none other than Kirkup himself. The poor old gentleman\r\nhad grown so accustomed to believing in miracles that he made little ado\r\nabout accepting this one also; he received the child as his daughter,\r\nand made provision for her in his will. No one had the heart or thought\r\nit worth while to enlighten him as to certain facts which might have\r\naltered his attitude; but it was well known that Regina had a lover, a\r\nhandsome young Italian peasant, much more capable of begetting children\r\nthan of taking care of them afterwards.\r\n\r\nThese interesting circumstances I did not learn until long after\r\nFlorence had receded into the distance in my memory. But one afternoon,\r\nwith my father and mother, I entered the door of a queer old house close\r\nto the Ponte Vecchio; I was told that it had formerly been a palace of\r\nthe Knights Templars. We ascended a very darksome flight of stairs, and\r\na door was opened by a strange little man. He may have been, at that\r\ntime, some seventy years my senior, but he was little above my height;\r\nhe had long, soft, white hair and a flowing white beard; his features\r\nbore a resemblance to those of Bulwer Lytton, only Bulwer never lived to\r\nanything like Mr. Kirkup's age. Old as he was, our host was very brisk\r\nand polite, and did the honors of his suite of large rooms with much\r\ngrace and fantastic hospitality. Dancing about him, and making friends\r\nfreely with us all meanwhile, was the little girl, Imogen by name, who\r\nwas accredited as the octogenarian's offspring. She was some four or\r\nfive years of age, but intellectually precocious, though a complete\r\nchild, too. Mr. Kirkup said that she, like her beautiful mother, was a\r\npowerful medium, and that he often used to communicate through her with\r\nher mother, who would seem to have kept her secret even after death. The\r\nhouse was stuffed full of curiosities, but was very dirty and cobwebby;\r\nthe pictures and the books looked much in need of a caretaker. The\r\nlittle child frolicked and flitted about the dusky apartments, or seated\r\nherself like a butterfly on the great tomes of magic that were piled in\r\ncorners. Nothing could be stronger or stranger than the contrast between\r\nher and this environment. My father wrote it all down in his journal,\r\nand it evidently impressed his imagination; and she and Kirkup\r\nhimself--_mutatis mutandis_--appear in Dr. Grimshawe's Secret, and\r\nagain, in a somewhat different form, in The Dolliver Romance. There\r\nwas even a Persian kitten, too, to bear little Imogen company. But no\r\nfiction could surpass the singularity of this withered old magician\r\nliving with the pale, tiny sprite of a child of mysterious birth in the\r\nghost-haunted rooms of the ancient palace.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the world of the occult were making a determined attack\r\nupon us during this Florentine sojourn; whichever way we turned we came\r\nin contact with something mysterious. In one of my father's unpublished\r\ndiaries he writes, in reference to the stories with which he was being\r\nregaled by Powers, the Brownings, and others, that he was reminded \"of\r\nan incident that took place at the old manse, in the first summer of our\r\nmarriage. One night, about eleven o'clock, before either my wife or\r\nI had fallen asleep (we had been talking together just before), she\r\nsuddenly asked me why I had touched her shoulder? The next instant she\r\nhad a sense that the touch was not mine, but that of some third presence\r\nin the chamber. She clung to me in great affright, but I got out of\r\nbed and searched the chamber and adjacent entry, and, finding nothing,\r\nconcluded that the touch was a fancied one. My wife, however, has never\r\nvaried in her belief that the incident was supernatural and connected\r\nwith the apparition of old Dr. Harris, who used to show himself to\r\nme daily in the reading-room of the Boston Athenaeum. I am still\r\nincredulous both as to the doctor's identity and as to the reality of\r\nthe mysterious touch. That same summer of our honeymoon, too, George\r\nHillard and his wife were sitting with us in our parlor, when a rustling\r\nas of a silken robe passed from corner to corner of the room, right\r\namong my wife and the two guests, and was heard, I think, by all three.\r\nMrs. Hillard, I remember, was greatly startled. As for myself, I was\r\nreclining on the sofa at a little distance, and neither heard the rustle\r\nnor believed it.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, such things affect one in a degree. Here is a straw to\r\nshow which way the wind of doctrine was blowing with my father: We were\r\nin Siena immediately after the date of our Florentine residence, and\r\nhe and I, leaving the rest of the family at our hotel, sallied forth in\r\nquest of adventures. \"We went to the cathedral,\" he writes, \"and while\r\nstanding near the entrance, or about midway in the nave, we saw a female\r\nfigure approaching through the dimness and distance, far away in the\r\nregion of the high altar; as it drew nearer its air reminded me of Una,\r\nwhom we had left at home. Finally, it came close to us, and proved to\r\nbe Una herself; she had come, immediately after we left the hotel, with\r\nMiss Shepard, and was looking for objects to sketch. It is an empty\r\nthing to write down, but the surprise made the incident stand out very\r\nvividly.\" Una was to pass near the gates of the next world a little\r\nwhile later, and doubtless my father often during that dark period\r\npictured her to himself as a spirit. To make an end of this subject, I\r\nwill quote here my father's account of a story told him by Mrs. Story\r\nwhen we were living in Rome for the second time. The incident of the\r\nwoman's face at the carriage window reappears in The Marble Faun.\r\n\"She told it,\" he says, \"on the authority of Mrs. Gaskell, to whom the\r\npersonages were known. A lady, recently married, was observed to be in a\r\nmelancholy frame of mind, and fell into a bad state of health. She told\r\nher husband that she was haunted with the constant vision of a certain\r\nface, which affected her with an indescribable horror, and was the cause\r\nof her melancholy and illness. The physician prescribed travel, and they\r\nwent first to Paris, where the lady's spirits grew somewhat better, and\r\nthe vision haunted her less constantly. They purposed going to Italy,\r\nand before their departure from Paris a letter of introduction was given\r\nthem by a friend, directed to a person in Rome. On their arrival in Rome\r\nthe letter was delivered; the person called, and in his face the lady\r\nrecognized the precise reality of her vision. By-the-bye, I think the\r\nlady saw this face in the streets of Rome before the introduction took\r\nplace. The end of the story is that the husband was almost immediately\r\nrecalled to England by an urgent summons; the wife disappeared that very\r\nnight, and was recognized driving out of Rome, in a carriage, in tears,\r\nand accompanied by the visionary unknown. It is a very foolish story,\r\nbut told as truth. Mrs. Story also said that in an Etruscan tomb, on the\r\nBarberini estate, the form and impression, in dust, of a female figure\r\nwere discovered. Not even a bone of her was left; but where her neck had\r\nbeen there lay a magnificent necklace, all of gold and of the richest\r\nworkmanship. The necklace, just as it was found (except, I suppose,\r\nfor a little furbishing), is now worn by the Princess Barberini as her\r\nrichest adornment. Mrs. Story herself had on a bracelet composed, I\r\nthink, of seven ancient Etruscan scorabei in carnelian, every one of\r\nwhich has been taken from a separate tomb, and on one side of each was\r\nengraved the signet of the person to whom it had belonged and who\r\nhad carried it to the grave with him. This bracelet would make a good\r\nconnecting link for a series of Etruscan tales, the more fantastic the\r\nbetter!\"\r\n\r\nOn the first day of October, 1859, we left Florence by railway for Siena\r\non our way back to Rome. There had been no drawbacks to our enjoyment of\r\nthe city and of our villa and of the people we had met. We departed with\r\nregret; had we stayed on there, instead, and not again attempted the\r\nfatal air of the Seven Hills, our after chronicles might have been\r\nvery different. But we walk over precipices with our eyes open, or pass\r\nsafely along their verge in the dark, and only the Power who made us\r\nknows why. Providence takes very long views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\n     Burnt Sienna--The Aquila Nera--A grand, noble, gentle\r\n     creature--The most beautiful woman in the world--Better\r\n     friends than ever--A shadow brooded--Boys are whole-souled\r\n     creatures--Franklin Pierce--Miriam, Hilda, Kenyon,\r\n     Donatello--The historian of the Netherlands--When New\r\n     England makes a man--The spell of Trevi--An accession of\r\n     mishaps--My father's mustache--Three steps of stone, the\r\n     fourth, death--Havre, Redcar, Bath, London, Liverpool.\r\n\r\nSiena is distant from Florence, in a direct line, not more than fifty\r\nmiles, but the railway turns the western flank of the mountains, and\r\nkept us full three hours on the trip. I had long been familiar with a\r\npaint in my color-box called Burnt Sienna, and was now much interested\r\nto learn that it was made of the yellow clay on which the city of Siena\r\nstands; and when I discovered for myself that this clay, having formed\r\nthe bed of some antediluvian ocean, was full of fossil shells, I\r\nthought that Siena was a place where I would do well to spend one of my\r\nlifetimes. The odd, parti-colored architecture of the town did not\r\nso much appeal to me, and certainly the streets and squares were less\r\nattractive in themselves than either the Roman or the Florentine ones.\r\nThe shells were personally ugly, but they were shells, and fossils into\r\nthe bargain, and they sufficed for my happiness.\r\n\r\nThe Storys had a villa in Siena, and my father certainly had in the back\r\npart of his mind an idea of settling there, or elsewhere in Italy, now\r\nor later; but after ten days we were on our travels again. There were\r\nno ruins to be seen, that I remember, but many churches and frescoes and\r\nold oil-paintings, which I regarded with indifference. Mediaeval remains\r\ndid not attract me like classic ones. It was here that Story drew the\r\ncaricatures which I have already spoken of, and from the windows of the\r\nroom, as the twilight fell, we could see the great comet, then in its\r\napogee of brilliance. Where will the world be when it comes again? We\r\nhad rooms at the Aquila Nera, looking out on the venerable, gray Palazzo\r\nTolomei. The narrow streets were full of people; the steepness and\r\nirregularity of the thoroughfares of the city produced a feeling of\r\nenergy and activity in the midst of the ancient historic peace. Siena\r\nis, I believe, built about the crater of an extinct volcano. The old\r\nbrick wall of the city was still extant, running up hill and down,\r\nand confining the rusty heaps of houses within its belt. There were\r\nprojecting balconies, crumbling with age, and irregular arcades,\r\nresembling tunnels hewn out of the solid rock. From the windows of\r\nour sitting-room in the hotel we commanded the piazza, in front of the\r\nPalazzo Tolomei, with a pillar in the midst of it, on which was a group\r\nof Romulus and Remus suckled by the wolf, the tradition of the city\r\nbeing that it was founded during the epoch of the Roman kings. My mother\r\nmade a sketch of this monument in her little sketch-book, and my father,\r\naccording to a common custom of his, sat for an hour at the window\r\none day and made a note of every person who passed through the little\r\nsquare, thus getting an idea of the character of the local population\r\nnot otherwise obtainable. I can imagine that, were one born in Siena,\r\none might conceive an ardent affection for it; but, in spite of its\r\npicturesqueness, it never touched my heart like Rome or Florence, or\r\neven London or Paris. I left it without regret, but with specimens of\r\nits fossils in my pockets.\r\n\r\nIt often happens with miracles that they occur in doubles or trebles, in\r\norder, I suppose, to suggest to us that they may be simply instances\r\nof an undiscovered law. Gaetano was a miracle, and he was followed by\r\nConstantino, who, though of an altogether different human type, was\r\nof no less sweet and shining a nature than the other. He was a grand,\r\nnoble, gentle creature, and my mother soon dubbed him \"The Emperor,\"\r\nthough it may be doubted whether the original emperor of that name was\r\nas good a man as ours; he was certainly not nearly so good-looking. He\r\nwas only the driver of our _vettura_ from Siena to Rome, but there was\r\na princely munificence in his treatment of us that made us feel his\r\ndebtors in an indefinitely greater sum than that which technically\r\ndischarged our obligations. He was massive, quiescent, oxlike, with\r\ngreat, slow-moving, black eyes. He had the air of extending to us the\r\nhospitalities of Italy, and our journey assumed the character of a royal\r\nprogress. He was especially devoted to my small sister Rose, and often,\r\ngoing up the hills, he would have her beside him on foot, one of his\r\ngreat hands clasping hers, while with the other he wielded the long whip\r\nthat encouraged the horses. His garments were of the humblest fashion,\r\nbut he so wore them as to make them seem imperial robes. My mother\r\ncaught an excellent likeness of him as he sat before her on the driver's\r\nseat. The second trip was as enjoyable as the first, though it was two\r\nor three days shorter. The route was west of our former one, passing\r\nthrough Radicofani, incrusted round its hill-top; and Bolsena, climbing\r\nbackward from the poisonous shore of its beautiful lake; and Viterbo,\r\nugly and beggar-ridden, though famous forever on account of the war for\r\nGaliana waged between Viterbo and Rome. In the front of an old church in\r\nthe town I saw the carved side of her sarcophagus, incorporate with the\r\nwall. She was the most beautiful woman in the world in her day, and in\r\nthe fight for the possession of her her townsmen overcame the Romans,\r\nbut the latter were permitted, as a salve for their defeat, to have one\r\nfinal glimpse of Galiana as they marched homeward without her. From\r\na window in a tower of one of the gates of the city, therefore, her\r\nheavenly face looked forth and shed a farewell gleam over the dusty,\r\ndefeated ranks of Rome as they filed past, up-looking. The tale is as\r\nold as the incident itself, but I always love to recall it; there is in\r\nit something that touches the soul more inwardly than even the legend of\r\nGrecian Helen.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of October we were back again in Rome, and though we were\r\nnow in new lodgings, the feeling was that of getting home after travels.\r\nThe weather was fine, and we revisited the familiar ruins and gardens,\r\nand renewed our acquaintance with our favorite statues and pictures with\r\nfresh enjoyment. Eddy Thompson and I found each other better\r\nfriends than ever--we had written each other laborious but sincerely\r\naffectionate letters during our separation--and he and I, with one or\r\nmore favored companions sometimes, perambulated Rome incessantly, and\r\nfelt that the world had begun again. But by the 1st of November there\r\ncame to pass an untoward change, and our rejoicing was changed to\r\nlamentation. First, my father himself had a touch of malaria, which\r\nclouded his view of all outward things; and then my sister Una,\r\ndisregarding the law which provides that all persons must be in-doors\r\nin Rome by six o'clock in the evening, caught the veritable Roman fever,\r\nand during four months thereafter a shadow brooded over our snug little\r\nlodgings in the Piazza, Poli. \"It is not a severe attack,\" my father\r\nwrote at the beginning, \"yet it is attended by fits of exceeding\r\ndiscomfort, occasional comatoseness, and even delirium to the extent\r\nof making the poor child talk in rhythmic measure, like a tragic\r\nheroine--as if the fever lifted her feet off the earth; the fever being\r\nseldom dangerous, but is liable to recur on slight occasion hereafter.\"\r\nBut, as it turned out, Una's attack was of the worst kind, and she\r\nsank and sank, till it seemed at last as if she must vanish from us\r\naltogether. Eddy and I held melancholy consultations together, for Eddy,\r\nbesides being my special crony and confidant, had allowed himself to\r\nconceive a heroic and transcendental passion for my sister--one of the\r\nantique, Spenserian sort--and his concern for her condition was only\r\nless than mine. So we went about with solemn faces, comforting each\r\nother as best we might. I remember, when the crisis of the fever\r\nwas reached, taking him into a room and closing the door, and there\r\nimparting to him the news that Una might not recover. We stared drearily\r\ninto each other's faces, and felt that the world would never again be\r\nbright for us. Boys are whole-souled creatures; they feel one thing at a\r\ntime, and feel it with their might.\r\n\r\nHowever, Una safely passed her crisis, thanks mainly to the wonderful\r\nnursing of her mother, and by carnival-time was able to be out again and\r\nto get her share of sugar-plums and flowers. But my mother was exhausted\r\nby her ceaseless vigils in the sick-room, and my father, as I have\r\nbefore intimated, never recovered from the long-drawn fear; it sapped\r\nhis energies at the root, and the continued infirmity of Una's health\r\nprevented what chance there might have been of his recuperation. Yet for\r\nthe moment he could find fun and pleasure in the carnival, and he felt\r\nas never before the searching beauty of the Borghese, the Pincian, and\r\nthe galleries. He was also comforted by the companionship of his friend\r\nFranklin Pierce, who, his Presidential term over, had come to Europe to\r\nget the scent of Washington out of his garments. There was a winning,\r\nirresistible magnetism in the presence of this man. Except my father,\r\nthere was no man in whose company I liked to be so much as in his. I\r\nhad little to say to him, and demanded nothing more than a silent\r\nrecognition from him; but his voice, his look, his gestures, his gait,\r\nthe spiritual sphere of him, were delightful to me; and I suspect that\r\nhis rise to the highest office in our nation was due quite as much to\r\nthis power or quality in him as to any intellectual or even executive\r\nability that he may have possessed. He was a good, conscientious,\r\npatriotic, strong man, and gentle and tender as a woman. He had the\r\nold-fashioned ways, the courtesy, and the personal dignity which are\r\nnot often seen nowadays. His physical frame was immensely powerful and\r\nathletic; but life used him hard, and he was far from considerate of\r\nhimself, and he died at sixty-five, when he might, under more favorable\r\nconditions, have rounded out his century.\r\n\r\nMy father had written nothing, not even his journal, during the period\r\nof Una's illness; but he began to work again now, being moved thereto\r\nnot only as a man whose nature is spontaneously impelled to express\r\nitself on the imaginative side, but also in order to recoup himself for\r\nsome part of the loss of the ten thousand dollars which he had loaned to\r\nJohn O'Sullivan, which, it was now evident, could never be repaid.\r\nHis first conception of the story of The Marble Faun had been as a\r\nnovelette; but he now decided to expand it so as to contain a large\r\namount of descriptive matter; and although the strict rules of artistic\r\nconstruction may have been somewhat relaxed in order to admit these\r\npassages, there is no doubt that the book gained thereby in value as a\r\npermanent addition to literature, the plot, powerful though it is, being\r\nof importance secondary to the creation of an atmosphere which\r\nshould soften the outlines and remove the whole theme into a suitable\r\nremoteness from the domain of matter-of-fact. The Eternal City is, after\r\nall, as vital a portion of the story as are the adventures of Miriam,\r\nHilda, Kenyon, and Donatello. They could not have existed and played\r\ntheir parts in any other city of the world.\r\n\r\nIn selecting local habitations for the creatures of his imagination, he\r\nstrolled into the Via Portoghese, and there found the \"Virgin's Shrine,\"\r\nwhich, with minor modifications, was to become the home of Hilda. I\r\nquote from his journal the description of the actual place as he saw\r\nit. \"The tower in the Via Portoghese,\" he says, \"has battlements\r\nand machicolations, and the upper half of it is covered with gray,\r\nancient-looking stucco. On the summit, at one corner, is the shrine of\r\nthe Virgin, rising quite above the battlements, and with its lamp before\r\nit. Beneath the machicolations is a window, probably belonging to the\r\nupper chamber; and there seems to be a level space on the top of the\r\ntower. Close at hand is the facade of a church, the highest pinnacle of\r\nwhich appears to be at about the same level as the battlements of\r\nthe tower, and there are two or more stone figures (either angels or\r\nallegorical) ornamenting the top of the facade, and, I think, blowing\r\ntrumpets. These personages are the nearest neighbors of any person\r\ninhabiting the upper story of the tower, and the sound of their angelic\r\ntrumpets must needs be very loud in that close vicinity: The lower story\r\nof the palace extends out and round the lower part of the tower, and\r\nis surrounded by a stone balustrade. The entrance from the street is\r\nthrough a long, arched doorway and passage, giving admittance into a\r\nsmall, enclosed court; and deep within the passage there is a very broad\r\nstaircase, which branches off, apparently, on one side, and leads to the\r\nheight of the tower. At the base of the tower, and along the front of\r\nthe palace, the street widens, so as to form something like a small\r\npiazza, in which there are two or three bakers' shops, one or two\r\nshoe-shops, a lottery-office, and, at one corner, the stand of a woman\r\nwho sells, I think, vegetables; a little further, a stand of oranges.\r\nNot so many doors from the palace entrance there is a station of French\r\nsoldiers and a sentinel on duty. The palace, judging from the broad\r\nstaircase, the balustraded platform, the tower itself, and other tokens,\r\nmay have been a grand one centuries ago; but the locality is now a\r\npoor one, and the edifice itself seems to have fallen to unaristocratic\r\noccupants. A man was cleaning a carriage in the enclosed court-yard,\r\nbut I rather conceive it was a cab for hire, and not the equipage of a\r\ndweller in the palace.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Lothrop Motley, the historian of the Netherlands, had come to Rome\r\nthis winter and brought his family with him. I believe my father had met\r\nMotley in America; at all events, we saw a good deal of him now. He\r\nwas an exceedingly handsome man, not only on account of the beauty\r\nof physical features which marked him, but in the sensitiveness and\r\nvividness of expression which constantly illuminated them. He was at\r\nthis time about five-and-forty years of age, and lacked a couple of\r\ninches of six feet in height. His hair, a dark, chestnut brown, had the\r\nhyacinthine wave through it, and was slightly streaked with gray;\r\nhis beard, which was full and rather short, was likewise wavy; he was\r\nquietly and harmoniously dressed, but the artistic temperament declared\r\nitself in a touch of color in his cravat. His voice was melodious and\r\nfinely modulated; his bearing gravely cheerful and very courteous. No\r\ntype of man finer than Motley's has existed in modern times; all the\r\nelements of the best and purest society were illustrated in him. He had\r\nthe depth of the scholar, the breadth and self-poise of the man of the\r\nworld, the genial warmth of the human fellow-creature, and, over all,\r\nthe harmonizing, individualizing charm of the artist. When New England\r\ngathers her resources to make a man she achieves a result hardly to be\r\nsurpassed.\r\n\r\nThe Storys were also in Rome during these last months of our stay, and\r\nMiss Mitchell, I think, still lingered in her little lodgings in the Via\r\nBocca di Leone. Miss Cushman likewise reappeared for a time, with all\r\nher former greatness and fascination, and many other friends, new and\r\nold, made that spring season memorable. As the moment for our departure\r\ndrew near, the magical allurement of Rome laid upon us a grasp more\r\nthan ever potent; it was impossible to realize that we were leaving it\r\nforever. On the last evening we walked in the moonlight to the fountain\r\nof Trevi, near our lodgings, and drank of the water--a ceremony which,\r\naccording to tradition, insures the return of the drinker. It was the\r\n25th of May, forty-four years ago. None of us has gone back since then,\r\nand, of the five who drank, three have passed to the country whence\r\nno traveller returns. For my own part, as a patriotic American nearly\r\nthirteen years old, I had no wish ever again to see Rome, and declared\r\nmyself glad to turn my back upon it, not that I had any fault to find\r\nwith it--I had always had a good time there--but my imagination was full\r\nof my native land, with which nothing else could be comparable. I did\r\nnot learn of the fabled spell of Trevi until afterwards; then I scoffed\r\nat and defied it, and possibly Rome may have decided that it could do\r\nwithout me.\r\n\r\nThe railway to Civita Vecchia had just been completed, and we passed\r\nswiftly over the route which had been so full of dangers and discomforts\r\neighteen months before. Embarking on the steamer for Marseilles, we kept\r\non thence to Avignon, where we spent about a week. This venerable\r\ntown had few attractions for me; I did not much care for the\r\nfourteenth-century popes, nor for the eighteenth-century silks, nor even\r\nfor Petrarch and Laura; and the architecture of the palace, after I had\r\ntried to sketch it, ceased to exhilarate me. My father was in no mood\r\nfor sight-seeing, either, but he went through it all conscientiously. My\r\nmother, of course, enjoyed herself, but she met with an accident. While\r\nsketching some figures of saints and monsters that adorned the arch of\r\nthe northern portal of the palace, she made an incautious movement and\r\nsprained her ankle. The pain was excessive for the moment, but it soon\r\npassed off, so as to enable her to limp back to our hotel. But the next\r\nday the pain was worse; my father had a headache, a rare affliction with\r\nhim; I had caught a bad cold from swimming in the arrowy Rhone, and Una\r\nand Miss Shepard were both in a state of exhaustion from sight-seeing;\r\nand in this condition the journey to Geneva had to be made. We had\r\nintended to remain there but a day, but we stayed longer, breathing the\r\npure air from the Alps, and feeling better as we breathed. I stood on\r\na bridge and looked down at that wonderful azure water rushing into the\r\nlovely lake; I looked up and beheld those glorious mountains soaring\r\ninto the sky, and I forgot Rome and Florence, and almost America, in my\r\njoy. Everything that life needs for life seemed present there.\r\n\r\nWe got into a little steamer and made the trip up the lake, the\r\nmountains all about us. Up to this time I had imagined that the\r\nacclivities in the north of England and in Scotland were mountains. We\r\nsat on deck, in the stern of the steamer, my father gazing out and up\r\nfrom beneath the rim of his soft felt hat, with his dark cloak over his\r\nshoulders. He looked revived and vigorous again. Shortly before we left\r\nRome he had ceased to shave his upper lip, for what reason I know not;\r\nI think it was simply indisposition to take that trouble any longer. My\r\nmother had at first gently protested; she did not want his upper lip and\r\nmouth to be hidden. But as the brown mustache, thick and soldier-like,\r\nappeared, she became reconciled, and he wore it to the end of his life.\r\n\"Field-Marshal Hawthorne\" James T. Fields used to call him after we got\r\nhome. Owing to the preponderance of expression of the upper part of his\r\nhead, the addition did not change his look as much as might have been\r\nexpected; we soon got used to it, and, inasmuch as all his photographs\r\nwere taken after the mustache was established, the world does not know\r\nhim otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe view became more and more enchanting as we penetrated farther into\r\nthe depths of the embrace of the mountains, and at last, at its most\r\nravishing point, the lake ceased, and the lonely little pile of dingy\r\nwhite masonry, which is Chillon, appeared. Few works of man have a\r\nmore romantic interest than this castle; but, seen from the lake, its\r\nenvironment was too much for it. Had it plunged downward into the smooth\r\nwaters and vanished, its absence would not have been marked in that\r\nstupendous landscape. But it improved greatly upon closer acquaintance;\r\nand when we stood in its vaults, and saw the pillar to which the\r\nprisoner was chained, and the hole in the floor, with its three steps of\r\nstone, and the fourth of death, we felt that Chillon was not unequal to\r\nits reputation.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Chillon and Geneva our faces were turned homeward, and we\r\nhastened our steps. My father wrote to England to engage our passage for\r\nthe first of August. We were now at midsummer. We returned to Paris, and\r\nafter a few days there proceeded to Havre, in order to see Ada Shepard\r\nsafe on board her steamer for home; her Wanderjahre was over, and\r\nshe was now to be married to Henry Clay Badger. We were sorry to say\r\ngood-bye to her; she had been a faithful and valuable element in our\r\nhousehold, and she had become a dear friend and comrade. She stood\r\nwaving her handkerchief to us as her steamer slipped away down the\r\nharbor. She, too, was sorry for the parting. She once had said to me: \"I\r\nthink your father is the wisest man I ever knew; he does not seem ever\r\nto say much, but what he does say is always the truest and best thing\r\nthat could be said.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Havre we crossed the Channel to Southampton, and were soon in\r\nLondon. Boston and Concord were only six weeks distant. Such, at any\r\nrate, had been the original design. But after we reached London\r\nthe subject of the English copyright of The Marble Faun came up for\r\ndiscussion. Henry Bright introduced Mr. Smith, of the firm of Smith,\r\nElder & Company, who made such proposals for the English publication\r\nof the book as were not to be disregarded; but, in order to make them\r\navailable, it was necessary that the manuscript should be completed in\r\nEngland. Nothing but the short sketch of it was as yet in existence; it\r\ncould not be written in much less than a year; either the English\r\noffer must be rejected, or we must stay out that year in her Majesty's\r\ndominions. My father decided, not altogether unwillingly, perhaps, to\r\nstay. He had written in his journal a few weeks before: \"Bennoch and\r\nHenry Bright are the only two men in England to whom I shall be much\r\ngrieved to say farewell; but to the island itself I cannot bear to say\r\nthat word as a finality. I shall dreamily hope to come back again at\r\nsome indefinite time, rather foolishly, perhaps, for it will tend to\r\ntake the substance out of my life in my own land. But this, I suspect,\r\nis apt to be the penalty of those who stay abroad and stay too long.\"\r\n\r\nBut my father could not write in London, and, casting about for a\r\nfitting spot, he finally fixed upon the remote hamlet of Redcar, far up\r\non the bleak coast of Redcar, in Yorkshire. It was not far from Whitby,\r\nwhere we had been two or three years before. The gray German Ocean\r\ntumbled in there upon the desolate sands, and the contrast of the scene\r\nwith those which we had been of late familiar with made the latter, no\r\ndoubt, start forward intensely in the romancer's imagination. So there\r\nhe wrote and wrote; and he walked far along the sands, with his boy\r\ndogging his steps and stopping for shells and crabs; and at a certain\r\npoint of the beach, where the waves ran over a bar and formed a lake a\r\nfew feet in depth, he would seat himself on a tussock of sand-grass,\r\nand I would undress and run into the cold water and continue my\r\nswimming-lessons, which had been begun in Stockbridge Bowl, continued in\r\nLake Leman, and were now brought to a satisfactory conclusion. Both my\r\nfeet were finally off the bottom, and I felt the wonderful sensation of\r\nthe first cousin to flying. While I floundered there my father looked\r\noff towards the gray horizon, and saw the visions of Hilda, Miriam,\r\nKenyon, and Donatello which the world of readers was presently to behold\r\nthrough his eyes. As we walked home in the twilight, the dull-red glow\r\nof the sunset would throw the outlines of the town into dark shadows,\r\nand shed a faint light on the surf roaming in from the east. I found,\r\nin my old album, the black silhouette of the scene which I made one day.\r\nThe arms of an old mill are flung appealingly upward, the highest object\r\nof the landscape, above the irregular sky-line of the clustering houses.\r\nThere is also, on the next page, a water-color drawing of a sailor in a\r\nblue jersey and a sou'wester, standing, with his hands in his pockets,\r\non the beach beside one of the boats of the region--a slender,\r\nclipper-built craft, painted yellow below and black above, good for oars\r\nor sail. Her bow rests on a shaft connecting two wheels, for convenience\r\nof running her down into the water. There was a dozen or more of these\r\nboats always ready on the beach in front of our lodgings. These lodgings\r\nwere just back of the esplanade, which, during our sojourn, was treated\r\nto a coat of tar from end to end--a delightful entertainment for us\r\nchildren--and I have loved the smell of tar ever since. There is little\r\nelse that I remember about Redcar, except that, in the winter, there\r\nwas skating on a part of the beach; but it was \"salt ice,\" and not to be\r\ncompared with the skating I was to enjoy a year or two later in Concord,\r\nwhich I shall describe if ever I come to that epoch in my narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Redcar, with the romance more than half done, we went south to our\r\nold Leamington, which seemed half like home; and there the loveliness of\r\nan English spring at its best came to greet us, and there the book was\r\nfinished, and sent to the printer. We spent a month or two at Bath, and\r\nfound it very pleasant; my father rested from his labors, except the\r\nproof-reading; and I was instructed in the use of the broadsword by an\r\nold Peninsular officer, Major Johnstone, who had fought at Waterloo,\r\nand had the bearing of such majors as Thackeray puts into Vanity Fair. I\r\nonce asked him whether he had ever killed a man; it was on the day when\r\nhe first allowed me to use a real broadsword in our lesson. \"Well,\"\r\nreplied the major, hesitatingly, \"I was riding in a charge, and there\r\ncame a fellow at me, with his sword up, and made a swing for my head. I\r\ndodged, and his blade just grazed me; but I let him have it, downright,\r\nat the same moment, and I caught him where the neck joins the shoulder,\r\nand he went down, and I went on, and what became of him I don't know; I\r\nhope nothing serious!\" The major sighed and looked serious himself. \"And\r\nwas this the sword?\" I demanded, balancing the heavy weapon in my hand.\r\n\"No--no--it wasn't that one,\" said the major, hastily. \"I've never used\r\nthe other since! Now, then, sir, if you please, on guard!\"\r\n\r\nWe went to London, and there were our old friends Bright and Bennoch,\r\nand the Motleys appeared from Italy, and a book called (by the\r\npublishers) Transformation came out in three volumes, being the latest\r\nromance by the author of The Scarlet Letter. The title was not bestowed\r\nwith my father's consent. He had, at the publishers' request, sent them\r\na list of several titles, beginning with The Marble Faun, and among\r\nothers on the list was \"The Faun's Transformation.\" The publishers took\r\nthe \"Transformation,\" and left out \"The Faun.\" My father laughed, but\r\nlet it go. The book was to come out under its proper title in America,\r\nand he was indifferent as to what they called it in England.\r\n\r\nThe end of our tarrying in the Old World was now at hand. Seven years\r\nhad we lived there, and we were eager and yet loath to go. My father's\r\nfriends gathered about him, men who had hardly so much as heard his name\r\na little while ago, but who now loved him as a brother. For a few days\r\nMrs. Blodgett's hospitable face glowed upon us once more, and pale Miss\r\nWilliams, and trig little Miss Maria, and many of the old captains\r\nwhom we had known. It was the middle of June, and the sun shone even in\r\nLiverpool. Our red-funnelled steamer lay at her moorings in the yellow\r\nMersey, with her steam up. It was not The Niagara, but on her bridge\r\nstood our handsome little Captain Leitch, with his black whiskers,\r\nsmiling at us in friendly greeting. How much had passed since we had\r\nseen him last! How much were we changed! What experiences lay behind us!\r\nWhat memories would abide with us always! My father leaned on the rail\r\nand looked across the river at the dingy, brick building, near the\r\nwharves, where he had spent four wearisome but pregnant years. The big,\r\nblack steamer, with her little, puffing tug, slipped her moorings, and\r\nslid slowly down the stream. After a few miles the hue of the water\r\nbecame less turbid, the engines worked more rapidly and regularly.\r\nLiverpool was now a smoky mass off our starboard quarter. It sank and\r\ndwindled, till the smoke alone was left; the blue channel spread around\r\nus; we were at sea, and home lay yonder, across three thousand miles\r\nof tumbling waves. But my father still leaned on the rail, and looked\r\nbackward towards the old home that he loved and would never see again.\r\nIt was the hour for good-bye; there would come another hour for the\r\nother home and for welcome.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Hawthorne and His Circle, by Julian Hawthorne",
