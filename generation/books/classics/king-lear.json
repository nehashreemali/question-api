A Room of State in King Lear’s Palace\r\n\r\n\r\n Enter Kent, Gloucester and Edmund.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nI thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nIt did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom,\r\nit appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for qualities are so\r\nweighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moiety.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nIs not this your son, my lord?\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nHis breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often\r\nblush’d to acknowledge him that now I am braz’d to’t.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nI cannot conceive you.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nSir, this young fellow’s mother could; whereupon she grew\r\nround-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she\r\nhad a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nI cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nBut I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than\r\nthis, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came\r\nsomething saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was\r\nhis mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the\r\nwhoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman,\r\nEdmund?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nNo, my lord.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nMy Lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nMy services to your lordship.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nI must love you, and sue to know you better.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nSir, I shall study deserving.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nHe hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. The King\r\nis coming.\r\n\r\n [_Sennet within._]\r\n\r\n Enter Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia and Attendants.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nAttend the lords of France and Burgundy,\r\nGloucester.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nI shall, my lord.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Gloucester and Edmund._]\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nMeantime we shall express our darker purpose.\r\nGive me the map there. Know that we have divided\r\nIn three our kingdom: and ’tis our fast intent\r\nTo shake all cares and business from our age;\r\nConferring them on younger strengths, while we\r\nUnburden’d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,\r\nAnd you, our no less loving son of Albany,\r\nWe have this hour a constant will to publish\r\nOur daughters’ several dowers, that future strife\r\nMay be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,\r\nGreat rivals in our youngest daughter’s love,\r\nLong in our court have made their amorous sojourn,\r\nAnd here are to be answer’d. Tell me, my daughters,—\r\nSince now we will divest us both of rule,\r\nInterest of territory, cares of state,—\r\nWhich of you shall we say doth love us most?\r\nThat we our largest bounty may extend\r\nWhere nature doth with merit challenge.—Goneril,\r\nOur eldest born, speak first.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nSir, I love you more than word can wield the matter;\r\nDearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;\r\nBeyond what can be valu’d, rich or rare;\r\nNo less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;\r\nAs much as child e’er lov’d, or father found;\r\nA love that makes breath poor and speech unable;\r\nBeyond all manner of so much I love you.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\n[_Aside._] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nOf all these bounds, even from this line to this,\r\nWith shadowy forests and with champains rich’d,\r\nWith plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,\r\nWe make thee lady: to thine and Albany’s issue\r\nBe this perpetual.—What says our second daughter,\r\nOur dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nSir, I am made of the self mettle as my sister,\r\nAnd prize me at her worth. In my true heart\r\nI find she names my very deed of love;\r\nOnly she comes too short, that I profess\r\nMyself an enemy to all other joys\r\nWhich the most precious square of sense possesses,\r\nAnd find I am alone felicitate\r\nIn your dear highness’ love.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\n[_Aside._] Then poor Cordelia,\r\nAnd yet not so; since, I am sure, my love’s\r\nMore ponderous than my tongue.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nTo thee and thine hereditary ever\r\nRemain this ample third of our fair kingdom;\r\nNo less in space, validity, and pleasure\r\nThan that conferr’d on Goneril.—Now, our joy,\r\nAlthough the last and least; to whose young love\r\nThe vines of France and milk of Burgundy\r\nStrive to be interess’d; what can you say to draw\r\nA third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nNothing, my lord.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nNothing?\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nNothing will come of nothing: speak again.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nUnhappy that I am, I cannot heave\r\nMy heart into my mouth: I love your majesty\r\nAccording to my bond; no more nor less.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nHow, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,\r\nLest you may mar your fortunes.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nGood my lord,\r\nYou have begot me, bred me, lov’d me: I\r\nReturn those duties back as are right fit,\r\nObey you, love you, and most honour you.\r\nWhy have my sisters husbands if they say\r\nThey love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,\r\nThat lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry\r\nHalf my love with him, half my care and duty:\r\nSure I shall never marry like my sisters,\r\nTo love my father all.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nBut goes thy heart with this?\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nAy, my good lord.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nSo young, and so untender?\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nSo young, my lord, and true.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nLet it be so, thy truth then be thy dower:\r\nFor, by the sacred radiance of the sun,\r\nThe mysteries of Hecate and the night;\r\nBy all the operation of the orbs,\r\nFrom whom we do exist and cease to be;\r\nHere I disclaim all my paternal care,\r\nPropinquity and property of blood,\r\nAnd as a stranger to my heart and me\r\nHold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,\r\nOr he that makes his generation messes\r\nTo gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom\r\nBe as well neighbour’d, pitied, and reliev’d,\r\nAs thou my sometime daughter.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nGood my liege,—\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nPeace, Kent!\r\nCome not between the dragon and his wrath.\r\nI lov’d her most, and thought to set my rest\r\nOn her kind nursery. [_To Cordelia._] Hence and avoid my sight!\r\nSo be my grave my peace, as here I give\r\nHer father’s heart from her! Call France. Who stirs?\r\nCall Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,\r\nWith my two daughters’ dowers digest this third:\r\nLet pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.\r\nI do invest you jointly with my power,\r\nPre-eminence, and all the large effects\r\nThat troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,\r\nWith reservation of an hundred knights,\r\nBy you to be sustain’d, shall our abode\r\nMake with you by due turn. Only we shall retain\r\nThe name, and all the addition to a king; the sway,\r\nRevenue, execution of the rest,\r\nBeloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,\r\nThis coronet part between you.\r\n [_Giving the crown._]\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nRoyal Lear,\r\nWhom I have ever honour’d as my king,\r\nLov’d as my father, as my master follow’d,\r\nAs my great patron thought on in my prayers.—\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nThe bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nLet it fall rather, though the fork invade\r\nThe region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly\r\nWhen Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?\r\nThink’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,\r\nWhen power to flattery bows? To plainness honour’s bound\r\nWhen majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy state;\r\nAnd in thy best consideration check\r\nThis hideous rashness: answer my life my judgement,\r\nThy youngest daughter does not love thee least;\r\nNor are those empty-hearted, whose low sounds\r\nReverb no hollowness.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nKent, on thy life, no more.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nMy life I never held but as a pawn\r\nTo wage against thine enemies; ne’er fear to lose it,\r\nThy safety being the motive.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nOut of my sight!\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nSee better, Lear; and let me still remain\r\nThe true blank of thine eye.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nNow, by Apollo,—\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nNow by Apollo, King,\r\nThou swear’st thy gods in vain.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nO vassal! Miscreant!\r\n\r\n [_Laying his hand on his sword._]\r\n\r\nALBANY and CORNWALL.\r\nDear sir, forbear!\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nKill thy physician, and the fee bestow\r\nUpon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,\r\nOr, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,\r\nI’ll tell thee thou dost evil.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nHear me, recreant! on thine allegiance, hear me!\r\nSince thou hast sought to make us break our vows,\r\nWhich we durst never yet, and with strain’d pride\r\nTo come betwixt our sentences and our power,\r\nWhich nor our nature, nor our place can bear,\r\nOur potency made good, take thy reward.\r\nFive days we do allot thee for provision,\r\nTo shield thee from disasters of the world;\r\nAnd on the sixth to turn thy hated back\r\nUpon our kingdom: if, on the next day following,\r\nThy banish’d trunk be found in our dominions,\r\nThe moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,\r\nThis shall not be revok’d.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nFare thee well, King: sith thus thou wilt appear,\r\nFreedom lives hence, and banishment is here.\r\n[_To Cordelia._] The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,\r\nThat justly think’st and hast most rightly said!\r\n[_To Goneril and Regan._] And your large speeches may your deeds\r\napprove,\r\nThat good effects may spring from words of love.\r\nThus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;\r\nHe’ll shape his old course in a country new.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n Flourish. Re-enter Gloucester, with France, Burgundy and Attendants.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nHere’s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nMy Lord of Burgundy,\r\nWe first address toward you, who with this king\r\nHath rivall’d for our daughter: what in the least\r\nWill you require in present dower with her,\r\nOr cease your quest of love?\r\n\r\nBURGUNDY.\r\nMost royal majesty,\r\nI crave no more than hath your highness offer’d,\r\nNor will you tender less.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nRight noble Burgundy,\r\nWhen she was dear to us, we did hold her so;\r\nBut now her price is fall’n. Sir, there she stands:\r\nIf aught within that little-seeming substance,\r\nOr all of it, with our displeasure piec’d,\r\nAnd nothing more, may fitly like your grace,\r\nShe’s there, and she is yours.\r\n\r\nBURGUNDY.\r\nI know no answer.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nWill you, with those infirmities she owes,\r\nUnfriended, new adopted to our hate,\r\nDower’d with our curse, and stranger’d with our oath,\r\nTake her or leave her?\r\n\r\nBURGUNDY.\r\nPardon me, royal sir;\r\nElection makes not up in such conditions.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nThen leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,\r\nI tell you all her wealth. [_To France_] For you, great king,\r\nI would not from your love make such a stray\r\nTo match you where I hate; therefore beseech you\r\nT’avert your liking a more worthier way\r\nThan on a wretch whom nature is asham’d\r\nAlmost t’acknowledge hers.\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\nThis is most strange,\r\nThat she, who even but now was your best object,\r\nThe argument of your praise, balm of your age,\r\nThe best, the dearest, should in this trice of time\r\nCommit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle\r\nSo many folds of favour. Sure her offence\r\nMust be of such unnatural degree\r\nThat monsters it, or your fore-vouch’d affection\r\nFall into taint; which to believe of her\r\nMust be a faith that reason without miracle\r\nShould never plant in me.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nI yet beseech your majesty,\r\nIf for I want that glib and oily art\r\nTo speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,\r\nI’ll do’t before I speak,—that you make known\r\nIt is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,\r\nNo unchaste action or dishonour’d step,\r\nThat hath depriv’d me of your grace and favour;\r\nBut even for want of that for which I am richer,\r\nA still soliciting eye, and such a tongue\r\nAs I am glad I have not, though not to have it\r\nHath lost me in your liking.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nBetter thou hadst\r\nNot been born than not to have pleas’d me better.\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\nIs it but this?—a tardiness in nature\r\nWhich often leaves the history unspoke\r\nThat it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,\r\nWhat say you to the lady? Love’s not love\r\nWhen it is mingled with regards that stands\r\nAloof from the entire point. Will you have her?\r\nShe is herself a dowry.\r\n\r\nBURGUNDY.\r\nRoyal King,\r\nGive but that portion which yourself propos’d,\r\nAnd here I take Cordelia by the hand,\r\nDuchess of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nNothing: I have sworn; I am firm.\r\n\r\nBURGUNDY.\r\nI am sorry, then, you have so lost a father\r\nThat you must lose a husband.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nPeace be with Burgundy!\r\nSince that respects of fortunes are his love,\r\nI shall not be his wife.\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\nFairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;\r\nMost choice forsaken; and most lov’d, despis’d!\r\nThee and thy virtues here I seize upon:\r\nBe it lawful, I take up what’s cast away.\r\nGods, gods! ’Tis strange that from their cold’st neglect\r\nMy love should kindle to inflam’d respect.\r\nThy dowerless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,\r\nIs queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:\r\nNot all the dukes of waterish Burgundy\r\nCan buy this unpriz’d precious maid of me.\r\nBid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:\r\nThou losest here, a better where to find.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nThou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we\r\nHave no such daughter, nor shall ever see\r\nThat face of hers again. Therefore be gone\r\nWithout our grace, our love, our benison.\r\nCome, noble Burgundy.\r\n\r\n [_Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, Cornwall, Albany, Gloucester and\r\n Attendants._]\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\nBid farewell to your sisters.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nThe jewels of our father, with wash’d eyes\r\nCordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;\r\nAnd like a sister am most loath to call\r\nYour faults as they are nam’d. Love well our father:\r\nTo your professed bosoms I commit him:\r\nBut yet, alas, stood I within his grace,\r\nI would prefer him to a better place.\r\nSo farewell to you both.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nPrescribe not us our duties.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nLet your study\r\nBe to content your lord, who hath receiv’d you\r\nAt fortune’s alms. You have obedience scanted,\r\nAnd well are worth the want that you have wanted.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nTime shall unfold what plighted cunning hides:\r\nWho covers faults, at last shame derides.\r\nWell may you prosper.\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\nCome, my fair Cordelia.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt France and Cordelia._]\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nSister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly\r\nappertains to us both. I think our father will hence tonight.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nThat’s most certain, and with you; next month with us.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nYou see how full of changes his age is; the observation we\r\nhave made of it hath not been little: he always loved our\r\nsister most; and with what poor judgement he hath now cast her\r\noff appears too grossly.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\n’Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever but slenderly\r\nknown himself.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nThe best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then must\r\nwe look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of\r\nlong-engrafted condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness\r\nthat infirm and choleric years bring with them.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nSuch unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent’s\r\nbanishment.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nThere is further compliment of leave-taking between France and\r\nhim. Pray you let us hit together: if our father carry authority\r\nwith such disposition as he bears, this last surrender of his\r\nwill but offend us.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nWe shall further think of it.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nWe must do something, and i’ th’ heat.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A Hall in the Earl of Gloucester’s Castle\r\n\r\n Enter Edmund with a\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nThou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law\r\nMy services are bound. Wherefore should I\r\nStand in the plague of custom, and permit\r\nThe curiosity of nations to deprive me?\r\nFor that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines\r\nLag of a brother? Why bastard? Wherefore base?\r\nWhen my dimensions are as well compact,\r\nMy mind as generous, and my shape as true\r\nAs honest madam’s issue? Why brand they us\r\nWith base? With baseness? bastardy? Base, base?\r\nWho, in the lusty stealth of nature, take\r\nMore composition and fierce quality\r\nThan doth within a dull stale tired bed\r\nGo to the creating a whole tribe of fops\r\nGot ’tween asleep and wake? Well then,\r\nLegitimate Edgar, I must have your land:\r\nOur father’s love is to the bastard Edmund\r\nAs to the legitimate: fine word: legitimate!\r\nWell, my legitimate, if this letter speed,\r\nAnd my invention thrive, Edmund the base\r\nShall top the legitimate. I grow, I prosper.\r\nNow, gods, stand up for bastards!\r\n\r\n Enter Gloucester.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nKent banish’d thus! and France in choler parted!\r\nAnd the King gone tonight! Prescrib’d his pow’r!\r\nConfin’d to exhibition! All this done\r\nUpon the gad!—Edmund, how now! What news?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nSo please your lordship, none.\r\n\r\n [_Putting up the letter._]\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nWhy so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI know no news, my lord.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nWhat paper were you reading?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nNothing, my lord.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nNo? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? The\r\nquality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. Let’s see. Come,\r\nif it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother that I\r\nhave not all o’er-read; and for so much as I have perus’d, I find it\r\nnot fit for your o’er-looking.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nGive me the letter, sir.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in\r\npart I understand them, are to blame.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nLet’s see, let’s see!\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI hope, for my brother’s justification, he wrote this but as an\r\nessay, or taste of my virtue.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\n[_Reads._] ‘This policy and reverence of age makes the world\r\nbitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us\r\ntill our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle\r\nand fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways\r\nnot as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that\r\nof this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I\r\nwaked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live\r\nthe beloved of your brother EDGAR.’\r\nHum! Conspiracy? ‘Sleep till I wake him, you should enjoy half\r\nhis revenue.’—My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? A heart\r\nand brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nIt was not brought me, my lord, there’s the cunning of it. I\r\nfound it thrown in at the casement of my closet.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nYou know the character to be your brother’s?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nIf the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but\r\nin respect of that, I would fain think it were not.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nIt is his.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nIt is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nHas he never before sounded you in this business?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nNever, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit\r\nthat, sons at perfect age, and fathers declined, the father\r\nshould be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nO villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred\r\nvillain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than\r\nbrutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; I’ll apprehend him. Abominable\r\nvillain, Where is he?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend\r\nyour indignation against my brother till you can derive from him\r\nbetter testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course;\r\nwhere, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his\r\npurpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour, and shake\r\nin pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life\r\nfor him, that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your\r\nhonour, and to no other pretence of danger.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nThink you so?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nIf your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us\r\nconfer of this, and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction,\r\nand that without any further delay than this very evening.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nHe cannot be such a monster.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nNor is not, sure.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nTo his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. Heaven\r\nand earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you:\r\nframe the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself\r\nto be in a due resolution.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall\r\nfind means, and acquaint you withal.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nThese late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us:\r\nthough the wisdom of Nature can reason it thus and thus, yet\r\nnature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools,\r\nfriendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in\r\ncountries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked\r\n’twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the\r\nprediction; there’s son against father: the King falls from\r\nbias of nature; there’s father against child. We have seen the\r\nbest of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all\r\nruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out\r\nthis villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it\r\ncarefully.—And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his\r\noffence, honesty! ’Tis strange.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nThis is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are\r\nsick in fortune, often the surfeits of our own behaviour, we\r\nmake guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as\r\nif we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;\r\nknaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance;\r\ndrunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of\r\nplanetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine\r\nthrusting on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his\r\ngoatish disposition to the charge of a star. My father compounded\r\nwith my mother under the dragon’s tail, and my nativity was under\r\nUrsa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut! I\r\nshould have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the\r\nfirmament twinkled on my bastardizing.\r\n\r\n Enter Edgar.\r\n\r\nPat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy: my cue\r\nis villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o’Bedlam.—O,\r\nthese eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHow now, brother Edmund, what serious contemplation are you in?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day,\r\nwhat should follow these eclipses.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nDo you busy yourself with that?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as of\r\nunnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth,\r\ndissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and\r\nmaledictions against King and nobles; needless diffidences,\r\nbanishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches,\r\nand I know not what.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHow long have you been a sectary astronomical?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nCome, come! when saw you my father last?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nThe night gone by.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nSpake you with him?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nAy, two hours together.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nParted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him, by word\r\nnor countenance?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nNone at all.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nBethink yourself wherein you may have offended him: and at my\r\nentreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath\r\nqualified the heat of his displeasure; which at this instant so\r\nrageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would\r\nscarcely allay.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nSome villain hath done me wrong.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nThat’s my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the\r\nspeed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me to\r\nmy lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord\r\nspeak: pray ye, go; there’s my key. If you do stir abroad, go\r\narmed.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nArmed, brother?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nBrother, I advise you to the best; I am no honest man\r\nif there be any good meaning toward you: I have told you what I\r\nhave seen and heard. But faintly; nothing like the image and\r\nhorror of it: pray you, away!\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nShall I hear from you anon?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI do serve you in this business.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Edgar._]\r\n\r\nA credulous father! and a brother noble,\r\nWhose nature is so far from doing harms\r\nThat he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty\r\nMy practices ride easy! I see the business.\r\nLet me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;\r\nAll with me’s meet that I can fashion fit.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

When he returns from hunting,\r\nI will not speak with him; say I am sick.\r\nIf you come slack of former services,\r\nYou shall do well; the fault of it I’ll answer.\r\n\r\n [_Horns within._]\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nHe’s coming, madam; I hear him.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nPut on what weary negligence you please,\r\nYou and your fellows; I’d have it come to question:\r\nIf he distaste it, let him to our sister,\r\nWhose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,\r\nNot to be overruled. Idle old man,\r\nThat still would manage those authorities\r\nThat he hath given away! Now, by my life,\r\nOld fools are babes again; and must be us’d\r\nWith checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus’d.\r\nRemember what I have said.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nVery well, madam.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nAnd let his knights have colder looks among you;\r\nWhat grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so;\r\nI would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,\r\nThat I may speak. I’ll write straight to my sister\r\nTo hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.

That which\r\nordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of\r\nme is diligence.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nHow old art thou?\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nNot so young, sir, to love a woman for singing; nor so old to\r\ndote on her for anything: I have years on my back forty-eight.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nFollow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after dinner, I\r\nwill not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho, dinner! Where’s my knave? my\r\nfool?

But where’s my fool? I\r\nhave not seen him this two days.\r\n\r\nKNIGHT.\r\nSince my young lady’s going into France, sir, the fool hath much\r\npined away.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nNo more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and tell my\r\ndaughter I would speak with her.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Attendant._]\r\n\r\nGo you, call hither my fool.\r\n\r\n [_Exit another Attendant._]\r\n\r\n Re-enter Oswald.\r\n\r\nO, you, sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I, sir?\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nMy lady’s father.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nMy lady’s father! my lord’s knave: you whoreson dog! you slave! you\r\ncur!\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nI am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nDo you bandy looks with me, you rascal?\r\n\r\n [_Striking him._]\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nI’ll not be struck, my lord.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nNor tripp’d neither, you base football player.\r\n\r\n [_Tripping up his heels._]\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nI thank thee, fellow. Thou serv’st me, and I’ll love thee.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nCome, sir, arise, away! I’ll teach you differences: away, away!

Nay, an thou\r\ncanst not smile as the wind sits, thou’lt catch cold shortly:\r\nthere, take my coxcomb: why, this fellow has banish’d two on’s\r\ndaughters, and did the third a blessing against his will; if\r\nthou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.

For you, Edmund,\r\nWhose virtue and obedience doth this instant\r\nSo much commend itself, you shall be ours:\r\nNatures of such deep trust we shall much need;\r\nYou we first seize on.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI shall serve you, sir, truly, however else.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nFor him I thank your grace.\r\n\r\nCORNWALL.\r\nYou know not why we came to visit you?\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nThus out of season, threading dark-ey’d night:\r\nOccasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,\r\nWherein we must have use of your advice.\r\nOur father he hath writ, so hath our sister,\r\nOf differences, which I best thought it fit\r\nTo answer from our home; the several messengers\r\nFrom hence attend dispatch.

No port is free, no place\r\nThat guard and most unusual vigilance\r\nDoes not attend my taking. While I may scape\r\nI will preserve myself: and am bethought\r\nTo take the basest and most poorest shape\r\nThat ever penury in contempt of man,\r\nBrought near to beast: my face I’ll grime with filth,\r\nBlanket my loins; elf all my hair in knots,\r\nAnd with presented nakedness outface\r\nThe winds and persecutions of the sky.\r\nThe country gives me proof and precedent\r\nOf Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,\r\nStrike in their numb’d and mortified bare arms\r\nPins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;\r\nAnd with this horrible object, from low farms,\r\nPoor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,\r\nSometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,\r\nEnforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom,\r\nThat’s something yet: Edgar I nothing am.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.

There is division between the Dukes,\r\nand a worse matter than that: I have received a letter this\r\nnight;—’tis dangerous to be spoken;—I have locked the letter\r\nin my closet: these injuries the King now bears will be revenged\r\nhome; there’s part of a power already footed: we must incline to\r\nthe King. I will look him, and privily relieve him: go you and\r\nmaintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him\r\nperceived: if he ask for me, I am ill, and gone to bed.

Let him first answer that.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nI am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nWherefore to Dover, sir?\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nBecause I would not see thy cruel nails\r\nPluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister\r\nIn his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.\r\nThe sea, with such a storm as his bare head\r\nIn hell-black night endur’d, would have buoy’d up,\r\nAnd quench’d the stelled fires;\r\nYet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.\r\nIf wolves had at thy gate howl’d that stern time,\r\nThou shouldst have said, ‘Good porter, turn the key.’\r\nAll cruels else subscrib’d: but I shall see\r\nThe winged vengeance overtake such children.\r\n\r\nCORNWALL.\r\nSee’t shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.\r\nUpon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot.\r\n\r\n [_Gloucester is held down in his chair, while Cornwall plucks out one\r\n of his eyes and sets his foot on it._]\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nHe that will think to live till he be old,\r\nGive me some help!—O cruel! O you gods!\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nOne side will mock another; the other too!\r\n\r\nCORNWALL.\r\nIf you see vengeance—\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT.\r\nHold your hand, my lord:\r\nI have serv’d you ever since I was a child;\r\nBut better service have I never done you\r\nThan now to bid you hold.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nHow now, you dog!\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT.\r\nIf you did wear a beard upon your chin,\r\nI’d shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?\r\n\r\nCORNWALL.\r\nMy villain?\r\n\r\n [_Draws, and runs at him._]\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT.\r\nNay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.\r\n\r\n [_Draws. They fight. Cornwall is wounded._]\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\n[_To another servant._] Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?\r\n\r\n [_Snatches a sword, comes behind, and stabs him._]\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT.\r\nO, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left\r\nTo see some mischief on him. O!\r\n\r\n [_Dies._]\r\n\r\nCORNWALL.\r\nLest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!\r\nWhere is thy lustre now?\r\n\r\n [_Tears out Gloucester’s other eye and throws it on the ground._]\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nAll dark and comfortless. Where’s my son Edmund?\r\nEdmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature\r\nTo quit this horrid act.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nOut, treacherous villain!\r\nThou call’st on him that hates thee: it was he\r\nThat made the overture of thy treasons to us;\r\nWho is too good to pity thee.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nO my follies! Then Edgar was abus’d.\r\nKind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nGo thrust him out at gates, and let him smell\r\nHis way to Dover. How is’t, my lord? How look you?\r\n\r\nCORNWALL.\r\nI have receiv’d a hurt: follow me, lady.\r\nTurn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave\r\nUpon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:\r\nUntimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Cornwall, led by Regan; Servants unbind Gloucester and lead\r\n him out._]\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT.\r\nI’ll never care what wickedness I do,\r\nIf this man come to good.\r\n\r\nTHIRD SERVANT.\r\nIf she live long,\r\nAnd in the end meet the old course of death,\r\nWomen will all turn monsters.\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT.\r\nLet’s follow the old Earl, and get the bedlam\r\nTo lead him where he would: his roguish madness\r\nAllows itself to anything.\r\n\r\nTHIRD SERVANT.\r\nGo thou: I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs\r\nTo apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT IV\r\n\r\nSCENE I. The heath\r\n\r\n\r\n Enter Edgar.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nYet better thus, and known to be contemn’d,\r\nThan still contemn’d and flatter’d. To be worst,\r\nThe lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,\r\nStands still in esperance, lives not in fear:\r\nThe lamentable change is from the best;\r\nThe worst returns to laughter. Welcome then,\r\nThou unsubstantial air that I embrace;\r\nThe wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst\r\nOwes nothing to thy blasts.\r\n\r\n Enter Gloucester, led by an\r\nOld Man.\r\n\r\nBut who comes here? My father, poorly led?\r\nWorld, world, O world!\r\nBut that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,\r\nLife would not yield to age.\r\n\r\nOLD MAN.\r\nO my good lord, I have been your tenant, and your father’s tenant\r\nthese fourscore years.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nAway, get thee away; good friend, be gone.\r\nThy comforts can do me no good at all;\r\nThee they may hurt.\r\n\r\nOLD MAN.\r\nYou cannot see your way.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nI have no way, and therefore want no eyes;\r\nI stumbled when I saw. Full oft ’tis seen\r\nOur means secure us, and our mere defects\r\nProve our commodities. O dear son Edgar,\r\nThe food of thy abused father’s wrath!\r\nMight I but live to see thee in my touch,\r\nI’d say I had eyes again!\r\n\r\nOLD MAN.\r\nHow now! Who’s there?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\n[_Aside._] O gods! Who is’t can say ‘I am at the\r\nworst’?\r\nI am worse than e’er I was.\r\n\r\nOLD MAN.\r\n’Tis poor mad Tom.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\n[_Aside._] And worse I may be yet. The worst is not\r\nSo long as we can say ‘This is the worst.’\r\n\r\nOLD MAN.\r\nFellow, where goest?\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nIs it a beggar-man?\r\n\r\nOLD MAN.\r\nMadman, and beggar too.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nHe has some reason, else he could not beg.\r\nI’ the last night’s storm I such a fellow saw;\r\nWhich made me think a man a worm. My son\r\nCame then into my mind, and yet my mind\r\nWas then scarce friends with him.\r\nI have heard more since.\r\nAs flies to wanton boys are we to the gods,\r\nThey kill us for their sport.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\n[_Aside._] How should this be?\r\nBad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,\r\nAngering itself and others. Bless thee, master!\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nIs that the naked fellow?\r\n\r\nOLD MAN.\r\nAy, my lord.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nThen prythee get thee away. If for my sake\r\nThou wilt o’ertake us hence a mile or twain,\r\nI’ the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love,\r\nAnd bring some covering for this naked soul,\r\nWhich I’ll entreat to lead me.\r\n\r\nOLD MAN.\r\nAlack, sir, he is mad.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\n’Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind.\r\nDo as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;\r\nAbove the rest, be gone.\r\n\r\nOLD MAN.\r\nI’ll bring him the best ’parel that I have,\r\nCome on’t what will.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nSirrah naked fellow.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nPoor Tom’s a-cold.\r\n[_Aside._] I cannot daub it further.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nCome hither, fellow.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\n[_Aside._] And yet I must. Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nKnow’st thou the way to Dover?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nBoth stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath been\r\nscared out of his good wits. Bless thee, good man’s son, from\r\nthe foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of\r\nlust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of darkness; Mahu, of\r\nstealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and\r\nmowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women. So,\r\nbless thee, master!\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nHere, take this purse, thou whom the heaven’s plagues\r\nHave humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched\r\nMakes thee the happier. Heavens deal so still!\r\nLet the superfluous and lust-dieted man,\r\nThat slaves your ordinance, that will not see\r\nBecause he does not feel, feel your power quickly;\r\nSo distribution should undo excess,\r\nAnd each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nAy, master.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nThere is a cliff, whose high and bending head\r\nLooks fearfully in the confined deep:\r\nBring me but to the very brim of it,\r\nAnd I’ll repair the misery thou dost bear\r\nWith something rich about me: from that place\r\nI shall no leading need.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nGive me thy arm:\r\nPoor Tom shall lead thee.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Before the Duke of Albany’s Palace\r\n\r\n Enter Goneril, Edmund;\r\nOswald meeting them.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nWelcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband\r\nNot met us on the way. Now, where’s your master?\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nMadam, within; but never man so chang’d.\r\nI told him of the army that was landed;\r\nHe smil’d at it: I told him you were coming;\r\nHis answer was, ‘The worse.’ Of Gloucester’s treachery\r\nAnd of the loyal service of his son\r\nWhen I inform’d him, then he call’d me sot,\r\nAnd told me I had turn’d the wrong side out.\r\nWhat most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;\r\nWhat like, offensive.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\n[_To Edmund._] Then shall you go no further.\r\nIt is the cowish terror of his spirit,\r\nThat dares not undertake. He’ll not feel wrongs\r\nWhich tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way\r\nMay prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;\r\nHasten his musters and conduct his powers.\r\nI must change names at home, and give the distaff\r\nInto my husband’s hands. This trusty servant\r\nShall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear,\r\nIf you dare venture in your own behalf,\r\nA mistress’s command. [_Giving a favour._]\r\nWear this; spare speech;\r\nDecline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,\r\nWould stretch thy spirits up into the air.\r\nConceive, and fare thee well.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nYours in the ranks of death.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Edmund._]\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nMy most dear Gloucester.\r\nO, the difference of man and man!\r\nTo thee a woman’s services are due;\r\nMy fool usurps my body.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nMadam, here comes my lord.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n Enter Albany.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nI have been worth the whistle.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nO Goneril!\r\nYou are not worth the dust which the rude wind\r\nBlows in your face! I fear your disposition;\r\nThat nature which contemns its origin\r\nCannot be bordered certain in itself.\r\nShe that herself will sliver and disbranch\r\nFrom her material sap, perforce must wither\r\nAnd come to deadly use.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nNo more; the text is foolish.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nWisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;\r\nFilths savour but themselves. What have you done?\r\nTigers, not daughters, what have you perform’d?\r\nA father, and a gracious aged man,\r\nWhose reverence even the head-lugg’d bear would lick,\r\nMost barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.\r\nCould my good brother suffer you to do it?\r\nA man, a prince, by him so benefitted!\r\nIf that the heavens do not their visible spirits\r\nSend quickly down to tame these vile offences,\r\nIt will come,\r\nHumanity must perforce prey on itself,\r\nLike monsters of the deep.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nMilk-liver’d man!\r\nThat bear’st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;\r\nWho hast not in thy brows an eye discerning\r\nThine honour from thy suffering; that not know’st\r\nFools do those villains pity who are punish’d\r\nEre they have done their mischief. Where’s thy drum?\r\nFrance spreads his banners in our noiseless land;\r\nWith plumed helm thy state begins to threat,\r\nWhilst thou, a moral fool, sitt’st still, and criest\r\n‘Alack, why does he so?’\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nSee thyself, devil!\r\nProper deformity seems not in the fiend\r\nSo horrid as in woman.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nO vain fool!\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nThou changed and self-cover’d thing, for shame!\r\nBe-monster not thy feature! Were’t my fitness\r\nTo let these hands obey my blood,\r\nThey are apt enough to dislocate and tear\r\nThy flesh and bones. Howe’er thou art a fiend,\r\nA woman’s shape doth shield thee.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nMarry, your manhood, mew!\r\n\r\n Enter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nWhat news?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nO, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall’s dead;\r\nSlain by his servant, going to put out\r\nThe other eye of Gloucester.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nGloucester’s eyes!\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nA servant that he bred, thrill’d with remorse,\r\nOppos’d against the act, bending his sword\r\nTo his great master; who, thereat enrag’d,\r\nFlew on him, and amongst them fell’d him dead;\r\nBut not without that harmful stroke which since\r\nHath pluck’d him after.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nThis shows you are above,\r\nYou justicers, that these our nether crimes\r\nSo speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!\r\nLost he his other eye?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nBoth, both, my lord.\r\nThis letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;\r\n’Tis from your sister.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\n[_Aside._] One way I like this well;\r\nBut being widow, and my Gloucester with her,\r\nMay all the building in my fancy pluck\r\nUpon my hateful life. Another way\r\nThe news is not so tart. I’ll read, and answer.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nWhere was his son when they did take his eyes?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nCome with my lady hither.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nHe is not here.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nNo, my good lord; I met him back again.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nKnows he the wickedness?\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nAy, my good lord. ’Twas he inform’d against him;\r\nAnd quit the house on purpose, that their punishment\r\nMight have the freer course.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nGloucester, I live\r\nTo thank thee for the love thou show’dst the King,\r\nAnd to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend,\r\nTell me what more thou know’st.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The French camp near Dover\r\n\r\n Enter Kent and a Gentleman.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nWhy the King of France is so suddenly gone back, know you no\r\nreason?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nSomething he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming\r\nforth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much fear\r\nand danger that his personal return was most required and\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nWho hath he left behind him general?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nThe Mareschal of France, Monsieur La Far.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nDid your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nAy, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;\r\nAnd now and then an ample tear trill’d down\r\nHer delicate cheek. It seem’d she was a queen\r\nOver her passion; who, most rebel-like,\r\nSought to be king o’er her.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nO, then it mov’d her.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nNot to a rage: patience and sorrow strove\r\nWho should express her goodliest. You have seen\r\nSunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears\r\nWere like a better day. Those happy smilets\r\nThat play’d on her ripe lip seem’d not to know\r\nWhat guests were in her eyes; which parted thence\r\nAs pearls from diamonds dropp’d. In brief,\r\nSorrow would be a rarity most belov’d,\r\nIf all could so become it.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nMade she no verbal question?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nFaith, once or twice she heav’d the name of ‘father’\r\nPantingly forth, as if it press’d her heart;\r\nCried ‘Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!\r\nKent! father! sisters! What, i’ the storm? i’ the night?\r\nLet pity not be believ’d!’ There she shook\r\nThe holy water from her heavenly eyes,\r\nAnd clamour master’d her: then away she started\r\nTo deal with grief alone.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nIt is the stars,\r\nThe stars above us govern our conditions;\r\nElse one self mate and make could not beget\r\nSuch different issues. You spoke not with her since?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nWas this before the King return’d?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nNo, since.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nWell, sir, the poor distressed Lear’s i’ the town;\r\nWho sometime, in his better tune, remembers\r\nWhat we are come about, and by no means\r\nWill yield to see his daughter.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nWhy, good sir?\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nA sovereign shame so elbows him. His own unkindness,\r\nThat stripp’d her from his benediction, turn’d her\r\nTo foreign casualties, gave her dear rights\r\nTo his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting\r\nHis mind so venomously that burning shame\r\nDetains him from Cordelia.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nAlack, poor gentleman!\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nOf Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\n’Tis so; they are afoot.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nWell, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear\r\nAnd leave you to attend him. Some dear cause\r\nWill in concealment wrap me up awhile;\r\nWhen I am known aright, you shall not grieve\r\nLending me this acquaintance.\r\nI pray you, go along with me.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.

A century send forth;\r\nSearch every acre in the high-grown field,\r\nAnd bring him to our eye.\r\n\r\n [_Exit an Officer._]\r\n\r\nWhat can man’s wisdom\r\nIn the restoring his bereaved sense,\r\nHe that helps him take all my outward worth.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.\r\nThere is means, madam:\r\nOur foster nurse of nature is repose,\r\nThe which he lacks; that to provoke in him\r\nAre many simples operative, whose power\r\nWill close the eye of anguish.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nAll bless’d secrets,\r\nAll you unpublish’d virtues of the earth,\r\nSpring with my tears! Be aidant and remediate\r\nIn the good man’s distress! Seek, seek for him;\r\nLest his ungovern’d rage dissolve the life\r\nThat wants the means to lead it.\r\n\r\n Enter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nNews, madam;\r\nThe British powers are marching hitherward.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\n’Tis known before. Our preparation stands\r\nIn expectation of them. O dear father,\r\nIt is thy business that I go about;\r\nTherefore great France\r\nMy mourning and important tears hath pitied.\r\nNo blown ambition doth our arms incite,\r\nBut love, dear love, and our ag’d father’s right:\r\nSoon may I hear and see him!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V.

Where he arrives he moves\r\nAll hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone\r\nIn pity of his misery, to dispatch\r\nHis nighted life; moreover to descry\r\nThe strength o’ th’enemy.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nI must needs after him, madam, with my letter.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nOur troops set forth tomorrow; stay with us;\r\nThe ways are dangerous.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nI may not, madam:\r\nMy lady charg’d my duty in this business.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nWhy should she write to Edmund? Might not you\r\nTransport her purposes by word? Belike,\r\nSomethings, I know not what, I’ll love thee much.\r\nLet me unseal the letter.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nMadam, I had rather—\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nI know your lady does not love her husband;\r\nI am sure of that; and at her late being here\r\nShe gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks\r\nTo noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nI, madam?\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nI speak in understanding; y’are, I know’t:\r\nTherefore I do advise you take this note:\r\nMy lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk’d,\r\nAnd more convenient is he for my hand\r\nThan for your lady’s. You may gather more.\r\nIf you do find him, pray you give him this;\r\nAnd when your mistress hears thus much from you,\r\nI pray desire her call her wisdom to her.\r\nSo, fare you well.\r\nIf you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,\r\nPreferment falls on him that cuts him off.\r\n\r\nOSWALD.\r\nWould I could meet him, madam! I should show\r\nWhat party I do follow.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nFare thee well.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VI. The country near Dover\r\n\r\n Enter Gloucester, and Edgar  dressed like a peasant.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nWhen shall I come to the top of that same hill?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nYou do climb up it now. Look how we labour.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nMethinks the ground is even.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHorrible steep.\r\nHark, do you hear the sea?\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nNo, truly.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nWhy, then, your other senses grow imperfect\r\nBy your eyes’ anguish.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nSo may it be indeed.\r\nMethinks thy voice is alter’d; and thou speak’st\r\nIn better phrase and matter than thou didst.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nY’are much deceiv’d: in nothing am I chang’d\r\nBut in my garments.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nMethinks you’re better spoken.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nCome on, sir; here’s the place. Stand still. How fearful\r\nAnd dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low!\r\nThe crows and choughs that wing the midway air\r\nShow scarce so gross as beetles. Half way down\r\nHangs one that gathers samphire—dreadful trade!\r\nMethinks he seems no bigger than his head.\r\nThe fishermen that walk upon the beach\r\nAppear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,\r\nDiminish’d to her cock; her cock a buoy\r\nAlmost too small for sight: the murmuring surge\r\nThat on th’unnumber’d idle pebble chafes\r\nCannot be heard so high.

Hear you, sir? speak!\r\nThus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.\r\nWhat are you, sir?\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nAway, and let me die.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,\r\nSo many fathom down precipitating,\r\nThou’dst shiver’d like an egg: but thou dost breathe;\r\nHast heavy substance; bleed’st not; speak’st; art sound.\r\nTen masts at each make not the altitude\r\nWhich thou hast perpendicularly fell.\r\nThy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nBut have I fall’n, or no?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nFrom the dread summit of this chalky bourn.\r\nLook up a-height, the shrill-gorg’d lark so far\r\nCannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nAlack, I have no eyes.\r\nIs wretchedness depriv’d that benefit\r\nTo end itself by death? ’Twas yet some comfort\r\nWhen misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage\r\nAnd frustrate his proud will.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nGive me your arm.\r\nUp, so. How is’t? Feel you your legs? You stand.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nToo well, too well.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nThis is above all strangeness.\r\nUpon the crown o’ the cliff what thing was that\r\nWhich parted from you?\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nA poor unfortunate beggar.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nAs I stood here below, methought his eyes\r\nWere two full moons; he had a thousand noses,\r\nHorns whelk’d and waved like the enraged sea.\r\nIt was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,\r\nThink that the clearest gods, who make them honours\r\nOf men’s impossibilities, have preserv’d thee.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nI do remember now: henceforth I’ll bear\r\nAffliction till it do cry out itself\r\n‘Enough, enough,’ and die. That thing you speak of,\r\nI took it for a man; often ’twould say,\r\n‘The fiend, the fiend’; he led me to that place.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nBear free and patient thoughts.

I am the King himself.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nO thou side-piercing sight!\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nNature’s above art in that respect. There’s your press money.\r\nThat fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw me a clothier’s\r\nyard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace, this piece of toasted cheese\r\nwill do’t. There’s my gauntlet; I’ll prove it on a giant.\r\nBring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! i’ the clout, i’\r\nthe clout. Hewgh!

They flattered me like a dog; and told\r\nme I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say\r\n‘ay’ and ‘no’ to everything I said ‘ay’\r\nand ‘no’ to was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet\r\nme once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not\r\npeace at my bidding; there I found ’em, there I smelt ’em out.\r\nGo to, they are not men o’ their words: they told me I was everything;\r\n’tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nThe trick of that voice I do well remember:\r\nIs’t not the King?\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nAy, every inch a king.\r\nWhen I do stare, see how the subject quakes.\r\nI pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause?\r\nAdultery? Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:\r\nThe wren goes to’t, and the small gilded fly\r\nDoes lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive;\r\nFor Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to his father\r\nThan my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets.\r\nTo’t, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.\r\nBehold yond simp’ring dame,\r\nWhose face between her forks presages snow;\r\nThat minces virtue, and does shake the head\r\nTo hear of pleasure’s name.\r\nThe fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to’t with a more riotous\r\nappetite. Down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all\r\nabove. But to the girdle do the gods inherit, beneath is all the\r\nfiend’s; there’s hell, there’s darkness, there is the sulphurous pit;\r\nburning, scalding, stench,\r\nconsumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good\r\napothecary, to sweeten my imagination. There’s money for thee.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nO, let me kiss that hand!\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nLet me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nO ruin’d piece of nature, this great world\r\nShall so wear out to naught.

No eyes in your head, nor no money\r\nin your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a\r\nlight, yet you see how this world goes.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nI see it feelingly.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nWhat, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes.\r\nLook with thine ears. See how yon justice rails upon yon simple\r\nthief. Hark, in thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which\r\nis the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer’s\r\ndog bark at a beggar?\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nAy, sir.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nAnd the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold\r\nthe great image of authority: a dog’s obeyed in office.\r\nThou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!\r\nWhy dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;\r\nThou hotly lusts to use her in that kind\r\nFor which thou whipp’st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.\r\nThrough tatter’d clothes great vices do appear;\r\nRobes and furr’d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,\r\nAnd the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;\r\nArm it in rags, a pygmy’s straw does pierce it.\r\nNone does offend, none, I say none; I’ll able ’em;\r\nTake that of me, my friend, who have the power\r\nTo seal the accuser’s lips. Get thee glass eyes,\r\nAnd like a scurvy politician, seem\r\nTo see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:\r\nPull off my boots: harder, harder, so.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nO, matter and impertinency mix’d!\r\nReason in madness!\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nIf thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.\r\nI know thee well enough, thy name is Gloucester.\r\nThou must be patient; we came crying hither:\r\nThou know’st the first time that we smell the air\r\nWe wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nAlack, alack the day!\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nWhen we are born, we cry that we are come\r\nTo this great stage of fools. This a good block:\r\nIt were a delicate stratagem to shoe\r\nA troop of horse with felt. I’ll put’t in proof\r\nAnd when I have stol’n upon these son-in-laws,\r\nThen kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!\r\n\r\n Enter a Gentleman with\r\nAttendants.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nO, here he is: lay hand upon him.

Let me have surgeons;\r\nI am cut to the brains.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nYou shall have anything.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nNo seconds? All myself?\r\nWhy, this would make a man a man of salt,\r\nTo use his eyes for garden water-pots,\r\nAy, and for laying autumn’s dust.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nGood sir.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nI will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom.\r\nWhat! I will be jovial. Come, come,\r\nI am a king, my masters, know you that.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nYou are a royal one, and we obey you.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nThen there’s life in’t.

I will o’erlook thy paper.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Edgar._]\r\n\r\n Enter Edmund.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nThe enemy’s in view; draw up your powers.\r\nHere is the guess of their true strength and forces\r\nBy diligent discovery; but your haste\r\nIs now urg’d on you.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nWe will greet the time.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nTo both these sisters have I sworn my love;\r\nEach jealous of the other, as the stung\r\nAre of the adder. Which of them shall I take?\r\nBoth? One? Or neither? Neither can be enjoy’d,\r\nIf both remain alive. To take the widow\r\nExasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;\r\nAnd hardly shall I carry out my side,\r\nHer husband being alive. Now, then, we’ll use\r\nHis countenance for the battle; which being done,\r\nLet her who would be rid of him devise\r\nHis speedy taking off. As for the mercy\r\nWhich he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,\r\nThe battle done, and they within our power,\r\nShall never see his pardon: for my state\r\nStands on me to defend, not to debate.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A field between the two Camps\r\n\r\n Alarum within. Enter with drum and colours, Lear, Cordelia and their\r\n Forces, and exeunt.\r\n\r\n Enter Edgar and Gloucester.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHere, father, take the shadow of this tree\r\nFor your good host; pray that the right may thrive:\r\nIf ever I return to you again,\r\nI’ll bring you comfort.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nGrace go with you, sir!\r\n\r\n [_Exit Edgar._]\r\n\r\n Alarum and retreat within. Enter Edgar.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nAway, old man, give me thy hand, away!\r\nKing Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta’en:\r\nGive me thy hand; come on!\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nNo further, sir; a man may rot even here.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nWhat, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure\r\nTheir going hence, even as their coming hither;\r\nRipeness is all. Come on.\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\nAnd that’s true too.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The British Camp near Dover\r\n\r\n Enter in conquest with drum and colours, Edmund, Lear and Cordelia\r\nas prisoners; Officers, Soldiers, &c.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nSome officers take them away: good guard\r\nUntil their greater pleasures first be known\r\nThat are to censure them.\r\n\r\nCORDELIA.\r\nWe are not the first\r\nWho with best meaning have incurr’d the worst.\r\nFor thee, oppressed King, I am cast down;\r\nMyself could else out-frown false fortune’s frown.\r\nShall we not see these daughters and these sisters?\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nNo, no, no, no. Come, let’s away to prison:\r\nWe two alone will sing like birds i’ the cage:\r\nWhen thou dost ask me blessing I’ll kneel down\r\nAnd ask of thee forgiveness. So we’ll live,\r\nAnd pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh\r\nAt gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues\r\nTalk of court news; and we’ll talk with them too,\r\nWho loses and who wins; who’s in, who’s out;\r\nAnd take upon’s the mystery of things,\r\nAs if we were God’s spies. And we’ll wear out,\r\nIn a wall’d prison, packs and sects of great ones\r\nThat ebb and flow by the moon.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nTake them away.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nUpon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,\r\nThe gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?\r\nHe that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,\r\nAnd fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;\r\nThe good years shall devour them, flesh and fell,\r\nEre they shall make us weep!\r\nWe’ll see ’em starve first: come.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Lear and Cordelia, guarded._]\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nCome hither, captain, hark.\r\nTake thou this note [_giving a paper_]; go follow them to prison.\r\nOne step I have advanc’d thee; if thou dost\r\nAs this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way\r\nTo noble fortunes: know thou this, that men\r\nAre as the time is; to be tender-minded\r\nDoes not become a sword. Thy great employment\r\nWill not bear question; either say thou’lt do’t,\r\nOr thrive by other means.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nI’ll do’t, my lord.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nAbout it; and write happy when thou hast done.\r\nMark, I say, instantly; and carry it so\r\nAs I have set it down.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nI cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;\r\nIf it be man’s work, I’ll do’t.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril,\r\nRegan, Officers and Attendants.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nSir, you have show’d today your valiant strain,\r\nAnd fortune led you well: you have the captives\r\nWho were the opposites of this day’s strife:\r\nI do require them of you, so to use them\r\nAs we shall find their merits and our safety\r\nMay equally determine.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nSir, I thought it fit\r\nTo send the old and miserable King\r\nTo some retention and appointed guard;\r\nWhose age has charms in it, whose title more,\r\nTo pluck the common bosom on his side,\r\nAnd turn our impress’d lances in our eyes\r\nWhich do command them. With him I sent the queen;\r\nMy reason all the same; and they are ready\r\nTomorrow, or at further space, to appear\r\nWhere you shall hold your session. At this time\r\nWe sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;\r\nAnd the best quarrels in the heat are curs’d\r\nBy those that feel their sharpness.\r\nThe question of Cordelia and her father\r\nRequires a fitter place.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nSir, by your patience,\r\nI hold you but a subject of this war,\r\nNot as a brother.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nThat’s as we list to grace him.\r\nMethinks our pleasure might have been demanded\r\nEre you had spoke so far. He led our powers;\r\nBore the commission of my place and person;\r\nThe which immediacy may well stand up\r\nAnd call itself your brother.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nNot so hot:\r\nIn his own grace he doth exalt himself,\r\nMore than in your addition.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nIn my rights,\r\nBy me invested, he compeers the best.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nThat were the most, if he should husband you.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nJesters do oft prove prophets.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nHolla, holla!\r\nThat eye that told you so look’d but asquint.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nLady, I am not well; else I should answer\r\nFrom a full-flowing stomach. General,\r\nTake thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;\r\nDispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:\r\nWitness the world that I create thee here\r\nMy lord and master.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nMean you to enjoy him?\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nThe let-alone lies not in your good will.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nNor in thine, lord.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nHalf-blooded fellow, yes.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\n[_To Edmund._] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nStay yet; hear reason: Edmund, I arrest thee\r\nOn capital treason; and, in thine arrest,\r\nThis gilded serpent. [_pointing to Goneril._]\r\nFor your claim, fair sister,\r\nI bar it in the interest of my wife;\r\n’Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,\r\nAnd I her husband contradict your bans.\r\nIf you will marry, make your loves to me,\r\nMy lady is bespoke.\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nAn interlude!\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nThou art arm’d, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound:\r\nIf none appear to prove upon thy person\r\nThy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,\r\nThere is my pledge. [_Throwing down a glove._]\r\nI’ll make it on thy heart,\r\nEre I taste bread, thou art in nothing less\r\nThan I have here proclaim’d thee.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nSick, O, sick!\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\n[_Aside._] If not, I’ll ne’er trust medicine.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nThere’s my exchange. [_Throwing down a glove._]\r\nWhat in the world he is\r\nThat names me traitor, villain-like he lies.\r\nCall by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,\r\nOn him, on you, who not? I will maintain\r\nMy truth and honour firmly.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nA herald, ho!\r\n\r\n Enter a Herald.\r\n\r\nTrust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,\r\nAll levied in my name, have in my name\r\nTook their discharge.\r\n\r\nREGAN.\r\nMy sickness grows upon me.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nShe is not well. Convey her to my tent.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Regan, led._]\r\n\r\nCome hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound\r\nAnd read out this.\r\n\r\nOFFICER.\r\nSound, trumpet!\r\n\r\n [_A trumpet sounds._]\r\n\r\nHERALD.\r\n[_Reads._] ‘If any man of quality or degree within the lists of\r\nthe army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester,\r\nthat he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third sound\r\nof the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.’\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nSound!\r\n\r\n [_First trumpet._]\r\n\r\nHERALD.\r\nAgain!\r\n\r\n [_Second trumpet._]\r\n\r\nHERALD.\r\nAgain!\r\n\r\n Third trumpet. Trumpet answers within. Enter Edgar, armed, preceded by\r\n a trumpet.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nAsk him his purposes, why he appears\r\nUpon this call o’ the trumpet.\r\n\r\nHERALD.\r\nWhat are you?\r\nYour name, your quality? and why you answer\r\nThis present summons?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nKnow my name is lost;\r\nBy treason’s tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.\r\nYet am I noble as the adversary\r\nI come to cope.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nWhich is that adversary?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nWhat’s he that speaks for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nHimself, what say’st thou to him?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nDraw thy sword,\r\nThat if my speech offend a noble heart,\r\nThy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.\r\nBehold, it is the privilege of mine honours,\r\nMy oath, and my profession: I protest,\r\nMaugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,\r\nDespite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,\r\nThy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;\r\nFalse to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;\r\nConspirant ’gainst this high illustrious prince;\r\nAnd, from the extremest upward of thy head\r\nTo the descent and dust beneath thy foot,\r\nA most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou ‘No,’\r\nThis sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent\r\nTo prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,\r\nThou liest.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nIn wisdom I should ask thy name;\r\nBut since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,\r\nAnd that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,\r\nWhat safe and nicely I might well delay\r\nBy rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.\r\nBack do I toss those treasons to thy head,\r\nWith the hell-hated lie o’erwhelm thy heart;\r\nWhich for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,\r\nThis sword of mine shall give them instant way,\r\nWhere they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!\r\n\r\n [_Alarums. They fight. Edmund falls._]\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nSave him, save him!\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nThis is mere practice, Gloucester:\r\nBy the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer\r\nAn unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish’d,\r\nBut cozen’d and beguil’d.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nShut your mouth, dame,\r\nOr with this paper shall I stop it. Hold, sir;\r\nThou worse than any name, read thine own evil.\r\nNo tearing, lady; I perceive you know it.\r\n\r\n [_Gives the letter to Edmund._]\r\n\r\nGONERIL.\r\nSay if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:\r\nWho can arraign me for’t?\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nMost monstrous! O!\r\nKnow’st thou this paper?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nAsk me not what I know.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\n[_To an Officer, who goes out._] Go after her; she’s desperate;\r\ngovern her.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nWhat you have charg’d me with, that have I done;\r\nAnd more, much more; the time will bring it out.\r\n’Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou\r\nThat hast this fortune on me? If thou’rt noble,\r\nI do forgive thee.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nLet’s exchange charity.\r\nI am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;\r\nIf more, the more thou hast wrong’d me.\r\nMy name is Edgar and thy father’s son.\r\nThe gods are just, and of our pleasant vices\r\nMake instruments to plague us:\r\nThe dark and vicious place where thee he got\r\nCost him his eyes.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nThou hast spoken right, ’tis true;\r\nThe wheel is come full circle; I am here.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nMethought thy very gait did prophesy\r\nA royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.\r\nLet sorrow split my heart if ever I\r\nDid hate thee or thy father.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nWorthy prince, I know’t.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nWhere have you hid yourself?\r\nHow have you known the miseries of your father?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nBy nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;\r\nAnd when ’tis told, O that my heart would burst!\r\nThe bloody proclamation to escape\r\nThat follow’d me so near,—O, our lives’ sweetness!\r\nThat with the pain of death we’d hourly die\r\nRather than die at once!—taught me to shift\r\nInto a madman’s rags; t’assume a semblance\r\nThat very dogs disdain’d; and in this habit\r\nMet I my father with his bleeding rings,\r\nTheir precious stones new lost; became his guide,\r\nLed him, begg’d for him, sav’d him from despair;\r\nNever,—O fault!—reveal’d myself unto him\r\nUntil some half hour past, when I was arm’d;\r\nNot sure, though hoping of this good success,\r\nI ask’d his blessing, and from first to last\r\nTold him my pilgrimage. But his flaw’d heart,\r\nAlack, too weak the conflict to support!\r\n’Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,\r\nBurst smilingly.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nThis speech of yours hath mov’d me,\r\nAnd shall perchance do good, but speak you on;\r\nYou look as you had something more to say.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nIf there be more, more woeful, hold it in;\r\nFor I am almost ready to dissolve,\r\nHearing of this.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nThis would have seem’d a period\r\nTo such as love not sorrow; but another,\r\nTo amplify too much, would make much more,\r\nAnd top extremity.\r\nWhilst I was big in clamour, came there a man\r\nWho, having seen me in my worst estate,\r\nShunn’d my abhorr’d society; but then finding\r\nWho ’twas that so endur’d, with his strong arms\r\nHe fastened on my neck, and bellow’d out\r\nAs he’d burst heaven; threw him on my father;\r\nTold the most piteous tale of Lear and him\r\nThat ever ear receiv’d, which in recounting\r\nHis grief grew puissant, and the strings of life\r\nBegan to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,\r\nAnd there I left him tranc’d.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nBut who was this?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nKent, sir, the banish’d Kent; who in disguise\r\nFollow’d his enemy king and did him service\r\nImproper for a slave.\r\n\r\n Enter a Gentleman hastily,\r\nwith a bloody knife.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nHelp, help! O, help!\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nWhat kind of help?\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nSpeak, man.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nWhat means this bloody knife?\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\n’Tis hot, it smokes;\r\nIt came even from the heart of—O! she’s dead!\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nWho dead? Speak, man.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN.\r\nYour lady, sir, your lady; and her sister\r\nBy her is poisoned; she hath confesses it.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI was contracted to them both, all three\r\nNow marry in an instant.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHere comes Kent.\r\n\r\n Enter Kent.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nProduce their bodies, be they alive or dead.\r\nThis judgement of the heavens that makes us tremble\r\nTouches us not with pity. O, is this he?\r\nThe time will not allow the compliment\r\nWhich very manners urges.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nI am come\r\nTo bid my King and master aye good night:\r\nIs he not here?\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nGreat thing of us forgot!\r\nSpeak, Edmund, where’s the King? and where’s Cordelia?\r\n\r\n The bodies of Goneril and\r\nRegan are brought in.\r\n\r\nSeest thou this object, Kent?\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nAlack, why thus?\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nYet Edmund was belov’d.\r\nThe one the other poisoned for my sake,\r\nAnd after slew herself.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nEven so. Cover their faces.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nI pant for life. Some good I mean to do,\r\nDespite of mine own nature. Quickly send,\r\nBe brief in it, to the castle; for my writ\r\nIs on the life of Lear and on Cordelia;\r\nNay, send in time.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nRun, run, O, run!\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nTo who, my lord? Who has the office? Send\r\nThy token of reprieve.\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nWell thought on: take my sword,\r\nGive it the captain.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHaste thee for thy life.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Edgar._]\r\n\r\nEDMUND.\r\nHe hath commission from thy wife and me\r\nTo hang Cordelia in the prison, and\r\nTo lay the blame upon her own despair,\r\nThat she fordid herself.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nThe gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.\r\n\r\n [_Edmund is borne off._]\r\n\r\n Enter Lear with Cordelia dead in his arms; Edgar,\r\nOfficer and others following.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nHowl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.\r\nHad I your tongues and eyes, I’ld use them so\r\nThat heaven’s vault should crack. She’s gone for ever!\r\nI know when one is dead, and when one lives;\r\nShe’s dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass;\r\nIf that her breath will mist or stain the stone,\r\nWhy, then she lives.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nIs this the promis’d end?\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nOr image of that horror?\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nFall, and cease!\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nThis feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,\r\nIt is a chance which does redeem all sorrows\r\nThat ever I have felt.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nO, my good master! [_Kneeling._]\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nPrythee, away!\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\n’Tis noble Kent, your friend.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nA plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!\r\nI might have sav’d her; now she’s gone for ever!\r\nCordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!\r\nWhat is’t thou say’st? Her voice was ever soft,\r\nGentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.\r\nI kill’d the slave that was a-hanging thee.\r\n\r\nOFFICER.\r\n’Tis true, my lords, he did.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nDid I not, fellow?\r\nI have seen the day, with my good biting falchion\r\nI would have made them skip. I am old now,\r\nAnd these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?\r\nMine eyes are not o’ the best, I’ll tell you straight.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nIf Fortune brag of two she lov’d and hated,\r\nOne of them we behold.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nThis is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nThe same,\r\nYour servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nHe’s a good fellow, I can tell you that;\r\nHe’ll strike, and quickly too:. He’s dead and rotten.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nNo, my good lord; I am the very man.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nI’ll see that straight.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nThat from your first of difference and decay\r\nHave follow’d your sad steps.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nYou are welcome hither.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nNor no man else. All’s cheerless, dark and deadly.\r\nYour eldest daughters have fordone themselves,\r\nAnd desperately are dead.\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nAy, so I think.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nHe knows not what he says; and vain is it\r\nThat we present us to him.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nVery bootless.\r\n\r\n Enter an Officer.\r\n\r\nOFFICER.\r\nEdmund is dead, my lord.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nThat’s but a trifle here.\r\nYou lords and noble friends, know our intent.\r\nWhat comfort to this great decay may come\r\nShall be applied. For us, we will resign,\r\nDuring the life of this old majesty,\r\nTo him our absolute power;\r\n[_to Edgar and Kent_] you to your rights;\r\nWith boot and such addition as your honours\r\nHave more than merited. All friends shall taste\r\nThe wages of their virtue and all foes\r\nThe cup of their deservings. O, see, see!\r\n\r\nLEAR.\r\nAnd my poor fool is hang’d! No, no, no life!\r\nWhy should a dog, a horse, a rat have life,\r\nAnd thou no breath at all? Thou’lt come no more,\r\nNever, never, never, never, never!\r\nPray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.\r\nDo you see this? Look on her: look, her lips,\r\nLook there, look there!\r\n\r\n [_He dies._]\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHe faints!

He hates him\r\nThat would upon the rack of this rough world\r\nStretch him out longer.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nHe is gone indeed.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nThe wonder is, he hath endur’d so long:\r\nHe but usurp’d his life.\r\n\r\nALBANY.\r\nBear them from hence. Our present business\r\nIs general woe. [_To Edgar and Kent._] Friends of my soul, you twain,\r\nRule in this realm and the gor’d state sustain.\r\n\r\nKENT.\r\nI have a journey, sir, shortly to go;\r\nMy master calls me, I must not say no.\r\n\r\nEDGAR.\r\nThe weight of this sad time we must obey;\r\nSpeak what we feel, not what we ought to say.\r\nThe oldest hath borne most; we that are young\r\nShall never see so much, nor live so long.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt with a dead march._]",
