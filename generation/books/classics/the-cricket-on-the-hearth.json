How can the ancient English\r\nCathedral tower be here! The well-known massive gray square tower of\r\nits old Cathedral? How can that be here! There is no spike of rusty\r\niron in the air, between the eye and it, from any point of the real\r\nprospect. What is the spike that intervenes, and who has set it up?\r\nMaybe it is set up by the Sultan’s orders for the impaling of a horde\r\nof Turkish robbers, one by one. It is so, for cymbals clash, and the\r\nSultan goes by to his palace in long procession. Ten thousand scimitars\r\nflash in the sunlight, and thrice ten thousand dancing-girls strew\r\nflowers. Then, follow white elephants caparisoned in countless gorgeous\r\ncolours, and infinite in number and attendants. Still the Cathedral\r\nTower rises in the background, where it cannot be, and still no\r\nwrithing figure is on the grim spike. Stay! Is the spike so low a thing\r\nas the rusty spike on the top of a post of an old bedstead that has\r\ntumbled all awry? Some vague period of drowsy laughter must be devoted\r\nto the consideration of this possibility.\r\n\r\nShaking from head to foot, the man whose scattered consciousness has\r\nthus fantastically pieced itself together, at length rises, supports\r\nhis trembling frame upon his arms, and looks around. He is in the\r\nmeanest and closest of small rooms. Through the ragged window-curtain,\r\nthe light of early day steals in from a miserable court. He lies,\r\ndressed, across a large unseemly bed, upon a bedstead that has indeed\r\ngiven way under the weight upon it. Lying, also dressed and also across\r\nthe bed, not longwise, are a Chinaman, a Lascar, and a haggard woman.\r\nThe two first are in a sleep or stupor; the last is blowing at a kind\r\nof pipe, to kindle it. And as she blows, and shading it with her lean\r\nhand, concentrates its red spark of light, it serves in the dim morning\r\nas a lamp to show him what he sees of her.\r\n\r\n“Another?” says this woman, in a querulous, rattling whisper. “Have\r\nanother?”\r\n\r\nHe looks about him, with his hand to his forehead.\r\n\r\n“Ye’ve smoked as many as five since ye come in at midnight,” the woman\r\ngoes on, as she chronically complains. “Poor me, poor me, my head is so\r\nbad. Them two come in after ye. Ah, poor me, the business is slack, is\r\nslack! Few Chinamen about the Docks, and fewer Lascars, and no ships\r\ncoming in, these say! Here’s another ready for ye, deary. Ye’ll\r\nremember like a good soul, won’t ye, that the market price is dreffle\r\nhigh just now? More nor three shillings and sixpence for a thimbleful!\r\nAnd ye’ll remember that nobody but me (and Jack Chinaman t’other side\r\nthe court; but he can’t do it as well as me) has the true secret of\r\nmixing it? Ye’ll pay up accordingly, deary, won’t ye?”\r\n\r\nShe blows at the pipe as she speaks, and, occasionally bubbling at it,\r\ninhales much of its contents.\r\n\r\n“O me, O me, my lungs is weak, my lungs is bad! It’s nearly ready for\r\nye, deary. Ah, poor me, poor me, my poor hand shakes like to drop off!\r\nI see ye coming-to, and I ses to my poor self, ‘I’ll have another ready\r\nfor him, and he’ll bear in mind the market price of opium, and pay\r\naccording.’ O my poor head! I makes my pipes of old penny ink-bottles,\r\nye see, deary—this is one—and I fits-in a mouthpiece, this way, and I\r\ntakes my mixter out of this thimble with this little horn spoon; and so\r\nI fills, deary. Ah, my poor nerves! I got Heavens-hard drunk for\r\nsixteen year afore I took to this; but this don’t hurt me, not to speak\r\nof. And it takes away the hunger as well as wittles, deary.”\r\n\r\nShe hands him the nearly-emptied pipe, and sinks back, turning over on\r\nher face.\r\n\r\nHe rises unsteadily from the bed, lays the pipe upon the hearth-stone,\r\ndraws back the ragged curtain, and looks with repugnance at his three\r\ncompanions. He notices that the woman has opium-smoked herself into a\r\nstrange likeness of the Chinaman. His form of cheek, eye, and temple,\r\nand his colour, are repeated in her. Said Chinaman convulsively\r\nwrestles with one of his many Gods or Devils, perhaps, and snarls\r\nhorribly. The Lascar laughs and dribbles at the mouth. The hostess is\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the Court]\r\n\r\n\r\n“What visions can _she_ have?” the waking man muses, as he turns her\r\nface towards him, and stands looking down at it. “Visions of many\r\nbutchers’ shops, and public-houses, and much credit? Of an increase of\r\nhideous customers, and this horrible bedstead set upright again, and\r\nthis horrible court swept clean? What can she rise to, under any\r\nquantity of opium, higher than that!—Eh?”\r\n\r\nHe bends down his ear, to listen to her mutterings.\r\n\r\n“Unintelligible!”\r\n\r\nAs he watches the spasmodic shoots and darts that break out of her face\r\nand limbs, like fitful lightning out of a dark sky, some contagion in\r\nthem seizes upon him: insomuch that he has to withdraw himself to a\r\nlean arm-chair by the hearth—placed there, perhaps, for such\r\nemergencies—and to sit in it, holding tight, until he has got the\r\nbetter of this unclean spirit of imitation.\r\n\r\nThen he comes back, pounces on the Chinaman, and seizing him with both\r\nhands by the throat, turns him violently on the bed. The Chinaman\r\nclutches the aggressive hands, resists, gasps, and protests.\r\n\r\n“What do you say?”\r\n\r\nA watchful pause.\r\n\r\n“Unintelligible!”\r\n\r\nSlowly loosening his grasp as he listens to the incoherent jargon with\r\nan attentive frown, he turns to the Lascar and fairly drags him forth\r\nupon the floor. As he falls, the Lascar starts into a half-risen\r\nattitude, glares with his eyes, lashes about him fiercely with his\r\narms, and draws a phantom knife. It then becomes apparent that the\r\nwoman has taken possession of this knife, for safety’s sake; for, she\r\ntoo starting up, and restraining and expostulating with him, the knife\r\nis visible in her dress, not in his, when they drowsily drop back, side\r\nby side.\r\n\r\nThere has been chattering and clattering enough between them, but to no\r\npurpose. When any distinct word has been flung into the air, it has had\r\nno sense or sequence. Wherefore “unintelligible!” is again the comment\r\nof the watcher, made with some reassured nodding of his head, and a\r\ngloomy smile. He then lays certain silver money on the table, finds his\r\nhat, gropes his way down the broken stairs, gives a good morning to\r\nsome rat-ridden doorkeeper, in bed in a black hutch beneath the stairs,\r\nand passes out.\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon, the massive gray square tower of an old Cathedral\r\nrises before the sight of a jaded traveller. The bells are going for\r\ndaily vesper service, and he must needs attend it, one would say, from\r\nhis haste to reach the open Cathedral door. The choir are getting on\r\ntheir sullied white robes, in a hurry, when he arrives among them, gets\r\non his own robe, and falls into the procession filing in to service.\r\nThen, the Sacristan locks the iron-barred gates that divide the\r\nsanctuary from the chancel, and all of the procession having scuttled\r\ninto their places, hide their faces; and then the intoned words, “WHEN\r\nTHE WICKED MAN—” rise among groins of arches and beams of roof,\r\nawakening muttered thunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nA DEAN, AND A CHAPTER ALSO\r\n\r\n\r\nWhosoever has observed that sedate and clerical bird, the rook, may\r\nperhaps have noticed that when he wings his way homeward towards\r\nnightfall, in a sedate and clerical company, two rooks will suddenly\r\ndetach themselves from the rest, will retrace their flight for some\r\ndistance, and will there poise and linger; conveying to mere men the\r\nfancy that it is of some occult importance to the body politic, that\r\nthis artful couple should pretend to have renounced connection with it.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, service being over in the old Cathedral with the square\r\ntower, and the choir scuffling out again, and divers venerable persons\r\nof rook-like aspect dispersing, two of these latter retrace their\r\nsteps, and walk together in the echoing Close.\r\n\r\nNot only is the day waning, but the year. The low sun is fiery and yet\r\ncold behind the monastery ruin, and the Virginia creeper on the\r\nCathedral wall has showered half its deep-red leaves down on the\r\npavement. There has been rain this afternoon, and a wintry shudder goes\r\namong the little pools on the cracked, uneven flag-stones, and through\r\nthe giant elm-trees as they shed a gust of tears. Their fallen leaves\r\nlie strewn thickly about. Some of these leaves, in a timid rush, seek\r\nsanctuary within the low arched Cathedral door; but two men coming out\r\nresist them, and cast them forth again with their feet; this done, one\r\nof the two locks the door with a goodly key, and the other flits away\r\nwith a folio music-book.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Jasper was that, Tope?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Dean.”\r\n\r\n“He has stayed late.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Dean. I have stayed for him, your Reverence. He has been took\r\na little poorly.”\r\n\r\n“Say ‘taken,’ Tope—to the Dean,” the younger rook interposes in a low\r\ntone with this touch of correction, as who should say: “You may offer\r\nbad grammar to the laity, or the humbler clergy, not to the Dean.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tope, Chief Verger and Showman, and accustomed to be high with\r\nexcursion parties, declines with a silent loftiness to perceive that\r\nany suggestion has been tendered to him.\r\n\r\n“And when and how has Mr. Jasper been taken—for, as Mr. Crisparkle has\r\nremarked, it is better to say taken—taken—” repeats the Dean; “when and\r\nhow has Mr. Jasper been Taken—”\r\n\r\n“Taken, sir,” Tope deferentially murmurs.\r\n\r\n“—Poorly, Tope?”\r\n\r\n“Why, sir, Mr. Jasper was that breathed—”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t say ‘That breathed,’ Tope,” Mr. Crisparkle interposes with\r\nthe same touch as before. “Not English—to the Dean.”\r\n\r\n“Breathed to that extent,” the Dean (not unflattered by this indirect\r\nhomage) condescendingly remarks, “would be preferable.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Jasper’s breathing was so remarkably short”—thus discreetly does\r\nMr. Tope work his way round the sunken rock—“when he came in, that it\r\ndistressed him mightily to get his notes out: which was perhaps the\r\ncause of his having a kind of fit on him after a little. His memory\r\ngrew DAZED.” Mr. Tope, with his eyes on the Reverend Mr. Crisparkle,\r\nshoots this word out, as defying him to improve upon it: “and a dimness\r\nand giddiness crept over him as strange as ever I saw: though he didn’t\r\nseem to mind it particularly, himself. However, a little time and a\r\nlittle water brought him out of his DAZE.” Mr. Tope repeats the word\r\nand its emphasis, with the air of saying: “As I _have_ made a success,\r\nI’ll make it again.”\r\n\r\n“And Mr. Jasper has gone home quite himself, has he?” asked the Dean.\r\n\r\n“Your Reverence, he has gone home quite himself. And I’m glad to see\r\nhe’s having his fire kindled up, for it’s chilly after the wet, and the\r\nCathedral had both a damp feel and a damp touch this afternoon, and he\r\nwas very shivery.”\r\n\r\nThey all three look towards an old stone gatehouse crossing the Close,\r\nwith an arched thoroughfare passing beneath it. Through its latticed\r\nwindow, a fire shines out upon the fast-darkening scene, involving in\r\nshadow the pendent masses of ivy and creeper covering the building’s\r\nfront. As the deep Cathedral-bell strikes the hour, a ripple of wind\r\ngoes through these at their distance, like a ripple of the solemn sound\r\nthat hums through tomb and tower, broken niche and defaced statue, in\r\nthe pile close at hand.\r\n\r\n“Is Mr. Jasper’s nephew with him?” the Dean asks.\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” replied the Verger, “but expected. There’s his own solitary\r\nshadow betwixt his two windows—the one looking this way, and the one\r\nlooking down into the High Street—drawing his own curtains now.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” says the Dean, with a sprightly air of breaking up the\r\nlittle conference, “I hope Mr. Jasper’s heart may not be too much set\r\nupon his nephew. Our affections, however laudable, in this transitory\r\nworld, should never master us; we should guide them, guide them. I find\r\nI am not disagreeably reminded of my dinner, by hearing my dinner-bell.\r\nPerhaps, Mr. Crisparkle, you will, before going home, look in on\r\nJasper?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Mr. Dean. And tell him that you had the kindness to desire\r\nto know how he was?”\r\n\r\n“Ay; do so, do so. Certainly. Wished to know how he was. By all means.\r\nWished to know how he was.”\r\n\r\nWith a pleasant air of patronage, the Dean as nearly cocks his quaint\r\nhat as a Dean in good spirits may, and directs his comely gaiters\r\ntowards the ruddy dining-room of the snug old red-brick house where he\r\nis at present, “in residence” with Mrs. Dean and Miss Dean.\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle, Minor Canon, fair and rosy, and perpetually pitching\r\nhimself head-foremost into all the deep running water in the\r\nsurrounding country; Mr. Crisparkle, Minor Canon, early riser, musical,\r\nclassical, cheerful, kind, good-natured, social, contented, and\r\nboy-like; Mr. Crisparkle, Minor Canon and good man, lately “Coach” upon\r\nthe chief Pagan high roads, but since promoted by a patron (grateful\r\nfor a well-taught son) to his present Christian beat; betakes himself\r\nto the gatehouse, on his way home to his early tea.\r\n\r\n“Sorry to hear from Tope that you have not been well, Jasper.”\r\n\r\n“O, it was nothing, nothing!”\r\n\r\n“You look a little worn.”\r\n\r\n“Do I? O, I don’t think so. What is better, I don’t feel so. Tope has\r\nmade too much of it, I suspect. It’s his trade to make the most of\r\neverything appertaining to the Cathedral, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I may tell the Dean—I call expressly from the Dean—that you are all\r\nright again?”\r\n\r\nThe reply, with a slight smile, is: “Certainly; with my respects and\r\nthanks to the Dean.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad to hear that you expect young Drood.”\r\n\r\n“I expect the dear fellow every moment.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! He will do you more good than a doctor, Jasper.”\r\n\r\n“More good than a dozen doctors. For I love him dearly, and I don’t\r\nlove doctors, or doctors’ stuff.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper is a dark man of some six-and-twenty, with thick, lustrous,\r\nwell-arranged black hair and whiskers. He looks older than he is, as\r\ndark men often do. His voice is deep and good, his face and figure are\r\ngood, his manner is a little sombre. His room is a little sombre, and\r\nmay have had its influence in forming his manner. It is mostly in\r\nshadow. Even when the sun shines brilliantly, it seldom touches the\r\ngrand piano in the recess, or the folio music-books on the stand, or\r\nthe book-shelves on the wall, or the unfinished picture of a blooming\r\nschoolgirl hanging over the chimneypiece; her flowing brown hair tied\r\nwith a blue riband, and her beauty remarkable for a quite childish,\r\nalmost babyish, touch of saucy discontent, comically conscious of\r\nitself. (There is not the least artistic merit in this picture, which\r\nis a mere daub; but it is clear that the painter has made it\r\nhumorously—one might almost say, revengefully—like the original.)\r\n\r\n“We shall miss you, Jasper, at the ‘Alternate Musical Wednesdays’\r\nto-night; but no doubt you are best at home. Good-night. God bless you!\r\n‘Tell me, shep-herds, te-e-ell me; tell me-e-e, have you seen (have you\r\nseen, have you seen, have you seen) my-y-y Flo-o-ora-a pass this way!’”\r\nMelodiously good Minor Canon the Reverend Septimus Crisparkle thus\r\ndelivers himself, in musical rhythm, as he withdraws his amiable face\r\nfrom the doorway and conveys it down-stairs.\r\n\r\nSounds of recognition and greeting pass between the Reverend Septimus\r\nand somebody else, at the stair-foot. Mr. Jasper listens, starts from\r\nhis chair, and catches a young fellow in his arms, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“My dear Edwin!”\r\n\r\n“My dear Jack! So glad to see you!”\r\n\r\n“Get off your greatcoat, bright boy, and sit down here in your own\r\ncorner. Your feet are not wet? Pull your boots off. Do pull your boots\r\noff.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Jack, I am as dry as a bone. Don’t moddley-coddley, there’s a\r\ngood fellow. I like anything better than being moddley-coddleyed.”\r\n\r\nWith the check upon him of being unsympathetically restrained in a\r\ngenial outburst of enthusiasm, Mr. Jasper stands still, and looks on\r\nintently at the young fellow, divesting himself of his outward coat,\r\nhat, gloves, and so forth. Once for all, a look of intentness and\r\nintensity—a look of hungry, exacting, watchful, and yet devoted\r\naffection—is always, now and ever afterwards, on the Jasper face\r\nwhenever the Jasper face is addressed in this direction. And whenever\r\nit is so addressed, it is never, on this occasion or on any other,\r\ndividedly addressed; it is always concentrated.\r\n\r\n“Now I am right, and now I’ll take my corner, Jack. Any dinner, Jack?”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper opens a door at the upper end of the room, and discloses a\r\nsmall inner room pleasantly lighted and prepared, wherein a comely dame\r\nis in the act of setting dishes on table.\r\n\r\n“What a jolly old Jack it is!” cries the young fellow, with a clap of\r\nhis hands. “Look here, Jack; tell me; whose birthday is it?”\r\n\r\n“Not yours, I know,” Mr. Jasper answers, pausing to consider.\r\n\r\n“Not mine, you know? No; not mine, _I_ know! Pussy’s!”\r\n\r\nFixed as the look the young fellow meets is, there is yet in it some\r\nstrange power of suddenly including the sketch over the chimneypiece.\r\n\r\n“Pussy’s, Jack! We must drink Many happy returns to her. Come, uncle;\r\ntake your dutiful and sharp-set nephew in to dinner.”\r\n\r\nAs the boy (for he is little more) lays a hand on Jasper’s shoulder,\r\nJasper cordially and gaily lays a hand on _his_ shoulder, and so\r\nMarseillaise-wise they go in to dinner.\r\n\r\n“And, Lord! here’s Mrs. Tope!” cries the boy. “Lovelier than ever!”\r\n\r\n“Never you mind me, Master Edwin,” retorts the Verger’s wife; “I can\r\ntake care of myself.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t. You’re much too handsome. Give me a kiss because it’s\r\nPussy’s birthday.”\r\n\r\n“I’d Pussy you, young man, if I was Pussy, as you call her,” Mrs. Tope\r\nblushingly retorts, after being saluted. “Your uncle’s too much wrapt\r\nup in you, that’s where it is. He makes so much of you, that it’s my\r\nopinion you think you’ve only to call your Pussys by the dozen, to make\r\n’em come.”\r\n\r\n“You forget, Mrs. Tope,” Mr. Jasper interposes, taking his place at the\r\ntable with a genial smile, “and so do you, Ned, that Uncle and Nephew\r\nare words prohibited here by common consent and express agreement. For\r\nwhat we are going to receive His holy name be praised!”\r\n\r\n“Done like the Dean! Witness, Edwin Drood! Please to carve, Jack, for I\r\ncan’t.”\r\n\r\nThis sally ushers in the dinner. Little to the present purpose, or to\r\nany purpose, is said, while it is in course of being disposed of. At\r\nlength the cloth is drawn, and a dish of walnuts and a decanter of\r\nrich-coloured sherry are placed upon the table.\r\n\r\n“I say! Tell me, Jack,” the young fellow then flows on: “do you really\r\nand truly feel as if the mention of our relationship divided us at all?\r\n_I_ don’t.”\r\n\r\n“Uncles as a rule, Ned, are so much older than their nephews,” is the\r\nreply, “that I have that feeling instinctively.”\r\n\r\n“As a rule! Ah, may-be! But what is a difference in age of half-a-dozen\r\nyears or so? And some uncles, in large families, are even younger than\r\ntheir nephews. By George, I wish it was the case with us!”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because if it was, I’d take the lead with you, Jack, and be as wise as\r\nBegone, dull Care! that turned a young man gray, and Begone, dull Care!\r\nthat turned an old man to clay.—Halloa, Jack! Don’t drink.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Asks why not, on Pussy’s birthday, and no Happy returns proposed!\r\nPussy, Jack, and many of ’em! Happy returns, I mean.”\r\n\r\nLaying an affectionate and laughing touch on the boy’s extended hand,\r\nas if it were at once his giddy head and his light heart, Mr. Jasper\r\ndrinks the toast in silence.\r\n\r\n“Hip, hip, hip, and nine times nine, and one to finish with, and all\r\nthat, understood. Hooray, hooray, hooray!—And now, Jack, let’s have a\r\nlittle talk about Pussy. Two pairs of nut-crackers? Pass me one, and\r\ntake the other.” Crack. “How’s Pussy getting on Jack?”\r\n\r\n“With her music? Fairly.”\r\n\r\n“What a dreadfully conscientious fellow you are, Jack! But _I_ know,\r\nLord bless you! Inattentive, isn’t she?”\r\n\r\n“She can learn anything, if she will.”\r\n\r\n“_If_ she will! Egad, that’s it. But if she won’t?”\r\n\r\nCrack!—on Mr. Jasper’s part.\r\n\r\n“How’s she looking, Jack?”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper’s concentrated face again includes the portrait as he\r\nreturns: “Very like your sketch indeed.”\r\n\r\n“I _am_ a little proud of it,” says the young fellow, glancing up at\r\nthe sketch with complacency, and then shutting one eye, and taking a\r\ncorrected prospect of it over a level bridge of nut-crackers in the\r\nair: “Not badly hit off from memory. But I ought to have caught that\r\nexpression pretty well, for I have seen it often enough.”\r\n\r\nCrack!—on Edwin Drood’s part.\r\n\r\nCrack!—on Mr. Jasper’s part.\r\n\r\n“In point of fact,” the former resumes, after some silent dipping among\r\nhis fragments of walnut with an air of pique, “I see it whenever I go\r\nto see Pussy. If I don’t find it on her face, I leave it there.—You\r\nknow I do, Miss Scornful Pert. Booh!” With a twirl of the nut-crackers\r\nat the portrait.\r\n\r\nCrack! crack! crack. Slowly, on Mr. Jasper’s part.\r\n\r\nCrack. Sharply on the part of Edwin Drood.\r\n\r\nSilence on both sides.\r\n\r\n“Have you lost your tongue, Jack?”\r\n\r\n“Have you found yours, Ned?”\r\n\r\n“No, but really;—isn’t it, you know, after all—”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper lifts his dark eyebrows inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it unsatisfactory to be cut off from choice in such a matter?\r\nThere, Jack! I tell you! If I could choose, I would choose Pussy from\r\nall the pretty girls in the world.”\r\n\r\n“But you have not got to choose.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I complain of. My dead and gone father and Pussy’s dead\r\nand gone father must needs marry us together by anticipation. Why\r\nthe—Devil, I was going to say, if it had been respectful to their\r\nmemory—couldn’t they leave us alone?”\r\n\r\n“Tut, tut, dear boy,” Mr. Jasper remonstrates, in a tone of gentle\r\ndeprecation.\r\n\r\n“Tut, tut? Yes, Jack, it’s all very well for _you_. _You_ can take it\r\neasily. _Your_ life is not laid down to scale, and lined and dotted out\r\nfor you, like a surveyor’s plan. _You_ have no uncomfortable suspicion\r\nthat you are forced upon anybody, nor has anybody an uncomfortable\r\nsuspicion that she is forced upon you, or that you are forced upon her.\r\n_You_ can choose for yourself. Life, for _you_, is a plum with the\r\nnatural bloom on; it hasn’t been over-carefully wiped off for _you_—”\r\n\r\n“Don’t stop, dear fellow. Go on.”\r\n\r\n“Can I anyhow have hurt your feelings, Jack?”\r\n\r\n“How can you have hurt my feelings?”\r\n\r\n“Good Heaven, Jack, you look frightfully ill! There’s a strange film\r\ncome over your eyes.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper, with a forced smile, stretches out his right hand, as if at\r\nonce to disarm apprehension and gain time to get better. After a while\r\nhe says faintly:\r\n\r\n“I have been taking opium for a pain—an agony—that sometimes overcomes\r\nme. The effects of the medicine steal over me like a blight or a cloud,\r\nand pass. You see them in the act of passing; they will be gone\r\ndirectly. Look away from me. They will go all the sooner.”\r\n\r\nWith a scared face the younger man complies by casting his eyes\r\ndownward at the ashes on the hearth. Not relaxing his own gaze on the\r\nfire, but rather strengthening it with a fierce, firm grip upon his\r\nelbow-chair, the elder sits for a few moments rigid, and then, with\r\nthick drops standing on his forehead, and a sharp catch of his breath,\r\nbecomes as he was before. On his so subsiding in his chair, his nephew\r\ngently and assiduously tends him while he quite recovers. When Jasper\r\nis restored, he lays a tender hand upon his nephew’s shoulder, and, in\r\na tone of voice less troubled than the purport of his words—indeed with\r\nsomething of raillery or banter in it—thus addresses him:\r\n\r\n“There is said to be a hidden skeleton in every house; but you thought\r\nthere was none in mine, dear Ned.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my life, Jack, I did think so. However, when I come to consider\r\nthat even in Pussy’s house—if she had one—and in mine—if I had one—”\r\n\r\n“You were going to say (but that I interrupted you in spite of myself)\r\nwhat a quiet life mine is. No whirl and uproar around me, no\r\ndistracting commerce or calculation, no risk, no change of place,\r\nmyself devoted to the art I pursue, my business my pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“I really was going to say something of the kind, Jack; but you see,\r\nyou, speaking of yourself, almost necessarily leave out much that I\r\nshould have put in. For instance: I should have put in the foreground\r\nyour being so much respected as Lay Precentor, or Lay Clerk, or\r\nwhatever you call it, of this Cathedral; your enjoying the reputation\r\nof having done such wonders with the choir; your choosing your society,\r\nand holding such an independent position in this queer old place; your\r\ngift of teaching (why, even Pussy, who don’t like being taught, says\r\nthere never was such a Master as you are!), and your connexion.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I saw what you were tending to. I hate it.”\r\n\r\n“Hate it, Jack?” (Much bewildered.)\r\n\r\n“I hate it. The cramped monotony of my existence grinds me away by the\r\ngrain. How does our service sound to you?”\r\n\r\n“Beautiful! Quite celestial!”\r\n\r\n“It often sounds to me quite devilish. I am so weary of it. The echoes\r\nof my own voice among the arches seem to mock me with my daily drudging\r\nround. No wretched monk who droned his life away in that gloomy place,\r\nbefore me, can have been more tired of it than I am. He could take for\r\nrelief (and did take) to carving demons out of the stalls and seats and\r\ndesks. What shall I do? Must I take to carving them out of my heart?”\r\n\r\n“I thought you had so exactly found your niche in life, Jack,” Edwin\r\nDrood returns, astonished, bending forward in his chair to lay a\r\nsympathetic hand on Jasper’s knee, and looking at him with an anxious\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“I know you thought so. They all think so.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose they do,” says Edwin, meditating aloud. “Pussy thinks\r\nso.”\r\n\r\n“When did she tell you that?”\r\n\r\n“The last time I was here. You remember when. Three months ago.”\r\n\r\n“How did she phrase it?”\r\n\r\n“O, she only said that she had become your pupil, and that you were\r\nmade for your vocation.”\r\n\r\nThe younger man glances at the portrait. The elder sees it in him.\r\n\r\n“Anyhow, my dear Ned,” Jasper resumes, as he shakes his head with a\r\ngrave cheerfulness, “I must subdue myself to my vocation: which is much\r\nthe same thing outwardly. It’s too late to find another now. This is a\r\nconfidence between us.”\r\n\r\n“It shall be sacredly preserved, Jack.”\r\n\r\n“I have reposed it in you, because—”\r\n\r\n“I feel it, I assure you. Because we are fast friends, and because you\r\nlove and trust me, as I love and trust you. Both hands, Jack.”\r\n\r\nAs each stands looking into the other’s eyes, and as the uncle holds\r\nthe nephew’s hands, the uncle thus proceeds:\r\n\r\n“You know now, don’t you, that even a poor monotonous chorister and\r\ngrinder of music—in his niche—may be troubled with some stray sort of\r\nambition, aspiration, restlessness, dissatisfaction, what shall we call\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear Jack.”\r\n\r\n“And you will remember?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Jack, I only ask you, am I likely to forget what you have said\r\nwith so much feeling?”\r\n\r\n“Take it as a warning, then.”\r\n\r\nIn the act of having his hands released, and of moving a step back,\r\nEdwin pauses for an instant to consider the application of these last\r\nwords. The instant over, he says, sensibly touched:\r\n\r\n“I am afraid I am but a shallow, surface kind of fellow, Jack, and that\r\nmy headpiece is none of the best. But I needn’t say I am young; and\r\nperhaps I shall not grow worse as I grow older. At all events, I hope I\r\nhave something impressible within me, which feels—deeply feels—the\r\ndisinterestedness of your painfully laying your inner self bare, as a\r\nwarning to me.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper’s steadiness of face and figure becomes so marvellous that\r\nhis breathing seems to have stopped.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t fail to notice, Jack, that it cost you a great effort, and\r\nthat you were very much moved, and very unlike your usual self. Of\r\ncourse I knew that you were extremely fond of me, but I really was not\r\nprepared for your, as I may say, sacrificing yourself to me in that\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper, becoming a breathing man again without the smallest stage\r\nof transition between the two extreme states, lifts his shoulders,\r\nlaughs, and waves his right arm.\r\n\r\n“No; don’t put the sentiment away, Jack; please don’t; for I am very\r\nmuch in earnest. I have no doubt that that unhealthy state of mind\r\nwhich you have so powerfully described is attended with some real\r\nsuffering, and is hard to bear. But let me reassure you, Jack, as to\r\nthe chances of its overcoming me. I don’t think I am in the way of it.\r\nIn some few months less than another year, you know, I shall carry\r\nPussy off from school as Mrs. Edwin Drood. I shall then go engineering\r\ninto the East, and Pussy with me. And although we have our little tiffs\r\nnow, arising out of a certain unavoidable flatness that attends our\r\nlove-making, owing to its end being all settled beforehand, still I\r\nhave no doubt of our getting on capitally then, when it’s done and\r\ncan’t be helped. In short, Jack, to go back to the old song I was\r\nfreely quoting at dinner (and who knows old songs better than you?), my\r\nwife shall dance, and I will sing, so merrily pass the day. Of Pussy’s\r\nbeing beautiful there cannot be a doubt;—and when you are good besides,\r\nLittle Miss Impudence,” once more apostrophising the portrait, “I’ll\r\nburn your comic likeness, and paint your music-master another.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper, with his hand to his chin, and with an expression of musing\r\nbenevolence on his face, has attentively watched every animated look\r\nand gesture attending the delivery of these words. He remains in that\r\nattitude after they are spoken, as if in a kind of fascination\r\nattendant on his strong interest in the youthful spirit that he loves\r\nso well. Then he says with a quiet smile:\r\n\r\n“You won’t be warned, then?”\r\n\r\n“No, Jack.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t be warned, then?”\r\n\r\n“No, Jack, not by you. Besides that I don’t really consider myself in\r\ndanger, I don’t like your putting yourself in that position.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we go and walk in the churchyard?”\r\n\r\n“By all means. You won’t mind my slipping out of it for half a moment\r\nto the Nuns’ House, and leaving a parcel there? Only gloves for Pussy;\r\nas many pairs of gloves as she is years old to-day. Rather poetical,\r\nJack?”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper, still in the same attitude, murmurs: “‘Nothing half so\r\nsweet in life,’ Ned!”\r\n\r\n“Here’s the parcel in my greatcoat-pocket. They must be presented\r\nto-night, or the poetry is gone. It’s against regulations for me to\r\ncall at night, but not to leave a packet. I am ready, Jack!”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper dissolves his attitude, and they go out together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTHE NUNS’ HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor sufficient reasons, which this narrative will itself unfold as it\r\nadvances, a fictitious name must be bestowed upon the old Cathedral\r\ntown. Let it stand in these pages as Cloisterham. It was once possibly\r\nknown to the Druids by another name, and certainly to the Romans by\r\nanother, and to the Saxons by another, and to the Normans by another;\r\nand a name more or less in the course of many centuries can be of\r\nlittle moment to its dusty chronicles.\r\n\r\nAn ancient city, Cloisterham, and no meet dwelling-place for any one\r\nwith hankerings after the noisy world. A monotonous, silent city,\r\nderiving an earthy flavour throughout from its Cathedral crypt, and so\r\nabounding in vestiges of monastic graves, that the Cloisterham children\r\ngrow small salad in the dust of abbots and abbesses, and make dirt-pies\r\nof nuns and friars; while every ploughman in its outlying fields\r\nrenders to once puissant Lord Treasurers, Archbishops, Bishops, and\r\nsuch-like, the attention which the Ogre in the story-book desired to\r\nrender to his unbidden visitor, and grinds their bones to make his\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nA drowsy city, Cloisterham, whose inhabitants seem to suppose, with an\r\ninconsistency more strange than rare, that all its changes lie behind\r\nit, and that there are no more to come. A queer moral to derive from\r\nantiquity, yet older than any traceable antiquity. So silent are the\r\nstreets of Cloisterham (though prone to echo on the smallest\r\nprovocation), that of a summer-day the sunblinds of its shops scarce\r\ndare to flap in the south wind; while the sun-browned tramps, who pass\r\nalong and stare, quicken their limp a little, that they may the sooner\r\nget beyond the confines of its oppressive respectability. This is a\r\nfeat not difficult of achievement, seeing that the streets of\r\nCloisterham city are little more than one narrow street by which you\r\nget into it and get out of it: the rest being mostly disappointing\r\nyards with pumps in them and no thoroughfare—exception made of the\r\nCathedral-close, and a paved Quaker settlement, in colour and general\r\nconfirmation very like a Quakeress’s bonnet, up in a shady corner.\r\n\r\nIn a word, a city of another and a bygone time is Cloisterham, with its\r\nhoarse Cathedral-bell, its hoarse rooks hovering about the Cathedral\r\ntower, its hoarser and less distinct rooks in the stalls far beneath.\r\nFragments of old wall, saint’s chapel, chapter-house, convent and\r\nmonastery, have got incongruously or obstructively built into many of\r\nits houses and gardens, much as kindred jumbled notions have become\r\nincorporated into many of its citizens’ minds. All things in it are of\r\nthe past. Even its single pawnbroker takes in no pledges, nor has he\r\nfor a long time, but offers vainly an unredeemed stock for sale, of\r\nwhich the costlier articles are dim and pale old watches apparently in\r\na slow perspiration, tarnished sugar-tongs with ineffectual legs, and\r\nodd volumes of dismal books. The most abundant and the most agreeable\r\nevidences of progressing life in Cloisterham are the evidences of\r\nvegetable life in many gardens; even its drooping and despondent little\r\ntheatre has its poor strip of garden, receiving the foul fiend, when he\r\nducks from its stage into the infernal regions, among scarlet-beans or\r\noyster-shells, according to the season of the year.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of Cloisterham stands the Nuns’ House: a venerable brick\r\nedifice, whose present appellation is doubtless derived from the legend\r\nof its conventual uses. On the trim gate enclosing its old courtyard is\r\na resplendent brass plate flashing forth the legend: “Seminary for\r\nYoung Ladies. Miss Twinkleton.” The house-front is so old and worn, and\r\nthe brass plate is so shining and staring, that the general result has\r\nreminded imaginative strangers of a battered old beau with a large\r\nmodern eye-glass stuck in his blind eye.\r\n\r\nWhether the nuns of yore, being of a submissive rather than a\r\nstiff-necked generation, habitually bent their contemplative heads to\r\navoid collision with the beams in the low ceilings of the many chambers\r\nof their House; whether they sat in its long low windows telling their\r\nbeads for their mortification, instead of making necklaces of them for\r\ntheir adornment; whether they were ever walled up alive in odd angles\r\nand jutting gables of the building for having some ineradicable leaven\r\nof busy mother Nature in them which has kept the fermenting world alive\r\never since; these may be matters of interest to its haunting ghosts (if\r\nany), but constitute no item in Miss Twinkleton’s half-yearly accounts.\r\nThey are neither of Miss Twinkleton’s inclusive regulars, nor of her\r\nextras. The lady who undertakes the poetical department of the\r\nestablishment at so much (or so little) a quarter has no pieces in her\r\nlist of recitals bearing on such unprofitable questions.\r\n\r\nAs, in some cases of drunkenness, and in others of animal magnetism,\r\nthere are two states of consciousness which never clash, but each of\r\nwhich pursues its separate course as though it were continuous instead\r\nof broken (thus, if I hide my watch when I am drunk, I must be drunk\r\nagain before I can remember where), so Miss Twinkleton has two distinct\r\nand separate phases of being. Every night, the moment the young ladies\r\nhave retired to rest, does Miss Twinkleton smarten up her curls a\r\nlittle, brighten up her eyes a little, and become a sprightlier Miss\r\nTwinkleton than the young ladies have ever seen. Every night, at the\r\nsame hour, does Miss Twinkleton resume the topics of the previous\r\nnight, comprehending the tenderer scandal of Cloisterham, of which she\r\nhas no knowledge whatever by day, and references to a certain season at\r\nTunbridge Wells (airily called by Miss Twinkleton in this state of her\r\nexistence “The Wells”), notably the season wherein a certain finished\r\ngentleman (compassionately called by Miss Twinkleton, in this stage of\r\nher existence, “Foolish Mr. Porters”) revealed a homage of the heart,\r\nwhereof Miss Twinkleton, in her scholastic state of existence, is as\r\nignorant as a granite pillar. Miss Twinkleton’s companion in both\r\nstates of existence, and equally adaptable to either, is one Mrs.\r\nTisher: a deferential widow with a weak back, a chronic sigh, and a\r\nsuppressed voice, who looks after the young ladies’ wardrobes, and\r\nleads them to infer that she has seen better days. Perhaps this is the\r\nreason why it is an article of faith with the servants, handed down\r\nfrom race to race, that the departed Tisher was a hairdresser.\r\n\r\nThe pet pupil of the Nuns’ House is Miss Rosa Bud, of course called\r\nRosebud; wonderfully pretty, wonderfully childish, wonderfully\r\nwhimsical. An awkward interest (awkward because romantic) attaches to\r\nMiss Bud in the minds of the young ladies, on account of its being\r\nknown to them that a husband has been chosen for her by will and\r\nbequest, and that her guardian is bound down to bestow her on that\r\nhusband when he comes of age. Miss Twinkleton, in her seminarial state\r\nof existence, has combated the romantic aspect of this destiny by\r\naffecting to shake her head over it behind Miss Bud’s dimpled\r\nshoulders, and to brood on the unhappy lot of that doomed little\r\nvictim. But with no better effect—possibly some unfelt touch of foolish\r\nMr. Porters has undermined the endeavour—than to evoke from the young\r\nladies an unanimous bedchamber cry of “O, what a pretending old thing\r\nMiss Twinkleton is, my dear!”\r\n\r\nThe Nuns’ House is never in such a state of flutter as when this\r\nallotted husband calls to see little Rosebud. (It is unanimously\r\nunderstood by the young ladies that he is lawfully entitled to this\r\nprivilege, and that if Miss Twinkleton disputed it, she would be\r\ninstantly taken up and transported.) When his ring at the gate-bell is\r\nexpected, or takes place, every young lady who can, under any pretence,\r\nlook out of window, looks out of window; while every young lady who is\r\n“practising,” practises out of time; and the French class becomes so\r\ndemoralised that the mark goes round as briskly as the bottle at a\r\nconvivial party in the last century.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the day next after the dinner of two at the\r\ngatehouse, the bell is rung with the usual fluttering results.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Edwin Drood to see Miss Rosa.”\r\n\r\nThis is the announcement of the parlour-maid in chief. Miss Twinkleton,\r\nwith an exemplary air of melancholy on her, turns to the sacrifice, and\r\nsays, “You may go down, my dear.” Miss Bud goes down, followed by all\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nMr. Edwin Drood is waiting in Miss Twinkleton’s own parlour: a dainty\r\nroom, with nothing more directly scholastic in it than a terrestrial\r\nand a celestial globe. These expressive machines imply (to parents and\r\nguardians) that even when Miss Twinkleton retires into the bosom of\r\nprivacy, duty may at any moment compel her to become a sort of\r\nWandering Jewess, scouring the earth and soaring through the skies in\r\nsearch of knowledge for her pupils.\r\n\r\nThe last new maid, who has never seen the young gentleman Miss Rosa is\r\nengaged to, and who is making his acquaintance between the hinges of\r\nthe open door, left open for the purpose, stumbles guiltily down the\r\nkitchen stairs, as a charming little apparition, with its face\r\nconcealed by a little silk apron thrown over its head, glides into the\r\nparlour.\r\n\r\n“O! it _is_ so ridiculous!” says the apparition, stopping and\r\nshrinking. “Don’t, Eddy!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t what, Rosa?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t come any nearer, please. It _is_ so absurd.”\r\n\r\n“What is absurd, Rosa?”\r\n\r\n“The whole thing is. It _is_ so absurd to be an engaged orphan and it\r\n_is_ so absurd to have the girls and the servants scuttling about after\r\none, like mice in the wainscot; and it _is_ so absurd to be called\r\nupon!”\r\n\r\nThe apparition appears to have a thumb in the corner of its mouth while\r\nmaking this complaint.\r\n\r\n“You give me an affectionate reception, Pussy, I must say.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will in a minute, Eddy, but I can’t just yet. How are you?”\r\n(very shortly.)\r\n\r\n“I am unable to reply that I am much the better for seeing you, Pussy,\r\ninasmuch as I see nothing of you.”\r\n\r\nThis second remonstrance brings a dark, bright, pouting eye out from a\r\ncorner of the apron; but it swiftly becomes invisible again, as the\r\napparition exclaims: “O good gracious! you have had half your hair cut\r\noff!”\r\n\r\n“I should have done better to have had my head cut off, I think,” says\r\nEdwin, rumpling the hair in question, with a fierce glance at the\r\nlooking-glass, and giving an impatient stamp. “Shall I go?”\r\n\r\n“No; you needn’t go just yet, Eddy. The girls would all be asking\r\nquestions why you went.”\r\n\r\n“Once for all, Rosa, will you uncover that ridiculous little head of\r\nyours and give me a welcome?”\r\n\r\nThe apron is pulled off the childish head, as its wearer replies:\r\n“You’re very welcome, Eddy. There! I’m sure that’s nice. Shake hands.\r\nNo, I can’t kiss you, because I’ve got an acidulated drop in my mouth.”\r\n\r\n“Are you at all glad to see me, Pussy?”\r\n\r\n“O, yes, I’m dreadfully glad.—Go and sit down.—Miss Twinkleton.”\r\n\r\nIt is the custom of that excellent lady when these visits occur, to\r\nappear every three minutes, either in her own person or in that of Mrs.\r\nTisher, and lay an offering on the shrine of Propriety by affecting to\r\nlook for some desiderated article. On the present occasion Miss\r\nTwinkleton, gracefully gliding in and out, says in passing: “How do you\r\ndo, Mr. Drood? Very glad indeed to have the pleasure. Pray excuse me.\r\nTweezers. Thank you!”\r\n\r\n“I got the gloves last evening, Eddy, and I like them very much. They\r\nare beauties.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s something,” the affianced replies, half grumbling. “The\r\nsmallest encouragement thankfully received. And how did you pass your\r\nbirthday, Pussy?”\r\n\r\n“Delightfully! Everybody gave me a present. And we had a feast. And we\r\nhad a ball at night.”\r\n\r\n“A feast and a ball, eh? These occasions seem to go off tolerably well\r\nwithout me, Pussy.”\r\n\r\n“De-lightfully!” cries Rosa, in a quite spontaneous manner, and without\r\nthe least pretence of reserve.\r\n\r\n“Hah! And what was the feast?”\r\n\r\n“Tarts, oranges, jellies, and shrimps.”\r\n\r\n“Any partners at the ball?”\r\n\r\n“We danced with one another, of course, sir. But some of the girls made\r\ngame to be their brothers. It _was_ so droll!”\r\n\r\n“Did anybody make game to be—”\r\n\r\n“To be you? O dear yes!” cries Rosa, laughing with great enjoyment.\r\n“That was the first thing done.”\r\n\r\n“I hope she did it pretty well,” says Edwin rather doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“O, it was excellent!—I wouldn’t dance with you, you know.”\r\n\r\nEdwin scarcely seems to see the force of this; begs to know if he may\r\ntake the liberty to ask why?\r\n\r\n“Because I was so tired of you,” returns Rosa. But she quickly adds,\r\nand pleadingly too, seeing displeasure in his face: “Dear Eddy, you\r\nwere just as tired of me, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Did I say so, Rosa?”\r\n\r\n“Say so! Do you ever say so? No, you only showed it. O, she did it so\r\nwell!” cries Rosa, in a sudden ecstasy with her counterfeit betrothed.\r\n\r\n“It strikes me that she must be a devilish impudent girl,” says Edwin\r\nDrood. “And so, Pussy, you have passed your last birthday in this old\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes!” Rosa clasps her hands, looks down with a sigh, and shakes\r\nher head.\r\n\r\n“You seem to be sorry, Rosa.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry for the poor old place. Somehow, I feel as if it would miss\r\nme, when I am gone so far away, so young.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we had better stop short, Rosa?”\r\n\r\nShe looks up at him with a swift bright look; next moment shakes her\r\nhead, sighs, and looks down again.\r\n\r\n“That is to say, is it, Pussy, that we are both resigned?”\r\n\r\nShe nods her head again, and after a short silence, quaintly bursts out\r\nwith: “You know we must be married, and married from here, Eddy, or the\r\npoor girls will be so dreadfully disappointed!”\r\n\r\nFor the moment there is more of compassion, both for her and for\r\nhimself, in her affianced husband’s face, than there is of love. He\r\nchecks the look, and asks: “Shall I take you out for a walk, Rosa\r\ndear?”\r\n\r\nRosa dear does not seem at all clear on this point, until her face,\r\nwhich has been comically reflective, brightens. “O, yes, Eddy; let us\r\ngo for a walk! And I tell you what we’ll do. You shall pretend that you\r\nare engaged to somebody else, and I’ll pretend that I am not engaged to\r\nanybody, and then we shan’t quarrel.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think that will prevent our falling out, Rosa?”\r\n\r\n“I know it will. Hush! Pretend to look out of window—Mrs. Tisher!”\r\n\r\nThrough a fortuitous concourse of accidents, the matronly Tisher heaves\r\nin sight, says, in rustling through the room like the legendary ghost\r\nof a dowager in silken skirts: “I hope I see Mr. Drood well; though I\r\nneedn’t ask, if I may judge from his complexion. I trust I disturb no\r\none; but there _was_ a paper-knife—O, thank you, I am sure!” and\r\ndisappears with her prize.\r\n\r\n“One other thing you must do, Eddy, to oblige me,” says Rosebud. “The\r\nmoment we get into the street, you must put me outside, and keep close\r\nto the house yourself—squeeze and graze yourself against it.”\r\n\r\n“By all means, Rosa, if you wish it. Might I ask why?”\r\n\r\n“O! because I don’t want the girls to see you.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a fine day; but would you like me to carry an umbrella up?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be foolish, sir. You haven’t got polished leather boots on,”\r\npouting, with one shoulder raised.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps that might escape the notice of the girls, even if they did\r\nsee me,” remarks Edwin, looking down at his boots with a sudden\r\ndistaste for them.\r\n\r\n“Nothing escapes their notice, sir. And then I know what would happen.\r\nSome of them would begin reflecting on me by saying (for _they_ are\r\nfree) that they never will on any account engage themselves to lovers\r\nwithout polished leather boots. Hark! Miss Twinkleton. I’ll ask for\r\nleave.”\r\n\r\nThat discreet lady being indeed heard without, inquiring of nobody in a\r\nblandly conversational tone as she advances: “Eh? Indeed! Are you quite\r\nsure you saw my mother-of-pearl button-holder on the work-table in my\r\nroom?” is at once solicited for walking leave, and graciously accords\r\nit. And soon the young couple go out of the Nuns’ House, taking all\r\nprecautions against the discovery of the so vitally defective boots of\r\nMr. Edwin Drood: precautions, let us hope, effective for the peace of\r\nMrs. Edwin Drood that is to be.\r\n\r\n“Which way shall we take, Rosa?”\r\n\r\nRosa replies: “I want to go to the Lumps-of-Delight shop.”\r\n\r\n“To the—?”\r\n\r\n“A Turkish sweetmeat, sir. My gracious me, don’t you understand\r\nanything? Call yourself an Engineer, and not know _that_?”\r\n\r\n“Why, how should I know it, Rosa?”\r\n\r\n“Because I am very fond of them. But O! I forgot what we are to\r\npretend. No, you needn’t know anything about them; never mind.”\r\n\r\nSo he is gloomily borne off to the Lumps-of-Delight shop, where Rosa\r\nmakes her purchase, and, after offering some to him (which he rather\r\nindignantly declines), begins to partake of it with great zest:\r\npreviously taking off and rolling up a pair of little pink gloves, like\r\nrose-leaves, and occasionally putting her little pink fingers to her\r\nrosy lips, to cleanse them from the Dust of Delight that comes off the\r\nLumps.\r\n\r\n“Now, be a good-tempered Eddy, and pretend. And so you are engaged?”\r\n\r\n“And so I am engaged.”\r\n\r\n“Is she nice?”\r\n\r\n“Charming.”\r\n\r\n“Tall?”\r\n\r\n“Immensely tall!” Rosa being short.\r\n\r\n“Must be gawky, I should think,” is Rosa’s quiet commentary.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon; not at all,” contradiction rising in him.\r\n\r\n“What is termed a fine woman; a splendid woman.”\r\n\r\n“Big nose, no doubt,” is the quiet commentary again.\r\n\r\n“Not a little one, certainly,” is the quick reply, (Rosa’s being a\r\nlittle one.)\r\n\r\n“Long pale nose, with a red knob in the middle. I know the sort of\r\nnose,” says Rosa, with a satisfied nod, and tranquilly enjoying the\r\nLumps.\r\n\r\n“You _don’t_ know the sort of nose, Rosa,” with some warmth; “because\r\nit’s nothing of the kind.”\r\n\r\n“Not a pale nose, Eddy?”\r\n\r\n“No.” Determined not to assent.\r\n\r\n“A red nose? O! I don’t like red noses. However; to be sure she can\r\nalways powder it.”\r\n\r\n“She would scorn to powder it,” says Edwin, becoming heated.\r\n\r\n“Would she? What a stupid thing she must be! Is she stupid in\r\neverything?”\r\n\r\n“No; in nothing.”\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, in which the whimsically wicked face has not been\r\nunobservant of him, Rosa says:\r\n\r\n“And this most sensible of creatures likes the idea of being carried\r\noff to Egypt; does she, Eddy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. She takes a sensible interest in triumphs of engineering skill:\r\nespecially when they are to change the whole condition of an\r\nundeveloped country.”\r\n\r\n“Lor!” says Rosa, shrugging her shoulders, with a little laugh of\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n“Do you object,” Edwin inquires, with a majestic turn of his eyes\r\ndownward upon the fairy figure: “do you object, Rosa, to her feeling\r\nthat interest?”\r\n\r\n“Object? my dear Eddy! But really, doesn’t she hate boilers and\r\nthings?”\r\n\r\n“I can answer for her not being so idiotic as to hate Boilers,” he\r\nreturns with angry emphasis; “though I cannot answer for her views\r\nabout Things; really not understanding what Things are meant.”\r\n\r\n“But don’t she hate Arabs, and Turks, and Fellahs, and people?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not.” Very firmly.\r\n\r\n“At least she _must_ hate the Pyramids? Come, Eddy?”\r\n\r\n“Why should she be such a little—tall, I mean—goose, as to hate the\r\nPyramids, Rosa?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you should hear Miss Twinkleton,” often nodding her head, and much\r\nenjoying the Lumps, “bore about them, and then you wouldn’t ask.\r\nTiresome old burying-grounds! Isises, and Ibises, and Cheopses, and\r\nPharaohses; who cares about them? And then there was Belzoni, or\r\nsomebody, dragged out by the legs, half-choked with bats and dust. All\r\nthe girls say: Serve him right, and hope it hurt him, and wish he had\r\nbeen quite choked.”\r\n\r\nThe two youthful figures, side by side, but not now arm-in-arm, wander\r\ndiscontentedly about the old Close; and each sometimes stops and slowly\r\nimprints a deeper footstep in the fallen leaves.\r\n\r\n“Well!” says Edwin, after a lengthy silence. “According to custom. We\r\ncan’t get on, Rosa.”\r\n\r\nRosa tosses her head, and says she don’t want to get on.\r\n\r\n“That’s a pretty sentiment, Rosa, considering.”\r\n\r\n“Considering what?”\r\n\r\n“If I say what, you’ll go wrong again.”\r\n\r\n“_You’ll_ go wrong, you mean, Eddy. Don’t be ungenerous.”\r\n\r\n“Ungenerous! I like that!”\r\n\r\n“Then I _don’t_ like that, and so I tell you plainly,” Rosa pouts.\r\n\r\n“Now, Rosa, I put it to you. Who disparaged my profession, my\r\ndestination—”\r\n\r\n“You are not going to be buried in the Pyramids, I hope?” she\r\ninterrupts, arching her delicate eyebrows. “You never said you were. If\r\nyou are, why haven’t you mentioned it to me? I can’t find out your\r\nplans by instinct.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Rosa, you know very well what I mean, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“Well then, why did you begin with your detestable red-nosed\r\ngiantesses? And she would, she would, she would, she would, she WOULD\r\npowder it!” cries Rosa, in a little burst of comical contradictory\r\nspleen.\r\n\r\n“Somehow or other, I never can come right in these discussions,” says\r\nEdwin, sighing and becoming resigned.\r\n\r\n“How is it possible, sir, that you ever can come right when you’re\r\nalways wrong? And as to Belzoni, I suppose he’s dead;—I’m sure I hope\r\nhe is—and how can his legs or his chokes concern you?”\r\n\r\n“It is nearly time for your return, Rosa. We have not had a very happy\r\nwalk, have we?”\r\n\r\n“A happy walk? A detestably unhappy walk, sir. If I go up-stairs the\r\nmoment I get in and cry till I can’t take my dancing lesson, you are\r\nresponsible, mind!”\r\n\r\n“Let us be friends, Rosa.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cries Rosa, shaking her head and bursting into real tears, “I\r\nwish we _could_ be friends! It’s because we can’t be friends, that we\r\ntry one another so. I am a young little thing, Eddy, to have an old\r\nheartache; but I really, really have, sometimes. Don’t be angry. I know\r\nyou have one yourself too often. We should both of us have done better,\r\nif What is to be had been left What might have been. I am quite a\r\nlittle serious thing now, and not teasing you. Let each of us forbear,\r\nthis one time, on our own account, and on the other’s!”\r\n\r\nDisarmed by this glimpse of a woman’s nature in the spoilt child,\r\nthough for an instant disposed to resent it as seeming to involve the\r\nenforced infliction of himself upon her, Edwin Drood stands watching\r\nher as she childishly cries and sobs, with both hands to the\r\nhandkerchief at her eyes, and then—she becoming more composed, and\r\nindeed beginning in her young inconstancy to laugh at herself for\r\nhaving been so moved—leads her to a seat hard by, under the elm-trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Under the trees]\r\n\r\n\r\n“One clear word of understanding, Pussy dear. I am not clever out of my\r\nown line—now I come to think of it, I don’t know that I am particularly\r\nclever in it—but I want to do right. There is not—there may be—I really\r\ndon’t see my way to what I want to say, but I must say it before we\r\npart—there is not any other young—”\r\n\r\n“O no, Eddy! It’s generous of you to ask me; but no, no, no!”\r\n\r\nThey have come very near to the Cathedral windows, and at this moment\r\nthe organ and the choir sound out sublimely. As they sit listening to\r\nthe solemn swell, the confidence of last night rises in young Edwin\r\nDrood’s mind, and he thinks how unlike this music is to that\r\ndiscordance.\r\n\r\n“I fancy I can distinguish Jack’s voice,” is his remark in a low tone\r\nin connection with the train of thought.\r\n\r\n“Take me back at once, please,” urges his Affianced, quickly laying her\r\nlight hand upon his wrist. “They will all be coming out directly; let\r\nus get away. O, what a resounding chord! But don’t let us stop to\r\nlisten to it; let us get away!”\r\n\r\nHer hurry is over as soon as they have passed out of the Close. They go\r\narm-in-arm now, gravely and deliberately enough, along the old\r\nHigh-street, to the Nuns’ House. At the gate, the street being within\r\nsight empty, Edwin bends down his face to Rosebud’s.\r\n\r\nShe remonstrates, laughing, and is a childish schoolgirl again.\r\n\r\n“Eddy, no! I’m too sticky to be kissed. But give me your hand, and I’ll\r\nblow a kiss into that.”\r\n\r\nHe does so. She breathes a light breath into it and asks, retaining it\r\nand looking into it:—\r\n\r\n“Now say, what do you see?”\r\n\r\n“See, Rosa?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I thought you Egyptian boys could look into a hand and see all\r\nsorts of phantoms. Can’t you see a happy Future?”\r\n\r\nFor certain, neither of them sees a happy Present, as the gate opens\r\nand closes, and one goes in, and the other goes away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nMR. SAPSEA\r\n\r\n\r\nAccepting the Jackass as the type of self-sufficient stupidity and\r\nconceit—a custom, perhaps, like some few other customs, more\r\nconventional than fair—then the purest jackass in Cloisterham is Mr.\r\nThomas Sapsea, Auctioneer.\r\n\r\nMr. Sapsea “dresses at” the Dean; has been bowed to for the Dean, in\r\nmistake; has even been spoken to in the street as My Lord, under the\r\nimpression that he was the Bishop come down unexpectedly, without his\r\nchaplain. Mr. Sapsea is very proud of this, and of his voice, and of\r\nhis style. He has even (in selling landed property) tried the\r\nexperiment of slightly intoning in his pulpit, to make himself more\r\nlike what he takes to be the genuine ecclesiastical article. So, in\r\nending a Sale by Public Auction, Mr. Sapsea finishes off with an air of\r\nbestowing a benediction on the assembled brokers, which leaves the real\r\nDean—a modest and worthy gentleman—far behind.\r\n\r\nMr. Sapsea has many admirers; indeed, the proposition is carried by a\r\nlarge local majority, even including non-believers in his wisdom, that\r\nhe is a credit to Cloisterham. He possesses the great qualities of\r\nbeing portentous and dull, and of having a roll in his speech, and\r\nanother roll in his gait; not to mention a certain gravely flowing\r\naction with his hands, as if he were presently going to Confirm the\r\nindividual with whom he holds discourse. Much nearer sixty years of age\r\nthan fifty, with a flowing outline of stomach, and horizontal creases\r\nin his waistcoat; reputed to be rich; voting at elections in the\r\nstrictly respectable interest; morally satisfied that nothing but he\r\nhimself has grown since he was a baby; how can dunder-headed Mr. Sapsea\r\nbe otherwise than a credit to Cloisterham, and society?\r\n\r\nMr. Sapsea’s premises are in the High-street, over against the Nuns’\r\nHouse. They are of about the period of the Nuns’ House, irregularly\r\nmodernised here and there, as steadily deteriorating generations found,\r\nmore and more, that they preferred air and light to Fever and the\r\nPlague. Over the doorway is a wooden effigy, about half life-size,\r\nrepresenting Mr. Sapsea’s father, in a curly wig and toga, in the act\r\nof selling. The chastity of the idea, and the natural appearance of the\r\nlittle finger, hammer, and pulpit, have been much admired.\r\n\r\nMr. Sapsea sits in his dull ground-floor sitting-room, giving first on\r\nhis paved back yard; and then on his railed-off garden. Mr. Sapsea has\r\na bottle of port wine on a table before the fire—the fire is an early\r\nluxury, but pleasant on the cool, chilly autumn evening—and is\r\ncharacteristically attended by his portrait, his eight-day clock, and\r\nhis weather-glass. Characteristically, because he would uphold himself\r\nagainst mankind, his weather-glass against weather, and his clock\r\nagainst time.\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Sapsea’s side on the table are a writing-desk and writing\r\nmaterials. Glancing at a scrap of manuscript, Mr. Sapsea reads it to\r\nhimself with a lofty air, and then, slowly pacing the room with his\r\nthumbs in the arm-holes of his waistcoat, repeats it from memory: so\r\ninternally, though with much dignity, that the word “Ethelinda” is\r\nalone audible.\r\n\r\nThere are three clean wineglasses in a tray on the table. His\r\nserving-maid entering, and announcing “Mr. Jasper is come, sir,” Mr.\r\nSapsea waves “Admit him,” and draws two wineglasses from the rank, as\r\nbeing claimed.\r\n\r\n“Glad to see you, sir. I congratulate myself on having the honour of\r\nreceiving you here for the first time.” Mr. Sapsea does the honours of\r\nhis house in this wise.\r\n\r\n“You are very good. The honour is mine and the self-congratulation is\r\nmine.”\r\n\r\n“You are pleased to say so, sir. But I do assure you that it is a\r\nsatisfaction to me to receive you in my humble home. And that is what I\r\nwould not say to everybody.” Ineffable loftiness on Mr. Sapsea’s part\r\naccompanies these words, as leaving the sentence to be understood: “You\r\nwill not easily believe that your society can be a satisfaction to a\r\nman like myself; nevertheless, it is.”\r\n\r\n“I have for some time desired to know you, Mr. Sapsea.”\r\n\r\n“And I, sir, have long known you by reputation as a man of taste. Let\r\nme fill your glass. I will give you, sir,” says Mr. Sapsea, filling his\r\nown:\r\n\r\n“When the French come over,\r\nMay we meet them at Dover!”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a patriotic toast in Mr. Sapsea’s infancy, and he is therefore\r\nfully convinced of its being appropriate to any subsequent era.\r\n\r\n“You can scarcely be ignorant, Mr. Sapsea,” observes Jasper, watching\r\nthe auctioneer with a smile as the latter stretches out his legs before\r\nthe fire, “that you know the world.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” is the chuckling reply, “I think I know something of it;\r\nsomething of it.”\r\n\r\n“Your reputation for that knowledge has always interested and surprised\r\nme, and made me wish to know you. For Cloisterham is a little place.\r\nCooped up in it myself, I know nothing beyond it, and feel it to be a\r\nvery little place.”\r\n\r\n“If I have not gone to foreign countries, young man,” Mr. Sapsea\r\nbegins, and then stops:—“You will excuse me calling you young man, Mr.\r\nJasper? You are much my junior.”\r\n\r\n“By all means.”\r\n\r\n“If I have not gone to foreign countries, young man, foreign countries\r\nhave come to me. They have come to me in the way of business, and I\r\nhave improved upon my opportunities. Put it that I take an inventory,\r\nor make a catalogue. I see a French clock. I never saw him before, in\r\nmy life, but I instantly lay my finger on him and say ‘Paris!’ I see\r\nsome cups and saucers of Chinese make, equally strangers to me\r\npersonally: I put my finger on them, then and there, and I say ‘Pekin,\r\nNankin, and Canton.’ It is the same with Japan, with Egypt, and with\r\nbamboo and sandalwood from the East Indies; I put my finger on them\r\nall. I have put my finger on the North Pole before now, and said ‘Spear\r\nof Esquimaux make, for half a pint of pale sherry!’”\r\n\r\n“Really? A very remarkable way, Mr. Sapsea, of acquiring a knowledge of\r\nmen and things.”\r\n\r\n“I mention it, sir,” Mr. Sapsea rejoins, with unspeakable complacency,\r\n“because, as I say, it don’t do to boast of what you are; but show how\r\nyou came to be it, and then you prove it.”\r\n\r\n“Most interesting. We were to speak of the late Mrs. Sapsea.”\r\n\r\n“We were, sir.” Mr. Sapsea fills both glasses, and takes the decanter\r\ninto safe keeping again. “Before I consult your opinion as a man of\r\ntaste on this little trifle”—holding it up—“which is _but_ a trifle,\r\nand still has required some thought, sir, some little fever of the\r\nbrow, I ought perhaps to describe the character of the late Mrs.\r\nSapsea, now dead three quarters of a year.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper, in the act of yawning behind his wineglass, puts down that\r\nscreen and calls up a look of interest. It is a little impaired in its\r\nexpressiveness by his having a shut-up gape still to dispose of, with\r\nwatering eyes.\r\n\r\n“Half a dozen years ago, or so,” Mr. Sapsea proceeds, “when I had\r\nenlarged my mind up to—I will not say to what it now is, for that might\r\nseem to aim at too much, but up to the pitch of wanting another mind to\r\nbe absorbed in it—I cast my eye about me for a nuptial partner.\r\nBecause, as I say, it is not good for man to be alone.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper appears to commit this original idea to memory.\r\n\r\n“Miss Brobity at that time kept, I will not call it the rival\r\nestablishment to the establishment at the Nuns’ House opposite, but I\r\nwill call it the other parallel establishment down town. The world did\r\nhave it that she showed a passion for attending my sales, when they\r\ntook place on half holidays, or in vacation time. The world did put it\r\nabout, that she admired my style. The world did notice that as time\r\nflowed by, my style became traceable in the dictation-exercises of Miss\r\nBrobity’s pupils. Young man, a whisper even sprang up in obscure\r\nmalignity, that one ignorant and besotted Churl (a parent) so committed\r\nhimself as to object to it by name. But I do not believe this. For is\r\nit likely that any human creature in his right senses would so lay\r\nhimself open to be pointed at, by what I call the finger of scorn?”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper shakes his head. Not in the least likely. Mr. Sapsea, in a\r\ngrandiloquent state of absence of mind, seems to refill his visitor’s\r\nglass, which is full already; and does really refill his own, which is\r\nempty.\r\n\r\n“Miss Brobity’s Being, young man, was deeply imbued with homage to\r\nMind. She revered Mind, when launched, or, as I say, precipitated, on\r\nan extensive knowledge of the world. When I made my proposal, she did\r\nme the honour to be so overshadowed with a species of Awe, as to be\r\nable to articulate only the two words, ‘O Thou!’ meaning myself. Her\r\nlimpid blue eyes were fixed upon me, her semi-transparent hands were\r\nclasped together, pallor overspread her aquiline features, and, though\r\nencouraged to proceed, she never did proceed a word further. I disposed\r\nof the parallel establishment by private contract, and we became as\r\nnearly one as could be expected under the circumstances. But she never\r\ncould, and she never did, find a phrase satisfactory to her\r\nperhaps-too-favourable estimate of my intellect. To the very last\r\n(feeble action of liver), she addressed me in the same unfinished\r\nterms.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper has closed his eyes as the auctioneer has deepened his\r\nvoice. He now abruptly opens them, and says, in unison with the\r\ndeepened voice “Ah!”—rather as if stopping himself on the extreme verge\r\nof adding—“men!”\r\n\r\n“I have been since,” says Mr. Sapsea, with his legs stretched out, and\r\nsolemnly enjoying himself with the wine and the fire, “what you behold\r\nme; I have been since a solitary mourner; I have been since, as I say,\r\nwasting my evening conversation on the desert air. I will not say that\r\nI have reproached myself; but there have been times when I have asked\r\nmyself the question: What if her husband had been nearer on a level\r\nwith her? If she had not had to look up quite so high, what might the\r\nstimulating action have been upon the liver?”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper says, with an appearance of having fallen into dreadfully\r\nlow spirits, that he “supposes it was to be.”\r\n\r\n“We can only suppose so, sir,” Mr. Sapsea coincides. “As I say, Man\r\nproposes, Heaven disposes. It may or may not be putting the same\r\nthought in another form; but that is the way I put it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper murmurs assent.\r\n\r\n“And now, Mr. Jasper,” resumes the auctioneer, producing his scrap of\r\nmanuscript, “Mrs. Sapsea’s monument having had full time to settle and\r\ndry, let me take your opinion, as a man of taste, on the inscription I\r\nhave (as I before remarked, not without some little fever of the brow)\r\ndrawn out for it. Take it in your own hand. The setting out of the\r\nlines requires to be followed with the eye, as well as the contents\r\nwith the mind.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper complying, sees and reads as follows:\r\n\r\nETHELINDA,\r\nReverential Wife of\r\nMR. THOMAS SAPSEA,\r\nAUCTIONEER, VALUER, ESTATE AGENT, &c.,\r\nOF THIS CITY.\r\nWhose Knowledge of the World,\r\nThough somewhat extensive,\r\nNever brought him acquainted with\r\nA SPIRIT\r\nMore capable of\r\nLOOKING UP TO HIM.\r\nSTRANGER, PAUSE\r\nAnd ask thyself the Question,\r\nCANST THOU DO LIKEWISE?\r\nIf Not,\r\nWITH A BLUSH RETIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Sapsea having risen and stationed himself with his back to the\r\nfire, for the purpose of observing the effect of these lines on the\r\ncountenance of a man of taste, consequently has his face towards the\r\ndoor, when his serving-maid, again appearing, announces, “Durdles is\r\ncome, sir!” He promptly draws forth and fills the third wineglass, as\r\nbeing now claimed, and replies, “Show Durdles in.”\r\n\r\n“Admirable!” quoth Mr. Jasper, handing back the paper.\r\n\r\n“You approve, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Impossible not to approve. Striking, characteristic, and complete.”\r\n\r\nThe auctioneer inclines his head, as one accepting his due and giving a\r\nreceipt; and invites the entering Durdles to take off that glass of\r\nwine (handing the same), for it will warm him.\r\n\r\nDurdles is a stonemason; chiefly in the gravestone, tomb, and monument\r\nway, and wholly of their colour from head to foot. No man is better\r\nknown in Cloisterham. He is the chartered libertine of the place. Fame\r\ntrumpets him a wonderful workman—which, for aught that anybody knows,\r\nhe may be (as he never works); and a wonderful sot—which everybody\r\nknows he is. With the Cathedral crypt he is better acquainted than any\r\nliving authority; it may even be than any dead one. It is said that the\r\nintimacy of this acquaintance began in his habitually resorting to that\r\nsecret place, to lock-out the Cloisterham boy-populace, and sleep off\r\nfumes of liquor: he having ready access to the Cathedral, as contractor\r\nfor rough repairs. Be this as it may, he does know much about it, and,\r\nin the demolition of impedimental fragments of wall, buttress, and\r\npavement, has seen strange sights. He often speaks of himself in the\r\nthird person; perhaps, being a little misty as to his own identity,\r\nwhen he narrates; perhaps impartially adopting the Cloisterham\r\nnomenclature in reference to a character of acknowledged distinction.\r\nThus he will say, touching his strange sights: “Durdles come upon the\r\nold chap,” in reference to a buried magnate of ancient time and high\r\ndegree, “by striking right into the coffin with his pick. The old chap\r\ngave Durdles a look with his open eyes, as much as to say, ‘Is your\r\nname Durdles? Why, my man, I’ve been waiting for you a devil of a\r\ntime!’ And then he turned to powder.” With a two-foot rule always in\r\nhis pocket, and a mason’s hammer all but always in his hand, Durdles\r\ngoes continually sounding and tapping all about and about the\r\nCathedral; and whenever he says to Tope: “Tope, here’s another old ’un\r\nin here!” Tope announces it to the Dean as an established discovery.\r\n\r\nIn a suit of coarse flannel with horn buttons, a yellow neckerchief\r\nwith draggled ends, an old hat more russet-coloured than black, and\r\nlaced boots of the hue of his stony calling, Durdles leads a hazy,\r\ngipsy sort of life, carrying his dinner about with him in a small\r\nbundle, and sitting on all manner of tombstones to dine. This dinner of\r\nDurdles’s has become quite a Cloisterham institution: not only because\r\nof his never appearing in public without it, but because of its having\r\nbeen, on certain renowned occasions, taken into custody along with\r\nDurdles (as drunk and incapable), and exhibited before the Bench of\r\njustices at the townhall. These occasions, however, have been few and\r\nfar apart: Durdles being as seldom drunk as sober. For the rest, he is\r\nan old bachelor, and he lives in a little antiquated hole of a house\r\nthat was never finished: supposed to be built, so far, of stones stolen\r\nfrom the city wall. To this abode there is an approach, ankle-deep in\r\nstone chips, resembling a petrified grove of tombstones, urns,\r\ndraperies, and broken columns, in all stages of sculpture. Herein two\r\njourneymen incessantly chip, while other two journeymen, who face each\r\nother, incessantly saw stone; dipping as regularly in and out of their\r\nsheltering sentry-boxes, as if they were mechanical figures\r\nemblematical of Time and Death.\r\n\r\nTo Durdles, when he had consumed his glass of port, Mr. Sapsea intrusts\r\nthat precious effort of his Muse. Durdles unfeelingly takes out his\r\ntwo-foot rule, and measures the lines calmly, alloying them with\r\nstone-grit.\r\n\r\n“This is for the monument, is it, Mr. Sapsea?”\r\n\r\n“The Inscription. Yes.” Mr. Sapsea waits for its effect on a common\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n“It’ll come in to a eighth of a inch,” says Durdles. “Your servant, Mr.\r\nJasper. Hope I see you well.”\r\n\r\n“How are you Durdles?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a touch of the Tombatism on me, Mr. Jasper, but that I must\r\nexpect.”\r\n\r\n“You mean the Rheumatism,” says Sapsea, in a sharp tone. (He is nettled\r\nby having his composition so mechanically received.)\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t. I mean, Mr. Sapsea, the Tombatism. It’s another sort from\r\nRheumatism. Mr. Jasper knows what Durdles means. You get among them\r\nTombs afore it’s well light on a winter morning, and keep on, as the\r\nCatechism says, a-walking in the same all the days of your life, and\r\n_you’ll_ know what Durdles means.”\r\n\r\n“It is a bitter cold place,” Mr. Jasper assents, with an antipathetic\r\nshiver.\r\n\r\n“And if it’s bitter cold for you, up in the chancel, with a lot of live\r\nbreath smoking out about you, what the bitterness is to Durdles, down\r\nin the crypt among the earthy damps there, and the dead breath of the\r\nold ’uns,” returns that individual, “Durdles leaves you to judge.—Is\r\nthis to be put in hand at once, Mr. Sapsea?”\r\n\r\nMr. Sapsea, with an Author’s anxiety to rush into publication, replies\r\nthat it cannot be out of hand too soon.\r\n\r\n“You had better let me have the key then,” says Durdles.\r\n\r\n“Why, man, it is not to be put inside the monument!”\r\n\r\n“Durdles knows where it’s to be put, Mr. Sapsea; no man better. Ask\r\n’ere a man in Cloisterham whether Durdles knows his work.”\r\n\r\nMr. Sapsea rises, takes a key from a drawer, unlocks an iron safe let\r\ninto the wall, and takes from it another key.\r\n\r\n“When Durdles puts a touch or a finish upon his work, no matter where,\r\ninside or outside, Durdles likes to look at his work all round, and see\r\nthat his work is a-doing him credit,” Durdles explains, doggedly.\r\n\r\nThe key proffered him by the bereaved widower being a large one, he\r\nslips his two-foot rule into a side-pocket of his flannel trousers made\r\nfor it, and deliberately opens his flannel coat, and opens the mouth of\r\na large breast-pocket within it before taking the key to place it in\r\nthat repository.\r\n\r\n“Why, Durdles!” exclaims Jasper, looking on amused, “you are undermined\r\nwith pockets!”\r\n\r\n“And I carries weight in ’em too, Mr. Jasper. Feel those!” producing\r\ntwo other large keys.\r\n\r\n“Hand me Mr. Sapsea’s likewise. Surely this is the heaviest of the\r\nthree.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll find ’em much of a muchness, I expect,” says Durdles. “They all\r\nbelong to monuments. They all open Durdles’s work. Durdles keeps the\r\nkeys of his work mostly. Not that they’re much used.”\r\n\r\n“By the bye,” it comes into Jasper’s mind to say, as he idly examines\r\nthe keys, “I have been going to ask you, many a day, and have always\r\nforgotten. You know they sometimes call you Stony Durdles, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Cloisterham knows me as Durdles, Mr. Jasper.”\r\n\r\n“I am aware of that, of course. But the boys sometimes—”\r\n\r\n“O! if you mind them young imps of boys—” Durdles gruffly interrupts.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind them any more than you do. But there was a discussion the\r\nother day among the Choir, whether Stony stood for Tony;” clinking one\r\nkey against another.\r\n\r\n(“Take care of the wards, Mr. Jasper.”)\r\n\r\n“Or whether Stony stood for Stephen;” clinking with a change of keys.\r\n\r\n(“You can’t make a pitch pipe of ’em, Mr. Jasper.”)\r\n\r\n“Or whether the name comes from your trade. How stands the fact?”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper weighs the three keys in his hand, lifts his head from his\r\nidly stooping attitude over the fire, and delivers the keys to Durdles\r\nwith an ingenuous and friendly face.\r\n\r\nBut the stony one is a gruff one likewise, and that hazy state of his\r\nis always an uncertain state, highly conscious of its dignity, and\r\nprone to take offence. He drops his two keys back into his pocket one\r\nby one, and buttons them up; he takes his dinner-bundle from the\r\nchair-back on which he hung it when he came in; he distributes the\r\nweight he carries, by tying the third key up in it, as though he were\r\nan Ostrich, and liked to dine off cold iron; and he gets out of the\r\nroom, deigning no word of answer.\r\n\r\nMr. Sapsea then proposes a hit at backgammon, which, seasoned with his\r\nown improving conversation, and terminating in a supper of cold roast\r\nbeef and salad, beguiles the golden evening until pretty late. Mr.\r\nSapsea’s wisdom being, in its delivery to mortals, rather of the\r\ndiffuse than the epigrammatic order, is by no means expended even then;\r\nbut his visitor intimates that he will come back for more of the\r\nprecious commodity on future occasions, and Mr. Sapsea lets him off for\r\nthe present, to ponder on the instalment he carries away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nMR. DURDLES AND FRIEND\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Jasper, on his way home through the Close, is brought to a\r\nstand-still by the spectacle of Stony Durdles, dinner-bundle and all,\r\nleaning his back against the iron railing of the burial-ground\r\nenclosing it from the old cloister-arches; and a hideous small boy in\r\nrags flinging stones at him as a well-defined mark in the moonlight.\r\nSometimes the stones hit him, and sometimes they miss him, but Durdles\r\nseems indifferent to either fortune. The hideous small boy, on the\r\ncontrary, whenever he hits Durdles, blows a whistle of triumph through\r\na jagged gap, convenient for the purpose, in the front of his mouth,\r\nwhere half his teeth are wanting; and whenever he misses him, yelps out\r\n“Mulled agin!” and tries to atone for the failure by taking a more\r\ncorrect and vicious aim.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing to the man?” demands Jasper, stepping out into the\r\nmoonlight from the shade.\r\n\r\n“Making a cock-shy of him,” replies the hideous small boy.\r\n\r\n“Give me those stones in your hand.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’ll give ’em you down your throat, if you come a-ketching hold\r\nof me,” says the small boy, shaking himself loose, and backing. “I’ll\r\nsmash your eye, if you don’t look out!”\r\n\r\n“Baby-Devil that you are, what has the man done to you?”\r\n\r\n“He won’t go home.”\r\n\r\n“What is that to you?”\r\n\r\n“He gives me a ’apenny to pelt him home if I ketches him out too late,”\r\nsays the boy. And then chants, like a little savage, half stumbling and\r\nhalf dancing among the rags and laces of his dilapidated boots:—\r\n\r\n“Widdy widdy wen!\r\nI—ket—ches—Im—out—ar—ter—ten,\r\nWiddy widdy wy!\r\nThen—E—don’t—go—then—I—shy—\r\nWiddy Widdy Wake-cock warning!”\r\n\r\n\r\n—with a comprehensive sweep on the last word, and one more delivery at\r\nDurdles.\r\n\r\nThis would seem to be a poetical note of preparation, agreed upon, as a\r\ncaution to Durdles to stand clear if he can, or to betake himself\r\nhomeward.\r\n\r\nJohn Jasper invites the boy with a beck of his head to follow him\r\n(feeling it hopeless to drag him, or coax him), and crosses to the iron\r\nrailing where the Stony (and stoned) One is profoundly meditating.\r\n\r\n“Do you know this thing, this child?” asks Jasper, at a loss for a word\r\nthat will define this thing.\r\n\r\n“Deputy,” says Durdles, with a nod.\r\n\r\n“Is that its—his—name?”\r\n\r\n“Deputy,” assents Durdles.\r\n\r\n“I’m man-servant up at the Travellers’ Twopenny in Gas Works Garding,”\r\nthis thing explains. “All us man-servants at Travellers’ Lodgings is\r\nnamed Deputy. When we’re chock full and the Travellers is all a-bed I\r\ncome out for my ’elth.” Then withdrawing into the road, and taking aim,\r\nhe resumes:—\r\n\r\n“Widdy widdy wen!\r\nI—ket—ches—Im—out—ar—ter—”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hold your hand,” cries Jasper, “and don’t throw while I stand so near\r\nhim, or I’ll kill you! Come, Durdles; let me walk home with you\r\nto-night. Shall I carry your bundle?”\r\n\r\n“Not on any account,” replies Durdles, adjusting it. “Durdles was\r\nmaking his reflections here when you come up, sir, surrounded by his\r\nworks, like a poplar Author.—Your own brother-in-law;” introducing a\r\nsarcophagus within the railing, white and cold in the moonlight. “Mrs.\r\nSapsea;” introducing the monument of that devoted wife. “Late\r\nIncumbent;” introducing the Reverend Gentleman’s broken column.\r\n“Departed Assessed Taxes;” introducing a vase and towel, standing on\r\nwhat might represent the cake of soap. “Former pastrycook and\r\nMuffin-maker, much respected;” introducing gravestone. “All safe and\r\nsound here, sir, and all Durdles’s work. Of the common folk, that is\r\nmerely bundled up in turf and brambles, the less said the better. A\r\npoor lot, soon forgot.”\r\n\r\n“This creature, Deputy, is behind us,” says Jasper, looking back. “Is\r\nhe to follow us?”\r\n\r\nThe relations between Durdles and Deputy are of a capricious kind; for,\r\non Durdles’s turning himself about with the slow gravity of beery\r\nsuddenness, Deputy makes a pretty wide circuit into the road and stands\r\non the defensive.\r\n\r\n“You never cried Widdy Warning before you begun to-night,” says\r\nDurdles, unexpectedly reminded of, or imagining, an injury.\r\n\r\n“Yer lie, I did,” says Deputy, in his only form of polite\r\ncontradiction.\r\n\r\n“Own brother, sir,” observes Durdles, turning himself about again, and\r\nas unexpectedly forgetting his offence as he had recalled or conceived\r\nit; “own brother to Peter the Wild Boy! But I gave him an object in\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“At which he takes aim?” Mr. Jasper suggests.\r\n\r\n“That’s it, sir,” returns Durdles, quite satisfied; “at which he takes\r\naim. I took him in hand and gave him an object. What was he before? A\r\ndestroyer. What work did he do? Nothing but destruction. What did he\r\nearn by it? Short terms in Cloisterham jail. Not a person, not a piece\r\nof property, not a winder, not a horse, nor a dog, nor a cat, nor a\r\nbird, nor a fowl, nor a pig, but what he stoned, for want of an\r\nenlightened object. I put that enlightened object before him, and now\r\nhe can turn his honest halfpenny by the three penn’orth a week.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder he has no competitors.”\r\n\r\n“He has plenty, Mr. Jasper, but he stones ’em all away. Now, I don’t\r\nknow what this scheme of mine comes to,” pursues Durdles, considering\r\nabout it with the same sodden gravity; “I don’t know what you may\r\nprecisely call it. It ain’t a sort of a—scheme of a—National\r\nEducation?”\r\n\r\n“I should say not,” replies Jasper.\r\n\r\n“I should say not,” assents Durdles; “then we won’t try to give it a\r\nname.”\r\n\r\n“He still keeps behind us,” repeats Jasper, looking over his shoulder;\r\n“is he to follow us?”\r\n\r\n“We can’t help going round by the Travellers’ Twopenny, if we go the\r\nshort way, which is the back way,” Durdles answers, “and we’ll drop him\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nSo they go on; Deputy, as a rear rank one, taking open order, and\r\ninvading the silence of the hour and place by stoning every wall, post,\r\npillar, and other inanimate object, by the deserted way.\r\n\r\n“Is there anything new down in the crypt, Durdles?” asks John Jasper.\r\n\r\n“Anything old, I think you mean,” growls Durdles. “It ain’t a spot for\r\nnovelty.”\r\n\r\n“Any new discovery on your part, I meant.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a old ’un under the seventh pillar on the left as you go down\r\nthe broken steps of the little underground chapel as formerly was; I\r\nmake him out (so fur as I’ve made him out yet) to be one of them old\r\n’uns with a crook. To judge from the size of the passages in the walls,\r\nand of the steps and doors, by which they come and went, them crooks\r\nmust have been a good deal in the way of the old ’uns! Two on ’em\r\nmeeting promiscuous must have hitched one another by the mitre pretty\r\noften, I should say.”\r\n\r\nWithout any endeavour to correct the literality of this opinion, Jasper\r\nsurveys his companion—covered from head to foot with old mortar, lime,\r\nand stone grit—as though he, Jasper, were getting imbued with a\r\nromantic interest in his weird life.\r\n\r\n“Yours is a curious existence.”\r\n\r\nWithout furnishing the least clue to the question, whether he receives\r\nthis as a compliment or as quite the reverse, Durdles gruffly answers:\r\n“Yours is another.”\r\n\r\n“Well! inasmuch as my lot is cast in the same old earthy, chilly,\r\nnever-changing place, Yes. But there is much more mystery and interest\r\nin your connection with the Cathedral than in mine. Indeed, I am\r\nbeginning to have some idea of asking you to take me on as a sort of\r\nstudent, or free ’prentice, under you, and to let me go about with you\r\nsometimes, and see some of these odd nooks in which you pass your\r\ndays.”\r\n\r\nThe Stony One replies, in a general way, “All right. Everybody knows\r\nwhere to find Durdles, when he’s wanted.” Which, if not strictly true,\r\nis approximately so, if taken to express that Durdles may always be\r\nfound in a state of vagabondage somewhere.\r\n\r\n“What I dwell upon most,” says Jasper, pursuing his subject of romantic\r\ninterest, “is the remarkable accuracy with which you would seem to find\r\nout where people are buried.—What is the matter? That bundle is in your\r\nway; let me hold it.”\r\n\r\nDurdles has stopped and backed a little (Deputy, attentive to all his\r\nmovements, immediately skirmishing into the road), and was looking\r\nabout for some ledge or corner to place his bundle on, when thus\r\nrelieved of it.\r\n\r\n“Just you give me my hammer out of that,” says Durdles, “and I’ll show\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nClink, clink. And his hammer is handed him.\r\n\r\n“Now, lookee here. You pitch your note, don’t you, Mr. Jasper?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“So I sound for mine. I take my hammer, and I tap.” (Here he strikes\r\nthe pavement, and the attentive Deputy skirmishes at a rather wider\r\nrange, as supposing that his head may be in requisition.) “I tap, tap,\r\ntap. Solid! I go on tapping. Solid still! Tap again. Holloa! Hollow!\r\nTap again, persevering. Solid in hollow! Tap, tap, tap, to try it\r\nbetter. Solid in hollow; and inside solid, hollow again! There you are!\r\nOld ’un crumbled away in stone coffin, in vault!”\r\n\r\n“Astonishing!”\r\n\r\n“I have even done this,” says Durdles, drawing out his two-foot rule\r\n(Deputy meanwhile skirmishing nearer, as suspecting that Treasure may\r\nbe about to be discovered, which may somehow lead to his own\r\nenrichment, and the delicious treat of the discoverers being hanged by\r\nthe neck, on his evidence, until they are dead). “Say that hammer of\r\nmine’s a wall—my work. Two; four; and two is six,” measuring on the\r\npavement. “Six foot inside that wall is Mrs. Sapsea.”\r\n\r\n“Not really Mrs. Sapsea?”\r\n\r\n“Say Mrs. Sapsea. Her wall’s thicker, but say Mrs. Sapsea. Durdles\r\ntaps, that wall represented by that hammer, and says, after good\r\nsounding: ‘Something betwixt us!’ Sure enough, some rubbish has been\r\nleft in that same six-foot space by Durdles’s men!”\r\n\r\nJasper opines that such accuracy “is a gift.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t have it at a gift,” returns Durdles, by no means receiving\r\nthe observation in good part. “I worked it out for myself. Durdles\r\ncomes by _his_ knowledge through grubbing deep for it, and having it up\r\nby the roots when it don’t want to come.—Holloa you Deputy!”\r\n\r\n“Widdy!” is Deputy’s shrill response, standing off again.\r\n\r\n“Catch that ha’penny. And don’t let me see any more of you to-night,\r\nafter we come to the Travellers’ Twopenny.”\r\n\r\n“Warning!” returns Deputy, having caught the halfpenny, and appearing\r\nby this mystic word to express his assent to the arrangement.\r\n\r\nThey have but to cross what was once the vineyard, belonging to what\r\nwas once the Monastery, to come into the narrow back lane wherein\r\nstands the crazy wooden house of two low stories currently known as the\r\nTravellers’ Twopenny:—a house all warped and distorted, like the morals\r\nof the travellers, with scant remains of a lattice-work porch over the\r\ndoor, and also of a rustic fence before its stamped-out garden; by\r\nreason of the travellers being so bound to the premises by a tender\r\nsentiment (or so fond of having a fire by the roadside in the course of\r\nthe day), that they can never be persuaded or threatened into\r\ndeparture, without violently possessing themselves of some wooden\r\nforget-me-not, and bearing it off.\r\n\r\nThe semblance of an inn is attempted to be given to this wretched place\r\nby fragments of conventional red curtaining in the windows, which rags\r\nare made muddily transparent in the night-season by feeble lights of\r\nrush or cotton dip burning dully in the close air of the inside. As\r\nDurdles and Jasper come near, they are addressed by an inscribed paper\r\nlantern over the door, setting forth the purport of the house. They are\r\nalso addressed by some half-dozen other hideous small boys—whether\r\ntwopenny lodgers or followers or hangers-on of such, who knows!—who, as\r\nif attracted by some carrion-scent of Deputy in the air, start into the\r\nmoonlight, as vultures might gather in the desert, and instantly fall\r\nto stoning him and one another.\r\n\r\n“Stop, you young brutes,” cries Jasper angrily, “and let us go by!”\r\n\r\nThis remonstrance being received with yells and flying stones,\r\naccording to a custom of late years comfortably established among the\r\npolice regulations of our English communities, where Christians are\r\nstoned on all sides, as if the days of Saint Stephen were revived,\r\nDurdles remarks of the young savages, with some point, that “they\r\nhaven’t got an object,” and leads the way down the lane.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the lane, Jasper, hotly enraged, checks his companion\r\nand looks back. All is silent. Next moment, a stone coming rattling at\r\nhis hat, and a distant yell of “Wake-Cock! Warning!” followed by a\r\ncrow, as from some infernally-hatched Chanticleer, apprising him under\r\nwhose victorious fire he stands, he turns the corner into safety, and\r\ntakes Durdles home: Durdles stumbling among the litter of his stony\r\nyard as if he were going to turn head foremost into one of the\r\nunfinished tombs.\r\n\r\nJohn Jasper returns by another way to his gatehouse, and entering\r\nsoftly with his key, finds his fire still burning. He takes from a\r\nlocked press a peculiar-looking pipe, which he fills—but not with\r\ntobacco—and, having adjusted the contents of the bowl, very carefully,\r\nwith a little instrument, ascends an inner staircase of only a few\r\nsteps, leading to two rooms. One of these is his own sleeping chamber:\r\nthe other is his nephew’s. There is a light in each.\r\n\r\nHis nephew lies asleep, calm and untroubled. John Jasper stands looking\r\ndown upon him, his unlighted pipe in his hand, for some time, with a\r\nfixed and deep attention. Then, hushing his footsteps, he passes to his\r\nown room, lights his pipe, and delivers himself to the Spectres it\r\ninvokes at midnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nPHILANTHROPY IN MINOR CANON CORNER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Septimus Crisparkle (Septimus, because six little brother\r\nCrisparkles before him went out, one by one, as they were born, like\r\nsix weak little rushlights, as they were lighted), having broken the\r\nthin morning ice near Cloisterham Weir with his amiable head, much to\r\nthe invigoration of his frame, was now assisting his circulation by\r\nboxing at a looking-glass with great science and prowess. A fresh and\r\nhealthy portrait the looking-glass presented of the Reverend Septimus,\r\nfeinting and dodging with the utmost artfulness, and hitting out from\r\nthe shoulder with the utmost straightness, while his radiant features\r\nteemed with innocence, and soft-hearted benevolence beamed from his\r\nboxing-gloves.\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely breakfast-time yet, for Mrs. Crisparkle—mother, not\r\nwife of the Reverend Septimus—was only just down, and waiting for the\r\nurn. Indeed, the Reverend Septimus left off at this very moment to take\r\nthe pretty old lady’s entering face between his boxing-gloves and kiss\r\nit. Having done so with tenderness, the Reverend Septimus turned to\r\nagain, countering with his left, and putting in his right, in a\r\ntremendous manner.\r\n\r\n“I say, every morning of my life, that you’ll do it at last, Sept,”\r\nremarked the old lady, looking on; “and so you will.”\r\n\r\n“Do what, Ma dear?”\r\n\r\n“Break the pier-glass, or burst a blood-vessel.”\r\n\r\n“Neither, please God, Ma dear. Here’s wind, Ma. Look at this!” In a\r\nconcluding round of great severity, the Reverend Septimus administered\r\nand escaped all sorts of punishment, and wound up by getting the old\r\nlady’s cap into Chancery—such is the technical term used in scientific\r\ncircles by the learned in the Noble Art—with a lightness of touch that\r\nhardly stirred the lightest lavender or cherry riband on it.\r\nMagnanimously releasing the defeated, just in time to get his gloves\r\ninto a drawer and feign to be looking out of window in a contemplative\r\nstate of mind when a servant entered, the Reverend Septimus then gave\r\nplace to the urn and other preparations for breakfast. These completed,\r\nand the two alone again, it was pleasant to see (or would have been, if\r\nthere had been any one to see it, which there never was), the old lady\r\nstanding to say the Lord’s Prayer aloud, and her son, Minor Canon\r\nnevertheless, standing with bent head to hear it, he being within five\r\nyears of forty: much as he had stood to hear the same words from the\r\nsame lips when he was within five months of four.\r\n\r\nWhat is prettier than an old lady—except a young lady—when her eyes are\r\nbright, when her figure is trim and compact, when her face is cheerful\r\nand calm, when her dress is as the dress of a china shepherdess: so\r\ndainty in its colours, so individually assorted to herself, so neatly\r\nmoulded on her? Nothing is prettier, thought the good Minor Canon\r\nfrequently, when taking his seat at table opposite his long-widowed\r\nmother. Her thought at such times may be condensed into the two words\r\nthat oftenest did duty together in all her conversations: “My Sept!”\r\n\r\nThey were a good pair to sit breakfasting together in Minor Canon\r\nCorner, Cloisterham. For Minor Canon Corner was a quiet place in the\r\nshadow of the Cathedral, which the cawing of the rooks, the echoing\r\nfootsteps of rare passers, the sound of the Cathedral bell, or the roll\r\nof the Cathedral organ, seemed to render more quiet than absolute\r\nsilence. Swaggering fighting men had had their centuries of ramping and\r\nraving about Minor Canon Corner, and beaten serfs had had their\r\ncenturies of drudging and dying there, and powerful monks had had their\r\ncenturies of being sometimes useful and sometimes harmful there, and\r\nbehold they were all gone out of Minor Canon Corner, and so much the\r\nbetter. Perhaps one of the highest uses of their ever having been\r\nthere, was, that there might be left behind, that blessed air of\r\ntranquillity which pervaded Minor Canon Corner, and that serenely\r\nromantic state of the mind—productive for the most part of pity and\r\nforbearance—which is engendered by a sorrowful story that is all told,\r\nor a pathetic play that is played out.\r\n\r\nRed-brick walls harmoniously toned down in colour by time,\r\nstrong-rooted ivy, latticed windows, panelled rooms, big oaken beams in\r\nlittle places, and stone-walled gardens where annual fruit yet ripened\r\nupon monkish trees, were the principal surroundings of pretty old Mrs.\r\nCrisparkle and the Reverend Septimus as they sat at breakfast.\r\n\r\n“And what, Ma dear,” inquired the Minor Canon, giving proof of a\r\nwholesome and vigorous appetite, “does the letter say?”\r\n\r\nThe pretty old lady, after reading it, had just laid it down upon the\r\nbreakfast-cloth. She handed it over to her son.\r\n\r\nNow, the old lady was exceedingly proud of her bright eyes being so\r\nclear that she could read writing without spectacles. Her son was also\r\nso proud of the circumstance, and so dutifully bent on her deriving the\r\nutmost possible gratification from it, that he had invented the\r\npretence that he himself could _not_ read writing without spectacles.\r\nTherefore he now assumed a pair, of grave and prodigious proportions,\r\nwhich not only seriously inconvenienced his nose and his breakfast, but\r\nseriously impeded his perusal of the letter. For, he had the eyes of a\r\nmicroscope and a telescope combined, when they were unassisted.\r\n\r\n“It’s from Mr. Honeythunder, of course,” said the old lady, folding her\r\narms.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” assented her son. He then lamely read on:\r\n\r\n“‘Haven of Philanthropy,\r\nChief Offices, London, Wednesday.\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘DEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘I write in the—;’ In the what’s this? What does he write in?”\r\n\r\n“In the chair,” said the old lady.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Septimus took off his spectacles, that he might see her\r\nface, as he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Why, what should he write in?”\r\n\r\n“Bless me, bless me, Sept,” returned the old lady, “you don’t see the\r\ncontext! Give it back to me, my dear.”\r\n\r\nGlad to get his spectacles off (for they always made his eyes water),\r\nher son obeyed: murmuring that his sight for reading manuscript got\r\nworse and worse daily.\r\n\r\n“‘I write,’” his mother went on, reading very perspicuously and\r\nprecisely, “‘from the chair, to which I shall probably be confined for\r\nsome hours.’”\r\n\r\nSeptimus looked at the row of chairs against the wall, with a\r\nhalf-protesting and half-appealing countenance.\r\n\r\n“‘We have,’” the old lady read on with a little extra emphasis, “‘a\r\nmeeting of our Convened Chief Composite Committee of Central and\r\nDistrict Philanthropists, at our Head Haven as above; and it is their\r\nunanimous pleasure that I take the chair.’”\r\n\r\nSeptimus breathed more freely, and muttered: “O! if he comes to _that_,\r\nlet him.”\r\n\r\n“‘Not to lose a day’s post, I take the opportunity of a long report\r\nbeing read, denouncing a public miscreant—’”\r\n\r\n“It is a most extraordinary thing,” interposed the gentle Minor Canon,\r\nlaying down his knife and fork to rub his ear in a vexed manner, “that\r\nthese Philanthropists are always denouncing somebody. And it is another\r\nmost extraordinary thing that they are always so violently flush of\r\nmiscreants!”\r\n\r\n“‘Denouncing a public miscreant—’”—the old lady resumed, “‘to get our\r\nlittle affair of business off my mind. I have spoken with my two wards,\r\nNeville and Helena Landless, on the subject of their defective\r\neducation, and they give in to the plan proposed; as I should have\r\ntaken good care they did, whether they liked it or not.’”\r\n\r\n“And it is another most extraordinary thing,” remarked the Minor Canon\r\nin the same tone as before, “that these philanthropists are so given to\r\nseizing their fellow-creatures by the scruff of the neck, and (as one\r\nmay say) bumping them into the paths of peace.—I beg your pardon, Ma\r\ndear, for interrupting.”\r\n\r\n“‘Therefore, dear Madam, you will please prepare your son, the Rev. Mr.\r\nSeptimus, to expect Neville as an inmate to be read with, on Monday\r\nnext. On the same day Helena will accompany him to Cloisterham, to take\r\nup her quarters at the Nuns’ House, the establishment recommended by\r\nyourself and son jointly. Please likewise to prepare for her reception\r\nand tuition there. The terms in both cases are understood to be exactly\r\nas stated to me in writing by yourself, when I opened a correspondence\r\nwith you on this subject, after the honour of being introduced to you\r\nat your sister’s house in town here. With compliments to the Rev. Mr.\r\nSeptimus, I am, Dear Madam, Your affectionate brother (In\r\nPhilanthropy), LUKE HONEYTHUNDER.’”\r\n\r\n“Well, Ma,” said Septimus, after a little more rubbing of his ear, “we\r\nmust try it. There can be no doubt that we have room for an inmate, and\r\nthat I have time to bestow upon him, and inclination too. I must\r\nconfess to feeling rather glad that he is not Mr. Honeythunder himself.\r\nThough that seems wretchedly prejudiced—does it not?—for I never saw\r\nhim. Is he a large man, Ma?”\r\n\r\n“I should call him a large man, my dear,” the old lady replied after\r\nsome hesitation, “but that his voice is so much larger.”\r\n\r\n“Than himself?”\r\n\r\n“Than anybody.”\r\n\r\n“Hah!” said Septimus. And finished his breakfast as if the flavour of\r\nthe Superior Family Souchong, and also of the ham and toast and eggs,\r\nwere a little on the wane.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crisparkle’s sister, another piece of Dresden china, and matching\r\nher so neatly that they would have made a delightful pair of ornaments\r\nfor the two ends of any capacious old-fashioned chimneypiece, and by\r\nright should never have been seen apart, was the childless wife of a\r\nclergyman holding Corporation preferment in London City. Mr.\r\nHoneythunder in his public character of Professor of Philanthropy had\r\ncome to know Mrs. Crisparkle during the last re-matching of the china\r\nornaments (in other words during her last annual visit to her sister),\r\nafter a public occasion of a philanthropic nature, when certain devoted\r\norphans of tender years had been glutted with plum buns, and plump\r\nbumptiousness. These were all the antecedents known in Minor Canon\r\nCorner of the coming pupils.\r\n\r\n“I am sure you will agree with me, Ma,” said Mr. Crisparkle, after\r\nthinking the matter over, “that the first thing to be done, is, to put\r\nthese young people as much at their ease as possible. There is nothing\r\ndisinterested in the notion, because we cannot be at our ease with them\r\nunless they are at their ease with us. Now, Jasper’s nephew is down\r\nhere at present; and like takes to like, and youth takes to youth. He\r\nis a cordial young fellow, and we will have him to meet the brother and\r\nsister at dinner. That’s three. We can’t think of asking him, without\r\nasking Jasper. That’s four. Add Miss Twinkleton and the fairy bride\r\nthat is to be, and that’s six. Add our two selves, and that’s eight.\r\nWould eight at a friendly dinner at all put you out, Ma?”\r\n\r\n“Nine would, Sept,” returned the old lady, visibly nervous.\r\n\r\n“My dear Ma, I particularise eight.”\r\n\r\n“The exact size of the table and the room, my dear.”\r\n\r\nSo it was settled that way: and when Mr. Crisparkle called with his\r\nmother upon Miss Twinkleton, to arrange for the reception of Miss\r\nHelena Landless at the Nuns’ House, the two other invitations having\r\nreference to that establishment were proffered and accepted. Miss\r\nTwinkleton did, indeed, glance at the globes, as regretting that they\r\nwere not formed to be taken out into society; but became reconciled to\r\nleaving them behind. Instructions were then despatched to the\r\nPhilanthropist for the departure and arrival, in good time for dinner,\r\nof Mr. Neville and Miss Helena; and stock for soup became fragrant in\r\nthe air of Minor Canon Corner.\r\n\r\nIn those days there was no railway to Cloisterham, and Mr. Sapsea said\r\nthere never would be. Mr. Sapsea said more; he said there never should\r\nbe. And yet, marvellous to consider, it has come to pass, in these\r\ndays, that Express Trains don’t think Cloisterham worth stopping at,\r\nbut yell and whirl through it on their larger errands, casting the dust\r\noff their wheels as a testimony against its insignificance. Some remote\r\nfragment of Main Line to somewhere else, there was, which was going to\r\nruin the Money Market if it failed, and Church and State if it\r\nsucceeded, and (of course), the Constitution, whether or no; but even\r\nthat had already so unsettled Cloisterham traffic, that the traffic,\r\ndeserting the high road, came sneaking in from an unprecedented part of\r\nthe country by a back stable-way, for many years labelled at the\r\ncorner: “Beware of the Dog.”\r\n\r\nTo this ignominious avenue of approach, Mr. Crisparkle repaired,\r\nawaiting the arrival of a short, squat omnibus, with a disproportionate\r\nheap of luggage on the roof—like a little Elephant with infinitely too\r\nmuch Castle—which was then the daily service between Cloisterham and\r\nexternal mankind. As this vehicle lumbered up, Mr. Crisparkle could\r\nhardly see anything else of it for a large outside passenger seated on\r\nthe box, with his elbows squared, and his hands on his knees,\r\ncompressing the driver into a most uncomfortably small compass, and\r\nglowering about him with a strongly-marked face.\r\n\r\n“Is this Cloisterham?” demanded the passenger, in a tremendous voice.\r\n\r\n“It is,” replied the driver, rubbing himself as if he ached, after\r\nthrowing the reins to the ostler. “And I never was so glad to see it.”\r\n\r\n“Tell your master to make his box-seat wider, then,” returned the\r\npassenger. “Your master is morally bound—and ought to be legally, under\r\nruinous penalties—to provide for the comfort of his fellow-man.”\r\n\r\nThe driver instituted, with the palms of his hands, a superficial\r\nperquisition into the state of his skeleton; which seemed to make him\r\nanxious.\r\n\r\n“Have I sat upon you?” asked the passenger.\r\n\r\n“You have,” said the driver, as if he didn’t like it at all.\r\n\r\n“Take that card, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“I think I won’t deprive you on it,” returned the driver, casting his\r\neyes over it with no great favour, without taking it. “What’s the good\r\nof it to me?”\r\n\r\n“Be a Member of that Society,” said the passenger.\r\n\r\n“What shall I get by it?” asked the driver.\r\n\r\n“Brotherhood,” returned the passenger, in a ferocious voice.\r\n\r\n“Thankee,” said the driver, very deliberately, as he got down; “my\r\nmother was contented with myself, and so am I. I don’t want no\r\nbrothers.”\r\n\r\n“But you must have them,” replied the passenger, also descending,\r\n“whether you like it or not. I am your brother.”\r\n\r\n“I say!” expostulated the driver, becoming more chafed in temper, “not\r\ntoo fur! The worm _will_, when—”\r\n\r\nBut here, Mr. Crisparkle interposed, remonstrating aside, in a friendly\r\nvoice: “Joe, Joe, Joe! don’t forget yourself, Joe, my good fellow!” and\r\nthen, when Joe peaceably touched his hat, accosting the passenger with:\r\n“Mr. Honeythunder?”\r\n\r\n“That is my name, sir.”\r\n\r\n“My name is Crisparkle.”\r\n\r\n“Reverend Mr. Septimus? Glad to see you, sir. Neville and Helena are\r\ninside. Having a little succumbed of late, under the pressure of my\r\npublic labours, I thought I would take a mouthful of fresh air, and\r\ncome down with them, and return at night. So you are the Reverend Mr.\r\nSeptimus, are you?” surveying him on the whole with disappointment, and\r\ntwisting a double eye-glass by its ribbon, as if he were roasting it,\r\nbut not otherwise using it. “Hah! I expected to see you older, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you will,” was the good-humoured reply.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” demanded Mr. Honeythunder.\r\n\r\n“Only a poor little joke. Not worth repeating.”\r\n\r\n“Joke? Ay; I never see a joke,” Mr. Honeythunder frowningly retorted.\r\n“A joke is wasted upon me, sir. Where are they? Helena and Neville,\r\ncome here! Mr. Crisparkle has come down to meet you.”\r\n\r\nAn unusually handsome lithe young fellow, and an unusually handsome\r\nlithe girl; much alike; both very dark, and very rich in colour; she of\r\nalmost the gipsy type; something untamed about them both; a certain air\r\nupon them of hunter and huntress; yet withal a certain air of being the\r\nobjects of the chase, rather than the followers. Slender, supple, quick\r\nof eye and limb; half shy, half defiant; fierce of look; an indefinable\r\nkind of pause coming and going on their whole expression, both of face\r\nand form, which might be equally likened to the pause before a crouch\r\nor a bound. The rough mental notes made in the first five minutes by\r\nMr. Crisparkle would have read thus, _verbatim_.\r\n\r\nHe invited Mr. Honeythunder to dinner, with a troubled mind (for the\r\ndiscomfiture of the dear old china shepherdess lay heavy on it), and\r\ngave his arm to Helena Landless. Both she and her brother, as they\r\nwalked all together through the ancient streets, took great delight in\r\nwhat he pointed out of the Cathedral and the Monastery ruin, and\r\nwondered—so his notes ran on—much as if they were beautiful barbaric\r\ncaptives brought from some wild tropical dominion. Mr. Honeythunder\r\nwalked in the middle of the road, shouldering the natives out of his\r\nway, and loudly developing a scheme he had, for making a raid on all\r\nthe unemployed persons in the United Kingdom, laying them every one by\r\nthe heels in jail, and forcing them, on pain of prompt extermination,\r\nto become philanthropists.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crisparkle had need of her own share of philanthropy when she\r\nbeheld this very large and very loud excrescence on the little party.\r\nAlways something in the nature of a Boil upon the face of society, Mr.\r\nHoneythunder expanded into an inflammatory Wen in Minor Canon Corner.\r\nThough it was not literally true, as was facetiously charged against\r\nhim by public unbelievers, that he called aloud to his\r\nfellow-creatures: “Curse your souls and bodies, come here and be\r\nblessed!” still his philanthropy was of that gunpowderous sort that the\r\ndifference between it and animosity was hard to determine. You were to\r\nabolish military force, but you were first to bring all commanding\r\nofficers who had done their duty, to trial by court-martial for that\r\noffence, and shoot them. You were to abolish war, but were to make\r\nconverts by making war upon them, and charging them with loving war as\r\nthe apple of their eye. You were to have no capital punishment, but\r\nwere first to sweep off the face of the earth all legislators, jurists,\r\nand judges, who were of the contrary opinion. You were to have\r\nuniversal concord, and were to get it by eliminating all the people who\r\nwouldn’t, or conscientiously couldn’t, be concordant. You were to love\r\nyour brother as yourself, but after an indefinite interval of maligning\r\nhim (very much as if you hated him), and calling him all manner of\r\nnames. Above all things, you were to do nothing in private, or on your\r\nown account. You were to go to the offices of the Haven of\r\nPhilanthropy, and put your name down as a Member and a Professing\r\nPhilanthropist. Then, you were to pay up your subscription, get your\r\ncard of membership and your riband and medal, and were evermore to live\r\nupon a platform, and evermore to say what Mr. Honeythunder said, and\r\nwhat the Treasurer said, and what the sub-Treasurer said, and what the\r\nCommittee said, and what the sub-Committee said, and what the Secretary\r\nsaid, and what the Vice-Secretary said. And this was usually said in\r\nthe unanimously-carried resolution under hand and seal, to the effect:\r\n“That this assembled Body of Professing Philanthropists views, with\r\nindignant scorn and contempt, not unmixed with utter detestation and\r\nloathing abhorrence”—in short, the baseness of all those who do not\r\nbelong to it, and pledges itself to make as many obnoxious statements\r\nas possible about them, without being at all particular as to facts.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was a most doleful breakdown. The philanthropist deranged\r\nthe symmetry of the table, sat himself in the way of the waiting,\r\nblocked up the thoroughfare, and drove Mr. Tope (who assisted the\r\nparlour-maid) to the verge of distraction by passing plates and dishes\r\non, over his own head. Nobody could talk to anybody, because he held\r\nforth to everybody at once, as if the company had no individual\r\nexistence, but were a Meeting. He impounded the Reverend Mr. Septimus,\r\nas an official personage to be addressed, or kind of human peg to hang\r\nhis oratorical hat on, and fell into the exasperating habit, common\r\namong such orators, of impersonating him as a wicked and weak opponent.\r\nThus, he would ask: “And will you, sir, now stultify yourself by\r\ntelling me”—and so forth, when the innocent man had not opened his\r\nlips, nor meant to open them. Or he would say: “Now see, sir, to what a\r\nposition you are reduced. I will leave you no escape. After exhausting\r\nall the resources of fraud and falsehood, during years upon years;\r\nafter exhibiting a combination of dastardly meanness with ensanguined\r\ndaring, such as the world has not often witnessed; you have now the\r\nhypocrisy to bend the knee before the most degraded of mankind, and to\r\nsue and whine and howl for mercy!” Whereat the unfortunate Minor Canon\r\nwould look, in part indignant and in part perplexed; while his worthy\r\nmother sat bridling, with tears in her eyes, and the remainder of the\r\nparty lapsed into a sort of gelatinous state, in which there was no\r\nflavour or solidity, and very little resistance.\r\n\r\nBut the gush of philanthropy that burst forth when the departure of Mr.\r\nHoneythunder began to impend, must have been highly gratifying to the\r\nfeelings of that distinguished man. His coffee was produced, by the\r\nspecial activity of Mr. Tope, a full hour before he wanted it. Mr.\r\nCrisparkle sat with his watch in his hand for about the same period,\r\nlest he should overstay his time. The four young people were unanimous\r\nin believing that the Cathedral clock struck three-quarters, when it\r\nactually struck but one. Miss Twinkleton estimated the distance to the\r\nomnibus at five-and-twenty minutes’ walk, when it was really five. The\r\naffectionate kindness of the whole circle hustled him into his\r\ngreatcoat, and shoved him out into the moonlight, as if he were a\r\nfugitive traitor with whom they sympathised, and a troop of horse were\r\nat the back door. Mr. Crisparkle and his new charge, who took him to\r\nthe omnibus, were so fervent in their apprehensions of his catching\r\ncold, that they shut him up in it instantly and left him, with still\r\nhalf-an-hour to spare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nMORE CONFIDENCES THAN ONE\r\n\r\n\r\n“I know very little of that gentleman, sir,” said Neville to the Minor\r\nCanon as they turned back.\r\n\r\n“You know very little of your guardian?” the Minor Canon repeated.\r\n\r\n“Almost nothing!”\r\n\r\n“How came he—”\r\n\r\n“To _be_ my guardian? I’ll tell you, sir. I suppose you know that we\r\ncome (my sister and I) from Ceylon?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, no.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder at that. We lived with a stepfather there. Our mother died\r\nthere, when we were little children. We have had a wretched existence.\r\nShe made him our guardian, and he was a miserly wretch who grudged us\r\nfood to eat, and clothes to wear. At his death, he passed us over to\r\nthis man; for no better reason that I know of, than his being a friend\r\nor connexion of his, whose name was always in print and catching his\r\nattention.”\r\n\r\n“That was lately, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Quite lately, sir. This stepfather of ours was a cruel brute as well\r\nas a grinding one. It is well he died when he did, or I might have\r\nkilled him.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle stopped short in the moonlight and looked at his hopeful\r\npupil in consternation.\r\n\r\n“I surprise you, sir?” he said, with a quick change to a submissive\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n“You shock me; unspeakably shock me.”\r\n\r\nThe pupil hung his head for a little while, as they walked on, and then\r\nsaid: “You never saw him beat your sister. I have seen him beat mine,\r\nmore than once or twice, and I never forgot it.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” said Mr. Crisparkle, “not even a beloved and beautiful\r\nsister’s tears under dastardly ill-usage;” he became less severe, in\r\nspite of himself, as his indignation rose; “could justify those\r\nhorrible expressions that you used.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry I used them, and especially to you, sir. I beg to recall\r\nthem. But permit me to set you right on one point. You spoke of my\r\nsister’s tears. My sister would have let him tear her to pieces, before\r\nshe would have let him believe that he could make her shed a tear.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle reviewed those mental notes of his, and was neither at\r\nall surprised to hear it, nor at all disposed to question it.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you will think it strange, sir,”—this was said in a hesitating\r\nvoice—“that I should so soon ask you to allow me to confide in you, and\r\nto have the kindness to hear a word or two from me in my defence?”\r\n\r\n“Defence?” Mr. Crisparkle repeated. “You are not on your defence, Mr.\r\nNeville.”\r\n\r\n“I think I am, sir. At least I know I should be, if you were better\r\nacquainted with my character.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Neville,” was the rejoinder. “What if you leave me to find\r\nit out?”\r\n\r\n“Since it is your pleasure, sir,” answered the young man, with a quick\r\nchange in his manner to sullen disappointment: “since it is your\r\npleasure to check me in my impulse, I must submit.”\r\n\r\nThere was that in the tone of this short speech which made the\r\nconscientious man to whom it was addressed uneasy. It hinted to him\r\nthat he might, without meaning it, turn aside a trustfulness beneficial\r\nto a mis-shapen young mind and perhaps to his own power of directing\r\nand improving it. They were within sight of the lights in his windows,\r\nand he stopped.\r\n\r\n“Let us turn back and take a turn or two up and down, Mr. Neville, or\r\nyou may not have time to finish what you wish to say to me. You are\r\nhasty in thinking that I mean to check you. Quite the contrary. I\r\ninvite your confidence.”\r\n\r\n“You have invited it, sir, without knowing it, ever since I came here.\r\nI say ‘ever since,’ as if I had been here a week. The truth is, we came\r\nhere (my sister and I) to quarrel with you, and affront you, and break\r\naway again.”\r\n\r\n“Really?” said Mr. Crisparkle, at a dead loss for anything else to say.\r\n\r\n“You see, we could not know what you were beforehand, sir; could we?”\r\n\r\n“Clearly not,” said Mr. Crisparkle.\r\n\r\n“And having liked no one else with whom we have ever been brought into\r\ncontact, we had made up our minds not to like you.”\r\n\r\n“Really?” said Mr. Crisparkle again.\r\n\r\n“But we do like you, sir, and we see an unmistakable difference between\r\nyour house and your reception of us, and anything else we have ever\r\nknown. This—and my happening to be alone with you—and everything around\r\nus seeming so quiet and peaceful after Mr. Honeythunder’s departure—and\r\nCloisterham being so old and grave and beautiful, with the moon shining\r\non it—these things inclined me to open my heart.”\r\n\r\n“I quite understand, Mr. Neville. And it is salutary to listen to such\r\ninfluences.”\r\n\r\n“In describing my own imperfections, sir, I must ask you not to suppose\r\nthat I am describing my sister’s. She has come out of the disadvantages\r\nof our miserable life, as much better than I am, as that Cathedral\r\ntower is higher than those chimneys.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle in his own breast was not so sure of this.\r\n\r\n“I have had, sir, from my earliest remembrance, to suppress a deadly\r\nand bitter hatred. This has made me secret and revengeful. I have been\r\nalways tyrannically held down by the strong hand. This has driven me,\r\nin my weakness, to the resource of being false and mean. I have been\r\nstinted of education, liberty, money, dress, the very necessaries of\r\nlife, the commonest pleasures of childhood, the commonest possessions\r\nof youth. This has caused me to be utterly wanting in I don’t know what\r\nemotions, or remembrances, or good instincts—I have not even a name for\r\nthe thing, you see!—that you have had to work upon in other young men\r\nto whom you have been accustomed.”\r\n\r\n“This is evidently true. But this is not encouraging,” thought Mr.\r\nCrisparkle as they turned again.\r\n\r\n“And to finish with, sir: I have been brought up among abject and\r\nservile dependents, of an inferior race, and I may easily have\r\ncontracted some affinity with them. Sometimes, I don’t know but that it\r\nmay be a drop of what is tigerish in their blood.”\r\n\r\n“As in the case of that remark just now,” thought Mr. Crisparkle.\r\n\r\n“In a last word of reference to my sister, sir (we are twin children),\r\nyou ought to know, to her honour, that nothing in our misery ever\r\nsubdued her, though it often cowed me. When we ran away from it (we ran\r\naway four times in six years, to be soon brought back and cruelly\r\npunished), the flight was always of her planning and leading. Each time\r\nshe dressed as a boy, and showed the daring of a man. I take it we were\r\nseven years old when we first decamped; but I remember, when I lost the\r\npocket-knife with which she was to have cut her hair short, how\r\ndesperately she tried to tear it out, or bite it off. I have nothing\r\nfurther to say, sir, except that I hope you will bear with me and make\r\nallowance for me.”\r\n\r\n“Of that, Mr. Neville, you may be sure,” returned the Minor Canon. “I\r\ndon’t preach more than I can help, and I will not repay your confidence\r\nwith a sermon. But I entreat you to bear in mind, very seriously and\r\nsteadily, that if I am to do you any good, it can only be with your own\r\nassistance; and that you can only render that, efficiently, by seeking\r\naid from Heaven.”\r\n\r\n“I will try to do my part, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And, Mr. Neville, I will try to do mine. Here is my hand on it. May\r\nGod bless our endeavours!”\r\n\r\nThey were now standing at his house-door, and a cheerful sound of\r\nvoices and laughter was heard within.\r\n\r\n“We will take one more turn before going in,” said Mr. Crisparkle, “for\r\nI want to ask you a question. When you said you were in a changed mind\r\nconcerning me, you spoke, not only for yourself, but for your sister\r\ntoo?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly I did, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, Mr. Neville, but I think you have had no opportunity of\r\ncommunicating with your sister, since I met you. Mr. Honeythunder was\r\nvery eloquent; but perhaps I may venture to say, without ill-nature,\r\nthat he rather monopolised the occasion. May you not have answered for\r\nyour sister without sufficient warrant?”\r\n\r\nNeville shook his head with a proud smile.\r\n\r\n“You don’t know, sir, yet, what a complete understanding can exist\r\nbetween my sister and me, though no spoken word—perhaps hardly as much\r\nas a look—may have passed between us. She not only feels as I have\r\ndescribed, but she very well knows that I am taking this opportunity of\r\nspeaking to you, both for her and for myself.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle looked in his face, with some incredulity; but his face\r\nexpressed such absolute and firm conviction of the truth of what he\r\nsaid, that Mr. Crisparkle looked at the pavement, and mused, until they\r\ncame to his door again.\r\n\r\n“I will ask for one more turn, sir, this time,” said the young man,\r\nwith a rather heightened colour rising in his face. “But for Mr.\r\nHoneythunder’s—I think you called it eloquence, sir?” (somewhat slyly.)\r\n\r\n“I—yes, I called it eloquence,” said Mr. Crisparkle.\r\n\r\n“But for Mr. Honeythunder’s eloquence, I might have had no need to ask\r\nyou what I am going to ask you. This Mr. Edwin Drood, sir: I think\r\nthat’s the name?”\r\n\r\n“Quite correct,” said Mr. Crisparkle. “D-r-double o-d.”\r\n\r\n“Does he—or did he—read with you, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Never, Mr. Neville. He comes here visiting his relation, Mr. Jasper.”\r\n\r\n“Is Miss Bud his relation too, sir?”\r\n\r\n(“Now, why should he ask that, with sudden superciliousness?” thought\r\nMr. Crisparkle.) Then he explained, aloud, what he knew of the little\r\nstory of their betrothal.\r\n\r\n“O! _that’s_ it, is it?” said the young man. “I understand his air of\r\nproprietorship now!”\r\n\r\nThis was said so evidently to himself, or to anybody rather than Mr.\r\nCrisparkle, that the latter instinctively felt as if to notice it would\r\nbe almost tantamount to noticing a passage in a letter which he had\r\nread by chance over the writer’s shoulder. A moment afterwards they\r\nre-entered the house.\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper was seated at the piano as they came into his drawing-room,\r\nand was accompanying Miss Rosebud while she sang. It was a consequence\r\nof his playing the accompaniment without notes, and of her being a\r\nheedless little creature, very apt to go wrong, that he followed her\r\nlips most attentively, with his eyes as well as hands; carefully and\r\nsoftly hinting the key-note from time to time. Standing with an arm\r\ndrawn round her, but with a face far more intent on Mr. Jasper than on\r\nher singing, stood Helena, between whom and her brother an\r\ninstantaneous recognition passed, in which Mr. Crisparkle saw, or\r\nthought he saw, the understanding that had been spoken of, flash out.\r\nMr. Neville then took his admiring station, leaning against the piano,\r\nopposite the singer; Mr. Crisparkle sat down by the china shepherdess;\r\nEdwin Drood gallantly furled and unfurled Miss Twinkleton’s fan; and\r\nthat lady passively claimed that sort of exhibitor’s proprietorship in\r\nthe accomplishment on view, which Mr. Tope, the Verger, daily claimed\r\nin the Cathedral service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: At the piano]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe song went on. It was a sorrowful strain of parting, and the fresh\r\nyoung voice was very plaintive and tender. As Jasper watched the pretty\r\nlips, and ever and again hinted the one note, as though it were a low\r\nwhisper from himself, the voice became less steady, until all at once\r\nthe singer broke into a burst of tears, and shrieked out, with her\r\nhands over her eyes: “I can’t bear this! I am frightened! Take me\r\naway!”\r\n\r\nWith one swift turn of her lithe figure, Helena laid the little beauty\r\non a sofa, as if she had never caught her up. Then, on one knee beside\r\nher, and with one hand upon her rosy mouth, while with the other she\r\nappealed to all the rest, Helena said to them: “It’s nothing; it’s all\r\nover; don’t speak to her for one minute, and she is well!”\r\n\r\nJasper’s hands had, in the same instant, lifted themselves from the\r\nkeys, and were now poised above them, as though he waited to resume. In\r\nthat attitude he yet sat quiet: not even looking round, when all the\r\nrest had changed their places and were reassuring one another.\r\n\r\n“Pussy’s not used to an audience; that’s the fact,” said Edwin Drood.\r\n“She got nervous, and couldn’t hold out. Besides, Jack, you are such a\r\nconscientious master, and require so much, that I believe you make her\r\nafraid of you. No wonder.”\r\n\r\n“No wonder,” repeated Helena.\r\n\r\n“There, Jack, you hear! You would be afraid of him, under similar\r\ncircumstances, wouldn’t you, Miss Landless?”\r\n\r\n“Not under any circumstances,” returned Helena.\r\n\r\nJasper brought down his hands, looked over his shoulder, and begged to\r\nthank Miss Landless for her vindication of his character. Then he fell\r\nto dumbly playing, without striking the notes, while his little pupil\r\nwas taken to an open window for air, and was otherwise petted and\r\nrestored. When she was brought back, his place was empty. “Jack’s gone,\r\nPussy,” Edwin told her. “I am more than half afraid he didn’t like to\r\nbe charged with being the Monster who had frightened you.” But she\r\nanswered never a word, and shivered, as if they had made her a little\r\ntoo cold.\r\n\r\nMiss Twinkleton now opining that indeed these were late hours, Mrs.\r\nCrisparkle, for finding ourselves outside the walls of the Nuns’ House,\r\nand that we who undertook the formation of the future wives and mothers\r\nof England (the last words in a lower voice, as requiring to be\r\ncommunicated in confidence) were really bound (voice coming up again)\r\nto set a better example than one of rakish habits, wrappers were put in\r\nrequisition, and the two young cavaliers volunteered to see the ladies\r\nhome. It was soon done, and the gate of the Nuns’ House closed upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe boarders had retired, and only Mrs. Tisher in solitary vigil\r\nawaited the new pupil. Her bedroom being within Rosa’s, very little\r\nintroduction or explanation was necessary, before she was placed in\r\ncharge of her new friend, and left for the night.\r\n\r\n“This is a blessed relief, my dear,” said Helena. “I have been dreading\r\nall day, that I should be brought to bay at this time.”\r\n\r\n“There are not many of us,” returned Rosa, “and we are good-natured\r\ngirls; at least the others are; I can answer for them.”\r\n\r\n“I can answer for you,” laughed Helena, searching the lovely little\r\nface with her dark, fiery eyes, and tenderly caressing the small\r\nfigure. “You will be a friend to me, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so. But the idea of my being a friend to you seems too absurd,\r\nthough.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“O, I am such a mite of a thing, and you are so womanly and handsome.\r\nYou seem to have resolution and power enough to crush me. I shrink into\r\nnothing by the side of your presence even.”\r\n\r\n“I am a neglected creature, my dear, unacquainted with all\r\naccomplishments, sensitively conscious that I have everything to learn,\r\nand deeply ashamed to own my ignorance.”\r\n\r\n“And yet you acknowledge everything to me!” said Rosa.\r\n\r\n“My pretty one, can I help it? There is a fascination in you.”\r\n\r\n“O! is there though?” pouted Rosa, half in jest and half in earnest.\r\n“What a pity Master Eddy doesn’t feel it more!”\r\n\r\nOf course her relations towards that young gentleman had been already\r\nimparted in Minor Canon Corner.\r\n\r\n“Why, surely he must love you with all his heart!” cried Helena, with\r\nan earnestness that threatened to blaze into ferocity if he didn’t.\r\n\r\n“Eh? O, well, I suppose he does,” said Rosa, pouting again; “I am sure\r\nI have no right to say he doesn’t. Perhaps it’s my fault. Perhaps I am\r\nnot as nice to him as I ought to be. I don’t think I am. But it _is_ so\r\nridiculous!”\r\n\r\nHelena’s eyes demanded what was.\r\n\r\n“_We_ are,” said Rosa, answering as if she had spoken. “We are such a\r\nridiculous couple. And we are always quarrelling.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because we both know we are ridiculous, my dear!” Rosa gave that\r\nanswer as if it were the most conclusive answer in the world.\r\n\r\nHelena’s masterful look was intent upon her face for a few moments, and\r\nthen she impulsively put out both her hands and said:\r\n\r\n“You will be my friend and help me?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, my dear, I will,” replied Rosa, in a tone of affectionate\r\nchildishness that went straight and true to her heart; “I will be as\r\ngood a friend as such a mite of a thing can be to such a noble creature\r\nas you. And be a friend to me, please; I don’t understand myself: and I\r\nwant a friend who can understand me, very much indeed.”\r\n\r\nHelena Landless kissed her, and retaining both her hands said:\r\n\r\n“Who is Mr. Jasper?”\r\n\r\nRosa turned aside her head in answering: “Eddy’s uncle, and my\r\nmusic-master.”\r\n\r\n“You do not love him?”\r\n\r\n“Ugh!” She put her hands up to her face, and shook with fear or horror.\r\n\r\n“You know that he loves you?”\r\n\r\n“O, don’t, don’t, don’t!” cried Rosa, dropping on her knees, and\r\nclinging to her new resource. “Don’t tell me of it! He terrifies me. He\r\nhaunts my thoughts, like a dreadful ghost. I feel that I am never safe\r\nfrom him. I feel as if he could pass in through the wall when he is\r\nspoken of.” She actually did look round, as if she dreaded to see him\r\nstanding in the shadow behind her.\r\n\r\n“Try to tell me more about it, darling.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will, I will. Because you are so strong. But hold me the while,\r\nand stay with me afterwards.”\r\n\r\n“My child! You speak as if he had threatened you in some dark way.”\r\n\r\n“He has never spoken to me about—that. Never.”\r\n\r\n“What has he done?”\r\n\r\n“He has made a slave of me with his looks. He has forced me to\r\nunderstand him, without his saying a word; and he has forced me to keep\r\nsilence, without his uttering a threat. When I play, he never moves his\r\neyes from my hands. When I sing, he never moves his eyes from my lips.\r\nWhen he corrects me, and strikes a note, or a chord, or plays a\r\npassage, he himself is in the sounds, whispering that he pursues me as\r\na lover, and commanding me to keep his secret. I avoid his eyes, but he\r\nforces me to see them without looking at them. Even when a glaze comes\r\nover them (which is sometimes the case), and he seems to wander away\r\ninto a frightful sort of dream in which he threatens most, he obliges\r\nme to know it, and to know that he is sitting close at my side, more\r\nterrible to me than ever.”\r\n\r\n“What is this imagined threatening, pretty one? What is threatened?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I have never even dared to think or wonder what it is.”\r\n\r\n“And was this all, to-night?”\r\n\r\n“This was all; except that to-night when he watched my lips so closely\r\nas I was singing, besides feeling terrified I felt ashamed and\r\npassionately hurt. It was as if he kissed me, and I couldn’t bear it,\r\nbut cried out. You must never breathe this to any one. Eddy is devoted\r\nto him. But you said to-night that you would not be afraid of him,\r\nunder any circumstances, and that gives me—who am so much afraid of\r\nhim—courage to tell only you. Hold me! Stay with me! I am too\r\nfrightened to be left by myself.”\r\n\r\nThe lustrous gipsy-face drooped over the clinging arms and bosom, and\r\nthe wild black hair fell down protectingly over the childish form.\r\nThere was a slumbering gleam of fire in the intense dark eyes, though\r\nthey were then softened with compassion and admiration. Let whomsoever\r\nit most concerned look well to it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nDAGGERS DRAWN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two young men, having seen the damsels, their charges, enter the\r\ncourtyard of the Nuns’ House, and finding themselves coldly stared at\r\nby the brazen door-plate, as if the battered old beau with the glass in\r\nhis eye were insolent, look at one another, look along the perspective\r\nof the moonlit street, and slowly walk away together.\r\n\r\n“Do you stay here long, Mr. Drood?” says Neville.\r\n\r\n“Not this time,” is the careless answer. “I leave for London again,\r\nto-morrow. But I shall be here, off and on, until next Midsummer; then\r\nI shall take my leave of Cloisterham, and England too; for many a long\r\nday, I expect.”\r\n\r\n“Are you going abroad?”\r\n\r\n“Going to wake up Egypt a little,” is the condescending answer.\r\n\r\n“Are you reading?”\r\n\r\n“Reading?” repeats Edwin Drood, with a touch of contempt. “No. Doing,\r\nworking, engineering. My small patrimony was left a part of the capital\r\nof the Firm I am with, by my father, a former partner; and I am a\r\ncharge upon the Firm until I come of age; and then I step into my\r\nmodest share in the concern. Jack—you met him at dinner—is, until then,\r\nmy guardian and trustee.”\r\n\r\n“I heard from Mr. Crisparkle of your other good fortune.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by my other good fortune?”\r\n\r\nNeville has made his remark in a watchfully advancing, and yet furtive\r\nand shy manner, very expressive of that peculiar air already noticed,\r\nof being at once hunter and hunted. Edwin has made his retort with an\r\nabruptness not at all polite. They stop and interchange a rather heated\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n“I hope,” says Neville, “there is no offence, Mr. Drood, in my\r\ninnocently referring to your betrothal?”\r\n\r\n“By George!” cries Edwin, leading on again at a somewhat quicker pace;\r\n“everybody in this chattering old Cloisterham refers to it. I wonder no\r\npublic-house has been set up, with my portrait for the sign of The\r\nBetrothed’s Head. Or Pussy’s portrait. One or the other.”\r\n\r\n“I am not accountable for Mr. Crisparkle’s mentioning the matter to me,\r\nquite openly,” Neville begins.\r\n\r\n“No; that’s true; you are not,” Edwin Drood assents.\r\n\r\n“But,” resumes Neville, “I am accountable for mentioning it to you. And\r\nI did so, on the supposition that you could not fail to be highly proud\r\nof it.”\r\n\r\nNow, there are these two curious touches of human nature working the\r\nsecret springs of this dialogue. Neville Landless is already enough\r\nimpressed by Little Rosebud, to feel indignant that Edwin Drood (far\r\nbelow her) should hold his prize so lightly. Edwin Drood is already\r\nenough impressed by Helena, to feel indignant that Helena’s brother\r\n(far below her) should dispose of him so coolly, and put him out of the\r\nway so entirely.\r\n\r\nHowever, the last remark had better be answered. So, says Edwin:\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, Mr. Neville” (adopting that mode of address from Mr.\r\nCrisparkle), “that what people are proudest of, they usually talk most\r\nabout; I don’t know either, that what they are proudest of, they most\r\nlike other people to talk about. But I live a busy life, and I speak\r\nunder correction by you readers, who ought to know everything, and I\r\ndaresay do.”\r\n\r\nBy this time they had both become savage; Mr. Neville out in the open;\r\nEdwin Drood under the transparent cover of a popular tune, and a stop\r\nnow and then to pretend to admire picturesque effects in the moonlight\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n“It does not seem to me very civil in you,” remarks Neville, at length,\r\n“to reflect upon a stranger who comes here, not having had your\r\nadvantages, to try to make up for lost time. But, to be sure, I was not\r\nbrought up in ‘busy life,’ and my ideas of civility were formed among\r\nHeathens.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, the best civility, whatever kind of people we are brought up\r\namong,” retorts Edwin Drood, “is to mind our own business. If you will\r\nset me that example, I promise to follow it.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know that you take a great deal too much upon yourself?” is the\r\nangry rejoinder, “and that in the part of the world I come from, you\r\nwould be called to account for it?”\r\n\r\n“By whom, for instance?” asks Edwin Drood, coming to a halt, and\r\nsurveying the other with a look of disdain.\r\n\r\nBut, here a startling right hand is laid on Edwin’s shoulder, and\r\nJasper stands between them. For, it would seem that he, too, has\r\nstrolled round by the Nuns’ House, and has come up behind them on the\r\nshadowy side of the road.\r\n\r\n“Ned, Ned, Ned!” he says; “we must have no more of this. I don’t like\r\nthis. I have overheard high words between you two. Remember, my dear\r\nboy, you are almost in the position of host to-night. You belong, as it\r\nwere, to the place, and in a manner represent it towards a stranger.\r\nMr. Neville is a stranger, and you should respect the obligations of\r\nhospitality. And, Mr. Neville,” laying his left hand on the inner\r\nshoulder of that young gentleman, and thus walking on between them,\r\nhand to shoulder on either side: “you will pardon me; but I appeal to\r\nyou to govern your temper too. Now, what is amiss? But why ask! Let\r\nthere be nothing amiss, and the question is superfluous. We are all\r\nthree on a good understanding, are we not?”\r\n\r\nAfter a silent struggle between the two young men who shall speak last,\r\nEdwin Drood strikes in with: “So far as I am concerned, Jack, there is\r\nno anger in me.”\r\n\r\n“Nor in me,” says Neville Landless, though not so freely; or perhaps so\r\ncarelessly. “But if Mr. Drood knew all that lies behind me, far away\r\nfrom here, he might know better how it is that sharp-edged words have\r\nsharp edges to wound me.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” says Jasper, in a soothing manner, “we had better not\r\nqualify our good understanding. We had better not say anything having\r\nthe appearance of a remonstrance or condition; it might not seem\r\ngenerous. Frankly and freely, you see there is no anger in Ned. Frankly\r\nand freely, there is no anger in you, Mr. Neville?”\r\n\r\n“None at all, Mr. Jasper.” Still, not quite so frankly or so freely;\r\nor, be it said once again, not quite so carelessly perhaps.\r\n\r\n“All over then! Now, my bachelor gatehouse is a few yards from here,\r\nand the heater is on the fire, and the wine and glasses are on the\r\ntable, and it is not a stone’s throw from Minor Canon Corner. Ned, you\r\nare up and away to-morrow. We will carry Mr. Neville in with us, to\r\ntake a stirrup-cup.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart, Jack.”\r\n\r\n“And with all mine, Mr. Jasper.” Neville feels it impossible to say\r\nless, but would rather not go. He has an impression upon him that he\r\nhas lost hold of his temper; feels that Edwin Drood’s coolness, so far\r\nfrom being infectious, makes him red-hot.\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper, still walking in the centre, hand to shoulder on either\r\nside, beautifully turns the Refrain of a drinking song, and they all go\r\nup to his rooms. There, the first object visible, when he adds the\r\nlight of a lamp to that of the fire, is the portrait over the\r\nchimneypiece. It is not an object calculated to improve the\r\nunderstanding between the two young men, as rather awkwardly reviving\r\nthe subject of their difference. Accordingly, they both glance at it\r\nconsciously, but say nothing. Jasper, however (who would appear from\r\nhis conduct to have gained but an imperfect clue to the cause of their\r\nlate high words), directly calls attention to it.\r\n\r\n“You recognise that picture, Mr. Neville?” shading the lamp to throw\r\nthe light upon it.\r\n\r\n“I recognise it, but it is far from flattering the original.”\r\n\r\n“O, you are hard upon it! It was done by Ned, who made me a present of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry for that, Mr. Drood.” Neville apologises, with a real\r\nintention to apologise; “if I had known I was in the artist’s\r\npresence—”\r\n\r\n“O, a joke, sir, a mere joke,” Edwin cuts in, with a provoking yawn. “A\r\nlittle humouring of Pussy’s points! I’m going to paint her gravely, one\r\nof these days, if she’s good.”\r\n\r\nThe air of leisurely patronage and indifference with which this is\r\nsaid, as the speaker throws himself back in a chair and clasps his\r\nhands at the back of his head, as a rest for it, is very exasperating\r\nto the excitable and excited Neville. Jasper looks observantly from the\r\none to the other, slightly smiles, and turns his back to mix a jug of\r\nmulled wine at the fire. It seems to require much mixing and\r\ncompounding.\r\n\r\n“I suppose, Mr. Neville,” says Edwin, quick to resent the indignant\r\nprotest against himself in the face of young Landless, which is fully\r\nas visible as the portrait, or the fire, or the lamp: “I suppose that\r\nif you painted the picture of your lady love—”\r\n\r\n“I can’t paint,” is the hasty interruption.\r\n\r\n“That’s your misfortune, and not your fault. You would if you could.\r\nBut if you could, I suppose you would make her (no matter what she was\r\nin reality), Juno, Minerva, Diana, and Venus, all in one. Eh?”\r\n\r\n“I have no lady love, and I can’t say.”\r\n\r\n“If I were to try my hand,” says Edwin, with a boyish boastfulness\r\ngetting up in him, “on a portrait of Miss Landless—in earnest, mind\r\nyou; in earnest—you should see what I could do!”\r\n\r\n“My sister’s consent to sit for it being first got, I suppose? As it\r\nnever will be got, I am afraid I shall never see what you can do. I\r\nmust bear the loss.”\r\n\r\nJasper turns round from the fire, fills a large goblet glass for\r\nNeville, fills a large goblet glass for Edwin, and hands each his own;\r\nthen fills for himself, saying:\r\n\r\n“Come, Mr. Neville, we are to drink to my nephew, Ned. As it is his\r\nfoot that is in the stirrup—metaphorically—our stirrup-cup is to be\r\ndevoted to him. Ned, my dearest fellow, my love!”\r\n\r\nJasper sets the example of nearly emptying his glass, and Neville\r\nfollows it. Edwin Drood says, “Thank you both very much,” and follows\r\nthe double example.\r\n\r\n“Look at him,” cries Jasper, stretching out his hand admiringly and\r\ntenderly, though rallyingly too. “See where he lounges so easily, Mr.\r\nNeville! The world is all before him where to choose. A life of\r\nstirring work and interest, a life of change and excitement, a life of\r\ndomestic ease and love! Look at him!”\r\n\r\nEdwin Drood’s face has become quickly and remarkably flushed with the\r\nwine; so has the face of Neville Landless. Edwin still sits thrown back\r\nin his chair, making that rest of clasped hands for his head.\r\n\r\n“See how little he heeds it all!” Jasper proceeds in a bantering vein.\r\n“It is hardly worth his while to pluck the golden fruit that hangs ripe\r\non the tree for him. And yet consider the contrast, Mr. Neville. You\r\nand I have no prospect of stirring work and interest, or of change and\r\nexcitement, or of domestic ease and love. You and I have no prospect\r\n(unless you are more fortunate than I am, which may easily be), but the\r\ntedious unchanging round of this dull place.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my soul, Jack,” says Edwin, complacently, “I feel quite\r\napologetic for having my way smoothed as you describe. But you know\r\nwhat I know, Jack, and it may not be so very easy as it seems, after\r\nall. May it, Pussy?” To the portrait, with a snap of his thumb and\r\nfinger. “We have got to hit it off yet; haven’t we, Pussy? You know\r\nwhat I mean, Jack.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: On dangerous ground]\r\n\r\n\r\nHis speech has become thick and indistinct. Jasper, quiet and\r\nself-possessed, looks to Neville, as expecting his answer or comment.\r\nWhen Neville speaks, _his_ speech is also thick and indistinct.\r\n\r\n“It might have been better for Mr. Drood to have known some hardships,”\r\nhe says, defiantly.\r\n\r\n“Pray,” retorts Edwin, turning merely his eyes in that direction, “pray\r\nwhy might it have been better for Mr. Drood to have known some\r\nhardships?”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” Jasper assents, with an air of interest; “let us know why?”\r\n\r\n“Because they might have made him more sensible,” says Neville, “of\r\ngood fortune that is not by any means necessarily the result of his own\r\nmerits.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper quickly looks to his nephew for his rejoinder.\r\n\r\n“Have _you_ known hardships, may I ask?” says Edwin Drood, sitting\r\nupright.\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper quickly looks to the other for his retort.\r\n\r\n“I have.”\r\n\r\n“And what have they made you sensible of?”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper’s play of eyes between the two holds good throughout the\r\ndialogue, to the end.\r\n\r\n“I have told you once before to-night.”\r\n\r\n“You have done nothing of the sort.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you I have. That you take a great deal too much upon yourself.”\r\n\r\n“You added something else to that, if I remember?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did say something else.”\r\n\r\n“Say it again.”\r\n\r\n“I said that in the part of the world I come from, you would be called\r\nto account for it.”\r\n\r\n“Only there?” cries Edwin Drood, with a contemptuous laugh. “A long way\r\noff, I believe? Yes; I see! That part of the world is at a safe\r\ndistance.”\r\n\r\n“Say here, then,” rejoins the other, rising in a fury. “Say anywhere!\r\nYour vanity is intolerable, your conceit is beyond endurance; you talk\r\nas if you were some rare and precious prize, instead of a common\r\nboaster. You are a common fellow, and a common boaster.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh, pooh,” says Edwin Drood, equally furious, but more collected;\r\n“how should you know? You may know a black common fellow, or a black\r\ncommon boaster, when you see him (and no doubt you have a large\r\nacquaintance that way); but you are no judge of white men.”\r\n\r\nThis insulting allusion to his dark skin infuriates Neville to that\r\nviolent degree, that he flings the dregs of his wine at Edwin Drood,\r\nand is in the act of flinging the goblet after it, when his arm is\r\ncaught in the nick of time by Jasper.\r\n\r\n“Ned, my dear fellow!” he cries in a loud voice; “I entreat you, I\r\ncommand you, to be still!” There has been a rush of all the three, and\r\na clattering of glasses and overturning of chairs. “Mr. Neville, for\r\nshame! Give this glass to me. Open your hand, sir. I WILL have it!”\r\n\r\nBut Neville throws him off, and pauses for an instant, in a raging\r\npassion, with the goblet yet in his uplifted hand. Then, he dashes it\r\ndown under the grate, with such force that the broken splinters fly out\r\nagain in a shower; and he leaves the house.\r\n\r\nWhen he first emerges into the night air, nothing around him is still\r\nor steady; nothing around him shows like what it is; he only knows that\r\nhe stands with a bare head in the midst of a blood-red whirl, waiting\r\nto be struggled with, and to struggle to the death.\r\n\r\nBut, nothing happening, and the moon looking down upon him as if he\r\nwere dead after a fit of wrath, he holds his steam-hammer beating head\r\nand heart, and staggers away. Then, he becomes half-conscious of having\r\nheard himself bolted and barred out, like a dangerous animal; and\r\nthinks what shall he do?\r\n\r\nSome wildly passionate ideas of the river dissolve under the spell of\r\nthe moonlight on the Cathedral and the graves, and the remembrance of\r\nhis sister, and the thought of what he owes to the good man who has but\r\nthat very day won his confidence and given him his pledge. He repairs\r\nto Minor Canon Corner, and knocks softly at the door.\r\n\r\nIt is Mr. Crisparkle’s custom to sit up last of the early household,\r\nvery softly touching his piano and practising his favourite parts in\r\nconcerted vocal music. The south wind that goes where it lists, by way\r\nof Minor Canon Corner on a still night, is not more subdued than Mr.\r\nCrisparkle at such times, regardful of the slumbers of the china\r\nshepherdess.\r\n\r\nHis knock is immediately answered by Mr. Crisparkle himself. When he\r\nopens the door, candle in hand, his cheerful face falls, and\r\ndisappointed amazement is in it.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Neville! In this disorder! Where have you been?”\r\n\r\n“I have been to Mr. Jasper’s, sir. With his nephew.”\r\n\r\n“Come in.”\r\n\r\nThe Minor Canon props him by the elbow with a strong hand (in a\r\nstrictly scientific manner, worthy of his morning trainings), and turns\r\nhim into his own little book-room, and shuts the door.\r\n\r\n“I have begun ill, sir. I have begun dreadfully ill.”\r\n\r\n“Too true. You are not sober, Mr. Neville.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid I am not, sir, though I can satisfy you at another time\r\nthat I have had a very little indeed to drink, and that it overcame me\r\nin the strangest and most sudden manner.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Neville, Mr. Neville,” says the Minor Canon, shaking his head with\r\na sorrowful smile; “I have heard that said before.”\r\n\r\n“I think—my mind is much confused, but I think—it is equally true of\r\nMr. Jasper’s nephew, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely,” is the dry rejoinder.\r\n\r\n“We quarrelled, sir. He insulted me most grossly. He had heated that\r\ntigerish blood I told you of to-day, before then.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Neville,” rejoins the Minor Canon, mildly, but firmly: “I request\r\nyou not to speak to me with that clenched right hand. Unclench it, if\r\nyou please.”\r\n\r\n“He goaded me, sir,” pursues the young man, instantly obeying, “beyond\r\nmy power of endurance. I cannot say whether or no he meant it at first,\r\nbut he did it. He certainly meant it at last. In short, sir,” with an\r\nirrepressible outburst, “in the passion into which he lashed me, I\r\nwould have cut him down if I could, and I tried to do it.”\r\n\r\n“You have clenched that hand again,” is Mr. Crisparkle’s quiet\r\ncommentary.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You know your room, for I showed it you before dinner; but I will\r\naccompany you to it once more. Your arm, if you please. Softly, for the\r\nhouse is all a-bed.”\r\n\r\nScooping his hand into the same scientific elbow-rest as before, and\r\nbacking it up with the inert strength of his arm, as skilfully as a\r\nPolice Expert, and with an apparent repose quite unattainable by\r\nnovices, Mr. Crisparkle conducts his pupil to the pleasant and orderly\r\nold room prepared for him. Arrived there, the young man throws himself\r\ninto a chair, and, flinging his arms upon his reading-table, rests his\r\nhead upon them with an air of wretched self-reproach.\r\n\r\nThe gentle Minor Canon has had it in his thoughts to leave the room,\r\nwithout a word. But looking round at the door, and seeing this dejected\r\nfigure, he turns back to it, touches it with a mild hand, says “Good\r\nnight!” A sob is his only acknowledgment. He might have had many a\r\nworse; perhaps, could have had few better.\r\n\r\nAnother soft knock at the outer door attracts his attention as he goes\r\ndown-stairs. He opens it to Mr. Jasper, holding in his hand the pupil’s\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n“We have had an awful scene with him,” says Jasper, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Has it been so bad as that?”\r\n\r\n“Murderous!”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle remonstrates: “No, no, no. Do not use such strong\r\nwords.”\r\n\r\n“He might have laid my dear boy dead at my feet. It is no fault of his,\r\nthat he did not. But that I was, through the mercy of God, swift and\r\nstrong with him, he would have cut him down on my hearth.”\r\n\r\nThe phrase smites home. “Ah!” thinks Mr. Crisparkle, “his own words!”\r\n\r\n“Seeing what I have seen to-night, and hearing what I have heard,” adds\r\nJasper, with great earnestness, “I shall never know peace of mind when\r\nthere is danger of those two coming together, with no one else to\r\ninterfere. It was horrible. There is something of the tiger in his dark\r\nblood.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” thinks Mr. Crisparkle, “so he said!”\r\n\r\n“You, my dear sir,” pursues Jasper, taking his hand, “even you, have\r\naccepted a dangerous charge.”\r\n\r\n“You need have no fear for me, Jasper,” returns Mr. Crisparkle, with a\r\nquiet smile. “I have none for myself.”\r\n\r\n“I have none for myself,” returns Jasper, with an emphasis on the last\r\npronoun, “because I am not, nor am I in the way of being, the object of\r\nhis hostility. But you may be, and my dear boy has been. Good night!”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle goes in, with the hat that has so easily, so almost\r\nimperceptibly, acquired the right to be hung up in his hall; hangs it\r\nup; and goes thoughtfully to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nBIRDS IN THE BUSH\r\n\r\n\r\nRosa, having no relation that she knew of in the world, had, from the\r\nseventh year of her age, known no home but the Nuns’ House, and no\r\nmother but Miss Twinkleton. Her remembrance of her own mother was of a\r\npretty little creature like herself (not much older than herself it\r\nseemed to her), who had been brought home in her father’s arms,\r\ndrowned. The fatal accident had happened at a party of pleasure. Every\r\nfold and colour in the pretty summer dress, and even the long wet hair,\r\nwith scattered petals of ruined flowers still clinging to it, as the\r\ndead young figure, in its sad, sad beauty lay upon the bed, were fixed\r\nindelibly in Rosa’s recollection. So were the wild despair and the\r\nsubsequent bowed-down grief of her poor young father, who died\r\nbroken-hearted on the first anniversary of that hard day.\r\n\r\nThe betrothal of Rosa grew out of the soothing of his year of mental\r\ndistress by his fast friend and old college companion, Drood: who\r\nlikewise had been left a widower in his youth. But he, too, went the\r\nsilent road into which all earthly pilgrimages merge, some sooner, and\r\nsome later; and thus the young couple had come to be as they were.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of pity surrounding the little orphan girl when she\r\nfirst came to Cloisterham, had never cleared away. It had taken\r\nbrighter hues as she grew older, happier, prettier; now it had been\r\ngolden, now roseate, and now azure; but it had always adorned her with\r\nsome soft light of its own. The general desire to console and caress\r\nher, had caused her to be treated in the beginning as a child much\r\nyounger than her years; the same desire had caused her to be still\r\npetted when she was a child no longer. Who should be her favourite, who\r\nshould anticipate this or that small present, or do her this or that\r\nsmall service; who should take her home for the holidays; who should\r\nwrite to her the oftenest when they were separated, and whom she would\r\nmost rejoice to see again when they were reunited; even these gentle\r\nrivalries were not without their slight dashes of bitterness in the\r\nNuns’ House. Well for the poor Nuns in their day, if they hid no harder\r\nstrife under their veils and rosaries!\r\n\r\nThus Rosa had grown to be an amiable, giddy, wilful, winning little\r\ncreature; spoilt, in the sense of counting upon kindness from all\r\naround her; but not in the sense of repaying it with indifference.\r\nPossessing an exhaustless well of affection in her nature, its\r\nsparkling waters had freshened and brightened the Nuns’ House for\r\nyears, and yet its depths had never yet been moved: what might betide\r\nwhen that came to pass; what developing changes might fall upon the\r\nheedless head, and light heart, then; remained to be seen.\r\n\r\nBy what means the news that there had been a quarrel between the two\r\nyoung men overnight, involving even some kind of onslaught by Mr.\r\nNeville upon Edwin Drood, got into Miss Twinkleton’s establishment\r\nbefore breakfast, it is impossible to say. Whether it was brought in by\r\nthe birds of the air, or came blowing in with the very air itself, when\r\nthe casement windows were set open; whether the baker brought it\r\nkneaded into the bread, or the milkman delivered it as part of the\r\nadulteration of his milk; or the housemaids, beating the dust out of\r\ntheir mats against the gateposts, received it in exchange deposited on\r\nthe mats by the town atmosphere; certain it is that the news permeated\r\nevery gable of the old building before Miss Twinkleton was down, and\r\nthat Miss Twinkleton herself received it through Mrs. Tisher, while yet\r\nin the act of dressing; or (as she might have expressed the phrase to a\r\nparent or guardian of a mythological turn) of sacrificing to the\r\nGraces.\r\n\r\nMiss Landless’s brother had thrown a bottle at Mr. Edwin Drood.\r\n\r\nMiss Landless’s brother had thrown a knife at Mr. Edwin Drood.\r\n\r\nA knife became suggestive of a fork; and Miss Landless’s brother had\r\nthrown a fork at Mr. Edwin Drood.\r\n\r\nAs in the governing precedence of Peter Piper, alleged to have picked\r\nthe peck of pickled pepper, it was held physically desirable to have\r\nevidence of the existence of the peck of pickled pepper which Peter\r\nPiper was alleged to have picked; so, in this case, it was held\r\npsychologically important to know why Miss Landless’s brother threw a\r\nbottle, knife, or fork—or bottle, knife, _and_ fork—for the cook had\r\nbeen given to understand it was all three—at Mr. Edwin Drood?\r\n\r\nWell, then. Miss Landless’s brother had said he admired Miss Bud. Mr.\r\nEdwin Drood had said to Miss Landless’s brother that he had no business\r\nto admire Miss Bud. Miss Landless’s brother had then “up’d” (this was\r\nthe cook’s exact information) with the bottle, knife, fork, and\r\ndecanter (the decanter now coolly flying at everybody’s head, without\r\nthe least introduction), and thrown them all at Mr. Edwin Drood.\r\n\r\nPoor little Rosa put a forefinger into each of her ears when these\r\nrumours began to circulate, and retired into a corner, beseeching not\r\nto be told any more; but Miss Landless, begging permission of Miss\r\nTwinkleton to go and speak with her brother, and pretty plainly showing\r\nthat she would take it if it were not given, struck out the more\r\ndefinite course of going to Mr. Crisparkle’s for accurate intelligence.\r\n\r\nWhen she came back (being first closeted with Miss Twinkleton, in order\r\nthat anything objectionable in her tidings might be retained by that\r\ndiscreet filter), she imparted to Rosa only, what had taken place;\r\ndwelling with a flushed cheek on the provocation her brother had\r\nreceived, but almost limiting it to that last gross affront as crowning\r\n“some other words between them,” and, out of consideration for her new\r\nfriend, passing lightly over the fact that the other words had\r\noriginated in her lover’s taking things in general so very easily. To\r\nRosa direct, she brought a petition from her brother that she would\r\nforgive him; and, having delivered it with sisterly earnestness, made\r\nan end of the subject.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for Miss Twinkleton to tone down the public mind of the\r\nNuns’ House. That lady, therefore, entering in a stately manner what\r\nplebeians might have called the school-room, but what, in the patrician\r\nlanguage of the head of the Nuns’ House, was euphuistically, not to say\r\nround-aboutedly, denominated “the apartment allotted to study,” and\r\nsaying with a forensic air, “Ladies!” all rose. Mrs. Tisher at the same\r\ntime grouped herself behind her chief, as representing Queen\r\nElizabeth’s first historical female friend at Tilbury fort. Miss\r\nTwinkleton then proceeded to remark that Rumour, Ladies, had been\r\nrepresented by the bard of Avon—needless were it to mention the\r\nimmortal SHAKESPEARE, also called the Swan of his native river, not\r\nimprobably with some reference to the ancient superstition that that\r\nbird of graceful plumage (Miss Jennings will please stand upright) sang\r\nsweetly on the approach of death, for which we have no ornithological\r\nauthority,—Rumour, Ladies, had been represented by that bard—hem!—\r\n\r\n        “who drew\r\nThe celebrated Jew,”\r\n\r\n\r\nas painted full of tongues. Rumour in Cloisterham (Miss Ferdinand will\r\nhonour me with her attention) was no exception to the great limner’s\r\nportrait of Rumour elsewhere. A slight _fracas_ between two young\r\ngentlemen occurring last night within a hundred miles of these peaceful\r\nwalls (Miss Ferdinand, being apparently incorrigible, will have the\r\nkindness to write out this evening, in the original language, the first\r\nfour fables of our vivacious neighbour, Monsieur La Fontaine) had been\r\nvery grossly exaggerated by Rumour’s voice. In the first alarm and\r\nanxiety arising from our sympathy with a sweet young friend, not wholly\r\nto be dissociated from one of the gladiators in the bloodless arena in\r\nquestion (the impropriety of Miss Reynolds’s appearing to stab herself\r\nin the hand with a pin, is far too obvious, and too glaringly\r\nunladylike, to be pointed out), we descended from our maiden elevation\r\nto discuss this uncongenial and this unfit theme. Responsible inquiries\r\nhaving assured us that it was but one of those “airy nothings” pointed\r\nat by the Poet (whose name and date of birth Miss Giggles will supply\r\nwithin half an hour), we would now discard the subject, and concentrate\r\nour minds upon the grateful labours of the day.\r\n\r\nBut the subject so survived all day, nevertheless, that Miss Ferdinand\r\ngot into new trouble by surreptitiously clapping on a paper moustache\r\nat dinner-time, and going through the motions of aiming a water-bottle\r\nat Miss Giggles, who drew a table-spoon in defence.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosa thought of this unlucky quarrel a great deal, and thought of\r\nit with an uncomfortable feeling that she was involved in it, as cause,\r\nor consequence, or what not, through being in a false position\r\naltogether as to her marriage engagement. Never free from such\r\nuneasiness when she was with her affianced husband, it was not likely\r\nthat she would be free from it when they were apart. To-day, too, she\r\nwas cast in upon herself, and deprived of the relief of talking freely\r\nwith her new friend, because the quarrel had been with Helena’s\r\nbrother, and Helena undisguisedly avoided the subject as a delicate and\r\ndifficult one to herself. At this critical time, of all times, Rosa’s\r\nguardian was announced as having come to see her.\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious had been well selected for his trust, as a man of\r\nincorruptible integrity, but certainly for no other appropriate quality\r\ndiscernible on the surface. He was an arid, sandy man, who, if he had\r\nbeen put into a grinding-mill, looked as if he would have ground\r\nimmediately into high-dried snuff. He had a scanty flat crop of hair,\r\nin colour and consistency like some very mangy yellow fur tippet; it\r\nwas so unlike hair, that it must have been a wig, but for the\r\nstupendous improbability of anybody’s voluntarily sporting such a head.\r\nThe little play of feature that his face presented, was cut deep into\r\nit, in a few hard curves that made it more like work; and he had\r\ncertain notches in his forehead, which looked as though Nature had been\r\nabout to touch them into sensibility or refinement, when she had\r\nimpatiently thrown away the chisel, and said: “I really cannot be\r\nworried to finish off this man; let him go as he is.”\r\n\r\nWith too great length of throat at his upper end, and too much\r\nankle-bone and heel at his lower; with an awkward and hesitating\r\nmanner; with a shambling walk; and with what is called a near\r\nsight—which perhaps prevented his observing how much white cotton\r\nstocking he displayed to the public eye, in contrast with his black\r\nsuit—Mr. Grewgious still had some strange capacity in him of making on\r\nthe whole an agreeable impression.\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious was discovered by his ward, much discomfited by being in\r\nMiss Twinkleton’s company in Miss Twinkleton’s own sacred room. Dim\r\nforebodings of being examined in something, and not coming well out of\r\nit, seemed to oppress the poor gentleman when found in these\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n“My dear, how do you do? I am glad to see you. My dear, how much\r\nimproved you are. Permit me to hand you a chair, my dear.”\r\n\r\nMiss Twinkleton rose at her little writing-table, saying, with general\r\nsweetness, as to the polite Universe: “Will you permit me to retire?”\r\n\r\n“By no means, madam, on my account. I beg that you will not move.”\r\n\r\n“I must entreat permission to _move_,” returned Miss Twinkleton,\r\nrepeating the word with a charming grace; “but I will not withdraw,\r\nsince you are so obliging. If I wheel my desk to this corner window,\r\nshall I be in the way?”\r\n\r\n“Madam! In the way!”\r\n\r\n“You are very kind.—Rosa, my dear, you will be under no restraint, I am\r\nsure.”\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Grewgious, left by the fire with Rosa, said again: “My dear,\r\nhow do you do? I am glad to see you, my dear.” And having waited for\r\nher to sit down, sat down himself.\r\n\r\n“My visits,” said Mr. Grewgious, “are, like those of the angels—not\r\nthat I compare myself to an angel.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” said Rosa.\r\n\r\n“Not by any means,” assented Mr. Grewgious. “I merely refer to my\r\nvisits, which are few and far between. The angels are, we know very\r\nwell, up-stairs.”\r\n\r\nMiss Twinkleton looked round with a kind of stiff stare.\r\n\r\n“I refer, my dear,” said Mr. Grewgious, laying his hand on Rosa’s, as\r\nthe possibility thrilled through his frame of his otherwise seeming to\r\ntake the awful liberty of calling Miss Twinkleton my dear; “I refer to\r\nthe other young ladies.”\r\n\r\nMiss Twinkleton resumed her writing.\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious, with a sense of not having managed his opening point\r\nquite as neatly as he might have desired, smoothed his head from back\r\nto front as if he had just dived, and were pressing the water out—this\r\nsmoothing action, however superfluous, was habitual with him—and took a\r\npocket-book from his coat-pocket, and a stump of black-lead pencil from\r\nhis waistcoat-pocket.\r\n\r\n“I made,” he said, turning the leaves: “I made a guiding memorandum or\r\nso—as I usually do, for I have no conversational powers whatever—to\r\nwhich I will, with your permission, my dear, refer. ‘Well and happy.’\r\nTruly. You are well and happy, my dear? You look so.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, sir,” answered Rosa.\r\n\r\n“For which,” said Mr. Grewgious, with a bend of his head towards the\r\ncorner window, “our warmest acknowledgments are due, and I am sure are\r\nrendered, to the maternal kindness and the constant care and\r\nconsideration of the lady whom I have now the honour to see before me.”\r\n\r\nThis point, again, made but a lame departure from Mr. Grewgious, and\r\nnever got to its destination; for, Miss Twinkleton, feeling that the\r\ncourtesies required her to be by this time quite outside the\r\nconversation, was biting the end of her pen, and looking upward, as\r\nwaiting for the descent of an idea from any member of the Celestial\r\nNine who might have one to spare.\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious smoothed his smooth head again, and then made another\r\nreference to his pocket-book; lining out “well and happy,” as disposed\r\nof.\r\n\r\n“‘Pounds, shillings, and pence,’ is my next note. A dry subject for a\r\nyoung lady, but an important subject too. Life is pounds, shillings,\r\nand pence. Death is—” A sudden recollection of the death of her two\r\nparents seemed to stop him, and he said in a softer tone, and evidently\r\ninserting the negative as an after-thought: “Death is _not_ pounds,\r\nshillings, and pence.”\r\n\r\nHis voice was as hard and dry as himself, and Fancy might have ground\r\nit straight, like himself, into high-dried snuff. And yet, through the\r\nvery limited means of expression that he possessed, he seemed to\r\nexpress kindness. If Nature had but finished him off, kindness might\r\nhave been recognisable in his face at this moment. But if the notches\r\nin his forehead wouldn’t fuse together, and if his face would work and\r\ncouldn’t play, what could he do, poor man!\r\n\r\n“‘Pounds, shillings, and pence.’ You find your allowance always\r\nsufficient for your wants, my dear?”\r\n\r\nRosa wanted for nothing, and therefore it was ample.\r\n\r\n“And you are not in debt?”\r\n\r\nRosa laughed at the idea of being in debt. It seemed, to her\r\ninexperience, a comical vagary of the imagination. Mr. Grewgious\r\nstretched his near sight to be sure that this was her view of the case.\r\n“Ah!” he said, as comment, with a furtive glance towards Miss\r\nTwinkleton, and lining out pounds, shillings, and pence: “I spoke of\r\nhaving got among the angels! So I did!”\r\n\r\nRosa felt what his next memorandum would prove to be, and was blushing\r\nand folding a crease in her dress with one embarrassed hand, long\r\nbefore he found it.\r\n\r\n“‘Marriage.’ Hem!” Mr. Grewgious carried his smoothing hand down over\r\nhis eyes and nose, and even chin, before drawing his chair a little\r\nnearer, and speaking a little more confidentially: “I now touch, my\r\ndear, upon the point that is the direct cause of my troubling you with\r\nthe present visit. Otherwise, being a particularly Angular man, I\r\nshould not have intruded here. I am the last man to intrude into a\r\nsphere for which I am so entirely unfitted. I feel, on these premises,\r\nas if I was a bear—with the cramp—in a youthful Cotillon.”\r\n\r\nHis ungainliness gave him enough of the air of his simile to set Rosa\r\noff laughing heartily.\r\n\r\n“It strikes you in the same light,” said Mr. Grewgious, with perfect\r\ncalmness. “Just so. To return to my memorandum. Mr. Edwin has been to\r\nand fro here, as was arranged. You have mentioned that, in your\r\nquarterly letters to me. And you like him, and he likes you.”\r\n\r\n“I _like_ him very much, sir,” rejoined Rosa.\r\n\r\n“So I said, my dear,” returned her guardian, for whose ear the timid\r\nemphasis was much too fine. “Good. And you correspond.”\r\n\r\n“We write to one another,” said Rosa, pouting, as she recalled their\r\nepistolary differences.\r\n\r\n“Such is the meaning that I attach to the word ‘correspond’ in this\r\napplication, my dear,” said Mr. Grewgious. “Good. All goes well, time\r\nworks on, and at this next Christmas-time it will become necessary, as\r\na matter of form, to give the exemplary lady in the corner window, to\r\nwhom we are so much indebted, business notice of your departure in the\r\nensuing half-year. Your relations with her are far more than business\r\nrelations, no doubt; but a residue of business remains in them, and\r\nbusiness is business ever. I am a particularly Angular man,” proceeded\r\nMr. Grewgious, as if it suddenly occurred to him to mention it, “and I\r\nam not used to give anything away. If, for these two reasons, some\r\ncompetent Proxy would give _you_ away, I should take it very kindly.”\r\n\r\nRosa intimated, with her eyes on the ground, that she thought a\r\nsubstitute might be found, if required.\r\n\r\n“Surely, surely,” said Mr. Grewgious. “For instance, the gentleman who\r\nteaches Dancing here—he would know how to do it with graceful\r\npropriety. He would advance and retire in a manner satisfactory to the\r\nfeelings of the officiating clergyman, and of yourself, and the\r\nbridegroom, and all parties concerned. I am—I am a particularly Angular\r\nman,” said Mr. Grewgious, as if he had made up his mind to screw it out\r\nat last: “and should only blunder.”\r\n\r\nRosa sat still and silent. Perhaps her mind had not got quite so far as\r\nthe ceremony yet, but was lagging on the way there.\r\n\r\n“Memorandum, ‘Will.’ Now, my dear,” said Mr. Grewgious, referring to\r\nhis notes, disposing of “Marriage” with his pencil, and taking a paper\r\nfrom his pocket; “although I have before possessed you with the\r\ncontents of your father’s will, I think it right at this time to leave\r\na certified copy of it in your hands. And although Mr. Edwin is also\r\naware of its contents, I think it right at this time likewise to place\r\na certified copy of it in Mr. Jasper’s hand—”\r\n\r\n“Not in his own!” asked Rosa, looking up quickly. “Cannot the copy go\r\nto Eddy himself?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, my dear, if you particularly wish it; but I spoke of Mr.\r\nJasper as being his trustee.”\r\n\r\n“I do particularly wish it, if you please,” said Rosa, hurriedly and\r\nearnestly; “I don’t like Mr. Jasper to come between us, in any way.”\r\n\r\n“It is natural, I suppose,” said Mr. Grewgious, “that your young\r\nhusband should be all in all. Yes. You observe that I say, I suppose.\r\nThe fact is, I am a particularly Unnatural man, and I don’t know from\r\nmy own knowledge.”\r\n\r\nRosa looked at him with some wonder.\r\n\r\n“I mean,” he explained, “that young ways were never my ways. I was the\r\nonly offspring of parents far advanced in life, and I half believe I\r\nwas born advanced in life myself. No personality is intended towards\r\nthe name you will so soon change, when I remark that while the general\r\ngrowth of people seem to have come into existence, buds, I seem to have\r\ncome into existence a chip. I was a chip—and a very dry one—when I\r\nfirst became aware of myself. Respecting the other certified copy, your\r\nwish shall be complied with. Respecting your inheritance, I think you\r\nknow all. It is an annuity of two hundred and fifty pounds. The savings\r\nupon that annuity, and some other items to your credit, all duly\r\ncarried to account, with vouchers, will place you in possession of a\r\nlump-sum of money, rather exceeding Seventeen Hundred Pounds. I am\r\nempowered to advance the cost of your preparations for your marriage\r\nout of that fund. All is told.”\r\n\r\n“Will you please tell me,” said Rosa, taking the paper with a prettily\r\nknitted brow, but not opening it: “whether I am right in what I am\r\ngoing to say? I can understand what you tell me, so very much better\r\nthan what I read in law-writings. My poor papa and Eddy’s father made\r\ntheir agreement together, as very dear and firm and fast friends, in\r\norder that we, too, might be very dear and firm and fast friends after\r\nthem?”\r\n\r\n“Just so.”\r\n\r\n“For the lasting good of both of us, and the lasting happiness of both\r\nof us?”\r\n\r\n“Just so.”\r\n\r\n“That we might be to one another even much more than they had been to\r\none another?”\r\n\r\n“Just so.”\r\n\r\n“It was not bound upon Eddy, and it was not bound upon me, by any\r\nforfeit, in case—”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be agitated, my dear. In the case that it brings tears into your\r\naffectionate eyes even to picture to yourself—in the case of your not\r\nmarrying one another—no, no forfeiture on either side. You would then\r\nhave been my ward until you were of age. No worse would have befallen\r\nyou. Bad enough perhaps!”\r\n\r\n“And Eddy?”\r\n\r\n“He would have come into his partnership derived from his father, and\r\ninto its arrears to his credit (if any), on attaining his majority,\r\njust as now.”\r\n\r\nRosa, with her perplexed face and knitted brow, bit the corner of her\r\nattested copy, as she sat with her head on one side, looking\r\nabstractedly on the floor, and smoothing it with her foot.\r\n\r\n“In short,” said Mr. Grewgious, “this betrothal is a wish, a sentiment,\r\na friendly project, tenderly expressed on both sides. That it was\r\nstrongly felt, and that there was a lively hope that it would prosper,\r\nthere can be no doubt. When you were both children, you began to be\r\naccustomed to it, and it _has_ prospered. But circumstances alter\r\ncases; and I made this visit to-day, partly, indeed principally, to\r\ndischarge myself of the duty of telling you, my dear, that two young\r\npeople can only be betrothed in marriage (except as a matter of\r\nconvenience, and therefore mockery and misery) of their own free will,\r\ntheir own attachment, and their own assurance (it may or it may not\r\nprove a mistaken one, but we must take our chance of that), that they\r\nare suited to each other, and will make each other happy. Is it to be\r\nsupposed, for example, that if either of your fathers were living now,\r\nand had any mistrust on that subject, his mind would not be changed by\r\nthe change of circumstances involved in the change of your years?\r\nUntenable, unreasonable, inconclusive, and preposterous!”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious said all this, as if he were reading it aloud; or, still\r\nmore, as if he were repeating a lesson. So expressionless of any\r\napproach to spontaneity were his face and manner.\r\n\r\n“I have now, my dear,” he added, blurring out “Will” with his pencil,\r\n“discharged myself of what is doubtless a formal duty in this case, but\r\nstill a duty in such a case. Memorandum, ‘Wishes.’ My dear, is there\r\nany wish of yours that I can further?”\r\n\r\nRosa shook her head, with an almost plaintive air of hesitation in want\r\nof help.\r\n\r\n“Is there any instruction that I can take from you with reference to\r\nyour affairs?”\r\n\r\n“I—I should like to settle them with Eddy first, if you please,” said\r\nRosa, plaiting the crease in her dress.\r\n\r\n“Surely, surely,” returned Mr. Grewgious. “You two should be of one\r\nmind in all things. Is the young gentleman expected shortly?”\r\n\r\n“He has gone away only this morning. He will be back at Christmas.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing could happen better. You will, on his return at Christmas,\r\narrange all matters of detail with him; you will then communicate with\r\nme; and I will discharge myself (as a mere business acquaintance) of my\r\nbusiness responsibilities towards the accomplished lady in the corner\r\nwindow. They will accrue at that season.” Blurring pencil once again.\r\n“Memorandum, ‘Leave.’ Yes. I will now, my dear, take my leave.”\r\n\r\n“Could I,” said Rosa, rising, as he jerked out of his chair in his\r\nungainly way: “could I ask you, most kindly to come to me at Christmas,\r\nif I had anything particular to say to you?”\r\n\r\n“Why, certainly, certainly,” he rejoined; apparently—if such a word can\r\nbe used of one who had no apparent lights or shadows about\r\nhim—complimented by the question. “As a particularly Angular man, I do\r\nnot fit smoothly into the social circle, and consequently I have no\r\nother engagement at Christmas-time than to partake, on the\r\ntwenty-fifth, of a boiled turkey and celery sauce with a—with a\r\nparticularly Angular clerk I have the good fortune to possess, whose\r\nfather, being a Norfolk farmer, sends him up (the turkey up), as a\r\npresent to me, from the neighbourhood of Norwich. I should be quite\r\nproud of your wishing to see me, my dear. As a professional Receiver of\r\nrents, so very few people _do_ wish to see me, that the novelty would\r\nbe bracing.”\r\n\r\nFor his ready acquiescence, the grateful Rosa put her hands upon his\r\nshoulders, stood on tiptoe, and instantly kissed him.\r\n\r\n“Lord bless me!” cried Mr. Grewgious. “Thank you, my dear! The honour\r\nis almost equal to the pleasure. Miss Twinkleton, madam, I have had a\r\nmost satisfactory conversation with my ward, and I will now release you\r\nfrom the incumbrance of my presence.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, sir,” rejoined Miss Twinkleton, rising with a gracious\r\ncondescension: “say not incumbrance. Not so, by any means. I cannot\r\npermit you to say so.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, madam. I have read in the newspapers,” said Mr. Grewgious,\r\nstammering a little, “that when a distinguished visitor (not that I am\r\none: far from it) goes to a school (not that this is one: far from it),\r\nhe asks for a holiday, or some sort of grace. It being now the\r\nafternoon in the—College—of which you are the eminent head, the young\r\nladies might gain nothing, except in name, by having the rest of the\r\nday allowed them. But if there is any young lady at all under a cloud,\r\nmight I solicit—”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Mr. Grewgious, Mr. Grewgious!” cried Miss Twinkleton, with a\r\nchastely-rallying forefinger. “O you gentlemen, you gentlemen! Fie for\r\nshame, that you are so hard upon us poor maligned disciplinarians of\r\nour sex, for your sakes! But as Miss Ferdinand is at present weighed\r\ndown by an incubus”—Miss Twinkleton might have said a pen-and-ink-ubus\r\nof writing out Monsieur La Fontaine—“go to her, Rosa my dear, and tell\r\nher the penalty is remitted, in deference to the intercession of your\r\nguardian, Mr. Grewgious.”\r\n\r\nMiss Twinkleton here achieved a curtsey, suggestive of marvels\r\nhappening to her respected legs, and which she came out of nobly, three\r\nyards behind her starting-point.\r\n\r\nAs he held it incumbent upon him to call on Mr. Jasper before leaving\r\nCloisterham, Mr. Grewgious went to the gatehouse, and climbed its\r\npostern stair. But Mr. Jasper’s door being closed, and presenting on a\r\nslip of paper the word “Cathedral,” the fact of its being service-time\r\nwas borne into the mind of Mr. Grewgious. So he descended the stair\r\nagain, and, crossing the Close, paused at the great western\r\nfolding-door of the Cathedral, which stood open on the fine and bright,\r\nthough short-lived, afternoon, for the airing of the place.\r\n\r\n“Dear me,” said Mr. Grewgious, peeping in, “it’s like looking down the\r\nthroat of Old Time.”\r\n\r\nOld Time heaved a mouldy sigh from tomb and arch and vault; and gloomy\r\nshadows began to deepen in corners; and damps began to rise from green\r\npatches of stone; and jewels, cast upon the pavement of the nave from\r\nstained glass by the declining sun, began to perish. Within the\r\ngrill-gate of the chancel, up the steps surmounted loomingly by the\r\nfast-darkening organ, white robes could be dimly seen, and one feeble\r\nvoice, rising and falling in a cracked, monotonous mutter, could at\r\nintervals be faintly heard. In the free outer air, the river, the green\r\npastures, and the brown arable lands, the teeming hills and dales, were\r\nreddened by the sunset: while the distant little windows in windmills\r\nand farm homesteads, shone, patches of bright beaten gold. In the\r\nCathedral, all became gray, murky, and sepulchral, and the cracked\r\nmonotonous mutter went on like a dying voice, until the organ and the\r\nchoir burst forth, and drowned it in a sea of music. Then, the sea\r\nfell, and the dying voice made another feeble effort, and then the sea\r\nrose high, and beat its life out, and lashed the roof, and surged among\r\nthe arches, and pierced the heights of the great tower; and then the\r\nsea was dry, and all was still.\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious had by that time walked to the chancel-steps, where he\r\nmet the living waters coming out.\r\n\r\n“Nothing is the matter?” Thus Jasper accosted him, rather quickly. “You\r\nhave not been sent for?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, not at all. I came down of my own accord. I have been to\r\nmy pretty ward’s, and am now homeward bound again.”\r\n\r\n“You found her thriving?”\r\n\r\n“Blooming indeed. Most blooming. I merely came to tell her, seriously,\r\nwhat a betrothal by deceased parents is.”\r\n\r\n“And what is it—according to your judgment?”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious noticed the whiteness of the lips that asked the\r\nquestion, and put it down to the chilling account of the Cathedral.\r\n\r\n“I merely came to tell her that it could not be considered binding,\r\nagainst any such reason for its dissolution as a want of affection, or\r\nwant of disposition to carry it into effect, on the side of either\r\nparty.”\r\n\r\n“May I ask, had you any especial reason for telling her that?”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious answered somewhat sharply: “The especial reason of doing\r\nmy duty, sir. Simply that.” Then he added: “Come, Mr. Jasper; I know\r\nyour affection for your nephew, and that you are quick to feel on his\r\nbehalf. I assure you that this implies not the least doubt of, or\r\ndisrespect to, your nephew.”\r\n\r\n“You could not,” returned Jasper, with a friendly pressure of his arm,\r\nas they walked on side by side, “speak more handsomely.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious pulled off his hat to smooth his head, and, having\r\nsmoothed it, nodded it contentedly, and put his hat on again.\r\n\r\n“I will wager,” said Jasper, smiling—his lips were still so white that\r\nhe was conscious of it, and bit and moistened them while speaking: “I\r\nwill wager that she hinted no wish to be released from Ned.”\r\n\r\n“And you will win your wager, if you do,” retorted Mr. Grewgious. “We\r\nshould allow some margin for little maidenly delicacies in a young\r\nmotherless creature, under such circumstances, I suppose; it is not in\r\nmy line; what do you think?”\r\n\r\n“There can be no doubt of it.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad you say so. Because,” proceeded Mr. Grewgious, who had all\r\nthis time very knowingly felt his way round to action on his\r\nremembrance of what she had said of Jasper himself: “because she seems\r\nto have some little delicate instinct that all preliminary arrangements\r\nhad best be made between Mr. Edwin Drood and herself, don’t you see?\r\nShe don’t want us, don’t you know?”\r\n\r\nJasper touched himself on the breast, and said, somewhat indistinctly:\r\n“You mean me.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious touched himself on the breast, and said: “I mean us.\r\nTherefore, let them have their little discussions and councils\r\ntogether, when Mr. Edwin Drood comes back here at Christmas; and then\r\nyou and I will step in, and put the final touches to the business.”\r\n\r\n“So, you settled with her that you would come back at Christmas?”\r\nobserved Jasper. “I see! Mr. Grewgious, as you quite fairly said just\r\nnow, there is such an exceptional attachment between my nephew and me,\r\nthat I am more sensitive for the dear, fortunate, happy, happy fellow\r\nthan for myself. But it is only right that the young lady should be\r\nconsidered, as you have pointed out, and that I should accept my cue\r\nfrom you. I accept it. I understand that at Christmas they will\r\ncomplete their preparations for May, and that their marriage will be\r\nput in final train by themselves, and that nothing will remain for us\r\nbut to put ourselves in train also, and have everything ready for our\r\nformal release from our trusts, on Edwin’s birthday.”\r\n\r\n“That is my understanding,” assented Mr. Grewgious, as they shook hands\r\nto part. “God bless them both!”\r\n\r\n“God save them both!” cried Jasper.\r\n\r\n“I said, bless them,” remarked the former, looking back over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“I said, save them,” returned the latter. “Is there any difference?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nSMOOTHING THE WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been often enough remarked that women have a curious power of\r\ndivining the characters of men, which would seem to be innate and\r\ninstinctive; seeing that it is arrived at through no patient process of\r\nreasoning, that it can give no satisfactory or sufficient account of\r\nitself, and that it pronounces in the most confident manner even\r\nagainst accumulated observation on the part of the other sex. But it\r\nhas not been quite so often remarked that this power (fallible, like\r\nevery other human attribute) is for the most part absolutely incapable\r\nof self-revision; and that when it has delivered an adverse opinion\r\nwhich by all human lights is subsequently proved to have failed, it is\r\nundistinguishable from prejudice, in respect of its determination not\r\nto be corrected. Nay, the very possibility of contradiction or\r\ndisproof, however remote, communicates to this feminine judgment from\r\nthe first, in nine cases out of ten, the weakness attendant on the\r\ntestimony of an interested witness; so personally and strongly does the\r\nfair diviner connect herself with her divination.\r\n\r\n“Now, don’t you think, Ma dear,” said the Minor Canon to his mother one\r\nday as she sat at her knitting in his little book-room, “that you are\r\nrather hard on Mr. Neville?”\r\n\r\n“No, I do _not_, Sept,” returned the old lady.\r\n\r\n“Let us discuss it, Ma.”\r\n\r\n“I have no objection to discuss it, Sept. I trust, my dear, I am always\r\nopen to discussion.” There was a vibration in the old lady’s cap, as\r\nthough she internally added: “and I should like to see the discussion\r\nthat would change _my_ mind!”\r\n\r\n“Very good, Ma,” said her conciliatory son. “There is nothing like\r\nbeing open to discussion.”\r\n\r\n“I hope not, my dear,” returned the old lady, evidently shut to it.\r\n\r\n“Well! Mr. Neville, on that unfortunate occasion, commits himself under\r\nprovocation.”\r\n\r\n“And under mulled wine,” added the old lady.\r\n\r\n“I must admit the wine. Though I believe the two young men were much\r\nalike in that regard.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t,” said the old lady.\r\n\r\n“Why not, Ma?”\r\n\r\n“Because I _don’t_,” said the old lady. “Still, I am quite open to\r\ndiscussion.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear Ma, I cannot see how we are to discuss, if you take that\r\nline.”\r\n\r\n“Blame Mr. Neville for it, Sept, and not me,” said the old lady, with\r\nstately severity.\r\n\r\n“My dear Ma! why Mr. Neville?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” said Mrs. Crisparkle, retiring on first principles, “he came\r\nhome intoxicated, and did great discredit to this house, and showed\r\ngreat disrespect to this family.”\r\n\r\n“That is not to be denied, Ma. He was then, and he is now, very sorry\r\nfor it.”\r\n\r\n“But for Mr. Jasper’s well-bred consideration in coming up to me, next\r\nday, after service, in the Nave itself, with his gown still on, and\r\nexpressing his hope that I had not been greatly alarmed or had my rest\r\nviolently broken, I believe I might never have heard of that\r\ndisgraceful transaction,” said the old lady.\r\n\r\n“To be candid, Ma, I think I should have kept it from you if I could:\r\nthough I had not decidedly made up my mind. I was following Jasper out,\r\nto confer with him on the subject, and to consider the expediency of\r\nhis and my jointly hushing the thing up on all accounts, when I found\r\nhim speaking to you. Then it was too late.”\r\n\r\n“Too late, indeed, Sept. He was still as pale as gentlemanly ashes at\r\nwhat had taken place in his rooms overnight.”\r\n\r\n“If I _had_ kept it from you, Ma, you may be sure it would have been\r\nfor your peace and quiet, and for the good of the young men, and in my\r\nbest discharge of my duty according to my lights.”\r\n\r\nThe old lady immediately walked across the room and kissed him: saying,\r\n“Of course, my dear Sept, I am sure of that.”\r\n\r\n“However, it became the town-talk,” said Mr. Crisparkle, rubbing his\r\near, as his mother resumed her seat, and her knitting, “and passed out\r\nof my power.”\r\n\r\n“And I said then, Sept,” returned the old lady, “that I thought ill of\r\nMr. Neville. And I say now, that I think ill of Mr. Neville. And I said\r\nthen, and I say now, that I hope Mr. Neville may come to good, but I\r\ndon’t believe he will.” Here the cap vibrated again considerably.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to hear you say so, Ma—”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to say so, my dear,” interposed the old lady, knitting on\r\nfirmly, “but I can’t help it.”\r\n\r\n“—For,” pursued the Minor Canon, “it is undeniable that Mr. Neville is\r\nexceedingly industrious and attentive, and that he improves apace, and\r\nthat he has—I hope I may say—an attachment to me.”\r\n\r\n“There is no merit in the last article, my dear,” said the old lady,\r\nquickly; “and if he says there is, I think the worse of him for the\r\nboast.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear Ma, he never said there was.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not,” returned the old lady; “still, I don’t see that it\r\ngreatly signifies.”\r\n\r\nThere was no impatience in the pleasant look with which Mr. Crisparkle\r\ncontemplated the pretty old piece of china as it knitted; but there\r\nwas, certainly, a humorous sense of its not being a piece of china to\r\nargue with very closely.\r\n\r\n“Besides, Sept, ask yourself what he would be without his sister. You\r\nknow what an influence she has over him; you know what a capacity she\r\nhas; you know that whatever he reads with you, he reads with her. Give\r\nher her fair share of your praise, and how much do you leave for him?”\r\n\r\nAt these words Mr. Crisparkle fell into a little reverie, in which he\r\nthought of several things. He thought of the times he had seen the\r\nbrother and sister together in deep converse over one of his own old\r\ncollege books; now, in the rimy mornings, when he made those sharpening\r\npilgrimages to Cloisterham Weir; now, in the sombre evenings, when he\r\nfaced the wind at sunset, having climbed his favourite outlook, a\r\nbeetling fragment of monastery ruin; and the two studious figures\r\npassed below him along the margin of the river, in which the town fires\r\nand lights already shone, making the landscape bleaker. He thought how\r\nthe consciousness had stolen upon him that in teaching one, he was\r\nteaching two; and how he had almost insensibly adapted his explanations\r\nto both minds—that with which his own was daily in contact, and that\r\nwhich he only approached through it. He thought of the gossip that had\r\nreached him from the Nuns’ House, to the effect that Helena, whom he\r\nhad mistrusted as so proud and fierce, submitted herself to the\r\nfairy-bride (as he called her), and learnt from her what she knew. He\r\nthought of the picturesque alliance between those two, externally so\r\nvery different. He thought—perhaps most of all—could it be that these\r\nthings were yet but so many weeks old, and had become an integral part\r\nof his life?\r\n\r\nAs, whenever the Reverend Septimus fell a-musing, his good mother took\r\nit to be an infallible sign that he “wanted support,” the blooming old\r\nlady made all haste to the dining-room closet, to produce from it the\r\nsupport embodied in a glass of Constantia and a home-made biscuit. It\r\nwas a most wonderful closet, worthy of Cloisterham and of Minor Canon\r\nCorner. Above it, a portrait of Handel in a flowing wig beamed down at\r\nthe spectator, with a knowing air of being up to the contents of the\r\ncloset, and a musical air of intending to combine all its harmonies in\r\none delicious fugue. No common closet with a vulgar door on hinges,\r\nopenable all at once, and leaving nothing to be disclosed by degrees,\r\nthis rare closet had a lock in mid-air, where two perpendicular slides\r\nmet; the one falling down, and the other pushing up. The upper slide,\r\non being pulled down (leaving the lower a double mystery), revealed\r\ndeep shelves of pickle-jars, jam-pots, tin canisters, spice-boxes, and\r\nagreeably outlandish vessels of blue and white, the luscious lodgings\r\nof preserved tamarinds and ginger. Every benevolent inhabitant of this\r\nretreat had his name inscribed upon his stomach. The pickles, in a\r\nuniform of rich brown double-breasted buttoned coat, and yellow or\r\nsombre drab continuations, announced their portly forms, in printed\r\ncapitals, as Walnut, Gherkin, Onion, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Mixed, and\r\nother members of that noble family. The jams, as being of a less\r\nmasculine temperament, and as wearing curlpapers, announced themselves\r\nin feminine caligraphy, like a soft whisper, to be Raspberry,\r\nGooseberry, Apricot, Plum, Damson, Apple, and Peach. The scene closing\r\non these charmers, and the lower slide ascending, oranges were\r\nrevealed, attended by a mighty japanned sugar-box, to temper their\r\nacerbity if unripe. Home-made biscuits waited at the Court of these\r\nPowers, accompanied by a goodly fragment of plum-cake, and various\r\nslender ladies’ fingers, to be dipped into sweet wine and kissed.\r\nLowest of all, a compact leaden-vault enshrined the sweet wine and a\r\nstock of cordials: whence issued whispers of Seville Orange, Lemon,\r\nAlmond, and Caraway-seed. There was a crowning air upon this closet of\r\nclosets, of having been for ages hummed through by the Cathedral bell\r\nand organ, until those venerable bees had made sublimated honey of\r\neverything in store; and it was always observed that every dipper among\r\nthe shelves (deep, as has been noticed, and swallowing up head,\r\nshoulders, and elbows) came forth again mellow-faced, and seeming to\r\nhave undergone a saccharine transfiguration.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Septimus yielded himself up quite as willing a victim to a\r\nnauseous medicinal herb-closet, also presided over by the china\r\nshepherdess, as to this glorious cupboard. To what amazing infusions of\r\ngentian, peppermint, gilliflower, sage, parsley, thyme, rue, rosemary,\r\nand dandelion, did his courageous stomach submit itself! In what\r\nwonderful wrappers, enclosing layers of dried leaves, would he swathe\r\nhis rosy and contented face, if his mother suspected him of a\r\ntoothache! What botanical blotches would he cheerfully stick upon his\r\ncheek, or forehead, if the dear old lady convicted him of an\r\nimperceptible pimple there! Into this herbaceous penitentiary, situated\r\non an upper staircase-landing: a low and narrow whitewashed cell, where\r\nbunches of dried leaves hung from rusty hooks in the ceiling, and were\r\nspread out upon shelves, in company with portentous bottles: would the\r\nReverend Septimus submissively be led, like the highly popular lamb who\r\nhas so long and unresistingly been led to the slaughter, and there\r\nwould he, unlike that lamb, bore nobody but himself. Not even doing\r\nthat much, so that the old lady were busy and pleased, he would quietly\r\nswallow what was given him, merely taking a corrective dip of hands and\r\nface into the great bowl of dried rose-leaves, and into the other great\r\nbowl of dried lavender, and then would go out, as confident in the\r\nsweetening powers of Cloisterham Weir and a wholesome mind, as Lady\r\nMacbeth was hopeless of those of all the seas that roll.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance the good Minor Canon took his glass of\r\nConstantia with an excellent grace, and, so supported to his mother’s\r\nsatisfaction, applied himself to the remaining duties of the day. In\r\ntheir orderly and punctual progress they brought round Vesper Service\r\nand twilight. The Cathedral being very cold, he set off for a brisk\r\ntrot after service; the trot to end in a charge at his favourite\r\nfragment of ruin, which was to be carried by storm, without a pause for\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nHe carried it in a masterly manner, and, not breathed even then, stood\r\nlooking down upon the river. The river at Cloisterham is sufficiently\r\nnear the sea to throw up oftentimes a quantity of seaweed. An unusual\r\nquantity had come in with the last tide, and this, and the confusion of\r\nthe water, and the restless dipping and flapping of the noisy gulls,\r\nand an angry light out seaward beyond the brown-sailed barges that were\r\nturning black, foreshadowed a stormy night. In his mind he was\r\ncontrasting the wild and noisy sea with the quiet harbour of Minor\r\nCanon Corner, when Helena and Neville Landless passed below him. He had\r\nhad the two together in his thoughts all day, and at once climbed down\r\nto speak to them together. The footing was rough in an uncertain light\r\nfor any tread save that of a good climber; but the Minor Canon was as\r\ngood a climber as most men, and stood beside them before many good\r\nclimbers would have been half-way down.\r\n\r\n“A wild evening, Miss Landless! Do you not find your usual walk with\r\nyour brother too exposed and cold for the time of year? Or at all\r\nevents, when the sun is down, and the weather is driving in from the\r\nsea?”\r\n\r\nHelena thought not. It was their favourite walk. It was very retired.\r\n\r\n“It is very retired,” assented Mr. Crisparkle, laying hold of his\r\nopportunity straightway, and walking on with them. “It is a place of\r\nall others where one can speak without interruption, as I wish to do.\r\nMr. Neville, I believe you tell your sister everything that passes\r\nbetween us?”\r\n\r\n“Everything, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Consequently,” said Mr. Crisparkle, “your sister is aware that I have\r\nrepeatedly urged you to make some kind of apology for that unfortunate\r\noccurrence which befell on the night of your arrival here.” In saying\r\nit he looked to her, and not to him; therefore it was she, and not he,\r\nwho replied:\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I call it unfortunate, Miss Helena,” resumed Mr. Crisparkle,\r\n“forasmuch as it certainly has engendered a prejudice against Neville.\r\nThere is a notion about, that he is a dangerously passionate fellow, of\r\nan uncontrollable and furious temper: he is really avoided as such.”\r\n\r\n“I have no doubt he is, poor fellow,” said Helena, with a look of proud\r\ncompassion at her brother, expressing a deep sense of his being\r\nungenerously treated. “I should be quite sure of it, from your saying\r\nso; but what you tell me is confirmed by suppressed hints and\r\nreferences that I meet with every day.”\r\n\r\n“Now,” Mr. Crisparkle again resumed, in a tone of mild though firm\r\npersuasion, “is not this to be regretted, and ought it not to be\r\namended? These are early days of Neville’s in Cloisterham, and I have\r\nno fear of his outliving such a prejudice, and proving himself to have\r\nbeen misunderstood. But how much wiser to take action at once, than to\r\ntrust to uncertain time! Besides, apart from its being politic, it is\r\nright. For there can be no question that Neville was wrong.”\r\n\r\n“He was provoked,” Helena submitted.\r\n\r\n“He was the assailant,” Mr. Crisparkle submitted.\r\n\r\nThey walked on in silence, until Helena raised her eyes to the Minor\r\nCanon’s face, and said, almost reproachfully: “O Mr. Crisparkle, would\r\nyou have Neville throw himself at young Drood’s feet, or at Mr.\r\nJasper’s, who maligns him every day? In your heart you cannot mean it.\r\nFrom your heart you could not do it, if his case were yours.”\r\n\r\n“I have represented to Mr. Crisparkle, Helena,” said Neville, with a\r\nglance of deference towards his tutor, “that if I could do it from my\r\nheart, I would. But I cannot, and I revolt from the pretence. You\r\nforget however, that to put the case to Mr. Crisparkle as his own, is\r\nto suppose to have done what I did.”\r\n\r\n“I ask his pardon,” said Helena.\r\n\r\n“You see,” remarked Mr. Crisparkle, again laying hold of his\r\nopportunity, though with a moderate and delicate touch, “you both\r\ninstinctively acknowledge that Neville did wrong. Then why stop short,\r\nand not otherwise acknowledge it?”\r\n\r\n“Is there no difference,” asked Helena, with a little faltering in her\r\nmanner; “between submission to a generous spirit, and submission to a\r\nbase or trivial one?”\r\n\r\nBefore the worthy Minor Canon was quite ready with his argument in\r\nreference to this nice distinction, Neville struck in:\r\n\r\n“Help me to clear myself with Mr. Crisparkle, Helena. Help me to\r\nconvince him that I cannot be the first to make concessions without\r\nmockery and falsehood. My nature must be changed before I can do so,\r\nand it is not changed. I am sensible of inexpressible affront, and\r\ndeliberate aggravation of inexpressible affront, and I am angry. The\r\nplain truth is, I am still as angry when I recall that night as I was\r\nthat night.”\r\n\r\n“Neville,” hinted the Minor Canon, with a steady countenance, “you have\r\nrepeated that former action of your hands, which I so much dislike.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry for it, sir, but it was involuntary. I confessed that I was\r\nstill as angry.”\r\n\r\n“And I confess,” said Mr. Crisparkle, “that I hoped for better things.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to disappoint you, sir, but it would be far worse to\r\ndeceive you, and I should deceive you grossly if I pretended that you\r\nhad softened me in this respect. The time may come when your powerful\r\ninfluence will do even that with the difficult pupil whose antecedents\r\nyou know; but it has not come yet. Is this so, and in spite of my\r\nstruggles against myself, Helena?”\r\n\r\nShe, whose dark eyes were watching the effect of what he said on Mr.\r\nCrisparkle’s face, replied—to Mr. Crisparkle, not to him: “It is so.”\r\nAfter a short pause, she answered the slightest look of inquiry\r\nconceivable, in her brother’s eyes, with as slight an affirmative bend\r\nof her own head; and he went on:\r\n\r\n“I have never yet had the courage to say to you, sir, what in full\r\nopenness I ought to have said when you first talked with me on this\r\nsubject. It is not easy to say, and I have been withheld by a fear of\r\nits seeming ridiculous, which is very strong upon me down to this last\r\nmoment, and might, but for my sister, prevent my being quite open with\r\nyou even now.—I admire Miss Bud, sir, so very much, that I cannot bear\r\nher being treated with conceit or indifference; and even if I did not\r\nfeel that I had an injury against young Drood on my own account, I\r\nshould feel that I had an injury against him on hers.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle, in utter amazement, looked at Helena for corroboration,\r\nand met in her expressive face full corroboration, and a plea for\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n“The young lady of whom you speak is, as you know, Mr. Neville, shortly\r\nto be married,” said Mr. Crisparkle, gravely; “therefore your\r\nadmiration, if it be of that special nature which you seem to indicate,\r\nis outrageously misplaced. Moreover, it is monstrous that you should\r\ntake upon yourself to be the young lady’s champion against her chosen\r\nhusband. Besides, you have seen them only once. The young lady has\r\nbecome your sister’s friend; and I wonder that your sister, even on her\r\nbehalf, has not checked you in this irrational and culpable fancy.”\r\n\r\n“She has tried, sir, but uselessly. Husband or no husband, that fellow\r\nis incapable of the feeling with which I am inspired towards the\r\nbeautiful young creature whom he treats like a doll. I say he is as\r\nincapable of it, as he is unworthy of her. I say she is sacrificed in\r\nbeing bestowed upon him. I say that I love her, and despise and hate\r\nhim!” This with a face so flushed, and a gesture so violent, that his\r\nsister crossed to his side, and caught his arm, remonstrating,\r\n“Neville, Neville!”\r\n\r\nThus recalled to himself, he quickly became sensible of having lost the\r\nguard he had set upon his passionate tendency, and covered his face\r\nwith his hand, as one repentant and wretched.\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle, watching him attentively, and at the same time\r\nmeditating how to proceed, walked on for some paces in silence. Then he\r\nspoke:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Neville, Mr. Neville, I am sorely grieved to see in you more\r\ntraces of a character as sullen, angry, and wild, as the night now\r\nclosing in. They are of too serious an aspect to leave me the resource\r\nof treating the infatuation you have disclosed, as undeserving serious\r\nconsideration. I give it very serious consideration, and I speak to you\r\naccordingly. This feud between you and young Drood must not go on. I\r\ncannot permit it to go on any longer, knowing what I now know from you,\r\nand you living under my roof. Whatever prejudiced and unauthorised\r\nconstructions your blind and envious wrath may put upon his character,\r\nit is a frank, good-natured character. I know I can trust to it for\r\nthat. Now, pray observe what I am about to say. On reflection, and on\r\nyour sister’s representation, I am willing to admit that, in making\r\npeace with young Drood, you have a right to be met half-way. I will\r\nengage that you shall be, and even that young Drood shall make the\r\nfirst advance. This condition fulfilled, you will pledge me the honour\r\nof a Christian gentleman that the quarrel is for ever at an end on your\r\nside. What may be in your heart when you give him your hand, can only\r\nbe known to the Searcher of all hearts; but it will never go well with\r\nyou, if there be any treachery there. So far, as to that; next as to\r\nwhat I must again speak of as your infatuation. I understand it to have\r\nbeen confided to me, and to be known to no other person save your\r\nsister and yourself. Do I understand aright?”\r\n\r\nHelena answered in a low voice: “It is only known to us three who are\r\nhere together.”\r\n\r\n“It is not at all known to the young lady, your friend?”\r\n\r\n“On my soul, no!”\r\n\r\n“I require you, then, to give me your similar and solemn pledge, Mr.\r\nNeville, that it shall remain the secret it is, and that you will take\r\nno other action whatsoever upon it than endeavouring (and that most\r\nearnestly) to erase it from your mind. I will not tell you that it will\r\nsoon pass; I will not tell you that it is the fancy of the moment; I\r\nwill not tell you that such caprices have their rise and fall among the\r\nyoung and ardent every hour; I will leave you undisturbed in the belief\r\nthat it has few parallels or none, that it will abide with you a long\r\ntime, and that it will be very difficult to conquer. So much the more\r\nweight shall I attach to the pledge I require from you, when it is\r\nunreservedly given.”\r\n\r\nThe young man twice or thrice essayed to speak, but failed.\r\n\r\n“Let me leave you with your sister, whom it is time you took home,”\r\nsaid Mr. Crisparkle. “You will find me alone in my room by-and-by.”\r\n\r\n“Pray do not leave us yet,” Helena implored him. “Another minute.”\r\n\r\n“I should not,” said Neville, pressing his hand upon his face, “have\r\nneeded so much as another minute, if you had been less patient with me,\r\nMr. Crisparkle, less considerate of me, and less unpretendingly good\r\nand true. O, if in my childhood I had known such a guide!”\r\n\r\n“Follow your guide now, Neville,” murmured Helena, “and follow him to\r\nHeaven!”\r\n\r\nThere was that in her tone which broke the good Minor Canon’s voice, or\r\nit would have repudiated her exaltation of him. As it was, he laid a\r\nfinger on his lips, and looked towards her brother.\r\n\r\n“To say that I give both pledges, Mr. Crisparkle, out of my innermost\r\nheart, and to say that there is no treachery in it, is to say nothing!”\r\nThus Neville, greatly moved. “I beg your forgiveness for my miserable\r\nlapse into a burst of passion.”\r\n\r\n“Not mine, Neville, not mine. You know with whom forgiveness lies, as\r\nthe highest attribute conceivable. Miss Helena, you and your brother\r\nare twin children. You came into this world with the same dispositions,\r\nand you passed your younger days together surrounded by the same\r\nadverse circumstances. What you have overcome in yourself, can you not\r\novercome in him? You see the rock that lies in his course. Who but you\r\ncan keep him clear of it?”\r\n\r\n“Who but you, sir?” replied Helena. “What is my influence, or my weak\r\nwisdom, compared with yours!”\r\n\r\n“You have the wisdom of Love,” returned the Minor Canon, “and it was\r\nthe highest wisdom ever known upon this earth, remember. As to mine—but\r\nthe less said of that commonplace commodity the better. Good night!”\r\n\r\nShe took the hand he offered her, and gratefully and almost reverently\r\nraised it to her lips.\r\n\r\n“Tut!” said the Minor Canon softly, “I am much overpaid!” and turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Crisparkle is overpaid]\r\n\r\n\r\nRetracing his steps towards the Cathedral Close, he tried, as he went\r\nalong in the dark, to think out the best means of bringing to pass what\r\nhe had promised to effect, and what must somehow be done. “I shall\r\nprobably be asked to marry them,” he reflected, “and I would they were\r\nmarried and gone! But this presses first.”\r\n\r\nHe debated principally whether he should write to young Drood, or\r\nwhether he should speak to Jasper. The consciousness of being popular\r\nwith the whole Cathedral establishment inclined him to the latter\r\ncourse, and the well-timed sight of the lighted gatehouse decided him\r\nto take it. “I will strike while the iron is hot,” he said, “and see\r\nhim now.”\r\n\r\nJasper was lying asleep on a couch before the fire, when, having\r\nascended the postern-stair, and received no answer to his knock at the\r\ndoor, Mr. Crisparkle gently turned the handle and looked in. Long\r\nafterwards he had cause to remember how Jasper sprang from the couch in\r\na delirious state between sleeping and waking, and crying out: “What is\r\nthe matter? Who did it?”\r\n\r\n“It is only I, Jasper. I am sorry to have disturbed you.”\r\n\r\nThe glare of his eyes settled down into a look of recognition, and he\r\nmoved a chair or two, to make a way to the fireside.\r\n\r\n“I was dreaming at a great rate, and am glad to be disturbed from an\r\nindigestive after-dinner sleep. Not to mention that you are always\r\nwelcome.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. I am not confident,” returned Mr. Crisparkle, as he sat\r\nhimself down in the easy-chair placed for him, “that my subject will at\r\nfirst sight be quite as welcome as myself; but I am a minister of\r\npeace, and I pursue my subject in the interests of peace. In a word,\r\nJasper, I want to establish peace between these two young fellows.”\r\n\r\nA very perplexed expression took hold of Mr. Jasper’s face; a very\r\nperplexing expression too, for Mr. Crisparkle could make nothing of it.\r\n\r\n“How?” was Jasper’s inquiry, in a low and slow voice, after a silence.\r\n\r\n“For the ‘How’ I come to you. I want to ask you to do me the great\r\nfavour and service of interposing with your nephew (I have already\r\ninterposed with Mr. Neville), and getting him to write you a short\r\nnote, in his lively way, saying that he is willing to shake hands. I\r\nknow what a good-natured fellow he is, and what influence you have with\r\nhim. And without in the least defending Mr. Neville, we must all admit\r\nthat he was bitterly stung.”\r\n\r\nJasper turned that perplexed face towards the fire. Mr. Crisparkle\r\ncontinuing to observe it, found it even more perplexing than before,\r\ninasmuch as it seemed to denote (which could hardly be) some close\r\ninternal calculation.\r\n\r\n“I know that you are not prepossessed in Mr. Neville’s favour,” the\r\nMinor Canon was going on, when Jasper stopped him:\r\n\r\n“You have cause to say so. I am not, indeed.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly; and I admit his lamentable violence of temper, though I\r\nhope he and I will get the better of it between us. But I have exacted\r\na very solemn promise from him as to his future demeanour towards your\r\nnephew, if you do kindly interpose; and I am sure he will keep it.”\r\n\r\n“You are always responsible and trustworthy, Mr. Crisparkle. Do you\r\nreally feel sure that you can answer for him so confidently?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\nThe perplexed and perplexing look vanished.\r\n\r\n“Then you relieve my mind of a great dread, and a heavy weight,” said\r\nJasper; “I will do it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle, delighted by the swiftness and completeness of his\r\nsuccess, acknowledged it in the handsomest terms.\r\n\r\n“I will do it,” repeated Jasper, “for the comfort of having your\r\nguarantee against my vague and unfounded fears. You will laugh—but do\r\nyou keep a Diary?”\r\n\r\n“A line for a day; not more.”\r\n\r\n“A line for a day would be quite as much as my uneventful life would\r\nneed, Heaven knows,” said Jasper, taking a book from a desk, “but that\r\nmy Diary is, in fact, a Diary of Ned’s life too. You will laugh at this\r\nentry; you will guess when it was made:\r\n\r\n“‘Past midnight.—After what I have just now seen, I have a morbid dread\r\nupon me of some horrible consequences resulting to my dear boy, that I\r\ncannot reason with or in any way contend against. All my efforts are\r\nvain. The demoniacal passion of this Neville Landless, his strength in\r\nhis fury, and his savage rage for the destruction of its object, appal\r\nme. So profound is the impression, that twice since I have gone into my\r\ndear boy’s room, to assure myself of his sleeping safely, and not lying\r\ndead in his blood.’\r\n\r\n\r\n“Here is another entry next morning:\r\n\r\n“‘Ned up and away. Light-hearted and unsuspicious as ever. He laughed\r\nwhen I cautioned him, and said he was as good a man as Neville Landless\r\nany day. I told him that might be, but he was not as bad a man. He\r\ncontinued to make light of it, but I travelled with him as far as I\r\ncould, and left him most unwillingly. I am unable to shake off these\r\ndark intangible presentiments of evil—if feelings founded upon staring\r\nfacts are to be so called.’\r\n\r\n\r\n“Again and again,” said Jasper, in conclusion, twirling the leaves of\r\nthe book before putting it by, “I have relapsed into these moods, as\r\nother entries show. But I have now your assurance at my back, and shall\r\nput it in my book, and make it an antidote to my black humours.”\r\n\r\n“Such an antidote, I hope,” returned Mr. Crisparkle, “as will induce\r\nyou before long to consign the black humours to the flames. I ought to\r\nbe the last to find any fault with you this evening, when you have met\r\nmy wishes so freely; but I must say, Jasper, that your devotion to your\r\nnephew has made you exaggerative here.”\r\n\r\n“You are my witness,” said Jasper, shrugging his shoulders, “what my\r\nstate of mind honestly was, that night, before I sat down to write, and\r\nin what words I expressed it. You remember objecting to a word I used,\r\nas being too strong? It was a stronger word than any in my Diary.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well. Try the antidote,” rejoined Mr. Crisparkle; “and may it\r\ngive you a brighter and better view of the case! We will discuss it no\r\nmore now. I have to thank you for myself, thank you sincerely.”\r\n\r\n“You shall find,” said Jasper, as they shook hands, “that I will not do\r\nthe thing you wish me to do, by halves. I will take care that Ned,\r\ngiving way at all, shall give way thoroughly.”\r\n\r\nOn the third day after this conversation, he called on Mr. Crisparkle\r\nwith the following letter:\r\n\r\n“MY DEAR JACK,\r\n    “I am touched by your account of your interview with Mr.\r\n    Crisparkle, whom I much respect and esteem. At once I openly say\r\n    that I forgot myself on that occasion quite as much as Mr. Landless\r\n    did, and that I wish that bygone to be a bygone, and all to be\r\n    right again.\r\n    “Look here, dear old boy. Ask Mr. Landless to dinner on Christmas\r\n    Eve (the better the day the better the deed), and let there be only\r\n    we three, and let us shake hands all round there and then, and say\r\n    no more about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n“My dear Jack,\r\n“Ever your most affectionate,\r\n“EDWIN DROOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n“P.S. Love to Miss Pussy at the next music-lesson.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“You expect Mr. Neville, then?” said Mr. Crisparkle.\r\n\r\n“I count upon his coming,” said Mr. Jasper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nA PICTURE AND A RING\r\n\r\n\r\nBehind the most ancient part of Holborn, London, where certain gabled\r\nhouses some centuries of age still stand looking on the public way, as\r\nif disconsolately looking for the Old Bourne that has long run dry, is\r\na little nook composed of two irregular quadrangles, called Staple Inn.\r\nIt is one of those nooks, the turning into which out of the clashing\r\nstreet, imparts to the relieved pedestrian the sensation of having put\r\ncotton in his ears, and velvet soles on his boots. It is one of those\r\nnooks where a few smoky sparrows twitter in smoky trees, as though they\r\ncalled to one another, “Let us play at country,” and where a few feet\r\nof garden-mould and a few yards of gravel enable them to do that\r\nrefreshing violence to their tiny understandings. Moreover, it is one\r\nof those nooks which are legal nooks; and it contains a little Hall,\r\nwith a little lantern in its roof: to what obstructive purposes\r\ndevoted, and at whose expense, this history knoweth not.\r\n\r\nIn the days when Cloisterham took offence at the existence of a\r\nrailroad afar off, as menacing that sensitive constitution, the\r\nproperty of us Britons: the odd fortune of which sacred institution it\r\nis to be in exactly equal degrees croaked about, trembled for, and\r\nboasted of, whatever happens to anything, anywhere in the world: in\r\nthose days no neighbouring architecture of lofty proportions had arisen\r\nto overshadow Staple Inn. The westering sun bestowed bright glances on\r\nit, and the south-west wind blew into it unimpeded.\r\n\r\nNeither wind nor sun, however, favoured Staple Inn one December\r\nafternoon towards six o’clock, when it was filled with fog, and candles\r\nshed murky and blurred rays through the windows of all its\r\nthen-occupied sets of chambers; notably from a set of chambers in a\r\ncorner house in the little inner quadrangle, presenting in black and\r\nwhite over its ugly portal the mysterious inscription:\r\n\r\nP\r\nJ\r\nT\r\n1747\r\n\r\n\r\nIn which set of chambers, never having troubled his head about the\r\ninscription, unless to bethink himself at odd times on glancing up at\r\nit, that haply it might mean Perhaps John Thomas, or Perhaps Joe Tyler,\r\nsat Mr. Grewgious writing by his fire.\r\n\r\nWho could have told, by looking at Mr. Grewgious, whether he had ever\r\nknown ambition or disappointment? He had been bred to the Bar, and had\r\nlaid himself out for chamber practice; to draw deeds; “convey the wise\r\nit call,” as Pistol says. But Conveyancing and he had made such a very\r\nindifferent marriage of it that they had separated by consent—if there\r\ncan be said to be separation where there has never been coming\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nNo. Coy Conveyancing would not come to Mr. Grewgious. She was wooed,\r\nnot won, and they went their several ways. But an Arbitration being\r\nblown towards him by some unaccountable wind, and he gaining great\r\ncredit in it as one indefatigable in seeking out right and doing right,\r\na pretty fat Receivership was next blown into his pocket by a wind more\r\ntraceable to its source. So, by chance, he had found his niche.\r\nReceiver and Agent now, to two rich estates, and deputing their legal\r\nbusiness, in an amount worth having, to a firm of solicitors on the\r\nfloor below, he had snuffed out his ambition (supposing him to have\r\never lighted it), and had settled down with his snuffers for the rest\r\nof his life under the dry vine and fig-tree of P. J. T., who planted in\r\nseventeen-forty-seven.\r\n\r\nMany accounts and account-books, many files of correspondence, and\r\nseveral strong boxes, garnished Mr. Grewgious’s room. They can scarcely\r\nbe represented as having lumbered it, so conscientious and precise was\r\ntheir orderly arrangement. The apprehension of dying suddenly, and\r\nleaving one fact or one figure with any incompleteness or obscurity\r\nattaching to it, would have stretched Mr. Grewgious stone-dead any day.\r\nThe largest fidelity to a trust was the life-blood of the man. There\r\nare sorts of life-blood that course more quickly, more gaily, more\r\nattractively; but there is no better sort in circulation.\r\n\r\nThere was no luxury in his room. Even its comforts were limited to its\r\nbeing dry and warm, and having a snug though faded fireside. What may\r\nbe called its private life was confined to the hearth, and an\r\neasy-chair, and an old-fashioned occasional round table that was\r\nbrought out upon the rug after business hours, from a corner where it\r\nelsewise remained turned up like a shining mahogany shield. Behind it,\r\nwhen standing thus on the defensive, was a closet, usually containing\r\nsomething good to drink. An outer room was the clerk’s room; Mr.\r\nGrewgious’s sleeping-room was across the common stair; and he held some\r\nnot empty cellarage at the bottom of the common stair. Three hundred\r\ndays in the year, at least, he crossed over to the hotel in Furnival’s\r\nInn for his dinner, and after dinner crossed back again, to make the\r\nmost of these simplicities until it should become broad business day\r\nonce more, with P. J. T., date seventeen-forty-seven.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Grewgious sat and wrote by his fire that afternoon, so did the\r\nclerk of Mr. Grewgious sit and write by _his_ fire. A pale,\r\npuffy-faced, dark-haired person of thirty, with big dark eyes that\r\nwholly wanted lustre, and a dissatisfied doughy complexion, that seemed\r\nto ask to be sent to the baker’s, this attendant was a mysterious\r\nbeing, possessed of some strange power over Mr. Grewgious. As though he\r\nhad been called into existence, like a fabulous Familiar, by a magic\r\nspell which had failed when required to dismiss him, he stuck tight to\r\nMr. Grewgious’s stool, although Mr. Grewgious’s comfort and convenience\r\nwould manifestly have been advanced by dispossessing him. A gloomy\r\nperson with tangled locks, and a general air of having been reared\r\nunder the shadow of that baleful tree of Java which has given shelter\r\nto more lies than the whole botanical kingdom, Mr. Grewgious,\r\nnevertheless, treated him with unaccountable consideration.\r\n\r\n“Now, Bazzard,” said Mr. Grewgious, on the entrance of his clerk:\r\nlooking up from his papers as he arranged them for the night: “what is\r\nin the wind besides fog?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Drood,” said Bazzard.\r\n\r\n“What of him?”\r\n\r\n“Has called,” said Bazzard.\r\n\r\n“You might have shown him in.”\r\n\r\n“I am doing it,” said Bazzard.\r\n\r\nThe visitor came in accordingly.\r\n\r\n“Dear me!” said Mr. Grewgious, looking round his pair of office\r\ncandles. “I thought you had called and merely left your name and gone.\r\nHow do you do, Mr. Edwin? Dear me, you’re choking!”\r\n\r\n“It’s this fog,” returned Edwin; “and it makes my eyes smart, like\r\nCayenne pepper.”\r\n\r\n“Is it really so bad as that? Pray undo your wrappers. It’s fortunate I\r\nhave so good a fire; but Mr. Bazzard has taken care of me.”\r\n\r\n“No I haven’t,” said Mr. Bazzard at the door.\r\n\r\n“Ah! then it follows that I must have taken care of myself without\r\nobserving it,” said Mr. Grewgious. “Pray be seated in my chair. No. I\r\nbeg! Coming out of such an atmosphere, in _my_ chair.”\r\n\r\nEdwin took the easy-chair in the corner; and the fog he had brought in\r\nwith him, and the fog he took off with his greatcoat and neck-shawl,\r\nwas speedily licked up by the eager fire.\r\n\r\n“I look,” said Edwin, smiling, “as if I had come to stop.”\r\n\r\n“—By the by,” cried Mr. Grewgious; “excuse my interrupting you; do\r\nstop. The fog may clear in an hour or two. We can have dinner in from\r\njust across Holborn. You had better take your Cayenne pepper here than\r\noutside; pray stop and dine.”\r\n\r\n“You are very kind,” said Edwin, glancing about him as though attracted\r\nby the notion of a new and relishing sort of gipsy-party.\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” said Mr. Grewgious; “_you_ are very kind to join issue\r\nwith a bachelor in chambers, and take pot-luck. And I’ll ask,” said Mr.\r\nGrewgious, dropping his voice, and speaking with a twinkling eye, as if\r\ninspired with a bright thought: “I’ll ask Bazzard. He mightn’t like it\r\nelse.—Bazzard!”\r\n\r\nBazzard reappeared.\r\n\r\n“Dine presently with Mr. Drood and me.”\r\n\r\n“If I am ordered to dine, of course I will, sir,” was the gloomy\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n“Save the man!” cried Mr. Grewgious. “You’re not ordered; you’re\r\ninvited.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir,” said Bazzard; “in that case I don’t care if I do.”\r\n\r\n“That’s arranged. And perhaps you wouldn’t mind,” said Mr. Grewgious,\r\n“stepping over to the hotel in Furnival’s, and asking them to send in\r\nmaterials for laying the cloth. For dinner we’ll have a tureen of the\r\nhottest and strongest soup available, and we’ll have the best made-dish\r\nthat can be recommended, and we’ll have a joint (such as a haunch of\r\nmutton), and we’ll have a goose, or a turkey, or any little stuffed\r\nthing of that sort that may happen to be in the bill of fare—in short,\r\nwe’ll have whatever there is on hand.”\r\n\r\nThese liberal directions Mr. Grewgious issued with his usual air of\r\nreading an inventory, or repeating a lesson, or doing anything else by\r\nrote. Bazzard, after drawing out the round table, withdrew to execute\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“I was a little delicate, you see,” said Mr. Grewgious, in a lower\r\ntone, after his clerk’s departure, “about employing him in the foraging\r\nor commissariat department. Because he mightn’t like it.”\r\n\r\n“He seems to have his own way, sir,” remarked Edwin.\r\n\r\n“His own way?” returned Mr. Grewgious. “O dear no! Poor fellow, you\r\nquite mistake him. If he had his own way, he wouldn’t be here.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder where he would be!” Edwin thought. But he only thought it,\r\nbecause Mr. Grewgious came and stood himself with his back to the other\r\ncorner of the fire, and his shoulder-blades against the chimneypiece,\r\nand collected his skirts for easy conversation.\r\n\r\n“I take it, without having the gift of prophecy, that you have done me\r\nthe favour of looking in to mention that you are going down\r\nyonder—where I can tell you, you are expected—and to offer to execute\r\nany little commission from me to my charming ward, and perhaps to\r\nsharpen me up a bit in any proceedings? Eh, Mr. Edwin?”\r\n\r\n“I called, sir, before going down, as an act of attention.”\r\n\r\n“Of attention!” said Mr. Grewgious. “Ah! of course, not of impatience?”\r\n\r\n“Impatience, sir?”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious had meant to be arch—not that he in the remotest degree\r\nexpressed that meaning—and had brought himself into scarcely\r\nsupportable proximity with the fire, as if to burn the fullest effect\r\nof his archness into himself, as other subtle impressions are burnt\r\ninto hard metals. But his archness suddenly flying before the composed\r\nface and manner of his visitor, and only the fire remaining, he started\r\nand rubbed himself.\r\n\r\n“I have lately been down yonder,” said Mr. Grewgious, rearranging his\r\nskirts; “and that was what I referred to, when I said I could tell you\r\nyou are expected.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir! Yes; I knew that Pussy was looking out for me.”\r\n\r\n“Do you keep a cat down there?” asked Mr. Grewgious.\r\n\r\nEdwin coloured a little as he explained: “I call Rosa Pussy.”\r\n\r\n“O, really,” said Mr. Grewgious, smoothing down his head; “that’s very\r\naffable.”\r\n\r\nEdwin glanced at his face, uncertain whether or no he seriously\r\nobjected to the appellation. But Edwin might as well have glanced at\r\nthe face of a clock.\r\n\r\n“A pet name, sir,” he explained again.\r\n\r\n“Umps,” said Mr. Grewgious, with a nod. But with such an extraordinary\r\ncompromise between an unqualified assent and a qualified dissent, that\r\nhis visitor was much disconcerted.\r\n\r\n“Did PRosa—” Edwin began by way of recovering himself.\r\n\r\n“PRosa?” repeated Mr. Grewgious.\r\n\r\n“I was going to say Pussy, and changed my mind;—did she tell you\r\nanything about the Landlesses?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mr. Grewgious. “What is the Landlesses? An estate? A villa?\r\nA farm?”\r\n\r\n“A brother and sister. The sister is at the Nuns’ House, and has become\r\na great friend of P—”\r\n\r\n“PRosa’s,” Mr. Grewgious struck in, with a fixed face.\r\n\r\n“She is a strikingly handsome girl, sir, and I thought she might have\r\nbeen described to you, or presented to you perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“Neither,” said Mr. Grewgious. “But here is Bazzard.”\r\n\r\nBazzard returned, accompanied by two waiters—an immovable waiter, and a\r\nflying waiter; and the three brought in with them as much fog as gave a\r\nnew roar to the fire. The flying waiter, who had brought everything on\r\nhis shoulders, laid the cloth with amazing rapidity and dexterity;\r\nwhile the immovable waiter, who had brought nothing, found fault with\r\nhim. The flying waiter then highly polished all the glasses he had\r\nbrought, and the immovable waiter looked through them. The flying\r\nwaiter then flew across Holborn for the soup, and flew back again, and\r\nthen took another flight for the made-dish, and flew back again, and\r\nthen took another flight for the joint and poultry, and flew back\r\nagain, and between whiles took supplementary flights for a great\r\nvariety of articles, as it was discovered from time to time that the\r\nimmovable waiter had forgotten them all. But let the flying waiter\r\ncleave the air as he might, he was always reproached on his return by\r\nthe immovable waiter for bringing fog with him, and being out of\r\nbreath. At the conclusion of the repast, by which time the flying\r\nwaiter was severely blown, the immovable waiter gathered up the\r\ntablecloth under his arm with a grand air, and having sternly (not to\r\nsay with indignation) looked on at the flying waiter while he set the\r\nclean glasses round, directed a valedictory glance towards Mr.\r\nGrewgious, conveying: “Let it be clearly understood between us that the\r\nreward is mine, and that Nil is the claim of this slave,” and pushed\r\nthe flying waiter before him out of the room.\r\n\r\nIt was like a highly-finished miniature painting representing My Lords\r\nof the Circumlocution Department, Commandership-in-Chief of any sort,\r\nGovernment. It was quite an edifying little picture to be hung on the\r\nline in the National Gallery.\r\n\r\nAs the fog had been the proximate cause of this sumptuous repast, so\r\nthe fog served for its general sauce. To hear the out-door clerks\r\nsneezing, wheezing, and beating their feet on the gravel was a zest far\r\nsurpassing Doctor Kitchener’s. To bid, with a shiver, the unfortunate\r\nflying waiter shut the door before he had opened it, was a condiment of\r\na profounder flavour than Harvey. And here let it be noticed,\r\nparenthetically, that the leg of this young man, in its application to\r\nthe door, evinced the finest sense of touch: always preceding himself\r\nand tray (with something of an angling air about it), by some seconds:\r\nand always lingering after he and the tray had disappeared, like\r\nMacbeth’s leg when accompanying him off the stage with reluctance to\r\nthe assassination of Duncan.\r\n\r\nThe host had gone below to the cellar, and had brought up bottles of\r\nruby, straw-coloured, and golden drinks, which had ripened long ago in\r\nlands where no fogs are, and had since lain slumbering in the shade.\r\nSparkling and tingling after so long a nap, they pushed at their corks\r\nto help the corkscrew (like prisoners helping rioters to force their\r\ngates), and danced out gaily. If P. J. T. in seventeen-forty-seven, or\r\nin any other year of his period, drank such wines—then, for a\r\ncertainty, P. J. T. was Pretty Jolly Too.\r\n\r\nExternally, Mr. Grewgious showed no signs of being mellowed by these\r\nglowing vintages. Instead of his drinking them, they might have been\r\npoured over him in his high-dried snuff form, and run to waste, for any\r\nlights and shades they caused to flicker over his face. Neither was his\r\nmanner influenced. But, in his wooden way, he had observant eyes for\r\nEdwin; and when at the end of dinner, he motioned Edwin back to his own\r\neasy-chair in the fireside corner, and Edwin sank luxuriously into it\r\nafter very brief remonstrance, Mr. Grewgious, as he turned his seat\r\nround towards the fire too, and smoothed his head and face, might have\r\nbeen seen looking at his visitor between his smoothing fingers.\r\n\r\n“Bazzard!” said Mr. Grewgious, suddenly turning to him.\r\n\r\n“I follow you, sir,” returned Bazzard; who had done his work of\r\nconsuming meat and drink in a workmanlike manner, though mostly in\r\nspeechlessness.\r\n\r\n“I drink to you, Bazzard; Mr. Edwin, success to Mr. Bazzard!”\r\n\r\n“Success to Mr. Bazzard!” echoed Edwin, with a totally unfounded\r\nappearance of enthusiasm, and with the unspoken addition: “What in, I\r\nwonder!”\r\n\r\n“And May!” pursued Mr. Grewgious—“I am not at liberty to be\r\ndefinite—May!—my conversational powers are so very limited that I know\r\nI shall not come well out of this—May!—it ought to be put\r\nimaginatively, but I have no imagination—May!—the thorn of anxiety is\r\nas nearly the mark as I am likely to get—May it come out at last!”\r\n\r\nMr. Bazzard, with a frowning smile at the fire, put a hand into his\r\ntangled locks, as if the thorn of anxiety were there; then into his\r\nwaistcoat, as if it were there; then into his pockets, as if it were\r\nthere. In all these movements he was closely followed by the eyes of\r\nEdwin, as if that young gentleman expected to see the thorn in action.\r\nIt was not produced, however, and Mr. Bazzard merely said: “I follow\r\nyou, sir, and I thank you.”\r\n\r\n“I am going,” said Mr. Grewgious, jingling his glass on the table with\r\none hand, and bending aside under cover of the other, to whisper to\r\nEdwin, “to drink to my ward. But I put Bazzard first. He mightn’t like\r\nit else.”\r\n\r\nThis was said with a mysterious wink; or what would have been a wink,\r\nif, in Mr. Grewgious’s hands, it could have been quick enough. So Edwin\r\nwinked responsively, without the least idea what he meant by doing so.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Mr. Grewgious, “I devote a bumper to the fair and\r\nfascinating Miss Rosa. Bazzard, the fair and fascinating Miss Rosa!”\r\n\r\n“I follow you, sir,” said Bazzard, “and I pledge you!”\r\n\r\n“And so do I!” said Edwin.\r\n\r\n“Lord bless me,” cried Mr. Grewgious, breaking the blank silence which\r\nof course ensued: though why these pauses _should_ come upon us when we\r\nhave performed any small social rite, not directly inducive of\r\nself-examination or mental despondency, who can tell? “I am a\r\nparticularly Angular man, and yet I fancy (if I may use the word, not\r\nhaving a morsel of fancy), that I could draw a picture of a true\r\nlover’s state of mind, to-night.”\r\n\r\n“Let us follow you, sir,” said Bazzard, “and have the picture.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Edwin will correct it where it’s wrong,” resumed Mr. Grewgious,\r\n“and will throw in a few touches from the life. I dare say it is wrong\r\nin many particulars, and wants many touches from the life, for I was\r\nborn a Chip, and have neither soft sympathies nor soft experiences.\r\nWell! I hazard the guess that the true lover’s mind is completely\r\npermeated by the beloved object of his affections. I hazard the guess\r\nthat her dear name is precious to him, cannot be heard or repeated\r\nwithout emotion, and is preserved sacred. If he has any distinguishing\r\nappellation of fondness for her, it is reserved for her, and is not for\r\ncommon ears. A name that it would be a privilege to call her by, being\r\nalone with her own bright self, it would be a liberty, a coldness, an\r\ninsensibility, almost a breach of good faith, to flaunt elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful to see Mr. Grewgious sitting bolt upright, with his\r\nhands on his knees, continuously chopping this discourse out of\r\nhimself: much as a charity boy with a very good memory might get his\r\ncatechism said: and evincing no correspondent emotion whatever, unless\r\nin a certain occasional little tingling perceptible at the end of his\r\nnose.\r\n\r\n“My picture,” Mr. Grewgious proceeded, “goes on to represent (under\r\ncorrection from you, Mr. Edwin), the true lover as ever impatient to be\r\nin the presence or vicinity of the beloved object of his affections; as\r\ncaring very little for his case in any other society; and as constantly\r\nseeking that. If I was to say seeking that, as a bird seeks its nest, I\r\nshould make an ass of myself, because that would trench upon what I\r\nunderstand to be poetry; and I am so far from trenching upon poetry at\r\nany time, that I never, to my knowledge, got within ten thousand miles\r\nof it. And I am besides totally unacquainted with the habits of birds,\r\nexcept the birds of Staple Inn, who seek their nests on ledges, and in\r\ngutter-pipes and chimneypots, not constructed for them by the\r\nbeneficent hand of Nature. I beg, therefore, to be understood as\r\nforegoing the bird’s-nest. But my picture does represent the true lover\r\nas having no existence separable from that of the beloved object of his\r\naffections, and as living at once a doubled life and a halved life. And\r\nif I do not clearly express what I mean by that, it is either for the\r\nreason that having no conversational powers, I cannot express what I\r\nmean, or that having no meaning, I do not mean what I fail to express.\r\nWhich, to the best of my belief, is not the case.”\r\n\r\nEdwin had turned red and turned white, as certain points of this\r\npicture came into the light. He now sat looking at the fire, and bit\r\nhis lip.\r\n\r\n“The speculations of an Angular man,” resumed Mr. Grewgious, still\r\nsitting and speaking exactly as before, “are probably erroneous on so\r\nglobular a topic. But I figure to myself (subject, as before, to Mr.\r\nEdwin’s correction), that there can be no coolness, no lassitude, no\r\ndoubt, no indifference, no half fire and half smoke state of mind, in a\r\nreal lover. Pray am I at all near the mark in my picture?”\r\n\r\nAs abrupt in his conclusion as in his commencement and progress, he\r\njerked this inquiry at Edwin, and stopped when one might have supposed\r\nhim in the middle of his oration.\r\n\r\n“I should say, sir,” stammered Edwin, “as you refer the question to\r\nme—”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr. Grewgious, “I refer it to you, as an authority.”\r\n\r\n“I should say, then, sir,” Edwin went on, embarrassed, “that the\r\npicture you have drawn is generally correct; but I submit that perhaps\r\nyou may be rather hard upon the unlucky lover.”\r\n\r\n“Likely so,” assented Mr. Grewgious, “likely so. I am a hard man in the\r\ngrain.”\r\n\r\n“He may not show,” said Edwin, “all he feels; or he may not—”\r\n\r\nThere he stopped so long, to find the rest of his sentence, that Mr.\r\nGrewgious rendered his difficulty a thousand times the greater by\r\nunexpectedly striking in with:\r\n\r\n“No to be sure; he _may_ not!”\r\n\r\nAfter that, they all sat silent; the silence of Mr. Bazzard being\r\noccasioned by slumber.\r\n\r\n“His responsibility is very great, though,” said Mr. Grewgious at\r\nlength, with his eyes on the fire.\r\n\r\nEdwin nodded assent, with _his_ eyes on the fire.\r\n\r\n“And let him be sure that he trifles with no one,” said Mr. Grewgious;\r\n“neither with himself, nor with any other.”\r\n\r\nEdwin bit his lip again, and still sat looking at the fire.\r\n\r\n“He must not make a plaything of a treasure. Woe betide him if he does!\r\nLet him take that well to heart,” said Mr. Grewgious.\r\n\r\nThough he said these things in short sentences, much as the\r\nsupposititious charity boy just now referred to might have repeated a\r\nverse or two from the Book of Proverbs, there was something dreamy (for\r\nso literal a man) in the way in which he now shook his right forefinger\r\nat the live coals in the grate, and again fell silent.\r\n\r\nBut not for long. As he sat upright and stiff in his chair, he suddenly\r\nrapped his knees, like the carved image of some queer Joss or other\r\ncoming out of its reverie, and said: “We must finish this bottle, Mr.\r\nEdwin. Let me help you. I’ll help Bazzard too, though he _is_ asleep.\r\nHe mightn’t like it else.”\r\n\r\nHe helped them both, and helped himself, and drained his glass, and\r\nstood it bottom upward on the table, as though he had just caught a\r\nbluebottle in it.\r\n\r\n“And now, Mr. Edwin,” he proceeded, wiping his mouth and hands upon his\r\nhandkerchief: “to a little piece of business. You received from me, the\r\nother day, a certified copy of Miss Rosa’s father’s will. You knew its\r\ncontents before, but you received it from me as a matter of business. I\r\nshould have sent it to Mr. Jasper, but for Miss Rosa’s wishing it to\r\ncome straight to you, in preference. You received it?”\r\n\r\n“Quite safely, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You should have acknowledged its receipt,” said Mr. Grewgious;\r\n“business being business all the world over. However, you did not.”\r\n\r\n“I meant to have acknowledged it when I first came in this evening,\r\nsir.”\r\n\r\n“Not a business-like acknowledgment,” returned Mr. Grewgious; “however,\r\nlet that pass. Now, in that document you have observed a few words of\r\nkindly allusion to its being left to me to discharge a little trust,\r\nconfided to me in conversation, at such time as I in my discretion may\r\nthink best.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Edwin, it came into my mind just now, when I was looking at the\r\nfire, that I could, in my discretion, acquit myself of that trust at no\r\nbetter time than the present. Favour me with your attention, half a\r\nminute.”\r\n\r\nHe took a bunch of keys from his pocket, singled out by the\r\ncandle-light the key he wanted, and then, with a candle in his hand,\r\nwent to a bureau or escritoire, unlocked it, touched the spring of a\r\nlittle secret drawer, and took from it an ordinary ring-case made for a\r\nsingle ring. With this in his hand, he returned to his chair. As he\r\nheld it up for the young man to see, his hand trembled.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Edwin, this rose of diamonds and rubies delicately set in gold,\r\nwas a ring belonging to Miss Rosa’s mother. It was removed from her\r\ndead hand, in my presence, with such distracted grief as I hope it may\r\nnever be my lot to contemplate again. Hard man as I am, I am not hard\r\nenough for that. See how bright these stones shine!” opening the case.\r\n“And yet the eyes that were so much brighter, and that so often looked\r\nupon them with a light and a proud heart, have been ashes among ashes,\r\nand dust among dust, some years! If I had any imagination (which it is\r\nneedless to say I have not), I might imagine that the lasting beauty of\r\nthese stones was almost cruel.”\r\n\r\nHe closed the case again as he spoke.\r\n\r\n“This ring was given to the young lady who was drowned so early in her\r\nbeautiful and happy career, by her husband, when they first plighted\r\ntheir faith to one another. It was he who removed it from her\r\nunconscious hand, and it was he who, when his death drew very near,\r\nplaced it in mine. The trust in which I received it, was, that, you and\r\nMiss Rosa growing to manhood and womanhood, and your betrothal\r\nprospering and coming to maturity, I should give it to you to place\r\nupon her finger. Failing those desired results, it was to remain in my\r\npossession.”\r\n\r\nSome trouble was in the young man’s face, and some indecision was in\r\nthe action of his hand, as Mr. Grewgious, looking steadfastly at him,\r\ngave him the ring.\r\n\r\n“Your placing it on her finger,” said Mr. Grewgious, “will be the\r\nsolemn seal upon your strict fidelity to the living and the dead. You\r\nare going to her, to make the last irrevocable preparations for your\r\nmarriage. Take it with you.”\r\n\r\nThe young man took the little case, and placed it in his breast.\r\n\r\n“If anything should be amiss, if anything should be even slightly\r\nwrong, between you; if you should have any secret consciousness that\r\nyou are committing yourself to this step for no higher reason than\r\nbecause you have long been accustomed to look forward to it; then,”\r\nsaid Mr. Grewgious, “I charge you once more, by the living and by the\r\ndead, to bring that ring back to me!”\r\n\r\nHere Bazzard awoke himself by his own snoring; and, as is usual in such\r\ncases, sat apoplectically staring at vacancy, as defying vacancy to\r\naccuse him of having been asleep.\r\n\r\n“Bazzard!” said Mr. Grewgious, harder than ever.\r\n\r\n“I follow you, sir,” said Bazzard, “and I have been following you.”\r\n\r\n“In discharge of a trust, I have handed Mr. Edwin Drood a ring of\r\ndiamonds and rubies. You see?”\r\n\r\nEdwin reproduced the little case, and opened it; and Bazzard looked\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\n“I follow you both, sir,” returned Bazzard, “and I witness the\r\ntransaction.”\r\n\r\nEvidently anxious to get away and be alone, Edwin Drood now resumed his\r\nouter clothing, muttering something about time and appointments. The\r\nfog was reported no clearer (by the flying waiter, who alighted from a\r\nspeculative flight in the coffee interest), but he went out into it;\r\nand Bazzard, after his manner, “followed” him.\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious, left alone, walked softly and slowly to and fro, for an\r\nhour and more. He was restless to-night, and seemed dispirited.\r\n\r\n“I hope I have done right,” he said. “The appeal to him seemed\r\nnecessary. It was hard to lose the ring, and yet it must have gone from\r\nme very soon.”\r\n\r\nHe closed the empty little drawer with a sigh, and shut and locked the\r\nescritoire, and came back to the solitary fireside.\r\n\r\n“Her ring,” he went on. “Will it come back to me? My mind hangs about\r\nher ring very uneasily to-night. But that is explainable. I have had it\r\nso long, and I have prized it so much! I wonder—”\r\n\r\nHe was in a wondering mood as well as a restless; for, though he\r\nchecked himself at that point, and took another walk, he resumed his\r\nwondering when he sat down again.\r\n\r\n“I wonder (for the ten-thousandth time, and what a weak fool I, for\r\nwhat can it signify now!) whether he confided the charge of their\r\norphan child to me, because he knew—Good God, how like her mother she\r\nhas become!”\r\n\r\n“I wonder whether he ever so much as suspected that some one doted on\r\nher, at a hopeless, speechless distance, when he struck in and won her.\r\nI wonder whether it ever crept into his mind who that unfortunate some\r\none was!”\r\n\r\n“I wonder whether I shall sleep to-night! At all events, I will shut\r\nout the world with the bedclothes, and try.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious crossed the staircase to his raw and foggy bedroom, and\r\nwas soon ready for bed. Dimly catching sight of his face in the misty\r\nlooking-glass, he held his candle to it for a moment.\r\n\r\n“A likely some one, _you_, to come into anybody’s thoughts in such an\r\naspect!” he exclaimed. “There! there! there! Get to bed, poor man, and\r\ncease to jabber!”\r\n\r\nWith that, he extinguished his light, pulled up the bedclothes around\r\nhim, and with another sigh shut out the world. And yet there are such\r\nunexplored romantic nooks in the unlikeliest men, that even old\r\ntinderous and touchwoody P. J. T. Possibly Jabbered Thus, at some odd\r\ntimes, in or about seventeen-forty-seven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nA NIGHT WITH DURDLES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Sapsea has nothing better to do, towards evening, and finds\r\nthe contemplation of his own profundity becoming a little monotonous in\r\nspite of the vastness of the subject, he often takes an airing in the\r\nCathedral Close and thereabout. He likes to pass the churchyard with a\r\nswelling air of proprietorship, and to encourage in his breast a sort\r\nof benignant-landlord feeling, in that he has been bountiful towards\r\nthat meritorious tenant, Mrs. Sapsea, and has publicly given her a\r\nprize. He likes to see a stray face or two looking in through the\r\nrailings, and perhaps reading his inscription. Should he meet a\r\nstranger coming from the churchyard with a quick step, he is morally\r\nconvinced that the stranger is “with a blush retiring,” as monumentally\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nMr. Sapsea’s importance has received enhancement, for he has become\r\nMayor of Cloisterham. Without mayors, and many of them, it cannot be\r\ndisputed that the whole framework of society—Mr. Sapsea is confident\r\nthat he invented that forcible figure—would fall to pieces. Mayors have\r\nbeen knighted for “going up” with addresses: explosive machines\r\nintrepidly discharging shot and shell into the English Grammar. Mr.\r\nSapsea may “go up” with an address. Rise, Sir Thomas Sapsea! Of such is\r\nthe salt of the earth.\r\n\r\nMr. Sapsea has improved the acquaintance of Mr. Jasper, since their\r\nfirst meeting to partake of port, epitaph, backgammon, beef, and salad.\r\nMr. Sapsea has been received at the gatehouse with kindred hospitality;\r\nand on that occasion Mr. Jasper seated himself at the piano, and sang\r\nto him, tickling his ears—figuratively—long enough to present a\r\nconsiderable area for tickling. What Mr. Sapsea likes in that young man\r\nis, that he is always ready to profit by the wisdom of his elders, and\r\nthat he is sound, sir, at the core. In proof of which, he sang to Mr.\r\nSapsea that evening, no kickshaw ditties, favourites with national\r\nenemies, but gave him the genuine George the Third home-brewed;\r\nexhorting him (as “my brave boys”) to reduce to a smashed condition all\r\nother islands but this island, and all continents, peninsulas,\r\nisthmuses, promontories, and other geographical forms of land soever,\r\nbesides sweeping the seas in all directions. In short, he rendered it\r\npretty clear that Providence made a distinct mistake in originating so\r\nsmall a nation of hearts of oak, and so many other verminous peoples.\r\n\r\nMr. Sapsea, walking slowly this moist evening near the churchyard with\r\nhis hands behind him, on the look-out for a blushing and retiring\r\nstranger, turns a corner, and comes instead into the goodly presence of\r\nthe Dean, conversing with the Verger and Mr. Jasper. Mr. Sapsea makes\r\nhis obeisance, and is instantly stricken far more ecclesiastical than\r\nany Archbishop of York or Canterbury.\r\n\r\n“You are evidently going to write a book about us, Mr. Jasper,” quoth\r\nthe Dean; “to write a book about us. Well! We are very ancient, and we\r\nought to make a good book. We are not so richly endowed in possessions\r\nas in age; but perhaps you will put _that_ in your book, among other\r\nthings, and call attention to our wrongs.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tope, as in duty bound, is greatly entertained by this.\r\n\r\n“I really have no intention at all, sir,” replies Jasper, “of turning\r\nauthor or archæologist. It is but a whim of mine. And even for my whim,\r\nMr. Sapsea here is more accountable than I am.”\r\n\r\n“How so, Mr. Mayor?” says the Dean, with a nod of good-natured\r\nrecognition of his Fetch. “How is that, Mr. Mayor?”\r\n\r\n“I am not aware,” Mr. Sapsea remarks, looking about him for\r\ninformation, “to what the Very Reverend the Dean does me the honour of\r\nreferring.” And then falls to studying his original in minute points of\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n“Durdles,” Mr. Tope hints.\r\n\r\n“Ay!” the Dean echoes; “Durdles, Durdles!”\r\n\r\n“The truth is, sir,” explains Jasper, “that my curiosity in the man was\r\nfirst really stimulated by Mr. Sapsea. Mr. Sapsea’s knowledge of\r\nmankind and power of drawing out whatever is recluse or odd around him,\r\nfirst led to my bestowing a second thought upon the man: though of\r\ncourse I had met him constantly about. You would not be surprised by\r\nthis, Mr. Dean, if you had seen Mr. Sapsea deal with him in his own\r\nparlour, as I did.”\r\n\r\n“O!” cries Sapsea, picking up the ball thrown to him with ineffable\r\ncomplacency and pomposity; “yes, yes. The Very Reverend the Dean refers\r\nto that? Yes. I happened to bring Durdles and Mr. Jasper together. I\r\nregard Durdles as a Character.”\r\n\r\n“A character, Mr. Sapsea, that with a few skilful touches you turn\r\ninside out,” says Jasper.\r\n\r\n“Nay, not quite that,” returns the lumbering auctioneer. “I may have a\r\nlittle influence over him, perhaps; and a little insight into his\r\ncharacter, perhaps. The Very Reverend the Dean will please to bear in\r\nmind that I have seen the world.” Here Mr. Sapsea gets a little behind\r\nthe Dean, to inspect his coat-buttons.\r\n\r\n“Well!” says the Dean, looking about him to see what has become of his\r\ncopyist: “I hope, Mr. Mayor, you will use your study and knowledge of\r\nDurdles to the good purpose of exhorting him not to break our worthy\r\nand respected Choir-Master’s neck; we cannot afford it; his head and\r\nvoice are much too valuable to us.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tope is again highly entertained, and, having fallen into\r\nrespectful convulsions of laughter, subsides into a deferential murmur,\r\nimporting that surely any gentleman would deem it a pleasure and an\r\nhonour to have his neck broken, in return for such a compliment from\r\nsuch a source.\r\n\r\n“I will take it upon myself, sir,” observes Sapsea loftily, “to answer\r\nfor Mr. Jasper’s neck. I will tell Durdles to be careful of it. He will\r\nmind what _I_ say. How is it at present endangered?” he inquires,\r\nlooking about him with magnificent patronage.\r\n\r\n“Only by my making a moonlight expedition with Durdles among the tombs,\r\nvaults, towers, and ruins,” returns Jasper. “You remember suggesting,\r\nwhen you brought us together, that, as a lover of the picturesque, it\r\nmight be worth my while?”\r\n\r\n“I remember!” replies the auctioneer. And the solemn idiot really\r\nbelieves that he does remember.\r\n\r\n“Profiting by your hint,” pursues Jasper, “I have had some day-rambles\r\nwith the extraordinary old fellow, and we are to make a moonlight\r\nhole-and-corner exploration to-night.”\r\n\r\n“And here he is,” says the Dean.\r\n\r\nDurdles with his dinner-bundle in his hand, is indeed beheld slouching\r\ntowards them. Slouching nearer, and perceiving the Dean, he pulls off\r\nhis hat, and is slouching away with it under his arm, when Mr. Sapsea\r\nstops him.\r\n\r\n“Mind you take care of my friend,” is the injunction Mr. Sapsea lays\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n“What friend o’ yourn is dead?” asks Durdles. “No orders has come in\r\nfor any friend o’ yourn.”\r\n\r\n“I mean my live friend there.”\r\n\r\n“O! him?” says Durdles. “He can take care of himself, can Mister\r\nJarsper.”\r\n\r\n“But do you take care of him too,” says Sapsea.\r\n\r\nWhom Durdles (there being command in his tone) surlily surveys from\r\nhead to foot.\r\n\r\n“With submission to his Reverence the Dean, if you’ll mind what\r\nconcerns you, Mr. Sapsea, Durdles he’ll mind what concerns him.”\r\n\r\n“You’re out of temper,” says Mr. Sapsea, winking to the company to\r\nobserve how smoothly he will manage him. “My friend concerns me, and\r\nMr. Jasper is my friend. And you are my friend.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you get into a bad habit of boasting,” retorts Durdles, with a\r\ngrave cautionary nod. “It’ll grow upon you.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Durdles cautions Mr. Sapsea against boasting]\r\n\r\n\r\n“You are out of temper,” says Sapsea again; reddening, but again\r\nsinking to the company.\r\n\r\n“I own to it,” returns Durdles; “I don’t like liberties.”\r\n\r\nMr. Sapsea winks a third wink to the company, as who should say: “I\r\nthink you will agree with me that I have settled _his_ business;” and\r\nstalks out of the controversy.\r\n\r\nDurdles then gives the Dean a good evening, and adding, as he puts his\r\nhat on, “You’ll find me at home, Mister Jarsper, as agreed, when you\r\nwant me; I’m a-going home to clean myself,” soon slouches out of sight.\r\nThis going home to clean himself is one of the man’s incomprehensible\r\ncompromises with inexorable facts; he, and his hat, and his boots, and\r\nhis clothes, never showing any trace of cleaning, but being uniformly\r\nin one condition of dust and grit.\r\n\r\nThe lamplighter now dotting the quiet Close with specks of light, and\r\nrunning at a great rate up and down his little ladder with that\r\nobject—his little ladder under the sacred shadow of whose inconvenience\r\ngenerations had grown up, and which all Cloisterham would have stood\r\naghast at the idea of abolishing—the Dean withdraws to his dinner, Mr.\r\nTope to his tea, and Mr. Jasper to his piano. There, with no light but\r\nthat of the fire, he sits chanting choir-music in a low and beautiful\r\nvoice, for two or three hours; in short, until it has been for some\r\ntime dark, and the moon is about to rise.\r\n\r\nThen he closes his piano softly, softly changes his coat for a\r\npea-jacket, with a goodly wicker-cased bottle in its largest pocket,\r\nand putting on a low-crowned, flap-brimmed hat, goes softly out. Why\r\ndoes he move so softly to-night? No outward reason is apparent for it.\r\nCan there be any sympathetic reason crouching darkly within him?\r\n\r\nRepairing to Durdles’s unfinished house, or hole in the city wall, and\r\nseeing a light within it, he softly picks his course among the\r\ngravestones, monuments, and stony lumber of the yard, already touched\r\nhere and there, sidewise, by the rising moon. The two journeymen have\r\nleft their two great saws sticking in their blocks of stone; and two\r\nskeleton journeymen out of the Dance of Death might be grinning in the\r\nshadow of their sheltering sentry-boxes, about to slash away at cutting\r\nout the gravestones of the next two people destined to die in\r\nCloisterham. Likely enough, the two think little of that now, being\r\nalive, and perhaps merry. Curious, to make a guess at the two;—or say\r\none of the two!\r\n\r\n“Ho! Durdles!”\r\n\r\nThe light moves, and he appears with it at the door. He would seem to\r\nhave been “cleaning himself” with the aid of a bottle, jug, and\r\ntumbler; for no other cleansing instruments are visible in the bare\r\nbrick room with rafters overhead and no plastered ceiling, into which\r\nhe shows his visitor.\r\n\r\n“Are you ready?”\r\n\r\n“I am ready, Mister Jarsper. Let the old ’uns come out if they dare,\r\nwhen we go among their tombs. My spirit is ready for ’em.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean animal spirits, or ardent?”\r\n\r\n“The one’s the t’other,” answers Durdles, “and I mean ’em both.”\r\n\r\nHe takes a lantern from a hook, puts a match or two in his pocket\r\nwherewith to light it, should there be need; and they go out together,\r\ndinner-bundle and all.\r\n\r\nSurely an unaccountable sort of expedition! That Durdles himself, who\r\nis always prowling among old graves, and ruins, like a Ghoul—that he\r\nshould be stealing forth to climb, and dive, and wander without an\r\nobject, is nothing extraordinary; but that the Choir-Master or any one\r\nelse should hold it worth his while to be with him, and to study\r\nmoonlight effects in such company is another affair. Surely an\r\nunaccountable sort of expedition, therefore!\r\n\r\n“’Ware that there mound by the yard-gate, Mister Jarsper.”\r\n\r\n“I see it. What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Lime.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper stops, and waits for him to come up, for he lags behind.\r\n“What you call quick-lime?”\r\n\r\n“Ay!” says Durdles; “quick enough to eat your boots. With a little\r\nhandy stirring, quick enough to eat your bones.”\r\n\r\nThey go on, presently passing the red windows of the Travellers’\r\nTwopenny, and emerging into the clear moonlight of the Monks’ Vineyard.\r\nThis crossed, they come to Minor Canon Corner: of which the greater\r\npart lies in shadow until the moon shall rise higher in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe sound of a closing house-door strikes their ears, and two men come\r\nout. These are Mr. Crisparkle and Neville. Jasper, with a strange and\r\nsudden smile upon his face, lays the palm of his hand upon the breast\r\nof Durdles, stopping him where he stands.\r\n\r\nAt that end of Minor Canon Corner the shadow is profound in the\r\nexisting state of the light: at that end, too, there is a piece of old\r\ndwarf wall, breast high, the only remaining boundary of what was once a\r\ngarden, but is now the thoroughfare. Jasper and Durdles would have\r\nturned this wall in another instant; but, stopping so short, stand\r\nbehind it.\r\n\r\n“Those two are only sauntering,” Jasper whispers; “they will go out\r\ninto the moonlight soon. Let us keep quiet here, or they will detain\r\nus, or want to join us, or what not.”\r\n\r\nDurdles nods assent, and falls to munching some fragments from his\r\nbundle. Jasper folds his arms upon the top of the wall, and, with his\r\nchin resting on them, watches. He takes no note whatever of the Minor\r\nCanon, but watches Neville, as though his eye were at the trigger of a\r\nloaded rifle, and he had covered him, and were going to fire. A sense\r\nof destructive power is so expressed in his face, that even Durdles\r\npauses in his munching, and looks at him, with an unmunched something\r\nin his cheek.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Crisparkle and Neville walk to and fro, quietly talking\r\ntogether. What they say, cannot be heard consecutively; but Mr. Jasper\r\nhas already distinguished his own name more than once.\r\n\r\n“This is the first day of the week,” Mr. Crisparkle can be distinctly\r\nheard to observe, as they turn back; “and the last day of the week is\r\nChristmas Eve.”\r\n\r\n“You may be certain of me, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe echoes were favourable at those points, but as the two approach,\r\nthe sound of their talking becomes confused again. The word\r\n“confidence,” shattered by the echoes, but still capable of being\r\npieced together, is uttered by Mr. Crisparkle. As they draw still\r\nnearer, this fragment of a reply is heard: “Not deserved yet, but shall\r\nbe, sir.” As they turn away again, Jasper again hears his own name, in\r\nconnection with the words from Mr. Crisparkle: “Remember that I said I\r\nanswered for you confidently.” Then the sound of their talk becomes\r\nconfused again; they halting for a little while, and some earnest\r\naction on the part of Neville succeeding. When they move once more, Mr.\r\nCrisparkle is seen to look up at the sky, and to point before him. They\r\nthen slowly disappear; passing out into the moonlight at the opposite\r\nend of the Corner.\r\n\r\nIt is not until they are gone, that Mr. Jasper moves. But then he turns\r\nto Durdles, and bursts into a fit of laughter. Durdles, who still has\r\nthat suspended something in his cheek, and who sees nothing to laugh\r\nat, stares at him until Mr. Jasper lays his face down on his arms to\r\nhave his laugh out. Then Durdles bolts the something, as if desperately\r\nresigning himself to indigestion.\r\n\r\nAmong those secluded nooks there is very little stir or movement after\r\ndark. There is little enough in the high tide of the day, but there is\r\nnext to none at night. Besides that the cheerfully frequented High\r\nStreet lies nearly parallel to the spot (the old Cathedral rising\r\nbetween the two), and is the natural channel in which the Cloisterham\r\ntraffic flows, a certain awful hush pervades the ancient pile, the\r\ncloisters, and the churchyard, after dark, which not many people care\r\nto encounter. Ask the first hundred citizens of Cloisterham, met at\r\nrandom in the streets at noon, if they believed in Ghosts, they would\r\ntell you no; but put them to choose at night between these eerie\r\nPrecincts and the thoroughfare of shops, and you would find that\r\nninety-nine declared for the longer round and the more frequented way.\r\nThe cause of this is not to be found in any local superstition that\r\nattaches to the Precincts—albeit a mysterious lady, with a child in her\r\narms and a rope dangling from her neck, has been seen flitting about\r\nthere by sundry witnesses as intangible as herself—but it is to be\r\nsought in the innate shrinking of dust with the breath of life in it\r\nfrom dust out of which the breath of life has passed; also, in the\r\nwidely diffused, and almost as widely unacknowledged, reflection: “If\r\nthe dead do, under any circumstances, become visible to the living,\r\nthese are such likely surroundings for the purpose that I, the living,\r\nwill get out of them as soon as I can.” Hence, when Mr. Jasper and\r\nDurdles pause to glance around them, before descending into the crypt\r\nby a small side door, of which the latter has a key, the whole expanse\r\nof moonlight in their view is utterly deserted. One might fancy that\r\nthe tide of life was stemmed by Mr. Jasper’s own gatehouse. The murmur\r\nof the tide is heard beyond; but no wave passes the archway, over which\r\nhis lamp burns red behind his curtain, as if the building were a\r\nLighthouse.\r\n\r\nThey enter, locking themselves in, descend the rugged steps, and are\r\ndown in the Crypt. The lantern is not wanted, for the moonlight strikes\r\nin at the groined windows, bare of glass, the broken frames for which\r\ncast patterns on the ground. The heavy pillars which support the roof\r\nengender masses of black shade, but between them there are lanes of\r\nlight. Up and down these lanes they walk, Durdles discoursing of the\r\n“old uns” he yet counts on disinterring, and slapping a wall, in which\r\nhe considers “a whole family on ’em” to be stoned and earthed up, just\r\nas if he were a familiar friend of the family. The taciturnity of\r\nDurdles is for the time overcome by Mr. Jasper’s wicker bottle, which\r\ncirculates freely;—in the sense, that is to say, that its contents\r\nenter freely into Mr. Durdles’s circulation, while Mr. Jasper only\r\nrinses his mouth once, and casts forth the rinsing.\r\n\r\nThey are to ascend the great Tower. On the steps by which they rise to\r\nthe Cathedral, Durdles pauses for new store of breath. The steps are\r\nvery dark, but out of the darkness they can see the lanes of light they\r\nhave traversed. Durdles seats himself upon a step. Mr. Jasper seats\r\nhimself upon another. The odour from the wicker bottle (which has\r\nsomehow passed into Durdles’s keeping) soon intimates that the cork has\r\nbeen taken out; but this is not ascertainable through the sense of\r\nsight, since neither can descry the other. And yet, in talking, they\r\nturn to one another, as though their faces could commune together.\r\n\r\n“This is good stuff, Mister Jarsper!”\r\n\r\n“It is very good stuff, I hope.—I bought it on purpose.”\r\n\r\n“They don’t show, you see, the old uns don’t, Mister Jarsper!”\r\n\r\n“It would be a more confused world than it is, if they could.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it _would_ lead towards a mixing of things,” Durdles acquiesces:\r\npausing on the remark, as if the idea of ghosts had not previously\r\npresented itself to him in a merely inconvenient light, domestically or\r\nchronologically. “But do you think there may be Ghosts of other things,\r\nthough not of men and women?”\r\n\r\n“What things? Flower-beds and watering-pots? Horses and harness?”\r\n\r\n“No. Sounds.”\r\n\r\n“What sounds?”\r\n\r\n“Cries.”\r\n\r\n“What cries do you mean? Chairs to mend?”\r\n\r\n“No. I mean screeches. Now I’ll tell you, Mr. Jarsper. Wait a bit till\r\nI put the bottle right.” Here the cork is evidently taken out again,\r\nand replaced again. “There! _Now_ it’s right! This time last year, only\r\na few days later, I happened to have been doing what was correct by the\r\nseason, in the way of giving it the welcome it had a right to expect,\r\nwhen them town-boys set on me at their worst. At length I gave ’em the\r\nslip, and turned in here. And here I fell asleep. And what woke me? The\r\nghost of a cry. The ghost of one terrific shriek, which shriek was\r\nfollowed by the ghost of the howl of a dog: a long, dismal, woeful\r\nhowl, such as a dog gives when a person’s dead. That was _my_ last\r\nChristmas Eve.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” is the very abrupt, and, one might say, fierce\r\nretort.\r\n\r\n“I mean that I made inquiries everywhere about, and, that no living\r\nears but mine heard either that cry or that howl. So I say they was\r\nboth ghosts; though why they came to me, I’ve never made out.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you were another kind of man,” says Jasper, scornfully.\r\n\r\n“So I thought myself,” answers Durdles with his usual composure; “and\r\nyet I was picked out for it.”\r\n\r\nJasper had risen suddenly, when he asked him what he meant, and he now\r\nsays, “Come; we shall freeze here; lead the way.”\r\n\r\nDurdles complies, not over-steadily; opens the door at the top of the\r\nsteps with the key he has already used; and so emerges on the Cathedral\r\nlevel, in a passage at the side of the chancel. Here, the moonlight is\r\nso very bright again that the colours of the nearest stained-glass\r\nwindow are thrown upon their faces. The appearance of the unconscious\r\nDurdles, holding the door open for his companion to follow, as if from\r\nthe grave, is ghastly enough, with a purple hand across his face, and a\r\nyellow splash upon his brow; but he bears the close scrutiny of his\r\ncompanion in an insensible way, although it is prolonged while the\r\nlatter fumbles among his pockets for a key confided to him that will\r\nopen an iron gate, so to enable them to pass to the staircase of the\r\ngreat tower.\r\n\r\n“That and the bottle are enough for you to carry,” he says, giving it\r\nto Durdles; “hand your bundle to me; I am younger and longer-winded\r\nthan you.” Durdles hesitates for a moment between bundle and bottle;\r\nbut gives the preference to the bottle as being by far the better\r\ncompany, and consigns the dry weight to his fellow-explorer.\r\n\r\nThen they go up the winding staircase of the great tower, toilsomely,\r\nturning and turning, and lowering their heads to avoid the stairs\r\nabove, or the rough stone pivot around which they twist. Durdles has\r\nlighted his lantern, by drawing from the cold, hard wall a spark of\r\nthat mysterious fire which lurks in everything, and, guided by this\r\nspeck, they clamber up among the cobwebs and the dust. Their way lies\r\nthrough strange places. Twice or thrice they emerge into level,\r\nlow-arched galleries, whence they can look down into the moonlit nave;\r\nand where Durdles, waving his lantern, waves the dim angels’ heads upon\r\nthe corbels of the roof, seeming to watch their progress. Anon they\r\nturn into narrower and steeper staircases, and the night-air begins to\r\nblow upon them, and the chirp of some startled jackdaw or frightened\r\nrook precedes the heavy beating of wings in a confined space, and the\r\nbeating down of dust and straws upon their heads. At last, leaving\r\ntheir light behind a stair—for it blows fresh up here—they look down on\r\nCloisterham, fair to see in the moonlight: its ruined habitations and\r\nsanctuaries of the dead, at the tower’s base: its moss-softened\r\nred-tiled roofs and red-brick houses of the living, clustered beyond:\r\nits river winding down from the mist on the horizon, as though that\r\nwere its source, and already heaving with a restless knowledge of its\r\napproach towards the sea.\r\n\r\nOnce again, an unaccountable expedition this! Jasper (always moving\r\nsoftly with no visible reason) contemplates the scene, and especially\r\nthat stillest part of it which the Cathedral overshadows. But he\r\ncontemplates Durdles quite as curiously, and Durdles is by times\r\nconscious of his watchful eyes.\r\n\r\nOnly by times, because Durdles is growing drowsy. As aëronauts lighten\r\nthe load they carry, when they wish to rise, similarly Durdles has\r\nlightened the wicker bottle in coming up. Snatches of sleep surprise\r\nhim on his legs, and stop him in his talk. A mild fit of calenture\r\nseizes him, in which he deems that the ground so far below, is on a\r\nlevel with the tower, and would as lief walk off the tower into the air\r\nas not. Such is his state when they begin to come down. And as\r\naëronauts make themselves heavier when they wish to descend, similarly\r\nDurdles charges himself with more liquid from the wicker bottle, that\r\nhe may come down the better.\r\n\r\nThe iron gate attained and locked—but not before Durdles has tumbled\r\ntwice, and cut an eyebrow open once—they descend into the crypt again,\r\nwith the intent of issuing forth as they entered. But, while returning\r\namong those lanes of light, Durdles becomes so very uncertain, both of\r\nfoot and speech, that he half drops, half throws himself down, by one\r\nof the heavy pillars, scarcely less heavy than itself, and indistinctly\r\nappeals to his companion for forty winks of a second each.\r\n\r\n“If you will have it so, or must have it so,” replies Jasper, “I’ll not\r\nleave you here. Take them, while I walk to and fro.”\r\n\r\nDurdles is asleep at once; and in his sleep he dreams a dream.\r\n\r\nIt is not much of a dream, considering the vast extent of the domains\r\nof dreamland, and their wonderful productions; it is only remarkable\r\nfor being unusually restless and unusually real. He dreams of lying\r\nthere, asleep, and yet counting his companion’s footsteps as he walks\r\nto and fro. He dreams that the footsteps die away into distance of time\r\nand of space, and that something touches him, and that something falls\r\nfrom his hand. Then something clinks and gropes about, and he dreams\r\nthat he is alone for so long a time, that the lanes of light take new\r\ndirections as the moon advances in her course. From succeeding\r\nunconsciousness he passes into a dream of slow uneasiness from cold;\r\nand painfully awakes to a perception of the lanes of light—really\r\nchanged, much as he had dreamed—and Jasper walking among them, beating\r\nhis hands and feet.\r\n\r\n“Holloa!” Durdles cries out, unmeaningly alarmed.\r\n\r\n“Awake at last?” says Jasper, coming up to him. “Do you know that your\r\nforties have stretched into thousands?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“They have though.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the time?”\r\n\r\n“Hark! The bells are going in the Tower!”\r\n\r\nThey strike four quarters, and then the great bell strikes.\r\n\r\n“Two!” cries Durdles, scrambling up; “why didn’t you try to wake me,\r\nMister Jarsper?”\r\n\r\n“I did. I might as well have tried to wake the dead—your own family of\r\ndead, up in the corner there.”\r\n\r\n“Did you touch me?”\r\n\r\n“Touch you! Yes. Shook you.”\r\n\r\nAs Durdles recalls that touching something in his dream, he looks down\r\non the pavement, and sees the key of the crypt door lying close to\r\nwhere he himself lay.\r\n\r\n“I dropped you, did I?” he says, picking it up, and recalling that part\r\nof his dream. As he gathers himself up again into an upright position,\r\nor into a position as nearly upright as he ever maintains, he is again\r\nconscious of being watched by his companion.\r\n\r\n“Well?” says Jasper, smiling, “are you quite ready? Pray don’t hurry.”\r\n\r\n“Let me get my bundle right, Mister Jarsper, and I’m with you.” As he\r\nties it afresh, he is once more conscious that he is very narrowly\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n“What do you suspect me of, Mister Jarsper?” he asks, with drunken\r\ndispleasure. “Let them as has any suspicions of Durdles name ’em.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve no suspicions of you, my good Mr. Durdles; but I have suspicions\r\nthat my bottle was filled with something stiffer than either of us\r\nsupposed. And I also have suspicions,” Jasper adds, taking it from the\r\npavement and turning it bottom upwards, “that it’s empty.”\r\n\r\nDurdles condescends to laugh at this. Continuing to chuckle when his\r\nlaugh is over, as though remonstrant with himself on his drinking\r\npowers, he rolls to the door and unlocks it. They both pass out, and\r\nDurdles relocks it, and pockets his key.\r\n\r\n“A thousand thanks for a curious and interesting night,” says Jasper,\r\ngiving him his hand; “you can make your own way home?”\r\n\r\n“I should think so!” answers Durdles. “If you was to offer Durdles the\r\naffront to show him his way home, he wouldn’t go home.\r\n\r\nDurdles wouldn’t go home till morning;\r\nAnd _then_ Durdles wouldn’t go home,\r\n\r\n\r\nDurdles wouldn’t.” This with the utmost defiance.\r\n\r\n“Good-night, then.”\r\n\r\n“Good-night, Mister Jarsper.”\r\n\r\nEach is turning his own way, when a sharp whistle rends the silence,\r\nand the jargon is yelped out:\r\n\r\nWiddy widdy wen!\r\nI—ket—ches—Im—out—ar—ter—ten.\r\nWiddy widdy wy!\r\nThen—E—don’t—go—then—I—shy—\r\nWiddy Widdy Wake-cock warning!”\r\n\r\n\r\nInstantly afterwards, a rapid fire of stones rattles at the Cathedral\r\nwall, and the hideous small boy is beheld opposite, dancing in the\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\n“What! Is that baby-devil on the watch there!” cries Jasper in a fury:\r\nso quickly roused, and so violent, that he seems an older devil\r\nhimself. “I shall shed the blood of that impish wretch! I know I shall\r\ndo it!” Regardless of the fire, though it hits him more than once, he\r\nrushes at Deputy, collars him, and tries to bring him across. But\r\nDeputy is not to be so easily brought across. With a diabolical insight\r\ninto the strongest part of his position, he is no sooner taken by the\r\nthroat than he curls up his legs, forces his assailant to hang him, as\r\nit were, and gurgles in his throat, and screws his body, and twists, as\r\nalready undergoing the first agonies of strangulation. There is nothing\r\nfor it but to drop him. He instantly gets himself together, backs over\r\nto Durdles, and cries to his assailant, gnashing the great gap in front\r\nof his mouth with rage and malice:\r\n\r\n“I’ll blind yer, s’elp me! I’ll stone yer eyes out, s’elp me! If I\r\ndon’t have yer eyesight, bellows me!” At the same time dodging behind\r\nDurdles, and snarling at Jasper, now from this side of him, and now\r\nfrom that: prepared, if pounced upon, to dart away in all manner of\r\ncurvilinear directions, and, if run down after all, to grovel in the\r\ndust, and cry: “Now, hit me when I’m down! Do it!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t hurt the boy, Mister Jarsper,” urges Durdles, shielding him.\r\n“Recollect yourself.”\r\n\r\n“He followed us to-night, when we first came here!”\r\n\r\n“Yer lie, I didn’t!” replies Deputy, in his one form of polite\r\ncontradiction.\r\n\r\n“He has been prowling near us ever since!”\r\n\r\n“Yer lie, I haven’t,” returns Deputy. “I’d only jist come out for my\r\n’elth when I see you two a-coming out of the Kin-freederel. If\r\n\r\nI—ket—ches—Im—out—ar—ter—ten!”\r\n\r\n\r\n(with the usual rhythm and dance, though dodging behind Durdles), “it\r\nain’t _any_ fault, is it?”\r\n\r\n“Take him home, then,” retorts Jasper, ferociously, though with a\r\nstrong check upon himself, “and let my eyes be rid of the sight of\r\nyou!”\r\n\r\nDeputy, with another sharp whistle, at once expressing his relief, and\r\nhis commencement of a milder stoning of Mr. Durdles, begins stoning\r\nthat respectable gentleman home, as if he were a reluctant ox. Mr.\r\nJasper goes to his gatehouse, brooding. And thus, as everything comes\r\nto an end, the unaccountable expedition comes to an end—for the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nBOTH AT THEIR BEST\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Twinkleton’s establishment was about to undergo a serene hush. The\r\nChristmas recess was at hand. What had once, and at no remote period,\r\nbeen called, even by the erudite Miss Twinkleton herself, “the half,”\r\nbut what was now called, as being more elegant, and more strictly\r\ncollegiate, “the term,” would expire to-morrow. A noticeable relaxation\r\nof discipline had for some few days pervaded the Nuns’ House. Club\r\nsuppers had occurred in the bedrooms, and a dressed tongue had been\r\ncarved with a pair of scissors, and handed round with the curling\r\ntongs. Portions of marmalade had likewise been distributed on a service\r\nof plates constructed of curlpaper; and cowslip wine had been quaffed\r\nfrom the small squat measuring glass in which little Rickitts (a junior\r\nof weakly constitution) took her steel drops daily. The housemaids had\r\nbeen bribed with various fragments of riband, and sundry pairs of shoes\r\nmore or less down at heel, to make no mention of crumbs in the beds;\r\nthe airiest costumes had been worn on these festive occasions; and the\r\ndaring Miss Ferdinand had even surprised the company with a sprightly\r\nsolo on the comb-and-curlpaper, until suffocated in her own pillow by\r\ntwo flowing-haired executioners.\r\n\r\nNor were these the only tokens of dispersal. Boxes appeared in the\r\nbedrooms (where they were capital at other times), and a surprising\r\namount of packing took place, out of all proportion to the amount\r\npacked. Largess, in the form of odds and ends of cold cream and\r\npomatum, and also of hairpins, was freely distributed among the\r\nattendants. On charges of inviolable secrecy, confidences were\r\ninterchanged respecting golden youth of England expected to call, “at\r\nhome,” on the first opportunity. Miss Giggles (deficient in sentiment)\r\ndid indeed profess that she, for her part, acknowledged such homage by\r\nmaking faces at the golden youth; but this young lady was outvoted by\r\nan immense majority.\r\n\r\nOn the last night before a recess, it was always expressly made a point\r\nof honour that nobody should go to sleep, and that Ghosts should be\r\nencouraged by all possible means. This compact invariably broke down,\r\nand all the young ladies went to sleep very soon, and got up very\r\nearly.\r\n\r\nThe concluding ceremony came off at twelve o’clock on the day of\r\ndeparture; when Miss Twinkleton, supported by Mrs. Tisher, held a\r\ndrawing-room in her own apartment (the globes already covered with\r\nbrown Holland), where glasses of white-wine and plates of cut\r\npound-cake were discovered on the table. Miss Twinkleton then said:\r\nLadies, another revolving year had brought us round to that festive\r\nperiod at which the first feelings of our nature bounded in our—Miss\r\nTwinkleton was annually going to add “bosoms,” but annually stopped on\r\nthe brink of that expression, and substituted “hearts.” Hearts; our\r\nhearts. Hem! Again a revolving year, ladies, had brought us to a pause\r\nin our studies—let us hope our greatly advanced studies—and, like the\r\nmariner in his bark, the warrior in his tent, the captive in his\r\ndungeon, and the traveller in his various conveyances, we yearned for\r\nhome. Did we say, on such an occasion, in the opening words of Mr.\r\nAddison’s impressive tragedy:\r\n\r\n“The dawn is overcast, the morning lowers,\r\nAnd heavily in clouds brings on the day,\r\nThe great, th’ important day—?”\r\n\r\n\r\nNot so. From horizon to zenith all was _couleur de rose_, for all was\r\nredolent of our relations and friends. Might _we_ find _them_\r\nprospering as _we_ expected; might _they_ find _us_ prospering as\r\n_they_ expected! Ladies, we would now, with our love to one another,\r\nwish one another good-bye, and happiness, until we met again. And when\r\nthe time should come for our resumption of those pursuits which (here a\r\ngeneral depression set in all round), pursuits which, pursuits\r\nwhich;—then let us ever remember what was said by the Spartan General,\r\nin words too trite for repetition, at the battle it were superfluous to\r\nspecify.\r\n\r\nThe handmaidens of the establishment, in their best caps, then handed\r\nthe trays, and the young ladies sipped and crumbled, and the bespoken\r\ncoaches began to choke the street. Then leave-taking was not long\r\nabout; and Miss Twinkleton, in saluting each young lady’s cheek,\r\nconfided to her an exceedingly neat letter, addressed to her next\r\nfriend at law, “with Miss Twinkleton’s best compliments” in the corner.\r\nThis missive she handed with an air as if it had not the least\r\nconnexion with the bill, but were something in the nature of a delicate\r\nand joyful surprise.\r\n\r\nSo many times had Rosa seen such dispersals, and so very little did she\r\nknow of any other Home, that she was contented to remain where she was,\r\nand was even better contented than ever before, having her latest\r\nfriend with her. And yet her latest friendship had a blank place in it\r\nof which she could not fail to be sensible. Helena Landless, having\r\nbeen a party to her brother’s revelation about Rosa, and having entered\r\ninto that compact of silence with Mr. Crisparkle, shrank from any\r\nallusion to Edwin Drood’s name. Why she so avoided it, was mysterious\r\nto Rosa, but she perfectly perceived the fact. But for the fact, she\r\nmight have relieved her own little perplexed heart of some of its\r\ndoubts and hesitations, by taking Helena into her confidence. As it\r\nwas, she had no such vent: she could only ponder on her own\r\ndifficulties, and wonder more and more why this avoidance of Edwin’s\r\nname should last, now that she knew—for so much Helena had told\r\nher—that a good understanding was to be reëstablished between the two\r\nyoung men, when Edwin came down.\r\n\r\nIt would have made a pretty picture, so many pretty girls kissing Rosa\r\nin the cold porch of the Nuns’ House, and that sunny little creature\r\npeeping out of it (unconscious of sly faces carved on spout and gable\r\npeeping at her), and waving farewells to the departing coaches, as if\r\nshe represented the spirit of rosy youth abiding in the place to keep\r\nit bright and warm in its desertion. The hoarse High Street became\r\nmusical with the cry, in various silvery voices, “Good-bye, Rosebud\r\ndarling!” and the effigy of Mr. Sapsea’s father over the opposite\r\ndoorway seemed to say to mankind: “Gentlemen, favour me with your\r\nattention to this charming little last lot left behind, and bid with a\r\nspirit worthy of the occasion!” Then the staid street, so unwontedly\r\nsparkling, youthful, and fresh for a few rippling moments, ran dry, and\r\nCloisterham was itself again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Good-bye, Rosebud darling”]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Rosebud in her bower now waited Edwin Drood’s coming with an uneasy\r\nheart, Edwin for his part was uneasy too. With far less force of\r\npurpose in his composition than the childish beauty, crowned by\r\nacclamation fairy queen of Miss Twinkleton’s establishment, he had a\r\nconscience, and Mr. Grewgious had pricked it. That gentleman’s steady\r\nconvictions of what was right and what was wrong in such a case as his,\r\nwere neither to be frowned aside nor laughed aside. They would not be\r\nmoved. But for the dinner in Staple Inn, and but for the ring he\r\ncarried in the breast pocket of his coat, he would have drifted into\r\ntheir wedding-day without another pause for real thought, loosely\r\ntrusting that all would go well, left alone. But that serious putting\r\nhim on his truth to the living and the dead had brought him to a check.\r\nHe must either give the ring to Rosa, or he must take it back. Once put\r\ninto this narrowed way of action, it was curious that he began to\r\nconsider Rosa’s claims upon him more unselfishly than he had ever\r\nconsidered them before, and began to be less sure of himself than he\r\nhad ever been in all his easy-going days.\r\n\r\n“I will be guided by what she says, and by how we get on,” was his\r\ndecision, walking from the gatehouse to the Nuns’ House. “Whatever\r\ncomes of it, I will bear his words in mind, and try to be true to the\r\nliving and the dead.”\r\n\r\nRosa was dressed for walking. She expected him. It was a bright, frosty\r\nday, and Miss Twinkleton had already graciously sanctioned fresh air.\r\nThus they got out together before it became necessary for either Miss\r\nTwinkleton, or the deputy high-priest Mrs. Tisher, to lay even so much\r\nas one of those usual offerings on the shrine of Propriety.\r\n\r\n“My dear Eddy,” said Rosa, when they had turned out of the High Street,\r\nand had got among the quiet walks in the neighbourhood of the Cathedral\r\nand the river: “I want to say something very serious to you. I have\r\nbeen thinking about it for a long, long time.”\r\n\r\n“I want to be serious with you too, Rosa dear. I mean to be serious and\r\nearnest.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Eddy. And you will not think me unkind because I begin,\r\nwill you? You will not think I speak for myself only, because I speak\r\nfirst? That would not be generous, would it? And I know you are\r\ngenerous!”\r\n\r\nHe said, “I hope I am not ungenerous to you, Rosa.” He called her Pussy\r\nno more. Never again.\r\n\r\n“And there is no fear,” pursued Rosa, “of our quarrelling, is there?\r\nBecause, Eddy,” clasping her hand on his arm, “we have so much reason\r\nto be very lenient to each other!”\r\n\r\n“We will be, Rosa.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a dear good boy! Eddy, let us be courageous. Let us change to\r\nbrother and sister from this day forth.”\r\n\r\n“Never be husband and wife?”\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\nNeither spoke again for a little while. But after that pause he said,\r\nwith some effort:\r\n\r\n“Of course I know that this has been in both our minds, Rosa, and of\r\ncourse I am in honour bound to confess freely that it does not\r\noriginate with you.”\r\n\r\n“No, nor with you, dear,” she returned, with pathetic earnestness.\r\n“That sprung up between us. You are not truly happy in our engagement;\r\nI am not truly happy in it. O, I am so sorry, so sorry!” And there she\r\nbroke into tears.\r\n\r\n“I am deeply sorry too, Rosa. Deeply sorry for you.”\r\n\r\n“And I for you, poor boy! And I for you!”\r\n\r\nThis pure young feeling, this gentle and forbearing feeling of each\r\ntowards the other, brought with it its reward in a softening light that\r\nseemed to shine on their position. The relations between them did not\r\nlook wilful, or capricious, or a failure, in such a light; they became\r\nelevated into something more self-denying, honourable, affectionate,\r\nand true.\r\n\r\n“If we knew yesterday,” said Rosa, as she dried her eyes, “and we did\r\nknow yesterday, and on many, many yesterdays, that we were far from\r\nright together in those relations which were not of our own choosing,\r\nwhat better could we do to-day than change them? It is natural that we\r\nshould be sorry, and you see how sorry we both are; but how much better\r\nto be sorry now than then!”\r\n\r\n“When, Rosa?”\r\n\r\n“When it would be too late. And then we should be angry, besides.”\r\n\r\nAnother silence fell upon them.\r\n\r\n“And you know,” said Rosa innocently, “you couldn’t like me then; and\r\nyou can always like me now, for I shall not be a drag upon you, or a\r\nworry to you. And I can always like you now, and your sister will not\r\ntease or trifle with you. I often did when I was not your sister, and I\r\nbeg your pardon for it.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t let us come to that, Rosa; or I shall want more pardoning than I\r\nlike to think of.”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed, Eddy; you are too hard, my generous boy, upon yourself.\r\nLet us sit down, brother, on these ruins, and let me tell you how it\r\nwas with us. I think I know, for I have considered about it very much\r\nsince you were here last time. You liked me, didn’t you? You thought I\r\nwas a nice little thing?”\r\n\r\n“Everybody thinks that, Rosa.”\r\n\r\n“Do they?” She knitted her brow musingly for a moment, and then flashed\r\nout with the bright little induction: “Well, but say they do. Surely it\r\nwas not enough that you should think of me only as other people did;\r\nnow, was it?”\r\n\r\nThe point was not to be got over. It was not enough.\r\n\r\n“And that is just what I mean; that is just how it was with us,” said\r\nRosa. “You liked me very well, and you had grown used to me, and had\r\ngrown used to the idea of our being married. You accepted the situation\r\nas an inevitable kind of thing, didn’t you? It was to be, you thought,\r\nand why discuss or dispute it?”\r\n\r\nIt was new and strange to him to have himself presented to himself so\r\nclearly, in a glass of her holding up. He had always patronised her, in\r\nhis superiority to her share of woman’s wit. Was that but another\r\ninstance of something radically amiss in the terms on which they had\r\nbeen gliding towards a life-long bondage?\r\n\r\n“All this that I say of you is true of me as well, Eddy. Unless it was,\r\nI might not be bold enough to say it. Only, the difference between us\r\nwas, that by little and little there crept into my mind a habit of\r\nthinking about it, instead of dismissing it. My life is not so busy as\r\nyours, you see, and I have not so many things to think of. So I thought\r\nabout it very much, and I cried about it very much too (though that was\r\nnot your fault, poor boy); when all at once my guardian came down, to\r\nprepare for my leaving the Nuns’ House. I tried to hint to him that I\r\nwas not quite settled in my mind, but I hesitated and failed, and he\r\ndidn’t understand me. But he is a good, good man. And he put before me\r\nso kindly, and yet so strongly, how seriously we ought to consider, in\r\nour circumstances, that I resolved to speak to you the next moment we\r\nwere alone and grave. And if I seemed to come to it easily just now,\r\nbecause I came to it all at once, don’t think it was so really, Eddy,\r\nfor O, it was very, very hard, and O, I am very, very sorry!”\r\n\r\nHer full heart broke into tears again. He put his arm about her waist,\r\nand they walked by the river-side together.\r\n\r\n“Your guardian has spoken to me too, Rosa dear. I saw him before I left\r\nLondon.” His right hand was in his breast, seeking the ring; but he\r\nchecked it, as he thought: “If I am to take it back, why should I tell\r\nher of it?”\r\n\r\n“And that made you more serious about it, didn’t it, Eddy? And if I had\r\nnot spoken to you, as I have, you would have spoken to me? I hope you\r\ncan tell me so? I don’t like it to be _all_ my doing, though it _is_ so\r\nmuch better for us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I should have spoken; I should have put everything before you; I\r\ncame intending to do it. But I never could have spoken to you as you\r\nhave spoken to me, Rosa.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t say you mean so coldly or unkindly, Eddy, please, if you can\r\nhelp it.”\r\n\r\n“I mean so sensibly and delicately, so wisely and affectionately.”\r\n\r\n“That’s my dear brother!” She kissed his hand in a little rapture. “The\r\ndear girls will be dreadfully disappointed,” added Rosa, laughing, with\r\nthe dewdrops glistening in her bright eyes. “They have looked forward\r\nto it so, poor pets!”\r\n\r\n“Ah! but I fear it will be a worse disappointment to Jack,” said Edwin\r\nDrood, with a start. “I never thought of Jack!”\r\n\r\nHer swift and intent look at him as he said the words could no more be\r\nrecalled than a flash of lightning can. But it appeared as though she\r\nwould have instantly recalled it, if she could; for she looked down,\r\nconfused, and breathed quickly.\r\n\r\n“You don’t doubt its being a blow to Jack, Rosa?”\r\n\r\nShe merely replied, and that evasively and hurriedly: Why should she?\r\nShe had not thought about it. He seemed, to her, to have so little to\r\ndo with it.\r\n\r\n“My dear child! can you suppose that any one so wrapped up in\r\nanother—Mrs. Tope’s expression: not mine—as Jack is in me, could fail\r\nto be struck all of a heap by such a sudden and complete change in my\r\nlife? I say sudden, because it will be sudden to _him_, you know.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded twice or thrice, and her lips parted as if she would have\r\nassented. But she uttered no sound, and her breathing was no slower.\r\n\r\n“How shall I tell Jack?” said Edwin, ruminating. If he had been less\r\noccupied with the thought, he must have seen her singular emotion. “I\r\nnever thought of Jack. It must be broken to him, before the town-crier\r\nknows it. I dine with the dear fellow to-morrow and next day—Christmas\r\nEve and Christmas Day—but it would never do to spoil his feast-days. He\r\nalways worries about me, and moddley-coddleys in the merest trifles.\r\nThe news is sure to overset him. How on earth shall this be broken to\r\nJack?”\r\n\r\n“He must be told, I suppose?” said Rosa.\r\n\r\n“My dear Rosa! who ought to be in our confidence, if not Jack?”\r\n\r\n“My guardian promised to come down, if I should write and ask him. I am\r\ngoing to do so. Would you like to leave it to him?”\r\n\r\n“A bright idea!” cried Edwin. “The other trustee. Nothing more natural.\r\nHe comes down, he goes to Jack, he relates what we have agreed upon,\r\nand he states our case better than we could. He has already spoken\r\nfeelingly to you, he has already spoken feelingly to me, and he’ll put\r\nthe whole thing feelingly to Jack. That’s it! I am not a coward, Rosa,\r\nbut to tell you a secret, I am a little afraid of Jack.”\r\n\r\n“No, no! you are not afraid of him!” cried Rosa, turning white, and\r\nclasping her hands.\r\n\r\n“Why, sister Rosa, sister Rosa, what do you see from the turret?” said\r\nEdwin, rallying her. “My dear girl!”\r\n\r\n“You frightened me.”\r\n\r\n“Most unintentionally, but I am as sorry as if I had meant to do it.\r\nCould you possibly suppose for a moment, from any loose way of speaking\r\nof mine, that I was literally afraid of the dear fond fellow? What I\r\nmean is, that he is subject to a kind of paroxysm, or fit—I saw him in\r\nit once—and I don’t know but that so great a surprise, coming upon him\r\ndirect from me whom he is so wrapped up in, might bring it on perhaps.\r\nWhich—and this is the secret I was going to tell you—is another reason\r\nfor your guardian’s making the communication. He is so steady, precise,\r\nand exact, that he will talk Jack’s thoughts into shape, in no time:\r\nwhereas with me Jack is always impulsive and hurried, and, I may say,\r\nalmost womanish.”\r\n\r\nRosa seemed convinced. Perhaps from her own very different point of\r\nview of “Jack,” she felt comforted and protected by the interposition\r\nof Mr. Grewgious between herself and him.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Edwin Drood’s right hand closed again upon the ring in its\r\nlittle case, and again was checked by the consideration: “It is\r\ncertain, now, that I am to give it back to him; then why should I tell\r\nher of it?” That pretty sympathetic nature which could be so sorry for\r\nhim in the blight of their childish hopes of happiness together, and\r\ncould so quietly find itself alone in a new world to weave fresh\r\nwreaths of such flowers as it might prove to bear, the old world’s\r\nflowers being withered, would be grieved by those sorrowful jewels; and\r\nto what purpose? Why should it be? They were but a sign of broken joys\r\nand baseless projects; in their very beauty they were (as the\r\nunlikeliest of men had said) almost a cruel satire on the loves, hopes,\r\nplans, of humanity, which are able to forecast nothing, and are so much\r\nbrittle dust. Let them be. He would restore them to her guardian when\r\nhe came down; he in his turn would restore them to the cabinet from\r\nwhich he had unwillingly taken them; and there, like old letters or old\r\nvows, or other records of old aspirations come to nothing, they would\r\nbe disregarded, until, being valuable, they were sold into circulation\r\nagain, to repeat their former round.\r\n\r\nLet them be. Let them lie unspoken of, in his breast. However\r\ndistinctly or indistinctly he entertained these thoughts, he arrived at\r\nthe conclusion, Let them be. Among the mighty store of wonderful chains\r\nthat are for ever forging, day and night, in the vast iron-works of\r\ntime and circumstance, there was one chain forged in the moment of that\r\nsmall conclusion, riveted to the foundations of heaven and earth, and\r\ngifted with invincible force to hold and drag.\r\n\r\nThey walked on by the river. They began to speak of their separate\r\nplans. He would quicken his departure from England, and she would\r\nremain where she was, at least as long as Helena remained. The poor\r\ndear girls should have their disappointment broken to them gently, and,\r\nas the first preliminary, Miss Twinkleton should be confided in by\r\nRosa, even in advance of the reappearance of Mr. Grewgious. It should\r\nbe made clear in all quarters that she and Edwin were the best of\r\nfriends. There had never been so serene an understanding between them\r\nsince they were first affianced. And yet there was one reservation on\r\neach side; on hers, that she intended through her guardian to withdraw\r\nherself immediately from the tuition of her music-master; on his, that\r\nhe did already entertain some wandering speculations whether it might\r\never come to pass that he would know more of Miss Landless.\r\n\r\nThe bright, frosty day declined as they walked and spoke together. The\r\nsun dipped in the river far behind them, and the old city lay red\r\nbefore them, as their walk drew to a close. The moaning water cast its\r\nseaweed duskily at their feet, when they turned to leave its margin;\r\nand the rooks hovered above them with hoarse cries, darker splashes in\r\nthe darkening air.\r\n\r\n“I will prepare Jack for my flitting soon,” said Edwin, in a low voice,\r\n“and I will but see your guardian when he comes, and then go before\r\nthey speak together. It will be better done without my being by. Don’t\r\nyou think so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“We know we have done right, Rosa?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“We know we are better so, even now?”\r\n\r\n“And shall be far, far better so by-and-by.”\r\n\r\nStill there was that lingering tenderness in their hearts towards the\r\nold positions they were relinquishing, that they prolonged their\r\nparting. When they came among the elm-trees by the Cathedral, where\r\nthey had last sat together, they stopped as by consent, and Rosa raised\r\nher face to his, as she had never raised it in the old days;—for they\r\nwere old already.\r\n\r\n“God bless you, dear! Good-bye!”\r\n\r\n“God bless you, dear! Good-bye!”\r\n\r\nThey kissed each other fervently.\r\n\r\n“Now, please take me home, Eddy, and let me be by myself.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t look round, Rosa,” he cautioned her, as he drew her arm through\r\nhis, and led her away. “Didn’t you see Jack?”\r\n\r\n“No! Where?”\r\n\r\n“Under the trees. He saw us, as we took leave of each other. Poor\r\nfellow! he little thinks we have parted. This will be a blow to him, I\r\nam much afraid!”\r\n\r\nShe hurried on, without resting, and hurried on until they had passed\r\nunder the gatehouse into the street; once there, she asked:\r\n\r\n“Has he followed us? You can look without seeming to. Is he behind?”\r\n\r\n“No. Yes, he is! He has just passed out under the gateway. The dear,\r\nsympathetic old fellow likes to keep us in sight. I am afraid he will\r\nbe bitterly disappointed!”\r\n\r\nShe pulled hurriedly at the handle of the hoarse old bell, and the gate\r\nsoon opened. Before going in, she gave him one last, wide, wondering\r\nlook, as if she would have asked him with imploring emphasis: “O! don’t\r\nyou understand?” And out of that look he vanished from her view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nWHEN SHALL THESE THREE MEET AGAIN?\r\n\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve in Cloisterham. A few strange faces in the streets; a few\r\nother faces, half strange and half familiar, once the faces of\r\nCloisterham children, now the faces of men and women who come back from\r\nthe outer world at long intervals to find the city wonderfully shrunken\r\nin size, as if it had not washed by any means well in the meanwhile. To\r\nthese, the striking of the Cathedral clock, and the cawing of the rooks\r\nfrom the Cathedral tower, are like voices of their nursery time. To\r\nsuch as these, it has happened in their dying hours afar off, that they\r\nhave imagined their chamber-floor to be strewn with the autumnal leaves\r\nfallen from the elm-trees in the Close: so have the rustling sounds and\r\nfresh scents of their earliest impressions revived when the circle of\r\ntheir lives was very nearly traced, and the beginning and the end were\r\ndrawing close together.\r\n\r\nSeasonable tokens are about. Red berries shine here and there in the\r\nlattices of Minor Canon Corner; Mr. and Mrs. Tope are daintily sticking\r\nsprigs of holly into the carvings and sconces of the Cathedral stalls,\r\nas if they were sticking them into the coat-button-holes of the Dean\r\nand Chapter. Lavish profusion is in the shops: particularly in the\r\narticles of currants, raisins, spices, candied peel, and moist sugar.\r\nAn unusual air of gallantry and dissipation is abroad; evinced in an\r\nimmense bunch of mistletoe hanging in the greengrocer’s shop doorway,\r\nand a poor little Twelfth Cake, culminating in the figure of a\r\nHarlequin—such a very poor little Twelfth Cake, that one would rather\r\ncalled it a Twenty-fourth Cake or a Forty-eighth Cake—to be raffled for\r\nat the pastrycook’s, terms one shilling per member. Public amusements\r\nare not wanting. The Wax-Work which made so deep an impression on the\r\nreflective mind of the Emperor of China is to be seen by particular\r\ndesire during Christmas Week only, on the premises of the bankrupt\r\nlivery-stable-keeper up the lane; and a new grand comic Christmas\r\npantomime is to be produced at the Theatre: the latter heralded by the\r\nportrait of Signor Jacksonini the clown, saying “How do you do\r\nto-morrow?” quite as large as life, and almost as miserably. In short,\r\nCloisterham is up and doing: though from this description the High\r\nSchool and Miss Twinkleton’s are to be excluded. From the former\r\nestablishment the scholars have gone home, every one of them in love\r\nwith one of Miss Twinkleton’s young ladies (who knows nothing about\r\nit); and only the handmaidens flutter occasionally in the windows of\r\nthe latter. It is noticed, by the bye, that these damsels become,\r\nwithin the limits of decorum, more skittish when thus intrusted with\r\nthe concrete representation of their sex, than when dividing the\r\nrepresentation with Miss Twinkleton’s young ladies.\r\n\r\nThree are to meet at the gatehouse to-night. How does each one of the\r\nthree get through the day?\r\n\r\nNeville Landless, though absolved from his books for the time by Mr.\r\nCrisparkle—whose fresh nature is by no means insensible to the charms\r\nof a holiday—reads and writes in his quiet room, with a concentrated\r\nair, until it is two hours past noon. He then sets himself to clearing\r\nhis table, to arranging his books, and to tearing up and burning his\r\nstray papers. He makes a clean sweep of all untidy accumulations, puts\r\nall his drawers in order, and leaves no note or scrap of paper\r\nundestroyed, save such memoranda as bear directly on his studies. This\r\ndone, he turns to his wardrobe, selects a few articles of ordinary\r\nwear—among them, change of stout shoes and socks for walking—and packs\r\nthese in a knapsack. This knapsack is new, and he bought it in the High\r\nStreet yesterday. He also purchased, at the same time and at the same\r\nplace, a heavy walking-stick; strong in the handle for the grip of the\r\nhand, and iron-shod. He tries this, swings it, poises it, and lays it\r\nby, with the knapsack, on a window-seat. By this time his arrangements\r\nare complete.\r\n\r\nHe dresses for going out, and is in the act of going—indeed has left\r\nhis room, and has met the Minor Canon on the staircase, coming out of\r\nhis bedroom upon the same story—when he turns back again for his\r\nwalking-stick, thinking he will carry it now. Mr. Crisparkle, who has\r\npaused on the staircase, sees it in his hand on his immediately\r\nreappearing, takes it from him, and asks him with a smile how he\r\nchooses a stick?\r\n\r\n“Really I don’t know that I understand the subject,” he answers. “I\r\nchose it for its weight.”\r\n\r\n“Much too heavy, Neville; _much_ too heavy.”\r\n\r\n“To rest upon in a long walk, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Rest upon?” repeats Mr. Crisparkle, throwing himself into pedestrian\r\nform. “You don’t rest upon it; you merely balance with it.”\r\n\r\n“I shall know better, with practice, sir. I have not lived in a walking\r\ncountry, you know.”\r\n\r\n“True,” says Mr. Crisparkle. “Get into a little training, and we will\r\nhave a few score miles together. I should leave you nowhere now. Do you\r\ncome back before dinner?”\r\n\r\n“I think not, as we dine early.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle gives him a bright nod and a cheerful good-bye;\r\nexpressing (not without intention) absolute confidence and ease.\r\n\r\nNeville repairs to the Nuns’ House, and requests that Miss Landless may\r\nbe informed that her brother is there, by appointment. He waits at the\r\ngate, not even crossing the threshold; for he is on his parole not to\r\nput himself in Rosa’s way.\r\n\r\nHis sister is at least as mindful of the obligation they have taken on\r\nthemselves as he can be, and loses not a moment in joining him. They\r\nmeet affectionately, avoid lingering there, and walk towards the upper\r\ninland country.\r\n\r\n“I am not going to tread upon forbidden ground, Helena,” says Neville,\r\nwhen they have walked some distance and are turning; “you will\r\nunderstand in another moment that I cannot help referring to—what shall\r\nI say?—my infatuation.”\r\n\r\n“Had you not better avoid it, Neville? You know that I can hear\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\n“You can hear, my dear, what Mr. Crisparkle has heard, and heard with\r\napproval.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I can hear so much.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it is this. I am not only unsettled and unhappy myself, but I am\r\nconscious of unsettling and interfering with other people. How do I\r\nknow that, but for my unfortunate presence, you, and—and—the rest of\r\nthat former party, our engaging guardian excepted, might be dining\r\ncheerfully in Minor Canon Corner to-morrow? Indeed it probably would be\r\nso. I can see too well that I am not high in the old lady’s opinion,\r\nand it is easy to understand what an irksome clog I must be upon the\r\nhospitalities of her orderly house—especially at this time of year—when\r\nI must be kept asunder from this person, and there is such a reason for\r\nmy not being brought into contact with that person, and an unfavourable\r\nreputation has preceded me with such another person; and so on. I have\r\nput this very gently to Mr. Crisparkle, for you know his self-denying\r\nways; but still I have put it. What I have laid much greater stress\r\nupon at the same time is, that I am engaged in a miserable struggle\r\nwith myself, and that a little change and absence may enable me to come\r\nthrough it the better. So, the weather being bright and hard, I am\r\ngoing on a walking expedition, and intend taking myself out of\r\neverybody’s way (my own included, I hope) to-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\n“When to come back?”\r\n\r\n“In a fortnight.”\r\n\r\n“And going quite alone?”\r\n\r\n“I am much better without company, even if there were any one but you\r\nto bear me company, my dear Helena.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Crisparkle entirely agrees, you say?”\r\n\r\n“Entirely. I am not sure but that at first he was inclined to think it\r\nrather a moody scheme, and one that might do a brooding mind harm. But\r\nwe took a moonlight walk last Monday night, to talk it over at leisure,\r\nand I represented the case to him as it really is. I showed him that I\r\ndo want to conquer myself, and that, this evening well got over, it is\r\nsurely better that I should be away from here just now, than here. I\r\ncould hardly help meeting certain people walking together here, and\r\nthat could do no good, and is certainly not the way to forget. A\r\nfortnight hence, that chance will probably be over, for the time; and\r\nwhen it again arises for the last time, why, I can again go away.\r\nFarther, I really do feel hopeful of bracing exercise and wholesome\r\nfatigue. You know that Mr. Crisparkle allows such things their full\r\nweight in the preservation of his own sound mind in his own sound body,\r\nand that his just spirit is not likely to maintain one set of natural\r\nlaws for himself and another for me. He yielded to my view of the\r\nmatter, when convinced that I was honestly in earnest; and so, with his\r\nfull consent, I start to-morrow morning. Early enough to be not only\r\nout of the streets, but out of hearing of the bells, when the good\r\npeople go to church.”\r\n\r\nHelena thinks it over, and thinks well of it. Mr. Crisparkle doing so,\r\nshe would do so; but she does originally, out of her own mind, think\r\nwell of it, as a healthy project, denoting a sincere endeavour and an\r\nactive attempt at self-correction. She is inclined to pity him, poor\r\nfellow, for going away solitary on the great Christmas festival; but\r\nshe feels it much more to the purpose to encourage him. And she does\r\nencourage him.\r\n\r\nHe will write to her?\r\n\r\nHe will write to her every alternate day, and tell her all his\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nDoes he send clothes on in advance of him?\r\n\r\n“My dear Helena, no. Travel like a pilgrim, with wallet and staff. My\r\nwallet—or my knapsack—is packed, and ready for strapping on; and here\r\nis my staff!”\r\n\r\nHe hands it to her; she makes the same remark as Mr. Crisparkle, that\r\nit is very heavy; and gives it back to him, asking what wood it is?\r\nIron-wood.\r\n\r\nUp to this point he has been extremely cheerful. Perhaps, the having to\r\ncarry his case with her, and therefore to present it in its brightest\r\naspect, has roused his spirits. Perhaps, the having done so with\r\nsuccess, is followed by a revulsion. As the day closes in, and the\r\ncity-lights begin to spring up before them, he grows depressed.\r\n\r\n“I wish I were not going to this dinner, Helena.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Neville, is it worth while to care much about it? Think how soon\r\nit will be over.”\r\n\r\n“How soon it will be over!” he repeats gloomily. “Yes. But I don’t like\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThere may be a moment’s awkwardness, she cheeringly represents to him,\r\nbut it can only last a moment. He is quite sure of himself.\r\n\r\n“I wish I felt as sure of everything else, as I feel of myself,” he\r\nanswers her.\r\n\r\n“How strangely you speak, dear! What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Helena, I don’t know. I only know that I don’t like it. What a strange\r\ndead weight there is in the air!”\r\n\r\nShe calls his attention to those copperous clouds beyond the river, and\r\nsays that the wind is rising. He scarcely speaks again, until he takes\r\nleave of her, at the gate of the Nuns’ House. She does not immediately\r\nenter, when they have parted, but remains looking after him along the\r\nstreet. Twice he passes the gatehouse, reluctant to enter. At length,\r\nthe Cathedral clock chiming one quarter, with a rapid turn he hurries\r\nin.\r\n\r\nAnd so _he_ goes up the postern stair.\r\n\r\nEdwin Drood passes a solitary day. Something of deeper moment than he\r\nhad thought, has gone out of his life; and in the silence of his own\r\nchamber he wept for it last night. Though the image of Miss Landless\r\nstill hovers in the background of his mind, the pretty little\r\naffectionate creature, so much firmer and wiser than he had supposed,\r\noccupies its stronghold. It is with some misgiving of his own\r\nunworthiness that he thinks of her, and of what they might have been to\r\none another, if he had been more in earnest some time ago; if he had\r\nset a higher value on her; if, instead of accepting his lot in life as\r\nan inheritance of course, he had studied the right way to its\r\nappreciation and enhancement. And still, for all this, and though there\r\nis a sharp heartache in all this, the vanity and caprice of youth\r\nsustain that handsome figure of Miss Landless in the background of his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThat was a curious look of Rosa’s when they parted at the gate. Did it\r\nmean that she saw below the surface of his thoughts, and down into\r\ntheir twilight depths? Scarcely that, for it was a look of astonished\r\nand keen inquiry. He decides that he cannot understand it, though it\r\nwas remarkably expressive.\r\n\r\nAs he only waits for Mr. Grewgious now, and will depart immediately\r\nafter having seen him, he takes a sauntering leave of the ancient city\r\nand its neighbourhood. He recalls the time when Rosa and he walked here\r\nor there, mere children, full of the dignity of being engaged. Poor\r\nchildren! he thinks, with a pitying sadness.\r\n\r\nFinding that his watch has stopped, he turns into the jeweller’s shop,\r\nto have it wound and set. The jeweller is knowing on the subject of a\r\nbracelet, which he begs leave to submit, in a general and quite aimless\r\nway. It would suit (he considers) a young bride, to perfection;\r\nespecially if of a rather diminutive style of beauty. Finding the\r\nbracelet but coldly looked at, the jeweller invites attention to a tray\r\nof rings for gentlemen; here is a style of ring, now, he remarks—a very\r\nchaste signet—which gentlemen are much given to purchasing, when\r\nchanging their condition. A ring of a very responsible appearance. With\r\nthe date of their wedding-day engraved inside, several gentlemen have\r\npreferred it to any other kind of memento.\r\n\r\nThe rings are as coldly viewed as the bracelet. Edwin tells the tempter\r\nthat he wears no jewellery but his watch and chain, which were his\r\nfather’s; and his shirt-pin.\r\n\r\n“That I was aware of,” is the jeweller’s reply, “for Mr. Jasper dropped\r\nin for a watch-glass the other day, and, in fact, I showed these\r\narticles to him, remarking that if he _should_ wish to make a present\r\nto a gentleman relative, on any particular occasion—But he said with a\r\nsmile that he had an inventory in his mind of all the jewellery his\r\ngentleman relative ever wore; namely, his watch and chain, and his\r\nshirt-pin.” Still (the jeweller considers) that might not apply to all\r\ntimes, though applying to the present time. “Twenty minutes past two,\r\nMr. Drood, I set your watch at. Let me recommend you not to let it run\r\ndown, sir.”\r\n\r\nEdwin takes his watch, puts it on, and goes out, thinking: “Dear old\r\nJack! If I were to make an extra crease in my neckcloth, he would think\r\nit worth noticing!”\r\n\r\nHe strolls about and about, to pass the time until the dinner-hour. It\r\nsomehow happens that Cloisterham seems reproachful to him to-day; has\r\nfault to find with him, as if he had not used it well; but is far more\r\npensive with him than angry. His wonted carelessness is replaced by a\r\nwistful looking at, and dwelling upon, all the old landmarks. He will\r\nsoon be far away, and may never see them again, he thinks. Poor youth!\r\nPoor youth!\r\n\r\nAs dusk draws on, he paces the Monks’ Vineyard. He has walked to and\r\nfro, full half an hour by the Cathedral chimes, and it has closed in\r\ndark, before he becomes quite aware of a woman crouching on the ground\r\nnear a wicket gate in a corner. The gate commands a cross bye-path,\r\nlittle used in the gloaming; and the figure must have been there all\r\nthe time, though he has but gradually and lately made it out.\r\n\r\nHe strikes into that path, and walks up to the wicket. By the light of\r\na lamp near it, he sees that the woman is of a haggard appearance, and\r\nthat her weazen chin is resting on her hands, and that her eyes are\r\nstaring—with an unwinking, blind sort of steadfastness—before her.\r\n\r\nAlways kindly, but moved to be unusually kind this evening, and having\r\nbestowed kind words on most of the children and aged people he has met,\r\nhe at once bends down, and speaks to this woman.\r\n\r\n“Are you ill?”\r\n\r\n“No, deary,” she answers, without looking at him, and with no departure\r\nfrom her strange blind stare.\r\n\r\n“Are you blind?”\r\n\r\n“No, deary.”\r\n\r\n“Are you lost, homeless, faint? What is the matter, that you stay here\r\nin the cold so long, without moving?”\r\n\r\nBy slow and stiff efforts, she appears to contract her vision until it\r\ncan rest upon him; and then a curious film passes over her, and she\r\nbegins to shake.\r\n\r\nHe straightens himself, recoils a step, and looks down at her in a\r\ndread amazement; for he seems to know her.\r\n\r\n“Good Heaven!” he thinks, next moment. “Like Jack that night!”\r\n\r\nAs he looks down at her, she looks up at him, and whimpers: “My lungs\r\nis weakly; my lungs is dreffle bad. Poor me, poor me, my cough is\r\nrattling dry!” and coughs in confirmation horribly.\r\n\r\n“Where do you come from?”\r\n\r\n“Come from London, deary.” (Her cough still rending her.)\r\n\r\n“Where are you going to?”\r\n\r\n“Back to London, deary. I came here, looking for a needle in a\r\nhaystack, and I ain’t found it. Look’ee, deary; give me\r\nthree-and-sixpence, and don’t you be afeard for me. I’ll get back to\r\nLondon then, and trouble no one. I’m in a business.—Ah, me! It’s slack,\r\nit’s slack, and times is very bad!—but I can make a shift to live by\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Do you eat opium?”\r\n\r\n“Smokes it,” she replies with difficulty, still racked by her cough.\r\n“Give me three-and-sixpence, and I’ll lay it out well, and get back. If\r\nyou don’t give me three-and-sixpence, don’t give me a brass farden. And\r\nif you do give me three-and-sixpence, deary, I’ll tell you something.”\r\n\r\nHe counts the money from his pocket, and puts it in her hand. She\r\ninstantly clutches it tight, and rises to her feet with a croaking\r\nlaugh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“Bless ye! Hark’ee, dear genl’mn. What’s your Chris’en name?”\r\n\r\n“Edwin.”\r\n\r\n“Edwin, Edwin, Edwin,” she repeats, trailing off into a drowsy\r\nrepetition of the word; and then asks suddenly: “Is the short of that\r\nname Eddy?”\r\n\r\n“It is sometimes called so,” he replies, with the colour starting to\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n“Don’t sweethearts call it so?” she asks, pondering.\r\n\r\n“How should I know?”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you a sweetheart, upon your soul?”\r\n\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\nShe is moving away, with another “Bless ye, and thank’ee, deary!” when\r\nhe adds: “You were to tell me something; you may as well do so.”\r\n\r\n“So I was, so I was. Well, then. Whisper. You be thankful that your\r\nname ain’t Ned.”\r\n\r\nHe looks at her quite steadily, as he asks: “Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because it’s a bad name to have just now.”\r\n\r\n“How a bad name?”\r\n\r\n“A threatened name. A dangerous name.”\r\n\r\n“The proverb says that threatened men live long,” he tells her,\r\nlightly.\r\n\r\n“Then Ned—so threatened is he, wherever he may be while I am a-talking\r\nto you, deary—should live to all eternity!” replies the woman.\r\n\r\nShe has leaned forward to say it in his ear, with her forefinger\r\nshaking before his eyes, and now huddles herself together, and with\r\nanother “Bless ye, and thank’ee!” goes away in the direction of the\r\nTravellers’ Lodging House.\r\n\r\nThis is not an inspiriting close to a dull day. Alone, in a sequestered\r\nplace, surrounded by vestiges of old time and decay, it rather has a\r\ntendency to call a shudder into being. He makes for the better-lighted\r\nstreets, and resolves as he walks on to say nothing of this to-night,\r\nbut to mention it to Jack (who alone calls him Ned), as an odd\r\ncoincidence, to-morrow; of course only as a coincidence, and not as\r\nanything better worth remembering.\r\n\r\nStill, it holds to him, as many things much better worth remembering\r\nnever did. He has another mile or so, to linger out before the\r\ndinner-hour; and, when he walks over the bridge and by the river, the\r\nwoman’s words are in the rising wind, in the angry sky, in the troubled\r\nwater, in the flickering lights. There is some solemn echo of them even\r\nin the Cathedral chime, which strikes a sudden surprise to his heart as\r\nhe turns in under the archway of the gatehouse.\r\n\r\nAnd so _he_ goes up the postern stair.\r\n\r\nJohn Jasper passes a more agreeable and cheerful day than either of his\r\nguests. Having no music-lessons to give in the holiday season, his time\r\nis his own, but for the Cathedral services. He is early among the\r\nshopkeepers, ordering little table luxuries that his nephew likes. His\r\nnephew will not be with him long, he tells his provision-dealers, and\r\nso must be petted and made much of. While out on his hospitable\r\npreparations, he looks in on Mr. Sapsea; and mentions that dear Ned,\r\nand that inflammable young spark of Mr. Crisparkle’s, are to dine at\r\nthe gatehouse to-day, and make up their difference. Mr. Sapsea is by no\r\nmeans friendly towards the inflammable young spark. He says that his\r\ncomplexion is “Un-English.” And when Mr. Sapsea has once declared\r\nanything to be Un-English, he considers that thing everlastingly sunk\r\nin the bottomless pit.\r\n\r\nJohn Jasper is truly sorry to hear Mr. Sapsea speak thus, for he knows\r\nright well that Mr. Sapsea never speaks without a meaning, and that he\r\nhas a subtle trick of being right. Mr. Sapsea (by a very remarkable\r\ncoincidence) is of exactly that opinion.\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper is in beautiful voice this day. In the pathetic supplication\r\nto have his heart inclined to keep this law, he quite astonishes his\r\nfellows by his melodious power. He has never sung difficult music with\r\nsuch skill and harmony, as in this day’s Anthem. His nervous\r\ntemperament is occasionally prone to take difficult music a little too\r\nquickly; to-day, his time is perfect.\r\n\r\nThese results are probably attained through a grand composure of the\r\nspirits. The mere mechanism of his throat is a little tender, for he\r\nwears, both with his singing-robe and with his ordinary dress, a large\r\nblack scarf of strong close-woven silk, slung loosely round his neck.\r\nBut his composure is so noticeable, that Mr. Crisparkle speaks of it as\r\nthey come out from Vespers.\r\n\r\n“I must thank you, Jasper, for the pleasure with which I have heard you\r\nto-day. Beautiful! Delightful! You could not have so outdone yourself,\r\nI hope, without being wonderfully well.”\r\n\r\n“I _am_ wonderfully well.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing unequal,” says the Minor Canon, with a smooth motion of his\r\nhand: “nothing unsteady, nothing forced, nothing avoided; all\r\nthoroughly done in a masterly manner, with perfect self-command.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. I hope so, if it is not too much to say.”\r\n\r\n“One would think, Jasper, you had been trying a new medicine for that\r\noccasional indisposition of yours.”\r\n\r\n“No, really? That’s well observed; for I have.”\r\n\r\n“Then stick to it, my good fellow,” says Mr. Crisparkle, clapping him\r\non the shoulder with friendly encouragement, “stick to it.”\r\n\r\n“I will.”\r\n\r\n“I congratulate you,” Mr. Crisparkle pursues, as they come out of the\r\nCathedral, “on all accounts.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you again. I will walk round to the Corner with you, if you\r\ndon’t object; I have plenty of time before my company come; and I want\r\nto say a word to you, which I think you will not be displeased to\r\nhear.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Well. We were speaking, the other evening, of my black humours.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle’s face falls, and he shakes his head deploringly.\r\n\r\n“I said, you know, that I should make you an antidote to those black\r\nhumours; and you said you hoped I would consign them to the flames.”\r\n\r\n“And I still hope so, Jasper.”\r\n\r\n“With the best reason in the world! I mean to burn this year’s Diary at\r\nthe year’s end.”\r\n\r\n“Because you—?” Mr. Crisparkle brightens greatly as he thus begins.\r\n\r\n“You anticipate me. Because I feel that I have been out of sorts,\r\ngloomy, bilious, brain-oppressed, whatever it may be. You said I had\r\nbeen exaggerative. So I have.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle’s brightened face brightens still more.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t see it then, because I _was_ out of sorts; but I am in a\r\nhealthier state now, and I acknowledge it with genuine pleasure. I made\r\na great deal of a very little; that’s the fact.”\r\n\r\n“It does me good,” cries Mr. Crisparkle, “to hear you say it!”\r\n\r\n“A man leading a monotonous life,” Jasper proceeds, “and getting his\r\nnerves, or his stomach, out of order, dwells upon an idea until it\r\nloses its proportions. That was my case with the idea in question. So I\r\nshall burn the evidence of my case, when the book is full, and begin\r\nthe next volume with a clearer vision.”\r\n\r\n“This is better,” says Mr. Crisparkle, stopping at the steps of his own\r\ndoor to shake hands, “than I could have hoped.”\r\n\r\n“Why, naturally,” returns Jasper. “You had but little reason to hope\r\nthat I should become more like yourself. You are always training\r\nyourself to be, mind and body, as clear as crystal, and you always are,\r\nand never change; whereas I am a muddy, solitary, moping weed. However,\r\nI have got over that mope. Shall I wait, while you ask if Mr. Neville\r\nhas left for my place? If not, he and I may walk round together.”\r\n\r\n“I think,” says Mr. Crisparkle, opening the entrance-door with his key,\r\n“that he left some time ago; at least I know he left, and I think he\r\nhas not come back. But I’ll inquire. You won’t come in?”\r\n\r\n“My company wait,” said Jasper, with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe Minor Canon disappears, and in a few moments returns. As he\r\nthought, Mr. Neville has not come back; indeed, as he remembers now,\r\nMr. Neville said he would probably go straight to the gatehouse.\r\n\r\n“Bad manners in a host!” says Jasper. “My company will be there before\r\nme! What will you bet that I don’t find my company embracing?”\r\n\r\n“I will bet—or I would, if ever I did bet,” returns Mr. Crisparkle,\r\n“that your company will have a gay entertainer this evening.”\r\n\r\nJasper nods, and laughs good-night!\r\n\r\nHe retraces his steps to the Cathedral door, and turns down past it to\r\nthe gatehouse. He sings, in a low voice and with delicate expression,\r\nas he walks along. It still seems as if a false note were not within\r\nhis power to-night, and as if nothing could hurry or retard him.\r\nArriving thus under the arched entrance of his dwelling, he pauses for\r\nan instant in the shelter to pull off that great black scarf, and bang\r\nit in a loop upon his arm. For that brief time, his face is knitted and\r\nstern. But it immediately clears, as he resumes his singing, and his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nAnd so _he_ goes up the postern stair.\r\n\r\nThe red light burns steadily all the evening in the lighthouse on the\r\nmargin of the tide of busy life. Softened sounds and hum of traffic\r\npass it and flow on irregularly into the lonely Precincts; but very\r\nlittle else goes by, save violent rushes of wind. It comes on to blow a\r\nboisterous gale.\r\n\r\nThe Precincts are never particularly well lighted; but the strong\r\nblasts of wind blowing out many of the lamps (in some instances\r\nshattering the frames too, and bringing the glass rattling to the\r\nground), they are unusually dark to-night. The darkness is augmented\r\nand confused, by flying dust from the earth, dry twigs from the trees,\r\nand great ragged fragments from the rooks’ nests up in the tower. The\r\ntrees themselves so toss and creak, as this tangible part of the\r\ndarkness madly whirls about, that they seem in peril of being torn out\r\nof the earth: while ever and again a crack, and a rushing fall, denote\r\nthat some large branch has yielded to the storm.\r\n\r\nNot such power of wind has blown for many a winter night. Chimneys\r\ntopple in the streets, and people hold to posts and corners, and to one\r\nanother, to keep themselves upon their feet. The violent rushes abate\r\nnot, but increase in frequency and fury until at midnight, when the\r\nstreets are empty, the storm goes thundering along them, rattling at\r\nall the latches, and tearing at all the shutters, as if warning the\r\npeople to get up and fly with it, rather than have the roofs brought\r\ndown upon their brains.\r\n\r\nStill, the red light burns steadily. Nothing is steady but the red\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nAll through the night the wind blows, and abates not. But early in the\r\nmorning, when there is barely enough light in the east to dim the\r\nstars, it begins to lull. From that time, with occasional wild charges,\r\nlike a wounded monster dying, it drops and sinks; and at full daylight\r\nit is dead.\r\n\r\nIt is then seen that the hands of the Cathedral clock are torn off;\r\nthat lead from the roof has been stripped away, rolled up, and blown\r\ninto the Close; and that some stones have been displaced upon the\r\nsummit of the great tower. Christmas morning though it be, it is\r\nnecessary to send up workmen, to ascertain the extent of the damage\r\ndone. These, led by Durdles, go aloft; while Mr. Tope and a crowd of\r\nearly idlers gather down in Minor Canon Corner, shading their eyes and\r\nwatching for their appearance up there.\r\n\r\nThis cluster is suddenly broken and put aside by the hands of Mr.\r\nJasper; all the gazing eyes are brought down to the earth by his loudly\r\ninquiring of Mr. Crisparkle, at an open window:\r\n\r\n“Where is my nephew?”\r\n\r\n“He has not been here. Is he not with you?”\r\n\r\n“No. He went down to the river last night, with Mr. Neville, to look at\r\nthe storm, and has not been back. Call Mr. Neville!”\r\n\r\n“He left this morning, early.”\r\n\r\n“Left this morning early? Let me in! let me in!”\r\n\r\nThere is no more looking up at the tower, now. All the assembled eyes\r\nare turned on Mr. Jasper, white, half-dressed, panting, and clinging to\r\nthe rail before the Minor Canon’s house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nIMPEACHED\r\n\r\n\r\nNeville Landless had started so early and walked at so good a pace,\r\nthat when the church-bells began to ring in Cloisterham for morning\r\nservice, he was eight miles away. As he wanted his breakfast by that\r\ntime, having set forth on a crust of bread, he stopped at the next\r\nroadside tavern to refresh.\r\n\r\nVisitors in want of breakfast—unless they were horses or cattle, for\r\nwhich class of guests there was preparation enough in the way of\r\nwater-trough and hay—were so unusual at the sign of The Tilted Wagon,\r\nthat it took a long time to get the wagon into the track of tea and\r\ntoast and bacon. Neville in the interval, sitting in a sanded parlour,\r\nwondering in how long a time after he had gone, the sneezy fire of damp\r\nfagots would begin to make somebody else warm.\r\n\r\nIndeed, The Tilted Wagon, as a cool establishment on the top of a hill,\r\nwhere the ground before the door was puddled with damp hoofs and\r\ntrodden straw; where a scolding landlady slapped a moist baby (with one\r\nred sock on and one wanting), in the bar; where the cheese was cast\r\naground upon a shelf, in company with a mouldy tablecloth and a\r\ngreen-handled knife, in a sort of cast-iron canoe; where the pale-faced\r\nbread shed tears of crumb over its shipwreck in another canoe; where\r\nthe family linen, half washed and half dried, led a public life of\r\nlying about; where everything to drink was drunk out of mugs, and\r\neverything else was suggestive of a rhyme to mugs; The Tilted Wagon,\r\nall these things considered, hardly kept its painted promise of\r\nproviding good entertainment for Man and Beast. However, Man, in the\r\npresent case, was not critical, but took what entertainment he could\r\nget, and went on again after a longer rest than he needed.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at some quarter of a mile from the house, hesitating whether\r\nto pursue the road, or to follow a cart track between two high\r\nhedgerows, which led across the slope of a breezy heath, and evidently\r\nstruck into the road again by-and-by. He decided in favour of this\r\nlatter track, and pursued it with some toil; the rise being steep, and\r\nthe way worn into deep ruts.\r\n\r\nHe was labouring along, when he became aware of some other pedestrians\r\nbehind him. As they were coming up at a faster pace than his, he stood\r\naside, against one of the high banks, to let them pass. But their\r\nmanner was very curious. Only four of them passed. Other four slackened\r\nspeed, and loitered as intending to follow him when he should go on.\r\nThe remainder of the party (half-a-dozen perhaps) turned, and went back\r\nat a great rate.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the four behind him, and he looked at the four before him.\r\nThey all returned his look. He resumed his way. The four in advance\r\nwent on, constantly looking back; the four in the rear came closing up.\r\n\r\nWhen they all ranged out from the narrow track upon the open slope of\r\nthe heath, and this order was maintained, let him diverge as he would\r\nto either side, there was no longer room to doubt that he was beset by\r\nthese fellows. He stopped, as a last test; and they all stopped.\r\n\r\n“Why do you attend upon me in this way?” he asked the whole body. “Are\r\nyou a pack of thieves?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t answer him,” said one of the number; he did not see which.\r\n“Better be quiet.”\r\n\r\n“Better be quiet?” repeated Neville. “Who said so?”\r\n\r\nNobody replied.\r\n\r\n“It’s good advice, whichever of you skulkers gave it,” he went on\r\nangrily. “I will not submit to be penned in between four men there, and\r\nfour men there. I wish to pass, and I mean to pass, those four in\r\nfront.”\r\n\r\nThey were all standing still; himself included.\r\n\r\n“If eight men, or four men, or two men, set upon one,” he proceeded,\r\ngrowing more enraged, “the one has no chance but to set his mark upon\r\nsome of them. And, by the Lord, I’ll do it, if I am interrupted any\r\nfarther!”\r\n\r\nShouldering his heavy stick, and quickening his pace, he shot on to\r\npass the four ahead. The largest and strongest man of the number\r\nchanged swiftly to the side on which he came up, and dexterously closed\r\nwith him and went down with him; but not before the heavy stick had\r\ndescended smartly.\r\n\r\n“Let him be!” said this man in a suppressed voice, as they struggled\r\ntogether on the grass. “Fair play! His is the build of a girl to mine,\r\nand he’s got a weight strapped to his back besides. Let him alone. I’ll\r\nmanage him.”\r\n\r\nAfter a little rolling about, in a close scuffle which caused the faces\r\nof both to be besmeared with blood, the man took his knee from\r\nNeville’s chest, and rose, saying: “There! Now take him arm-in-arm, any\r\ntwo of you!”\r\n\r\nIt was immediately done.\r\n\r\n“As to our being a pack of thieves, Mr. Landless,” said the man, as he\r\nspat out some blood, and wiped more from his face; “you know better\r\nthan that at midday. We wouldn’t have touched you if you hadn’t forced\r\nus. We’re going to take you round to the high road, anyhow, and you’ll\r\nfind help enough against thieves there, if you want it.—Wipe his face,\r\nsomebody; see how it’s a-trickling down him!”\r\n\r\nWhen his face was cleansed, Neville recognised in the speaker, Joe,\r\ndriver of the Cloisterham omnibus, whom he had seen but once, and that\r\non the day of his arrival.\r\n\r\n“And what I recommend you for the present, is, don’t talk, Mr.\r\nLandless. You’ll find a friend waiting for you, at the high road—gone\r\nahead by the other way when we split into two parties—and you had much\r\nbetter say nothing till you come up with him. Bring that stick along,\r\nsomebody else, and let’s be moving!”\r\n\r\nUtterly bewildered, Neville stared around him and said not a word.\r\nWalking between his two conductors, who held his arms in theirs, he\r\nwent on, as in a dream, until they came again into the high road, and\r\ninto the midst of a little group of people. The men who had turned back\r\nwere among the group; and its central figures were Mr. Jasper and Mr.\r\nCrisparkle. Neville’s conductors took him up to the Minor Canon, and\r\nthere released him, as an act of deference to that gentleman.\r\n\r\n“What is all this, sir? What is the matter? I feel as if I had lost my\r\nsenses!” cried Neville, the group closing in around him.\r\n\r\n“Where is my nephew?” asked Mr. Jasper, wildly.\r\n\r\n“Where is your nephew?” repeated Neville, “Why do you ask me?”\r\n\r\n“I ask you,” retorted Jasper, “because you were the last person in his\r\ncompany, and he is not to be found.”\r\n\r\n“Not to be found!” cried Neville, aghast.\r\n\r\n“Stay, stay,” said Mr. Crisparkle. “Permit me, Jasper. Mr. Neville, you\r\nare confounded; collect your thoughts; it is of great importance that\r\nyou should collect your thoughts; attend to me.”\r\n\r\n“I will try, sir, but I seem mad.”\r\n\r\n“You left Mr. Jasper last night with Edwin Drood?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“At what hour?”\r\n\r\n“Was it at twelve o’clock?” asked Neville, with his hand to his\r\nconfused head, and appealing to Jasper.\r\n\r\n“Quite right,” said Mr. Crisparkle; “the hour Mr. Jasper has already\r\nnamed to me. You went down to the river together?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly. To see the action of the wind there.”\r\n\r\n“What followed? How long did you stay there?”\r\n\r\n“About ten minutes; I should say not more. We then walked together to\r\nyour house, and he took leave of me at the door.”\r\n\r\n“Did he say that he was going down to the river again?”\r\n\r\n“No. He said that he was going straight back.”\r\n\r\nThe bystanders looked at one another, and at Mr. Crisparkle. To whom\r\nMr. Jasper, who had been intensely watching Neville, said, in a low,\r\ndistinct, suspicious voice: “What are those stains upon his dress?”\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned towards the blood upon his clothes.\r\n\r\n“And here are the same stains upon this stick!” said Jasper, taking it\r\nfrom the hand of the man who held it. “I know the stick to be his, and\r\nhe carried it last night. What does this mean?”\r\n\r\n“In the name of God, say what it means, Neville!” urged Mr. Crisparkle.\r\n\r\n“That man and I,” said Neville, pointing out his late adversary, “had a\r\nstruggle for the stick just now, and you may see the same marks on him,\r\nsir. What was I to suppose, when I found myself molested by eight\r\npeople? Could I dream of the true reason when they would give me none\r\nat all?”\r\n\r\nThey admitted that they had thought it discreet to be silent, and that\r\nthe struggle had taken place. And yet the very men who had seen it\r\nlooked darkly at the smears which the bright cold air had already\r\ndried.\r\n\r\n“We must return, Neville,” said Mr. Crisparkle; “of course you will be\r\nglad to come back to clear yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Landless will walk at my side,” the Minor Canon continued, looking\r\naround him. “Come, Neville!”\r\n\r\nThey set forth on the walk back; and the others, with one exception,\r\nstraggled after them at various distances. Jasper walked on the other\r\nside of Neville, and never quitted that position. He was silent, while\r\nMr. Crisparkle more than once repeated his former questions, and while\r\nNeville repeated his former answers; also, while they both hazarded\r\nsome explanatory conjectures. He was obstinately silent, because Mr.\r\nCrisparkle’s manner directly appealed to him to take some part in the\r\ndiscussion, and no appeal would move his fixed face. When they drew\r\nnear to the city, and it was suggested by the Minor Canon that they\r\nmight do well in calling on the Mayor at once, he assented with a stern\r\nnod; but he spake no word until they stood in Mr. Sapsea’s parlour.\r\n\r\nMr. Sapsea being informed by Mr. Crisparkle of the circumstances under\r\nwhich they desired to make a voluntary statement before him, Mr. Jasper\r\nbroke silence by declaring that he placed his whole reliance, humanly\r\nspeaking, on Mr. Sapsea’s penetration. There was no conceivable reason\r\nwhy his nephew should have suddenly absconded, unless Mr. Sapsea could\r\nsuggest one, and then he would defer. There was no intelligible\r\nlikelihood of his having returned to the river, and been accidentally\r\ndrowned in the dark, unless it should appear likely to Mr. Sapsea, and\r\nthen again he would defer. He washed his hands as clean as he could of\r\nall horrible suspicions, unless it should appear to Mr. Sapsea that\r\nsome such were inseparable from his last companion before his\r\ndisappearance (not on good terms with previously), and then, once more,\r\nhe would defer. His own state of mind, he being distracted with doubts,\r\nand labouring under dismal apprehensions, was not to be safely trusted;\r\nbut Mr. Sapsea’s was.\r\n\r\nMr. Sapsea expressed his opinion that the case had a dark look; in\r\nshort (and here his eyes rested full on Neville’s countenance), an\r\nUn-English complexion. Having made this grand point, he wandered into a\r\ndenser haze and maze of nonsense than even a mayor might have been\r\nexpected to disport himself in, and came out of it with the brilliant\r\ndiscovery that to take the life of a fellow-creature was to take\r\nsomething that didn’t belong to you. He wavered whether or no he should\r\nat once issue his warrant for the committal of Neville Landless to\r\njail, under circumstances of grave suspicion; and he might have gone so\r\nfar as to do it but for the indignant protest of the Minor Canon: who\r\nundertook for the young man’s remaining in his own house, and being\r\nproduced by his own hands, whenever demanded. Mr. Jasper then\r\nunderstood Mr. Sapsea to suggest that the river should be dragged, that\r\nits banks should be rigidly examined, that particulars of the\r\ndisappearance should be sent to all outlying places and to London, and\r\nthat placards and advertisements should be widely circulated imploring\r\nEdwin Drood, if for any unknown reason he had withdrawn himself from\r\nhis uncle’s home and society, to take pity on that loving kinsman’s\r\nsore bereavement and distress, and somehow inform him that he was yet\r\nalive. Mr. Sapsea was perfectly understood, for this was exactly his\r\nmeaning (though he had said nothing about it); and measures were taken\r\ntowards all these ends immediately.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to determine which was the more oppressed with\r\nhorror and amazement: Neville Landless, or John Jasper. But that\r\nJasper’s position forced him to be active, while Neville’s forced him\r\nto be passive, there would have been nothing to choose between them.\r\nEach was bowed down and broken.\r\n\r\nWith the earliest light of the next morning, men were at work upon the\r\nriver, and other men—most of whom volunteered for the service—were\r\nexamining the banks. All the livelong day the search went on; upon the\r\nriver, with barge and pole, and drag and net; upon the muddy and rushy\r\nshore, with jack-boots, hatchet, spade, rope, dogs, and all imaginable\r\nappliances. Even at night, the river was specked with lanterns, and\r\nlurid with fires; far-off creeks, into which the tide washed as it\r\nchanged, had their knots of watchers, listening to the lapping of the\r\nstream, and looking out for any burden it might bear; remote shingly\r\ncauseways near the sea, and lonely points off which there was a race of\r\nwater, had their unwonted flaring cressets and rough-coated figures\r\nwhen the next day dawned; but no trace of Edwin Drood revisited the\r\nlight of the sun.\r\n\r\nAll that day, again, the search went on. Now, in barge and boat; and\r\nnow ashore among the osiers, or tramping amidst mud and stakes and\r\njagged stones in low-lying places, where solitary watermarks and\r\nsignals of strange shapes showed like spectres, John Jasper worked and\r\ntoiled. But to no purpose; for still no trace of Edwin Drood revisited\r\nthe light of the sun.\r\n\r\nSetting his watches for that night again, so that vigilant eyes should\r\nbe kept on every change of tide, he went home exhausted. Unkempt and\r\ndisordered, bedaubed with mud that had dried upon him, and with much of\r\nhis clothing torn to rags, he had but just dropped into his easy-chair,\r\nwhen Mr. Grewgious stood before him.\r\n\r\n“This is strange news,” said Mr. Grewgious.\r\n\r\n“Strange and fearful news.”\r\n\r\nJasper had merely lifted up his heavy eyes to say it, and now dropped\r\nthem again as he drooped, worn out, over one side of his easy-chair.\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious smoothed his head and face, and stood looking at the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n“How is your ward?” asked Jasper, after a time, in a faint, fatigued\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n“Poor little thing! You may imagine her condition.”\r\n\r\n“Have you seen his sister?” inquired Jasper, as before.\r\n\r\n“Whose?”\r\n\r\nThe curtness of the counter-question, and the cool, slow manner in\r\nwhich, as he put it, Mr. Grewgious moved his eyes from the fire to his\r\ncompanion’s face, might at any other time have been exasperating. In\r\nhis depression and exhaustion, Jasper merely opened his eyes to say:\r\n“The suspected young man’s.”\r\n\r\n“Do you suspect him?” asked Mr. Grewgious.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what to think. I cannot make up my mind.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I,” said Mr. Grewgious. “But as you spoke of him as the suspected\r\nyoung man, I thought you _had_ made up your mind.—I have just left Miss\r\nLandless.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Grewgious has his suspicions]\r\n\r\n\r\n“What is her state?”\r\n\r\n“Defiance of all suspicion, and unbounded faith in her brother.”\r\n\r\n“Poor thing!”\r\n\r\n“However,” pursued Mr. Grewgious, “it is not of her that I came to\r\nspeak. It is of my ward. I have a communication to make that will\r\nsurprise you. At least, it has surprised me.”\r\n\r\nJasper, with a groaning sigh, turned wearily in his chair.\r\n\r\n“Shall I put it off till to-morrow?” said Mr. Grewgious. “Mind, I warn\r\nyou, that I think it will surprise you!”\r\n\r\nMore attention and concentration came into John Jasper’s eyes as they\r\ncaught sight of Mr. Grewgious smoothing his head again, and again\r\nlooking at the fire; but now, with a compressed and determined mouth.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” demanded Jasper, becoming upright in his chair.\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” said Mr. Grewgious, provokingly slowly and internally, as\r\nhe kept his eyes on the fire: “I might have known it sooner; she gave\r\nme the opening; but I am such an exceedingly Angular man, that it never\r\noccurred to me; I took all for granted.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” demanded Jasper once more.\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious, alternately opening and shutting the palms of his hands\r\nas he warmed them at the fire, and looking fixedly at him sideways, and\r\nnever changing either his action or his look in all that followed, went\r\non to reply.\r\n\r\n“This young couple, the lost youth and Miss Rosa, my ward, though so\r\nlong betrothed, and so long recognising their betrothal, and so near\r\nbeing married—”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious saw a staring white face, and two quivering white lips,\r\nin the easy-chair, and saw two muddy hands gripping its sides. But for\r\nthe hands, he might have thought he had never seen the face.\r\n\r\n“—This young couple came gradually to the discovery (made on both sides\r\npretty equally, I think), that they would be happier and better, both\r\nin their present and their future lives, as affectionate friends, or\r\nsay rather as brother and sister, than as husband and wife.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious saw a lead-coloured face in the easy-chair, and on its\r\nsurface dreadful starting drops or bubbles, as if of steel.\r\n\r\n“This young couple formed at length the healthy resolution of\r\ninterchanging their discoveries, openly, sensibly, and tenderly. They\r\nmet for that purpose. After some innocent and generous talk, they\r\nagreed to dissolve their existing, and their intended, relations, for\r\never and ever.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious saw a ghastly figure rise, open-mouthed, from the\r\neasy-chair, and lift its outspread hands towards its head.\r\n\r\n“One of this young couple, and that one your nephew, fearful, however,\r\nthat in the tenderness of your affection for him you would be bitterly\r\ndisappointed by so wide a departure from his projected life, forbore to\r\ntell you the secret, for a few days, and left it to be disclosed by me,\r\nwhen I should come down to speak to you, and he would be gone. I speak\r\nto you, and he is gone.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious saw the ghastly figure throw back its head, clutch its\r\nhair with its hands, and turn with a writhing action from him.\r\n\r\n“I have now said all I have to say: except that this young couple\r\nparted, firmly, though not without tears and sorrow, on the evening\r\nwhen you last saw them together.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious heard a terrible shriek, and saw no ghastly figure,\r\nsitting or standing; saw nothing but a heap of torn and miry clothes\r\nupon the floor.\r\n\r\nNot changing his action even then, he opened and shut the palms of his\r\nhands as he warmed them, and looked down at it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nDEVOTED\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen John Jasper recovered from his fit or swoon, he found himself\r\nbeing tended by Mr. and Mrs. Tope, whom his visitor had summoned for\r\nthe purpose. His visitor, wooden of aspect, sat stiffly in a chair,\r\nwith his hands upon his knees, watching his recovery.\r\n\r\n“There! You’ve come to nicely now, sir,” said the tearful Mrs. Tope;\r\n“you were thoroughly worn out, and no wonder!”\r\n\r\n“A man,” said Mr. Grewgious, with his usual air of repeating a lesson,\r\n“cannot have his rest broken, and his mind cruelly tormented, and his\r\nbody overtaxed by fatigue, without being thoroughly worn out.”\r\n\r\n“I fear I have alarmed you?” Jasper apologised faintly, when he was\r\nhelped into his easy-chair.\r\n\r\n“Not at all, I thank you,” answered Mr. Grewgious.\r\n\r\n“You are too considerate.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, I thank you,” answered Mr. Grewgious again.\r\n\r\n“You must take some wine, sir,” said Mrs. Tope, “and the jelly that I\r\nhad ready for you, and that you wouldn’t put your lips to at noon,\r\nthough I warned you what would come of it, you know, and you not\r\nbreakfasted; and you must have a wing of the roast fowl that has been\r\nput back twenty times if it’s been put back once. It shall all be on\r\ntable in five minutes, and this good gentleman belike will stop and see\r\nyou take it.”\r\n\r\nThis good gentleman replied with a snort, which might mean yes, or no,\r\nor anything or nothing, and which Mrs. Tope would have found highly\r\nmystifying, but that her attention was divided by the service of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n“You will take something with me?” said Jasper, as the cloth was laid.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t get a morsel down my throat, I thank you,” answered Mr.\r\nGrewgious.\r\n\r\nJasper both ate and drank almost voraciously. Combined with the hurry\r\nin his mode of doing it, was an evident indifference to the taste of\r\nwhat he took, suggesting that he ate and drank to fortify himself\r\nagainst any other failure of the spirits, far more than to gratify his\r\npalate. Mr. Grewgious in the meantime sat upright, with no expression\r\nin his face, and a hard kind of imperturbably polite protest all over\r\nhim: as though he would have said, in reply to some invitation to\r\ndiscourse; “I couldn’t originate the faintest approach to an\r\nobservation on any subject whatever, I thank you.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” said Jasper, when he had pushed away his plate and\r\nglass, and had sat meditating for a few minutes: “do you know that I\r\nfind some crumbs of comfort in the communication with which you have so\r\nmuch amazed me?”\r\n\r\n“_Do_ you?” returned Mr. Grewgious, pretty plainly adding the unspoken\r\nclause: “I don’t, I thank you!”\r\n\r\n“After recovering from the shock of a piece of news of my dear boy, so\r\nentirely unexpected, and so destructive of all the castles I had built\r\nfor him; and after having had time to think of it; yes.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be glad to pick up your crumbs,” said Mr. Grewgious, dryly.\r\n\r\n“Is there not, or is there—if I deceive myself, tell me so, and shorten\r\nmy pain—is there not, or is there, hope that, finding himself in this\r\nnew position, and becoming sensitively alive to the awkward burden of\r\nexplanation, in this quarter, and that, and the other, with which it\r\nwould load him, he avoided the awkwardness, and took to flight?”\r\n\r\n“Such a thing might be,” said Mr. Grewgious, pondering.\r\n\r\n“Such a thing has been. I have read of cases in which people, rather\r\nthan face a seven days’ wonder, and have to account for themselves to\r\nthe idle and impertinent, have taken themselves away, and been long\r\nunheard of.”\r\n\r\n“I believe such things have happened,” said Mr. Grewgious, pondering\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n“When I had, and could have, no suspicion,” pursued Jasper, eagerly\r\nfollowing the new track, “that the dear lost boy had withheld anything\r\nfrom me—most of all, such a leading matter as this—what gleam of light\r\nwas there for me in the whole black sky? When I supposed that his\r\nintended wife was here, and his marriage close at hand, how could I\r\nentertain the possibility of his voluntarily leaving this place, in a\r\nmanner that would be so unaccountable, capricious, and cruel? But now\r\nthat I know what you have told me, is there no little chink through\r\nwhich day pierces? Supposing him to have disappeared of his own act, is\r\nnot his disappearance more accountable and less cruel? The fact of his\r\nhaving just parted from your ward, is in itself a sort of reason for\r\nhis going away. It does not make his mysterious departure the less\r\ncruel to me, it is true; but it relieves it of cruelty to her.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious could not but assent to this.\r\n\r\n“And even as to me,” continued Jasper, still pursuing the new track,\r\nwith ardour, and, as he did so, brightening with hope: “he knew that\r\nyou were coming to me; he knew that you were intrusted to tell me what\r\nyou have told me; if your doing so has awakened a new train of thought\r\nin my perplexed mind, it reasonably follows that, from the same\r\npremises, he might have foreseen the inferences that I should draw.\r\nGrant that he did foresee them; and even the cruelty to me—and who am\r\nI!—John Jasper, Music Master, vanishes!”—\r\n\r\nOnce more, Mr. Grewgious could not but assent to this.\r\n\r\n“I have had my distrusts, and terrible distrusts they have been,” said\r\nJasper; “but your disclosure, overpowering as it was at first—showing\r\nme that my own dear boy had had a great disappointing reservation from\r\nme, who so fondly loved him, kindles hope within me. You do not\r\nextinguish it when I state it, but admit it to be a reasonable hope. I\r\nbegin to believe it possible:” here he clasped his hands: “that he may\r\nhave disappeared from among us of his own accord, and that he may yet\r\nbe alive and well.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle came in at the moment. To whom Mr. Jasper repeated:\r\n\r\n“I begin to believe it possible that he may have disappeared of his own\r\naccord, and may yet be alive and well.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle taking a seat, and inquiring: “Why so?” Mr. Jasper\r\nrepeated the arguments he had just set forth. If they had been less\r\nplausible than they were, the good Minor Canon’s mind would have been\r\nin a state of preparation to receive them, as exculpatory of his\r\nunfortunate pupil. But he, too, did really attach great importance to\r\nthe lost young man’s having been, so immediately before his\r\ndisappearance, placed in a new and embarrassing relation towards every\r\none acquainted with his projects and affairs; and the fact seemed to\r\nhim to present the question in a new light.\r\n\r\n“I stated to Mr. Sapsea, when we waited on him,” said Jasper: as he\r\nreally had done: “that there was no quarrel or difference between the\r\ntwo young men at their last meeting. We all know that their first\r\nmeeting was unfortunately very far from amicable; but all went smoothly\r\nand quietly when they were last together at my house. My dear boy was\r\nnot in his usual spirits; he was depressed—I noticed that—and I am\r\nbound henceforth to dwell upon the circumstance the more, now that I\r\nknow there was a special reason for his being depressed: a reason,\r\nmoreover, which may possibly have induced him to absent himself.”\r\n\r\n“I pray to Heaven it may turn out so!” exclaimed Mr. Crisparkle.\r\n\r\n“_I_ pray to Heaven it may turn out so!” repeated Jasper. “You know—and\r\nMr. Grewgious should now know likewise—that I took a great\r\nprepossession against Mr. Neville Landless, arising out of his furious\r\nconduct on that first occasion. You know that I came to you, extremely\r\napprehensive, on my dear boy’s behalf, of his mad violence. You know\r\nthat I even entered in my Diary, and showed the entry to you, that I\r\nhad dark forebodings against him. Mr. Grewgious ought to be possessed\r\nof the whole case. He shall not, through any suppression of mine, be\r\ninformed of a part of it, and kept in ignorance of another part of it.\r\nI wish him to be good enough to understand that the communication he\r\nhas made to me has hopefully influenced my mind, in spite of its having\r\nbeen, before this mysterious occurrence took place, profoundly\r\nimpressed against young Landless.”\r\n\r\nThis fairness troubled the Minor Canon much. He felt that he was not as\r\nopen in his own dealing. He charged against himself reproachfully that\r\nhe had suppressed, so far, the two points of a second strong outbreak\r\nof temper against Edwin Drood on the part of Neville, and of the\r\npassion of jealousy having, to his own certain knowledge, flamed up in\r\nNeville’s breast against him. He was convinced of Neville’s innocence\r\nof any part in the ugly disappearance; and yet so many little\r\ncircumstances combined so wofully against him, that he dreaded to add\r\ntwo more to their cumulative weight. He was among the truest of men;\r\nbut he had been balancing in his mind, much to its distress, whether\r\nhis volunteering to tell these two fragments of truth, at this time,\r\nwould not be tantamount to a piecing together of falsehood in the place\r\nof truth.\r\n\r\nHowever, here was a model before him. He hesitated no longer.\r\nAddressing Mr. Grewgious, as one placed in authority by the revelation\r\nhe had brought to bear on the mystery (and surpassingly Angular Mr.\r\nGrewgious became when he found himself in that unexpected position),\r\nMr. Crisparkle bore his testimony to Mr. Jasper’s strict sense of\r\njustice, and, expressing his absolute confidence in the complete\r\nclearance of his pupil from the least taint of suspicion, sooner or\r\nlater, avowed that his confidence in that young gentleman had been\r\nformed, in spite of his confidential knowledge that his temper was of\r\nthe hottest and fiercest, and that it was directly incensed against Mr.\r\nJasper’s nephew, by the circumstance of his romantically supposing\r\nhimself to be enamoured of the same young lady. The sanguine reaction\r\nmanifest in Mr. Jasper was proof even against this unlooked-for\r\ndeclaration. It turned him paler; but he repeated that he would cling\r\nto the hope he had derived from Mr. Grewgious; and that if no trace of\r\nhis dear boy were found, leading to the dreadful inference that he had\r\nbeen made away with, he would cherish unto the last stretch of\r\npossibility the idea, that he might have absconded of his own wild\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nNow, it fell out that Mr. Crisparkle, going away from this conference\r\nstill very uneasy in his mind, and very much troubled on behalf of the\r\nyoung man whom he held as a kind of prisoner in his own house, took a\r\nmemorable night walk.\r\n\r\nHe walked to Cloisterham Weir.\r\n\r\nHe often did so, and consequently there was nothing remarkable in his\r\nfootsteps tending that way. But the preoccupation of his mind so\r\nhindered him from planning any walk, or taking heed of the objects he\r\npassed, that his first consciousness of being near the Weir, was\r\nderived from the sound of the falling water close at hand.\r\n\r\n“How did I come here!” was his first thought, as he stopped.\r\n\r\n“Why did I come here!” was his second.\r\n\r\nThen, he stood intently listening to the water. A familiar passage in\r\nhis reading, about airy tongues that syllable men’s names, rose so\r\nunbidden to his ear, that he put it from him with his hand, as if it\r\nwere tangible.\r\n\r\nIt was starlight. The Weir was full two miles above the spot to which\r\nthe young men had repaired to watch the storm. No search had been made\r\nup here, for the tide had been running strongly down, at that time of\r\nthe night of Christmas Eve, and the likeliest places for the discovery\r\nof a body, if a fatal accident had happened under such circumstances,\r\nall lay—both when the tide ebbed, and when it flowed again—between that\r\nspot and the sea. The water came over the Weir, with its usual sound on\r\na cold starlight night, and little could be seen of it; yet Mr.\r\nCrisparkle had a strange idea that something unusual hung about the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nHe reasoned with himself: What was it? Where was it? Put it to the\r\nproof. Which sense did it address?\r\n\r\nNo sense reported anything unusual there. He listened again, and his\r\nsense of hearing again checked the water coming over the Weir, with its\r\nusual sound on a cold starlight night.\r\n\r\nKnowing very well that the mystery with which his mind was occupied,\r\nmight of itself give the place this haunted air, he strained those\r\nhawk’s eyes of his for the correction of his sight. He got closer to\r\nthe Weir, and peered at its well-known posts and timbers. Nothing in\r\nthe least unusual was remotely shadowed forth. But he resolved that he\r\nwould come back early in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe Weir ran through his broken sleep, all night, and he was back again\r\nat sunrise. It was a bright frosty morning. The whole composition\r\nbefore him, when he stood where he had stood last night, was clearly\r\ndiscernible in its minutest details. He had surveyed it closely for\r\nsome minutes, and was about to withdraw his eyes, when they were\r\nattracted keenly to one spot.\r\n\r\nHe turned his back upon the Weir, and looked far away at the sky, and\r\nat the earth, and then looked again at that one spot. It caught his\r\nsight again immediately, and he concentrated his vision upon it. He\r\ncould not lose it now, though it was but such a speck in the landscape.\r\nIt fascinated his sight. His hands began plucking off his coat. For it\r\nstruck him that at that spot—a corner of the Weir—something glistened,\r\nwhich did not move and come over with the glistening water-drops, but\r\nremained stationary.\r\n\r\nHe assured himself of this, he threw off his clothes, he plunged into\r\nthe icy water, and swam for the spot. Climbing the timbers, he took\r\nfrom them, caught among their interstices by its chain, a gold watch,\r\nbearing engraved upon its back E. D.\r\n\r\nHe brought the watch to the bank, swam to the Weir again, climbed it,\r\nand dived off. He knew every hole and corner of all the depths, and\r\ndived and dived and dived, until he could bear the cold no more. His\r\nnotion was, that he would find the body; he only found a shirt-pin\r\nsticking in some mud and ooze.\r\n\r\nWith these discoveries he returned to Cloisterham, and, taking Neville\r\nLandless with him, went straight to the Mayor. Mr. Jasper was sent for,\r\nthe watch and shirt-pin were identified, Neville was detained, and the\r\nwildest frenzy and fatuity of evil report rose against him. He was of\r\nthat vindictive and violent nature, that but for his poor sister, who\r\nalone had influence over him, and out of whose sight he was never to be\r\ntrusted, he would be in the daily commission of murder. Before coming\r\nto England he had caused to be whipped to death sundry\r\n“Natives”—nomadic persons, encamping now in Asia, now in Africa, now in\r\nthe West Indies, and now at the North Pole—vaguely supposed in\r\nCloisterham to be always black, always of great virtue, always calling\r\nthemselves Me, and everybody else Massa or Missie (according to sex),\r\nand always reading tracts of the obscurest meaning, in broken English,\r\nbut always accurately understanding them in the purest mother tongue.\r\nHe had nearly brought Mrs. Crisparkle’s grey hairs with sorrow to the\r\ngrave. (Those original expressions were Mr. Sapsea’s.) He had\r\nrepeatedly said he would have Mr. Crisparkle’s life. He had repeatedly\r\nsaid he would have everybody’s life, and become in effect the last man.\r\nHe had been brought down to Cloisterham, from London, by an eminent\r\nPhilanthropist, and why? Because that Philanthropist had expressly\r\ndeclared: “I owe it to my fellow-creatures that he should be, in the\r\nwords of BENTHAM, where he is the cause of the greatest danger to the\r\nsmallest number.”\r\n\r\nThese dropping shots from the blunderbusses of blunderheadedness might\r\nnot have hit him in a vital place. But he had to stand against a\r\ntrained and well-directed fire of arms of precision too. He had\r\nnotoriously threatened the lost young man, and had, according to the\r\nshowing of his own faithful friend and tutor who strove so hard for\r\nhim, a cause of bitter animosity (created by himself, and stated by\r\nhimself), against that ill-starred fellow. He had armed himself with an\r\noffensive weapon for the fatal night, and he had gone off early in the\r\nmorning, after making preparations for departure. He had been found\r\nwith traces of blood on him; truly, they might have been wholly caused\r\nas he represented, but they might not, also. On a search-warrant being\r\nissued for the examination of his room, clothes, and so forth, it was\r\ndiscovered that he had destroyed all his papers, and rearranged all his\r\npossessions, on the very afternoon of the disappearance. The watch\r\nfound at the Weir was challenged by the jeweller as one he had wound\r\nand set for Edwin Drood, at twenty minutes past two on that same\r\nafternoon; and it had run down, before being cast into the water; and\r\nit was the jeweller’s positive opinion that it had never been re-wound.\r\nThis would justify the hypothesis that the watch was taken from him not\r\nlong after he left Mr. Jasper’s house at midnight, in company with the\r\nlast person seen with him, and that it had been thrown away after being\r\nretained some hours. Why thrown away? If he had been murdered, and so\r\nartfully disfigured, or concealed, or both, as that the murderer hoped\r\nidentification to be impossible, except from something that he wore,\r\nassuredly the murderer would seek to remove from the body the most\r\nlasting, the best known, and the most easily recognisable, things upon\r\nit. Those things would be the watch and shirt-pin. As to his\r\nopportunities of casting them into the river; if he were the object of\r\nthese suspicions, they were easy. For, he had been seen by many\r\npersons, wandering about on that side of the city—indeed on all sides\r\nof it—in a miserable and seemingly half-distracted manner. As to the\r\nchoice of the spot, obviously such criminating evidence had better take\r\nits chance of being found anywhere, rather than upon himself, or in his\r\npossession. Concerning the reconciliatory nature of the appointed\r\nmeeting between the two young men, very little could be made of that in\r\nyoung Landless’s favour; for it distinctly appeared that the meeting\r\noriginated, not with him, but with Mr. Crisparkle, and that it had been\r\nurged on by Mr. Crisparkle; and who could say how unwillingly, or in\r\nwhat ill-conditioned mood, his enforced pupil had gone to it? The more\r\nhis case was looked into, the weaker it became in every point. Even the\r\nbroad suggestion that the lost young man had absconded, was rendered\r\nadditionally improbable on the showing of the young lady from whom he\r\nhad so lately parted; for; what did she say, with great earnestness and\r\nsorrow, when interrogated? That he had, expressly and enthusiastically,\r\nplanned with her, that he would await the arrival of her guardian, Mr.\r\nGrewgious. And yet, be it observed, he disappeared before that\r\ngentleman appeared.\r\n\r\nOn the suspicions thus urged and supported, Neville was detained, and\r\nre-detained, and the search was pressed on every hand, and Jasper\r\nlaboured night and day. But nothing more was found. No discovery being\r\nmade, which proved the lost man to be dead, it at length became\r\nnecessary to release the person suspected of having made away with him.\r\nNeville was set at large. Then, a consequence ensued which Mr.\r\nCrisparkle had too well foreseen. Neville must leave the place, for the\r\nplace shunned him and cast him out. Even had it not been so, the dear\r\nold china shepherdess would have worried herself to death with fears\r\nfor her son, and with general trepidation occasioned by their having\r\nsuch an inmate. Even had that not been so, the authority to which the\r\nMinor Canon deferred officially, would have settled the point.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Crisparkle,” quoth the Dean, “human justice may err, but it must\r\nact according to its lights. The days of taking sanctuary are past.\r\nThis young man must not take sanctuary with us.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that he must leave my house, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Crisparkle,” returned the prudent Dean, “I claim no authority in\r\nyour house. I merely confer with you, on the painful necessity you find\r\nyourself under, of depriving this young man of the great advantages of\r\nyour counsel and instruction.”\r\n\r\n“It is very lamentable, sir,” Mr. Crisparkle represented.\r\n\r\n“Very much so,” the Dean assented.\r\n\r\n“And if it be a necessity—” Mr. Crisparkle faltered.\r\n\r\n“As you unfortunately find it to be,” returned the Dean.\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle bowed submissively: “It is hard to prejudge his case,\r\nsir, but I am sensible that—”\r\n\r\n“Just so. Perfectly. As you say, Mr. Crisparkle,” interposed the Dean,\r\nnodding his head smoothly, “there is nothing else to be done. No doubt,\r\nno doubt. There is no alternative, as your good sense has discovered.”\r\n\r\n“I am entirely satisfied of his perfect innocence, sir, nevertheless.”\r\n\r\n“We-e-ell!” said the Dean, in a more confidential tone, and slightly\r\nglancing around him, “I would not say so, generally. Not generally.\r\nEnough of suspicion attaches to him to—no, I think I would not say so,\r\ngenerally.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle bowed again.\r\n\r\n“It does not become us, perhaps,” pursued the Dean, “to be partisans.\r\nNot partisans. We clergy keep our hearts warm and our heads cool, and\r\nwe hold a judicious middle course.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you do not object, sir, to my having stated in public,\r\nemphatically, that he will reappear here, whenever any new suspicion\r\nmay be awakened, or any new circumstance may come to light in this\r\nextraordinary matter?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” returned the Dean. “And yet, do you know, I don’t think,”\r\nwith a very nice and neat emphasis on those two words: “I _don’t think_\r\nI would state it emphatically. State it? Ye-e-es! But emphatically?\r\nNo-o-o. I _think_ not. In point of fact, Mr. Crisparkle, keeping our\r\nhearts warm and our heads cool, we clergy need do nothing\r\nemphatically.”\r\n\r\nSo Minor Canon Row knew Neville Landless no more; and he went\r\nwhithersoever he would, or could, with a blight upon his name and fame.\r\n\r\nIt was not until then that John Jasper silently resumed his place in\r\nthe choir. Haggard and red-eyed, his hopes plainly had deserted him,\r\nhis sanguine mood was gone, and all his worst misgivings had come back.\r\nA day or two afterwards, while unrobing, he took his Diary from a\r\npocket of his coat, turned the leaves, and with an impressive look, and\r\nwithout one spoken word, handed this entry to Mr. Crisparkle to read:\r\n\r\n“My dear boy is murdered. The discovery of the watch and shirt-pin\r\nconvinces me that he was murdered that night, and that his jewellery\r\nwas taken from him to prevent identification by its means. All the\r\ndelusive hopes I had founded on his separation from his betrothed wife,\r\nI give to the winds. They perish before this fatal discovery. I now\r\nswear, and record the oath on this page, That I nevermore will discuss\r\nthis mystery with any human creature until I hold the clue to it in my\r\nhand. That I never will relax in my secrecy or in my search. That I\r\nwill fasten the crime of the murder of my dear dead boy upon the\r\nmurderer. And, That I devote myself to his destruction.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nPHILANTHROPY, PROFESSIONAL AND UNPROFESSIONAL\r\n\r\n\r\nFull half a year had come and gone, and Mr. Crisparkle sat in a\r\nwaiting-room in the London chief offices of the Haven of Philanthropy,\r\nuntil he could have audience of Mr. Honeythunder.\r\n\r\nIn his college days of athletic exercises, Mr. Crisparkle had known\r\nprofessors of the Noble Art of fisticuffs, and had attended two or\r\nthree of their gloved gatherings. He had now an opportunity of\r\nobserving that as to the phrenological formation of the backs of their\r\nheads, the Professing Philanthropists were uncommonly like the\r\nPugilists. In the development of all those organs which constitute, or\r\nattend, a propensity to “pitch into” your fellow-creatures, the\r\nPhilanthropists were remarkably favoured. There were several Professors\r\npassing in and out, with exactly the aggressive air upon them of being\r\nready for a turn-up with any Novice who might happen to be on hand,\r\nthat Mr. Crisparkle well remembered in the circles of the Fancy.\r\nPreparations were in progress for a moral little Mill somewhere on the\r\nrural circuit, and other Professors were backing this or that\r\nHeavy-Weight as good for such or such speech-making hits, so very much\r\nafter the manner of the sporting publicans, that the intended\r\nResolutions might have been Rounds. In an official manager of these\r\ndisplays much celebrated for his platform tactics, Mr. Crisparkle\r\nrecognised (in a suit of black) the counterpart of a deceased\r\nbenefactor of his species, an eminent public character, once known to\r\nfame as Frosty-faced Fogo, who in days of yore superintended the\r\nformation of the magic circle with the ropes and stakes. There were\r\nonly three conditions of resemblance wanting between these Professors\r\nand those. Firstly, the Philanthropists were in very bad training: much\r\ntoo fleshy, and presenting, both in face and figure, a superabundance\r\nof what is known to Pugilistic Experts as Suet Pudding. Secondly, the\r\nPhilanthropists had not the good temper of the Pugilists, and used\r\nworse language. Thirdly, their fighting code stood in great need of\r\nrevision, as empowering them not only to bore their man to the ropes,\r\nbut to bore him to the confines of distraction; also to hit him when he\r\nwas down, hit him anywhere and anyhow, kick him, stamp upon him, gouge\r\nhim, and maul him behind his back without mercy. In these last\r\nparticulars the Professors of the Noble Art were much nobler than the\r\nProfessors of Philanthropy.\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle was so completely lost in musing on these similarities\r\nand dissimilarities, at the same time watching the crowd which came and\r\nwent by, always, as it seemed, on errands of antagonistically snatching\r\nsomething from somebody, and never giving anything to anybody, that his\r\nname was called before he heard it. On his at length responding, he was\r\nshown by a miserably shabby and underpaid stipendiary Philanthropist\r\n(who could hardly have done worse if he had taken service with a\r\ndeclared enemy of the human race) to Mr. Honeythunder’s room.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Mr. Honeythunder, in his tremendous voice, like a\r\nschoolmaster issuing orders to a boy of whom he had a bad opinion, “sit\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle seated himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Honeythunder having signed the remaining few score of a few\r\nthousand circulars, calling upon a corresponding number of families\r\nwithout means to come forward, stump up instantly, and be\r\nPhilanthropists, or go to the Devil, another shabby stipendiary\r\nPhilanthropist (highly disinterested, if in earnest) gathered these\r\ninto a basket and walked off with them.\r\n\r\n“Now, Mr. Crisparkle,” said Mr. Honeythunder, turning his chair half\r\nround towards him when they were alone, and squaring his arms with his\r\nhands on his knees, and his brows knitted, as if he added, I am going\r\nto make short work of _you_: “Now, Mr. Crisparkle, we entertain\r\ndifferent views, you and I, sir, of the sanctity of human life.”\r\n\r\n“Do we?” returned the Minor Canon.\r\n\r\n“We do, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Might I ask you,” said the Minor Canon: “what are your views on that\r\nsubject?”\r\n\r\n“That human life is a thing to be held sacred, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Might I ask you,” pursued the Minor Canon as before: “what you suppose\r\nto be my views on that subject?”\r\n\r\n“By George, sir!” returned the Philanthropist, squaring his arms still\r\nmore, as he frowned on Mr. Crisparkle: “they are best known to\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“Readily admitted. But you began by saying that we took different\r\nviews, you know. Therefore (or you could not say so) you must have set\r\nup some views as mine. Pray, what views _have_ you set up as mine?”\r\n\r\n“Here is a man—and a young man,” said Mr. Honeythunder, as if that made\r\nthe matter infinitely worse, and he could have easily borne the loss of\r\nan old one, “swept off the face of the earth by a deed of violence.\r\nWhat do you call that?”\r\n\r\n“Murder,” said the Minor Canon.\r\n\r\n“What do you call the doer of that deed, sir?\r\n\r\n“A murderer,” said the Minor Canon.\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear you admit so much, sir,” retorted Mr. Honeythunder,\r\nin his most offensive manner; “and I candidly tell you that I didn’t\r\nexpect it.” Here he lowered heavily at Mr. Crisparkle again.\r\n\r\n“Be so good as to explain what you mean by those very unjustifiable\r\nexpressions.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t sit here, sir,” returned the Philanthropist, raising his voice\r\nto a roar, “to be browbeaten.”\r\n\r\n“As the only other person present, no one can possibly know that better\r\nthan I do,” returned the Minor Canon very quietly. “But I interrupt\r\nyour explanation.”\r\n\r\n“Murder!” proceeded Mr. Honeythunder, in a kind of boisterous reverie,\r\nwith his platform folding of his arms, and his platform nod of\r\nabhorrent reflection after each short sentiment of a word. “Bloodshed!\r\nAbel! Cain! I hold no terms with Cain. I repudiate with a shudder the\r\nred hand when it is offered me.”\r\n\r\nInstead of instantly leaping into his chair and cheering himself\r\nhoarse, as the Brotherhood in public meeting assembled would infallibly\r\nhave done on this cue, Mr. Crisparkle merely reversed the quiet\r\ncrossing of his legs, and said mildly: “Don’t let me interrupt your\r\nexplanation—when you begin it.”\r\n\r\n“The Commandments say, no murder. NO murder, sir!” proceeded Mr.\r\nHoneythunder, platformally pausing as if he took Mr. Crisparkle to task\r\nfor having distinctly asserted that they said: You may do a little\r\nmurder, and then leave off.\r\n\r\n“And they also say, you shall bear no false witness,” observed Mr.\r\nCrisparkle.\r\n\r\n“Enough!” bellowed Mr. Honeythunder, with a solemnity and severity that\r\nwould have brought the house down at a meeting, “E—e—nough! My late\r\nwards being now of age, and I being released from a trust which I\r\ncannot contemplate without a thrill of horror, there are the accounts\r\nwhich you have undertaken to accept on their behalf, and there is a\r\nstatement of the balance which you have undertaken to receive, and\r\nwhich you cannot receive too soon. And let me tell you, sir, I wish\r\nthat, as a man and a Minor Canon, you were better employed,” with a\r\nnod. “Better employed,” with another nod. “Bet—ter em—ployed!” with\r\nanother and the three nods added up.\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle rose; a little heated in the face, but with perfect\r\ncommand of himself.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Honeythunder,” he said, taking up the papers referred to: “my\r\nbeing better or worse employed than I am at present is a matter of\r\ntaste and opinion. You might think me better employed in enrolling\r\nmyself a member of your Society.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, indeed, sir!” retorted Mr. Honeythunder, shaking his head in a\r\nthreatening manner. “It would have been better for you if you had done\r\nthat long ago!”\r\n\r\n“I think otherwise.”\r\n\r\n“Or,” said Mr. Honeythunder, shaking his head again, “I might think one\r\nof your profession better employed in devoting himself to the discovery\r\nand punishment of guilt than in leaving that duty to be undertaken by a\r\nlayman.”\r\n\r\n“I may regard my profession from a point of view which teaches me that\r\nits first duty is towards those who are in necessity and tribulation,\r\nwho are desolate and oppressed,” said Mr. Crisparkle. “However, as I\r\nhave quite clearly satisfied myself that it is no part of my profession\r\nto make professions, I say no more of that. But I owe it to Mr.\r\nNeville, and to Mr. Neville’s sister (and in a much lower degree to\r\nmyself), to say to you that I _know_ I was in the full possession and\r\nunderstanding of Mr. Neville’s mind and heart at the time of this\r\noccurrence; and that, without in the least colouring or concealing what\r\nwas to be deplored in him and required to be corrected, I feel certain\r\nthat his tale is true. Feeling that certainty, I befriend him. As long\r\nas that certainty shall last, I will befriend him. And if any\r\nconsideration could shake me in this resolve, I should be so ashamed of\r\nmyself for my meanness, that no man’s good opinion—no, nor no\r\nwoman’s—so gained, could compensate me for the loss of my own.”\r\n\r\nGood fellow! manly fellow! And he was so modest, too. There was no more\r\nself-assertion in the Minor Canon than in the schoolboy who had stood\r\nin the breezy playing-fields keeping a wicket. He was simply and\r\nstaunchly true to his duty alike in the large case and in the small. So\r\nall true souls ever are. So every true soul ever was, ever is, and ever\r\nwill be. There is nothing little to the really great in spirit.\r\n\r\n“Then who do you make out did the deed?” asked Mr. Honeythunder,\r\nturning on him abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Heaven forbid,” said Mr. Crisparkle, “that in my desire to clear one\r\nman I should lightly criminate another! I accuse no one.”\r\n\r\n“Tcha!” ejaculated Mr. Honeythunder with great disgust; for this was by\r\nno means the principle on which the Philanthropic Brotherhood usually\r\nproceeded. “And, sir, you are not a disinterested witness, we must bear\r\nin mind.”\r\n\r\n“How am I an interested one?” inquired Mr. Crisparkle, smiling\r\ninnocently, at a loss to imagine.\r\n\r\n“There was a certain stipend, sir, paid to you for your pupil, which\r\nmay have warped your judgment a bit,” said Mr. Honeythunder, coarsely.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I expect to retain it still?” Mr. Crisparkle returned,\r\nenlightened; “do you mean that too?”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” returned the professional Philanthropist, getting up and\r\nthrusting his hands down into his trousers-pockets, “I don’t go about\r\nmeasuring people for caps. If people find I have any about me that fit\r\n’em, they can put ’em on and wear ’em, if they like. That’s their look\r\nout: not mine.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle eyed him with a just indignation, and took him to task\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Honeythunder, I hoped when I came in here that I might be under no\r\nnecessity of commenting on the introduction of platform manners or\r\nplatform manœuvres among the decent forbearances of private life. But\r\nyou have given me such a specimen of both, that I should be a fit\r\nsubject for both if I remained silent respecting them. They are\r\ndetestable.”\r\n\r\n“They don’t suit _you_, I dare say, sir.”\r\n\r\n“They are,” repeated Mr. Crisparkle, without noticing the interruption,\r\n“detestable. They violate equally the justice that should belong to\r\nChristians, and the restraints that should belong to gentlemen. You\r\nassume a great crime to have been committed by one whom I, acquainted\r\nwith the attendant circumstances, and having numerous reasons on my\r\nside, devoutly believe to be innocent of it. Because I differ from you\r\non that vital point, what is your platform resource? Instantly to turn\r\nupon me, charging that I have no sense of the enormity of the crime\r\nitself, but am its aider and abettor! So, another time—taking me as\r\nrepresenting your opponent in other cases—you set up a platform\r\ncredulity; a moved and seconded and carried-unanimously profession of\r\nfaith in some ridiculous delusion or mischievous imposition. I decline\r\nto believe it, and you fall back upon your platform resource of\r\nproclaiming that I believe nothing; that because I will not bow down to\r\na false God of your making, I deny the true God! Another time you make\r\nthe platform discovery that War is a calamity, and you propose to\r\nabolish it by a string of twisted resolutions tossed into the air like\r\nthe tail of a kite. I do not admit the discovery to be yours in the\r\nleast, and I have not a grain of faith in your remedy. Again, your\r\nplatform resource of representing me as revelling in the horrors of a\r\nbattle-field like a fiend incarnate! Another time, in another of your\r\nundiscriminating platform rushes, you would punish the sober for the\r\ndrunken. I claim consideration for the comfort, convenience, and\r\nrefreshment of the sober; and you presently make platform proclamation\r\nthat I have a depraved desire to turn Heaven’s creatures into swine and\r\nwild beasts! In all such cases your movers, and your seconders, and\r\nyour supporters—your regular Professors of all degrees, run amuck like\r\nso many mad Malays; habitually attributing the lowest and basest\r\nmotives with the utmost recklessness (let me call your attention to a\r\nrecent instance in yourself for which you should blush), and quoting\r\nfigures which you know to be as wilfully onesided as a statement of any\r\ncomplicated account that should be all Creditor side and no Debtor, or\r\nall Debtor side and no Creditor. Therefore it is, Mr. Honeythunder,\r\nthat I consider the platform a sufficiently bad example and a\r\nsufficiently bad school, even in public life; but hold that, carried\r\ninto private life, it becomes an unendurable nuisance.”\r\n\r\n“These are strong words, sir!” exclaimed the Philanthropist.\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” said Mr. Crisparkle. “Good morning.”\r\n\r\nHe walked out of the Haven at a great rate, but soon fell into his\r\nregular brisk pace, and soon had a smile upon his face as he went\r\nalong, wondering what the china shepherdess would have said if she had\r\nseen him pounding Mr. Honeythunder in the late little lively affair.\r\nFor Mr. Crisparkle had just enough of harmless vanity to hope that he\r\nhad hit hard, and to glow with the belief that he had trimmed the\r\nPhilanthropic Jacket pretty handsomely.\r\n\r\nHe took himself to Staple Inn, but not to P. J. T. and Mr. Grewgious.\r\nFull many a creaking stair he climbed before he reached some attic\r\nrooms in a corner, turned the latch of their unbolted door, and stood\r\nbeside the table of Neville Landless.\r\n\r\nAn air of retreat and solitude hung about the rooms and about their\r\ninhabitant. He was much worn, and so were they. Their sloping ceilings,\r\ncumbrous rusty locks and grates, and heavy wooden bins and beams,\r\nslowly mouldering withal, had a prisonous look, and he had the haggard\r\nface of a prisoner. Yet the sunlight shone in at the ugly\r\ngarret-window, which had a penthouse to itself thrust out among the\r\ntiles; and on the cracked and smoke-blackened parapet beyond, some of\r\nthe deluded sparrows of the place rheumatically hopped, like little\r\nfeathered cripples who had left their crutches in their nests; and\r\nthere was a play of living leaves at hand that changed the air, and\r\nmade an imperfect sort of music in it that would have been melody in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe rooms were sparely furnished, but with good store of books.\r\nEverything expressed the abode of a poor student. That Mr. Crisparkle\r\nhad been either chooser, lender, or donor of the books, or that he\r\ncombined the three characters, might have been easily seen in the\r\nfriendly beam of his eyes upon them as he entered.\r\n\r\n“How goes it, Neville?”\r\n\r\n“I am in good heart, Mr. Crisparkle, and working away.”\r\n\r\n“I wish your eyes were not quite so large and not quite so bright,”\r\nsaid the Minor Canon, slowly releasing the hand he had taken in his.\r\n\r\n“They brighten at the sight of you,” returned Neville. “If you were to\r\nfall away from me, they would soon be dull enough.”\r\n\r\n“Rally, rally!” urged the other, in a stimulating tone. “Fight for it,\r\nNeville!”\r\n\r\n“If I were dying, I feel as if a word from you would rally me; if my\r\npulse had stopped, I feel as if your touch would make it beat again,”\r\nsaid Neville. “But I _have_ rallied, and am doing famously.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle turned him with his face a little more towards the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n“I want to see a ruddier touch here, Neville,” he said, indicating his\r\nown healthy cheek by way of pattern. “I want more sun to shine upon\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nNeville drooped suddenly, as he replied in a lowered voice: “I am not\r\nhardy enough for that, yet. I may become so, but I cannot bear it yet.\r\nIf you had gone through those Cloisterham streets as I did; if you had\r\nseen, as I did, those averted eyes, and the better sort of people\r\nsilently giving me too much room to pass, that I might not touch them\r\nor come near them, you wouldn’t think it quite unreasonable that I\r\ncannot go about in the daylight.”\r\n\r\n“My poor fellow!” said the Minor Canon, in a tone so purely sympathetic\r\nthat the young man caught his hand, “I never said it was unreasonable;\r\nnever thought so. But I should like you to do it.”\r\n\r\n“And that would give me the strongest motive to do it. But I cannot\r\nyet. I cannot persuade myself that the eyes of even the stream of\r\nstrangers I pass in this vast city look at me without suspicion. I feel\r\nmarked and tainted, even when I go out—as I do only—at night. But the\r\ndarkness covers me then, and I take courage from it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle laid a hand upon his shoulder, and stood looking down at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“If I could have changed my name,” said Neville, “I would have done so.\r\nBut as you wisely pointed out to me, I can’t do that, for it would look\r\nlike guilt. If I could have gone to some distant place, I might have\r\nfound relief in that, but the thing is not to be thought of, for the\r\nsame reason. Hiding and escaping would be the construction in either\r\ncase. It seems a little hard to be so tied to a stake, and innocent;\r\nbut I don’t complain.”\r\n\r\n“And you must expect no miracle to help you, Neville,” said Mr.\r\nCrisparkle, compassionately.\r\n\r\n“No, sir, I know that. The ordinary fulness of time and circumstances\r\nis all I have to trust to.”\r\n\r\n“It will right you at last, Neville.”\r\n\r\n“So I believe, and I hope I may live to know it.”\r\n\r\nBut perceiving that the despondent mood into which he was falling cast\r\na shadow on the Minor Canon, and (it may be) feeling that the broad\r\nhand upon his shoulder was not then quite as steady as its own natural\r\nstrength had rendered it when it first touched him just now, he\r\nbrightened and said:\r\n\r\n“Excellent circumstances for study, anyhow! and you know, Mr.\r\nCrisparkle, what need I have of study in all ways. Not to mention that\r\nyou have advised me to study for the difficult profession of the law,\r\nspecially, and that of course I am guiding myself by the advice of such\r\na friend and helper. Such a good friend and helper!”\r\n\r\nHe took the fortifying hand from his shoulder, and kissed it. Mr.\r\nCrisparkle beamed at the books, but not so brightly as when he had\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n“I gather from your silence on the subject that my late guardian is\r\nadverse, Mr. Crisparkle?”\r\n\r\nThe Minor Canon answered: “Your late guardian is a—a most unreasonable\r\nperson, and it signifies nothing to any reasonable person whether he is\r\n_ad_verse, _per_verse, or the _re_verse.”\r\n\r\n“Well for me that I have enough with economy to live upon,” sighed\r\nNeville, half wearily and half cheerily, “while I wait to be learned,\r\nand wait to be righted! Else I might have proved the proverb, that\r\nwhile the grass grows, the steed starves!”\r\n\r\nHe opened some books as he said it, and was soon immersed in their\r\ninterleaved and annotated passages; while Mr. Crisparkle sat beside\r\nhim, expounding, correcting, and advising. The Minor Canon’s Cathedral\r\nduties made these visits of his difficult to accomplish, and only to be\r\ncompassed at intervals of many weeks. But they were as serviceable as\r\nthey were precious to Neville Landless.\r\n\r\nWhen they had got through such studies as they had in hand, they stood\r\nleaning on the window-sill, and looking down upon the patch of garden.\r\n“Next week,” said Mr. Crisparkle, “you will cease to be alone, and will\r\nhave a devoted companion.”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” returned Neville, “this seems an uncongenial place to bring\r\nmy sister to.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so,” said the Minor Canon. “There is duty to be done\r\nhere; and there are womanly feeling, sense, and courage wanted here.”\r\n\r\n“I meant,” explained Neville, “that the surroundings are so dull and\r\nunwomanly, and that Helena can have no suitable friend or society\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“You have only to remember,” said Mr. Crisparkle, “that you are here\r\nyourself, and that she has to draw you into the sunlight.”\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a little while, and then Mr. Crisparkle began\r\nanew.\r\n\r\n“When we first spoke together, Neville, you told me that your sister\r\nhad risen out of the disadvantages of your past lives as superior to\r\nyou as the tower of Cloisterham Cathedral is higher than the chimneys\r\nof Minor Canon Corner. Do you remember that?”\r\n\r\n“Right well!”\r\n\r\n“I was inclined to think it at the time an enthusiastic flight. No\r\nmatter what I think it now. What I would emphasise is, that under the\r\nhead of Pride your sister is a great and opportune example to you.”\r\n\r\n“Under _all_ heads that are included in the composition of a fine\r\ncharacter, she is.”\r\n\r\n“Say so; but take this one. Your sister has learnt how to govern what\r\nis proud in her nature. She can dominate it even when it is wounded\r\nthrough her sympathy with you. No doubt she has suffered deeply in\r\nthose same streets where you suffered deeply. No doubt her life is\r\ndarkened by the cloud that darkens yours. But bending her pride into a\r\ngrand composure that is not haughty or aggressive, but is a sustained\r\nconfidence in you and in the truth, she has won her way through those\r\nstreets until she passes along them as high in the general respect as\r\nany one who treads them. Every day and hour of her life since Edwin\r\nDrood’s disappearance, she has faced malignity and folly—for you—as\r\nonly a brave nature well directed can. So it will be with her to the\r\nend. Another and weaker kind of pride might sink broken-hearted, but\r\nnever such a pride as hers: which knows no shrinking, and can get no\r\nmastery over her.”\r\n\r\nThe pale cheek beside him flushed under the comparison, and the hint\r\nimplied in it.\r\n\r\n“I will do all I can to imitate her,” said Neville.\r\n\r\n“Do so, and be a truly brave man, as she is a truly brave woman,”\r\nanswered Mr. Crisparkle stoutly. “It is growing dark. Will you go my\r\nway with me, when it is quite dark? Mind! it is not I who wait for\r\ndarkness.”\r\n\r\nNeville replied, that he would accompany him directly. But Mr.\r\nCrisparkle said he had a moment’s call to make on Mr. Grewgious as an\r\nact of courtesy, and would run across to that gentleman’s chambers, and\r\nrejoin Neville on his own doorstep, if he would come down there to meet\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious, bolt upright as usual, sat taking his wine in the dusk\r\nat his open window; his wineglass and decanter on the round table at\r\nhis elbow; himself and his legs on the window-seat; only one hinge in\r\nhis whole body, like a bootjack.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, reverend sir?” said Mr. Grewgious, with abundant offers\r\nof hospitality, which were as cordially declined as made. “And how is\r\nyour charge getting on over the way in the set that I had the pleasure\r\nof recommending to you as vacant and eligible?”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle replied suitably.\r\n\r\n“I am glad you approve of them,” said Mr. Grewgious, “because I\r\nentertain a sort of fancy for having him under my eye.”\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Grewgious had to turn his eye up considerably before he could\r\nsee the chambers, the phrase was to be taken figuratively and not\r\nliterally.\r\n\r\n“And how did you leave Mr. Jasper, reverend sir?” said Mr. Grewgious.\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle had left him pretty well.\r\n\r\n“And where did you leave Mr. Jasper, reverend sir?” Mr. Crisparkle had\r\nleft him at Cloisterham.\r\n\r\n“And when did you leave Mr. Jasper, reverend sir?” That morning.\r\n\r\n“Umps!” said Mr. Grewgious. “He didn’t say he was coming, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“Coming where?”\r\n\r\n“Anywhere, for instance?” said Mr. Grewgious.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Because here he is,” said Mr. Grewgious, who had asked all these\r\nquestions, with his preoccupied glance directed out at window. “And he\r\ndon’t look agreeable, does he?”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle was craning towards the window, when Mr. Grewgious\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n“If you will kindly step round here behind me, in the gloom of the\r\nroom, and will cast your eye at the second-floor landing window in\r\nyonder house, I think you will hardly fail to see a slinking individual\r\nin whom I recognise our local friend.”\r\n\r\n“You are right!” cried Mr. Crisparkle.\r\n\r\n“Umps!” said Mr. Grewgious. Then he added, turning his face so abruptly\r\nthat his head nearly came into collision with Mr. Crisparkle’s: “what\r\nshould you say that our local friend was up to?”\r\n\r\nThe last passage he had been shown in the Diary returned on Mr.\r\nCrisparkle’s mind with the force of a strong recoil, and he asked Mr.\r\nGrewgious if he thought it possible that Neville was to be harassed by\r\nthe keeping of a watch upon him?\r\n\r\n“A watch?” repeated Mr. Grewgious musingly. “Ay!”\r\n\r\n“Which would not only of itself haunt and torture his life,” said Mr.\r\nCrisparkle warmly, “but would expose him to the torment of a\r\nperpetually reviving suspicion, whatever he might do, or wherever he\r\nmight go.”\r\n\r\n“Ay!” said Mr. Grewgious musingly still. “Do I see him waiting for\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt you do.”\r\n\r\n“Then _would_ you have the goodness to excuse my getting up to see you\r\nout, and to go out to join him, and to go the way that you were going,\r\nand to take no notice of our local friend?” said Mr. Grewgious. “I\r\nentertain a sort of fancy for having _him_ under my eye to-night, do\r\nyou know?”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle, with a significant nod complied; and rejoining Neville,\r\nwent away with him. They dined together, and parted at the yet\r\nunfinished and undeveloped railway station: Mr. Crisparkle to get home;\r\nNeville to walk the streets, cross the bridges, make a wide round of\r\nthe city in the friendly darkness, and tire himself out.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight when he returned from his solitary expedition and\r\nclimbed his staircase. The night was hot, and the windows of the\r\nstaircase were all wide open. Coming to the top, it gave him a passing\r\nchill of surprise (there being no rooms but his up there) to find a\r\nstranger sitting on the window-sill, more after the manner of a\r\nventuresome glazier than an amateur ordinarily careful of his neck; in\r\nfact, so much more outside the window than inside, as to suggest the\r\nthought that he must have come up by the water-spout instead of the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nThe stranger said nothing until Neville put his key in his door; then,\r\nseeming to make sure of his identity from the action, he spoke:\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” he said, coming from the window with a frank and\r\nsmiling air, and a prepossessing address; “the beans.”\r\n\r\nNeville was quite at a loss.\r\n\r\n“Runners,” said the visitor. “Scarlet. Next door at the back.”\r\n\r\n“O,” returned Neville. “And the mignonette and wall-flower?”\r\n\r\n“The same,” said the visitor.\r\n\r\n“Pray walk in.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.”\r\n\r\nNeville lighted his candles, and the visitor sat down. A handsome\r\ngentleman, with a young face, but with an older figure in its\r\nrobustness and its breadth of shoulder; say a man of eight-and-twenty,\r\nor at the utmost thirty; so extremely sunburnt that the contrast\r\nbetween his brown visage and the white forehead shaded out of doors by\r\nhis hat, and the glimpses of white throat below the neckerchief, would\r\nhave been almost ludicrous but for his broad temples, bright blue eyes,\r\nclustering brown hair, and laughing teeth.\r\n\r\n“I have noticed,” said he; “—my name is Tartar.”\r\n\r\nNeville inclined his head.\r\n\r\n“I have noticed (excuse me) that you shut yourself up a good deal, and\r\nthat you seem to like my garden aloft here. If you would like a little\r\nmore of it, I could throw out a few lines and stays between my windows\r\nand yours, which the runners would take to directly. And I have some\r\nboxes, both of mignonette and wall-flower, that I could shove on along\r\nthe gutter (with a boathook I have by me) to your windows, and draw\r\nback again when they wanted watering or gardening, and shove on again\r\nwhen they were ship-shape; so that they would cause you no trouble. I\r\ncouldn’t take this liberty without asking your permission, so I venture\r\nto ask it. Tartar, corresponding set, next door.”\r\n\r\n“You are very kind.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. I ought to apologise for looking in so late. But having\r\nnoticed (excuse me) that you generally walk out at night, I thought I\r\nshould inconvenience you least by awaiting your return. I am always\r\nafraid of inconveniencing busy men, being an idle man.”\r\n\r\n“I should not have thought so, from your appearance.”\r\n\r\n“No? I take it as a compliment. In fact, I was bred in the Royal Navy,\r\nand was First Lieutenant when I quitted it. But, an uncle disappointed\r\nin the service leaving me his property on condition that I left the\r\nNavy, I accepted the fortune, and resigned my commission.”\r\n\r\n“Lately, I presume?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I had had twelve or fifteen years of knocking about first. I\r\ncame here some nine months before you; I had had one crop before you\r\ncame. I chose this place, because, having served last in a little\r\ncorvette, I knew I should feel more at home where I had a constant\r\nopportunity of knocking my head against the ceiling. Besides, it would\r\nnever do for a man who had been aboard ship from his boyhood to turn\r\nluxurious all at once. Besides, again; having been accustomed to a very\r\nshort allowance of land all my life, I thought I’d feel my way to the\r\ncommand of a landed estate, by beginning in boxes.”\r\n\r\nWhimsically as this was said, there was a touch of merry earnestness in\r\nit that made it doubly whimsical.\r\n\r\n“However,” said the Lieutenant, “I have talked quite enough about\r\nmyself. It is not my way, I hope; it has merely been to present myself\r\nto you naturally. If you will allow me to take the liberty I have\r\ndescribed, it will be a charity, for it will give me something more to\r\ndo. And you are not to suppose that it will entail any interruption or\r\nintrusion on you, for that is far from my intention.”\r\n\r\nNeville replied that he was greatly obliged, and that he thankfully\r\naccepted the kind proposal.\r\n\r\n“I am very glad to take your windows in tow,” said the Lieutenant.\r\n“From what I have seen of you when I have been gardening at mine, and\r\nyou have been looking on, I have thought you (excuse me) rather too\r\nstudious and delicate. May I ask, is your health at all affected?”\r\n\r\n“I have undergone some mental distress,” said Neville, confused, “which\r\nhas stood me in the stead of illness.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” said Mr. Tartar.\r\n\r\nWith the greatest delicacy he shifted his ground to the windows again,\r\nand asked if he could look at one of them. On Neville’s opening it, he\r\nimmediately sprang out, as if he were going aloft with a whole watch in\r\nan emergency, and were setting a bright example.\r\n\r\n“For Heaven’s sake,” cried Neville, “don’t do that! Where are you going\r\nMr. Tartar? You’ll be dashed to pieces!”\r\n\r\n“All well!” said the Lieutenant, coolly looking about him on the\r\nhousetop. “All taut and trim here. Those lines and stays shall be\r\nrigged before you turn out in the morning. May I take this short cut\r\nhome, and say good-night?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Tartar!” urged Neville. “Pray! It makes me giddy to see you!”\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Tartar, with a wave of his hand and the deftness of a cat, had\r\nalready dipped through his scuttle of scarlet runners without breaking\r\na leaf, and “gone below.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious, his bedroom window-blind held aside with his hand,\r\nhappened at the moment to have Neville’s chambers under his eye for the\r\nlast time that night. Fortunately his eye was on the front of the house\r\nand not the back, or this remarkable appearance and disappearance might\r\nhave broken his rest as a phenomenon. But Mr. Grewgious seeing nothing\r\nthere, not even a light in the windows, his gaze wandered from the\r\nwindows to the stars, as if he would have read in them something that\r\nwas hidden from him. Many of us would, if we could; but none of us so\r\nmuch as know our letters in the stars yet—or seem likely to do it, in\r\nthis state of existence—and few languages can be read until their\r\nalphabets are mastered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nA SETTLER IN CLOISTERHAM\r\n\r\n\r\nAt about this time a stranger appeared in Cloisterham; a white-haired\r\npersonage, with black eyebrows. Being buttoned up in a tightish blue\r\nsurtout, with a buff waistcoat and gray trousers, he had something of a\r\nmilitary air, but he announced himself at the Crozier (the orthodox\r\nhotel, where he put up with a portmanteau) as an idle dog who lived\r\nupon his means; and he farther announced that he had a mind to take a\r\nlodging in the picturesque old city for a month or two, with a view of\r\nsettling down there altogether. Both announcements were made in the\r\ncoffee-room of the Crozier, to all whom it might or might not concern,\r\nby the stranger as he stood with his back to the empty fireplace,\r\nwaiting for his fried sole, veal cutlet, and pint of sherry. And the\r\nwaiter (business being chronically slack at the Crozier) represented\r\nall whom it might or might not concern, and absorbed the whole of the\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman’s white head was unusually large, and his shock of white\r\nhair was unusually thick and ample. “I suppose, waiter,” he said,\r\nshaking his shock of hair, as a Newfoundland dog might shake his before\r\nsitting down to dinner, “that a fair lodging for a single buffer might\r\nbe found in these parts, eh?”\r\n\r\nThe waiter had no doubt of it.\r\n\r\n“Something old,” said the gentleman. “Take my hat down for a moment\r\nfrom that peg, will you? No, I don’t want it; look into it. What do you\r\nsee written there?”\r\n\r\nThe waiter read: “Datchery.”\r\n\r\n“Now you know my name,” said the gentleman; “Dick Datchery. Hang it up\r\nagain. I was saying something old is what I should prefer, something\r\nodd and out of the way; something venerable, architectural, and\r\ninconvenient.”\r\n\r\n“We have a good choice of inconvenient lodgings in the town, sir, I\r\nthink,” replied the waiter, with modest confidence in its resources\r\nthat way; “indeed, I have no doubt that we could suit you that far,\r\nhowever particular you might be. But a architectural lodging!” That\r\nseemed to trouble the waiter’s head, and he shook it.\r\n\r\n“Anything Cathedraly, now,” Mr. Datchery suggested.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Tope,” said the waiter, brightening, as he rubbed his chin with\r\nhis hand, “would be the likeliest party to inform in that line.”\r\n\r\n“Who is Mr. Tope?” inquired Dick Datchery.\r\n\r\nThe waiter explained that he was the Verger, and that Mrs. Tope had\r\nindeed once upon a time let lodgings herself or offered to let them;\r\nbut that as nobody had ever taken them, Mrs. Tope’s window-bill, long a\r\nCloisterham Institution, had disappeared; probably had tumbled down one\r\nday, and never been put up again.\r\n\r\n“I’ll call on Mrs. Tope,” said Mr. Datchery, “after dinner.”\r\n\r\nSo when he had done his dinner, he was duly directed to the spot, and\r\nsallied out for it. But the Crozier being an hotel of a most retiring\r\ndisposition, and the waiter’s directions being fatally precise, he soon\r\nbecame bewildered, and went boggling about and about the Cathedral\r\nTower, whenever he could catch a glimpse of it, with a general\r\nimpression on his mind that Mrs. Tope’s was somewhere very near it, and\r\nthat, like the children in the game of hot boiled beans and very good\r\nbutter, he was warm in his search when he saw the Tower, and cold when\r\nhe didn’t see it.\r\n\r\nHe was getting very cold indeed when he came upon a fragment of\r\nburial-ground in which an unhappy sheep was grazing. Unhappy, because a\r\nhideous small boy was stoning it through the railings, and had already\r\nlamed it in one leg, and was much excited by the benevolent\r\nsportsmanlike purpose of breaking its other three legs, and bringing it\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n“’It ’im agin!” cried the boy, as the poor creature leaped; “and made a\r\ndint in his wool.”\r\n\r\n“Let him be!” said Mr. Datchery. “Don’t you see you have lamed him?”\r\n\r\n“Yer lie,” returned the sportsman. “’E went and lamed isself. I see ’im\r\ndo it, and I giv’ ’im a shy as a Widdy-warning to ’im not to go\r\na-bruisin’ ’is master’s mutton any more.”\r\n\r\n“Come here.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t; I’ll come when yer can ketch me.”\r\n\r\n“Stay there then, and show me which is Mr. Tope’s.”\r\n\r\n“Ow can I stay here and show you which is Topeseses, when Topeseses is\r\nt’other side the Kinfreederal, and over the crossings, and round ever\r\nso many comers? Stoo-pid! Ya-a-ah!”\r\n\r\n“Show me where it is, and I’ll give you something.”\r\n\r\n“Come on, then.”\r\n\r\nThis brisk dialogue concluded, the boy led the way, and by-and-by\r\nstopped at some distance from an arched passage, pointing.\r\n\r\n“Lookie yonder. You see that there winder and door?”\r\n\r\n“That’s Tope’s?”\r\n\r\n“Yer lie; it ain’t. That’s Jarsper’s.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Mr. Datchery, with a second look of some interest.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and I ain’t a-goin’ no nearer ’IM, I tell yer.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“’Cos I ain’t a-goin’ to be lifted off my legs and ’ave my braces bust\r\nand be choked; not if I knows it, and not by ’Im. Wait till I set a\r\njolly good flint a-flyin’ at the back o’ ’is jolly old ’ed some day!\r\nNow look t’other side the harch; not the side where Jarsper’s door is;\r\nt’other side.”\r\n\r\n“I see.”\r\n\r\n“A little way in, o’ that side, there’s a low door, down two steps.\r\nThat’s Topeseses with ’is name on a hoval plate.”\r\n\r\n“Good. See here,” said Mr. Datchery, producing a shilling. “You owe me\r\nhalf of this.”\r\n\r\n“Yer lie! I don’t owe yer nothing; I never seen yer.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you you owe me half of this, because I have no sixpence in my\r\npocket. So the next time you meet me you shall do something else for\r\nme, to pay me.”\r\n\r\n“All right, give us ’old.”\r\n\r\n“What is your name, and where do you live?”\r\n\r\n“Deputy. Travellers’ Twopenny, ’cross the green.”\r\n\r\nThe boy instantly darted off with the shilling, lest Mr. Datchery\r\nshould repent, but stopped at a safe distance, on the happy chance of\r\nhis being uneasy in his mind about it, to goad him with a demon dance\r\nexpressive of its irrevocability.\r\n\r\nMr. Datchery, taking off his hat to give that shock of white hair of\r\nhis another shake, seemed quite resigned, and betook himself whither he\r\nhad been directed.\r\n\r\nMr. Tope’s official dwelling, communicating by an upper stair with Mr.\r\nJasper’s (hence Mrs. Tope’s attendance on that gentleman), was of very\r\nmodest proportions, and partook of the character of a cool dungeon. Its\r\nancient walls were massive, and its rooms rather seemed to have been\r\ndug out of them, than to have been designed beforehand with any\r\nreference to them. The main door opened at once on a chamber of no\r\ndescribable shape, with a groined roof, which in its turn opened on\r\nanother chamber of no describable shape, with another groined roof:\r\ntheir windows small, and in the thickness of the walls. These two\r\nchambers, close as to their atmosphere, and swarthy as to their\r\nillumination by natural light, were the apartments which Mrs. Tope had\r\nso long offered to an unappreciative city. Mr. Datchery, however, was\r\nmore appreciative. He found that if he sat with the main door open he\r\nwould enjoy the passing society of all comers to and fro by the\r\ngateway, and would have light enough. He found that if Mr. and Mrs.\r\nTope, living overhead, used for their own egress and ingress a little\r\nside stair that came plump into the Precincts by a door opening\r\noutward, to the surprise and inconvenience of a limited public of\r\npedestrians in a narrow way, he would be alone, as in a separate\r\nresidence. He found the rent moderate, and everything as quaintly\r\ninconvenient as he could desire. He agreed, therefore, to take the\r\nlodging then and there, and money down, possession to be had next\r\nevening, on condition that reference was permitted him to Mr. Jasper as\r\noccupying the gatehouse, of which on the other side of the gateway, the\r\nVerger’s hole-in-the-wall was an appanage or subsidiary part.\r\n\r\nThe poor dear gentleman was very solitary and very sad, Mrs. Tope said,\r\nbut she had no doubt he would “speak for her.” Perhaps Mr. Datchery had\r\nheard something of what had occurred there last winter?\r\n\r\nMr. Datchery had as confused a knowledge of the event in question, on\r\ntrying to recall it, as he well could have. He begged Mrs. Tope’s\r\npardon when she found it incumbent on her to correct him in every\r\ndetail of his summary of the facts, but pleaded that he was merely a\r\nsingle buffer getting through life upon his means as idly as he could,\r\nand that so many people were so constantly making away with so many\r\nother people, as to render it difficult for a buffer of an easy temper\r\nto preserve the circumstances of the several cases unmixed in his mind.\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper proving willing to speak for Mrs. Tope, Mr. Datchery, who\r\nhad sent up his card, was invited to ascend the postern staircase. The\r\nMayor was there, Mr. Tope said; but he was not to be regarded in the\r\nlight of company, as he and Mr. Jasper were great friends.\r\n\r\n“I beg pardon,” said Mr. Datchery, making a leg with his hat under his\r\narm, as he addressed himself equally to both gentlemen; “a selfish\r\nprecaution on my part, and not personally interesting to anybody but\r\nmyself. But as a buffer living on his means, and having an idea of\r\ndoing it in this lovely place in peace and quiet, for remaining span of\r\nlife, I beg to ask if the Tope family are quite respectable?”\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper could answer for that without the slightest hesitation.\r\n\r\n“That is enough, sir,” said Mr. Datchery.\r\n\r\n“My friend the Mayor,” added Mr. Jasper, presenting Mr. Datchery with a\r\ncourtly motion of his hand towards that potentate; “whose\r\nrecommendation is actually much more important to a stranger than that\r\nof an obscure person like myself, will testify in their behalf, I am\r\nsure.”\r\n\r\n“The Worshipful the Mayor,” said Mr. Datchery, with a low bow, “places\r\nme under an infinite obligation.”\r\n\r\n“Very good people, sir, Mr. and Mrs. Tope,” said Mr. Sapsea, with\r\ncondescension. “Very good opinions. Very well behaved. Very respectful.\r\nMuch approved by the Dean and Chapter.”\r\n\r\n“The Worshipful the Mayor gives them a character,” said Mr. Datchery,\r\n“of which they may indeed be proud. I would ask His Honour (if I might\r\nbe permitted) whether there are not many objects of great interest in\r\nthe city which is under his beneficent sway?”\r\n\r\n“We are, sir,” returned Mr. Sapsea, “an ancient city, and an\r\necclesiastical city. We are a constitutional city, as it becomes such a\r\ncity to be, and we uphold and maintain our glorious privileges.”\r\n\r\n“His Honour,” said Mr. Datchery, bowing, “inspires me with a desire to\r\nknow more of the city, and confirms me in my inclination to end my days\r\nin the city.”\r\n\r\n“Retired from the Army, sir?” suggested Mr. Sapsea.\r\n\r\n“His Honour the Mayor does me too much credit,” returned Mr. Datchery.\r\n\r\n“Navy, sir?” suggested Mr. Sapsea.\r\n\r\n“Again,” repeated Mr. Datchery, “His Honour the Mayor does me too much\r\ncredit.”\r\n\r\n“Diplomacy is a fine profession,” said Mr. Sapsea, as a general remark.\r\n\r\n“There, I confess, His Honour the Mayor is too many for me,” said Mr.\r\nDatchery, with an ingenious smile and bow; “even a diplomatic bird must\r\nfall to such a gun.”\r\n\r\nNow this was very soothing. Here was a gentleman of a great, not to say\r\na grand, address, accustomed to rank and dignity, really setting a fine\r\nexample how to behave to a Mayor. There was something in that\r\nthird-person style of being spoken to, that Mr. Sapsea found\r\nparticularly recognisant of his merits and position.\r\n\r\n“But I crave pardon,” said Mr. Datchery. “His Honour the Mayor will\r\nbear with me, if for a moment I have been deluded into occupying his\r\ntime, and have forgotten the humble claims upon my own, of my hotel,\r\nthe Crozier.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, sir,” said Mr. Sapsea. “I am returning home, and if you\r\nwould like to take the exterior of our Cathedral in your way, I shall\r\nbe glad to point it out.”\r\n\r\n“His Honour the Mayor,” said Mr. Datchery, “is more than kind and\r\ngracious.”\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Datchery, when he had made his acknowledgments to Mr. Jasper,\r\ncould not be induced to go out of the room before the Worshipful, the\r\nWorshipful led the way down-stairs; Mr. Datchery following with his hat\r\nunder his arm, and his shock of white hair streaming in the evening\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\n“Might I ask His Honour,” said Mr. Datchery, “whether that gentleman we\r\nhave just left is the gentleman of whom I have heard in the\r\nneighbourhood as being much afflicted by the loss of a nephew, and\r\nconcentrating his life on avenging the loss?”\r\n\r\n“That is the gentleman. John Jasper, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Would His Honour allow me to inquire whether there are strong\r\nsuspicions of any one?”\r\n\r\n“More than suspicions, sir,” returned Mr. Sapsea; “all but\r\ncertainties.”\r\n\r\n“Only think now!” cried Mr. Datchery.\r\n\r\n“But proof, sir, proof must be built up stone by stone,” said the\r\nMayor. “As I say, the end crowns the work. It is not enough that\r\njustice should be morally certain; she must be immorally\r\ncertain—legally, that is.”\r\n\r\n“His Honour,” said Mr. Datchery, “reminds me of the nature of the law.\r\nImmoral. How true!”\r\n\r\n“As I say, sir,” pompously went on the Mayor, “the arm of the law is a\r\nstrong arm, and a long arm. That is the way I put it. A strong arm and\r\na long arm.”\r\n\r\n“How forcible!—And yet, again, how true!” murmured Mr. Datchery.\r\n\r\n“And without betraying, what I call the secrets of the prison-house,”\r\nsaid Mr. Sapsea; “the secrets of the prison-house is the term I used on\r\nthe bench.”\r\n\r\n“And what other term than His Honour’s would express it?” said Mr.\r\nDatchery.\r\n\r\n“Without, I say, betraying them, I predict to you, knowing the iron\r\nwill of the gentleman we have just left (I take the bold step of\r\ncalling it iron, on account of its strength), that in this case the\r\nlong arm will reach, and the strong arm will strike.—This is our\r\nCathedral, sir. The best judges are pleased to admire it, and the best\r\namong our townsmen own to being a little vain of it.”\r\n\r\nAll this time Mr. Datchery had walked with his hat under his arm, and\r\nhis white hair streaming. He had an odd momentary appearance upon him\r\nof having forgotten his hat, when Mr. Sapsea now touched it; and he\r\nclapped his hand up to his head as if with some vague expectation of\r\nfinding another hat upon it.\r\n\r\n“Pray be covered, sir,” entreated Mr. Sapsea; magnificently plying: “I\r\nshall not mind it, I assure you.”\r\n\r\n“His Honour is very good, but I do it for coolness,” said Mr. Datchery.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Datchery admired the Cathedral, and Mr. Sapsea pointed it out\r\nas if he himself had invented and built it: there were a few details\r\nindeed of which he did not approve, but those he glossed over, as if\r\nthe workmen had made mistakes in his absence. The Cathedral disposed\r\nof, he led the way by the churchyard, and stopped to extol the beauty\r\nof the evening—by chance—in the immediate vicinity of Mrs. Sapsea’s\r\nepitaph.\r\n\r\n“And by the by,” said Mr. Sapsea, appearing to descend from an\r\nelevation to remember it all of a sudden; like Apollo shooting down\r\nfrom Olympus to pick up his forgotten lyre; “_that_ is one of our small\r\nlions. The partiality of our people has made it so, and strangers have\r\nbeen seen taking a copy of it now and then. I am not a judge of it\r\nmyself, for it is a little work of my own. But it was troublesome to\r\nturn, sir; I may say, difficult to turn with elegance.”\r\n\r\nMr. Datchery became so ecstatic over Mr. Sapsea’s composition, that, in\r\nspite of his intention to end his days in Cloisterham, and therefore\r\nhis probably having in reserve many opportunities of copying it, he\r\nwould have transcribed it into his pocket-book on the spot, but for the\r\nslouching towards them of its material producer and perpetuator,\r\nDurdles, whom Mr. Sapsea hailed, not sorry to show him a bright example\r\nof behaviour to superiors.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Durdles! This is the mason, sir; one of our Cloisterham worthies;\r\neverybody here knows Durdles. Mr. Datchery, Durdles a gentleman who is\r\ngoing to settle here.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t do it if I was him,” growled Durdles. “We’re a heavy lot.”\r\n\r\n“You surely don’t speak for yourself, Mr. Durdles,” returned Mr.\r\nDatchery, “any more than for His Honour.”\r\n\r\n“Who’s His Honour?” demanded Durdles.\r\n\r\n“His Honour the Mayor.”\r\n\r\n“I never was brought afore him,” said Durdles, with anything but the\r\nlook of a loyal subject of the mayoralty, “and it’ll be time enough for\r\nme to Honour him when I am. Until which, and when, and where,\r\n\r\n‘Mister Sapsea is his name,\r\n    England is his nation,\r\nCloisterham’s his dwelling-place,\r\n    Aukshneer’s his occupation.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, Deputy (preceded by a flying oyster-shell) appeared upon the\r\nscene, and requested to have the sum of threepence instantly “chucked”\r\nto him by Mr. Durdles, whom he had been vainly seeking up and down, as\r\nlawful wages overdue. While that gentleman, with his bundle under his\r\narm, slowly found and counted out the money, Mr. Sapsea informed the\r\nnew settler of Durdles’s habits, pursuits, abode, and reputation. “I\r\nsuppose a curious stranger might come to see you, and your works, Mr.\r\nDurdles, at any odd time?” said Mr. Datchery upon that.\r\n\r\n“Any gentleman is welcome to come and see me any evening if he brings\r\nliquor for two with him,” returned Durdles, with a penny between his\r\nteeth and certain halfpence in his hands; “or if he likes to make it\r\ntwice two, he’ll be doubly welcome.”\r\n\r\n“I shall come. Master Deputy, what do you owe me?”\r\n\r\n“A job.”\r\n\r\n“Mind you pay me honestly with the job of showing me Mr. Durdles’s\r\nhouse when I want to go there.”\r\n\r\nDeputy, with a piercing broadside of whistle through the whole gap in\r\nhis mouth, as a receipt in full for all arrears, vanished.\r\n\r\nThe Worshipful and the Worshipper then passed on together until they\r\nparted, with many ceremonies, at the Worshipful’s door; even then the\r\nWorshipper carried his hat under his arm, and gave his streaming white\r\nhair to the breeze.\r\n\r\nSaid Mr. Datchery to himself that night, as he looked at his white hair\r\nin the gas-lighted looking-glass over the coffee-room chimneypiece at\r\nthe Crozier, and shook it out: “For a single buffer, of an easy temper,\r\nliving idly on his means, I have had a rather busy afternoon!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nSHADOW ON THE SUN-DIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain Miss Twinkleton has delivered her valedictory address, with the\r\naccompaniments of white-wine and pound-cake, and again the young ladies\r\nhave departed to their several homes. Helena Landless has left the\r\nNuns’ House to attend her brother’s fortunes, and pretty Rosa is alone.\r\n\r\nCloisterham is so bright and sunny in these summer days, that the\r\nCathedral and the monastery-ruin show as if their strong walls were\r\ntransparent. A soft glow seems to shine from within them, rather than\r\nupon them from without, such is their mellowness as they look forth on\r\nthe hot corn-fields and the smoking roads that distantly wind among\r\nthem. The Cloisterham gardens blush with ripening fruit. Time was when\r\ntravel-stained pilgrims rode in clattering parties through the city’s\r\nwelcome shades; time is when wayfarers, leading a gipsy life between\r\nhaymaking time and harvest, and looking as if they were just made of\r\nthe dust of the earth, so very dusty are they, lounge about on cool\r\ndoorsteps, trying to mend their unmendable shoes, or giving them to\r\nthe city kennels as a hopeless job, and seeking others in the bundles\r\nthat they carry, along with their yet unused sickles swathed in bands\r\nof straw. At all the more public pumps there is much cooling of bare\r\nfeet, together with much bubbling and gurgling of drinking with hand to\r\nspout on the part of these Bedouins; the Cloisterham police meanwhile\r\nlooking askant from their beats with suspicion, and manifest impatience\r\nthat the intruders should depart from within the civic bounds, and once\r\nmore fry themselves on the simmering high-roads.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of such a day, when the last Cathedral service is\r\ndone, and when that side of the High Street on which the Nuns’ House\r\nstands is in grateful shade, save where its quaint old garden opens to\r\nthe west between the boughs of trees, a servant informs Rosa, to her\r\nterror, that Mr. Jasper desires to see her.\r\n\r\nIf he had chosen his time for finding her at a disadvantage, he could\r\nhave done no better. Perhaps he has chosen it. Helena Landless is gone,\r\nMrs. Tisher is absent on leave, Miss Twinkleton (in her amateur state\r\nof existence) has contributed herself and a veal pie to a picnic.\r\n\r\n“O why, why, why, did you say I was at home!” cried Rosa, helplessly.\r\n\r\nThe maid replies, that Mr. Jasper never asked the question.\r\n\r\nThat he said he knew she was at home, and begged she might be told that\r\nhe asked to see her.\r\n\r\n“What shall I do! what shall I do!” thinks Rosa, clasping her hands.\r\n\r\nPossessed by a kind of desperation, she adds in the next breath, that\r\nshe will come to Mr. Jasper in the garden. She shudders at the thought\r\nof being shut up with him in the house; but many of its windows command\r\nthe garden, and she can be seen as well as heard there, and can shriek\r\nin the free air and run away. Such is the wild idea that flutters\r\nthrough her mind.\r\n\r\nShe has never seen him since the fatal night, except when she was\r\nquestioned before the Mayor, and then he was present in gloomy\r\nwatchfulness, as representing his lost nephew and burning to avenge\r\nhim. She hangs her garden-hat on her arm, and goes out. The moment she\r\nsees him from the porch, leaning on the sun-dial, the old horrible\r\nfeeling of being compelled by him, asserts its hold upon her. She feels\r\nthat she would even then go back, but that he draws her feet towards\r\nhim. She cannot resist, and sits down, with her head bent, on the\r\ngarden-seat beside the sun-dial. She cannot look up at him for\r\nabhorrence, but she has perceived that he is dressed in deep mourning.\r\nSo is she. It was not so at first; but the lost has long been given up,\r\nand mourned for, as dead.\r\n\r\nHe would begin by touching her hand. She feels the intention, and draws\r\nher hand back. His eyes are then fixed upon her, she knows, though her\r\nown see nothing but the grass.\r\n\r\n“I have been waiting,” he begins, “for some time, to be summoned back\r\nto my duty near you.”\r\n\r\nAfter several times forming her lips, which she knows he is closely\r\nwatching, into the shape of some other hesitating reply, and then into\r\nnone, she answers: “Duty, sir?”\r\n\r\n“The duty of teaching you, serving you as your faithful music-master.”\r\n\r\n“I have left off that study.”\r\n\r\n“Not left off, I think. Discontinued. I was told by your guardian that\r\nyou discontinued it under the shock that we have all felt so acutely.\r\nWhen will you resume?”\r\n\r\n“Never, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Never? You could have done no more if you had loved my dear boy.”\r\n\r\n“I did love him!” cried Rosa, with a flash of anger.\r\n\r\n“Yes; but not quite—not quite in the right way, shall I say? Not in the\r\nintended and expected way. Much as my dear boy was, unhappily, too\r\nself-conscious and self-satisfied (I’ll draw no parallel between him\r\nand you in that respect) to love as he should have loved, or as any one\r\nin his place would have loved—must have loved!”\r\n\r\nShe sits in the same still attitude, but shrinking a little more.\r\n\r\n“Then, to be told that you discontinued your study with me, was to be\r\npolitely told that you abandoned it altogether?” he suggested.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” says Rosa, with sudden spirit, “The politeness was my\r\nguardian’s, not mine. I told him that I was resolved to leave off, and\r\nthat I was determined to stand by my resolution.”\r\n\r\n“And you still are?”\r\n\r\n“I still am, sir. And I beg not to be questioned any more about it. At\r\nall events, I will not answer any more; I have that in my power.”\r\n\r\nShe is so conscious of his looking at her with a gloating admiration of\r\nthe touch of anger on her, and the fire and animation it brings with\r\nit, that even as her spirit rises, it falls again, and she struggles\r\nwith a sense of shame, affront, and fear, much as she did that night at\r\nthe piano.\r\n\r\n“I will not question you any more, since you object to it so much; I\r\nwill confess—”\r\n\r\n“I do not wish to hear you, sir,” cries Rosa, rising.\r\n\r\nThis time he does touch her with his outstretched hand. In shrinking\r\nfrom it, she shrinks into her seat again.\r\n\r\n“We must sometimes act in opposition to our wishes,” he tells her in a\r\nlow voice. “You must do so now, or do more harm to others than you can\r\never set right.”\r\n\r\n“What harm?”\r\n\r\n“Presently, presently. You question _me_, you see, and surely that’s\r\nnot fair when you forbid me to question you. Nevertheless, I will\r\nanswer the question presently. Dearest Rosa! Charming Rosa!”\r\n\r\nShe starts up again.\r\n\r\nThis time he does not touch her. But his face looks so wicked and\r\nmenacing, as he stands leaning against the sun-dial-setting, as it\r\nwere, his black mark upon the very face of day—that her flight is\r\narrested by horror as she looks at him.\r\n\r\n“I do not forget how many windows command a view of us,” he says,\r\nglancing towards them. “I will not touch you again; I will come no\r\nnearer to you than I am. Sit down, and there will be no mighty wonder\r\nin your music-master’s leaning idly against a pedestal and speaking\r\nwith you, remembering all that has happened, and our shares in it. Sit\r\ndown, my beloved.”\r\n\r\nShe would have gone once more—was all but gone—and once more his face,\r\ndarkly threatening what would follow if she went, has stopped her.\r\nLooking at him with the expression of the instant frozen on her face,\r\nshe sits down on the seat again.\r\n\r\n“Rosa, even when my dear boy was affianced to you, I loved you madly;\r\neven when I thought his happiness in having you for his wife was\r\ncertain, I loved you madly; even when I strove to make him more\r\nardently devoted to you, I loved you madly; even when he gave me the\r\npicture of your lovely face so carelessly traduced by him, which I\r\nfeigned to hang always in my sight for his sake, but worshipped in\r\ntorment for years, I loved you madly; in the distasteful work of the\r\nday, in the wakeful misery of the night, girded by sordid realities, or\r\nwandering through Paradises and Hells of visions into which I rushed,\r\ncarrying your image in my arms, I loved you madly.”\r\n\r\nIf anything could make his words more hideous to her than they are in\r\nthemselves, it would be the contrast between the violence of his look\r\nand delivery, and the composure of his assumed attitude.\r\n\r\n“I endured it all in silence. So long as you were his, or so long as I\r\nsupposed you to be his, I hid my secret loyally. Did I not?”\r\n\r\nThis lie, so gross, while the mere words in which it is told are so\r\ntrue, is more than Rosa can endure. She answers with kindling\r\nindignation: “You were as false throughout, sir, as you are now. You\r\nwere false to him, daily and hourly. You know that you made my life\r\nunhappy by your pursuit of me. You know that you made me afraid to open\r\nhis generous eyes, and that you forced me, for his own trusting, good,\r\ngood sake, to keep the truth from him, that you were a bad, bad man!”\r\n\r\nHis preservation of his easy attitude rendering his working features\r\nand his convulsive hands absolutely diabolical, he returns, with a\r\nfierce extreme of admiration:\r\n\r\n“How beautiful you are! You are more beautiful in anger than in repose.\r\nI don’t ask you for your love; give me yourself and your hatred; give\r\nme yourself and that pretty rage; give me yourself and that enchanting\r\nscorn; it will be enough for me.”\r\n\r\nImpatient tears rise to the eyes of the trembling little beauty, and\r\nher face flames; but as she again rises to leave him in indignation,\r\nand seek protection within the house, he stretches out his hand towards\r\nthe porch, as though he invited her to enter it.\r\n\r\n“I told you, you rare charmer, you sweet witch, that you must stay and\r\nhear me, or do more harm than can ever be undone. You asked me what\r\nharm. Stay, and I will tell you. Go, and I will do it!”\r\n\r\nAgain Rosa quails before his threatening face, though innocent of its\r\nmeaning, and she remains. Her panting breathing comes and goes as if it\r\nwould choke her; but with a repressive hand upon her bosom, she\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n“I have made my confession that my love is mad. It is so mad, that had\r\nthe ties between me and my dear lost boy been one silken thread less\r\nstrong, I might have swept even him from your side, when you favoured\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nA film comes over the eyes she raises for an instant, as though he had\r\nturned her faint.\r\n\r\n“Even him,” he repeats. “Yes, even him! Rosa, you see me and you hear\r\nme. Judge for yourself whether any other admirer shall love you and\r\nlive, whose life is in my hand.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, sir?”\r\n\r\n“I mean to show you how mad my love is. It was hawked through the late\r\ninquiries by Mr. Crisparkle, that young Landless had confessed to him\r\nthat he was a rival of my lost boy. That is an inexpiable offence in my\r\neyes. The same Mr. Crisparkle knows under my hand that I have devoted\r\nmyself to the murderer’s discovery and destruction, be he whom he\r\nmight, and that I determined to discuss the mystery with no one until I\r\nshould hold the clue in which to entangle the murderer as in a net. I\r\nhave since worked patiently to wind and wind it round him; and it is\r\nslowly winding as I speak.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jasper’s sacrifices]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Your belief, if you believe in the criminality of Mr. Landless, is not\r\nMr. Crisparkle’s belief, and he is a good man,” Rosa retorts.\r\n\r\n“My belief is my own; and I reserve it, worshipped of my soul!\r\nCircumstances may accumulate so strongly _even against an innocent\r\nman_, that directed, sharpened, and pointed, they may slay him. One\r\nwanting link discovered by perseverance against a guilty man, proves\r\nhis guilt, however slight its evidence before, and he dies. Young\r\nLandless stands in deadly peril either way.”\r\n\r\n“If you really suppose,” Rosa pleads with him, turning paler, “that I\r\nfavour Mr. Landless, or that Mr. Landless has ever in any way addressed\r\nhimself to me, you are wrong.”\r\n\r\nHe puts that from him with a slighting action of his hand and a curled\r\nlip.\r\n\r\n“I was going to show you how madly I love you. More madly now than\r\never, for I am willing to renounce the second object that has arisen in\r\nmy life to divide it with you; and henceforth to have no object in\r\nexistence but you only. Miss Landless has become your bosom friend. You\r\ncare for her peace of mind?”\r\n\r\n“I love her dearly.”\r\n\r\n“You care for her good name?”\r\n\r\n“I have said, sir, I love her dearly.”\r\n\r\n“I am unconsciously,” he observes with a smile, as he folds his hands\r\nupon the sun-dial and leans his chin upon them, so that his talk would\r\nseem from the windows (faces occasionally come and go there) to be of\r\nthe airiest and playfullest—“I am unconsciously giving offence by\r\nquestioning again. I will simply make statements, therefore, and not\r\nput questions. You do care for your bosom friend’s good name, and you\r\ndo care for her peace of mind. Then remove the shadow of the gallows\r\nfrom her, dear one!”\r\n\r\n“You dare propose to me to—”\r\n\r\n“Darling, I dare propose to you. Stop there. If it be bad to idolise\r\nyou, I am the worst of men; if it be good, I am the best. My love for\r\nyou is above all other love, and my truth to you is above all other\r\ntruth. Let me have hope and favour, and I am a forsworn man for your\r\nsake.”\r\n\r\nRosa puts her hands to her temples, and, pushing back her hair, looks\r\nwildly and abhorrently at him, as though she were trying to piece\r\ntogether what it is his deep purpose to present to her only in\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\n“Reckon up nothing at this moment, angel, but the sacrifices that I lay\r\nat those dear feet, which I could fall down among the vilest ashes and\r\nkiss, and put upon my head as a poor savage might. There is my fidelity\r\nto my dear boy after death. Tread upon it!”\r\n\r\nWith an action of his hands, as though he cast down something precious.\r\n\r\n“There is the inexpiable offence against my adoration of you. Spurn\r\nit!”\r\n\r\nWith a similar action.\r\n\r\n“There are my labours in the cause of a just vengeance for six toiling\r\nmonths. Crush them!”\r\n\r\nWith another repetition of the action.\r\n\r\n“There is my past and my present wasted life. There is the desolation\r\nof my heart and my soul. There is my peace; there is my despair. Stamp\r\nthem into the dust; so that you take me, were it even mortally hating\r\nme!”\r\n\r\nThe frightful vehemence of the man, now reaching its full height, so\r\nadditionally terrifies her as to break the spell that has held her to\r\nthe spot. She swiftly moves towards the porch; but in an instant he is\r\nat her side, and speaking in her ear.\r\n\r\n“Rosa, I am self-repressed again. I am walking calmly beside you to the\r\nhouse. I shall wait for some encouragement and hope. I shall not strike\r\ntoo soon. Give me a sign that you attend to me.”\r\n\r\nShe slightly and constrainedly moves her hand.\r\n\r\n“Not a word of this to any one, or it will bring down the blow, as\r\ncertainly as night follows day. Another sign that you attend to me.”\r\n\r\nShe moves her hand once more.\r\n\r\n“I love you, love you, love you! If you were to cast me off now—but you\r\nwill not—you would never be rid of me. No one should come between us. I\r\nwould pursue you to the death.”\r\n\r\nThe handmaid coming out to open the gate for him, he quietly pulls off\r\nhis hat as a parting salute, and goes away with no greater show of\r\nagitation than is visible in the effigy of Mr. Sapsea’s father\r\nopposite. Rosa faints in going up-stairs, and is carefully carried to\r\nher room and laid down on her bed. A thunderstorm is coming on, the\r\nmaids say, and the hot and stifling air has overset the pretty dear: no\r\nwonder; they have felt their own knees all of a tremble all day long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nA FLIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nRosa no sooner came to herself than the whole of the late interview was\r\nbefore her. It even seemed as if it had pursued her into her\r\ninsensibility, and she had not had a moment’s unconsciousness of it.\r\nWhat to do, she was at a frightened loss to know: the only one clear\r\nthought in her mind was, that she must fly from this terrible man.\r\n\r\nBut where could she take refuge, and how could she go? She had never\r\nbreathed her dread of him to any one but Helena. If she went to Helena,\r\nand told her what had passed, that very act might bring down the\r\nirreparable mischief that he threatened he had the power, and that she\r\nknew he had the will, to do. The more fearful he appeared to her\r\nexcited memory and imagination, the more alarming her responsibility\r\nappeared; seeing that a slight mistake on her part, either in action or\r\ndelay, might let his malevolence loose on Helena’s brother.\r\n\r\nRosa’s mind throughout the last six months had been stormily confused.\r\nA half-formed, wholly unexpressed suspicion tossed in it, now heaving\r\nitself up, and now sinking into the deep; now gaining palpability, and\r\nnow losing it. Jasper’s self-absorption in his nephew when he was\r\nalive, and his unceasing pursuit of the inquiry how he came by his\r\ndeath, if he were dead, were themes so rife in the place, that no one\r\nappeared able to suspect the possibility of foul play at his hands. She\r\nhad asked herself the question, “Am I so wicked in my thoughts as to\r\nconceive a wickedness that others cannot imagine?” Then she had\r\nconsidered, Did the suspicion come of her previous recoiling from him\r\nbefore the fact? And if so, was not that a proof of its baselessness?\r\nThen she had reflected, “What motive could he have, according to my\r\naccusation?” She was ashamed to answer in her mind, “The motive of\r\ngaining _me_!” And covered her face, as if the lightest shadow of the\r\nidea of founding murder on such an idle vanity were a crime almost as\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nShe ran over in her mind again, all that he had said by the sun-dial in\r\nthe garden. He had persisted in treating the disappearance as murder,\r\nconsistently with his whole public course since the finding of the\r\nwatch and shirt-pin. If he were afraid of the crime being traced out,\r\nwould he not rather encourage the idea of a voluntary disappearance? He\r\nhad even declared that if the ties between him and his nephew had been\r\nless strong, he might have swept “even him” away from her side. Was\r\nthat like his having really done so? He had spoken of laying his six\r\nmonths’ labours in the cause of a just vengeance at her feet. Would he\r\nhave done that, with that violence of passion, if they were a pretence?\r\nWould he have ranged them with his desolate heart and soul, his wasted\r\nlife, his peace and his despair? The very first sacrifice that he\r\nrepresented himself as making for her, was his fidelity to his dear boy\r\nafter death. Surely these facts were strong against a fancy that\r\nscarcely dared to hint itself. And yet he was so terrible a man! In\r\nshort, the poor girl (for what could she know of the criminal\r\nintellect, which its own professed students perpetually misread,\r\nbecause they persist in trying to reconcile it with the average\r\nintellect of average men, instead of identifying it as a horrible\r\nwonder apart) could get by no road to any other conclusion than that he\r\n_was_ a terrible man, and must be fled from.\r\n\r\nShe had been Helena’s stay and comfort during the whole time. She had\r\nconstantly assured her of her full belief in her brother’s innocence,\r\nand of her sympathy with him in his misery. But she had never seen him\r\nsince the disappearance, nor had Helena ever spoken one word of his\r\navowal to Mr. Crisparkle in regard of Rosa, though as a part of the\r\ninterest of the case it was well known far and wide. He was Helena’s\r\nunfortunate brother, to her, and nothing more. The assurance she had\r\ngiven her odious suitor was strictly true, though it would have been\r\nbetter (she considered now) if she could have restrained herself from\r\nso giving it. Afraid of him as the bright and delicate little creature\r\nwas, her spirit swelled at the thought of his knowing it from her own\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nBut where was she to go? Anywhere beyond his reach, was no reply to the\r\nquestion. Somewhere must be thought of. She determined to go to her\r\nguardian, and to go immediately. The feeling she had imparted to Helena\r\non the night of their first confidence, was so strong upon her—the\r\nfeeling of not being safe from him, and of the solid walls of the old\r\nconvent being powerless to keep out his ghostly following of her—that\r\nno reasoning of her own could calm her terrors. The fascination of\r\nrepulsion had been upon her so long, and now culminated so darkly, that\r\nshe felt as if he had power to bind her by a spell. Glancing out at\r\nwindow, even now, as she rose to dress, the sight of the sun-dial on\r\nwhich he had leaned when he declared himself, turned her cold, and made\r\nher shrink from it, as though he had invested it with some awful\r\nquality from his own nature.\r\n\r\nShe wrote a hurried note to Miss Twinkleton, saying that she had sudden\r\nreason for wishing to see her guardian promptly, and had gone to him;\r\nalso, entreating the good lady not to be uneasy, for all was well with\r\nher. She hurried a few quite useless articles into a very little bag,\r\nleft the note in a conspicuous place, and went out, softly closing the\r\ngate after her.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time she had ever been even in Cloisterham High Street\r\nalone. But knowing all its ways and windings very well, she hurried\r\nstraight to the corner from which the omnibus departed. It was, at that\r\nvery moment, going off.\r\n\r\n“Stop and take me, if you please, Joe. I am obliged to go to London.”\r\n\r\nIn less than another minute she was on her road to the railway, under\r\nJoe’s protection. Joe waited on her when she got there, put her safely\r\ninto the railway carriage, and handed in the very little bag after her,\r\nas though it were some enormous trunk, hundredweights heavy, which she\r\nmust on no account endeavour to lift.\r\n\r\n“Can you go round when you get back, and tell Miss Twinkleton that you\r\nsaw me safely off, Joe?”\r\n\r\n“It shall be done, Miss.”\r\n\r\n“With my love, please, Joe.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Miss—and I wouldn’t mind having it myself!” But Joe did not\r\narticulate the last clause; only thought it.\r\n\r\nNow that she was whirling away for London in real earnest, Rosa was at\r\nleisure to resume the thoughts which her personal hurry had checked.\r\nThe indignant thought that his declaration of love soiled her; that she\r\ncould only be cleansed from the stain of its impurity by appealing to\r\nthe honest and true; supported her for a time against her fears, and\r\nconfirmed her in her hasty resolution. But as the evening grew darker\r\nand darker, and the great city impended nearer and nearer, the doubts\r\nusual in such cases began to arise. Whether this was not a wild\r\nproceeding, after all; how Mr. Grewgious might regard it; whether she\r\nshould find him at the journey’s end; how she would act if he were\r\nabsent; what might become of her, alone, in a place so strange and\r\ncrowded; how if she had but waited and taken counsel first; whether, if\r\nshe could now go back, she would not do it thankfully; a multitude of\r\nsuch uneasy speculations disturbed her, more and more as they\r\naccumulated. At length the train came into London over the housetops;\r\nand down below lay the gritty streets with their yet un-needed lamps\r\na-glow, on a hot, light, summer night.\r\n\r\n“Hiram Grewgious, Esquire, Staple Inn, London.” This was all Rosa knew\r\nof her destination; but it was enough to send her rattling away again\r\nin a cab, through deserts of gritty streets, where many people crowded\r\nat the corner of courts and byways to get some air, and where many\r\nother people walked with a miserably monotonous noise of shuffling of\r\nfeet on hot paving-stones, and where all the people and all their\r\nsurroundings were so gritty and so shabby!\r\n\r\nThere was music playing here and there, but it did not enliven the\r\ncase. No barrel-organ mended the matter, and no big drum beat dull care\r\naway. Like the chapel bells that were also going here and there, they\r\nonly seemed to evoke echoes from brick surfaces, and dust from\r\neverything. As to the flat wind-instruments, they seemed to have\r\ncracked their hearts and souls in pining for the country.\r\n\r\nHer jingling conveyance stopped at last at a fast-closed gateway, which\r\nappeared to belong to somebody who had gone to bed very early, and was\r\nmuch afraid of housebreakers; Rosa, discharging her conveyance, timidly\r\nknocked at this gateway, and was let in, very little bag and all, by a\r\nwatchman.\r\n\r\n“Does Mr. Grewgious live here?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Grewgious lives there, Miss,” said the watchman, pointing further\r\nin.\r\n\r\nSo Rosa went further in, and, when the clocks were striking ten, stood\r\non P. J. T.’s doorsteps, wondering what P. J. T. had done with his\r\nstreet-door.\r\n\r\nGuided by the painted name of Mr. Grewgious, she went up-stairs and\r\nsoftly tapped and tapped several times. But no one answering, and Mr.\r\nGrewgious’s door-handle yielding to her touch, she went in, and saw her\r\nguardian sitting on a window-seat at an open window, with a shaded lamp\r\nplaced far from him on a table in a corner.\r\n\r\nRosa drew nearer to him in the twilight of the room. He saw her, and he\r\nsaid, in an undertone: “Good Heaven!”\r\n\r\nRosa fell upon his neck, with tears, and then he said, returning her\r\nembrace:\r\n\r\n“My child, my child! I thought you were your mother!—But what, what,\r\nwhat,” he added, soothingly, “has happened? My dear, what has brought\r\nyou here? Who has brought you here?”\r\n\r\n“No one. I came alone.”\r\n\r\n“Lord bless me!” ejaculated Mr. Grewgious. “Came alone! Why didn’t you\r\nwrite to me to come and fetch you?”\r\n\r\n“I had no time. I took a sudden resolution. Poor, poor Eddy!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, poor fellow, poor fellow!”\r\n\r\n“His uncle has made love to me. I cannot bear it,” said Rosa, at once\r\nwith a burst of tears, and a stamp of her little foot; “I shudder with\r\nhorror of him, and I have come to you to protect me and all of us from\r\nhim, if you will?”\r\n\r\n“I will,” cried Mr. Grewgious, with a sudden rush of amazing energy.\r\n“Damn him!\r\n\r\n‘Confound his politics!\r\nFrustrate his knavish tricks!\r\nOn Thee his hopes to fix?\r\n        Damn him again!’”\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this most extraordinary outburst, Mr. Grewgious, quite beside\r\nhimself, plunged about the room, to all appearance undecided whether he\r\nwas in a fit of loyal enthusiasm, or combative denunciation.\r\n\r\nHe stopped and said, wiping his face: “I beg your pardon, my dear, but\r\nyou will be glad to know I feel better. Tell me no more just now, or I\r\nmight do it again. You must be refreshed and cheered. What did you take\r\nlast? Was it breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea, or supper? And what will\r\nyou take next? Shall it be breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea, or supper?”\r\n\r\nThe respectful tenderness with which, on one knee before her, he helped\r\nher to remove her hat, and disentangle her pretty hair from it, was\r\nquite a chivalrous sight. Yet who, knowing him only on the surface,\r\nwould have expected chivalry—and of the true sort, too; not the\r\nspurious—from Mr. Grewgious?\r\n\r\n“Your rest too must be provided for,” he went on; “and you shall have\r\nthe prettiest chamber in Furnival’s. Your toilet must be provided for,\r\nand you shall have everything that an unlimited head chambermaid—by\r\nwhich expression I mean a head chambermaid not limited as to outlay—can\r\nprocure. Is that a bag?” he looked hard at it; sooth to say, it\r\nrequired hard looking at to be seen at all in a dimly lighted room:\r\n“and is it your property, my dear?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. I brought it with me.”\r\n\r\n“It is not an extensive bag,” said Mr. Grewgious, candidly, “though\r\nadmirably calculated to contain a day’s provision for a canary-bird.\r\nPerhaps you brought a canary-bird?”\r\n\r\nRosa smiled and shook her head.\r\n\r\n“If you had, he should have been made welcome,” said Mr. Grewgious,\r\n“and I think he would have been pleased to be hung upon a nail outside\r\nand pit himself against our Staple sparrows; whose execution must be\r\nadmitted to be not quite equal to their intention. Which is the case\r\nwith so many of us! You didn’t say what meal, my dear. Have a nice\r\njumble of all meals.”\r\n\r\nRosa thanked him, but said she could only take a cup of tea. Mr.\r\nGrewgious, after several times running out, and in again, to mention\r\nsuch supplementary items as marmalade, eggs, watercresses, salted fish,\r\nand frizzled ham, ran across to Furnival’s without his hat, to give his\r\nvarious directions. And soon afterwards they were realised in practice,\r\nand the board was spread.\r\n\r\n“Lord bless my soul,” cried Mr. Grewgious, putting the lamp upon it,\r\nand taking his seat opposite Rosa; “what a new sensation for a poor old\r\nAngular bachelor, to be sure!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Grewgious experiences a new sensation]\r\n\r\n\r\nRosa’s expressive little eyebrows asked him what he meant?\r\n\r\n“The sensation of having a sweet young presence in the place, that\r\nwhitewashes it, paints it, papers it, decorates it with gilding, and\r\nmakes it Glorious!” said Mr. Grewgious. “Ah me! Ah me!”\r\n\r\nAs there was something mournful in his sigh, Rosa, in touching him with\r\nher tea-cup, ventured to touch him with her small hand too.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, my dear,” said Mr. Grewgious. “Ahem! Let’s talk!”\r\n\r\n“Do you always live here, sir?” asked Rosa.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“And always alone?”\r\n\r\n“Always alone; except that I have daily company in a gentleman by the\r\nname of Bazzard, my clerk.”\r\n\r\n“_He_ doesn’t live here?”\r\n\r\n“No, he goes his way, after office hours. In fact, he is off duty here,\r\naltogether, just at present; and a firm down-stairs, with which I have\r\nbusiness relations, lend me a substitute. But it would be extremely\r\ndifficult to replace Mr. Bazzard.”\r\n\r\n“He must be very fond of you,” said Rosa.\r\n\r\n“He bears up against it with commendable fortitude if he is,” returned\r\nMr. Grewgious, after considering the matter. “But I doubt if he is. Not\r\nparticularly so. You see, he is discontented, poor fellow.”\r\n\r\n“Why isn’t he contented?” was the natural inquiry.\r\n\r\n“Misplaced,” said Mr. Grewgious, with great mystery.\r\n\r\nRosa’s eyebrows resumed their inquisitive and perplexed expression.\r\n\r\n“So misplaced,” Mr. Grewgious went on, “that I feel constantly\r\napologetic towards him. And he feels (though he doesn’t mention it)\r\nthat I have reason to be.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious had by this time grown so very mysterious, that Rosa did\r\nnot know how to go on. While she was thinking about it Mr. Grewgious\r\nsuddenly jerked out of himself for the second time:\r\n\r\n“Let’s talk. We were speaking of Mr. Bazzard. It’s a secret, and\r\nmoreover it is Mr. Bazzard’s secret; but the sweet presence at my table\r\nmakes me so unusually expansive, that I feel I must impart it in\r\ninviolable confidence. What do you think Mr. Bazzard has done?”\r\n\r\n“O dear!” cried Rosa, drawing her chair a little nearer, and her mind\r\nreverting to Jasper, “nothing dreadful, I hope?”\r\n\r\n“He has written a play,” said Mr. Grewgious, in a solemn whisper. “A\r\ntragedy.”\r\n\r\nRosa seemed much relieved.\r\n\r\n“And nobody,” pursued Mr. Grewgious in the same tone, “will hear, on\r\nany account whatever, of bringing it out.”\r\n\r\nRosa looked reflective, and nodded her head slowly; as who should say,\r\n“Such things are, and why are they!”\r\n\r\n“Now, you know,” said Mr. Grewgious, “_I_ couldn’t write a play.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bad one, sir?” said Rosa, innocently, with her eyebrows again in\r\naction.\r\n\r\n“No. If I was under sentence of decapitation, and was about to be\r\ninstantly decapitated, and an express arrived with a pardon for the\r\ncondemned convict Grewgious if he wrote a play, I should be under the\r\nnecessity of resuming the block, and begging the executioner to proceed\r\nto extremities,—meaning,” said Mr. Grewgious, passing his hand under\r\nhis chin, “the singular number, and this extremity.”\r\n\r\nRosa appeared to consider what she would do if the awkward\r\nsupposititious case were hers.\r\n\r\n“Consequently,” said Mr. Grewgious, “Mr. Bazzard would have a sense of\r\nmy inferiority to himself under any circumstances; but when I am his\r\nmaster, you know, the case is greatly aggravated.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious shook his head seriously, as if he felt the offence to be\r\na little too much, though of his own committing.\r\n\r\n“How came you to be his master, sir?” asked Rosa.\r\n\r\n“A question that naturally follows,” said Mr. Grewgious. “Let’s talk.\r\nMr. Bazzard’s father, being a Norfolk farmer, would have furiously laid\r\nabout him with a flail, a pitch-fork, and every agricultural implement\r\navailable for assaulting purposes, on the slightest hint of his son’s\r\nhaving written a play. So the son, bringing to me the father’s rent\r\n(which I receive), imparted his secret, and pointed out that he was\r\ndetermined to pursue his genius, and that it would put him in peril of\r\nstarvation, and that he was not formed for it.”\r\n\r\n“For pursuing his genius, sir?”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear,” said Mr. Grewgious, “for starvation. It was impossible\r\nto deny the position, that Mr. Bazzard was not formed to be starved,\r\nand Mr. Bazzard then pointed out that it was desirable that I should\r\nstand between him and a fate so perfectly unsuited to his formation. In\r\nthat way Mr. Bazzard became my clerk, and he feels it very much.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad he is grateful,” said Rosa.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t quite mean that, my dear. I mean, that he feels the\r\ndegradation. There are some other geniuses that Mr. Bazzard has become\r\nacquainted with, who have also written tragedies, which likewise nobody\r\nwill on any account whatever hear of bringing out, and these choice\r\nspirits dedicate their plays to one another in a highly panegyrical\r\nmanner. Mr. Bazzard has been the subject of one of these dedications.\r\nNow, you know, I never had a play dedicated to _me_!”\r\n\r\nRosa looked at him as if she would have liked him to be the recipient\r\nof a thousand dedications.\r\n\r\n“Which again, naturally, rubs against the grain of Mr. Bazzard,” said\r\nMr. Grewgious. “He is very short with me sometimes, and then I feel\r\nthat he is meditating, ‘This blockhead is my master! A fellow who\r\ncouldn’t write a tragedy on pain of death, and who will never have one\r\ndedicated to him with the most complimentary congratulations on the\r\nhigh position he has taken in the eyes of posterity!’ Very trying, very\r\ntrying. However, in giving him directions, I reflect beforehand:\r\n‘Perhaps he may not like this,’ or ‘He might take it ill if I asked\r\nthat;’ and so we get on very well. Indeed, better than I could have\r\nexpected.”\r\n\r\n“Is the tragedy named, sir?” asked Rosa.\r\n\r\n“Strictly between ourselves,” answered Mr. Grewgious, “it has a\r\ndreadfully appropriate name. It is called The Thorn of Anxiety. But Mr.\r\nBazzard hopes—and I hope—that it will come out at last.”\r\n\r\nIt was not hard to divine that Mr. Grewgious had related the Bazzard\r\nhistory thus fully, at least quite as much for the recreation of his\r\nward’s mind from the subject that had driven her there, as for the\r\ngratification of his own tendency to be social and communicative.\r\n\r\n“And now, my dear,” he said at this point, “if you are not too tired to\r\ntell me more of what passed to-day—but only if you feel quite able—I\r\nshould be glad to hear it. I may digest it the better, if I sleep on it\r\nto-night.”\r\n\r\nRosa, composed now, gave him a faithful account of the interview. Mr.\r\nGrewgious often smoothed his head while it was in progress, and begged\r\nto be told a second time those parts which bore on Helena and Neville.\r\nWhen Rosa had finished, he sat grave, silent, and meditative for a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n“Clearly narrated,” was his only remark at last, “and, I hope, clearly\r\nput away here,” smoothing his head again. “See, my dear,” taking her to\r\nthe open window, “where they live! The dark windows over yonder.”\r\n\r\n“I may go to Helena to-morrow?” asked Rosa.\r\n\r\n“I should like to sleep on that question to-night,” he answered\r\ndoubtfully. “But let me take you to your own rest, for you must need\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nWith that Mr. Grewgious helped her to get her hat on again, and hung\r\nupon his arm the very little bag that was of no earthly use, and led\r\nher by the hand (with a certain stately awkwardness, as if he were\r\ngoing to walk a minuet) across Holborn, and into Furnival’s Inn. At the\r\nhotel door, he confided her to the Unlimited head chambermaid, and said\r\nthat while she went up to see her room, he would remain below, in case\r\nshe should wish it exchanged for another, or should find that there was\r\nanything she wanted.\r\n\r\nRosa’s room was airy, clean, comfortable, almost gay. The Unlimited had\r\nlaid in everything omitted from the very little bag (that is to say,\r\neverything she could possibly need), and Rosa tripped down the great\r\nmany stairs again, to thank her guardian for his thoughtful and\r\naffectionate care of her.\r\n\r\n“Not at all, my dear,” said Mr. Grewgious, infinitely gratified; “it is\r\nI who thank you for your charming confidence and for your charming\r\ncompany. Your breakfast will be provided for you in a neat, compact,\r\nand graceful little sitting-room (appropriate to your figure), and I\r\nwill come to you at ten o’clock in the morning. I hope you don’t feel\r\nvery strange indeed, in this strange place.”\r\n\r\n“O no, I feel so safe!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you may be sure that the stairs are fire-proof,” said Mr.\r\nGrewgious, “and that any outbreak of the devouring element would be\r\nperceived and suppressed by the watchmen.”\r\n\r\n“I did not mean that,” Rosa replied. “I mean, I feel so safe from him.”\r\n\r\n“There is a stout gate of iron bars to keep him out,” said Mr.\r\nGrewgious, smiling; “and Furnival’s is fire-proof, and specially\r\nwatched and lighted, and _I_ live over the way!” In the stoutness of\r\nhis knight-errantry, he seemed to think the last-named protection all\r\nsufficient. In the same spirit he said to the gate-porter as he went\r\nout, “If some one staying in the hotel should wish to send across the\r\nroad to me in the night, a crown will be ready for the messenger.” In\r\nthe same spirit, he walked up and down outside the iron gate for the\r\nbest part of an hour, with some solicitude; occasionally looking in\r\nbetween the bars, as if he had laid a dove in a high roost in a cage of\r\nlions, and had it on his mind that she might tumble out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nA RECOGNITION\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing occurred in the night to flutter the tired dove; and the dove\r\narose refreshed. With Mr. Grewgious, when the clock struck ten in the\r\nmorning, came Mr. Crisparkle, who had come at one plunge out of the\r\nriver at Cloisterham.\r\n\r\n“Miss Twinkleton was so uneasy, Miss Rosa,” he explained to her, “and\r\ncame round to Ma and me with your note, in such a state of wonder,\r\nthat, to quiet her, I volunteered on this service by the very first\r\ntrain to be caught in the morning. I wished at the time that you had\r\ncome to me; but now I think it best that you did _as_ you did, and came\r\nto your guardian.”\r\n\r\n“I did think of you,” Rosa told him; “but Minor Canon Corner was so\r\nnear him—”\r\n\r\n“I understand. It was quite natural.”\r\n\r\n“I have told Mr. Crisparkle,” said Mr. Grewgious, “all that you told me\r\nlast night, my dear. Of course I should have written it to him\r\nimmediately; but his coming was most opportune. And it was particularly\r\nkind of him to come, for he had but just gone.”\r\n\r\n“Have you settled,” asked Rosa, appealing to them both, “what is to be\r\ndone for Helena and her brother?”\r\n\r\n“Why really,” said Mr. Crisparkle, “I am in great perplexity. If even\r\nMr. Grewgious, whose head is much longer than mine, and who is a whole\r\nnight’s cogitation in advance of me, is undecided, what must I be!”\r\n\r\nThe Unlimited here put her head in at the door—after having rapped, and\r\nbeen authorised to present herself—announcing that a gentleman wished\r\nfor a word with another gentleman named Crisparkle, if any such\r\ngentleman were there. If no such gentleman were there, he begged pardon\r\nfor being mistaken.\r\n\r\n“Such a gentleman is here,” said Mr. Crisparkle, “but is engaged just\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a dark gentleman?” interposed Rosa, retreating on her guardian.\r\n\r\n“No, Miss, more of a brown gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“You are sure not with black hair?” asked Rosa, taking courage.\r\n\r\n“Quite sure of that, Miss. Brown hair and blue eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” hinted Mr. Grewgious, with habitual caution, “it might be\r\nwell to see him, reverend sir, if you don’t object. When one is in a\r\ndifficulty or at a loss, one never knows in what direction a way out\r\nmay chance to open. It is a business principle of mine, in such a case,\r\nnot to close up any direction, but to keep an eye on every direction\r\nthat may present itself. I could relate an anecdote in point, but that\r\nit would be premature.”\r\n\r\n“If Miss Rosa will allow me, then? Let the gentleman come in,” said Mr.\r\nCrisparkle.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman came in; apologised, with a frank but modest grace, for\r\nnot finding Mr. Crisparkle alone; turned to Mr. Crisparkle, and\r\nsmilingly asked the unexpected question: “Who am I?”\r\n\r\n“You are the gentleman I saw smoking under the trees in Staple Inn, a\r\nfew minutes ago.”\r\n\r\n“True. There I saw you. Who else am I?”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle concentrated his attention on a handsome face, much\r\nsunburnt; and the ghost of some departed boy seemed to rise, gradually\r\nand dimly, in the room.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman saw a struggling recollection lighten up the Minor\r\nCanon’s features, and smiling again, said: “What will you have for\r\nbreakfast this morning? You are out of jam.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a moment!” cried Mr. Crisparkle, raising his right hand. “Give me\r\nanother instant! Tartar!”\r\n\r\nThe two shook hands with the greatest heartiness, and then went the\r\nwonderful length—for Englishmen—of laying their hands each on the\r\nother’s shoulders, and looking joyfully each into the other’s face.\r\n\r\n“My old fag!” said Mr. Crisparkle.\r\n\r\n“My old master!” said Mr. Tartar.\r\n\r\n“You saved me from drowning!” said Mr. Crisparkle.\r\n\r\n“After which you took to swimming, you know!” said Mr. Tartar.\r\n\r\n“God bless my soul!” said Mr. Crisparkle.\r\n\r\n“Amen!” said Mr. Tartar.\r\n\r\nAnd then they fell to shaking hands most heartily again.\r\n\r\n“Imagine,” exclaimed Mr. Crisparkle, with glistening eyes: “Miss Rosa\r\nBud and Mr. Grewgious, imagine Mr. Tartar, when he was the smallest of\r\njuniors, diving for me, catching me, a big heavy senior, by the hair of\r\nthe head, and striking out for the shore with me like a water-giant!”\r\n\r\n“Imagine my not letting him sink, as I was his fag!” said Mr. Tartar.\r\n“But the truth being that he was my best protector and friend, and did\r\nme more good than all the masters put together, an irrational impulse\r\nseized me to pick him up, or go down with him.”\r\n\r\n“Hem! Permit me, sir, to have the honour,” said Mr. Grewgious,\r\nadvancing with extended hand, “for an honour I truly esteem it. I am\r\nproud to make your acquaintance. I hope you didn’t take cold. I hope\r\nyou were not inconvenienced by swallowing too much water. How have you\r\nbeen since?”\r\n\r\nIt was by no means apparent that Mr. Grewgious knew what he said,\r\nthough it was very apparent that he meant to say something highly\r\nfriendly and appreciative.\r\n\r\nIf Heaven, Rosa thought, had but sent such courage and skill to her\r\npoor mother’s aid! And he to have been so slight and young then!\r\n\r\n“I don’t wish to be complimented upon it, I thank you; but I think I\r\nhave an idea,” Mr. Grewgious announced, after taking a jog-trot or two\r\nacross the room, so unexpected and unaccountable that they all stared\r\nat him, doubtful whether he was choking or had the cramp—“I _think_ I\r\nhave an idea. I believe I have had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Tartar’s\r\nname as tenant of the top set in the house next the top set in the\r\ncorner?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” returned Mr. Tartar. “You are right so far.”\r\n\r\n“I am right so far,” said Mr. Grewgious. “Tick that off;” which he did,\r\nwith his right thumb on his left. “Might you happen to know the name of\r\nyour neighbour in the top set on the other side of the party-wall?”\r\ncoming very close to Mr. Tartar, to lose nothing of his face, in his\r\nshortness of sight.\r\n\r\n“Landless.”\r\n\r\n“Tick that off,” said Mr. Grewgious, taking another trot, and then\r\ncoming back. “No personal knowledge, I suppose, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Slight, but some.”\r\n\r\n“Tick that off,” said Mr. Grewgious, taking another trot, and again\r\ncoming back. “Nature of knowledge, Mr. Tartar?”\r\n\r\n“I thought he seemed to be a young fellow in a poor way, and I asked\r\nhis leave—only within a day or so—to share my flowers up there with\r\nhim; that is to say, to extend my flower-garden to his windows.”\r\n\r\n“Would you have the kindness to take seats?” said Mr. Grewgious. “I\r\n_have_ an idea!”\r\n\r\nThey complied; Mr. Tartar none the less readily, for being all abroad;\r\nand Mr. Grewgious, seated in the centre, with his hands upon his knees,\r\nthus stated his idea, with his usual manner of having got the statement\r\nby heart.\r\n\r\n“I cannot as yet make up my mind whether it is prudent to hold open\r\ncommunication under present circumstances, and on the part of the fair\r\nmember of the present company, with Mr. Neville or Miss Helena. I have\r\nreason to know that a local friend of ours (on whom I beg to bestow a\r\npassing but a hearty malediction, with the kind permission of my\r\nreverend friend) sneaks to and fro, and dodges up and down. When not\r\ndoing so himself, he may have some informant skulking about, in the\r\nperson of a watchman, porter, or such-like hanger-on of Staple. On the\r\nother hand, Miss Rosa very naturally wishes to see her friend Miss\r\nHelena, and it would seem important that at least Miss Helena (if not\r\nher brother too, through her) should privately know from Miss Rosa’s\r\nlips what has occurred, and what has been threatened. Am I agreed with\r\ngenerally in the views I take?”\r\n\r\n“I entirely coincide with them,” said Mr. Crisparkle, who had been very\r\nattentive.\r\n\r\n“As I have no doubt I should,” added Mr. Tartar, smiling, “if I\r\nunderstood them.”\r\n\r\n“Fair and softly, sir,” said Mr. Grewgious; “we shall fully confide in\r\nyou directly, if you will favour us with your permission. Now, if our\r\nlocal friend should have any informant on the spot, it is tolerably\r\nclear that such informant can only be set to watch the chambers in the\r\noccupation of Mr. Neville. He reporting, to our local friend, who comes\r\nand goes there, our local friend would supply for himself, from his own\r\nprevious knowledge, the identity of the parties. Nobody can be set to\r\nwatch all Staple, or to concern himself with comers and goers to other\r\nsets of chambers: unless, indeed, mine.”\r\n\r\n“I begin to understand to what you tend,” said Mr. Crisparkle, “and\r\nhighly approve of your caution.”\r\n\r\n“I needn’t repeat that I know nothing yet of the why and wherefore,”\r\nsaid Mr. Tartar; “but I also understand to what you tend, so let me say\r\nat once that my chambers are freely at your disposal.”\r\n\r\n“There!” cried Mr. Grewgious, smoothing his head triumphantly, “now we\r\nhave all got the idea. You have it, my dear?”\r\n\r\n“I think I have,” said Rosa, blushing a little as Mr. Tartar looked\r\nquickly towards her.\r\n\r\n“You see, you go over to Staple with Mr. Crisparkle and Mr. Tartar,”\r\nsaid Mr. Grewgious; “I going in and out, and out and in alone, in my\r\nusual way; you go up with those gentlemen to Mr. Tartar’s rooms; you\r\nlook into Mr. Tartar’s flower-garden; you wait for Miss Helena’s\r\nappearance there, or you signify to Miss Helena that you are close by;\r\nand you communicate with her freely, and no spy can be the wiser.”\r\n\r\n“I am very much afraid I shall be—”\r\n\r\n“Be what, my dear?” asked Mr. Grewgious, as she hesitated. “Not\r\nfrightened?”\r\n\r\n“No, not that,” said Rosa, shyly; “in Mr. Tartar’s way. We seem to be\r\nappropriating Mr. Tartar’s residence so very coolly.”\r\n\r\n“I protest to you,” returned that gentleman, “that I shall think the\r\nbetter of it for evermore, if your voice sounds in it only once.”\r\n\r\nRosa, not quite knowing what to say about that, cast down her eyes, and\r\nturning to Mr. Grewgious, dutifully asked if she should put her hat on?\r\nMr. Grewgious being of opinion that she could not do better, she\r\nwithdrew for the purpose. Mr. Crisparkle took the opportunity of giving\r\nMr. Tartar a summary of the distresses of Neville and his sister; the\r\nopportunity was quite long enough, as the hat happened to require a\r\nlittle extra fitting on.\r\n\r\nMr. Tartar gave his arm to Rosa, and Mr. Crisparkle walked, detached,\r\nin front.\r\n\r\n“Poor, poor Eddy!” thought Rosa, as they went along.\r\n\r\nMr. Tartar waved his right hand as he bent his head down over Rosa,\r\ntalking in an animated way.\r\n\r\n“It was not so powerful or so sun-browned when it saved Mr.\r\nCrisparkle,” thought Rosa, glancing at it; “but it must have been very\r\nsteady and determined even then.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tartar told her he had been a sailor, roving everywhere for years\r\nand years.\r\n\r\n“When are you going to sea again?” asked Rosa.\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\nRosa wondered what the girls would say if they could see her crossing\r\nthe wide street on the sailor’s arm. And she fancied that the\r\npassers-by must think her very little and very helpless, contrasted\r\nwith the strong figure that could have caught her up and carried her\r\nout of any danger, miles and miles without resting.\r\n\r\nShe was thinking further, that his far-seeing blue eyes looked as if\r\nthey had been used to watch danger afar off, and to watch it without\r\nflinching, drawing nearer and nearer: when, happening to raise her own\r\neyes, she found that he seemed to be thinking something about _them_.\r\n\r\nThis a little confused Rosebud, and may account for her never\r\nafterwards quite knowing how she ascended (with his help) to his garden\r\nin the air, and seemed to get into a marvellous country that came into\r\nsudden bloom like the country on the summit of the magic bean-stalk.\r\nMay it flourish for ever!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nA GRITTY STATE OF THINGS COMES ON\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Tartar’s chambers were the neatest, the cleanest, and the\r\nbest-ordered chambers ever seen under the sun, moon, and stars. The\r\nfloors were scrubbed to that extent, that you might have supposed the\r\nLondon blacks emancipated for ever, and gone out of the land for good.\r\nEvery inch of brass-work in Mr. Tartar’s possession was polished and\r\nburnished, till it shone like a brazen mirror. No speck, nor spot, nor\r\nspatter soiled the purity of any of Mr. Tartar’s household gods, large,\r\nsmall, or middle-sized. His sitting-room was like the admiral’s cabin,\r\nhis bath-room was like a dairy, his sleeping-chamber, fitted all about\r\nwith lockers and drawers, was like a seedsman’s shop; and his\r\nnicely-balanced cot just stirred in the midst, as if it breathed.\r\nEverything belonging to Mr. Tartar had quarters of its own assigned to\r\nit: his maps and charts had their quarters; his books had theirs; his\r\nbrushes had theirs; his boots had theirs; his clothes had theirs; his\r\ncase-bottles had theirs; his telescopes and other instruments had\r\ntheirs. Everything was readily accessible. Shelf, bracket, locker,\r\nhook, and drawer were equally within reach, and were equally contrived\r\nwith a view to avoiding waste of room, and providing some snug inches\r\nof stowage for something that would have exactly fitted nowhere else.\r\nHis gleaming little service of plate was so arranged upon his sideboard\r\nas that a slack salt-spoon would have instantly betrayed itself; his\r\ntoilet implements were so arranged upon his dressing-table as that a\r\ntoothpick of slovenly deportment could have been reported at a glance.\r\nSo with the curiosities he had brought home from various voyages.\r\nStuffed, dried, repolished, or otherwise preserved, according to their\r\nkind; birds, fishes, reptiles, arms, articles of dress, shells,\r\nseaweeds, grasses, or memorials of coral reef; each was displayed in\r\nits especial place, and each could have been displayed in no better\r\nplace. Paint and varnish seemed to be kept somewhere out of sight, in\r\nconstant readiness to obliterate stray finger-marks wherever any might\r\nbecome perceptible in Mr. Tartar’s chambers. No man-of-war was ever\r\nkept more spick and span from careless touch. On this bright summer\r\nday, a neat awning was rigged over Mr. Tartar’s flower-garden as only a\r\nsailor can rig it, and there was a sea-going air upon the whole effect,\r\nso delightfully complete, that the flower-garden might have appertained\r\nto stern-windows afloat, and the whole concern might have bowled away\r\ngallantly with all on board, if Mr. Tartar had only clapped to his lips\r\nthe speaking-trumpet that was slung in a corner, and given hoarse\r\norders to heave the anchor up, look alive there, men, and get all sail\r\nupon her!\r\n\r\nMr. Tartar doing the honours of this gallant craft was of a piece with\r\nthe rest. When a man rides an amiable hobby that shies at nothing and\r\nkicks nobody, it is only agreeable to find him riding it with a\r\nhumorous sense of the droll side of the creature. When the man is a\r\ncordial and an earnest man by nature, and withal is perfectly fresh and\r\ngenuine, it may be doubted whether he is ever seen to greater advantage\r\nthan at such a time. So Rosa would have naturally thought (even if she\r\nhadn’t been conducted over the ship with all the homage due to the\r\nFirst Lady of the Admiralty, or First Fairy of the Sea), that it was\r\ncharming to see and hear Mr. Tartar half laughing at, and half\r\nrejoicing in, his various contrivances. So Rosa would have naturally\r\nthought, anyhow, that the sunburnt sailor showed to great advantage\r\nwhen, the inspection finished, he delicately withdrew out of his\r\nadmiral’s cabin, beseeching her to consider herself its Queen, and\r\nwaving her free of his flower-garden with the hand that had had Mr.\r\nCrisparkle’s life in it.\r\n\r\n“Helena! Helena Landless! Are you there?”\r\n\r\n“Who speaks to me? Not Rosa?” Then a second handsome face appearing.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my darling!”\r\n\r\n“Why, how did you come here, dearest?”\r\n\r\n“I—I don’t quite know,” said Rosa with a blush; “unless I am dreaming!”\r\n\r\nWhy with a blush? For their two faces were alone with the other\r\nflowers. Are blushes among the fruits of the country of the magic\r\nbean-stalk?\r\n\r\n“_I_ am not dreaming,” said Helena, smiling. “I should take more for\r\ngranted if I were. How do we come together—or so near together—so very\r\nunexpectedly?”\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly indeed, among the dingy gables and chimneypots of P. J.\r\nT.’s connection, and the flowers that had sprung from the salt sea. But\r\nRosa, waking, told in a hurry how they came to be together, and all the\r\nwhy and wherefore of that matter.\r\n\r\n“And Mr. Crisparkle is here,” said Rosa, in rapid conclusion; “and,\r\ncould you believe it? long ago he saved his life!”\r\n\r\n“I could believe any such thing of Mr. Crisparkle,” returned Helena,\r\nwith a mantling face.\r\n\r\n(More blushes in the bean-stalk country!)\r\n\r\n“Yes, but it wasn’t Crisparkle,” said Rosa, quickly putting in the\r\ncorrection.\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand, love.”\r\n\r\n“It was very nice of Mr. Crisparkle to be saved,” said Rosa, “and he\r\ncouldn’t have shown his high opinion of Mr. Tartar more expressively.\r\nBut it was Mr. Tartar who saved him.”\r\n\r\nHelena’s dark eyes looked very earnestly at the bright face among the\r\nleaves, and she asked, in a slower and more thoughtful tone:\r\n\r\n“Is Mr. Tartar with you now, dear?”\r\n\r\n“No; because he has given up his rooms to me—to us, I mean. It is such\r\na beautiful place!”\r\n\r\n“Is it?”\r\n\r\n“It is like the inside of the most exquisite ship that ever sailed. It\r\nis like—it is like—”\r\n\r\n“Like a dream?” suggested Helena.\r\n\r\nRosa answered with a little nod, and smelled the flowers.\r\n\r\nHelena resumed, after a short pause of silence, during which she seemed\r\n(or it was Rosa’s fancy) to compassionate somebody: “My poor Neville is\r\nreading in his own room, the sun being so very bright on this side just\r\nnow. I think he had better not know that you are so near.”\r\n\r\n“O, I think so too!” cried Rosa very readily.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” pursued Helena, doubtfully, “that he must know by-and-by\r\nall you have told me; but I am not sure. Ask Mr. Crisparkle’s advice,\r\nmy darling. Ask him whether I may tell Neville as much or as little of\r\nwhat you have told me as I think best.”\r\n\r\nRosa subsided into her state-cabin, and propounded the question. The\r\nMinor Canon was for the free exercise of Helena’s judgment.\r\n\r\n“I thank him very much,” said Helena, when Rosa emerged again with her\r\nreport. “Ask him whether it would be best to wait until any more\r\nmaligning and pursuing of Neville on the part of this wretch shall\r\ndisclose itself, or to try to anticipate it: I mean, so far as to find\r\nout whether any such goes on darkly about us?”\r\n\r\nThe Minor Canon found this point so difficult to give a confident\r\nopinion on, that, after two or three attempts and failures, he\r\nsuggested a reference to Mr. Grewgious. Helena acquiescing, he betook\r\nhimself (with a most unsuccessful assumption of lounging indifference)\r\nacross the quadrangle to P. J. T.’s, and stated it. Mr. Grewgious held\r\ndecidedly to the general principle, that if you could steal a march\r\nupon a brigand or a wild beast, you had better do it; and he also held\r\ndecidedly to the special case, that John Jasper was a brigand and a\r\nwild beast in combination.\r\n\r\nThus advised, Mr. Crisparkle came back again and reported to Rosa, who\r\nin her turn reported to Helena. She now steadily pursuing her train of\r\nthought at her window, considered thereupon.\r\n\r\n“We may count on Mr. Tartar’s readiness to help us, Rosa?” she\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\nO yes! Rosa shyly thought so. O yes, Rosa shyly believed she could\r\nalmost answer for it. But should she ask Mr. Crisparkle? “I think your\r\nauthority on the point as good as his, my dear,” said Helena, sedately,\r\n“and you needn’t disappear again for that.” Odd of Helena!\r\n\r\n“You see, Neville,” Helena pursued after more reflection, “knows no one\r\nelse here: he has not so much as exchanged a word with any one else\r\nhere. If Mr. Tartar would call to see him openly and often; if he would\r\nspare a minute for the purpose, frequently; if he would even do so,\r\nalmost daily; something might come of it.”\r\n\r\n“Something might come of it, dear?” repeated Rosa, surveying her\r\nfriend’s beauty with a highly perplexed face. “Something might?”\r\n\r\n“If Neville’s movements are really watched, and if the purpose really\r\nis to isolate him from all friends and acquaintance and wear his daily\r\nlife out grain by grain (which would seem to be the threat to you),\r\ndoes it not appear likely,” said Helena, “that his enemy would in some\r\nway communicate with Mr. Tartar to warn him off from Neville? In which\r\ncase, we might not only know the fact, but might know from Mr. Tartar\r\nwhat the terms of the communication were.”\r\n\r\n“I see!” cried Rosa. And immediately darted into her state-cabin again.\r\n\r\nPresently her pretty face reappeared, with a greatly heightened colour,\r\nand she said that she had told Mr. Crisparkle, and that Mr. Crisparkle\r\nhad fetched in Mr. Tartar, and that Mr. Tartar—“who is waiting now, in\r\ncase you want him,” added Rosa, with a half look back, and in not a\r\nlittle confusion between the inside of the state-cabin and out—had\r\ndeclared his readiness to act as she had suggested, and to enter on his\r\ntask that very day.\r\n\r\n“I thank him from my heart,” said Helena. “Pray tell him so.”\r\n\r\nAgain not a little confused between the Flower-garden and the Cabin,\r\nRosa dipped in with her message, and dipped out again with more\r\nassurances from Mr. Tartar, and stood wavering in a divided state\r\nbetween Helena and him, which proved that confusion is not always\r\nnecessarily awkward, but may sometimes present a very pleasant\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n“And now, darling,” said Helena, “we will be mindful of the caution\r\nthat has restricted us to this interview for the present, and will\r\npart. I hear Neville moving too. Are you going back?”\r\n\r\n“To Miss Twinkleton’s?” asked Rosa.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“O, I could never go there any more. I couldn’t indeed, after that\r\ndreadful interview!” said Rosa.\r\n\r\n“Then where _are_ you going, pretty one?”\r\n\r\n“Now I come to think of it, I don’t know,” said Rosa. “I have settled\r\nnothing at all yet, but my guardian will take care of me. Don’t be\r\nuneasy, dear. I shall be sure to be somewhere.”\r\n\r\n(It did seem likely.)\r\n\r\n“And I shall hear of my Rosebud from Mr. Tartar?” inquired Helena.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I suppose so; from—” Rosa looked back again in a flutter, instead\r\nof supplying the name. “But tell me one thing before we part, dearest\r\nHelena. Tell me—that you are sure, sure, sure, I couldn’t help it.”\r\n\r\n“Help it, love?”\r\n\r\n“Help making him malicious and revengeful. I couldn’t hold any terms\r\nwith him, could I?”\r\n\r\n“You know how I love you, darling,” answered Helena, with indignation;\r\n“but I would sooner see you dead at his wicked feet.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a great comfort to me! And you will tell your poor brother so,\r\nwon’t you? And you will give him my remembrance and my sympathy? And\r\nyou will ask him not to hate me?”\r\n\r\nWith a mournful shake of the head, as if that would be quite a\r\nsuperfluous entreaty, Helena lovingly kissed her two hands to her\r\nfriend, and her friend’s two hands were kissed to her; and then she saw\r\na third hand (a brown one) appear among the flowers and leaves, and\r\nhelp her friend out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe refection that Mr. Tartar produced in the Admiral’s Cabin by merely\r\ntouching the spring knob of a locker and the handle of a drawer, was a\r\ndazzling enchanted repast. Wonderful macaroons, glittering liqueurs,\r\nmagically-preserved tropical spices, and jellies of celestial tropical\r\nfruits, displayed themselves profusely at an instant’s notice. But Mr.\r\nTartar could not make time stand still; and time, with his hard-hearted\r\nfleetness, strode on so fast, that Rosa was obliged to come down from\r\nthe bean-stalk country to earth and her guardian’s chambers.\r\n\r\n“And now, my dear,” said Mr. Grewgious, “what is to be done next? To\r\nput the same thought in another form; what is to be done with you?”\r\n\r\nRosa could only look apologetically sensible of being very much in her\r\nown way and in everybody else’s. Some passing idea of living,\r\nfireproof, up a good many stairs in Furnival’s Inn for the rest of her\r\nlife, was the only thing in the nature of a plan that occurred to her.\r\n\r\n“It has come into my thoughts,” said Mr. Grewgious, “that as the\r\nrespected lady, Miss Twinkleton, occasionally repairs to London in the\r\nrecess, with the view of extending her connection, and being available\r\nfor interviews with metropolitan parents, if any—whether, until we have\r\ntime in which to turn ourselves round, we might invite Miss Twinkleton\r\nto come and stay with you for a month?”\r\n\r\n“Stay where, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Whether,” explained Mr. Grewgious, “we might take a furnished lodging\r\nin town for a month, and invite Miss Twinkleton to assume the charge of\r\nyou in it for that period?”\r\n\r\n“And afterwards?” hinted Rosa.\r\n\r\n“And afterwards,” said Mr. Grewgious, “we should be no worse off than\r\nwe are now.”\r\n\r\n“I think that might smooth the way,” assented Rosa.\r\n\r\n“Then let us,” said Mr. Grewgious, rising, “go and look for a furnished\r\nlodging. Nothing could be more acceptable to me than the sweet presence\r\nof last evening, for all the remaining evenings of my existence; but\r\nthese are not fit surroundings for a young lady. Let us set out in\r\nquest of adventures, and look for a furnished lodging. In the meantime,\r\nMr. Crisparkle here, about to return home immediately, will no doubt\r\nkindly see Miss Twinkleton, and invite that lady to co-operate in our\r\nplan.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crisparkle, willingly accepting the commission, took his departure;\r\nMr. Grewgious and his ward set forth on their expedition.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Grewgious’s idea of looking at a furnished lodging was to get on\r\nthe opposite side of the street to a house with a suitable bill in the\r\nwindow, and stare at it; and then work his way tortuously to the back\r\nof the house, and stare at that; and then not go in, but make similar\r\ntrials of another house, with the same result; their progress was but\r\nslow. At length he bethought himself of a widowed cousin, divers times\r\nremoved, of Mr. Bazzard’s, who had once solicited his influence in the\r\nlodger world, and who lived in Southampton Street, Bloomsbury Square.\r\nThis lady’s name, stated in uncompromising capitals of considerable\r\nsize on a brass door-plate, and yet not lucidly as to sex or condition,\r\nwas BILLICKIN.\r\n\r\nPersonal faintness, and an overpowering personal candour, were the\r\ndistinguishing features of Mrs. Billickin’s organisation. She came\r\nlanguishing out of her own exclusive back parlour, with the air of\r\nhaving been expressly brought-to for the purpose, from an accumulation\r\nof several swoons.\r\n\r\n“I hope I see you well, sir,” said Mrs. Billickin, recognising her\r\nvisitor with a bend.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, quite well. And you, ma’am?” returned Mr. Grewgious.\r\n\r\n“I am as well,” said Mrs. Billickin, becoming aspirational with excess\r\nof faintness, “as I hever ham.”\r\n\r\n“My ward and an elderly lady,” said Mr. Grewgious, “wish to find a\r\ngenteel lodging for a month or so. Have you any apartments available,\r\nma’am?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Grewgious,” returned Mrs. Billickin, “I will not deceive you; far\r\nfrom it. I _have_ apartments available.”\r\n\r\nThis with the air of adding: “Convey me to the stake, if you will; but\r\nwhile I live, I will be candid.”\r\n\r\n“And now, what apartments, ma’am?” asked Mr. Grewgious, cosily. To tame\r\na certain severity apparent on the part of Mrs. Billickin.\r\n\r\n“There is this sitting-room—which, call it what you will, it is the\r\nfront parlour, Miss,” said Mrs. Billickin, impressing Rosa into the\r\nconversation: “the back parlour being what I cling to and never part\r\nwith; and there is two bedrooms at the top of the ’ouse with gas laid\r\non. I do not tell you that your bedroom floors is firm, for firm they\r\nare not. The gas-fitter himself allowed, that to make a firm job, he\r\nmust go right under your jistes, and it were not worth the outlay as a\r\nyearly tenant so to do. The piping is carried above your jistes, and it\r\nis best that it should be made known to you.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious and Rosa exchanged looks of some dismay, though they had\r\nnot the least idea what latent horrors this carriage of the piping\r\nmight involve. Mrs. Billickin put her hand to her heart, as having\r\neased it of a load.\r\n\r\n“Well! The roof is all right, no doubt,” said Mr. Grewgious, plucking\r\nup a little.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Grewgious,” returned Mrs. Billickin, “if I was to tell you, sir,\r\nthat to have nothink above you is to have a floor above you, I should\r\nput a deception upon you which I will not do. No, sir. Your slates WILL\r\nrattle loose at that elewation in windy weather, do your utmost, best\r\nor worst! I defy you, sir, be you what you may, to keep your slates\r\ntight, try how you can.” Here Mrs. Billickin, having been warm with Mr.\r\nGrewgious, cooled a little, not to abuse the moral power she held over\r\nhim. “Consequent,” proceeded Mrs. Billickin, more mildly, but still\r\nfirmly in her incorruptible candour: “consequent it would be worse than\r\nof no use for me to trapse and travel up to the top of the ’ouse with\r\nyou, and for you to say, ‘Mrs. Billickin, what stain do I notice in the\r\nceiling, for a stain I do consider it?’ and for me to answer, ‘I do not\r\nunderstand you, sir.’ No, sir, I will not be so underhand. I _do_\r\nunderstand you before you pint it out. It is the wet, sir. It do come\r\nin, and it do not come in. You may lay dry there half your lifetime;\r\nbut the time will come, and it is best that you should know it, when a\r\ndripping sop would be no name for you.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious looked much disgraced by being prefigured in this pickle.\r\n\r\n“Have you any other apartments, ma’am?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Grewgious,” returned Mrs. Billickin, with much solemnity, “I have.\r\nYou ask me have I, and my open and my honest answer air, I have. The\r\nfirst and second floors is wacant, and sweet rooms.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come! There’s nothing against _them_,” said Mr. Grewgious,\r\ncomforting himself.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Grewgious,” replied Mrs. Billickin, “pardon me, there is the\r\nstairs. Unless your mind is prepared for the stairs, it will lead to\r\ninevitable disappointment. You cannot, Miss,” said Mrs. Billickin,\r\naddressing Rosa reproachfully, “place a first floor, and far less a\r\nsecond, on the level footing of a parlour. No, you cannot do it, Miss,\r\nit is beyond your power, and wherefore try?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Billickin put it very feelingly, as if Rosa had shown a headstrong\r\ndetermination to hold the untenable position.\r\n\r\n“Can we see these rooms, ma’am?” inquired her guardian.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Grewgious,” returned Mrs. Billickin, “you can. I will not disguise\r\nit from you, sir; you can.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Billickin then sent into her back parlour for her shawl (it being\r\na state fiction, dating from immemorial antiquity, that she could never\r\ngo anywhere without being wrapped up), and having been enrolled by her\r\nattendant, led the way. She made various genteel pauses on the stairs\r\nfor breath, and clutched at her heart in the drawing-room as if it had\r\nvery nearly got loose, and she had caught it in the act of taking wing.\r\n\r\n“And the second floor?” said Mr. Grewgious, on finding the first\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Grewgious,” replied Mrs. Billickin, turning upon him with\r\nceremony, as if the time had now come when a distinct understanding on\r\na difficult point must be arrived at, and a solemn confidence\r\nestablished, “the second floor is over this.”\r\n\r\n“Can we see that too, ma’am?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” returned Mrs. Billickin, “it is open as the day.”\r\n\r\nThat also proving satisfactory, Mr. Grewgious retired into a window\r\nwith Rosa for a few words of consultation, and then asking for pen and\r\nink, sketched out a line or two of agreement. In the meantime Mrs.\r\nBillickin took a seat, and delivered a kind of Index to, or Abstract\r\nof, the general question.\r\n\r\n“Five-and-forty shillings per week by the month certain at the time of\r\nyear,” said Mrs. Billickin, “is only reasonable to both parties. It is\r\nnot Bond Street nor yet St. James’s Palace; but it is not pretended\r\nthat it is. Neither is it attempted to be denied—for why should\r\nit?—that the Arching leads to a mews. Mewses must exist. Respecting\r\nattendance; two is kep’, at liberal wages. Words _has_ arisen as to\r\ntradesmen, but dirty shoes on fresh hearth-stoning was attributable,\r\nand no wish for a commission on your orders. Coals is either _by_ the\r\nfire, or _per_ the scuttle.” She emphasised the prepositions as marking\r\na subtle but immense difference. “Dogs is not viewed with favour.\r\nBesides litter, they gets stole, and sharing suspicions is apt to creep\r\nin, and unpleasantness takes place.”\r\n\r\nBy this time Mr. Grewgious had his agreement-lines, and his\r\nearnest-money, ready. “I have signed it for the ladies, ma’am,” he\r\nsaid, “and you’ll have the goodness to sign it for yourself, Christian\r\nand Surname, there, if you please.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Grewgious,” said Mrs. Billickin in a new burst of candour, “no,\r\nsir! You must excuse the Christian name.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious stared at her.\r\n\r\n“The door-plate is used as a protection,” said Mrs. Billickin, “and\r\nacts as such, and go from it I will not.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grewgious stared at Rosa.\r\n\r\n“No, Mr. Grewgious, you must excuse me. So long as this ’ouse is known\r\nindefinite as Billickin’s, and so long as it is a doubt with the\r\nriff-raff where Billickin may be hidin’, near the street-door or down\r\nthe airy, and what his weight and size, so long I feel safe. But commit\r\nmyself to a solitary female statement, no, Miss! Nor would you for a\r\nmoment wish,” said Mrs. Billickin, with a strong sense of injury, “to\r\ntake that advantage of your sex, if you were not brought to it by\r\ninconsiderate example.”\r\n\r\nRosa reddening as if she had made some most disgraceful attempt to\r\noverreach the good lady, besought Mr. Grewgious to rest content with\r\nany signature. And accordingly, in a baronial way, the sign-manual\r\nBILLICKIN got appended to the document.\r\n\r\nDetails were then settled for taking possession on the next day but\r\none, when Miss Twinkleton might be reasonably expected; and Rosa went\r\nback to Furnival’s Inn on her guardian’s arm.\r\n\r\nBehold Mr. Tartar walking up and down Furnival’s Inn, checking himself\r\nwhen he saw them coming, and advancing towards them!\r\n\r\n“It occurred to me,” hinted Mr. Tartar, “that we might go up the river,\r\nthe weather being so delicious and the tide serving. I have a boat of\r\nmy own at the Temple Stairs.”\r\n\r\n“I have not been up the river for this many a day,” said Mr. Grewgious,\r\ntempted.\r\n\r\n“I was never up the river,” added Rosa.\r\n\r\nWithin half an hour they were setting this matter right by going up the\r\nriver. The tide was running with them, the afternoon was charming. Mr.\r\nTartar’s boat was perfect. Mr. Tartar and Lobley (Mr. Tartar’s man)\r\npulled a pair of oars. Mr. Tartar had a yacht, it seemed, lying\r\nsomewhere down by Greenhithe; and Mr. Tartar’s man had charge of this\r\nyacht, and was detached upon his present service. He was a\r\njolly-favoured man, with tawny hair and whiskers, and a big red face.\r\nHe was the dead image of the sun in old woodcuts, his hair and whiskers\r\nanswering for rays all around him. Resplendent in the bow of the boat,\r\nhe was a shining sight, with a man-of-war’s man’s shirt on—or off,\r\naccording to opinion—and his arms and breast tattooed all sorts of\r\npatterns. Lobley seemed to take it easily, and so did Mr. Tartar; yet\r\ntheir oars bent as they pulled, and the boat bounded under them. Mr.\r\nTartar talked as if he were doing nothing, to Rosa who was really doing\r\nnothing, and to Mr. Grewgious who was doing this much that he steered\r\nall wrong; but what did that matter, when a turn of Mr. Tartar’s\r\nskilful wrist, or a mere grin of Mr. Lobley’s over the bow, put all to\r\nrights! The tide bore them on in the gayest and most sparkling manner,\r\nuntil they stopped to dine in some ever-lastingly-green garden, needing\r\nno matter-of-fact identification here; and then the tide obligingly\r\nturned—being devoted to that party alone for that day; and as they\r\nfloated idly among some osier-beds, Rosa tried what she could do in the\r\nrowing way, and came off splendidly, being much assisted; and Mr.\r\nGrewgious tried what he could do, and came off on his back, doubled up\r\nwith an oar under his chin, being not assisted at all. Then there was\r\nan interval of rest under boughs (such rest!) what time Mr. Lobley\r\nmopped, and, arranging cushions, stretchers, and the like, danced the\r\ntight-rope the whole length of the boat like a man to whom shoes were a\r\nsuperstition and stockings slavery; and then came the sweet return\r\namong delicious odours of limes in bloom, and musical ripplings; and,\r\nall too soon, the great black city cast its shadow on the waters, and\r\nits dark bridges spanned them as death spans life, and the\r\neverlastingly-green garden seemed to be left for everlasting,\r\nunregainable and far away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Up the river]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Cannot people get through life without gritty stages, I wonder?” Rosa\r\nthought next day, when the town was very gritty again, and everything\r\nhad a strange and an uncomfortable appearance of seeming to wait for\r\nsomething that wouldn’t come. NO. She began to think, that, now the\r\nCloisterham school-days had glided past and gone, the gritty stages\r\nwould begin to set in at intervals and make themselves wearily known!\r\n\r\nYet what did Rosa expect? Did she expect Miss Twinkleton? Miss\r\nTwinkleton duly came. Forth from her back parlour issued the Billickin\r\nto receive Miss Twinkleton, and War was in the Billickin’s eye from\r\nthat fell moment.\r\n\r\nMiss Twinkleton brought a quantity of luggage with her, having all\r\nRosa’s as well as her own. The Billickin took it ill that Miss\r\nTwinkleton’s mind, being sorely disturbed by this luggage, failed to\r\ntake in her personal identity with that clearness of perception which\r\nwas due to its demands. Stateliness mounted her gloomy throne upon the\r\nBillickin’s brow in consequence. And when Miss Twinkleton, in agitation\r\ntaking stock of her trunks and packages, of which she had seventeen,\r\nparticularly counted in the Billickin herself as number eleven, the B.\r\nfound it necessary to repudiate.\r\n\r\n“Things cannot too soon be put upon the footing,” said she, with a\r\ncandour so demonstrative as to be almost obtrusive, “that the person of\r\nthe ’ouse is not a box nor yet a bundle, nor a carpet-bag. No, I am\r\n’ily obleeged to you, Miss Twinkleton, nor yet a beggar.”\r\n\r\nThis last disclaimer had reference to Miss Twinkleton’s distractedly\r\npressing two-and-sixpence on her, instead of the cabman.\r\n\r\nThus cast off, Miss Twinkleton wildly inquired, “which gentleman” was\r\nto be paid? There being two gentlemen in that position (Miss Twinkleton\r\nhaving arrived with two cabs), each gentleman on being paid held forth\r\nhis two-and-sixpence on the flat of his open hand, and, with a\r\nspeechless stare and a dropped jaw, displayed his wrong to heaven and\r\nearth. Terrified by this alarming spectacle, Miss Twinkleton placed\r\nanother shilling in each hand; at the same time appealing to the law in\r\nflurried accents, and recounting her luggage this time with the two\r\ngentlemen in, who caused the total to come out complicated. Meanwhile\r\nthe two gentlemen, each looking very hard at the last shilling\r\ngrumblingly, as if it might become eighteen-pence if he kept his eyes\r\non it, descended the doorsteps, ascended their carriages, and drove\r\naway, leaving Miss Twinkleton on a bonnet-box in tears.\r\n\r\nThe Billickin beheld this manifestation of weakness without sympathy,\r\nand gave directions for “a young man to be got in” to wrestle with the\r\nluggage. When that gladiator had disappeared from the arena, peace\r\nensued, and the new lodgers dined.\r\n\r\nBut the Billickin had somehow come to the knowledge that Miss\r\nTwinkleton kept a school. The leap from that knowledge to the inference\r\nthat Miss Twinkleton set herself to teach _her_ something, was easy.\r\n“But you don’t do it,” soliloquised the Billickin; “I am not your\r\npupil, whatever she,” meaning Rosa, “may be, poor thing!”\r\n\r\nMiss Twinkleton, on the other hand, having changed her dress and\r\nrecovered her spirits, was animated by a bland desire to improve the\r\noccasion in all ways, and to be as serene a model as possible. In a\r\nhappy compromise between her two states of existence, she had already\r\nbecome, with her workbasket before her, the equably vivacious companion\r\nwith a slight judicious flavouring of information, when the Billickin\r\nannounced herself.\r\n\r\n“I will not hide from you, ladies,” said the B., enveloped in the shawl\r\nof state, “for it is not my character to hide neither my motives nor my\r\nactions, that I take the liberty to look in upon you to express a ’ope\r\nthat your dinner was to your liking. Though not Professed but Plain,\r\nstill her wages should be a sufficient object to her to stimilate to\r\nsoar above mere roast and biled.”\r\n\r\n“We dined very well indeed,” said Rosa, “thank you.”\r\n\r\n“Accustomed,” said Miss Twinkleton with a gracious air, which to the\r\njealous ears of the Billickin seemed to add “my good woman”—“accustomed\r\nto a liberal and nutritious, yet plain and salutary diet, we have found\r\nno reason to bemoan our absence from the ancient city, and the\r\nmethodical household, in which the quiet routine of our lot has been\r\nhitherto cast.”\r\n\r\n“I did think it well to mention to my cook,” observed the Billickin\r\nwith a gush of candour, “which I ’ope you will agree with, Miss\r\nTwinkleton, was a right precaution, that the young lady being used to\r\nwhat we should consider here but poor diet, had better be brought\r\nforward by degrees. For, a rush from scanty feeding to generous\r\nfeeding, and from what you may call messing to what you may call\r\nmethod, do require a power of constitution which is not often found in\r\nyouth, particular when undermined by boarding-school!”\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Billickin now openly pitted herself against\r\nMiss Twinkleton, as one whom she had fully ascertained to be her\r\nnatural enemy.\r\n\r\n“Your remarks,” returned Miss Twinkleton, from a remote moral eminence,\r\n“are well meant, I have no doubt; but you will permit me to observe\r\nthat they develop a mistaken view of the subject, which can only be\r\nimputed to your extreme want of accurate information.”\r\n\r\n“My informiation,” retorted the Billickin, throwing in an extra\r\nsyllable for the sake of emphasis at once polite and powerful—“my\r\ninformiation, Miss Twinkleton, were my own experience, which I believe\r\nis usually considered to be good guidance. But whether so or not, I was\r\nput in youth to a very genteel boarding-school, the mistress being no\r\nless a lady than yourself, of about your own age or it may be some\r\nyears younger, and a poorness of blood flowed from the table which has\r\nrun through my life.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely,” said Miss Twinkleton, still from her distant eminence;\r\n“and very much to be deplored.—Rosa, my dear, how are you getting on\r\nwith your work?”\r\n\r\n“Miss Twinkleton,” resumed the Billickin, in a courtly manner, “before\r\nretiring on the ’int, as a lady should, I wish to ask of yourself, as a\r\nlady, whether I am to consider that my words is doubted?”\r\n\r\n“I am not aware on what ground you cherish such a supposition,” began\r\nMiss Twinkleton, when the Billickin neatly stopped her.\r\n\r\n“Do not, if you please, put suppositions betwixt my lips where none\r\nsuch have been imparted by myself. Your flow of words is great, Miss\r\nTwinkleton, and no doubt is expected from you by your pupils, and no\r\ndoubt is considered worth the money. _No_ doubt, I am sure. But not\r\npaying for flows of words, and not asking to be favoured with them\r\nhere, I wish to repeat my question.”\r\n\r\n“If you refer to the poverty of your circulation,” began Miss\r\nTwinkleton, when again the Billickin neatly stopped her.\r\n\r\n“I have used no such expressions.”\r\n\r\n“If you refer, then, to the poorness of your blood—”\r\n\r\n“Brought upon me,” stipulated the Billickin, expressly, “at a\r\nboarding-school—”\r\n\r\n“Then,” resumed Miss Twinkleton, “all I can say is, that I am bound to\r\nbelieve, on your asseveration, that it is very poor indeed. I cannot\r\nforbear adding, that if that unfortunate circumstance influences your\r\nconversation, it is much to be lamented, and it is eminently desirable\r\nthat your blood were richer.—Rosa, my dear, how are you getting on with\r\nyour work?”\r\n\r\n“Hem! Before retiring, Miss,” proclaimed the Billickin to Rosa, loftily\r\ncancelling Miss Twinkleton, “I should wish it to be understood between\r\nyourself and me that my transactions in future is with you alone. I\r\nknow no elderly lady here, Miss, none older than yourself.”\r\n\r\n“A highly desirable arrangement, Rosa my dear,” observed Miss\r\nTwinkleton.\r\n\r\n“It is not, Miss,” said the Billickin, with a sarcastic smile, “that I\r\npossess the Mill I have heard of, in which old single ladies could be\r\nground up young (what a gift it would be to some of us), but that I\r\nlimit myself to you totally.”\r\n\r\n“When I have any desire to communicate a request to the person of the\r\nhouse, Rosa my dear,” observed Miss Twinkleton with majestic\r\ncheerfulness, “I will make it known to you, and you will kindly\r\nundertake, I am sure, that it is conveyed to the proper quarter.”\r\n\r\n“Good-evening, Miss,” said the Billickin, at once affectionately and\r\ndistantly. “Being alone in my eyes, I wish you good-evening with best\r\nwishes, and do not find myself drove, I am truly ’appy to say, into\r\nexpressing my contempt for an indiwidual, unfortunately for yourself,\r\nbelonging to you.”\r\n\r\nThe Billickin gracefully withdrew with this parting speech, and from\r\nthat time Rosa occupied the restless position of shuttlecock between\r\nthese two battledores. Nothing could be done without a smart match\r\nbeing played out. Thus, on the daily-arising question of dinner, Miss\r\nTwinkleton would say, the three being present together:\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, my love, you will consult with the person of the house,\r\nwhether she can procure us a lamb’s fry; or, failing that, a roast\r\nfowl.”\r\n\r\nOn which the Billickin would retort (Rosa not having spoken a word),\r\n“If you was better accustomed to butcher’s meat, Miss, you would not\r\nentertain the idea of a lamb’s fry. Firstly, because lambs has long\r\nbeen sheep, and secondly, because there is such things as killing-days,\r\nand there is not. As to roast fowls, Miss, why you must be quite\r\nsurfeited with roast fowls, letting alone your buying, when you market\r\nfor yourself, the agedest of poultry with the scaliest of legs, quite\r\nas if you was accustomed to picking ’em out for cheapness. Try a little\r\ninwention, Miss. Use yourself to ’ousekeeping a bit. Come now, think of\r\nsomethink else.”\r\n\r\nTo this encouragement, offered with the indulgent toleration of a wise\r\nand liberal expert, Miss Twinkleton would rejoin, reddening:\r\n\r\n“Or, my dear, you might propose to the person of the house a duck.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Miss!” the Billickin would exclaim (still no word being spoken\r\nby Rosa), “you do surprise me when you speak of ducks! Not to mention\r\nthat they’re getting out of season and very dear, it really strikes to\r\nmy heart to see you have a duck; for the breast, which is the only\r\ndelicate cuts in a duck, always goes in a direction which I cannot\r\nimagine where, and your own plate comes down so miserably\r\nskin-and-bony! Try again, Miss. Think more of yourself, and less of\r\nothers. A dish of sweetbreads now, or a bit of mutton. Something at\r\nwhich you can get your equal chance.”\r\n\r\nOccasionally the game would wax very brisk indeed, and would be kept up\r\nwith a smartness rendering such an encounter as this quite tame. But\r\nthe Billickin almost invariably made by far the higher score; and would\r\ncome in with side hits of the most unexpected and extraordinary\r\ndescription, when she seemed without a chance.\r\n\r\nAll this did not improve the gritty state of things in London, or the\r\nair that London had acquired in Rosa’s eyes of waiting for something\r\nthat never came. Tired of working, and conversing with Miss Twinkleton,\r\nshe suggested working and reading: to which Miss Twinkleton readily\r\nassented, as an admirable reader, of tried powers. But Rosa soon made\r\nthe discovery that Miss Twinkleton didn’t read fairly. She cut the\r\nlove-scenes, interpolated passages in praise of female celibacy, and\r\nwas guilty of other glaring pious frauds. As an instance in point, take\r\nthe glowing passage: “Ever dearest and best adored,—said Edward,\r\nclasping the dear head to his breast, and drawing the silken hair\r\nthrough his caressing fingers, from which he suffered it to fall like\r\ngolden rain,—ever dearest and best adored, let us fly from the\r\nunsympathetic world and the sterile coldness of the stony-hearted, to\r\nthe rich warm Paradise of Trust and Love.” Miss Twinkleton’s fraudulent\r\nversion tamely ran thus: “Ever engaged to me with the consent of our\r\nparents on both sides, and the approbation of the silver-haired rector\r\nof the district,—said Edward, respectfully raising to his lips the\r\ntaper fingers so skilful in embroidery, tambour, crochet, and other\r\ntruly feminine arts,—let me call on thy papa ere to-morrow’s dawn has\r\nsunk into the west, and propose a suburban establishment, lowly it may\r\nbe, but within our means, where he will be always welcome as an evening\r\nguest, and where every arrangement shall invest economy, and constant\r\ninterchange of scholastic acquirements with the attributes of the\r\nministering angel to domestic bliss.”\r\n\r\nAs the days crept on and nothing happened, the neighbours began to say\r\nthat the pretty girl at Billickin’s, who looked so wistfully and so\r\nmuch out of the gritty windows of the drawing-room, seemed to be losing\r\nher spirits. The pretty girl might have lost them but for the accident\r\nof lighting on some books of voyages and sea-adventure. As a\r\ncompensation against their romance, Miss Twinkleton, reading aloud,\r\nmade the most of all the latitudes and longitudes, bearings, winds,\r\ncurrents, offsets, and other statistics (which she felt to be none the\r\nless improving because they expressed nothing whatever to her); while\r\nRosa, listening intently, made the most of what was nearest to her\r\nheart. So they both did better than before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nTHE DAWN AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Crisparkle and John Jasper met daily under the Cathedral\r\nroof, nothing at any time passed between them having reference to Edwin\r\nDrood, after the time, more than half a year gone by, when Jasper\r\nmutely showed the Minor Canon the conclusion and the resolution entered\r\nin his Diary. It is not likely that they ever met, though so often,\r\nwithout the thoughts of each reverting to the subject. It is not likely\r\nthat they ever met, though so often, without a sensation on the part of\r\neach that the other was a perplexing secret to him. Jasper as the\r\ndenouncer and pursuer of Neville Landless, and Mr. Crisparkle as his\r\nconsistent advocate and protector, must at least have stood\r\nsufficiently in opposition to have speculated with keen interest on the\r\nsteadiness and next direction of the other’s designs. But neither ever\r\nbroached the theme.\r\n\r\nFalse pretence not being in the Minor Canon’s nature, he doubtless\r\ndisplayed openly that he would at any time have revived the subject,\r\nand even desired to discuss it. The determined reticence of Jasper,\r\nhowever, was not to be so approached. Impassive, moody, solitary,\r\nresolute, so concentrated on one idea, and on its attendant fixed\r\npurpose, that he would share it with no fellow-creature, he lived apart\r\nfrom human life. Constantly exercising an Art which brought him into\r\nmechanical harmony with others, and which could not have been pursued\r\nunless he and they had been in the nicest mechanical relations and\r\nunison, it is curious to consider that the spirit of the man was in\r\nmoral accordance or interchange with nothing around him. This indeed he\r\nhad confided to his lost nephew, before the occasion for his present\r\ninflexibility arose.\r\n\r\nThat he must know of Rosa’s abrupt departure, and that he must divine\r\nits cause, was not to be doubted. Did he suppose that he had terrified\r\nher into silence? or did he suppose that she had imparted to any one—to\r\nMr. Crisparkle himself, for instance—the particulars of his last\r\ninterview with her? Mr. Crisparkle could not determine this in his\r\nmind. He could not but admit, however, as a just man, that it was not,\r\nof itself, a crime to fall in love with Rosa, any more than it was a\r\ncrime to offer to set love above revenge.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful suspicion of Jasper, which Rosa was so shocked to have\r\nreceived into her imagination, appeared to have no harbour in Mr.\r\nCrisparkle’s. If it ever haunted Helena’s thoughts or Neville’s,\r\nneither gave it one spoken word of utterance. Mr. Grewgious took no\r\npains to conceal his implacable dislike of Jasper, yet he never\r\nreferred it, however distantly, to such a source. But he was a reticent\r\nas well as an eccentric man; and he made no mention of a certain\r\nevening when he warmed his hands at the gatehouse fire, and looked\r\nsteadily down upon a certain heap of torn and miry clothes upon the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nDrowsy Cloisterham, whenever it awoke to a passing reconsideration of a\r\nstory above six months old and dismissed by the bench of magistrates,\r\nwas pretty equally divided in opinion whether John Jasper’s beloved\r\nnephew had been killed by his treacherously passionate rival, or in an\r\nopen struggle; or had, for his own purposes, spirited himself away. It\r\nthen lifted up its head, to notice that the bereaved Jasper was still\r\never devoted to discovery and revenge; and then dozed off again. This\r\nwas the condition of matters, all round, at the period to which the\r\npresent history has now attained.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral doors have closed for the night; and the Choir-master, on\r\na short leave of absence for two or three services, sets his face\r\ntowards London. He travels thither by the means by which Rosa\r\ntravelled, and arrives, as Rosa arrived, on a hot, dusty evening.\r\n\r\nHis travelling baggage is easily carried in his hand, and he repairs\r\nwith it on foot, to a hybrid hotel in a little square behind Aldersgate\r\nStreet, near the General Post Office. It is hotel, boarding-house, or\r\nlodging-house, at its visitor’s option. It announces itself, in the new\r\nRailway Advertisers, as a novel enterprise, timidly beginning to spring\r\nup. It bashfully, almost apologetically, gives the traveller to\r\nunderstand that it does not expect him, on the good old constitutional\r\nhotel plan, to order a pint of sweet blacking for his drinking, and\r\nthrow it away; but insinuates that he may have his boots blacked\r\ninstead of his stomach, and maybe also have bed, breakfast, attendance,\r\nand a porter up all night, for a certain fixed charge. From these and\r\nsimilar premises, many true Britons in the lowest spirits deduce that\r\nthe times are levelling times, except in the article of high roads, of\r\nwhich there will shortly be not one in England.\r\n\r\nHe eats without appetite, and soon goes forth again. Eastward and still\r\neastward through the stale streets he takes his way, until he reaches\r\nhis destination: a miserable court, specially miserable among many\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nHe ascends a broken staircase, opens a door, looks into a dark stifling\r\nroom, and says: “Are you alone here?”\r\n\r\n“Alone, deary; worse luck for me, and better for you,” replies a\r\ncroaking voice. “Come in, come in, whoever you be: I can’t see you till\r\nI light a match, yet I seem to know the sound of your speaking. I’m\r\nacquainted with you, ain’t I?”\r\n\r\n“Light your match, and try.”\r\n\r\n“So I will, deary, so I will; but my hand that shakes, as I can’t lay\r\nit on a match all in a moment. And I cough so, that, put my matches\r\nwhere I may, I never find ’em there. They jump and start, as I cough\r\nand cough, like live things. Are you off a voyage, deary?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Not seafaring?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s land customers, and there’s water customers. I’m a\r\nmother to both. Different from Jack Chinaman t’other side the court. He\r\nain’t a father to neither. It ain’t in him. And he ain’t got the true\r\nsecret of mixing, though he charges as much as me that has, and more if\r\nhe can get it. Here’s a match, and now where’s the candle? If my cough\r\ntakes me, I shall cough out twenty matches afore I gets a light.”\r\n\r\nBut she finds the candle, and lights it, before the cough comes on. It\r\nseizes her in the moment of success, and she sits down rocking herself\r\nto and fro, and gasping at intervals: “O, my lungs is awful bad! my\r\nlungs is wore away to cabbage-nets!” until the fit is over. During its\r\ncontinuance she has had no power of sight, or any other power not\r\nabsorbed in the struggle; but as it leaves her, she begins to strain\r\nher eyes, and as soon as she is able to articulate, she cries, staring:\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s you!”\r\n\r\n“Are you so surprised to see me?”\r\n\r\n“I thought I never should have seen you again, deary. I thought you was\r\ndead, and gone to Heaven.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t suppose you could have kept away, alive, so long, from the\r\npoor old soul with the real receipt for mixing it. And you are in\r\nmourning too! Why didn’t you come and have a pipe or two of comfort?\r\nDid they leave you money, perhaps, and so you didn’t want comfort?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Who was they as died, deary?”\r\n\r\n“A relative.”\r\n\r\n“Died of what, lovey?”\r\n\r\n“Probably, Death.”\r\n\r\n“We are short to-night!” cries the woman, with a propitiatory laugh.\r\n“Short and snappish we are! But we’re out of sorts for want of a smoke.\r\nWe’ve got the all-overs, haven’t us, deary? But this is the place to\r\ncure ’em in; this is the place where the all-overs is smoked off.”\r\n\r\n“You may make ready, then,” replies the visitor, “as soon as you like.”\r\n\r\nHe divests himself of his shoes, loosens his cravat, and lies across\r\nthe foot of the squalid bed, with his head resting on his left hand.\r\n\r\n“Now you begin to look like yourself,” says the woman approvingly. “Now\r\nI begin to know my old customer indeed! Been trying to mix for yourself\r\nthis long time, poppet?”\r\n\r\n“I have been taking it now and then in my own way.”\r\n\r\n“Never take it your own way. It ain’t good for trade, and it ain’t good\r\nfor you. Where’s my ink-bottle, and where’s my thimble, and where’s my\r\nlittle spoon? He’s going to take it in a artful form now, my deary\r\ndear!”\r\n\r\nEntering on her process, and beginning to bubble and blow at the faint\r\nspark enclosed in the hollow of her hands, she speaks from time to\r\ntime, in a tone of snuffling satisfaction, without leaving off. When he\r\nspeaks, he does so without looking at her, and as if his thoughts were\r\nalready roaming away by anticipation.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a pretty many smokes ready for you, first and last, haven’t\r\nI, chuckey?”\r\n\r\n“A good many.”\r\n\r\n“When you first come, you was quite new to it; warn’t ye?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I was easily disposed of, then.”\r\n\r\n“But you got on in the world, and was able by-and-by to take your pipe\r\nwith the best of ’em, warn’t ye?”\r\n\r\n“Ah; and the worst.”\r\n\r\n“It’s just ready for you. What a sweet singer you was when you first\r\ncome! Used to drop your head, and sing yourself off like a bird! It’s\r\nready for you now, deary.”\r\n\r\nHe takes it from her with great care, and puts the mouthpiece to his\r\nlips. She seats herself beside him, ready to refill the pipe.\r\n\r\nAfter inhaling a few whiffs in silence, he doubtingly accosts her with:\r\n\r\n“Is it as potent as it used to be?”\r\n\r\n“What do you speak of, deary?”\r\n\r\n“What should I speak of, but what I have in my mouth?”\r\n\r\n“It’s just the same. Always the identical same.”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t taste so. And it’s slower.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve got more used to it, you see.”\r\n\r\n“That may be the cause, certainly. Look here.” He stops, becomes\r\ndreamy, and seems to forget that he has invited her attention. She\r\nbends over him, and speaks in his ear.\r\n\r\n“I’m attending to you. Says you just now, Look here. Says I now, I’m\r\nattending to ye. We was talking just before of your being used to it.”\r\n\r\n“I know all that. I was only thinking. Look here. Suppose you had\r\nsomething in your mind; something you were going to do.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, deary; something I was going to do?”\r\n\r\n“But had not quite determined to do.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, deary.”\r\n\r\n“Might or might not do, you understand.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.” With the point of a needle she stirs the contents of the bowl.\r\n\r\n“Should you do it in your fancy, when you were lying here doing this?”\r\n\r\nShe nods her head. “Over and over again.”\r\n\r\n“Just like me! I did it over and over again. I have done it hundreds of\r\nthousands of times in this room.”\r\n\r\n“It’s to be hoped it was pleasant to do, deary.”\r\n\r\n“It _was_ pleasant to do!”\r\n\r\nHe says this with a savage air, and a spring or start at her. Quite\r\nunmoved she retouches and replenishes the contents of the bowl with her\r\nlittle spatula. Seeing her intent upon the occupation, he sinks into\r\nhis former attitude.\r\n\r\n“It was a journey, a difficult and dangerous journey. That was the\r\nsubject in my mind. A hazardous and perilous journey, over abysses\r\nwhere a slip would be destruction. Look down, look down! You see what\r\nlies at the bottom there?”\r\n\r\nHe has darted forward to say it, and to point at the ground, as though\r\nat some imaginary object far beneath. The woman looks at him, as his\r\nspasmodic face approaches close to hers, and not at his pointing. She\r\nseems to know what the influence of her perfect quietude would be; if\r\nso, she has not miscalculated it, for he subsides again.\r\n\r\n“Well; I have told you I did it here hundreds of thousands of times.\r\nWhat do I say? I did it millions and billions of times. I did it so\r\noften, and through such vast expanses of time, that when it was really\r\ndone, it seemed not worth the doing, it was done so soon.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the journey you have been away upon,” she quietly remarks.\r\n\r\nHe glares at her as he smokes; and then, his eyes becoming filmy,\r\nanswers: “That’s the journey.”\r\n\r\nSilence ensues. His eyes are sometimes closed and sometimes open. The\r\nwoman sits beside him, very attentive to the pipe, which is all the\r\nwhile at his lips.\r\n\r\n“I’ll warrant,” she observes, when he has been looking fixedly at her\r\nfor some consecutive moments, with a singular appearance in his eyes of\r\nseeming to see her a long way off, instead of so near him: “I’ll\r\nwarrant you made the journey in a many ways, when you made it so\r\noften?”\r\n\r\n“No, always in one way.”\r\n\r\n“Always in the same way?”\r\n\r\n“Ay.”\r\n\r\n“In the way in which it was really made at last?”\r\n\r\n“Ay.”\r\n\r\n“And always took the same pleasure in harping on it?”\r\n\r\n“Ay.”\r\n\r\nFor the time he appears unequal to any other reply than this lazy\r\nmonosyllabic assent. Probably to assure herself that it is not the\r\nassent of a mere automaton, she reverses the form of her next sentence.\r\n\r\n“Did you never get tired of it, deary, and try to call up something\r\nelse for a change?”\r\n\r\nHe struggles into a sitting posture, and retorts upon her: “What do you\r\nmean? What did I want? What did I come for?”\r\n\r\nShe gently lays him back again, and before returning him the instrument\r\nhe has dropped, revives the fire in it with her own breath; then says\r\nto him, coaxingly:\r\n\r\n“Sure, sure, sure! Yes, yes, yes! Now I go along with you. You was too\r\nquick for me. I see now. You come o’ purpose to take the journey. Why,\r\nI might have known it, through its standing by you so.”\r\n\r\nHe answers first with a laugh, and then with a passionate setting of\r\nhis teeth: “Yes, I came on purpose. When I could not bear my life, I\r\ncame to get the relief, and I got it. It WAS one! It WAS one!” This\r\nrepetition with extraordinary vehemence, and the snarl of a wolf.\r\n\r\nShe observes him very cautiously, as though mentally feeling her way to\r\nher next remark. It is: “There was a fellow-traveller, deary.”\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha, ha!” He breaks into a ringing laugh, or rather yell.\r\n\r\n“To think,” he cries, “how often fellow-traveller, and yet not know it!\r\nTo think how many times he went the journey, and never saw the road!”\r\n\r\nThe woman kneels upon the floor, with her arms crossed on the coverlet\r\nof the bed, close by him, and her chin upon them. In this crouching\r\nattitude she watches him. The pipe is falling from his mouth. She puts\r\nit back, and laying her hand upon his chest, moves him slightly from\r\nside to side. Upon that he speaks, as if she had spoken.\r\n\r\n“Yes! I always made the journey first, before the changes of colours\r\nand the great landscapes and glittering processions began. They\r\ncouldn’t begin till it was off my mind. I had no room till then for\r\nanything else.”\r\n\r\nOnce more he lapses into silence. Once more she lays her hand upon his\r\nchest, and moves him slightly to and fro, as a cat might stimulate a\r\nhalf-slain mouse. Once more he speaks, as if she had spoken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sleeping it off]\r\n\r\n\r\n“What? I told you so. When it comes to be real at last, it is so short\r\nthat it seems unreal for the first time. Hark!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, deary. I’m listening.”\r\n\r\n“Time and place are both at hand.”\r\n\r\nHe is on his feet, speaking in a whisper, and as if in the dark.\r\n\r\n“Time, place, and fellow-traveller,” she suggests, adopting his tone,\r\nand holding him softly by the arm.\r\n\r\n“How could the time be at hand unless the fellow-traveller was? Hush!\r\nThe journey’s made. It’s over.”\r\n\r\n“So soon?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I said to you. So soon. Wait a little. This is a vision. I\r\nshall sleep it off. It has been too short and easy. I must have a\r\nbetter vision than this; this is the poorest of all. No struggle, no\r\nconsciousness of peril, no entreaty—and yet I never saw _that_ before.”\r\nWith a start.\r\n\r\n“Saw what, deary?”\r\n\r\n“Look at it! Look what a poor, mean, miserable thing it is! _That_ must\r\nbe real. It’s over.”\r\n\r\nHe has accompanied this incoherence with some wild unmeaning gestures;\r\nbut they trail off into the progressive inaction of stupor, and he lies\r\na log upon the bed.\r\n\r\nThe woman, however, is still inquisitive. With a repetition of her\r\ncat-like action she slightly stirs his body again, and listens; stirs\r\nagain, and listens; whispers to it, and listens. Finding it past all\r\nrousing for the time, she slowly gets upon her feet, with an air of\r\ndisappointment, and flicks the face with the back of her hand in\r\nturning from it.\r\n\r\nBut she goes no further away from it than the chair upon the hearth.\r\nShe sits in it, with an elbow on one of its arms, and her chin upon her\r\nhand, intent upon him. “I heard ye say once,” she croaks under her\r\nbreath, “I heard ye say once, when I was lying where you’re lying, and\r\nyou were making your speculations upon me, ‘Unintelligible!’ I heard\r\nyou say so, of two more than me. But don’t ye be too sure always; don’t\r\nbe ye too sure, beauty!”\r\n\r\nUnwinking, cat-like, and intent, she presently adds: “Not so potent as\r\nit once was? Ah! Perhaps not at first. You may be more right there.\r\nPractice makes perfect. I may have learned the secret how to make ye\r\ntalk, deary.”\r\n\r\nHe talks no more, whether or no. Twitching in an ugly way from time to\r\ntime, both as to his face and limbs, he lies heavy and silent. The\r\nwretched candle burns down; the woman takes its expiring end between\r\nher fingers, lights another at it, crams the guttering frying morsel\r\ndeep into the candlestick, and rams it home with the new candle, as if\r\nshe were loading some ill-savoured and unseemly weapon of witchcraft;\r\nthe new candle in its turn burns down; and still he lies insensible. At\r\nlength what remains of the last candle is blown out, and daylight looks\r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\nIt has not looked very long, when he sits up, chilled and shaking,\r\nslowly recovers consciousness of where he is, and makes himself ready\r\nto depart. The woman receives what he pays her with a grateful, “Bless\r\nye, bless ye, deary!” and seems, tired out, to begin making herself\r\nready for sleep as he leaves the room.\r\n\r\nBut seeming may be false or true. It is false in this case; for, the\r\nmoment the stairs have ceased to creak under his tread, she glides\r\nafter him, muttering emphatically: “I’ll not miss ye twice!”\r\n\r\nThere is no egress from the court but by its entrance. With a weird\r\npeep from the doorway, she watches for his looking back. He does not\r\nlook back before disappearing, with a wavering step. She follows him,\r\npeeps from the court, sees him still faltering on without looking back,\r\nand holds him in view.\r\n\r\nHe repairs to the back of Aldersgate Street, where a door immediately\r\nopens to his knocking. She crouches in another doorway, watching that\r\none, and easily comprehending that he puts up temporarily at that\r\nhouse. Her patience is unexhausted by hours. For sustenance she can,\r\nand does, buy bread within a hundred yards, and milk as it is carried\r\npast her.\r\n\r\nHe comes forth again at noon, having changed his dress, but carrying\r\nnothing in his hand, and having nothing carried for him. He is not\r\ngoing back into the country, therefore, just yet. She follows him a\r\nlittle way, hesitates, instantaneously turns confidently, and goes\r\nstraight into the house he has quitted.\r\n\r\n“Is the gentleman from Cloisterham indoors?\r\n\r\n“Just gone out.”\r\n\r\n“Unlucky. When does the gentleman return to Cloisterham?”\r\n\r\n“At six this evening.”\r\n\r\n“Bless ye and thank ye. May the Lord prosper a business where a civil\r\nquestion, even from a poor soul, is so civilly answered!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll not miss ye twice!” repeats the poor soul in the street, and not\r\nso civilly. “I lost ye last, where that omnibus you got into nigh your\r\njourney’s end plied betwixt the station and the place. I wasn’t so much\r\nas certain that you even went right on to the place. Now I know ye did.\r\nMy gentleman from Cloisterham, I’ll be there before ye, and bide your\r\ncoming. I’ve swore my oath that I’ll not miss ye twice!”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, that same evening the poor soul stands in Cloisterham High\r\nStreet, looking at the many quaint gables of the Nuns’ House, and\r\ngetting through the time as she best can until nine o’clock; at which\r\nhour she has reason to suppose that the arriving omnibus passengers may\r\nhave some interest for her. The friendly darkness, at that hour,\r\nrenders it easy for her to ascertain whether this be so or not; and it\r\nis so, for the passenger not to be missed twice arrives among the rest.\r\n\r\n“Now let me see what becomes of you. Go on!”\r\n\r\nAn observation addressed to the air, and yet it might be addressed to\r\nthe passenger, so compliantly does he go on along the High Street until\r\nhe comes to an arched gateway, at which he unexpectedly vanishes. The\r\npoor soul quickens her pace; is swift, and close upon him entering\r\nunder the gateway; but only sees a postern staircase on one side of it,\r\nand on the other side an ancient vaulted room, in which a large-headed,\r\ngray-haired gentleman is writing, under the odd circumstances of\r\nsitting open to the thoroughfare and eyeing all who pass, as if he were\r\ntoll-taker of the gateway: though the way is free.\r\n\r\n“Halloa!” he cries in a low voice, seeing her brought to a stand-still:\r\n“who are you looking for?”\r\n\r\n“There was a gentleman passed in here this minute, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Of course there was. What do you want with him?”\r\n\r\n“Where do he live, deary?”\r\n\r\n“Live? Up that staircase.”\r\n\r\n“Bless ye! Whisper. What’s his name, deary?”\r\n\r\n“Surname Jasper, Christian name John. Mr. John Jasper.”\r\n\r\n“Has he a calling, good gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“Calling? Yes. Sings in the choir.”\r\n\r\n“In the spire?”\r\n\r\n“Choir.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\nMr. Datchery rises from his papers, and comes to his doorstep. “Do you\r\nknow what a cathedral is?” he asks, jocosely.\r\n\r\nThe woman nods.\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\nShe looks puzzled, casting about in her mind to find a definition, when\r\nit occurs to her that it is easier to point out the substantial object\r\nitself, massive against the dark-blue sky and the early stars.\r\n\r\n“That’s the answer. Go in there at seven to-morrow morning, and you may\r\nsee Mr. John Jasper, and hear him too.”\r\n\r\n“Thank ye! Thank ye!”\r\n\r\nThe burst of triumph in which she thanks him does not escape the notice\r\nof the single buffer of an easy temper living idly on his means. He\r\nglances at her; clasps his hands behind him, as the wont of such\r\nbuffers is; and lounges along the echoing Precincts at her side.\r\n\r\n“Or,” he suggests, with a backward hitch of his head, “you can go up at\r\nonce to Mr. Jasper’s rooms there.”\r\n\r\nThe woman eyes him with a cunning smile, and shakes her head.\r\n\r\n“O! you don’t want to speak to him?”\r\n\r\nShe repeats her dumb reply, and forms with her lips a soundless “No.”\r\n\r\n“You can admire him at a distance three times a day, whenever you like.\r\nIt’s a long way to come for that, though.”\r\n\r\nThe woman looks up quickly. If Mr. Datchery thinks she is to be so\r\ninduced to declare where she comes from, he is of a much easier temper\r\nthan she is. But she acquits him of such an artful thought, as he\r\nlounges along, like the chartered bore of the city, with his uncovered\r\ngray hair blowing about, and his purposeless hands rattling the loose\r\nmoney in the pockets of his trousers.\r\n\r\nThe chink of the money has an attraction for her greedy ears. “Wouldn’t\r\nyou help me to pay for my traveller’s lodging, dear gentleman, and to\r\npay my way along? I am a poor soul, I am indeed, and troubled with a\r\ngrievous cough.”\r\n\r\n“You know the travellers’ lodging, I perceive, and are making directly\r\nfor it,” is Mr. Datchery’s bland comment, still rattling his loose\r\nmoney. “Been here often, my good woman?”\r\n\r\n“Once in all my life.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay?”\r\n\r\nThey have arrived at the entrance to the Monks’ Vineyard. An\r\nappropriate remembrance, presenting an exemplary model for imitation,\r\nis revived in the woman’s mind by the sight of the place. She stops at\r\nthe gate, and says energetically:\r\n\r\n“By this token, though you mayn’t believe it, That a young gentleman\r\ngave me three-and-sixpence as I was coughing my breath away on this\r\nvery grass. I asked him for three-and-sixpence, and he gave it me.”\r\n\r\n“Wasn’t it a little cool to name your sum?” hints Mr. Datchery, still\r\nrattling. “Isn’t it customary to leave the amount open? Mightn’t it\r\nhave had the appearance, to the young gentleman—only the\r\nappearance—that he was rather dictated to?”\r\n\r\n“Look’ee here, deary,” she replies, in a confidential and persuasive\r\ntone, “I wanted the money to lay it out on a medicine as does me good,\r\nand as I deal in. I told the young gentleman so, and he gave it me, and\r\nI laid it out honest to the last brass farden. I want to lay out the\r\nsame sum in the same way now; and if you’ll give it me, I’ll lay it out\r\nhonest to the last brass farden again, upon my soul!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the medicine?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be honest with you beforehand, as well as after. It’s opium.”\r\n\r\nMr. Datchery, with a sudden change of countenance, gives her a sudden\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n“It’s opium, deary. Neither more nor less. And it’s like a human\r\ncreetur so far, that you always hear what can be said against it, but\r\nseldom what can be said in its praise.”\r\n\r\nMr. Datchery begins very slowly to count out the sum demanded of him.\r\nGreedily watching his hands, she continues to hold forth on the great\r\nexample set him.\r\n\r\n“It was last Christmas Eve, just arter dark, the once that I was here\r\nafore, when the young gentleman gave me the three-and-six.” Mr.\r\nDatchery stops in his counting, finds he has counted wrong, shakes his\r\nmoney together, and begins again.\r\n\r\n“And the young gentleman’s name,” she adds, “was Edwin.”\r\n\r\nMr. Datchery drops some money, stoops to pick it up, and reddens with\r\nthe exertion as he asks:\r\n\r\n“How do you know the young gentleman’s name?”\r\n\r\n“I asked him for it, and he told it me. I only asked him the two\r\nquestions, what was his Chris’en name, and whether he’d a sweetheart?\r\nAnd he answered, Edwin, and he hadn’t.”\r\n\r\nMr. Datchery pauses with the selected coins in his hand, rather as if\r\nhe were falling into a brown study of their value, and couldn’t bear to\r\npart with them. The woman looks at him distrustfully, and with her\r\nanger brewing for the event of his thinking better of the gift; but he\r\nbestows it on her as if he were abstracting his mind from the\r\nsacrifice, and with many servile thanks she goes her way.\r\n\r\nJohn Jasper’s lamp is kindled, and his lighthouse is shining when Mr.\r\nDatchery returns alone towards it. As mariners on a dangerous voyage,\r\napproaching an iron-bound coast, may look along the beams of the\r\nwarning light to the haven lying beyond it that may never be reached,\r\nso Mr. Datchery’s wistful gaze is directed to this beacon, and beyond.\r\n\r\nHis object in now revisiting his lodging is merely to put on the hat\r\nwhich seems so superfluous an article in his wardrobe. It is half-past\r\nten by the Cathedral clock when he walks out into the Precincts again;\r\nhe lingers and looks about him, as though, the enchanted hour when Mr.\r\nDurdles may be stoned home having struck, he had some expectation of\r\nseeing the Imp who is appointed to the mission of stoning him.\r\n\r\nIn effect, that Power of Evil is abroad. Having nothing living to stone\r\nat the moment, he is discovered by Mr. Datchery in the unholy office of\r\nstoning the dead, through the railings of the churchyard. The Imp finds\r\nthis a relishing and piquing pursuit; firstly, because their\r\nresting-place is announced to be sacred; and secondly, because the tall\r\nheadstones are sufficiently like themselves, on their beat in the dark,\r\nto justify the delicious fancy that they are hurt when hit.\r\n\r\nMr. Datchery hails with him: “Halloa, Winks!”\r\n\r\nHe acknowledges the hail with: “Halloa, Dick!” Their acquaintance\r\nseemingly having been established on a familiar footing.\r\n\r\n“But, I say,” he remonstrates, “don’t yer go a-making my name public. I\r\nnever means to plead to no name, mind yer. When they says to me in the\r\nLock-up, a-going to put me down in the book, ‘What’s your name?’ I says\r\nto them, ‘Find out.’ Likewise when they says, ‘What’s your religion?’ I\r\nsays, ‘Find out.’”\r\n\r\nWhich, it may be observed in passing, it would be immensely difficult\r\nfor the State, however statistical, to do.\r\n\r\n“Asides which,” adds the boy, “there ain’t no family of Winkses.”\r\n\r\n“I think there must be.”\r\n\r\n“Yer lie, there ain’t. The travellers give me the name on account of my\r\ngetting no settled sleep and being knocked up all night; whereby I gets\r\none eye roused open afore I’ve shut the other. That’s what Winks means.\r\nDeputy’s the nighest name to indict me by: but yer wouldn’t catch me\r\npleading to that, neither.”\r\n\r\n“Deputy be it always, then. We two are good friends; eh, Deputy?”\r\n\r\n“Jolly good.”\r\n\r\n“I forgave you the debt you owed me when we first became acquainted,\r\nand many of my sixpences have come your way since; eh, Deputy?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! And what’s more, yer ain’t no friend o’ Jarsper’s. What did he go\r\na-histing me off my legs for?”\r\n\r\n“What indeed! But never mind him now. A shilling of mine is going your\r\nway to-night, Deputy. You have just taken in a lodger I have been\r\nspeaking to; an infirm woman with a cough.”\r\n\r\n“Puffer,” assents Deputy, with a shrewd leer of recognition, and\r\nsmoking an imaginary pipe, with his head very much on one side and his\r\neyes very much out of their places: “Hopeum Puffer.”\r\n\r\n“What is her name?”\r\n\r\n“’Er Royal Highness the Princess Puffer.”\r\n\r\n“She has some other name than that; where does she live?”\r\n\r\n“Up in London. Among the Jacks.”\r\n\r\n“The sailors?”\r\n\r\n“I said so; Jacks; and Chayner men: and hother Knifers.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to know, through you, exactly where she lives.”\r\n\r\n“All right. Give us ’old.”\r\n\r\nA shilling passes; and, in that spirit of confidence which should\r\npervade all business transactions between principals of honour, this\r\npiece of business is considered done.\r\n\r\n“But here’s a lark!” cries Deputy. “Where did yer think ’Er Royal\r\nHighness is a-goin’ to to-morrow morning? Blest if she ain’t a-goin’ to\r\nthe KIN-FREE-DER-EL!” He greatly prolongs the word in his ecstasy, and\r\nsmites his leg, and doubles himself up in a fit of shrill laughter.\r\n\r\n“How do you know that, Deputy?”\r\n\r\n“Cos she told me so just now. She said she must be hup and hout o’\r\npurpose. She ses, ‘Deputy, I must ’ave a early wash, and make myself as\r\nswell as I can, for I’m a-goin’ to take a turn at the\r\nKIN-FREE-DER-EL!’” He separates the syllables with his former zest,\r\nand, not finding his sense of the ludicrous sufficiently relieved by\r\nstamping about on the pavement, breaks into a slow and stately dance,\r\nperhaps supposed to be performed by the Dean.\r\n\r\nMr. Datchery receives the communication with a well-satisfied though\r\npondering face, and breaks up the conference. Returning to his quaint\r\nlodging, and sitting long over the supper of bread-and-cheese and salad\r\nand ale which Mrs. Tope has left prepared for him, he still sits when\r\nhis supper is finished. At length he rises, throws open the door of a\r\ncorner cupboard, and refers to a few uncouth chalked strokes on its\r\ninner side.\r\n\r\n“I like,” says Mr. Datchery, “the old tavern way of keeping scores.\r\nIllegible except to the scorer. The scorer not committed, the scored\r\ndebited with what is against him. Hum; ha! A very small score this; a\r\nvery poor score!”\r\n\r\nHe sighs over the contemplation of its poverty, takes a bit of chalk\r\nfrom one of the cupboard shelves, and pauses with it in his hand,\r\nuncertain what addition to make to the account.\r\n\r\n“I think a moderate stroke,” he concludes, “is all I am justified in\r\nscoring up;” so, suits the action to the word, closes the cupboard, and\r\ngoes to bed.\r\n\r\nA brilliant morning shines on the old city. Its antiquities and ruins\r\nare surpassingly beautiful, with a lusty ivy gleaming in the sun, and\r\nthe rich trees waving in the balmy air. Changes of glorious light from\r\nmoving boughs, songs of birds, scents from gardens, woods, and\r\nfields—or, rather, from the one great garden of the whole cultivated\r\nisland in its yielding time—penetrate into the Cathedral, subdue its\r\nearthy odour, and preach the Resurrection and the Life. The cold stone\r\ntombs of centuries ago grow warm; and flecks of brightness dart into\r\nthe sternest marble corners of the building, fluttering there like\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nComes Mr. Tope with his large keys, and yawningly unlocks and sets\r\nopen. Come Mrs. Tope and attendant sweeping sprites. Come, in due time,\r\norganist and bellows-boy, peeping down from the red curtains in the\r\nloft, fearlessly flapping dust from books up at that remote elevation,\r\nand whisking it from stops and pedals. Come sundry rooks, from various\r\nquarters of the sky, back to the great tower; who may be presumed to\r\nenjoy vibration, and to know that bell and organ are going to give it\r\nthem. Come a very small and straggling congregation indeed: chiefly\r\nfrom Minor Canon Corner and the Precincts. Come Mr. Crisparkle, fresh\r\nand bright; and his ministering brethren, not quite so fresh and\r\nbright. Come the Choir in a hurry (always in a hurry, and struggling\r\ninto their nightgowns at the last moment, like children shirking bed),\r\nand comes John Jasper leading their line. Last of all comes Mr.\r\nDatchery into a stall, one of a choice empty collection very much at\r\nhis service, and glancing about him for Her Royal Highness the Princess\r\nPuffer.\r\n\r\nThe service is pretty well advanced before Mr. Datchery can discern Her\r\nRoyal Highness. But by that time he has made her out, in the shade. She\r\nis behind a pillar, carefully withdrawn from the Choir-master’s view,\r\nbut regards him with the closest attention. All unconscious of her\r\npresence, he chants and sings. She grins when he is most musically\r\nfervid, and—yes, Mr. Datchery sees her do it!—shakes her fist at him\r\nbehind the pillar’s friendly shelter.\r\n\r\nMr. Datchery looks again, to convince himself. Yes, again! As ugly and\r\nwithered as one of the fantastic carvings on the under brackets of the\r\nstall seats, as malignant as the Evil One, as hard as the big brass\r\neagle holding the sacred books upon his wings (and, according to the\r\nsculptor’s representation of his ferocious attributes, not at all\r\nconverted by them), she hugs herself in her lean arms, and then shakes\r\nboth fists at the leader of the Choir.\r\n\r\nAnd at that moment, outside the grated door of the Choir, having eluded\r\nthe vigilance of Mr. Tope by shifty resources in which he is an adept,\r\nDeputy peeps, sharp-eyed, through the bars, and stares astounded from\r\nthe threatener to the threatened.\r\n\r\nThe service comes to an end, and the servitors disperse to breakfast.\r\nMr. Datchery accosts his last new acquaintance outside, when the Choir\r\n(as much in a hurry to get their bedgowns off, as they were but now to\r\nget them on) have scuffled away.\r\n\r\n“Well, mistress. Good morning. You have seen him?”\r\n\r\n“_I’ve_ seen him, deary; _I’ve_ seen him!”\r\n\r\n“And you know him?”\r\n\r\n“Know him! Better far than all the Reverend Parsons put together know\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Tope’s care has spread a very neat, clean breakfast ready for her\r\nlodger. Before sitting down to it, he opens his corner-cupboard door;\r\ntakes his bit of chalk from its shelf; adds one thick line to the\r\nscore, extending from the top of the cupboard door to the bottom; and\r\nthen falls to with an appetite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX: FRAGMENT OF ‘THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD’\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Forster was just finishing his biography of Dickens, he found\r\namong the leaves of one of the novelist’s other manuscripts certain\r\nloose slips in his writing, ‘on paper only half the size of that used\r\nfor the tale, so cramped, interlined, and blotted as to be nearly\r\nillegible.’ These proved, upon examination, to contain a suggested\r\nchapter for _Edwin Drood_, in which Sapsea, the auctioneer, appears as\r\nthe principal figure, surrounded by a group of characters new to the\r\nstory. That chapter, being among the last things Dickens wrote, seems\r\nto contain so much of interest that it may be well to reprint it\r\nhere.—ED.\r\n\r\nHOW MR. SAPSEA CEASED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE EIGHT CLUB\r\nTOLD BY HIMSELF\r\n\r\nWishing to take the air, I proceeded by a circuitous route to the Club,\r\nit being our weekly night of meeting. I found that we mustered our full\r\nstrength. We were enrolled under the denomination of the Eight Club. We\r\nwere eight in number; we met at eight o’clock during eight months of\r\nthe year; we played eight games of four-handed cribbage, at eightpence\r\nthe game; our frugal supper was composed of eight rolls, eight mutton\r\nchops, eight pork sausages, eight baked potatoes, eight marrow-bones,\r\nwith eight toasts, and eight bottles of ale. There may, or may not, be\r\na certain harmony of colour in the ruling idea of this (to adopt a\r\nphrase of our lively neighbours) reunion. It was a little idea of mine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Facsimile of a page of the manuscript of “The Mystery of\r\nEdwin Drood”]\r\n\r\n\r\nA somewhat popular member of the Eight Club, was a member by the name\r\nof Kimber. By profession, a dancing-master. A commonplace, hopeful sort\r\nof man, wholly destitute of dignity or knowledge of the world.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the Club-room, Kimber was making the remark: ‘And he still\r\nhalf-believes him to be very high in the Church.’\r\n\r\nIn the act of hanging up my hat on the eighth peg by the door, I caught\r\nKimber’s visual ray. He lowered it, and passed a remark on the next\r\nchange of the moon. I did not take particular notice of this at the\r\nmoment, because the world was often pleased to be a little shy of\r\necclesiastical topics in my presence. For I felt that I was picked out\r\n(though perhaps only through a coincidence) to a certain extent to\r\nrepresent what I call our glorious constitution in Church and State.\r\nThe phrase may be objected to by cautious minds; but I own to it as\r\nmine. I threw it off in argument some little time back. I said: ‘OUR\r\nGLORIOUS CONSTITUTION in CHURCH and STATE.’\r\n\r\nAnother member of the Eight Club was Peartree; also member of the Royal\r\nCollege of Surgeons. Mr. Peartree is not accountable to me for his\r\nopinions, and I say no more of them here than that he attends the poor\r\ngratis whenever they want him, and is not the parish doctor. Mr.\r\nPeartree may justify it to the grasp of _his_ mind thus to do his\r\nrepublican utmost to bring an appointed officer into contempt. Suffice\r\nit that Mr. Peartree can never justify it to the grasp of _mine_.\r\n\r\nBetween Peartree and Kimber there was a sickly sort of feeble-minded\r\nalliance. It came under my particular notice when I sold off Kimber by\r\nauction. (Goods taken in execution.) He was a widower in a white\r\nunder-waistcoat, and slight shoes with bows, and had two daughters not\r\nill-looking. Indeed the reverse. Both daughters taught dancing in\r\nscholastic establishments for Young Ladies—had done so at Mrs.\r\nSapsea’s; nay, Twinkleton’s—and both, in giving lessons, presented the\r\nunwomanly spectacle of having little fiddles tucked under their chins.\r\nIn spite of which, the younger one might, if I am correctly informed—I\r\nwill raise the veil so far as to say I KNOW she might—have soared for\r\nlife from this degrading taint, but for having the class of mind\r\nallotted to what I call the common herd, and being so incredibly devoid\r\nof veneration as to become painfully ludicrous.\r\n\r\nWhen I sold off Kimber without reserve, Peartree (as poor as he can\r\nhold together) had several prime household lots knocked down to him. I\r\nam not to be blinded; and of course it was as plain to me what he was\r\ngoing to do with them, as it was that he was a brown hulking sort of\r\nrevolutionary subject who had been in India with the soldiers, and\r\nought (for the sake of society) to have his neck broke. I saw the lots\r\nshortly afterwards in Kimber’s lodgings—through the window—and I easily\r\nmade out that there had been a sneaking pretence of lending them till\r\nbetter times. A man with a smaller knowledge of the world than myself\r\nmight have been led to suspect that Kimber had held back money from his\r\ncreditors, and fraudulently bought the goods. But, besides that I knew\r\nfor certain he had no money, I knew that this would involve a species\r\nof forethought not to be made compatible with the frivolity of a\r\ncaperer, inoculating other people with capering, for his bread.\r\n\r\nAs it was the first time I had seen either of those two since the sale,\r\nI kept myself in what I call Abeyance. When selling him up, I had\r\ndelivered a few remarks—shall I say a little homily?—concerning Kimber,\r\nwhich the world did regard as more than usually worth notice. I had\r\ncome up into my pulpit, it was said, uncommonly like—and a murmur of\r\nrecognition had repeated his (I will not name whose) title, before I\r\nspoke. I had then gone on to say that all present would find, in the\r\nfirst page of the catalogue that was lying before them, in the last\r\nparagraph before the first lot, the following words: ‘Sold in pursuance\r\nof a writ of execution issued by a creditor.’ I had then proceeded to\r\nremind my friends, that however frivolous, not to say contemptible, the\r\nbusiness by which a man got his goods together, still his goods were as\r\ndear to him, and as cheap to society (if sold without reserve), as\r\nthough his pursuits had been of a character that would bear serious\r\ncontemplation. I had then divided my text (if I may be allowed so to\r\ncall it) into three heads: firstly, Sold; secondly, In pursuance of a\r\nwrit of execution; thirdly, Issued by a creditor; with a few moral\r\nreflections on each, and winding up with, ‘Now to the first lot’ in a\r\nmanner that was complimented when I afterwards mingled with my hearers.\r\n\r\nSo, not being certain on what terms I and Kimber stood, I was grave, I\r\nwas chilling. Kimber, however, moving to me, I moved to Kimber. (I was\r\nthe creditor who had issued the writ. Not that it matters.)\r\n\r\n‘I was alluding, Mr. Sapsea,’ said Kimber, ‘to a stranger who entered\r\ninto conversation with me in the street as I came to the Club. He had\r\nbeen speaking to you just before, it seemed, by the churchyard; and\r\nthough you had told him who you were, I could hardly persuade him that\r\nyou were not high in the Church.’\r\n\r\n‘Idiot?’ said Peartree.\r\n\r\n‘Ass!’ said Kimber.\r\n\r\n‘Idiot and Ass!’ said the other five members.\r\n\r\n‘Idiot and Ass, gentlemen,’ I remonstrated, looking around me, ‘are\r\nstrong expressions to apply to a young man of good appearance and\r\naddress.’ My generosity was roused; I own it.\r\n\r\n‘You’ll admit that he must be a Fool,’ said Peartree.\r\n\r\n‘You can’t deny that he must be a Blockhead,’ said Kimber.\r\n\r\nTheir tone of disgust amounted to being offensive. Why should the young\r\nman be so calumniated? What had he done? He had only made an innocent\r\nand natural mistake. I controlled my generous indignation, and said so.\r\n\r\n‘Natural?’ repeated Kimber. ‘_He’s_ a Natural!’\r\n\r\nThe remaining six members of the Eight Club laughed unanimously. It\r\nstung me. It was a scornful laugh. My anger was roused in behalf of an\r\nabsent, friendless stranger. I rose (for I had been sitting down).\r\n\r\n‘Gentlemen,’ I said with dignity, ‘I will not remain one of this Club\r\nallowing opprobrium to be cast on an unoffending person in his absence.\r\nI will not so violate what I call the sacred rites of hospitality.\r\nGentlemen, until you know how to behave yourselves better, I leave you.\r\nGentlemen, until then I withdraw, from this place of meeting, whatever\r\npersonal qualifications I may have brought into it. Gentlemen, until\r\nthen you cease to be the Eight Club, and must make the best you can of\r\nbecoming the Seven.’\r\n\r\nI put on my hat and retired. As I went down stairs I distinctly heard\r\nthem give a suppressed cheer. Such is the power of demeanour and\r\nknowledge of mankind. I had forced it out of them.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhom should I meet in the street, within a few yards of the door of the\r\ninn where the Club was held, but the self-same young man whose cause I\r\nhad felt it my duty so warmly—and I will add so disinterestedly—to take\r\nup.\r\n\r\n‘Is it Mr. Sapsea,’ he said doubtfully, ‘or is it—’\r\n\r\n‘It is Mr. Sapsea,’ I replied.\r\n\r\n‘Pardon me, Mr. Sapsea; you appear warm, sir.’\r\n\r\n‘I have been warm,’ I said, ‘and on your account.’ Having stated the\r\ncircumstances at some length (my generosity almost overpowered him), I\r\nasked him his name.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Sapsea,’ he answered, looking down, ‘your penetration is so acute,\r\nyour glance into the souls of your fellow men is so penetrating, that\r\nif I was hardly enough to deny that my name is Poker, what would it\r\navail me?’\r\n\r\nI don’t know that I had quite exactly made out to a fraction that his\r\nname _was_ Poker, but I daresay I had been pretty near doing it.\r\n\r\n‘Well, well,’ said I, trying to put him at his ease by nodding my head\r\nin a soothing way. ‘Your name is Poker, and there is no harm in being\r\nnamed Poker.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, Mr. Sapsea!’ cried the young man, in a very well-behaved manner.\r\n‘Bless you for those words!’ He then, as if ashamed of having given way\r\nto his feelings, looked down again.\r\n\r\n‘Come Poker,’ said I, ‘let me hear more about you. Tell me. Where are\r\nyou going to, Poker? and where do you come from?’\r\n\r\n‘Ah Mr. Sapsea!’ exclaimed the young man. ‘Disguise from you is\r\nimpossible. You know already that I come from somewhere, and am going\r\nsomewhere else. If I was to deny it, what would it avail me?’\r\n\r\n‘Then don’t deny it,’ was my remark.\r\n\r\n‘Or,’ pursued Poker, in a kind of despondent rapture, ‘or if I was to\r\ndeny that I came to this town to see and hear you, sir, what would it\r\navail me? Or if I was to deny—’",
