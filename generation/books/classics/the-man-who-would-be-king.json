S. I.  Indeed, his\r\nfriends told him that he deserved more.  For three years he had\r\nendured heat and cold, disappointment, discomfort, danger, and\r\ndisease, with responsibility almost to top-heavy for one pair of\r\nshoulders; and day by day, through that time, the great Kashi\r\nBridge over the Ganges had grown under his charge. Now, in less\r\nthan three months, if all went well, his Excellency the Viceroy\r\nwould open the bridge in state, an archbishop would bless it,\r\nand the first trainload of soldiers would come over it, and\r\nthere would be speeches.\r\n\r\nFindlayson, C. E., sat in his trolley on a construction line that\r\nran along one of the main revetments - the huge stone-faced\r\nbanks that flared away north and south for three miles on either\r\nside of the river and permitted himself to think of the end.\r\nWith its approaches, his work was one mile and three-quarters in\r\nlength; a lattice~girder bridge, trussed with the Findlayson\r\ntruss standing on seven-and-twenty brick piers. Each one of those\r\npiers was twenty-four feet in diameter, capped with red Agra\r\nstone and sunk eighty feet below the shifting sand of the Ganges'\r\nbed.  Above them was a railway-line fifteen feet broad; above\r\nthat, again, a cart-road of eighteen feet, flanked with\r\nfootpaths.  At either end rose towers, of red brick, loopholed\r\nfor musketry and pierced for big guns, and the ramp of the road\r\nwas being pushed forward to their haunches. The raw earth-ends\r\nwere crawling and alive with hundreds upon hundreds of tiny asses\r\nclimbing out of the yawning borrow-pit below with sackfuls of\r\nstuff; and the hot afternoon air was filled with the noise of\r\nhooves, the rattle of the drivers' sticks, and the swish and\r\nroll-down of the dirt.  The river was very low, and on the\r\ndazzling white sand between the three centre piers stood squat\r\ncribs of railway~sleepers, filled within and daubed without with\r\nmud, to support the last of the girders as those were riveted up.\r\nIn the little deep water left by the drought, an overhead crane\r\ntravelled to and fro along its spile-pier, jerking sections of\r\niron into place, snorting and backing and grunting as an elephant\r\ngrunts in the timberyard.  Riveters by the hundred swarmed about\r\nthe lattice side-work and the iron roof of the railway line hung\r\nfrom invisible staging under the bellies of the girders,\r\nclustered round the throats of the piers, and rode on the\r\noverhang\r\nof the footpath-stanchions; their fire-pots and the spurts of\r\nflame that answered each hammer-stroke showing no more than pale\r\nyellow in the sun's glare.  East and west and north and south the\r\nconstruction-trains rattled and shrieked up and down the\r\nembankments, the piled trucks of brown and white stone banging\r\nbehind them till the side-boards were unpinned, and with a roar\r\nand a grumble a few thousand tons' more material were flung out\r\nto hold the river in place. Findlayson, C. E., turned on his\r\ntrolley and looked over the face of the country that he had\r\nchanged for seven miles around.  Looked back on the humming\r\nvillage of five thousand work-men; up stream and down, along the\r\nvista of spurs and sand; across the river to the far piers,\r\nlessening in the haze; overhead to the guard-towers -and only he\r\nknew how strong those were - and with a sigh of contentment saw\r\nthat his work was good.  There stood his bridge before him in\r\nthe sunlight, lacking only a few weeks' work on the girders of\r\nthe three middle piers - his bridge, raw and ugly as original\r\nsin, but pukka - permanent - to endure when all memory of the\r\nbuilder, yea, even of the splendid Findlayson truss, has\r\nperished.  Practically, the thing was done.\r\n\r\nHitchcock, his assistant, cantered along the line on a little\r\nswitch-tailed Kabuli pony who through long practice could have\r\ntrotted securely over trestle,and nodded to his chief.\r\n\r\n\"All but,\" said he, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"I've been thinking about it,\" the senior answered. \"'Not half a\r\nbad job for two men, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"One - and a half.  'Gad, what a Cooper's Hill cub I was when I\r\ncame on the works!\" Hitchcock felt very old in the crowded\r\nexperiences of the past three years, that had taught him power\r\nand responsibility.\r\n\r\n\"You were rather a colt,\" said Findlayson. \"I wonder how you'll\r\nlike going back to office-work when this job's over.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall hate it!\" said the young man, and as he went on his eye\r\nfollowed Findlayson's, and he muttered, \"Isn't it damned good?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we'll go up the service together,\" Findlayson said to\r\nhimself.  \"You're too good a youngster to waste on another man.\r\nCub thou wast; assistant thou art.  Personal assistant, and at\r\nSimla, thou shalt be, if any credit comes to me out of the\r\nbusiness!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the burden of the work had fallen altogether on\r\nFindlayson and his assistant, the young man whom he had chosen\r\nbecause of his rawness to break to his own needs.  There were\r\nlabour contractors by the half-hundred - fitters and riveters,\r\nEuropean, borrowed from the railway workshops, with, perhaps,\r\ntwenty white and half-caste subordinates to direct, under\r\ndirection, the bevies of workmen - but none knew better than\r\nthese two, who trusted each other, how the underlings were not\r\nto be trusted.  They had been tried many times in sudden crises\r\n- by slipping of booms, by breaking of tackle, failure of cranes,\r\nand the wrath of the river - but no stress had brought to light\r\nany man among men whom Findlayson and Hitchcock would have\r\nhonoured by working as remorselessly as they worked them-selves.\r\nFindlayson thought it over from the beginning: the months of\r\noffice-work destroyed at a blow when the Government of India, at\r\nthe last moment, added two feet to the width of the bridge, under\r\nthe impression that bridges were cut out of paper, and so brought\r\nto ruin at least half an acre of calculations- and Hitchcock, new\r\nto disappointment, buried his head in his arms and wept; the\r\nheart-breaking delays over the filling of the contracts in\r\nEngland; the futile correspondences hinting at great wealth of\r\ncommissions if one, only one, rather doubtful consignment were\r\npassed; the war that followed the refusal; the careful, polite\r\nobstruction at the other end that followed the war, till young\r\nHitchcock, putting one month's leave to another month, and\r\nborrowing ten days from Findlayson, spent his poor little savings\r\nof a year in a wild dash to London, and there, as his own tongue\r\nasserted and the later consignments proved, put the fear of God\r\ninto a man so great that he feared only Parliament and said so\r\ntill Hitchcock wrought with him across his own dinner table, and\r\n- he feared the Kashi Bridge and all who spoke in its name.  Then\r\nthere was the cholera that came in the night to the village by\r\nthe bridge works; and after the cholera smote the small-pox.  The\r\nfever they had always with them.  Hitchcock had been appointed a\r\nmagistrate of the third class with whipping powers, for the\r\nbetter government of the community, and Findlayson watched him\r\nwield his powers temperately, learning what to overlook and what\r\nto look after.  It was a long, long reverie, and it covered\r\nstorm, sudden freshets, death in every manner and shape, violent\r\nand awful rage against red tape half frenzying a mind that knows\r\nit should be busy on other things; drought, sanitation, finance;\r\nbirth, wedding, burial, and riot in the village of twenty warring\r\ncastes; argument, expostulation, persuasion, and the blank\r\ndespair that a man goes to bed upon, thankful that his rifle is\r\nall in pieces in the gun-case. Behind everything rose the black\r\nframe of the Kashi Bridge - plate by plate, girder by girder,\r\nspan by span - and each pier of it recalled Hitchcock, the\r\nall-round man, who had stood by his chief without failing from\r\nthe very first to this last.\r\n\r\nSo the bridge was two men's work - unless one counted Peroo, as\r\nPeroo certainly counted himself. He was a Lascar, a Kharva from\r\nBulsar, familiar with every port between Rockhampton and London,\r\nwho had risen to the rank of serang on the British India boats,\r\nbut wearying of routine musters and clean clothes, had thrown up\r\nthe service and gone inland, where men of his calibre were sure\r\nof employment.  For his knowledge of tackle and the handling of\r\nheavy weights, Peroo was worth almost any price he might have\r\nchosen to put upon his services; but custom decreed the wage of\r\nthe overhead-men, and Peroo was not within many silver pieces of\r\nhis proper value. Neither running water nor extreme heights made\r\nhim afraid; and, as an ex-serang, he knew how to hold authority.\r\nNo piece of iron was so big or so badly placed that Peroo could\r\nnot devise a tackle to lift it - a loose-ended, sagging\r\narrangement, rigged with a scandalous amount of talking, but\r\nperfectly equal to the work in hand. It was Peroo who had saved\r\nthe girder of Number Seven pier from destruction when the new\r\nwire-rope jammed in the eye of the crane, and the huge plate\r\ntilted in its slings, threatening to slide out sideways.  Then\r\nthe native workmen lost their heads with great shoutings, and\r\nHitchcock's right arm was broken by a falling T-plate, and he\r\nbuttoned it up in his coat and swooned, and came to and directed\r\nfor four hours till Peroo, from the top of the crane, reported\r\n\"All's well,\" and the plate swung home. There was no one like\r\nPeroo, serang, to lash, and guy, and hold, to control the\r\ndonkey-engines, to hoist a fallen locomotive craftily out of the\r\nborrow-pit into which it had tumbled; to strip, and dive, if need\r\nbe, to see how the concrete blocks round the piers stood the\r\nscouring of Mother Gunga, or to adventure upstream on a monsoon\r\nnight and report on the state of the embankment-facings.  He\r\nwould interrupt the field-councils of Findlayson and Hitchcock\r\nwithout fear, till his wonderful English, or his still more\r\nwonderful lingua franca, half Portuguese and half Malay, ran out\r\nand he was forced to take string and show the knots that he would\r\nrecommend.  He controlled his own gang of tackle men -\r\nmysterious relatives from Kutch Mandvi gathered month by month\r\nand tried to the uttermost.  No consideration of family or kin\r\nallowed Peroo to keep weak hands or a giddy head on the\r\npay-roll.  \"My honour is the honour of this bridge,\" he would\r\nsay to the about-to-be-dismissed.  \"What do I care for your\r\nhonour? Go and work on a steamer.  That is all you are fit for.\"\r\n\r\nThe little cluster of huts where he and his gang lived centred\r\nround the tattered dwelling of a sea-priest - one who had never\r\nset foot on black water, but had been chosen as ghostly\r\ncounsellor by two generations of sea-rovers all unaffected by\r\nport missions or those creeds which are thrust upon sailors by\r\nagencies along Thames bank.  The priest of the Lascars had\r\nnothing to do with their caste, or indeed with anything at all.\r\nHe ate the offerings of his church, and slept and smoked, and\r\nslept again, \"for,\" said Peroo, who had haled him a thousand\r\nmiles inland, \"he is a very holy man.  He never cares what you\r\neat so long as you do not eat beef, and that is good, because on\r\nland we worship Shiva, we Kharvas; but at sea on the Kumpani's\r\nboats we attend strictly to the orders of the Burra Malum [the\r\nfirst mate], and on this bridge we observe what Finlinson Sahib\r\nsays.\"\r\n\r\nFinlinson Sahib had that day given orders to clear the\r\nscaffolding from the guard-tower on the right bank, and Peroo\r\nwith his mates was casting loose and lowering down the bamboo\r\npoles and planks as swiftly as ever they had whipped the cargo\r\nout of a coaster.\r\n\r\nFrom his trolley he could hear the whistle of the serang's\r\nsilver pipe and the creek and clatter of the pulleys.  Peroo was\r\nstanding on the top-most coping of the tower, clad in the blue\r\ndungaree of his abandoned service, and as Findlayson motioned to\r\nhim to be careful, for his was no life to throw away, he gripped\r\nthe last pole, and, shading his eyes ship-fashion, answered with\r\nthe long-drawn wail of the fo'c'sle lookout:  \"Ham dekhta hai\"\r\n(\"I\r\nam looking out\").  Findlayson laughed and then sighed.  It was\r\nyears since he had seen a steamer, and he was sick for home. As\r\nhis trolley passed under the tower, Peroo descended by a rope,\r\nape-fashion, and cried: \"It looks well now, Sahib.  Our bridge is\r\nall but done.  What think you Mother Gunga will say when the rail\r\nruns over?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has said little so far.  It was never Mother Gunga that\r\ndelayed us.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is always time for her; and none the less there has been\r\ndelay.  Has the Sahib forgotten last autumn's flood, when the\r\nstone-boats were sunk without warning - or only a half-day's\r\nwarning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but nothing save a big flood could hurt us now.  The spurs\r\nare holding well on the West Bank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother Gunga eats great allowances.  There is always room for\r\nmore stone on the revetments. I tell this to the Chota Sahib \"-\r\nhe meant Hitchcock - \"and he laughs.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter, Peroo.  Another year thou wilt be able to build a\r\nbridge in thine own fashion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lascar grinned.  \"Then it will not be in this way - with\r\nstonework sunk under water, as the Qyetta was sunk.  I like\r\nsus-sus-pen-sheen bridges that fly from bank to bank. with one\r\nbig step, like a gang-plank.  Then no water can hurt.  When does\r\nthe Lord Sahib come to open the bridge?\"\r\n\r\n\"In three months, when the weather is cooler.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho! He is like the Burra Malum. He sleeps below while the\r\nwork is being done. Then he comes upon the quarter-deck and\r\ntouches with his finger, and says: 'This is not clean!  Dam\r\njibboonwallah!'\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Lord Sahib does not call me a dam jibboonwallah, Peroo.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Sahib; but he does not come on deck till the work is all\r\nfinished.  Even the Burra Malum of the Nerbudda said once at\r\nTuticorin -\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! Go!  I am busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I, also!\" said Peroo, with an unshaken countenance.  \"May I take\r\nthe light dinghy now and row along the spurs?\"\r\n\r\n\"To hold them with thy hands?  They are, I think, sufficiently\r\nheavy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Sahib.  It is thus.  At sea, on the Black Water, we have\r\nroom to be blown up and down without care.  Here we have no room\r\nat all. Look you, we have put the river into a dock, and run her\r\nbetween stone sills.\"\r\n\r\nFindlayson smiled at the \"we.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have bitted and bridled her.  She is not like the sea, that\r\ncan beat against a soft beach. She is Mother Gunga - in irons.\"\r\nHis voice fell a little.\r\n\r\n\"Peroo, thou hast been up and down the world more even than I.\r\nSpeak true talk, now. How much dost thou in thy heart believe of\r\nMother Gunga?\"\r\n\r\n\"All that our priest says.  London is London, Sahib.  Sydney is\r\nSydney, and Port Darwin is Port Darwin.  Also Mother Gunga is\r\nMother Gunga, and when I come back to her banks I know this and\r\nworship.  In London I did poojah to the big temple by the river\r\nfor the sake of the God within. .  . .  Yes, I will not take the\r\ncushions in the dinghy.\"\r\n\r\nFindlayson mounted his horse and trotted to the shed of a\r\nbungalow that he shared with his assistant.  The place had\r\nbecome home to him in the last three years.  He had grilled in\r\nthe heat, sweated in the rains, and shivered with fever under\r\nthe rude thatch roof; the lime-wash beside the door was covered\r\nwith rough drawings and formulae, and the sentry-path trodden in\r\nthe matting of the verandah showed where he had walked alone.\r\nThere is no eight-hour limit to an engineer's work, and the\r\nevening meal with Hitchcock was eaten booted and spurred: over\r\ntheir cigars they listened to the hum of the village as the\r\ngangs came up from the river-bed and the lights began to\r\ntwinkle.\r\n\r\n\"Peroo has gone up the spurs in your dinghy.  He's taken a couple\r\nof nephews with him, and he's lolling in the stern like a\r\ncommodore,\" said Hitchcock.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right.  He's got something on his mind. You'd think\r\nthat ten years in the British India boats would have knocked\r\nmost of his religion out of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it has,\" said Hitchcock, chuckling.  \"I overheard him the\r\nother day in the middle of a most atheistical talk with that fat\r\nold guru of theirs. Peroo denied the efficacy of prayer; and\r\nwanted the guru to go to sea and watch a gale out with him, and\r\nsee if he could stop a monsoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the same, if you carried off his guru he'd leave us like a\r\nshot.  He was yarning away to me about praying to the dome of St.\r\nPaul's when he was in London.\"\r\n\r\n\"He told me that the first time he went into the engine-room of a\r\nsteamer, when he was a boy, he prayed to the low-pressure\r\ncylinder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not half a bad thing to pray to, either.  He's propitiating his\r\nown Gods now, and he wants to know what Mother Gunga will think\r\nof a bridge being run across her.  Who's there?\"  A shadow\r\ndarkened the doorway, and a telegram was put into Hitchcock's\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"She ought to be pretty well used to it by this time. Only a tar.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be Ralli's answer about the new rivets. . . .  Great\r\nHeavens!\"  Hitchcock jumped to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said the senior, and took the form. \"that's what\r\nMother Gunga thinks, is it,\" he said, reading. \"Keep cool, young\r\n'un. We've got all our work cut out for us. Let's see. Muir wired\r\nhalf an hour ago: 'Floods on the Ramgunga. Look out.'  Well, that\r\ngives us - one, two - nine and a half for the flood to reach\r\nMelipur Ghaut and seven's sixteen and a half to Lataoli - say\r\nfifteen hours before it comes down to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Curse that hill-fed sewer of a Ramgunga! Findlayson, this is two\r\nmonths before anything could have been expected, and the left\r\nbank is littered up with stuff still.  Two full months before\r\nthe time!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why it comes.  I've only known Indian rivers for\r\nfive-and-twenty years, and I don't pretend to understand.  Here\r\ncomes another tar.\" Findlayson opened the telegram.  \"Cockran,\r\nthis time, from the Ganges Canal: 'Heavy rains here. Bad.'  He\r\nmight have saved the last word. Well, we don't want to know any\r\nmore.  We've got to work the gangs all night and clean up the\r\nriverbed.  You'll take the east bank and work out to meet me in\r\nthe middle.  Get everything that floats below the bridge: we\r\nshall have quite enough river-craft coming down adrift anyhow,\r\nwithout letting the stone-boats ram the piers. What have you got\r\non the east bank that needs looking after?\r\n\r\n\"Pontoon - one big pontoon with the overhead crane on it.\r\nT'other overhead crane on the mended pontoon, with the cart-road\r\nrivets from Twenty to Twenty~three piers - two construction\r\nlines, and a turning-spur.  The pilework must take its chance,\"\r\nsaid Hitchcock.\r\n\r\n\"All right.  Roll up everything you can lay hands on.  We'll give\r\nthe gang fifteen minutes more to eat their grub.\"\r\n\r\nClose to the verandah stood a big night~gong, never used except\r\nfor flood, or fire in the village. Hitchcock had called for a\r\nfresh horse, and was off to his side of the bridge when\r\nFindlayson took the cloth-bound stick and smote with the rubbing\r\nstroke that brings out the full thunder of the metal.\r\n\r\nLong before the last rumble ceased every night-gong in the\r\nvillage had taken up the warning. To these were added the hoarse\r\nscreaming of conches in the little temples; the throbbing of\r\ndrums and tom-toms; and, from the European quarters, where the\r\nriveters lived, McCartney's bugle, a weapon of offence on Sundays\r\nand festivals, brayed desperately, calling to \"Stables.\"  Engine\r\nafter engine toiling home along the spurs at the end of her day's\r\nwork whistled in answer till the whistles were answered from the\r\nfar bank.  Then the big gong thundered thrice for a sign that it\r\nwas flood   and not fire; conch, drum, and whistle echoed the\r\ncall, and the village quivered to the sound of bare feet running\r\nupon soft earth.  The order in all cases was to stand by the\r\nday's work and wait instructions.  The gangs poured by in the\r\ndusk; men stopping to knot a loin-cloth or fasten a sandal;\r\ngang-foremen shouting to their subordinates as they ran or paused\r\nby the tool-issue sheds for bars and mattocks; locomotives\r\ncreeping down their tracks wheel-deep in the crowd; till the\r\nbrown torrent disappeared into the dusk of the river-bed, raced\r\nover the pilework, swarmed along the lattices, clustered by the\r\ncranes, and stood still - each man in his place.\r\n\r\nThen the troubled beating of the gong carried the order to take\r\nup everything and bear it beyond high-water mark, and the\r\nflare-lamps broke out by the hundred between the webs of dull\r\niron as the riveters began a night's work, racing against the\r\nflood that was to come.  The girders of the three centre piers -\r\nthose that stood on the cribs -were all but in position.  They\r\nneeded just as many rivets as could be driven into them, for the\r\nflood would assuredly wash out their supports, and the ironwork\r\nwould settle down on the caps of stone if they were not blocked\r\nat the ends.  A hundred crowbars strained at the sleepers of the\r\ntemporary line that fed the unfinished piers.  It was heaved up\r\nin lengths, loaded into trucks, and backed up the bank beyond\r\nflood-level by the groaning locomotives.  The tool-sheds on the\r\nsands melted away before the attack of shouting armies, and with\r\nthem went the stacked ranks of Government stores, iron-hound\r\nboxes of rivets, pliers, cutters, duplicate parts of the\r\nriveting-machines, spare pumps and chains.  The big crane would\r\nbe the last to be shifted, for she was hoisting all the heavy\r\nstuff up to the main structure of the bridge.  The concrete\r\nblocks on the fleet of stone-boats were dropped overside, where\r\nthere was any depth of water, to guard the piers, and the empty\r\nboats themselves were poled under the bridge down-stream.  It was\r\nhere that Peroo's pipe shrilled loudest, for the first stroke of\r\nthe big gong had brought the dinghy back at racing speed, and\r\nPeroo and his people were stripped to the waist, working for the\r\nhonour and credit which are better than life.\r\n\r\n\"I knew she would speak,\" he cried. \"I knew, but the telegraph\r\ngives us good warning. O sons of unthinkable begetting -\r\nchildren of unspeakable shame - are we here for the look of the\r\nthing?\"  It was two feet of wire-rope frayed at the ends, and it\r\ndid wonders as Peroo leaped from gunnel to gunnel, shouting the\r\nlanguage of the sea.\r\n\r\nFindlayson was more troubled for the stone boats than anything\r\nelse.  McCartney, with his gangs, was blocking up the ends of\r\nthe three doubtful spans. but boats adrift, if the flood chanced\r\nto be a high one, might endanger the girders; and there was a\r\nvery fleet in the shrunken channel.\r\n\r\n\"Get them behind the swell of the guard tower,\" he shouted down\r\nto\r\nPeroo.  \"It will be dead-water there.  Get them below the\r\nbridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Accha! [Very good.] I know; we are mooring them with\r\nwire-rope,\" was the answer. \"Heh! Listen to the Chota Sahib.  He\r\nis working hard.\"\r\n\r\n>From across the river came an almost continuous whistling of\r\nlocomotives, backed by the rumble of stone.  Hitchcock at the\r\nlast minute was spending a few hundred more trucks of Tarakee\r\nstone in reinforcing his spurs and embankments.\r\n\r\n\"The bridge challenges Mother Gunga,\" said Peroo, with a laugh.\r\n\"But when she talks I know whose voice will be the loudest.\"\r\n\r\nFor hours the naked men worked, screaming and shouting under the\r\nlights.  It was a hot, moonless night; the end of it was\r\ndarkened by clouds and a sudden squall that made Findlayson very\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n\"She moves!\" said Peroo, just before the dawn. \"Mother Gunga is\r\nawake! Hear!\" He dipped his hand over the side of a boat and the\r\ncurrent mumbled on it.  A little wave hit the side of a pier with\r\na crisp slap.\r\n\r\n\"Six hours before her time,\" said Findlayson, mopping his\r\nforehead savagely.  \"Now we can't depend on anything. We'd\r\nbetter clear all hands out of the riverbed.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the big gong beat, and a second time there was the rushing\r\nof naked feet on earth and ringing iron; the clatter of tools\r\nceased.  In the silence, men heard the dry yawn of water\r\ncrawling over thirsty sand.\r\n\r\nForeman after foreman shouted to Findlayson, who had posted\r\nhimself by the guard-tower, that his section of the river-bed\r\nhad been cleaned out, and when the last voice dropped Findlayson\r\nhurried over the bridge till the iron plating of the permanent\r\nway gave place to the temporary plank-walk over the three centre\r\npiers, and there he met Hitchcock.\r\n\r\n\"'All clear your side?\" said Findlayson.  The whisper rang in the\r\n\r\nbox of lattice work.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and the east channel's filling now. We're utterly out of\r\nour reckoning.  When is this thing down on us?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no saying.  She's filling as fast as she can.  Look!\"\r\nFindlayson pointed to the planks below his feet, where the sand,\r\nburned and defiled by months of work, was beginning to whisper\r\nand fizz.\r\n\r\n\"What orders?\" said Hitchcock.\r\n\r\n\"Call the roll - count stores  sit on your hunkers - and pray for\r\nthe bridge.  That's all I can think of Good night.  Don't risk\r\nyour life trying to fish out anything that may go downstream.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll be as prudent as you are!  'Night. Heavens, how she's\r\nfilling!  Here's the rain in earnest.\r\n\r\nFindlayson picked his way back to his bank, sweeping the last of\r\nMcCartney's riveters before him. The gangs had spread themselves\r\nalong the embankments, regardless of the cold rain of the dawn,\r\nand there they waited for the flood. Only Peroo kept his men\r\ntogether behind the swell of the guard-tower, where the\r\nstone-boats lay tied fore and aft with hawsers, wire-rope, and\r\nchains.\r\n\r\nA shrill wail ran along the line, growing to a yell, half fear\r\nand half wonder: the face of the river whitened from bank to\r\nhank between the stone facings, and the far-away spurs went out\r\nin spouts of foam.  Mother Gunga had come bank-high in haste,\r\nand a wall of chocolate-coloured water was her messenger.  There\r\nwas a shriek above the roar of the water, the complaint of the\r\nspans coming down on their blocks as the cribs were whirled out\r\nfrom under their bellies.  The stone-boats groaned and ground\r\neach other in the eddy that swung round the abutment, and their\r\nclumsy masts rose higher and higher against the dim sky-line.\r\n\r\n\"Before she was shut between these walls we knew what she would\r\ndo.  Now she isthus cramped God only knows what she will do!\"\r\nsaid Peroo, watching the furious turmoil round the guard~tower.\r\n\"Ohe'! Fight, then! Fight hard, for it is thus that a woman wears\r\nherself out.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mother Gunga would not fight as Peroo desired. After the\r\nfirst down-stream plunge there came no more walls of water, but\r\nthe river lifted herself bodily, as a snake when she drinks in\r\nmidsummer, plucking and fingering along the revetments, and\r\nbanking up behind the piers till even Findlayson began to\r\nrecalculate the strength of his work.\r\n\r\nWhen day came the village gasped. \"Only last night,\" men said,\r\nturning to each other, \"it was as a town in the river-bed! Look\r\nnow!\"\r\n\r\nAnd they looked and wondered afresh at the deep water, the racing\r\nwater that licked the throat of the piers.  The farther bank was\r\nveiled by rain, into which the bridge ran out and vanished; the\r\nspurs up-stream were marked by no more than eddies and\r\nspoutings, and down-stream the pent river, once freed of her\r\nguide-lines, had spread like a sea to the horizon. Then hurried\r\nby, rolling in the water, dead men and oxen together, with here\r\nand there a patch of thatched roof that melted when it touched a\r\npier.\r\n\r\n\"Big flood,\" said Peroo, and Findlayson nodded.  It was as big a\r\nflood as he had any wish to watch. His bridge would stand what\r\nwas upon her now, but not very much more, and if by any of a\r\nthousand chances there happened to be a weakness in the\r\nembankments, Mother Gunga would carry his honour to the sea with\r\nthe other raffle. Worst of all, there was nothing to do except\r\nto sit still; and Findlayson sat still under his macintosh till\r\nhis helmet became pulp on his head, and his boots were\r\nover-ankle in mire. He took no count of time, for the river was\r\nmarking the hours, inch by inch and foot by foot, along the\r\nembankment, and he listened, numb and hungry, to the straining\r\nof the stone-boats, the hollow thunder under the piers, and the\r\nhundred noises that make the full note of a flood.  Once a\r\ndripping servant brought him food, but he could not eat; and\r\nonce he thought that he heard a faint toot from a locomotive\r\nacross the river, and then he smiled. The bridge's failure would\r\nhurt his assistant not a little, hut Hitchcock was a young man\r\nwith his big work yet to do. For himself the crash meant\r\neverything - everything that made a hard life worth the living.\r\nThey would say, the men of his own profession . . . he\r\nremembered the half-pitying things that he himself had said when\r\nLockhart's new waterworks burst and broke down in brick-heaps and\r\nsludge, and Lockhart's spirit broke in him and he died.  He\r\nremembered what he himself had said when the Sumao Bridge went\r\nout in the big cyclone by the sea; and most he remembered poor\r\nHartopp's face three weeks later, when the shame had marked it.\r\nHis bridge was twice the size of Hartopp's, and it carried the\r\nFindlayson truss as well as the new pier-shoe - the Findlayson\r\nbolted shoe. There were no excuses in his service. Government\r\nmight listen, perhaps, but his own kind would judge him by his\r\nbridge, as that stood or fell. He went over it in his head, plate\r\nby plate, span by span, brick by brick, pier by pier,\r\nremembering, comparing, estimating, and recalculating, lest there\r\nshould be any mistake; and through the long hours and through the\r\nflights of formulae that danced and wheeled before him a cold\r\nfear would come to pinch his heart. His side of the sum was\r\nbeyond question; but what man knew Mother Gunga's arithmetic?\r\nEven as he was making all sure by the multiplication table, the\r\nriver might be scooping a pot-hole to the very bottom of any one\r\nof those eighty-foot piers that carried his reputation.  Again a\r\nservant came to him with food, but his mouth was dry, and he\r\ncould only drink and return to the decimals in his brain. And\r\nthe river was still rising. Peroo, in a mat shelter coat,\r\ncrouched at his feet, watching now his face and now the face of\r\nthe river, but saying nothing.\r\n\r\nAt last the Lascar rose and floundered through the mud towards\r\nthe village, but he was careful to leave an ally to watch the\r\nboats.\r\n\r\nPresently he returned, most irreverently driving before him the\r\npriest of his creed - a fat old man, with a grey beard that\r\nwhipped the wind with the wet cloth that blew over his shoulder.\r\nNever was seen so lamentable a guru.\r\n\r\n\"What good are offerings and little kerosene lamps and dry\r\ngrain,\" shouted Peroo, \"if squatting in the mud is all that thou\r\ncanst do?  Thou hast dealt long with the Gods when they were\r\ncontented and well-wishing.  Now they are angry. Speak to them!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a man against the wrath of Gods?\" whined the priest,\r\ncowering as the wind took him. \"Let me go to the temple, and I\r\nwill pray there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Son of a pig, pray here! Is there no return for salt fish and\r\ncurry powder and dried onions? Call aloud! Tell Mother Gunga we\r\nhave had enough. Bid her be still for the night. I cannot pray,\r\nbut I have been serving in the Kumpani's boats, and when men did\r\nnot obey my orders I -\"  A flourish of the wire-rope colt\r\nrounded the sentence, and the priest, breaking free from his\r\ndisciple, fled to the village.\r\n\r\n\"Fat pig!\" said Peroo. \"After all that we have done for him! When\r\nthe flood is down I will see to it that we get a new guru.\r\nFinlinson Sahib, it darkens for night now, and since yesterday\r\nnothing has been eaten. Be wise, Sahib. No man can endure\r\nwatching and great thinking on an empty belly.  Lie down, Sahib.\r\nThe river will do what the river will do.\"\"The bridge is mine; I\r\ncannot leave it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wilt thou hold it up with thy hands, then?\" said Peroo,\r\nlaughing. \"I was troubled for my boats and sheers before the\r\nflood came.  Now we are in the hands of the Gods. The Sahib will\r\nnot eat and lie down? Take these, then. They are meat and good\r\ntoddy together, and they kill all weariness, besides the fever\r\nthat follows the rain. I have eaten nothing else to-day at all.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a small tin tobacco-box from his sodden waist-belt and\r\nthrust it into Findlayson's hand, saying: \"Nay, do not be\r\nafraid.  It is no more than opium - clean Malwa opium.\r\n\r\nFindlayson shook two or three of the dark-brown pellets into his\r\nhand, and hardly knowing what he did, swallowed them. The stuff\r\nwas at least a good guard against fever -the fever that was\r\ncreeping upon him out of the wet mud -and he had seen what Peroo\r\ncould do in the stewing mists of autumn on the strength of a dose\r\nfrom the tin box.\r\n\r\nPeroo nodded with bright eyes.  \"In a little - in a little the\r\nSahib will find that he thinks well again. I too will -\" He\r\ndived into his treasure-box, resettled the rain-coat over his\r\nhead, and squatted down to watch the boats.  It was too dark now\r\nto see beyond the first pier, and the night seemed to have given\r\nthe river new strength. Findlayson stood with his chin on his\r\nchest, thinking.  There was one point about one of the piers -\r\nthe seventh - that he had not fully settled in his mind.  The\r\nfigures would not shape themselves to the eye except one by one\r\nand at enormous intervals of time.  There was a sound rich and\r\nmellow in his ears like the deepest note of a double-bass - an\r\nentrancing sound upon which he pondered for several hours, as it\r\nseemed. Then Peroo was at his elbow, shouting that a wire hawser\r\nhad snapped and the stone-boats were loose.  Findlayson saw the\r\nfleet open and swing out fanwise to a long-drawn shriek of wire\r\nstraining across gunnels.\r\n\r\n\"A tree hit them. They will all go,\" cried Peroo. \"The main\r\nhawser has parted. What does the Sahib do?\"\r\n\r\nAn immensely complex plan had suddenly flashed into Findlayson's\r\nmind.  He saw the ropes running from boat to boat in straight\r\nlines and angles - each rope a line of white fire. But there was\r\none rope which was the master rope. He could see that rope.  If\r\nhe could pull it once, it was absolutely and mathematically\r\ncertain that the disordered fleet would reassemble itself in the\r\nbackwater behind the guard-tower.  But why, he wondered, was\r\nPeroo clinging so desperately to his waist as he hastened down\r\nthe bank? It was necessary to put the Lascar aside, gently and\r\nslowly, because it was necessary to save the boats, and,\r\nfurther, to demonstrate the extreme ease of the problem that\r\nlooked so difficult.  And then - but it was of no conceivable\r\nimportance -  a wire-rope raced through his hand, burning it,\r\nthe high bank disappeared,  and with it all the slowly\r\ndispersing factors of the problem. He was sitting in the rainy\r\ndarkness - sitting in a boat that spun like a top, and Peroo was\r\nstanding over him.\r\n\r\n\"I had forgotten,\" said the Lascar, slowly, \"that to those\r\nfasting and unused, the opium is worse than any wine. Those who\r\ndie in Gunga go to the Gods. Still, I have no desire to present\r\nmyself before such great ones. Can the Sahib swim?\"\r\n\r\n\"What need? He can fly - fly as swiftly as the wind,\" was the\r\nthick answer.\r\n\r\n\"He is mad!\" muttered Peroo, under his breath. \"And he threw me\r\naside like a bundle of dung-cakes. Well, he will not know his\r\ndeath. The boat cannot live an hour here even if she strike\r\nnothing. It is not good to look at death with a clear eye.\"\r\n\r\nHe refreshed himself again from the tin box, squatted down in the\r\nbows of the reeling, pegged, and stitched craft, staring through\r\nthe mist at the nothing that was there.  A warm drowsiness crept\r\nover Findlayson, the Chief Engineer, whose duty was with his\r\nbridge. The heavy raindrops struck him with a thousand tingling\r\nlittle thrills, and the weight of all time since time was made\r\nhung heavy on his eyelids. He thought and perceived that he was\r\nperfectly secure, for the water was so solid that a man could\r\nsurely step out upon it, and, standing still with his legs apart\r\nto keep his balance - this was the most important point - would\r\nbe borne with great and easy speed to the shore. But yet a better\r\nplan came to him.  It needed only an exertion of will for the\r\nsoul to hurl the body ashore as wind drives paper, to waft it\r\nkite-fashion to the bank. Thereafter - the boat spun dizzily -\r\nsuppose the high wind got under the freed body?  Would it tower\r\nup like a kite and pitch headlong on the far-away sands, or would\r\nit duck about, beyond control, through all eternity? Findlayson\r\ngripped the gunnel to anchor himself, for it seemed that he was\r\non the edge of taking the flight before he had settled all his\r\nplans. Opium has more effect on the white man than the black.\r\nPeroo was only comfortably indifferent to accidents. \"She cannot\r\nlive,\" he grunted. \"Her seams open already. If she were even a\r\ndinghy with oars we could have ridden it out; but a box with\r\nholes is no good. Finlinson Sahib, she fills.\"\r\n\r\n\"Accha! I am going away. Come thou also.\" In his mind, Findlayson\r\nhad already escaped from the boat, and was circling high in air\r\nto find a rest for the sole of his foot. His body - he was\r\nreally sorry for its gross helplessness - lay in the stern, the\r\nwater rushing about its knees.\r\n\r\n\"How very ridiculous!\" he said to himself from his eyrie -\" that\r\n- is Findlayson -  chief of the Kashi Bridge. The poor beast is\r\ngoing to be drowned, too. Drowned when it's close to shore. I'm\r\n- I'm on shore already. Why doesn't it come along?\"\r\n\r\nTo his intense disgust, he found his soul back in his body again,\r\nand that body spluttering and choking in deep water. The pain of\r\nthe reunion was atrocious, but it was necessary, also, to fight\r\nfor the body. He was conscious of grasping wildly at wet sand,\r\nand striding prodigiously, as one strides in a dream, to keep\r\nfoothold in the swirling water, till at last he hauled himself\r\nclear of the hold of the river, and dropped, panting, on wet\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\"Not this night,\" said Peroo, in his ear. \"The Gods have\r\nprotected us.\"  The Lascar moved his feet cautiously, and they\r\nrustled among dried stumps. \"This is some island of last year's\r\nindigo-crop,\" he went on. \"We shall find no men here; but have\r\ngreat care, Sahib; all the snakes of a hundred miles have been\r\nflooded out.  Here comes the lightning, on the heels of the\r\nwind. Now we shall be able to look; but walk carefully.\"\r\n\r\nFindlayson was far and far beyond any fear of snakes, or indeed\r\nany merely human emotion. He saw, after he had rubbed the water\r\nfrom his eyes, with an immense clearness, and trod, so it seemed\r\nto himself with world-encompassing strides.  Somewhere in the\r\nnight of time he had built a bridge - a bridge that spanned\r\nillimitable levels of shining seas; but the Deluge had swept it\r\naway, leaving this one island under heaven for Findlayson and his\r\ncompanion, sole survivors of the breed of Man.\r\n\r\nAn incessant lightning, forked and blue, showed all that there\r\nwas to be seen on the little patch in the flood - a clump of\r\nthorn, a clump of swaying creaking bamboos, and a grey gnarled\r\npeepul overshadowing a Hindoo shrine, from whose dome floated a\r\ntattered red flag. The holy man whose summer resting-place it was\r\nhad long since abandoned it, and the weather had broken the\r\nred-daubed image of his god.  The two men stumbled, heavy-limbed\r\nand heavy-eyed, over the ashes of a brick-set cooking-place, and\r\ndropped down under the shelter of the branches, while the rain\r\nand river roared together.\r\n\r\nThe stumps of the indigo crackled, and there was a smell of\r\ncattle, as a huge and dripping Brahminee bull shouldered his way\r\nunder the tree. The flashes revealed the trident mark of Shiva on\r\nhis flank, the insolence of head and hump, the luminous stag-like\r\neyes, the brow crowned with a wreath of sodden marigold blooms,\r\nand the silky dewlap that almost swept the ground.  There was a\r\nnoise behind him of other beasts coming up from the flood-line\r\nthrough the thicket, a sound of heavy feet and deep breathing.\r\n\r\n\"Here be more beside ourselves,\" said Findlayson, his head\r\nagainst the tree pole, looking through half-shut eyes, wholly at\r\nease.\r\n\r\n\"Truly,\" said Peroo, thickly, \"and no small ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they, then? I do not see clearly.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Gods. Who else? Look!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, true! The Gods surely - the Gods.\" Findlayson smiled as his\r\nhead fell forward on his chest.  Peroo was eminently right.\r\nAfter the Flood, who should be alive in the land except the Gods\r\nthat made it - the Gods to whom his village prayed nightly - the\r\nGods who were in all men's mouths and about all men's ways. He\r\ncould not raise his head or stir a finger for the trance that\r\nheld him, and Peroo was smiling vacantly at the lightning.\r\n\r\nThe Bull paused by the shrine, his head lowered to the damp\r\nearth. A green Parrot in the branches preened his wet wings and\r\nscreamed against the thunder as the circle under the tree filled\r\nwith the shifting shadows of beasts. There was a black Buck at\r\nthe Bull's heels-such a Buck as Findlayson in his far-away life\r\nupon earth might have seen in dreams - a Buck with a royal head,\r\nebon back, silver belly, and gleaming straight horns.  Beside\r\nhim, her head bowed to the ground, the green eyes burning under\r\nthe heavy brows, with restless tail switching the dead grass,\r\npaced a Tigress, full-bellied and deep-jowled.\r\n\r\nThe Bull crouched beside the shrine, and there leaped from the\r\ndarkness a monstrous grey Ape, who seated himself man-wise in\r\nthe place of the fallen image, and the rain spilled like jewels\r\nfrom the hair of his neck and shoulders.Other shadows came and\r\nwent behind the circle, among them a drunken Man flourishing\r\nstaff and drinking-bottle. Then a hoarse bellow broke out from\r\nnear the ground. \"The flood lessens even now,\" it cried.  \"Hour\r\nby hour the water falls, and their bridge still stands!\"\r\n\r\n\"My bridge,\" said Findlayson to himself \"That must be very old\r\nwork now. What have the Gods to do with my bridge?\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes rolled in the darkness following the roar. A Mugger -\r\nthe blunt-nosed, ford-haunting Mugger of the Ganges -draggled\r\nherself before the beasts, lashing furiously to right and left\r\nwith her tail.\r\n\r\n\"They have made it too strong for me. In all this night I have\r\nonly torn away a handful of planks. The walls stand. The towers\r\nstand. They have chained my flood, and the river is not free any\r\nmore. Heavenly Ones, take this yoke away! Give me clear water\r\nbetween bank and bank! It is I, Mother Gunga, that speak. The\r\nJustice of the Gods!  Deal me the Justice of the Gods!\"\r\n\r\n\"What said I?\" whispered Peroo.  \"This is in truth a Punchayet of\r\nthe Gods. Now we know that all the world is dead, save you and\r\nI, Sahib.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parrot screamed and fluttered again, and the Tigress, her\r\nears flat to her head, snarled wickedly.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the shadow, a great trunk and gleaming tusks swayed\r\nto and fro, and a low gurgle broke the silence that followed on\r\nthe snarl.\r\n\r\n\"We be here,\" said a deep voice, \"the Great Ones.  One only and\r\nvery many.  Shiv, my father, is here, with Indra. Kali has\r\nspoken already.  Hanuman listens also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kashi is without her Kotwal to-night,\" shouted the Man with the\r\ndrinking-bottle, flinging his staff to the ground, while the\r\nisland rang to the baying of hounds.  \"Give her the Justice of\r\nthe Gods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye were still when they polluted my waters,\" the great Crocodile\r\nbellowed. \"Ye made no sign when my river was trapped between the\r\nwalls.  I had no help save my own strength, and that failed - the\r\nstrength of Mother Gunga failed - before their guard-towers.\r\nWhat\r\ncould I do?  I have done everything.  Finish now, Heavenly\r\nOnes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I brought the death; I rode the spotted sick-ness from hut to\r\nhut of their workmen, and yet they would not cease.\" A\r\nnose-slitten, hide-worn Ass, lame, scissor-legged, and galled,\r\nlimped forward. \"I cast the death at them out of my nostrils,\r\nbut they would not cease.\"\r\n\r\nPeroo would have moved, but the opium lay heavy upon him.\r\n\r\n.\" Bah!\" he said, spitting. \"Here is Sitala herself; Mata - the\r\nsmall-pox. Has the Sahib a handkerchief to put over his face?\"\r\n\r\n\"Little help! They fed me the corpses for a month, and I flung\r\nthem out on my sand-bars, but their work went forward.  Demons\r\nthey are, and sons of demons! And ye left Mother Gunga alone for\r\ntheir fire-carriage to make a mock of The Justice of the Gods on\r\nthe bridge-builders!\"\r\n\r\nThe Bull turned the cud in his mouth and answered slowly: \"If the\r\nJustice of the Gods caught all who made a mock of holy things\r\nthere would be many dark altars in the land, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this goes beyond a mock,\" said the Tigress, darting forward\r\na griping paw. \"Thou knowest, Shiv, and ye, too, Heavenly Ones;\r\nye know that they have defiled Gunga. Surely they must come to\r\nthe Destroyer. Let Indra judge.\"\r\n\r\nThe Buck made no movement as he answered:  \"How long has this\r\nevil been?\r\n\r\n\"Three years, as men count years,\" said the Mugger, close pressed\r\nto the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Does Mother Gunga die, then, in a year, that she is so anxious\r\nto see vengeance now? The deep sea was where she runs but\r\nyesterday, and to-morrow the sea shall cover her again as the\r\nGods count that which men call time. Can any say that this their\r\nbridge endures till to-morrow?\" said the Buck.\r\n\r\nThere was a long hush, and in the clearing of the storm the full\r\nmoon stood up above the dripping trees.\r\n\r\n\"Judge ye, then,\" said the River, sullenly. \"I have spoken my\r\nshame.  The flood falls still. I can do no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"For my own part \" - it was the voice of the great Ape seated\r\nwithin the shrine -\" it pleases me well to watch these men,\r\nremembering that I also builded no small bridge in the world's\r\nyouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"They say, too,\" snarled the Tiger, \"that these men came of the\r\nwreck of thy armies, Hanuman, and therefore thou hast aided -\"\r\n\r\n\"They toil as my armies toiled in Lanka, and they believe that\r\ntheir toil endures. Indra is too high, but Shiv, thou knowest\r\nhow the land is threaded with their fire-carriages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yea, I know,\" said the Bull. \"Their Gods instructed them in the\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\nA laugh ran round the circle.\r\n\r\n\"Their Gods! What should their Gods know? They were born\r\nyesterday, and those that made them are scarcely yet cold,\" said\r\nthe Mugger. \"To-morrow their Gods will die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" said Peroo. \"Mother Gunga talks good talk. I told that to\r\nthe padre-sahib who preached on the Mombassa, and he asked the\r\nBurra Malum to put me in irons for a great rudeness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely they make these things to please their Gods,\" said the\r\nBull again.\r\n\r\n\"Not altogether,\" the Elephant rolled forth. \"It is for the\r\nprofit of my mahajuns - my fat money-lenders that worship me at\r\neach new year, when they draw my image at the head of the\r\naccount-books.  I, looking over their shoulders by lamplight,\r\nsee that the names in the books are those of men in far places -\r\nfor all the towns are drawn together by the fire-carriage, and\r\nthe money comes and goes swiftly, and the account-books grow as\r\nfat as - myself. And I, who am Ganesh of Good Luck, I bless my\r\npeoples.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have changed the face of the land-which is my land. They\r\nhave killed and made new towns on my banks,\" said the Mugger.\r\n\r\n\"It is but the shifting of a little dirt. Let the dirt dig in the\r\ndirt if it pleases the dirt,\" answered the Elephant.\r\n\r\n\"But afterwards?\" said the Tiger. \"Afterwards they will see that\r\nMother Gunga can avenge no insult, and they fall away from her\r\nfirst, and later from us all, one by one. In the end, Ganesh, we\r\nare left with naked altars.\"\r\n\r\nThe drunken Man staggered to his feet, and hiccupped vehemently.\r\n\r\n\"Kali lies.  My sister lies.  Also this my stick is the Kotwal of\r\nKashi, and he keeps tally of my pilgrims.  When the time comes\r\nto worship Bhairon-and it is always time - the fire-carriages\r\nmove one by one, and each bears a thousand pilgrims.  They do\r\nnot come afoot any more, but rolling upon wheels, and my honour\r\nis increased.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gunga, I have seen thy bed at Pryag black with the pilgrims,\"\r\nsaid the Ape, leaning forward, \"and but for the fire-carriage\r\nthey would have come slowly and in fewer numbers. Remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"They come to me always,\" Bhairon went on thickly.  \"By day and\r\nnight they pray to me, all the Common People in the fields and\r\nthe roads. Who is like Bhairon to-day? What talk is this of\r\nchanging faiths? Is my staff Kotwal of Kashi for nothing? He\r\nkeeps the tally, and he says that never were so many altars as\r\ntoday, and the fire carriage serves them well.  Bhairon am I -\r\nBhairon of the Common People, and the chiefest of the Heavenly\r\nOnes to-day.  Also my staff says -\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace, thou\" lowed the Bull.  \"The worship of the schools is\r\nmine, and they talk very wisely, asking whether I be one or\r\nmany, as is the delight of my people, and ye know what I am.\r\nKali, my wife, thou knowest also.\" \"Yea, I know,\" said the\r\nTigress, with lowered head.\r\n\r\n\"Greater am I than Gunga also. For ye know who moved the minds of\r\nmen that they should count Gunga holy among the rivers.  Who die\r\nin that water - ye know how  men say - come to us without\r\npunishment, and Gunga knows that the fire-carriage  has borne to\r\nher scores upon scores of such anxious ones; and Kali knows that\r\nshe has held her chiefest festivals among the pilgrimages that\r\nare fed by the fire-carriage. Who smote at Pooree, under the\r\nImage there, her thousands in a day and a night, and bound the\r\nsickness to the wheels of the fire-carriages, so that it ran from\r\none end of the land to the other?  Who but Kali?  Before the\r\nfire-carriage came it was a heavy toil.  The fire-carriages have\r\nserved thee well, Mother of Death.  But I speak for mine own\r\naltars, who am not Bhairon of the Common Folk, but Shiv.  Men go\r\nto and fro, making words and telling talk of strange Gods, and I\r\nlisten. Faith follows faith among my people in the schools,  and\r\nI have no anger; for when all words are said, and the new talk is\r\nended, to Shiv men return at the last.\"\r\n\r\n\"True. It is true,\" murmured Hanuman. \"To Shiv and to the others,\r\nmother, they return. I creep from temple to temple in the North,\r\nwhere they worship one God and His Prophet; and presently my\r\nimage is alone within their shrines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Small thanks,\" said the Buck, turning his head slowly. \"I am\r\nthat One and His Prophet also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even so, father,\" said Hanuman. \"And to the South I go who am\r\nthe oldest of the Gods as men know the Gods, and presently I\r\ntouch the shrines of the New Faith and the Woman whom we know is\r\nhewn twelve-armed, and still they call her Mary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Small thanks, brother,\" said the Tigress. \"I am that Woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even so, sister; and I go West among the fire-carriages, and\r\nstand before the bridge-builders in many shapes, and because of\r\nme they change their faiths and are very wise.. Ho! ho! I am the\r\nbuilder of bridges, indeed - bridges between this and that, and\r\neach bridge leads surely to Us in the end. Be content, Gunga.\r\nNeither these men nor those that follow them mock thee at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I alone, then, Heavenly Ones? Shall I smooth out my flood\r\nlest unhappily I bear away their walls? Will Indra dry my\r\nsprings in the  hills and make me crawl humbly between their\r\nwharfs?  Shall I bury me in the sand ere I offend?\"\r\n\r\n\"And all for the sake of a little iron bar with the\r\nfire-carriage atop. Truly, Mother Gunga is always young!\" said\r\nGanesh the Elephant. \"A child had not spoken more foolishly. Let\r\nthe dirt dig in the dirt ere it return to the dirt.  I know only\r\nthat my people grow rich and praise me. Shiv has said that the\r\nmen of the schools do not forget; Bhairon is content for his\r\ncrowd of the Common People; and Hanuman laughs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely I laugh,\" said the Ape. \"My altars are few beside those\r\nof Ganesh or Bhairon, but the fire-carriages bring me new\r\nworshippers from beyond the Black Water - the men who believe\r\nthat their God is toil.  I run before them beckoning, and they\r\nfollow Hanuman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give them the toil that they desire, then,\" said the River.\r\n\"Make a bar across my flood and throw the water back upon the\r\nbridge. Once thou wast strong in Lanka, Hanuman. Stoop and lift\r\nmy bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who gives life can take life.\" The Ape scratched in the mud with\r\na long forefinger. \"And yet, who would profit by the killing?\r\nVery many would die.\"\r\n\r\nThere came up from the water a snatch of a love-song such as the\r\nboys sing when they watch their cattle in the noon heats of late\r\nspring. The parrot screamed joyously, sidling along his branch\r\nwith lowered head as the song grew louder, and in a patch of\r\nclear moonlight stood revealed the young herd, the darling of the\r\nGopis, the idol of dreaming maids and of mothers ere their\r\nchildren are born  Krishna the Well-beloved.  He stooped to knot\r\nup his long wet hair, and the Parrot fluttered to his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Fleeting and singing, and singing and fleeting,\" hiccupped\r\nBhairon.  \"Those make thee late for the council, brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\" said Krishna, with a laugh, throwing back his head.\r\n\"Ye can do little without me or Karma here.\" He fondled the\r\nParrot's plumage and laughed again. \"What is this sitting and\r\ntalking together? I heard Mother Gunga roaring in the dark, and\r\nso came quickly from a hut where I lay warm. And what have ye\r\ndone to Karma, that he is so wet and silent? And what does\r\nMother Gunga here? Are the heavens full that ye must come\r\npaddling in the mud beast-wise? Karma, what do they do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gunga has prayed for a vengeance on the bridge-builders, and\r\nKali is with her. Now she bids Hanuman whelm the bridge, that\r\nher honour may be made great,\" cried the Parrot. \"I waited here,\r\nknowing that thou wouldst come, O my master!\r\n\r\n\"And the Heavenly Ones said nothing?  Did Gunga and the Mother of\r\nSorrows out-talk them? Did none speak for my people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" said Ganesh, moving uneasily from foot to foot; \"I said it\r\nwas but dirt at play, and why should we stamp it flat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was content to let them toil -well content,\" said Hanuman.\r\n\r\n\"What had I to do with Gunga's anger?\" said the Bull.\r\n\r\n\"I am Bhairon of the Common Folk, and this my staff is Kotwal of\r\nall Kashi. I spoke for the Common People.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou?\" The young God's eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n\"Am I not the first of the Gods in their mouths to-day?\" returned\r\nBhairon, unabashed. \"For the sake of the Common People I said -\r\nvery many wise things which I have now forgotten, but this my\r\nstaff-\"\r\n\r\nKrishna turned impatiently, saw the Mugger at his feet, and\r\nkneeling, slipped an arm round the cold neck. \"Mother,\" he said\r\ngently, \"get thee to thy flood again. The matter is not for thee.\r\nWhat harm shall thy honour take of this live dirt? Thou hast\r\ngiven them their fields new year after year, and by thy flood\r\nthey are made strong. They come all to thee at the last. What\r\nneed to slay them now? Have pity, mother, for a little - and it\r\nis only for a little.\"\"If it be only for a little  \" the slow\r\nbeast began.\r\n\r\n\"Are they Gods, then?\" Krishna returned with a laugh, his eyes\r\nlooking into the dull eyes of the River. \"Be certain that it is\r\nonly for a little. The Heavenly Ones have heard thee, and\r\npresently justice will be done. Go now, mother, to the flood\r\nagain. Men and cattle are thick on the waters - the banks fall -\r\nthe villages melt because of thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the bridge - the bridge stands.\" The Mugger turned grunting\r\ninto the undergrowth as Krishna rose.\r\n\r\n\"It is ended,\" said the Tigress, viciously. \"There is no more\r\njustice from the Heavenly Ones. Ye have made shame and sport of\r\nGunga, who asked no more than a few score lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of my people - who lie under the leaf-roofs of the village\r\nyonder - of the young girls, and the young men who sing to them\r\nin the dark -of the child that will be born next morn - of that\r\nwhich was begotten to-night,\" said Krishna. \"And when all is\r\ndone, what profit? To-morrow sees them at work. Ay, if ye swept\r\nthe bridge out from end to end they would begin anew. Hear me!\r\nBhairon is drunk always. Hanuman mocks his people with new\r\nriddles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but they are very old ones,\" the Ape said, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Shiv hears the talk of the schools and the dreams of the holy\r\nmen; Ganesh thinks only of his fat traders; but I - I live with\r\nthese my people, asking for  no gifts, and so receiving them\r\nhourly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And very tender art thou of thy people,\" said the Tigress.\r\n\r\n\"They are my own. The old women dream of me turning in their\r\nsleep; the maids look and listen for me when they go to fill\r\ntheir lotahs by the river. I walk by the young men waiting\r\nwithout the gates at dusk, and I call over my shoulder to the\r\nwhite-beards. Ye know, Heavenly Ones, that I alone of us all\r\nwalk upon the earth continually, and have no pleasure in our\r\nheavens so long as a green blade springs here, or there are two\r\nvoices at twilight in the standing crops.  Wise are ye, but ye\r\nlive far off; forgetting whence ye came. So  do I not forget.\r\nAnd the fire-carriage feeds your shrines, ye say? And the\r\nfire-carriages bring a thousand pilgrims where but ten came in\r\nthe old years? True. That is true, to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"But to-morrow they are dead, brother,\" said Ganesh.\r\n\r\n\"Peace!\" said the Bull, as Hanuman leaned forward again. \"And\r\nto-morrow, beloved - what of to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"This only. A new word creeping from mouth to mouth among the\r\nCommon Folk - a word that neither man nor God can lay hold of -\r\nan evil word - a little lazy word among the Common Folk, saying\r\n(and none know who set that word afoot) that they weary of ye,\r\nHeavenly Ones.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gods laughed together softly. \"And then, beloved ~\" they\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"And to cover that weariness they, my people, will bring to thee,\r\nShiv, and to thee, Ganesh, at first greater offerings and a\r\nlouder noise of worship. But the word has gone abroad, and,\r\nafter, they will pay fewer dues to your fat Brahmins. Next they\r\nwill forget your altars, but so slowly that no man can say how\r\nhis forgetfulness began.\"\r\n\r\nI knew - I knew!  I spoke this also, but they would not hear,\"\r\nsaid the Tigress. \"We should have slain-we should have slain!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is too late now. Ye should have slain at the beginning when\r\nthe men from across the water had taught our folk nothing. Now\r\nmy people see their work, and go away thinking. They do not\r\nthink of the Heavenly Ones altogether. They think of the\r\nfire-carriage and the other things that the bridge-builders have\r\ndone, and when your priests thrust forward hands asking alms,\r\nthey give a little unwillingly. That is the beginning, among one\r\nor two, or five or ten - for I, moving among my people, know what\r\nis in their hearts.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the end, Jester of the Gods? What shall the end be?\" said\r\nGanesh.\r\n\r\nThe end shall be as it was in the beginning, O slothful son of\r\nShiv! The flame shall die upon the altars and the prayer upon\r\nthe tongue till ye become little Gods again - Gods of the jungle\r\n-names that the hunters of rats and noosers of dogs whisper in\r\nthe thicket and among the caves -rag-Gods, pot Godlings of the\r\ntree, and the village-mark, as ye were at the beginning. That is\r\nthe end, Ganesh, for thee, and for Bhairon - Bhairon of the\r\nCommon People.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very far away,\" grunted Bhairon. \"Also, it is a lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many women have kissed Krishna. They told him this to cheer\r\ntheir own hearts when the grey hairs came, and he has told us\r\nthe tale,\" said the Bull, below his breath.\r\n\r\n\"Their Gods came, and we changed them. I took the Woman and made\r\nher twelve-armed. So shall we twist all their Gods,\" said\r\nHanuman.\r\n\r\n\"Their Gods! This is no question of their Gods - one or three -\r\nman or woman.  The matter is with the people. ~ move, and not\r\nthe Gods of the bridge-builders,\" said Krishna.\r\n\r\n\"So be it. I have made a man worship the fire-carriage as it\r\nstood still breathing smoke, and he knew not that he worshipped\r\nme,\" said Hanuman the Ape. \"They will only change a little the\r\nnames of their Gods.  I shall lead the builders of the bridges as\r\nof old; Shiv shall be worshipped in the schools by such as doubt\r\nand despise their fellows; Ganesh shall have his mahajuns, and\r\nBhairon the donkey-drivers, the pilgrims, and the sellers of\r\ntoys. Beloved, they will do no more than change the names, and\r\nthat we have seen a thousand times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely they will do no more than change the names,\" echoed\r\nGanesh; but there was an uneasy movement among the Gods.\r\n\r\n\"They will change more than the names. Me alone they cannot kill,\r\nso long as a maiden and a man meet together or the spring\r\nfollows the winter rains. Heavenly Ones, not for nothing have I\r\nwalked upon the earth. My people know not now what they know;\r\nbut I, who live with them, I read their hearts. Great Kings, the\r\nbeginning of the end is born already. The fire-carriages shout\r\nthe names of new Gods that are not the old under new names.\r\nDrink now and eat greatly!  Bathe your faces in the smoke of the\r\naltars before they grow cold! Take dues and listen to the\r\ncymbals and the drums, Heavenly Ones, while yet there are\r\nflowers and songs. As men count time the end is far off; but as\r\nwe who know reckon it is to-day. I have spoken.\"\r\n\r\nThe young God ceased, and his brethren looked at each other long\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\n\"This I have not heard before,\" Peroo whispered in his\r\ncompanion's ear. \"And yet sometimes, when I oiled the brasses in\r\nthe engine-room of the Goorkha, I have wondered if our priests\r\nwere so wise - so wise. The day is coming, Sahib.  They will be\r\ngone by the morning.\"\r\n\r\nA yellow light broadened in the sky, and the tone of the river\r\nchanged  as the darkness withdrew.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the Elephant trumpeted aloud as though man had goaded\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Let Indra judge. Father of all, speak thou! What of the things\r\nwe have heard?  Has Krishna lied indeed? Or --\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye know,\" said the Buck, rising to his feet. \"Ye know the Riddle\r\nof the Gods.  When Brahm ceases to dream, the Heavens and the\r\nHells and Earth disappear.  Be content. Brahm dreams still.  The\r\ndreams come and go, and the nature of the dreams changes, but\r\nstill Brahm dreams.  Krishna has walked too long upon earth, and\r\nyet I love him the more for the tale he has told. The Gods\r\nchange, beloved - all save One!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, all save one that makes love in the hearts of men,\" said\r\nKrishna, knotting his girdle. \"It is but a little time to wait,\r\nand ye shall know if I lie.\"Truly it is but a little time, as\r\nthou sayest, and we shall know. Get thee to thy huts again,\r\nbeloved, and make sport for the young things, for still Brahm\r\ndreams.  Go, my children! Brahm dreams and till he wakes the\r\nGods die not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither went they -\" said the Lascar, awe-struck, shivering a\r\nlittle with the cold.\r\n\r\n\"God knows!\" said Findlayson. The river and the island lay in\r\nfull daylight now, and there was never mark of hoof or pug on\r\nthe wet earth under the peepul. Only a parrot screamed in the\r\nbranches, bringing down showers of water-drops as he fluttered\r\nhis wings.\r\n\r\n\"Up! We are cramped with cold! Has the opium died out?  Canst\r\nthou move, Sahib?\"\r\n\r\nFindlayson staggered to his feet and shook himself. His bead swam\r\nand ached, but the work of the opium was over, and, as he\r\nsluiced his forehead in a pool, the Chief Engineer of the Kashi\r\nBridge was wondering how he had managed to fall upon the island,\r\nwhat chances the day offered of return, and, above all, how his\r\nwork stood.\r\n\r\n\"Peroo, I have forgotten much I was under the guard-tower\r\nwatching the river; and then --- Did the flood sweep us away?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. The boats broke loose, Sahib, and\" (if the Sahib had\r\nforgotten about the opium, decidedly Peroo would not remind him)\r\n\"in striving to retie them, so it seemed to me but it was dark -\r\na rope caught the Sahib and threw him upon a boat.  Considering\r\nthat we two, with Hitchcock Sahib, built, as it were, that\r\nbridge, I came also upon the boat, which came riding on\r\nhorseback, as it were, on the nose of this island, and so,\r\nsplitting, cast us ashore. I made a great cry when the boat left\r\nthe wharf and without doubt Hitchcock Sahib will come for us. As\r\nfor the bridge, so many have died in the building that it cannot\r\nfall.\"A fierce sun, that drew out all the smell of the sodden\r\nland, had followed the storm, and in that clear light there was\r\nno room for a man to think of the dreams of the dark. Findlayson\r\nstared upstream, across the blaze of moving water, till his eyes\r\nached. There was no sign of any bank to the Ganges, much less of\r\na bridge-line.\r\n\r\n\"We came down far,\" he said. \"It was wonderful that we were not\r\ndrowned a hundred times.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was the least of the wonder, for no man dies before his\r\ntime.  I have seen Sydney, I have seen London, and twenty great\r\nports, but \"- Peroo looked at the damp, discoloured shrine under\r\nthe peepul -\" never man has seen that we saw here.\"\r\n\r\nWhat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Has the Sahib forgotten; or do we black men only see the Gods?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a fever upon me.\" Findlayson was still looking\r\nuneasily across the water.  \"It seemed that the island was full\r\nof beasts and men talking, but I do not remember. A boat could\r\nlive in this water now, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oho! Then it is true. 'When Brahm ceases to dream, the Gods\r\ndie.' Now I know, indeed, what he meant. Once, too, the guru\r\nsaid as much to me; but then I did not understand. Now I am\r\nwise.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said Findlayson, over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nPeroo went on as if he were talking to himself \"Six - seven - ten\r\nmonsoons since, I was watch on the fo'c'sle of the Rewah - the\r\nKumpani's big boat - and there was a big tufan; green and black\r\nwater beating, and I held fast to the life-lines, choking under\r\nthe waters. Then I thought of the Gods - of Those whom we saw\r\nto-night \"- he stared curiously at Findlayson's back, but the\r\nwhite man was looking across the flood. \"Yes, I say of Those\r\nwhom we saw this night past, and I called upon Them to protect\r\nme. And while I prayed, still keeping my lookout, a big wave\r\ncame and threw me forward upon the ring of the great black\r\nbow-anchor, and the Rewah rose high and high, leaning towards\r\nthe left-hand side, and the water drew away from beneath her\r\nnose, and I lay upon my belly, holding the ring, and looking\r\ndown into those great deeps. Then I thought, even in the face of\r\ndeath: If I lose hold I die, and for me neither the Rewah nor my\r\nplace by the galley where the rice is cooked, nor Bombay, nor\r\nCalcutta,nor even London, will be any more for me. 'How shall I\r\nbe sure,' I said,  'that the Gods to whom I pray will abide at\r\nall?' This I thought, and the Rewah dropped her nose as a hammer\r\nfalls, and all the sea came in and slid me backwards along the\r\nfo'c'sle and over the break of the fo'c'sle, and I very badly\r\nbruised my shin against the donkey-engine: but I did not die,\r\nand I have seen the Gods.  They are good for live men, but for\r\nthe dead . . . .  They have spoken Themselves. Therefore, when I\r\ncome to the village I will beat the guru for talking riddles\r\nwhich are no riddles.  When Brahm ceases to dream the Gods go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look up-stream. The light blinds. Is there smoke yonder?\"\r\n\r\nPeroo shaded his eyes with his hands. \"He is a wise man and\r\nquick.  Hitchcock Sahib would not trust a rowboat.  He has\r\nborrowed the Rao Sahib's steam-launch, and comes to look for us.\r\nI have always said that there should have been a steam-launch on\r\nthe bridge works for us.\r\n\r\nThe territory of the Rao of Baraon lay within ten miles of the\r\nbridge; and Findlayson and Hitchcock had spent a fair portion of\r\ntheir scanty leisure in playing billiards and shooting blackbuck\r\nwith the young man.  He had been bearled by an English tutor of\r\nsporting tastes for some five or six years, and was now royally\r\nwasting the revenues accumulated during his minority by the\r\nIndian\r\nGovernment. His steam-launch, with its silver-plated rails,\r\nstriped silk awning, and mahogany decks, was a new toy which\r\nFindlayson had found horribly in the way when the Rao came to\r\nlook at the bridge works.\r\n\r\n\"It's great luck,\" murmured Findlayson, but he was none the less\r\nafraid, wondering what news might be of the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe gaudy blue-and-white funnel came downstream swiftly.  They\r\ncould see Hitchcock in the bows, with a pair of opera-glasses,\r\nand his face was unusually white. Then Peroo hailed, and the\r\nlaunch made for the tail of the island. The Rao Sahib, in tweed\r\nshooting-suit and a seven-hued turban, waved his royal hand, and\r\nHitchcock shouted. But he need have asked no questions, for\r\nFindlayson's first demand was for his bridge.\r\n\r\n\"All serene! 'Gad, I never expected to see you again, Findlayson.\r\nYou're seven koss downstream. Yes; there's not a stone shifted\r\nanywhere; but how are you? I borrowed the Rao Sahib's launch,\r\nand he was good enough to come along. Jump in.\"Ah, Finlinson,\r\nyou are very well, eh? That was most unprecedented calamity last\r\nnight, eh? My royal palace, too, it leaks like the devil, and\r\nthe crops will also be short all about my country. Now you shall\r\nback her out, Hitchcock. I - I do not understand steam-engines.\r\nYou are wet? You are cold, Finlinson? I have some things to eat\r\nhere, and you will take a good drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm immensely grateful, Rao Sahib. I believe you've saved my\r\nlife.  How did Hitchcock -\"\r\n\r\n\"Oho! His hair was upon end. He rode to me in the middle of the\r\nnight and woke me up in the arms of Morpheus. I was most truly\r\nconcerned, Finlinson, so I came too. My head-priest he is very\r\nangry just now. We will go quick, Mister Hitchcock. I am due to\r\nattend at twelve forty-five in the state temple, where we\r\nsanctify some new idol. If not so I would have asked you to\r\nspend the day with me. They are dam-bore, these religious\r\nceremonies, Finlinson, eh?\"\r\n\r\nPeroo, well known to the crew, had possessed himself of the\r\ninlaid wheel, and was taking the launch craftily up-stream. But\r\nwhile he steered he was, in his mind, handling two feet of\r\npartially untwisted wire-rope; and the back upon which he beat\r\nwas the back of his guru.\r\n\r\nEnd of THE BRIDGE-BUILDERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WALKING DELEGATE\r\n\r\nACCORDING to the custom of Vermont, Sunday afternoon is\r\nsalting-time on the farm, and, unless something very important\r\nhappens, we attend to the salting ourselves.  Dave and Pete, the\r\nred oxen, are treated first; they stay in the home meadow ready\r\nfor work on Monday.  Then come the cows, with Pan, the calf, who\r\nshould have been turned into veal long ago, but survived on\r\naccount of his manners; and lastly the horses, scattered through\r\nthe seventy acres of the Back Pasture.\r\n\r\nYou must go down by the brook that feeds the clicking, bubbling\r\nwater-ram; up through the sugar-bush, where the young maple\r\nundergrowth closes round you like a shallow sea; next follow the\r\nfaint line of an old county-road running past two green hollows\r\nfringed with wild rose that mark the cellars of two ruined\r\nhouses; then by Lost Orchard, where nobody ever comes except in\r\ncider-time; then across another brook, and so into the Back\r\nPasture.  Half of it is pine and hemlock and Spruce, with sumach\r\nand little juniper bushes, and the other half is grey rock and\r\nboulder and moss, with green streaks of brake and swamp; but the\r\nhorses like it well enough - our own, and the others that are\r\nturned down there to feed at fifty cents a week.  Most people\r\nwalk to the Back Pasture, and find it very rough work; but one\r\ncan get there in a buggy, if the horse knows what is expected of\r\nhim.  The safest conveyance is our coupe. This began life as a\r\nbuckboard, and we bought it for five dollars from a sorrowful man\r\nwho had no other sort of possessions; and the seat came off one\r\nnight when we were turning a corner in a hurry.  After that\r\nalteration it made a beautiful salting-machine, if you held\r\ntight, because there was nothing to catch your feet when you fell\r\nout, and the slats rattled tunes.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon we went out with the salt as usual.  It was\r\na broiling hot day, and we could not find the horses anywhere\r\ntill we let Tedda Gabler, the bobtailed mare who throws up the\r\ndirt with her big hooves exactly as a tedder throws hay, have\r\nher head.  Clever as she is, she tipped the coupe over in a\r\nhidden brook before she came out on a ledge of rock where all\r\nthe horses had gathered, and were switching flies. The Deacon\r\nwas the first to call to her.  He is a very dark iron-grey\r\nfour-year-old, son of Grandee. He has been handled since he was\r\ntwo, was driven in a light cart before he was three, and now\r\nranksas an absolutely steady lady's horse - proof against\r\nsteam-rollers, grade-crossings, and street processions.\r\n\r\n\"Salt!\" said the Deacon, joyfully.  \"You're dreffle late, Tedda.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any - any place to cramp the coupe?\" Tedda panted.  \"It weighs\r\nturr'ble this weather. I'd 'a' come sooner, but they didn't know\r\nwhat they wanted - ner haow. Fell out twice, both of 'em.  I\r\ndon't understand sech foolishness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You look consider'ble het up. 'Guess you'd better cramp her\r\nunder them pines, an' cool off a piece.\"\r\n\r\nTedda scrambled on the ledge, and cramped the coupe in the shade\r\nof a tiny little wood of pines, while my companion and I lay\r\ndown among the brown, silky needles, and gasped. All the home\r\nhorses were gathered round us, enjoying their Sunday leisure.\r\n\r\nThere were Rod and Rick, the seniors on the farm.  They were the\r\nregular road-pair, bay with black points, full brothers, aged,\r\nsons of a Hambletonian sire and a Morgan dam.  There were Nip\r\nand Tuck, seal-browns, rising six, brother and sister, Black\r\nHawks by birth, perfectly matched, just finishing their\r\neducation, and as handsome a pair as man could wish to find in a\r\nforty-mile drive.  There was Muldoon, our ex-car-horse, bought at\r\na venture, and any colour you choose that is not white; and\r\nTweezy, who comes from Kentucky, with an affliction of his left\r\nhip, which makes him a little uncertain how his hind legs are\r\nmoving.  He and Muldoon had been hauling gravel all the week for\r\nour new road.  The Deacon you know already.  Last of all, and\r\neating something, was our faithful Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, the\r\nblack buggy-horse, who had seen us through every state of weather\r\nand road, the horse who was always standing in harness before\r\nsome door or other - a philosopher with the appetite of a shark\r\nand the manners of an archbishop. Tedda Gabler was a new\r\n\"trade,\"with a reputation for vice which was really the result of\r\nbad driving.  She had one working gait, which she could hold till\r\nfurther notice; a Roman nose; a large, prominent eye; a\r\nshaving-brush of a tail; and an irritable temper.  She took her\r\nsalt through her bridle; but the others trotted up nuzzling and\r\nwickering for theirs, till we emptied it on the clean rocks.\r\nThey were all standing at ease, on three legs for the most part,\r\ntalking the ordinary gossip of the Back Pasture - about the\r\nscarcity of water, and gaps in the fence, and how the early\r\nwindfalls tasted that season - when little Rick blew the last few\r\ngrains of his allowance into a crevice, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Hurry, boys!  'Might ha' knowed that livery plug would be\r\naround.\"\r\n\r\nWe heard a clatter of hooves, and there climbed up from the\r\nravine below a fifty-center transient--a wall-eyed, yellow\r\nframe-house of a horse, sent up to board from a livery-stable in\r\ntown, where they called him \"The Lamb,\" and never let him out\r\nexcept at night and to strangers. My companion, who knew and had\r\nbroken most of the horses, looked at the ragged hammer-head as it\r\nrose, and said quietly:\r\n\r\n\"Ni-ice beast. Man-eater, if he gets the chance - see his eye.\r\nKicker, too - see his hocks.  Western horse.\"\r\n\r\nThe animal lumbered up, snuffling and grunting.  His feet showed\r\nthat he had not worked for weeks and weeks, and our creatures\r\ndrew together significantly.\r\n\r\n\"As usual,\" he said, with an underhung sneer-\"bowin' your heads\r\nbefore the Oppressor that comes to spend his leisure gloatin'\r\nover you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine's done,\" said the Deacon; he licked up the remnant of his\r\nsalt, dropped his nose in his master's hand, and sang a little\r\ngrace all to himself.  The Deacon has the most enchanting\r\nmanners of any one I know.\r\n\r\n\"An' fawnin' on them for what is your inalienable right. It's\r\nhumiliatin',\" said the yellow horse, sniffing to see if he could\r\nfind a few spare grains.\r\n\r\n\"Go daown hill, then, Boney,\" the Deacon replied.  \"Guess you'll\r\nfind somethin' to eat still, if yer hain't hogged it all. You've\r\nett more'n any three of us to-day - an' day 'fore that - an' the\r\nlast two months - sence you've been here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not addressin' myself to the young an' immature.  I am\r\nspeakin' to those whose opinion an' experience commands\r\nrespect.\"\r\n\r\nI saw Rod raise his head as though he were about to make a\r\nremark; then he dropped it again, and stood three-cornered, like\r\na plough-horse.  Rod can cover his mile in a shade under three\r\nminutes on an ordinary road to an ordinary buggy. He is\r\ntremendously powerful behind, but, like most Hambletonians, he\r\ngrows a trifle sullen as he gets older.  No one can love Rod\r\nvery much; but no one can help respecting him.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to wake those,\" the yellow horse went on, \"to an abidin'\r\nsense o' their wrongs an' their injuries an' their outrages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haow's that?\" said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, dreamily. He\r\nthought Boney was talking of some kind of feed.\r\n\r\n\"An' when I say outrages and injuries\" - Boney waved his tail\r\nfuriously  \"I mean 'em, too. Great Oats! That's just what I do\r\nmean, plain an' straight.\"\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman talks quite earnest,\" said Tuck, the mare, to Nip,\r\nher brother.There's no doubt thinkin' broadens the horizons o'\r\nthe mind. His language is quite lofty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hesh, sis,\" Nip answered.  \"He hain't widened nothin' 'cep' the\r\ncircle he's ett in pasture. They feed words fer beddin' where he\r\ncomes from.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's elegant talkin', though,\" Tuck returned, with an\r\nunconvinced toss of her pretty, lean little head.\r\n\r\nThe yellow horse heard her, and struck an attitude which he meant\r\nto be extremely impressive. It made him look as though he had\r\nbeen badly stuffed.\r\n\r\n\"Now I ask you, I ask you without prejudice an' without\r\nfavour,-what has Man the Oppressor ever done for you? - Are you\r\nnot inalienably entitled to the free air O' heaven, blowin'\r\nacrost this boundless prairie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hev ye ever wintered here?\" said the Deacon, merrily, while the\r\nothers snickered.  \"It's kinder cool.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" said Boney.  \"I come from the boundless confines o'\r\nKansas, where the noblest of our kind have their abidin'-place\r\namong the sunflowers on the threshold o' the settin' sun in his\r\nglory.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' they sent you ahead as a sample ~\" said Rick, with an amused\r\nquiver of his long, beautifully groomed tail, as thick and as\r\nfine and as wavy as a quadroon's back hair.\r\n\r\n\"Kansas, sir, needs no advertisement.  Her native sons rely on\r\nthemselves an' their native sires.  Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThen Tweezy lifted up his wise and polite old head.  His\r\naffliction makes him bashful as a rule, but he is ever the most\r\ncourteous of horses.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, suh,\" he said slowly, \"but, unless I have been\r\nmisinfohmed, most of your prominent siahs, suh, are impo'ted\r\nfrom Kentucky; an' I'm from Paduky.\"\r\n\r\nThere was the least little touch of pride in the last words.\r\n\r\n\"Any horse dat knows beans,\" said Muldoon, suddenly (he had been\r\nstanding with his hairy chin on Tweezy's broad quarters), \"gits\r\nouter Kansas 'fore dey crip his shoes.  I blew in dere from\r\nIoway in de days o' me youth an' innocence, an' I wuz grateful\r\nwhen dey boxed me fer N' York.  You can't tell me anything about\r\nKansas I don't wanter fergit.  De Belt Line stables ain't no\r\nHoffman House, but dey're Vanderbilts 'longside ' Kansas.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the horses o' Kansas think to-day, the horses of America\r\nwill think to-morrow; an' I tell you that when the horses of\r\nAmerica rise in their might, the day o' the Oppressor is ended.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, till Rick said, with a little grunt:\r\n\r\n\"Ef you put it that way, every one of us has riz in his might,\r\n'cep' Marcus, mebbe.  Marky, 'j ever rise in yer might?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope,\" said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, thoughtfully quidding\r\nover a mouthful of grass. \"I seen a heap o' fools try, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"You admit that you riz ~\" said the Kansas horse, excitedly.\r\n\"Then why - why in Kansas did you ever go under again?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Horse can't walk on his hind legs all the time,\" said the\r\nDeacon.\r\n\r\n\"Not when he's jerked over on his back 'fore he knows what\r\nfetched him. We've all done it, Boney,\" said Rick. \"Nip an' Tuck\r\nthey tried it, spite o' what the Deacon told 'em; an' the Deacon\r\nhe tried it, spite o' what me an' Rod told him; an' me an' Rod\r\ntried it, spite o' what Grandee told us; an' I guess Grandee he\r\ntried it, spite Oo' what his dam told him. It's the same old\r\ncircus from generation to generation. 'Colt can't see why he's\r\ncalled on to back. Same old rearm' on end - straight up. Same old\r\nfeelin' that you've bested 'em this time. Same old little yank at\r\nyour mouth when you're up good an' tall. Same old Pegasus-act,\r\nwonderin' where you'll 'light. Same old wop when you hit the dirt\r\nwith your head where your tail should be, and your in'ards shook\r\nup like a bran-mash. Same old voice in your ear: 'Waal, ye little\r\nfool, an' what did you reckon to make by that?' We're through\r\nwith risin in our might on this farm. We go to pole er single,\r\naccordin' ez we're hitched.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' Man the Oppressor sets an' gloats over you, same as he's\r\nsettin' now. Hain't that been your experience, madam?\"\r\n\r\nThis last remark was addressed to Tedda; and any one could see\r\nwith half an eye that poor, old anxious, fidgety Tedda, stamping\r\nat the flies, must have left a wild and tumultuous youth behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"'Pends on the man,\" she answered, shifting from one foot to the\r\nother, and addressing herself to the home horses. \"They abused\r\nme dreffle when I was young. I guess I was sperrity an' nervous\r\nsome, but they didn't allow for that.'Twas in Monroe County, Noo\r\nYork, an' sence then till I come here, I've run away with more\r\nmen than 'u'd fill a boardin'-house. Why, the man that sold me\r\nhere he says to the boss, s' he:  'Mind, now, I've warned you.\r\n'Twon't be none of my fault if she sheds you daown the road.\r\nDon't you drive her in a top-buggy, ner 'thout winkers,' s' he,\r\n'ner 'thought this bit ef you look to come home behind her.' 'N'\r\nthe fust thing the boss did was to git the top-buggy.\r\n\r\n\"Can't say as I like top-buggies,\" said Rick; \"they don't balance\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suit me to a ha'ar,\" said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.  \"Top-buggy\r\nmeans the baby's in behind, an' I kin stop while she gathers the\r\npretty flowers - yes, an' pick a maouthful, too. The women-folk\r\nall say I hev to be humoured, an' -I don't kerry things to the\r\nsweatin'-point.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Course I've no prejudice against a top-buggy s' long 's I can\r\nsee it,\" Tedda went on quickly. \"It's ha'f-seein' the pesky\r\nthing bobbin' an' balancn' behind the winkers gits on my nerves.\r\nThen the boss looked at the bit they'd sold with me, an' s' he:\r\n'Jiminy Christmas!  This 'u'd make a clothes-horse Stan' 'n end!'\r\nThen he gave me a plain bar bit, an' fitted it 's if there was\r\nsome feelin' to my maouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hain't ye got any, Miss Tedda?\" said Tuck, who has a mouth like\r\nvelvet, and knows it.\r\n\r\n\"Might 'a' had, Miss Tuck, but I've forgot. Then he give me an\r\nopen bridle,- my style's an open bridle - an' - I dunno as I\r\nought to tell this by rights -he -give - me - a kiss.\"\r\n\r\n\"My!\" said Tuck, \"I can't tell fer the shoes o' me what makes\r\nsome men so fresh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw, sis,\" said Nip, \"what's the sense in actin' so? You git a\r\nkiss reg'lar 's hitchin'-up time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you needn't tell, smarty,\" said Tuck, with a squeal and a\r\nkick.\r\n\r\n\"I'd heard o' kisses, o' course,\" Tedda went on, \"but they hadn't\r\ncome my way specially.  I don't mind tellin' I was that took\r\naback at that man's doin's he might ha' lit fire-crackers on my\r\nsaddle. Then we went out jest 's if a kiss was nothin', an' I\r\nwasn't three strides into my gait 'fore I felt the boss knoo his\r\nbusiness, an' was trustin' me. So I studied to please him, an'\r\nwhenever took the whip from the dash - a whip drives me plumb\r\ndistracted - an' the upshot was that - waal, I've come up the\r\nBack Pasture to-day, an' the coupe's tipped clear over twice, an'\r\nI've waited till 'twuz fixed each time. You kin judge for\r\nyourselves. I don't set up to be no better than my neighbours,-\r\nspecially with my tail snipped off the way 'tis,- but I want you\r\nall to know Tedda's quit fightin' in harness or out of it, 'cep'\r\nwhen there's a born fool in the pasture, stuffin' his stummick\r\nwith board that ain't rightly hisn, 'cause he hain't earned it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meanin' me, madam?\" said the yellow horse.\r\n\r\n \"Ef the shoe fits, clinch it,\" said Tedda, snorting. \"I named no\r\nnames, though, to be sure, some folks are mean enough an' greedy\r\nenough to do 'thout 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a deal to be forgiven to ignorance,\" said the yellow\r\nhorse, with an ugly look in his blue eye.\r\n\r\n\"Seemin'ly, yes; or some folks 'u'd ha' been kicked raound the\r\npasture 'bout onct a minute sence they came - board er no\r\nboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what you do not understand, if you will excuse me, madam, is\r\nthat the whole principle o' servitood, which includes keep an'\r\nfeed, starts from a radically false basis; an' I am proud to say\r\nthat me an' the majority o' the horses o' Kansas think the\r\nentire concern should be relegated to the limbo of exploded\r\nsuperstitions. I say we're too progressive for that. I say we're\r\ntoo enlightened for that. 'Twas good enough 's long 's we didn't\r\nthink, but naow - but naow - a new loominary has arisen on the\r\nhorizon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Meanin' you?\" said the Deacon.\r\n\r\n\"The horses o' Kansas are behind me with their multitoodinous\r\nthunderin' hooves, an' we say, simply but grandly, that we take\r\nour stand with all four feet on the inalienable rights of the\r\nhorse, pure and simple,- the high-toned child o' nature, fed by\r\nthe same wavin' grass, cooled by the same ripplin' brook-- yes,\r\nan' warmed by the same gen'rous sun as falls impartially on the\r\noutside an' the inside of the pampered machine o' the\r\ntrottin'-track, or the bloated coupe-horses o' these yere\r\nEastern cities. Are we not the same flesh an' blood?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not by a bushel an' a half,\" said the Deacon, under his breath.\r\n\"Grandee never was in Kansas.\"\r\n\r\n\"My! Ain't that elegant, though, abaout the wavin' grass an' the\r\nripplin' brooks?\" Tuck whispered in Nip's ear. \"The gentleman's\r\nreal convincin' I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say we are the same flesh an' blood! Are we to be separated,\r\nhorse from horse, by the artificial barriers of a\r\ntrottin'-record, or are we to look down upon each other on the\r\nstrength o' the gifts o' nature - an extry inch below the knee,\r\nor slightly more powerful quarters? What's the use o' them\r\nadvantages to you? Man the Oppressor comes along, an' sees\r\nyou're likely an' good-lookin', an' grinds you to the face o'\r\nthe earth. What for? For his own pleasure: for his own\r\nconvenience!  Young an' old, black an' bay, white an' grey,\r\nthere's no distinctions made between us.  We're ground up\r\ntogether under the remorseless teeth o' the engines of\r\noppression !\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess his breechin' must ha' broke goin' daown-hill,\" said the\r\nDeacon. \"Slippery road, maybe, an' the buggy come onter him, an'\r\nhe didn't know 'nough to hold back. That don't feel like teeth,\r\nthough. Maybe he busted a shaft, an' it pricked him.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' I come to you from Kansas, wavin' the tail o' friendship to\r\nall an' sundry, an' in the name of the uncounted millions o'\r\npure-minded, high-toned horses now strugglin' towards the light\r\no' freedom, I say to you, Rub noses with us in our sacred an'\r\nholy cause. The power is yourn. Without you, I say, Man the\r\nOppressor cannot move himself from place to place. Without you\r\nhe cannot reap, he cannot sow, he cannot plough.\"\r\n\r\nMighty odd place, Kansas!\" said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.\r\n\"Seemin'ly they reap in the spring an' plough in the fall.\r\n'Guess it's right fer them, but 'twould make me kinder giddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The produc's of your untirin' industry would rot on the ground\r\nif you did not weakly consent to help him. Let 'em rot, I say!\r\nLet him call you to the stables in vain an' nevermore! Let him\r\nshake his ensnarin' oats under your nose in vain! Let the\r\nBrahmas roost in the buggy, an' the rats run riot round the\r\nreaper! Let him walk on his two hind feet till they blame well\r\ndrop off! Win no more soul-destroyn' races for his pleasure!\r\nThen, an' not till then, will Man the Oppressor know where he's\r\nat. Quit workin', fellow-sufferers an' slaves! Kick! Rear!\r\nPlunge! Lie down on the shafts, an' woller! Smash an' destroy!\r\nThe conflict will be but short, an' the victory is certain.\r\nAfter that we can press our inalienable rights to eight quarts\r\no' oats a day, two good blankets, an' a fly-net an' the best o'\r\nstablin'.\"\r\n\r\nThe yellow horse shut his yellow teeth with a triumphant snap;\r\nand Tuck said, With a sigh:  'Seems's if somethin' ought to be\r\ndone. Don't seem right, somehow,- oppressin' us an all,- to my\r\nway o' thinkin'.\"\r\n\r\nSaid Muldoon, in a far-away and sleepy voice:\r\n\r\n\"Who in Vermont's goin' to haul de inalienable oats? Dey weigh\r\nlike Sam Hill, an' sixty bushel at dat allowance ain't goin' to\r\nlast t'ree weeks here. An' dere's de winter hay for five\r\nmont's!\"\r\n\r\n\"We can settle those minor details when the great cause is won,\"\r\nsaid the yellow horse. \"Let us return simply but grandly to our\r\ninalienable rights - the right o' freedom on these yere verdant\r\nhills, an' no invijjus distinctions o' track an' pedigree:\"\r\n\r\n\"What in stables 'jer call an invijjus distinction?\" said the\r\nDeacon, stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"Fer one thing, bein' a bloated, pampered trotter jest because\r\nyou happen to be raised that way, an' couldn't no more help\r\ntrottin' than eatin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do ye know anythin' about trotters?\" said the Deacon.\r\n\r\n\"I've seen 'em trot. That was enough for me. I don't want to know\r\nany more. Trottin' 's immoral.\"\r\n\r\n\"Waal, I'll tell you this much. They don't bloat, an' they don't\r\npamp - much. I don't hold out to be no trotter myself, though I\r\nam free to say I had hopes that way - onct. But I do say, fer\r\nI've seen 'em trained, that a trotter don't trot with his feet:\r\nhe trots with his head; an' he does more work - ef you know what\r\nthat is - in a week than you er your sire ever done in all your\r\nlives. He's everlastingly at it, a trotter is; an' when he\r\nisn't, he's studyin' haow. You seen 'em trot? Much you hev! You\r\nwas hitched to a rail, back o' the stand, in a buckboard with a\r\nsoap-box nailed on the slats, an' a frowzy buff'lo atop, while\r\nyour man peddled rum fer lemonade to little boys as thought they\r\nwas actin' manly, till you was both run off the track an' jailed\r\n-you intoed, shufflin', sway-backed, wind-suckin' skate, you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't get het up, Deacon,\" said Tweezy, quietly. \"Now, suh,\r\nwould you consider a fox-trot, an' single-foot, an' rack, an'\r\npace, an' amble, distinctions not worth distinguishin'? I assuah\r\nyou, gentlemen, there was a time befo' I was afflicted in my hip,\r\nif you'll pardon me, Miss Tuck, when I was quite celebrated in\r\nPaduky for all those gaits; an in my opinion the Deacon's co'rect\r\nwhen he says that a ho'se of any position in society gets his\r\ngaits by his haid, an' not by - his, ah, limbs, Miss Tuck. I\r\nreckon I'm very little good now, but I'm rememberin' the things I\r\nused to do befo' I took to transpo'tin' real estate with the help\r\nan' assistance of this gentleman here.\" He looked at Muldoon.\r\n\r\n\"Invijjus arterficial hind legs !\" said the ex-carhorse, with a\r\ngrunt of contempt. \"On de Belt Line we don't reckon no horse\r\nwuth his keep 'less he kin switch de car off de track, run her\r\nround on de cobbles, an' dump her in ag'in ahead o' de truck\r\nwhat's blockin' him. Dere is a way o' swingin' yer quarters when\r\nde driver says, 'Yank her out, boys!' dat takes a year to learn.\r\nOnct yer git onter it, youse kin yank a cable-car outer a\r\nmanhole.  I don't advertise myself for no circus-horse, but I\r\nknew dat trick better than most, an' dey was good to me in de\r\nstables, fer I saved time on de Belt - an' time's what dey hunt\r\nin N' York.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the simple child o' nature-\" the yellow horse began.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, go an' unscrew yer splints!  You're talkin' through yer\r\nbandages,\" said Muldoon, with a horse-laugh. \"Dere ain't no\r\nloose-box for de simple child o' nature on de Belt Line, wid de\r\nParis comin' in an' de Teutonic goin' out, an' de trucks an' de\r\ncoupe's sayin' things, an' de heavy freight movin' down fer de\r\nBoston boat 'bout t'ree o'clock of an August afternoon, in de\r\nmiddle of a hot wave when de fat Kanucks an' Western horses\r\ndrops dead on de block. De simple child o' nature had better\r\nchase himself inter de water. Every man at de end of his lines\r\nis mad or loaded or silly, an' de cop's madder an' loadeder an'\r\nsillier than de rest. Dey all take it outer de horses. Dere's no\r\nwavin' brooks ner ripplin' grass on de Belt Line. Run her out on\r\nde cobbles wid de sparks flyin', an' stop when de cop slugs you\r\non de bone o' yer nose.  Dat's N'York; see?\r\n\r\n\"I was always told s'ciety in Noo York was dreffle refined an'\r\nhigh-toned,\" said Tuck. \"We're lookin' to go there one o' these\r\ndays, Nip an' me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you won't see no Belt business where you'll go, miss. De man\r\ndat wants you'll want bad, an' he'll summer you on Long Island\r\ner at Newport, wid a winky-pinky silver harness an' an English\r\ncoachman. You'll make a star-hitch, you an' yer brother, miss.\r\nBut I guess you won't have no nice smooth bar bit. Dey checks\r\n'em, an' dey bangs deir tails, an' dey bits 'em, de city folk,\r\nan' dey says it's English, ye know, an' dey darsen't cut a horse\r\nloose 'ca'se o' de cops. N' York's no place fer a horse, 'less\r\nhe's on de Belt, an' can go round wid de boys. Wisht I was in de\r\nFire Department!\"\r\n\r\n\"But did you never stop to consider the degradin' servitood of it\r\nall?\" said the yellow horse.\r\n\r\n\"You don't stop on de Belt, cully.  You're stopped. An' we was\r\nall in de servitood business, man an' horse, an' Jimmy dat sold\r\nde papers. Guess de passengers weren't out to grass neither, by\r\nde way dey acted. I done my turn, an' I'm none o' Barnum's\r\ncrowd; but any horse dat's worked on de Belt four years don't\r\ntrain wid no simple child o' nature - not by de whole length o'\r\nN' York.\"\r\n\r\n\"But can it be possible that with your experience, and at your\r\ntime of life, you do not believe that all horses are free and\r\nequal?\" said the yellow horse.\"Not till they're dead,\" Muldoon\r\nanswered quietly. \"An' den it depends on de gross total o'\r\nbuttons an' mucilage dey gits outer youse at Barren Island.\"\r\n\r\n\"They tell me you're a prominent philosopher.\" The yellow horse\r\nturned to Marcus. \"Can you deny a basic and pivotal statement\r\nsuch as this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't deny anythin',\" said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus,\r\ncautiously; \"but ef you ast me, I should say 'twuz more\r\ndifferent sorts o' clipped oats of a lie than anythin' I've had\r\nmy teeth into sence I wuz foaled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you a horse?\" said the yellow horse.\r\n\r\n\"Them that knows me best 'low I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ain't I a horse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yep; one kind of\"\"Then ain't you an' me equal?\"\r\n\r\n\"How fer kin you go in a day to a loaded buggy, drawin' five\r\nhundred pounds?\" Marcus asked carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"That has nothing to do with the case,\" the yellow horse answered\r\nexcitedly.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing I know hez more to do with the case,\" Marcus\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"Kin ye yank a full car outer de tracks ten times in de mornin'?\"\r\nsaid Muldoon.\r\n\r\n\"Kin ye go to Keene - forty-two mile in an afternoon - with a\r\nmate,\" said Rick; \"an' turn out bright an' early next mornin'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Was there evah any time in your careah, suh - I am not referrin'\r\nto the present circumstances, but our mutual glorious past -\r\nwhen you could carry a pretty girl to market hahnsome, an' let\r\nher knit all the way on account o' the smoothness o' the\r\nmotion?\" said Tweezy.\r\n\r\n\"Kin you keep your feet through the West River Bridge, with the\r\nnarrer-gage comin' in on one side, an' the Montreal flyer the\r\nother, an' the old bridge teeterin' between?\" said the Deacon.\r\n\"Kin you put your nose down on the cow-catcher of a locomotive\r\nwhen you're waitin' at the depot an' let 'em play 'Curfew shall\r\nnot ring to-night' with the big brass bell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kin you hold back when the brichin' breaks? Kin you stop fer\r\norders when your nigh hind leg's over your trace an' ye feel\r\ngood of a frosty mornin'?\" said Nip, who had only learned that\r\ntrick last winter, and thought it was the crown of horsely\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\"What's the use o' talk in'?\" said Tedda Gabler, scornfully.\r\n\"What kin ye do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I rely on my simple rights - the inalienable rights o' my\r\nunfettered horsehood. An' I am proud to say I have never, since\r\nmy first shoes, lowered myself to obeyin' the will o' man.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Must ha' had a heap o' whips broke over yer yaller back,\" said\r\nTedda.  \"Hev ye found it paid any?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorrer has been my portion since the day I was foaled.  Blows\r\nan' boots an' whips an' insults - injury, outrage, an'\r\noppression. I would not endoor the degradin' badges o' servitood\r\nthat connect us with the buggy an' the farm-wagon.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's amazin' difficult to draw a buggy 'thout traces er collar\r\ner breast-strap er somefin',\" said Marcus. \"A Power-machine for\r\nsawin' wood is most the only thing there's no straps to. I've\r\nhelped saw 's much as three cord in an afternoon in a\r\nPower-machine. Slep', too, most o' the time, I did; but 'tain't\r\nhalf as interestin' ez goin' daown-taown in the Concord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Concord don't hender you goin' to sleep any,\" said Nip.  \"My\r\nthroat-lash! D'you remember when you lay down in the sharves\r\nlast week, waitin' at the piazza?\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! That didn't hurt the sharves. They wuz good an' wide, an'\r\nI lay down keerful.  The folks kep' me hitched up nigh an hour\r\n'fore they started; an' larfed - why, they all but lay down\r\nthemselves with larfin'. Say, Boney, if you've got to be hitched\r\nto anything that goes on wheels, you've got to be hitched with\r\nsomefin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go an' jine a circus,\" said Muldoon, \"an' walk on your hind\r\nlegs.  All de horses dat knows too much to work [he pronounced it\r\n\"woik,\" New York fashion] jine de circus.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not sayin' anythin' again' work,\" said the yellow horse;\r\n\"work is the finest thing in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Seems too fine fer some of us,\" Tedda snorted.\r\n\r\n\"I only ask that each horse should work for himself, an' enjoy\r\nthe profit of his labours. Let him work intelligently, an' not\r\nas a machine.\"\r\n\r\n\"There ain't no horse that works like a machine,\" Marcus began.\r\n\r\n\"There's no way o' workin' that doesn't mean goin' to pole er\r\nsingle - they never put me in the Power-machine - er under\r\nsaddle,\" said Rick.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shucks!  We're talkin' same ez we graze,\" said Nip, \"raound\r\nan' raound in circles Rod, we hain't heard from you yet, an'\r\nyou've more know-how than any span here.\"\r\n\r\nRod, the off-horse of the pair, had been standing with one hip\r\nlifted, like a tired cow; and you could only tell by the quick\r\nflutter of the haw across his eye, from time to time, that he\r\nwas paying any attention to the argument. He thrust his jaw out\r\nsidewise, as his habit is when he pulls, and changed his leg.\r\nHis voice was hard and heavy, and his ears were close to his\r\nbig, plain Hambletonian head.\r\n\r\n\"How old are you?\" he said to the yellow horse.\r\n\r\n\"Nigh thirteen, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mean age; ugly age; I'm gettin' that way myself. How long hev ye\r\nbeen pawin' this firefanged stable-litter?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean my principles, I've held 'em sence I was three.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mean age; ugly age; teeth give heaps o' trouble then. 'Set a\r\ncolt to actin' crazy fer a while. You've kep' it up, seemin'ly.\r\nD'ye talk much to your neighbours fer a steady thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I uphold the principles o' the Cause wherever I am pastured.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Done a heap o' good, I guess?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am proud to say I have taught a few of my companions the\r\nprinciples o' freedom an' liberty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meanin' they ran away er kicked when they got the chanst?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was talkin' in the abstrac', an' not in the concrete.  My\r\nteachin's educated them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a horse, specially a young horse, hears in the abstrac',\r\nhe's liable to do in the Concord. You was handled late, I\r\npresoom.\"\r\n\r\nFour, risin' five.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's where the trouble began. Driv' by a woman, like ez not -\r\neh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not fer long,\" said the yellow horse, with a snap of his teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Spilled her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I heerd she never drove again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any childern?\"\r\n\r\n\"Buckboards full of 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Men too?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have shed conside'ble men in my time.\"\r\n\r\n\"By kickin'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any way that come along. Fallin' back over the dash is as handy\r\nas most.\"\r\n\r\n\"They must be turr'ble afraid o' you daowntaown?\"\r\n\r\n\"They've sent me here to get rid o' me. I guess they spend their\r\ntime talkin' over my campaigns.\"\"I wanter know!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Now, all you gentlemen have asked me what I can do.\r\nI'll just show you. See them two fellers lyin' down by the\r\nbuggy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yep; one of 'em owns me. T'other broke me,\" said Rod.\r\n\r\n\"Get 'em out here in the open, an' I'll show you something. Lemme\r\nhide back o' you peoples, so 's they won't see what I'm at.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meanin' ter kill 'em?\" Rod drawled. There was a shudder of\r\nhorror through the others; but the yellow horse never noticed.\r\n\r\n\"I'll catch 'em by the back o' the neck, an' pile-drive 'em a\r\npiece. They can suit 'emselves about livin' when I'm through\r\nwith 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Shouldn't wonder ef they did,\" said Rod. The yellow horse had\r\nhidden himself very cleverly behind the others as they stood in\r\na group, and was swaying his head close to the ground with a\r\ncurious scythe-like motion, looking side-wise out of his wicked\r\neyes.  You can never mistake a man-eater getting ready to knock\r\na man down. We had had one to pasture the year before.\r\n\r\n\"See that?\" said my companion, turning over on the pine-needles.\r\n\"Nice for a woman walking 'cross lots, wouldn't it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring 'em out!\" said the yellow horse, hunching his sharp back.\r\n\"There's no chance among them tall trees. Bring out the - oh!\r\nOuch!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a right-and-left kick from Muldoon.  I had no idea that\r\nthe old car-horse could lift so quickly. Both blows caught the\r\nyellow horse full and fair in the ribs, and knocked the breath\r\nout of him.\r\n\r\n\"What's that for?\" he said angrily, when he recovered himself;\r\nbut I noticed he did not draw any nearer to Muldoon than was\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nMuldoon never answered, but discoursed to himself in the whining\r\ngrunt that he uses when he is going down-hill in front of a\r\nheavy load. We call it singing; but I think it's something much\r\nworse, really. The yellow horse blustered and squealed a little,\r\nand at last said that, if it was a horse-fly that had stung\r\nMuldoon, he would accept an apology.\r\n\r\n\"You'll get it,\" said Muldoon, \"in de sweet by-and-bye - all de\r\napology you've any use for. Excuse me interruptin' you, Mr. Rod,\r\nbut I'm like Tweezy - I've a Southern drawback in me hind legs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Naow, I want you all here to take notice, an' you'll learn\r\nsomething,\" Rod went on. \"This yaller-backed skate comes to our\r\npastur'-\"\r\n\r\n\"Not havin' paid his board,\" put in Tedda.\r\n\r\n\"Not havin' earned his board, an' talks smooth to us abaout\r\nripplin' brooks an' wavin' grass, an' his high-toned,\r\npure-souled horsehood, which don't hender him sheddin' women an'\r\nchildern, an' fallin' over the dash onter men. You heard his\r\ntalk, an' you thought it mighty fine, some o' you.\"\r\n\r\nTuck looked guilty here, but she did not say anything.\r\n\r\n\"Bit by bit he goes on ez you have heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was talkin' in the abstrac',\" said the yellow horse, in an\r\naltered voice.\r\n\r\n\"Abstrac' be switched! Ez I've said, it's this yer blamed\r\nabstrac' business that makes the young uns cut up in the\r\nConcord; an' abstrac' or no abstrac', he crep' on an' on till he\r\ncome to killin' plain an' straight - killin' them as never done\r\nhim no harm, jest beca'se they owned horses.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' knowed how to manage 'em,\" said Tedda. That makes it worse.\"\r\n\r\nWaal, he didn't kill 'em, anyway,\" said Marcus. \"He'd ha' been\r\nhalf killed ef he had tried.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Makes no differ,\" Rod answered. \"He meant to; an' ef he hadn't\r\n- s'pose we want the Back Pasture turned into a biffin'-ground\r\non our only day er rest? 'S'pose we want our men walkin' round\r\nwith bits er lead pipe an' a twitch, an' their hands full o'\r\nstones to throw at us, same 's if we wuz hogs er hooky keows?\r\nMore'n that, leavin' out Tedda here - an' I guess it's more her\r\nmaouth than her manners stands in her light -there ain't a horse\r\non this farm that ain't a woman's horse, an' proud of it. An'\r\nthis yer bogspavined Kansas sunflower goes up an' daown the\r\nlength o' the country, traded off an' traded on, boastin' as\r\nhe's shed women --an' childern. I don't say as a woman in a buggy\r\nain't a fool. I don't say as she ain't the lastin'est kind er\r\nfool, ner I don't say a child ain't worse - spattin' the lines\r\nan' standin' up an' hollerin' - but I do say, 'tain't none of\r\nour business to shed 'em daown the road.\"\"We don't,\" said the\r\nDeacon. \"The baby tried to git some o' my tail for a sooveneer\r\nlast fall when I was up to the haouse, an' I didn't kick. Boney's\r\ntalk ain't goin' to hurt us any. We ain't colts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thet's what you think Bimeby you git into a tight corner,\r\n'Lection day er Valley Fair, like 's not, daown-taown, when\r\nyou're all het an' lathery, an' pestered with flies, an'\r\nthirsty, an' sick o' bein' worked in an aout 'tween buggies.\r\nThen somethin' whispers inside o' your winkers, bringin' up all\r\nthat talk abaout servitood an' inalienable truck an' sech like,\r\nan' jest then a Militia gun goes off; er your wheels hit, an' -\r\nwaal, you're only another horse ez can't be trusted. I've been\r\nthere time an' again. Boys - fer I've seen you all bought er\r\nbroke - on my solemn repitation fer a three-minute clip, I ain't\r\ngivin' you no bran-mash o' my own fixin'. I'm tellin' you my\r\nexperiences, an' I've had ez heavy a load an' ez high a check 's\r\nany horse here. I wuz born with a splint on my near fore ez big\r\n's a walnut, an' the cussed, three-cornered Hambletonian temper\r\nthat sours up an' curdles daown ez you git older. I've favoured\r\nmy splint; even little Rick he don't know what it's cost me to\r\nkeep my end up sometimes; an' I've fit my temper in stall an'\r\nharness, hitched up an' at pasture, till the sweat trickled off\r\nmy hooves, an' they thought I wuz off condition, an' drenched\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"When my affliction came,\" said Tweezy, gently, \"I was very near\r\nto losin' my manners. Allow me to extend to you my sympathy,\r\nsuh.\"\r\n\r\nRick said nothing, but he looked at Rod curiously. Rick is a\r\nsunny-tempered child who never bears malice, and I don't think\r\nhe quite understood. He gets his temper from his mother, as a\r\nhorse should.\r\n\r\n\"I've been there too, Rod,\" said Tedda. \"Open confession's good\r\nfor the soul, an' all Monroe County knows I've had my\r\nexperriences.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if you will excuse me, suh, that pusson\"-Tweezy looked\r\nunspeakable things aat the yellow horse - \"that pusson who has\r\ninsulted our intelligences comes from Kansas. An' what a ho'se\r\nof his position, an' Kansas at that, says cannot, by any stretch\r\nof the halter, concern gentlemen of our position. There's no\r\nshadow of equal'ty, suh, not even for one kick. He's beneath our\r\ncontempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him talk,\" said Marcus. \"It's always interestin' to know\r\nwhat another horse thinks. It don't tech us.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' he talks so, too,\" said Tuck. \"I've never heard anythin' so\r\nsmart for a long time.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Rod stuck out his jaws sidewise, and went on slowly, as\r\nthough he were slugging on a plain bit at the end of a\r\nthirty-mile drive:\r\n\r\n\"I want all you here ter understand thet ther ain't no Kansas,\r\nner no Kentucky, ner yet no Vermont, in our business. There's\r\njest two kind o' horse in the United States-them ez can an' will\r\ndo their work after bein' properly broke an' handled, an' them as\r\nwon't. I'm sick an' tired o' this everlastin' tail-switchin' an'\r\nwickerin' abaout one State er another. A horse kin be proud o'\r\nhis State, an' swap lies abaout it in stall or when he's hitched\r\nto a block, ef he keers to put in fly-time that way; but he\r\nhain't no right to let that pride o' hisn interfere with his\r\nwork, ner to make it an excuse fer claimin' he's different.\r\nThat's colts' talk, an' don't you fergit it, Tweezy. An',\r\nMarcus,you remember that hem' a philosopher, an' anxious to save\r\ntrouble,- fer you ate,- don't excuse you from jumpin' with all\r\nyour feet on a slack-jawed, crazy clay-bank like Boney here. It's\r\nleavin' 'em alone that gives 'em their chance to ruin colts an'\r\nkill folks. An', Tuck, waal, you're a mare anyways - but when a\r\nhorse comes along an' covers up all his talk o' killin' with\r\nripplin' brooks, an wavin grass, an' eight quarts of oats a day\r\nfree, after killn' his man, don't you be run away with by his\r\nyap. You're too young an' too nervous.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll - I'll have nervous prostration sure ef there's a fight\r\nhere,\" said Tuck, who saw what was in Rod's eye; \"I'm - I'm that\r\nsympathetic I'd run away clear to next caounty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yep; I know that kind o' sympathy. Jest lasts long enough to\r\nstart a fuss, an' then lights aout to make new trouble. I hain't\r\nbeen ten years in harness fer nuthin'. Naow, we're goin' to keep\r\nschool with Boney fer a spell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, look a-here, you ain't goin' to hurt me, are you?\r\nRemember, I belong to a man in town,\" cried the yellow horse,\r\nuneasily. Muldoon kept behind him so that he could not run away.\r\n\r\n\"I know it. There must be some pore delooded fool in this State\r\nhez a right to the loose end o' your hitchin'-strap.  I'm blame\r\nsorry fer him, but he shall hev his rights when we're through\r\nwith you,\" said Rod.\r\n\r\nIf it's all the same, gentlemen, I'd ruther change pasture.\r\n'Guess I'll do it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Can't always have your 'druthers. 'Guess you won't,\" said Rod.\r\n\r\n\"But look a-here. All of you ain't so blame unfriendly to a\r\nstranger.  S'pose we count noses.\"\r\n\r\n\"What in Vermont fer?\" said Rod, putting up his eyebrows. The\r\nidea of settling a question by counting noses is the very last\r\nthing that ever enters the head of a well-broken horse.\r\n\r\n\"To see how many's on my side.  Here's Miss Tuck, anyway; an'\r\nColonel Tweezy yonder's neutral; an' Judge Marcus, an' I guess\r\nthe Reverend [the yellow horse meant the Deacon] might see that\r\nI had my rights.  He's the likeliest-lookin' Trotter I've ever\r\nset eyes on.  Pshaw. Boys. You ain't goin' to pound me, be\r\nyouyou?  Why, we've gone round in pasture, all colts together,\r\nthis month ' Sundays, hain't we, as friendly as could be. There\r\nain't a horse alive I don't care who he is - has a higher\r\nopinion o' you, Mr. Rod, than I have.  Let's do it fair an' true\r\nan' above the exe.  Let's count noses same 's they do in\r\nKansas.\"  Here he dropped his voice a little and turned to\r\nMarcus: \"Say, Judge, there's some green food I know, back o' the\r\nbrook, no one hain't touched yet. After this little fracas is\r\nfixed up, you an' me'll make up a party an' 'tend to it.\"Marcus\r\ndid not answer for a long time, then he said:  \"There's a pup up\r\nto the haouse 'bout eight weeks old. He'll yap till he gits a\r\nlickin', an' when he sees it comin' he lies on his back, an'\r\nyowls. But he don't go through no cirkituous nose-countin' first.\r\nI've seen a noo light sence Rod spoke. You'll better stand up to\r\nwhat's served. I'm goin' to philosophise all over your carcass.\"\r\n\r\nI'm goin' to do yer up in brown paper,\" said Muldoon.  \"I can fit\r\n\r\nyou on apologies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on.  Ef we all biffed you now, these same men you've been\r\nso dead anxious to kill 'u'd call us off. 'Guess we'll wait till\r\nthey go back to the haouse, an' you'll have time to think cool\r\nan' quiet,\" said Rod.\r\n\r\n\"Have you no respec' whatever fer the dignity o' our common\r\nhorsehood?\" the yellow horse squealed.\r\n\r\n\"Nary respec' onless the horse kin do something. America's paved\r\nwith the kind er horse you are -jist plain yaller-dog horse -\r\nwaitin' ter be whipped inter shape. We call 'em yearlings an'\r\ncolts when they're young.  When they're aged we pound 'em - in\r\nthis pastur'.  Horse, sonny, is what you start from.  We know all\r\nabout horse here, an' he ain't any high-toned, pure souled child\r\no' nature. Horse, plain horse, same ez you, is chock-full o'\r\ntricks, an' meannesses, an' cussednesses, an' shirkin's, an'\r\nmonkey-shines, which he's took over from his sire an' his dam,\r\nan' thickened up with his own special fancy in the way o' goin'\r\ncrooked. Thet's horse, an' thet's about his dignity an' the size\r\nof his soul 'fore he's been broke an' rawhided a piece. Now we\r\nain't goin' to give ornery unswitched horse, that hain't done\r\nnawthin' wuth a quart of oats sence he wuz foaled, pet names\r\nthat would be good enough fer Nancy Hanks, or Alix, or Directum,\r\nwho hev. Don't you try to back off acrost them rocks. Wait where\r\nyou are! Ef I let my Hambletonian temper git the better o' me I'd\r\nfrazzle you out finer than rye-straw inside o' three minutes, you\r\nwoman-scarin', kid-killin', dash-breakin', unbroke, unshod,\r\nungaited, pastur'-hoggin', saw-backed, shark-mouthed,\r\nhair-trunk-thrown-in-in-trade son of a bronco an' a\r\nsewin'-machine!\"\r\n\r\n\" I think we'd better get home,\" I said to my companion, when Rod\r\nhad finished; and we climbed into the coupe, Tedda whinnying, as\r\nwe bumped over the ledges: \"Well, I'm dreffle sorry I can't stay\r\nfer the sociable; but I hope an' trust my friends'll take a\r\nticket fer me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bet your natchul!\" said Muldoon, cheerfully, and the horses\r\nscattered before us, trotting into the ravine.\r\n\r\nNext morning we sent back to the livery-stable what was left of\r\nthe yellow horse.  It seemed tired, but anxious to go.\r\n\r\nEnd of \"A WALKING DELEGATE\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF\r\n\r\nIt was her first voyage, and though she was but a cargo-steamer\r\nof twenty-five hundred tons, she was the very best of her kind,\r\nthe outcome of forty years of experiments and improvements in\r\nframework and machinery; and her designers and owner thought as\r\nmuch of her as though she had been the Lucania. Any one can make\r\na floating hotel that will pay expenses, if he puts enough money\r\ninto the saloon, and charges for private baths, suites of rooms,\r\nand such like; but in these days of competition and low freights\r\nevery square inch of a cargo-boat must be built for cheapness,\r\ngreat hold-capacity, and a certain steady speed. This boat was,\r\nperhaps, two hundred and forty feet long and thirty-two feet\r\nwide, with arrangements that enabled her to carry cattle on her\r\nmain and sheep on her upper deck if she wanted to; but her great\r\nglory was the amount of cargo that she could store away in her\r\nholds. Her owners -they were a very well known Scotch firm came\r\nround with her from the north, where she had been launched and\r\nchristened and fitted, to Liverpool, where she was to take cargo\r\nfor New York; and the owner's daughter, Miss Frazier, went to and\r\nfro on the clean decks, admiring the new paint and the brass\r\nwork, and the patent winches, and particularly the strong,\r\nstraight bow, over which she had cracked a bottle of champagne\r\nwhen she named the steamer the Dimbula.  It was a beautiful\r\nSeptember afternoon, and the boat in all her newness  she was\r\npainted lead-colour with a red funnel - looked very fine indeed.\r\nHer house-flag was flying, and her whistle from time to time\r\nacknowledged the salutes of friendly boats, who saw that she was\r\nnew to the High and Narrow Seas and wished to make her welcome.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Miss Frazier, delightedly, to the captain, \"she's\r\na real ship, isn't she?  It seems only the other day father gave\r\nthe order for her, and now - and now - isn't she a beauty!\" The\r\ngirl was proud of the firm, and talked as though she were the\r\ncontrolling partner.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she's no so bad,\" the skipper replied cautiously.  \"But I'm\r\nsayin' that it takes more than christenin' to mak' a ship. In\r\nthe nature o' things, Miss Frazier, if ye follow me, she's just\r\nirons and rivets and plates put into the form of a ship. She has\r\nto find herself yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought father said she was exceptionally well found.\"\"So she\r\nis, said the skipper, with a laugh. \"But it's this way wi'\r\nships, Miss Frazier.  She's all here, but the parrts of her have\r\nnot learned to work together yet. They've had no chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"The engines are working beautifully. I can hear them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed. But there's more than engines to a ship.  Every\r\ninch of her, ye'll understand, has to be livened up and made to\r\nwork wi' its neighbour - sweetenin' her, we call it,\r\ntechnically.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how will you do it?\" the girl asked.\r\n\r\n\"We can no more than drive and steer her and so forth; but if we\r\nhave rough weather this trip - it's likely - she'll learn the\r\nrest by heart!  For a ship, ye'll obsairve, Miss Frazier, is in\r\nno sense a reegid body closed at both ends. She's a highly\r\ncomplex structure o' various an' conflictin' strains, wi'\r\ntissues that must give an' tak' accordin' to her personal\r\nmodulus of elasteecity.\"  Mr. Buchanan, the chief engineer, was\r\ncoming towards them. \"I'm sayin' to Miss Frazier, here, that our\r\nlittle Dimbula has to be sweetened yet, and nothin' but a gale\r\nwill do it.  How's all wi'  your engines, Buck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well enough - true by plumb an' rule, o' course; but there's no\r\nspontaneeity yet.\"  He turned to the girl. \"Take my word, Miss\r\nFrazier, and maybe ye'll comprehend later; even after a pretty\r\ngirl's christened a ship it does not follow that there's such a\r\nthing as a ship under the men  that work her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was sayin' the very same, Mr. Buchanan,\" the skipper\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\"That's more metaphysical than I can follow,\" said Miss Frazier,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\"Why so?  Ye're good Scotch, an'- I knew your mother's father, he\r\nwas fra' Dumfries - ye've a vested right in metapheesics, Miss\r\nFrazier, just as ye have in the Dimbula,\" the engineer said.\r\n\r\n\"Eh, well, we must go down to the deep watters, an' earn Miss\r\nFrazier her deevidends.  Will you not come to my cabin for tea?\"\r\nsaid the skipper.  \"We'll be in dock the night, and when you're\r\ngoin' back to Glasgie ye can think of us loadin' her down an'\r\ndrivin' her forth - all for your sake.\"\r\n\r\nIn the next few days they stowed some four thousand tons\r\ndead-weight into the Dimbula, and took her out from Liverpool.\r\nAs soon as she met the lift of the open water, she naturally\r\nbegan to talk.  If you lay your ear to the side of the cabin,\r\nthe next time you are in a steamer, you will hear hundreds of\r\nlittle voices in every direction, thrilling and buzzing, and\r\nwhispering and popping, and gurgling and sobbing and squeaking\r\nexactly like a telephone in a thunder-storm.  Wooden ships\r\nshriek and growl and grunt, but iron vessels throb and quiver\r\nthrough all their hundreds of ribs and thousands of rivets. The\r\nDimbula was very strongly built, and every piece of her had a\r\nletter or a number, or both, to describe it; and every piece had\r\nbeen hammered, or forged, or rolled, or punched by man, and had\r\nlived in the roar and rattle of the shipyard for months.\r\nTherefore, every piece had its own separate voice, in exact\r\nproportion to the amount of trouble spent upon it.  Cast-iron, as\r\na rule, says very little; but mild steel plates and\r\nwrought-iron, and ribs and beams that have been much bent and\r\nwelded and riveted, talk continuously.  Their conversation, of\r\ncourse, is not half as wise as our human talk, because they are\r\nall, though they do not know it, bound down one to the other in\r\na black darkness, where they cannot tell what is happening near\r\nthem, nor what will overtake them next.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had cleared the Irish coast, a sullen, grey-headed\r\nold wave of the Atlantic climbed leisurely over her straight\r\nbows, and sat down on the steam-capstan used for hauling up the\r\nanchor.  Now the capstan and the engine that drove it had been\r\nnewly painted red and green; besides which, nobody likes being\r\nducked.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you do that again,\" the capstan sputtered through the\r\nteeth of his cogs.  \"Hi! Where's the fellow gone?\"\r\n\r\nThe wave had slouched overside with a plop and a chuckle; but\r\n\"Plenty more where he came from,\" said a brother-wave, and went\r\nthrough and over the capstan, who was bolted firmly to an iron\r\nplate on the iron deck-beams below.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you keep still up there?\" said the deckbeams.  \"What's the\r\nmatter with you?  One minute you weigh twice as much as you\r\nought to, and the next you don't!\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't my fault,\" said the capstan. \"There's a green brute\r\noutside that comes and hits me on the head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell that to the shipwrights. You've been in position for months\r\nand you've never wriggled like this before.  If you aren't\r\ncareful you'll strain us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talking of strain,\" said a low, rasping, unpleasant voice, are\r\nany of you fellows - you deck-beams, we mean - aware that those\r\nexceedingly ugly knees of yours happen to be riveted into our\r\nstructure - ours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who might you be?\" the deck-beams inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nobody in particular,\" was the answer. \"We're only the port\r\nand starboard upper-deck stringers; and if you persist in\r\nheaving and hiking like this, we shall be reluctantly compelled\r\nto take steps.\"\r\n\r\nNow the stringers of the ship are long iron girders, so to speak,\r\nthat run lengthways from stern to bow. They keep the iron frames\r\n(what are called ribs in a wooden ship) in place, and also help\r\nto hold the ends of the deck-beams, which go from side to side of\r\nthe ship.  Stringers always consider themselves most important,\r\nbecause they are so long.\r\n\r\n\"You will take steps - will you?\"  This was a long echoing\r\nrumble.  It came from the frames - scores and scores of them,\r\neach one about eighteen inches  distant from the next, and each\r\nriveted to the stringers in four places. \"We think you will have\r\na certain amount of trouble in that\"; and thousands and\r\nthousands of the little rivets that held everything together\r\nwhispered: \"You  Will! You will! Stop quivering and be quiet.\r\nHold on, brethren! Hold on! Hot Punches! What's that?\"\r\n\r\nRivets have no teeth, so they cannot chatter with fright; but\r\nthey did their best as a fluttering jar swept along the ship\r\nfrom stern to bow, and she shook like a rat in a terrier's\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nAn unusually severe pitch, for the sea was rising, had lifted the\r\nbig throbbing screw nearly to the surface, and it was spinning\r\nround in a kind of soda-water - half sea and half air - going\r\nmuch faster than was proper, because there was no deep water for\r\nit to work in.  As it sank again, the engines - and they were\r\ntriple expansion, three cylinders in a row - snorted through all\r\ntheir three pistons. \"Was that a joke, you fellow outside?It's an\r\nuncommonly poor one. How are we to do our work if you fly off the\r\n\r\nhandle that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't fly off the handle,\" said the screw, twirling huskily\r\nat the end of the screw-shaft. \"If I had, you'd have been\r\nscrap-iron by this time. The sea dropped away from under me, and\r\nI had nothing to catch on to.  That's all.\"\r\n\r\nThat's all, d'you call it?\" said the thrust-block, whose\r\nbusiness it is to take the push of the screw; for if a screw had\r\nnothing to hold it back it would crawl right into the\r\nengine-room.  (It is the holding back of the screwing action\r\nthat gives the drive to a ship.)  \"I know I do my work deep down\r\nand out of sight, but I warn you I expect justice. All I ask for\r\nis bare justice. Why can't you push steadily and evenly, instead\r\nof whizzing like a whirligig, and making me hot under all my\r\ncollars?\"  The thrust-block had six collars, each faced with\r\nbrass, and he did not wish to get them heated.\r\n\r\nAll the bearings that supported the fifty feet of screw-shaft as\r\nit ran to the stern whispered: \"Justice - give us justice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can only give you what I can get,\" the screw answered.  \"Look\r\nout! It's coming again!\"\r\n\r\nHe rose with a roar as the Dimbula plunged, and \"whack - flack -\r\nwhack - whack\" went the engines, furiously, for they had little\r\nto check them.\r\n\r\n\"I'm the noblest outcome of human ingenuity - Mr. Buchanan says\r\nso,\" squealed the high-pressure cylinder.  \"This is simply\r\nridiculous!\" The piston went up savagely, and choked, for half\r\nthe steam behind it was mixed with dirty water. \"Help! Oiler!\r\nFitter! Stoker! Help I'm choking,\" it gasped.\"Never in the\r\nhistory of maritime invention has such a calamity over-taken one\r\nso young and strong. And if I go, who's to drive the ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! oh, hush!\" whispered the Steam, who, of course, had been\r\nto sea many times before. He used to spend his leisure ashore in\r\na cloud, or a gutter, or a flower-pot, or a thunder-storm, or\r\nanywhere else where water was needed. \"That's only a little\r\npriming, a little carrying-over, as they call it.  It'll happen\r\nall night, on and off.  I don't say it's nice, but it's the best\r\nwe can do under the circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"What difference can circumstances make ~. I'm here to do my work\r\n- on clean, dry steam. Blow circumstances!\" the cylinder roared.\r\n\r\n\"The circumstances will attend to the blowing. I've worked on the\r\nNorth Atlantic run a good many times - it's going to be rough\r\nbefore morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't distressingly calm now,\" said the extra strong frames -\r\nthey were called web-frames - in the engine-room.  \"There's an\r\nupward thrust that we don't understand, and there's a twist that\r\nis very bad for our brackets and diamond- plates, and there's a\r\nsort of west-northwesterly pull, that follows the twist,  which\r\nseriously annoys us. We mention this because we happened to cost\r\na good  deal of money, and we feel sure that the owner would not\r\napprove of our being treated in this frivolous way.\"\r\n\r\nI'm afraid the matter is out of owner's hands for the present,\"\r\nsaid the Steam, slipping into the condenser.  \"You're left to\r\nyour own devices till the weather betters.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't mind the weather,\" said a flat bass voice below;\r\n\"it's this confounded cargo that's breaking my heart.  I'm the\r\ngarboard-strake, and I'm twice as thick as most of the others,\r\nand I ought to know something.\"\r\n\r\nThe garboard-strake is the lowest plate in the bottom of a ship,\r\nand the Dimbula's garboardstrake was nearly three-quarters of an\r\ninch mild steel.\r\n\r\n\"The sea pushes me up in a way I should never have expected,\" the\r\nstrake grunted, \"and the cargo pushes me down, and, between the\r\ntwo, I don't know what I'm supposed to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"When in doubt, hold on,\" rumbled the Steam, making head in the\r\nboilers.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but there's only dark, and cold, and hurry, down here; and\r\nhow do I know whether the other plates are doing their duty?\r\nThose bulwark-plates up above, I've heard, ain't more than\r\nfive-sixteenths of an inch thick -scandalous, I call it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you,\" said a huge web-frame, by the main\r\ncargo-hatch.  He was deeper and thicker than all the others, and\r\ncurved half-way across the ship in the shape of half an arch, to\r\nsupport the deck where deck-beams would have been in the way of\r\ncargo coming up and down. \"I work entirely unsupported, and I\r\nobserve that I am the sole strength of this vessel, so far as my\r\nvision extends.  The responsibility, I assure you, is enormous.\r\nI believe the money-value of the cargo is over one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand pounds. Think of that!\"\r\n\r\n\"And every pound of it is dependent on my personal exertions.\"\r\nHere spoke a sea-valve that communicated directly with the water\r\noutside, and was seated not very far from the garboard-strake.\r\n\"I rejoice to think that I am a Prince-Hyde Valve, with best Para\r\nrubber facings. Five patents cover me - I mention this without\r\npride - five separate and several patents, each one finer than\r\nthe other.  At present I am screwed fast. Should I open, you\r\nwould immediately be swamped. This is incontrovertible!\"\r\n\r\nPatent things always use the longest words they can.  It is a\r\ntrick that they pick up from their inventors.\r\n\r\n\"That's news,\" said a big centrifugal bilge-pump.  \"I had an idea\r\nthat you were employed to clean decks and things with.  At\r\nleast, I've used you for that more than once.  I forget the\r\nprecise number, in thousands, of gallons which I am guaranteed\r\nto throw per hour; but I assure you, my complaining friends,\r\nthat there is not the least danger.  I alone am capable of\r\nclearing any water that may find its way here.  By my Biggest\r\nDeliveries, we pitched then!\"\r\n\r\nThe sea was getting up in workmanlike style. It was a dead\r\nwesterly gale, blown from under a ragged opening of green sky,\r\nnarrowed on all sides by fat, grey clouds; and the wind bit like\r\npincers as it fretted the spray into lacework on the flanks of\r\nthe waves.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what it is,\" the foremast telephoned down its\r\nwire-stays.  \"I'm up here, and I can take a dispassionate view\r\nof things.  There's an organised conspiracy against us.  I'm\r\nsure of it, because every single one of these waves is heading\r\ndirectly for our bows. The whole sea is concerned in it - and\r\nso's the wind.  It's awful!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's awful?\" said a wave, drowning the capstan for the\r\nhundredth time.\r\n\r\n\"This organised conspiracy on your part,\" the capstan gurgled,\r\ntaking his cue from the mast.\"Organised bubbles and spindrift!\r\nThere has been a depression in the Gulf of Mexico. Excuse me!\" He\r\nleaped overside; but his friends took up the tale one after\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"Which has advanced - \"That wave hove green water over the\r\nfunnel.\r\n\r\n\"As far as Cape Hatteras -\" He drenched the bridge.\r\n\r\n\"And is now going out to sea - to sea - to sea!\" The third went\r\nout in three surges, making a clean sweep of a boat, which\r\nturned bottom up and sank in the darkening troughs alongside,\r\nwhile the broken falls whipped the davits.\r\n\r\n\"That's all there is to it,\" seethed the white water roaring\r\nthrough the scuppers. \" There's no animus in our proceedings.\r\nWe're only meteorological corollaries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it going to get any worse?\" said the bow-anchor chained down\r\nto the deck, where he could only breathe once in five minutes.\r\n\r\n\"'Not knowing, can't say. Wind may blow a bit by midnight.\r\nThanks awfully. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nThe wave that spoke so politely had travelled some distance aft,\r\nand found itself all mixed up on the deck amidships, which was a\r\nwell-deck sunk between high bulwarks. One of the bulwark-plates,\r\nwhich was hung on hinges to open outward, had swung out, and\r\npassed the bulk of the water back to the sea again with a clean\r\nsmack.\r\n\r\n\"Evidently that's what I'm made for,\" said the plate, closing\r\nagain with a sputter of pride. \"Oh, no, you don't, my friend!\"\r\n\r\nThe top of a wave was trying to get in from the outside, but as\r\nthe plate did not open in that direction, the defeated water\r\nspurted back.\r\n\r\n\"Not bad for five-sixteenths of an inch,\" said the bulwark-plate.\r\n\"My work, I see, is laid down for the night\"; and it began\r\nopening and shutting, as it was designed to do, with the motion\r\nof the ship.\r\n\r\n\"We are not what you might call idle,\" groaned all the frames\r\ntogether, as the Dimbula climbed a big wave, lay on her side at\r\nthe top, and shot into the next hollow, twisting in the descent.\r\nA huge swell pushed up exactly under her middle, and her bow and\r\nstern hung free with nothing to support them. Then one joking\r\nwave caught her up at the bow, and another at the stern, while\r\nthe rest of the water slunk away from under her just to see how\r\nshe would like it; so she was held up at her two ends only, and\r\nthe weight of the cargo and the machinery fell on the groaning\r\niron keels and bilge-stringers.\r\n\r\n\"Ease off! Ease off; there!\" roared the garboard-strake. \"I want\r\none-eighth of an inch fair play. D' you hear me, you rivets!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ease off! Ease off!\" cried the bilge-stringers. \"Don't hold us\r\nso  tight to the frames!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ease off!\" grunted the deck-beams, as the Dimbula rolled\r\nfearfully. \"You've cramped our knees into the stringers, and we\r\ncan't move. Ease off; you flat-headed little nuisances.\"\r\n\r\nThen two converging seas hit the bows, one on each side, and fell\r\naway in torrents of streaming thunder.\r\n\r\n\"Ease off!\" shouted the forward collision-bulkhead. \"I want to\r\ncrumple up, but I'm stiffened in every direction. Ease off; you\r\ndirty little forge-filings. Let me breathe!\"\r\n\r\nAll the hundreds of plates that are riveted to the frames, and\r\nmake the outside skin of every steamer, echoed the call, for\r\neach plate wanted to shift and creep a little, and each plate,\r\naccording to its position, complained against the rivets.\r\n\r\n\"We can't help it! We can't help it!\" they murmured in reply.\r\n\"We're put here to hold you, and we're going to do it; you never\r\npull us twice in the same direction. If you'd say what you were\r\ngoing to do next, we'd try to meet your views.\r\n\r\n\"As far as I could feel,\" said the upper-deck planking, and that\r\nwas four inches thick, \"every single iron near me was pushing or\r\npulling in opposite directions. Now, what's the sense of that? My\r\nfriends, let us all pull together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pull any way you please,\" roared the funnel, \"so long as you\r\ndon't try your experiments on me. I need fourteen wire-ropes,\r\nall pulling in different directions, to hold me steady.  Isn't\r\nthat so?\"\r\n\r\nWe believe you, my boy!\" whistled the funnel-stays through their\r\nclinched teeth, as they twanged in the wind from the top of the\r\nfunnel to the deck.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!  We must all pull together,\" the decks repeated.\r\n\"Pull lengthways.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said the stringers; \"then stop pushing sideways when\r\nyou get wet.  Be content to run gracefully fore and aft, and\r\ncurve in at the ends as we do.\"\r\n\r\n\"No - no curves at the end.  A very slight workmanlike curve from\r\n\r\nside to side, with a good grip at each knee, and little pieces\r\nwelded on,\" said the deck-beams.\r\n\r\n\"Fiddle!\" cried the iron pillars of the deep, dark hold.  \"Who\r\never heard of curves?  Stand up straight; be a perfectly round\r\ncolumn, and carry tons of good solid weight - like that! There!\"\r\nA big sea smashed on the deck above, and the pillars stiffened\r\nthemselves to the load.\r\n\r\n\"Straight up and down is not bad,\" said the frames, who ran that\r\nway in the sides of the ship, \"but you must also expand\r\nyourselves sideways. Expansion is the law of life, children.\r\nOpen out! open out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come back!\" said the deck-beams, savagely, as the upward heave\r\nof the sea made the frames try to open. \"Come back to your\r\nbearings, you slack-jawed irons!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rigidity!  Rigidity!  Rigidity!\" thumped the engines. \"Absolute,\r\nunvarying rigidity -rigidity!\"\r\n\r\n\"You see!\" whined the rivets, in chorus. \"No two of you will ever\r\npull alike, and - and you blame it all on us. We only know how\r\nto go through a plate and bite down on both sides so that it\r\ncan't, and mustn't, and sha'n't move.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got one fraction of an inch play, at any rate,\" said the\r\ngarboard-strake, triumphantly. So he had, and all the bottom of\r\nthe ship felt the easier for it.\r\n\r\n\"Then we're no good,\" sobbed the bottom rivets. \"We were ordered\r\n- we were ordered -never to give; and we've given, and the sea\r\nwill come in, and we'll all go to the bottom together! First\r\nwe're blamed for everything unpleasant, and now we haven't the\r\nconsolation of having done our work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say I told you,\" whispered the Steam, consolingly; \"but,\r\nbetween  you and me and the last cloud I came from, it was bound\r\nto happen sooner or later. You had to give a fraction, and\r\nyou've given without knowing it. Now, hold on, as before.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the use?\" a few hundred rivets chattered. \"We've given -\r\nwe've given; and the sooner we confess that we can't keep the\r\nship together, and go off our little heads, the easier it will\r\nbe. No rivet forged can stand this strain.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one rivet was ever meant to. Share it among you,\" the Steam\r\nanswered.\"The others can have my share. I'm going to pull out,\"\r\nsaid a rivet in one of the forward plates.\r\n\r\n\"If you go, others will follow,\" hissed the Steam.  \"There's\r\nnothing so contagious in a boat as rivets going. Why, I knew a\r\nlittle chap like you - he was an eighth of an inch fatter,\r\nthough - on a steamer - to be sure, she was only twelve hundred\r\ntons, now I come to think of it in exactly the same place as you\r\nare.  He pulled out in a bit of a bobble of a sea, not half as\r\nbad as this, and he started all his friends on the same\r\nbutt-strap, and the plates opened like a furnace door, and I had\r\nto climb into the nearest fog-bank, while the boat went down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now that's peculiarly disgraceful,\" said the rivet. \"Fatter than\r\nme, was he, and in a steamer not half our tonnage? Reedy little\r\npeg! I blush for the family, sir.\" He settled himself more\r\nfirmly than ever in his place, and the Steam chuckled.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he went on, quite gravely, \" a rivet, and especially a\r\nrivet in your position, is really the one indispensable part of\r\nthe ship.\"\r\n\r\nThe Steam did not say that be had whispered the very same thing\r\nto every single piece of iron aboard. There is no sense in\r\ntelling too much.\r\n\r\nAnd all that while the little Dimbula pitched and chopped, and\r\nswung and slewed, and lay down as though she were going to die,\r\nand got up as  though she had been stung, and threw her nose\r\nround and round in circles half a dozen times as she dipped, for\r\nthe gale was at its worst. It was inky black, in spite of the\r\ntearing white froth on the waves, and, to top everything, the\r\nrain began to fall in sheets, so that you could not see your hand\r\nbefore your face. This did not make much difference to the\r\nironwork below, but it troubled the foremast a good deal.\r\n\r\n\"Now it's all finished,\" he said dismally. \"The conspiracy is too\r\nstrong for us. There is nothing left but to -\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurraar! Brrrraaah! Brrrrrrp!\" roared the Steam through the\r\nfog-horn, till the decks quivered. \"Don't be frightened, below.\r\nIt's only me, just throwing out a few words, in case any one\r\nhappens to be rolling round to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say there's any one except us on the sea in\r\nsuch weather?\" said the funnel, in a husky snuffle.\r\n\r\n\"Scores of 'em,\" said the Steam, clearing its throat. \"Rrrrrraaa!\r\nBrraaaaa! Prrrrp! It's a trifle windy up here; and, Great\r\nBoilers! how it rains!\"\r\n\r\n\"We're drowning,\" said the scuppers. They had been doing nothing\r\nelse all night, but this steady thrash of rain above them seemed\r\nto be the end of the world.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right. We'll be easier in an hour or two. First the\r\nwind and then the rain: Soon you may make sail again!\r\nGrrraaaaaah! Drrrraaaa! Drrrp! I have a notion that the sea is\r\ngoing down already.  If it does you'll learn something about\r\nrolling.  We've only pitched till now. By the way, aren't you\r\nchaps in the hold a little easier than you were?\"\r\n\r\nThere was just as much groaning and straining as ever, but it was\r\nnot so loud or squeaky in tone; and when the ship quivered she\r\ndid not jar stiffly, like a poker hit on the floor, but gave\r\nwith a supple little waggle, like a perfectly balanced\r\ngolf-club.\r\n\r\n\"We have made a most amazing discovery,\" said the stringers, one\r\nafter another. \"A discovery that entirely changes the situation.\r\nWe have found, for the first time in the history of\r\nship-building, that the inward pull of the deck-beams and the\r\noutward thrust of the frames locks us, as it were, more closely\r\nin our places, and enables us to endure a strain which is\r\nentirely without parallel in the records of marine\r\narchitecture.\"\r\n\r\nThe Steam turned a laugh quickly into a roar up the fog-horn.\r\n\"What  massive intellects you great stringers have,\" he said\r\nsoftly, when he had finished.\r\n\r\n\"We also,\" began the deck-beams, \"are discoverers and geniuses.\r\nWe are of opinion that the support of the hold-pillars\r\nmaterially helps us.  We find that we lock up on them when we\r\nare subjected to a heavy and singular weight of sea above.\"\r\n\r\nHere the Dimbula shot down a hollow, lying almost on her side;\r\nrighting at the bottom with a wrench and a spasm.\r\n\r\n\"In these cases - are you aware of this, Steam? - the plating at\r\nthe bows, and particularly at the stern - we would also mention\r\nthe floors beneath us - help us to resist any tendency to\r\nspring.\" The frames spoke, in the solemn awed voice which people\r\nuse when they have just come across something entirely new for\r\nthe very first time.\r\n\r\n\"I'm only a poor puffy little flutterer,\" said the Steam, \"but I\r\nhave to stand a good deal of pressure in my business. It's all\r\ntremendously interesting. Tell us some more. You fellows are so\r\nstrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Watch us and you'll see,\" said the bow-plates, proudly.  \"Ready,\r\nbehind there!  Here's the father and mother of waves coming! Sit\r\ntight, rivets all!\" A great sluicing comber thundered by, but\r\nthrough the scuffle and confusion the Steam could hear the low,\r\nquick cries of the ironwork as the various strains took them -\r\ncries like these: \"Easy, now - easy! Now push for all your\r\nstrength! Hold out! Give a fraction! Hold up! Pull in! Shove\r\ncrossways! Mind the strain at the ends! Grip, now! Bite tight!\r\nLet the water get away from under - and there she goes!\"\r\n\r\nThe wave raced off into the darkness, shouting, \"Not bad, that,\r\nif it's your first run!\" and the drenched and ducked ship\r\nthrobbed to the beat of the engines inside her. All three\r\ncylinders were white with the salt spray that had come down\r\nthrough the engine-room hatch; there was white fur on the\r\ncanvas-bound steam-pipes, and even the bright-work deep below\r\nwas speckled and soiled; but the cylinders had learned to make\r\nthe most of steam that was half water, and were pounding along\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"How's the noblest outcome of human ingenuity hitting it?\" said\r\nthe Steam, as he whirled through the engine-room.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing for nothing in this world of woe,\" the cylinders\r\nanswered, as though they had been working for centuries, \"and\r\nprecious little for seventy-five pounds head. We've made two\r\nknots this last hour and a quarter! Rather humiliating for eight\r\nhundred horse-power, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's better than drifting astern, at any rate. You seem\r\nrather less - how shall I put it - stiff in the back than you\r\nwere.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'd been hammered as we've been this night, you wouldn't be\r\nstiff- iff- iff; either. Theoreti - retti - retti - cally, of\r\ncourse, rigidity is the thing. Purrr - purr - practically, there\r\nhas to be a little give and take. We found that out by working on\r\nour sides for five minutes at a stretch - chch - chh. How's the\r\nweather?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Sea's going down fast,\" said the Steam.\r\n\r\n\"Good business,\" said the high-pressure cylinder. \"Whack her up,\r\nboys. They've given us five pounds more steam\"; and he began\r\nhumming the first bars of \"Said the young Obadiah to the old\r\nObadiah,\" which, as you may have noticed, is a pet tune among\r\nengines not built for high speed. Racing-liners with twin-screws\r\nsing \"The Turkish Patrol\" and the overture to the \"Bronze\r\nHorse,\" and \"Madame Angot,\" till something goes wrong, and then\r\nthey render Gounod's \"Funeral March of a Marionette,\" with\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\n\"You'll learn a song of your own some fine day,\" said the Steam,\r\nas he flew up the fog-horn for one last bellow.\r\n\r\nNext day the sky cleared and the sea dropped a little, and the\r\nDimbula began to roll from side to side till every inch of iron\r\nin her was sick and giddy.But luckily they did not all feel ill\r\nat the same time: otherwise she would have opened out like a wet\r\npaper box.\r\n\r\nThe Steam whistled warnings as he went about his business: it is\r\nin this short, quick roll and tumble that follows a heavy sea\r\nthat most of the accidents happen, for then everything thinks\r\nthat the worst is over and goes off guard.  So he orated and\r\nchattered till the beams and frames and floors and stringers and\r\nthings had learned how to lock down and lock up on one another,\r\nand endure this new kind of strain.\r\n\r\nThey found ample time to practise, for they were sixteen days at\r\nsea, and it was foul weather till within a hundred miles of New\r\nYork.  The Dimbula picked up her pilot, and came in covered with\r\nsalt and red rust.  Her funnel was dirty-grey from top to\r\nbottom; two boats had been carried away; three copper ventilators\r\nlooked like hats after a fight with the police; the bridge had a\r\ndimple in the middle of it; the house that covered the steam\r\nsteering-gear was split as with hatchets; there was a bill for\r\nsmall repairs in the engine-room almost as long as the\r\nscrew-shaft; the forward cargo-hatch fell into bucket-staves when\r\nthey raised the iron cross-bars; and the steam-capstan had been\r\nbadly wrenched on its bed.  Altogether, as the skipper said, it\r\nwas \"a pretty general average.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she's soupled,\" he said to Mr. Buchanan. \"For all her\r\ndead-weight she rode like a yacht. Ye mind that last blow off\r\nthe Banks - I am proud of her, Buck.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's vera good,\" said the chief engineer, looking along the\r\ndishevelled decks. \"Now, a man judgin' superfeecially would say\r\nwe were a wreck, but we know otherwise - by experience.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally everything in the Dimbula fairly stiffened with pride,\r\nand the foremast and the forward collision-bulkhead, who are\r\npushing creatures, begged the Steam to warn the Port of New York\r\nof their arrival. \"Tell those big boats all about us,\" they said.\r\n\"They seem to take us quite as a matter of course.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious, clear, dead calm morning, and in single file,\r\nwith less than half a mile between each, their bands playing and\r\ntheir tugboats shouting and waving handkerchiefs, were the\r\nMajestic, the Paris, the Touraine, the Servia, the Kaiser\r\nWilhelm II, and the Werkendam, all statelily going out to sea. As\r\nthe Dimbula shifted her helm to give the great boats clear way,\r\nthe Steam (who knows far too much to mind making an exhibition\r\nof himself now and then) shouted:Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! Princes,\r\nDukes, and Barons of the High Seas! Know ye by these presents,\r\nwe are the Dimbula, fifteen days nine hours from Liverpool,\r\nhaving crossed the Atlantic with four thousand ton of cargo for\r\nthe first time in our career! We have not foundered. We are\r\nhere. 'Eer! 'Eer! We are not disabled. But we have had a time\r\nwholly unparalieled in the annals of ship-building! Our decks\r\nwere swept! We pitched; we rolled! We thought we were going to\r\ndie! Hi! Hi? But we didn't. We wish to give notice that we have\r\ncome to New York all the way across the Atlantic, through the\r\nworst weather in the world; and we are the Dimbula! We are - arr\r\n- ha - ha - ha-r-r-r!\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful line of boats swept by as steadily as the\r\nprocession of the Seasons. The Dimbula heard the Majestic say,\r\n\"Hmph!\" and the Paris grunted, \"How!\" and the Touraine said,\r\n\"Oui!\" with a little coquettish flicker of steam; and the Servia\r\nsaid, \"Haw!\" and the Kaiser and the Werkendam said, \"Hoch!\" Dutch\r\nfashion - and that was absolutely all.\r\n\r\n\"I did my best,\" said the Steam, gravely, \"but I don't think they\r\nwere much impressed with us, somehow. Do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's simply disgusting,\" said the bow-plates. \"They might have\r\nseen what we've been through. There isn't a ship on the sea that\r\nhas suffered as we have - is there, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't go so far as that,\" said the Steam, \"because\r\nI've worked on some of those boats, and sent them through\r\nweather quite as bad as the fortnight that we've had, in six\r\ndays; and some of them are a little over ten thousand tons, I\r\nbelieve. Now I've seen the Majestic, for instance, ducked from\r\nher bows to her funnel; and I've helped the Arizona, I think she\r\nwas, to back off an iceberg she met with one dark night; and I\r\nhad to run out of the Paris's engine-room, one day, because\r\nthere was thirty foot of water in it.  Of course, I don't deny -\"\r\nThe Steam shut off suddenly, as a tugboat, loaded with a\r\npolitical club and a brass band, that had been to see a New York\r\nSenator off to Europe, crossed their bows, going to Hoboken.\r\nThere was a long silence that reached, without a break, from the\r\ncut-water to the propeller-blades of the Dimbula.\r\n\r\nThen a new, big voice said slowly and thickly, as though the\r\nowner had just waked up: \"It's my conviction that I have made a\r\nfool of myself\"\r\n\r\nThe Steam knew what had happened at once; for when a ship finds\r\nherself all the talking of the separate pieces ceases and melts\r\ninto one voice, which is the soul of the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" he said, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I am the Dimbula, of course.  I've never been anything else\r\nexcept that - and a fool!\"\r\n\r\nThe tugboat, which was doing its very best to be run down, got\r\naway just in time; its band playing clashily and brassily a\r\npopular but impolite air:\r\n\r\n In the days of old Rameses - are you on?In the days of old\r\nRameses - are you on?In the days of old Rameses,That story had\r\nparesis,Are you on - are you on - are you on?\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you've found yourself,\" said the Steam. \"To tell\r\nthe truth, I was a little tired of talking to all those ribs and\r\nstringers. Here's Quarantine. After that we'll go to our wharf\r\nand clean up a little, and - next month we'll do it all over\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nEND OF THE \"THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOMB OF HIS ANCESTORS\r\n\r\nSome people will tell you that if there were but a single loaf of\r\nbread in all India it would be divided equally between the\r\nPlowdens, the Trevors, the Beadons, and the Rivett-Carnacs. That\r\nis only one way of saying that certain families serve India\r\ngeneration after generation, as dolphins follow in line across\r\nthe open sea.\r\n\r\nLet us take a small and obscure case. There has been at least one\r\nrepresentative of the Devonshire Chinns in or near Central India\r\nsince the days of Lieutenant-Fireworker Humphrey Chinn, of the\r\nBombay European Regiment, who assisted at the capture of\r\nSeringapatam in 1799. Alfred Ellis Chinn, Humphrey's younger\r\nbrother, commanded a regiment of Bombay grenadiers from 1804 to\r\n1813, when he saw some mixed fighting; and in 1834 John Chinn of\r\nthe same family - we will call him John Chinn the First - came to\r\nlight as a level-headed administrator in time of trouble at a\r\nplace called Mundesur. He died young, but left his mark on the\r\nnew country, and the Honourable the Board of Directors of the\r\nHonourable the East India Company embodied his virtues in a\r\nstately resolution, and paid for the expenses of his tomb among\r\nthe Satpura hills.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by his son, Lionel Chinn, who left the little\r\nold Devonshire home just in time to be severely wounded in the\r\nMutiny. He spent his working life within a hundred and fifty\r\nmiles of John Chinn's grave, and rose to the command of a\r\nregiment of small, wild hill-men, most of whom had known his\r\nfather. His son John was born in the small thatched-roofed,\r\nmud-walled cantonment, which is even to-day eighty miles from\r\nthe nearest railway, in the heart of a scrubby, tigerish\r\ncountry. Colonel Lionel Chinn served thirty years and retired.\r\nIn the Canal his steamer passed the outward-bound troop-ship,\r\ncarrying his son eastward to the family duty.\r\n\r\nThe Chinns are luckier than most folk, because they know exactly\r\nwhat they must do. A clever Chinn passes for the Bombay Civil\r\nService, and gets away to Central India, where everybody is glad\r\nto see him. A dull Chinn enters the Police Department or the\r\nWoods and Forest, and sooner or later he, too, appears in\r\nCentral India, and that is what gave rise to the saying,\r\n\"Central India is inhabited by Bhils, Mairs, and Chinns, all\r\nvery much alike.\" The breed is small-boned, dark, and silent,\r\nand the stupidest of them are good shots. John Chinn the Second\r\nwas rather clever, but as the eldest son he entered the army,\r\naccording to Chinn tradition. His duty was to abide in his\r\nfather's regiment for the term of his natural life, though the\r\ncorps was one which most men would have paid heavily to avoid.\r\nThey were irregulars, small, dark, and blackish, clothed in\r\nrifle-green with black-leather trimmings; and friends called them\r\nthe \"Wuddars,\" which means a race of low-caste people who dig up\r\nrats to eat. But the Wuddars did not resent it. They were the\r\nonly Wuddars, and their points of pride were these:\r\n\r\nFirstly, they had fewer English officers than any native\r\nregiment. Secondly, their subalterns were not mounted on parade,\r\nas is the general rule, but walked at the head of their men. A\r\nman who can hold his own with the Wuddars at their quickstep must\r\nbe sound in wind and limb. Thirdly, they were the most pukka\r\nshikarries (out-and-out hunters) in all India. Fourthly-up to\r\none-hundredthly - they were the Wuddars -Chinn's Irregular Bhil\r\nLevies of the old days, but now, henceforward and for ever, the\r\nWuddars.\r\n\r\nNo Englishman entered their mess except for love or through\r\nfamily usage. The officers talked to their soldiers in a tongue\r\nnot two hundred white folk in India understood; and the men were\r\ntheir children, all drawn from the Bhils, who are, perhaps, the\r\nstrangest of the many strange races in India. They were, and at\r\nheart are, wild men, furtive, shy, full of untold superstitions.\r\nThe races whom we call natives of the country found the Bhil in\r\npossession of the land when they first broke into that part of\r\nthe world thousands of years ago. The books call them Pre-Aryan,\r\nAboriginal, Dravidian, and so forth; and, in other words, that is\r\nwhat the Bhils call themselves. When a Rajput chief whose bards\r\ncan sing his pedigree backwards for twelve hundred years is set\r\non the throne, his investiture is not complete till he has been\r\nmarked on the forehead with blood from the veins of a Bhil. The\r\nRajputs say the ceremony has no meaning, but the Bhil knows that\r\nit is the last, last shadow of his old rights as the long-ago\r\nowner of the soil.\r\n\r\nCenturies of oppression and massacre made the Bhil a cruel and\r\nhalf-crazy thief and cattle-stealer, and when the English came\r\nhe seemed to be almost as open to civilisation as the tigers of\r\nhis own jungles.  But John Chinn the First, father of Lionel,\r\ngrandfather of our John, went into his country, lived with him,\r\nlearned his language, shot the deer that stole his poor crops,\r\nand won his confidence, so that some Bhils learned to plough and\r\nsow, while others were coaxed into the Company's service to\r\npolice their friends.\r\n\r\nWhen they understood that standing in line did not mean instant\r\nexecution, they accepted soldiering as a cumbrous but amusing\r\nkind of sport, and were zealous to keep the wild Bhils under\r\ncontrol. That was the thin edge of the wedge. John Chinn the\r\nFirst gave them written promises that, if they were good from a\r\ncertain date, the Government would overlook previous offences;\r\nand since John Chinn was never known to break his word - he\r\npromised once to hang a Bhil locally esteemed invulnerable, and\r\nhanged him in front of his tribe for seven proved murders - the\r\nBhils settled down as steadily as they knew how. It was slow,\r\nunseen work, of the sort that is being done all over India\r\nto-day; and though John Chinn's only reward came, as I have\r\nsaid, in the shape of a grave at Government expense, the little\r\npeople of the hills never forgot him.\r\n\r\nColonel Lionel Chinn knew and loved them, too, and they were very\r\nfairly civilised, for Bhils, before his service ended. Many of\r\nthem could hardly be distinguished from low-caste Hindoo\r\nfarmers; but in the south, where John Chinn the First was\r\nburied, the wildest still clung to the Satpura ranges, cherishing\r\na legend that some day Jan Chinn, as they called him, would\r\nreturn to his own.  In the mean time they mistrusted the white\r\nman and his ways. The least excitement would stampede them,\r\nplundering, at random, and now and then killing; but if they\r\nwere handled discreetly they grieved like children, and promised\r\nnever to do it again.\r\n\r\nThe Bhils of the regiment - the uniformed men - were virtuous in\r\nmany ways, but they needed humouring.  They felt bored and\r\nhomesick unless taken after tiger as beaters; and their\r\ncold-blooded daring - all Wuddars shoot tigers on foot: it is\r\ntheir caste-mark - made even the officers wonder. They would\r\nfollow up a wounded tiger as unconcernedly as though it were a\r\nsparrow with a broken wing; and this through a country full of\r\ncaves and rifts and pits, where a wild beast could hold a dozen\r\nmen at his mercy. Now and then some little man was brought to\r\nbarracks with his head smashed in or his ribs torn away; but his\r\ncompanions never learned caution; they contented themselves with\r\nsettling the tiger.\r\n\r\nYoung John Chinn was decanted at the verandah of the Wuddars'\r\nlonely mess-house from the back seat of a two-wheeled cart, his\r\ngun-cases cascading all round him. The slender little,\r\nhookey-nosed boy looked forlorn as a strayed goat when he\r\nslapped the white dust off his knees, and the cart jolted down\r\nthe glaring road.  But in his heart he was contented.  After\r\nall, this was the place where he had been born, and things were\r\nnot much changed since he had been sent to England, a child,\r\nfifteen years ago.\r\n\r\nThere were a few new buildings, but the air and the smell and the\r\nsunshine were the same; and the little green men who crossed the\r\nparade-ground looked very familiar.  Three weeks ago John Chinn\r\nwould have said he did not remember a word of the Bhil tongue,\r\nbut at the mess door he found his lips moving in sentences that\r\nhe did not understand - bits of old nursery rhymes, and tail-ends\r\nof such orders as his father used to give the men.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel watched him come up the steps, and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" he said to the Major.  \"No need to ask the young un's\r\nbreed.  He's a pukka Chinn. 'Might be his father in the Fifties\r\nover again.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Hope he'll shoot as straight,\" said the Major. \"He's brought\r\nenough ironmongery with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Wouldn't be a Chinn if he didn't.  Watch him blowin' his nose.\r\n'Regular Chinn beak. 'Flourishes his handkerchief like his\r\nfather.  It's the second edition - line for line.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Fairy tale, by Jove!\" said the Major, peering through the slats\r\nof the jalousies.  \"If he's the lawful heir, he'll . . . .  Now\r\nold Chinn could no more pass that chick without fiddling with it\r\nthan . . . .\r\n\r\n\"His son!\" said the Colonel, jumping up.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I be blowed!\" said the Major.  The boy's eye had been\r\ncaught by a split-,reed screen that hung on a slew between the\r\nveranda pillars, and, mechanically, he had tweaked the edge to\r\nset it level.  Old Chinn had sworn three times a day at that\r\nscreen for many years; he could never get it to his satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHis son entered the anteroom in the middle of a fivefold\r\nsilence.  They made him welcome for his father's sake and, as\r\nthey took stock of him, for his own.  He was ridiculously like\r\nthe portrait of the Colonel on the wall, and when he had washed\r\na little of the dust from his throat he went to his quarters with\r\nthe old man's short, noiseless jungle-step.\r\n\r\n\"So much for heredity,\" said the Major. \"That comes of four\r\ngenerations among the Bhils.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the men know it,\" said a Wing officer. \"They've been waiting\r\nfor this youth with their tongues hanging out.  I am persuaded\r\nthat, unless he absolutely beats 'em over the head, they'll lie\r\ndown by companies and worship him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothin' like havin' a father before you,\" said the Major.  \"I'm\r\na parvenu with my chaps.  I've only been twenty years in the\r\nregiment, and my revered parent he was a simple squire.  There's\r\nno getting at the bottom of a Bhil's mind.  Now, why is the\r\nsuperior bearer that young Chinn brought with him fleeing across\r\ncountry with his bundle?\"  He stepped into the verandah, and\r\nshouted after the man - a typical new-joined subaltern's servant\r\nwho speaks English and cheats in proportion.\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\" he called.\r\n\r\nPlenty bad man here.  I going, sar,\" was the reply.  \"'Have taken\r\nSahib's keys, and say will shoot.\"\r\n\r\nDoocid lucid - doocid convincin'. How those up-country thieves\r\ncan leg it!  He has been badly frightened by some one.\" The\r\nMajor strolled to his quarters to dress for mess.\r\n\r\nYoung Chinn, walking like a man in a dream, had fetched a compass\r\nround the entire cantonment before going to his own tiny\r\ncottage. The captain's quarters, in which he had been born,\r\ndelayed him for a little; then he looked at the well on the\r\nparade-ground, where he had sat of evenings with his nurse, and\r\nat the ten-by-fourteen church, where the officers went to\r\nservice if a chaplain of any official creed happened to come\r\nalong. It seemed very small as compared with the gigantic\r\nbuildings he used to stare up at, but it was the same place.\r\n\r\n>From time to time he passed a knot of silent soldiers, who\r\nsaluted. They might have been the very men who had carried him\r\non their backs when he was in his first knickerbockers. A faint\r\nlight burned in his room, and, as he entered, hands clasped his\r\nfeet, and a voice murmured from the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\" said young Chinn, not knowing he spoke in the Bhil\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n\"I bore you in my arms, Sahib, when I was a strong man and you\r\nwere a small one - crying, crying, crying!  I am your servant,\r\nas I was your father's before you.  We are all your servants.\"\r\n\r\nYoung Chinn could not trust himself to reply, and the voice went\r\non:\r\n\r\n\"I have taken your keys from that fat foreigner, and sent him\r\naway; and the studs are in the shirt for mess.  Who should know,\r\nif I do not know? And so the baby has become a man, and forgets\r\nhis nurse; but my nephew shall make a good servant, or I will\r\nbeat him twice a day.\"\r\n\r\nThen there rose up, with a rattle, as straight as a Bhil arrow, a\r\nlittle white-haired wizened ape of a man, with medals and orders\r\non his tunic, stammering, saluting, and trembling.  Behind him a\r\nyoung and wiry Bhil, in uniform, was taking the trees out of\r\nChinn's mess-boots.\r\n\r\nChinn's eyes were full of tears.  The old man held out his keys.\r\n\r\n\"Foreigners are bad people.  He will never come back again.  We\r\nare all servants of your father's son.  Has the Sahib forgotten\r\nwho took him to see the trapped tiger in the village across the\r\nriver, when his mother was so frightened and he was so brave?\"\r\n\r\nThe scene came back to Chinn in great magic-lantern flashes.\r\n\"Bukta!\" he cried; and all in a breath: \"You promised nothing\r\nshould hurt me. Is it Bukta?\"\r\n\r\nThe man was at his feet a second time. \"He has not forgotten.  He\r\nremembers his own people as his father remembered.  Now can I\r\ndie.  But first I will live and show the Sahib how to kill\r\ntigers.  That that yonder is my nephew.  If he is not a good\r\nservant, beat him and send him to me, and I will surely kill him,\r\nfor now the Sahib is with his own people.  Ai, Jan haba - Jan\r\nhaba! My Jan haba!  I will stay here and see that this does his\r\nwork well.  Take off his boots, fool. Sit down upon the bed,\r\nSahib, and let me look.  It is Jan haba.\"\r\n\r\nHe pushed forward the hilt of his sword as a sign of service,\r\nwhich is an honour paid only to viceroys, governors, generals,\r\nor to little children whom one loves dearly.  Chinn touched the\r\nhilt mechanically with three fingers, muttering he knew not\r\nwhat.  It happened to be the old answer of his childhood, when\r\nBukta in jest called him the little General Sahib.\r\n\r\nThe Major's quarters were opposite Chinn's, and when he heard his\r\nservant gasp with surprise he looked across the room.  Then the\r\nMajor sat on the bed and whistled; for the spectacle of the\r\nsenior native commissioned officer of the regiment, an \"unmixed\"\r\nBhil, a Companion of the Order of British India, with\r\nthirty-five years' spotless service in the army, and a rank\r\namong his own people superior to that of many Bengal\r\nprincelings, valeting the last-joined subaltern, was a little\r\ntoo much for his nerves.\r\n\r\nThe throaty bugles blew the Mess-call that has a long legend\r\nbehind it.  First a few piercing notes like the shrieks of\r\nbeaters in a far-away cover, and next, large, full, and smooth,\r\nthe refrain of the wild song: \"And oh, and oh, the green pulse\r\nof Mundore - Mundore!\"\r\n\r\n\"All little children were in bed when the Sahib heard that call\r\nlast,\" said Bukta, passing Chinn a clean handkerchief. The call\r\nbrought back memories of his cot under the mosquito-netting, his\r\nmother's kiss, and the sound of footsteps growing fainter as he\r\ndropped asleep among his men.  So he hooked the dark collar of\r\nhis new mess-jacket, and went to dinner like a prince who has\r\nnewly inherited his father's crown.\r\n\r\nOld Bukta swaggered forth curling his whiskers. He knew his own\r\nvalue, and no money and no rank within the gift of the\r\nGovernment would have induced him to put studs in young\r\nofficers' shirts, or to hand them clean ties.  Yet, when he took\r\noff his uniform that night, and squatted among his fellows for a\r\nquiet smoke, he told them what he had done, and they said that he\r\nwas entirely right.  Thereat Bukta propounded a theory which to a\r\nwhite mind would have seemed raving insanity; but the whispering,\r\nlevel-headed little men of war considered it from every point of\r\nview, and thought that there might be a great deal in it.\r\n\r\nAt mess under the oil-lamps the talk turned as usual to the\r\nunfailing subject of shikar - big game-shooting of every kind\r\nand under all sorts of conditions.  Young Chinn opened his eyes\r\nwhen he understood that each one of his companions had shot\r\nseveral tigers in the Wuddar style - on foot, that is - making no\r\nmore of the business than if the brute had been a dog.\r\n\r\n\"In nine cases out of ten,\" said the Major, \"a tiger is almost as\r\ndangerous as a porcupine.  But the tenth time you come home feet\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\nThat set all talking, and long before midnight Chinn's brain was\r\nin a whirl with stories of tigers - man-eaters and\r\ncattle-killers each pursuing his own business as methodically as\r\nclerks in an office; new tigers that had lately come into\r\nsuch-and-such a district; and old, friendly beasts of great\r\ncunning, known by nicknames in the mess-such as \"Puggy,\" who was\r\nlazy, with huge paws, and \"Mrs. Malaprop,\" who turned up when you\r\nnever expected her, and made female noises. Then they spoke of\r\nBhil superstitions, a wide and picturesque field, till young\r\nChinn hinted that they must be pulling his leg.\r\n\r\n\"'Deed, we aren't,\" said a man on his left. \"We know all about\r\nyou.  You're a Chinn and all that, and you've a sort of vested\r\nright here; but if you don't believe what we're telling you,\r\nwhat will you do when old Bukta begins his stories?  He knows\r\nabout ghost-tigers, and tigers that go to a hell of their own;\r\nand tigers that walk on their hind feet; and your grandpapa's\r\nriding-tiger, as well.  'Odd he hasn't spoken of that yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know you've an ancestor buried down Satpura way, don't you?\"\r\nsaid the Major, as Chinn smiled irresolutely.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do,\" said Chinn, who had the chronicle of the Book\r\nof Chinn by heart.  It lies in a worn old ledger on the Chinese\r\nlacquer table behind the piano in the Devonshire home, and the\r\nchildren are allowed to look  at it on Sundays.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I wasn't sure.  Your revered ancestor, my boy, according\r\nto the Bhils, has a tiger of his own - a saddle-tiger that he\r\nrides round the country whenever he feels inclined. I don't call\r\nit decent in an ex-Collector's ghost; but that is what the\r\nSouthern Bhils believe.  Even our men, who might be called\r\nmoderately cool, don't care to beat that country if they hear\r\nthat Jan Chinn is running about on his tiger.  It is supposed to\r\nbe a clouded animal - not stripy, but blotchy, like a\r\ntortoise-shell tom-cat.  No end of a brute, it is, and a sure\r\nsign of war or pestilence or - or something.  There's a nice\r\nfamily legend for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the origin of it, d' you suppose?\" said Chinn.\r\n\r\n\"Ask the Satpura Bhils.  Old Jan Chinn was a mighty hunter before\r\nthe Lord. Perhaps it was the tiger's revenge, or perhaps he's\r\nhuntin' 'em still. You must go to his tomb one of these days and\r\ninquire.  Bukta will probably attend to that. He was asking me\r\nbefore you came whether by any ill-luck you  had already bagged\r\nyour tiger. If not, he is going to enter you under his own wing.\r\nOf course, for you of all men it's imperative.  You'll have a\r\nfirst-class time with Bukta.\"\r\n\r\nThe Major was not wrong.  Bukta kept an anxious eye on young\r\nChinn at drill, and it was noticeable that the first time the\r\nnew officer lifted up his voice in an order the whole line\r\nquivered. Even the Colonel was taken aback, for it might have\r\nbeen Lionel Chinn returned from Devonshire with a new lease of\r\nlife.  Bukta had continued to develop his peculiar theory among\r\nhis intimates, and it was accepted as a matter of faith in the\r\nlines, since every word and gesture on young Chinn's part so\r\nconfirmed it.\r\n\r\nThe old man arranged early that his darling should wipe out the\r\nreproach of not having shot a tiger; but he was not content to\r\ntake the first or any beast that happened to arrive.  In his own\r\nvillages he dispensed the high, low, and middle justice, and when\r\nhis people-naked and fluttered - came to him with word  of a\r\nbeast marked down, he bade them send spies to the kills and the\r\nwatering-places, that he might be sure the quarry was such an one\r\nas suited the dignity of such a man.\r\n\r\nThree or four times the reckless trackers returned, most\r\ntruthfully saying that the beast was mangy, undersized - a\r\ntigress worn with nursing, or a broken-toothed old male - and\r\nBukta would curb young Chinn's impatience.\r\n\r\nAt last, a noble animal was marked down - a ten-foot\r\ncattle-killer with a huge roll of loose skin along the belly,\r\nglossy-hided, full-frilled about the neck, whiskered, frisky,\r\nand young. He had slain a man in pure sport, they said.\r\n\r\n\"Let him be fed,\" quoth Bukta, and the villagers dutifully drove\r\nout a cow to amuse him, that he might lie up near by.\r\n\r\nPrinces and potentates have taken ship to India and spent great\r\nmoneys for the mere glimpse of beasts one-half as fine as this\r\nof Bukta's.\r\n\r\n\"It is not good,\" said he to the Colonel, when he asked for\r\nshooting-leave, \"that my Colonel's son who may be - that my\r\nColonel's son should lose his maidenhead on any small jungle\r\nbeast. That may come after.  I have waited long for this which\r\nis a tiger.  He has come in from the Mair country. In seven days\r\nwe will return with the skin.\"\r\n\r\nThe mess gnashed their teeth enviously. Bukta, had he chosen,\r\nmight have invited them all. But he went out alone with Chinn,\r\ntwo days in a shooting-cart and a day on foot, till they came to\r\na rocky, glary valley with a pool of good water in it. It was a\r\nparching day, and the boy very naturally stripped and went in for\r\na bathe, leaving Bukta by the clothes.  A white skin shows far\r\nagainst brown jungle, and what Bukta beheld on Chinn's back and\r\nright shoulder dragged him forward step by step with staring\r\neyeballs.\r\n\r\n\"I'd forgotten it isn't decent to strip before a man of his\r\nposition,\" said Chinn, flouncing in the water. \"How the little\r\ndevil stares! What is it, Bukta?\" \"The Mark!\" was the whispered\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing. You know how it is with my people!\" Chinn was\r\nannoyed. The dull-red birth-mark on his shoulder, something like\r\na conventionalised Tartar cloud, had slipped his memory or he\r\nwould not have bathed. It occurred, so they said at home, in\r\nalternate generations, appearing, curiously enough, eight or nine\r\nyears after birth, and, save that it was part of the Chinn\r\ninheritance, would not be considered pretty. He hurried ashore,\r\ndressed again, and went on till they met two or three Bhils, who\r\npromptly fell on their faces. \"My people,\" grunted Bukta, not\r\ncondescending to notice them. \"And so your people, Sahib. When I\r\nwas a young man we were fewer, but not so weak. Now we are many,\r\nbut poor stock. As may be remembered. How will you shoot him,\r\nSahib? From a tree; from a shelter which my people shall build;\r\nby day or by night?\"\r\n\r\n\"On foot and in the daytime,\" said young Chinn.\r\n\r\n\"That was your custom, as I have heard,\" said Bukta to himself \"I\r\nwill get news of him. Then you and I will go to him. I will\r\ncarry one gun. You have yours. There is no need of more. What\r\ntiger shall stand against thee?\"\r\n\r\nHe was marked down by a little water-hole at the head of a\r\nravine, full-gorged and half asleep in the May sunlight. He was\r\nwalked up like a partridge, and he turned to do battle for his\r\nlife. Bukta made no motion to raise his rifle, but kept his eyes\r\non Chinn, who met the shattering roar of the charge with a single\r\nshot - it seemed to him hours as he sighted - which tore through\r\nthe throat, smashing the backbone below the neck and between the\r\nshoulders. The brute couched, choked, and fell, and before Chinn\r\nknew well what had happened Bukta bade him stay still while he\r\npaced the distance between his feet and the ringing jaws.\r\n\r\n\"Fifteen,\" said Bukta. \"Short paces. No need for a second shot,\r\nSahib. He bleeds cleanly where he lies, and we need not spoil\r\nthe skin. I said there would be no need of these, but they came\r\n- in case.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sides of the ravine were crowned with the heads of\r\nBukta's people - a force that could have blown the ribs out of\r\nthe beast had Chinn's shot failed; but their guns were hidden,\r\nand they appeared as interested beaters, some five or six waiting\r\nthe word to skin. Bukta watched the life fade from the wild eyes,\r\nlifted one hand, and turned on his heel.\r\n\r\n\"No need to show that we care,\" said he. \"Now, after this, we can\r\nkill what we choose. Put out your hand, Sahib.\"\r\n\r\nChinn obeyed. It was entirely steady, and Bukta nodded. \"That\r\nalso was  your custom. My men skin quickly. They will carry the\r\nskin to cantonments. Will the Sahib come to my poor village for\r\nthe night and, perhaps, forget  that I am his officer?\"\r\n\r\n\"But those men - the beaters. They have worked hard, and perhaps\r\n-\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if they skin clumsily, we will skin them. They are my\r\npeople.  In the lines I am one thing. Here I am another.\"\r\n\r\nThis was very true. When Bukta doffed uniform and reverted to the\r\nfragmentary dress of his own people, he left his civilisation of\r\ndrill in the next world. That night, after a little talk with his\r\nsubjects, he devoted to an orgie; and a Bhil orgie is a thing not\r\nto be safely written about. Chinn, flushed with triumph, was in\r\nthe thick of it, but the meaning of the mysteries was hidden.\r\nWild folk came and pressed about his knees with offerings. He\r\ngave his flask to the elders of the village. They grew eloquent,\r\nand wreathed him about with flowers. Gifts and loans, not all\r\nseemly, were thrust upon him, and infernal music rolled and\r\nmaddened round red fires, while singers sang songs of the ancient\r\ntimes, and danced peculiar dances. The aboriginal liquors are\r\nvery potent, and Chinn was compelled to taste them often, but,\r\nunless the stuff had been drugged, how came he to fall asleep\r\nsuddenly, and to waken late the next day - half a march from the\r\nvillage?\r\n\r\n\"The Sahib was very tired. A little before dawn he went to\r\nsleep,\"  Bukta explained. \"My people carried him here, and now\r\nit is time we should go back to cantonments.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice, smooth and deferential, the step, steady and silent,\r\nmade it hard to believe that only a few hours before Bukta was\r\nyelling and capering with naked fellow-devils of the scrub.\r\n\r\n\"My people were very pleased to see the Sahib. They will never\r\nforget. When next the Sahib goes out recruiting, he will go to\r\nmy people, and they will give him as many men as we need.\"\r\n\r\nChinn kept his own counsel, except as to the shooting of the\r\ntiger, and Bukta embroidered that tale with a shameless tongue.\r\nThe skin was certainly one of the finest ever hung up in the\r\nmess, and the first of many.  When Bukta could not accompany his\r\nboy on shooting-trips, he took care to put him in good hands,\r\nand Chinn learned more of the mind and desire of the wild Bhil\r\nin his marches and campings, by talks at twilight or at wayside\r\npools, than an uninstructed man could have come at in a\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\nPresently his men in the regiment grew bold to speak of their\r\nrelatives-mostly in trouble-and to lay cases of tribal custom\r\nbefore him. They would say, squatting in his verandah at\r\ntwilight, after the easy, confidential style of the Wuddars,\r\nthat such-and-such a bachelor had run away with such-and-such a\r\nwife at a far-off village. Now, how many cows would Chinn Sahib\r\nconsider a just fine? Or, again, if written order came from the\r\nGovernment that a Bhil was to repair to a walled city of the\r\nplains to give evidence in a law-court, would it be wise to\r\ndisregard that order? On the other hand, if it were obeyed, would\r\nthe rash voyager return alive?\r\n\r\n\"But what have I to do with these things?\" Chinn demanded of\r\nBukta, impatiently. \"I am a soldier. I do not know the law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hoo!  Law is for fools and white men.  Give them a large and\r\nloud order, and they will abide by it.  Thou art their law.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wherefore?\"\r\n\r\nEvery trace of expression left Bukta's countenance.  The idea\r\nmight have smitten him for the first time.  \"How can I say?\" he\r\nreplied. \"Perhaps it is on account of the name.  A Bhil does not\r\nlove strange things.  Give them orders, Sahib-  two, three, four\r\nwords at a time such as they can carry away in their heads.\r\nThat is enough.\"\r\n\r\nChinn gave orders then, valiantly, not realising that a word\r\nspoken in haste before mess became the dread unappealable law of\r\nvillages beyond the smoky hills  was, in truth, no less than the\r\nLaw of Jan Chinn the First, who, so the whispered legend ran, had\r\ncome back to earth, to oversee the third generation, in the body\r\nand bones of his grandson.\r\n\r\nThere could be no sort of doubt in this matter. All the Bhils\r\nknew that Jan Chinn reincarnated had honoured Bukta's village\r\nwith his presence after slaying his first-in this life-tiger;\r\nthat he had eaten and drunk with the people, as he was used; and\r\n- Bukta must have drugged Chinn's liquor very deeply-upon his\r\nback and right shoulder all men had seen the same angry red\r\nFlying Cloud that the high Gods had set on the flesh of Jan\r\nChinn the First when first he came to the Bhil. As concerned the\r\nfoolish white world which has no eyes, he was a slim and young\r\nofficer in the Wuddars; but his own people knew he was Jan Chinn,\r\nwho had made the Bhil a man; and, believing, they hastened to\r\ncarry his words, careful never to alter them on the way.\r\n\r\nBecause the savage and the child who plays lonely games have one\r\nhorror of being laughed at or questioned, the little folk kept\r\ntheir convictions to themselves; and the Colonel, who thought he\r\nknew his regiment, never guessed that each one of the six\r\nhundred quick-footed, beady-eyed rank-and-file, to attention\r\nbeside their rifles, believed serenely and unshakenly that the\r\nsubaltern on the left flank of the line was a demi-god twice\r\nborn -tutelary deity of their land and people.  The Earth-gods\r\nthemselves had stamped the incarnation, and who would dare to\r\ndoubt the handiwork of the Earth-gods?\r\n\r\nChinn, being practical above all things, saw that his family name\r\nserved him well in the lines and in camp.  His men gave no\r\ntrouble-one does not commit regimental offences with a god in\r\nthe chair of justice-and he was sure of the best beaters in the\r\ndistrict when he needed them. They believed that the protection\r\nof Jan Chinn the First cloaked them, and were bold in that belief\r\nbeyond the utmost daring of excited Bhils.\r\n\r\nHis quarters began to look like an amateur natural-history\r\nmuseum, in spite of duplicate heads and horns and skulls that he\r\nsent home to Devonshire.  The people, very humanly, learned the\r\nweak side of their god. It is true he was unbribable, but\r\nbird-skins, butterflies, beetles, and, above all, news of big\r\ngame pleased him.  In other respects, too, he lived up to the\r\nChinn tradition. He was fever-proof. A night's sitting out over\r\na tethered goat in a damp valley, that would have filled the\r\nMajor with a month's malaria, had no effect on him.  He was, as\r\nthey said, \"salted before he was born.\"\r\n\r\nNow in the autumn of his second year's service an uneasy rumour\r\ncrept out of the earth and ran about among the Bhils.  Chinn\r\nheard nothing of it till a brother- Officer said across the\r\nmess-table:  \"Your revered ancestor's on the rampage in the\r\nSatpura country.  You'd better look him up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to be disrespectful, but I'm a little sick of my\r\nrevered ancestor.  Bukta talks of nothing else.  What's the old\r\nboy supposed to be doing now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Riding cross-country by moonlight on his processional tiger.\r\nThat's the story.  He's been seen by about two thousand Bhils,\r\nskipping along the tops of the Satpuras, and scaring people to\r\ndeath.  They believe it devoutly, and all the Satpura chaps are\r\nworshipping away at his shrine- tomb, I mean-like good uns. You\r\nreally ought to go down there. Must be a queer thing to see your\r\ngrandfather treated as a god.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think there's any truth in the tale?\" said\r\nChinn.\r\n\r\n\"Because all our men deny it. They say they've never heard of\r\nChinn's tiger. Now that's a manifest lie, because every Bhil\r\nhas.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's only one thing you've overlooked,\" said the Colonel,\r\nthoughtfully. \"When a local god reappears on earth, it's always\r\nan excuse for trouble of some kind; and those Satpura Bhils are\r\nabout as wild as your grandfather left them, young un. It means\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meanin' they may go on the war-path?\" said Chinn.\r\n\r\n\"'Can't say - as yet. 'Shouldn't be surprised a little bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't been told a syllable.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Proves it all the more. They are keeping something back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bukta tells me everything, too, as a rule. Now, why didn't he\r\ntell me that?\"\r\n\r\nChinn put the question directly to the old man that night, and\r\nthe answer surprised him.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I tell what is well known? Yes, the Clouded Tiger is\r\nout in the Satpura country.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do the wild Bhils think that it means?\"\r\n\r\nThey do not know. They wait. Sahib, what is coming? Say only one\r\nlittle word, and we will be content.\"\r\n\r\n\"We? What have tales from the south, where the jungly Bhils live,\r\nto do with drilled men?\" \"When Jan Chinn wakes is no time for\r\nany Bhil to be quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he has not waked, Bukta.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sahib \"-the old man's eyes were full of tender reproof-\" if he\r\ndoes not wish to be seen, why does he go abroad in the\r\nmoonlight? We know he is awake, but we do not know what he\r\ndesires. Is it a sign for all the Bhils, or one that concerns\r\nthe Satpura folk alone? Say one little word, Sahib, that I may\r\ncarry it to the lines, and send on to our villages. Why does Jan\r\nChinn ride out? Who has done wrong? Is it pestilence? Is it\r\nmurrain? Will our children die? Is it a sword? Remember, Sahib,\r\nwe are thy people and thy servants, and in this life I bore thee\r\nin my arms-not knowing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bukta has evidently looked on the cup this evening,\" Chinn\r\nthought;  \"but if I can do anything to soothe the old chap I\r\nmust. It's like the Mutiny rumours on a small scale.\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped into a deep wicker chair, over which was thrown his\r\nfirst tiger-skin, and his weight on the cushion flapped the\r\nclawed paws over his shoulders. He laid hold of them\r\nmechanically as he spoke, drawing the painted hide,\r\ncloak-fashion, about him.\r\n\r\n\"Now will I tell the truth, Bukta,\" he said, leaning forward, the\r\ndried muzzle on his shoulder, to invent a specious lie.\r\n\r\n\"I see that it is the truth,\" was the answer, in a shaking voice.\r\n\r\n\"Jan Chinn goes abroad among the Satpuras, riding on the Clouded\r\nTiger, ye say? Be it so. Therefore the sign of the wonder is for\r\nthe Satpura Bhils only,  and does not touch the Bhils who plough\r\nin the north and east, the Bhils  of the Khandesh, or any\r\nothers, except the Satpura Bhils, who, as we know,  are wild and\r\nfoolish.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, then, a sign for them. Good or bad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beyond doubt, good. For why should Jan Chinn make evil to those\r\nwhom he has made men? The nights over yonder are hot; it is ill\r\nto lie in one bed over-long without turning, and Jan Chinn would\r\nlook again upon his people. So he rises, whistles his Clouded\r\nTiger, and goes abroad a little to breathe  the cool air. If the\r\nSatpura Bhils kept to their villages, and did not wander after\r\ndark, they would not see him.  Indeed, Bukta, it is no more than\r\nthat he would see the light again in his own country. Send this\r\nnews south, and say that it is my word.\"\r\n\r\nBukta bowed to the floor.  \"Good Heavens!\" thought Chinn, \"and\r\nthis blinking pagan is a first-class officer, and as straight as\r\na die!  I may as well round it off neatly.\"  He went on:\r\n\r\n\"If the Satpura Bhils ask the meaning of the sign, tell them that\r\nJan Chinn would see how they kept their old promises of good\r\nliving. Perhaps they have plundered; perhaps they mean to\r\ndisobey the orders of the Government; perhaps there is a dead\r\nman in the jungle; and so Jan Chinn has come to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he, then, angry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!  Am I ever angry with my Bhils?  I say angry words, and\r\nthreaten many things.  Thou knowest, Bukta.  I have seen thee\r\nsmile behind the hand.  I know, and thou knowest.  The Bhils are\r\nmy children.  I have said it many times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay.  We be thy children,\" said Bukta.\r\n\r\n\"And no otherwise is it with Jan Chinn, my father's father.  He\r\nwould see the land he loved and the people once again.  It is a\r\ngood ghost, Bukta.  I say it. Go and tell them.  And I do hope\r\ndevoutly,\" he added, \"that it will calm 'em down.\" Flinging back\r\nthe tiger-skin, he rose with a long, unguarded yawn that showed\r\nhis well-kept teeth.\r\n\r\nBukta fled, to be received in the lines by a knot of panting\r\ninquirers.\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" said Bukta.  \"He wrapped him-self in the skin, and\r\nspoke from it.  He would see his own country again. The sign is\r\nnot for us; and, indeed, he is a young man. How should he lie\r\nidle of nights? He says his bed is too hot and the air is bad.\r\nHe goes to and fro for the love of night-running.  He has said\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThe grey-whiskered assembly shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"He says the Bhils are his children.  Ye know he does not lie.\r\nHe has said it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what of the Satpura Bhils?  What means the sign for them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.  It is only night-running, as I have said.  He rides to\r\nsee if they obey the Government, as he taught them to do in his\r\nfirst life.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what if they do not?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not say.\"\r\n\r\nThe light went out in Chinn's quarters.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" said Bukta.  \"Now he goes away. None the less it is a\r\ngood ghost, as he has said. How shall we fear Jan Chinn, who\r\nmade the Bhil a man? His protection is on us; and ye know Jan\r\nChinn never broke a protection  spoken or written on paper.\r\nWhen he is older and has found him a wife he will lie in his bed\r\ntill morning.\"\r\n\r\nA commanding officer is generally aware of the regimental state\r\nof mind a little before the men; and this is why the Colonel\r\nsaid, a few days later, that some one had been putting the Fear\r\nof God into the Wuddars.  As he was the only person officially\r\nentitled to do this, it distressed him to see such unanimous\r\nvirtue.  \"It's too good to last,\" he said.  \"I only wish I could\r\nfind out what the little chaps mean.\"\r\n\r\nThe explanation, as it seemed to him, came at the change of the\r\nmoon, when he received orders to hold himself in readiness to\r\n\"allay any possible excitement\" among the Satpura Bhils, who\r\nwere, to put it mildly, uneasy because a paternal Government had\r\nsent up against them a Mahratta State-educated vaccinator, with\r\nlancets, lymph, and an officially registered calf.  In the\r\nlanguage of State, they had \"manifested a strong objection to\r\nall prophylactic measures,\" had \"forcibly detained the\r\nvaccinator,\" and \"were on the point of neglecting or evading\r\ntheir tribal obligations.\"\r\n\r\n\"That means they are in a blue funk - same as they were at\r\ncensus-time,\" said the Colonel; \"and if we stampede them into\r\nthe hills we'll never catch 'em, in the first place, and, in the\r\nsecond, they'll whoop off plundering till further orders.\r\n'Wonder who the God-forsaken idiot is who is trying to vaccinate\r\na Bhil.  I knew trouble was coming.  One good thing is that\r\nthey'll only use local corps, and we can knock up something\r\nwe'll call a campaign, and let them down easy. Fancy us potting\r\nour best beaters because they don't want to be vaccinated!\r\nThey're only crazy with fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think, sir,\" said Chinn, the next day, \"that perhaps\r\nyou could give me a fortnight's shooting-leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Desertion in the face of the enemy, by Jove!\" The Colonel\r\nlaughed. \"I might, but I'd have to antedate it a little, because\r\nwe're warned for service, as you might say. However, we'll assume\r\nthat you applied for leave three days ago, and are now well on\r\nyour way south.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to take Bukta with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, yes.  I think that will be the best plan. You've some\r\nkind of hereditary influence with the little chaps, and they may\r\nlisten to you when a glimpse of our uniforms would drive them\r\nwild.  You've never been in that part of the world before, have\r\nyou? Take care they don't send you to your family vault in your\r\nyouth and innocence. I believe you'll be all right if you can get\r\n'em to listen to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so, sir; but if -- if they should accidentally put an\r\n-- make asses of 'emselves -- they might, you know -- I hope\r\nyou'll represent that they were only frightened. There isn't an\r\nounce of real vice in 'em, and I should never forgive myself if\r\nany one of -- of my name got them into trouble.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel nodded, but said nothing.\r\n\r\nChinn and Bukta departed at once. Bukta did not say that, ever\r\nsince the official vaccinator had been dragged into the hills by\r\nindignant Bhils, runner after runner had skulked up to the\r\nlines, entreating, with forehead in the dust, that Jan Chinn\r\nshould come and explain this unknown horror that hung over his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe portent of the Clouded Tiger was now too clear.  Let Jan\r\nChinn comfort his own, for vain was the help of mortal man.\r\nBukta toned down these beseechings to a simple request for\r\nChinn's presence.  Nothing would have pleased the old man better\r\nthan a rough-and-tumble campaign against the Satpuras, whom he,\r\nas an \"unmixed\" Bhil, despised; but he had a duty to all his\r\nnation as Jan Chinn's interpreter; and he devoutly believed that\r\nforty plagues would fall on his village if he tampered with that\r\nobligation.  Besides, Jan Chinn knew all things, and he rode the\r\nClouded Tiger.\r\n\r\nThey covered thirty miles a day on foot and pony, raising the\r\nblue wall-like line of the Satpuras as swiftly as might be.\r\nBukta was very silent.\r\n\r\nThey began the steep climb a little after noon, but it was near\r\nsunset ere they reached the stone platform clinging to the side\r\nof a rifted, jungle-covered hill, where Jan Chinn the First was\r\nlaid, as he had desired, that he might overlook his people.  All\r\nIndia is full of neglected graves that date from the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century - tombs of forgotten colonels of corps\r\nlong since disbanded; mates of East India men who went on\r\nshooting expeditions and never came back; factors, agents,\r\nwriters, and ensigns of the Honourable the East India Company by\r\nhundreds and thousands and tens of thousands.  English folk\r\nforget quickly, but natives have long memories, and if a man has\r\ndone good in his life it is remembered after his death.  The\r\nweathered marble four-square tomb of Jan Chinn was hung about\r\nwith wild flowers and nuts, packets of wax and honey, bottles of\r\nnative spirits, and infamous cigars, with buffalo horns and\r\nplumes of dried grass.  At one end was a rude clay image of a\r\nwhite man, in the old-fashioned top-hat, riding on a bloated\r\ntiger.\r\n\r\nBukta salamed reverently as they approached. Chinn bared his head\r\nand began to pick out the blurred inscription.  So far as he\r\ncould read it ran thus - word for word, and letter for letter:\r\n\r\nTo the Memory of JOHN CHINN, Esq.

As much as Chinn could decipher said:\r\n\r\n..the savage band.  Forsook their Haunts and b.....is\r\nComman..mended..rals check a.st for spoil.  And.. a..ing Hamlets\r\nprove his gene....toil.

He must have been worth knowing. . . . Bukta,\r\nwhere are my people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not here, Sahib.  No man comes here except in full sun.  They\r\nwait above.  Let us climb and see.\"\r\n\r\nBut Chinn, remembering the first law of Oriental diplomacy, in an\r\neven voice answered: \"I have come this far only because the\r\nSatpura folk are foolish, and dared not visit our lines.  Now\r\nbid them wait on me here.  I am not a servant, but the master of\r\nBhils.\"\r\n\r\n\"I go -- I go,\" clucked the old man.  Night was falling, and at\r\nany moment Jan Chinn might whistle up his dreaded steed from the\r\ndarkening scrub.\r\n\r\nNow for the first time in a long life Bukta disobeyed a lawful\r\ncommand and deserted his leader; for he did not come back, but\r\npressed to the flat table-top of the hill, and called softly.\r\nMen stirred all about him - little trembling men with bows and\r\narrows who had watched the two since noon.\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\" whispered one.\r\n\r\n\"At his own place. He bids you come,\" said Bukta.\r\n\r\n\"Now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather let him loose the Clouded Tiger upon us. We do not go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I, though I bore him in my arms when he was a child in this\r\nhis life. Wait here till the day.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely he will be angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will be very angry, for he has nothing to eat. But he has\r\nsaid to me many times that the Bhils are his children. By\r\nsunlight I believe this, but - by moonlight I am not so sure.\r\nWhat folly have ye Satpura pigs compassed that ye should need\r\nhim at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"One came to us in the name of the Government with little\r\nghost-knives and a magic calf, meaning to turn us into cattle by\r\nthe cutting off of our arms. We were greatly afraid, but we did\r\nnot kill the man. He is here, bound - a black man; and we think\r\nhe comes from the west. He said it was an order to cut us all\r\nwith knives - especially the women and the children. We did not\r\nhear that it was an order, so we were afraid, and kept to our\r\nhills. Some of our men have taken ponies and bullocks from the\r\nplains, and others pots and cloths and ear-rings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are any slain?\"\r\n\r\n\"By our men? Not yet. But the young men are blown to and fro by\r\nmany rumours like flames upon a hill.  I sent runners asking for\r\nJan Chinn lest worse should come to us.  It was this fear that he\r\nforetold by the sign of the Clouded Tiger.\r\n\r\nHe says it is otherwise,\" said Bukta; and he repeated, with\r\namplifications, all that young Chinn had told him at the\r\nconference of the wicker chair.\r\n\r\n\"Think you,\" said the questioner, at last, \"that the Government\r\nwill  lay hands on us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" Bukta rejoined. \"Jan Chinn will give an order, and ye\r\nwill obey. The rest is between the Government and Jan Chinn.  I\r\nmyself know something of the ghost-knives and the scratching. It\r\nis a charm against the Small-pox. But how it is done I cannot\r\ntell. Nor need that concern you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he stands by us and before the anger of the Government we\r\nwill most strictly obey Jan Chinn, except - except we do not go\r\ndown to that place to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThey could hear young Chinn below them shouting for Bukta; but\r\nthey cowered and sat still, expecting the Clouded Tiger. The\r\ntomb had been holy ground for nearly half a century. If Jan\r\nChinn chose to sleep there, who had better right? But they would\r\nnot come within eyeshot of the place till broad day.\r\n\r\nAt first Chinn was exceedingly angry, till it occurred to him\r\nthat Bukta most probably had a reason (which, indeed, he had),\r\nand his own dignity might suffer if he yelled without answer.\r\nHe propped himself against the foot of the grave, and,\r\nalternately dozing and smoking, came through the warm night proud\r\nthat he was a lawful, legitimate, fever-proof Chinn.\r\n\r\nHe prepared his plan of action much as his grandfather would have\r\ndone; and when Bukta appeared in the morning with a most liberal\r\nsupply of food, said nothing of the overnight desertion. Bukta\r\nwould have been relieved by an outburst of human anger; but Chinn\r\nfinished his victual leisurely, and a cheroot, ere he made any\r\nsign.\r\n\r\nThey are very much afraid,\" said Bukta, who was not too bold\r\nhimself \"It remains only to give orders. They said they will\r\nobey if thou wilt only stand between them and the Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I know,\" said Chinn, strolling slowly to the table-land. A\r\nfew of the elder men stood in an irregular semicircle in an open\r\nglade; but the ruck of people - women and children  were hidden\r\nin the thicket. They had no desire to face the first anger of Jan\r\nChinn the First.\r\n\r\nSeating himself on a fragment of split rock, he smoked his\r\ncheroot  to the butt, hearing men breathe hard all about him.\r\nThen he cried, so suddenly that they jumped:\r\n\r\n\"Bring the man that was bound!\"\r\n\r\nA scuffle and a cry were followed by the appearance of a Hindoo\r\nvaccinator, quaking with fear, bound hand and foot, as the Bhils\r\nof old were accustomed to bind their human sacrifices. He was\r\npushed cautiously before the presence; but young Chinn did not\r\nlook at him.\r\n\r\n\"I said - the man that was bound. Is it a jest to bring me one\r\ntied like a buffalo? Since when could the Bhil bind folk at his\r\npleasure? Cut!\"\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen hasty knives cut away the thongs, and the man\r\ncrawled to Chinn, who pocketed his case of lancets and tubes of\r\nlymph. Then, sweeping the semicircle with one comprehensive\r\nforefinger, and in the voice of compliment, he said, clearly and\r\ndistinctly: \" Pigs!\r\n\r\n\"Ai!\" whispered Bukta. \"Now he speaks. Woe to foolish people!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have come on foot from my house\" (the assembly shuddered) \"to\r\nmake clear a matter which any other Satpura Bhil would have seen\r\nwith both eyes from  a distance. Ye know the Small-pox who pits\r\nand scars your children so that like wasp-combs. It is an order\r\nof the Government that whoso is  scratched on the arm with these\r\nlittle knives which I hold up is charmed against her. All Sahibs\r\nare thus charmed, and very many Hindoos. This is the mark of the\r\ncharm.  Look!\"\r\n\r\nHe rolled back his sleeve to the armpit and showed the white\r\nscars of the vaccination-mark on his white skin. \"Come, all, and\r\nlook.\"\r\n\r\nA few daring spirits came up, and nodded their heads wisely.\r\nThere was certainly a mark, and they knew well what other dread\r\nmarks were hidden by the shirt. Merciful was Jan Chinn, that\r\nthen and there proclaimed his godhead!\r\n\r\n\"Now all these things the man whom ye bound told you.\"\r\n\r\nI did - a hundred times; but they answered with blows,\" groaned\r\nthe operator, chafing his wrists and ankles.\r\n\r\n\"But, being pigs, ye did not believe; and so came I here to save\r\nyou, first from Small-pox, next from a great folly of fear, and\r\nlastly, it may be,from the rope and the jail. It is no gain to\r\nme; it is no pleasure to me: but for the sake of that one who is\r\nyonder, who made the Bhil a man\" - he pointed down the hill --\"\r\nI, who am of his blood, the son of his son, come to turn your\r\npeople. And I speak the truth, as did Jan Chinn.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd murmured reverently, and men stole out of the thicket\r\nby twos and threes to join it. There was no anger in their god's\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"These are my orders.  (Heaven send they'll take 'em, but I seem\r\nto have impressed 'em so far!) I myself will stay among you\r\nwhile this man scratches your arms with the knives, after the\r\norder of the Government. In three, or it may be five or seven,\r\ndays, your arms will swell and itch and burn. That is the power\r\nof Small-pox fighting in your base blood against the orders of\r\nthe Government I will therefore stay among you till I see that\r\nSmall-pox is conquered, and I will not go away till the men and\r\nthe women and the little children show me upon their arms such\r\nmarks as I have even now showed you. I bring with me two very\r\ngood guns, and a man whose name is known among beasts and men.\r\nWe will hunt together, I and he and your young men, and the\r\nothers shall eat and lie still. This is my order.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause while victory hung in the balance. A\r\nwhite-haired old sinner, standing on one uneasy leg, piped up:\r\n\r\n\"There are ponies and some few bullocks and other things for\r\nwhich we need a kowl [protection]. They were not taken in the\r\nway of trade.\"\r\n\r\nThe battle was won, and John Chinn drew a breath of relief. The\r\nyoung Bhils had been raiding, but if taken swiftly all could be\r\nput straight.\r\n\r\n\"I will write a kowl so soon as the ponies, the bullocks, and the\r\nother things are counted before me and sent back whence they\r\ncame. But first we will put the Government mark on such as have\r\nnot been visited by Small-pox.\" In an undertone, to the\r\nvaccinator: \"If you show you are afraid you'll never see Poona\r\nagain, my friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is not sufficient ample supply of vaccination for all this\r\npopulation,\" said the man. \"They destroyed the offeecial calf.\"\r\n\r\nThey won't know the difference. Scrape 'em and give me a couple\r\nof lancets; I'll attend to the elders.\"\r\n\r\nThe aged diplomat who had demanded protection was the first\r\nvictim. He fell to Chinn's hand and dared not cry out. As soon\r\nas he was freed he dragged up a companion, and held him fast,\r\nand the crisis became, as it were, a child's sport; for the\r\nvaccinated chased the unvaccinated to treatment, vowing that all\r\nthe tribe must suffer equally.  The women shrieked, and the\r\nchildren ran howling; but Chinn laughed, and waved the\r\npink-tipped lancet.\r\n\r\n\"It is an honour,\" he cried.  \"Tell them, Bukta, how great an\r\nhonour it is that I myself mark them.  Nay, I cannot mark every\r\none - the Hindoo must also do his work - but I will touch all\r\nmarks that he makes, so there will be an equal virtue in them.\r\nThus do the Rajputs stick pigs. Ho, brother with one eye! Catch\r\nthat girl and bring her to me. She need not run away yet, for\r\nshe is not married, and I do not seek her in marriage. She will\r\nnot come?  Then she shall be shamed by her little brother, a fat\r\nboy, a bold boy. He puts out his arm like a soldier. Look! He\r\ndoes not flinch at the blood. Some day he shall be in my\r\nregiment. And now, mother of many, we will lightly touch thee,\r\nfor Smallpox has been before us here. It is a true thing,\r\nindeed, that this charm breaks the power of Mata. There will be\r\nno more pitted faces among the Satpuras, and so ye can ask many\r\ncows for each maid to be wed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on and so on - quick-poured showman's patter, sauced in\r\nthe Bhil hunting-proverbs and tales of their own brand of coarse\r\nhumour till the lancets were blunted and both operators worn out.\r\n\r\nBut, nature being the same the world over, the unvaccinated grew\r\njealous of their marked comrades, and came near to blows about\r\nit. Then Chinn declared himself a court of justice, no longer a\r\nmedical board, and made formal inquiry into the late robberies.\r\n\r\n\"We are the thieves of Mahadeo,\" said the Bhils, simply. \"It is\r\nour fate, and we were frightened. When we are frightened we\r\nalways steal.\"\r\n\r\nSimply and directly as children, they gave in the tale of the\r\nplunder, all but two bullocks and some spirits that had gone\r\namissing (these Chinn promised to make good out of his own\r\npocket), and ten ringleaders were despatched to the lowlands\r\nwith a wonderful document, written on the leaf of a note-book,\r\nand addressed to an Assistant District Superintendent of Police.\r\nThere was warm calamity in that note, as Jan Chinn warned them,\r\nbut anything was better  than loss of liberty.\r\n\r\nArmed with this protection, the repentant raiders went down-hill.\r\nThey had no desire whatever to meet Mr. Dundas Fawne of the\r\nPolice, aged twenty-two, and of a cheerful countenance, nor did\r\nthey wish to revisit the scene of their robberies. Steering a\r\nmiddle course, they ran into the camp of the one Government\r\nchaplain allowed to the various irregular corps through a\r\ndistrict of some fifteen thousand square miles, and stood before\r\nhim in a cloud of dust. He was by way of being a priest, they\r\nknew, and, what was more to the point, a good sportsman who paid\r\nhis beaters generously.\r\n\r\nWhen he read Chinn's note he laughed, which they deemed a lucky\r\nomen, till he called up policemen, who tethered the ponies and\r\nthe bullocks by the piled house-gear, and laid stern hands upon\r\nthree of that smiling band of the thieves of Mahadeo.  The\r\nchaplain himself addressed them magisterially with a\r\nriding-whip. That was painful, but Jan Chinn had prophesied it.\r\nThey submitted, but would not give up the written protection,\r\nfearing the jail.  On their way back they met Mr. D. Fawne, who\r\nhad heard about the robberies, and was not pleased.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said the eldest of the gang, when the second\r\ninterview was at an end, \"certainly Jan Chinn's protection has\r\nsaved us our liberty, but it is as though there were many\r\nbeatings in one small piece of paper.  Put it away.\"\r\n\r\nOne climbed into a tree, and stuck the letter into a cleft forty\r\nfeet from the ground, where it could do no harm.  Warmed, sore,\r\nbut happy, the ten returned to Jan Chinn next day, where he sat\r\namong uneasy Bhils, all looking at their right arms, and all\r\nbound under terror of their god's disfavour not to scratch.\r\n\r\n\"It was a good kowl,\" said the leader. \"First the chaplain, who\r\nlaughed, took away our plunder, and beat three of us, as was\r\npromised. Next, we meet Fawne Sahib, who frowned, and asked for\r\nthe plunder. We spoke the truth, and so he beat us all, one\r\nafter another, and called us chosen names. He then gave us these\r\ntwo bundles \"-they set down a bottle of whisky and a box of\r\ncheroots--\" and we came away.  The kowl is left in a tree,\r\nbecause its virtue is that so soon as we show it to a Sahib we\r\nare beaten.\"\r\n\r\n\"But for that kowl\" said Jan Chinn, sternly, \"ye would all have\r\nbeen marching to jail with a policeman on either side.  Ye come\r\nnow to serve as beaters for me.  These people are unhappy, and\r\nwe will go hunting till they are well. To-night we will make a\r\nfeast.\"\r\n\r\nIt is written in the chronicles of the Satpura Bhils, together\r\nwith many other matters not fit for print, that through five\r\ndays, after the day that he had put his mark upon them, Jan\r\nChinn the First hunted for his people; and on the five nights of\r\nthose days the tribe was gloriously and entirely drunk. Jan\r\nChinn bought country spirits of an awful strength, and slew wild\r\npig and deer beyond counting, so that if any fell sick they might\r\nhave two good reasons.\r\n\r\nBetween head- and stomach-aches they found no time to think of\r\ntheir arms, but followed Jan Chinn obediently through the\r\njungles, and with each day's returning confidence men, women,\r\nand children stole away to their villages as the little army\r\npassed by.  They carried news that it was good and right to be\r\nscratched with ghost-knives; that Jan Chinn was indeed\r\nreincarnated as a god of free food and drink, and that of all\r\nnations the Satpura Bhils stood first in his favour, if they\r\nwould only refrain from scratching.  Henceforward that kindly\r\ndemi-god would be connected in their minds with great gorgings\r\nand the vaccine and lancets of a paternal Government.\r\n\r\n\"And to-morrow I go back to my home,\" said Jan Chinn to his\r\nfaithful few, whom neither spirits, overeating, nor swollen\r\nglands could conquer. It is hard for children and savages to\r\nbehave reverently at all times to the idols of their\r\nmake-belief; and they had frolicked excessively with Jan Chinn.\r\nBut the reference to his home cast a gloom on the people.\r\n\r\n\"And the Sahib will not come again?\" said he who had been\r\nvaccinated first.\r\n\r\n\"That is to be seen,\" answered Chinn, warily.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but come as a white man -- come as a young man whom we know\r\nand love; for, as thou alone knowest, we are a weak people. If\r\nwe again saw thy -- thy horse -\" They were picking up their\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n\"I have no horse. I came on foot with Bukta, yonder.  What is\r\nthis?\"\"Thou knowest - the thing that thou hast chosen for a\r\nnight-horse.\"  The little men squirmed in fear and awe.\r\n\r\n\"Night-horses?  Bukta, what is this last tale of children?\"\r\n\r\nBukta had been a silent leader in Chinn's presence since the\r\nnight of his desertion, and was grateful for a chance-flung\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThey know, Sahib,\" he whispered.  \"It is the Clouded Tiger. That\r\nthat comes from the place where thou didst once sleep. It is thy\r\nhorse - as it has been these three generations.\"\r\n\r\n\"My horse! That was a dream of the Bhils.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no dream. Do dreams leave the tracks of broad pugs on\r\nearth? Why make two faces before thy people? They know of the\r\nnight-ridings, and they - and they - \"\r\n\r\n\"Are afraid, and would have them cease.\"\r\n\r\nBukta nodded. \"If thou hast no further need of him. He is thy\r\nhorse.\"\r\n\r\n\"The thing leaves a trail, then?\" said Chinn.\r\n\r\n\"We have seen it. It is like a village road under the tomb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can ye find and follow it for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"By daylight - if one comes with us, and, above all, stands near\r\nby.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will stand close, and we will see to it that Jan Chinn does\r\nnot ride any more.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bhils shouted the last words again and again.\r\n\r\n>From Chinn's point of view the stalk was nothing more than an\r\nordinary one - down-hill, through split and crannied rocks,\r\nunsafe, perhaps, if a man did not keep his wits by him, but no\r\nworse than twenty others he had undertaken. Yet his men - they\r\nrefused absolutely to beat, and would only trail - dripped sweat\r\nat every move. They showed the marks of enormous pugs that ran,\r\nalways down-hill, to a few hundred feet below Jan Chinn's tomb,\r\nand disappeared in a narrow-mouthed cave. It was an insolently\r\nopen road, a domestic highway, beaten without thought of\r\nconcealment.\r\n\r\n\"The beggar might be paying rent and taxes,\" Chinn muttered ere\r\nhe asked whether his friend's taste ran to cattle or man.\r\n\r\n\"Cattle,\" was the answer. \"Two heifers a week. We drive them for\r\nhim at the foot of the hill. It is his custom. If we did not, he\r\nmight seek us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blackmail and piracy,\" said Chinn.  \"I can't say I fancy going\r\ninto the cave after him. What's to be done?\"\r\n\r\nThe Bhils fell back as Chinn lodged himself behind a rock with\r\nhis rifle ready. Tigers, he knew, were shy beasts, but one who\r\nhad been long cattle-fed in this sumptuous style might prove\r\noverbold.\r\n\r\n\"He speaks!\" some one whispered from the rear. \"He knows, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, of all the infernal cheek!\" said Chinn. There was an angry\r\ngrowl from the cave - a direct challenge.\r\n\r\n\"Come out, then,\" Chinn shouted. \"Come out of that. Let's have a\r\nlook at you.\"The brute knew well enough that there was some\r\nconnection between brown nude Bhils and his weekly allowance;\r\nbut the white helmet in the sunlight annoyed him, and he did not\r\napprove of the voice that broke his rest. Lazily as a gorged\r\nsnake, he dragged himself out of the cave, and stood yawning and\r\nblinking at the entrance. The sunlight fell upon his flat right\r\nside, and  Chinn wondered. Never had he seen a tiger marked\r\nafter this fashion. Except for his head, which was staringly\r\nbarred, he was dappled - not striped, but dappled like a child's\r\nrocking-horse in rich shades of smoky black on red gold. That\r\nportion of his belly and throat which should have been white was\r\norange, and his tail and paws were black.\r\n\r\nHe looked leisurely for some ten seconds, and then deliberately\r\nlowered his head, his chin dropped and drawn in, staring\r\nintently at the man. The effect of this was to throw forward the\r\nround arch of his skull, with two broad bands across it, while\r\nbelow the bands glared the unwinking eyes; so that, head on, as\r\nhe stood, he showed something like a diabolically scowling\r\npantomime-mask. It was a piece of natural mesmerism that he had\r\npractised many times on his quarry, and though Chinn was by no\r\nmeans a terrified heifer, he stood for a while, held by the\r\nextraordinary oddity of the attack. The head - the body seemed to\r\nhave been packed away behind it - the ferocious, skull-like head,\r\ncrept nearer to the switching of an angry tail-tip in the grass.\r\nLeft and right the Bhils had scattered to let John Chinn subdue\r\nhis own horse.\"My word!\" he thought. \"He's trying to frighten\r\nme!\" and fired between the saucer-like eyes, leaping aside upon\r\nthe shot.\r\n\r\nA big coughing mass, reeking of carrion, bounded past him up the\r\nhill, and he followed discreetly. The tiger made no attempt to\r\nturn into the jungle; he was hunting for sight and breath - nose\r\nup, mouth open, the tremendous fore-legs scattering the gravel in\r\nspurts.\r\n\r\nScuppered!\" said John Chinn, watching the flight.  \"Now if he was\r\na partridge he'd tower. Lungs must be full of blood.\"\r\n\r\nThe brute had jerked himself over a boulder and fallen out of\r\nsight the other side. John Chinn looked over with a ready\r\nbarrel. But the red trail led straight as an arrow even to his\r\ngrandfather's tomb, and there, among the smashed spirit-bottles\r\nand the fragments of the mud image, the life left, with  a flurry\r\nand a grunt.\r\n\r\n\"If my worthy ancestor could see that,\" said John Chinn, \"he'd\r\nhave been proud of me. Eyes, lower jaw, and lungs. A very nice\r\nshot.\" He whistled for Bukta as he drew the tape over the\r\nstiffening bulk.\r\n\r\n\"Ten - six - eight - by Jove!  It's nearly eleven - call it\r\neleven.  Fore-arm, twenty-four -five - seven and a half. A short\r\ntail, too: three feet one. But what a skin! Oh, Bukta! Bukta! The\r\nmen with the knives swiftly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he beyond question dead?\" said an awe-stricken voice behind a\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n\"That was not the way I killed my first tiger,\" said Chinn. \"I\r\ndid not think that Bukta would run. I had no second gun.\"\r\n\r\n\"It - it is the Clouded Tiger,\" said Bukta, un-heeding the taunt.\r\n\"He is dead.\"\r\n\r\nWhether all the Bhils, vaccinated and unvaccinated, of the\r\nSatpuras had lain by to see the kill, Chinn could not say; but\r\nthe whole hill's flank rustled with little men, shouting,\r\nsinging, and stamping. And yet, till he had made the first cut\r\nin the splendid skin, not a man would take a knife; and, when the\r\nshadows fell, they ran from the red-stained tomb, and no\r\npersuasion would bring them back till dawn. So Chinn spent a\r\nsecond night in the open, guarding the carcass from jackals, and\r\nthinking about his ancestor.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the lowlands to the triumphal chant of an\r\nescorting army three hundred strong, the Mahratta vaccinator\r\nclose at his elbow, and the rudely dried skin a trophy before\r\nhim. When that army suddenly and noiselessly disappeared, as\r\nquail in high corn, he argued he was near civilisation, and a\r\nturn in the road brought him upon the camp of a wing of his own\r\ncorps. He left the skin on a cart-tail for the world to see, and\r\nsought the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"They're perfectly right,\" he explained earnestly. \"There isn't\r\nan ounce of vice in 'em. They were only frightened. I've\r\nvaccinated the whole boiling, and they like it awfully. What are\r\n- what are we doing here, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I'm trying to find out,\" said the Colonel. \"I don't\r\nknow yet whether we're a piece of a brigade or a police force.\r\nHowever, I think we'll call ourselves a police force. How did\r\nyou manage to get a Bhil vaccinated?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" said Chinn, \" I've been thinking it over, and, as\r\nfar as I can make out, I've got a sort of hereditary influence\r\nover 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I know, or I wouldn't have sent you; but what, exactly?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's rather rummy.  It seems, from what I can make out, that I'm\r\nmy own grandfather reincarnated, and I've been disturbing the\r\npeace of the country by riding a pad-tiger of nights. If I\r\nhadn't done that, I don't think they'd have objected to the\r\nvaccination; but the two together were more than they could\r\nstand. And so, sir, I've vaccinated 'em, and shot my tiger-horse\r\nas a sort o' proof of good faith. You never saw such a skin in\r\nyour life.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel tugged his moustache thought-fully. \"Now, how the\r\ndeuce,\" said he, \"am I to include that in my report?\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the official version of the Bhils' anti-vaccination\r\nstampede said nothing about Lieutenant John Chinn, his godship.\r\nBut Bukta knew, and the corps knew, and every Bhil in the\r\nSatpura hills knew.\r\n\r\nAnd now Bukta is zealous that John Chinn shall swiftly be wedded\r\nand impart his powers to a son; for if the Chinn succession\r\nfails, and the little Bhils are left to their own imaginings,\r\nthere will be fresh trouble in the Satpuras.\r\n\r\nEnd of, \"THE TOMB OF HIS ANCESTORS\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL AND THE DEEP SEA\r\n\r\nAll supplies very bad and dear, and there are no facilities for\r\neven the smallest repairs. - Sailing Directions.\r\n\r\nHer nationality was British, but you will not find her house-flag\r\nin the list of our mercantile marine. She was a\r\nnine-hundred-ton, iron, schooner-rigged, screw cargo-boat,\r\ndiffering externally in no way from any other tramp of the sea.\r\nBut it is with steamers as it is with men. There are those who\r\nwill for a consideration sail extremely close to the wind; and,\r\nin the present state of a fallen world, such people and such\r\nsteamers have their use. From the hour that the Aglaia first\r\nentered the Clyde -- new, shiny, and innocent, with a quart of\r\ncheap champagne trickling down her cut-water -- Fate and her\r\nowner, who was also her captain, decreed that she should deal\r\nwith embarrassed crowned heads, fleeing Presidents, financiers\r\nof over-extended ability, women to whom change of air was\r\nimperative, and the lesser law-breaking Powers. Her career led\r\nher sometimes into the Admiralty Courts, where the sworn\r\nstatements of her skipper filled his brethren with envy.  The\r\nmariner cannot tell or act a lie in the face of the sea, or\r\nmis-lead a tempest; but, as lawyers have discovered, he makes up\r\nfor chances withheld when he returns to shore, an affidavit in\r\neither hand.\r\n\r\nThe Aglaia figured with distinction in the great Mackinaw\r\nsalvage-case. It was her first slip from virtue, and she learned\r\nhow to change her name, but not her heart, and to run across the\r\nsea. As the Guiding Light  she was very badly wanted in a South\r\nAmerican port for the little matter of entering harbour at full\r\nspeed, colliding with a coal-hulk and the State's only\r\nman-of-war, just as that man-of-war was going to coal.  She put\r\nto sea without explanations, though three forts fired at her for\r\nhalf an hour. As the Julia M'Gregor she had been concerned in\r\npicking up from a raft certain gentlemen who should have stayed\r\nin Noumea, but who preferred making themselves vastly unpleasant\r\nto authority in quite another quarter of the world; and as the\r\nShah-in-Shah she had been overtaken on the high seas, indecently\r\nfull of munitions of war, by the cruiser of an agitated Power at\r\nissue with its neighbour. That time she was very nearly sunk, and\r\nher riddled hull gave eminent lawyers of two countries great\r\nprofit.  After a season she reappeared as the Martin Hunt painted\r\na dull slate-colour, with pure saffron funnel, and boats of\r\nrobin's-egg blue, engaging in the Odessa trade till she was\r\ninvited (and the invitation could not well be disregarded) to\r\nkeep away from Black Sea ports altogether.\r\n\r\nShe had ridden through many waves of depression. Freights might\r\ndrop out of sight, Seamen's Unions throw spanners and nuts at\r\ncertificated masters, or stevedores combine till cargo perished\r\non the dock-head; but the boat of many names came and went,\r\nbusy, alert, and inconspicuous always. Her skipper made no\r\ncomplaint of hard times, and port officers observed that her\r\ncrew signed and signed again with the regularity of Atlantic\r\nliner boatswains. Her name she changed as occasion called; her\r\nwell-paid crew never; and a large percentage of the profits of\r\nher voyages was spent with an open hand on her engine-room.  She\r\nnever troubled the underwriters, and very seldom stopped to talk\r\nwith a signal-station, for her business was urgent and private.\r\n\r\nBut an end came to her tradings, and she perished in this manner.\r\nDeep peace brooded over Europe, Asia, Africa, America,\r\nAustralasia, and Polynesia.  The Powers dealt together more or\r\nless honestly; banks paid their depositors to the hour; diamonds\r\nof price came safely to the hands of their owners; Republics\r\nrested content with their Dictators; diplomats found no one whose\r\npresence in the least incommoded them; monarchs lived openly with\r\ntheir lawfully wedded wives.  It was as though the whole earth\r\nhad put on its best Sunday bib and tucker; and business was very\r\nbad for the Martin Hunt. The great, virtuous calm engulfed her,\r\nslate sides, yellow funnel, and all, but cast up in another\r\nhemisphere the steam whaler Haliotis, black and rusty, with a\r\nmanure-coloured funnel, a litter of dingy white boats, and an\r\nenormous stove, or furnace, for boiling blubber on her forward\r\nwell-deck.  There could be no doubt that her trip was successful,\r\nfor she lay at several ports not too well known, and the smoke of\r\nher trying-out insulted the beaches.\r\n\r\nAnon she departed, at the speed of the average London\r\nfour-wheeler, and entered a semi-inland sea, warm, still, and\r\nblue, which is, perhaps, the most strictly preserved water in\r\nthe world. There she stayed for a certain time, and the great\r\nstars of those mild skies beheld her playing puss-in-the-corner\r\namong islands where whales are never found.  All that while she\r\nsmelt abominably, and the smell, though fishy, was not\r\nwhalesome.  One evening calamity descended upon her from the\r\nisland of Pygang-Watai, and she fled, while her crew jeered at a\r\nfat black-and-brown gunboat puffing far behind. They knew to the\r\nlast revolution the capacity of every boat, on those seas, that\r\nthey were anxious to avoid.  A British ship with a good\r\nconscience does not, as a rule, flee from the  man-of-war of a\r\nforeign Power, and it is also  considered a breach of etiquette\r\nto stop and search British ships at sea.  These things the\r\nskipper of the Haliotis did not pause to prove, but held on at an\r\ninspiriting eleven knots an hour till nightfall. One thing only\r\nhe overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe Power that kept an expensive steam-patrol moving up and down\r\nthose waters (they had dodged the two regular ships of the\r\nstation with an ease that bred contempt) had newly brought up a\r\nthird and a fourteen-knot boat with a clean bottom to help the\r\nwork; and that was why the Haliotis, driving hard from the east\r\nto the west, found herself at daylight in such a position that\r\nshe could not help seeing an arrangement of four flags, a mile\r\nand a half behind, which read:  \"Heave to, or take the\r\nconsequences!\"\r\n\r\nShe had her choice, and she took it.  The end came when,\r\npresuming on her lighter draught, she tried to draw away\r\nnorthward over a friendly shoal. The shell that arrived by way\r\nof the Chief Engineer's cabin was some five inches in diameter,\r\nwith a practice, not a bursting, charge. It had been intended to\r\ncross her bows, and that was why it knocked the framed portrait\r\nof the Chief Engineer's wife - and she was a very pretty girl -\r\non to the floor, splintered his wash-hand stand, crossed the\r\nalleyway into the engine-room, and striking on a grating, dropped\r\ndirectly in front of the forward engine, where it burst, neatly\r\nfracturing both the bolts that held the connecting-rod to the\r\nforward crank.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is worth consideration.  The forward engine had no\r\nmore work to do.  Its released piston-rod, therefore, drove up\r\nfiercely, with nothing to check it, and started most of the nuts\r\nof the cylinder-cover.  It came down again, the full weight of\r\nthe steam behind it, and the foot of the disconnected\r\nconnecting-rod, useless as the leg of a man with a sprained\r\nankle, flung out to the right and struck the starboard, or\r\nright-hand, cast-iron supporting-column of the forward engine,\r\ncracking it clean through about six inches above the base, and\r\nwedging the upper portion outwards three inches towards the\r\nship's side.  There the connecting-rod jammed.  Meantime, the\r\nafter-engine, being as yet unembarrassed, went on with its work,\r\nand in so doing brought round at its next revolution the crank of\r\nthe forward engine, which smote the already jammed\r\nconnecting-rod, bending it and therewith the piston-rod\r\ncross-head- the big cross-piece that slides up and down so\r\nsmoothly.\r\n\r\nThe cross-head jammed sideways in the guides, and, in addition to\r\nputting further pressure on the already broken starboard\r\nsupporting-column, cracked the port, or left-hand,\r\nsupporting-column in two or three places.  There being nothing\r\nmore that could be made to move, the engines brought up, all\r\nstanding, with a hiccup that seemed to lift the Haliotis a foot\r\nout of the water; and the engine-room staff, opening every steam\r\noutlet that they could find in the confusion, arrived on deck\r\nsomewhat scalded, but calm. There was a sound below of things\r\nhappening - a rushing, clicking, purring, grunting, rattling\r\nnoise that did not last for more than a minute. It was the\r\nmachinery adjusting itself, on the spur of the moment, to a\r\nhundred altered conditions. Mr. Wardrop, one foot on the upper\r\ngrating, inclined his ear sideways, and groaned.  You cannot\r\nstop engines working at twelve knots an hour in three seconds\r\nwithout disorganising them.  The Haliotis slid forward in a\r\ncloud of steam, shrieking like a wounded horse. There was\r\nnothing more to do. The five-inch shell with a reduced charge\r\nhad settled the situation. And when you are full, all three\r\nholds, of strictly preserved pearls; when you have cleaned out\r\nthe Tanna Bank, the Sea-Horse Bank, and four other banks from\r\none end to the other of the Amanala Sea -when you have ripped\r\nout the very heart of a rich Government monopoly so that five\r\nyears will not repair your wrong-doings - you must smile and\r\ntake what is in store.  But the skipper reflected, as a launch\r\nput out from the man-of-war, that he had been bombarded on the\r\nhigh seas, with the British flag - several of them -\r\npicturesquely disposed above him, and tried to find comfort from\r\nthe thought.\r\n\r\nWhere,\" said the stolid naval lieutenant hoisting himself aboard,\r\n\"where are those dam' pearls?\"\r\n\r\nThey were there beyond evasion.  No affidavit could do away with\r\nthe fearful smell of decayed oysters, the diving-dresses, and\r\nthe shell-littered hatches.  They were there to the value of\r\nseventy thousand pounds, more or less; and every pound poached.\r\n\r\nThe man-of-war was annoyed; for she had used up many tons of\r\ncoal, she had strained her tubes, and, worse than all, her\r\nofficers and crew had been hurried.  Every one on the Haliotis\r\nwas arrested and rearrested several times, as each officer came\r\naboard; then they were told by what they esteemed to be the\r\nequivalent of a midshipman that they were to consider themselves\r\nprisoners, and finally were put under arrest.\r\n\r\nIt's not the least good,\" said the skipper, suavely.  \"You'd much\r\nbetter send us a tow - \"\r\n\r\n\"Be still - you are arrest!\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Where the devil do you expect we are going to escape to?\"  We're\r\nhelpless.  You've got to tow us into somewhere, and explain why\r\nyou fired on us.  Mr. Wardrop, we're helpless, aren't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ruined from end to end,\" said the man of machinery.  \"If she\r\nrolls, the forward cylinder will come down and go through her\r\nbottom. Both columns are clean cut through.  There's nothing to\r\nhold anything up.\"\r\n\r\nThe council of war clanked off to see if Mr. Wardrop's words were\r\ntrue.  He warned them that it was as much as a man's life was\r\nworth to enter the engine-room, and they contented themselves\r\nwith a distant inspection through the thinning steam.  The\r\nHaliotis lifted to the long, easy swell, and the starboard\r\nsupporting-column ground a trifle, as a man grits his teeth\r\nunder the knife.  The forward cylinder was depending on that\r\nunknown force men call the pertinacity of materials, which now\r\nand then balances that other heartbreaking power, the perversity\r\nof inanimate things.\r\n\r\n\"You see!\" said Mr. Wardrop, hurrying them away.  \"The engines\r\naren't worth their price as old iron.\"\r\n\r\n\"We tow,\" was the answer.  \"Afterwards we shall confiscate.\"\r\n\r\nThe man-of-war was short-handed, and did not see the necessity\r\nfor putting a prize-crew aboard the Haliotis.  So she sent one\r\nsublieutenant, whom the skipper kept very drunk, for he did not\r\nwish to make the tow too easy, and, moreover, he had an\r\ninconspicuous little rope hanging from the stem of his ship.\r\n\r\nThen they began to tow at an average speed of four knots an hour.\r\nThe Haliotis was very hard to move, and the gunnery-lieutenant,\r\nwho had fired the five-inch shell, had leisure to think upon\r\nconsequences. Mr. Wardrop was the busy man. He borrowed all the\r\ncrew to shore up the cylinders with spars and blocks from the\r\nbottom and sides of the ship. It was a day's risky work; but\r\nanything was better than drowning at the end of a tow-rope; and\r\nif the forward cylinder had fallen,it would have made its way to\r\nthe sea-bed, and taken the Haliotis after.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we going to, and how long will they tow us?\" he asked\r\nof the skipper.\r\n\r\n\"God knows! and this prize-lieutenant's drunk. What do you think\r\nyou can do?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's just the bare chance,\" Mr. Wardrop whispered, though no\r\none was within hearing -\"there's just the bare chance o'\r\nrepairin' her, if a man knew how. They've twisted the very guts\r\nout of her, bringing her up with that jerk; but I'm saying that,\r\nwith time and patience, there's just the chance o' making steam\r\nyet. We could do it.\"\r\n\r\nThe skipper's eye brightened. \"Do you mean,\" he began, \"that she\r\nis any good?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said Mr. Wardrop. \"She'll need three thousand pounds in\r\nrepairs, at the lowest, if she's to take the sea again, an' that\r\napart from any injury to her structure.  She's like a man fallen\r\ndown five pair o' stairs. We can't tell for months what has\r\nhappened; but we know she'll never be good again without a new\r\ninside. Ye should see the condenser-tubes an' the steam\r\nconnections to the donkey, for two things only. I'm not afraid\r\nof them repairin' her. I'm afraid of them stealin' things.\"\r\n\r\n\"They've fired on us. They'll have to explain that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our reputation's not good enough to ask for explanations. Let's\r\ntake what we have and be thankful. Ye would not have consuls\r\nremembern' the Guidin' Light, an' the Shah-in-Shah, an' the\r\nAglaia, at this most alarmin' crisis. We've been no better than\r\npirates these ten years. Under Providence we're no worse than\r\nthieves now. We've much to be thankful for - if we e'er get back\r\nto her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make it your own way, then,\" said the skipper. \"If there's the\r\nleast chance - \"\r\n\r\n\"I'll leave none,\" said Mr. Wardrop - \"none that they'll dare to\r\ntake. Keep her heavy on the tow, for we need time.\"\r\n\r\nThe skipper never interfered with the affairs of the engine-room,\r\nand Mr. Wardrop - an artist in his profession - turned to and\r\ncomposed a work terrible and forbidding. His background was the\r\ndark-grained sides of the engine-room; his material the metals\r\nof power and strength, helped out with spars, baulks, and ropes.\r\nThe man-of-war towed sullenly and viciously. The Haliotis behind\r\nher hummed like a hive before swarming. With extra and totally\r\nunneeded spars her crew blocked up the space round the forward\r\nengine till it resembled a statue in its scaffolding, and the\r\nbutts of the shores interfered with every view that a\r\ndispassionate eye might wish to take. And that the dispassionate\r\nmind might be swiftly shaken out of its calm, the well-sunk\r\nbolts of the shores were wrapped round untidily with loose ends\r\nof ropes, giving a studied effect of most dangerous insecurity.\r\nNext, Mr. Wardrop took up a collection from the after-engine,\r\nwhich, as you will remember, had not been affected in the general\r\nwreck. The cylinder escape-valve he abolished with a\r\nflogging-hammer. It is difficult in far-off ports to come by\r\nsuch valves, unless, like Mr. Wardrop, you keep duplicates in\r\nstore. At the same time men took off the nuts of two of the\r\ngreat holding-down bolts that serve to keep the engines in place\r\non their solid bed. An engine violently arrested in mid-career\r\nmay easily jerk off the nut of a holding-down bolt, and this\r\naccident looked very natural.\r\n\r\nPassing along the tunnel, he removed several shaft coupling-bolts\r\nand -nuts, scattering other and ancient pieces of iron\r\nunderfoot. Cylinder-bolts he cut off to the number of six from\r\nthe after-engine cylinder, so that it might match its neighbour,\r\nand stuffed the bilge - and feed-pumps with cotton-waste.  Then\r\nhe made up a neat bundle of the various odds and ends that he had\r\ngathered from the engines - little things like nuts and\r\nvalve-spindles, all carefully tallowed - and retired with them\r\nunder the floor of the engine-room, where he sighed, being fat,\r\nas he passed from manhole to manhole of the double bottom, and in\r\na fairly dry submarine compartment hid them. Any engineer,\r\nparticularly in an unfriendly port, has a right to keep his spare\r\nstores where he chooses; and the foot of one of the cylinder\r\nshores blocked all entrance into the regular store-room, even if\r\nthat had not been already closed with steel wedges. In\r\nconclusion, he disconnected the after-engine, laid piston and\r\nconnecting-rod, carefully tallowed, where it would be most\r\ninconvenient to the casual visitor, took out three of the eight\r\ncollars of the thrust-block, hid them where only he could find\r\nthem again, filled the boilers by hand, wedged the sliding doors\r\nof the coal-bunkers, and rested from his labours. The\r\nengine-room was a cemetery, and it did not need the contents of\r\nthe ash-lift through the skylight to make it any worse.\r\n\r\nHe invited the skipper to look at the completed work.\r\n\r\nSaw ye ever such a forsaken wreck as that ?\" said he, proudly.\r\n\"It almost frights me to go under those shores. Now, what d' you\r\nthink they'll do to us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait till we see,\" said the skipper. \" It'll be bad enough when\r\nit comes.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not wrong. The pleasant days of towing ended all too soon,\r\nthough the Haliotis trailed behind her a heavily weighted jib\r\nstayed out into the shape of a pocket; and Mr. Wardrop was no\r\nlonger an artist of imagination, but one of seven-and-twenty\r\nprisoners in a prison full of insects. The man-of-war had towed\r\nthem to the nearest port, not to the headquarters of the colony,\r\nand when Mr. Wardrop saw the dismal little harbour, with its\r\nragged line of Chinese junks, its one crazy tug, and the\r\nboat-building shed that, under the charge of a philosophical\r\nMalay, represented a dockyard, he sighed and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I did well,\" he said. \"This is the habitation o' wreckers an'\r\nthieves. We're at the uttermost ends of the earth. Think you\r\nthey'll ever know in England?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't look like it,\" said the skipper.\r\n\r\nThey were marched ashore with what they stood up in, under a\r\ngenerous escort, and were judged according to the customs of the\r\ncountry, which, though excellent, are a little out of date.\r\nThere were the pearls; there were the poachers; and there sat a\r\nsmall but hot Governor. He consulted for a while, and then\r\nthings began to move with speed, for he did not wish to keep a\r\nhungry crew at large on the beach, and the man-of-war had gone\r\nup the coast.  With a wave of his hand - a stroke of the pen was\r\nnot necessary - he consigned them to the black gang-tana, the\r\nback-country, and the hand of the Law removed them from his\r\nsight and the knowledge of men.  They were marched into the\r\npalms, and the back-country swallowed them up - all the crew of\r\nthe Haliotis.\r\n\r\nDeep peace continued to brood over Europe, Asia, Africa, America,\r\n\r\nAustralasia, and Polynesia.\r\n\r\nIt was the firing that did it. They should have kept their\r\ncounsel; but when a few thousand foreigners are bursting with\r\njoy over the fact that a ship under the British flag has been\r\nfired at on the high seas, news travels quickly; and when it\r\ncame out that the pearl-stealing crew had not been allowed access\r\nto their consul (there was no consul within a few hundred miles\r\nof that lonely port) even the friendliest of Powers has a right\r\nto ask questions.  The great heart of the British public was\r\nbeating furiously on account of the performance of a notorious\r\nrace-horse, and had not a throb to waste on distant accidents;\r\nbut somewhere deep in the hull of the ship of State there is\r\nmachinery which more or less accurately takes charge of foreign\r\naffairs. That machinery began to revolve, and who so shocked and\r\nsurprised as the Power that had captured the Haliotis? It\r\nexplained that colonial governors and far-away men-of-war were\r\ndifficult to control, and promised that it would most certainly\r\nmake an example both of the Governor and the vessel.  As for the\r\ncrew reported to be pressed into military service in tropical\r\nclimes, it would produce them as soon as possible, and it would\r\napologise, if necessary.  Now, no apologies were needed.  When\r\none nation apologises to an-other, millions of amateurs who have\r\nno earthly concern with the difficulty hurl themselves into the\r\nstrife and embarrass the trained specialist. It was requested\r\nthat the crew be found, if they were still alive - they had been\r\neight months beyond knowledge - and it was promised that all\r\nwould be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe little Governor of the little port was pleased with himself.\r\nSeven-and-twenty white men made a very compact force to throw\r\naway on a war that had neither beginning nor end - a jungle and\r\nstockade fight that flickered and smouldered through the wet hot\r\nyears in the hills a hundred miles away, and was the heritage of\r\nevery wearied official.  He had, he thought, deserved well of his\r\ncountry; and if only some one would buy the unhappy Haliotis,\r\nmoored in the harbour below his verandah, his cup would be full.\r\nHe looked at the neatly silvered lamps that he had taken from her\r\ncabins, and thought of much that might be turned to account.  But\r\nhis countrymen in that moist climate had no spirit.  They would\r\npeep into the silent engine-room, and shake their heads.  Even\r\nthe men-of-war would not tow her further up the coast, where the\r\nGovernor believed that she could be repaired.  She was a bad\r\nbargain; but her cabin carpets were undeniably beautiful, and his\r\nwife approved of her mirrors.\r\n\r\nThree hours later cables were bursting round him like shells,\r\nfor, though he knew it not, he was being offered as a sacrifice\r\nby the nether to the upper millstone, and his superiors had no\r\nregard for his feelings.  He had, said the cables, grossly\r\nexceeded his power, and failed to report on events. He would,\r\ntherefore - at this he cast himself back in his hammock -\r\nproduce the crew of the Haliotis.  He would send for them, and,\r\nif that failed, he would put his dignity on a pony and fetch\r\nthem himself. He had no conceivable right to make pearl-poachers\r\nserve in any war. He would be held responsible.\r\n\r\nNext morning the cables wished to know whether he had found the\r\ncrew of the Haliotis. They were to be found, freed and fed - he\r\nwas to feed them - till such time as they could be sent to the\r\nnearest English port in a man-of-war. If you abuse a man long\r\nenough in great words flashed over the sea-beds, things happen.\r\nThe Governor sent inland swiftly for his prisoners, who were\r\nalso soldiers; and never was a militia regiment more anxious to\r\nreduce its strength. No power short of death could make these\r\nmad men wear the uniform of their service.  They would not\r\nfight, except with their fellows, and it was for that reason the\r\nregiment had not gone to war, but stayed in a stockade,\r\nreasoning with the new troops.  The autumn campaign had been a\r\nfiasco, but here were the Englishmen.  All the regiment marched\r\nback to guard them, and the hairy enemy, armed with blow-pipes,\r\nrejoiced in the forest. Five of the crew had died, but there\r\nlined up on the Governor's verandah two-and-twenty men marked\r\nabout the legs with the scars of leech-bites.  A few of them\r\nwore fringes that had once been trousers; the others used\r\nloin-cloths of gay patterns; and they existed beautifully but\r\nsimply in the Governor's verandah, and when he came out they\r\nsang at him.  When you have lost seventy thousand pounds' worth\r\nof pearls, your pay, your ship, and all your clothes, and have\r\nlived in bondage for five months beyond the faintest pretences\r\nof civilisation, you know what true independence means, for you\r\nbecome the happiest of created things - natural man.\r\n\r\nThe Governor told the crew that they were evil, and they asked\r\nfor food. When he saw how they ate, and when he remembered that\r\nnone of the pearl patrol-boats were expected for two months, he\r\nsighed. But the crew of the Haliotis lay down in the verandah,\r\nand said that they were pensioners of the Governor's bounty.  A\r\ngrey-bearded man, fat and bald-headed, his one garment a\r\ngreen-and-yellow loin-cloth, saw the Haliotis in the harbour,\r\nand bellowed for joy. The men crowded to the verandah-rail,\r\nkicking aside the long cane chairs. They pointed,  gesticulated,\r\nand argued freely, without shame. The militia regiment sat down\r\nin the Governor's garden. The Governor retired to his hammock -\r\nit was as easy to be killed lying as standing-and his women\r\nsqueaked from the shuttered rooms.\r\n\r\n\"She sold?\" said the grey~bearded man, pointing to the Haliotis.\r\nHe was Mr. Wardrop.\r\n\r\n\"No good,\" said the Governor, shaking his head. \"No one come\r\nbuy.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's taken my lamps, though,\" said the skipper. He wore one leg\r\nof a pair of trousers, and his eye wandered along the verandah.\r\nThe Governor quailed. There were cuddy camp-stools and the\r\nskipper's writing-table in plain sight.\r\n\r\n\"They've cleaned her out, o' course,\" said Mr. Wardrop. \"They\r\nwould. We'll go aboard and take an inventory. See!\" He waved his\r\nhands over the harbour.  \"We - live - there - now. Sorry?\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor smiled a smile of relief.\r\n\r\n\"He's glad of that,\" said one of the crew, reflectively.  \"I\r\nshouldn't wonder.\"\r\n\r\nThey flocked down to the harbour-front, the militia regiment\r\nclattering behind, and embarked themselves in what they found -\r\nit happened to be the Governor's boat.  Then they disappeared\r\nover the bulwarks of the Haliotis, and the Governor prayed that\r\nthey might find occupation inside.\r\n\r\nMr. Wardrop's first bound took him to the engine-room; and when\r\nthe others were patting the well-remembered decks, they heard\r\nhim giving God thanks that things were as he had left them.  The\r\nwrecked engines stood over his head untouched; no inexpert hand\r\nhad meddled with his shores; the steel wedges of the store-room\r\nwere rusted home; and, best of all, the hundred and sixty tons of\r\ngood Australian coal in the bunkers had not diminished.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand it,\" said Mr. Wardrop. \"Any Malay knows the\r\nuse o' copper.  They ought to have cut away the pipes.  And with\r\nChinese junks coming here, too.  It's a special interposition o'\r\nProvidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so,\" said the skipper, from above. \"There's only been\r\none thief here, and he's cleaned her out of all my things,\r\nanyhow.\"\r\n\r\nHere the skipper spoke less than the truth, for under the\r\nplanking of his cabin, only to be reached by a chisel, lay a\r\nlittle money which never drew any interest - his sheet-anchor to\r\nwindward.  It was all in clean sovereigns that pass current the\r\nworld over, and might have amounted to more than a hundred\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n\"He's left me alone.  Let's thank God,\" repeated Mr. Wardrop.\r\n\r\n\"He's taken everything else; look!\"\r\n\r\nThe Haliotis, except as to her engine-room, had been\r\nsystematically and scientifically gutted from one end to the\r\nother, and there was strong evidence that an unclean guard had\r\ncamped in the skipper's cabin to regulate that plunder.  She\r\nlacked glass, plate, crockery, cutlery, mattresses, cuddy carpets\r\nand chairs, all boats, and her copper ventilators.  These things\r\nhad been removed, with her sails and as much of the wire rigging\r\nas would not imperil the safety of the masts.\r\n\r\n\"He must have sold those,\" said the skipper. \"The other things\r\nare in  his house, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nEvery fitting that could be pried or screwed out was gone.  Port,\r\nstarboard, and masthead lights; teak gratings; sliding sashes of\r\nthe deckhouse; the captain's chest of drawers, with charts and\r\nchart-table; photographs, brackets, and looking-glasses; cabin\r\ndoors; rubber cuddy mats; hatch-irons; half the funnel-stays;\r\ncork fenders; carpenter's grindstone and tool-chest; holystones,\r\nswabs, squeegees; all cabin and pantry lamps; galley-fittings en\r\nbloc; flags and  flag-locker; clocks, chronometers; the forward\r\ncompass and the ship's bell and belfry, were among the missing.\r\n\r\nThere were great scarred marks on the deck-planking over which\r\nthe cargo-derricks had been hauled. One must have fallen by the\r\nway, for the bulwark-rails were smashed and bent and the\r\nside-plates bruised.\r\n\r\n\"It's the Governor,\" said the skipper  \"He's been selling her on\r\nthe instalment plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go up with spanners and shovels, and kill 'em all,\"\r\nshouted the crew. \"Let's drown him, and keep the woman!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll be shot by that black-and-tan regiment - our\r\nregiment. What's the trouble ashore ~ They've camped our\r\nregiment on the beach.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're cut off; that's all. Go and see what they want,\" said Mr.\r\nWardrop. \"You've the trousers.\"\r\n\r\nIn his simple way the Governor was a strategist. He did not\r\ndesire that the crew of the Haliotis should come ashore again,\r\neither singly or in detachments, and he proposed to turn their\r\nsteamer into a convict-hulk. They would wait - he explained this\r\nfrom the quay to the skipper in the barge - and they would\r\ncontinue to wait till the man-of-war came along, exactly where\r\nthey were. If one of them set foot ashore, the entire regiment\r\nwould open fire, and he would not scruple to use the two cannon\r\nof the town. Meantime food would be sent  daily in a boat under\r\nan armed escort. The skipper, bare to the waist, and rowing,\r\ncould only grind his teeth; and the Governor improved the\r\noccasion, and revenged himself for the bitter words in the\r\ncables, by saying what he thought of the morals and manners of\r\nthe crew. The barge returned to the Haliotis in silence, and the\r\nskipper climbed aboard, white on the cheek-bones and blue about\r\nthe nostrils.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it,\" said Mr. Wardrop; \"and they won't give us good food,\r\neither. We shall have bananas morning, noon, and night, an' a man\r\ncan't work on  fruit.  We know that.\"\r\n\r\nThen the skipper cursed Mr. Wardrop for importing frivolous\r\nside-issues into the conversation; and the crew cursed one\r\nanother, and the Haliotis, the voyage, and all that they knew or\r\ncould bring to mind. They sat down in silence on the empty\r\ndecks, and their eyes burned in their heads. The green harbour\r\nwater chuckled at them overside. They looked at the palm-fringed\r\nhills inland, at the white houses above the harbour road, at the\r\nsingle tier of native craft by the quay, at the stolid soldiery\r\nsitting round the two cannon, and, last of all, at the blue bar\r\nof the horizon. Mr. War-drop was buried in thought, and scratched\r\nimaginary lines with his untrimmed finger-nails on the planking.\r\n\r\n\"I make no promise,\" he said, at last, \"for I can't say what may\r\nor may not have happened to them. But here's the ship, and\r\nhere's us.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a little scornful laughter at this, and Mr. Wardrop\r\nknitted his brows. He recalled that in the days when be wore\r\ntrousers he had been Chief Engineer  of the Haliotis.\r\n\r\n\"Harland, Mackesy, Noble, Hay, Naughton, Fink, O'Hara, Trumbull.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, sir!\" The instinct of obedience waked to answer the\r\nroll-call of the engine-room.\r\n\r\n\"Below!\"\r\n\r\nThey rose and went.\r\n\r\n\"Captain, I'll trouble you for the rest of the men as I want\r\nthem. We'll get my stores out, and clear away the shores we\r\ndon't need, and then we'll patch her up. My men will remember\r\nthat they're in the Haliotis, - under me.\"\r\n\r\nHe went into the engine-room, and the others stared. They were\r\nused to the accidents of the sea, but this was beyond their\r\nexperience. None who had seen the engine-room believed that\r\nanything short of new engines from end to end could stir the\r\nHaliotis from her moorings.\r\n\r\nThe engine-room stores were unearthed, and Mr. Wardrop's face,\r\nred with the filth of the bilges and the exertion of travelling\r\non his stomach, lit with joy. The spare gear of the Haliotis had\r\nbeen unusually complete, and two-and-twenty men, armed with\r\nscrew-jacks, differential blocks, tackle, vices, and a forge or\r\nso, can look Kismet between the eyes without winking.  The crew\r\nwere ordered to replace the holding-down and shaft-bearing\r\nbolts, and return the collars of the thrust-block. When they had\r\nfinished, Mr. Wardrop delivered a lecture on repairing compound\r\nengines without the aid of the shops, and the men sat about on\r\nthe cold machinery.  The cross-head jammed in the guides leered\r\nat them drunkenly, but offered no help. They ran their fingers\r\nhopelessly into the cracks of the starboard supporting-column,\r\nand picked at the ends of the ropes round the shores, while Mr.\r\nWardrop's voice rose and fell echoing, till the quick tropic\r\nnight closed down over the engine-room skylight.\r\n\r\nNext morning the work of reconstruction began. It has been\r\nexplained that the foot of the connecting-rod was forced against\r\nthe foot of the starboard supporting-column, which it had cracked\r\nthrough and driven outward towards the ship's skin.  To all\r\nappearance the job was more than hopeless, for rod and column\r\nseemed to have been welded into one.  But herein Providence\r\nsmiled on them for one moment to hearten them through the weary\r\nweeks ahead.  The second engineer -more reckless than resourceful\r\n- struck at random with a cold chisel into the cast-iron of the\r\ncolumn, and a greasy, grey flake of metal flew from under the\r\nimprisoned foot of the connecting-rod, while the rod itself fell\r\naway slowly, and brought up with a thunderous clang somewhere in\r\nthe dark of the crank-pit. The guides-plates above were still\r\njammed fast in the guides, but the first blow had been struck.\r\nThey spent the rest of the day grooming the donkey-engine, which\r\nstood immediately forward of the engine-room hatch.  Its\r\ntarpaulin, of course, had been stolen, and eight warm months had\r\nnot improved the working parts. Further, the last dying hiccup of\r\nthe Haliotis seemed - or it might have been the Malay from the\r\nboat-house - to have lifted the thing bodily on its bolts, and\r\nset it down inaccurately as regarded its steam connections.\r\n\r\n\"If we only had one single cargo-derrick!\" Mr. Wardrop sighed.\r\n\"We can take the cylinder-cover off by hand, if we sweat; but to\r\nget the rod out o' the piston's not possible unless we use\r\nsteam. Well, there'll be steam the morn, if there's nothing\r\nelse. She'll fizzle!\"\r\n\r\nNext morning men from the shore saw the Haliotis through a cloud,\r\nfor it was as though the deck smoked.  Her crew were chasing\r\nsteam through the shaken and leaky pipes to its work in the\r\nforward donkey-engine; and where oakum failed to plug a crack,\r\nthey stripped off their loin-cloths for lapping, and swore,\r\nhalf-boiled and mother-naked.  The donkey-engine worked - at a\r\nprice - the price of constant attention and furious stoking-\r\nworked long enough to allow a wire-rope (it was made up of a\r\nfunnel and a foremast-stay) to be led into the engine-room and\r\nmade fast on the cylinder-cover of the forward engine. That rose\r\neasily enough, and was hauled through the skylight and on to the\r\ndeck, many hands assisting the doubtful steam. Then came the tug\r\nof war, for it was necessary to get to the piston and the jammed\r\npiston-rod. They removed two of the piston junk-ring studs,\r\nscrewed in two strong iron eye-bolts by way of handles, doubled\r\nthe wire-rope, and set half a dozen men to smite with an\r\nextemporised battering-ram at the end of the piston-rod, where it\r\npeered through the piston, while the donkey-engine hauled upwards\r\non the piston itself.  After four hours of this furious work, the\r\npiston-rod suddenly slipped, and the piston rose with a jerk,\r\nknocking one or two men over into the engine-room.  But when Mr.\r\nWardrop declared that the piston had not split, they cheered, and\r\nthought nothing of their wounds; and the donkey-engine was\r\nhastily stopped; its boiler was nothing to tamper with.\r\n\r\nAnd day by day their supplies reached them by boat. The skipper\r\nhumbled himself once more before the Governor, and as a\r\nconcession had leave to get drinking-water from the Malay\r\nboat-builder on the quay. It was not good drinking-water, but\r\nthe Malay was anxious to supply anything in his power, if he were\r\npaid for it.\r\n\r\nNow when the jaws of the forward engine stood, as it were,\r\nstripped and empty, they began to wedge up the shores of the\r\ncylinder itself. That work alone filled the better part of three\r\ndays - warm and sticky days, when the hands slipped and sweat ran\r\ninto the eyes.  When the last wedge was hammered home there was\r\nno longer an ounce of weight on the supporting-columns; and Mr.\r\nWardrop rummaged the ship for boiler-plate three-quarters of an\r\ninch thick, where he could find it. There was not much available,\r\nbut what there was was more than beaten gold to him. In one\r\ndesperate forenoon the entire crew, naked and lean, haled back,\r\nmore or less into place, the starboard supporting-column, which,\r\nas you remember, was cracked clean through. Mr. Wardrop found\r\nthem asleep where they had finished the work, and gave them a\r\nday's rest, smiling upon them as a father while he drew\r\nchalk-marks about the cracks. They woke to new and more trying\r\nlabour; for over each one of those cracks a plate of\r\nthree-quarter-inch boiler-iron was to be worked hot, the\r\nrivet-holes being drilled by hand. All that time they were fed on\r\nfruits, chiefly bananas, with some sago.\r\n\r\nThose were the days when men swooned over the ratchet-drill and\r\nthe hand-forge, and where they fell they had leave to lie unless\r\ntheir bodies were in the way of their fellows' feet.  And so,\r\npatch upon patch, and a patch over all, the starboard\r\nsupporting-column was clouted; but when they thought all was\r\nsecure, Mr. Wardrop decreed that the noble patchwork would never\r\nsupport working engines; at the best, it could only hold the\r\nguide-bars approximately true.  The deadweight of the cylinders\r\nmust be borne by vertical struts; and, therefore, a gang would\r\nrepair to the bows, and take out, with files, the big bow-anchor\r\ndavits, each of which was some three inches in diameter.  They\r\nthrew hot coals at Wardrop, and threatened to kill him, those who\r\ndid not weep (they were ready to weep on the least provocation);\r\nbut he hit them with iron bars heated at the end, and they limped\r\nforward, and the davits came with them when they returned. They\r\nslept sixteen hours on the strength of it, and in three days two\r\nstruts were in place, bolted from the foot of the starboard\r\nsupporting-column to the under side of the cylinder.  There\r\nremained now the port, or condenser-column, which, though not so\r\nbadly cracked as its fellow, had also been strengthened in four\r\nplaces with boiler-plate patches, but needed struts.  They took\r\naway the main stanchions of the bridge for that work, and, crazy\r\nwith toil, did not see till all was in place that the rounded\r\nbars of iron must be flattened from top to bottom to allow the\r\nair-pump levers to clear them. It was Wardrop's oversight, and he\r\nwept bitterly before the men as he gave the order to unbolt the\r\nstruts and flatten them with hammer and the flame. Now the broken\r\nengine was underpinned firmly, and they took away the wooden\r\nshores from under the cylinders, and gave them to the robbed\r\nbridge, thanking God for even half a day's work on gentle, kindly\r\nwood instead of the iron that had entered into their souls. Eight\r\nmonths in the back-country among the leeches, at a temperature of\r\n84 degrees moist, is very bad for the nerves.\r\n\r\nThey had kept the hardest work to the last, as boys save Latin\r\nprose, and, worn though they were, Mr. Wardrop did not dare to\r\ngive them rest. The piston-rod and connecting-rod were to be\r\nstraightened, and this was a job for a regular dockyard with\r\nevery appliance. They fell to it, cheered by a little chalk\r\nshowing of work done and time consumed which Mr. Wardrop wrote\r\nup on the engine-room bulkhead.  Fifteen days had gone -fifteen\r\ndays of killing labour - and there was hope before them.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that no man knows how the rods were straightened.\r\nThe crew of the Haliotis remember that week very dimly, as a\r\nfever patient remembers the delirium of a long night. There were\r\nfires everywhere, they say; the whole ship was one consuming\r\nfurnace, and the hammers were never still. Now, there could not\r\nhave been more than one fire at the most, for Mr. Wardrop\r\ndistinctly recalls that no straightening was done except under\r\nhis own eye. They remember, too, that for many years voices gave\r\norders which they obeyed with their bodies, but their minds were\r\nabroad on all the seas.  It seems to them that they stood through\r\ndays and nights slowly sliding a bar backwards and forwards\r\nthrough a white glow that was part of the ship. They remember an\r\nintolerable noise in their burning heads from the walls of the\r\nstoke-hole, and they remember being savagely beaten by men whose\r\neyes seemed asleep. When their shift was over they would draw\r\nstraight lines in the air, anxiously and repeatedly, and would\r\nquestion one another in their sleep, crying, \"Is she straight?\"\r\n\r\nAt last - they do not remember whether this was by day or by\r\nnight - Mr. Wardrop began to dance clumsily, and wept the while;\r\nand they too danced and wept, and went to sleep twitching all\r\nover; and when they woke, men said that the rods were\r\nstraightened, and no one did any work for two days, but lay on\r\nthe decks and ate fruit. Mr. Wardrop would go below from time to\r\ntime, and pat the two rods where they lay, and they heard him\r\nsinging hymns.\r\n\r\nThen his trouble of mind went from him, and at the end of the\r\nthird day's idleness he made a drawing in chalk upon the deck,\r\nwith letters of the alphabet at the angles. He pointed out that,\r\nthough the piston-rod was  more or less straight, the piston-rod\r\ncross-head - the thing that had been jammed sideways in the\r\nguides - had been badly strained, and had cracked the lower end\r\nof the piston-rod. He was going to forge and shrink a\r\nwrought-iron collar on the neck of the piston-rod where it joined\r\nthe cross-head, and from the collar he would bolt a Y-shaped\r\npiece of iron whose lower arms should be bolted into the\r\ncross-head. If anything more were needed, they could use up the\r\nlast of the boiler-plate.\r\n\r\nSo the forges were lit again, and men burned their bodies, but\r\nhardly felt the pain. The finished connection was not beautiful,\r\nbut it seemed strong enough - at least, as strong as the rest of\r\nthe machinery; and with that job their labours came to an end.\r\nAll that remained was to connect up the engines, and to get food\r\nand water. The skipper and four men dealt with the Malay\r\nboat-builder by night chiefly; it was no time to haggle over the\r\nprice of sago and dried fish. The others stayed aboard and\r\nreplaced piston, piston-rod, cylinder-cover, cross-head, and\r\nbolts, with the aid of the faithful donkey-engine. The\r\ncylinder-cover was hardly steam-proof, and the eye of science\r\nmight have seen in the connecting-rod a flexure something like\r\nthat of a Christmas-tree candle which has melted and been\r\nstraightened by hand over a stove, but, as Mr. Wardrop said,\r\n\"She didn't hit anything.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the last bolt was in place, men tumbled over one\r\nanother in their anxiety to get to the hand starting-gear, the\r\nwheel and worm, by which some engines can be moved when there is\r\nno steam aboard. They nearly wrenched off the wheel, but it was\r\nevident to the blindest eye that the engines stirred. They did\r\nnot revolve in their orbits with any enthusiasm, as good\r\nmachines should; indeed, they groaned not a little; but they\r\nmoved over and came to rest in a way which proved that they\r\nstill recognised man's hand. Then Mr. Wardrop sent his slaves\r\ninto the darker bowels of the engine-room and the stoke-hole, and\r\nfollowed them with a flare-lamp. The boilers were sound, but\r\nwould take no harm from a little scaling and cleaning. Mr.\r\nWardrop would not have any one over-zealous, for he feared what\r\nthe next stroke of the tool might show. \"The less we know about\r\nher now,\" said he, \"the better for us all, I'm thinkin'. Ye'll\r\nunderstand me when I say that this is in no sense regular\r\nengineerin'.\"\r\n\r\nAs his raiment, when he spoke, was his grey beard and uncut hair,\r\nthey believed him. They did not ask too much of what they met,\r\nbut polished and tallowed and scraped it to a false brilliancy.\r\n\r\n\"A lick of paint would make me easier in my mind,\" said Mr.\r\nWardrop, plaintively. \"I know half the condenser-tubes are\r\nstarted; and the propeller-shaftin' 's God knows how far out of\r\nthe true, and we'll need a new air-pump, an' the main-steam\r\nleaks like a sieve, and there's worse each way I look; but -\r\npaint's like clothes to a man, 'an ours is near all gone.\"\r\n\r\nThe skipper unearthed some stale ropy paint of the loathsome\r\ngreen that they used for the galleys of sailing-ships, and Mr.\r\nWardrop spread it abroad lavishly to give the engines\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\nHis own was returning day by day, for he wore his loin-cloth\r\ncontinuously; but the crew, having worked under orders, did not\r\nfeel as he did. The completed work satisfied Mr. Wardrop.  He\r\nwould at the last have made shift to run to Singapore, and gone\r\nhome without vengeance taken to show his engines to his brethren\r\nin the craft; but the others and the captain forbade him. They\r\nhad not yet recovered their self-respect.\r\n\r\n\"It would be safer to make what ye might call a trial trip, but\r\nbeggars mustn't be choosers; an if the engines will go over to\r\nthe hand-gear, the probability - I'm only saying it's a\r\nprobability the chance is that they'll hold up when we put steam\r\non her.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long will you take to get steam?\" said the skipper.\r\n\r\nGod knows!  Four hours - a day - half a week. If I can raise\r\nsixty pound I'll not complain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be sure of her first; we can't afford to go out half a mile, and\r\nbreak down.\"\r\n\r\n\"My soul and body, man, we're one continuous breakdown, fore an'\r\naft! We might fetch Singapore, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll break down at Pygang-Watai, where we can do good,\" was the\r\nanswer, in a voice that did not allow argument. \"She's my boat,\r\nand - I've had eight  months to think in.\"\r\n\r\nNo man saw the Haliotis depart, though many heard her. She left\r\nat two in the morning, having cut her moorings, and it was none\r\nof her crew's pleasure that the engines should strike up a\r\nthundering half-seas-over chanty that echoed among the hills.\r\nMr. Wardrop wiped away a tear as he listened to the new song.\r\n\r\n\"She's gibberin' -  she's just gibberin',\" he whimpered. \"Yon's\r\nthe  voice of a maniac.\r\n\r\nAnd if engines have any soul, as their masters believe, he was\r\nquite right. There were outcries and clamours, sobs and bursts\r\nof chattering laughter, silences where the trained ear yearned\r\nfor the clear note, and torturing reduplications where there\r\nshould have been one deep voice. Down the screw-shaft ran\r\nmurmurs and warnings, while a heart-diseased flutter without\r\ntold that the propeller needed re-keying.\r\n\r\n\"How does she make it?\" said the skipper.\r\n\r\n\"She moves, but - but she's breakin' my heart. The sooner we're\r\nat Pygang-Watai, the better. She's mad, and we're waking the\r\ntown.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she at all near safe?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do I care how safe she is?  She's mad. Hear that, now!  To\r\nbe sure, nothing's hittin' anything, and the bearin's are fairly\r\ncool, but - can ye not hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"If she goes,\" said the skipper, \"I don't care a curse. And she's\r\nmy boat, too.\"\r\n\r\nShe went, trailing a fathom of weed behind her. From a slow two\r\nknots an hour she crawled up to a triumphant four. Anything\r\nbeyond that made the struts quiver dangerously, and filled the\r\nengine-room with steam. Morning showed her out of sight of land,\r\nand there was a visible ripple under her bows; but she\r\ncomplained bitterly in her bowels, and, as though the noise had\r\ncalled it, there shot along across the purple sea a swift, dark\r\nproa, hawk-like and curious, which presently ranged alongside\r\nand wished to know if the Haliotis were helpless. Ships, even\r\nthe steamers of the white men, had been known to break down in\r\nthose waters, and the honest Malay and Javanese traders would\r\nsometimes aid them in their own peculiar way. But this ship was\r\nnot full of lady passengers and well-dressed officers. Men,\r\nwhite, naked and savage, swarmed down her sides -- some\r\nwithred-hot iron bars, and others with large hammers - threw\r\nthemselves upon those innocent inquiring strangers, and, before\r\nany man could say what had happened, were in full possession of\r\nthe proa, while the lawful owners bobbed in the water overside.\r\nHalf an hour later the proa's cargo of sago and trepang, as well\r\nas a doubtful-minded compass, was in the Haliotis. The two huge\r\ntriangular mat sails, with their seventy-foot yards and booms,\r\nhad followed the cargo, and were being fitted to the stripped\r\nmasts of the steamer.\r\n\r\nThey rose, they swelled, they filled, and the empty steamer\r\nvisibly laid over as the wind took them. They gave her nearly\r\nthree knots an hour, and what better could men ask?  But if she\r\nhad been forlorn before, this new purchase made her horrible to\r\nsee. Imagine a respectable charwoman in the tights of a\r\nballet-dancer rolling drunk along the streets, and you will come\r\nto some faint notion of the appearance of that nine-hundred-ton,\r\nwell-decked, once schooner-rigged cargo-boat as she staggered\r\nunder her new help, shouting and raving across the deep.  With\r\nsteam and sail that marvellous voyage continued; and the\r\nbright-eyed crew looked over the rail, desolate, unkempt,\r\nunshorn, shamelessly clothed  beyond the decencies.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the third week she sighted the island of\r\nPygang-Watai, whose harbour is the turning-point of a pearl\r\nsea-patrol. Here the gun-boats stay for a week ere they retrace\r\ntheir line. There is no village at Pygang-Watai; only a stream\r\nof water, some palms, and a harbour safe to rest in till the\r\nfirst violence of the southeast monsoon has blown itself out.\r\nThey opened up the low coral beach, with its mound of\r\nwhitewashed coal ready for supply, the deserted huts for the\r\nsailors, and the flagless flagstaff.\r\n\r\nNext day there was no Haliotis - only a little proa rocking in\r\nthe warm rain at the mouth of the harbour, whose crew watched\r\nwith hungry eyes the smoke of a gunboat on the horizon.\r\n\r\nMonths afterwards there were a few lines in an English newspaper\r\nto the effect that some gunboat of some foreign Power had broken\r\nher back at the mouth of some far-away harbour by running at full\r\nspeed into a sunken wreck.\r\n\r\nEnd of the, \"DEVIL and THE DEEP SEA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM THE CONQUEROR\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nI have done one braver thing\r\nThan all the worthies did;\r\nAnd yet a braver thence doth spring,\r\nWhich is to keep that hid.\r\nThe Undertaking.\r\n\r\n\"Is it officially declared yet?\"\r\n\r\nThey've gone as far as to admit 'extreme local scarcity,' and\r\nthey've started relief-works in one or two districts, the paper\r\nsays.\"\r\n\r\n\"That means it will be declared as soon as they can make sure of\r\nthe men and the rolling-stock. 'Shouldn't wonder if it were as\r\nbad as the '78 Famine.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Can't be,\" said Scott, turning a little in the long cane chair.\r\n\r\n\"We've had fifteen-anna crops in the north, and Bombay and\r\nBengal report more than they know what to do with.  They'll be\r\nable to check it before it gets out of hand.  It will only be\r\nlocal.\"\r\n\r\nMartyn picked the \"Pioneer\" from the table, read through the\r\ntelegrams once more, and put up his feet on the chair-rests. It\r\nwas a hot, dark, breathless evening, heavy with the smell of the\r\nnewly watered Mall. The flowers in the Club gardens were dead and\r\nblack on their stalks, the little lotus-pond was a circle of\r\ncaked mud, and the tamarisk-trees were white with the dust of\r\nweeks. Most of the men were at the band-stand in the public\r\ngardens - from the Club verandah you could hear the native Police\r\nband hammering stale waltzes - or on the polo-ground, or in the\r\nhigh-walled fives-court, hotter than a Dutch oven. Half a dozen\r\ngrooms, squatted at the heads of their ponies, waited their\r\nmasters' return. From time to time a man would ride at a\r\nfoot-pace into the Club compound, and listlessly loaf over to the\r\nwhitewashed barracks beside the main building. These were\r\nsupposed to be chambers. Men lived in them, meeting the same\r\nwhite faces night after night at dinner, and drawing out their\r\noffice-work till the latest possible hour, that they might escape\r\nthat doleful company.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?.\" said Martyn, with a yawn. \"Let's\r\nhave a swim before dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Water's hot. I was at the bath to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Play you game o' billiards - fifty up.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a hundred and five in the hall now. Sit still and don't be\r\nso abominably energetic.\"\r\n\r\nA grunting camel swung up to the porch, his badged and belted\r\nrider fumbling a leather pouch.\r\n\r\n\"Kubber-kargaz-ki-yektraaa,\" the man whined, handing down the\r\nnewspaper extra - a slip printed on one side only, and damp from\r\nthe press. It was pinned up on the green-baize board, between\r\nnotices of ponies for sale and fox-terriers missing.\r\n\r\nMartyn rose lazily, read it, and whistled. \"It's declared!\" he\r\ncried. \"One, two, three - eight districts go under the\r\noperations of the Famine Code ek dum. They've put Jimmy Hawkins\r\nin charge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good business!\" said Scott, with the first sign of interest he\r\nhad shown. \"When in doubt hire a Punjabi. I worked under Jimmy\r\nwhen I first came out and he belonged to the Punjab. He has more\r\nbundobust than most men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jimmy's a Jubilee Knight now,\" said Martyn.\"He's a good chap,\r\neven though he is a thrice-born civilian and went to the\r\nBenighted Presidency. What unholy names these Madras districts\r\nrejoice in - all ungas or rungas or pillays or polliums!\"\r\n\r\nA dog-cart drove up in the dusk, and a man entered, mopping his\r\nhead. He was editor of the one daily paper at the capital of a\r\nProvince of twenty-five million natives and a few hundred white\r\nmen: as his staff was limited to himself and one assistant, his\r\noffice-hours ran variously from ten to twenty a day.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Raines; you're supposed to know everything,\" said Martyn,\r\nstopping him.  \"How's this Madras 'scarcity' going to turn out?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one knows as yet.  There's a message as long as your arm\r\ncoming in on the telephone. I've left my cub to fill it out.\r\nMadras has owned she can't manage it alone, and Jimmy seems to\r\nhave a free hand in getting all the men he needs. Arbuthnot's\r\nwarned to hold himself in readiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Badger' Arbuthnot?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Peshawur chap.  Yes: and the Pi wires that Ellis and Clay\r\nhave been moved from the Northwest already, and they've taken\r\nhalf a dozen Bombay men, too.  It's pukka famine, by the looks\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're nearer the scene of action than we are; but if it comes\r\nto indenting on the Punjab this early, there's more in this than\r\nmeets the eye,\" said Martyn.\r\n\r\n\"Here to-day and gone to-morrow.  'Didn't come to stay for ever,\"\r\nsaid Scott, dropping one of Marryat's novels, and rising to his\r\nfeet.  \"Martyn, your sister's waiting for you.\"\r\n\r\nA rough grey horse was backing and shifting at the edge of the\r\nverandah, where the light of a kerosene lamp fell on a\r\nbrown-calico habit and a white face under a grey-felt hat.\r\n\r\n\"Right, O!\" said Martyn.  \"I'm ready.  Better come and dine with\r\nus, if you've nothing to do, Scott.  William, is there any\r\ndinner in the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go home and see,\" was the rider's answer. \"You can drive\r\nhim over - at eight, remember.\"\r\n\r\nScott moved leisurely to his room, and changed into the\r\nevening-dress of the season and the country: spotless white\r\nlinen from head to foot, with a broad silk cummerbund.  Dinner\r\nat the Martyns' was a decided improvement on the goat-mutton,\r\ntwiney-tough fowl, and tinned entrees of the Club. But it was a\r\ngreat pity that Martyn could not afford to send his sister to\r\nthe hills for the hot weather. As an Acting District\r\nSuperintendent of Police, Martyn drew the magnificent pay of six\r\nhundred depreciated silver rupees a month, and his little\r\nfour-roomed bungalow said just as much. There were the usual\r\nblue-and-white-striped jail-made rugs on the uneven floor; the\r\nusual glass-studded Amritsar phulkaris draped on nails driven\r\ninto the flaking whitewash of the walls; the usual half-dozen\r\nchairs that did not match, picked up at sales of dead men's\r\neffects; and the usual streaks of black grease where the leather\r\npunka-thong ran through the wall.  It was as though everything\r\nhad been unpacked the night before to be repacked next morning.\r\nNot a door in the house was true on its hinges.  The little\r\nwindows, fifteen feet up, were darkened with wasp-nests, and\r\nlizards hunted flies between the beams of the wood-ceiled roof.\r\nBut all this was part of Scott's life.  Thus did people live who\r\nhad such an income; and in a land where each man's pay, age, and\r\nposition are printed in a book, that all may read, it is hardly\r\nworth while to play at pretence in word or deed.  Scott counted\r\neight years' service in the Irrigation Department, and drew eight\r\nhundred rupees a month, on the understanding that if he served\r\nthe State faithfully for another twenty-two years he could retire\r\non a pension of some four hundred rupees a month. His\r\nworking-life, which had been spent chiefly under canvas or in\r\ntemporary shelters where a man could sleep, eat, and write\r\nletters, was bound up with the opening and guarding of irrigation\r\ncanals, the handling of two or three thousand workmen of all\r\ncastes and creeds, and the payment of vast sums of coined silver.\r\n\r\nHe had finished that spring, not without credit, the last section\r\nof the great Mosuhl Canal, and - much against his will, for he\r\nhated office-work - had been sent in to serve during the hot\r\nweather on the accounts and supply side of the Department, with\r\nsole charge of the sweltering sub-office at the capital of the\r\nProvince. Martyn knew this; William, his sister, knew it; and\r\neverybody knew it.  Scott knew, too, as well as the rest of the\r\nworld, that Miss Martyn had come out to India four years ago to\r\nkeep house for her brother, who, as every one knew, had borrowed\r\nthe money to pay for  her passage, and that she ought, as all the\r\nworld said, to have married at once.  In stead of this, she had\r\nrefused some half a dozen subalterns, a Civilian twenty years her\r\nsenior, one Major, and a man in the Indian Medical Department.\r\nThis, too, was common property.  She had \"stayed down three hot\r\nweathers,\" as the saying is, because her brother was in debt and\r\ncould not afford the expense of her keep at even a cheap\r\nhill-station.  Therefore her face was white as bone, and in the\r\ncentre of her forehead was a big silvery scar about the size of a\r\nshilling - the mark of a Delhi sore, which is the same as a\r\n\"Bagdad date.\"  This comes from drinking bad water, and slowly\r\neats into the flesh till it is ripe enough to be burned out.\r\n\r\nNone the less William had enjoyed herself hugely in her four\r\nyears.  Twice she had been nearly drowned while fording a river;\r\nonce she had been run away with on a camel; had witnessed a\r\nmidnight attack of thieves on her brother's camp; had seen\r\njustice administered, with long sticks, in the open under trees;\r\ncould speak Urdu and even rough Punjabi with a fluency that was\r\nenvied by her seniors; had entirely fallen out of the habit of\r\nwriting to her aunts in England, or cutting the pages of the\r\nEnglish magazines; had been through a very bad cholera year,\r\nseeing sights unfit to be told; and had wound up her experiences\r\nby six weeks of typhoid fever, during which her head had been\r\nshaved  and hoped to keep her twenty-third birthday that\r\nSeptember.  It is conceivable that the aunts would not have\r\napproved of a girl who never set foot on the ground if a horse\r\nwere within hail; who rode to dances with a shawl thrown over her\r\nskirt; who wore her hair cropped and curling all over her head;\r\nwho answered indifferently to the name of William or Bill; whose\r\nspeech was heavy with the flowers of the vernacular; who could\r\nact in amateur theatricals, play on the banjo, rule eight\r\nservants and two horses, their accounts and their diseases, and\r\nlook men slowly and deliberately between the eyes - even after\r\nthey had proposed to her and been rejected.\r\n\r\n\"I like men who do things,\" she had confided to a man in the\r\nEducational Department, who was teaching the sons of\r\ncloth-merchants and dyers the beauty of Wordsworth's \"Excursion\r\nin annotated cram-books; and when he grew poetical, William\r\nexplained that she \"didn't understand poetry very much; it made\r\nher head ache,\" and another broken heart took refuge at the\r\nClub. But it was all William's fault.  She delighted in hearing\r\nmen talk of their own work, and that is the most fatal way of\r\nbringing a man to your feet.\r\n\r\nScott had known her for some three years, meeting her, as a rule,\r\nunder canvass, when his camp and her brother's joined for a day\r\non the edge of the Indian Desert. He had danced with her several\r\ntimes at the big Christmas gatherings, when as many as five\r\nhundred white people came in to the station; and had always a\r\ngreat respect for her housekeeping and her dinners.\r\n\r\nShe looked more like a boy than ever when, the meal ended, she\r\nsat, rolling cigarettes, her low forehead puckered beneath the\r\ndark curls as she twiddled the papers and stuck out her rounded\r\nchin when the tobacco stayed in place, or, with a gesture as\r\ntrue as a school-boy's throwing a stone, tossed the finished\r\narticle across the room to Martyn, who caught it with one hand,\r\nand continued his talk with Scott. It was all \"shop,\" - canals\r\nand the policing of canals; the sins of villagers who stole more\r\nwater than they had paid for, and the grosser sin of native\r\nconstables who connived at the thefts; of the transplanting\r\nbodily of villages to newly irrigated ground, and of the coming\r\nfight with the desert in the south when the Provincial funds\r\nshould warrant the opening of the long-surveyed Luni Protective\r\nCanal System. And Scott spoke openly of his great desire to be\r\nput on one particular section of the work where he knew the land\r\nand the people; and Martyn sighed for a billet in the Himalayan\r\nfoot-hills, and said his mind of his superiors, and William\r\nrolled cigarettes and said nothing, but smiled gravely on her\r\nbrother because he was happy.\r\n\r\nAt ten Scott's horse came to the door, and the evening was ended.\r\n\r\nThe lights of the two low bungalows in which the daily paper was\r\nprinted showed bright across the road. It was too early to try\r\nto find sleep, and Scott drifted over to the editor. Raines,\r\nstripped to the waist like a sailor at a gun, lay half asleep in\r\na long chair, waiting for night telegrams. He had a theory that\r\nif a man did not stay by his work all day and most of the night\r\nhe laid himself open to fever: so he ate and slept among his\r\nfiles.\r\n\r\n\"Can you do it?\" be said drowsily. \"I didn't mean to bring you\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\n\"About what ~ I've been dining at the Martyns'.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Madras famine, of course.  Martyn's warned, too. They're\r\ntaking men where they can find 'em. I sent a note to you at the\r\nClub just now, asking if you could do us a letter once a week\r\nfrom the south - between two and three columns, say. Nothing\r\nsensational, of course, but just plain facts about who is doing\r\nwhat, and so forth. Our regular rates - ten rupees a column.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Sorry, but it's out of my line,\" Scott answered, staring\r\nabsently at the map of India on the wall. \"It's rough on Martyn\r\n- very. 'Wonder what he'lldo with his sister? 'Wonder what the\r\ndeuce they'll do with me? I've no famine experience. This is the\r\nfirst I've heard of it. Am I ordered?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. Here's the wire. They'll put you on to relief-works,\"\r\nRaines said, \"with a horde of Madrassis dying like flies; one\r\nnative apothecary and half a pint of cholera-mixture among the\r\nten thousand of you. It comes of your being idle for the moment.\r\nEvery man who isn't doing two men's work seems to have been\r\ncalled upon. Hawkins evidently believes in Punjabis.  It's going\r\nto be quite as bad as anything they have had in the last ten\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all in the day's work, worse luck. I suppose I shall get my\r\norders officially some time to-morrow. I'm awfully glad I\r\nhappened to drop in. 'Better go and pack my kit now. Who\r\nrelieves me here - do you know?\"\r\n\r\nRaines turned over a sheaf of telegrams. \"McEuan,\" said he, \"from\r\nMurree.\"\r\n\r\nScott chuckled. \"He thought he was going to be cool all summer.\r\nHe'll be very sick about this. Well, no good talking. 'Night.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, Scott, with a clear conscience, laid himself\r\ndown to rest on a string cot in a bare room. Two worn bullock\r\ntrunks, a leather water-bottle, a tin ice-box, and his pet\r\nsaddle sewed up in sacking were piled at the door, and the Club\r\nsecretary's receipt for last month's bill was under his pillow.\r\nHis orders came next morning, and with them an unofficial\r\ntelegram from Sir James Hawkins; who was not in the habit of\r\nforgetting good men when he had once met them, bidding him\r\nreport himself with all speed at some unpronounceable place\r\nfifteen hundred miles to the south, for the famine was sore in\r\nthe land, and white men were needed.\r\n\r\nA pink and fattish youth arrived in the red-hot noonday,\r\nwhimpering a little at fate and famines, which never allowed any\r\none three months' peace. He was Scott's successor - another cog\r\nin the machinery, moved forward behind his fellow whose\r\nservices, as the official announcement ran, \"were placed at the\r\ndisposal of the Madras Government for famine duty until further\r\norders.\" Scott handed over the funds in his charge, showed him\r\nthe coolest corner in the office, warned him against excess of\r\nzeal, and, as twilight fell, departed from the Club in a hired\r\ncarriage, with his faithful body-servant, Faiz Ullah, and a\r\nmound of disordered baggage atop, to catch the southern mail at\r\nthe loopholed and bastioned railway-station. The heat from the\r\nthick brick walls struck him across the face as if it had been a\r\nhot towel; and he reflected that there were at least five nights\r\nand four days of this travel before him. Faiz Ullah, used to the\r\nchances of service, plunged into the crowd on the stone\r\nplatform, while Scott, a black cheroot between his teeth, waited\r\ntill his compartment should be set away.  A dozen native\r\npolicemen, with their rifles and bundles, shouldered into the\r\npress of Punjabi farmers, Sikh craftsmen, and greasy-locked\r\nAfreedee pedlars, escorting with all pomp Martyn's uniform-case,\r\nwater-bottles, ice-box, and bedding-roll.  They saw Faiz Ullah's\r\nlifted hand, and steered for it.\r\n\r\n\"My Sahib and your Sahib,\" said Faiz Ullah to Martyn's man, \"will\r\ntravel together.  Thou and I, O brother, will thus secure the\r\nservants' places close by; and because of our masters' authority\r\nnone will dare to disturb us.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Faiz Ullah reported all things ready, Scott settled down at\r\nfull length, coatless and bootless, on the broad leather-covered\r\nbunk. The heat under the iron-arched roof of the station might\r\nhave been anything over a hundred degrees.  At the last moment\r\nMartyn entered, dripping.\r\n\r\n\"Don't swear,\" said Scott, lazily; \"it's too late to change your\r\ncarriage; and we'll divide the ice.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" said the police-man.\r\n\r\n\"I'm lent to the Madras Government, same as you. By Jove, it's a\r\nbender of a night! Are you taking any of your men down?\"\r\n\r\n\"A dozen.  I suppose I shall have to superintend relief\r\ndistributions. 'Didn't know you were under orders too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't till after I left you last night. Raines had the news\r\nfirst. My orders came this morning. McEuan relieved me at four,\r\nand I got off at once. 'Shouldn't wonder if it wouldn't be a\r\ngood thing -this famine - if we come through it alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jimmy ought to put you and me to work together,\" said Martyn;\r\nand then, after a pause:  \"My sister's here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good business,\" said Scott, heartily. \"Going to get off at\r\nUmballa, I suppose, and go up to Simla. Who'll she stay with\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"No-o; that's just the trouble of it. She's going down with me.\"\r\n\r\nScott sat bolt upright under the oil-lamps as the train jolted\r\npast Tarn-Taran. \"What! You don't mean you couldn't afford -\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tain't that. I'd have scraped up the money somehow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might have come to me, to begin with,\" said Scott, stiffly;\r\n\"we aren't altogether strangers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you needn't be stuffy about it. I might, but - you don't\r\nknow my sister. I've been explaining and exhorting and all the\r\nrest of it all day - lost my temper since seven this morning,\r\nand haven't got it back yet-but she wouldn't hear of any\r\ncompromise. A woman's entitled to travel with her husband if she\r\nwants to; and William says she's on the same footing.  You see,\r\nwe've been together all our lives, more or less, since my people\r\ndied. It isn't as if she were an ordinary sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the sisters I've ever heard of would have stayed where they\r\nwere well off.\"\r\n\r\nShe's as clever as a man, confound - Martyn went on. \"She broke\r\nup the bungalow over my head while I was talking at her.\r\n'Settled the whole thing in three hours - servants, horses, and\r\nall. I didn't get my orders till nine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jimmy Hawkins won't be pleased,\" said Scott \"A famine's no place\r\nfor a woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Jim - I mean Lady Jim's in camp with him. At any rate, she\r\nsays she will look after my sister. William wired down to her on\r\nher own responsibility, asking if she could come, and knocked the\r\nground from under me by showing me her answer.\"\r\n\r\nScott laughed aloud. \"If she can do that she can take care of\r\nherself, and Mrs. Jim won't let her run into any mischief There\r\naren't many women, sisters or wives, who would walk into a\r\nfamine with their eyes open.  It isn't as if she didn't know\r\nwhat these things mean. She was through the Jalo cholera last\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\nThe train stopped at Amritsar, and Scott went back to the ladies'\r\ncompartment, immediately behind their carriage. William, with a\r\ncloth riding-cap on her curls, nodded affably.\r\n\r\n\"Come in and have some tea,\" she said. \"'Best thing in the world\r\nfor heat-apoplexy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I look as if I were going to have heat-apoplexy?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Never can tell,\" said William, wisely. \"It's always best to be\r\nready.\"\r\n\r\nShe had arranged her compartment with the knowledge of an old\r\ncampaigner. A felt-covered water-bottle hung in the draught of\r\none of the shuttered windows; a tea-set of Russian china, packed\r\nin a wadded basket, stood on the seat; and a travelling\r\nspirit-lamp was clamped against the woodwork above it.\r\n\r\nWilliam served them generously, in large cups, hot tea, which\r\nsaves the veins of the neck from swelling inopportunely on a hot\r\nnight. It was characteristic of the girl that, her plan of\r\naction once settled, she asked for no comments on it. Life among\r\nmen who had a great deal of work to do, and very little time to\r\ndo it in, had taught her the wisdom of effacing, as well as of\r\nfending for, herself. She did not by word or deed suggest that\r\nshe would be useful, comforting, or beautiful in their travels,\r\nbut continued about her business serenely: put the cups back\r\nwithout clatter when tea was ended, and made cigarettes for her\r\nguests.\r\n\r\n\"This time last night,\" said Scott, \"we didn't expect - er - this\r\nkind of thing, did we?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've learned to expect anything,\" said William. \"You know, in\r\nour service, we live at the end of the telegraph; but, of\r\ncourse, this ought to be a good thing for us all, departmentally\r\n- if we live.\"\r\n\r\n\"It knocks us out of the running in our own Province,\" Scott\r\nreplied, with equal gravity. \"I hoped to be put on the Luni\r\nProtective Works this cold weather, but there's no saying how\r\nlong the famine may keep us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly beyond October, I should think,\" said Martyn. \"It will be\r\nended, one way or the other, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we've nearly a week of this,\" said William. \"Sha'n't we be\r\ndusty when it's over?\"\r\n\r\nFor a night and a day they knew their surroundings, and for a\r\nnight and a day, skirting the edge of the great Indian Desert on\r\na narrow-gauge railway, they remembered how in the days of their\r\napprenticeship they had come by that road from Bombay. Then the\r\nlanguages in which the names of the stations were written\r\nchanged, and they launched south into a foreign land, where the\r\nvery smells were new. Many long and heavily laden grain-trains\r\nwere in front of them, and they could feel the hand of Jimmy\r\nHawkins from far off. They waited in extemporised sidings while\r\nprocessions of empty trucks returned to the north, and were\r\ncoupled on to slow, crawling trains, and dropped at midnight,\r\nHeaven knew where; but it was furiously hot, and they walked to\r\nand fro among sacks, and dogs howled. Then they came to an India\r\nmore strange to them than to the untravelled Englishman - the\r\nflat, red India of palm-tree, palmyra-palm, and rice - the India\r\nof the picture-books, of \"Little Harry and His Bearer\" - all dead\r\nand dry in the baking heat. They had left the incessant\r\npassenger-traffic of the north and west far and far behind them.\r\nHere the people crawled to the side of the train, holding their\r\nlittle ones in their arms; and a loaded truck would be left\r\nbehind, the men and women clustering round it like ants by\r\nspilled honey. Once in the twilight they saw on a dusty plain a\r\nregiment of little brown men, each bearing a body over his\r\nshoulder; and when the train stopped to leave yet another truck,\r\nthey perceived that the burdens were not corpses, but only\r\nfoodless folk picked up beside dead oxen by a corps of Irregular\r\ntroops. Now they met more white men, here one and there two,\r\nwhose tents stood close to the line, and who came armed with\r\nwritten authorities and angry words to cut off a truck. They were\r\ntoo busy to do more than nod at Scott and Martyn, and stare\r\ncuriously at William, who could do nothing except make tea, and\r\nwatch how her men staved off the rush of wailing, walking\r\nskeletons, putting them down three at a time in heaps, with their\r\nown hands uncoupling the marked trucks, or taking receipts from\r\nthe hollow-eyed, weary white men, who spoke another argot\r\nthan theirs. They ran out of ice, out of soda-water, and out of\r\ntea; for they were six days and seven nights on the road, and it\r\nseemed to them like seven times seven years.\r\n\r\nAt last, in a dry, hot dawn, in a land of death, lit by long red\r\nfires of railway-sleepers, where they were burning the dead,\r\nthey came to their destination, and were met by Jim Hawkins, the\r\nHead of the Famine, unshaven, unwashed, but cheery, and entirely\r\nin command of affairs.\r\n\r\nMartyn, he decreed then and there, was to live on trains till\r\nfurther orders; was to go back with empty trucks, filling them\r\nwith starving people as he found them, and dropping them at a\r\nfamine-camp on the edge of the Eight Districts.  He would pick\r\nup supplies and return, and his constables would guard the loaded\r\ngrain-cars, also picking up people, and would drop them at a\r\ncamp a hundred miles south. Scott Hawkins was very glad to see\r\nScott again - would that same hour take charge of a convoy of\r\nbullock-carts, and would go south, feeding as he went, to yet\r\nanother famine-camp, where he would leave his starving -there\r\nwould he no lack of starving on the route - and wait for orders\r\nby telegraph.Generally, Scott was in all small things to act as\r\nhe thought best.\r\n\r\nWilliam bit her under lip. There was no one in the wide world\r\nlike her one brother, but Martyn's orders gave him no discretion.\r\n\r\nShe came out on the platform, masked with dust from head to foot,\r\na horse-shoe wrinkle on her forehead, put here by much thinking\r\nduring the past week, but as self-possessed as ever. Mrs. Jim -\r\nwho should have been Lady Jim but that no one remembered the\r\ntitle - took possession of her with a little gasp.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm so glad you're here,\" she almost sobbed. \"You oughtn't\r\nto, of course, but there -there isn't another woman in the\r\nplace, and we must help each other, you know; and we've all the\r\nwretched people and the little babies they are selling.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen some,\" said William.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it ghastly? I've bought twenty; they're in our camp; but\r\nwon't you have something to eat first?  We've more than ten\r\npeople can do here; and I've got a horse for you. Oh, I'm so\r\nglad you've come, dear. You're a Punjabi, too, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Steady, Lizzie,\" said Hawkins, over his shoulder. \"We'll look\r\nafter you, Miss Martyn. 'Sorry I can't ask you to breakfast,\r\nMartyn. You'll have to eat as you go. Leave two of your men to\r\nhelp Scott. These poor devils can't stand up to load carts.\r\nSaunders\" (this to the engine-driver, who was half asleep in the\r\ncab), \"back down and get those empties away. You've 'line clear'\r\nto Anundrapillay; they'll give you orders north of that. Scott,\r\nload up your carts from that B. P. P. truck, and be off as soon\r\nas you can.  The Eurasian in the pink shirt is your interpreter\r\nand guide. You'll find an apothecary of sorts tied to the yoke of\r\nthe second wagon.  He's been trying to bolt; you'll have to look\r\nafter him.  Lizzie, drive Miss Martyn to camp, and tell them to\r\nsend the red horse down here for me.\"\r\n\r\nScott, with Faiz Ullah and two policemen, was already busied with\r\nthe carts, backing them up to the truck and unbolting the\r\nsideboards quietly, while the others pitched in the bags of\r\nmillet and wheat. Hawkins watched him for as long as it took to\r\nfill one cart.\r\n\r\n\"That's a good man,\" he said.  \"If all goes well I shall work him\r\nhard.\" This was Jim Hawkins's notion of the highest compliment\r\none human being could pay another.\r\n\r\nAn hour later Scott was under way; the apothecary threatening him\r\nwith the penalties of the law for that he, a member of the\r\nSubordinate Medical Department, had been coerced and bound\r\nagainst his will and all laws governing the liberty of the\r\nsubject; the pink-shirted Eurasian begging leave to see his\r\nmother, who happened to be dying some three miles away: \"Only\r\nverree, verree short leave of absence, and will presently\r\nreturn, sar -\"; the two constables,armed with staves, bringing\r\nup the rear; and Faiz Ullah, a Mohammedan's contempt for all\r\nHindoos and foreigners in every line of his face, explaining to\r\nthe drivers that though Scott Sahib was a man to be feared on\r\nall fours, he, Faiz Ullah, was Authority Itself.\r\n\r\nThe procession creaked past Hawkins's camp - three stained tents\r\nunder a clump of dead trees, behind them the famine-shed, where\r\na crowd of hopeless ones tossed their arms around the\r\ncooking-kettles.\r\n\r\n\"'Wish to Heaven William had kept out of it,\" said Scott to\r\nhimself, after a glance. \"We'll have cholera, sure as a gun,\r\nwhen the Rains break.\"\r\n\r\nBut William seemed to have taken kindly to the operations of the\r\nFamine Code, which, when famine is declared, supersede the\r\nworkings of the ordinary law. Scott saw her, the centre of a mob\r\nof weeping women, in a calico riding-habit, and a blue-grey felt\r\nhat with a gold puggaree.\r\n\r\n\"I want fifty rupees, please.  I forgot to ask Jack before he\r\nwent away. Can you lend it me? It's for condensed-milk for the\r\nbabies,\" said she.\r\n\r\nScott took the money from his belt, and handed it over without a\r\nword. \"For goodness sake, take care of yourself,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I shall be all right. We ought to get the milk in two days.\r\nBy the way, the orders are, I was to tell you, that you're to\r\ntake one of Sir Jim's horses.There's a grey Cabuli here that I\r\nthought would be just your style, so I've said you'd take him.\r\nWas that right?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's awfully good of you. We can't either of us talk much\r\nabout style, I am afraid.\"\r\n\r\nScott was in a weather-stained drill shooting-kit, very white at\r\nthe seams and a little frayed at the wrists. William regarded\r\nhim thoughtfully, from his pith helmet to his greased\r\nankle-boots. \"You look very nice, I think. Are you sure you've\r\neverything you'll need - quinine, chlorodyne, and so on?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Think so,\" said Scott, patting three or four of his\r\nshooting-pockets as he mounted and rode alongside his convoy.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye,\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, and good luck,\" said William. \"I'm awfully obliged for\r\nthe money.\" She turned on a spurred heel and disappeared into\r\nthe tent, while the carts pushed on past the famine-sheds, past\r\nthe roaring lines of the thick, fat fires, down to the baked\r\nGehenna of the South.\r\n\r\nEnd of \"WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR - PART I\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM THE CONQUERER\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nSo let us melt and make no noise, No tear-floods nor\r\nsigh-tempests move; 'Twere profanation of our joys to tell the\r\nLaity our love.  A Valediction.\r\n\r\nIt was punishing work, even though he travelled by night and\r\ncamped by day; but within the limits of his vision there was no\r\nman whom Scott could call master. He was as free as Jimmy\r\nHawkins - freer, in fact, for the Government held the Head of\r\nthe Famine tied neatly to a telegraph-wire, and if Jimmy had ever\r\nregarded telegrams seriously, the death-rate of that famine\r\nwould have been much higher than it was.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a few days' crawling Scott learned something of the\r\nsize of the India which he served, and it astonished him. His\r\ncarts, as you know, were loaded with wheat, millet, and barley,\r\ngood food-grains needing only a little grinding. But the people\r\nto whom he brought the life-giving stuffs were rice-eaters. They\r\ncould hull rice in their mortars, but they knew nothing of the\r\nheavy stone querns of the North, and less of the material that\r\nthe white man convoyed so laboriously. They clamoured for rice -\r\nunhusked paddy, such as they were accustomed to - and, when they\r\nfound that there was none, broke away weeping from the sides of\r\nthe cart. What was the use of these strange hard grains that\r\nchoked their throats? They would die. And then and there very\r\nmany of them kept their word. Others took their allowance, and\r\nbartered enough millet to feed a man through a week for a few\r\nhandfuls of rotten rice saved by some less unfortunate. A few put\r\ntheir share into the rice-mortars, pounded it, and made a paste\r\nwith foul water; but they were very few. Scott understood dimly\r\nthat many people in the India of the South ate rice, as a rule,\r\nbut he had spent his service in a grain Province, had seldom seen\r\nrice in the blade or ear, and least of all would have believed\r\nthat in time of deadly need men could die at arm's length of\r\nplenty, sooner than touch food they did not know. In vain the\r\ninterpreters interpreted; in vain his two policemen showed in\r\nvigorous pantomime what should be done. The starving crept away\r\nto their bark and weeds, grubs,  leaves, and clay, and left the\r\nopen sacks untouched. But sometimes the women laid their phantoms\r\nof children at Scott's feet, looking back as they staggered away.\r\n\r\nFaiz Ullah opined it was the will of God that these foreigners\r\nshould die, and it remained only to give orders to burn the\r\ndead. None the less there was no reason why the Sahib should lack\r\nhis comforts, and Faiz Ullah, a campaigner of experience, had\r\npicked up a few lean goats and had added them to the procession.\r\nThat they might give milk for the morning meal, he was feeding\r\nthem on the good grain that these imbeciles rejected. \"Yes,\" said\r\nFaiz Ullah; \"if the Sahib thought fit, a little milk might be\r\ngiven to some of the babies\"; but, as the Sahib well knew, babies\r\nwere cheap, and, for his own part, Faiz Ullah held that there was\r\nno Government order as to babies. Scott spoke forcefully to Faiz\r\nUllah and the two policemen, and bade them capture goats where\r\nthey could find them. This they most joyfully did, for it was a\r\nrecreation, and many ownerless goats were driven in. Once fed,\r\nthe poor brutes were willing enough to follow the carts, and a\r\nfew days' good food - food such as human beings died for lack of\r\n- set them in milk again.\r\n\r\n\"But I am no goatherd,\" said Faiz Ullah. \"It is against my izzat\r\n[my honour].\"\r\n\r\n\"When we cross the Bias River again we will talk of izzat,\" Scott\r\nreplied. \"Till that day thou and the policemen shall be sweepers\r\nto the camp, if I give the order.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus, then, it is done,\" grunted Faiz Ullah, \"if the Sahib will\r\nhave it so\"; and he showed how a goat should be milked, while\r\nScott stood over him.\r\n\r\n\"Now we will feed them,\" said Scott; \"twice a day we will feed\r\nthem\"; and he bowed his back to the milking, and took a horrible\r\ncramp.\r\n\r\nWhen you have to keep connection unbroken between a restless\r\nmother of kids and a baby who is at the point of death, you\r\nsuffer in all your system. But the babies were fed. Each morning\r\nand evening Scott would solemnly lift them out one by one from\r\ntheir nest of gunny-bags under the cart-tilts. There were always\r\nmany who could do no more than breathe, and the milk was dropped\r\ninto their toothless mouths drop by drop, with due pauses when\r\nthey choked. Each morning, too, the goats were fed; and since\r\nthey would straggle without a leader, and since the natives were\r\nhirelings, Scott was forced to give up riding, and pace slowly at\r\nthe head of his flocks, accommodating his step to their\r\nweaknesses. All this was sufficiently absurd, and he felt the\r\nabsurdity keenly; but at least he was saving life, and when the\r\nwomen saw that their children did not die, they made shift to eat\r\na little of the strange foods, and crawled after the carts,\r\nblessing the master of the goats.\r\n\r\n\"Give the women something to live for,\" said Scott to himself, as\r\nhe sneezed in the dust of a hundred little feet, \"and they'll\r\nhang on somehow. This beats William's condensed-milk trick all to\r\npieces. I shall never live it down, though.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached his destination very slowly, found that a rice-ship\r\nhad come in from Burmah, and that stores of paddy were\r\navailable; found also an overworked Englishman in charge of the\r\nshed, and, loading the carts, set back to cover the ground he\r\nhad already passed. He left some of the children and half his\r\ngoats at the famine-shed. For this he was not thanked by the\r\nEnglishman, who had already more stray babies than he knew what\r\nto do with.  Scott's back was suppled to stooping now, and he\r\nwent on with his wayside ministrations in addition to\r\ndistributing the paddy. More babies and more goats were added\r\nunto him; but now some of the babies wore rags, and beads round\r\ntheir wrists or necks. \"That\" said the interpreter, as though\r\nScott did not know, \"signifies that their mothers hope in\r\neventual contingency to resume them offeecially.\"\r\n\r\nThe sooner, the better,\" said Scott; but at the same time he\r\nmarked, with the pride of ownership, how this or that little\r\nRamasawmy was putting on flesh like a bantam.  As the\r\npaddy-carts were emptied he headed for Hawkins's camp by the\r\nrailway, timing his arrival to fit in with the dinner-hour, for\r\nit was long since he had eaten at a cloth. He had no desire to\r\nmake any dramatic entry, but an accident of the sunset ordered\r\nit that when he had taken off his helmet to get the evening\r\nbreeze, the low light should fall across his forehead, and he\r\ncould not see what was before him; while one waiting at the tent\r\ndoor beheld with new eyes a young man, beautiful as Paris, a god\r\nin a halo of golden dust, walking slowly at the head of his\r\nflocks, while at his knee ran small naked Cupids. But she\r\nlaughed - William, in a slate-coloured blouse, laughed\r\nconsumedly till Scott, putting the best face he could upon the\r\nmatter, halted his armies and bade her admire the kindergarten.\r\nIt was an unseemly sight, but the proprieties had been left ages\r\nago, with the tea-party at Amritsar Station, fifteen hundred\r\nmiles to the north.\r\n\r\n\"They are coming on nicely,\" said William. \"We've only\r\nfive-and-twenty here now.  The women are beginning to take them\r\naway again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you in charge of the babies, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes - Mrs. Jim and I. We didn't think of goats, though.  We've\r\nbeen trying condensed-milk and water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any losses?\"\r\n\r\nMore than I care to think of;\" said William, with a shudder.\r\n\"And you?\"\r\n\r\nScott said nothing. There had been many little burials along his\r\nroute - one cannot burn a dead baby - many mothers who had wept\r\nwhen they did not find again the children they had trusted to\r\nthe care of the Government.\r\n\r\nThen Hawkins came out carrying a razor, at which Scott looked\r\nhungrily, for he had a beard that he did not love.  And when\r\nthey sat down to dinner in the tent he told his tale in few\r\nwords, as it might have been an official report.  Mrs. Jim\r\nsnuffled from time to time, and Jim bowed his head judicially;\r\nbut William's grey eyes were on the clean-shaven face, and it\r\nwas to her that Scott seemed to appeal.\r\n\r\n\"Good for the Pauper Province!\" said William, her chin on her\r\nhand, as she leaned forward among the wine~glasses. Her cheeks\r\nhad fallen in, and the scar on her forehead was more prominent\r\nthan ever, but the well-turned neck rose roundly as a column\r\nfrom the ruffle of the blouse which was the accepted\r\nevening-dress in camp.\r\n\r\n\"It was awfully absurd at times,\" said Scott. \"You see, I didn't\r\nknow much about milking or babies. They'll chaff my head off, if\r\nthe tale goes up North.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let 'em,\" said William, haughtily. \"We've all done coolie-work\r\nsince we came. I know Jack has.\" This was to Hawkins's address,\r\nand the big man smiled blandly.\r\n\r\n\"Your brother's a highly efficient officer, William,\" said he,\r\n\"and I've done him the honour of treating him as he deserves.\r\nRemember, I write the confidential reports.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must say that William's worth her weight in gold,\" said\r\nMrs. Jim. \"I don't know what we should have done without her. She\r\nhas been everything to us.\" She dropped her hand upon William's,\r\nwhich was rough with much handling of reins, and William patted\r\nit softly. Jim beamed on the company. Things were going well with\r\nhis world.  Three of his more grossly incompetent men had died,\r\nand their places had been filled by their betters. Every day\r\nbrought the Rains nearer. They had put out the famine in five of\r\nthe Eight Districts, and, after all, the death-rate had not been\r\ntoo heavy - things considered. He looked Scott over carefully, as\r\nan ogre looks over a man, and rejoiced in his thews and iron-hard\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\"He's just the least bit in the world tucked up,\" said Jim to\r\nhimself, \"but he can do two men's work yet.\" Then he was aware\r\nthat Mrs. Jim was telegraphing to him, and according to the\r\ndomestic code the message ran: \"A clear case. Look at them!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked and listened. All that William was saying was: \"What\r\ncan you expect of a country where they call a bhistee [a\r\nwater-carrier] a tunni-cutch?\" and all that Scott answered was:\r\n\"I shall be glad to get back to the Club. Save me a dance at the\r\nChristmas Ball, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a far cry from here to the Lawrence Hall,\" said Jim.\r\n\"Better turn in early, Scott.  It's paddy-carts to-morrow;\r\nyou'll begin loading at five.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going to give Mr. Scott a single day's rest?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Wish I could, Lizzie, but I'm afraid I can't. As long as he can\r\nstand up we must use him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've had one Europe evening, at least. By Jove, I'd nearly\r\nforgotten! What do I do about those babies of mine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave them here,\" said William -\" we are in charge of that - and\r\nas many goats as you can spare.  I must learn how to milk now.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you care to get up early enough to-morrow I'll show you. I\r\nhave to milk, you see. Half of 'em have beads and things round\r\ntheir necks. You must be careful not to take 'em off; in case\r\nthe mothers turn up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget I've had some experience here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope to goodness you won't overdo.\" Scott's voice was\r\nunguarded.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take care of her,\" said Mrs. Jim, telegraphing hundred-word\r\nmessages as she carried William off; while Jim gave Scott his\r\norders for the coming campaign. It was very late - nearly nine\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\n\"Jim, you're a brute,\" said his wife, that night; and the Head of\r\nthe Famine chuckled.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it, dear.  I remember doing the first Jandiala\r\nSettlement for the sake of a girl in a crinoline, and she was\r\nslender, Lizzie.  I've never done as good a piece of work since.\r\nHe'll work like a demon.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you might have given him one day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And let things come to a head now?  No, dear; it's their\r\nhappiest time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe either of the darlings know what's the matter\r\nwith them.  Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it lovely?\"\r\n\r\n\"Getting up at three to learn to milk, bless her heart! Oh, ye\r\nGods, why must we grow old and fat?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's a darling. She has done more work under me -\"\r\n\r\n\"Under you?  The day after she came she was in charge and you\r\nwere her subordinate.  You've stayed there ever since; she\r\nmanages you almost as well as you manage me.\"\r\n\r\n\"She doesn't, and that's why I love her.  She's as direct as a\r\nman - as her brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her brother's weaker than she is. He's always to me for orders;\r\nbut he's honest, and a glutton for work.  I confess I'm rather\r\nfond of William, and if I had a daughter -\"\r\n\r\nThe talk ended.  Far away in the Derajat was a child's grave more\r\nthan twenty years old, and neither Jim nor his wife spoke of it\r\nany more.\r\n\r\nAll the same, you're responsible,\" Jim added, a moment's silence.\r\n\r\n\"Bless 'em!\" said Mrs. Jim, sleepily.\r\n\r\nBefore the stars paled, Scott, who slept in an empty cart, waked\r\nand went about his work in silence; it seemed at that hour\r\nunkind to rouse Faiz Ullah and the interpreter.  His head being\r\nclose to the ground, he did not hear William till she stood over\r\nhim in the dingy old riding-habit, her eyes still heavy with\r\nsleep, a cup of tea and a piece of toast in her hands.  There\r\nwas a baby on the ground, squirming on a piece of blanket, and a\r\nsix-year-old child peered over Scott's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Hai, you little rip,\" said Scott, \"how the deuce do you expect\r\nto get your rations if you aren't quiet?\"\r\n\r\nA cool white hand steadied the brat, who forthwith choked as the\r\nmilk gurgled into his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"'Mornin',\" said the milker.  \"You've no notion how these little\r\nfellows can wriggle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I have.\"  She whispered, because the world was asleep.\r\n\"Only I feed them with a spoon or a rag.  Yours are fatter than\r\nmine. .And you've been doing this day after day?\" The voice was\r\nalmost lost.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; it was absurd.  Now you try,\" he said, giving place to the\r\ngirl.  \"Look out! A goat's not a cow.\"\r\n\r\nThe goat protested against the amateur, and there was a scuffle,\r\nin which Scott snatched up the baby. Then it was all to do over\r\nagain, and William laughed softly and merrily.  She managed,\r\nhowever, to feed two babies, and a third.\r\n\r\n\"Don't the little beggars take it well?\" said Scott.  \"I trained\r\n'em.\"\r\n\r\nThey were very busy and interested, when lo! it was broad\r\ndaylight, and before they knew, the camp was awake, and they\r\nkneeled among the goats, surprised by the day, both flushed to\r\nthe temples.  Yet all the round world rolling up out of the\r\ndarkness might have heard and seen all that had passed between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said William, unsteadily, snatching up the tea and toast,\r\n\"I had this made for you.  It's stone-cold now.  I thought you\r\nmightn't have anything ready so early. 'Better not drink it.\r\nIt's - it's stone-cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's awfully kind of you.  It's just right. It's awfully good\r\nof you, really.  I'll leave my kids and goats with you and Mrs.\r\nJim, and, of course, any one in camp can show you about the\r\nmilking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said William; and she grew pinker and pinker and\r\nstatelier and more stately, as she strode back to her tent,\r\nfanning herself with the saucer.\r\n\r\nThere were shrill lamentations through the camp when the elder\r\nchildren saw their nurse move off without them.  Faiz Ullah\r\nunbent so far as to jest with the policemen, and Scott turned\r\npurple with shame because Hawkins, already in the saddle,\r\nroared.\r\n\r\nA child escaped from the care of Mrs. Jim, and, running like a\r\nrabbit, clung to Scott's boot, William pursuing with long, easy\r\nstrides.\r\n\r\n\"I will not go - I will not go!\" shrieked the child, twining his\r\nfeet round Scott's ankle. They will kill me here. I do not know\r\nthese people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" said Scott, in broken Tamil, \"I say, she will do you no\r\nharm. Go with her and be well fed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" said William, panting, with a wrathful glance at Scott,\r\nwho stood helpless and, as it were, hamstrung.\r\n\r\n\"Go back,\" said Scott quickly to William. I'll send the little\r\nchap over in a minute.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone of authority had its effect, but in a way Scott did not\r\nexactly intend. The boy loosened his grasp, and said with\r\ngravity: \"I did not know the woman was thine. I will go.\" Then\r\nhe cried to his companions, a mob of three-, four-, and\r\nfive-year-olds waiting on the success of his venture ere they\r\nstampeded: \"Go back and eat. It is our man's woman. She will\r\nobey his orders.\"\r\n\r\nJim collapsed where he sat; Faiz Ullah and the two policemen\r\ngrinned; and Scott's orders to the cartmen flew like hail.\r\n\r\n\"That is the custom of the Sahibs when truth is told in their\r\npresence,\" said Faiz Ullah. \"The time comes that I must seek new\r\nservice. Young wives, especially such as speak our language and\r\nhave knowledge of the ways of the Police, make great trouble for\r\nhonest butlers in the matter of weekly accounts.\"\r\n\r\nWhat William thought of it all she did not say, but when her\r\nbrother, ten days later, came to camp for orders, and heard of\r\nScott's performances, he said, laughing: \"Well, that settles it.\r\nHe'll be Bakri Scott to the end of his days.\"  (Bakri in the\r\nNorthern vernacular, means a goat.) \"What a lark! I'd have given\r\na month's pay to have seen him nursing famine babies. I fed some\r\nwith conjee [rice-water], but that was all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's perfectly disgusting,\" said his sister, with blazing eyes.\r\n\"A man does something like -like that - and all you other men\r\nthink of is to give him an absurd nickname, and then you laugh\r\nand think it's funny.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Mrs. Jim, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can't talk, William. You christened little Miss Demby\r\nthe Button-quail, last cold weather; you know you did. India's\r\nthe land of nicknames.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's different,\" William replied. \"She was only a girl, and\r\nshe hadn't done anything except walk like a quail, and she does.\r\nBut it isn't fair to make fun of a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Scott won't care,\" said Martyn. \"You can't get a rise out of old\r\nScotty. I've been trying for eight years, and you've only known\r\nhim for three. How does he look?\"\r\n\r\n\"He looks very well,\" said William, and went away with a flushed\r\ncheek. \"Bakri Scott, indeed!\" Then she laughed to herself, for\r\nshe knew her country. \"But it will he Bakri all the same\"; and\r\nshe repeated it under her breath several times slowly,\r\nwhispering it into favour.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to his duties on the railway, Martyn spread the\r\nname far and wide among his associates, so that Scott met it as\r\nhe led his paddy-carts to war. The natives believed it to be\r\nsome English title of honour, and the cart-drivers used it in\r\nall simplicity till Faiz Ullah, who did not approve of foreign\r\njapes, broke their heads. There was very little time for milking\r\nnow, except at the big camps, where Jim had extended Scott's\r\nidea and was feeding large flocks on the useless northern\r\ngrains. Sufficient paddy had come now into the Eight Districts\r\nto hold the people safe, if it were only distributed quickly,\r\nand for that purpose no one was better than the big Canal\r\nofficer, who never lost his temper, never gave an unnecessary\r\norder, and never questioned an order given. Scott pressed on,\r\nsaving his cattle, washing their galled necks daily, so that no\r\ntime should be lost on the road; reported himself with his rice\r\nat the minor famine-sheds, unloaded, and went back light by\r\nforced night-march to the next distributing centre, to find\r\nHawkins's unvarying telegram:  \"Do it again.\" And he did it\r\nagain and again, and yet again, while Jim Hawkins, fifty miles\r\naway, marked off on a big map the tracks of his wheels\r\ngridironing the stricken lands. Others did well - Hawkins\r\nreported at the end they all did well - but Scott was the most\r\nexcellent, for he kept good coined rupees by him, settled for\r\nhis own cart-repairs on the spot, and ran to meet all sorts of\r\nunconsidered extras, trusting to be recouped later on.\r\nTheoretically, the Government should have paid for every shoe\r\nand iinchpin, for every hand employed in the loading; but\r\nGovernment vouchers cash themselves slowly, and intelligent and\r\nefficient clerks write at great length, contesting unauthorised\r\nexpenditures of eight annas. The man who wants to make his work\r\na success must draw on his own bank-account of money or other\r\nthings as he goes.\r\n\r\n\"I told you he'd work,\" said Jimmy to his wife, at the end of six\r\nweeks.  \"He's been in sole charge of a couple of thousand men up\r\nnorth, on the Mosuhl Canal, for a year; but he gives less\r\ntrouble than young Martyn with his ten constables; and I'm\r\nmorally certain - only Government doesn't recognise moral\r\nobligations - he's spent about half his pay to grease his\r\nwheels.  Look at this, Lizzie, for one week's work! Forty miles\r\nin two days with twelve carts; two days' halt building a\r\nfamine-shed for young Rogers. (Rogers ought to have built it\r\nhimself, the idiot!) Then forty miles back again, loading six\r\ncarts on the way, and distributing all Sunday. Then in the\r\nevening he pitches in a twenty-page Demi-Official to me, saying\r\nthe people where he is might be 'advantageously employed on\r\nrelief-work,' and suggesting that he put 'em to work on some\r\nbroken-down old reservoir he's discovered, so as to have a good\r\nwater-supply when the Rains break. 'Thinks he can cauk the dam\r\nin a fortnight.  Look at his marginal sketches - aren't they\r\nclear and good ~ I knew he was pukka, but I didn't know he was\r\nas pukka as this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must show these to William,\" said Mrs. Jim. \"The child's\r\nwearing herself out among the babies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not more than you are, dear. Well, another two months ought to\r\nsee us out of the wood. I'm sorry it's not in my power to\r\nrecommend you for a V. C.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam sat late in her tent that night, reading through page\r\nafter page of the square handwriting, patting the sketches of\r\nproposed repairs to the reservoir, and wrinkling her eyebrows\r\nover the columns of figures of estimated water-supply.\"And he\r\nfinds time to do all this,\" she cried to herself, \"and-well, I\r\nalso was present. I've saved one or two babies.\r\n\r\nShe dreamed for the twentieth time of the god in the golden dust,\r\nand woke refreshed to feed loathsome black children, scores of\r\nthem, wastrels picked up by the wayside, their bones almost\r\nbreaking their skin, terrible and covered with sores.\r\n\r\nScott was not allowed to leave his cart-work, but his letter was\r\nduly forwarded to the Government, and he had the consolation,\r\nnot rare in India, of knowing that another man was reaping where\r\nhe had sown. That also was discipline profitable to the soul.\r\n\r\n\"He's much too good to waste on canals,\" said Jimmy. \"Any one can\r\noversee coolies. You needn't be angry, William; he can - but I\r\nneed my pearl among bullock-drivers, and I've transferred him to\r\nthe Khanda district, where he'll have it all to do over again. He\r\nshould be marching now.\r\n\r\n\"He's not a coolie,\" said William, furiously. \"He ought to be\r\ndoing his regulation work.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's the best man in his service, and that's saying a good deal;\r\nbut if you must use razors to cut grindstones, why, I prefer the\r\nbest cutlery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it almost time we saw him again?\" said Mrs. Jim. \"I'm sure\r\nthe poor boy hasn't had a respectable meal for a month. He\r\nprobably sits on a cart and eats sardines with his fingers.\"\r\n\r\n\"All in good time, dear. Duty before decency - wasn't it Mr.\r\nChucks said that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it was Midshipman Easy,\" William laughed. \"I sometimes\r\nwonder how it will feel to dance or listen to a band again, or\r\nsit under a roof. I can't believe I ever wore a ball-frock in my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"One minute,\" said Mrs. Jim, who was thinking. \"If he goes to\r\nKhanda, he passes within five miles of us. Of course he'll ride\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, he won't,\" said William.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will take him off his work. He won't have time.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll make it,\" said Mrs. Jim, with a twinkle.\r\n\r\n \"It depends on his own judgment. There's absolutely no reason\r\nwhy he shouldn't, if he thinks fit,\" said Jim.\r\n\r\n\"He won't see fit,\" William replied, without sorrow or emotion.\r\n\"It wouldn't be him if he did.\"\r\n\r\n\"One certainly gets to know people rather well in times like\r\nthese,\" said Jim, drily; but William's face was serene as ever,\r\nand even as she prophesied, Scott did not appear.\r\n\r\nThe Rains fell at last, late, but heavily; and the dry, gashed\r\nearth was red mud, and servants killed snakes in the camp, where\r\nevery one was weather-bound for a fortnight - all except\r\nHawkins, who took horse and plashed about in the wet, rejoicing.\r\nNow the Government decreed that seed-grain should be distributed\r\nto the people, as well as advances of money for the purchase of\r\nnew oxen; and the white men were doubly worked for this new duty,\r\nwhile William skipped from brick to brick laid down on the\r\ntrampled mud, and dosed her charges with warming medicines that\r\nmade them rub their little round stomachs; and the milch goats\r\nthrove on the rank grass. There was never a word from Scott in\r\nthe Khanda district, away to the southeast, except the regular\r\ntelegraphic report to Hawkins. The rude country roads had\r\ndisappeared; his drivers were half mutinous; one of Martyn's\r\nloaned policemen had died of cholera; and Scott was taking thirty\r\ngrains of quinine a day to fight the fever that comes with the\r\nrain: but those were things Scott did not consider necessary to\r\nreport. He was, as usual, working from a base of supplies on a\r\nrailway line, to cover a circle of fifteen miles radius, and\r\nsince full loads were impossible, he took quarter-loads, and\r\ntoiled four times as hard by consequence; for he did not choose\r\nto risk an epidemic which might have grown uncontrollable by\r\nassembling villagers in thousands at the relief-sheds. It was\r\ncheaper to take Government bullocks, work them to death, and\r\nleave them to the crows in the wayside sloughs.\r\n\r\nThat was the time when eight years of clean living and hard\r\ncondition told, though a man's head were ringing like a bell\r\nfrom the cinchona, and the earth swayed under his feet when he\r\nstood and under his bed when he slept. If Hawkins had seen fit\r\nto make him a bullock-driver, that, he thought, was entirely\r\nHawkins's own affair.  There were men in the North who would\r\nknow what he had done; men of thirty years' service in his own\r\ndepartment who would say that it was \"not half bad\"; and above,\r\nimmeasurably above, all men of all grades, there was William in\r\nthe thick of the fight, who would approve because she understood.\r\nHe had so trained his mind that it would hold fast to the\r\nmechanical routine of the day, though his own voice sounded\r\nstrange in his own ears, and his hands, when he wrote, grew\r\nlarge as pillows or small as peas at the end of his wrists. That\r\nsteadfastness bore his body to the telegraph-office at the\r\nrailway-station, and dictated a telegram to Hawkins saying that\r\nthe Khanda district was, in his judgment, now safe, and he\r\n\"waited further orders.\"\r\n\r\nThe Madrassee telegraph-clerk did not approve of a large, gaunt\r\nman falling over him in a dead faint, not so much because of the\r\nweight as because of the names and blows that Faiz Ullah dealt\r\nhim when he found the body rolled under a bench. Then Faiz Ullah\r\ntook blankets, quilts, and coverlets where he found them, and lay\r\ndown under them at his master's side, and bound his arms with a\r\ntent-rope, and filled him with a horrible stew of herbs, and set\r\nthe policeman to fight him when he wished to escape from the\r\nintolerable heat of his coverings, and shut the door of the\r\ntelegraph-office to keep out the curious for two nights and one\r\nday; and when a light engine came down the line, and Hawkins\r\nkicked in the door, Scott hailed him weakly but in a natural\r\nvoice, and Faiz Ullah stood back and took all the credit.\r\n\r\n\"For two nights, Heaven-born, he was pagal\" said Faiz Ullah.\r\n\"Look at my nose, and consider the eye of the policeman. He beat\r\nus with his bound hands; but we sat upon him, Heaven-born, and\r\nthough his words were tez, we sweated him. Heaven-born, never has\r\nbeen such a sweat! He is weaker now than a child; but the fever\r\nhas gone out of him, by the grace of God. There remains only my\r\nnose and the eye of the constabeel. Sahib, shall I ask for my\r\ndismissal because my Sahib has beaten me?\" And Faiz Ullah laid\r\nhis long thin hand carefully on Scott's chest to be sure that the\r\nfever was all gone, ere he went out to open tinned soups and\r\ndiscourage such as laughed at his swelled nose.\r\n\r\n\"The district's all right,\" Scott whispered.  \"It doesn't make\r\nany difference. You got my wire?\"  I shall be fit in a week.\r\n'Can't understand how it happened. I shall be fit in a few\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're coming into camp with us,\" said Hawkins.\r\n\r\n\"But look here - but -\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all over except the shouting. We sha'n't need you Punjabis\r\nany more. On my honour, we sha'n't. Martyn goes back in a few\r\nweeks; Arbuthnot's returned already; Ellis and Clay are putting\r\nthe last touches to a new feeder-line the Government's built as\r\nrelief-work. Morten's dead - he was a Bengal man, though; you\r\nwouldn't know him. 'Pon my word, you and Will - Miss Martyn -\r\nseem to have come through it as well as anybody.\"- \"Oh, how is\r\nshe, by-the-way\".\" The voice went up and down as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Going strong when I left her. The Roman Catholic Missions are\r\nadopting the unclaimed babies to turn them into little priests;\r\nthe Basil Mission is taking some, and the mothers are taking the\r\nrest. You should hear the little beggars howl when they're sent\r\naway from William. She's pulled down a bit, but so are we all.\r\nNow, when do you suppose you'll be able to move?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't come into camp in this state. I won't,\" he replied\r\npettishly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are rather a sight, but from what I gathered there it\r\nseemed to me they'd be glad to see you under any conditions.\r\nI'll look over your work here, if you like, for a couple of\r\ndays, and you can pull yourself together while Faiz Ullah feeds\r\nyou up.\"\r\n\r\nScott could walk dizzily by the time Hawkins's inspection was\r\nended, and he flushed all over when Jim said of his work that it\r\nwas \"not half bad,\" and volunteered, further, that he had\r\nconsidered Scott his right-hand man through the famine, and\r\nwould feel it his duty to say as much officially.\r\n\r\nSo they came back by rail to the old camp; but there were no\r\ncrowds near it; the long fires in the trenches were dead and\r\nblack, and the famine-sheds were almost empty.\r\n\r\n\"You see!\" said Jim. \"There isn't much more to do. 'Better ride\r\nup and see the wife. They've pitched a tent for you. Dinner's at\r\nseven. I've some work here.\"\r\n\r\nRiding at a foot-pace, Faiz Ullah by his stirrup, Scott came to\r\nWilliam in the brown-calico riding-habit, sitting at the\r\ndining-tent door, her hands in her lap, white as ashes, thin and\r\nworn, with no lustre in her hair. There did not seem to be any\r\nMrs. Jim on the horizon, and all that William could say was: \"My\r\nword, how pulled down you look!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've had a touch of fever. You don't look very well yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm fit enough. We've stamped it out. I suppose you know?\"\r\n\r\nScott nodded. \"We shall all be returned in a few weeks. Hawkins\r\ntold me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before Christmas, Mrs. Jim says. Sha'n't you be glad to go back\r\n~ I can smell the wood-smoke already\"; William sniffed. \"We\r\nshall be in time for all the Christmas doings.  I don't suppose\r\neven the Punjab Government would be base enough to transfer Jack\r\ntill the new year?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems hundreds of years ago - the Punjab and all that -\r\ndoesn't it?  Are you glad you came?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now it's all over, yes. It has been ghastly here, though. You\r\nknow we had to sit still and do nothing, and Sir Jim was away so\r\nmuch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do nothing! How did you get on with the milking?\"\r\n\r\n\"I managed it somehow - after you taught me. 'Remember?\"\r\n\r\nThen the talk stopped with an almost audible jar. Still no Mrs.\r\nJim.\r\n\r\n\"That reminds me, I owe you fifty rupees for the condensed-milk.\r\nI thought perhaps you'd be coming here when you were transferred\r\nto the Khanda district, and I could pay you then; but you\r\ndidn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I passed within five miles of the camp, but it was in the middle\r\nof a march, you see, and the carts were breaking down every few\r\nminutes, and I couldn't get 'em over the ground till ten o'clock\r\nthat night. I wanted to come awfully. You knew I did, didn't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"I - believe - I - did,\" said William, facing him with level\r\neyes. She was no longer white.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why you didn't ride in? Of course I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\"Because you couldn't, of course. I knew that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you care?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you had come in - but I knew you wouldn't - but if you had, I\r\nshould have cared a great deal. You know I should.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God I didn't! Oh, but I wanted to! I couldn't trust myself\r\nto ride in front of the carts, because I kept edging 'em over\r\nhere, don't you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew you wouldn't,\" said William, contentedly. \"Here's your\r\nfifty.\"\r\n\r\nScott bent forward and kissed the hand that held the greasy\r\nnotes. Its fellow patted him awkwardly but very tenderly on the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"And you knew, too, didn't you?\" said William, in a new voice.\r\n\r\n\"No, on my honour, I didn't. I hadn't the - the cheek to expect\r\nanything of the kind, except . . I say, were you out riding\r\nanywhere the day I passed by to Khanda?\"\r\n\r\nWilliam nodded, and smiled after the manner of an angel surprised\r\nin a good deed.\r\n\r\n\"Then it was just a speck I saw of your habit in the -\"\r\n\r\n\"Palm-grove on the Southern cart-road. I saw your helmet when you\r\ncame up from the mullah by the temple - just enough to be sure\r\nthat you were all right. D' you care?\"\r\n\r\nThis time Scott did not kiss her hand, for they were in the dusk\r\nof the dining-tent, and, because William's knees were trembling\r\nunder her, she had to sit down in the nearest chair, where she\r\nwept long and happily, her head on her arms; and when Scott\r\nimagined that it would be well to comfort her, she needing\r\nnothing of the kind, she ran to her own tent; and Scott went out\r\ninto the world, and smiled upon it largely and idiotically. But\r\nwhen Faiz Ullah brought him a drink, he found it necessary to\r\nsupport one hand with the other, or the good whisky and soda\r\nwould have been spilled abroad. There are fevers and fevers.\r\n\r\nBut it was worse - much worse - the strained, eye-shirking talk\r\nat dinner till the servants had withdrawn, and worst of all when\r\nMrs. Jim, who had been on the edge of weeping from the soup down,\r\nkissed Scott and William, and they drank one whole bottle of\r\nchampagne, hot, because there was no ice, and Scott and William\r\nsat outside the tent in the starlight till Mrs. Jim drove them in\r\nfor fear of more fever.\r\n\r\nApropos of these things and some others William said: \"Being\r\nengaged is abominable, because, you see, one has no official\r\nposition. We must be thankful we've lots of things to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Things to do!\" said Jim, when that was reported to him.\r\n\"They're neither of them any good any more.  I can't get five\r\nhours' work a day out of Scott. He's in the clouds half the\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but they're so beautiful to watch, Jimmy. It will break my\r\nheart when they go. Can't you do anything for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've given the Government the impression - at least, I hope I\r\nhave - that he personally conducted the entire famine. But all\r\nhe wants is to get on to the Luni Canal Works, and William's\r\njust as bad. Have you ever heard 'em talking of barrage and\r\naprons and waste-water ~ It's their style of spooning, I\r\nsuppose.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Jim smiled tenderly. \"Ah, that's in the intervals - bless\r\n'em.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so Love ran about the camp unrebuked in broad daylight, while\r\nmen picked up the pieces and put them neatly away of the Famine\r\nin the Eight Districts.\r\n\r\nMorning brought the penetrating chill of the Northern December,\r\nthe layers of wood-smoke, the dusty grey-blue of the tamarisks,\r\nthe domes of ruined tombs, and all the smell of the white\r\nNorthern plains, as the mail-train ran on to the mile-long Sutlej\r\nBridge.  William, wrapped in a poshteen - a silk-embroidered\r\nsheepskin jacket trimmed with rough astrakhan - looked out with\r\nmoist eyes and nostrils that dilated joyously. The South of\r\npagodas and palm-trees, the overpopulated Hindu South, was done\r\nwith.  Here was the land she knew and loved, and before her lay\r\nthe good life she understood, among folk of her own caste and\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThey were picking them up at almost every station now - men and\r\nwomen coming in for the Christmas Week, with racquets, with\r\nbundles of polo-sticks, with dear and bruised cricket-bats, with\r\nfox-terriers and saddles.  The greater part of them wore jackets\r\nlike William's, for the Northern cold is as little to be trifled\r\nwith as the Northern heat.  And William was among them and of\r\nthem, her hands deep in her pockets, her collar turned up over\r\nher ears, stamping her feet on the platforms as she walked up and\r\ndown to get warm, visiting from carriage to carriage and\r\neverywhere being congratulated. Scott was with the bachelors at\r\nthe far end of the train, where they chaffed him mercilessly\r\nabout feeding babies and milking goats; but from time to time he\r\nwould stroll up to William's window, and murmur: \"Good enough,\r\nisn't it?\" and William would answer with sighs of pure delight:\r\n\"Good enough, indeed.\" The large open names of the home towns\r\nwere good to listen to. Umballa, Ludianah, Phillour, Jullundur,\r\nthey rang like the coming marriage-bells in her ears, and William\r\nfelt deeply and truly sorry for all strangers and outsiders -\r\nvisitors, tourists, and those fresh-caught for the service of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious return, and when the bachelors gave the\r\nChristmas Ball, William was, unofficially, you might say, the\r\nchief and honoured guest among the Stewards, who could make\r\nthings very pleasant for their friends. She and Scott danced\r\nnearly all the dances together, and sat out the rest in the big\r\ndark gallery overlooking the superb teak floor, where the\r\nuniforms blazed, and the spurs clinked, and the new frocks and\r\nfour hundred dancers went round and round till the draped flags\r\non the pillars flapped and bellied to the whirl of it.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight half a dozen men who did not care for dancing came\r\nover from the Club to play \"Waits,\" and that was a surprise the\r\nStewards had arranged - before any one knew what had happened,\r\nthe band stopped, and hidden voices broke into \"Good King\r\nWenceslaus,\" and William in the gallery hummed and beat time with\r\nher foot:\r\n\r\n\"Mark my footsteps well, my page,\r\nTread thou in them boldly.\r\nThou shalt feel the winter's rage\r\nFreeze thy blood less coldly!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I hope they are going to give us another! Isn't it pretty,\r\ncoming out of the dark in that way?  Look - look down. There's\r\nMrs. Gregory wiping her eyes!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's like Home, rather,\" said Scott. \"I remember -\"\r\n\r\n\"Hsh! Listen! - dear.\" And it began again:\r\n\r\n\"When shepherds watched their flocks by night -\"\r\n\r\n\"A-h-h!\" said William, drawing closer to Scott.\r\n\r\n\"All seated on the ground,\r\nThe Angel of the Lord came down,\r\nAnd glory shone around.\r\n'Fear not,' said he (for mighty dread\r\nHad seized their troubled mind);\r\n'Glad tidings of great joy I bring\r\nTo you and all mankind.'\"\r\n\r\nThis time it was William that wiped her eyes.\r\n\r\nEnd of WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR - PART II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SON OF HIS FATHER\r\n\r\n\"It is a queer name,\" Mrs. Strickland admitted, \"and none of our\r\nfamily have ever borne it, but, you see, he is the first man to\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nSo he was called Adam, and to that world about him he was the\r\nfirst of men - a man-child alone. Heaven sent him no Eve for a\r\ncompanion, but all earth, horse and foot, was at his feet. As\r\nsoon as he was old enough to appear in public,  he held a levee;\r\nand Strickland's sixty policemen, with their sixty  clanking\r\nsabres, bowed to the dust before him. When his fingers closed a\r\nlittle on Imam Din's sword-hilt, they rose and roared - till Adam\r\nroared, too, and was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\"Now, that was no cry of fear,\" said Imam Din, afterwards,\r\nspeaking to his companions in the Police Lines.  \"He was angry -\r\nand so young! Brothers, he will make a very strong Police\r\nofficer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does the Memsahib give him the breast?\" said a new Phillour\r\nrecruit, the dye smell not yet out of his yellow cotton uniform.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" said an up-country Naik, scornfully. \"It has not been known\r\nfor more than ten days that my woman suckles him.\" He curled his\r\nmoustaches as lordly as ever an Inspector could afford to do, for\r\nhe knew that the husband of the  foster-mother of the son of the\r\nDistrict Superintendent of Police was a man sure of\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad,\" said Imam Din, loosening his belt. \"Those who drink\r\nour blood become of our own blood, and I have seen, in these\r\nthirty years, that the sons of the Sahibs, once being born here,\r\nreturn when they are men. Yes, they return after they have been\r\nto Belait [Europe].\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do they do in Belait?\" asked the recruit, respectfully.\r\n\r\n\"Get instruction - which thou hast not,\" returned the Naik. \"Also\r\nthey drink of belaitee-panee [soda-water], enough to give them\r\nthat devil's restlessness which endures for all their lives.\r\nWhence we of Hind have trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father's uncle,\" said Imam Din, slowly, with importance, \"was\r\nRessaldar of the Longcoat Horse; and the Empress called him to\r\nBelait in the year that she had accomplished fifty years of\r\nrule. He said (and there were also other witnesses) that the\r\nSahibs there drink common water, even as do we; and that the\r\nbelaitee-panee does not run in all the rivers.\r\n\r\n\"He said also that there was a Shish Mahal - half a glass palace\r\n- half a koss in length and that the rail-gbarri ran under the\r\nroads, and that there are boats bigger than a village. He is a\r\ngreat talker.\" The Naik spoke scornfully. He had no well-born\r\nuncles.\r\n\r\n\"He is a man of good birth,\" said Imam Din, with the least\r\npossible emphasis on the first word, and the Naik was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho!\" Imam Din reached out to his pipe, chuckling until his\r\nfat sides shook again. \"Strickland Sahib's foster-mother was the\r\nwife of an Arain in the Ferozepur district. I was a young man\r\nthen, ploughing while the English fought. This child will also be\r\nsuckled here, and he will have double wisdom, and when he is a\r\nPolice officer it will be very bad for the thieves in this\r\nillakha.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be no English in the land then. They are asking\r\npermission of clerks and low-caste men to continue their rule\r\neven now,\" said the Naik.\r\n\r\n\"All but foolish men - such as those clerks are - would know that\r\nthis asking is but an excuse for making trouble, and thus\r\nholding the country more strictly. Now, in an investigation, is\r\nit not our custom to permit the villagers to talk loosely and\r\ngive us abuse for a little time? Then do we not grow hot, and\r\nwalk them to the thana two by two - as these clerks will be\r\nwalked? Thus do I read the new talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do not I,\" said the Naik, who borrowed the native\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n\"Because thou art young, and wast born in time of peace. I saw\r\nthe year that was to end the English rule. Men said it was\r\nended, indeed, and that all could now take their neighbour's\r\ncattle. This I saw ploughing, and I was minded to fight too,\r\nbeing a young man. My father sent me to Gurgaon to buy cattle,\r\nand I saw the tents of Van Corlin Sahib(1) in the wheat, and I\r\nsaw that he was going up and down collecting the revenue,\r\nneither abating nor increasing it, though Delhi was all afire,\r\nand the Sahibs lay dead about the fields. I have seen what I have\r\nseen. This Raj will not be talked down; and he who builds on the\r\npresent madness of the Sahib-log, which, O Naik, covers great\r\ncunning, builds for himself a lock-up. My father's uncle has seen\r\ntheir country, and he says that he is afraid as never he feared\r\nbefore. So Strickland Sahib's boy will come back to this country,\r\nand his son after him. Naik, have they named him yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"The butler spoke to my household, having heard the talk at\r\ntable, and he says that they will call him Adam, and no\r\njaw-splitting English name. Ud-daam.  The padre will name him at\r\ntheir church in due time.\"(1) Van Cortland?\r\n\r\n\"Who can tell the ways of Sahibs? Now, Strickland Sahib knows\r\nmore of the Faith than ever I had time to learn-prayers, charms,\r\nnames, and stories of the Blessed Ones. Yet he is not a\r\nMusalman,\" said Imam Din, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"For the reason that he knows as much of the gods of Hindustan,\r\nand so rides with a rein in each hand.  Remember that he sat\r\nunder the Baba Atall, a fakir among fakirs, for ten days:\r\nwhereby a man came to be hanged for the murder of the\r\ndancing-girl on the night of the great earthquake,\" said the\r\nNaik.\r\n\r\n\"True - it is true - and yet . . . they are one day so wise, the\r\nSahibs, and another so foolish. But he has named the child well:\r\nAdam. Huzrut Adam! Ho! ho! Father Adam we must call him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And all who minister to the child,\" said the Naik, quietly, but\r\nwith meaning, \"will come to great honour.\"\r\n\r\nAdam throve, being prayed over before the gods of at least three\r\ncreeds, in a garden almost as fair as Eden. There were gigantic\r\nclumps of bamboo that talked continually, and enormous plantains\r\non whose soft paper skin he could scratch with his nails; green\r\ndomes of mango-trees as huge as the dome of St. Paul's, full of\r\nparrots as big as cassowaries, and grey squirrels the size of\r\nfoxes. At the end of the garden stood a hedge of flaming\r\npoinsettias higher than any-thing in the world, because,\r\nchildlike, Adam's eye could not carry to the tops of the\r\nmango-trees.  Their green went out against the blue sky, but the\r\nred poinsettias he could just see.  A nurse who talked\r\ncontinually about snakes and pulled him back from the mouth of a\r\nfascinating dry well, and a mother who believed that the sun hurt\r\nlittle heads, were the only drawbacks to this loveliness. But, as\r\nhis legs grew under him, he found that by scaling an enormous\r\nrampart -three feet of broken-down mud wall at the end of the\r\ngarden - he could come into a ready-made kingdom where every one\r\nwas his slave.  Imam Din showed him the way one evening, and the\r\npolice troopers cooking their supper received him with rapture,\r\nand gave him pieces of very indigestible but altogether\r\ndelightful spiced bread.\r\n\r\nHere he sat or sprawled in the horse-feed where the police horses\r\nwere picketed in a double line, and he named them, men and\r\nbeasts together, according to his ideas and experiences, as his\r\nFirst Father had done before him. In those days everything had a\r\nname, from the mud mangers to the heel-ropes; for things were\r\npeople to Adam, exactly as people are things to folk in their\r\nsecond childhood. Through all the conferences - one hand twisted\r\ninto Imam Din's beard, and the other on his polished belt-buckle\r\n- there were two other people who came and went across the talk -\r\nDeath and Sickness - persons stronger than Imam Din, and stronger\r\nthan the heel-roped stallions.  There was Mata, the small-pox, a\r\nwoman in some way connected with pigs; and Heza, the cholera, a\r\nblack man, according to Adam; and Booka, starvation; and Kismet,\r\nwho quietly settled all questions, from the choking of a pet\r\nmungoose in the kitchen drain, to the absence of a young\r\npoliceman who once missed a parade and never came back.  It was\r\nall very wonderful to Adam, but not worth much thinking over; for\r\na child's mind is bounded by his eyes exactly as a horse's view\r\nof the road is limited by blinkers. Between all these\r\nobjectionable shadowy vagrants stood a ring of kind faces and\r\nstrong arms, and Mata and Heza would never touch Adam, the first\r\nof men. Kismet might do so, because - and this was a mystery no\r\nstaring into the looking-glass would solve - Kismet, who was a\r\nman, was also written, like  police orders for the day, in or on\r\nAdam's head.  Imam Din could not explain how this might be, and\r\nit was from that grey fat Muhammadan that Adam learned through\r\nevery inflection the Khuda janta (God knows) that settled\r\neverything in his mind.\r\n\r\nBeyond the fact that \"Khuda\" was a very good man and kept lions,\r\nAdam's theology did not run far. Mrs. Strickland tried to teach\r\nhim a few facts, but he revolted at the story of Genesis as\r\nuntrue. A turtle, he said, upheld the world, and one-half the\r\nadventures of Huzrut Nu (Father Noah) had never been told. If\r\nMamma wanted to hear them, she must ask Imam Din. Adam had heard\r\nof a saint who had made wooden cakes and pressed them to his\r\nstomach when he felt hungry, and the Feeding of the Multitude did\r\nnot impress him. So it came about that a reading of miracle\r\nstories generally ended in a monologue by Adam on other and much\r\nmore astonishing miracles.\r\n\r\n\"It's awful,\" said Mrs. Strickland, half crying, \"to think of his\r\ngrowing up like a little heathen.\" Mrs. Strickland (Miss Youghal\r\nthat was, if you remember her) had been born and brought up in\r\nEngland, and did not quite understand things.\r\n\r\n\"Let him alone,\" said Strickland; \"he'll grow out of it all, or\r\nit will only come back to him in dreams.\"\"Are you sure?\" said\r\nhis wife, to whom Strickland's least word was pure truth.\r\n\r\n\"Quite.  I was sent home when I was seven, and they flicked it\r\nout of me with a wet towel at Harrow.  Public schools don't\r\nencourage any-thing that isn't quite English.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Strickland shuddered, for she had been trying not to think\r\nof the separation that follows motherhood in India, and makes\r\nlife there, for all that is written to the contrary, not quite\r\nthe most desirable thing in the world. Adam trotted out to hear\r\nabout more miracles, and his nurse must have worried him beyond\r\nbounds, for she came back weeping, saying that Adam Baba was in\r\ndanger of being eaten alive by wild horses.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, he had shaken off Juma by bolting between a\r\ncouple of picketed horses and lying down under their bellies.\r\nThat they were personal friends of his, Juma did not understand,\r\nnor Strickland either. Adam was settled at ease when his father\r\narrived, breathless and white, and the stallions put back their\r\nears and squealed.\r\n\r\n\"If you come here,\" said Adam, \"they will hit you kicks. Tell\r\nJuma I have eaten my rice and wish to be alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come out at once,\" said Strickland, for the horses were\r\nbeginning to  paw violently.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I obey Juma's order? She is afraid of horses.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not Juma's order. It is mine. Obey!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" said Adam, \"Juma did not tell me that.\" And he crawled out\r\non all fours among the shod feet. Mrs. Strickland was crying\r\nbitterly with fear and excitement, and as a sacrifice to the\r\nhome gods Adam had to be whipped. He said with perfect justice:\r\n\"There was no order that I should not sit with the horses, and\r\nthey are my horses. Why is there this tamasha?\"\r\n\r\nStrickland's face showed him that the whipping was coming, and\r\nthe child turned white. Mother-like, Mrs. Strickland left the\r\nroom, but Juma, the foster-mother, stayed to see.\r\n\r\n\"Am I to be whipped here?\" he gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before that woman? Father, I am a man -I am not afraid. It is my\r\nizzat  - my honour.\"\r\n\r\nStrickland only laughed (to this day I cannot imagine what\r\npossessed him), and gave Adam the little tap-tap with a\r\nriding-cane that was whipping sufficient  for his years.\r\n\r\nWhen it was all over, Adam said quietly: \"I am little, and you\r\nare big. If I stayed among my horse folk I should not have been\r\nwhipped. You are afraid to go there.\"\r\n\r\nThe merest chance led me to Strickland's house that afternoon.\r\nWhen I was half-way down the drive Adam passed me, without\r\nrecognition, at a fast run. I caught one glimpse of his face\r\nunder his big hat, and it was the face of his father as I had\r\nonce seen that in the grey of morning when it bent above a\r\nleper. I caught the child by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Let me go!\" he screamed, and he and I were the best of friends,\r\nas a rule.  \"Let me go!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where to, Father Adam?\" He was quivering like a new-haltered\r\ncolt.\r\n\r\n\"To the well. I have been beaten. I have been beaten before\r\nwomen! Let me go!\" He tried to bite my hand.\r\n\r\n\"That is a small matter,\" I said. \"Men are horn to beatings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou hast never been beaten,\" he said savagely.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I have. Times past counting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before women?\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother and the ayah saw. By women too, for that matter. What\r\nof it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What didst thou do?\" He stared beyond my shoulder up the long\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\n\"It is long ago, and I have forgotten. I was older than thou art;\r\nbut even then I forgot, and now the thing is but a jest to be\r\ntalked of\"\r\n\r\nAdam drew one big breath and broke down utterly in my arms. Then\r\nhe raised his head, and his eyes were Strickland's eyes when\r\nStrickland gave orders.\r\n\r\n\"Ho! Imam Din.\"\r\n\r\nThe fat orderly seemed to spring out of the earth at our feet,\r\ncrashing through the bushes, and standing to attention.\r\n\r\n\"Hast thou ever been beaten?\" said Adam.\"Assuredly. By my father\r\nwhen I was thirty years old. He beat me with a plough-beam before\r\nall the women of the village.\"\"Wherefore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I had returned to the village on leave from the\r\nGovernment service, and had said of the village elders that they\r\nhad not seen the world. Therefore he beat me, to show that no\r\nseeing of the world changed father and son.\"\r\n\r\n\"And thou?\"\r\n\r\n\"I stood up. He was my father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Adam, and turned on his heel without another word.\r\n\r\nImam Din looked after him. \"An elephant breeds but once in a\r\nlifetime, but he breeds elephants. Yet I am glad I am no father\r\nof tuskers,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"What is it all?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"His father beat him with a whip no bigger than a reed. But the\r\nchild could not have done what he desired to do without leaping\r\nthrough me. And I am of some few pounds weight. Look!\"\r\n\r\nImam Din stepped back through the bushes, and the pressed grass\r\nshowed that he had been lying curled round the mouth of the dry\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\"When there was talk of beating I knew that one who sat among\r\nhorses, such as ours, was not like to kiss his father's hand. So\r\nI lay down in this place.\" We both stood still looking at the\r\nwell-curb.\r\n\r\nAdam came back along the garden path to us. \"I have spoken to my\r\nfather,\" he said simply. \"Imam Din, tell thy Naik that his woman\r\nis dismissed my service.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huzoor!\" said Imam Din, stooping low.\r\n\r\n\"For no fault of hers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Protector of the Poor!\"\r\n\r\nAnd to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Khodawund!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an order! Go!\"\r\n\r\nAgain the salute, and Imam Din departed, with that same set of\r\nthe back which he wore when he had taken an order from\r\nStrickland. I thought that it would be well to go too, but\r\nStrickland beckoned me from the verandah. When I came up he was\r\nperfectly white, and rocking to and fro in his chair, repeated\r\n\"Good God!\" half a dozen times.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that he was going to chuck himself down the well -\r\nbecause I tapped him just now ~\" he said helplessly.\r\n\r\n\"I ought to,\" I replied. \"He has just dismissed his nurse - on\r\nhis own authority, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"He told me just now that he wouldn't have her for a nurse any\r\nmore. I never supposed he meant it for an instant. I suppose\r\nshe'll have to go.\"\r\n\r\nIt is written elsewhere that Strickland was feared through the\r\nlength and breadth of the Punjab by murderers, horse-thieves,\r\nand cattle-lifters.\r\n\r\nAdam returned, halting outside the verandah, very white about the\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\"I have sent away Juma because she saw that - that which\r\nhappened. Until she is gone I do not come in the house,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBut to send away thy foster-mother ~\" said Strickland, with\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n\"I do not send her away.  It is thy blame, and the small\r\nforefinger was pointed to Strickland. \"I will not obey her; I\r\nwill not eat from her hand, and I will not sleep with her. Send\r\nher away.\"\r\n\r\nStrickland stepped out and lifted the child into the verandah.\r\n\r\n\"This folly has lasted long enough,\" he said. \"Come, now, and be\r\nwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am little, and you are big,\" said Adam, between set teeth.\r\n\"You can beat me before this man or cut me to pieces. But I will\r\nnot have Juma for my ayah any more. I will not eat till she goes.\r\nI swear it by - my father's head.\"\r\n\r\nStrickland sent him indoors to his mother, and we could hear\r\nsounds of weeping, and Adam's voice saying nothing more than,\r\n\"Send Juma away.\" Presently Juma came in and wept too, and Adam\r\nrepeated, \"It is no fault of thine, but go!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the end of it was that Juma went, with all her belongings,\r\nand Adam fought his own way alone into his little clothes until\r\na new ayah came. His address of welcome to her was rather\r\namazing. In a few words it ran: \"If I do wrong send me to my\r\nfather. If you strike me I will try to kill you. I do not wish my\r\nayah to play with me. Go and eat rice.\"\r\n\r\n>From that day Adam forswore the society of ayahs and small\r\nnative girls as much as a small boy can, confining himself to\r\nImam Din and his friends of the police. The Naik, Juma's\r\nhusband, had been presuming not a little on his position, and\r\nwhen Adam's favour was withdrawn from his wife he judged it best\r\nto apply for a transfer to another post. There were too many\r\ncompanions anxious to report his shortcomings to Strickland.\r\n\r\nTowards his father Adam kept a guarded neutrality. There was not\r\na touch of sulkiness in it, for the child's temper was as clear\r\nas a bell. But the difference and the politeness worried\r\nStrickland.\r\n\r\nIf the other men had loved Adam before the affair of the well,\r\nthey  worshipped him now.\r\n\r\nHe knows what honour means,\" said Imam Din; \"he has justified\r\nhimself upon a point thereof.  He has carried an order through\r\nhis father's household as a child of the blood might do.\r\nTherefore he is not altogether a child any longer.  Wah! He is a\r\ntiger's cub.\"  The next time that Adam made his little\r\nunofficial inspection of the line, Imam Din, and by consequence\r\nall the others, stood upon their feet, with their hands to their\r\nsides, instead of calling out from where they lay, \"Salaam,\r\nBabajee,\" and other disrespectful things.\r\n\r\nBut Strickland took long counsel with his wife, and she with the\r\ncheque-book and their lean bank-account, and they decided that\r\nAdam must go \"home\" to his aunts. But England is not home to a\r\nchild that has been born in India, and it never becomes\r\nhome-like unless he spends all his youth there. The bank-book\r\nshowed that if they economised through the summer by going to a\r\ncheap hill-station instead of to Simla, where Mrs. Strickland's\r\nparents lived, and where Strickland might be noticed by the\r\npowers, they could send Adam home in the next spring. It would be\r\nhard pinching, but it could be done.  In India all the money that\r\npeople in other lands save against a rainy day runs off in loss\r\nby exchange, which to-day cuts a man's income down almost exactly\r\nto one-half There is nothing to show for money when all is put\r\nby, and that is what makes married life there so hard. Strickland\r\nused to say, sometimes, that he envied the convicts in the jail.\r\nThey had no position to keep up, and the ball and chain that the\r\nworst of them wore was only a few pounds weight of iron.\r\n\r\nDalhousie was chosen as being the cheapest of the hill-stations;\r\nDalhousie and a little five-roomed cottage full of mildew,\r\ntucked away among the rhododendrons.\r\n\r\nAdam had been to Simla three or four times, and knew by name the\r\nmost of the Tonga drivers from Kalka to Tara Deva; but this new\r\nplan disquieted him. He came to me for information, his hands\r\ndeep in his knickerbocker pockets, walking, step for step, as\r\nhis father walked.\r\n\r\n\"There will be none of my bhai-bund [Brotherhood] up there,\" said\r\nhe, disconsolately, \"and they say that I must lie still in a\r\ndoolie for a day and a night, being carried like a sheep. I wish\r\nto take some of my mounted men to Dalhousie.\"\r\n\r\nI told him that there was a small boy called Victor, at\r\nDalhousie, who had a calf for a pet, and was allowed to play\r\nwith it on the public roads. After that Adam could not\r\nsufficiently hurry the packing.\r\n\r\n\"First,\" said he, \"I shall ask that man Victor to let me play\r\nwith the cow's child. If he is mug-gra [ill-conditioned] I shall\r\ntell my policemen  to take it away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is unjust,\" said Strickland, \"and there is no order\r\nthat the police should do injustice.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the Government pay is not sufficient, and low-caste men are\r\npromoted, what can an honest man do?\" he replied, in the very\r\ntouch and accent of Imam Din, and Strickland's eyebrows went up.\r\n\r\n\"You talk too much to the police, my son,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Always, about everything,\"  said Adam, promptly. \"They say that\r\nwhen I am an officer I shall know as much as my father.\" \"God\r\nforbid, little one!\"\r\n\r\n\"They say, too, that you are as clever as Shaitan to know\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\n\"They say that, do they?\" said Strickland, looking pleased. His\r\npay was small, but he had his reputation, and that was dear to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"They say also - not to me, but to one another when they eat rice\r\nbehind the wall - that in your own heart you esteem yourself as\r\nwise as Suleiman, who was cheated by Shaitan.\"\r\n\r\nThis time Strickland did not look so pleased. Adam, in all\r\ninnocence, launched into a long story about Suleiman-bin-Daoud,\r\nwho once, out of vanity, pitted his wits against Shaitan, and\r\nbecause God was not on his side Shaitan sent \"a little devil of\r\nlow caste,\" as Adam put it, who cheated him utterly, and put him\r\nto shame before \"all the other Rajas.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" said Strickland, when the tale was done, and went\r\naway, while Adam took me to task for laughing at Imam Din's\r\nstory. I did not wonder that he was called Huzrut Adam, for he\r\nlooked old as all time in his grave childhood, sitting\r\ncross-legged, his battered little helmet far at the back of his\r\nhead, his forefinger wagging up and down, native fashion, and\r\nthe wisdom of serpents on his unconscious lips.\r\n\r\nThat May he went up to Dalhousie with his mother, and in those\r\ndays the journey ended in fifty or sixty miles of uphill travel\r\nin a doolie or palanquin, along a road winding through the\r\nHimalayas. Adam sat in the doolie with his mother,and Strickland\r\nrode and tied with me, a spare doolie following. The march began\r\nafter we got out of the train at Pathankot, in a hot night among\r\nthe  rice - and poppy-fields.\r\n\r\nIt was all new to Adam, and he had opinions to advance - notably\r\nabout a fish that jumped on a wayside pond.\r\n\r\n\"Now I know,\" he shouted, \"how Khuda puts them there. First He\r\nmakes them and then He drops them down. That was a new one.\"\r\nThen, lifting his head to the stars, he cried, \"O God, do it\r\nagain, but slowly, that I, Adam, may see.\"\r\n\r\nBut nothing happened, and the doolie-bearers lit the noisome,\r\ndripping rag torches, and Adam's eyes shone big in the dancing\r\nlight, and we smelt the dry dust of the plains that we were\r\nleaving after eleven months' hard work.\r\n\r\nAt stated times the men ceased their drowsy, grunting tune, and\r\nsat down for a smoke. Between the guttering of their water-pipes\r\nwe could hear the cries of the beasts of the night, and the wind\r\nstirring in the folds of the mountain ahead. At the changing\r\nstations the voice of Adam, the first of men, would be lifted to\r\nrouse the sleepers in the huts till the fresh relays of bearers\r\nshambled from their cots, and the relief-pony with them.\r\n\r\nThen we would re-form and go on, and by the time the moon rose\r\nAdam was asleep, and there was no sound in the night except the\r\ngrunting of the men, the husky murmur of some river a thousand\r\nfeet down in the valley, and the squeaking of Strickland's\r\nsaddle. So we went up from the date-palm to deodar, till the dawn\r\nwind came round a corner all fresh from the snows, and we\r\nsnuffed it. I heard Strickland say: \"Wife, my overcoat, please,\"\r\nand Adam, fretfully: \"Where is Dalhousie, and the cow's child?\"\r\nand then I slept till Strickland turned me out of the warm doolie\r\nat seven o'clock, and I stepped into the splendour of a cool hill\r\nday, the plains sweltering twenty miles back and three thousand\r\nfeet below.\r\n\r\nAdam waked too, and needs must ride in front of me to ask a\r\nmillion questions, and shout at the monkeys, and clap his hands\r\nwhen the painted pheasants bolted across our road, and hail\r\nevery wood-cutter and drover and pilgrim within sight, till we\r\nhalted for breakfast at a staging-house. After breakfast, being a\r\nchild, he went out to play with a train of bullock-drivers\r\nhaltered by the road-side, and we had to chase him out of a\r\nnative liquor-shop where he was bargaining with a naked\r\nseven-year-old for a mynah in a bamboo cage.\r\n\r\nSaid he, wriggling on my pommel, as we went on again: \"There were\r\nfour men behosh [insensible] at the back of that house.\r\nWherefore do men grow  behosh from drinking?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the nature of the water,\" l said, and calling back:\r\n\"Strick, what's that grog-shop doing so close to the road? It's\r\na temptation to any one's servants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dun'no,\" said a sleepy voice in the doolie. \"This is Kennedy's\r\ndistrict. 'Twasn't here in my time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly the water smells bad,\" Adam went on. \"I smelt it, but I\r\ndid not get the mynah even for six annas. The woman of the house\r\ngave me a love-gift, that I found, playing near the verandah.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was the gift, Father Adam?\"\r\n\r\n\"A nose-ring for my ayah. Ohe! ohe!  Look at that camel with a\r\nbag on his nose.\" A string of loaded camels came cruising round\r\nthe corner, as a fleet rounds a cape.\r\n\r\n\"Ho, Malik! why does not a camel salaam like an elephant? His\r\nneck is long enough,\" Adam cried.\r\n\r\n\"The Angel Jibrail made him a fool from the beginning,\" said the\r\ndriver, as he swayed on the top of the led beast, and laughter\r\nran all along the line of red-bearded men.\r\n\r\n\"That   is true,\" said Adam, and they laughed again.\r\n\r\nAt last, in the late afternoon, we came to Dalhousie, loveliest\r\nof the hill-stations, and separated.Adam hardly could be\r\nrestrained from setting out at once to find Victor and the\r\n\"cow's child.\" I found them both, something to my trouble, next\r\nmorning. The two young sinners had a calf on a taut line just at\r\na sharp turn in the Mall, and were pretending that he was a\r\nRaja's elephant who had gone mad. But it was my horse that\r\nnearly went mad, and they shouted with delight. Then we began to\r\ntalk, and Adam, by way of crushing Victor's repeated reminders\r\nthat he and not \"that other\" was the owner of the calf, said:\r\n\"It is true I have no cow's child, but a great dacoity has been\r\ndone on my father.\"\r\n\r\n\"We came up together yesterday. There could have been nothing,\" I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"It was my mother's horse.  She has been dacoited with beating\r\nand blows, and now it is so thin.\"  He held his hands an inch\r\napart.  \"My father is at the tar-house sending tars. Imam Din\r\nwill cut off all their heads.  I desire your saddle-cloth for a\r\nhowdah to my elephant.  Give it me.\"\r\n\r\nThis was exciting, but not lucid. I went to the telegraph-office\r\nand found Strickland in a bad temper among many telegraph-forms.\r\nA dishevelled, one-eyed groom stood in a corner, whimpering at\r\nintervals.  He was a man whom Adam invariably addressed as\r\n\"Be-shakl be-ukl, be-ank\" - ugly, stupid, eyeless.  It seemed,\r\naccording to Strickland, that he had sent his wife's horse up to\r\nDalhousie by road, a fortnight's march.  This is the custom in\r\nUpper India. Among the foot-hills near Dhunnera or Dhar, horse\r\nand man had been violently set upon in the night by four men, who\r\nhad beaten the groom (his leg was bandaged from knee to ankle in\r\nproof), had incidentally beaten the horse, and had robbed the\r\ngroom of the bucket, and all his money  eleven rupees, nine\r\nannas, three pie.  Last, they had left him for dead by the\r\nwayside, where wood-cutters had found and nursed him.  Then the\r\none-eyed howled with anguish, thinking over his bruises.  \"They\r\nasked me if I was Strickland Sahib's servant, and I, thinking the\r\nprotection of the name would be sufficient, spoke the truth.\r\nThen they  beat me grievously.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hm!\" said Strickland.  \"I thought they wouldn't dacoit as a\r\nbusiness on the Dalhousie road.  This is meant for me personally\r\n- sheer badmashi [impudence].  All right.\"\r\n\r\nIn justice to a very hard-working class, it must be said that the\r\nthieves of Upper India have the keenest sense of humour. The\r\nlast compliment that they can pay a Police officer is to rob\r\nhim, and if, as once they did, they can loot a Deputy\r\nInspector-General of Police, on the eve of his retirement, of\r\neverything except the clothes on his back, their joy is\r\ncomplete.  They cause letters of derision and telegrams of\r\ncondolence to be sent to the victim; for of all men, thieves are\r\nmost compelled to keep up with modern progress.\r\n\r\nStrickland was a man of few words where his business was\r\nconcerned. I had never seen a Police officer robbed before, and\r\nI expected some excitement; but Strickland held his tongue. He\r\ntook the groom's deposition and retired into himself for a time,\r\nevolving thieves. Then he sent Kennedy, of the Pathankot charge,\r\nan official letter and an unofficial note.  Kennedy's reply was\r\npurely unofficial, and it ran thus: \"This seems a compliment\r\nsolely intended for you.  My wonder is, you didn't get it before.\r\n\r\nThe men are probably back in your district by this time.  The\r\nDhunnera and foot-hill people are highly respectable cultivators,\r\nand seeing my Assistant is an unlicked pup, and I can't trust my\r\nInspector out of my sight, I am not going to turn their harvest\r\nupside down with a police investigation. I am run off my feet\r\nwith vaccination police work.  You'd better look at home. The\r\nShubkudder Gang were through here a fortnight back.  They laid up\r\nat the Amritsar Serai, and then worked down.  No cases against\r\nthem in my charge, but remember you lagged their malik for\r\nreceiving in Prub Dyal's burglary.  They owe you one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly what I thought,\" said Strickland. \"I had a notion it was\r\nthe  Shubkudder Gang from the first.  We must make it pleasant\r\nfor them at Peshawur, and in my district too.  They are just the\r\nkind that would lie up under Imam Din's shadow.\"\r\n\r\n>From this point onward the wires began to he worked heavily.\r\nStrickland had a very fair knowledge of the Shubkudder Gang,\r\ngathered at first hand.\r\n\r\nThey were the same syndicate that had once stolen a Deputy\r\nCommissioner's cow, put horse-shoes on her, and taken her forty\r\nmiles into the jungle before they lost interest in the joke.\r\nThey added insult to insult by writing that the Deputy\r\nCommissioner's cows and horses were so much alike that it took\r\nthem two days to find out the difference, and they would not\r\nlift the like of such  cattle any more.\r\n\r\nThe District Superintendent at Peshawur replied to Strickland\r\nthat he was expecting the gang, and Strickland's Assistant in\r\nhis own district, being young and full of zeal, sent up the most\r\namazing clues.\r\n\r\n\"Now that's just what I want that young fool not to do,\" said\r\nStrickland. \"He hasn't passed the lower standard yet, and he's\r\nan English boy born and bred, and his father before him. He has\r\nabout as much tact as a bull, and he won't work quietly under my\r\nInspector.  I wish the Government would keep our service for\r\ncountry-born men. Those first five or six years give a man a\r\npull that lasts him his life. Adam, if you were only old enough\r\nto be my 'Stunt\"!\" He looked down at the little fellow on the\r\nverandah. Adam was deeply interested in the dacoity, and, unlike\r\na child, did not lose interest after the first week. On the\r\ncontrary, he would ask his father every evening what had been\r\ndone, and Strickland had drawn him a picture on the white wall of\r\nthe verandah showing the different towns in which policemen were\r\non the lookout for the thieves.  They were Amritsar, Jullundur,\r\nPhillour, Gurgaon, in case the gang were moving south; Rawal\r\nPindi and Peshawur, with Multan. Adam looked up at the picture\r\nas he answered:\r\n\r\n\"There has been great dikh [trouble] in this case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very great trouble. I wish thou wert a young man and my\r\nassistant to help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou need help, my father?\" Adam asked curiously, with his\r\nhead on one side.\r\n\r\n\"Very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave it all alone. It is bad. Let loose everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"That must not be. Those beginning a business continue to the\r\nend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou wilt continue to the end? Dost thou not know who did the\r\ndacoity?\"\r\n\r\nStrickland shook his head.  Adam turned to me with the same\r\nquestion, and I answered it in the same way.\r\n\r\n\"What foolish people!\" he said, and turned his back on us. He\r\nshowed plainly in all our dealings afterwards how we had fallen\r\nin his opinion.  Strickland told me that he would sit at the\r\ndoor of his work-room and stare at him for half an hour at a\r\ntime as he went through his papers. Strickland seemed to work\r\nharder over the case than if he had been in office on the\r\nplains.\r\n\r\n\"And sometimes I look up and I fancy the little chap's laughing\r\nat me. It's an awful thing to have a son. You see, he's your own\r\nand his own, and between the two you don't know quite how to\r\nhandle him,\" said Strickland. \"I wonder what in the world he\r\nthinks about?\"\r\n\r\nI asked Adam this on my own account. He put his head on one side\r\nfor a moment and replied: \"In these days I think about great\r\nthings; I do not play with Victor and the cow's child any more.\r\nHe is only a baba.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the third week of Strickland's leave the result of\r\nStrickland's labours - labours that had made Mrs. Strickland\r\nmore indignant against dacoits than any one else - came to hand.\r\nThe police at Peshawur reported that half the Shubkudder Gang\r\nwere held at Peshawur to account for the possession of some\r\nblankets and a horse-bucket. Strickland's Assistant had also\r\nfour men under suspicion in his charge; and Imam Din must have\r\nstirred up Strickland's Inspector to investigations on his own\r\naccount, for a string of incoherent telegrams came in from the\r\nClub Secretary, in which he entreated, exhorted, and commanded\r\nStrickland to take his \"mangy havildars\" off the club premises.\r\n\"Your men, in servants' quarters here, examining cook.  Marker\r\nindignant. Steward threatens resignation. Members furious.\r\nSaises stopped on roads. Shut up, or my resignation goes to\r\ncommittee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, I shouldn't in the least wonder,\" said Strickland,\r\nthoughtfully, to his wife, \"if the club was not just the place\r\nwhere a man would lie up. Bill Watson isn't at all pleased,\r\nthough.  I think I shall have to cut my leave by a week and go\r\ndown there. If there's anything to be told, the men will tell me.\r\nIt will never do for the gang to think they can dacoit my\r\nbelongings.\"\r\n\r\nThat was in the forenoon, and Strickland asked me to tiff in to\r\nleave me some instructions about his big dog, with authority to\r\nrebuke those who did not attend to her. Tietens was growing too\r\nold and too fat to live in the plains in summer. When I came,\r\nAdam had climbed into his high chair at the table, and Mrs.\r\nStrickland seemed ready to weep at any moment over the general\r\nmisery of things.\r\n\r\n\"I go down the hill to-morrow, little son,\" said Strickland.\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore?\" said Adam, reaching out for a ripe mango and burying\r\nhis head in it.\r\n\r\n\"Imam Din has caught the men who did the dacoity, and there are\r\nalso others at Peshawur under suspicion. I must go to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bus!\" said Adam, between the sucks at his mango, as Mrs.\r\nStrickland tucked the napkin round his neck.  \"It is enough.\r\nImam Din speaks lies. Do not go.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary. There has been great dikhdari\r\n(trouble-giving].\"\r\n\r\nAdam came out of the fruit for a minute and laughed.  Then,\r\nreturning, he spoke between slow and deliberate mouthfuls.\r\n\r\n\"The dacoits live in Beshakl's head.  They will never be caught.\r\nAll people know that. The cook knows, and the scullion, and\r\nRahim Baksh here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" said the butler behind his chair, hastily. \"What should I\r\nknow? Nothing at all does the servant of the Presence know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Accha,\" said Adam, and sucked on. \"Only it is known.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak, then,\" said Strickland. \"What dost thou know?  Remember\r\nthe sais was beaten insensible.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was in the bad-water shop where I played when we came here.\r\nThe boy who would not sell me the mynah for six annas told me\r\nthat a one-eyed man had come there and drunk the bad waters and\r\ngone mad. He broke bedsteads. They hit him with a bamboo till he\r\nfell senseless, and, fearing he was dead, they nursed him on\r\nmilk like a little baba. When I was playing first with the cow's\r\nchild I asked Beshakl if he were that man, and he said no. But I\r\nknew, because many wood-cutters asked him whether his head were\r\nwhole now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why,\" I interrupted, \"did Beshakl tell lies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! he is a low-caste man, and desired consideration. Now he is\r\na witness in a great law-case, and men will go to the jailkhana\r\non his account. It was to give trouble and obtain notice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it all lies?\" said Strickland,\r\n\r\n\"Ask him,\" said Adam, cheerily, through the mango-juice.\r\n\r\nStrickland passed through the door; there was a howl of despair\r\nin the servants' quarters up the hill, and he returned with the\r\none-eyed groom.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Strickland, \"it is known. Declare!\" \"Beshakl,\" said\r\nAdam, while the man gasped. \"Imam Din has caught four men, and\r\nthere are some more at Peshawur.  Bus! Bus! Bus! Tell about the\r\nmare and how she rolled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou didst get drunk by the wayside, and didst make a false case\r\n\r\nto cover it.  Speak!\"\r\n\r\nLike many other men, Strickland, in possession of a few facts,\r\nwas irresistible. The groom groaned.\r\n\r\n\"I - I did not get drunk - till - till - Protector of the Poor,\r\nthe mare rolled.\"\r\n\r\n\"All horses roll at Dhunnera.  The road is too narrow before\r\nthat, and they smell where the other horses have rolled.  This\r\nthe bullock-drivers told me when they came there,\" said Adam.\r\n\r\n\"She rolled. The saddle was cut, and the curb-chain was lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"See!\" said Adam, tugging a curb-chain from his pocket.  \"That\r\nwoman in  the shop gave it to me for a love-gift.  Beshakl said\r\nit was not his when I showed it.  But I knew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they in the grog-shop, knowing that I was the servant of\r\nthe Presence, said that unless I drank and spent money they\r\nwould tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lie.  A lie,\" said Strickland.  \"Son of an owl, speak truth\r\nnow at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I was afraid because I had lost the curb-chain, so I cut\r\nthe saddle  across and about.\"\r\n\r\n\"She did not roll, then?\" said Strickland, bewildered and very\r\nangry.\r\n\r\n\"It was the curb-chain that was lost.  That was the beginning of\r\nall.  I cut the saddle to look as though she had rolled, and\r\nwent to drink in the shop.  I drank, and there was a fray.  The\r\nrest I have forgotten, till I was recovered.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the mare the while?  What of the mare?\"\r\n\r\nThe man looked at Strickland, and collapsed. \"I will speak truth.\r\n\r\nShe bore fagots for a wood-cutter for a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, poor Diamond!\" said Mrs. Strickland.\r\n\r\n\"And Beshaki was paid four annas for her hire three days ago by\r\nthe  wood-cutter's brother, who is the left-hand man of the\r\njhampanis here,\" said Adam, in a loud and joyful voice. \"We all\r\nknew. We all knew. I and all the servants.\"\r\n\r\nStrickland was silent. His wife stared helplessly at the child -\r\nthe soul called out of the Nowhere, that went its own way alone.\r\n\r\n\"Did no man help thee with the lies?\" I asked of the groom.\r\n\r\n\"None, Protector of the Poor - not one.\"\r\n\r\n\"They grew, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"As a tale grows in the telling. Alas! I am a very bad man,\" and\r\nhe blinked his one eye dole-fully.\r\n\r\n\"Now four men are held at my station on thy account, and God\r\nknows how many more at Peshawur, besides the questions at\r\nMultan, and my izzat is lost, and the mare has been pack-pony to\r\na wood-cutter. Son of devils, what canst thou do to make\r\namends?\"\r\n\r\nThere was just a little break in Strickland's voice, and the man\r\ncaught it. Bending low, he answered in the abject, fawning whine\r\nthat confounds right and wrong more surely even than most modern\r\ncreeds, \"Protector of the Poor, is the police service shut to an\r\nhonest man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Out!\" cried Strickland, and swiftly as the groom departed he\r\nmust have heard our shout of laughter behind him.\r\n\r\n\"If you dismiss that man, Strick, I shall engage him. He's a\r\ngenius,\" I said. \"It will take you months to put this mess\r\nright, and Billy Watson won't give you a minute's peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"You aren't going to tell him?\" said Strickland, appealingly.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't keep this to myself if you were my own brother. Four\r\nmen  held in your district -four or forty at Peshawur - and what\r\nwas that you said about Multan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing.  Only some camel men there have been -\"\r\n\r\n\"On account of a curb-chain. Oh, my aunt!\"\r\n\r\n\"And whose memsahib was thy aunt?\" said Adam, with the mango\r\nstone in his fist. We began to laugh again.\r\n\r\n\"But here,\" said Strickland, pulling his face together, \"is a\r\nvery bad child who has caused his father to lose honour before\r\nall the policemen of the Punjab.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they know,\" said Adam.  \"It was only for the sake of show\r\nthat they caught the people. Assuredly they all knew it was\r\nbunao [make-up].\"\r\n\r\n\"And since when hast thou known?\" said the first policeman in\r\nIndia to his son.\r\n\r\n\"Four days after we came here - after the wood-cutter had asked\r\nBeshakl of the health of his head. Beshaki all but slew a\r\nwood-cutter at that bad-water place.\"\r\n\r\n\"If thou hadst spoken then, time and money and trouble to me and\r\nto others had all been spared.  Baba, thou hast done a wrong\r\ngreater than thy knowledge, and thou hast put me to shame, and\r\nset me out upon false words, and broken my honour. Thou hast\r\ndone very wrong. But perhaps thou didst not think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but I did think. Father, my honour was lost when that\r\nhappened that - that happened in Juma's presence. Now it is made\r\nwhole again.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, with the most enchanting smile in the world, Adam climbed on\r\n\r\nto his father's lap.\r\n\r\nEnd of \"THE SON OF HIS FATHER\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of \"THE DAY'S WORK\" - PART I",
