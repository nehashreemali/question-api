Rome. A street.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter Flavius, Marullus and a throng of Citizens.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nHence! home, you idle creatures, get you home.\r\nIs this a holiday? What, know you not,\r\nBeing mechanical, you ought not walk\r\nUpon a labouring day without the sign\r\nOf your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?\r\n\r\nCARPENTER.\r\nWhy, sir, a carpenter.\r\n\r\nMARULLUS.\r\nWhere is thy leather apron and thy rule?\r\nWhat dost thou with thy best apparel on?\r\nYou, sir, what trade are you?\r\n\r\nCOBBLER.\r\nTruly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a\r\ncobbler.\r\n\r\nMARULLUS.\r\nBut what trade art thou? Answer me directly.\r\n\r\nCOBBLER.\r\nA trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe conscience, which is\r\nindeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.\r\n\r\nMARULLUS.\r\nWhat trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade?\r\n\r\nCOBBLER.\r\nNay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet, if you be out, sir, I\r\ncan mend you.\r\n\r\nMARULLUS.\r\nWhat mean’st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow!\r\n\r\nCOBBLER.\r\nWhy, sir, cobble you.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nThou art a cobbler, art thou?\r\n\r\nCOBBLER.\r\nTruly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I meddle with no\r\ntradesman’s matters, nor women’s matters, but withal I am indeed, sir,\r\na surgeon to old shoes: when they are in great danger, I recover them.\r\nAs proper men as ever trod upon neat’s leather have gone upon my\r\nhandiwork.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nBut wherefore art not in thy shop today?\r\nWhy dost thou lead these men about the streets?\r\n\r\nCOBBLER.\r\nTruly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself into more work. But\r\nindeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar, and to rejoice in his\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nMARULLUS.\r\nWherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?\r\nWhat tributaries follow him to Rome,\r\nTo grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?\r\nYou blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!\r\nO you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,\r\nKnew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft\r\nHave you climb’d up to walls and battlements,\r\nTo towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,\r\nYour infants in your arms, and there have sat\r\nThe livelong day with patient expectation,\r\nTo see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.\r\nAnd when you saw his chariot but appear,\r\nHave you not made an universal shout,\r\nThat Tiber trembled underneath her banks\r\nTo hear the replication of your sounds\r\nMade in her concave shores?\r\nAnd do you now put on your best attire?\r\nAnd do you now cull out a holiday?\r\nAnd do you now strew flowers in his way,\r\nThat comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood?\r\nBe gone!\r\nRun to your houses, fall upon your knees,\r\nPray to the gods to intermit the plague\r\nThat needs must light on this ingratitude.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nGo, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault\r\nAssemble all the poor men of your sort,\r\nDraw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears\r\nInto the channel, till the lowest stream\r\nDo kiss the most exalted shores of all.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Citizens._]\r\n\r\nSee whether their basest metal be not mov’d;\r\nThey vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.\r\nGo you down that way towards the Capitol;\r\nThis way will I. Disrobe the images,\r\nIf you do find them deck’d with ceremonies.\r\n\r\nMARULLUS.\r\nMay we do so?\r\nYou know it is the feast of Lupercal.\r\n\r\nFLAVIUS.\r\nIt is no matter; let no images\r\nBe hung with Caesar’s trophies. I’ll about\r\nAnd drive away the vulgar from the streets;\r\nSo do you too, where you perceive them thick.\r\nThese growing feathers pluck’d from Caesar’s wing\r\nWill make him fly an ordinary pitch,\r\nWho else would soar above the view of men,\r\nAnd keep us all in servile fearfulness.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same. A public place.\r\n\r\nEnter, in procession, with music, Caesar; Antony, for the course;\r\nCalphurnia, Portia, Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius and Casca; a great\r\ncrowd following, among them a Soothsayer.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nCalphurnia.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nPeace, ho! Caesar speaks.\r\n\r\n[_Music ceases._]\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nCalphurnia.\r\n\r\nCALPHURNIA.\r\nHere, my lord.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nStand you directly in Antonius’ way,\r\nWhen he doth run his course. Antonius.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nCaesar, my lord?\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nForget not in your speed, Antonius,\r\nTo touch Calphurnia; for our elders say,\r\nThe barren, touched in this holy chase,\r\nShake off their sterile curse.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nI shall remember.\r\nWhen Caesar says “Do this,” it is perform’d.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nSet on; and leave no ceremony out.\r\n\r\n[_Music._]\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nCaesar!\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nHa! Who calls?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nBid every noise be still; peace yet again!\r\n\r\n[_Music ceases._]\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWho is it in the press that calls on me?\r\nI hear a tongue shriller than all the music,\r\nCry “Caesar”! Speak. Caesar is turn’d to hear.\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nBeware the Ides of March.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWhat man is that?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nA soothsayer bids you beware the Ides of March.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nSet him before me; let me see his face.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nFellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWhat say’st thou to me now? Speak once again.\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nBeware the Ides of March.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nHe is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.\r\n\r\n[_Sennet. Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius._]\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWill you go see the order of the course?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNot I.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI pray you, do.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI am not gamesome: I do lack some part\r\nOf that quick spirit that is in Antony.\r\nLet me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;\r\nI’ll leave you.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBrutus, I do observe you now of late:\r\nI have not from your eyes that gentleness\r\nAnd show of love as I was wont to have.\r\nYou bear too stubborn and too strange a hand\r\nOver your friend that loves you.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nCassius,\r\nBe not deceived: if I have veil’d my look,\r\nI turn the trouble of my countenance\r\nMerely upon myself. Vexed I am\r\nOf late with passions of some difference,\r\nConceptions only proper to myself,\r\nWhich give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;\r\nBut let not therefore my good friends be grieved\r\n(Among which number, Cassius, be you one)\r\nNor construe any further my neglect,\r\nThan that poor Brutus, with himself at war,\r\nForgets the shows of love to other men.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThen, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;\r\nBy means whereof this breast of mine hath buried\r\nThoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.\r\nTell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNo, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself\r\nBut by reflection, by some other thing.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\n’Tis just:\r\nAnd it is very much lamented, Brutus,\r\nThat you have no such mirrors as will turn\r\nYour hidden worthiness into your eye,\r\nThat you might see your shadow. I have heard\r\nWhere many of the best respect in Rome,\r\n(Except immortal Caesar) speaking of Brutus,\r\nAnd groaning underneath this age’s yoke,\r\nHave wish’d that noble Brutus had his eyes.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nInto what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,\r\nThat you would have me seek into myself\r\nFor that which is not in me?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nTherefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear;\r\nAnd since you know you cannot see yourself\r\nSo well as by reflection, I, your glass,\r\nWill modestly discover to yourself\r\nThat of yourself which you yet know not of.\r\nAnd be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:\r\nWere I a common laugher, or did use\r\nTo stale with ordinary oaths my love\r\nTo every new protester; if you know\r\nThat I do fawn on men, and hug them hard,\r\nAnd after scandal them; or if you know\r\nThat I profess myself in banqueting,\r\nTo all the rout, then hold me dangerous.\r\n\r\n[_Flourish and shout._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat means this shouting? I do fear the people\r\nChoose Caesar for their king.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAy, do you fear it?\r\nThen must I think you would not have it so.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI would not, Cassius; yet I love him well,\r\nBut wherefore do you hold me here so long?\r\nWhat is it that you would impart to me?\r\nIf it be aught toward the general good,\r\nSet honour in one eye and death i’ the other,\r\nAnd I will look on both indifferently;\r\nFor let the gods so speed me as I love\r\nThe name of honour more than I fear death.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,\r\nAs well as I do know your outward favour.\r\nWell, honour is the subject of my story.\r\nI cannot tell what you and other men\r\nThink of this life; but, for my single self,\r\nI had as lief not be as live to be\r\nIn awe of such a thing as I myself.\r\nI was born free as Caesar; so were you;\r\nWe both have fed as well, and we can both\r\nEndure the winter’s cold as well as he:\r\nFor once, upon a raw and gusty day,\r\nThe troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,\r\nCaesar said to me, “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now\r\nLeap in with me into this angry flood,\r\nAnd swim to yonder point?” Upon the word,\r\nAccoutred as I was, I plunged in,\r\nAnd bade him follow: so indeed he did.\r\nThe torrent roar’d, and we did buffet it\r\nWith lusty sinews, throwing it aside\r\nAnd stemming it with hearts of controversy.\r\nBut ere we could arrive the point propos’d,\r\nCaesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!”\r\nI, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,\r\nDid from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder\r\nThe old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber\r\nDid I the tired Caesar. And this man\r\nIs now become a god; and Cassius is\r\nA wretched creature, and must bend his body,\r\nIf Caesar carelessly but nod on him.\r\nHe had a fever when he was in Spain,\r\nAnd when the fit was on him I did mark\r\nHow he did shake: ’tis true, this god did shake:\r\nHis coward lips did from their colour fly,\r\nAnd that same eye whose bend doth awe the world\r\nDid lose his lustre. I did hear him groan:\r\nAy, and that tongue of his, that bade the Romans\r\nMark him, and write his speeches in their books,\r\nAlas, it cried, “Give me some drink, Titinius,”\r\nAs a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me,\r\nA man of such a feeble temper should\r\nSo get the start of the majestic world,\r\nAnd bear the palm alone.\r\n\r\n[_Shout. Flourish._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAnother general shout?\r\nI do believe that these applauses are\r\nFor some new honours that are heap’d on Caesar.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhy, man, he doth bestride the narrow world\r\nLike a Colossus, and we petty men\r\nWalk under his huge legs, and peep about\r\nTo find ourselves dishonourable graves.\r\nMen at some time are masters of their fates:\r\nThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,\r\nBut in ourselves, that we are underlings.\r\n“Brutus” and “Caesar”: what should be in that “Caesar”?\r\nWhy should that name be sounded more than yours?\r\nWrite them together, yours is as fair a name;\r\nSound them, it doth become the mouth as well;\r\nWeigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,\r\n“Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.”\r\nNow in the names of all the gods at once,\r\nUpon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,\r\nThat he is grown so great? Age, thou art sham’d!\r\nRome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!\r\nWhen went there by an age since the great flood,\r\nBut it was fam’d with more than with one man?\r\nWhen could they say, till now, that talk’d of Rome,\r\nThat her wide walls encompass’d but one man?\r\nNow is it Rome indeed, and room enough,\r\nWhen there is in it but one only man.\r\nO, you and I have heard our fathers say,\r\nThere was a Brutus once that would have brook’d\r\nTh’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome,\r\nAs easily as a king!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThat you do love me, I am nothing jealous;\r\nWhat you would work me to, I have some aim:\r\nHow I have thought of this, and of these times,\r\nI shall recount hereafter. For this present,\r\nI would not, so with love I might entreat you,\r\nBe any further mov’d. What you have said,\r\nI will consider; what you have to say\r\nI will with patience hear; and find a time\r\nBoth meet to hear and answer such high things.\r\nTill then, my noble friend, chew upon this:\r\nBrutus had rather be a villager\r\nThan to repute himself a son of Rome\r\nUnder these hard conditions as this time\r\nIs like to lay upon us.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI am glad that my weak words\r\nHave struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.\r\n\r\nEnter Caesar and his Train.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThe games are done, and Caesar is returning.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAs they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,\r\nAnd he will, after his sour fashion, tell you\r\nWhat hath proceeded worthy note today.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI will do so. But, look you, Cassius,\r\nThe angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow,\r\nAnd all the rest look like a chidden train:\r\nCalphurnia’s cheek is pale; and Cicero\r\nLooks with such ferret and such fiery eyes\r\nAs we have seen him in the Capitol,\r\nBeing cross’d in conference by some senators.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nCasca will tell us what the matter is.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nAntonius.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nCaesar?\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nLet me have men about me that are fat,\r\nSleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights:\r\nYond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;\r\nHe thinks too much: such men are dangerous.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nFear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous;\r\nHe is a noble Roman and well given.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWould he were fatter! But I fear him not:\r\nYet if my name were liable to fear,\r\nI do not know the man I should avoid\r\nSo soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,\r\nHe is a great observer, and he looks\r\nQuite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,\r\nAs thou dost, Antony; he hears no music.\r\nSeldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort\r\nAs if he mock’d himself and scorn’d his spirit\r\nThat could be mov’d to smile at anything.\r\nSuch men as he be never at heart’s ease\r\nWhiles they behold a greater than themselves,\r\nAnd therefore are they very dangerous.\r\nI rather tell thee what is to be fear’d\r\nThan what I fear; for always I am Caesar.\r\nCome on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,\r\nAnd tell me truly what thou think’st of him.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Caesar and his Train. Casca stays._]\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nYou pull’d me by the cloak; would you speak with me?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAy, Casca, tell us what hath chanc’d today,\r\nThat Caesar looks so sad.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nWhy, you were with him, were you not?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI should not then ask Casca what had chanc’d.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nWhy, there was a crown offer’d him; and being offer’d him, he put it by\r\nwith the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat was the second noise for?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nWhy, for that too.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThey shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nWhy, for that too.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWas the crown offer’d him thrice?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nAy, marry, was’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than\r\nother; and at every putting-by mine honest neighbours shouted.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWho offer’d him the crown?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nWhy, Antony.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nTell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nI can as well be hang’d, as tell the manner of it: it was mere foolery;\r\nI did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown; yet ’twas not a\r\ncrown neither, ’twas one of these coronets; and, as I told you, he put\r\nit by once: but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had\r\nit. Then he offered it to him again: then he put it by again: but, to\r\nmy thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he\r\noffered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still, as\r\nhe refus’d it, the rabblement hooted, and clapp’d their chopt hands,\r\nand threw up their sweaty night-caps, and uttered such a deal of\r\nstinking breath because Caesar refus’d the crown, that it had, almost,\r\nchoked Caesar, for he swooned, and fell down at it. And for mine own\r\npart, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips and receiving the\r\nbad air.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBut, soft! I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nHe fell down in the market-place, and foam’d at mouth, and was\r\nspeechless.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\n’Tis very like: he hath the falling-sickness.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nNo, Caesar hath it not; but you, and I,\r\nAnd honest Casca, we have the falling-sickness.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nI know not what you mean by that; but I am sure Caesar fell down. If\r\nthe tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he\r\npleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the\r\ntheatre, I am no true man.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat said he when he came unto himself?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nMarry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad\r\nhe refused the crown, he pluck’d me ope his doublet, and offer’d them\r\nhis throat to cut. And I had been a man of any occupation, if I would\r\nnot have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the\r\nrogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he\r\nhad done or said anything amiss, he desir’d their worships to think it\r\nwas his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried, “Alas,\r\ngood soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed\r\nto be taken of them: if Caesar had stabb’d their mothers, they would\r\nhave done no less.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAnd, after that, he came thus sad away?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nAy.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nDid Cicero say anything?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nAy, he spoke Greek.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nTo what effect?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nNay, and I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ the face again. But\r\nthose that understood him smil’d at one another and shook their heads;\r\nbut for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news\r\ntoo: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar’s images, are\r\nput to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could\r\nremember it.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWill you sup with me tonight, Casca?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nNo, I am promis’d forth.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWill you dine with me tomorrow?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nAy, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the\r\neating.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nGood. I will expect you.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nDo so; farewell both.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Casca._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat a blunt fellow is this grown to be!\r\nHe was quick mettle when he went to school.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nSo is he now in execution\r\nOf any bold or noble enterprise,\r\nHowever he puts on this tardy form.\r\nThis rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,\r\nWhich gives men stomach to digest his words\r\nWith better appetite.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAnd so it is. For this time I will leave you:\r\nTomorrow, if you please to speak with me,\r\nI will come home to you; or, if you will,\r\nCome home to me, and I will wait for you.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI will do so: till then, think of the world.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Brutus._]\r\n\r\nWell, Brutus, thou art noble; yet I see,\r\nThy honourable metal may be wrought\r\nFrom that it is dispos’d: therefore ’tis meet\r\nThat noble minds keep ever with their likes;\r\nFor who so firm that cannot be seduc’d?\r\nCaesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.\r\nIf I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,\r\nHe should not humour me. I will this night,\r\nIn several hands, in at his windows throw,\r\nAs if they came from several citizens,\r\nWritings, all tending to the great opinion\r\nThat Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely\r\nCaesar’s ambition shall be glanced at.\r\nAnd after this, let Caesar seat him sure,\r\nFor we will shake him, or worse days endure.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The same. A street.\r\n\r\nThunder and lightning. Enter, from opposite sides, Casca with his sword\r\ndrawn, and Cicero.\r\n\r\nCICERO.\r\nGood even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?\r\nWhy are you breathless, and why stare you so?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nAre not you moved, when all the sway of earth\r\nShakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,\r\nI have seen tempests, when the scolding winds\r\nHave riv’d the knotty oaks; and I have seen\r\nTh’ ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,\r\nTo be exalted with the threatening clouds:\r\nBut never till tonight, never till now,\r\nDid I go through a tempest dropping fire.\r\nEither there is a civil strife in heaven,\r\nOr else the world too saucy with the gods,\r\nIncenses them to send destruction.\r\n\r\nCICERO.\r\nWhy, saw you anything more wonderful?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nA common slave, you’d know him well by sight,\r\nHeld up his left hand, which did flame and burn\r\nLike twenty torches join’d, and yet his hand,\r\nNot sensible of fire remain’d unscorch’d.\r\nBesides, I ha’ not since put up my sword,\r\nAgainst the Capitol I met a lion,\r\nWho glared upon me, and went surly by,\r\nWithout annoying me. And there were drawn\r\nUpon a heap a hundred ghastly women,\r\nTransformed with their fear; who swore they saw\r\nMen, all in fire, walk up and down the streets.\r\nAnd yesterday the bird of night did sit,\r\nEven at noonday upon the marketplace,\r\nHooting and shrieking. When these prodigies\r\nDo so conjointly meet, let not men say,\r\n“These are their reasons; they are natural”;\r\nFor I believe, they are portentous things\r\nUnto the climate that they point upon.\r\n\r\nCICERO.\r\nIndeed, it is a strange-disposed time.\r\nBut men may construe things after their fashion,\r\nClean from the purpose of the things themselves.\r\nComes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nHe doth, for he did bid Antonius\r\nSend word to you he would be there tomorrow.\r\n\r\nCICERO.\r\nGoodnight then, Casca: this disturbed sky\r\nIs not to walk in.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nFarewell, Cicero.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Cicero._]\r\n\r\nEnter Cassius.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWho’s there?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nA Roman.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nCasca, by your voice.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nYour ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nA very pleasing night to honest men.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nWho ever knew the heavens menace so?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThose that have known the earth so full of faults.\r\nFor my part, I have walk’d about the streets,\r\nSubmitting me unto the perilous night;\r\nAnd, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,\r\nHave bar’d my bosom to the thunder-stone;\r\nAnd when the cross blue lightning seem’d to open\r\nThe breast of heaven, I did present myself\r\nEven in the aim and very flash of it.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nBut wherefore did you so much tempt the Heavens?\r\nIt is the part of men to fear and tremble,\r\nWhen the most mighty gods by tokens send\r\nSuch dreadful heralds to astonish us.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nYou are dull, Casca; and those sparks of life\r\nThat should be in a Roman you do want,\r\nOr else you use not. You look pale and gaze,\r\nAnd put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,\r\nTo see the strange impatience of the Heavens:\r\nBut if you would consider the true cause\r\nWhy all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,\r\nWhy birds and beasts, from quality and kind;\r\nWhy old men, fools, and children calculate,\r\nWhy all these things change from their ordinance,\r\nTheir natures, and pre-formed faculties,\r\nTo monstrous quality; why, you shall find\r\nThat Heaven hath infus’d them with these spirits,\r\nTo make them instruments of fear and warning\r\nUnto some monstrous state.\r\nNow could I, Casca, name to thee a man\r\nMost like this dreadful night,\r\nThat thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars,\r\nAs doth the lion in the Capitol;\r\nA man no mightier than thyself, or me,\r\nIn personal action; yet prodigious grown,\r\nAnd fearful, as these strange eruptions are.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\n’Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nLet it be who it is: for Romans now\r\nHave thews and limbs like to their ancestors;\r\nBut, woe the while! our fathers’ minds are dead,\r\nAnd we are govern’d with our mothers’ spirits;\r\nOur yoke and sufferance show us womanish.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nIndeed, they say the senators tomorrow\r\nMean to establish Caesar as a king;\r\nAnd he shall wear his crown by sea and land,\r\nIn every place, save here in Italy.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI know where I will wear this dagger then;\r\nCassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:\r\nTherein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;\r\nTherein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.\r\nNor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,\r\nNor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,\r\nCan be retentive to the strength of spirit;\r\nBut life, being weary of these worldly bars,\r\nNever lacks power to dismiss itself.\r\nIf I know this, know all the world besides,\r\nThat part of tyranny that I do bear\r\nI can shake off at pleasure.\r\n\r\n[_Thunder still._]\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nSo can I:\r\nSo every bondman in his own hand bears\r\nThe power to cancel his captivity.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAnd why should Caesar be a tyrant then?\r\nPoor man! I know he would not be a wolf,\r\nBut that he sees the Romans are but sheep:\r\nHe were no lion, were not Romans hinds.\r\nThose that with haste will make a mighty fire\r\nBegin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,\r\nWhat rubbish, and what offal, when it serves\r\nFor the base matter to illuminate\r\nSo vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,\r\nWhere hast thou led me? I, perhaps, speak this\r\nBefore a willing bondman: then I know\r\nMy answer must be made; but I am arm’d,\r\nAnd dangers are to me indifferent.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nYou speak to Casca, and to such a man\r\nThat is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:\r\nBe factious for redress of all these griefs,\r\nAnd I will set this foot of mine as far\r\nAs who goes farthest.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThere’s a bargain made.\r\nNow know you, Casca, I have mov’d already\r\nSome certain of the noblest-minded Romans\r\nTo undergo with me an enterprise\r\nOf honourable-dangerous consequence;\r\nAnd I do know by this, they stay for me\r\nIn Pompey’s Porch: for now, this fearful night,\r\nThere is no stir or walking in the streets;\r\nAnd the complexion of the element\r\nIn favour’s like the work we have in hand,\r\nMost bloody, fiery, and most terrible.\r\n\r\nEnter Cinna.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nStand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\n’Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;\r\nHe is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nTo find out you. Who’s that? Metellus Cimber?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nNo, it is Casca, one incorporate\r\nTo our attempts. Am I not stay’d for, Cinna?\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nI am glad on’t. What a fearful night is this!\r\nThere’s two or three of us have seen strange sights.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAm I not stay’d for? tell me.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nYes, you are. O Cassius, if you could\r\nBut win the noble Brutus to our party—\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBe you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,\r\nAnd look you lay it in the praetor’s chair,\r\nWhere Brutus may but find it; and throw this\r\nIn at his window; set this up with wax\r\nUpon old Brutus’ statue: all this done,\r\nRepair to Pompey’s Porch, where you shall find us.\r\nIs Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nAll but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone\r\nTo seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,\r\nAnd so bestow these papers as you bade me.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThat done, repair to Pompey’s theatre.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Cinna._]\r\n\r\nCome, Casca, you and I will yet, ere day,\r\nSee Brutus at his house: three parts of him\r\nIs ours already, and the man entire\r\nUpon the next encounter, yields him ours.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nO, he sits high in all the people’s hearts!\r\nAnd that which would appear offence in us,\r\nHis countenance, like richest alchemy,\r\nWill change to virtue and to worthiness.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHim, and his worth, and our great need of him,\r\nYou have right well conceited. Let us go,\r\nFor it is after midnight; and ere day,\r\nWe will awake him, and be sure of him.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT II\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Rome. Brutus’ orchard.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter Brutus.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat, Lucius, ho!\r\nI cannot, by the progress of the stars,\r\nGive guess how near to day.—Lucius, I say!\r\nI would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.\r\nWhen, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nCall’d you, my lord?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGet me a taper in my study, Lucius:\r\nWhen it is lighted, come and call me here.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nI will, my lord.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nIt must be by his death: and for my part,\r\nI know no personal cause to spurn at him,\r\nBut for the general. He would be crown’d:\r\nHow that might change his nature, there’s the question.\r\nIt is the bright day that brings forth the adder,\r\nAnd that craves wary walking. Crown him?—that;\r\nAnd then, I grant, we put a sting in him,\r\nThat at his will he may do danger with.\r\nTh’ abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins\r\nRemorse from power; and, to speak truth of Caesar,\r\nI have not known when his affections sway’d\r\nMore than his reason. But ’tis a common proof,\r\nThat lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,\r\nWhereto the climber-upward turns his face;\r\nBut when he once attains the upmost round,\r\nHe then unto the ladder turns his back,\r\nLooks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees\r\nBy which he did ascend. So Caesar may;\r\nThen lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel\r\nWill bear no colour for the thing he is,\r\nFashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,\r\nWould run to these and these extremities:\r\nAnd therefore think him as a serpent’s egg\r\nWhich hatch’d, would, as his kind grow mischievous;\r\nAnd kill him in the shell.\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nThe taper burneth in your closet, sir.\r\nSearching the window for a flint, I found\r\nThis paper, thus seal’d up, and I am sure\r\nIt did not lie there when I went to bed.\r\n\r\n[_Gives him the letter._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGet you to bed again; it is not day.\r\nIs not tomorrow, boy, the Ides of March?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nI know not, sir.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nLook in the calendar, and bring me word.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nI will, sir.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThe exhalations, whizzing in the air\r\nGive so much light that I may read by them.\r\n\r\n[_Opens the letter and reads._]\r\n\r\n_Brutus, thou sleep’st: awake and see thyself.\r\nShall Rome, &c. Speak, strike, redress!_\r\n“Brutus, thou sleep’st: awake!”\r\nSuch instigations have been often dropp’d\r\nWhere I have took them up.\r\n“Shall Rome, &c.” Thus must I piece it out:\r\nShall Rome stand under one man’s awe? What, Rome?\r\nMy ancestors did from the streets of Rome\r\nThe Tarquin drive, when he was call’d a king.\r\n“Speak, strike, redress!” Am I entreated\r\nTo speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,\r\nIf the redress will follow, thou receivest\r\nThy full petition at the hand of Brutus.\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nSir, March is wasted fifteen days.\r\n\r\n[_Knock within._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\n’Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Lucius._]\r\n\r\nSince Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,\r\nI have not slept.\r\nBetween the acting of a dreadful thing\r\nAnd the first motion, all the interim is\r\nLike a phantasma, or a hideous dream:\r\nThe genius and the mortal instruments\r\nAre then in council; and the state of man,\r\nLike to a little kingdom, suffers then\r\nThe nature of an insurrection.\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nSir, ’tis your brother Cassius at the door,\r\nWho doth desire to see you.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nIs he alone?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nNo, sir, there are moe with him.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nDo you know them?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nNo, sir, their hats are pluck’d about their ears,\r\nAnd half their faces buried in their cloaks,\r\nThat by no means I may discover them\r\nBy any mark of favour.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nLet ’em enter.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Lucius._]\r\n\r\nThey are the faction. O conspiracy,\r\nSham’st thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,\r\nWhen evils are most free? O, then, by day\r\nWhere wilt thou find a cavern dark enough\r\nTo mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;\r\nHide it in smiles and affability:\r\nFor if thou path, thy native semblance on,\r\nNot Erebus itself were dim enough\r\nTo hide thee from prevention.\r\n\r\nEnter Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus Cimber and Trebonius.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI think we are too bold upon your rest:\r\nGood morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI have been up this hour, awake all night.\r\nKnow I these men that come along with you?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nYes, every man of them; and no man here\r\nBut honours you; and everyone doth wish\r\nYou had but that opinion of yourself\r\nWhich every noble Roman bears of you.\r\nThis is Trebonius.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHe is welcome hither.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThis Decius Brutus.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHe is welcome too.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThis, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThey are all welcome.\r\nWhat watchful cares do interpose themselves\r\nBetwixt your eyes and night?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nShall I entreat a word?\r\n\r\n[_They whisper._]\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nHere lies the east: doth not the day break here?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nO, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon grey lines\r\nThat fret the clouds are messengers of day.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nYou shall confess that you are both deceiv’d.\r\nHere, as I point my sword, the Sun arises;\r\nWhich is a great way growing on the South,\r\nWeighing the youthful season of the year.\r\nSome two months hence, up higher toward the North\r\nHe first presents his fire; and the high East\r\nStands, as the Capitol, directly here.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGive me your hands all over, one by one.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAnd let us swear our resolution.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNo, not an oath. If not the face of men,\r\nThe sufferance of our souls, the time’s abuse—\r\nIf these be motives weak, break off betimes,\r\nAnd every man hence to his idle bed.\r\nSo let high-sighted tyranny range on,\r\nTill each man drop by lottery. But if these,\r\nAs I am sure they do, bear fire enough\r\nTo kindle cowards, and to steel with valour\r\nThe melting spirits of women; then, countrymen,\r\nWhat need we any spur but our own cause\r\nTo prick us to redress? what other bond\r\nThan secret Romans, that have spoke the word,\r\nAnd will not palter? and what other oath\r\nThan honesty to honesty engag’d,\r\nThat this shall be, or we will fall for it?\r\nSwear priests and cowards, and men cautelous,\r\nOld feeble carrions, and such suffering souls\r\nThat welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear\r\nSuch creatures as men doubt; but do not stain\r\nThe even virtue of our enterprise,\r\nNor th’ insuppressive mettle of our spirits,\r\nTo think that or our cause or our performance\r\nDid need an oath; when every drop of blood\r\nThat every Roman bears, and nobly bears,\r\nIs guilty of a several bastardy,\r\nIf he do break the smallest particle\r\nOf any promise that hath pass’d from him.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBut what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?\r\nI think he will stand very strong with us.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nLet us not leave him out.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nNo, by no means.\r\n\r\nMETELLUS.\r\nO, let us have him, for his silver hairs\r\nWill purchase us a good opinion,\r\nAnd buy men’s voices to commend our deeds.\r\nIt shall be said, his judgement rul’d our hands;\r\nOur youths and wildness shall no whit appear,\r\nBut all be buried in his gravity.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO, name him not; let us not break with him;\r\nFor he will never follow anything\r\nThat other men begin.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThen leave him out.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nIndeed, he is not fit.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nShall no man else be touch’d but only Caesar?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nDecius, well urg’d. I think it is not meet,\r\nMark Antony, so well belov’d of Caesar,\r\nShould outlive Caesar: we shall find of him\r\nA shrewd contriver; and you know, his means,\r\nIf he improve them, may well stretch so far\r\nAs to annoy us all; which to prevent,\r\nLet Antony and Caesar fall together.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nOur course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,\r\nTo cut the head off, and then hack the limbs,\r\nLike wrath in death, and envy afterwards;\r\nFor Antony is but a limb of Caesar.\r\nLet us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.\r\nWe all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,\r\nAnd in the spirit of men there is no blood.\r\nO, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit,\r\nAnd not dismember Caesar! But, alas,\r\nCaesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,\r\nLet’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;\r\nLet’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,\r\nNot hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.\r\nAnd let our hearts, as subtle masters do,\r\nStir up their servants to an act of rage,\r\nAnd after seem to chide ’em. This shall mark\r\nOur purpose necessary, and not envious;\r\nWhich so appearing to the common eyes,\r\nWe shall be call’d purgers, not murderers.\r\nAnd for Mark Antony, think not of him;\r\nFor he can do no more than Caesar’s arm\r\nWhen Caesar’s head is off.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nYet I fear him;\r\nFor in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar—\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAlas, good Cassius, do not think of him:\r\nIf he love Caesar, all that he can do\r\nIs to himself; take thought and die for Caesar.\r\nAnd that were much he should; for he is given\r\nTo sports, to wildness, and much company.\r\n\r\nTREBONIUS.\r\nThere is no fear in him; let him not die;\r\nFor he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.\r\n\r\n[_Clock strikes._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nPeace! count the clock.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThe clock hath stricken three.\r\n\r\nTREBONIUS.\r\n’Tis time to part.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBut it is doubtful yet\r\nWhether Caesar will come forth today or no;\r\nFor he is superstitious grown of late,\r\nQuite from the main opinion he held once\r\nOf fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.\r\nIt may be these apparent prodigies,\r\nThe unaccustom’d terror of this night,\r\nAnd the persuasion of his augurers,\r\nMay hold him from the Capitol today.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nNever fear that: if he be so resolved,\r\nI can o’ersway him, for he loves to hear\r\nThat unicorns may be betray’d with trees,\r\nAnd bears with glasses, elephants with holes,\r\nLions with toils, and men with flatterers.\r\nBut when I tell him he hates flatterers,\r\nHe says he does, being then most flattered.\r\nLet me work;\r\nFor I can give his humour the true bent,\r\nAnd I will bring him to the Capitol.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nNay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nBy the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nBe that the uttermost; and fail not then.\r\n\r\nMETELLUS.\r\nCaius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,\r\nWho rated him for speaking well of Pompey;\r\nI wonder none of you have thought of him.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNow, good Metellus, go along by him:\r\nHe loves me well, and I have given him reason;\r\nSend him but hither, and I’ll fashion him.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThe morning comes upon’s. We’ll leave you, Brutus.\r\nAnd, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember\r\nWhat you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGood gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;\r\nLet not our looks put on our purposes,\r\nBut bear it as our Roman actors do,\r\nWith untired spirits and formal constancy.\r\nAnd so, good morrow to you everyone.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt all but Brutus._]\r\n\r\nBoy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;\r\nEnjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:\r\nThou hast no figures nor no fantasies,\r\nWhich busy care draws in the brains of men;\r\nTherefore thou sleep’st so sound.\r\n\r\nEnter Portia.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nBrutus, my lord.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nPortia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?\r\nIt is not for your health thus to commit\r\nYour weak condition to the raw cold morning.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nNor for yours neither. Y’ have ungently, Brutus,\r\nStole from my bed; and yesternight at supper,\r\nYou suddenly arose, and walk’d about,\r\nMusing and sighing, with your arms across;\r\nAnd when I ask’d you what the matter was,\r\nYou star’d upon me with ungentle looks.\r\nI urg’d you further; then you scratch’d your head,\r\nAnd too impatiently stamp’d with your foot;\r\nYet I insisted, yet you answer’d not,\r\nBut with an angry wafture of your hand\r\nGave sign for me to leave you. So I did,\r\nFearing to strengthen that impatience\r\nWhich seem’d too much enkindled; and withal\r\nHoping it was but an effect of humour,\r\nWhich sometime hath his hour with every man.\r\nIt will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep;\r\nAnd could it work so much upon your shape\r\nAs it hath much prevail’d on your condition,\r\nI should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,\r\nMake me acquainted with your cause of grief.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI am not well in health, and that is all.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nBrutus is wise, and, were he not in health,\r\nHe would embrace the means to come by it.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhy, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIs Brutus sick, and is it physical\r\nTo walk unbraced and suck up the humours\r\nOf the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,\r\nAnd will he steal out of his wholesome bed\r\nTo dare the vile contagion of the night,\r\nAnd tempt the rheumy and unpurged air\r\nTo add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;\r\nYou have some sick offence within your mind,\r\nWhich, by the right and virtue of my place,\r\nI ought to know of: and, upon my knees,\r\nI charm you, by my once commended beauty,\r\nBy all your vows of love, and that great vow\r\nWhich did incorporate and make us one,\r\nThat you unfold to me, your self, your half,\r\nWhy you are heavy, and what men tonight\r\nHave had resort to you; for here have been\r\nSome six or seven, who did hide their faces\r\nEven from darkness.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nKneel not, gentle Portia.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.\r\nWithin the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,\r\nIs it excepted I should know no secrets\r\nThat appertain to you? Am I your self\r\nBut, as it were, in sort or limitation,\r\nTo keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,\r\nAnd talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs\r\nOf your good pleasure? If it be no more,\r\nPortia is Brutus’ harlot, not his wife.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYou are my true and honourable wife,\r\nAs dear to me as are the ruddy drops\r\nThat visit my sad heart.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIf this were true, then should I know this secret.\r\nI grant I am a woman; but withal\r\nA woman that Lord Brutus took to wife;\r\nI grant I am a woman; but withal\r\nA woman well reputed, Cato’s daughter.\r\nThink you I am no stronger than my sex,\r\nBeing so father’d and so husbanded?\r\nTell me your counsels, I will not disclose ’em.\r\nI have made strong proof of my constancy,\r\nGiving myself a voluntary wound\r\nHere, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience\r\nAnd not my husband’s secrets?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO ye gods,\r\nRender me worthy of this noble wife!\r\n\r\n[_Knock._]\r\n\r\nHark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile;\r\nAnd by and by thy bosom shall partake\r\nThe secrets of my heart.\r\nAll my engagements I will construe to thee,\r\nAll the charactery of my sad brows.\r\nLeave me with haste.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Portia._]\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius with Ligarius.\r\n\r\nLucius, who’s that knocks?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nHere is a sick man that would speak with you.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nCaius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.\r\nBoy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?\r\n\r\nLIGARIUS.\r\nVouchsafe good-morrow from a feeble tongue.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,\r\nTo wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!\r\n\r\nLIGARIUS.\r\nI am not sick, if Brutus have in hand\r\nAny exploit worthy the name of honour.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nSuch an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,\r\nHad you a healthful ear to hear of it.\r\n\r\nLIGARIUS.\r\nBy all the gods that Romans bow before,\r\nI here discard my sickness. Soul of Rome!\r\nBrave son, derived from honourable loins!\r\nThou, like an exorcist, hast conjur’d up\r\nMy mortified spirit. Now bid me run,\r\nAnd I will strive with things impossible,\r\nYea, get the better of them. What’s to do?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nA piece of work that will make sick men whole.\r\n\r\nLIGARIUS.\r\nBut are not some whole that we must make sick?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThat must we also. What it is, my Caius,\r\nI shall unfold to thee, as we are going,\r\nTo whom it must be done.\r\n\r\nLIGARIUS.\r\nSet on your foot,\r\nAnd with a heart new-fir’d I follow you,\r\nTo do I know not what; but it sufficeth\r\nThat Brutus leads me on.\r\n\r\n[_Thunder._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nFollow me then.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A room in Caesar’s palace.\r\n\r\nThunder and lightning. Enter Caesar, in his nightgown.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nNor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight:\r\nThrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out,\r\n“Help, ho! They murder Caesar!” Who’s within?\r\n\r\nEnter a Servant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nMy lord?\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nGo bid the priests do present sacrifice,\r\nAnd bring me their opinions of success.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nI will, my lord.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nEnter Calphurnia.\r\n\r\nCALPHURNIA.\r\nWhat mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?\r\nYou shall not stir out of your house today.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nCaesar shall forth. The things that threaten’d me\r\nNe’er look’d but on my back; when they shall see\r\nThe face of Caesar, they are vanished.\r\n\r\nCALPHURNIA.\r\nCaesar, I never stood on ceremonies,\r\nYet now they fright me. There is one within,\r\nBesides the things that we have heard and seen,\r\nRecounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.\r\nA lioness hath whelped in the streets,\r\nAnd graves have yawn’d, and yielded up their dead;\r\nFierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds\r\nIn ranks and squadrons and right form of war,\r\nWhich drizzled blood upon the Capitol;\r\nThe noise of battle hurtled in the air,\r\nHorses did neigh, and dying men did groan,\r\nAnd ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.\r\nO Caesar, these things are beyond all use,\r\nAnd I do fear them!\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWhat can be avoided\r\nWhose end is purpos’d by the mighty gods?\r\nYet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions\r\nAre to the world in general as to Caesar.\r\n\r\nCALPHURNIA.\r\nWhen beggars die, there are no comets seen;\r\nThe heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nCowards die many times before their deaths;\r\nThe valiant never taste of death but once.\r\nOf all the wonders that I yet have heard,\r\nIt seems to me most strange that men should fear,\r\nSeeing that death, a necessary end,\r\nWill come when it will come.\r\n\r\nEnter Servant.\r\n\r\nWhat say the augurers?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nThey would not have you to stir forth today.\r\nPlucking the entrails of an offering forth,\r\nThey could not find a heart within the beast.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nThe gods do this in shame of cowardice:\r\nCaesar should be a beast without a heart\r\nIf he should stay at home today for fear.\r\nNo, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well\r\nThat Caesar is more dangerous than he.\r\nWe are two lions litter’d in one day,\r\nAnd I the elder and more terrible,\r\nAnd Caesar shall go forth.\r\n\r\nCALPHURNIA.\r\nAlas, my lord,\r\nYour wisdom is consum’d in confidence.\r\nDo not go forth today: call it my fear\r\nThat keeps you in the house, and not your own.\r\nWe’ll send Mark Antony to the Senate-house,\r\nAnd he shall say you are not well today.\r\nLet me upon my knee prevail in this.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nMark Antony shall say I am not well,\r\nAnd for thy humour, I will stay at home.\r\n\r\nEnter Decius.\r\n\r\nHere’s Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nCaesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar.\r\nI come to fetch you to the Senate-house.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nAnd you are come in very happy time\r\nTo bear my greeting to the Senators,\r\nAnd tell them that I will not come today.\r\nCannot, is false; and that I dare not, falser:\r\nI will not come today. Tell them so, Decius.\r\n\r\nCALPHURNIA.\r\nSay he is sick.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nShall Caesar send a lie?\r\nHave I in conquest stretch’d mine arm so far,\r\nTo be afeard to tell grey-beards the truth?\r\nDecius, go tell them Caesar will not come.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nMost mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,\r\nLest I be laugh’d at when I tell them so.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nThe cause is in my will; I will not come.\r\nThat is enough to satisfy the Senate.\r\nBut for your private satisfaction,\r\nBecause I love you, I will let you know:\r\nCalphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home.\r\nShe dreamt tonight she saw my statue,\r\nWhich like a fountain with an hundred spouts\r\nDid run pure blood; and many lusty Romans\r\nCame smiling, and did bathe their hands in it.\r\nAnd these does she apply for warnings and portents\r\nAnd evils imminent; and on her knee\r\nHath begg’d that I will stay at home today.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nThis dream is all amiss interpreted:\r\nIt was a vision fair and fortunate.\r\nYour statue spouting blood in many pipes,\r\nIn which so many smiling Romans bath’d,\r\nSignifies that from you great Rome shall suck\r\nReviving blood, and that great men shall press\r\nFor tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.\r\nThis by Calphurnia’s dream is signified.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nAnd this way have you well expounded it.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nI have, when you have heard what I can say;\r\nAnd know it now. The Senate have concluded\r\nTo give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.\r\nIf you shall send them word you will not come,\r\nTheir minds may change. Besides, it were a mock\r\nApt to be render’d, for someone to say,\r\n“Break up the Senate till another time,\r\nWhen Caesar’s wife shall meet with better dreams.”\r\nIf Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper\r\n“Lo, Caesar is afraid”?\r\nPardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love\r\nTo your proceeding bids me tell you this,\r\nAnd reason to my love is liable.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nHow foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia!\r\nI am ashamed I did yield to them.\r\nGive me my robe, for I will go.\r\n\r\nEnter Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca, Trebonius, Cinna and Publius.\r\n\r\nAnd look where Publius is come to fetch me.\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\nGood morrow, Caesar.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWelcome, Publius.\r\nWhat, Brutus, are you stirr’d so early too?\r\nGood morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,\r\nCaesar was ne’er so much your enemy\r\nAs that same ague which hath made you lean.\r\nWhat is’t o’clock?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nCaesar, ’tis strucken eight.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nI thank you for your pains and courtesy.\r\n\r\nEnter Antony.\r\n\r\nSee! Antony, that revels long a-nights,\r\nIs notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nSo to most noble Caesar.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nBid them prepare within.\r\nI am to blame to be thus waited for.\r\nNow, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius!\r\nI have an hour’s talk in store for you:\r\nRemember that you call on me today;\r\nBe near me, that I may remember you.\r\n\r\nTREBONIUS.\r\nCaesar, I will. [_Aside._] and so near will I be,\r\nThat your best friends shall wish I had been further.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nGood friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;\r\nAnd we, like friends, will straightway go together.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\n[_Aside._] That every like is not the same, O Caesar,\r\nThe heart of Brutus yearns to think upon.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. A street near the Capitol.\r\n\r\nEnter Artemidorus, reading a paper.\r\n\r\nARTEMIDORUS.\r\n_“Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; come not near Casca;\r\nhave an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius; mark well Metellus Cimber;\r\nDecius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast wrong’d Caius Ligarius. There\r\nis but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar. If\r\nthou be’st not immortal, look about you: security gives way to\r\nconspiracy. The mighty gods defend thee!\r\nThy lover, Artemidorus.”_ Here will I stand till Caesar pass along, And\r\nas a suitor will I give him this. My heart laments that virtue cannot\r\nlive Out of the teeth of emulation. If thou read this, O Caesar, thou\r\nmayest live; If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. Another part of the same street, before the house of Brutus.\r\n\r\nEnter Portia and Lucius.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI pr’ythee, boy, run to the Senate-house;\r\nStay not to answer me, but get thee gone.\r\nWhy dost thou stay?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nTo know my errand, madam.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI would have had thee there and here again,\r\nEre I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.\r\n[_Aside._] O constancy, be strong upon my side,\r\nSet a huge mountain ’tween my heart and tongue!\r\nI have a man’s mind, but a woman’s might.\r\nHow hard it is for women to keep counsel!\r\nArt thou here yet?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nMadam, what should I do?\r\nRun to the Capitol, and nothing else?\r\nAnd so return to you, and nothing else?\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nYes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,\r\nFor he went sickly forth: and take good note\r\nWhat Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.\r\nHark, boy, what noise is that?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nI hear none, madam.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nPr’ythee, listen well.\r\nI heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,\r\nAnd the wind brings it from the Capitol.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nSooth, madam, I hear nothing.\r\n\r\nEnter the Soothsayer.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nCome hither, fellow:\r\nWhich way hast thou been?\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nAt mine own house, good lady.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nWhat is’t o’clock?\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nAbout the ninth hour, lady.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nIs Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nMadam, not yet. I go to take my stand,\r\nTo see him pass on to the Capitol.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nThou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nThat I have, lady, if it will please Caesar\r\nTo be so good to Caesar as to hear me,\r\nI shall beseech him to befriend himself.\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nWhy, know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him?\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nNone that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.\r\nGood morrow to you. Here the street is narrow.\r\nThe throng that follows Caesar at the heels,\r\nOf Senators, of Praetors, common suitors,\r\nWill crowd a feeble man almost to death:\r\nI’ll get me to a place more void, and there\r\nSpeak to great Caesar as he comes along.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nPORTIA.\r\nI must go in.\r\n[_Aside._] Ay me, how weak a thing\r\nThe heart of woman is! O Brutus,\r\nThe heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!\r\nSure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit\r\nThat Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.\r\nRun, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;\r\nSay I am merry; come to me again,\r\nAnd bring me word what he doth say to thee.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT III\r\n\r\nSCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\nA crowd of people in the street leading to the Capitol. Flourish. Enter\r\nCaesar, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius, Cinna,\r\nAntony, Lepidus, Artemidorus, Publius, Popilius and the Soothsayer.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nThe Ides of March are come.\r\n\r\nSOOTHSAYER.\r\nAy, Caesar; but not gone.\r\n\r\nARTEMIDORUS.\r\nHail, Caesar! Read this schedule.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nTrebonius doth desire you to o’er-read,\r\nAt your best leisure, this his humble suit.\r\n\r\nARTEMIDORUS.\r\nO Caesar, read mine first; for mine’s a suit\r\nThat touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWhat touches us ourself shall be last serv’d.\r\n\r\nARTEMIDORUS.\r\nDelay not, Caesar. Read it instantly.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWhat, is the fellow mad?\r\n\r\nPUBLIUS.\r\nSirrah, give place.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhat, urge you your petitions in the street?\r\nCome to the Capitol.\r\n\r\nCaesar enters the Capitol, the rest following. All the Senators rise.\r\n\r\nPOPILIUS.\r\nI wish your enterprise today may thrive.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhat enterprise, Popilius?\r\n\r\nPOPILIUS.\r\nFare you well.\r\n\r\n[_Advances to Caesar._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat said Popilius Lena?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHe wish’d today our enterprise might thrive.\r\nI fear our purpose is discovered.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nLook how he makes to Caesar: mark him.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nCasca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.\r\nBrutus, what shall be done? If this be known,\r\nCassius or Caesar never shall turn back,\r\nFor I will slay myself.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nCassius, be constant:\r\nPopilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;\r\nFor look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nTrebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus,\r\nHe draws Mark Antony out of the way.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Antony and Trebonius. Caesar and the Senators take their\r\nseats._]\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nWhere is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,\r\nAnd presently prefer his suit to Caesar.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHe is address’d; press near and second him.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nCasca, you are the first that rears your hand.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nAre we all ready? What is now amiss\r\nThat Caesar and his Senate must redress?\r\n\r\nMETELLUS.\r\nMost high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,\r\nMetellus Cimber throws before thy seat\r\nAn humble heart.\r\n\r\n[_Kneeling._]\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nI must prevent thee, Cimber.\r\nThese couchings and these lowly courtesies\r\nMight fire the blood of ordinary men,\r\nAnd turn pre-ordinance and first decree\r\nInto the law of children. Be not fond,\r\nTo think that Caesar bears such rebel blood\r\nThat will be thaw’d from the true quality\r\nWith that which melteth fools; I mean sweet words,\r\nLow-crooked curtsies, and base spaniel fawning.\r\nThy brother by decree is banished:\r\nIf thou dost bend, and pray, and fawn for him,\r\nI spurn thee like a cur out of my way.\r\nKnow, Caesar dost not wrong, nor without cause\r\nWill he be satisfied.\r\n\r\nMETELLUS.\r\nIs there no voice more worthy than my own,\r\nTo sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear\r\nFor the repealing of my banish’d brother?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;\r\nDesiring thee that Publius Cimber may\r\nHave an immediate freedom of repeal.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nWhat, Brutus?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nPardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:\r\nAs low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,\r\nTo beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nI could be well mov’d, if I were as you;\r\nIf I could pray to move, prayers would move me:\r\nBut I am constant as the northern star,\r\nOf whose true-fix’d and resting quality\r\nThere is no fellow in the firmament.\r\nThe skies are painted with unnumber’d sparks,\r\nThey are all fire, and every one doth shine;\r\nBut there’s but one in all doth hold his place.\r\nSo in the world; ’tis furnish’d well with men,\r\nAnd men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;\r\nYet in the number I do know but one\r\nThat unassailable holds on his rank,\r\nUnshak’d of motion: and that I am he,\r\nLet me a little show it, even in this,\r\nThat I was constant Cimber should be banish’d,\r\nAnd constant do remain to keep him so.\r\n\r\nCINNA.\r\nO Caesar,—\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nHence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nGreat Caesar,—\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\nDoth not Brutus bootless kneel?\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nSpeak, hands, for me!\r\n\r\n[_Casca stabs Caesar in the neck. Caesar catches hold of his arm. He is\r\nthen stabbed by several other Conspirators, and at last by Marcus\r\nBrutus._]\r\n\r\nCAESAR.\r\n_Et tu, Brute?_—Then fall, Caesar!\r\n\r\n[_Dies.

Publius, good cheer!\r\nThere is no harm intended to your person,\r\nNor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAnd leave us, Publius; lest that the people\r\nRushing on us, should do your age some mischief.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nDo so; and let no man abide this deed\r\nBut we the doers.\r\n\r\nEnter Trebonius.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhere’s Antony?\r\n\r\nTREBONIUS.\r\nFled to his house amaz’d.\r\nMen, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run,\r\nAs it were doomsday.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nFates, we will know your pleasures.\r\nThat we shall die, we know; ’tis but the time\r\nAnd drawing days out, that men stand upon.\r\n\r\nCASCA.\r\nWhy, he that cuts off twenty years of life\r\nCuts off so many years of fearing death.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGrant that, and then is death a benefit:\r\nSo are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridg’d\r\nHis time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,\r\nAnd let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood\r\nUp to the elbows, and besmear our swords:\r\nThen walk we forth, even to the market-place,\r\nAnd waving our red weapons o’er our heads,\r\nLet’s all cry, “Peace, freedom, and liberty!”\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nStoop then, and wash. How many ages hence\r\nShall this our lofty scene be acted over\r\nIn States unborn, and accents yet unknown!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHow many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,\r\nThat now on Pompey’s basis lies along,\r\nNo worthier than the dust!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nSo oft as that shall be,\r\nSo often shall the knot of us be call’d\r\nThe men that gave their country liberty.\r\n\r\nDECIUS.\r\nWhat, shall we forth?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAy, every man away.\r\nBrutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels\r\nWith the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.\r\n\r\nEnter a Servant.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nSoft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nThus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel;\r\nThus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;\r\nAnd, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:\r\nBrutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;\r\nCaesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving;\r\nSay I love Brutus and I honour him;\r\nSay I fear’d Caesar, honour’d him, and lov’d him.\r\nIf Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony\r\nMay safely come to him, and be resolv’d\r\nHow Caesar hath deserv’d to lie in death,\r\nMark Antony shall not love Caesar dead\r\nSo well as Brutus living; but will follow\r\nThe fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus\r\nThorough the hazards of this untrod state,\r\nWith all true faith. So says my master Antony.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThy master is a wise and valiant Roman;\r\nI never thought him worse.\r\nTell him, so please him come unto this place,\r\nHe shall be satisfied and, by my honour,\r\nDepart untouch’d.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nI’ll fetch him presently.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI know that we shall have him well to friend.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI wish we may: but yet have I a mind\r\nThat fears him much; and my misgiving still\r\nFalls shrewdly to the purpose.\r\n\r\nEnter Antony.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nBut here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nO mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?\r\nAre all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,\r\nShrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.\r\nI know not, gentlemen, what you intend,\r\nWho else must be let blood, who else is rank:\r\nIf I myself, there is no hour so fit\r\nAs Caesar’s death’s hour; nor no instrument\r\nOf half that worth as those your swords, made rich\r\nWith the most noble blood of all this world.\r\nI do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,\r\nNow, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,\r\nFulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,\r\nI shall not find myself so apt to die.\r\nNo place will please me so, no means of death,\r\nAs here by Caesar, and by you cut off,\r\nThe choice and master spirits of this age.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO Antony, beg not your death of us.\r\nThough now we must appear bloody and cruel,\r\nAs by our hands and this our present act\r\nYou see we do; yet see you but our hands\r\nAnd this the bleeding business they have done.\r\nOur hearts you see not; they are pitiful;\r\nAnd pity to the general wrong of Rome—\r\nAs fire drives out fire, so pity pity—\r\nHath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,\r\nTo you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;\r\nOur arms in strength of malice, and our hearts\r\nOf brothers’ temper, do receive you in\r\nWith all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nYour voice shall be as strong as any man’s\r\nIn the disposing of new dignities.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nOnly be patient till we have appeas’d\r\nThe multitude, beside themselves with fear,\r\nAnd then we will deliver you the cause\r\nWhy I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,\r\nHave thus proceeded.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nI doubt not of your wisdom.\r\nLet each man render me his bloody hand.\r\nFirst, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;\r\nNext, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.\r\nNow, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus;\r\nYours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;\r\nThough last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.\r\nGentlemen all—alas, what shall I say?\r\nMy credit now stands on such slippery ground,\r\nThat one of two bad ways you must conceit me,\r\nEither a coward or a flatterer.\r\nThat I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true:\r\nIf then thy spirit look upon us now,\r\nShall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,\r\nTo see thy Antony making his peace,\r\nShaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,\r\nMost noble, in the presence of thy corse?\r\nHad I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,\r\nWeeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,\r\nIt would become me better than to close\r\nIn terms of friendship with thine enemies.\r\nPardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay’d, brave hart;\r\nHere didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,\r\nSign’d in thy spoil, and crimson’d in thy lethe.\r\nO world, thou wast the forest to this hart;\r\nAnd this indeed, O world, the heart of thee.\r\nHow like a deer strucken by many princes,\r\nDost thou here lie!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nMark Antony,—\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nPardon me, Caius Cassius:\r\nThe enemies of Caesar shall say this;\r\nThen, in a friend, it is cold modesty.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI blame you not for praising Caesar so;\r\nBut what compact mean you to have with us?\r\nWill you be prick’d in number of our friends,\r\nOr shall we on, and not depend on you?\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nTherefore I took your hands; but was indeed\r\nSway’d from the point, by looking down on Caesar.\r\nFriends am I with you all, and love you all,\r\nUpon this hope, that you shall give me reasons\r\nWhy, and wherein, Caesar was dangerous.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nOr else were this a savage spectacle.\r\nOur reasons are so full of good regard\r\nThat were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,\r\nYou should be satisfied.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nThat’s all I seek,\r\nAnd am moreover suitor that I may\r\nProduce his body to the market-place;\r\nAnd in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,\r\nSpeak in the order of his funeral.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYou shall, Mark Antony.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBrutus, a word with you.\r\n[_Aside to Brutus._] You know not what you do. Do not consent\r\nThat Antony speak in his funeral.\r\nKnow you how much the people may be mov’d\r\nBy that which he will utter?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\n[_Aside to Cassius._] By your pardon:\r\nI will myself into the pulpit first,\r\nAnd show the reason of our Caesar’s death.\r\nWhat Antony shall speak, I will protest\r\nHe speaks by leave and by permission;\r\nAnd that we are contented Caesar shall\r\nHave all true rights and lawful ceremonies.\r\nIt shall advantage more than do us wrong.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\n[_Aside to Brutus._] I know not what may fall; I like it not.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nMark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body.\r\nYou shall not in your funeral speech blame us,\r\nBut speak all good you can devise of Caesar,\r\nAnd say you do’t by our permission;\r\nElse shall you not have any hand at all\r\nAbout his funeral. And you shall speak\r\nIn the same pulpit whereto I am going,\r\nAfter my speech is ended.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nBe it so;\r\nI do desire no more.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nPrepare the body, then, and follow us.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt all but Antony._]\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nO, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,\r\nThat I am meek and gentle with these butchers.\r\nThou art the ruins of the noblest man\r\nThat ever lived in the tide of times.\r\nWoe to the hand that shed this costly blood!\r\nOver thy wounds now do I prophesy,\r\nWhich, like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips\r\nTo beg the voice and utterance of my tongue,\r\nA curse shall light upon the limbs of men;\r\nDomestic fury and fierce civil strife\r\nShall cumber all the parts of Italy;\r\nBlood and destruction shall be so in use,\r\nAnd dreadful objects so familiar,\r\nThat mothers shall but smile when they behold\r\nTheir infants quartered with the hands of war;\r\nAll pity chok’d with custom of fell deeds:\r\nAnd Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge,\r\nWith Ate by his side come hot from Hell,\r\nShall in these confines with a monarch’s voice\r\nCry havoc and let slip the dogs of war,\r\nThat this foul deed shall smell above the earth\r\nWith carrion men, groaning for burial.\r\n\r\nEnter a Servant.\r\n\r\nYou serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nI do, Mark Antony.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nCaesar did write for him to come to Rome.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nHe did receive his letters, and is coming,\r\nAnd bid me say to you by word of mouth,—\r\n[_Seeing the body._] O Caesar!\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nThy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.\r\nPassion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,\r\nSeeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,\r\nBegan to water. Is thy master coming?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nHe lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nPost back with speed, and tell him what hath chanc’d.\r\nHere is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,\r\nNo Rome of safety for Octavius yet.\r\nHie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile;\r\nThou shalt not back till I have borne this corse\r\nInto the market-place: there shall I try,\r\nIn my oration, how the people take\r\nThe cruel issue of these bloody men;\r\nAccording to the which thou shalt discourse\r\nTo young Octavius of the state of things.\r\nLend me your hand.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt with Caesar’s body._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same. The Forum.\r\n\r\nEnter Brutus and goes into the pulpit, and Cassius, with a throng of\r\nCitizens.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nWe will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThen follow me, and give me audience, friends.\r\nCassius, go you into the other street\r\nAnd part the numbers.\r\nThose that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here;\r\nThose that will follow Cassius, go with him;\r\nAnd public reasons shall be rendered\r\nOf Caesar’s death.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nI will hear Brutus speak.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nI will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,\r\nWhen severally we hear them rendered.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Cassius, with some of the Citizens. Brutus goes into the\r\nrostrum._]\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nThe noble Brutus is ascended: silence!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nBe patient till the last.\r\nRomans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause; and be silent,\r\nthat you may hear. Believe me for mine honour, and have respect to mine\r\nhonour, that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your\r\nsenses, that you may the better judge. If there be any in this\r\nassembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love\r\nto Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus\r\nrose against Caesar, this is my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less,\r\nbut that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die\r\nall slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all free men? As Caesar\r\nloved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he\r\nwas valiant, I honour him; but, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There\r\nis tears, for his love; joy for his fortune; honour for his valour; and\r\ndeath, for his ambition. Who is here so base, that would be a bondman?\r\nIf any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so rude, that would\r\nnot be a Roman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so\r\nvile, that will not love his country? If any, speak; for him have I\r\noffended. I pause for a reply.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nNone, Brutus, none.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThen none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall\r\ndo to Brutus. The question of his death is enroll’d in the Capitol, his\r\nglory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy; nor his offences enforc’d,\r\nfor which he suffered death.\r\n\r\nEnter Antony and others, with Caesar’s body.\r\n\r\nHere comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand\r\nin his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the\r\ncommonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this I depart, that, as I\r\nslew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for\r\nmyself, when it shall please my country to need my death.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nLive, Brutus! live, live!\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nBring him with triumph home unto his house.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nGive him a statue with his ancestors.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nLet him be Caesar.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nCaesar’s better parts\r\nShall be crown’d in Brutus.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nWe’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamours.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nMy countrymen,—\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nPeace! Silence! Brutus speaks.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nPeace, ho!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGood countrymen, let me depart alone,\r\nAnd, for my sake, stay here with Antony.\r\nDo grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech\r\nTending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony,\r\nBy our permission, is allow’d to make.\r\nI do entreat you, not a man depart,\r\nSave I alone, till Antony have spoke.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nStay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nLet him go up into the public chair.\r\nWe’ll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nFor Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you.\r\n\r\n[_Goes up._]\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nWhat does he say of Brutus?\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nHe says, for Brutus’ sake\r\nHe finds himself beholding to us all.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\n’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here!\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nThis Caesar was a tyrant.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nNay, that’s certain.\r\nWe are blest that Rome is rid of him.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nPeace! let us hear what Antony can say.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nYou gentle Romans,—\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nPeace, ho! let us hear him.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nFriends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;\r\nI come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.\r\nThe evil that men do lives after them,\r\nThe good is oft interred with their bones;\r\nSo let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus\r\nHath told you Caesar was ambitious.\r\nIf it were so, it was a grievous fault,\r\nAnd grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.\r\nHere, under leave of Brutus and the rest,\r\nFor Brutus is an honourable man,\r\nSo are they all, all honourable men,\r\nCome I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.\r\nHe was my friend, faithful and just to me;\r\nBut Brutus says he was ambitious,\r\nAnd Brutus is an honourable man.\r\nHe hath brought many captives home to Rome,\r\nWhose ransoms did the general coffers fill:\r\nDid this in Caesar seem ambitious?\r\nWhen that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;\r\nAmbition should be made of sterner stuff:\r\nYet Brutus says he was ambitious;\r\nAnd Brutus is an honourable man.\r\nYou all did see that on the Lupercal\r\nI thrice presented him a kingly crown,\r\nWhich he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?\r\nYet Brutus says he was ambitious;\r\nAnd sure he is an honourable man.\r\nI speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,\r\nBut here I am to speak what I do know.\r\nYou all did love him once, not without cause;\r\nWhat cause withholds you then to mourn for him?\r\nO judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,\r\nAnd men have lost their reason. Bear with me.\r\nMy heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,\r\nAnd I must pause till it come back to me.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nMethinks there is much reason in his sayings.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nIf thou consider rightly of the matter,\r\nCaesar has had great wrong.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nHas he, masters?\r\nI fear there will a worse come in his place.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nMark’d ye his words? He would not take the crown;\r\nTherefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nIf it be found so, some will dear abide it.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nPoor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nThere’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nNow mark him; he begins again to speak.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nBut yesterday the word of Caesar might\r\nHave stood against the world; now lies he there,\r\nAnd none so poor to do him reverence.\r\nO masters! If I were dispos’d to stir\r\nYour hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,\r\nI should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,\r\nWho, you all know, are honourable men.\r\nI will not do them wrong; I rather choose\r\nTo wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,\r\nThan I will wrong such honourable men.\r\nBut here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar,\r\nI found it in his closet; ’tis his will:\r\nLet but the commons hear this testament,\r\nWhich, pardon me, I do not mean to read,\r\nAnd they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds,\r\nAnd dip their napkins in his sacred blood;\r\nYea, beg a hair of him for memory,\r\nAnd, dying, mention it within their wills,\r\nBequeathing it as a rich legacy\r\nUnto their issue.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nWe’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nThe will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nHave patience, gentle friends, I must not read it.\r\nIt is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.\r\nYou are not wood, you are not stones, but men;\r\nAnd being men, hearing the will of Caesar,\r\nIt will inflame you, it will make you mad.\r\n’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;\r\nFor if you should, O, what would come of it?\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nRead the will! We’ll hear it, Antony;\r\nYou shall read us the will, Caesar’s will!\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nWill you be patient? Will you stay awhile?\r\nI have o’ershot myself to tell you of it.\r\nI fear I wrong the honourable men\r\nWhose daggers have stabb’d Caesar; I do fear it.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nThey were traitors. Honourable men!\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nThe will! The testament!\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nThey were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will!\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nYou will compel me then to read the will?\r\nThen make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,\r\nAnd let me show you him that made the will.\r\nShall I descend? and will you give me leave?\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nCome down.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nDescend.\r\n\r\n[_He comes down._]\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nYou shall have leave.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nA ring! Stand round.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nStand from the hearse, stand from the body.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nRoom for Antony, most noble Antony!\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nNay, press not so upon me; stand far off.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nStand back; room! bear back.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nIf you have tears, prepare to shed them now.\r\nYou all do know this mantle. I remember\r\nThe first time ever Caesar put it on;\r\n’Twas on a Summer’s evening, in his tent,\r\nThat day he overcame the Nervii.\r\nLook, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through:\r\nSee what a rent the envious Casca made:\r\nThrough this the well-beloved Brutus stabb’d;\r\nAnd as he pluck’d his cursed steel away,\r\nMark how the blood of Caesar follow’d it,\r\nAs rushing out of doors, to be resolv’d\r\nIf Brutus so unkindly knock’d, or no;\r\nFor Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.\r\nJudge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar lov’d him.\r\nThis was the most unkindest cut of all;\r\nFor when the noble Caesar saw him stab,\r\nIngratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,\r\nQuite vanquish’d him: then burst his mighty heart;\r\nAnd in his mantle muffling up his face,\r\nEven at the base of Pompey’s statue\r\nWhich all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.\r\nO, what a fall was there, my countrymen!\r\nThen I, and you, and all of us fell down,\r\nWhilst bloody treason flourish’d over us.\r\nO, now you weep; and I perceive you feel\r\nThe dint of pity. These are gracious drops.\r\nKind souls, what weep you when you but behold\r\nOur Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here,\r\nHere is himself, marr’d, as you see, with traitors.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nO piteous spectacle!\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nO noble Caesar!\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nO woeful day!\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nO traitors, villains!\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nO most bloody sight!\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nWe will be revenged.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nRevenge,—about,—seek,—burn,—fire,—kill,—slay,—let not a traitor live!\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nStay, countrymen.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nPeace there! Hear the noble Antony.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nWe’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nGood friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up\r\nTo such a sudden flood of mutiny.\r\nThey that have done this deed are honourable.\r\nWhat private griefs they have, alas, I know not,\r\nThat made them do it. They’re wise and honourable,\r\nAnd will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.\r\nI come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.\r\nI am no orator, as Brutus is;\r\nBut, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,\r\nThat love my friend; and that they know full well\r\nThat gave me public leave to speak of him.\r\nFor I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,\r\nAction, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,\r\nTo stir men’s blood. I only speak right on.\r\nI tell you that which you yourselves do know,\r\nShow you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,\r\nAnd bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,\r\nAnd Brutus Antony, there were an Antony\r\nWould ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue\r\nIn every wound of Caesar, that should move\r\nThe stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nWe’ll mutiny.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nWe’ll burn the house of Brutus.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nAway, then! come, seek the conspirators.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nYet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nPeace, ho! Hear Antony; most noble Antony.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nWhy, friends, you go to do you know not what.\r\nWherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?\r\nAlas, you know not; I must tell you then.\r\nYou have forgot the will I told you of.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nMost true; the will!—let’s stay, and hear the will.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nHere is the will, and under Caesar’s seal.\r\nTo every Roman citizen he gives,\r\nTo every several man, seventy-five drachmas.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nMost noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nO, royal Caesar!\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nHear me with patience.\r\n\r\nCITIZENS.\r\nPeace, ho!\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nMoreover, he hath left you all his walks,\r\nHis private arbors, and new-planted orchards,\r\nOn this side Tiber; he hath left them you,\r\nAnd to your heirs forever; common pleasures,\r\nTo walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.\r\nHere was a Caesar! when comes such another?\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nNever, never. Come, away, away!\r\nWe’ll burn his body in the holy place,\r\nAnd with the brands fire the traitors’ houses.\r\nTake up the body.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nGo, fetch fire.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CITIZEN.\r\nPluck down benches.\r\n\r\nFOURTH CITIZEN.\r\nPluck down forms, windows, anything.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Citizens, with the body._]\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nNow let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,\r\nTake thou what course thou wilt!\r\n\r\nEnter a Servant.\r\n\r\nHow now, fellow?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nSir, Octavius is already come to Rome.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nWhere is he?\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nHe and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nAnd thither will I straight to visit him.\r\nHe comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,\r\nAnd in this mood will give us anything.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nI heard him say Brutus and Cassius\r\nAre rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nBelike they had some notice of the people,\r\nHow I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. The same.

Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I a married\r\nman or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man directly and briefly,\r\nwisely and truly. Wisely I say I am a bachelor.\r\n\r\nSECOND CITIZEN.\r\nThat’s as much as to say they are fools that marry; you’ll bear me a\r\nbang for that, I fear.

Is it fit,\r\nThe three-fold world divided, he should stand\r\nOne of the three to share it?\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nSo you thought him,\r\nAnd took his voice who should be prick’d to die\r\nIn our black sentence and proscription.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nOctavius, I have seen more days than you;\r\nAnd though we lay these honours on this man,\r\nTo ease ourselves of divers sland’rous loads,\r\nHe shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,\r\nTo groan and sweat under the business,\r\nEither led or driven, as we point the way;\r\nAnd having brought our treasure where we will,\r\nThen take we down his load, and turn him off,\r\nLike to the empty ass, to shake his ears,\r\nAnd graze in commons.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nYou may do your will;\r\nBut he’s a tried and valiant soldier.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nSo is my horse, Octavius; and for that\r\nI do appoint him store of provender.\r\nIt is a creature that I teach to fight,\r\nTo wind, to stop, to run directly on,\r\nHis corporal motion govern’d by my spirit.\r\nAnd, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:\r\nHe must be taught, and train’d, and bid go forth:\r\nA barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds\r\nOn objects, arts, and imitations,\r\nWhich, out of use and stal’d by other men,\r\nBegin his fashion. Do not talk of him\r\nBut as a property. And now, Octavius,\r\nListen great things. Brutus and Cassius\r\nAre levying powers; we must straight make head.\r\nTherefore let our alliance be combin’d,\r\nOur best friends made, our means stretch’d;\r\nAnd let us presently go sit in council,\r\nHow covert matters may be best disclos’d,\r\nAnd open perils surest answered.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nLet us do so: for we are at the stake,\r\nAnd bay’d about with many enemies;\r\nAnd some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,\r\nMillions of mischiefs.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. Before Brutus’ tent, in the camp near Sardis.\r\n\r\nDrum. Enter Brutus, Lucilius, Titinius and Soldiers; Pindarus meeting\r\nthem; Lucius at some distance.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nStand, ho!\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nGive the word, ho! and stand.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nHe is at hand, and Pindarus is come\r\nTo do you salutation from his master.\r\n\r\n[_Pindarus gives a letter to Brutus._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHe greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,\r\nIn his own change, or by ill officers,\r\nHath given me some worthy cause to wish\r\nThings done, undone: but, if he be at hand,\r\nI shall be satisfied.\r\n\r\nPINDARUS.\r\nI do not doubt\r\nBut that my noble master will appear\r\nSuch as he is, full of regard and honour.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHe is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;\r\nHow he received you, let me be resolv’d.\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nWith courtesy and with respect enough,\r\nBut not with such familiar instances,\r\nNor with such free and friendly conference,\r\nAs he hath us’d of old.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThou hast describ’d\r\nA hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,\r\nWhen love begins to sicken and decay\r\nIt useth an enforced ceremony.\r\nThere are no tricks in plain and simple faith;\r\nBut hollow men, like horses hot at hand,\r\nMake gallant show and promise of their mettle;\r\n\r\n[_Low march within._]\r\n\r\nBut when they should endure the bloody spur,\r\nThey fall their crests, and like deceitful jades\r\nSink in the trial. Comes his army on?\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nThey meant this night in Sardis to be quarter’d;\r\nThe greater part, the horse in general,\r\nAre come with Cassius.\r\n\r\nEnter Cassius and Soldiers.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHark! he is arriv’d.\r\nMarch gently on to meet him.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nStand, ho!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nStand, ho! Speak the word along.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER.\r\nStand!\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER.\r\nStand!\r\n\r\nTHIRD SOLDIER.\r\nStand!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nMost noble brother, you have done me wrong.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nJudge me, you gods; wrong I mine enemies?\r\nAnd if not so, how should I wrong a brother?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBrutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;\r\nAnd when you do them—\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nCassius, be content.\r\nSpeak your griefs softly, I do know you well.\r\nBefore the eyes of both our armies here,\r\nWhich should perceive nothing but love from us,\r\nLet us not wrangle. Bid them move away;\r\nThen in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,\r\nAnd I will give you audience.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nPindarus,\r\nBid our commanders lead their charges off\r\nA little from this ground.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nLucilius, do you the like; and let no man\r\nCome to our tent till we have done our conference.\r\nLucius and Titinius, guard our door.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Within the tent of Brutus.\r\n\r\nEnter Brutus and Cassius.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThat you have wrong’d me doth appear in this:\r\nYou have condemn’d and noted Lucius Pella\r\nFor taking bribes here of the Sardians;\r\nWherein my letters, praying on his side\r\nBecause I knew the man, were slighted off.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYou wrong’d yourself to write in such a case.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nIn such a time as this it is not meet\r\nThat every nice offence should bear his comment.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nLet me tell you, Cassius, you yourself\r\nAre much condemn’d to have an itching palm,\r\nTo sell and mart your offices for gold\r\nTo undeservers.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI an itching palm!\r\nYou know that you are Brutus that speak this,\r\nOr, by the gods, this speech were else your last.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThe name of Cassius honours this corruption,\r\nAnd chastisement doth therefore hide his head.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nChastisement!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nRemember March, the Ides of March remember:\r\nDid not great Julius bleed for justice’ sake?\r\nWhat villain touch’d his body, that did stab,\r\nAnd not for justice? What! Shall one of us,\r\nThat struck the foremost man of all this world\r\nBut for supporting robbers, shall we now\r\nContaminate our fingers with base bribes,\r\nAnd sell the mighty space of our large honours\r\nFor so much trash as may be grasped thus?\r\nI had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,\r\nThan such a Roman.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBrutus, bait not me,\r\nI’ll not endure it. You forget yourself,\r\nTo hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,\r\nOlder in practice, abler than yourself\r\nTo make conditions.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGo to; you are not, Cassius.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI am.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI say you are not.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nUrge me no more, I shall forget myself;\r\nHave mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAway, slight man!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nIs’t possible?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHear me, for I will speak.\r\nMust I give way and room to your rash choler?\r\nShall I be frighted when a madman stares?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nO ye gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAll this? ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;\r\nGo show your slaves how choleric you are,\r\nAnd make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?\r\nMust I observe you? Must I stand and crouch\r\nUnder your testy humour? By the gods,\r\nYou shall digest the venom of your spleen,\r\nThough it do split you; for, from this day forth,\r\nI’ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,\r\nWhen you are waspish.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nIs it come to this?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYou say you are a better soldier:\r\nLet it appear so; make your vaunting true,\r\nAnd it shall please me well. For mine own part,\r\nI shall be glad to learn of noble men.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nYou wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.\r\nI said, an elder soldier, not a better:\r\nDid I say better?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nIf you did, I care not.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhen Caesar liv’d, he durst not thus have mov’d me.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nPeace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI durst not?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhat? durst not tempt him?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nFor your life you durst not.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nDo not presume too much upon my love.\r\nI may do that I shall be sorry for.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYou have done that you should be sorry for.\r\nThere is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,\r\nFor I am arm’d so strong in honesty,\r\nThat they pass by me as the idle wind,\r\nWhich I respect not. I did send to you\r\nFor certain sums of gold, which you denied me;\r\nFor I can raise no money by vile means:\r\nBy Heaven, I had rather coin my heart,\r\nAnd drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring\r\nFrom the hard hands of peasants their vile trash\r\nBy any indirection. I did send\r\nTo you for gold to pay my legions,\r\nWhich you denied me: was that done like Cassius?\r\nShould I have answer’d Caius Cassius so?\r\nWhen Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,\r\nTo lock such rascal counters from his friends,\r\nBe ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,\r\nDash him to pieces!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI denied you not.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYou did.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI did not. He was but a fool\r\nThat brought my answer back. Brutus hath riv’d my heart.\r\nA friend should bear his friend’s infirmities;\r\nBut Brutus makes mine greater than they are.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI do not, till you practise them on me.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nYou love me not.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI do not like your faults.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nA friendly eye could never see such faults.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nA flatterer’s would not, though they do appear\r\nAs huge as high Olympus.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nCome, Antony, and young Octavius, come,\r\nRevenge yourselves alone on Cassius,\r\nFor Cassius is a-weary of the world:\r\nHated by one he loves; brav’d by his brother;\r\nCheck’d like a bondman; all his faults observ’d,\r\nSet in a note-book, learn’d and conn’d by rote,\r\nTo cast into my teeth. O, I could weep\r\nMy spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,\r\nAnd here my naked breast; within, a heart\r\nDearer than Plutus’ mine, richer than gold:\r\nIf that thou be’st a Roman, take it forth.\r\nI, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:\r\nStrike as thou didst at Caesar; for I know,\r\nWhen thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better\r\nThan ever thou lovedst Cassius.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nSheathe your dagger.\r\nBe angry when you will, it shall have scope;\r\nDo what you will, dishonour shall be humour.\r\nO Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb\r\nThat carries anger as the flint bears fire,\r\nWho, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,\r\nAnd straight is cold again.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHath Cassius liv’d\r\nTo be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,\r\nWhen grief and blood ill-temper’d vexeth him?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhen I spoke that, I was ill-temper’d too.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nDo you confess so much? Give me your hand.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAnd my heart too.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nO Brutus!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat’s the matter?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHave not you love enough to bear with me,\r\nWhen that rash humour which my mother gave me\r\nMakes me forgetful?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYes, Cassius; and from henceforth,\r\nWhen you are over-earnest with your Brutus,\r\nHe’ll think your mother chides, and leave you so.\r\n\r\nEnter Poet, followed by Lucilius, Titinius and Lucius.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\n[_Within._] Let me go in to see the generals,\r\nThere is some grudge between ’em; ’tis not meet\r\nThey be alone.\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\n[_Within._] You shall not come to them.\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\n[_Within._] Nothing but death shall stay me.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHow now! What’s the matter?\r\n\r\nPOET.\r\nFor shame, you generals! What do you mean?\r\nLove, and be friends, as two such men should be;\r\nFor I have seen more years, I’m sure, than ye.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHa, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGet you hence, sirrah. Saucy fellow, hence!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nBear with him, Brutus; ’tis his fashion.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI’ll know his humour when he knows his time.\r\nWhat should the wars do with these jigging fools?\r\nCompanion, hence!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAway, away, be gone!\r\n\r\n[_Exit Poet._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nLucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders\r\nPrepare to lodge their companies tonight.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAnd come yourselves and bring Messala with you\r\nImmediately to us.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius._]\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nLucius, a bowl of wine.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Lucius._]\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI did not think you could have been so angry.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nOf your philosophy you make no use,\r\nIf you give place to accidental evils.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNo man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHa? Portia?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nShe is dead.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHow ’scap’d I killing, when I cross’d you so?\r\nO insupportable and touching loss!\r\nUpon what sickness?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nImpatient of my absence,\r\nAnd grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony\r\nHave made themselves so strong; for with her death\r\nThat tidings came. With this she fell distract,\r\nAnd, her attendants absent, swallow’d fire.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAnd died so?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nEven so.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nO ye immortal gods!\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius, with wine and a taper.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nSpeak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.\r\nIn this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.\r\n\r\n[_Drinks._]\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nMy heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.\r\nFill, Lucius, till the wine o’erswell the cup.\r\nI cannot drink too much of Brutus’ love.\r\n\r\n[_Drinks._]\r\n\r\n[_Exit Lucius._]\r\n\r\nEnter Titinius and Messala.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nCome in, Titinius!\r\nWelcome, good Messala.\r\nNow sit we close about this taper here,\r\nAnd call in question our necessities.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nPortia, art thou gone?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNo more, I pray you.\r\nMessala, I have here received letters,\r\nThat young Octavius and Mark Antony\r\nCome down upon us with a mighty power,\r\nBending their expedition toward Philippi.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nMyself have letters of the selfsame tenor.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWith what addition?\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nThat by proscription and bills of outlawry\r\nOctavius, Antony, and Lepidus\r\nHave put to death an hundred Senators.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nTherein our letters do not well agree.\r\nMine speak of seventy Senators that died\r\nBy their proscriptions, Cicero being one.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nCicero one!\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nCicero is dead,\r\nAnd by that order of proscription.\r\nHad you your letters from your wife, my lord?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNo, Messala.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nNor nothing in your letters writ of her?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNothing, Messala.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nThat, methinks, is strange.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhy ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nNo, my lord.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNow as you are a Roman, tell me true.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nThen like a Roman bear the truth I tell,\r\nFor certain she is dead, and by strange manner.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhy, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.\r\nWith meditating that she must die once,\r\nI have the patience to endure it now.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nEven so great men great losses should endure.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI have as much of this in art as you,\r\nBut yet my nature could not bear it so.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWell, to our work alive. What do you think\r\nOf marching to Philippi presently?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI do not think it good.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYour reason?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThis it is:\r\n’Tis better that the enemy seek us;\r\nSo shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,\r\nDoing himself offence, whilst we, lying still,\r\nAre full of rest, defence, and nimbleness.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGood reasons must of force give place to better.\r\nThe people ’twixt Philippi and this ground\r\nDo stand but in a forced affection;\r\nFor they have grudg’d us contribution.\r\nThe enemy, marching along by them,\r\nBy them shall make a fuller number up,\r\nCome on refresh’d, new-added, and encourag’d;\r\nFrom which advantage shall we cut him off\r\nIf at Philippi we do face him there,\r\nThese people at our back.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nHear me, good brother.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nUnder your pardon. You must note besides,\r\nThat we have tried the utmost of our friends,\r\nOur legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe.\r\nThe enemy increaseth every day;\r\nWe, at the height, are ready to decline.\r\nThere is a tide in the affairs of men,\r\nWhich, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;\r\nOmitted, all the voyage of their life\r\nIs bound in shallows and in miseries.\r\nOn such a full sea are we now afloat,\r\nAnd we must take the current when it serves,\r\nOr lose our ventures.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThen, with your will, go on:\r\nWe’ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThe deep of night is crept upon our talk,\r\nAnd nature must obey necessity,\r\nWhich we will niggard with a little rest.\r\nThere is no more to say?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nNo more. Good night:\r\nEarly tomorrow will we rise, and hence.\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nLucius! My gown.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Lucius._]\r\n\r\nFarewell now, good Messala.\r\nGood night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,\r\nGood night, and good repose.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nO my dear brother!\r\nThis was an ill beginning of the night.\r\nNever come such division ’tween our souls!\r\nLet it not, Brutus.\r\n\r\nEnter Lucius with the gown.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nEverything is well.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nGood night, my lord.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGood night, good brother.\r\n\r\nTITINIUS and MESSALA.\r\nGood night, Lord Brutus.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nFarewell, everyone.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Cassius, Titinius and Messala._]\r\n\r\nGive me the gown. Where is thy instrument?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nHere in the tent.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhat, thou speak’st drowsily?\r\nPoor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o’er-watch’d.\r\nCall Claudius and some other of my men;\r\nI’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nVarro and Claudius!\r\n\r\nEnter Varro and Claudius.\r\n\r\nVARRO.\r\nCalls my lord?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;\r\nIt may be I shall raise you by-and-by\r\nOn business to my brother Cassius.\r\n\r\nVARRO.\r\nSo please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI will not have it so; lie down, good sirs,\r\nIt may be I shall otherwise bethink me.\r\nLook, Lucius, here’s the book I sought for so;\r\nI put it in the pocket of my gown.\r\n\r\n[_Servants lie down._]\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nI was sure your lordship did not give it me.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nBear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.\r\nCanst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,\r\nAnd touch thy instrument a strain or two?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nAy, my lord, an’t please you.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nIt does, my boy.\r\nI trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nIt is my duty, sir.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nI should not urge thy duty past thy might;\r\nI know young bloods look for a time of rest.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nI have slept, my lord, already.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nIt was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;\r\nI will not hold thee long. If I do live,\r\nI will be good to thee.\r\n\r\n[_Lucius plays and sings till he falls asleep._]\r\n\r\nThis is a sleepy tune. O murd’rous slumber,\r\nLayest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,\r\nThat plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;\r\nI will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.\r\nIf thou dost nod, thou break’st thy instrument;\r\nI’ll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.\r\nLet me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn’d down\r\nWhere I left reading? Here it is, I think.\r\n\r\nEnter the Ghost of Caesar.\r\n\r\nHow ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?\r\nI think it is the weakness of mine eyes\r\nThat shapes this monstrous apparition.\r\nIt comes upon me. Art thou anything?\r\nArt thou some god, some angel, or some devil,\r\nThat mak’st my blood cold and my hair to stare?\r\nSpeak to me what thou art.\r\n\r\nGHOST.\r\nThy evil spirit, Brutus.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhy com’st thou?\r\n\r\nGHOST.\r\nTo tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWell; then I shall see thee again?\r\n\r\nGHOST.\r\nAy, at Philippi.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhy, I will see thee at Philippi then.\r\n\r\n[_Ghost vanishes._]\r\n\r\nNow I have taken heart, thou vanishest.\r\nIll spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.\r\nBoy! Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nThe strings, my lord, are false.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHe thinks he still is at his instrument.\r\nLucius, awake!\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nMy lord?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nDidst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nMy lord, I do not know that I did cry.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?\r\n\r\nLUCIUS.\r\nNothing, my lord.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nSleep again, Lucius.

CLAUDIUS.\r\nDid we, my lord?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAy. Saw you anything?\r\n\r\nVARRO.\r\nNo, my lord, I saw nothing.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIUS.\r\nNor I, my lord.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGo and commend me to my brother Cassius;\r\nBid him set on his powers betimes before,\r\nAnd we will follow.\r\n\r\nVARRO. CLAUDIUS.\r\nIt shall be done, my lord.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT V\r\n\r\nSCENE I. The plains of Philippi.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter Octavius, Antony and their Army.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nNow, Antony, our hopes are answered.\r\nYou said the enemy would not come down,\r\nBut keep the hills and upper regions.\r\nIt proves not so; their battles are at hand,\r\nThey mean to warn us at Philippi here,\r\nAnswering before we do demand of them.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nTut, I am in their bosoms, and I know\r\nWherefore they do it. They could be content\r\nTo visit other places, and come down\r\nWith fearful bravery, thinking by this face\r\nTo fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;\r\nBut ’tis not so.\r\n\r\nEnter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER.\r\nPrepare you, generals.\r\nThe enemy comes on in gallant show;\r\nTheir bloody sign of battle is hung out,\r\nAnd something to be done immediately.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nOctavius, lead your battle softly on\r\nUpon the left hand of the even field.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nUpon the right hand I. Keep thou the left.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nWhy do you cross me in this exigent?\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nI do not cross you; but I will do so.\r\n\r\n[_March._]\r\n\r\nDrum. Enter Brutus, Cassius and their Army; Lucilius, Titinius, Messala\r\nand others.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nThey stand, and would have parley.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nStand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nMark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nNo, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.\r\nMake forth; the generals would have some words.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nStir not until the signal.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWords before blows: is it so, countrymen?\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nNot that we love words better, as you do.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nGood words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nIn your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words;\r\nWitness the hole you made in Caesar’s heart,\r\nCrying, “Long live! Hail, Caesar!”\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nAntony,\r\nThe posture of your blows are yet unknown;\r\nBut for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,\r\nAnd leave them honeyless.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nNot stingless too.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO yes, and soundless too,\r\nFor you have stol’n their buzzing, Antony,\r\nAnd very wisely threat before you sting.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nVillains, you did not so when your vile daggers\r\nHack’d one another in the sides of Caesar:\r\nYou show’d your teeth like apes, and fawn’d like hounds,\r\nAnd bow’d like bondmen, kissing Caesar’s feet;\r\nWhilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind\r\nStruck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nFlatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself.\r\nThis tongue had not offended so today,\r\nIf Cassius might have rul’d.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nCome, come, the cause. If arguing makes us sweat,\r\nThe proof of it will turn to redder drops.\r\nLook, I draw a sword against conspirators.\r\nWhen think you that the sword goes up again?\r\nNever, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds\r\nBe well aveng’d; or till another Caesar\r\nHave added slaughter to the sword of traitors.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nCaesar, thou canst not die by traitors’ hands,\r\nUnless thou bring’st them with thee.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nSo I hope.\r\nI was not born to die on Brutus’ sword.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,\r\nYoung man, thou couldst not die more honourable.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nA peevish school-boy, worthless of such honour,\r\nJoin’d with a masker and a reveller.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nOld Cassius still!\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nCome, Antony; away!\r\nDefiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.\r\nIf you dare fight today, come to the field;\r\nIf not, when you have stomachs.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Octavius, Antony and their Army._]\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhy now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!\r\nThe storm is up, and all is on the hazard.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHo, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nMy lord?\r\n\r\n[_Brutus and Lucilius talk apart._]\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nMessala.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nWhat says my General?\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nMessala,\r\nThis is my birth-day; as this very day\r\nWas Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:\r\nBe thou my witness that against my will\r\nAs Pompey was, am I compell’d to set\r\nUpon one battle all our liberties.\r\nYou know that I held Epicurus strong,\r\nAnd his opinion. Now I change my mind,\r\nAnd partly credit things that do presage.\r\nComing from Sardis, on our former ensign\r\nTwo mighty eagles fell, and there they perch’d,\r\nGorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands,\r\nWho to Philippi here consorted us.\r\nThis morning are they fled away and gone,\r\nAnd in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites\r\nFly o’er our heads, and downward look on us,\r\nAs we were sickly prey: their shadows seem\r\nA canopy most fatal, under which\r\nOur army lies, ready to give up the ghost.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nBelieve not so.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nI but believe it partly,\r\nFor I am fresh of spirit, and resolv’d\r\nTo meet all perils very constantly.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nEven so, Lucilius.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nNow, most noble Brutus,\r\nThe gods today stand friendly, that we may,\r\nLovers in peace, lead on our days to age!\r\nBut, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,\r\nLet’s reason with the worst that may befall.\r\nIf we do lose this battle, then is this\r\nThe very last time we shall speak together:\r\nWhat are you then determined to do?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nEven by the rule of that philosophy\r\nBy which I did blame Cato for the death\r\nWhich he did give himself, I know not how,\r\nBut I do find it cowardly and vile,\r\nFor fear of what might fall, so to prevent\r\nThe time of life, arming myself with patience\r\nTo stay the providence of some high powers\r\nThat govern us below.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThen, if we lose this battle,\r\nYou are contented to be led in triumph\r\nThorough the streets of Rome?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNo, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,\r\nThat ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;\r\nHe bears too great a mind. But this same day\r\nMust end that work the Ides of March begun;\r\nAnd whether we shall meet again I know not.\r\nTherefore our everlasting farewell take.\r\nFor ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius.\r\nIf we do meet again, why, we shall smile;\r\nIf not, why then this parting was well made.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nFor ever and for ever farewell, Brutus.\r\nIf we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed;\r\nIf not, ’tis true this parting was well made.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhy then, lead on. O, that a man might know\r\nThe end of this day’s business ere it come!\r\nBut it sufficeth that the day will end,\r\nAnd then the end is known. Come, ho! away!\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The same. The field of battle.\r\n\r\nAlarum. Enter Brutus and Messala.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nRide, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills\r\nUnto the legions on the other side.\r\n\r\n[_Loud alarum._]\r\n\r\nLet them set on at once; for I perceive\r\nBut cold demeanor in Octavius’ wing,\r\nAnd sudden push gives them the overthrow.\r\nRide, ride, Messala; let them all come down.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Another part of the field.\r\n\r\nAlarum. Enter Cassius and Titinius.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nO, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!\r\nMyself have to mine own turn’d enemy:\r\nThis ensign here of mine was turning back;\r\nI slew the coward, and did take it from him.\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nO Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,\r\nWho, having some advantage on Octavius,\r\nTook it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,\r\nWhilst we by Antony are all enclos’d.\r\n\r\nEnter Pindarus.\r\n\r\nPINDARUS.\r\nFly further off, my lord, fly further off;\r\nMark Antony is in your tents, my lord.\r\nFly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nThis hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;\r\nAre those my tents where I perceive the fire?\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nThey are, my lord.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nTitinius, if thou lovest me,\r\nMount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,\r\nTill he have brought thee up to yonder troops\r\nAnd here again, that I may rest assur’d\r\nWhether yond troops are friend or enemy.\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nI will be here again, even with a thought.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nGo, Pindarus, get higher on that hill,\r\nMy sight was ever thick. Regard Titinius,\r\nAnd tell me what thou notest about the field.\r\n\r\n[_Pindarus goes up._]\r\n\r\nThis day I breathed first. Time is come round,\r\nAnd where I did begin, there shall I end.\r\nMy life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?\r\n\r\nPINDARUS.\r\n[_Above._] O my lord!\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nWhat news?\r\n\r\nPINDARUS.\r\n[_Above._] Titinius is enclosed round about\r\nWith horsemen, that make to him on the spur,\r\nYet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.\r\nNow, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.\r\nHe’s ta’en!\r\n\r\n[_Shout._]\r\n\r\nAnd, hark! they shout for joy.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS.\r\nCome down; behold no more.\r\nO, coward that I am, to live so long,\r\nTo see my best friend ta’en before my face!\r\n\r\n[_Pindarus descends._]\r\n\r\nCome hither, sirrah.\r\nIn Parthia did I take thee prisoner;\r\nAnd then I swore thee, saving of thy life,\r\nThat whatsoever I did bid thee do,\r\nThou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath.\r\nNow be a freeman; and with this good sword,\r\nThat ran through Caesar’s bowels, search this bosom.\r\nStand not to answer. Here, take thou the hilts;\r\nAnd when my face is cover’d, as ’tis now,\r\nGuide thou the sword.—Caesar, thou art reveng’d,\r\nEven with the sword that kill’d thee.\r\n\r\n[_Dies._]\r\n\r\nPINDARUS.\r\nSo, I am free, yet would not so have been,\r\nDurst I have done my will. O Cassius!\r\nFar from this country Pindarus shall run,\r\nWhere never Roman shall take note of him.\r\n\r\n[_Exit._]\r\n\r\nEnter Titinius with Messala.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nIt is but change, Titinius; for Octavius\r\nIs overthrown by noble Brutus’ power,\r\nAs Cassius’ legions are by Antony.\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nThese tidings would well comfort Cassius.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nWhere did you leave him?\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nAll disconsolate,\r\nWith Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nIs not that he that lies upon the ground?\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nHe lies not like the living. O my heart!\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nIs not that he?\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nNo, this was he, Messala,\r\nBut Cassius is no more. O setting sun,\r\nAs in thy red rays thou dost sink to night,\r\nSo in his red blood Cassius’ day is set.\r\nThe sun of Rome is set. Our day is gone;\r\nClouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done.\r\nMistrust of my success hath done this deed.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nMistrust of good success hath done this deed.\r\nO hateful Error, Melancholy’s child!\r\nWhy dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men\r\nThe things that are not? O Error, soon conceiv’d,\r\nThou never com’st unto a happy birth,\r\nBut kill’st the mother that engender’d thee!\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nWhat, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nSeek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet\r\nThe noble Brutus, thrusting this report\r\nInto his ears. I may say thrusting it;\r\nFor piercing steel and darts envenomed\r\nShall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus\r\nAs tidings of this sight.\r\n\r\nTITINIUS.\r\nHie you, Messala,\r\nAnd I will seek for Pindarus the while.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Messala._]\r\n\r\nWhy didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?\r\nDid I not meet thy friends? And did not they\r\nPut on my brows this wreath of victory,\r\nAnd bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?\r\nAlas, thou hast misconstrued everything!\r\nBut, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;\r\nThy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I\r\nWill do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,\r\nAnd see how I regarded Caius Cassius.\r\nBy your leave, gods. This is a Roman’s part.\r\nCome, Cassius’ sword, and find Titinius’ heart.\r\n\r\n[_Dies._]\r\n\r\nAlarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, young Cato, Strato, Volumnius and\r\nLucilius.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhere, where, Messala, doth his body lie?\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nLo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nTitinius’ face is upward.\r\n\r\nCATO.\r\nHe is slain.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nO Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!\r\nThy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords\r\nIn our own proper entrails.\r\n\r\n[_Low alarums._]\r\n\r\nCATO.\r\nBrave Titinius!\r\nLook whether he have not crown’d dead Cassius!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nAre yet two Romans living such as these?\r\nThe last of all the Romans, fare thee well!\r\nIt is impossible that ever Rome\r\nShould breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears\r\nTo this dead man than you shall see me pay.\r\nI shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.\r\nCome therefore, and to Thassos send his body.\r\nHis funerals shall not be in our camp,\r\nLest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;\r\nAnd come, young Cato; let us to the field.\r\nLabeo and Flavius, set our battles on.\r\n’Tis three o’clock; and Romans, yet ere night\r\nWe shall try fortune in a second fight.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. Another part of the field.\r\n\r\nAlarum. Enter fighting soldiers of both armies; then Brutus, Messala,\r\nyoung Cato, Lucilius, Flavius and others.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nYet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!\r\n\r\nCATO.\r\nWhat bastard doth not? Who will go with me?\r\nI will proclaim my name about the field.\r\nI am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!\r\nA foe to tyrants, and my country’s friend.\r\nI am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!\r\n\r\n[_Charges the enemy._]\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nAnd I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;\r\nBrutus, my country’s friend; know me for Brutus!\r\n\r\n[_Exit, charging the enemy. Cato is overpowered, and falls._]\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nO young and noble Cato, art thou down?\r\nWhy, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius,\r\nAnd mayst be honour’d, being Cato’s son.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER.\r\nYield, or thou diest.\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nOnly I yield to die:\r\nThere is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;\r\n\r\n[_Offering money_]\r\n\r\nKill Brutus, and be honour’d in his death.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER.\r\nWe must not. A noble prisoner!\r\n\r\nSECOND SOLDIER.\r\nRoom, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta’en.\r\n\r\nFIRST SOLDIER.\r\nI’ll tell the news. Here comes the General.\r\n\r\nEnter Antony.\r\n\r\nBrutus is ta’en, Brutus is ta’en, my lord.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nWhere is he?\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nSafe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough.\r\nI dare assure thee that no enemy\r\nShall ever take alive the noble Brutus.\r\nThe gods defend him from so great a shame!\r\nWhen you do find him, or alive or dead,\r\nHe will be found like Brutus, like himself.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nThis is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,\r\nA prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,\r\nGive him all kindness. I had rather have\r\nSuch men my friends than enemies. Go on,\r\nAnd see whether Brutus be alive or dead;\r\nAnd bring us word unto Octavius’ tent\r\nHow everything is chanc’d.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. Another part of the field.\r\n\r\nEnter Brutus, Dardanius, Clitus, Strato and Volumnius.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nCome, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.\r\n\r\nCLITUS.\r\nStatilius show’d the torch-light; but, my lord,\r\nHe came not back: he is or ta’en or slain.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nSit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word;\r\nIt is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.\r\n\r\n[_Whispering._]\r\n\r\nCLITUS.\r\nWhat, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nPeace then, no words.\r\n\r\nCLITUS.\r\nI’ll rather kill myself.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHark thee, Dardanius.\r\n\r\n[_Whispers him._]\r\n\r\nDARDANIUS.\r\nShall I do such a deed?\r\n\r\nCLITUS.\r\nO Dardanius!\r\n\r\nDARDANIUS.\r\nO Clitus!\r\n\r\nCLITUS.\r\nWhat ill request did Brutus make to thee?\r\n\r\nDARDANIUS.\r\nTo kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.\r\n\r\nCLITUS.\r\nNow is that noble vessel full of grief,\r\nThat it runs over even at his eyes.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nCome hither, good Volumnius; list a word.\r\n\r\nVOLUMNIUS.\r\nWhat says my lord?\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nWhy, this, Volumnius:\r\nThe ghost of Caesar hath appear’d to me\r\nTwo several times by night; at Sardis once,\r\nAnd this last night here in Philippi fields.\r\nI know my hour is come.\r\n\r\nVOLUMNIUS.\r\nNot so, my lord.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nNay I am sure it is, Volumnius.\r\nThou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;\r\nOur enemies have beat us to the pit.\r\n\r\n[_Low alarums._]\r\n\r\nIt is more worthy to leap in ourselves\r\nThan tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,\r\nThou know’st that we two went to school together;\r\nEven for that our love of old, I pr’ythee\r\nHold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.\r\n\r\nVOLUMNIUS.\r\nThat’s not an office for a friend, my lord.\r\n\r\n[_Alarums still._]\r\n\r\nCLITUS.\r\nFly, fly, my lord! there is no tarrying here.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nFarewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.\r\nStrato, thou hast been all this while asleep;\r\nFarewell to thee too, Strato.—Countrymen,\r\nMy heart doth joy, that yet in all my life\r\nI found no man but he was true to me.\r\nI shall have glory by this losing day\r\nMore than Octavius and Mark Antony\r\nBy this vile conquest shall attain unto.\r\nSo fare you well at once; for Brutus’ tongue\r\nHath almost ended his life’s history.\r\nNight hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,\r\nThat have but labour’d to attain this hour.\r\n\r\n[_Alarums. Cry within, “Fly, fly, fly!”._]\r\n\r\nCLITUS.\r\nFly, my lord, fly!\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nHence! I will follow.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt Clitus, Dardanius and Volumnius._]\r\n\r\nI pr’ythee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.\r\nThou art a fellow of a good respect;\r\nThy life hath had some smatch of honour in it.\r\nHold then my sword, and turn away thy face,\r\nWhile I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?\r\n\r\nSTRATO.\r\nGive me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.\r\n\r\nBRUTUS.\r\nFarewell, good Strato.—Caesar, now be still:\r\nI kill’d not thee with half so good a will.\r\n\r\n[_He runs on his sword, and dies._]\r\n\r\nAlarum. Retreat. Enter Antony, Octavius, Messala, Lucilius and the\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nWhat man is that?\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nMy master’s man. Strato, where is thy master?\r\n\r\nSTRATO.\r\nFree from the bondage you are in, Messala.\r\nThe conquerors can but make a fire of him;\r\nFor Brutus only overcame himself,\r\nAnd no man else hath honour by his death.\r\n\r\nLUCILIUS.\r\nSo Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,\r\nThat thou hast prov’d Lucilius’ saying true.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nAll that serv’d Brutus, I will entertain them.\r\nFellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?\r\n\r\nSTRATO.\r\nAy, if Messala will prefer me to you.\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nDo so, good Messala.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nHow died my master, Strato?\r\n\r\nSTRATO.\r\nI held the sword, and he did run on it.\r\n\r\nMESSALA.\r\nOctavius, then take him to follow thee,\r\nThat did the latest service to my master.\r\n\r\nANTONY.\r\nThis was the noblest Roman of them all.\r\nAll the conspirators save only he,\r\nDid that they did in envy of great Caesar;\r\nHe only, in a general honest thought\r\nAnd common good to all, made one of them.\r\nHis life was gentle, and the elements\r\nSo mix’d in him that Nature might stand up\r\nAnd say to all the world, “This was a man!”\r\n\r\nOCTAVIUS.\r\nAccording to his virtue let us use him\r\nWith all respect and rites of burial.\r\nWithin my tent his bones tonight shall lie,\r\nMost like a soldier, order’d honourably.\r\nSo call the field to rest, and let’s away,\r\nTo part the glories of this happy day.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt._]",
