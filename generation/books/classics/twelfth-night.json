An Apartment in the Duke’s Palace.\r\n\r\n\r\n Enter Orsino, Duke of Illyria, Curio, and other Lords; Musicians\r\n attending.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIf music be the food of love, play on,\r\nGive me excess of it; that, surfeiting,\r\nThe appetite may sicken and so die.\r\nThat strain again, it had a dying fall;\r\nO, it came o’er my ear like the sweet sound\r\nThat breathes upon a bank of violets,\r\nStealing and giving odour. Enough; no more;\r\n’Tis not so sweet now as it was before.\r\nO spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,\r\nThat notwithstanding thy capacity\r\nReceiveth as the sea, nought enters there,\r\nOf what validity and pitch soever,\r\nBut falls into abatement and low price\r\nEven in a minute! So full of shapes is fancy,\r\nThat it alone is high fantastical.\r\n\r\nCURIO.\r\nWill you go hunt, my lord?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat, Curio?\r\n\r\nCURIO.\r\nThe hart.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhy so I do, the noblest that I have.\r\nO, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,\r\nMethought she purg’d the air of pestilence;\r\nThat instant was I turn’d into a hart,\r\nAnd my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,\r\nE’er since pursue me. How now? what news from her?\r\n\r\n Enter Valentine.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nSo please my lord, I might not be admitted,\r\nBut from her handmaid do return this answer:\r\nThe element itself, till seven years’ heat,\r\nShall not behold her face at ample view;\r\nBut like a cloistress she will veiled walk,\r\nAnd water once a day her chamber round\r\nWith eye-offending brine: all this to season\r\nA brother’s dead love, which she would keep fresh\r\nAnd lasting in her sad remembrance.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO, she that hath a heart of that fine frame\r\nTo pay this debt of love but to a brother,\r\nHow will she love, when the rich golden shaft\r\nHath kill’d the flock of all affections else\r\nThat live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,\r\nThese sovereign thrones, are all supplied and fill’d\r\nHer sweet perfections with one self king!\r\nAway before me to sweet beds of flowers,\r\nLove-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The sea-coast.\r\n\r\n Enter Viola, a Captain and Sailors.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWhat country, friends, is this?\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nThis is Illyria, lady.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd what should I do in Illyria?\r\nMy brother he is in Elysium.\r\nPerchance he is not drown’d. What think you, sailors?\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nIt is perchance that you yourself were sav’d.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nO my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nTrue, madam; and to comfort you with chance,\r\nAssure yourself, after our ship did split,\r\nWhen you, and those poor number sav’d with you,\r\nHung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,\r\nMost provident in peril, bind himself,\r\n(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice)\r\nTo a strong mast that liv’d upon the sea;\r\nWhere, like Arion on the dolphin’s back,\r\nI saw him hold acquaintance with the waves\r\nSo long as I could see.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nFor saying so, there’s gold!\r\nMine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,\r\nWhereto thy speech serves for authority,\r\nThe like of him. Know’st thou this country?\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nAy, madam, well, for I was bred and born\r\nNot three hours’ travel from this very place.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWho governs here?\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nA noble duke, in nature as in name.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWhat is his name?\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nOrsino.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nOrsino! I have heard my father name him.\r\nHe was a bachelor then.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nAnd so is now, or was so very late;\r\nFor but a month ago I went from hence,\r\nAnd then ’twas fresh in murmur, (as, you know,\r\nWhat great ones do, the less will prattle of)\r\nThat he did seek the love of fair Olivia.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWhat’s she?\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nA virtuous maid, the daughter of a count\r\nThat died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her\r\nIn the protection of his son, her brother,\r\nWho shortly also died; for whose dear love\r\nThey say, she hath abjur’d the company\r\nAnd sight of men.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nO that I served that lady,\r\nAnd might not be delivered to the world,\r\nTill I had made mine own occasion mellow,\r\nWhat my estate is.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nThat were hard to compass,\r\nBecause she will admit no kind of suit,\r\nNo, not the Duke’s.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThere is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain;\r\nAnd though that nature with a beauteous wall\r\nDoth oft close in pollution, yet of thee\r\nI will believe thou hast a mind that suits\r\nWith this thy fair and outward character.\r\nI pray thee, and I’ll pay thee bounteously,\r\nConceal me what I am, and be my aid\r\nFor such disguise as haply shall become\r\nThe form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke;\r\nThou shalt present me as an eunuch to him.\r\nIt may be worth thy pains; for I can sing,\r\nAnd speak to him in many sorts of music,\r\nThat will allow me very worth his service.\r\nWhat else may hap, to time I will commit;\r\nOnly shape thou thy silence to my wit.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN.\r\nBe you his eunuch and your mute I’ll be;\r\nWhen my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI thank thee. Lead me on.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. A Room in Olivia’s House.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby and Maria.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I\r\nam sure care’s an enemy to life.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nBy my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o’ nights; your cousin,\r\nmy lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, let her except, before excepted.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAy, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nConfine? I’ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good\r\nenough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they be not, let\r\nthem hang themselves in their own straps.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThat quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it\r\nyesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here\r\nto be her wooer.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWho? Sir Andrew Aguecheek?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAy, he.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHe’s as tall a man as any’s in Illyria.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nWhat’s that to th’ purpose?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, he has three thousand ducats a year.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAy, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats. He’s a very fool,\r\nand a prodigal.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nFie, that you’ll say so! he plays o’ the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks\r\nthree or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the\r\ngood gifts of nature.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nHe hath indeed, almost natural: for, besides that he’s a fool, he’s a\r\ngreat quarreller; and, but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay\r\nthe gust he hath in quarrelling, ’tis thought among the prudent he\r\nwould quickly have the gift of a grave.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nBy this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him.\r\nWho are they?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThey that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWith drinking healths to my niece; I’ll drink to her as long as there\r\nis a passage in my throat, and drink in Illyria. He’s a coward and a\r\ncoystril that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o’ the\r\ntoe like a parish top. What, wench! _Castiliano vulgo:_ for here comes\r\nSir Andrew Agueface.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nAGUECHEEK.\r\nSir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nSweet Sir Andrew!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nBless you, fair shrew.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAnd you too, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAccost, Sir Andrew, accost.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWhat’s that?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nMy niece’s chamber-maid.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nGood Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMy name is Mary, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nGood Mistress Mary Accost,—\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nYou mistake, knight: accost is front her, board her, woo her, assail\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nBy my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the\r\nmeaning of accost?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nFare you well, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair\r\nlady, do you think you have fools in hand?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nSir, I have not you by the hand.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nMarry, but you shall have, and here’s my hand.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNow, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to th’ buttery\r\nbar and let it drink.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWherefore, sweetheart? What’s your metaphor?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nIt’s dry, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWhy, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But\r\nwhat’s your jest?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nA dry jest, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAre you full of them?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAy, sir, I have them at my fingers’ ends: marry, now I let go your\r\nhand, I am barren.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Maria._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nO knight, thou lack’st a cup of canary: When did I see thee so put\r\ndown?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNever in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down.\r\nMethinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary\r\nman has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm\r\nto my wit.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nNo question.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd I thought that, I’d forswear it. I’ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n_Pourquoy_, my dear knight?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWhat is _pourquoy?_ Do, or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in\r\nthe tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O, had I\r\nbut followed the arts!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThen hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWhy, would that have mended my hair?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPast question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nBut it becomes me well enough, does’t not?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nExcellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a\r\nhuswife take thee between her legs, and spin it off.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nFaith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby; your niece will not be seen, or if\r\nshe be, it’s four to one she’ll none of me; the Count himself here hard\r\nby woos her.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nShe’ll none o’ the Count; she’ll not match above her degree, neither in\r\nestate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear’t. Tut, there’s life\r\nin’t, man.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI’ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o’ the strangest mind i’ the\r\nworld; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nArt thou good at these kick-shawses, knight?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAs any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my\r\nbetters; and yet I will not compare with an old man.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nFaith, I can cut a caper.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd I can cut the mutton to’t.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in\r\nIllyria.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain\r\nbefore ’em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture?\r\nWhy dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a\r\ncoranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not so much as make\r\nwater but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide\r\nvirtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it\r\nwas formed under the star of a galliard.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAy, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a dam’d-colour’d\r\nstock. Shall we set about some revels?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nTaurus? That’s sides and heart.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nNo, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha, higher: ha,\r\nha, excellent!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. A Room in the Duke’s Palace.\r\n\r\n Enter Valentine and Viola in man’s attire.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nIf the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like\r\nto be much advanced; he hath known you but three days, and already you\r\nare no stranger.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nYou either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call in question\r\nthe continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?\r\n\r\nVALENTINE.\r\nNo, believe me.\r\n\r\n Enter Duke, Curio and Attendants.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI thank you. Here comes the Count.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWho saw Cesario, ho?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nOn your attendance, my lord, here.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nStand you awhile aloof.—Cesario,\r\nThou know’st no less but all; I have unclasp’d\r\nTo thee the book even of my secret soul.\r\nTherefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her,\r\nBe not denied access, stand at her doors,\r\nAnd tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow\r\nTill thou have audience.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nSure, my noble lord,\r\nIf she be so abandon’d to her sorrow\r\nAs it is spoke, she never will admit me.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBe clamorous and leap all civil bounds,\r\nRather than make unprofited return.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nSay I do speak with her, my lord, what then?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO then unfold the passion of my love,\r\nSurprise her with discourse of my dear faith;\r\nIt shall become thee well to act my woes;\r\nShe will attend it better in thy youth,\r\nThan in a nuncio’s of more grave aspect.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI think not so, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nDear lad, believe it;\r\nFor they shall yet belie thy happy years,\r\nThat say thou art a man: Diana’s lip\r\nIs not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe\r\nIs as the maiden’s organ, shrill and sound,\r\nAnd all is semblative a woman’s part.\r\nI know thy constellation is right apt\r\nFor this affair. Some four or five attend him:\r\nAll, if you will; for I myself am best\r\nWhen least in company. Prosper well in this,\r\nAnd thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,\r\nTo call his fortunes thine.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI’ll do my best\r\nTo woo your lady. [_Aside._] Yet, a barful strife!\r\nWhoe’er I woo, myself would be his wife.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. A Room in Olivia’s House.\r\n\r\n Enter Maria and Clown.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNay; either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my lips so\r\nwide as a bristle may enter, in way of thy excuse: my lady will hang\r\nthee for thy absence.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nLet her hang me: he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMake that good.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHe shall see none to fear.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nA good lenten answer. I can tell thee where that saying was born, of I\r\nfear no colours.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhere, good Mistress Mary?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nIn the wars, and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWell, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are fools, let\r\nthem use their talents.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nYet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or to be turned away;\r\nis not that as good as a hanging to you?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMany a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and for turning away, let\r\nsummer bear it out.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nYou are resolute then?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNot so, neither, but I am resolved on two points.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThat if one break, the other will hold; or if both break, your gaskins\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nApt, in good faith, very apt! Well, go thy way; if Sir Toby would leave\r\ndrinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve’s flesh as any in Illyria.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nPeace, you rogue, no more o’ that. Here comes my lady: make your excuse\r\nwisely, you were best.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n Enter Olivia with Malvolio.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWit, and’t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think\r\nthey have thee, do very oft prove fools; and I that am sure I lack\r\nthee, may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? Better a witty\r\nfool than a foolish wit. God bless thee, lady!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nTake the fool away.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nDo you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGo to, y’are a dry fool; I’ll no more of you. Besides, you grow\r\ndishonest.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTwo faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend: for give\r\nthe dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the dishonest man\r\nmend himself, if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let\r\nthe botcher mend him. Anything that’s mended is but patched; virtue\r\nthat transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but\r\npatched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if\r\nit will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so\r\nbeauty’s a flower. The lady bade take away the fool, therefore, I say\r\nagain, take her away.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nSir, I bade them take away you.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMisprision in the highest degree! Lady, _cucullus non facit monachum:_\r\nthat’s as much to say, I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna,\r\ngive me leave to prove you a fool.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nCan you do it?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nDexteriously, good madonna.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nMake your proof.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI must catechize you for it, madonna. Good my mouse of virtue, answer\r\nme.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWell sir, for want of other idleness, I’ll ’bide your proof.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nGood madonna, why mourn’st thou?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGood fool, for my brother’s death.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI think his soul is in hell, madonna.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI know his soul is in heaven, fool.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThe more fool you, madonna, to mourn for your brother’s soul being in\r\nheaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nYes; and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him. Infirmity, that\r\ndecays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nGod send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your\r\nfolly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass\r\nhis word for twopence that you are no fool.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHow say you to that, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal; I saw him\r\nput down the other day with an ordinary fool, that has no more brain\r\nthan a stone. Look you now, he’s out of his guard already; unless you\r\nlaugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagged. I protest I take\r\nthese wise men, that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better than\r\nthe fools’ zanies.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered\r\nappetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to\r\ntake those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There is\r\nno slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no\r\nrailing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNow Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak’st well of fools!\r\n\r\n Enter Maria.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMadam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nFrom the Count Orsino, is it?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nI know not, madam; ’tis a fair young man, and well attended.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWho of my people hold him in delay?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nSir Toby, madam, your kinsman.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nFetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman. Fie on him!\r\n\r\n [_Exit Maria._]\r\n\r\nGo you, Malvolio. If it be a suit from the Count, I am sick, or not at\r\nhome. What you will, to dismiss it.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Malvolio._]\r\n\r\nNow you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike it.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should be a fool:\r\nwhose skull Jove cram with brains, for here he comes, one of thy kin\r\nhas a most weak _pia mater_.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nBy mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA gentleman.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nA gentleman? What gentleman?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n’Tis a gentleman here. A plague o’ these pickle-herrings! How now, sot?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nGood Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nCousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nLechery! I defy lechery. There’s one at the gate.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAy, marry, what is he?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nLet him be the devil an he will, I care not: give me faith, say I.\r\nWell, it’s all one.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat’s a drunken man like, fool?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nLike a drowned man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above heat makes\r\nhim a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGo thou and seek the coroner, and let him sit o’ my coz; for he’s in\r\nthe third degree of drink; he’s drowned. Go, look after him.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHe is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look to the madman.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Clown._]\r\n\r\n Enter Malvolio.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMadam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you\r\nwere sick; he takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes\r\nto speak with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to have a\r\nforeknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What\r\nis to be said to him, lady? He’s fortified against any denial.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nTell him, he shall not speak with me.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nHas been told so; and he says he’ll stand at your door like a sheriff’s\r\npost, and be the supporter of a bench, but he’ll speak with you.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat kind o’ man is he?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nWhy, of mankind.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat manner of man?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nOf very ill manner; he’ll speak with you, will you or no.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nOf what personage and years is he?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nNot yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash\r\nis before ’tis a peascod, or a codling, when ’tis almost an apple. ’Tis\r\nwith him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very\r\nwell-favoured, and he speaks very shrewishly. One would think his\r\nmother’s milk were scarce out of him.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nLet him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nGentlewoman, my lady calls.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n Enter Maria.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGive me my veil; come, throw it o’er my face.\r\nWe’ll once more hear Orsino’s embassy.\r\n\r\n Enter Viola.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThe honourable lady of the house, which is she?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nSpeak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMost radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,—I pray you, tell me if\r\nthis be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to\r\ncast away my speech; for besides that it is excellently well penned, I\r\nhave taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no\r\nscorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhence came you, sir?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI can say little more than I have studied, and that question’s out of\r\nmy part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance, if you be the lady\r\nof the house, that I may proceed in my speech.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAre you a comedian?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNo, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I\r\nam not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nIf I do not usurp myself, I am.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMost certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is yours\r\nto bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission. I\r\nwill on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of\r\nmy message.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nCome to what is important in’t: I forgive you the praise.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAlas, I took great pains to study it, and ’tis poetical.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nIt is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I heard you\r\nwere saucy at my gates; and allowed your approach, rather to wonder at\r\nyou than to hear you. If you be mad, be gone; if you have reason, be\r\nbrief: ’tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a\r\ndialogue.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nWill you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNo, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification\r\nfor your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind. I am a messenger.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nSure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it\r\nis so fearful. Speak your office.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nIt alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no taxation of\r\nhomage; I hold the olive in my hand: my words are as full of peace as\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nYet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThe rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from my\r\nentertainment. What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead:\r\nto your ears, divinity; to any other’s, profanation.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGive us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Maria._]\r\n\r\nNow, sir, what is your text?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMost sweet lady—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nA comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where lies your\r\ntext?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nIn Orsino’s bosom.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nIn his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nTo answer by the method, in the first of his heart.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more to say?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nGood madam, let me see your face.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHave you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? You\r\nare now out of your text: but we will draw the curtain and show you the\r\npicture. [_Unveiling._] Look you, sir, such a one I was this present.\r\nIs’t not well done?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nExcellently done, if God did all.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\n’Tis in grain, sir; ’twill endure wind and weather.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\n’Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white\r\nNature’s own sweet and cunning hand laid on.\r\nLady, you are the cruel’st she alive\r\nIf you will lead these graces to the grave,\r\nAnd leave the world no copy.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules\r\nof my beauty. It shall be inventoried and every particle and utensil\r\nlabelled to my will: as, item, two lips indifferent red; item, two grey\r\neyes with lids to them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were\r\nyou sent hither to praise me?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI see you what you are, you are too proud;\r\nBut, if you were the devil, you are fair.\r\nMy lord and master loves you. O, such love\r\nCould be but recompens’d though you were crown’d\r\nThe nonpareil of beauty!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHow does he love me?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWith adorations, fertile tears,\r\nWith groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nYour lord does know my mind, I cannot love him:\r\nYet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,\r\nOf great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;\r\nIn voices well divulg’d, free, learn’d, and valiant,\r\nAnd in dimension and the shape of nature,\r\nA gracious person. But yet I cannot love him.\r\nHe might have took his answer long ago.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nIf I did love you in my master’s flame,\r\nWith such a suff’ring, such a deadly life,\r\nIn your denial I would find no sense,\r\nI would not understand it.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy, what would you?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMake me a willow cabin at your gate,\r\nAnd call upon my soul within the house;\r\nWrite loyal cantons of contemned love,\r\nAnd sing them loud even in the dead of night;\r\nHallow your name to the reverberate hills,\r\nAnd make the babbling gossip of the air\r\nCry out Olivia! O, you should not rest\r\nBetween the elements of air and earth,\r\nBut you should pity me.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nYou might do much.\r\nWhat is your parentage?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAbove my fortunes, yet my state is well:\r\nI am a gentleman.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGet you to your lord;\r\nI cannot love him: let him send no more,\r\nUnless, perchance, you come to me again,\r\nTo tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:\r\nI thank you for your pains: spend this for me.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI am no fee’d post, lady; keep your purse;\r\nMy master, not myself, lacks recompense.\r\nLove make his heart of flint that you shall love,\r\nAnd let your fervour like my master’s be\r\nPlac’d in contempt. Farewell, fair cruelty.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat is your parentage?\r\n‘Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:\r\nI am a gentleman.’ I’ll be sworn thou art;\r\nThy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit,\r\nDo give thee five-fold blazon. Not too fast: soft, soft!\r\nUnless the master were the man. How now?\r\nEven so quickly may one catch the plague?\r\nMethinks I feel this youth’s perfections\r\nWith an invisible and subtle stealth\r\nTo creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.\r\nWhat ho, Malvolio!\r\n\r\n Enter Malvolio.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nHere, madam, at your service.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nRun after that same peevish messenger\r\nThe County’s man: he left this ring behind him,\r\nWould I or not; tell him, I’ll none of it.\r\nDesire him not to flatter with his lord,\r\nNor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him.\r\nIf that the youth will come this way tomorrow,\r\nI’ll give him reasons for’t. Hie thee, Malvolio.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMadam, I will.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI do I know not what, and fear to find\r\nMine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.\r\nFate, show thy force, ourselves we do not owe.\r\nWhat is decreed must be; and be this so!\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT II.\r\n\r\nSCENE I. The sea-coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n Enter Antonio and Sebastian.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWill you stay no longer? Nor will you not that I go with you?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nBy your patience, no; my stars shine darkly over me; the malignancy of\r\nmy fate might perhaps distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you\r\nyour leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for\r\nyour love, to lay any of them on you.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nLet me know of you whither you are bound.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nNo, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I\r\nperceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty, that you will not\r\nextort from me what I am willing to keep in. Therefore it charges me in\r\nmanners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then,\r\nAntonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo; my father was\r\nthat Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard of. He left\r\nbehind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the heavens\r\nhad been pleased, would we had so ended! But you, sir, altered that,\r\nfor some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my\r\nsister drowned.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nAlas the day!\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nA lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many\r\naccounted beautiful. But though I could not with such estimable wonder\r\noverfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her, she bore\r\na mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir,\r\nwith salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nPardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nO good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nIf you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nIf you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom you\r\nhave recovered, desire it not. Fare ye well at once; my bosom is full\r\nof kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that upon\r\nthe least occasion more, mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to\r\nthe Count Orsino’s court: farewell.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nThe gentleness of all the gods go with thee!\r\nI have many enemies in Orsino’s court,\r\nElse would I very shortly see thee there:\r\nBut come what may, I do adore thee so,\r\nThat danger shall seem sport, and I will go.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A street.\r\n\r\n Enter Viola; Malvolio at several doors.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nWere you not even now with the Countess Olivia?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nEven now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nShe returns this ring to you, sir; you might have saved me my pains, to\r\nhave taken it away yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put\r\nyour lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him. And one\r\nthing more, that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs,\r\nunless it be to report your lord’s taking of this. Receive it so.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nShe took the ring of me: I’ll none of it.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nCome sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is it should be\r\nso returned. If it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if\r\nnot, be it his that finds it.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI left no ring with her; what means this lady?\r\nFortune forbid my outside have not charm’d her!\r\nShe made good view of me, indeed, so much,\r\nThat methought her eyes had lost her tongue,\r\nFor she did speak in starts distractedly.\r\nShe loves me, sure, the cunning of her passion\r\nInvites me in this churlish messenger.\r\nNone of my lord’s ring? Why, he sent her none.\r\nI am the man; if it be so, as ’tis,\r\nPoor lady, she were better love a dream.\r\nDisguise, I see thou art a wickedness\r\nWherein the pregnant enemy does much.\r\nHow easy is it for the proper false\r\nIn women’s waxen hearts to set their forms!\r\nAlas, our frailty is the cause, not we,\r\nFor such as we are made of, such we be.\r\nHow will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,\r\nAnd I, poor monster, fond as much on him,\r\nAnd she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.\r\nWhat will become of this? As I am man,\r\nMy state is desperate for my master’s love;\r\nAs I am woman (now alas the day!)\r\nWhat thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!\r\nO time, thou must untangle this, not I,\r\nIt is too hard a knot for me t’untie!\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. A Room in Olivia’s House.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nApproach, Sir Andrew; not to be abed after midnight, is to be up\r\nbetimes; and _diluculo surgere_, thou know’st.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNay, by my troth, I know not; but I know to be up late is to be up\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA false conclusion; I hate it as an unfilled can. To be up after\r\nmidnight, and to go to bed then is early: so that to go to bed after\r\nmidnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our lives consist of the\r\nfour elements?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nFaith, so they say, but I think it rather consists of eating and\r\ndrinking.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTh’art a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.\r\nMarian, I say! a stoup of wine.\r\n\r\n Enter Clown.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nHere comes the fool, i’ faith.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nHow now, my hearts? Did you never see the picture of “we three”?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWelcome, ass. Now let’s have a catch.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nBy my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had rather than forty\r\nshillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool\r\nhas. In sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night when thou\r\nspok’st of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of\r\nQueubus; ’twas very good, i’ faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman.\r\nHadst it?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio’s nose is no whipstock. My\r\nlady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nExcellent! Why, this is the best fooling, when all is done. Now, a\r\nsong.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome on, there is sixpence for you. Let’s have a song.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nThere’s a testril of me too: if one knight give a—\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWould you have a love-song, or a song of good life?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA love-song, a love-song.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAy, ay. I care not for good life.\r\n\r\nCLOWN. [_sings._]\r\n  _O mistress mine, where are you roaming?\r\n  O stay and hear, your true love’s coming,\r\n    That can sing both high and low.\r\n  Trip no further, pretty sweeting.\r\n  Journeys end in lovers meeting,\r\n    Every wise man’s son doth know._\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nExcellent good, i’ faith.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGood, good.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n  _What is love? ’Tis not hereafter,\r\n  Present mirth hath present laughter.\r\n    What’s to come is still unsure.\r\n  In delay there lies no plenty,\r\n  Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty.\r\n    Youth’s a stuff will not endure._\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nA mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA contagious breath.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nVery sweet and contagious, i’ faith.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTo hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make the\r\nwelkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will\r\ndraw three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do that?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd you love me, let’s do’t: I am dog at a catch.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBy’r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nMost certain. Let our catch be, “Thou knave.”\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n“Hold thy peace, thou knave” knight? I shall be constrain’d in’t to\r\ncall thee knave, knight.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n’Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call me knave. Begin,\r\nfool; it begins “Hold thy peace.”\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI shall never begin if I hold my peace.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nGood, i’ faith! Come, begin.\r\n\r\n [_Catch sung._]\r\n\r\n Enter Maria.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nWhat a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not called up her\r\nsteward Malvolio, and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nMy lady’s a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio’s a Peg-a-Ramsey, and\r\n[_Sings._] _Three merry men be we._ Am not I consanguineous? Am I not\r\nof her blood? Tilly-vally! “Lady”! _There dwelt a man in Babylon, Lady,\r\nLady._\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBeshrew me, the knight’s in admirable fooling.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAy, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do I too; he does it\r\nwith a better grace, but I do it more natural.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[_Sings._] _O’ the twelfth day of December—_\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nFor the love o’ God, peace!\r\n\r\n Enter Malvolio.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMy masters, are you mad? Or what are you? Have you no wit, manners, nor\r\nhonesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make\r\nan ale-house of my lady’s house, that ye squeak out your coziers’\r\ncatches without any mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no respect\r\nof place, persons, nor time, in you?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWe did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you that,\r\nthough she harbours you as her kinsman she’s nothing allied to your\r\ndisorders. If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanours, you are\r\nwelcome to the house; if not, and it would please you to take leave of\r\nher, she is very willing to bid you farewell.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[_Sings._] _Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone._\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNay, good Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n[_Sings._] _His eyes do show his days are almost done._\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nIs’t even so?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[_Sings._] _But I will never die._\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n[_Sings._] _Sir Toby, there you lie._\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nThis is much credit to you.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[_Sings._] _Shall I bid him go?_\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n[_Sings._] _What and if you do?_\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[_Sings._] _Shall I bid him go, and spare not?_\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n[_Sings._] _O, no, no, no, no, you dare not._\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nOut o’ tune? sir, ye lie.

Dost thou think,\r\nbecause thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nYes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i’ the mouth too.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTh’art i’ the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs. A stoup of\r\nwine, Maria!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMistress Mary, if you prized my lady’s favour at anything more than\r\ncontempt, you would not give means for this uncivil rule; she shall\r\nknow of it, by this hand.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nGo shake your ears.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n’Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man’s a-hungry, to challenge\r\nhim the field, and then to break promise with him and make a fool of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nDo’t, knight. I’ll write thee a challenge; or I’ll deliver thy\r\nindignation to him by word of mouth.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nSweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight. Since the youth of the Count’s\r\nwas today with my lady, she is much out of quiet. For Monsieur\r\nMalvolio, let me alone with him. If I do not gull him into a nayword,\r\nand make him a common recreation, do not think I have wit enough to lie\r\nstraight in my bed. I know I can do it.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPossess us, possess us, tell us something of him.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMarry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of Puritan.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nO, if I thought that, I’d beat him like a dog.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat, for being a Puritan? Thy exquisite reason, dear knight?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI have no exquisite reason for’t, but I have reason good enough.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThe devil a Puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a\r\ntime-pleaser, an affectioned ass that cons state without book and\r\nutters it by great swarths; the best persuaded of himself, so crammed\r\n(as he thinks) with excellencies, that it is his grounds of faith that\r\nall that look on him love him. And on that vice in him will my revenge\r\nfind notable cause to work.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat wilt thou do?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nI will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love, wherein by the\r\ncolour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait, the\r\nexpressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself\r\nmost feelingly personated. I can write very like my lady your niece; on\r\na forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nExcellent! I smell a device.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI have’t in my nose too.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHe shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from\r\nmy niece, and that she is in love with him.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMy purpose is indeed a horse of that colour.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd your horse now would make him an ass.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nAss, I doubt not.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nO ’twill be admirable!\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nSport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic will work with him. I will\r\nplant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the\r\nletter. Observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed, and\r\ndream on the event. Farewell.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGood night, Penthesilea.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nBefore me, she’s a good wench.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nShe’s a beagle true bred, and one that adores me. What o’ that?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI was adored once too.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nLet’s to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more money.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nIf I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nSend for money, knight; if thou hast her not i’ th’ end, call me cut.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nIf I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, come, I’ll go burn some sack, ’tis too late to go to bed now.\r\nCome, knight, come, knight.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. A Room in the Duke’s Palace.\r\n\r\n Enter Duke, Viola, Curio and others.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGive me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.\r\nNow, good Cesario, but that piece of song,\r\nThat old and antique song we heard last night;\r\nMethought it did relieve my passion much,\r\nMore than light airs and recollected terms\r\nOf these most brisk and giddy-paced times.\r\nCome, but one verse.\r\n\r\nCURIO.\r\nHe is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWho was it?\r\n\r\nCURIO.\r\nFeste, the jester, my lord, a fool that the Lady Olivia’s father took\r\nmuch delight in. He is about the house.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nSeek him out, and play the tune the while.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Curio. Music plays._]\r\n\r\nCome hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,\r\nIn the sweet pangs of it remember me:\r\nFor such as I am, all true lovers are,\r\nUnstaid and skittish in all motions else,\r\nSave in the constant image of the creature\r\nThat is belov’d. How dost thou like this tune?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nIt gives a very echo to the seat\r\nWhere love is throned.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThou dost speak masterly.\r\nMy life upon’t, young though thou art, thine eye\r\nHath stayed upon some favour that it loves.\r\nHath it not, boy?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nA little, by your favour.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat kind of woman is’t?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nOf your complexion.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nShe is not worth thee, then. What years, i’ faith?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAbout your years, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nToo old, by heaven! Let still the woman take\r\nAn elder than herself; so wears she to him,\r\nSo sways she level in her husband’s heart.\r\nFor, boy, however we do praise ourselves,\r\nOur fancies are more giddy and unfirm,\r\nMore longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,\r\nThan women’s are.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI think it well, my lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThen let thy love be younger than thyself,\r\nOr thy affection cannot hold the bent:\r\nFor women are as roses, whose fair flower\r\nBeing once display’d, doth fall that very hour.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd so they are: alas, that they are so;\r\nTo die, even when they to perfection grow!\r\n\r\n Enter Curio and Clown.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO, fellow, come, the song we had last night.\r\nMark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;\r\nThe spinsters and the knitters in the sun,\r\nAnd the free maids, that weave their thread with bones\r\nDo use to chant it: it is silly sooth,\r\nAnd dallies with the innocence of love\r\nLike the old age.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAre you ready, sir?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAy; prithee, sing.\r\n\r\n [_Music._]\r\n\r\n The Clown’s song.\r\n\r\n_    Come away, come away, death.\r\n    And in sad cypress let me be laid.\r\n    Fly away, fly away, breath;\r\n    I am slain by a fair cruel maid.\r\n       My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,\r\n         O, prepare it!\r\n       My part of death no one so true\r\n         Did share it._\r\n\r\n_    Not a flower, not a flower sweet,\r\n    On my black coffin let there be strown:\r\n    Not a friend, not a friend greet\r\n    My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown:\r\n       A thousand thousand sighs to save,\r\n         Lay me, O, where\r\n       Sad true lover never find my grave,\r\n         To weep there._\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThere’s for thy pains.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI’ll pay thy pleasure, then.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTruly sir, and pleasure will be paid one time or another.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGive me now leave to leave thee.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNow the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make thy doublet of\r\nchangeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of\r\nsuch constancy put to sea, that their business might be everything, and\r\ntheir intent everywhere, for that’s it that always makes a good voyage\r\nof nothing. Farewell.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Clown._]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nLet all the rest give place.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Curio and Attendants._]\r\n\r\nOnce more, Cesario,\r\nGet thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.\r\nTell her my love, more noble than the world,\r\nPrizes not quantity of dirty lands;\r\nThe parts that fortune hath bestow’d upon her,\r\nTell her I hold as giddily as fortune;\r\nBut ’tis that miracle and queen of gems\r\nThat nature pranks her in attracts my soul.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nBut if she cannot love you, sir?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI cannot be so answer’d.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nSooth, but you must.\r\nSay that some lady, as perhaps there is,\r\nHath for your love as great a pang of heart\r\nAs you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;\r\nYou tell her so. Must she not then be answer’d?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThere is no woman’s sides\r\nCan bide the beating of so strong a passion\r\nAs love doth give my heart: no woman’s heart\r\nSo big, to hold so much; they lack retention.\r\nAlas, their love may be called appetite,\r\nNo motion of the liver, but the palate,\r\nThat suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;\r\nBut mine is all as hungry as the sea,\r\nAnd can digest as much. Make no compare\r\nBetween that love a woman can bear me\r\nAnd that I owe Olivia.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAy, but I know—\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat dost thou know?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nToo well what love women to men may owe.\r\nIn faith, they are as true of heart as we.\r\nMy father had a daughter loved a man,\r\nAs it might be perhaps, were I a woman,\r\nI should your lordship.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAnd what’s her history?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nA blank, my lord. She never told her love,\r\nBut let concealment, like a worm i’ th’ bud,\r\nFeed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,\r\nAnd with a green and yellow melancholy\r\nShe sat like patience on a monument,\r\nSmiling at grief. Was not this love, indeed?\r\nWe men may say more, swear more, but indeed,\r\nOur shows are more than will; for still we prove\r\nMuch in our vows, but little in our love.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBut died thy sister of her love, my boy?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI am all the daughters of my father’s house,\r\nAnd all the brothers too: and yet I know not.\r\nSir, shall I to this lady?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nAy, that’s the theme.\r\nTo her in haste. Give her this jewel; say\r\nMy love can give no place, bide no denay.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. Olivia’s garden.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome thy ways, Signior Fabian.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNay, I’ll come. If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to\r\ndeath with melancholy.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter\r\ncome by some notable shame?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nI would exult, man. You know he brought me out o’ favour with my lady\r\nabout a bear-baiting here.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTo anger him we’ll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and\r\nblue, shall we not, Sir Andrew?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd we do not, it is pity of our lives.\r\n\r\n Enter Maria.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHere comes the little villain. How now, my metal of India?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nGet ye all three into the box-tree. Malvolio’s coming down this walk;\r\nhe has been yonder i’ the sun practising behaviour to his own shadow\r\nthis half hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I know this\r\nletter will make a contemplative idiot of him. Close, in the name of\r\njesting! [_The men hide themselves._] Lie thou there; [_Throws down a\r\nletter_] for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Maria._]\r\n\r\n Enter Malvolio.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n’Tis but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once told me she did affect me,\r\nand I have heard herself come thus near, that should she fancy, it\r\nshould be one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more\r\nexalted respect than anyone else that follows her. What should I think\r\non’t?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHere’s an overweening rogue!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him; how he jets\r\nunder his advanced plumes!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n’Slight, I could so beat the rogue!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPeace, I say.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nTo be Count Malvolio.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAh, rogue!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nPistol him, pistol him.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPeace, peace.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nThere is example for’t. The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of\r\nthe wardrobe.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nFie on him, Jezebel!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO, peace! now he’s deeply in; look how imagination blows him.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nHaving been three months married to her, sitting in my state—\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nO for a stone-bow to hit him in the eye!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nCalling my officers about me, in my branched velvet gown; having come\r\nfrom a day-bed, where I have left Olivia sleeping.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nFire and brimstone!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO, peace, peace.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAnd then to have the humour of state; and after a demure travel of\r\nregard, telling them I know my place as I would they should do theirs,\r\nto ask for my kinsman Toby.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nBolts and shackles!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO, peace, peace, peace! Now, now.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSeven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him. I frown\r\nthe while, and perchance wind up my watch, or play with some rich\r\njewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me—\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nShall this fellow live?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThough our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar smile with an\r\naustere regard of control—\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd does not Toby take you a blow o’ the lips then?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSaying ‘Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your niece, give me\r\nthis prerogative of speech—’\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat, what?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘You must amend your drunkenness.’\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nOut, scab!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight—’\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nThat’s me, I warrant you.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘One Sir Andrew.’\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI knew ’twas I, for many do call me fool.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n[_Taking up the letter._] What employment have we here?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNow is the woodcock near the gin.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nO, peace! And the spirit of humours intimate reading aloud to him!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nBy my life, this is my lady’s hand: these be her very C’s, her U’s, and\r\nher T’s, and thus makes she her great P’s. It is in contempt of\r\nquestion, her hand.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nHer C’s, her U’s, and her T’s. Why that?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n[_Reads._] _To the unknown beloved, this, and my good wishes._ Her very\r\nphrases! By your leave, wax. Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with\r\nwhich she uses to seal: ’tis my lady. To whom should this be?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThis wins him, liver and all.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n[_Reads._]\r\n_    Jove knows I love,\r\n    But who?\r\n    Lips, do not move,\r\n    No man must know._\r\n\r\n‘No man must know.’ What follows?

Why, this is evident to any formal capacity. There is\r\nno obstruction in this. And the end—what should that alphabetical\r\nposition portend? If I could make that resemble something in me!\r\nSoftly! ‘M.O.A.I.’—\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nO, ay, make up that:—he is now at a cold scent.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nSowter will cry upon’t for all this, though it be as rank as a fox.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘M’—Malvolio; ‘M!’ Why, that begins my name!\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nDid not I say he would work it out? The cur is excellent at faults.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘M’—But then there is no consonancy in the sequel; that suffers under\r\nprobation: ‘A’ should follow, but ‘O’ does.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nAnd ‘O’ shall end, I hope.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAy, or I’ll cudgel him, and make him cry ‘O!’\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAnd then ‘I’ comes behind.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nAy, and you had any eye behind you, you might see more detraction at\r\nyour heels than fortunes before you.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘M.O.A.I.’ This simulation is not as the former: and yet, to crush this\r\na little, it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in my\r\nname. Soft, here follows prose.\r\n[_Reads._] _If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above\r\nthee, but be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve\r\ngreatness, and some have greatness thrust upon ’em. Thy fates open\r\ntheir hands, let thy blood and spirit embrace them. And, to inure\r\nthyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough and appear\r\nfresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants. Let thy tongue\r\ntang arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity. She\r\nthus advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy\r\nyellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered. I say,\r\nremember. Go to, thou art made, if thou desir’st to be so. If not, let\r\nme see thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy to\r\ntouch Fortune’s fingers. Farewell.

I do not\r\nnow fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for every reason excites\r\nto this, that my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of\r\nlate, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered, and in this she\r\nmanifests herself to my love, and with a kind of injunction, drives me\r\nto these habits of her liking. I thank my stars, I am happy. I will be\r\nstrange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the\r\nswiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised!—Here is yet a\r\npostscript. [_Reads._] _Thou canst not choose but know who I am.

Dost thou live by thy tabor?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo, sir, I live by the church.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nArt thou a churchman?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo such matter, sir. I do live by the church, for I do live at my\r\nhouse, and my house doth stand by the church.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nSo thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar dwell near\r\nhim; or the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nYou have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a chev’ril glove\r\nto a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNay, that’s certain; they that dally nicely with words may quickly make\r\nthem wanton.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWhy, man?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhy, sir, her name’s a word; and to dally with that word might make my\r\nsister wanton. But indeed, words are very rascals, since bonds\r\ndisgraced them.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThy reason, man?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTroth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so\r\nfalse, I am loath to prove reason with them.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI warrant thou art a merry fellow, and car’st for nothing.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNot so, sir, I do care for something. But in my conscience, sir, I do\r\nnot care for you. If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would\r\nmake you invisible.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nArt not thou the Lady Olivia’s fool?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly. She will keep no fool,\r\nsir, till she be married, and fools are as like husbands as pilchards\r\nare to herrings, the husband’s the bigger. I am indeed not her fool,\r\nbut her corrupter of words.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI saw thee late at the Count Orsino’s.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nFoolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun; it shines\r\neverywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with\r\nyour master as with my mistress. I think I saw your wisdom there.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNay, and thou pass upon me, I’ll no more with thee. Hold, there’s\r\nexpenses for thee.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNow Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nBy my troth, I’ll tell thee, I am almost sick for one, though I would\r\nnot have it grow on my chin.

My lady is within, sir. I will conster to them whence you\r\ncome; who you are and what you would are out of my welkin. I might say\r\n“element”, but the word is overworn.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThis fellow is wise enough to play the fool,\r\nAnd to do that well, craves a kind of wit:\r\nHe must observe their mood on whom he jests,\r\nThe quality of persons, and the time,\r\nAnd like the haggard, check at every feather\r\nThat comes before his eye. This is a practice\r\nAs full of labour as a wise man’s art:\r\nFor folly, that he wisely shows, is fit;\r\nBut wise men, folly-fall’n, quite taint their wit.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nSave you, gentleman.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd you, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n_Dieu vous garde, monsieur._\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\n_Et vous aussi; votre serviteur._\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWill you encounter the house? My niece is desirous you should enter, if\r\nyour trade be to her.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI am bound to your niece, sir, I mean, she is the list of my voyage.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTaste your legs, sir, put them to motion.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMy legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what you mean\r\nby bidding me taste my legs.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI mean, to go, sir, to enter.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI will answer you with gait and entrance: but we are prevented.\r\n\r\n Enter Olivia and Maria.\r\n\r\nMost excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain odours on you!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nThat youth’s a rare courtier. ‘Rain odours,’ well.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMy matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and\r\nvouchsafed ear.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n‘Odours,’ ‘pregnant,’ and ‘vouchsafed.’—I’ll get ’em all three ready.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nLet the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Maria._]\r\n\r\nGive me your hand, sir.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMy duty, madam, and most humble service.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat is your name?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nCesario is your servant’s name, fair princess.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nMy servant, sir! ’Twas never merry world,\r\nSince lowly feigning was call’d compliment:\r\nY’are servant to the Count Orsino, youth.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd he is yours, and his must needs be yours.\r\nYour servant’s servant is your servant, madam.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nFor him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,\r\nWould they were blanks rather than fill’d with me!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMadam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts\r\nOn his behalf.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, by your leave, I pray you.\r\nI bade you never speak again of him.\r\nBut would you undertake another suit,\r\nI had rather hear you to solicit that\r\nThan music from the spheres.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nDear lady—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGive me leave, beseech you. I did send,\r\nAfter the last enchantment you did here,\r\nA ring in chase of you. So did I abuse\r\nMyself, my servant, and, I fear me, you.\r\nUnder your hard construction must I sit;\r\nTo force that on you in a shameful cunning,\r\nWhich you knew none of yours. What might you think?\r\nHave you not set mine honour at the stake,\r\nAnd baited it with all th’ unmuzzled thoughts\r\nThat tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving\r\nEnough is shown. A cypress, not a bosom,\r\nHides my heart: so let me hear you speak.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI pity you.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nThat’s a degree to love.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNo, not a grize; for ’tis a vulgar proof\r\nThat very oft we pity enemies.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy then methinks ’tis time to smile again.\r\nO world, how apt the poor are to be proud!\r\nIf one should be a prey, how much the better\r\nTo fall before the lion than the wolf! [_Clock strikes._]\r\nThe clock upbraids me with the waste of time.\r\nBe not afraid, good youth, I will not have you.\r\nAnd yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,\r\nYour wife is like to reap a proper man.\r\nThere lies your way, due west.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThen westward ho!\r\nGrace and good disposition attend your ladyship!\r\nYou’ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nStay:\r\nI prithee tell me what thou think’st of me.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThat you do think you are not what you are.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nIf I think so, I think the same of you.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThen think you right; I am not what I am.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI would you were as I would have you be.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWould it be better, madam, than I am?\r\nI wish it might, for now I am your fool.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO what a deal of scorn looks beautiful\r\nIn the contempt and anger of his lip!\r\nA murd’rous guilt shows not itself more soon\r\nThan love that would seem hid. Love’s night is noon.\r\nCesario, by the roses of the spring,\r\nBy maidhood, honour, truth, and everything,\r\nI love thee so, that maugre all thy pride,\r\nNor wit nor reason can my passion hide.\r\nDo not extort thy reasons from this clause,\r\nFor that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;\r\nBut rather reason thus with reason fetter:\r\nLove sought is good, but given unsought is better.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nBy innocence I swear, and by my youth,\r\nI have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,\r\nAnd that no woman has; nor never none\r\nShall mistress be of it, save I alone.\r\nAnd so adieu, good madam; never more\r\nWill I my master’s tears to you deplore.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nYet come again: for thou perhaps mayst move\r\nThat heart, which now abhors, to like his love.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A Room in Olivia’s House.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNo, faith, I’ll not stay a jot longer.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nYou must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nMarry, I saw your niece do more favours to the Count’s servingman than\r\never she bestowed upon me; I saw’t i’ th’ orchard.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nDid she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAs plain as I see you now.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThis was a great argument of love in her toward you.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n’Slight! will you make an ass o’ me?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nI will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nShe did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you,\r\nto awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart and brimstone\r\nin your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some\r\nexcellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the\r\nyouth into dumbness. This was looked for at your hand, and this was\r\nbalked: the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and\r\nyou are now sailed into the north of my lady’s opinion; where you will\r\nhang like an icicle on Dutchman’s beard, unless you do redeem it by\r\nsome laudable attempt, either of valour or policy.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd’t be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I hate; I had as\r\nlief be a Brownist as a politician.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour. Challenge me\r\nthe Count’s youth to fight with him. Hurt him in eleven places; my\r\nniece shall take note of it, and assure thyself there is no love-broker\r\nin the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than\r\nreport of valour.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThere is no way but this, Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWill either of you bear me a challenge to him?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGo, write it in a martial hand, be curst and brief; it is no matter how\r\nwitty, so it be eloquent and full of invention. Taunt him with the\r\nlicence of ink. If thou ‘thou’st’ him some thrice, it shall not be\r\namiss, and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the\r\nsheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set ’em down. Go\r\nabout it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a\r\ngoose-pen, no matter. About it.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nWhere shall I find you?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWe’ll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Sir Andrew._]\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThis is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nWe shall have a rare letter from him; but you’ll not deliver it.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nNever trust me then. And by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I\r\nthink oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he\r\nwere opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the\r\nfoot of a flea, I’ll eat the rest of th’ anatomy.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nAnd his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of\r\ncruelty.\r\n\r\n Enter Maria.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nLook where the youngest wren of nine comes.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nIf you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches,\r\nfollow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado; for\r\nthere is no Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can\r\never believe such impossible passages of grossness. He’s in yellow\r\nstockings.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAnd cross-gartered?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMost villainously; like a pedant that keeps a school i’ th’ church. I\r\nhave dogged him like his murderer. He does obey every point of the\r\nletter that I dropped to betray him. He does smile his face into more\r\nlines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You\r\nhave not seen such a thing as ’tis. I  can hardly forbear hurling\r\nthings at him. I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he’ll smile\r\nand take’t for a great favour.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, bring us, bring us where he is.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. A street.\r\n\r\n Enter Sebastian and Antonio.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI would not by my will have troubled you,\r\nBut since you make your pleasure of your pains,\r\nI will no further chide you.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI could not stay behind you: my desire,\r\nMore sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;\r\nAnd not all love to see you, though so much,\r\nAs might have drawn one to a longer voyage,\r\nBut jealousy what might befall your travel,\r\nBeing skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,\r\nUnguided and unfriended, often prove\r\nRough and unhospitable. My willing love,\r\nThe rather by these arguments of fear,\r\nSet forth in your pursuit.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nMy kind Antonio,\r\nI can no other answer make but thanks,\r\nAnd thanks, and ever thanks; and oft good turns\r\nAre shuffled off with such uncurrent pay.\r\nBut were my worth, as is my conscience, firm,\r\nYou should find better dealing. What’s to do?\r\nShall we go see the relics of this town?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nTomorrow, sir; best first go see your lodging.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI am not weary, and ’tis long to night;\r\nI pray you, let us satisfy our eyes\r\nWith the memorials and the things of fame\r\nThat do renown this city.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWould you’d pardon me.\r\nI do not without danger walk these streets.\r\nOnce in a sea-fight, ’gainst the Count his galleys,\r\nI did some service, of such note indeed,\r\nThat were I ta’en here, it would scarce be answer’d.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nBelike you slew great number of his people.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nTh’ offence is not of such a bloody nature,\r\nAlbeit the quality of the time and quarrel\r\nMight well have given us bloody argument.\r\nIt might have since been answered in repaying\r\nWhat we took from them, which for traffic’s sake,\r\nMost of our city did. Only myself stood out,\r\nFor which, if I be lapsed in this place,\r\nI shall pay dear.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nDo not then walk too open.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nIt doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here’s my purse.\r\nIn the south suburbs, at the Elephant,\r\nIs best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet\r\nWhiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge\r\nWith viewing of the town. There shall you have me.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhy I your purse?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHaply your eye shall light upon some toy\r\nYou have desire to purchase; and your store,\r\nI think, is not for idle markets, sir.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI’ll be your purse-bearer, and leave you for an hour.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nTo th’ Elephant.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI do remember.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. Olivia’s garden.\r\n\r\n Enter Olivia and Maria.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI have sent after him. He says he’ll come;\r\nHow shall I feast him? What bestow of him?\r\nFor youth is bought more oft than begg’d or borrow’d.\r\nI speak too loud.—\r\nWhere’s Malvolio?—He is sad and civil,\r\nAnd suits well for a servant with my fortunes;\r\nWhere is Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nHe’s coming, madam:\r\nBut in very strange manner. He is sure possessed, madam.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy, what’s the matter? Does he rave?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNo, madam, he does nothing but smile: your ladyship were best to have\r\nsome guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in ’s\r\nwits.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGo call him hither. I’m as mad as he,\r\nIf sad and merry madness equal be.\r\n\r\n Enter Malvolio.\r\n\r\nHow now, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSweet lady, ho, ho!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nSmil’st thou? I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSad, lady? I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the\r\nblood, this cross-gartering. But what of that? If it please the eye of\r\none, it is with me as the very true sonnet is: ‘Please one and please\r\nall.’\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nNot black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his\r\nhands, and commands shall be executed. I think we do know the sweet\r\nRoman hand.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nTo bed? Ay, sweetheart, and I’ll come to thee.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGod comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thy hand so oft?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nHow do you, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAt your request? Yes, nightingales answer daws!\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nWhy appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘Be not afraid of greatness.’ ’Twas well writ.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat mean’st thou by that, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘Some are born great’—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHa?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘Some achieve greatness’—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat say’st thou?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘And some have greatness thrust upon them.’\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHeaven restore thee!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘Remember who commended thy yellow stockings’—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nThy yellow stockings?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘And wished to see thee cross-gartered.’\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nCross-gartered?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘Go to: thou art made, if thou desir’st to be so:’—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAm I made?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\n‘If not, let me see thee a servant still.’\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhy, this is very midsummer madness.\r\n\r\n Enter Servant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nMadam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino’s is returned; I could\r\nhardly entreat him back. He attends your ladyship’s pleasure.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI’ll come to him.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nGood Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where’s my cousin Toby? Let\r\nsome of my people have a special care of him; I would not have him\r\nmiscarry for the half of my dowry.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Olivia and Maria._]\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nO ho, do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to\r\nme. This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose,\r\nthat I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the\r\nletter. ‘Cast thy humble slough,’ says she; ‘be opposite with a\r\nkinsman, surly with servants, let thy tongue tang with arguments of\r\nstate, put thyself into the trick of singularity,’ and consequently,\r\nsets down the manner how: as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow\r\ntongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have limed\r\nher, but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she\r\nwent away now, ‘Let this fellow be looked to;’ ‘Fellow!’ not\r\n‘Malvolio’, nor after my degree, but ‘fellow’. Why, everything adheres\r\ntogether, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no\r\nobstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance. What can be said?\r\nNothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my\r\nhopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby, Fabian and Maria.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhich way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils of hell be\r\ndrawn in little, and Legion himself possessed him, yet I’ll speak to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nHere he is, here he is. How is’t with you, sir? How is’t with you, man?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nGo off, I discard you. Let me enjoy my private. Go off.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nLo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! Did not I tell you? Sir\r\nToby, my lady prays you to have a care of him.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAh, ha! does she so?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGo to, go to; peace, peace, we must deal gently with him. Let me alone.\r\nHow do you, Malvolio? How is’t with you? What, man! defy the devil!\r\nConsider, he’s an enemy to mankind.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nDo you know what you say?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nLa you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart! Pray\r\nGod he be not bewitched.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nCarry his water to th’ wise woman.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nMarry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning, if I live. My lady would\r\nnot lose him for more than I’ll say.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nHow now, mistress!\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nO Lord!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nPrithee hold thy peace, this is not the way. Do you not see you move\r\nhim? Let me alone with him.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNo way but gentleness, gently, gently. The fiend is rough, and will not\r\nbe roughly used.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, how now, my bawcock? How dost thou, chuck?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAy, biddy, come with me. What, man, ’tis not for gravity to play at\r\ncherry-pit with Satan. Hang him, foul collier!\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nGet him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMy prayers, minx?\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNo, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nGo, hang yourselves all! You are idle, shallow things. I am not of your\r\nelement. You shall know more hereafter.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nIs’t possible?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nIf this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an\r\nimprobable fiction.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHis very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nWhy, we shall make him mad indeed.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThe house will be the quieter.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, we’ll have him in a dark room and bound. My niece is already in\r\nthe belief that he’s mad. We may carry it thus for our pleasure, and\r\nhis penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt us to\r\nhave mercy on him, at which time we will bring the device to the bar,\r\nand crown thee for a finder of madmen. But see, but see!\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nMore matter for a May morning.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nHere’s the challenge, read it. I warrant there’s vinegar and pepper\r\nin’t.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nIs’t so saucy?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAy, is’t, I warrant him. Do but read.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGive me. [_Reads._] _Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy\r\nfellow._\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nGood, and valiant.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n_Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call thee so, for I\r\nwill show thee no reason for’t._\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nA good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n_Thou comest to the Lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses thee kindly:\r\nbut thou liest in thy throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee\r\nfor._\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nVery brief, and to exceeding good sense—less.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n_I will waylay thee going home; where if it be thy chance to kill me—_\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nGood.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n_Thou kill’st me like a rogue and a villain._\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nStill you keep o’ th’ windy side of the law. Good.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n_Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon one of our souls! He may have\r\nmercy upon mine, but my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy\r\nfriend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,\r\n                        Andrew Aguecheek._\r\nIf this letter move him not, his legs cannot. I’ll give’t him.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nYou may have very fit occasion for’t. He is now in some commerce with\r\nmy lady, and will by and by depart.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGo, Sir Andrew. Scout me for him at the corner of the orchard, like a\r\nbum-baily. So soon as ever thou seest him, draw, and as thou draw’st,\r\nswear horrible, for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a\r\nswaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood more approbation\r\nthan ever proof itself would have earned him. Away.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNay, let me alone for swearing.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nNow will not I deliver his letter, for the behaviour of the young\r\ngentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his\r\nemployment between his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore\r\nthis letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the\r\nyouth. He will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver\r\nhis challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek notable report of\r\nvalour, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive\r\nit) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and\r\nimpetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one\r\nanother by the look, like cockatrices.\r\n\r\n Enter Olivia and Viola.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nHere he comes with your niece; give them way till he take leave, and\r\npresently after him.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Fabian and Maria._]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nI have said too much unto a heart of stone,\r\nAnd laid mine honour too unchary on’t:\r\nThere’s something in me that reproves my fault:\r\nBut such a headstrong potent fault it is,\r\nThat it but mocks reproof.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWith the same ’haviour that your passion bears\r\nGoes on my master’s griefs.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHere, wear this jewel for me, ’tis my picture.\r\nRefuse it not, it hath no tongue to vex you.\r\nAnd I beseech you come again tomorrow.\r\nWhat shall you ask of me that I’ll deny,\r\nThat honour sav’d, may upon asking give?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNothing but this, your true love for my master.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHow with mine honour may I give him that\r\nWhich I have given to you?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI will acquit you.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWell, come again tomorrow. Fare thee well;\r\nA fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby and Fabian.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nGentleman, God save thee.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd you, sir.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThat defence thou hast, betake thee to’t. Of what nature the wrongs are\r\nthou hast done him, I know not, but thy intercepter, full of despite,\r\nbloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount thy\r\ntuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful,\r\nand deadly.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nYou mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me. My\r\nremembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to\r\nany man.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nYou’ll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore, if you hold your\r\nlife at any price, betake you to your guard, for your opposite hath in\r\nhim what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can furnish man withal.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI pray you, sir, what is he?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHe is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier, and on carpet\r\nconsideration, but he is a devil in private brawl. Souls and bodies\r\nhath he divorced three, and his incensement at this moment is so\r\nimplacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and\r\nsepulchre. Hob, nob is his word; give’t or take’t.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady.\r\nI am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels\r\npurposely on others to taste their valour: belike this is a man of that\r\nquirk.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nSir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury;\r\ntherefore, get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to\r\nthe house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety\r\nyou might answer him. Therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked,\r\nfor meddle you must, that’s certain, or forswear to wear iron about\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThis is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this courteous\r\noffice, as to know of the knight what my offence to him is. It is\r\nsomething of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Sir Toby._]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nPray you, sir, do you know of this matter?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nI know the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal\r\narbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI beseech you, what manner of man is he?\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are\r\nlike to find him in the proof of his valour. He is indeed, sir, the\r\nmost skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have\r\nfound in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make\r\nyour peace with him if I can.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI shall be much bound to you for’t. I am one that had rather go with\r\nsir priest than sir knight: I care not who knows so much of my mettle.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhy, man, he’s a very devil. I have not seen such a firago. I had a\r\npass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck-in\r\nwith such a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he\r\npays you as surely as your feet hits the ground they step on. They say\r\nhe has been fencer to the Sophy.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nPox on’t, I’ll not meddle with him.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nAy, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nPlague on’t, an I thought he had been valiant, and so cunning in fence,\r\nI’d have seen him damned ere I’d have challenged him. Let him let the\r\nmatter slip, and I’ll give him my horse, grey Capilet.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI’ll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on’t. This shall end\r\nwithout the perdition of souls. [_Aside._] Marry, I’ll ride your horse\r\nas well as I ride you.\r\n\r\n Enter Fabian and Viola.\r\n\r\n[_To Fabian._] I have his horse to take up the quarrel. I have\r\npersuaded him the youth’s a devil.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nHe is as horribly conceited of him, and pants and looks pale, as if a\r\nbear were at his heels.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThere’s no remedy, sir, he will fight with you for’s oath sake. Marry,\r\nhe hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now\r\nscarce to be worth talking of. Therefore, draw for the supportance of\r\nhis vow; he protests he will not hurt you.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\n[_Aside._] Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell them\r\nhow much I lack of a man.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nGive ground if you see him furious.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy, the gentleman will for his\r\nhonour’s sake have one bout with you. He cannot by the duello avoid it;\r\nbut he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not\r\nhurt you. Come on: to’t.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n[_Draws._] Pray God he keep his oath!\r\n\r\n Enter Antonio.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\n[_Draws._] I do assure you ’tis against my will.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nPut up your sword. If this young gentleman\r\nHave done offence, I take the fault on me.\r\nIf you offend him, I for him defy you.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nYou, sir? Why, what are you?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\n[_Draws._] One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more\r\nThan you have heard him brag to you he will.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[_Draws._] Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.\r\n\r\n Enter Officers.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nO good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\n[_To Antonio._] I’ll be with you anon.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\n[_To Sir Andrew._] Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nMarry, will I, sir; and for that I promised you, I’ll be as good as my\r\nword. He will bear you easily, and reins well.\r\n\r\nFIRST OFFICER.\r\nThis is the man; do thy office.\r\n\r\nSECOND OFFICER.\r\nAntonio, I arrest thee at the suit\r\nOf Count Orsino.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nYou do mistake me, sir.\r\n\r\nFIRST OFFICER.\r\nNo, sir, no jot. I know your favour well,\r\nThough now you have no sea-cap on your head.—\r\nTake him away, he knows I know him well.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI must obey. This comes with seeking you;\r\nBut there’s no remedy, I shall answer it.\r\nWhat will you do? Now my necessity\r\nMakes me to ask you for my purse. It grieves me\r\nMuch more for what I cannot do for you,\r\nThan what befalls myself. You stand amaz’d,\r\nBut be of comfort.\r\n\r\nSECOND OFFICER.\r\nCome, sir, away.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nI must entreat of you some of that money.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWhat money, sir?\r\nFor the fair kindness you have show’d me here,\r\nAnd part being prompted by your present trouble,\r\nOut of my lean and low ability\r\nI’ll lend you something. My having is not much;\r\nI’ll make division of my present with you.\r\nHold, there’s half my coffer.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nWill you deny me now?\r\nIs’t possible that my deserts to you\r\nCan lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,\r\nLest that it make me so unsound a man\r\nAs to upbraid you with those kindnesses\r\nThat I have done for you.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nI know of none,\r\nNor know I you by voice or any feature.\r\nI hate ingratitude more in a man\r\nThan lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,\r\nOr any taint of vice whose strong corruption\r\nInhabits our frail blood.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nO heavens themselves!\r\n\r\nSECOND OFFICER.\r\nCome, sir, I pray you go.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nLet me speak a little. This youth that you see here\r\nI snatch’d one half out of the jaws of death,\r\nReliev’d him with such sanctity of love;\r\nAnd to his image, which methought did promise\r\nMost venerable worth, did I devotion.\r\n\r\nFIRST OFFICER.\r\nWhat’s that to us? The time goes by. Away!\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nBut O how vile an idol proves this god!\r\nThou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.\r\nIn nature there’s no blemish but the mind;\r\nNone can be call’d deform’d but the unkind.\r\nVirtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil\r\nAre empty trunks, o’erflourished by the devil.\r\n\r\nFIRST OFFICER.\r\nThe man grows mad, away with him. Come, come, sir.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nLead me on.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Officers with Antonio._]\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMethinks his words do from such passion fly\r\nThat he believes himself; so do not I.\r\nProve true, imagination, O prove true,\r\nThat I, dear brother, be now ta’en for you!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome hither, knight; come hither, Fabian. We’ll whisper o’er a couplet\r\nor two of most sage saws.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nHe nam’d Sebastian. I my brother know\r\nYet living in my glass; even such and so\r\nIn favour was my brother, and he went\r\nStill in this fashion, colour, ornament,\r\nFor him I imitate. O if it prove,\r\nTempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nA very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare. His\r\ndishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity, and denying\r\nhim; and for his cowardship, ask Fabian.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nA coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n’Slid, I’ll after him again and beat him.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nDo, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nAnd I do not—\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nCome, let’s see the event.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nI dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT IV.\r\n\r\nSCENE I. The Street before Olivia’s House.\r\n\r\n\r\n Enter Sebastian and Clown.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWill you make me believe that I am not sent for you?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nGo to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow.\r\nLet me be clear of thee.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWell held out, i’ faith! No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to\r\nyou by my lady, to bid you come speak with her; nor your name is not\r\nMaster Cesario; nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so, is\r\nso.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI prithee vent thy folly somewhere else,\r\nThou know’st not me.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nVent my folly! He has heard that word of some great man, and now\r\napplies it to a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the\r\nworld, will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness, and\r\ntell me what I shall vent to my lady. Shall I vent to her that thou art\r\ncoming?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.\r\nThere’s money for thee; if you tarry longer\r\nI shall give worse payment.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBy my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men that give fools\r\nmoney get themselves a good report—after fourteen years’ purchase.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Andrew, Sir Toby and Fabian.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNow sir, have I met you again? There’s for you.\r\n\r\n [_Striking Sebastian._]\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhy, there’s for thee, and there, and there.\r\nAre all the people mad?\r\n\r\n [_Beating Sir Andrew._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nHold, sir, or I’ll throw your dagger o’er the house.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nThis will I tell my lady straight. I would not be in some of your coats\r\nfor twopence.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Clown._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome on, sir, hold!\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nNay, let him alone, I’ll go another way to work with him. I’ll have an\r\naction of battery against him, if there be any law in Illyria. Though I\r\nstruck him first, yet it’s no matter for that.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nLet go thy hand!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nCome, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier, put up your\r\niron: you are well fleshed. Come on.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now?\r\nIf thou dar’st tempt me further, draw thy sword.\r\n\r\n [_Draws._]\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWhat, what? Nay, then, I must have an ounce or two of this malapert\r\nblood from you.\r\n\r\n [_Draws._]\r\n\r\n Enter Olivia.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHold, Toby! On thy life I charge thee hold!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nMadam.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWill it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,\r\nFit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,\r\nWhere manners ne’er were preach’d! Out of my sight!\r\nBe not offended, dear Cesario.\r\nRudesby, be gone!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian._]\r\n\r\nI prithee, gentle friend,\r\nLet thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway\r\nIn this uncivil and unjust extent\r\nAgainst thy peace. Go with me to my house,\r\nAnd hear thou there how many fruitless pranks\r\nThis ruffian hath botch’d up, that thou thereby\r\nMayst smile at this. Thou shalt not choose but go.\r\nDo not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,\r\nHe started one poor heart of mine, in thee.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nWhat relish is in this? How runs the stream?\r\nOr I am mad, or else this is a dream.\r\nLet fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;\r\nIf it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nNay, come, I prithee. Would thou’dst be ruled by me!\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nMadam, I will.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, say so, and so be!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A Room in Olivia’s House.\r\n\r\n Enter Maria and Clown.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nNay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard; make him believe thou\r\nart Sir Topas the curate. Do it quickly. I’ll call Sir Toby the whilst.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Maria._]\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWell, I’ll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in’t, and I would I\r\nwere the first that ever dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall\r\nenough to become the function well, nor lean enough to be thought a\r\ngood student, but to be said, an honest man and a good housekeeper goes\r\nas fairly as to say, a careful man and a great scholar. The competitors\r\nenter.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby and Maria.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nJove bless thee, Master Parson.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n_Bonos dies_, Sir Toby: for as the old hermit of Prague, that never saw\r\npen and ink, very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc, ‘That that\r\nis, is’: so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for what is\r\n‘that’ but ‘that’? and ‘is’ but ‘is’?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTo him, Sir Topas.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhat ho, I say! Peace in this prison!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThe knave counterfeits well. A good knave.\r\n\r\nMalvolio within.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nWho calls there?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nSir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nOut, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man? Talkest thou nothing\r\nbut of ladies?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWell said, Master Parson.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir Topas, never was man thus wronged. Good Sir Topas, do not think I\r\nam mad. They have laid me here in hideous darkness.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nFie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest terms, for I\r\nam one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with\r\ncourtesy. Say’st thou that house is dark?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAs hell, Sir Topas.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhy, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the\r\nclerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony; and yet\r\ncomplainest thou of obstruction?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this house is dark.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMadman, thou errest. I say there is no darkness but ignorance, in which\r\nthou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI say this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark\r\nas hell; and I say there was never man thus abused. I am no more mad\r\nthan you are. Make the trial of it in any constant question.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhat is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nThat the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhat think’st thou of his opinion?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nFare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness. Thou shalt hold the\r\nopinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a\r\nwoodcock, lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir Topas, Sir Topas!\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nMy most exquisite Sir Topas!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNay, I am for all waters.\r\n\r\nMARIA.\r\nThou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown. He sees thee\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nTo him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou find’st him. I\r\nwould we were well rid of this knavery. If he may be conveniently\r\ndelivered, I would he were, for I am now so far in offence with my\r\nniece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot.\r\nCome by and by to my chamber.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Sir Toby and Maria._]\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n[_Singing._]\r\n    _Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,\r\n    Tell me how thy lady does._\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nFool!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n    _My lady is unkind, perdy._\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nFool!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n    _Alas, why is she so?_\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nFool, I say!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n    _She loves another_—\r\nWho calls, ha?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nGood fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a\r\ncandle, and pen, ink, and paper. As I am a gentleman, I will live to be\r\nthankful to thee for’t.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMaster Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nAy, good fool.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAlas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nFool, there was never man so notoriously abused. I am as well in my\r\nwits, fool, as thou art.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBut as well? Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in your wits\r\nthan a fool.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nThey have here propertied me; keep me in darkness, send ministers to\r\nme, asses, and do all they can to face me out of my wits.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAdvise you what you say: the minister is here. [_As Sir Topas_]\r\nMalvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore. Endeavour thyself to\r\nsleep, and leave thy vain bibble-babble.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nSir Topas!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n[_As Sir Topas_] Maintain no words with him, good fellow. [_As\r\nhimself_] Who, I, sir? not I, sir. God buy you, good Sir Topas. [_As\r\nSir Topas_] Marry, amen. [_As himself_] I will sir, I will.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nFool, fool, fool, I say!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAlas, sir, be patient. What say you, sir? I am shent for speaking to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nGood fool, help me to some light and some paper. I tell thee I am as\r\nwell in my wits as any man in Illyria.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWell-a-day that you were, sir!\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nBy this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper, and light, and convey\r\nwhat I will set down to my lady. It shall advantage thee more than ever\r\nthe bearing of letter did.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nI will help you to’t. But tell me true, are you not mad indeed? or do\r\nyou but counterfeit?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nBelieve me, I am not. I tell thee true.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNay, I’ll ne’er believe a madman till I see his brains. I will fetch\r\nyou light, and paper, and ink.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nFool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree: I prithee be gone.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n[_Singing._]\r\n  _I am gone, sir, and anon, sir,\r\n    I’ll be with you again,\r\n  In a trice, like to the old Vice,\r\n    Your need to sustain;\r\n  Who with dagger of lath, in his rage and his wrath,\r\n    Cries ‘ah, ha!’ to the devil:\r\n  Like a mad lad, ‘Pare thy nails, dad.\r\n    Adieu, goodman devil.’_\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Olivia’s Garden.\r\n\r\n Enter Sebastian.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nThis is the air; that is the glorious sun,\r\nThis pearl she gave me, I do feel’t and see’t,\r\nAnd though ’tis wonder that enwraps me thus,\r\nYet ’tis not madness. Where’s Antonio, then?\r\nI could not find him at the Elephant,\r\nYet there he was, and there I found this credit,\r\nThat he did range the town to seek me out.\r\nHis counsel now might do me golden service.\r\nFor though my soul disputes well with my sense\r\nThat this may be some error, but no madness,\r\nYet doth this accident and flood of fortune\r\nSo far exceed all instance, all discourse,\r\nThat I am ready to distrust mine eyes\r\nAnd wrangle with my reason that persuades me\r\nTo any other trust but that I am mad,\r\nOr else the lady’s mad; yet if ’twere so,\r\nShe could not sway her house, command her followers,\r\nTake and give back affairs and their dispatch,\r\nWith such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing\r\nAs I perceive she does. There’s something in’t\r\nThat is deceivable. But here the lady comes.\r\n\r\n Enter Olivia and a Priest.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nBlame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,\r\nNow go with me and with this holy man\r\nInto the chantry by: there, before him\r\nAnd underneath that consecrated roof,\r\nPlight me the full assurance of your faith,\r\nThat my most jealous and too doubtful soul\r\nMay live at peace. He shall conceal it\r\nWhiles you are willing it shall come to note,\r\nWhat time we will our celebration keep\r\nAccording to my birth. What do you say?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI’ll follow this good man, and go with you,\r\nAnd having sworn truth, ever will be true.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nThen lead the way, good father, and heavens so shine,\r\nThat they may fairly note this act of mine!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT V.\r\n\r\nSCENE I. The Street before Olivia’s House.\r\n\r\n\r\n Enter Clown and Fabian.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nNow, as thou lov’st me, let me see his letter.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nGood Master Fabian, grant me another request.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nAnything.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nDo not desire to see this letter.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nThis is to give a dog, and in recompense desire my dog again.\r\n\r\n Enter Duke, Viola, Curio and Lords.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBelong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAy, sir, we are some of her trappings.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nI know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTruly, sir, the better for my foes, and the worse for my friends.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nJust the contrary; the better for thy friends.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo, sir, the worse.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHow can that be?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMarry, sir, they praise me, and make an ass of me. Now my foes tell me\r\nplainly I am an ass: so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge\r\nof myself, and by my friends I am abused. So that, conclusions to be as\r\nkisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then,\r\nthe worse for my friends, and the better for my foes.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhy, this is excellent.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBy my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be one of my friends.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThou shalt not be the worse for me; there’s gold.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nBut that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO, you give me ill counsel.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nPut your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh\r\nand blood obey it.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWell, I will be so much a sinner to be a double-dealer: there’s\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\n_Primo, secundo, tertio_, is a good play, and the old saying is, the\r\nthird pays for all; the triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure; or\r\nthe bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind—one, two, three.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nYou can fool no more money out of me at this throw. If you will let\r\nyour lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with\r\nyou, it may awake my bounty further.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nMarry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go, sir, but I\r\nwould not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of\r\ncovetousness: but as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I will\r\nawake it anon.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Clown._]\r\n\r\n Enter Antonio and Officers.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nHere comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThat face of his I do remember well.\r\nYet when I saw it last it was besmear’d\r\nAs black as Vulcan, in the smoke of war.\r\nA baubling vessel was he captain of,\r\nFor shallow draught and bulk unprizable,\r\nWith which such scathful grapple did he make\r\nWith the most noble bottom of our fleet,\r\nThat very envy and the tongue of loss\r\nCried fame and honour on him. What’s the matter?\r\n\r\nFIRST OFFICER.\r\nOrsino, this is that Antonio\r\nThat took the _Phoenix_ and her fraught from Candy,\r\nAnd this is he that did the _Tiger_ board\r\nWhen your young nephew Titus lost his leg.\r\nHere in the streets, desperate of shame and state,\r\nIn private brabble did we apprehend him.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nHe did me kindness, sir; drew on my side,\r\nBut in conclusion, put strange speech upon me.\r\nI know not what ’twas, but distraction.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nNotable pirate, thou salt-water thief,\r\nWhat foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,\r\nWhom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,\r\nHast made thine enemies?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nOrsino, noble sir,\r\nBe pleased that I shake off these names you give me:\r\nAntonio never yet was thief or pirate,\r\nThough, I confess, on base and ground enough,\r\nOrsino’s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:\r\nThat most ingrateful boy there by your side\r\nFrom the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth\r\nDid I redeem; a wreck past hope he was.\r\nHis life I gave him, and did thereto add\r\nMy love, without retention or restraint,\r\nAll his in dedication. For his sake\r\nDid I expose myself, pure for his love,\r\nInto the danger of this adverse town;\r\nDrew to defend him when he was beset;\r\nWhere being apprehended, his false cunning\r\n(Not meaning to partake with me in danger)\r\nTaught him to face me out of his acquaintance,\r\nAnd grew a twenty years’ removed thing\r\nWhile one would wink; denied me mine own purse,\r\nWhich I had recommended to his use\r\nNot half an hour before.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nHow can this be?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhen came he to this town?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nToday, my lord; and for three months before,\r\nNo int’rim, not a minute’s vacancy,\r\nBoth day and night did we keep company.\r\n\r\n Enter Olivia and Attendants.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHere comes the Countess, now heaven walks on earth.\r\nBut for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness.\r\nThree months this youth hath tended upon me;\r\nBut more of that anon. Take him aside.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat would my lord, but that he may not have,\r\nWherein Olivia may seem serviceable?\r\nCesario, you do not keep promise with me.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMadam?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGracious Olivia—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat do you say, Cesario? Good my lord—\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMy lord would speak, my duty hushes me.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nIf it be aught to the old tune, my lord,\r\nIt is as fat and fulsome to mine ear\r\nAs howling after music.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nStill so cruel?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nStill so constant, lord.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhat, to perverseness? You uncivil lady,\r\nTo whose ingrate and unauspicious altars\r\nMy soul the faithfull’st off’rings hath breathed out\r\nThat e’er devotion tender’d! What shall I do?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nEven what it please my lord that shall become him.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nWhy should I not, had I the heart to do it,\r\nLike to the Egyptian thief at point of death,\r\nKill what I love?—a savage jealousy\r\nThat sometime savours nobly. But hear me this:\r\nSince you to non-regardance cast my faith,\r\nAnd that I partly know the instrument\r\nThat screws me from my true place in your favour,\r\nLive you the marble-breasted tyrant still.\r\nBut this your minion, whom I know you love,\r\nAnd whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,\r\nHim will I tear out of that cruel eye\r\nWhere he sits crowned in his master’s spite.—\r\nCome, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:\r\nI’ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,\r\nTo spite a raven’s heart within a dove.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,\r\nTo do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhere goes Cesario?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAfter him I love\r\nMore than I love these eyes, more than my life,\r\nMore, by all mores, than e’er I shall love wife.\r\nIf I do feign, you witnesses above\r\nPunish my life for tainting of my love.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAh me, detested! how am I beguil’d!\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWho does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?\r\nCall forth the holy father.\r\n\r\n [_Exit an Attendant._]\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\n[_To Viola._] Come, away!\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHusband?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAy, husband. Can he that deny?\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHer husband, sirrah?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nNo, my lord, not I.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAlas, it is the baseness of thy fear\r\nThat makes thee strangle thy propriety.\r\nFear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up.\r\nBe that thou know’st thou art, and then thou art\r\nAs great as that thou fear’st.\r\n\r\n Enter Priest.\r\n\r\nO, welcome, father!\r\nFather, I charge thee, by thy reverence\r\nHere to unfold—though lately we intended\r\nTo keep in darkness what occasion now\r\nReveals before ’tis ripe—what thou dost know\r\nHath newly passed between this youth and me.\r\n\r\nPRIEST.\r\nA contract of eternal bond of love,\r\nConfirmed by mutual joinder of your hands,\r\nAttested by the holy close of lips,\r\nStrengthen’d by interchangement of your rings,\r\nAnd all the ceremony of this compact\r\nSealed in my function, by my testimony;\r\nSince when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave,\r\nI have travelled but two hours.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nO thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be\r\nWhen time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case?\r\nOr will not else thy craft so quickly grow\r\nThat thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?\r\nFarewell, and take her; but direct thy feet\r\nWhere thou and I henceforth may never meet.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMy lord, I do protest—\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nO, do not swear.\r\nHold little faith, though thou has too much fear.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nFor the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently to Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWhat’s the matter?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n’Has broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too.\r\nFor the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nWho has done this, Sir Andrew?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nThe Count’s gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for a coward, but he’s\r\nthe very devil incardinate.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nMy gentleman, Cesario?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\n’Od’s lifelings, here he is!—You broke my head for nothing; and that\r\nthat I did, I was set on to do’t by Sir Toby.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nWhy do you speak to me? I never hurt you:\r\nYou drew your sword upon me without cause,\r\nBut I bespake you fair and hurt you not.\r\n\r\n Enter Sir Toby, drunk, led by the Clown.\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nIf a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me. I think you set\r\nnothing by a bloody coxcomb. Here comes Sir Toby halting, you shall\r\nhear more: but if he had not been in drink, he would have tickled you\r\nothergates than he did.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nHow now, gentleman? How is’t with you?\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThat’s all one; ’has hurt me, and there’s th’ end on’t. Sot, didst see\r\nDick Surgeon, sot?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nO, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes were set at eight i’\r\nth’ morning.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nThen he’s a rogue, and a passy measures pavin. I hate a drunken rogue.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAway with him. Who hath made this havoc with them?\r\n\r\nSIR ANDREW.\r\nI’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be dressed together.\r\n\r\nSIR TOBY.\r\nWill you help? An ass-head, and a coxcomb, and a knave, a thin-faced\r\nknave, a gull?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nGet him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Clown, Fabian, Sir Toby and Sir Andrew._]\r\n\r\n Enter Sebastian.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nI am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman;\r\nBut had it been the brother of my blood,\r\nI must have done no less with wit and safety.\r\nYou throw a strange regard upon me, and by that\r\nI do perceive it hath offended you.\r\nPardon me, sweet one, even for the vows\r\nWe made each other but so late ago.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nOne face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!\r\nA natural perspective, that is, and is not!\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nAntonio, O my dear Antonio!\r\nHow have the hours rack’d and tortur’d me\r\nSince I have lost thee.\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nSebastian are you?\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nFear’st thou that, Antonio?\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\nHow have you made division of yourself?\r\nAn apple cleft in two is not more twin\r\nThan these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nMost wonderful!\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nDo I stand there? I never had a brother:\r\nNor can there be that deity in my nature\r\nOf here and everywhere. I had a sister,\r\nWhom the blind waves and surges have devoured.\r\nOf charity, what kin are you to me?\r\nWhat countryman? What name? What parentage?\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nOf Messaline: Sebastian was my father;\r\nSuch a Sebastian was my brother too:\r\nSo went he suited to his watery tomb.\r\nIf spirits can assume both form and suit,\r\nYou come to fright us.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nA spirit I am indeed,\r\nBut am in that dimension grossly clad,\r\nWhich from the womb I did participate.\r\nWere you a woman, as the rest goes even,\r\nI should my tears let fall upon your cheek,\r\nAnd say, ‘Thrice welcome, drowned Viola.’\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nMy father had a mole upon his brow.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nAnd so had mine.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd died that day when Viola from her birth\r\nHad numbered thirteen years.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\nO, that record is lively in my soul!\r\nHe finished indeed his mortal act\r\nThat day that made my sister thirteen years.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nIf nothing lets to make us happy both\r\nBut this my masculine usurp’d attire,\r\nDo not embrace me till each circumstance\r\nOf place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump\r\nThat I am Viola; which to confirm,\r\nI’ll bring you to a captain in this town,\r\nWhere lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help\r\nI was preserv’d to serve this noble count.\r\nAll the occurrence of my fortune since\r\nHath been between this lady and this lord.\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN.\r\n[_To Olivia._] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook.\r\nBut nature to her bias drew in that.\r\nYou would have been contracted to a maid;\r\nNor are you therein, by my life, deceived:\r\nYou are betroth’d both to a maid and man.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nBe not amazed; right noble is his blood.\r\nIf this be so, as yet the glass seems true,\r\nI shall have share in this most happy wreck.\r\n[_To Viola._] Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times\r\nThou never shouldst love woman like to me.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nAnd all those sayings will I over-swear,\r\nAnd all those swearings keep as true in soul\r\nAs doth that orbed continent the fire\r\nThat severs day from night.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nGive me thy hand,\r\nAnd let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds.\r\n\r\nVIOLA.\r\nThe captain that did bring me first on shore\r\nHath my maid’s garments. He, upon some action,\r\nIs now in durance, at Malvolio’s suit,\r\nA gentleman and follower of my lady’s.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHe shall enlarge him. Fetch Malvolio hither.\r\nAnd yet, alas, now I remember me,\r\nThey say, poor gentleman, he’s much distract.\r\n\r\n Enter Clown, with a letter and Fabian.\r\n\r\nA most extracting frenzy of mine own\r\nFrom my remembrance clearly banished his.\r\nHow does he, sirrah?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nTruly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the stave’s end as well as a man in\r\nhis case may do. Has here writ a letter to you. I should have given it\r\nyou today morning, but as a madman’s epistles are no gospels, so it\r\nskills not much when they are delivered.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nOpen ’t, and read it.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nLook then to be well edified, when the fool delivers the madman. _By\r\nthe Lord, madam,—_\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHow now, art thou mad?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nNo, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship will have it as it\r\nought to be, you must allow _vox_.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nPrithee, read i’ thy right wits.\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nSo I do, madonna. But to read his right wits is to read thus; therefore\r\nperpend, my princess, and give ear.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\n[_To Fabian._] Read it you, sirrah.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\n[_Reads._] _By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know\r\nit. Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin\r\nrule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your\r\nladyship. I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put\r\non; with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or you much\r\nshame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought\r\nof, and speak out of my injury.\r\n                        The madly-used Malvolio._\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nDid he write this?\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nAy, madam.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nThis savours not much of distraction.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nSee him delivered, Fabian, bring him hither.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Fabian._]\r\n\r\nMy lord, so please you, these things further thought on,\r\nTo think me as well a sister, as a wife,\r\nOne day shall crown th’ alliance on’t, so please you,\r\nHere at my house, and at my proper cost.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nMadam, I am most apt t’ embrace your offer.\r\n[_To Viola._] Your master quits you; and for your service done him,\r\nSo much against the mettle of your sex,\r\nSo far beneath your soft and tender breeding,\r\nAnd since you call’d me master for so long,\r\nHere is my hand; you shall from this time be\r\nYour master’s mistress.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nA sister? You are she.\r\n\r\n Enter Fabian and Malvolio.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nIs this the madman?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAy, my lord, this same.\r\nHow now, Malvolio?\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nMadam, you have done me wrong,\r\nNotorious wrong.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHave I, Malvolio? No.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nLady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.\r\nYou must not now deny it is your hand,\r\nWrite from it, if you can, in hand, or phrase,\r\nOr say ’tis not your seal, not your invention:\r\nYou can say none of this. Well, grant it then,\r\nAnd tell me, in the modesty of honour,\r\nWhy you have given me such clear lights of favour,\r\nBade me come smiling and cross-garter’d to you,\r\nTo put on yellow stockings, and to frown\r\nUpon Sir Toby, and the lighter people;\r\nAnd acting this in an obedient hope,\r\nWhy have you suffer’d me to be imprison’d,\r\nKept in a dark house, visited by the priest,\r\nAnd made the most notorious geck and gull\r\nThat e’er invention played on? Tell me why?\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAlas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,\r\nThough I confess, much like the character:\r\nBut out of question, ’tis Maria’s hand.\r\nAnd now I do bethink me, it was she\r\nFirst told me thou wast mad; then cam’st in smiling,\r\nAnd in such forms which here were presuppos’d\r\nUpon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content.\r\nThis practice hath most shrewdly pass’d upon thee.\r\nBut when we know the grounds and authors of it,\r\nThou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge\r\nOf thine own cause.\r\n\r\nFABIAN.\r\nGood madam, hear me speak,\r\nAnd let no quarrel, nor no brawl to come,\r\nTaint the condition of this present hour,\r\nWhich I have wonder’d at. In hope it shall not,\r\nMost freely I confess, myself and Toby\r\nSet this device against Malvolio here,\r\nUpon some stubborn and uncourteous parts\r\nWe had conceiv’d against him. Maria writ\r\nThe letter, at Sir Toby’s great importance,\r\nIn recompense whereof he hath married her.\r\nHow with a sportful malice it was follow’d\r\nMay rather pluck on laughter than revenge,\r\nIf that the injuries be justly weigh’d\r\nThat have on both sides passed.\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nAlas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!\r\n\r\nCLOWN.\r\nWhy, ‘some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have\r\ngreatness thrown upon them.’ I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir\r\nTopas, sir, but that’s all one. ‘By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.’ But\r\ndo you remember? ‘Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal? And you\r\nsmile not, he’s gagged’? And thus the whirligig of time brings in his\r\nrevenges.\r\n\r\nMALVOLIO.\r\nI’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nOLIVIA.\r\nHe hath been most notoriously abus’d.\r\n\r\nDUKE.\r\nPursue him, and entreat him to a peace:\r\nHe hath not told us of the captain yet.\r\nWhen that is known, and golden time convents,\r\nA solemn combination shall be made\r\nOf our dear souls.—Meantime, sweet sister,\r\nWe will not part from hence.—Cesario, come:\r\nFor so you shall be while you are a man;\r\nBut when in other habits you are seen,\r\nOrsino’s mistress, and his fancy’s queen.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n Clown sings.\r\n\r\n_   When that I was and a little tiny boy,\r\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\r\n   A foolish thing was but a toy,\r\n     For the rain it raineth every day._\r\n\r\n_   But when I came to man’s estate,\r\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\r\n   ’Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,\r\n     For the rain it raineth every day._\r\n\r\n_   But when I came, alas, to wive,\r\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\r\n   By swaggering could I never thrive,\r\n     For the rain it raineth every day._\r\n\r\n_   But when I came unto my beds,\r\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\r\n   With toss-pots still had drunken heads,\r\n     For the rain it raineth every day._\r\n\r\n_   A great while ago the world begun,\r\n     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\r\n   But that’s all one, our play is done,\r\n     And we’ll strive to please you every day._\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]",
