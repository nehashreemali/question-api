This must cease\r\nand he must go the way of all flesh, material or imaginary.  One likes\r\nto think that there is some fantastic limbo for the children of\r\nimagination, some strange, impossible place where the beaux of Fielding\r\nmay still make love to the belles of Richardson, where Scott's heroes\r\nstill may strut, Dickens's delightful Cockneys still raise a laugh, and\r\nThackeray's worldlings continue to carry on their reprehensible\r\ncareers.  Perhaps in some humble corner of such a Valhalla, Sherlock\r\nand his Watson may for a time find a place, while some more astute\r\nsleuth with some even less astute comrade may fill the stage which they\r\nhave vacated.\r\n\r\nHis career has been a long one--though it is possible to exaggerate it;\r\ndecrepit gentlemen who approach me and declare that his adventures\r\nformed the reading of their boyhood do not meet the response from me\r\nwhich they seem to expect.  One is not anxious to have one's personal\r\ndates handled so unkindly.  As a matter of cold fact Holmes made his\r\n_début_ in _A Study in Scarlet_ and in _The Sign of Four_, two small\r\nbooklets which appeared between 1887 and 1889.  It was in 1891 that \"A\r\nScandal in Bohemia,\" the first of the long series of short stories,\r\nappeared in _The Strand Magazine_.  The public seemed appreciative and\r\ndesirous of more, so that from that date, thirty-six years ago, they\r\nhave been produced in a broken series which now contains no fewer than\r\nfifty-six stories, republished in _The Adventures_, _The Memoirs_, _The\r\nReturn_, and _His Last Bow_, and there remain these twelve published\r\nduring the last few years which are here produced under the title of\r\n_The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes_.  He began his adventures in the\r\nvery heart of the later Victorian Era, carried it through the\r\nall-too-short reign of Edward, and has managed to hold his own little\r\nniche even in these feverish days.  Thus it would be true to say that\r\nthose who first read of him as young men have lived to see their own\r\ngrown-up children following the same adventures in the same magazine.\r\nIt is a striking example of the patience and loyalty of the British\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nI had fully determined at the conclusion of _The Memoirs_ to bring\r\nHolmes to an end, as I felt that my literary energies should not be\r\ndirected too much into one channel.  That pale, clear-cut face and\r\nloose-limbed figure were taking up an undue share of my imagination.  I\r\ndid the deed, but, fortunately, no coroner had pronounced upon the\r\nremains, and so, after a long interval, it was not difficult for me to\r\nrespond to the flattering demand and to explain my rash act away.  I\r\nhave never regretted it, for I have not in actual practice found that\r\nthese lighter sketches have prevented me from exploring and finding my\r\nlimitations in such varied branches of literature as history, poetry,\r\nhistorical novels, psychic research, and the drama.  Had Holmes never\r\nexisted I could not have done more, though he may perhaps have stood a\r\nlittle in the way of the recognition of my more serious literary work.\r\n\r\nAnd so, reader, farewell to Sherlock Holmes!  I thank you for your past\r\nconstancy, and can but hope that some return has been made in the shape\r\nof that distraction from the worries of life and stimulating change of\r\nthought which can only be found in the fairy kingdom of romance.\r\n\r\nARTHUR CONAN DOYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS\r\n\r\n  I  The Adventure of the Illustrious Client\r\n  II  The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier\r\n  III  The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone\r\n  IV  The Adventure of the Three Gables\r\n  V  The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\r\n  VI  The Adventure of the Three Garridebs\r\n  VII  The Problem of Thor Bridge\r\n  VIII  The Adventure of the Creeping Man\r\n  IX  The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\r\n  X  The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger\r\n  XI  The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place\r\n  XII  The Adventure of the Retired Colourman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS CLIENT\r\n\r\n\"It can't hurt now,\" was Mr. Sherlock Holmes's comment when, for the\r\ntenth time in as many years, I asked his leave to reveal the following\r\nnarrative.  So it was that at last I obtained permission to put on\r\nrecord what was, in some ways, the supreme moment of my friend's career.\r\n\r\nBoth Holmes and I had a weakness for the Turkish Bath.  It was over a\r\nsmoke in the pleasant lassitude of the drying-room that I have found\r\nhim less reticent and more human than anywhere else.  On the upper\r\nfloor of the Northumberland Avenue establishment there is an isolated\r\ncorner where two couches lie side by side, and it was on these that we\r\nlay upon September 3, 1902, the day when my narrative begins.  I had\r\nasked him whether anything was stirring, and for answer he had shot his\r\nlong, thin, nervous arm out of the sheets which enveloped him and had\r\ndrawn an envelope from the inside pocket of the coat which hung beside\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It may be some fussy, self-important fool, it may be a matter of life\r\nor death,\" said he, as he handed me the note.  \"I know no more than\r\nthis message tells me.\"\r\n\r\nIt was from the Carlton Club, and dated the evening before.  This is\r\nwhat I read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sir James Damery presents his compliments to Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and\r\nwill call upon him at 4.30 to-morrow.  Sir James begs to say that the\r\nmatter upon which he desires to consult Mr. Holmes is very delicate,\r\nand also very important.  He trusts, therefore, that Mr. Holmes will\r\nmake every effort to grant this interview, and that he will confirm it\r\nover the telephone to the Carlton Club.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I need not say that I have confirmed it, Watson,\" said Holmes, as I\r\nreturned the paper.  \"Do you know anything of this man Damery?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that his name is a household word in Society.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can tell you a little more than that.  He has rather a\r\nreputation for arranging delicate matters which are to be kept out of\r\nthe papers.  You may remember his negotiations with Sir George Lewis\r\nover the Hammerford Will case.  He is a man of the world with a natural\r\nturn for diplomacy.  I am bound, therefore, to hope that it is not a\r\nfalse scent and that he has some real need for our assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you will be so good, Watson.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be honoured.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have the hour--four-thirty.  Until then we can put the matter\r\nout of our heads.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI was living in my own rooms in Queen Anne Street at the time, but I\r\nwas round at Baker Street before the time named.  Sharp to the\r\nhalf-hour, Colonel Sir James Damery was announced.  It is hardly\r\nnecessary to describe him, for many will remember that large, bluff,\r\nhonest personality, that broad, clean-shaven face, above all, that\r\npleasant, mellow voice.  Frankness shone from his grey Irish eyes, and\r\ngood humour played round his mobile, smiling lips.  His lucent top-hat,\r\nhis dark frock-coat, indeed, every detail, from the pearl pin in the\r\nblack satin cravat to the lavender spats over the varnished shoes,\r\nspoke of the meticulous care in dress for which he was famous.  The\r\nbig, masterful aristocrat dominated the little room.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I was prepared to find Dr. Watson,\" he remarked, with a\r\ncourteous bow.  \"His collaboration may be very necessary, for we are\r\ndealing on this occasion, Mr. Holmes, with a man to whom violence is\r\nfamiliar and who will, literally, stick at nothing.  I should say that\r\nthere is no more dangerous man in Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had several opponents to whom that flattering term has been\r\napplied,\" said Holmes, with a smile.  \"Don't you smoke?  Then you will\r\nexcuse me if I light my pipe.  If your man is more dangerous than the\r\nlate Professor Moriarty, or than the living Colonel Sebastian Moran,\r\nthen he is indeed worth meeting.  May I ask his name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever heard of Baron Gruner?\r\n\r\n\"You mean the Austrian murderer?\"\r\n\r\nColonel Damery threw up his kid-gloved hands with a laugh.  \"There is\r\nno getting past you, Mr. Holmes!  Wonderful!  So you have already sized\r\nhim up as a murderer?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my business to follow the details of Continental crime.  Who\r\ncould possibly have read what happened at Prague and have any doubts as\r\nto the man's guilt!  It was a purely technical legal point and the\r\nsuspicious death of a witness that saved him!  I am as sure that he\r\nkilled his wife when the so-called 'accident' happened in the Splügen\r\nPass as if I had seen him do it.  I knew, also, that he had come to\r\nEngland, and had a presentiment that sooner or later he would find me\r\nsome work to do.  Well, what has Baron Gruner been up to?  I presume it\r\nis not this old tragedy which has come up again?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is more serious than that.  To revenge crime is important, but\r\nto prevent it is more so.  It is a terrible thing, Mr. Holmes, to see a\r\ndreadful event, an atrocious situation, preparing itself before your\r\neyes, to clearly understand whither it will lead and yet to be utterly\r\nunable to avert it.  Can a human being be placed in a more trying\r\nposition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will sympathize with the client in whose interests I am\r\nacting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not understand that you were merely an intermediary.  Who is the\r\nprincipal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes, I must beg you not to press that question.  It is\r\nimportant that I should be able to assure him that his honoured name\r\nhas been in no way dragged into the matter.  His motives are, to the\r\nlast degree, honourable and chivalrous, but he prefers to remain\r\nunknown.  I need not say that your fees will be assured and that you\r\nwill be given a perfectly free hand.  Surely the actual name of your\r\nclient is immaterial?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry,\" said Holmes.  \"I am accustomed to have mystery at one end\r\nof my cases, but to have it at both ends is too confusing.  I fear, Sir\r\nJames, that I must decline to act.\"\r\n\r\nOur visitor was greatly disturbed.  His large, sensitive face was\r\ndarkened with emotion and disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"You hardly realize the effect of your own action, Mr. Holmes,\" said\r\nhe.  \"You place me in a most serious dilemma, for I am perfectly\r\ncertain that you would be proud to take over the case if I could give\r\nyou the facts, and yet a promise forbids me from revealing them all.\r\nMay I, at least, lay all that I can before you?\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means, so long as it is understood that I commit myself to\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is understood.  In the first place, you have no doubt heard of\r\nGeneral de Merville?\"\r\n\r\n\"De Merville of Khyber fame?  Yes, I have heard of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has a daughter, Violet de Merville, young, rich, beautiful,\r\naccomplished, a wonder-woman in every way.  It is this daughter, this\r\nlovely, innocent girl, whom we are endeavouring to save from the\r\nclutches of a fiend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Baron Gruner has some hold over her, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The strongest of all holds where a woman is concerned--the hold of\r\nlove.  The fellow is, as you may have heard, extraordinarily handsome,\r\nwith a most fascinating manner, a gentle voice, and that air of romance\r\nand mystery which means so much to a woman.  He is said to have the\r\nwhole sex at his mercy and to have made ample use of the fact.\r\n\r\n\"But how came such a man to meet a lady of the standing of Miss Violet\r\nde Merville?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was on a Mediterranean yachting voyage.  The company, though\r\nselect, paid their own passages.  No doubt the promoters hardly\r\nrealized the Baron's true character until it was too late.  The villain\r\nattached himself to the lady, and with such effect that he has\r\ncompletely and absolutely won her heart.  To say that she loves him\r\nhardly expresses it.  She dotes upon him, she is obsessed by him.\r\nOutside of him there is nothing on earth.  She will not hear one word\r\nagainst him.  Everything has been done to cure her of her madness, but\r\nin vain.  To sum up, she proposes to marry him next month.  As she is\r\nof age and has a will of iron, it is hard to know how to prevent her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does she know about the Austrian episode?\"\r\n\r\n\"The cunning devil has told her every unsavoury public scandal of his\r\npast life, but always in such a way as to make himself out to be an\r\ninnocent martyr.  She absolutely accepts his version and will listen to\r\nno other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!  But surely you have inadvertently let out the name of your\r\nclient?  It is no doubt General de Merville.\"\r\n\r\nOur visitor fidgeted in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"I could deceive you by saying so, Mr. Holmes, but it would not be\r\ntrue.  De Merville is a broken man.  The strong soldier has been\r\nutterly demoralized by this incident.  He has lost the nerve which\r\nnever failed him on the battlefield and has become a weak, doddering\r\nold man, utterly incapable of contending with a brilliant, forceful\r\nrascal like this Austrian.  My client, however, is an old friend, one\r\nwho has known the General intimately for many years and taken a\r\npaternal interest in this young girl since she wore short frocks.  He\r\ncannot see this tragedy consummated without some attempt to stop it.\r\nThere is nothing in which Scotland Yard can act.  It was his own\r\nsuggestion that you should be called in, but it was, as I have said, on\r\nthe express stipulation that he should not be personally involved in\r\nthe matter.  I have no doubt, Mr. Holmes, with your great powers you\r\ncould easily trace my client back through me, but I must ask you, as a\r\npoint of honour, to refrain from doing so, and not to break in upon his\r\nincognito.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes gave a whimsical smile.\r\n\r\n\"I think I may safely promise that,\" said he.  \"I may add that your\r\nproblem interests me, and that I shall be prepared to look into it.\r\nHow shall I keep in touch with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Carlton Club will find me.  But, in case of emergency, there is a\r\nprivate telephone call, 'XX.31.'\"\r\n\r\nHolmes noted it down and sat, still smiling, with the open\r\nmemorandum-book upon his knee.\r\n\r\n\"The Baron's present address, please?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vernon Lodge, near Kingston.  It is a large house.  He has been\r\nfortunate in some rather shady speculations and is a rich man, which,\r\nnaturally, makes him a more dangerous antagonist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he at home at present?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Apart from what you have told me, can you give me any further\r\ninformation about the man?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has expensive tastes.  He is a horse fancier.  For a short time he\r\nplayed polo at Hurlingham, but then this Prague affair got noised about\r\nand he had to leave.  He collects books and pictures.  He is a man with\r\na considerable artistic side to his nature.  He is, I believe, a\r\nrecognized authority upon Chinese pottery, and has written a book upon\r\nthe subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"A complex mind,\" said Holmes.  \"All great criminals have that.  My old\r\nfriend Charlie Peace was a violin virtuoso.  Wainwright was no mean\r\nartist.  I could quote many more.  Well, Sir James, you will inform\r\nyour client that I am turning my mind upon Baron Gruner.  I can say no\r\nmore.  I have some sources of information of my own, and dare say we\r\nmay find some means of opening matter up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen our visitor had left us, Holmes sat so long in deep thought that\r\nit seemed to me that he had forgotten my presence.  At last, however,\r\nhe came briskly back to earth.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Watson, any views?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I should think you had better see the young lady herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Watson, if her poor old broken father cannot move her, how\r\nshall I, a stranger, prevail?  And yet there is something in the\r\nsuggestion if all else fails.  But I think we must begin from a\r\ndifferent angle.  I rather fancy that Shinwell Johnson might be a help.\"\r\n\r\nI have not had occasion to mention Shinwell Johnson in these memoirs\r\nbecause I have seldom drawn my cases from the latter phases of my\r\nfriend's career.  During the first years of the century he became a\r\nvaluable assistant.  Johnson, I grieve to say, made his name first as a\r\nvery dangerous villain and served two terms at Parkhurst.  Finally, he\r\nrepented and allied himself to Holmes, acting as his agent in the huge\r\ncriminal underworld of London, and obtaining information which often\r\nproved to be of vital importance.  Had Johnson been a \"nark\" of the\r\npolice he would soon have been exposed, but as he dealt with cases\r\nwhich never came directly into the courts, his activities were never\r\nrealized by his companions.  With the glamour of his two convictions\r\nupon him, he had the _entrée_ of every night-club, doss-house, and\r\ngambling-den in the town, and his quick observation and active brain\r\nmade him an ideal agent for gaining information.  It was to him that\r\nSherlock Holmes now proposed to turn.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible for me to follow the immediate steps taken by my\r\nfriend, for I had some pressing professional business of my own, but I\r\nmet him by appointment that evening at Simpson's, where, sitting at a\r\nsmall table in the front window, and looking down at the rushing stream\r\nof life in the Strand, he told me something of what had passed.\r\n\r\n\"Johnson is on the prowl,\" said he.  \"He may pick up some garbage in\r\nthe darker recesses of the underworld, for it is down there, amid the\r\nblack roots of crime, that we must hunt for this man's secrets.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, if the lady will not accept what is already known, why should any\r\nfresh discovery of yours turn her from her purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows, Watson?  Woman's heart and mind are insoluble puzzles to\r\nthe male.  Murder might be condoned or explained, and yet some smaller\r\noffence might rankle.  Baron Gruner remarked to me----\"\r\n\r\n\"He remarked to you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, to be sure, I had not told you of my plans!  Well, Watson, I love\r\nto come to close grips with my man.  I like to meet him eye to eye and\r\nread for myself the stuff that he is made of.  When I had given Johnson\r\nhis instructions, I took a cab out to Kingston and found the Baron in a\r\nmost affable mood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he recognize you?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no difficulty about that, for I simply sent in my card.  He\r\nis an excellent antagonist, cool as ice, silky voiced and soothing as\r\none of your fashionable consultants, and poisonous as a cobra.  He has\r\nbreed in him, a real aristocrat of crime, with a superficial suggestion\r\nof afternoon tea and all the cruelty of the grave behind it.  Yes, I am\r\nglad to have had my attention called to Baron Adelbert Gruner.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say he was affable?\"\r\n\r\n\"A purring cat who thinks he sees prospective mice.  Some people's\r\naffability is more deadly than the violence of coarser souls.  His\r\ngreeting was characteristic.  'I rather thought I should see you sooner\r\nor later, Mr. Holmes,' said he.  'You have been engaged, no doubt, by\r\nGeneral de Merville to endeavour to stop my marriage with his daughter,\r\nViolet.  That is so, is it not?'\r\n\r\n\"I acquiesced.\r\n\r\n\"'My dear man,' said he, 'you will only ruin your own well-deserved\r\nreputation.  It is not a case in which you can possibly succeed.  You\r\nwill have barren work, to say nothing of incurring some danger.  Let me\r\nvery strongly advise you to draw off at once.'\r\n\r\n\"'It is curious,' I answered, 'but that was the very advice which I had\r\nintended to give you.  I have a respect for your brains, Baron, and the\r\nlittle which I have seen of your personality has not lessened it.  Let\r\nme put it to you as man to man.  No one wants to rake up your past and\r\nmake you unduly uncomfortable.  It is over, and you are now in smooth\r\nwaters, but if you persist in this marriage you will raise up a swarm\r\nof powerful enemies who will never leave you alone until they have made\r\nEngland too hot to hold you.  Is the game worth it?  Surely you would\r\nbe wiser if you left the lady alone.  It would not be pleasant for you\r\nif these facts of your past were brought to her notice.'\r\n\r\n\"The Baron has little waxed tips of hair under his nose, like the short\r\nantennae of an insect.  These quivered with amusement as he listened,\r\nand he finally broke into a gentle chuckle.\r\n\r\n\"'Excuse my amusement, Mr. Holmes,' said he, 'but it is really funny to\r\nsee you trying to play a hand with no cards in it.  I don't think\r\nanyone could do it better, but it is rather pathetic, all the same.\r\nNot a colour card there, Mr. Holmes, nothing but the smallest of the\r\nsmall.'\r\n\r\n\"'So you think.'\r\n\r\n\"'So I know.  Let me make the thing clear to you, for my own hand is so\r\nstrong that I can afford to show it.  I have been fortunate enough to\r\nwin the entire affection of this lady.  This was given to me in spite\r\nof the fact that I told her very clearly of all the unhappy incidents\r\nin my past life.  I also told her that certain wicked and designing\r\npersons--I hope you recognize yourself--would come to her and tell her\r\nthese things, and I warned her how to treat them.  You have heard of\r\npost-hypnotic suggestion, Mr. Holmes?  Well, you will see how it works,\r\nfor a man of personality can use hypnotism without any vulgar passes or\r\ntomfoolery.  So she is ready for you and, I have no doubt, would give\r\nyou an appointment, for she is quite amenable to her father's\r\nwill--save only in the one little matter.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, Watson, there seemed to be no more to say, so I took my leave\r\nwith as much cold dignity as I could summon, but, as I had my hand on\r\nthe door-handle, he stopped me.\r\n\r\n\"'By the way, Mr. Holmes,' said he, 'did you know Le Brun, the French\r\nagent?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you know what befell him?'\r\n\r\n\"'I heard that he was beaten by some Apaches in the Montmartre district\r\nand crippled for life.'\r\n\r\n\"'Quite true, Mr. Holmes.  By a curious coincidence he had been\r\ninquiring into my affairs only a week before.  Don't do it, Mr. Holmes;\r\nit's not a lucky thing to do.  Several have found that out.  My last\r\nword to you is, go your own way and let me go mine.  Good-bye!'\r\n\r\n\"So there you are, Watson.  You are up to date now.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fellow seems dangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mighty dangerous.  I disregard the blusterer, but this is the sort of\r\nman who says rather less than he means.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must you interfere?  Does it really matter if he marries the girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Considering that he undoubtedly murdered his last wife, I should say\r\nit mattered very much.  Besides, the client!  Well, well, we need not\r\ndiscuss that.  When you have finished your coffee you had best come\r\nhome with me, for the blithe Shinwell will be there with his report.\"\r\n\r\nWe found him sure enough, a huge, coarse, red-faced, scorbutic man,\r\nwith a pair of vivid black eyes which were the only external sign of\r\nthe very cunning mind within.  It seems that he had dived down into\r\nwhat was peculiarly his kingdom, and beside him on the settee was a\r\nbrand which he had brought up in the shape of a slim, flame-like young\r\nwoman with a pale, intense face, youthful, and yet so worn with sin and\r\nsorrow that one read the terrible years which had left their leprous\r\nmark upon her.\r\n\r\n\"This is Miss Kitty Winter,\" said Shinwell Johnson, waving his fat hand\r\nas an introduction.  \"What she don't know--well, there, she'll speak\r\nfor herself.  Put my hand right on her, Mr. Holmes, within an hour of\r\nyour message.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm easy to find,\" said the young woman.  \"Hell, London, gets me every\r\ntime.  Same address for Porky Shinwell.  We're old mates, Porky, you\r\nand I.  But, by Gripes! there is another who ought to be down in a\r\nlower hell than we if there was any justice in the world!  That is the\r\nman you are after, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes smiled.  \"I gather we have your good wishes, Miss Winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I can help to put him where he belongs, I'm yours to the rattle,\"\r\nsaid our visitor, with fierce energy.  There was an intensity of hatred\r\nin her white, set face and her blazing eyes such as woman seldom and\r\nman never can attain.  \"You needn't go into my past, Mr. Holmes.\r\nThat's neither here nor there.  But what I am Adelbert Gruner made me.\r\nIf I could pull him down!\"  She clutched frantically with her hands\r\ninto the air.  \"Oh, if I could only pull him into the pit where he has\r\npushed so many!\"\r\n\r\n\"You know how the matter stands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Porky Shinwell has been telling me.  He's after some other poor fool\r\nand wants to marry her this time.  You want to stop it.  Well, you\r\nsurely know enough about this devil to prevent any decent girl in her\r\nsenses wanting to be in the same parish with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is not in her senses.  She is madly in love.  She has been told\r\nall about him.  She cares nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Told about the murder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"My Lord, she must have a nerve!\"\r\n\r\n\"She puts them all down as slanders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you lay proofs before her silly eyes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, can you help us do so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ain't I a proof myself?  If I stood before her and told her how he\r\nused me----\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you do this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would I?  Would I not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it might be worth trying.  But he has told her most of his sins\r\nand had pardon from her, and I understand she will not reopen the\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll lay he didn't tell her all,\" said Miss Winter.  \"I caught a\r\nglimpse of one or two murders besides the one that made such a fuss.\r\nHe would speak of someone in his velvet way and then look at me with a\r\nsteady eye and say: 'He died within a month.'  It wasn't hot air,\r\neither.  But I took little notice--you see, I loved him myself at that\r\ntime.  Whatever he did went with me, same as with this poor fool!\r\nThere was just one thing that shook me.  Yes, by Gripes! if it had not\r\nbeen for his poisonous, lying tongue that explains and soothes, I'd\r\nhave left him that very night.  It's a book he has--a brown leather\r\nbook with a lock, and his arms in gold on the outside.  I think he was\r\na bit drunk that night, or he would not have shown it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, Mr. Holmes, this man collects women, and takes a pride in\r\nhis collection, as some men collect moths or butterflies.  He had it\r\nall in that book.  Snapshot photographs, names, details, everything\r\nabout them.  It was a beastly book--a book no man, even if he had come\r\nfrom the gutter, could have put together.  But it was Adelbert Gruner's\r\nbook all the same.  'Souls I have ruined.'  He could have put that on\r\nthe outside if he had been so minded.  However, that's neither here nor\r\nthere, for the book would not serve you, and, if it would, you can't\r\nget it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell you where it is now?  It's more than a year since I\r\nleft him.  I know where he kept it then.  He's a precise, tidy cat of a\r\nman in many of his ways, so maybe it is still in the pigeon-hole of the\r\nold bureau in the inner study.  Do you know his house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been in the study,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Have you, though?  You haven't been slow on the job if you only\r\nstarted this morning.  Maybe dear Adelbert has met his match this time.\r\nThe outer study is the one with the Chinese crockery in it--big glass\r\ncupboard between the windows.  Then behind his desk is the door that\r\nleads to the inner study--a small room where he keeps papers and\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he not afraid of burglars?\"\r\n\r\n\"Adelbert is no coward.  His worst enemy couldn't say that of him.  He\r\ncan look after himself.  There's a burglar alarm at night.  Besides,\r\nwhat is there for a burglar--unless they got away with all this fancy\r\ncrockery?\"\r\n\r\n\"No good,\" said Shinwell Johnson, with the decided voice of the expert.\r\n\"No fence wants stuff of that sort that you can neither melt nor sell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" said Holmes.  \"Well, now, Miss Winter, if you would call\r\nhere to-morrow evening at five, I would consider in the meanwhile\r\nwhether your suggestion of seeing this lady personally may not be\r\narranged.  I am exceedingly obliged to you for your co-operation.  I\r\nneed not say that my clients will consider liberally----\"\r\n\r\n\"None of that, Mr. Holmes,\" cried the young woman.  \"I am not out for\r\nmoney.  Let me see this man in the mud, and I've got all I worked\r\nfor--in the mud with my foot on his cursed face.  That's my price.  I'm\r\nwith you to-morrow or any other day so long as you are on his track.\r\nPorky here can tell you always where to find me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not see Holmes again until the following evening, when we dined\r\nonce more at our Strand restaurant.  He shrugged his shoulders when I\r\nasked him what luck he had had in his interview.  Then he told the\r\nstory, which I would repeat in this way.  His hard, dry statement needs\r\nsome little editing to soften it into the terms of real life.\r\n\r\n\"There was no difficulty at all about the appointment,\" said Holmes,\r\n\"for the girl glories in showing abject filial obedience in all\r\nsecondary things in an attempt to atone for her flagrant breach of it\r\nin her engagement.  The General 'phoned that all was ready, and the\r\nfiery Miss W. turned up according to schedule, so that at half-past\r\nfive a cab deposited us outside 104 Berkeley Square, where the old\r\nsoldier resides--one of those awful grey London castles which would\r\nmake a church seem frivolous.  A footman showed us into a great\r\nyellow-curtained drawing-room, and there was the lady awaiting us,\r\ndemure, pale, self-contained, as inflexible and remote as a snow image\r\non a mountain.\r\n\r\n\"I don't quite know how to make her clear to you, Watson.  Perhaps you\r\nmay meet her before we are through, and you can use your own gift of\r\nwords.  She is beautiful, but with the ethereal other-world beauty of\r\nsome fanatic whose thoughts are set on high.  I have seen such faces in\r\nthe pictures of the old masters of the Middle Ages.  How a beast-man\r\ncould have laid his vile paws upon such a being of the beyond I cannot\r\nimagine.  You may have noticed how extremes call to each other, the\r\nspiritual to the animal, the cave-man to the angel.  You never saw a\r\nworse case than this.\r\n\r\n\"She knew what we had come for, of course--that villain had lost no\r\ntime in poisoning her mind against us.  Miss Winter's advent rather\r\namazed her, I think, but she waved us into our respective chairs like a\r\nReverend Abbess receiving two rather leprous mendicants.  If your head\r\nis inclined to swell, my dear Watson, take a course of Miss Violet de\r\nMerville.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, sir,' said she, in a voice like the wind from an iceberg, 'your\r\nname is familiar to me.  You have called, as I understand, to malign my\r\nfiancé, Baron Gruner.  It is only by my father's request that I see you\r\nat all, and I warn you in advance that anything you can say could not\r\npossibly have the slightest effect upon my mind.'\r\n\r\n\"I was sorry for her, Watson.  I thought of her for the moment as I\r\nwould have thought of a daughter of my own.  I am not often eloquent.\r\nI use my head, not my heart.  But I really did plead with her with all\r\nthe warmth of words that I could find in my nature.  I pictured to her\r\nthe awful position of the woman who only wakes to a man's character\r\nafter she is his wife--a woman who has to submit to be caressed by\r\nbloody hands and lecherous lips.  I spared her nothing--the shame, the\r\nfear, the agony, the hopelessness of it all.  All my hot words could\r\nnot bring one tinge of colour to those ivory cheeks or one gleam of\r\nemotion to those abstracted eyes.  I thought of what the rascal had\r\nsaid about a post-hypnotic influence.  One could really believe that\r\nshe was living above the earth in some ecstatic dream.  Yet there was\r\nnothing indefinite in her replies.\r\n\r\n\"'I have listened to you with patience, Mr. Holmes,' said she.  'The\r\neffect upon my mind is exactly as predicted.  I am aware that Adelbert,\r\nthat my fiancé, has had a stormy life in which he has incurred bitter\r\nhatreds and most unjust aspersions.  You are only the last of a series\r\nwho have brought their slanders before me.  Possibly you mean well,\r\nthough I learn that you are a paid agent who would have been equally\r\nwilling to act for the Baron as against him.  But in any case I wish\r\nyou to understand once for all that I love him and that he loves me,\r\nand that the opinion of all the world is no more to me than the twitter\r\nof those birds outside the window.  If his noble nature has ever for an\r\ninstant fallen, it may be that I have been specially sent to raise it\r\nto its true and lofty level.  I am not clear,' here she turned her eyes\r\nupon my companion, 'who this young lady may be.'\r\n\r\n\"I was about to answer when the girl broke in like a whirlwind.  If\r\never you saw flame and ice face to face, it was those two women.\r\n\r\n\"'I'll tell you who I am,' she cried, springing out of her chair, her\r\nmouth all twisted with passion--'I am his last mistress.  I am one of a\r\nhundred that he has tempted and used and ruined and thrown into the\r\nrefuse heap, as he will you also.  _Your_ refuse heap is more likely to\r\nbe a grave, and maybe that's the best.  I tell you, you foolish woman,\r\nif you marry this man he'll be the death of you.  It may be a broken\r\nheart or it may be a broken neck, but he'll have you one way or the\r\nother.  It's not out of love for you I'm speaking.  I don't care a\r\ntinker's curse whether you live or die.  It's out of hate for him and\r\nto spite him and to get back on him for what he did to me.  But it's\r\nall the same, and you needn't look at me like that, my fine lady, for\r\nyou may be lower than I am before you are through with it.'\r\n\r\n\"'I should prefer not to discuss such matters,' said Miss de Merville\r\ncoldly.  'Let me say once for all that I am aware of three passages in\r\nmy fiancé's life in which he became entangled with designing women, and\r\nthat I am assured of his hearty repentance for any evil that he may\r\nhave done.'\r\n\r\n\"'Three passages!' screamed my companion.  'You fool!  You unutterable\r\nfool!'\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. Holmes, I beg that you will bring this interview to an end,' said\r\nthe icy voice.  'I have obeyed my father's wish in seeing you, but I am\r\nnot compelled to listen to the ravings of this person.'\r\n\r\n\"With an oath Miss Winter darted forward, and if I had not caught her\r\nwrist she would have clutched this maddening woman by the hair.  I\r\ndragged her towards the door, and was lucky to get her back into the\r\ncab without a public scene, for she was beside herself with rage.  In a\r\ncold way I felt pretty furious myself, Watson, for there was something\r\nindescribably annoying in the calm aloofness and supreme\r\nself-complaisance of the woman whom we were trying to save.  So now\r\nonce again you know exactly how we stand, and it is clear that I must\r\nplan some fresh opening move, for this gambit won't work.  I'll keep in\r\ntouch with you, Watson, for it is more than likely that you will have\r\nyour part to play, though it is just possible that the next move may\r\nlie with them rather than with us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it did.  Their blow fell--or his blow rather, for never could I\r\nbelieve that the lady was privy to it.  I think I could show you the\r\nvery paving-stone upon which I stood when my eyes fell upon the\r\nplacard, and a pang of horror passed through my very soul.  It was\r\nbetween the \"Grand Hotel\" and Charing Cross Station, where a one-legged\r\nnews-vendor displayed his evening papers.  The date was just two days\r\nafter the last conversation.  There, black upon yellow, was the\r\nterrible news-sheet:\r\n\r\n  +-------------+\r\n  |  MURDEROUS  |\r\n  |   ATTACK    |\r\n  |    UPON     |\r\n  |  SHERLOCK   |\r\n  |   HOLMES.   |\r\n  +-------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I stood stunned for some moments.  Then I have a confused\r\nrecollection of snatching at a paper, of the remonstrance of the man,\r\nwhom I had not paid, and, finally, of standing in the doorway of a\r\nchemist's shop while I turned up the fateful paragraph.  This was how\r\nit ran:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We learn with regret that Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the well-known private\r\ndetective, was the victim this morning of a murderous assault which has\r\nleft him in a precarious position.  There are no exact details to hand,\r\nbut the event seems to have occurred about twelve o'clock in Regent\r\nStreet, outside the Café Royal.  The attack was made by two men armed\r\nwith sticks, and Mr. Holmes was beaten about the head and body,\r\nreceiving injuries which the doctors describe as most serious.  He was\r\ncarried to Charing Cross Hospital, and afterwards insisted upon being\r\ntaken to his rooms in Baker Street.  The miscreants who attacked him\r\nappear to have been respectably dressed men, who escaped from the\r\nbystanders by passing through the Café Royal and out into Glasshouse\r\nStreet behind it.  No doubt they belonged to that criminal fraternity\r\nwhich has so often had occasion to bewail the activity and ingenuity of\r\nthe injured man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI need not say that my eyes had hardly glanced over the paragraph\r\nbefore I had sprung into a hansom and was on my way to Baker Street.  I\r\nfound Sir Leslie Oakshott, the famous surgeon in the hall and his\r\nbrougham waiting at the kerb.\r\n\r\n\"No immediate danger,\" was his report.  \"Two lacerated scalp wounds and\r\nsome considerable bruises.  Several stitches have been necessary.\r\nMorphine has been injected and quiet is essential, but an interview of\r\na few minutes would not be absolutely forbidden.\"\r\n\r\nWith this permission I stole into the darkened room.  The sufferer was\r\nwide awake, and I heard my name in a hoarse whisper.  The blind was\r\nthree-quarters down, but one ray of sunlight slanted through and struck\r\nthe bandaged head of the injured man.  A crimson patch had soaked\r\nthrough the white linen compress.  I sat beside him and bent my head.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Watson.  Don't look so scared,\" he muttered in a very weak\r\nvoice.  \"It's not as bad as it seems.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God for that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a bit of a single-stick expert, as you know.  I took most of them\r\non my guard.  It was the second man that was too much for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can I do, Holmes?  Of course, it was that damned fellow who set\r\nthem on.  I'll go and thrash the hide off him if you give the word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good old Watson!  No, we can do nothing there unless the police lay\r\ntheir hands on the men.  But their get-away had been well prepared.  We\r\nmay be sure of that.  Wait a little.  I have my plans.  The first thing\r\nis to exaggerate my injuries.  They'll come to you for news.  Put it on\r\nthick, Watson.  Lucky if I live the week\r\nout--concussion--delirium--what you like!  You can't overdo it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Sir Leslie Oakshott?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he's all right.  He shall see the worst side of me.  I'll look\r\nafter that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  Tell Shinwell Johnson to get that girl out of the way.  Those\r\nbeauties will be after her now.  They know, of course, that she was\r\nwith me in the case.  If they dared to do me in it is not likely they\r\nwill neglect her.  That is urgent.  Do it to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go now.  Anything more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Put my pipe on the table--and the tobacco-slipper.  Right!  Come in\r\neach morning and we will plan our campaign.\"\r\n\r\nI arranged with Johnson that evening to take Miss Winter to a quiet\r\nsuburb and see that she lay low until the danger was past.\r\n\r\nFor six days the public were under the impression that Holmes was at\r\nthe door of death.  The bulletins were very grave and there were\r\nsinister paragraphs in the papers.  My continual visits assured me that\r\nit was not so bad as that.  His wiry constitution and his determined\r\nwill were working wonders.  He was recovering fast, and I had\r\nsuspicions at times that he was really finding himself faster than he\r\npretended, even to me.  There was a curious secretive streak in the man\r\nwhich led to many dramatic effects, but left even his closest friend\r\nguessing as to what his exact plans might be.  He pushed to an extreme\r\nthe axiom that the only safe plotter was he who plotted alone.  I was\r\nnearer him than anyone else, and yet I was always conscious of the gap\r\nbetween.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh day the stitches were taken out, in spite of which there\r\nwas a report of erysipelas in the evening papers.  The same evening\r\npapers had an announcement which I was bound, sick or well, to carry to\r\nmy friend.  It was simply that among the passengers on the Cunard boat\r\n_Ruritania_, starting from Liverpool on Friday, was the Baron Adelbert\r\nGruner, who had some important financial business to settle in the\r\nStates before his impending wedding to Miss Violet de Merville, only\r\ndaughter of, etc., etc.  Holmes listened to the news with a cold,\r\nconcentrated look upon his pale face, which told me that it hit him\r\nhard.\r\n\r\n\"Friday!\" he cried.  \"Only three clear days.  I believe the rascal\r\nwants to put himself out of danger's way.  But he won't, Watson!  By\r\nthe Lord Harry, he won't!  Now, Watson, I want you to do something for\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am here to be used, Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, spend the next twenty-four hours in an intensive study of\r\nChinese pottery.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave no explanations and I asked for none.  By long experience I had\r\nlearned the wisdom of obedience.  But when I had left his room I walked\r\ndown Baker Street, revolving in my head how on earth I was to carry out\r\nso strange an order.  Finally I drove to the London Library in St.\r\nJames's Square, put the matter to my friend Lomax, the sub-librarian,\r\nand departed to my rooms with a goodly volume under my arm.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the barrister who crams up a case with such care that\r\nhe can examine an expert witness upon the Monday has forgotten all his\r\nforced knowledge before the Saturday.  Certainly I should not like now\r\nto pose as an authority upon ceramics.  And yet all that evening, and\r\nall that night with a short interval for rest, and all next morning I\r\nwas sucking in knowledge and committing names to memory.  There I\r\nlearned of the hall-marks of the great artist-decorators, of the\r\nmystery of cyclical dates, the marks of the Hung-wu and the beauties of\r\nthe Yung-lo, the writings of Tang-ying, and the glories of the\r\nprimitive period of the Sung and the Yuan.  I was charged with all this\r\ninformation when I called upon Holmes next evening.  He was out of bed\r\nnow, though you would not have guessed it from the published reports,\r\nand he sat with his much-bandaged head resting upon his hand in the\r\ndepth of his favourite arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Holmes,\" I said, \"if one believed the papers you are dying.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said he, \"is the very impression which I intended to convey.\r\nAnd now, Watson, have you learned your lessons?\"\r\n\r\n\"At least I have tried to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good.  You could keep up an intelligent conversation on the subject?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe I could.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then hand me that little box from the mantel-piece.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened the lid and took out a small object most carefully wrapped in\r\nsome fine Eastern silk.  This he unfolded, and disclosed a delicate\r\nlittle saucer of the most beautiful deep-blue colour.\r\n\r\n\"It needs careful handling, Watson.  This is the real egg-shell pottery\r\nof the Ming dynasty.  No finer piece ever passed through Christie's.  A\r\ncomplete set of this would be worth a king's ransom--in fact, it is\r\ndoubtful if there is a complete set outside the Imperial palace of\r\nPeking.  The sight of this would drive a real connoisseur wild.\"\r\n\r\n\"What am I to do with it?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes handed me a card upon which was printed: \"Dr. Hill Barton, 369\r\nHalf Moon Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is your name for the evening, Watson.  You will call upon Baron\r\nGruner.  I know something of his habits, and at half-past eight he\r\nwould probably be disengaged.  A note will tell him in advance that you\r\nare about to call, and you will say that you are bringing him a\r\nspecimen of an absolutely unique set of Ming china.  You may as well be\r\na medical man, since that is a part which you can play without\r\nduplicity.  You are a collector, this set has come your way, you have\r\nheard of the Baron's interest in the subject, and you are not averse to\r\nselling at a price.\"\r\n\r\n\"What price?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well asked, Watson.  You would certainly fall down badly if you did\r\nnot know the value of your own wares.  This saucer was got for me by\r\nSir James, and comes, I understand, from the collection of his client.\r\nYou will not exaggerate if you say that it could hardly be matched in\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could perhaps suggest that the set should be valued by an expert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent, Watson!  You scintillate to-day.  Suggest Christie or\r\nSotheby.  Your delicacy prevents your putting a price for yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if he won't see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, he will see you.  He has the collection mania in its most\r\nacute form--and especially on this subject, on which he is an\r\nacknowledged authority.  Sit down, Watson, and I will dictate the\r\nletter.  No answer needed.  You will merely say that you are coming,\r\nand why.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an admirable document, short, courteous, and stimulating to the\r\ncuriosity of the connoisseur.  A district messenger was duly dispatched\r\nwith it.  On the same evening, with the precious saucer in my hand and\r\nthe card of Dr. Hill Barton in my pocket, I set off on my own adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beautiful house and grounds indicated that Baron Gruner was, as Sir\r\nJames had said, a man of considerable wealth.  A long winding drive,\r\nwith banks of rare shrubs on either side, opened out into a great\r\ngravelled square adorned with statues.  The place had been built by a\r\nSouth African gold king in the days of the great boom, and the long,\r\nlow house with the turrets at the corners, though an architectural\r\nnightmare, was imposing in its size and solidity.  A butler who would\r\nhave adorned a bench of bishops showed me in, and handed me over to a\r\nplush-clad footman, who ushered me into the Baron's presence.\r\n\r\nHe was standing at the open front of a great case which stood between\r\nthe windows, and which contained part of his Chinese collection.  He\r\nturned as I entered with a small brown vase in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Pray sit down, doctor,\" said he.  \"I was looking over my own treasures\r\nand wondering whether I could really afford to add to them.  This\r\nlittle Tang specimen, which dates from the seventh century, would\r\nprobably interest you.  I am sure you never saw finer workmanship or a\r\nricher glaze.  Have you the Ming saucer with you of which you spoke?\"\r\n\r\nI carefully unpacked it and handed it to him.  He seated himself at his\r\ndesk, pulled over the lamp, for it was growing dark, and set himself to\r\nexamine it.  As he did so the yellow light beat upon his own features,\r\nand I was able to study them at my ease.\r\n\r\nHe was certainly a remarkably handsome man.  His European reputation\r\nfor beauty was fully deserved.  In figure he was not more than of\r\nmiddle size, but was built upon graceful and active lines.  His face\r\nwas swarthy, almost Oriental, with large, dark, languorous eyes which\r\nmight easily hold an irresistible fascination for women.  His hair and\r\nmoustache were raven black, the latter short, pointed, and carefully\r\nwaxed.  His features were regular and pleasing, save only his straight,\r\nthin-lipped mouth.  If ever I saw a murderer's mouth it was there--a\r\ncruel, hard gash in the face, compressed, inexorable, and terrible.  He\r\nwas ill-advised to train his moustache away from it, for it was\r\nNature's danger-signal, set as a warning to his victims.  His voice was\r\nengaging and his manners perfect.  In age I should have put him at\r\nlittle over thirty, though his record afterwards showed that he was\r\nforty-two.\r\n\r\n\"Very fine--very fine indeed!\" he said at last.  \"And you say you have\r\na set of six to correspond.  What puzzles me is that I should not have\r\nheard of such magnificent specimens.  I only know of one in England to\r\nmatch this, and it is certainly not likely to be in the market.  Would\r\nit be indiscreet if I were to ask you, Dr. Hill Barton, how you\r\nobtained this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it really matter?\" I asked, with as careless an air as I could\r\nmuster.  \"You can see that the piece is genuine, and, as to the value,\r\nI am content to take an expert's valuation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very mysterious,\" said he, with a quick, suspicious flash of his dark\r\neyes.  \"In dealing with objects of such value, one naturally wishes to\r\nknow all about the transaction.  That the piece is genuine is certain.\r\nI have no doubts at all about that.  But suppose--I am bound to take\r\nevery possibility into account--that it should prove afterwards that\r\nyou had no right to sell?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would guarantee you against any claim of the sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, of course, would open up the question as to what your guarantee\r\nwas worth.\"\r\n\r\n\"My bankers would answer that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.  And yet the whole transaction strikes me as rather unusual.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can do business or not,\" said I, with indifference.  \"I have given\r\nyou the first offer as I understood that you were a connoisseur, but I\r\nshall have no difficulty in other quarters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you I was a connoisseur?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was aware that you had written a book upon the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you read the book?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, this becomes more and more difficult for me to understand!\r\nYou are a connoisseur and collector with a very valuable piece in your\r\ncollection, and yet you have never troubled to consult the one book\r\nwhich would have told you of the real meaning and value of what you\r\nheld.  How do you explain that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a very busy man.  I am a doctor in practice.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is no answer.  If a man has a hobby he follows it up, whatever\r\nhis other pursuits may be.  You said in your note that you were a\r\nconnoisseur.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might I ask you a few questions to test you?  I am obliged to tell\r\nyou, doctor--if you are indeed a doctor--that the incident becomes more\r\nand more suspicious.  I would ask you what do you know of the Emperor\r\nShomu and how do you associate him with the Shoso-in near Nara?  Dear\r\nme, does that puzzle you?  Tell me a little about the Northern Wei\r\ndynasty and its place in the history of ceramics.\"\r\n\r\nI sprang from my chair in simulated anger.\r\n\r\n\"This is intolerable, sir,\" said I.  \"I came here to do you a favour,\r\nand not to be examined as if I were a schoolboy.  My knowledge on these\r\nsubjects may be second only to your own, but I certainly shall not\r\nanswer questions which have been put in so offensive a way.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me steadily.  The languor had gone from his eyes.  They\r\nsuddenly glared.  There was a gleam of teeth from between those cruel\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\"What is the game?  You are here as a spy.  You are an emissary of\r\nHolmes.  This is a trick that you are playing upon me.  The fellow is\r\ndying, I hear, so he sends his tools to keep watch upon me.  You've\r\nmade your way in here without leave, and, by God! you may find it\r\nharder to get out than to get in.\"\r\n\r\nHe had sprung to his feet, and I stepped back, bracing myself for an\r\nattack, for the man was beside himself with rage.  He may have\r\nsuspected me from the first; certainly this cross-examination had shown\r\nhim the truth; but it was clear that I could not hope to deceive him.\r\nHe dived his hand into a side-drawer and rummaged furiously.  Then\r\nsomething struck upon his ear, for he stood listening intently.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he cried.  \"Ah!\" and dashed into the room behind him.\r\n\r\nTwo steps took me to the open door, and my mind will ever carry a clear\r\npicture of the scene within.  The window leading out to the garden was\r\nwide open.  Beside it, looking like some terrible ghost, his head girt\r\nwith bloody bandages, his face drawn and white, stood Sherlock Holmes.\r\nThe next instant he was through the gap, and I heard the crash of his\r\nbody among the laurel bushes outside.  With a howl of rage the master\r\nof the house rushed after him to the open window.\r\n\r\nAnd then!  It was done in an instant, and yet I clearly saw it.  An\r\narm--a woman's arm--shot out from among the leaves.  At the same\r\ninstant the Baron uttered a horrible cry--a yell which will always ring\r\nin my memory.  He clapped his two hands to his face and rushed round\r\nthe room, beating his head horribly against the walls.  Then he fell\r\nupon the carpet, rolling and writhing, while scream after scream\r\nresounded through the house.\r\n\r\n\"Water!  For God's sake, water!\" was his cry.\r\n\r\nI seized a carafe from a side-table and rushed to his aid.  At the same\r\nmoment the butler and several footmen ran in from the hall.  I remember\r\nthat one of them fainted as I knelt by the injured man and turned that\r\nawful face to the light of the lamp.  The vitriol was eating into it\r\neverywhere and dripping from the ears and the chin.  One eye was\r\nalready white and glazed.  The other was red and inflamed.  The\r\nfeatures which I had admired a few minutes before were now like some\r\nbeautiful painting over which the artist has passed a wet and foul\r\nsponge.  They were blurred, discoloured, inhuman, terrible.\r\n\r\nIn a few words I explained exactly what had occurred, so far as the\r\nvitriol attack was concerned.  Some had climbed through the window and\r\nothers had rushed out on to the lawn, but it was dark and it had begun\r\nto rain.  Between his screams the victim raged and raved against the\r\navenger.  \"It was that hell-cat, Kitty Winter!\" he cried.  \"Oh, the\r\nshe-devil!  She shall pay for it!  She shall pay!  Oh, God in heaven,\r\nthis pain is more than I can bear!\"\r\n\r\nI bathed his face in oil, put cotton wadding on the raw surfaces, and\r\nadministered a hypodermic of morphia.  All suspicion of me had passed\r\nfrom his mind in the presence of this shock, and he clung to my hands\r\nas if I might have the power even yet to clear those dead-fish eyes\r\nwhich gazed up at me.  I could have wept over the ruin had I not\r\nremembered very clearly the vile life which had led up to so hideous a\r\nchange.  It was loathsome to feel the pawing of his burning hands, and\r\nI was relieved when his family surgeon, closely followed by a\r\nspecialist, came to relieve me of my charge.  An inspector of police\r\nhad also arrived, and to him I handed my real card.  It would have been\r\nuseless as well as foolish to do otherwise, for I was nearly as well\r\nknown by sight at the Yard as Holmes himself.  Then I left that house\r\nof gloom and terror.  Within an hour I was at Baker Street.\r\n\r\nHolmes was seated in his familiar chair, looking very pale and\r\nexhausted.  Apart from his injuries, even his iron nerves had been\r\nshocked by the events of the evening, and he listened with horror to my\r\naccount of the Baron's transformation.\r\n\r\n\"The wages of sin, Watson--the wages of sin!\" said he.  \"Sooner or\r\nlater it will always come.  God knows, there was sin enough,\" he added,\r\ntaking up a brown volume from the table.  \"Here is the book the woman\r\ntalked of.  If this will not break off the marriage, nothing ever\r\ncould.  But it will, Watson.  It must.  No self-respecting woman could\r\nstand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is his love diary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Or his lust diary.  Call it what you will.  The moment the woman told\r\nus of it I realized what a tremendous weapon was there, if we could but\r\nlay our hands on it.  I said nothing at the time to indicate my\r\nthoughts, for this woman might have given it away.  But I brooded over\r\nit.  Then this assault upon me gave me the chance of letting the Baron\r\nthink that no precautions need be taken against me.  That was all to\r\nthe good.  I would have waited a little longer, but his visit to\r\nAmerica forced my hand.  He would never have left so compromising a\r\ndocument behind him.  Therefore we had to act at once.  Burglary at\r\nnight is impossible.  He takes precautions.  But there was a chance in\r\nthe evening if I could only be sure that his attention was engaged.\r\nThat was where you and your blue saucer came in.  But I had to be sure\r\nof the position of the book, and I knew I had only a few minutes in\r\nwhich to act, for my time was limited by your knowledge of Chinese\r\npottery.  Therefore I gathered the girl up at the last moment.  How\r\ncould I guess what the little packet was that she carried so carefully\r\nunder her cloak?  I thought she had come altogether on my business, but\r\nit seems she had some of her own.\"\r\n\r\n\"He guessed I came from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feared he would.  But you held him in play just long enough for me\r\nto get the book, though not long enough for an unobserved escape.  Ah,\r\nSir James, I am very glad you have come!\"\r\n\r\nOur courtly friend had appeared in answer to a previous summons.  He\r\nlistened with the deepest attention to Holmes's account of what had\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\n\"You have done wonders--wonders!\" he cried, when he had heard the\r\nnarrative.  \"But if these injuries are as terrible as Dr. Watson\r\ndescribes, then surely our purpose of thwarting the marriage is\r\nsufficiently gained without the use of this horrible book.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Women of the de Merville type do not act like that.  She would love\r\nhim the more as a disfigured martyr.  No, no.  It is his moral side,\r\nnot his physical, which we have to destroy.  That book will bring her\r\nback to earth--and I know nothing else that could.  It is in his own\r\nwriting.  She cannot get past it.\"\r\n\r\nSir James carried away both it and the precious saucer.  As I was\r\nmyself overdue, I went down with him into the street.  A brougham was\r\nwaiting for him.  He sprang in, gave a hurried order to the cockaded\r\ncoachman, and drove swiftly away.  He flung his overcoat half out of\r\nthe window to cover the armorial bearings upon the panel, but I had\r\nseen them in the glare of our fanlight none the less.  I gasped with\r\nsurprise.  Then I turned back and ascended the stair to Holmes's room.\r\n\r\n\"I have found out who our client is,\" I cried, bursting with my great\r\nnews.  \"Why, Holmes, it is----\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a loyal friend and a chivalrous gentleman,\" said Holmes, holding\r\nup a restraining hand.  \"Let that now and for ever be enough for us.\"\r\n\r\nI do not know how the incriminating book was used.  Sir James may have\r\nmanaged it.  Or it is more probable that so delicate a task was\r\nentrusted to the young lady's father.  The effect, at any rate, was all\r\nthat could be desired.  Three days later appeared a paragraph in _The\r\nMorning Post_ to say that the marriage between Baron Adelbert Gruner\r\nand Miss Violet de Merville would not take place.  The same paper had\r\nthe first police-court hearing of the proceedings against Miss Kitty\r\nWinter on the grave charge of vitriol-throwing.  Such extenuating\r\ncircumstances came out in the trial that the sentence, as will be\r\nremembered, was the lowest that was possible for such an offence.\r\nSherlock Holmes was threatened with a prosecution for burglary, but\r\nwhen an object is good and a client is sufficiently illustrious, even\r\nthe rigid British law becomes human and elastic.  My friend has not yet\r\nstood in the dock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BLANCHED SOLDIER\r\n\r\nThe ideas of my friend Watson, though limited, are exceedingly\r\npertinacious.  For a long time he has worried me to write an experience\r\nof my own.  Perhaps I have rather invited this persecution, since I\r\nhave often had occasion to point out to him how superficial are his own\r\naccounts and to accuse him of pandering to popular taste instead of\r\nconfining himself rigidly to facts and figures.  \"Try it yourself,\r\nHolmes!\" he has retorted, and I am compelled to admit that, having\r\ntaken my pen in my hand, I do begin to realize that the matter must be\r\npresented in such a way as may interest the reader.  The following case\r\ncan hardly fail to do so, as it is among the strangest happenings in my\r\ncollection, though it chanced that Watson had no note of it in his\r\ncollection.  Speaking of my old friend and biographer, I would take\r\nthis opportunity to remark that if I burden myself with a companion in\r\nmy various little inquiries it is not done out of sentiment or caprice,\r\nbut it is that Watson has some remarkable characteristics of his own,\r\nto which in his modesty he has given small attention amid his\r\nexaggerated estimates of my own performances.  A confederate who\r\nforesees your conclusions and course of action is always dangerous, but\r\none to whom each development comes as a perpetual surprise, and to whom\r\nthe future is always a closed book, is, indeed, an ideal helpmate.\r\n\r\nI find from my notebook that it was in January, 1903, just after the\r\nconclusion of the Boer War, that I had my visit from Mr. James M. Dodd,\r\na big, fresh, sunburned, upstanding Briton.  The good Watson had at\r\nthat time deserted me for a wife, the only selfish action which I can\r\nrecall in our association.  I was alone.\r\n\r\nIt is my habit to sit with my back to the window and to place my\r\nvisitors in the opposite chair, where the light falls full upon them.\r\nMr. James M. Dodd seemed somewhat at a loss how to begin the interview.\r\nI did not attempt to help him, for his silence gave me more time for\r\nobservation.  I have found it wise to impress clients with a sense of\r\npower, and so I gave him some of my conclusions.\r\n\r\n\"From South Africa, sir, I perceive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" he answered, with some surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Imperial Yeomanry, I fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Middlesex Corps, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so.  Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard.\"\r\n\r\nI smiled at his bewildered expression.\r\n\r\n\"When a gentleman of virile appearance enters my room with such tan\r\nupon his face as an English sun could never give, and with his\r\nhandkerchief in his sleeve instead of in his pocket, it is not\r\ndifficult to place him.  You wear a short beard, which shows that you\r\nwere not a regular.  You have the cut of a riding-man.  As to\r\nMiddlesex, your card has already shown me that you are a stockbroker\r\nfrom Throgmorton Street.  What other regiment would you join?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no more than you, but I have trained myself to notice what I\r\nsee.  However, Mr. Dodd, it was not to discuss the science of\r\nobservation that you called upon me this morning.  What has been\r\nhappening at Tuxbury Old Park?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes----!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir, there is no mystery.  Your letter came with that heading,\r\nand as you fixed this appointment in very pressing terms it was clear\r\nthat something sudden and important had occurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed.  But the letter was written in the afternoon, and a good\r\ndeal has happened since then.  If Colonel Emsworth had not kicked me\r\nout----\"\r\n\r\n\"Kicked you out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that was what it amounted to.  He is a hard nail, is Colonel\r\nEmsworth.  The greatest martinet in the Army in his day, and it was a\r\nday of rough language, too.  I couldn't have stuck the Colonel if it\r\nhad not been for Godfrey's sake.\"\r\n\r\nI lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you will explain what you are talking about.\"\r\n\r\nMy client grinned mischievously.\r\n\r\n\"I had got into the way of supposing that you knew everything without\r\nbeing told,\" said he.  \"But I will give you the facts, and I hope to\r\nGod that you will be able to tell me what they mean.  I've been awake\r\nall night puzzling my brain, and the more I think the more incredible\r\ndoes it become.\r\n\r\n\"When I joined up in January, 1901--just two years ago--young Godfrey\r\nEmsworth had joined the same squadron.  He was Colonel Emsworth's only\r\nson--Emsworth, the Crimean V.C.--and he had the fighting blood in him,\r\nso it is no wonder he volunteered.  There was not a finer lad in the\r\nregiment.  We formed a friendship--the sort of friendship which can\r\nonly be made when one lives the same life and shares the same joys and\r\nsorrows.  He was my mate--and that means a good deal in the Army.  We\r\ntook the rough and the smooth together for a year of hard fighting.\r\nThen he was hit with a bullet from an elephant gun in the action near\r\nDiamond Hill outside Pretoria.  I got one letter from the hospital at\r\nCape Town and one from Southampton.  Since then not a word--not one\r\nword, Mr. Holmes, for six months and more, and he my closest pal.\r\n\r\n\"Well, when the war was over, and we all got back, I wrote to his\r\nfather and asked where Godfrey was.  No answer.  I waited a bit and\r\nthen I wrote again.  This time I had a reply, short and gruff.  Godfrey\r\nhad gone on a voyage round the world, and it was not likely that he\r\nwould be back for a year.  That was all.\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't satisfied, Mr. Holmes.  The whole thing seemed to me so\r\ndamned unnatural.  He was a good lad and he would not drop a pal like\r\nthat.  It was not like him.  Then, again, I happened to know that he\r\nwas heir to a lot of money, and also that his father and he did not\r\nalways hit it off too well.  The old man was sometimes a bully, and\r\nyoung Godfrey had too much spirit to stand it.  No, I wasn't satisfied,\r\nand I determined that I would get to the root of the matter.  It\r\nhappened, however, that my own affairs needed a lot of straightening\r\nout, after two years' absence, and so it is only this week that I have\r\nbeen able to take up Godfrey's case again.  But since I have taken it\r\nup I mean to drop everything in order to see it through.\"\r\n\r\nMr. James M. Dodd appeared to be the sort of person whom it would be\r\nbetter to have as a friend than as an enemy.  His blue eyes were stern\r\nand his square jaw had set hard as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what have you done?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"My first move was to get down to his home, Tuxbury Old Park, near\r\nBedford, and to see for myself how the ground lay.  I wrote to the\r\nmother, therefore--I had had quite enough of the curmudgeon of a\r\nfather--and I made a clean frontal attack: Godfrey was my chum, I had a\r\ngreat deal of interest which I might tell her of our common\r\nexperiences, I should be in the neighbourhood, would there be any\r\nobjection, et cetera?  In reply I had quite an amiable answer from her\r\nand an offer to put me up for the night.  That was what took me down on\r\nMonday.\r\n\r\n\"Tuxbury Old Hall is inaccessible--five miles from anywhere.  There was\r\nno trap at the station, so I had to walk, carrying my suit-case, and it\r\nwas nearly dark before I arrived.  It is a great wandering house,\r\nstanding in a considerable park.  I should judge it was of all sorts of\r\nages and styles, starting on a half-timbered Elizabethan foundation and\r\nending in a Victorian portico.  Inside it was all panelling and\r\ntapestry and half-effaced old pictures, a house of shadows and mystery.\r\nThere was a butler, old Ralph, who seemed about the same age as the\r\nhouse and there was his wife, who might have been older.  She had been\r\nGodfrey's nurse, and I had heard him speak of her as second only to his\r\nmother in his affections, so I was drawn to her in spite of her queer\r\nappearance.  The mother I liked also--a gentle little white mouse of a\r\nwoman.  It was only the Colonel himself whom I barred.\r\n\r\n\"We had a bit of a barney right away, and I should have walked back to\r\nthe station if I had not felt that it might be playing his game for me\r\nto do so.  I was shown straight into his study, and there I found him,\r\na huge, bow-backed man with a smoky skin and a straggling grey beard,\r\nseated behind his littered desk.  A red-veined nose jutted out like a\r\nvulture's beak, and two fierce grey eyes glared at me from under tufted\r\nbrows.  I could understand now why Godfrey seldom spoke of his father.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, sir,' said he in a rasping voice.  'I should be interested to\r\nknow the real reasons for this visit.'\r\n\r\n\"I answered that I had explained them in my letter to his wife.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, yes; you said that you had known Godfrey in Africa.  We have, of\r\ncourse, only your word for that.'\r\n\r\n\"'I have his letters to me in my pocket.'\r\n\r\n\"'Kindly let me see them.'\r\n\r\n\"He glanced at the two which I handed him, and then he tossed them back.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, what then?' he asked.\r\n\r\n\"'I was fond of your son Godfrey, sir.  Many ties and memories united\r\nus.  Is it not natural that I should wonder at his sudden silence and\r\nshould wish to know what has become of him?'\r\n\r\n\"'I have some recollection, sir, that I had already corresponded with\r\nyou and had told you what had become of him.  He has gone upon a voyage\r\nround the world.  His health was in a poor way after his African\r\nexperiences, and both his mother and I were of opinion that complete\r\nrest and change were needed.  Kindly pass that explanation on to any\r\nother friends who may be interested in the matter.'\r\n\r\n\"'Certainly,' I answered.  'But perhaps you would have the goodness to\r\nlet me have the name of the steamer and of the line by which he sailed,\r\ntogether with the date.  I have no doubt that I should be able to get a\r\nletter through to him.'\r\n\r\n\"My request seemed both to puzzle and to irritate my host.  His great\r\neyebrows came down over his eyes and he tapped his fingers impatiently\r\non the table.  He looked up at last with the expression of one who has\r\nseen his adversary make a dangerous move at chess, and has decided how\r\nto meet it.\r\n\r\n\"'Many people, Mr. Dodd,' said he, 'would take offence at your infernal\r\npertinacity and would think that this insistence had reached the point\r\nof damned impertinence.'\r\n\r\n\"'You must put it down, sir, to my real love for your son.'\r\n\r\n\"'Exactly.  I have already made every allowance upon that score.  I\r\nmust ask you, however, to drop these inquiries.  Every family has its\r\nown inner knowledge and its own motives, which cannot always be made\r\nclear to outsiders, however well-intentioned.  My wife is anxious to\r\nhear something of Godfrey's past which you are in a position to tell\r\nher, but I would ask you to let the present and the future alone.  Such\r\ninquiries serve no useful purpose, sir, and place us in a delicate and\r\ndifficult position.'\r\n\r\n\"So I came to a dead end, Mr. Holmes.  There was no getting past it.  I\r\ncould only pretend to accept the situation and register a vow inwardly\r\nthat I would never rest until my friend's fate had been cleared up.  It\r\nwas a dull evening.  We dined quietly, the three of us, in a gloomy,\r\nfaded old room.  The lady questioned me eagerly about her son, but the\r\nold man seemed morose and depressed.  I was so bored by the whole\r\nproceeding that I made an excuse as soon as I decently could and\r\nretired to my bedroom.  It was a large, bare room on the ground floor,\r\nas gloomy as the rest of the house, but after a year of sleeping upon\r\nthe veldt, Mr. Holmes, one is not too particular about one's quarters.\r\nI opened the curtains and looked out into the garden, remarking that it\r\nwas a fine night with a bright half-moon.  Then I sat down by the\r\nroaring fire with the lamp on a table beside me, and endeavoured to\r\ndistract my mind with a novel.  I was interrupted, however, by Ralph,\r\nthe old butler, who came in with a fresh supply of coals.\r\n\r\n\"'I thought you might run short in the night-time, sir.  It is bitter\r\nweather and these rooms are cold.'\r\n\r\n\"He hesitated before leaving the room, and when I looked round he was\r\nstanding facing me with a wistful look upon his wrinkled face.\r\n\r\n\"'Beg your pardon, sir, but I could not help hearing what you said of\r\nyoung Master Godfrey at dinner.  You know, sir, that my wife nursed\r\nhim, and so I may say I am his foster-father.  It's natural we should\r\ntake an interest.  And you say he carried himself well, sir?'\r\n\r\n\"'There was no braver man in the regiment.  He pulled me out once from\r\nunder the rifles of the Boers, or maybe I should not be here.'\r\n\r\n\"The old butler rubbed his skinny hands.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, sir, yes, that is Master Godfrey all over.  He was always\r\ncourageous.  There's not a tree in the park, sir, that he has not\r\nclimbed.  Nothing would stop him.  He was a fine boy--and oh, sir, he\r\nwas a fine man.'\r\n\r\n\"I sprang to my feet.\r\n\r\n\"'Look here!' I cried.  'You say he was.  You speak as if he were dead.\r\nWhat is all this mystery?  What has become of Godfrey Emsworth?'\r\n\r\n\"I gripped the old man by the shoulder, but he shrank away.\r\n\r\n\"'I don't know what you mean, sir.  Ask the master about Master\r\nGodfrey.  He knows.  It is not for me to interfere.'\r\n\r\n\"He was leaving the room, but I held his arm.\r\n\r\n\"'Listen,' I said.  'You are going to answer one question before you\r\nleave if I have to hold you all night.  Is Godfrey dead?'\r\n\r\n\"He could not face my eyes.  He was like a man hypnotized.  The answer\r\nwas dragged from his lips.  It was a terrible and unexpected one.\r\n\r\n\"'I wish to God he was!' he cried, and, tearing himself free, he dashed\r\nfrom the room.\r\n\r\n\"You will think, Mr. Holmes, that I returned to my chair in no very\r\nhappy state of mind.  The old man's words seemed to me to bear only one\r\ninterpretation.  Clearly my poor friend had become involved in some\r\ncriminal, or, at the least, disreputable, transaction which touched the\r\nfamily honour.  That stern old man had sent his son away and hidden him\r\nfrom the world lest some scandal should come to light.  Godfrey was a\r\nreckless fellow.  He was easily influenced by those around him.  No\r\ndoubt he had fallen into bad hands and been misled to his ruin.  It was\r\na piteous business, if it was indeed so, but even now it was my duty to\r\nhunt him out and see if I could aid him.  I was anxiously pondering the\r\nmatter when I looked up, and there was Godfrey Emsworth standing before\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nMy client had paused as one in deep emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Pray continue,\" I said.  \"Your problem presents some very unusual\r\nfeatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was outside the window, Mr. Holmes, with his face pressed against\r\nthe glass.  I have told you that I looked out at the night.  When I did\r\nso, I left the curtains partly open.  His figure was framed in this\r\ngap.  The window came down to the ground and I could see the whole\r\nlength of it, but it was his face which held my gaze.  He was deadly\r\npale--never have I seen a man so white.  I reckon ghosts may look like\r\nthat; but his eyes met mine, and they were the eyes of a living man.\r\nHe sprang back when he saw that I was looking at him, and he vanished\r\ninto the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"There was something shocking about the man, Mr. Holmes.  It wasn't\r\nmerely that ghastly face glimmering as white as cheese in the darkness.\r\nIt was more subtle than that--something slinking, something furtive,\r\nsomething guilty--something very unlike the frank, manly lad that I had\r\nknown.  It left a feeling of horror in my mind.\r\n\r\n\"But when a man has been soldiering for a year or two with brother Boer\r\nas a playmate, he keeps his nerve and acts quickly.  Godfrey had hardly\r\nvanished before I was at the window.  There was an awkward catch, and I\r\nwas some little time before I could throw it up.  Then I nipped through\r\nand ran down the garden path in the direction that I thought he might\r\nhave taken.\r\n\r\n\"It was a long path and the light was not very good but it seemed to me\r\nsomething was moving ahead of me.  I ran on and called his name, but it\r\nwas no use.  When I got to the end of the path there were several\r\nothers branching in different directions to various outhouses.  I stood\r\nhesitating, and as I did so I heard distinctly the sound of a closing\r\ndoor.  It was not behind me in the house, but ahead of me, somewhere in\r\nthe darkness.  That was enough, Mr. Holmes, to assure me that what I\r\nhad seen was not a vision.  Godfrey had run away from me and he had\r\nshut a door behind him.  Of that I was certain.\r\n\r\n\"There was nothing more I could do, and I spent an uneasy night turning\r\nthe matter over in my mind and trying to find some theory which would\r\ncover the facts.  Next day I found the Colonel rather more\r\nconciliatory, and as his wife remarked that there were some places of\r\ninterest in the neighbourhood, it gave me an opening to ask whether my\r\npresence for one more night would incommode them.  A somewhat grudging\r\nacquiescence from the old man gave me a clear day in which to make my\r\nobservations.  I was already perfectly convinced that Godfrey was in\r\nhiding somewhere near, but where and why remained to be solved.\r\n\r\n\"The house was so large and so rambling that a regiment might be hid\r\naway in it and no one the wiser.  If the secret lay there, it was\r\ndifficult for me to penetrate it.  But the door which I had heard close\r\nwas certainly not in the house.  I must explore the garden and see what\r\nI could find.  There was no difficulty in the way, for the old people\r\nwere busy in their own fashion and left me to my own devices.\r\n\r\n\"There were several small outhouses, but at the end of the garden there\r\nwas a detached building of some size--large enough for a gardener's or\r\na gamekeeper's residence.  Could this be the place whence the sound of\r\nthat shutting door had come?  I approached it in a careless fashion, as\r\nthough I were strolling aimlessly round the grounds.  As I did so, a\r\nsmall, brisk, bearded man in a black coat and bowler hat--not at all\r\nthe gardener type--came out of the door.  To my surprise, he locked it\r\nafter him and put the key in his pocket.  Then he looked at me with\r\nsome surprise on his face.\r\n\r\n\"'Are you a visitor here?' he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I explained that I was and that I was a friend of Godfrey's.\r\n\r\n\"'What a pity that he should be away on his travels, for he would have\r\nso liked to see me,' I continued.\r\n\r\n\"'Quite so.  Exactly,' said he, with a rather guilty air.  'No doubt\r\nyou will renew your visit at some more propitious time.'  He passed on,\r\nbut when I turned I observed that he was standing watching me,\r\nhalf-concealed by the laurels at the far end of the garden.\r\n\r\n\"I had a good look at the little house as I passed it, but the windows\r\nwere heavily curtained, and, so far as one could see, it was empty.  I\r\nmight spoil my own game, and even be ordered off the premises, if I\r\nwere too audacious, for I was still conscious that I was being watched.\r\nTherefore, I strolled back to the house and waited for night before I\r\nwent on with my inquiry.  When all was dark and quiet, I slipped out of\r\nmy window and made my way as silently as possible to the mysterious\r\nlodge.\r\n\r\n\"I have said that it was heavily curtained, but now I found that the\r\nwindows were shuttered as well.  Some light, however, was breaking\r\nthrough one of them, so I concentrated my attention upon this.  I was\r\nin luck, for the curtain had not been quite closed, and there was a\r\ncrack in the shutter so that I could see the inside of the room.  It\r\nwas a cheery place enough, a bright lamp and a blazing fire.  Opposite\r\nto me was seated the little man whom I had seen in the morning.  He was\r\nsmoking a pipe and reading a paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"What paper?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nMy client seemed annoyed at the interruption of his narrative.\r\n\r\n\"Can it matter?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is most essential.\"\r\n\r\n\"I really took no notice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly you observed whether it was a broad-leafed paper or of that\r\nsmaller type which one associates with weeklies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now that you mention it, it was not large.  It might have been _The\r\nSpectator_.  However, I had little thought to spare upon such details,\r\nfor a second man was seated with his back to the window, and I could\r\nswear that this second man was Godfrey.  I could not see his face, but\r\nI knew the familiar slope of his shoulders.  He was leaning upon his\r\nelbow in an attitude of great melancholy, his body turned towards the\r\nfire.  I was hesitating as to what I should do when there was a sharp\r\ntap on my shoulder, and there was Colonel Emsworth beside me.\r\n\r\n\"'This way, sir!' said he in a low voice.  He walked in silence to the\r\nhouse and I followed him into my own bedroom.  He had picked up a\r\ntimetable in the hall.\r\n\r\n\"'There is a train to London at eight-thirty,' said he.  'The trap will\r\nbe at the door at eight.'\r\n\r\n\"He was white with rage, and, indeed, I felt myself in so difficult a\r\nposition that I could only stammer out a few incoherent apologies, in\r\nwhich I tried to excuse myself by urging my anxiety for my friend.\r\n\r\n\"'The matter will not bear discussion,' said he abruptly.  'You have\r\nmade a most damnable intrusion into the privacy of our family.  You\r\nwere here as a guest and you have become a spy.  I have nothing more to\r\nsay, sir, save that I have no wish ever to see you again.'\r\n\r\n\"At this I lost my temper, Mr. Holmes, and I spoke with some warmth.\r\n\r\n\"'I have seen your son, and I am convinced that for some reason of your\r\nown you are concealing him from the world.  I have no idea what your\r\nmotives are in cutting him off in this fashion, but I am sure that he\r\nis no longer a free agent.  I warn you, Colonel Emsworth, that until I\r\nam assured as to the safety and well-being of my friend I shall never\r\ndesist in my efforts to get to the bottom of the mystery, and I shall\r\ncertainly not allow myself to be intimidated by anything which you may\r\nsay or do.'\r\n\r\n\"The old fellow looked diabolical, and I really thought he was about to\r\nattack me.  I have said that he was a gaunt, fierce old giant, and\r\nthough I am no weakling I might have been hard put to it to hold my own\r\nagainst him.  However, after a long glare of rage he turned upon his\r\nheel and walked out of the room.  For my part, I took the appointed\r\ntrain in the morning, with the full intention of coming straight to you\r\nand asking for your advice and assistance at the appointment for which\r\nI had already written.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the problem which my visitor laid before me.  It presented, as\r\nthe astute reader will have already perceived, few difficulties in its\r\nsolution, for a very limited choice of alternatives must get to the\r\nroot of the matter.  Still, elementary as it was, there were points of\r\ninterest and novelty about it which may excuse my placing it upon\r\nrecord.  I now proceeded, using my familiar method of logical analysis,\r\nto narrow down the possible solutions.\r\n\r\n\"The servants,\" I asked; \"how many were in the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the best of my belief there were only the old butler and his wife.\r\nThey seemed to live in the simplest fashion.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no servant, then, in the detached house?\"\r\n\r\n\"None, unless the little man with the beard acted as such.  He seemed,\r\nhowever, to be quite a superior person.\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems very suggestive.  Had you any indication that food was\r\nconveyed from the one house to the other?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now that you mention it, I did see old Ralph carrying a basket down\r\nthe garden walk and going in the direction of this house.  The idea of\r\nfood did not occur to me at the moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you make any local inquiries?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did.  I spoke to the station-master and also to the innkeeper\r\nin the village.  I simply asked if they knew anything of my old\r\ncomrade, Godfrey Emsworth.  Both of them assured me that he had gone\r\nfor a voyage round the world.  He had come home and then had almost at\r\nonce started off again.  The story was evidently universally accepted.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said nothing of your suspicions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was very wise.  The matter should certainly be inquired into.  I\r\nwill go back with you to Tuxbury Old Park.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-day?\"\r\n\r\nIt happened that at the moment I was clearing up the case which my\r\nfriend Watson has described as that of the Abbey School, in which the\r\nDuke of Greyminster was so deeply involved.  I had also a commission\r\nfrom the Sultan of Turkey which called for immediate action, as\r\npolitical consequences of the gravest kind might arise from its\r\nneglect.  Therefore it was not until the beginning of the next week, as\r\nmy diary records, that I was able to start forth on my mission to\r\nBedfordshire in company with Mr. James M. Dodd.  As we drove to Euston\r\nwe picked up a grave and taciturn gentleman of iron-grey aspect, with\r\nwhom I had made the necessary arrangements.\r\n\r\n\"This is an old friend,\" said I to Dodd.  \"It is possible that his\r\npresence may be entirely unnecessary, and, on the other hand, it may be\r\nessential.  It is not necessary at the present stage to go further into\r\nthe matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe narratives of Watson have accustomed the reader, no doubt, to the\r\nfact that I do not waste words or disclose my thoughts while a case is\r\nactually under consideration.  Dodd seemed surprised, but nothing more\r\nwas said and the three of us continued our journey together.  In the\r\ntrain I asked Dodd one more question which I wished our companion to\r\nhear.\r\n\r\n\"You say that you saw your friend's face quite clearly at the window,\r\nso clearly that you are sure of his identity?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt about it whatever.  His nose was pressed against the\r\nglass.  The lamplight shone full upon him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It could not have been someone resembling him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; it was he.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you say he was changed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only in colour.  His face was--how shall I describe it?--it was of a\r\nfish-belly whiteness.  It was bleached.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it equally pale all over?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not.  It was his brow which I saw so clearly as it was pressed\r\nagainst the window.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you call to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was too startled and horrified for the moment.  Then I pursued him,\r\nas I have told you, but without result.\"\r\n\r\nMy case was practically complete, and there was only one small incident\r\nneeded to round it off.  When, after a considerable drive, we arrived\r\nat the strange old rambling house which my client had described, it was\r\nRalph, the elderly butler, who opened the door.  I had requisitioned\r\nthe carriage for the day and had asked my elderly friend to remain\r\nwithin it unless we should summon him.  Ralph, a little wrinkled old\r\nfellow, was in the conventional costume of black coat and\r\npepper-and-salt trousers, with only one curious variant.  He wore brown\r\nleather gloves, which at sight of us he instantly shuffled off, laying\r\nthem down on the hall-table as we passed in.  I have, as my friend\r\nWatson may have remarked, an abnormally acute set of senses, and a\r\nfaint but incisive scent was apparent.  It seemed to centre on the\r\nhall-table.  I turned, placed my hat there, knocked it off, stooped to\r\npick it up, and contrived to bring my nose within a foot of the gloves.\r\nYes, it was undoubtedly from them that the curious tarry odour was\r\noozing.  I passed on into the study with my case complete.  Alas, that\r\nI should have to show my hand so when I tell my own story!  It was by\r\nconcealing such links in the chain that Watson was enabled to produce\r\nhis meretricious finales.\r\n\r\nColonel Emsworth was not in his room, but he came quickly enough on\r\nreceipt of Ralph's message.  We heard his quick, heavy step in the\r\npassage.  The door was flung open and he rushed in with bristling beard\r\nand twisted features, as terrible an old man as ever I have seen.  He\r\nheld our cards in his hand, and he tore them up and stamped on the\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\n\"Have I not told you, you infernal busybody, that you are warned off\r\nthe premises?  Never dare to show your damned face here again.  If you\r\nenter again without my leave I shall be within my rights if I use\r\nviolence.  I'll shoot you, sir!  By God, I will!  As to you, sir,\"\r\nturning upon me, \"I extend the same warning to you.  I am familiar with\r\nyour ignoble profession, but you must take your reputed talents to some\r\nother field.  There is no opening for them here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot leave here,\" said my client firmly, \"until I hear from\r\nGodfrey's own lips that he is under no restraint.\"\r\n\r\nOur involuntary host rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\"Ralph,\" he said, \"telephone down to the county police and ask the\r\ninspector to send up two constables.  Tell him there are burglars in\r\nthe house.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment,\" said I.  \"You must be aware, Mr. Dodd, that Colonel\r\nEmsworth is within his rights and that we have no legal status within\r\nhis house.  On the other hand, he should recognize that your action is\r\nprompted entirely by solicitude for his son.  I venture to hope that,\r\nif I were allowed to have five minutes' conversation with Colonel\r\nEmsworth, I could certainly alter his view of the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not so easily altered,\" said the old soldier.  \"Ralph, do what I\r\nhave told you.  What the devil are you waiting for?  Ring up the\r\npolice!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" I said, putting my back to the door.  \"Any\r\npolice interference would bring about the very catastrophe which you\r\ndread.\"  I took out my notebook and scribbled one word upon a loose\r\nsheet.  \"That,\" said I, as I handed it to Colonel Emsworth, \"is what\r\nhas brought us here.\"\r\n\r\nHe stared at the writing with a face from which every expression save\r\namazement had vanished.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" he gasped, sitting down heavily in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"It is my business to know things.  That is my trade.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat in deep thought, his gaunt hand tugging at his straggling beard.\r\nThen he made a gesture of resignation.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you wish to see Godfrey, you shall.  It is no doing of mine,\r\nbut you have forced my hand.  Ralph, tell Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Kent that\r\nin five minutes we shall be with them.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of that time we passed down the garden path and found\r\nourselves in front of the mystery house at the end.  A small bearded\r\nman stood at the door with a look of considerable astonishment upon his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"This is very sudden, Colonel Emsworth,\" said he.  \"This will\r\ndisarrange all our plans.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help it, Mr. Kent.  Our hands have been forced.  Can Mr.\r\nGodfrey see us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he is waiting inside.\"  He turned and led us into a large,\r\nplainly furnished front room.  A man was standing with his back to the\r\nfire, and at the sight of him my client sprang forward with\r\noutstretched hand.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Godfrey, old man, this is fine!\"\r\n\r\nBut the other waved him back.\r\n\r\n\"Don't touch me, Jimmie.  Keep your distance.  Yes, you may well stare!\r\nI don't quite look the smart Lance-Corporal Emsworth, of B Squadron, do\r\nI?\"\r\n\r\nHis appearance was certainly extraordinary.  One could see that he had\r\nindeed been a handsome man with clear-cut features sunburned by an\r\nAfrican sun, but mottled in patches over this darker surface were\r\ncurious whitish patches which had bleached his skin.\r\n\r\n\"That's why I don't court visitors,\" said he.  \"I don't mind you,\r\nJimmie, but I could have done without your friend.  I suppose there is\r\nsome good reason for it, but you have me at a disadvantage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to be sure that all was well with you, Godfrey.  I saw you\r\nthat night when you looked into my window, and I could not let the\r\nmatter rest till I had cleared things up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Ralph told me you were there, and I couldn't help taking a peep at\r\nyou.  I hoped you would not have seen me, and I had to run to my burrow\r\nwhen I heard the window go up.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what in Heaven's name is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's not a long story to tell,\" said he, lighting a cigarette.\r\n\"You remember that morning fight at Buffelsspruit, outside Pretoria, on\r\nthe Eastern railway line?  You heard I was hit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I heard that, but I never got particulars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three of us got separated from the others.  It was very broken\r\ncountry, you may remember.  There was Simpson--the fellow we called\r\nBaldy Simpson--and Anderson, and I.  We were clearing brother Boer, but\r\nhe lay low and got the three of us.  The other two were killed.  I got\r\nan elephant bullet through my shoulder.  I stuck on to my horse,\r\nhowever, and he galloped several miles before I fainted and rolled off\r\nthe saddle.\r\n\r\n\"When I came to myself it was nightfall, and I raised myself up,\r\nfeeling very weak and ill.  To my surprise there was a house close\r\nbeside me, a fairly large house with a broad stoep and many windows.\r\nIt was deadly cold.  You remember the kind of numb cold which used to\r\ncome at evening, a deadly, sickening sort of cold, very different from\r\na crisp healthy frost.  Well, I was chilled to the bone, and my only\r\nhope seemed to lie in reaching that house.  I staggered to my feet and\r\ndragged myself along, hardly conscious of what I did.  I have a dim\r\nmemory of slowly ascending the steps, entering a wide-opened door,\r\npassing into a large room which contained several beds, and throwing\r\nmyself down with a gasp of satisfaction upon one of them.  It was\r\nunmade, but that troubled me not at all.  I drew the clothes over my\r\nshivering body and in a moment I was in a deep sleep.\r\n\r\n\"It was morning when I wakened, and it seemed to me that instead of\r\ncoming out into a world of sanity I had emerged into some extraordinary\r\nnightmare.  The African sun flooded through the big, curtainless\r\nwindows, and every detail of the great, bare, whitewashed dormitory\r\nstood out hard and clear.  In front of me was standing a small,\r\ndwarf-like man with a huge, bulbous head, who was jabbering excitedly\r\nin Dutch, waving two horrible hands which looked to me like brown\r\nsponges.  Behind him stood a group of people who seemed to be intensely\r\namused by the situation, but a chill came over me as I looked at them.\r\nNot one of them was a normal human being.  Every one was twisted or\r\nswollen or disfigured in some strange way.  The laughter of these\r\nstrange monstrosities was a dreadful thing to hear.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed that none of them could speak English, but the situation\r\nwanted clearing up, for the creature with the big head was growing\r\nfuriously angry and, uttering wild beast cries, he had laid his\r\ndeformed hands upon me and was dragging me out of bed, regardless of\r\nthe fresh flow of blood from my wound.  The little monster was as\r\nstrong as a bull, and I don't know what he might have done to me had\r\nnot an elderly man who was clearly in authority been attracted to the\r\nroom by the hubbub.  He said a few stern words in Dutch and my\r\npersecutor shrank away.  Then he turned upon me, gazing at me in the\r\nutmost amazement.\r\n\r\n\"'How in the world did you come here?' he asked, in amazement.  'Wait a\r\nbit!  I see that you are tired out and that wounded shoulder of yours\r\nwants looking after.  I am a doctor, and I'll soon have you tied up.\r\nBut, man alive! you are in far greater danger here than ever you were\r\non the battlefield.  You are in the Leper Hospital, and you have slept\r\nin a leper's bed.'\r\n\r\n\"Need I tell you more, Jimmie?  It seems that in view of the\r\napproaching battle all these poor creatures had been evacuated the day\r\nbefore.  Then, as the British advanced, they had been brought back by\r\nthis, their medical superintendent, who assured me that, though he\r\nbelieved he was immune to the disease, he would none the less never\r\nhave dared to do what I had done.  He put me in a private room, treated\r\nme kindly, and within a week or so I was removed to the general\r\nhospital at Pretoria.\r\n\r\n\"So there you have my tragedy.  I hoped against hope, but it was not\r\nuntil I had reached home that the terrible signs which you see upon my\r\nface told me that I had not escaped.  What was I to do?  I was in this\r\nlonely house.  We had two servants whom we could utterly trust.  There\r\nwas a house where I could live.  Under pledge of secrecy, Mr. Kent, who\r\nis a surgeon, was prepared to stay with me.  It seemed simple enough on\r\nthose lines.  The alternative was a dreadful one--segregation for life\r\namong strangers with never a hope of release.  But absolute secrecy was\r\nnecessary, or even in this quiet country-side there would have been an\r\noutcry, and I should have been dragged to my horrible doom.  Even you,\r\nJimmie--even you had to be kept in the dark.  Why my father has\r\nrelented I cannot imagine.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Emsworth pointed to me.\r\n\r\n\"This is the gentleman who forced my hand.\"  He unfolded the scrap of\r\npaper on which I had written the word \"Leprosy.\"  \"It seemed to me that\r\nif he knew so much as that it was safer that he should know all.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so it was,\" said I.  \"Who knows but good may come of it?  I\r\nunderstand that only Mr. Kent has seen the patient.  May I ask, sir, if\r\nyou are an authority on such complaints, which are, I understand,\r\ntropical or semi-tropical in their nature?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the ordinary knowledge of the educated medical man,\" he\r\nobserved, with some stiffness.\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt, sir, that you are fully competent, but I am sure that\r\nyou will agree that in such a case a second opinion is valuable.  You\r\nhave avoided this, I understand, for fear that pressure should be put\r\nupon you to segregate the patient.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so,\" said Colonel Emsworth.\r\n\r\n\"I foresaw this situation,\" I explained, \"and I have brought with me a\r\nfriend whose discretion may absolutely be trusted.  I was able once to\r\ndo him a professional service, and he is ready to advise as a friend\r\nrather than as a specialist.  His name is Sir James Saunders.\"\r\n\r\nThe prospect of an interview with Lord Roberts would not have excited\r\ngreater wonder and pleasure in a raw subaltern than was now reflected\r\nupon the face of Mr. Kent.\r\n\r\n\"I shall indeed be proud,\" he murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Then I will ask Sir James to step this way.  He is at present in the\r\ncarriage outside the door.  Meanwhile, Colonel Emsworth, we may perhaps\r\nassemble in your study, where I could give the necessary explanations.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here it is that I miss my Watson.  By cunning questions and\r\nejaculations of wonder he could elevate my simple art, which is but\r\nsystematized common sense, into a prodigy.  When I tell my own story I\r\nhave no such aid.  And yet I will give my process of thought even as I\r\ngave it to my small audience, which included Godfrey's mother, in the\r\nstudy of Colonel Emsworth.\r\n\r\n\"That process,\" said I, \"starts upon the supposition that when you have\r\neliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains however\r\nimprobable, must be the truth.  It may well be that several\r\nexplanations remain, in which case one tries test after test until one\r\nor other of them has a convincing amount of support.  We will now apply\r\nthis principle to the case in point.  As it was first presented to me,\r\nthere were three possible explanations of the seclusion or\r\nincarceration of this gentleman in an outhouse of his father's mansion.\r\nThere was the explanation that he was in hiding for a crime, or that he\r\nwas mad and that they wished to avoid an asylum, or that he had some\r\ndisease which caused his segregation.  I could think of no other\r\nadequate solutions.  These, then, had to be sifted and balanced against\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\"The criminal solution would not bear inspection.  No unsolved crime\r\nhad been reported from that district.  I was sure of that.  If it were\r\nsome crime not yet discovered, then clearly it would be to the interest\r\nof the family to get rid of the delinquent and send him abroad rather\r\nthan keep him concealed at home.  I could see no explanation for such a\r\nline of conduct.\r\n\r\n\"Insanity was more plausible.  The presence of the second person in the\r\nouthouse suggested a keeper.  The fact that he locked the door when he\r\ncame out strengthened the supposition and gave the idea of constraint.\r\nOn the other hand, this constraint could not be severe or the young man\r\ncould not have got loose and come down to have a look at his friend.\r\nYou will remember, Mr. Dodd, that I felt round for points, asking you,\r\nfor example, about the paper which Mr. Kent was reading.  Had it been\r\n_The Lancet_ or _The British Medical Journal_ it would have helped me.\r\nIt is not illegal, however, to keep a lunatic upon private premises so\r\nlong as there is a qualified person in attendance and that the\r\nauthorities have been duly notified.  Why, then, all this desperate\r\ndesire for secrecy?  Once again I could not get the theory to fit the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n\"There remained the third possibility, into which, rare and unlikely as\r\nit was, everything seemed to fit.  Leprosy is not uncommon in South\r\nAfrica.  By some extraordinary chance this youth might have contracted\r\nit.  His people would be placed in a very dreadful position, since they\r\nwould desire to save him from segregation.  Great secrecy would be\r\nneeded to prevent rumours from getting about and subsequent\r\ninterference by the authorities.  A devoted medical man, if\r\nsufficiently paid, would easily be found to take charge of the\r\nsufferer.  There would be no reason why the latter should not be\r\nallowed freedom after dark.  Bleaching of the skin is a common result\r\nof the disease.  The case was a strong one--so strong that I determined\r\nto act as if it were actually proved.  When on arriving here I noticed\r\nthat Ralph, who carries out the meals, had gloves which are impregnated\r\nwith disinfectants, my last doubts were removed.  A single word showed\r\nyou, sir, that your secret was discovered, and if I wrote rather than\r\nsaid it, it was to prove to you that my discretion was to be trusted.\"\r\n\r\nI was finishing this little analysis of the case when the door was\r\nopened and the austere figure of the great dermatologist was ushered\r\nin.  But for once his sphinx-like features had relaxed and there was a\r\nwarm humanity in his eyes.  He strode up to Colonel Emsworth and shook\r\nhim by the hand.\r\n\r\n\"It is often my lot to bring ill-tidings, and seldom good,\" said he.\r\n\"This occasion is the more welcome.  It is not leprosy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"A well-marked case of pseudo-leprosy or ichthyosis, a scale-like\r\naffection of the skin, unsightly, obstinate, but possibly curable, and\r\ncertainly non-infective.  Yes, Mr. Holmes, the coincidence is a\r\nremarkable one.  But is it coincidence?  Are there not subtle forces at\r\nwork of which we know little?  Are we assured that the apprehension,\r\nfrom which this young man has no doubt suffered terribly since his\r\nexposure to its contagion, may not produce a physical effect which\r\nsimulates that which it fears?  At any rate, I pledge my professional\r\nreputation----  But the lady has fainted!  I think that Mr. Kent had\r\nbetter be with her until she recovers from this joyous shock.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE MAZARIN STONE\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant to Dr. Watson to find himself once more in the untidy\r\nroom of the first floor in Baker Street which had been the\r\nstarting-point of so many remarkable adventures.  He looked round him\r\nat the scientific charts upon the wall, the acid-charred bench of\r\nchemicals, the violin-case leaning in the corner, the coal-scuttle,\r\nwhich contained of old the pipes and tobacco.  Finally, his eyes came\r\nround to the fresh and smiling face of Billy, the young but very wise\r\nand tactful page, who had helped a little to fill up the gap of\r\nloneliness and isolation which surrounded the saturnine figure of the\r\ngreat detective.\r\n\r\n\"It all seems very unchanged, Billy.  You don't change, either.  I hope\r\nthe same can be said of him?\"\r\n\r\nBilly glanced, with some solicitude, at the closed door of the bedroom.\r\n\r\n\"I think he's in bed and asleep,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIt was seven in the evening of a lovely summer's day, but Dr. Watson\r\nwas sufficiently familiar with the irregularity of his old friend's\r\nhours to feel no surprise at the idea.\r\n\r\n\"That means a case, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; he is very hard at it just now.  I'm frightened for his\r\nhealth.  He gets paler and thinner, and he eats nothing.  'When will\r\nyou be pleased to dine, Mr. Holmes?' Mrs. Hudson asked.  'Seven-thirty,\r\nthe day after to-morrow,' said he.  You know his way when he is keen on\r\na case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Billy, I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's following someone.  Yesterday he was out as a workman looking for\r\na job.  To-day he was an old woman.  Fairly took me in, he did, and I\r\nought to know his ways by now.\"  Billy pointed with a grin to a very\r\nbaggy parasol which leaned against the sofa.  \"That's part of the old\r\nwoman's outfit,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"But what is it all about, Billy?\"\r\n\r\nBilly sank his voice, as one who discusses great secrets of State.  \"I\r\ndon't mind telling you, sir, but it should go no farther.  It's this\r\ncase of the Crown diamond.\"\r\n\r\n\"What--the hundred-thousand-pound burglary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.  They must get it back, sir.  Why, we had the Prime Minister\r\nand the Home Secretary both sitting on that very sofa.  Mr. Holmes was\r\nvery nice to them.  He soon put them at their ease and promised he\r\nwould do all he could.  Then there is Lord Cantlemere----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; you know what that means.  He's a stiff 'un, sir, if I may\r\nsay so.  I can get along with the Prime Minister, and I've nothing\r\nagainst the Home Secretary, who seemed a civil, obliging sort of man,\r\nbut I can't stand his lordship.  Neither can Mr. Holmes, sir.  You see,\r\nhe don't believe in Mr. Holmes and he was against employing him.  He'd\r\nrather he failed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Mr. Holmes knows it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes always knows whatever there is to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll hope he won't fail and that Lord Cantlemere will be\r\nconfounded.  But I say, Billy, what is that curtain for across the\r\nwindow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes had it put up there three days ago.  We've got something\r\nfunny behind it.\"\r\n\r\nBilly advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the alcove of\r\nthe bow window.\r\n\r\nDr. Watson could not restrain a cry of amazement.  There was a\r\nfacsimile of his old friend, dressing-gown and all, the face turned\r\nthree-quarters towards the window and downwards, as though reading an\r\ninvisible book, while the body was sunk deep in an arm-chair.  Billy\r\ndetached the head and held it in the air.\r\n\r\n\"We put it at different angles, so that it may seem more life-like.  I\r\nwouldn't dare touch it if the blind were not down.  But when it's up\r\nyou can see this from across the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"We used something of the sort once before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before my time,\" said Billy.  He drew the window curtains apart and\r\nlooked out into the street. \"There are folk who watch us from over\r\nyonder.  I can see a fellow now at the window.  Have a look for\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\nWatson had taken a step forward when the bedroom door opened, and the\r\nlong, thin form of Holmes emerged, his face pale and drawn, but his\r\nstep and bearing as active as ever.  With a single spring he was at the\r\nwindow, and had drawn the blind once more.\r\n\r\n\"That will do, Billy,\" said he.  \"You were in danger of your life then,\r\nmy boy, and I can't do without you just yet.  Well, Watson, it is good\r\nto see you in your old quarters once again.  You come at a critical\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I gather.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can go, Billy.  That boy is a problem, Watson.  How far am I\r\njustified in allowing him to be in danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Danger of what, Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of sudden death.  I'm expecting something this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Expecting what?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be murdered, Watson.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; you are joking, Holmes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Even my limited sense of humour could evolve a better joke than that.\r\nBut we may be comfortable in the meantime, may we not?  Is alcohol\r\npermitted?  The gasogene and cigars are in the old place.  Let me see\r\nyou once more in the customary arm-chair.  You have not, I hope,\r\nlearned to despise my pipe and my lamentable tobacco?  It has to take\r\nthe place of food these days.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why not eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the faculties become refined when you starve them.  Why,\r\nsurely, as a doctor, my dear Watson, you must admit that what your\r\ndigestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to the\r\nbrain.  I am a brain, Watson.  The rest of me is a mere appendix.\r\nTherefore, it is the brain I must consider.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this danger, Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes; in case it should come off, it would perhaps be as well that\r\nyou should burden your memory with the name and address of the\r\nmurderer.  You can give it to Scotland Yard, with my love and a parting\r\nblessing.  Sylvius is the name--Count Negretto Sylvius.  Write it down,\r\nman, write it down!  136 Moorside Gardens, N.W.  Got it?\"\r\n\r\nWatson's honest face was twitching with anxiety.  He knew only too well\r\nthe immense risks taken by Holmes, and was well aware that what he said\r\nwas more likely to be under-statement than exaggeration.  Watson was\r\nalways the man of action, and he rose to the occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Count me in,  Holmes.  I have nothing to do for a day or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your morals don't improve, Watson.  You have added fibbing to your\r\nother vices.  You bear every sign of the busy medical man, with calls\r\non him every hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not such important ones.  But can't you have this fellow arrested?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Watson, I could.  That's what worries him so.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I don't know where the diamond is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  Billy told me--the missing Crown jewel!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the great yellow Mazarin stone.  I've cast my net and I have my\r\nfish.  But I have not got the stone.  What is the use of taking _them_?\r\nWe can make the world a better place by laying them by the heels.  But\r\nthat is not what I am out for.  It's the stone I want.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is this Count Sylvius one of your fish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and he's a shark.  He bites.  The other is Sam Merton, the boxer.\r\nNot a bad fellow, Sam, but the Count has used him.  Sam's not a shark.\r\nHe is a great big silly bull-headed gudgeon.  But he is flopping about\r\nin my net all the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is this Count Sylvius?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been at his very elbow all the morning.  You've seen me as an old\r\nlady, Watson.  I was never more convincing.  He actually picked up my\r\nparasol for me once.  'By your leave, madame,' said he--half-Italian,\r\nyou know, and with the Southern graces of manner when in the mood, but\r\na devil incarnate in the other mood.  Life is full of whimsical\r\nhappenings, Watson.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might have been tragedy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps it might.  I followed him to old Straubenzee's workshop\r\nin the Minories.  Straubenzee made the air-gun--a very pretty bit of\r\nwork, as I understand, and I rather fancy it is in the opposite window\r\nat the present moment.  Have you seen the dummy?  Of course, Billy\r\nshowed it to you.  Well, it may get a bullet through its beautiful head\r\nat any moment.  Ah, Billy, what is it?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy had reappeared in the room with a card upon a tray.  Holmes\r\nglanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile.\r\n\r\n\"The man himself.  I had hardly expected this.  Grasp the nettle,\r\nWatson!  A man of nerve.  Possibly you have heard of his reputation as\r\na shooter of big game.  It would indeed be a triumphant ending to his\r\nexcellent sporting record if he added me to his bag.  This is a proof\r\nthat he feels my toe very close behind his heel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Send for the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"I probably shall.  But not just yet.  Would you glance carefully out\r\nof the window, Watson, and see if anyone is hanging about in the\r\nstreet?\"\r\n\r\nWatson looked warily round the edge of the curtain.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is one rough fellow near the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be Sam Merton--the faithful but rather fatuous Sam.  Where\r\nis this gentleman, Billy?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the waiting-room, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Show him up when I ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I am not in the room, show him in all the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nWatson waited until the door was closed, and then he turned earnestly\r\nto his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Holmes, this is simply impossible.  This is a desperate\r\nman, who sticks at nothing.  He may have come to murder you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should not be surprised.\"\r\n\r\n\"I insist upon staying with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would be horribly in the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"In his way?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my dear fellow--in my way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can't possibly leave you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you can, Watson.  And you will, for you have never failed to play\r\nthe game.  I am sure you will play it to the end.  This man has come\r\nfor his own purpose, but he may stay for mine.\"  Holmes took out his\r\nnotebook and scribbled a few lines.  \"Take a cab to Scotland Yard and\r\ngive this to Youghal of the C.I.D.  Come back with the police.  The\r\nfellow's arrest will follow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do that with joy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before you return I may have just time enough to find out where the\r\nstone is.\"  He touched the bell.  \"I think we will go out through the\r\nbedroom.  This second exit is exceedingly useful.  I rather want to see\r\nmy shark without his seeing me, and I have, as you will remember, my\r\nown way of doing it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, an empty room into which Billy, a minute later,\r\nushered Count Sylvius.  The famous game-shot, sportsman, and\r\nman-about-town was a big, swarthy fellow, with a formidable dark\r\nmoustache, shading a cruel, thin-lipped mouth, and surmounted by a\r\nlong, curved nose, like the beak of an eagle.  He was well dressed, but\r\nhis brilliant necktie, shining pin, and glittering rings were\r\nflamboyant in their effect.  As the door closed behind him he looked\r\nround him with fierce, startled eyes, like one who suspects a trap at\r\nevery turn.  Then he gave a violent start as he saw the impassive head\r\nand the collar of the dressing-gown which projected above the arm-chair\r\nin the window.  At first his expression was one of pure amazement.\r\nThen the light of a horrible hope gleamed in his dark, murderous eyes.\r\nHe took one more glance round to see that there were no witnesses, and\r\nthen, on tiptoe, his thick stick half raised, he approached the silent\r\nfigure.  He was crouching for his final spring and blow when a cool,\r\nsardonic voice greeted him from the open bedroom door:\r\n\r\n\"Don't break it, Count!  Don't break it!\"\r\n\r\nThe assassin staggered back, amazement in his convulsed face.  For an\r\ninstant he half raised his loaded cane once more, as if he would turn\r\nhis violence from the effigy to the original; but there was something\r\nin that steady grey eye and mocking smile which caused his hand to sink\r\nto his side.\r\n\r\n\"It's a pretty little thing,\" said Holmes, advancing towards the image.\r\n\"Tavernier, the French modeller, made it.  He is as good at waxworks as\r\nyour friend Straubenzee is at air-guns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Air-guns, sir!  What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Put your hat and stick on the side-table.  Thank you!  Pray take a\r\nseat.  Would you care to put your revolver out also?  Oh, very good, if\r\nyou prefer to sit upon it.  Your visit is really most opportune, for I\r\nwanted badly to have a few minutes' chat with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count scowled, with heavy, threatening eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"I, too, wished to have some words with you, Holmes.  That is why I am\r\nhere.  I won't deny that I intended to assault you just now.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes swung his leg on the edge of the table.\r\n\r\n\"I rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head,\"\r\nsaid he.  \"But why these personal attentions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you have gone out of your way to annoy me.  Because you have\r\nput your creatures upon my track.\"\r\n\r\n\"My creatures!  I assure you no!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!  I have had them followed.  Two can play at that game,\r\nHolmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a small point, Count Sylvius, but perhaps you would kindly give\r\nme my prefix when you address me.  You can understand that, with my\r\nroutine of work, I should find myself on familiar terms with half the\r\nrogues' gallery, and you will agree that exceptions are invidious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, _Mr._ Holmes, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent!  But I assure you you are mistaken about my alleged agents.\"\r\n\r\nCount Sylvius laughed contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"Other people can observe as well as you.  Yesterday there was an old\r\nsporting man.  To-day it was an elderly woman.  They held me in view\r\nall day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, sir, you compliment me.  Old Baron Dowson said the night\r\nbefore he was hanged that in my case what the law had gained the stage\r\nhad lost.  And now you give my little impersonations your kindly\r\npraise!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was you--you yourself?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders.  \"You can see in the corner the parasol\r\nwhich you so politely handed to me in the Minories before you began to\r\nsuspect.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I had known, you might never----\"\r\n\r\n\"Have seen this humble home again.  I was well aware of it.  We all\r\nhave neglected opportunities to deplore.  As it happens, you did not\r\nknow, so here we are!\"\r\n\r\nThe Count's knotted brows gathered more heavily over his menacing eyes.\r\n\"What you say only makes the matter worse.  It was not your agents, but\r\nyour play-acting, busybody self!  You admit that you have dogged me.\r\nWhy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come now, Count.  You used to shoot lions in Algeria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?  The sport--the excitement--the danger!\"\r\n\r\n\"And, no doubt, to free the country from a pest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!\"\r\n\r\n\"My reasons in a nutshell!\"\r\n\r\nThe Count sprang to his feet, and his hand involuntarily moved back to\r\nhis hip-pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, sir, sit down!  There was another, more practical, reason.\r\nI want that yellow diamond!\"\r\n\r\nCount Sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil smile.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word!\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"You knew that I was after you for that.  The real reason why you are\r\nhere to-night is to find out how much I know about the matter and how\r\nfar my removal is absolutely essential.  Well, I should say that, from\r\nyour point of view, it is absolutely essential, for I know all about\r\nit, save only one thing, which you are about to tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed!  And, pray, what is this missing fact?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where the Crown diamond now is.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count looked sharply at his companion.  \"Oh, you want to know that,\r\ndo you?  How the devil should I be able to tell you where it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can, and you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't bluff me, Count Sylvius.\"  Holmes's eyes, as he gazed at\r\nhim, contracted and lightened until they were like two menacing points\r\nof steel.  \"You are absolute plate-glass.  I see to the very back of\r\nyour mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, of course, you see where the diamond is!\"\r\n\r\nHolmes clapped his hands with amusement, and then pointed a derisive\r\nfinger.  \"Then you do know.  You have admitted it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I admit nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Count, if you will be reasonable, we can do business.  If not,\r\nyou will get hurt.\"\r\n\r\nCount Sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling.  \"And you talk about\r\nbluff!\" said he.\r\n\r\nHolmes looked at him thoughtfully, like a master chess-player who\r\nmeditates his crowning move.  Then he threw open the table drawer and\r\ndrew out a squat notebook.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what I keep in this book?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I do not!\"\r\n\r\n\"You!\"\r\n\r\n\"Me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, _you_!  You are all here--every action of your vile and\r\ndangerous life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn you, Holmes!\" cried the Count, with blazing eyes.  \"There are\r\nlimits to my patience!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all here, Count.  The real facts as to the death of old Mrs.\r\nHarold, who left you the Blymer estate, which you so rapidly gambled\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are dreaming!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the complete life history of Miss Minnie Warrender.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut!  You will make nothing of that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty more here, Count.  Here is the robbery in the train-de-luxe to\r\nthe Riviera on February 13, 1892.  Here is the forged cheque in the\r\nsame year on the Crédit Lyonnais.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; you're wrong there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am right on the others!  Now, Count, you are a card-player.\r\nWhen the other fellow has all the trumps, it saves time to throw down\r\nyour hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has all this talk to do with the jewel of which you spoke?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gently, Count.  Restrain that eager mind!  Let me get to the points in\r\nmy own humdrum fashion.  I have all this against you; but, above all, I\r\nhave a clear case against both you and your fighting bully in the case\r\nof the Crown diamond.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the cabman who took you to Whitehall and the cabman who brought\r\nyou away.  I have the Commissionaire who saw you near the case.  I have\r\nIkey Sanders, who refused to cut it up for you.  Ikey has peached, and\r\nthe game is up.\"\r\n\r\nThe veins stood out on the Count's forehead.  His dark, hairy hands\r\nwere clenched in a convulsion of restrained emotion.  He tried to\r\nspeak, but the words would not shape themselves.\r\n\r\n\"That's the hand I play from,\" said Holmes.  \"I put it all upon the\r\ntable.  But one card is missing.  It's the King of Diamonds.  I don't\r\nknow where the stone is.\"\r\n\r\n\"You never shall know.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?  Now, be reasonable, Count.  Consider the situation.  You are\r\ngoing to be locked up for twenty years.  So is Sam Merton.  What good\r\nare you going to get out of your diamond?  None in the world.  But if\r\nyou hand it over--well, I'll compound a felony.  We don't want you or\r\nSam.  We want the stone.  Give that up, and so far as I am concerned\r\nyou can go free so long as you behave yourself in the future.  If you\r\nmake another slip--well, it will be the last.  But this time my\r\ncommission is to get the stone, not you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if I refuse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then--alas!--it must be you and not the stone.\"\r\n\r\nBilly had appeared in answer to a ring.\r\n\r\n\"I think, Count, that it would be as well to have your friend Sam at\r\nthis conference.  After all, his interests should be represented.\r\nBilly, you will see a large and ugly gentleman outside the front door.\r\nAsk him to come up.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he won't come, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"No violence, Billy.  Don't be rough with him.  If you tell him that\r\nCount Sylvius wants him he will certainly come.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do now?\" asked the Count, as Billy disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"My friend Watson was with me just now.  I told him that I had a shark\r\nand a gudgeon in my net; now I am drawing the net and up they come\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count had risen from his chair, and his hand was behind his back.\r\nHolmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his\r\ndressing-gown.\r\n\r\n\"You won't die in your bed, Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have often had the same idea.  Does it matter very much?  After all,\r\nCount, your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than\r\nhorizontal.  But these anticipations of the future are morbid.  Why not\r\ngive ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present?\"\r\n\r\nA sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the dark, menacing eyes of the\r\nmaster criminal.  Holmes's figure seemed to grow taller as he grew\r\ntense and ready.\r\n\r\n\"It is no use your fingering your revolver, my friend,\" he said, in a\r\nquiet voice.  \"You know perfectly well that you dare not use it, even\r\nif I gave you time to draw it.  Nasty, noisy things, revolvers, Count.\r\nBetter stick to air-guns.  Ah!  I think I hear the fairy footstep of\r\nyour estimable partner.  Good day, Mr. Merton.  Rather dull in the\r\nstreet, is it not?\"\r\n\r\nThe prize-fighter, a heavily built young man with a stupid, obstinate,\r\nslab-sided face, stood awkwardly at the door, looking about him with a\r\npuzzled expression.  Holmes's debonair manner was a new experience, and\r\nthough he vaguely felt that it was hostile, he did not know how to\r\ncounter it.  He turned to his more astute comrade for help.\r\n\r\n\"What's the game now, Count?  What's this fellow want?  What's up?\"\r\nHis voice was deep and raucous.\r\n\r\nThe Count shrugged his shoulders and it was Holmes who answered.\r\n\r\n\"If I may put it in a nutshell, Mr. Merton, I should say it was _all_\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\nThe boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate.\r\n\r\n\"Is this cove trying to be funny, or what?  I'm not in the funny mood\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I expect not,\" said Holmes.  \"I think I can promise you that you\r\nwill feel even less humorous as the evening advances.  Now, look here,\r\nCount Sylvius.  I'm a busy man and I can't waste time.  I'm going into\r\nthat bedroom.  Pray make yourselves quite at home in my absence.  You\r\ncan explain to your friend how the matter lies without the restraint of\r\nmy presence.  I shall try over the Hoffmann Barcarolle upon my violin.\r\nIn five minutes I shall return for your final answer.  You quite grasp\r\nthe alternative, do you not?  Shall we take you, or shall we have the\r\nstone?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes withdrew, picking up his violin from the corner as he passed.  A\r\nfew moments later the long-drawn, wailing notes of that most haunting\r\nof tunes came faintly through the closed door of the bedroom.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, then?\" asked Merton anxiously, as his companion turned to\r\nhim.  \"Does he know about the stone?\"\r\n\r\n\"He knows a damned sight too much about it.  I'm not sure that he\r\ndoesn't know all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\"  The boxer's sallow face turned a shade whiter.\r\n\r\n\"Ikey Sanders has split on us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has, has he?  I'll do him down a thick 'un for that if I swing for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"That won't help us much.  We've got to make up our minds what to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Half a mo',\" said the boxer, looking suspiciously at the bedroom door.\r\n\"He's a leary cove that wants watching.  I suppose he's not listening?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can he be listening with that music going?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right.  Maybe somebody's behind a curtain.  Too many curtains\r\nin this room.\"  As he looked round he suddenly saw for the first time\r\nthe effigy in the window, and stood staring and pointing, too amazed\r\nfor words.\r\n\r\n\"Tut! it's only a dummy,\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"A fake, is it?  Well, strike me!  Madame Tussaud ain't in it.  It's\r\nthe living spit of him, gown and all.  But them curtains, Count!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, confound the curtains!  We are wasting our time, and there is none\r\ntoo much.  He can lag us over this stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"The deuce he can!\"\r\n\r\n\"But he'll let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!  Give it up?  Give up a hundred thousand quid?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's one or the other.\"\r\n\r\nMerton scratched his short-cropped pate.\r\n\r\n\"He's alone in there.  Let's do him in.  If his light were out we\r\nshould have nothing to fear.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"He is armed and ready.  If we shot him we could hardly get away in a\r\nplace like this.  Besides, it's likely enough that the police know\r\nwhatever evidence he has got.  Hallo!  What was that?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a vague sound which seemed to come from the window.  Both men\r\nsprang round, but all was quiet.  Save for the one strange figure\r\nseated in the chair, the room was certainly empty.\r\n\r\n\"Something in the street,\" said Merton.  \"Now look here, guv'nor,\r\nyou've got the brains.  Surely you can think a way out of it.  If\r\nslugging is no use then it's up to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've fooled better men than he,\" the Count answered.  \"The stone is\r\nhere in my secret pocket.  I take no chances leaving it about.  It can\r\nbe out of England to-night and cut into four pieces in Amsterdam before\r\nSunday.  He knows nothing of Van Seddar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought Van Seddar was going next week.\"\r\n\r\n\"He _was_.  But now he must get off by the next boat.  One or other of\r\nus must slip round with the stone to Lime Street and tell him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the false bottom ain't ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he must take it as it is and chance it.  There's not a moment to\r\nlose.\"  Again, with the sense of danger which becomes an instinct with\r\nthe sportsman, he paused and looked hard at the window.  Yes, it was\r\nsurely from the street that the faint sound had come.\r\n\r\n\"As to Holmes,\" he continued, \"we can fool him easily enough.  You see,\r\nthe damned fool won't arrest us if he can get the stone.  Well, we'll\r\npromise him the stone.  We'll put him on the wrong track about it, and\r\nbefore he finds that it is the wrong track it will be in Holland and we\r\nout of the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds good to me!\" cried Sam Merton, with a grin.\r\n\r\n\"You go on and tell the Dutchman to get a move on him.  I'll see this\r\nsucker and fill him up with a bogus confession.  I'll tell him that the\r\nstone is in Liverpool.  Confound that whining music; it gets on my\r\nnerves!  By the time he finds it isn't in Liverpool it will be in\r\nquarters and we on the blue water.  Come back here, out of a line with\r\nthat keyhole.  Here is the stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder you dare carry it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where could I have it safer?  If we could take it out of Whitehall\r\nsomeone else could surely take it out of my lodgings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's have a look at it.\"\r\n\r\nCount Sylvius cast a somewhat unflattering glance at his associate, and\r\ndisregarded the unwashed hand which was extended towards him.\r\n\r\n\"What--d'ye think I'm going to snatch it off you?  See here, mister,\r\nI'm getting a bit tired of your ways.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well; no offence, Sam.  We can't afford to quarrel.  Come over\r\nto the window if you want to see the beauty properly.  Now hold it to\r\nthe light!  Here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you!\"\r\n\r\nWith a single spring Holmes had leaped from the dummy's chair and had\r\ngrasped the precious jewel.  He held it now in one hand, while his\r\nother pointed a revolver at the Count's head.  The two villains\r\nstaggered back in utter amazement.  Before they had recovered Holmes\r\nhad pressed the electric bell.\r\n\r\n\"No violence, gentlemen--no violence, I beg of you!  Consider the\r\nfurniture!  It must be very clear to you that your position is an\r\nimpossible one.  The police are waiting below.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count's bewilderment overmastered his rage and fear.\r\n\r\n\"But how the deuce----?\" he gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Your surprise is very natural.  You are not aware that a second door\r\nfrom my bedroom leads behind that curtain.  I fancied that you must\r\nhave heard me when I displaced the figure, but luck was on my side.  It\r\ngave me a chance of listening to your racy conversation which would\r\nhave been painfully constrained had you been aware of my presence.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count gave a gesture of resignation.\r\n\r\n\"We give you best, Holmes.  I believe you are the devil himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not far from him, at any rate,\" Holmes answered, with a polite smile.\r\n\r\nSam Merton's slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the\r\nsituation.  Now, as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs\r\noutside, he broke silence at last.\r\n\r\n\"A fair cop!\" said he.  \"But, I say, what about that bloomin' fiddle!\r\nI hear it yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut, tut!\" Holmes answered.  \"You are perfectly right.  Let it play!\r\nThese modern gramophones are a remarkable invention.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an inrush of police, the handcuffs clicked and the criminals\r\nwere led to the waiting cab.  Watson lingered with Holmes,\r\ncongratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels.  Once\r\nmore their conversation was interrupted by the imperturbable Billy with\r\nhis card-tray.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Cantlemere, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Show him up, Billy.  This is the eminent peer who represents the very\r\nhighest interests,\" said Holmes.  \"He is an excellent and loyal person,\r\nbut rather of the old regime.  Shall we make him unbend?  Dare we\r\nventure upon a slight liberty?  He knows, we may conjecture, nothing of\r\nwhat has occurred.\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened to admit a thin, austere figure with a hatchet face and\r\ndrooping mid-Victorian whiskers of a glossy blackness which hardly\r\ncorresponded with the rounded shoulders and feeble gait.  Holmes\r\nadvanced affably, and shook an unresponsive hand.\r\n\r\n\"How-do-you-do, Lord Cantlemere?  It is chilly, for the time of year,\r\nbut rather warm indoors.  May I take your overcoat?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I thank you; I will not take it off.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes laid his hand insistently upon the sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"Pray allow me!  My friend Dr. Watson would assure you that these\r\nchanges of temperature are most insidious.\"\r\n\r\nHis lordship shook himself free with some impatience.\r\n\r\n\"I am quite comfortable, sir.  I have no need to stay.  I have simply\r\nlooked in to know how your self-appointed task was progressing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult--very difficult.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feared that you would find it so.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a distinct sneer in the old courtier's words and manner.\r\n\r\n\"Every man finds his limitations, Mr. Holmes, but at least it cures us\r\nof the weakness of self-satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I have been much perplexed.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Especially upon one point.  Possibly you could help me upon it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You apply for my advice rather late in the day.  I thought that you\r\nhad your own all-sufficient methods.  Still, I am ready to help you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, Lord Cantlemere, we can no doubt frame a case against the\r\nactual thieves.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you have caught them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  But the question is--how shall we proceed against the\r\nreceiver?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this not rather premature?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is as well to have our plans ready.  Now, what would you regard as\r\nfinal evidence against the receiver?\"\r\n\r\n\"The actual possession of the stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would arrest him upon that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most undoubtedly.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes seldom laughed, but he got as near it as his old friend Watson\r\ncould remember.\r\n\r\n\"In that case, my dear sir, I shall be under the painful necessity of\r\nadvising your arrest.\"\r\n\r\nLord Cantlemere was very angry.  Some of the ancient fires flickered up\r\ninto his sallow cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"You take a great liberty, Mr. Holmes.  In fifty years of official life\r\nI cannot recall such a case.  I am a busy man, sir, engaged upon\r\nimportant affairs, and I have no time or taste for foolish jokes.  I\r\nmay tell you frankly, sir, that I have never been a believer in your\r\npowers, and that I have always been of the opinion that the matter was\r\nfar safer in the hands of the regular police force.  Your conduct\r\nconfirms all my conclusions.  I have the honour, sir, to wish you good\r\nevening.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the peer and\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\"One moment, sir,\" said he.  \"To actually go off with the Mazarin stone\r\nwould be a more serious offence than to be found in temporary\r\npossession of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, this is intolerable!  Let me pass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put your hand in the right-hand pocket of your overcoat.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come--come; do what I ask.\"\r\n\r\nAn instant later the amazed peer was standing, blinking and stammering,\r\nwith the great yellow stone on his shaking palm.\r\n\r\n\"What!  What!  How is this, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Too bad, Lord Cantlemere, too bad!\" cried Holmes.  \"My old friend here\r\nwill tell you that I have an impish habit of practical joking.  Also\r\nthat I can never resist a dramatic situation.  I took the liberty--the\r\nvery great liberty, I admit--of putting the stone into your pocket at\r\nthe beginning of our interview.\"\r\n\r\nThe old peer stared from the stone to the smiling face before him.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I am bewildered.  But--yes--it is indeed the Mazarin stone.  We\r\nare greatly your debtors, Mr. Holmes.  Your sense of humour may, as you\r\nadmit, be somewhat perverted, and its exhibition remarkably untimely,\r\nbut at least I withdraw any reflection I have made upon your amazing\r\nprofessional powers.  But how----\"\r\n\r\n\"The case is but half finished; the details can wait.  No doubt, Lord\r\nCantlemere, your pleasure in telling of this successful result in the\r\nexalted circle to which you return will be some small atonement for my\r\npractical joke.  Billy, you will show his lordship out, and tell Mrs.\r\nHudson that I should be glad if she would send up dinner for two as\r\nsoon as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE GABLES\r\n\r\nI don't think that any of my adventures with Mr. Sherlock Holmes opened\r\nquite so abruptly, or so dramatically, as that which I associate with\r\nThe Three Gables.  I had not seen Holmes for some days, and had no idea\r\nof the new channel into which his activities had been directed.  He was\r\nin a chatty mood that morning, however, and had just settled me into\r\nthe well-worn low arm-chair on one side of the fire, while he had\r\ncurled down with his pipe in his mouth upon the opposite chair, when\r\nour visitor arrived.  If I had said that a mad bull had arrived, it\r\nwould give a clearer impression of what occurred.\r\n\r\nThe door had flown open and a huge negro had burst into the room.  He\r\nwould have been a comic figure if he had not been terrific, for he was\r\ndressed in a very loud grey check suit with a flowing salmon-coloured\r\ntie.  His broad face and flattened nose were thrust forward, as his\r\nsullen dark eyes, with a smouldering gleam of malice in them, turned\r\nfrom one of us to the other.\r\n\r\n\"Which of you genelmen is Masser Holmes?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nHolmes raised his pipe with a languid smile.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! it's you, is it?\" said our visitor, coming with an unpleasant,\r\nstealthy step round the angle of the table.  \"See here, Masser Holmes,\r\nyou keep your hands out of other folks' business.  Leave folks to\r\nmanage their own affairs.  Got that, Masser Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep on talking,\" said Holmes.  \"It's fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! it's fine, is it?\" growled the savage.  \"It won't be so damn fine\r\nif I have to trim you up a bit.  I've handled your kind before now, and\r\nthey didn't look fine when I was through with them.  Look at that,\r\nMasser Holmes!\"\r\n\r\nHe swung a huge knotted lump of a fist under my friend's nose.  Holmes\r\nexamined it closely with an air of great interest.  \"Were you born so?\"\r\nhe asked.  \"Or did it come by degrees?\"\r\n\r\nIt may have been the icy coolness of my friend, or it may have been the\r\nslight clatter which I made as I picked up the poker.  In any case, our\r\nvisitor's manner became less flamboyant.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've given you fair warnin',\" said he.  \"I've a friend that's\r\ninterested out Harrow way--you know what I'm meaning--and he don't\r\nintend to have no buttin' in by you.  Got that?  You ain't the law, and\r\nI ain't the law either, and if you come in I'll be on hand also.  Don't\r\nyou forget it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've wanted to meet you for some time,\" said Holmes.  \"I won't ask you\r\nto sit down, for I don't like the smell of you, but aren't you Steve\r\nDixie, the bruiser?\r\n\r\n\"That's my name, Masser Holmes, and you'll get put through it for sure\r\nif you give me any lip.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly the last thing you need,\" said Holmes, staring at our\r\nvisitor's hideous mouth.  \"But it was the killing of young Perkins\r\noutside the Holborn Bar----  What! you're not going?\"\r\n\r\nThe negro had sprung back, and his face was leaden.  \"I won't listen to\r\nno such talk,\" said he.  \"What have I to do with this 'ere Perkins,\r\nMasser Holmes?  I was trainin' at the Bull Ring in Birmingham when this\r\nboy done gone get into trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you'll tell the magistrate about it, Steve,\" said Holmes.  \"I've\r\nbeen watching you and Barney Stockdale----\"\r\n\r\n\"So help me the Lord!  Masser Holmes----\"\r\n\r\n\"That's enough.  Get out of it.  I'll pick you up when I want you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good mornin', Masser Holmes.  I hope there ain't no hard feelin's\r\nabout this 'ere visit?\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be unless you tell me who sent you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, there ain't no secret about that, Masser Holmes.  It was that\r\nsame genelman that you have just done gone mention.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who set him on to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"S'elp me.  I don't know, Masser Holmes.  He just say, 'Steve, you go\r\nsee Mr. Holmes, and tell him his life ain't safe if he go down Harrow\r\nway.'  That's the whole truth.\"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for any further questioning, our visitor bolted out of\r\nthe room almost as precipitately as he had entered.  Holmes knocked out\r\nthe ashes of his pipe with a quiet chuckle.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you were not forced to break his woolly head, Watson.  I\r\nobserved your manoeuvres with the poker.  But he is really rather a\r\nharmless fellow, a great muscular, foolish, blustering baby, and easily\r\ncowed, as you have seen.  He is one of the Spencer John gang and has\r\ntaken part in some dirty work of late which I may clear up when I have\r\ntime.  His immediate principal, Barney, is a more astute person.  They\r\nspecialize in assaults, intimidation, and the like.  What I want to\r\nknow is, who is at the back of them on this particular occasion?\"\r\n\r\n\"But why do they want to intimidate you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is this Harrow Weald case.  It decides me to look into the matter,\r\nfor if it is worth anyone's while to take so much trouble, there must\r\nbe something in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was going to tell you when we had this comic interlude.  Here is\r\nMrs. Maberley's note.  If you care to come with me we will wire her and\r\ngo out at once.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, (I read)--\r\n\r\nI have had a succession of strange incidents occur to me in connection\r\nwith this house, and I should much value your advice.  You would find\r\nme at home any time to-morrow.  The house is within a short walk of the\r\nWeald Station.  I believe that my late husband, Mortimer Maberley, was\r\none of your early clients.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n   MARY MABERLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe address was \"The Three Gables, Harrow Weald.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that's that!\" said Holmes.  \"And now, if you can spare the time,\r\nWatson, we will get upon our way.\"\r\n\r\nA short railway journey, and a shorter drive, brought us to the house,\r\na brick and timber villa, standing in its own acre of undeveloped\r\ngrassland.  Three small projections above the upper windows made a\r\nfeeble attempt to justify its name.  Behind was a grove of melancholy,\r\nhalf-grown pines, and the whole aspect of the place was poor and\r\ndepressing.  None the less, we found the house to be well furnished,\r\nand the lady who received us was a most engaging elderly person, who\r\nbore every mark of refinement and culture.\r\n\r\n\"I remember your husband well, madam,\" said Holmes, \"though it is some\r\nyears since he used my services in some trifling matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably you would be more familiar with the name of my son Douglas.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes looked at her with great interest.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!  Are you the mother of Douglas Maberley?  I knew him\r\nslightly.  But, of course, all London knew him.  What a magnificent\r\ncreature he was!  Where is he now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead, Mr. Holmes, dead!  He was Attaché at Rome, and he died there of\r\npneumonia last month.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry.  One could not connect death with such a man.  I have\r\nnever known anyone so vitally alive.  He lived intensely--every fibre\r\nof him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Too intensely, Mr. Holmes.  That was the ruin of him.  You remember\r\nhim as he was--debonair and splendid.  You did not see the moody,\r\nmorose, brooding creature into which he developed.  His heart was\r\nbroken.  In a single month I seemed to see my gallant boy turn into a\r\nworn-out cynical man.\"\r\n\r\n\"A love affair--a woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Or a fiend.  Well, it was not to talk of my poor lad that I asked you\r\nto come, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Watson and I are at your service.\"\r\n\r\n\"There have been some very strange happenings.  I have been in this\r\nhouse more than a year now, and as I wished to lead a retired life I\r\nhave seen little of my neighbours.  Three days ago I had a call from a\r\nman who said that he was a house agent.  He said that this house would\r\nexactly suit a client of his and that if I would part with it money\r\nwould be no object.  It seemed to me very strange, as there are several\r\nempty houses on the market which appear to be equally eligible, but\r\nnaturally I was interested in what he said.  I therefore named a price\r\nwhich was five hundred pounds more than I gave.  He at once closed with\r\nthe offer, but added that his client desired to buy the furniture as\r\nwell and would I put a price upon it.  Some of this furniture is from\r\nmy old home, and it is, as you see, very good, so that I named a good\r\nround sum.  To this also he at once agreed.  I had always wanted to\r\ntravel, and the bargain was so good a one that it really seemed that I\r\nshould be my own mistress for the rest of my life.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday the man arrived with the agreement all drawn out.  Luckily I\r\nshowed it to Mr. Sutro, my lawyer, who lives in Harrow.  He said to me,\r\n'This is a very strange document.  Are you aware that if you sign it\r\nyou could not legally take _anything_ out of the house--not even your\r\nown private possessions?'  When the man came again in the evening I\r\npointed this out, and I said that I meant only to sell the furniture.\r\n\r\n\"'No, no; everything,' said he.\r\n\r\n\"'But my clothes?  My jewels?'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, well, some concession might be made for your personal effects.\r\nBut nothing shall go out of the house unchecked.  My client is a very\r\nliberal man, but he has his fads and his own way of doing things.  It\r\nis everything or nothing with him.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then it must be nothing,' said I.  And there the matter was left, but\r\nthe whole thing seemed to me to be so unusual that I thought----\"\r\n\r\nHere we had a very extraordinary interruption.\r\n\r\nHolmes raised his hand for silence.  Then he strode across the room,\r\nflung open the door, and dragged in a great gaunt woman whom he had\r\nseized by the shoulder.  She entered with ungainly struggles, like some\r\nhuge awkward chicken, torn squawking out of its coop.\r\n\r\n\"Leave me alone!  What are you a-doin' of?\" she screeched.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Susan, what is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, ma'am, I was comin' in to ask if the visitors was stayin' for\r\nlunch when this man jumped out at me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been listening to her for the last five minutes, but did not\r\nwish to interrupt your most interesting narrative.  Just a little\r\nwheezy, Susan, are you not?  You breathe too heavily for that kind of\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\nSusan turned a sulky but amazed face upon her captor.  \"Who be you,\r\nanyhow, and what right have you a-pullin' me about like this?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was merely that I wished to ask a question in your presence.  Did\r\nyou, Mrs. Maberley, mention to anyone that you were going to write to\r\nme and consult me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mr. Holmes, I did not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who posted your letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Susan did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  Now, Susan, to whom was it that you wrote or sent a message\r\nto say that your mistress was asking advice from me?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a lie.  I sent no message.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Susan, wheezy people may not live long, you know.  It's a wicked\r\nthing to tell fibs.  Whom did you tell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Susan!\" cried her mistress, \"I believe you are a bad, treacherous\r\nwoman.  I remember now that I saw you speaking to someone over the\r\nhedge.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was my own business,\" said the woman sullenly.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I tell you that it was Barney Stockdale to whom you spoke?\"\r\nsaid Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you know, what do you want to ask for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not sure, but I know now.  Well now, Susan, it will be worth ten\r\npounds to you if you will tell me who is at the back of Barney.\"\r\n\r\n\"Someone that could lay down a thousand pounds for every ten you have\r\nin the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, a rich man?  No; you smiled--a rich woman.  Now we have got so\r\nfar, you may as well give the name and earn the tenner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see you in hell first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Susan!  Language!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am clearing out of here.  I've had enough of you all.  I'll send for\r\nmy box to-morrow.\"  She flounced for the door.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Susan.  Paregoric is the stuff....  Now,\" he continued,\r\nturning suddenly from lively to severe when the door had closed behind\r\nthe flushed and angry woman, \"this gang means business.  Look how close\r\nthey play the game.  Your letter to me had the 10 p.m. postmark.  And\r\nyet Susan passes the word to Barney.  Barney has time to go to his\r\nemployer and get instructions; he or she--I incline to the latter from\r\nSusan's grin when she thought I had blundered--forms a plan.  Black\r\nSteve is called in, and I am warned off by eleven o'clock next morning.\r\nThat's quick work, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do they want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's the question.  Who had the house before you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A retired sea captain, called Ferguson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything remarkable about him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that ever I heard of.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was wondering whether he could have buried something.  Of course,\r\nwhen people bury treasure nowadays they do it in the Post Office bank.\r\nBut there are always some lunatics about.  It would be a dull world\r\nwithout them.  At first I thought of some buried valuable.  But why, in\r\nthat case, should they want your furniture?  You don't happen to have a\r\nRaphael or a first folio Shakespeare without knowing it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't think I have anything rarer than a Crown Derby tea-set.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would hardly justify all this mystery.  Besides, why should they\r\nnot openly state what they want?  If they covet your tea-set, they can\r\nsurely offer a price for it without buying you out, lock, stock, and\r\nbarrel.  No, as I read it, there is something which you do not know\r\nthat you have, and which you would not give up if you did know.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is how I read it,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Watson agrees, so that settles it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, what can it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see whether by this purely mental analysis we can get it to a\r\nfiner point.  You have been in this house a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nearly two.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the better.  During this long period no one wants anything from\r\nyou.  Now suddenly within three or four days you have urgent demands.\r\nWhat would you gather from that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It can only mean,\" said I, \"that the object, whatever it may be, has\r\nonly just come into the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Settled once again,\" said Holmes.  \"Now, Mrs. Maberley, has any object\r\njust arrived?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I have bought nothing new this year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!  That is very remarkable.  Well, I think we had best let\r\nmatters develop a little further until we have clearer data.  Is that\r\nlawyer of yours a capable man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sutro is most capable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you another maid, or was the fair Susan, who has just banged your\r\nfront door, alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a young girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try and get Sutro to spend a night or two in the house.  You might\r\npossibly want protection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Against whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows?  The matter is certainly obscure.  If I can't find what\r\nthey are after, I must approach the matter from the other end, and try\r\nto get at the principal.  Did this house-agent man give any address?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply his card and occupation.  Haines-Johnson, Auctioneer and\r\nValuer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think we shall find him in the Directory.  Honest business men\r\ndon't conceal their place of business.  Well, you will let me know any\r\nfresh development.  I have taken up your case, and you may rely upon it\r\nthat I shall see it through.\"\r\n\r\nAs we passed through the hall Holmes's eyes, which missed nothing,\r\nlighted upon several trunks and cases which were piled in the corner.\r\nThe labels shone out upon them.\r\n\r\n\"'Milano.'  'Lucerne.'  These are from Italy.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are poor Douglas's things.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not unpacked them?  How long have you had them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They arrived last week.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you said--why, surely this might be the missing link.  How do we\r\nknow that there is not something of value there?\"\r\n\r\n\"There could not possibly be, Mr. Holmes.  Poor Douglas had only his\r\npay and a small annuity.  What could he have of value?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes was lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\"Delay no longer, Mrs. Maberley,\" he said at last.  \"Have these things\r\ntaken upstairs to your bedroom.  Examine them as soon as possible and\r\nsee what they contain.  I will come to-morrow and hear your report.\"\r\n\r\nIt was quite evident that The Three Gables was under very close\r\nsurveillance, for as we came round the high hedge at the end of the\r\nlane there was the negro prize-fighter standing in the shadow.  We came\r\non him quite suddenly, and a grim and menacing figure he looked in that\r\nlonely place.  Holmes clapped his hand to his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Lookin' for your gun, Masser Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; for my scent-bottle, Steve.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are funny, Masser Holmes, ain't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't be funny for you, Steve, if I get after you.  I gave you fair\r\nwarning this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Masser Holmes, I done gone think over what you said, and I don't\r\nwant no more talk about that affair of Masser Perkins.  S'pose I can\r\nhelp you, Masser Holmes, I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, tell me who is behind you on this job?\"\r\n\r\n\"So help me the Lord!  Masser Holmes, I told you the truth before.  I\r\ndon't know.  My boss Barney gives me orders and that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, just bear in mind, Steve, that the lady in that house, and\r\neverything under that roof, is under my protection.  Don't you forget\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Masser Holmes.  I'll remember.'\r\n\r\n\"I've got him thoroughly frightened for his own skin, Watson,\" Holmes\r\nremarked as we walked on.  \"I think he would double-cross his employer\r\nif he knew who he was.  It was lucky I had some knowledge of the\r\nSpencer John crowd, and that Steve was one of them.  Now, Watson, this\r\nis a case for Langdale Pike, and I am going to see him now.  When I get\r\nback I may be clearer in the matter.\"\r\n\r\nI saw no more of Holmes during the day, but I could well imagine how he\r\nspent it, for Langdale Pike was his human book of reference upon all\r\nmatters of social scandal.  This strange, languid creature spent his\r\nwaking hours in the bow window of a St. James's Street club, and was\r\nthe receiving-station, as well as the transmitter, for all the gossip\r\nof the Metropolis.  He made, it was said, a four-figure income by the\r\nparagraphs which he contributed every week to the garbage papers which\r\ncater for an inquisitive public.  If ever, far down in the turbid\r\ndepths of London life, there was some strange swirl or eddy, it was\r\nmarked with automatic exactness by this human dial upon the surface.\r\nHolmes discreetly helped Langdale to knowledge, and on occasion was\r\nhelped in turn.\r\n\r\nWhen I met my friend in his room early next morning, I was conscious\r\nfrom his bearing that all was well, but none the less a most unpleasant\r\nsurprise was awaiting us.  It took the shape of the following telegram:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Please come out at once.  Client's house burgled in the night.  Police\r\nin possession.\r\n\r\n\"SUTRO.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHolmes whistled.  \"The drama has come to a crisis, and quicker than I\r\nhad expected.  There is a great driving-power at the back of this\r\nbusiness, Watson, which does not surprise me after what I have heard.\r\nThis Sutro, of course, is her lawyer.  I made a mistake, I fear, in not\r\nasking you to spend the night on guard.  This fellow has clearly proved\r\na broken reed.  Well, there is nothing for it but another journey to\r\nHarrow Weald.\"\r\n\r\nWe found The Three Gables a very different establishment to the orderly\r\nhousehold of the previous day.  A small group of idlers had assembled\r\nat the garden gate, while a couple of constables were examining the\r\nwindows and the geranium beds.  Within we met a grey old gentleman, who\r\nintroduced himself as the lawyer, together with a bustling, rubicund\r\nInspector, who greeted Holmes as an old friend.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, no chance for you in this case, I'm afraid.  Just a\r\ncommon, ordinary burglary, and well within the capacity of the poor old\r\npolice.  No experts need apply.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure the case is in very good hands,\" said Holmes.  \"Merely a\r\ncommon burglary, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.  We know pretty well who the men are and where to find them.\r\nIt is that gang of Barney Stockdale, with the big nigger in it--they've\r\nbeen seen about here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent!  What did they get?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they don't seem to have got much.  Mrs. Maberley was\r\nchloroformed and the house was----  Ah! here is the lady herself.\"\r\n\r\nOur friend of yesterday, looking very pale and ill, had entered the\r\nroom, leaning upon a little maid-servant.\r\n\r\n\"You gave me good advice, Mr. Holmes,\" said she, smiling ruefully.\r\n\"Alas, I did not take it!  I did not wish to trouble Mr. Sutro, and so\r\nI was unprotected.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only heard of it this morning,\" the lawyer explained.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes advised me to have some friend in the house.  I neglected\r\nhis advice, and I have paid for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You look wretchedly ill,\" said Holmes.  \"Perhaps you are hardly equal\r\nto telling me what occurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is all here,\" said the Inspector, tapping a bulky notebook.\r\n\r\n\"Still, if the lady is not too exhausted----\"\r\n\r\n\"There is really so little to tell.  I have no doubt that wicked Susan\r\nhad planned an entrance for them.  They must have known the house to an\r\ninch.  I was conscious for a moment of the chloroform rag which was\r\nthrust over my mouth, but I have no notion how long I may have been\r\nsenseless.  When I woke, one man was at the bedside and another was\r\nrising with a bundle in his hand from among my son's baggage, which was\r\npartially opened and littered over the floor.  Before he could get away\r\nI sprang up and seized him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You took a big risk,\" said the Inspector.\r\n\r\n\"I clung to him, but he shook me off, and the other may have struck me,\r\nfor I can remember no more.  Mary the maid heard the noise and began\r\nscreaming out of the window.  That brought the police, but the rascals\r\nhad got away.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did they take?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't think there is anything of value missing.  I am sure\r\nthere was nothing in my son's trunks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the men leave no clue?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was one sheet of paper which I may have torn from the man that I\r\ngrasped.  It was lying all crumpled on the floor.  It is in my son's\r\nhandwriting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which means that it is not of much use,\" said the Inspector.  \"Now if\r\nit had been in the burglar's----\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said Holmes.  \"What rugged common sense!  None the less, I\r\nshould be curious to see it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Inspector drew a folded sheet of foolscap from his pocket-book.\r\n\r\n\"I never pass anything, however trifling,\" said he, with some\r\npomposity.  \"That is my advice to you, Mr. Holmes.  In twenty-five\r\nyears' experience I have learned my lesson.  There is always the chance\r\nof finger-marks or something.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes inspected the sheet of paper.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of it, Inspector?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems to be the end of some queer novel, so far as I can see.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may certainly prove to be the end of a queer tale,\" said Holmes.\r\n\"You have noticed the number on the top of the page.  It is two hundred\r\nand forty-five.  Where are the odd two hundred and forty-four pages?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose the burglars got those.  Much good may it do them!\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems a queer thing to break into a house in order to steal such\r\npapers as that.  Does it suggest anything to you, Inspector?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; it suggests that in their hurry the rascals just grabbed at\r\nwhat came first to hand.  I wish them joy of what they got.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should they go to my son's things?\" asked Mrs. Maberley.\r\n\r\n\"Well, they found nothing valuable downstairs, so they tried their luck\r\nupstairs.  That is how I read it.  What do you make of it, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must think it over, Inspector.  Come to the window, Watson.\"  Then,\r\nas we stood together, he read over the fragment of paper.  It began in\r\nthe middle of a sentence and ran like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"... face bled considerably from the cuts and blows, but it was nothing\r\nto the bleeding of his heart as he saw that lovely face, the face for\r\nwhich he had been prepared to sacrifice his very life, looking out at\r\nhis agony and humiliation.  She smiled--yes, by Heaven! she smiled,\r\nlike the heartless fiend she was, as he looked up at her.  It was at\r\nthat moment that love died and hate was born.  Man must live for\r\nsomething.  If it is not for your embrace, my lady, then it shall\r\nsurely be for your undoing and my complete revenge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Queer grammar!\" said Holmes, with a smile, as he handed the paper back\r\nto the Inspector.  \"Did you notice how the 'he' suddenly changed to\r\n'my.'  The writer was so carried away by his own story that he imagined\r\nhimself at the supreme moment to be the hero.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seemed mighty poor stuff,\" said the Inspector, as he replaced it in\r\nhis book.  \"What! are you off, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think there is anything more for me to do now that the case is\r\nin such capable hands.  By the way, Mrs. Maberley, did you say you\r\nwished to travel?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has always been my dream, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where would you like to go--Cairo, Madeira, the Riviera?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! if I had the money I would go round the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.  Round the world.  Well, good morning.  I may drop you a\r\nline in the evening.\"  As we passed the window I caught a glimpse of\r\nthe Inspector's smile and shake of the head.  \"These clever fellows\r\nhave always a touch of madness.\"  That was what I read in the\r\nInspector's smile.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Watson, we are at the last lap of our little journey,\" said\r\nHolmes, when we were back in the roar of Central London once more.  \"I\r\nthink we had best clear the matter up at once, and it would be well\r\nthat you should come with me, for it is safer to have a witness when\r\nyou are dealing with such a lady as Isadora Klein.\"\r\n\r\nWe had taken a cab and were speeding to some address in Grosvenor\r\nSquare.  Holmes had been sunk in thought, but he roused himself\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Watson, I suppose you see it all clearly?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I can't say that I do.  I only gather that we are going to see the\r\nlady who is behind all this mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!  But does the name Isadora Klein convey nothing to you?  She\r\nwas, of course, the celebrated beauty.  There was never a woman to\r\ntouch her.  She is pure Spanish, the real blood of the masterful\r\nConquistadors, and her people have been leaders in Pernambuco for\r\ngenerations.  She married the aged German sugar king, Klein, and\r\npresently found herself the richest as well as the most lovely widow\r\nupon earth.  Then there was an interval of adventure when she pleased\r\nher own tastes.  She had several lovers, and Douglas Maberley, one of\r\nthe most striking men in London, was one of them.  It was by all\r\naccounts more than an adventure with him.  He was not a Society\r\nbutterfly, but a strong, proud man who gave and expected all.  But she\r\nis the '_belle dame sans merci_' of fiction.  When her caprice is\r\nsatisfied, the matter is ended, and if the other party in the matter\r\ncan't take her word for it, she knows how to bring it home to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that was his own story----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you are piecing it together now.  I hear that she is about to\r\nmarry the young Duke of Lomond, who might almost be her son.  His\r\nGrace's ma might overlook the age, but a big scandal would be a\r\ndifferent matter, so it is imperative----  Ah! here we are.\"\r\n\r\nIt was one of the finest corner-houses of the West End.  A machine-like\r\nfootman took up our cards and returned with word that the lady was not\r\nat home.  \"Then we shall wait until she is,\" said Holmes cheerfully.\r\n\r\nThe machine broke down.\r\n\r\n\"Not at home means not at home to _you_,\" said the footman.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" Holmes answered.  \"That means that we shall not have to wait.\r\nKindly give this note to your mistress.\"\r\n\r\nHe scribbled three or four words upon a sheet of his notebook, folded\r\nit, and handed it to the man.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say, Holmes?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I simply wrote 'Shall it be the police, then?' I think that should\r\npass us in.\"\r\n\r\nIt did--with amazing celerity.  A minute later we were in an\r\nArabian-nights' drawing-room, vast and wonderful, in a half gloom,\r\npicked out with an occasional pink electric light.  The lady had come,\r\nI felt, to that time of life when even the proudest beauty finds the\r\nhalf-light more welcome.  She rose from a settee as we entered: tall,\r\nqueenly, a perfect figure, a lovely mask-like face, with two wonderful\r\nSpanish eyes which looked murder at us both.\r\n\r\n\"What is this intrusion--and this insulting message?\" she asked,\r\nholding up the slip of paper.\r\n\r\n\"I need not explain, madame.  I have too much respect for your\r\nintelligence to do so--though I confess that intelligence has been\r\nsurprisingly at fault of late.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"By supposing that your hired bullies could frighten me from my work.\r\nSurely no man would take up my profession if it were not that danger\r\nattracts him.  It was you, then, who forced me to examine the case of\r\nyoung Maberley.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no idea what you are talking about.  What have I to do with\r\nhired bullies?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes turned away wearily.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have underrated your intelligence.  Well, good afternoon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!  Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Scotland Yard.\"\r\n\r\nWe had not got half-way to the door before she had overtaken us and was\r\nholding his arm.  She had turned in a moment from steel to velvet.\r\n\r\n\"Come and sit down, gentlemen.  Let us talk this matter over.  I feel\r\nthat I may be frank with you, Mr. Holmes.  You have the feelings of a\r\ngentleman.  How quick a woman's instinct is to find it out.  I will\r\ntreat you as a friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot promise to reciprocate, madame.  I am not the law, but I\r\nrepresent justice so far as my feeble powers go.  I am ready to listen,\r\nand then I will tell you how I will act.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt it was foolish of me to threaten a brave man like yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was really foolish, madame, is that you have placed yourself in\r\nthe power of a band of rascals who may blackmail or give you away.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!  I am not so simple.  Since I have promised to be frank, I may\r\nsay that no one, save Barney Stockdale and Susan, his wife, have the\r\nleast idea who their employer is.  As to them, well, it is not the\r\nfirst----\"  She smiled and nodded, with a charming coquettish intimacy.\r\n\r\n\"I see.  You've tested them before.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are good hounds who run silent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such hounds have a way sooner or later of biting the hand that feeds\r\nthem.  They will be arrested for this burglary.  The police are already\r\nafter them.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will take what comes to them.  That is what they are paid for.  I\r\nshall not appear in the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless I bring you into it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; you would not.  You are a gentleman.  It is a woman's secret.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place you must give back this manuscript.\"\r\n\r\nShe broke into a ripple of laughter, and walked to the fireplace.\r\nThere was a calcined mass which she broke up with the poker.  \"Shall I\r\ngive this back?\" she asked.  So roguish and exquisite did she look as\r\nshe stood before us with a challenging smile that I felt of all\r\nHolmes's criminals this was the one whom he would find it hardest to\r\nface.  However, he was immune from sentiment.\r\n\r\n\"That seals your fate,\" he said coldly.  \"You are very prompt in your\r\nactions, madame, but you have overdone it on this occasion.\"\r\n\r\nShe threw the poker down with a clatter.\r\n\r\n\"How hard you are!\" she cried.  \"May I tell you the whole story?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fancy I could tell it to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you must look at it with my eyes, Mr. Holmes.  You must realize it\r\nfrom the point of view of a woman who sees all her life's ambition\r\nabout to be ruined at the last moment.  Is such a woman to be blamed if\r\nshe protects herself?\"\r\n\r\n\"The original sin was yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!  I admit it.  He was a dear boy, Douglas, but it so chanced\r\nthat he could not fit into my plans.  He wanted marriage--marriage, Mr.\r\nHolmes--with a penniless commoner.  Nothing less would serve him.  Then\r\nhe became pertinacious.  Because I had given he seemed to think that I\r\nstill must give, and to him only.  It was intolerable.  At last I had\r\nto make him realize it.\"\r\n\r\n\"By hiring ruffians to beat him under your own window.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do indeed seem to know everything.  Well, it is true.  Barney and\r\nthe boys drove him away, and were, I admit, a little rough in doing so.\r\nBut what did he do then?  Could I have believed that a gentleman would\r\ndo such an act?  He wrote a book in which he described his own story.\r\nI, of course, was the wolf; he the lamb.  It was all there, under\r\ndifferent names, of course; but who in all London would have failed to\r\nrecognize it?  What do you say to that, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he was within his rights.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was as if the air of Italy had got into his blood and brought with\r\nit the old cruel Italian spirit.  He wrote to me and sent me a copy of\r\nhis book that I might have the torture of anticipation.  There were two\r\ncopies, he said--one for me, one for his publisher.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you know the publisher's had not reached him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew who his publisher was.  It is not his only novel, you know.  I\r\nfound out that he had not heard from Italy.  Then came Douglas's sudden\r\ndeath.  So long as that other manuscript was in the world there was no\r\nsafety for me.  Of course, it must be among his effects, and these\r\nwould be returned to his mother.  I set the gang at work.  One of them\r\ngot into the house as servant.  I wanted to do the thing honestly.  I\r\nreally and truly did.  I was ready to buy the house and everything in\r\nit.  I offered any price she cared to ask.  I only tried the other way\r\nwhen everything else had failed.  Now, Mr. Holmes, granting that I was\r\ntoo hard on Douglas--and, God knows, I am sorry for it!--what else\r\ncould I do with my whole future at stake?\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"I suppose I shall have to compound a felony as\r\nusual.  How much does it cost to go round the world in first-class\r\nstyle?\"\r\n\r\nThe lady stared in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Could it be done on five thousand pounds?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I should think so, indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good.  I think you will sign me a cheque for that, and I will see\r\nthat it comes to Mrs. Maberley.  You owe her a little change of air.\r\nMeantime, lady\"--he wagged a cautionary forefinger--\"have a care!  Have\r\na care!  You can't play with edged tools for ever without cutting those\r\ndainty hands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE SUSSEX VAMPIRE\r\n\r\nHolmes had read carefully a note which the last post had brought him.\r\nThen, with the dry chuckle which was his nearest approach to a laugh,\r\nhe tossed it over to me.\r\n\r\n\"For a mixture of the modern and the mediæval, of the practical and of\r\nthe wildly fanciful, I think this is surely the limit,\" said he.  \"What\r\ndo you make of it, Watson?\"\r\n\r\nI read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n46, OLD JEWRY,\r\n    _Nov._ 19_th._\r\n\r\n_Re_ Vampires.\r\n\r\nSIR,--\r\n\r\nOur client, Mr. Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson and Muirhead, tea brokers,\r\nof Mincing Lane, has made some inquiry from us in a communication of\r\neven date concerning vampires.  As our firm specializes entirely upon\r\nthe assessment of machinery the matter hardly comes within our purview,\r\nand we have therefore recommended Mr. Ferguson to call upon you and lay\r\nthe matter before you.  We have not forgotten your successful action in\r\nthe case of Matilda Briggs.\r\n\r\nWe are, Sir, Faithfully yours,\r\n    MORRISON, MORRISON, AND DODD.\r\n        per E. J. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Matilda Briggs was not the name of a young woman, Watson,\" said\r\nHolmes, in a reminiscent voice.  \"It was a ship which is associated\r\nwith the giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet\r\nprepared.  But what do we know about vampires?  Does it come within our\r\npurview either?  Anything is better than stagnation, but really we seem\r\nto have been switched on to a Grimm's fairy tale.  Make a long arm,\r\nWatson, and see what V has to say.\"\r\n\r\nI leaned back and took down the great index volume to which he\r\nreferred.  Holmes balanced it on his knee and his eyes moved slowly and\r\nlovingly over the record of old cases, mixed with the accumulated\r\ninformation of a lifetime.\r\n\r\n\"Voyage of the Gloria Scott,\" he read.  \"That was a bad business.  I\r\nhave some recollection that you made a record of it, Watson, though I\r\nwas unable to congratulate you upon the result.  Victor Lynch, the\r\nforger.  Venomous lizard or gila.  Remarkable case, that!  Vittoria,\r\nthe circus belle.  Vanderbilt and the Yeggman.  Vipers.  Vigor, the\r\nHammersmith wonder.  Hullo!  Hullo!  Good old index.  You can't beat\r\nit.  Listen to this, Watson.  Vampirism in Hungary.  And again,\r\nVampires in Transylvania.\"  He turned over the pages with eagerness,\r\nbut after a short intent perusal he threw down the great book with a\r\nsnarl of disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"Rubbish, Watson, rubbish!  What have we to do with walking corpses who\r\ncan only be held in their grave by stakes driven through their hearts?\r\nIt's pure lunacy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely,\" said I, \"the vampire was not necessarily a dead man?  A\r\nliving person might have the habit.  I have read, for example, of the\r\nold sucking the blood of the young in order to retain their youth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Watson.  It mentions the legend in one of these\r\nreferences.  But are we to give serious attention to such things?  This\r\nAgency stands flat-footed upon the ground, and there it must remain.\r\nThe world is big enough for us.  No ghosts need apply.  I fear that we\r\ncannot take Mr. Robert Ferguson very seriously.  Possibly this note may\r\nbe from him, and may throw some light upon what is worrying him.\"\r\n\r\nHe took up a second letter which had lain unnoticed upon the table\r\nwhilst he had been absorbed with the first.  This he began to read with\r\na smile of amusement upon his face which gradually faded away into an\r\nexpression of intense interest and concentration.  When he had finished\r\nhe sat for some little time lost in thought with the letter dangling\r\nfrom his fingers.  Finally, with a start, he aroused himself from his\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\n\"Cheeseman's, Lamberley.  Where is Lamberley, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is in Sussex, south of Horsham.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very far, eh?  And Cheeseman's?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that country, Holmes.  It is full of old houses which are named\r\nafter the men who built them centuries ago.  You get Odley's and\r\nHarvey's and Carriton's--the folk are forgotten but their names live in\r\ntheir houses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" said Holmes coldly.  It was one of the peculiarities of\r\nhis proud, self-contained nature that, though he docketed any fresh\r\ninformation very quickly and accurately in his brain, he seldom made\r\nany acknowledgment to the giver.  \"I rather fancy we shall know a good\r\ndeal more about Cheeseman's, Lamberley, before we are through.  The\r\nletter is, as I had hoped, from Robert Ferguson.  By the way, he claims\r\nacquaintance with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"With me!\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better read it.\"\r\n\r\nHe handed the letter across.  It was headed with the address quoted.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. HOLMES, (it said)--I have been recommended to you by my\r\nlawyers, but indeed the matter is so extraordinarily delicate that it\r\nis most difficult to discuss.  It concerns a friend for whom I am\r\nacting.  This gentleman married some five years ago a Peruvian lady,\r\nthe daughter of a Peruvian merchant, whom he had met in connection with\r\nthe importation of nitrates.  The lady was very beautiful, but the fact\r\nof her foreign birth and of her alien religion always caused a\r\nseparation of interests and of feelings between husband and wife, so\r\nthat after a time his love may have cooled towards her and he may have\r\ncome to regard their union as a mistake.  He felt there were sides of\r\nher character which he could never explore or understand.  This was the\r\nmore painful as she was as loving a wife as a man could have--to all\r\nappearance absolutely devoted.\r\n\r\nNow for the point which I will make more plain when we meet.  Indeed,\r\nthis note is merely to give you a general idea of the situation and to\r\nascertain whether you would care to interest yourself in the matter.\r\nThe lady began to show some curious traits quite alien to her\r\nordinarily sweet and gentle disposition.  The gentleman had been\r\nmarried twice and he had one son by the first wife.  This boy was now\r\nfifteen, a very charming and affectionate youth, though unhappily\r\ninjured through an accident in childhood.  Twice the wife was caught in\r\nthe act of assaulting this poor lad in the most unprovoked way.  Once\r\nshe struck him with a stick and left a great weal on his arm.\r\n\r\nThis was a small matter, however, compared with her conduct to her own\r\nchild, a dear boy just under one year of age.  On one occasion about a\r\nmonth ago this child had been left by its nurse for a few minutes.  A\r\nloud cry from the baby, as of pain, called the nurse back.  As she ran\r\ninto the room she saw her employer, the lady, leaning over the baby and\r\napparently biting his neck.  There was a small wound in the neck, from\r\nwhich a stream of blood had escaped.  The nurse was so horrified that\r\nshe wished to call the husband, but the lady implored her not to do so,\r\nand actually gave her five pounds as a price for her silence.  No\r\nexplanation was ever given, and for the moment the matter was passed\r\nover.\r\n\r\nIt left, however, a terrible impression upon the nurse's mind, and from\r\nthat time she began to watch her mistress closely, and to keep a closer\r\nguard upon the baby, whom she tenderly loved.  It seemed to her that\r\neven as she watched the mother, so the mother watched her, and that\r\nevery time she was compelled to leave the baby alone the mother was\r\nwaiting to get at it.  Day and night the nurse covered the child, and\r\nday and night the silent, watchful mother seemed to be lying in wait as\r\na wolf waits for a lamb.  It must read most incredible to you, and yet\r\nI beg you to take it seriously, for a child's life and a man's sanity\r\nmay depend upon it.\r\n\r\nAt last there came one dreadful day when the facts could no longer be\r\nconcealed from the husband.  The nurse's nerve had given way; she could\r\nstand the strain no longer, and she made a clean breast of it all to\r\nthe man.  To him it seemed as wild a tale as it may now seem to you.\r\nHe knew his wife to be a loving wife, and, save for the assaults upon\r\nher stepson, a loving mother.  Why, then, should she wound her own dear\r\nlittle baby?  He told the nurse that she was dreaming, that her\r\nsuspicions were those of a lunatic, and that such libels upon her\r\nmistress were not to be tolerated.  Whilst they were talking, a sudden\r\ncry of pain was heard.  Nurse and master rushed together to the\r\nnursery.  Imagine his feelings, Mr. Holmes, as he saw his wife rise\r\nfrom a kneeling position beside the cot, and saw blood upon the child's\r\nexposed neck and upon the sheet.  With a cry of horror, he turned his\r\nwife's face to the light and saw blood all round her lips.  It was\r\nshe--she beyond all question--who had drunk the poor baby's blood.\r\n\r\nSo the matter stands.  She is now confined to her room.  There has been\r\nno explanation.  The husband is half demented.  He knows, and I know,\r\nlittle of Vampirism beyond the name.  We had thought it was some wild\r\ntale of foreign parts.  And yet here in the very heart of the English\r\nSussex--well, all this can be discussed with you in the morning.  Will\r\nyou see me?  Will you use your great powers in aiding a distracted man?\r\nIf so, kindly wire to Ferguson, Cheeseman's, Lamberley, and I will be\r\nat your rooms by ten o'clock.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n    ROBERT FERGUSON.\r\n\r\nPS.--I believe your friend Watson played Rugby for Blackheath when I\r\nwas three-quarter for Richmond.  It is the only personal introduction\r\nwhich I can give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Of course I remember him,\" said I, as I laid down the letter.  \"Big\r\nBob Ferguson, the finest three-quarter Richmond ever had.  He was\r\nalways a good-natured chap.  It's like him to be so concerned over a\r\nfriend's case.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I never get your limits, Watson,\" said he.  \"There are unexplored\r\npossibilities about you.  Take a wire down, like a good fellow.  'Will\r\nexamine your case with pleasure.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_Your_ case!\"\r\n\r\n\"We must not let him think that this Agency is a home for the\r\nweak-minded.  Of course it is his case.  Send him that wire and let the\r\nmatter rest till morning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPromptly at ten o'clock next morning Ferguson strode into our room.  I\r\nhad remembered him as a long, slab-sided man with loose limbs and a\r\nfine turn of speed, which had carried him round many an opposing back.\r\nThere is surely nothing in life more painful than to meet the wreck of\r\na fine athlete whom one has known in his prime.  His great frame had\r\nfallen in, his flaxen hair was scanty, and his shoulders were bowed.  I\r\nfear that I roused corresponding emotions in him.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Watson,\" said he, and his voice was still deep and hearty.\r\n\"You don't look quite the man you did when I threw you over the ropes\r\ninto the crowd at the Old Deer Park.  I expect I have changed a bit\r\nalso.  But it's this last day or two that has aged me.  I see by your\r\ntelegram, Mr. Holmes, that it is no use my pretending to be anyone's\r\ndeputy.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is simpler to deal direct,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is.  But you can imagine how difficult it is when you are\r\nspeaking of the one woman whom you are bound to protect and help.  What\r\ncan I do?  How am I to go to the police with such a story?  And yet the\r\nkiddies have got to be protected.  Is it madness, Mr. Holmes?  Is it\r\nsomething in the blood?  Have you any similar case in your experience?\r\nFor God's sake, give me some advice, for I am at my wits' end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very naturally, Mr. Ferguson.  Now sit here and pull yourself together\r\nand give me a few clear answers.  I can assure you that I am very far\r\nfrom being at my wits' end, and that I am confident we shall find some\r\nsolution.  First of all, tell me what steps you have taken.  Is your\r\nwife still near the children?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had a dreadful scene.  She is a most loving woman, Mr. Holmes.  If\r\never a woman loved a man with all her heart and soul, she loves me.\r\nShe was cut to the heart that I should have discovered this horrible,\r\nthis incredible, secret.  She would not even speak.  She gave no answer\r\nto my reproaches, save to gaze at me with a sort of wild, despairing\r\nlook in her eyes.  Then she rushed to her room and locked herself in.\r\nSince then she has refused to see me.  She has a maid who was with her\r\nbefore her marriage, Dolores by name--a friend rather than a servant.\r\nShe takes her food to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the child is in no immediate danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Mason, the nurse, has sworn that she will not leave it night or\r\nday.  I can absolutely trust her.  I am more uneasy about poor little\r\nJack, for, as I told you in my note, he has twice been assaulted by\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"But never wounded?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; she struck him savagely.  It is the more terrible as he is a poor\r\nlittle inoffensive cripple.\"  Ferguson's gaunt features softened as he\r\nspoke of his boy.  \"You would think that the dear lad's condition would\r\nsoften anyone's heart.  A fall in childhood and a twisted spine, Mr.\r\nHolmes.  But the dearest, most loving heart within.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes had picked up the letter of yesterday and was reading it over.\r\n\"What other inmates are there in your house, Mr. Ferguson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two servants who have not been long with us.  One stable-hand,\r\nMichael, who sleeps in the house.  My wife, myself, my boy Jack, baby,\r\nDolores, and Mrs. Mason.  That is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I gather that you did not know your wife well at the time of your\r\nmarriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had only known her a few weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long had this maid Dolores been with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then your wife's character would really be better known by Dolores\r\nthan by you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you may say so.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes made a note.\r\n\r\n\"I fancy,\" said he, \"that I may be of more use at Lamberley than here.\r\nIt is eminently a case for personal investigation.  If the lady remains\r\nin her room, our presence could not annoy or inconvenience her.  Of\r\ncourse, we would stay at the inn.\"\r\n\r\nFerguson gave a gesture of relief.\r\n\r\n\"It is what I hoped, Mr. Holmes.  There is an excellent train at two\r\nfrom Victoria, if you could come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we could come.  There is a lull at present.  I can give you\r\nmy undivided energies.  Watson, of course, comes with us.  But there\r\nare one or two points upon which I wish to be very sure before I start.\r\nThis unhappy lady, as I understand it, has appeared to assault both the\r\nchildren, her own baby and your little son?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the assaults take different forms, do they not?  She has beaten\r\nyour son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once with a stick and once very savagely with her hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she give no explanation why she struck him?\"\r\n\r\n\"None, save that she hated him.  Again and again she said so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is not unknown among stepmothers.  A posthumous jealousy,\r\nwe will say.  Is the lady jealous by nature?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she is very jealous--jealous with all the strength of her fiery\r\ntropical love.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the boy--he is fifteen, I understand, and probably very developed\r\nin mind, since his body has been circumscribed in action.  Did he give\r\nyou no explanation of these assaults?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; he declared there was no reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were they good friends at other times?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; there was never any love between them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet you say he is affectionate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never in the world could there be so devoted a son.  My life is his\r\nlife.  He is absorbed in what I say or do.\"\r\n\r\nOnce again Holmes made a note.  For some time he sat lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt you and the boy were great comrades before this second\r\nmarriage.  You were thrown very close together, were you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the boy, having so affectionate a nature, was devoted, no doubt,\r\nto the memory of his mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most devoted.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would certainly seem to be a most interesting lad.  There is one\r\nother point about these assaults.  Were the strange attacks upon the\r\nbaby and the assaults upon your son at the same period?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first case it was so.  It was as if some frenzy had seized her,\r\nand she had vented her rage upon both.  In the second case it was only\r\nJack who suffered.  Mrs. Mason had no complaint to make about the baby.\"\r\n\r\n\"That certainly complicates matters.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't quite follow you, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly not.  One forms provisional theories and waits for time or\r\nfuller knowledge to explode them.  A bad habit, Mr. Ferguson; but human\r\nnature is weak.  I fear that your old friend here has given an\r\nexaggerated view of my scientific methods.  However, I will only say at\r\nthe present stage that your problem does not appear to me to be\r\ninsoluble, and that you may expect to find us at Victoria at two\r\no'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was evening of a dull, foggy November day when, having left our bags\r\nat the \"Chequers,\" Lamberley, we drove through the Sussex clay of a\r\nlong winding lane, and finally reached the isolated and ancient\r\nfarm-house in which Ferguson dwelt.  It was a large, straggling\r\nbuilding, very old in the centre, very new at the wings, with towering\r\nTudor chimneys and a lichen-spotted, high-pitched roof of Horsham\r\nslabs.  The doorsteps were worn into curves, and the ancient tiles\r\nwhich lined the porch were marked with the rebus of a cheese and a man,\r\nafter the original builder.  Within, the ceilings were corrugated with\r\nheavy oaken beams, and the uneven floors sagged into sharp curves.  An\r\nodour of age and decay pervaded the whole crumbling building.\r\n\r\nThere was one very large central room, into which Ferguson led us.\r\nHere, in a huge old-fashioned fireplace with an iron screen behind it\r\ndated 1670, there blazed and spluttered a splendid log fire.\r\n\r\nThe room, as I gazed round, was a most singular mixture of dates and of\r\nplaces.  The half-panelled walls may well have belonged to the original\r\nyeoman farmer of the seventeenth century.  They were ornamented,\r\nhowever, on the lower part by a line of well-chosen modern\r\nwater-colours; while above, where yellow plaster took the place of oak,\r\nthere was hung a fine collection of South American utensils and\r\nweapons, which had been brought, no doubt, by the Peruvian lady\r\nupstairs.  Holmes rose, with that quick curiosity which sprang from his\r\neager mind, and examined them with some care.  He returned with his\r\neyes full of thought.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\" he cried.  \"Hullo!\"\r\n\r\nA spaniel had lain in a basket in the corner.  It came slowly forward\r\ntowards its master, walking with difficulty.  Its hind-legs moved\r\nirregularly and its tail was on the ground.  It licked Ferguson's hand.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"The dog.  What's the matter with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what puzzled the vet.  A sort of paralysis.  Spinal meningitis,\r\nhe thought.  But it is passing.  He'll be all right soon--won't you,\r\nCarlo?\"\r\n\r\nA shiver of assent passed through the drooping tail.  The dog's\r\nmournful eyes passed from one of us to the other.  He knew that we were\r\ndiscussing his case.\r\n\r\n\"Did it come on suddenly?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a single night.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"It may have been four months ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very remarkable.  Very suggestive.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you see in it, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"A confirmation of what I had already thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, what do you think, Mr. Holmes?  It may be a mere\r\nintellectual puzzle to you, but it is life and death to me!  My wife a\r\nwould-be murderer--my child in constant danger!  Don't play with me,\r\nMr. Holmes.  It is too terribly serious.\"\r\n\r\nThe big Rugby three-quarter was trembling all over.  Holmes put his\r\nhand soothingly upon his arm.\r\n\r\n\"I fear that there is pain for you, Mr. Ferguson, whatever the solution\r\nmay be,\" said he.  \"I would spare you all I can.  I cannot say more for\r\nthe instant, but before I leave this house I hope I may have something\r\ndefinite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please God you may!  If you will excuse me, gentlemen, I will go up to\r\nmy wife's room and see if there has been any change.\"\r\n\r\nHe was away some minutes, during which Holmes resumed his examination\r\nof the curiosities upon the wall.  When our host returned it was clear\r\nfrom his downcast face that he had made no progress.  He brought with\r\nhim a tall, slim, brown-faced girl.\r\n\r\n\"The tea is ready, Dolores,\" said Ferguson.  \"See that your mistress\r\nhas everything she can wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"She verra ill,\" cried the girl, looking with indignant eyes at her\r\nmaster.  \"She no ask for food.  She verra ill.  She need doctor.  I\r\nfrightened stay alone with her without doctor.\"\r\n\r\nFerguson looked at me with a question in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I should be so glad if I could be of use.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would your mistress see Dr. Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"I take him.  I no ask leave.  She needs doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll come with you at once.\"\r\n\r\nI followed the girl, who was quivering with strong emotion, up the\r\nstaircase and down an ancient corridor.  At the end was an iron-clamped\r\nand massive door.  It struck me as I looked at it that if Ferguson\r\ntried to force his way to his wife he would find it no easy matter.\r\nThe girl drew a key from her pocket, and the heavy oaken planks creaked\r\nupon their old hinges.  I passed in and she swiftly followed, fastening\r\nthe door behind her.\r\n\r\nOn the bed a woman was lying who was clearly in a high fever.  She was\r\nonly half conscious, but as I entered she raised a pair of frightened\r\nbut beautiful eyes and glared at me in apprehension.  Seeing a\r\nstranger, she appeared to be relieved, and sank back with a sigh upon\r\nthe pillow.  I stepped up to her with a few reassuring words, and she\r\nlay still while I took her pulse and temperature.  Both were high, and\r\nyet my impression was that the condition was rather that of mental and\r\nnervous excitement than of any actual seizure.\r\n\r\n\"She lie like that one day, two day.  I 'fraid she die,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\nThe woman turned her flushed and handsome face towards me.\r\n\r\n\"Where is my husband?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is below, and would wish to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not see him.  I will not see him.\"  Then she seemed to wander\r\noff into delirium.  \"A fiend!  A fiend!  Oh, what shall I do with this\r\ndevil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I help you in any way?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  No one can help.  It is finished.  All is destroyed.  Do what I\r\nwill, all is destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman must have some strange delusion.  I could not see honest Bob\r\nFerguson in the character of fiend or devil.\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" I said, \"your husband loves you dearly.  He is deeply grieved\r\nat this happening.\"\r\n\r\nAgain she turned on me those glorious eyes.\r\n\r\n\"He loves me.  Yes.  But do I not love him?  Do I not love him even to\r\nsacrifice myself rather than break his dear heart.  That is how I love\r\nhim.  And yet he could think of me--he could speak of me so.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is full of grief, but he cannot understand.\r\n\r\n\"No, he cannot understand.  But he should trust.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you not see him?\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"No, no; I cannot forget those terrible words nor the look upon his\r\nface.  I will not see him.  Go now.  You can do nothing for me.  Tell\r\nhim only one thing.  I want my child.  I have a right to my child.\r\nThat is the only message I can send him.\"  She turned her face to the\r\nwall and would say no more.\r\n\r\nI returned to the room downstairs, where Ferguson and Holmes still sat\r\nby the fire.  Ferguson listened moodily to my account of the interview.\r\n\r\n\"How can I send her the child?\" he said.  \"How do I know what strange\r\nimpulse might come upon her?  How can I ever forget how she rose from\r\nbeside it with its blood upon her lips?\"  He shuddered at the\r\nrecollection.  \"The child is safe with Mrs. Mason, and there he must\r\nremain.\"\r\n\r\nA smart maid, the only modern thing which we had seen in the house, had\r\nbrought in some tea.  As she was serving it the door opened and a youth\r\nentered the room.  He was a remarkable lad, pale-faced and fair-haired,\r\nwith excitable light blue eyes which blazed into a sudden flame of\r\nemotion and joy as they rested upon his father.  He rushed forward and\r\nthrew his arms round his neck with the abandon of a loving girl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, daddy,\" he cried, \"I did not know that you were due yet.  I should\r\nhave been here to meet you.  Oh, I am so glad to see you!\"\r\n\r\nFerguson gently disengaged himself from the embrace with some little\r\nshow of embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"Dear old chap,\" said he, patting the flaxen head with a very tender\r\nhand.  \"I came early because my friends, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson,\r\nhave been persuaded to come down and spend an evening with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that Mr. Holmes, the detective?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThe youth looked at us with a very penetrating and, as it seemed to me,\r\nunfriendly gaze.\r\n\r\n\"What about your other child, Mr. Ferguson?\" asked Holmes.  \"Might we\r\nmake the acquaintance of the baby?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask Mrs. Mason to bring baby down,\" said Ferguson.  The boy went off\r\nwith a curious, shambling gait which told my surgical eyes that he was\r\nsuffering from a weak spine.  Presently he returned, and behind him\r\ncame a tall, gaunt woman bearing in her arms a very beautiful child,\r\ndark-eyed, golden-haired, a wonderful mixture of the Saxon and the\r\nLatin.  Ferguson was evidently devoted to it, for he took it into his\r\narms and fondled it most tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"Fancy anyone having the heart to hurt him,\" he muttered, as he glanced\r\ndown at the small, angry red pucker upon the cherub throat.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Holmes, and saw a\r\nmost singular intentness in his expression.  His face was as set as if\r\nit had been carved out of old ivory, and his eyes, which had glanced\r\nfor a moment at father and child, were now fixed with eager curiosity\r\nupon something at the other side of the room.  Following his gaze I\r\ncould only guess that he was looking out through the window at the\r\nmelancholy, dripping garden.  It is true that a shutter had half closed\r\noutside and obstructed the view, but none the less it was certainly at\r\nthe window that Holmes was fixing his concentrated attention.  Then he\r\nsmiled, and his eyes came back to the baby.  On its chubby neck there\r\nwas this small puckered mark.  Without speaking, Holmes examined it\r\nwith care.  Finally he shook one of the dimpled fists which waved in\r\nfront of him.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, little man.  You have made a strange start in life.  Nurse,\r\nI should wish to have a word with you in private.\"\r\n\r\nHe took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few minutes.  I only heard\r\nthe last words, which were: \"Your anxiety will soon, I hope, be set at\r\nrest.\"  The woman, who seemed to be a sour, silent kind of creature,\r\nwithdrew with the child.\r\n\r\n\"What is Mrs. Mason like?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Not very prepossessing externally, as you can see, but a heart of\r\ngold, and devoted to the child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you like her, Jack?\" Holmes turned suddenly upon the boy.  His\r\nexpressive mobile face shadowed over, and he shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Jacky has very strong likes and dislikes,\" said Ferguson, putting his\r\narm round the boy.  \"Luckily I am one of his likes.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy cooed and nestled his head upon his father's breast.  Ferguson\r\ngently disengaged him.\r\n\r\n\"Run away, little Jacky,\" said he, and he watched his son with loving\r\neyes until he disappeared.  \"Now, Mr. Holmes,\" he continued, when the\r\nboy was gone, \"I really feel that I have brought you on a fool's\r\nerrand, for what can you possibly do, save give me your sympathy?  It\r\nmust be an exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your point of\r\nview.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly delicate,\" said my friend, with an amused smile, \"but\r\nI have not been struck up to now with its complexity.  It has been a\r\ncase for intellectual deduction, but when this original intellectual\r\ndeduction is confirmed point by point by quite a number of independent\r\nincidents, then the subjective becomes objective and we can say\r\nconfidently that we have reached our goal.  I had, in fact, reached it\r\nbefore we left Baker Street, and the rest has merely been observation\r\nand confirmation.\"\r\n\r\nFerguson put his big hand to his furrowed forehead.\r\n\r\n\"For Heaven's sake, Holmes,\" he said hoarsely, \"if you can see the\r\ntruth in this matter, do not keep me in suspense.  How do I stand?\r\nWhat shall I do?  I care nothing as to how you have found your facts so\r\nlong as you have really got them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I owe you an explanation, and you shall have it.  But you\r\nwill permit me to handle the matter in my own way?  Is the lady capable\r\nof seeing us, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is ill, but she is quite rational.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good.  It is only in her presence that we can clear the matter\r\nup.  Let us go up to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"She will not see me,\" cried Ferguson.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, she will,\" said Holmes.  He scribbled a few lines upon a\r\nsheet of paper.  \"You at least have the _entrée_, Watson.  Will you\r\nhave the goodness to give the lady this note?\"\r\n\r\nI ascended again and handed the note to Dolores, who cautiously opened\r\nthe door.  A minute later I heard a cry from within, a cry in which joy\r\nand surprise seemed to be blended.  Dolores looked out.\r\n\r\n\"She will see them.  She will leesten,\" said she.\r\n\r\nAt my summons Ferguson and Holmes came up.  As we entered the room\r\nFerguson took a step or two towards his wife, who had raised herself in\r\nthe bed, but she held out her hand to repulse him.  He sank into an\r\narm-chair, while Holmes seated himself beside him, after bowing to the\r\nlady, who looked at him with wide-eyed amazement.\r\n\r\n\"I think we can dispense with Dolores,\" said Holmes.  \"Oh, very well,\r\nmadame, if you would rather she stayed I can see no objection.  Now,\r\nMr. Ferguson, I am a busy man with many calls, and my methods have to\r\nbe short and direct.  The swiftest surgery is the least painful.  Let\r\nme first say what will ease your mind.  Your wife is a very good, a\r\nvery loving, and a very ill-used woman.\"\r\n\r\nFerguson sat up with a cry of joy.\r\n\r\n\"Prove that, Mr. Holmes, and I am your debtor for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do so, but in doing so I must wound you deeply in another\r\ndirection.\"\r\n\r\n\"I care nothing so long as you clear my wife.  Everything on earth is\r\ninsignificant compared to that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you, then, the train of reasoning which passed through my\r\nmind in Baker Street.  The idea of a vampire was to me absurd.  Such\r\nthings do not happen in criminal practice in England.  And yet your\r\nobservation was precise.  You had seen the lady rise from beside the\r\nchild's cot with the blood upon her lips.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did it not occur to you that a bleeding wound may be sucked for some\r\nother purpose than to draw the blood from it?  Was there not a Queen in\r\nEnglish history who sucked such a wound to draw poison from it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poison!\"\r\n\r\n\"A South American household.  My instinct felt the presence of those\r\nweapons upon the wall before my eyes ever saw them.  It might have been\r\nother poison, but that was what occurred to me.  When I saw that little\r\nempty quiver beside the small bird-bow, it was just what I expected to\r\nsee.  If the child were pricked with one of those arrows dipped in\r\ncurare or some other devilish drug, it would mean death if the venom\r\nwere not sucked out.\r\n\r\n\"And the dog!  If one were to use such a poison, would one not try it\r\nfirst in order to see that it had not lost its power?  I did not\r\nforesee the dog, but at least I understood him and he fitted into my\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\n\"Now do you understand?  Your wife feared such an attack.  She saw it\r\nmade and saved the child's life, and yet she shrank from telling you\r\nall the truth, for she knew how you loved the boy and feared lest it\r\nbreak your heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jacky!\"\r\n\r\n\"I watched him as you fondled the child just now.  His face was clearly\r\nreflected in the glass of the window where the shutter formed a\r\nbackground.  I saw such jealousy, such cruel hatred, as I have seldom\r\nseen in a human face.\"\r\n\r\n\"My Jacky!\"\r\n\r\n\"You have to face it, Mr. Ferguson.  It is the more painful because it\r\nis a distorted love, a maniacal exaggerated love for you, and possibly\r\nfor his dead mother, which has prompted his action.  His very soul is\r\nconsumed with hatred for this splendid child, whose health and beauty\r\nare a contrast to his own weakness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God!  It is incredible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I spoken the truth, madame?\"\r\n\r\nThe lady was sobbing, with her face buried in the pillows.  Now she\r\nturned to her husband.\r\n\r\n\"How could I tell you, Bob?  I felt the blow it would be to you.  It\r\nwas better that I should wait and that it should come from some other\r\nlips than mine.  When this gentleman, who seems to have powers of\r\nmagic, wrote that he knew all, I was glad.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think a year at sea would be my prescription for Master Jacky,\" said\r\nHolmes, rising from his chair.  \"Only one thing is still clouded,\r\nmadame.  We can quite understand your attacks upon Master Jacky.  There\r\nis a limit to a mother's patience.  But how did you dare to leave the\r\nchild these last two days?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had told Mrs. Mason.  She knew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  So I imagined.\"\r\n\r\nFerguson was standing by the bed, choking, his hands outstretched and\r\nquivering.\r\n\r\n\"This, I fancy, is the time for our exit, Watson,\" said Holmes in a\r\nwhisper.  \"If you will take one elbow of the too faithful Dolores, I\r\nwill take the other.  There, now,\" he added, as he closed the door\r\nbehind him, \"I think we may leave them to settle the rest among\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI have only one further note of this case.  It is the letter which\r\nHolmes wrote in final answer to that with which the narrative begins.\r\nIt ran thus:\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKER STREET,\r\n    _Nov._ 21st.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Vampires.\r\n\r\nSIR,--\r\n\r\nReferring to your letter of the 19th, I beg to state that I have looked\r\ninto the inquiry of your client, Mr. Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson and\r\nMuirhead, tea brokers, of Mincing Lane, and that the matter has been\r\nbrought to a satisfactory conclusion.  With thanks for your\r\nrecommendation,\r\n\r\nI am, Sir,\r\n    Faithfully yours,\r\n        SHERLOCK HOLMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE GARRIDEBS\r\n\r\nIt may have been a comedy, or it may have been a tragedy.  It cost one\r\nman his reason, it cost me a blood-letting, and it cost yet another man\r\nthe penalties of the law.  Yet there was certainly an element of\r\ncomedy.  Well, you shall judge for yourselves.\r\n\r\nI remember the date very well, for it was in the same month that Holmes\r\nrefused a knighthood for services which may perhaps some day be\r\ndescribed.  I only refer to the matter in passing, for in my position\r\nof partner and confidant I am obliged to be particularly careful to\r\navoid any indiscretion.  I repeat, however, that this enables me to fix\r\nthe date, which was the latter end of June, 1902, shortly after the\r\nconclusion of the South African War.  Holmes had spent several days in\r\nbed, as was his habit from time to time, but he emerged that morning\r\nwith a long foolscap document in his hand and a twinkle of amusement in\r\nhis austere grey eyes.\r\n\r\n\"There is a chance for you to make some money, friend Watson,\" said he.\r\n\"Have you ever heard the name of Garrideb?\"\r\n\r\nI admitted that I had not.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you can lay your hand upon a Garrideb, there's money in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's a long story--rather a whimsical one, too.  I don't think\r\nin all our explorations of human complexities we have ever come upon\r\nanything more singular.  The fellow will be here presently for\r\ncross-examination, so I won't open the matter up till he comes.  But\r\nmeanwhile, that's the name we want.\"\r\n\r\nThe telephone directory lay on the table beside me, and I turned over\r\nthe pages in a rather hopeless quest.  But to my amazement there was\r\nthis strange name in its due place.  I gave a cry of triumph.\r\n\r\n\"Here you are, Holmes!  Here it is!\"\r\n\r\nHolmes took the book from my hand.\r\n\r\n\"'Garrideb, N.,'\" he read, \"'136 Little Ryder Street, W.'  Sorry to\r\ndisappoint you, my dear Watson, but this is the man himself.  That is\r\nthe address upon his letter.  We want another to match him.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hudson had come in with a card upon a tray.  I took it up and\r\nglanced at it.\r\n\r\n\"Why, here it is!\" I cried in amazement.  \"This is a different initial.\r\nJohn Garrideb, Counsellor at Law, Moorville, Kansas, U.S.A.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes smiled as he looked at the card.  \"I am afraid you must make yet\r\nanother effort, Watson,\" said he.  \"This gentleman is also in the plot\r\nalready, though I certainly did not expect to see him this morning.\r\nHowever, he is in a position to tell us a good deal which I want to\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nA moment later he was in the room.  Mr. John Garrideb, Counsellor at\r\nLaw, was a short, powerful man with the round, fresh, clean-shaven face\r\ncharacteristic of so many American men of affairs.  The general effect\r\nwas chubby and rather childlike, so that one received the impression of\r\nquite a young man with a broad set smile upon his face.  His eyes,\r\nhowever, were arresting.  Seldom in any human head have I seen a pair\r\nwhich bespoke a more intense inward life, so bright were they, so\r\nalert, so responsive to every change of thought.  His accent was\r\nAmerican, but was not accompanied by any eccentricity of speech.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes?\" he asked, glancing from one to the other.  \"Ah, yes!\r\nYour pictures are not unlike you, sir, if I may say so.  I believe you\r\nhave had a letter from my namesake, Mr. Nathan Garrideb, have you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray sit down,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"We shall, I fancy, have a good\r\ndeal to discuss.\"  He took up his sheets of foolscap.  \"You are, of\r\ncourse, the Mr. John Garrideb mentioned in this document.  But surely\r\nyou have been in England some time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say that, Mr. Holmes?\" I seemed to read sudden suspicion in\r\nthose expressive eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Your whole outfit is English.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Garrideb forced a laugh.  \"I've read of your tricks, Mr. Holmes,\r\nbut I never thought I would be the subject of them.  Where do you read\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"The shoulder cut of your coat, the toes of your boots--could anyone\r\ndoubt it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, I had no idea I was so obvious a Britisher.  But business\r\nbrought me over here some time ago, and so, as you say, my outfit is\r\nnearly all London.  However, I guess your time is of value, and we did\r\nnot meet to talk about the cut of my socks.  What about getting down to\r\nthat paper you hold in your hand?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes had in some way ruffled our visitor, whose chubby face had\r\nassumed a far less amiable expression.\r\n\r\n\"Patience!  Patience, Mr. Garrideb!\" said my friend in a soothing\r\nvoice.  \"Dr. Watson would tell you that these little digressions of\r\nmine sometimes prove in the end to have some bearing on the matter.\r\nBut why did Mr. Nathan Garrideb not come with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did he ever drag you into it at all?\" asked our visitor, with a\r\nsudden outflame of anger.  \"What in thunder had you to do with it?\r\nHere was a bit of professional business between two gentlemen, and one\r\nof them must needs call in a detective!  I saw him this morning, and he\r\ntold me this fool-trick he had played me, and that's why I am here.\r\nBut I feel bad about it, all the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no reflection upon you, Mr. Garrideb.  It was simply zeal\r\nupon his part to gain your end--an end which is, I understand, equally\r\nvital for both of you.  He knew that I had means of getting\r\ninformation, and, therefore, it was very natural that he should apply\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\nOur visitor's angry face gradually cleared.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that puts it different,\" said he.  \"When I went to see him this\r\nmorning and he told me he had sent to a detective, I just asked for\r\nyour address and came right away.  I don't want police butting into a\r\nprivate matter.  But if you are content just to help us find the man,\r\nthere can be no harm in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is just how it stands,\" said Holmes.  \"And now, sir, since\r\nyou are here, we had best have a clear account from your own lips.  My\r\nfriend here knows nothing of the details.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Garrideb surveyed me with not too friendly a gaze.\r\n\r\n\"Need he know?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"We usually work together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's no reason it should be kept a secret.  I'll give you the\r\nfacts as short as I can make them.  If you came from Kansas I would not\r\nneed to explain to you who Alexander Hamilton Garrideb was.  He made\r\nhis money in real estate, and afterwards in the wheat pit at Chicago,\r\nbut he spent it in buying up as much land as would make one of your\r\ncounties, lying along the Arkansas River, west of Fort Dodge.  It's\r\ngrazing-land and lumber-land and arable-land and mineralized-land, and\r\njust every sort of land that brings dollars to the man that owns it.\r\n\r\n\"He had no kith nor kin--or, if he had, I never heard of it.  But he\r\ntook a kind of pride in the queerness of his name.  That was what\r\nbrought us together.  I was in the law at Topeka, and one day I had a\r\nvisit from the old man, and he was tickled to death to meet another man\r\nwith his own name.  It was his pet fad, and he was dead set to find out\r\nif there were any more Garridebs in the world.  'Find me another!' said\r\nhe.  I told him I was a busy man and could not spend my life hiking\r\nround the world in search of Garridebs.  'None the less,' said he,\r\n'that is just what you will do if things pan out as I planned them.'  I\r\nthought he was joking, but there was a powerful lot of meaning in the\r\nwords, as I was soon to discover.\r\n\r\n\"For he died within a year of saying them, and he left a will behind\r\nhim.  It was the queerest will that has ever been filed in the State of\r\nKansas.  His property was divided into three parts, and I was to have\r\none on condition that I found two Garridebs who would share the\r\nremainder.  It's five million dollars for each if it is a cent, but we\r\ncan't lay a finger on it until we all three stand in a row.\r\n\r\n\"It was so big a chance that I just let my legal practice slide and I\r\nset forth looking for Garridebs.  There is not one in the United\r\nStates.  I went through it, sir, with a fine-toothed comb and never a\r\nGarrideb could I catch.  Then I tried the old country.  Sure enough\r\nthere was the name in the London Telephone Directory.  I went after him\r\ntwo days ago and explained the whole matter to him.  But he is a lone\r\nman, like myself, with some women relations, but no men.  It says three\r\nadult men in the will.  So you see we still have a vacancy, and if you\r\ncan help to fill it we will be very ready to pay your charges.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Watson,\" said Holmes, with a smile, \"I said it was rather\r\nwhimsical, did I not?  I should have thought, sir, that your obvious\r\nway was to advertise in the agony columns of the papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have done that, Mr. Holmes.  No replies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!  Well, it is certainly a most curious little problem.  I may\r\ntake a glance at it in my leisure.  By the way, it is curious that you\r\nshould have come from Topeka.  I used to have a correspondent--he is\r\ndead now--old Dr. Lysander Starr, who was Mayor in 1890.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good old Dr. Starr!\" said our visitor.  \"His name is still honoured.\r\nWell, Mr. Holmes, I suppose all we can do is to report to you and let\r\nyou know how we progress.  I reckon you will hear within a day or two.\"\r\nWith this assurance our American bowed and departed.\r\n\r\nHolmes had lit his pipe, and he sat for some time with a curious smile\r\nupon his face.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" I asked at last.\r\n\r\n\"I am wondering, Watson--just wondering!\"\r\n\r\n\"At what?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes took his pipe from his lips.\r\n\r\n\"I was wondering, Watson, what on earth could be the object of this man\r\nin telling us such a rigmarole of lies.  I nearly asked him so--for\r\nthere are times when a brutal frontal attack is the best policy--but I\r\njudged it better to let him think he had fooled us.  Here is a man with\r\nan English coat frayed at the elbow and trousers bagged at the knee\r\nwith a year's wear, and yet by this document and by his own account he\r\nis a provincial American lately landed in London.  There have been no\r\nadvertisements in the agony columns.  You know that I miss nothing\r\nthere.  They are my favourite covert for putting up a bird, and I would\r\nnever have overlooked such a cock pheasant as that.  I never knew a Dr.\r\nLysander Starr of Topeka.  Touch him where you would he was false.  I\r\nthink the fellow is really an American, but he has worn his accent\r\nsmooth with years of London.  What is his game, then, and what motive\r\nlies behind this preposterous search for Garridebs?  It's worth our\r\nattention, for, granting that the man is a rascal, he is certainly a\r\ncomplex and ingenious one.  We must now find out if our other\r\ncorrespondent is a fraud also.  Just ring him up, Watson.\"\r\n\r\nI did so, and heard a thin, quavering voice at the other end of the\r\nline.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I am Mr. Nathan Garrideb.  Is Mr. Holmes there?  I should\r\nvery much like to have a word with Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend took the instrument and I heard the usual syncopated dialogue.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he has been here.  I understand that you don't know him....  How\r\nlong? ... Only two days! ... Yes, yes, of course, it is a most\r\ncaptivating prospect.  Will you be at home this evening?  I suppose\r\nyour namesake will not be there?  ... Very good, we will come then, for\r\nI would rather have a chat without him....  Dr. Watson will come with\r\nme....  I understood from your note that you did not go out often....\r\nWell, we shall be round about six.  You need not mention it to the\r\nAmerican lawyer....  Very good.  Good-bye!\"\r\n\r\nIt was twilight of a lovely spring evening, and even Little Ryder\r\nStreet, one of the smaller offshoots from the Edgware Road, within a\r\nstone-cast of old Tyburn Tree of evil memory, looked golden and\r\nwonderful in the slanting rays of the setting sun.  The particular\r\nhouse to which we were directed was a large, old-fashioned, Early\r\nGeorgian edifice with a flat brick face broken only by two deep bay\r\nwindows on the ground floor.  It was on this ground floor that our\r\nclient lived, and, indeed, the low windows proved to be the front of\r\nthe huge room in which he spent his waking hours.  Holmes pointed as we\r\npassed to the small brass plate which bore the curious name.\r\n\r\n\"Up some years, Watson,\" he remarked, indicating its discoloured\r\nsurface.  \"It's his real name, anyhow, and that is something to note.\"\r\n\r\nThe house had a common stair, and there were a number of names painted\r\nin the hall some indicating offices and some private chambers.  It was\r\nnot a collection of residential flats, but rather the abode of Bohemian\r\nbachelors.  Our client opened the door for us himself and apologized by\r\nsaying that the woman in charge left at four o'clock.  Mr. Nathan\r\nGarrideb proved to be a very tall, loose-jointed, round-backed person,\r\ngaunt and bald, some sixty-odd years of age.  He had a cadaverous face,\r\nwith the dull dead skin of a man to whom exercise was unknown.  Large\r\nround spectacles and a small projecting goat's beard combined with his\r\nstooping attitude to give him an expression of peering curiosity.  The\r\ngeneral effect, however, was amiable, though eccentric.\r\n\r\nThe room was as curious as its occupant.  It looked like a small\r\nmuseum.  It was both broad and deep, with cupboards and cabinets all\r\nround, crowded with specimens, geological and anatomical.  Cases of\r\nbutterflies and moths flanked each side of the entrance.  A large table\r\nin the centre was littered with all sorts of debris, while the tall\r\nbrass tube of a powerful microscope bristled up amongst them.  As I\r\nglanced round I was surprised at the universality of the man's\r\ninterests.  Here was a case of ancient coins.  There was a cabinet of\r\nflint instruments.  Behind his central table was a large cupboard of\r\nfossil bones.  Above was a line of plaster skulls with such names as\r\n\"Neanderthal,\" \"Heidelberg,\" \"Cromagnon\" printed beneath them.  It was\r\nclear that he was a student of many subjects.  As he stood in front of\r\nus now, he held a piece of chamois leather in his right hand with which\r\nhe was polishing a coin.\r\n\r\n\"Syracusan--of the best period,\" he explained, holding it up.  \"They\r\ndegenerated greatly towards the end.  At their best I hold them\r\nsupreme, though some prefer the Alexandrian school.  You will find a\r\nchair here, Mr. Holmes.  Pray allow me to clear these bones.  And you,\r\nsir--ah, yes, Dr. Watson--if you would have the goodness to put the\r\nJapanese vase to one side.  You see round me my little interests in\r\nlife.  My doctor lectures me about never going out, but why should I go\r\nout when I have so much to hold me here?  I can assure you that the\r\nadequate cataloguing of one of those cabinets would take me three good\r\nmonths.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes looked round him with curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"But do you tell me that you _never_ go out?\" he said\r\n\r\n\"Now and again I drive down to Sotheby's or Christie's.  Otherwise I\r\nvery seldom leave my room.  I am not too strong, and my researches are\r\nvery absorbing.  But you can imagine, Mr. Holmes, what a terrific\r\nshock--pleasant but terrific--it was for me when I heard of this\r\nunparalleled good fortune.  It only needs one more Garrideb to complete\r\nthe matter, and surely we can find one.  I had a brother, but he is\r\ndead, and female relatives are disqualified.  But there must surely be\r\nothers in the world.  I had heard that you handled strange cases, and\r\nthat was why I sent to you.  Of course, this American gentleman is\r\nquite right, and I should have taken his advice first, but I acted for\r\nthe best.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you acted very wisely indeed,\" said Holmes.  \"But are you\r\nreally anxious to acquire an estate in America?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, sir.  Nothing would induce me to leave my collection.\r\nBut this gentleman has assured me that he will buy me out as soon as we\r\nhave established our claim.  Five million dollars was the sum named.\r\nThere are a dozen specimens in the market at the present moment which\r\nfill gaps in my collection, and which I am unable to purchase for want\r\nof a few hundred pounds.  Just think what I could do with five million\r\ndollars.  Why, I have the nucleus of a national collection.  I shall be\r\nthe Hans Sloane of my age.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes gleamed behind his great spectacles.  It was very clear that\r\nno pains would be spared by Mr. Nathan Garrideb in finding a namesake.\r\n\r\n\"I merely called to make your acquaintance, and there is no reason why\r\nI should interrupt your studies,\" said Holmes.  \"I prefer to establish\r\npersonal touch with those with whom I do business.  There are few\r\nquestions I need ask, for I have your very clear narrative in my\r\npocket, and I filled up the blanks when this American gentleman called.\r\nI understand that up to this week you were unaware of his existence.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so.  He called last Tuesday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he tell you of our interview to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he came straight back to me.  He had been very angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should he be angry?\"\r\n\r\n\"He seemed to think it was some reflection on his honour.  But he was\r\nquite cheerful again when he returned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he suggest any course of action?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, he did not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has he had, or asked for, any money from you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, never!\"\r\n\r\n\"You see no possible object he has in view?\"\r\n\r\n\"None, except what he states.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you tell him of our telephone appointment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I did.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes was lost in thought.  I could see that he was puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Have you any articles of great value in your collection?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.  I am not a rich man.  It is a good collection, but not a\r\nvery valuable one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have no fear of burglars?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the least.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been in these rooms?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nearly five years.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes's cross-examination was interrupted by an imperative knocking at\r\nthe door.  No sooner had our client unlatched it than the American\r\nlawyer burst excitedly into the room.\r\n\r\n\"Here you are!\" he cried, waving a paper over his head.  \"I thought I\r\nshould be in time to get you.  Mr. Nathan Garrideb, my congratulations!\r\nYou are a rich man, sir.  Our business is happily finished and all is\r\nwell.  As to you, Mr. Holmes, we can only say we are sorry if we have\r\ngiven you any useless trouble.\"\r\n\r\nHe handed over the paper to our client, who stood staring at a marked\r\nadvertisement.  Holmes and I leaned forward and read it over his\r\nshoulder.  This is how it ran:\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  | HOWARD GARRIDEB.                                    |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  | Constructor of Agricultural Machinery.              |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  | Binders, reapers' steam and hand plows, drills,     |\r\n  | harrows, farmers' carts, buckboards, and all other  |\r\n  | appliances.                                         |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  | Estimates for Artesian Wells.                       |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  | Apply Grosvenor Buildings, Aston.                   |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Glorious!\" gasped our host.  \"That makes our third man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had opened up inquiries in Birmingham,\" said the American, \"and my\r\nagent there has sent me this advertisement from a local paper.  We must\r\nhustle and put the thing through.  I have written to this man and told\r\nhim that you will see him in his office to-morrow afternoon at four\r\no'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want _me_ to see him?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, Mr. Holmes?  Don't you think it would be wiser?  Here\r\nam I, a wandering American with a wonderful tale.  Why should he\r\nbelieve what I tell him?  But you are a Britisher with solid\r\nreferences, and he is bound to take notice of what you say.  I would go\r\nwith you if you wished, but I have a very busy day to-morrow, and I\r\ncould always follow you if you are in any trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have not made such a journey for years.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing, Mr. Garrideb.  I have figured out your connections.\r\nYou leave at twelve and should be there soon after two.  Then you can\r\nbe back the same night.  All you have to do is to see this man, explain\r\nthe matter, and get an affidavit of his existence.  By the Lord!\" he\r\nadded hotly, \"considering I've come all the way from the centre of\r\nAmerica, it is surely little enough if you go a hundred miles in order\r\nto put this matter through.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" said Holmes.  \"I think what this gentleman says is very\r\ntrue.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Nathan Garrideb shrugged his shoulders with a disconsolate air.\r\n\"Well, if you insist I shall go,\" said he.  \"It is certainly hard for\r\nme to refuse you anything, considering the glory of hope that you have\r\nbrought into my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that is agreed,\" said Holmes, \"and no doubt you will let me have\r\na report as soon as you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see to that,\" said the American.  \"Well,\" he added, looking at\r\nhis watch, \"I'll have to get on.  I'll call to-morrow, Mr. Nathan, and\r\nsee you off to Birmingham.  Coming my way, Mr. Holmes?  Well, then,\r\ngood-bye, and we may have good news for you to-morrow night.\"\r\n\r\nI noticed that my friend's face cleared when the American left the\r\nroom, and the look of thoughtful perplexity had vanished.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could look over your collection, Mr. Garrideb,\" said he.  \"In\r\nmy profession all sorts of odd knowledge comes useful, and this room of\r\nyours is a storehouse of it.\"\r\n\r\nOur client shone with pleasure and his eyes gleamed from behind his big\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\n\"I had always heard, sir, that you were a very intelligent man,\" said\r\nhe.  \"I could take you round now, if you have the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, I have not.  But these specimens are so well labelled\r\nand classified that they hardly need your personal explanation.  If I\r\nshould be able to look in to-morrow, I presume that there would be no\r\nobjection to my glancing over them?\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all.  You are most welcome.  The place will, of course, be\r\nshut up, but Mrs. Saunders is in the basement up to four o'clock and\r\nwould let you in with her key.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I happen to be clear to-morrow afternoon.  If you would say a\r\nword to Mrs. Saunders it would be quite in order.  By the way, who is\r\nyour house-agent?\"\r\n\r\nOur client was amazed at the sudden question.\r\n\r\n\"Holloway and Steele, in the Edgware Road.  But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a bit of an archæologist myself when it comes to houses,\" said\r\nHolmes, laughing.  \"I was wondering if this was Queen Anne or Georgian.\"\r\n\r\n\"Georgian, beyond doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really.  I should have thought a little earlier.  However, it is\r\neasily ascertained.  Well, good-bye, Mr. Garrideb, and may you have\r\nevery success in your Birmingham journey.\"\r\n\r\nThe house-agent's was close by, but we found that it was closed for the\r\nday, so we made our way back to Baker Street.  It was not till after\r\ndinner that Holmes reverted to the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Our little problem draws to a close,\" said he.  \"No doubt you have\r\noutlined the solution in your own mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can make neither head nor tail of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The head is surely clear enough and the tail we should see to-morrow.\r\nDid you notice nothing curious about that advertisement?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw that the word 'plough' was misspelt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you did notice that, did you?  Come, Watson, you improve all the\r\ntime.  Yes, it was bad English but good American.  The printer had set\r\nit up as received.  Then the buckboards.  That is American also.  And\r\nartesian wells are commoner with them than with us.  It was a typical\r\nAmerican advertisement, but purporting to be from an English firm.\r\nWhat do you make of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can only suppose that this American lawyer put it in himself.  What\r\nhis object was I fail to understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there are alternative explanations.  Anyhow, he wanted to get\r\nthis good old fossil up to Birmingham.  That is very clear.  I might\r\nhave told him that he was clearly going on a wild-goose chase, but, on\r\nsecond thoughts, it seemed better to clear the stage by letting him go.\r\nTo-morrow, Watson--well, to-morrow will speak for itself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHolmes was up and out early.  When he returned at lunch-time I noticed\r\nthat his face was very grave.\r\n\r\n\"This is a more serious matter than I had expected, Watson,\" said he.\r\n\"It is fair to tell you so, though I know it will only be an additional\r\nreason to you for running your head into danger.  I should know my\r\nWatson by now.  But there is danger, and you should know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is not the first we have shared, Holmes.  I hope it may not\r\nbe the last.  What is the particular danger this time?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are up against a very hard case.  I have identified Mr. John\r\nGarrideb, Counsellor at Law.  He is none other than 'Killer' Evans, of\r\nsinister and murderous reputation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear I am none the wiser.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, it is not part of your profession to carry about a portable\r\nNewgate Calendar in your memory.  I have been down to see friend\r\nLestrade at the Yard.  There may be an occasional want of imaginative\r\nintuition down there, but they lead the world for thoroughness and\r\nmethod.  I had an idea that we might get on the track of our American\r\nfriend in their records.  Sure enough, I found his chubby face smiling\r\nup at me from the Rogues' Portrait Gallery.  James Winter, _alias_\r\nMorecroft, _alias_ Killer Evans, was the inscription below.\"  Holmes\r\ndrew an envelope from his pocket.  \"I scribbled down a few points from\r\nhis dossier.  Aged forty-four.  Native of Chicago.  Known to have shot\r\nthree men in the States.  Escaped from penitentiary through political\r\ninfluence.  Came to London in 1893.  Shot a man over cards in a night\r\nclub in the Waterloo Road in January, 1895.  Man died, but he was shown\r\nto have been the aggressor in the row.  Dead man was identified as\r\nRodger Prescott, famous as forger and coiner in Chicago.  Killer Evans\r\nreleased in 1901.  Has been under police supervision since, but so far\r\nas known has led an honest life.  Very dangerous man, usually carries\r\narms and is prepared to use them.  That is our bird, Watson--a sporting\r\nbird, as you must admit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is his game?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it begins to define itself.  I have been to the house-agents.\r\nOur client, as he told us, has been there five years.  It was unlet for\r\na year before then.  The previous tenant was a gentleman at large named\r\nWaldron.  Waldron's appearance was well remembered at the office.  He\r\nhad suddenly vanished and nothing more been heard of him.  He was a\r\ntall, bearded man with very dark features.  Now, Prescott, the man whom\r\nKiller Evans had shot, was, according to Scotland Yard, a tall, dark\r\nman with a beard.  As a working hypothesis, I think we may take it that\r\nPrescott, the American criminal, used to live in the very room which\r\nour innocent friend now devotes to his museum.  So at last we get a\r\nlink, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the next link?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we must go now and look for that.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a revolver from the drawer and handed it to me.\r\n\r\n\"I have my old favourite with me.  If our Wild West friend tries to\r\nlive up to his nickname, we must be ready for him.  I'll give you an\r\nhour for a siesta, Watson, and then I think it will be time for our\r\nRyder Street adventure.\"\r\n\r\nIt was just four o'clock when we reached the curious apartment of\r\nNathan Garrideb.  Mrs. Saunders, the caretaker, was about to leave, but\r\nshe had no hesitation in admitting us, for the door shut with a spring\r\nlock and Holmes promised to see that all was safe before we left.\r\nShortly afterwards the outer door closed, her bonnet passed the bow\r\nwindow, and we knew that we were alone in the lower floor of the house.\r\nHolmes made a rapid examination of the premises.  There was one\r\ncupboard in a dark corner which stood out a little from the wall.  It\r\nwas behind this that we eventually crouched, while Holmes in a whisper\r\noutlined his intentions.\r\n\r\n\"He wanted to get our amiable friend out of his room--that is very\r\nclear, and, as the collector never went out, it took some planning to\r\ndo it.  The whole of this Garrideb invention was apparently for no\r\nother end.  I must say, Watson, that there is a certain devilish\r\ningenuity about it, even if the queer name of the tenant did give him\r\nan opening which he could hardly have expected.  He wove his plot with\r\nremarkable cunning.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what did he want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is what we are here to find out.  It has nothing whatever\r\nto do with our client, so far as I can read the situation.  It is\r\nsomething connected with the man he murdered--the man who may have been\r\nhis confederate in crime.  There is some guilty secret in the room.\r\nThat is how I read it.  At first I thought our friend might have\r\nsomething in his collection more valuable than he knew--something worth\r\nthe attention of a big criminal.  But the fact that Rodger Prescott of\r\nevil memory inhabited these rooms points to some deeper reason.  Well,\r\nWatson, we can but possess our souls in patience and see what the hour\r\nmay bring.\"\r\n\r\nThat hour was not long in striking.  We crouched closer in the shadow\r\nas we heard the outer door open and shut.  Then came the sharp,\r\nmetallic snap of a key, and the American was in the room.  He closed\r\nthe door softly behind him, took a sharp glance around him to see that\r\nall was safe, threw off his overcoat, and walked up to the central\r\ntable with the brisk manner of one who knows exactly what he has to do\r\nand how to do it.  He pushed the table to one side, tore up the square\r\nof carpet on which it rested, rolled it completely back, and then,\r\ndrawing a jemmy from his inside pocket, he knelt down and worked\r\nvigorously upon the floor.  Presently we heard the sound of sliding\r\nboards, and an instant later a square had opened in the planks.  Killer\r\nEvans struck a match, lit a stump of candle, and vanished from our view.\r\n\r\nClearly our moment had come.  Holmes touched my wrist as a signal, and\r\ntogether we stole across to the open trapdoor.  Gently as we moved,\r\nhowever, the old floor must have creaked under our feet, for the head\r\nof our American, peering anxiously round, emerged suddenly from the\r\nopen space.  His face turned upon us with a glare of baffled rage,\r\nwhich gradually softened into a rather shamefaced grin as he realized\r\nthat two pistols were pointed at his head.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" said he, coolly, as he scrambled to the surface.  \"I\r\nguess you have been one too many for me, Mr. Holmes.  Saw through my\r\ngame, I suppose, and played me for a sucker from the first.  Well, sir,\r\nI hand it to you; you have me beat and----\"\r\n\r\nIn an instant he had whisked out a revolver from his breast and had\r\nfired two shots.  I felt a sudden hot sear as if a red-hot iron had\r\nbeen pressed to my thigh.  There was a crash as Holmes's pistol came\r\ndown on the man's head.  I had a vision of him sprawling upon the floor\r\nwith blood running down his face while Holmes rummaged him for weapons.\r\nThen my friend's wiry arms were round me and he was leading me to a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\"You're not hurt, Watson?  For God's sake, say that you are not hurt!\"\r\n\r\nIt was worth a wound--it was worth many wounds--to know the depth of\r\nloyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask.  The clear, hard eyes\r\nwere dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking.  For the one\r\nand only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great\r\nbrain.  All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in\r\nthat moment of revelation.\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing, Holmes.  It's a mere scratch.\"\r\n\r\nHe had ripped up my trousers with his pocket-knife.\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" he cried, with an immense sigh of relief.  \"It is\r\nquite superficial.\"  His face set like flint as he glared at our\r\nprisoner, who was sitting up with a dazed face.  \"By the Lord, it is as\r\nwell for you.  If you had killed Watson, you would not have got out of\r\nthis room alive.  Now, sir, what have you to say for yourself?\"\r\n\r\nHe had nothing to say for himself.  He only lay and scowled.  I leaned\r\non Holmes's arm, and together we looked down into the small cellar\r\nwhich had been disclosed by the secret flap.  It was still illuminated\r\nby the candle which Evans had taken down with him.  Our eyes fell upon\r\na mass of rusted machinery, great rolls of paper, a litter of bottles,\r\nand, neatly arranged upon a small table, a number of neat little\r\nbundles.\r\n\r\n\"A printing press--a counterfeiter's outfit,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said our prisoner, staggering slowly to his feet and then\r\nsinking into the chair.  \"The greatest counterfeiter London ever saw.\r\nThat's Prescott's machine, and those bundles on the table are two\r\nthousand of Prescott's notes worth a hundred each and fit to pass\r\nanywhere.  Help yourselves, gentlemen.  Call it a deal and let me beat\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed.\r\n\r\n\"We don't do things like that, Mr. Evans.  There is no bolt-hole for\r\nyou in this country.  You shot this man Prescott, did you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, and got five years for it, though it was he who pulled on\r\nme.  Five years--when I should have had a medal the size of a soup\r\nplate.  No living man could tell a Prescott from a Bank of England, and\r\nif I hadn't put him out he would have flooded London with them.  I was\r\nthe only one in the world who knew where he made them.  Can you wonder\r\nthat I wanted to get to the place?  And can you wonder that when I\r\nfound this crazy boob of a bug-hunter with the queer name squatting\r\nright on the top of it, and never quitting his room, I had to do the\r\nbest I could to shift him?  Maybe I would have been wiser if I had put\r\nhim away.  It would have been easy enough, but I'm a soft-hearted guy\r\nthat can't begin shooting unless the other man has a gun also.  But\r\nsay, Mr. Holmes, what have I done wrong, anyhow?  I've not used this\r\nplant.  I've not hurt this old stiff.  Where do you get me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only attempted murder, so far as I can see,\" said Holmes.  \"But that's\r\nnot our job.  They take that at the next stage.  What we wanted at\r\npresent was just your sweet self.  Please give the Yard a call, Watson.\r\nIt won't be entirely unexpected.\"\r\n\r\nSo those were the facts about Killer Evans and his remarkable invention\r\nof the three Garridebs.  We heard later that our poor old friend never\r\ngot over the shock of his dissipated dreams.  When his castle in the\r\nair fell down, it buried him beneath the ruins.  He was last heard of\r\nat a nursing-home in Brixton.  It was a glad day at the Yard when the\r\nPrescott outfit was discovered, for, though they knew that it existed,\r\nthey had never been able, after the death of the man, to find out where\r\nit was.  Evans had indeed done great service and caused several worthy\r\nC.I.D. men to sleep the sounder, for the counterfeiter stands in a\r\nclass by himself as a public danger.  They would willingly have\r\nsubscribed to that soup-plate medal of which the criminal had spoken,\r\nbut an unappreciative Bench took a less favourable view, and the Killer\r\nreturned to those shades from which he had just emerged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF THOR BRIDGE\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the vaults of the bank of Cox and Co., at Charing Cross,\r\nthere is a travel-worn and battered tin dispatch-box with my name, John\r\nH. Watson, M.D., Late Indian Army, painted upon the lid.  It is crammed\r\nwith papers, nearly all of which are records of cases to illustrate the\r\ncurious problems which Mr. Sherlock Holmes had at various times to\r\nexamine.  Some, and not the least interesting, were complete failures,\r\nand as such will hardly bear narrating, since no final explanation is\r\nforthcoming.  A problem without a solution may interest the student,\r\nbut can hardly fail to annoy the casual reader.  Among these unfinished\r\ntales is that of Mr. James Phillimore, who, stepping back into his own\r\nhouse to get his umbrella, was never more seen in this world.  No less\r\nremarkable is that of the cutter _Alicia_, which sailed one spring\r\nmorning into a small patch of mist from where she never again emerged,\r\nnor was anything further ever heard of herself and her crew.  A third\r\ncase worthy of note is that of Isadora Persano, the well-known\r\njournalist and duellist, who was found stark staring mad with a\r\nmatchbox in front of him which contained a remarkable worm, said to be\r\nunknown to science.  Apart from these unfathomed cases, there are some\r\nwhich involve the secrets of private families to an extent which would\r\nmean consternation in many exalted quarters if it were thought possible\r\nthat they might find their way into print.  I need not say that such a\r\nbreach of confidence is unthinkable, and that these records will be\r\nseparated and destroyed now that my friend has time to turn his\r\nenergies to the matter.  There remain a considerable residue of cases\r\nof greater or less interest which I might have edited before had I not\r\nfeared to give the public a surfeit which might react upon the\r\nreputation of the man whom above all others I revere.  In some I was\r\nmyself concerned and can speak as an eye-witness, while in others I was\r\neither not present or played so small a part that they could only be\r\ntold as by a third person.  The following narrative is drawn from my\r\nown experience.\r\n\r\nIt was a wild morning in October, and I observed as I was dressing how\r\nthe last remaining leaves were being whirled from the solitary plane\r\ntree which graces the yard behind our house.  I descended to breakfast\r\nprepared to find my companion in depressed spirits, for, like all great\r\nartists, he was easily impressed by his surroundings.  On the contrary,\r\nI found that he had nearly finished his meal, and that his mood was\r\nparticularly bright and joyous, with that somewhat sinister\r\ncheerfulness which was characteristic of his lighter moments.\r\n\r\n\"You have a case, Holmes?\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"The faculty of deduction is certainly contagious, Watson,\" he\r\nanswered.  \"It has enabled you to probe my secret.  Yes, I have a case.\r\nAfter a month of trivialities and stagnation the wheels move once more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might I share it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is little to share, but we may discuss it when you have consumed\r\nthe two hard-boiled eggs with which our new cook has favoured us.\r\nTheir condition may not be unconnected with the copy of the _Family\r\nHerald_ which I observed yesterday upon the hall-table.  Even so\r\ntrivial a matter as cooking an egg demands an attention which is\r\nconscious of the passage of time, and incompatible with the love\r\nromance in that excellent periodical.\"\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later the table had been cleared and we were face\r\nto face.  He had drawn a letter from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"You have heard of Neil Gibson, the Gold King?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You mean the American Senator?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he was once Senator for some Western State, but is better known\r\nas the greatest gold-mining magnate in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know of him.  He has surely lived in England for some time.\r\nHis name is very familiar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he bought a considerable estate in Hampshire some five years ago.\r\nPossibly you have already heard of the tragic end of his wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.  I remember it now.  That is why the name is familiar.  But\r\nI really know nothing of the details.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes waved his hand towards some papers on a chair.  \"I had no idea\r\nthat the case was coming my way or I should have had my extracts\r\nready,\" said he.  \"The fact is that the problem, though exceedingly\r\nsensational, appeared to present no difficulty.  The interesting\r\npersonality of the accused does not obscure the clearness of the\r\nevidence.  That was the view taken by the coroner's jury and also in\r\nthe police-court proceedings.  It is now referred to the Assizes at\r\nWinchester.  I fear it is a thankless business.  I can discover facts,\r\nWatson, but I cannot change them.  Unless some entirely new and\r\nunexpected ones come to light I do not see what my client can hope for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your client?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I forgot I had not told you.  I am getting into your involved\r\nhabit, Watson, of telling a story backwards.  You had best read this\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter which he handed to me, written in a bold, masterful hand,\r\nran as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nCLARIDGE'S HOTEL, _October_ 3_rd_.\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--\r\n\r\nI can't see the best woman God ever made go to her death without doing\r\nall that is possible to save her.  I can't explain things--I can't even\r\ntry to explain them, but I know beyond all doubt that Miss Dunbar is\r\ninnocent.  You know the facts--who doesn't?  It has been the gossip of\r\nthe country.  And never a voice raised for her!  It's the damned\r\ninjustice of it all that makes me crazy.  That woman has a heart that\r\nwouldn't let her kill a fly.  Well, I'll come at eleven to-morrow and\r\nsee if you can get some ray of light in the dark.  Maybe I have a clue\r\nand don't know it.  Anyhow, all I know and all I have and all I am are\r\nfor your use if only you can save her.  If ever in your life you showed\r\nyour powers, put them now into this case.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n    J. NEIL GIBSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There you have it,\" said Sherlock Holmes, knocking out the ashes of\r\nhis after-breakfast pipe and slowly refilling it.  \"That is the\r\ngentleman I await.  As to the story, you have hardly time to master all\r\nthese papers, so I must give it to you in a nutshell if you are to take\r\nan intelligent interest in the proceedings.  This man is the greatest\r\nfinancial power in the world, and a man, as I understand, of most\r\nviolent and formidable character.  He married a wife, the victim of\r\nthis tragedy, of whom I know nothing save that she was past her prime,\r\nwhich was the more unfortunate as a very attractive governess\r\nsuperintended the education of two young children.  These are the three\r\npeople concerned, and the scene is a grand old manor-house, the centre\r\nof an historical English estate.  Then as to the tragedy.  The wife was\r\nfound in the grounds nearly half a mile from the house, late at night,\r\nclad in her dinner dress, with a shawl over her shoulders and a\r\nrevolver bullet through her brain.  No weapon was found near her and\r\nthere was no local clue as to the murder.  No weapon near her,\r\nWatson--mark that!  The crime seems to have been committed late in the\r\nevening, and the body was found by a gamekeeper about eleven o'clock,\r\nwhen it was examined by the police and by a doctor before being carried\r\nup to the house.  Is this too condensed, or can you follow it clearly?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is all very clear.  But why suspect the governess?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, in the first place there is some very direct evidence.  A\r\nrevolver with one discharged chamber and a calibre which corresponded\r\nwith the bullet was found on the floor of her wardrobe.\"  His eyes\r\nfixed and he repeated in broken words,\r\n\"On--the--floor--of--her--wardrobe.\"  Then he sank into silence, and I\r\nsaw that some train of thought had been set moving which I should be\r\nfoolish to interrupt.  Suddenly with a start he emerged into brisk life\r\nonce more.  \"Yes, Watson, it was found.  Pretty damning, eh?  So the\r\ntwo juries thought.  Then the dead woman had a note upon her making an\r\nappointment at that very place and signed by the governess.  How's\r\nthat?  Finally, there is the motive.  Senator Gibson is an attractive\r\nperson.  If his wife dies, who more likely to succeed her than the\r\nyoung lady who had already by all accounts received pressing attentions\r\nfrom her employer.  Love, fortune, power, all depending upon one\r\nmiddle-aged life.  Ugly, Watson--very ugly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed, Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor could she prove an alibi.  On the contrary, she had to admit that\r\nshe was down near Thor Bridge--that was the scene of the tragedy--about\r\nthat hour.  She couldn't deny it, for some passing villager had seen\r\nher there.\"\r\n\r\n\"That really seems final.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, Watson--and yet!  This bridge--a single broad span of stone\r\nwith balustraded sides--carries the drive over the narrowest part of a\r\nlong, deep, reed-girt sheet of water.  Thor Mere it is called.  In the\r\nmouth of the bridge lay the dead woman.  Such are the main facts.  But\r\nhere, if I mistake not, is our client, considerably before his time.\"\r\n\r\nBilly had opened the door, but the name which he announced was an\r\nunexpected one.  Mr. Marlow Bates was a stranger to both of us.  He was\r\na thin, nervous wisp of a man with frightened eyes, and a twitching,\r\nhesitating manner--a man whom my own professional eye would judge to be\r\non the brink of an absolute nervous breakdown.\r\n\r\n\"You seem agitated, Mr. Bates,\" said Holmes.  \"Pray sit down.  I fear I\r\ncan only give you a short time, for I have an appointment at eleven.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you have,\" our visitor gasped, shooting out short sentences\r\nlike a man who is out of breath.  \"Mr. Gibson is coming.  Mr. Gibson is\r\nmy employer.  I am manager of his estate.  Mr. Holmes, he is a\r\nvillain--an infernal villain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strong language, Mr. Bates.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have to be emphatic, Mr. Holmes, for the time is so limited.  I\r\nwould not have him find me here for the world.  He is almost due now.\r\nBut I was so situated that I could not come earlier.  His secretary,\r\nMr. Ferguson, only told me this morning of his appointment with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are his manager?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have given him notice.  In a couple of weeks I shall have shaken off\r\nhis accursed slavery.  A hard man, Mr. Holmes, hard to all about him.\r\nThose public charities are a screen to cover his private iniquities.\r\nBut his wife was his chief victim.  He was brutal to her--yes, sir,\r\nbrutal!  How she came by her death I do not know, but I am sure that he\r\nhad made her life a misery to her.  She was a creature of the Tropics,\r\na Brazilian by birth, as no doubt you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it had escaped me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tropical by birth and tropical by nature.  A child of the sun and of\r\npassion.  She had loved him as such women can love, but when her own\r\nphysical charms had faded--I am told that they once were great--there\r\nwas nothing to hold him.  We all liked her and felt for her and hated\r\nhim for the way that he treated her.  But he is plausible and cunning.\r\nThat is all I have to say to you.  Don't take him at his face value.\r\nThere is more behind.  Now I'll go.  No, no, don't detain me!  He is\r\nalmost due.\"\r\n\r\nWith a frightened look at the clock our strange visitor literally ran\r\nto the door and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Well!  Well!\" said Holmes, after an interval of silence.  \"Mr. Gibson\r\nseems to have a nice loyal household.  But the warning is a useful one,\r\nand now we can only wait till the man himself appears.\"\r\n\r\nSharp at the hour we heard a heavy step upon the stairs and the famous\r\nmillionaire was shown into the room.  As I looked upon him I understood\r\nnot only the fears and dislike of his manager, but also the execrations\r\nwhich so many business rivals have heaped upon his head.  If I were a\r\nsculptor and desired to idealize the successful man of affairs, iron of\r\nnerve and leathery of conscience, I should choose Mr. Neil Gibson as my\r\nmodel.  His tall, gaunt craggy figure had a suggestion of hunger and\r\nrapacity.  An Abraham Lincoln keyed to base uses instead of high ones\r\nwould give some idea of the man.  His face might have been chiselled in\r\ngranite, hard-set, craggy, remorseless, with deep lines upon it, the\r\nscars of many a crisis.  Cold grey eyes, looking shrewdly out from\r\nunder bristling brows, surveyed us each in turn.  He bowed in\r\nperfunctory fashion as Holmes mentioned my name, and then with a\r\nmasterful air of possession he drew a chair up to my companion and\r\nseated himself with his bony knees almost touching him.\r\n\r\n\"Let me say right here, Mr. Holmes,\" he began, \"that money is nothing\r\nto me in this case.  You can burn it if it's any use in lighting you to\r\nthe truth.  This woman is innocent and this woman has to be cleared,\r\nand it's up to you to do it.  Name your figure!\"\r\n\r\n\"My professional charges are upon a fixed scale,\" said Holmes coldly.\r\n\"I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if dollars make no difference to you, think of the reputation.\r\nIf you pull this off every paper in England and America will be booming\r\nyou.  You'll be the talk of two continents.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Gibson, I do not think that I am in need of booming.\r\nIt may surprise you to know that I prefer to work anonymously, and that\r\nit is the problem itself which attracts me.  But we are wasting time.\r\nLet us get down to the facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that you will find all the main ones in the Press reports.  I\r\ndon't know that I can add anything which will help you.  But if there\r\nis anything you would wish more light upon--well, I am here to give it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there is just one point.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What were the exact relations between you and Miss Dunbar?\"\r\n\r\nThe Gold King gave a violent start, and half rose from his chair.  Then\r\nhis massive calm came back to him.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you are within your rights--and maybe doing your duty--in\r\nasking such a question, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will agree to suppose so,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Then I can assure you that our relations were entirely and always\r\nthose of an employer towards a young lady whom he never conversed with,\r\nor ever saw, save when she was in the company of his children.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes rose from his chair.\r\n\r\n\"I am a rather busy man, Mr. Gibson,\" said he, \"and I have no time or\r\ntaste for aimless conversations.  I wish you good morning.\"\r\n\r\nOur visitor had risen also and his great loose figure towered above\r\nHolmes.  There was an angry gleam from under those bristling brows and\r\na tinge of colour in the sallow cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil do you mean by this, Mr. Holmes?  Do you dismiss my\r\ncase?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Gibson, at least I dismiss you.  I should have thought my\r\nwords were plain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plain enough, but what's at the back of it?  Raising the price on me,\r\nor afraid to tackle it, or what?  I've a right to a plain answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps you have,\" said Holmes.  \"I'll give you one.  This case\r\nis quite sufficiently complicated to start with, without the further\r\ndifficulty of false information.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meaning that I lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was trying to express it as delicately as I could, but if you\r\ninsist upon the word I will not contradict you.\"\r\n\r\nI sprang to my feet, for the expression upon the millionaire's face was\r\nfiendish in its intensity, and he had raised his great knotted fist.\r\nHolmes smiled languidly and reached his hand out for his pipe.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be noisy, Mr. Gibson.  I find that after breakfast even the\r\nsmallest argument is unsettling.  I suggest that a stroll in the\r\nmorning air and a little quiet thought will be greatly to your\r\nadvantage.\"\r\n\r\nWith an effort the Gold King mastered his fury.  I could not but admire\r\nhim, for by a supreme self-command he had turned in a minute from a hot\r\nflame of anger to a frigid and contemptuous indifference.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's your choice.  I guess you know how to run your own\r\nbusiness.  I can't make you touch the case against your will.  You've\r\ndone yourself no good this morning, Mr. Holmes, for I have broken\r\nstronger men than you.  No man ever crossed me and was the better for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"So many have said so, and yet here I am,\" said Holmes, smiling.\r\n\"Well, good morning, Mr. Gibson.  You have a good deal yet to learn.\"\r\n\r\nOur visitor made a noisy exit, but Holmes smoked in imperturbable\r\nsilence with dreamy eyes fixed upon the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"Any views, Watson?\" he asked at last.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Holmes, I must confess that when I consider that this is a man\r\nwho would certainly brush any obstacle from his path, and when I\r\nremember that his wife may have been an obstacle and an object of\r\ndislike, as that man Bates plainly told us, it seems to me----\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  And to me also.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what were his relations with the governess and how did you\r\ndiscover them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bluff, Watson, bluff!  When I considered the passionate,\r\nunconventional, unbusinesslike tone of his letter, and contrasted it\r\nwith his self-contained manner and appearance, it was pretty clear that\r\nthere was some deep emotion which centred upon the accused woman rather\r\nthan upon the victim.  We've got to understand the exact relations of\r\nthose three people if we are to reach the truth.  You saw the frontal\r\nattack which I made upon him and how imperturbably he received it.\r\nThen I bluffed him by giving him the impression that I was absolutely\r\ncertain, when in reality I was only extremely suspicious.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he will come back?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is sure to come back.  He must come back.  He can't leave it where\r\nit is.  Ha! isn't that a ring?  Yes, there is his footstep.  Well, Mr.\r\nGibson, I was just saying to Dr. Watson that you were somewhat overdue.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gold King had re-entered the room in a more chastened mood than he\r\nhad left it.  His wounded pride still showed in his resentful eyes, but\r\nhis common sense had shown him that he must yield if he would attain\r\nhis end.\r\n\r\n\"I've been thinking it over, Mr. Holmes, and I feel that I have been\r\nhasty in taking your remarks amiss.  You are justified in getting down\r\nto the facts, whatever they may be, and I think the more of you for it.\r\nI can assure you, however, that the relations between Miss Dunbar and\r\nme don't really touch this case.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is for me to decide, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I guess that is so.  You're like a surgeon who wants every\r\nsymptom before he can give his diagnosis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  That expresses it.  And it is only a patient who has an\r\nobject in deceiving his surgeon who would conceal the facts of his\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be so, but you will admit, Mr. Holmes, that most men would\r\nshy off a bit when they are asked point-blank what their relations with\r\na woman may be--if there is really some serious feeling in the case.  I\r\nguess most men have a little private reserve of their own in some\r\ncorner of their souls where they don't welcome intruders.  And you\r\nburst suddenly into it.  But the object excuses you, since it was to\r\ntry and save her.  Well, the stakes are down and the reserve open and\r\nyou can explore where you will.  What is it you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"The truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gold King paused for a moment as one who marshals his thoughts.\r\nHis grim, deep-lined face had become even sadder and more grave.\r\n\r\n\"I can give it to you in a very few words, Mr. Holmes,\" said he at\r\nlast.  \"There are some things that are painful as well as difficult to\r\nsay, so I won't go deeper than is needful.  I met my wife when I was\r\ngold-hunting in Brazil.  Maria Pinto was the daughter of a Government\r\nofficial at Manaos, and she was very beautiful.  I was young and ardent\r\nin those days, but even now, as I look back with colder blood and a\r\nmore critical eye, I can see that she was rare and wonderful in her\r\nbeauty.  It was a deep rich nature, too, passionate, whole-hearted,\r\ntropical, ill-balanced, very different from the American women whom I\r\nhad known.  Well, to make a long story short, I loved her and I married\r\nher.  It was only when the romance had passed--and it lingered for\r\nyears--that I realized that we had nothing--absolutely nothing--in\r\ncommon.  My love faded.  If hers had faded also it might have been\r\neasier.  But you know the wonderful way of women!  Do what I might\r\nnothing could turn her from me.  If I have been harsh to her, even\r\nbrutal as some have said, it has been because I knew that if I could\r\nkill her love, or if it turned to hate, it would be easier for both of\r\nus.  But nothing changed her.  She adored me in those English woods as\r\nshe had adored me twenty years ago on the banks of the Amazon.  Do what\r\nI might, she was as devoted as ever.\r\n\r\n\"Then came Miss Grace Dunbar.  She answered our advertisement and\r\nbecame governess to our two children.  Perhaps you have seen her\r\nportrait in the papers.  The whole world has proclaimed that she also\r\nis a very beautiful woman.  Now, I make no pretence to be more moral\r\nthan my neighbours, and I will admit to you that I could not live under\r\nthe same roof with such a woman and in daily contact with her without\r\nfeeling a passionate regard for her.  Do you blame me, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not blame you for feeling it.  I should blame you if you\r\nexpressed it, since this young lady was in a sense under your\r\nprotection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe so,\" said the millionaire, though for a moment the reproof\r\nhad brought the old angry gleam into his eyes.  \"I'm not pretending to\r\nbe any better than I am.  I guess all my life I've been a man that\r\nreached out his hand for what he wanted, and I never wanted anything\r\nmore than the love and possession of that woman.  I told her so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you did, did you?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes could look very formidable when he was moved.\r\n\r\n\"I said to her that if I could marry her I would, but that it was out\r\nof my power.  I said that money was no object and that all I could do\r\nto make her happy and comfortable would be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very generous, I am sure,\" said Holmes, with a sneer.\r\n\r\n\"See here, Mr. Holmes.  I came to you on a question of evidence, not on\r\na question of morals.  I'm not asking for your criticism.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is only for the young lady's sake that I touch your case at all,\"\r\nsaid Holmes sternly.  \"I don't know that anything she is accused of is\r\nreally worse than what you have yourself admitted, that you have tried\r\nto ruin a defenceless girl who was under your roof.  Some of you rich\r\nmen have to be taught that all the world cannot be bribed into\r\ncondoning your offences.\"\r\n\r\nTo my surprise the Gold King took the reproof with equanimity.\r\n\r\n\"That's how I feel myself about it now.  I thank God that my plans did\r\nnot work out as I intended.  She would have none of it, and she wanted\r\nto leave the house instantly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did she not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, in the first place, others were dependent upon her, and it was\r\nno light matter for her to let them all down by sacrificing her living.\r\nWhen I had sworn--as I did--that she should never be molested again,\r\nshe consented to remain.  But there was another reason.  She knew the\r\ninfluence she had over me, and that it was stronger than any other\r\ninfluence in the world.  She wanted to use it for good.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, she knew something of my affairs.  They are large, Mr.\r\nHolmes--large beyond the belief of an ordinary man.  I can make or\r\nbreak--and it is usually break.  It wasn't individuals only.  It was\r\ncommunities, cities, even nations.  Business is a hard game, and the\r\nweak go to the wall.  I played the game for all it was worth.  I never\r\nsquealed myself and I never cared if the other fellow squealed.  But\r\nshe saw it different.  I guess she was right.  She believed and said\r\nthat a fortune for one man that was more than he needed should not be\r\nbuilt on ten thousand ruined men who were left without the means of\r\nlife.  That was how she saw it, and I guess she could see past the\r\ndollars to something that was more lasting.  She found that I listened\r\nto what she said, and she believed she was serving the world by\r\ninfluencing my actions.  So she stayed--and then this came along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you throw any light upon that?\"\r\n\r\nThe Gold King paused for a minute or more, his head sunk in his hands,\r\nlost in deep thought.\r\n\r\n\"It's very black against her.  I can't deny that.  And women lead an\r\ninward life and may do things beyond the judgment of a man.  At first I\r\nwas so rattled and taken aback that I was ready to think she had been\r\nled away in some extraordinary fashion that was clean against her usual\r\nnature.  One explanation came into my head.  I give it to you, Mr.\r\nHolmes, for what it is worth.  There is no doubt that my wife was\r\nbitterly jealous.  There is a soul-jealousy that can be as frantic as\r\nany body-jealousy, and though my wife had no cause--and I think she\r\nunderstood this--for the latter, she was aware that this English girl\r\nexerted an influence upon my mind and my acts that she herself never\r\nhad.  It was an influence for good, but that did not mend the matter.\r\nShe was crazy with hatred, and the heat of the Amazon was always in her\r\nblood.  She might have planned to murder Miss Dunbar--or we will say to\r\nthreaten her with a gun and so frighten her into leaving us.  Then\r\nthere might have been a scuffle and the gun gone off and shot the woman\r\nwho held it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That possibility had already occurred to me,\" said Holmes.  \"Indeed,\r\nit is the only obvious alternative to deliberate murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she utterly denies it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is not final--is it?  One can understand that a woman\r\nplaced in so awful a position might hurry home still in her\r\nbewilderment holding the revolver.  She might even throw it down among\r\nher clothes, hardly knowing what she was doing, and when it was found\r\nshe might try to lie her way out by a total denial, since all\r\nexplanation was impossible.  What is against such a supposition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Dunbar herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes looked at his watch.  \"I have no doubt we can get the necessary\r\npermits this morning and reach Winchester by the evening train.  When I\r\nhave seen this young lady, it is very possible that I may be of more\r\nuse to you in the matter, though I cannot promise that my conclusions\r\nwill necessarily be such as you desire.\"\r\n\r\nThere was some delay in the official pass, and instead of reaching\r\nWinchester that day we went down to Thor Place, the Hampshire estate of\r\nMr. Neil Gibson.  He did not accompany us himself, but we had the\r\naddress of Sergeant Coventry, of the local police, who had first\r\nexamined into the affair.  He was a tall, thin, cadaverous man, with a\r\nsecretive and mysterious manner, which conveyed the idea that he knew\r\nor suspected a very great deal more than he dared say.  He had a trick,\r\ntoo, of suddenly sinking his voice to a whisper as if he had come upon\r\nsomething of vital importance, though the information was usually\r\ncommonplace enough.  Behind these tricks of manner he soon showed\r\nhimself to be a decent, honest fellow who was not too proud to admit\r\nthat he was out of his depth and would welcome any help.\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow, I'd rather have you than Scotland Yard, Mr. Holmes,\" said he.\r\n\"If the Yard gets called into a case, then the local loses all credit\r\nfor success and may be blamed for failure.  Now, you play straight, so\r\nI've heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"I need not appear in the matter at all,\" said Holmes, to the evident\r\nrelief of our melancholy acquaintance.  \"If I can clear it up I don't\r\nask to have my name mentioned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's very handsome of you, I am sure.  And your friend, Dr.\r\nWatson, can be trusted, I know.  Now, Mr. Holmes, as we walk down to\r\nthe place there is one question I should like to ask you.  I'd breathe\r\nit to no soul but you.\"  He looked round as though he hardly dare utter\r\nthe words.  \"Don't you think there might be a case against Mr. Neil\r\nGibson himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been considering that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've not seen Miss Dunbar.  She is a wonderful fine woman in every\r\nway.  He may well have wished his wife out of the road.  And these\r\nAmericans are readier with pistols than our folk are.  It was his\r\npistol, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was that clearly made out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.  It was one of a pair that he had.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of a pair?  Where is the other?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the gentleman has a lot of fire-arms of one sort and another.\r\nWe never quite matched that particular pistol--but the box was made for\r\ntwo.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it was one of a pair you should surely be able to match it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we have them all laid out at the house if you would care to look\r\nthem over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Later, perhaps.  I think we will walk down together and have a look at\r\nthe scene of the tragedy.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation had taken place in the little front room of Sergeant\r\nCoventry's humble cottage which served as the local police-station.  A\r\nwalk of half a mile or so across a wind-swept heath, all gold and\r\nbronze with the fading ferns, brought us to a side-gate opening into\r\nthe grounds of the Thor Place estate.  A path led us through the\r\npheasant preserves, and then from a clearing we saw the wide-spread,\r\nhalf-timbered house, half Tudor and half Georgian, upon the crest of\r\nthe hill.  Beside us there was a long, reedy pool, constricted in the\r\ncentre where the main carriage drive passed over a stone bridge, but\r\nswelling into small lakes on either side.  Our guide paused at the\r\nmouth of this bridge, and he pointed to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"That was where Mrs. Gibson's body lay.  I marked it by that stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand that you were there before it was moved?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; they sent for me at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who did?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gibson himself.  The moment the alarm was given and he had rushed\r\ndown with others from the house, he insisted that nothing should be\r\nmoved until the police should arrive.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was sensible.  I gathered from the newspaper report that the shot\r\nwas fired from close quarters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, very close.\"\r\n\r\n\"Near the right temple?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just behind it, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did the body lie?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the back, sir.  No trace of a struggle.  No marks.  No weapon.  The\r\nshort note from Miss Dunbar was clutched in her left hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clutched, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; we could hardly open the fingers.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is of great importance.  It excludes the idea that anyone could\r\nhave placed the note there after death in order to furnish a false\r\nclue.  Dear me!  The note, as I remember, was quite short.  'I will be\r\nat Thor Bridge at nine o'clock.--G. Dunbar.'  Was that not so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did Miss Dunbar admit writing it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was her explanation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her defence was reserved for the Assizes.  She would say nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"The problem is certainly a very interesting one.  The point of the\r\nletter is very obscure, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" said the guide, \"it seemed, if I may be so bold as to say\r\nso, the only really clear point in the whole case.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Granting that the letter is genuine and was really written, it was\r\ncertainly received some time before--say one hour or two.  Why, then,\r\nwas this lady still clasping it in her left hand?  Why should she carry\r\nit so carefully?  She did not need to refer to it in the interview.\r\nDoes it not seem remarkable?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, as you put it, perhaps it does.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I should like to sit quietly for a few minutes and think it\r\nout.\"  He seated himself upon the stone ledge of the bridge, and I\r\ncould see his quick grey eyes darting their questioning glances in\r\nevery direction.  Suddenly he sprang up again and ran across to the\r\nopposite parapet, whipped his lens from his pocket, and began to\r\nexamine the stonework.\r\n\r\n\"This is curious,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; we saw the chip on the ledge.  I expect it's been done by\r\nsome passer-by.\"\r\n\r\nThe stonework was grey, but at this one point it showed white for a\r\nspace not larger than a sixpence.  When examined closely one could see\r\nthat the surface was chipped as by a sharp blow.\r\n\r\n\"It took some violence to do that,\" said Holmes thoughtfully.  With his\r\ncane he struck the ledge several times without leaving a mark.  \"Yes,\r\nit was a hard knock.  In a curious place, too.  It was not from above\r\nbut from below, for you see that it is on the _lower_ edge of the\r\nparapet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is at least fifteen feet from the body.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is fifteen feet from the body.  It may have nothing to do with\r\nthe matter, but it is a point worth noting.  I do not think that we\r\nhave anything more to learn here.  There were no footsteps, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"The ground was iron hard, sir.  There were no traces at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we can go.  We will go up to the house first and look over these\r\nweapons of which you speak.  Then we shall get on to Winchester, for I\r\nshould desire to see Miss Dunbar before we go farther.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Neil Gibson had not returned from town, but we saw in the house the\r\nneurotic Mr. Bates who had called upon us in the morning.  He showed us\r\nwith a sinister relish the formidable array of fire-arms of various\r\nshapes and sizes which his employer had accumulated in the course of an\r\nadventurous life.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gibson has his enemies, as anyone would expect who knew him and\r\nhis methods,\" said he.  \"He sleeps with a loaded revolver in the drawer\r\nbeside his bed.  He is a man of violence, sir, and there are times when\r\nall of us are afraid of him.  I am sure that the poor lady who has\r\npassed was often terrified.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever witness physical violence towards her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I cannot say that.  But I have heard words which were nearly as\r\nbad--words of cold, cutting contempt, even before the servants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our millionaire does not seem to shine in private life,\" remarked\r\nHolmes, as we made our way to the station.  \"Well, Watson, we have come\r\non a good many facts, some of them new ones, and yet I seem some way\r\nfrom my conclusion.  In spite of the very evident dislike which Mr.\r\nBates has to his employer, I gather from him that when the alarm came\r\nhe was undoubtedly in his library.  Dinner was over at eight-thirty and\r\nall was normal up to then.  It is true that the alarm was somewhat late\r\nin the evening, but the tragedy certainly occurred about the hour named\r\nin the note.  There is no evidence at all that Mr. Gibson had been out\r\nof doors since his return from town at five o'clock.  On the other\r\nhand, Miss Dunbar, as I understand it, admits that she had made an\r\nappointment to meet Mrs. Gibson at the bridge.  Beyond this she would\r\nsay nothing, as her lawyer had advised her to reserve her defence.  We\r\nhave several very vital questions to ask that young lady, and my mind\r\nwill not be easy until we have seen her.  I must confess that the case\r\nwould seem to me to be very black against her if it were not for one\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that, Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"The finding of the pistol in her wardrobe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, Holmes!\" I cried, \"that seemed to me to be the most damning\r\nincident of all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, Watson.  It had struck me even at my first perfunctory reading\r\nas very strange, and now that I am in closer touch with the case it is\r\nmy only firm ground for hope.  We must look for consistency.  Where\r\nthere is a want of it we must suspect deception.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly follow you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well now, Watson, suppose for a moment that we visualize you in the\r\ncharacter of a woman who, in a cold, premeditated fashion, is about to\r\nget rid of a rival.  You have planned it.  A note has been written.\r\nThe victim has come.  You have your weapon.  The crime is done.  It has\r\nbeen workman-like and complete.  Do you tell me that after carrying out\r\nso crafty a crime you would now ruin your reputation as a criminal by\r\nforgetting to fling your weapon into those adjacent reed-beds which\r\nwould for ever cover it, but you must needs carry it carefully home and\r\nput it in your own wardrobe, the very first place that would be\r\nsearched?  Your best friends would hardly call you a schemer, Watson,\r\nand yet I could not picture you doing anything so crude as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the excitement of the moment----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Watson, I will not admit that it is possible.  Where a crime\r\nis coolly premeditated, then the means of covering it are coolly\r\npremeditated also.  I hope, therefore, that we are in the presence of a\r\nserious misconception.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is so much to explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we shall set about explaining it.  When once your point of view\r\nis changed, the very thing which was so damning becomes a clue to the\r\ntruth.  For example, there is this revolver.  Miss Dunbar disclaims all\r\nknowledge of it.  On our new theory she is speaking truth when she says\r\nso.  Therefore, it was placed in her wardrobe.  Who placed it there?\r\nSomeone who wished to incriminate her.  Was not that person the actual\r\ncriminal?  You see how we come at once upon a most fruitful line of\r\ninquiry.\"\r\n\r\nWe were compelled to spend the night at Winchester, as the formalities\r\nhad not yet been completed, but next morning, in the company of Mr.\r\nJoyce Cummings, the rising barrister who was entrusted with the\r\ndefence, we were allowed to see the young lady in her cell.  I had\r\nexpected from all that we had heard to see a beautiful woman, but I can\r\nnever forget the effect which Miss Dunbar produced upon me.  It was no\r\nwonder that even the masterful millionaire had found in her something\r\nmore powerful than himself--something which could control and guide\r\nhim.  One felt, too, as one looked at that strong, clear-cut, and yet\r\nsensitive face, that even should she be capable of some impetuous deed,\r\nnone the less there was an innate nobility of character which would\r\nmake her influence always for the good.  She was a brunette, tall, with\r\na noble figure and commanding presence, but her dark eyes had in them\r\nthe appealing, helpless expression of the hunted creature who feels the\r\nnets around it, but can see no way out from the toils.  Now, as she\r\nrealized the presence and the help of my famous friend, there came a\r\ntouch of colour in her wan cheeks and a light of hope began to glimmer\r\nin the glance which she turned upon us.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps Mr. Neil Gibson has told you something of what occurred\r\nbetween us?\" she asked, in a low, agitated voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Holmes answered; \"you need not pain yourself by entering into\r\nthat part of the story.  After seeing you, I am prepared to accept Mr.\r\nGibson's statement both as to the influence which you had over him and\r\nas to the innocence of your relations with him.  But why was the whole\r\nsituation not brought out in court?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to me incredible that such a charge could be sustained.  I\r\nthought that if we waited the whole thing must clear itself up without\r\nour being compelled to enter into painful details of the inner life of\r\nthe family.  But I understand that far from clearing it has become even\r\nmore serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear young lady,\" cried Holmes earnestly, \"I beg you to have no\r\nillusions upon the point.  Mr. Cummings here would assure you that all\r\nthe cards are at present against us, and that we must do everything\r\nthat is possible if we are to win clear.  It would be a cruel deception\r\nto pretend that you are not in very great danger.  Give me all the help\r\nyou can, then, to get at the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will conceal nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us, then, of your true relations with Mr. Gibson's wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"She hated me, Mr. Holmes.  She hated me with all the fervour of her\r\ntropical nature.  She was a woman who would do nothing by halves, and\r\nthe measure of her love for her husband was the measure also of her\r\nhatred for me.  It is probable that she misunderstood our relations.  I\r\nwould not wish to wrong her, but she loved so vividly in a physical\r\nsense that she could hardly understand the mental, and even spiritual,\r\ntie which held her husband to me, or imagine that it was only my desire\r\nto influence his power to good ends which kept me under his roof.  I\r\ncan see now that I was wrong.  Nothing could justify me in remaining\r\nwhere I was a cause of unhappiness, and yet it is certain that the\r\nunhappiness would have remained even if I had left the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Miss Dunbar,\" said Holmes, \"I beg you to tell us exactly what\r\noccurred that evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can tell you the truth so far as I know it, Mr. Holmes, but I am in\r\na position to prove nothing, and there are points--the most vital\r\npoints--which I can neither explain nor can I imagine any explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will find the facts, perhaps others may find the explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"With regard, then, to my presence at Thor Bridge that night, I\r\nreceived a note from Mrs. Gibson in the morning.  It lay on the table\r\nof the schoolroom, and it may have been left there by her own hand.  It\r\nimplored me to see her there after dinner, said she had something\r\nimportant to say to me, and asked me to leave an answer on the sundial\r\nin the garden, as she desired no one to be in our confidence.  I saw no\r\nreason for such secrecy, but I did as she asked, accepting the\r\nappointment.  She asked me to destroy her note and I burned it in the\r\nschoolroom grate.  She was very much afraid of her husband, who treated\r\nher with a harshness for which I frequently reproached him, and I could\r\nonly imagine that she acted in this way because she did not wish him to\r\nknow of our interview.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet she kept your reply very carefully?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I was surprised to hear that she had it in her hand when she\r\ndied.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what happened then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I went down as I had promised.  When I reached the bridge she was\r\nwaiting for me.  Never did I realize till that moment how this poor\r\ncreature hated me.  She was like a mad woman--indeed, I think she was a\r\nmad woman, subtly mad with the deep power of deception which insane\r\npeople may have.  How else could she have met me with unconcern every\r\nday and yet had so raging a hatred of me in her heart?  I will not say\r\nwhat she said.  She poured her whole wild fury out in burning and\r\nhorrible words.  I did not even answer--I could not.  It was dreadful\r\nto see her.  I put my hands to my ears and rushed away.  When I left\r\nher she was standing still shrieking out her curses at me, in the mouth\r\nof the bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where she was afterwards found?\"\r\n\r\n\"Within a few yards from the spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, presuming that she met her death shortly after you left her,\r\nyou heard no shot?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I heard nothing.  But, indeed, Mr. Holmes, I was so agitated and\r\nhorrified by this terrible outbreak that I rushed to get back to the\r\npeace of my own room, and I was incapable of noticing anything which\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say that you returned to your room.  Did you leave it again before\r\nnext morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; when the alarm came that the poor creature had met her death I\r\nran out with the others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see Mr. Gibson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he had just returned from the bridge when I saw him.  He had sent\r\nfor the doctor and the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he seem to you much perturbed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gibson is a very strong, self-contained man.  I do not think that\r\nhe would ever show his emotions on the surface.  But I, who knew him so\r\nwell, could see that he was deeply concerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we come to the all-important point.  This pistol that was found\r\nin your room.  Had you ever seen it before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, I swear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"When was it found?\"\r\n\r\n\"Next morning, when the police made their search.\"\r\n\r\n\"Among your clothes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; on the floor of my wardrobe under my dresses.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could not guess how long it had been there?\"\r\n\r\n\"It had not been there the morning before.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I tidied out the wardrobe.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is final.  Then someone came into your room and placed the pistol\r\nthere in order to inculpate you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must have been so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when?\"\r\n\r\n\"It could only have been at meal-time, or else at the hours when I\r\nwould be in the schoolroom with the children.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you were when you got the note?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; from that time onwards for the whole morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Miss Dunbar.  Is there any other point which could help me\r\nin the investigation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can think of none.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was some sign of violence on the stonework of the bridge--a\r\nperfectly fresh chip just opposite the body.  Could you suggest any\r\npossible explanation of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely it must be a mere coincidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Curious, Miss Dunbar, very curious.  Why should it appear at the very\r\ntime of the tragedy and why at the very place?\"\r\n\r\n\"But what could have caused it?  Only great violence could have such an\r\neffect.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes did not answer.  His pale, eager face had suddenly assumed that\r\ntense, far-away expression which I had learned to associate with the\r\nsupreme manifestations of his genius.  So evident was the crisis in his\r\nmind that none of us dared to speak, and we sat, barrister, prisoner,\r\nand myself, watching him in a concentrated and absorbed silence.\r\nSuddenly he sprang from his chair, vibrating with nervous energy and\r\nthe pressing need for action.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Watson, come!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, my dear lady.  You will hear from me, Mr. Cummings.  With\r\nthe help of the God of justice I will give you a case which will make\r\nEngland ring.  You will get news by to-morrow, Miss Dunbar, and\r\nmeanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are lifting and that I have\r\nevery hope that the light of truth is breaking through.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not a long journey from Winchester to Thor Place, but it was\r\nlong to me in my impatience, while for Holmes it was evident that it\r\nseemed endless; for, in his nervous restlessness, he could not sit\r\nstill, but paced the carriage or drummed with his long, sensitive\r\nfingers upon the cushions beside him.  Suddenly, however, as we neared\r\nour destination he seated himself opposite to me--we had a first-class\r\ncarriage to ourselves--and laying a hand upon each of my knees he\r\nlooked into my eyes with the peculiarly mischievous gaze which was\r\ncharacteristic of his more imp-like moods.\r\n\r\n\"Watson,\" said he, \"I have some recollection that you go armed upon\r\nthese excursions of ours.\"\r\n\r\nIt was as well for him that I did so, for he took little care for his\r\nown safety when his mind was once absorbed by a problem, so that more\r\nthan once my revolver had been a good friend in need.  I reminded him\r\nof the fact.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I am a little absent-minded in such matters.  But have you\r\nyour revolver on you?\"\r\n\r\nI produced it from my hip-pocket, a short, handy, but very serviceable\r\nlittle weapon.  He undid the catch, shook out the cartridges, and\r\nexamined it with care.\r\n\r\n\"It's heavy--remarkably heavy,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is a solid bit of work.\"\r\n\r\nHe mused over it for a minute.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Watson,\" said he, \"I believe your revolver is going to\r\nhave a very intimate connection with the mystery which we are\r\ninvestigating.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Holmes, you are joking.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Watson, I am very serious.  There is a test before us.  If the\r\ntest comes off, all will be clear.  And the test will depend upon the\r\nconduct of this little weapon.  One cartridge out.  Now we will replace\r\nthe other five and put on the safety-catch.  So!  That increases the\r\nweight and makes it a better reproduction.\"\r\n\r\nI had no glimmer of what was in his mind nor did he enlighten me, but\r\nsat lost in thought until we pulled up in the little Hampshire station.\r\nWe secured a ramshackle trap, and in a quarter of an hour were at the\r\nhouse of our confidential friend, the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\"A clue, Mr. Holmes?  What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It all depends upon the behaviour of Dr. Watson's revolver,\" said my\r\nfriend.  \"Here it is.  Now, officer, can you give me ten yards of\r\nstring?\"\r\n\r\nThe village shop provided a ball of stout twine.\r\n\r\n\"I think that this is all we will need,\" said Holmes.  \"Now, if you\r\nplease, we will get off on what I hope is the last stage of our\r\njourney.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting and turning the rolling Hampshire moor into a\r\nwonderful autumnal panorama.  The sergeant, with many critical and\r\nincredulous glances, which showed his deep doubts of the sanity of my\r\ncompanion, lurched along beside us.  As we approached the scene of the\r\ncrime I could see that my friend under all his habitual coolness was in\r\ntruth deeply agitated.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, in answer to my remark, \"you have seen me miss my mark\r\nbefore, Watson.  I have an instinct for such things, and yet it has\r\nsometimes played me false.  It seemed a certainty when first it flashed\r\nacross my mind in the cell at Winchester, but one drawback of an active\r\nmind is that one can always conceive alternative explanations which\r\nwould make our scent a false one.  And yet--and yet----  Well, Watson,\r\nwe can but try.\"\r\n\r\nAs he walked he had firmly tied one end of the string to the handle of\r\nthe revolver.  We had now reached the scene of the tragedy.  With great\r\ncare he marked out under the guidance of the policeman the exact spot\r\nwhere the body had been stretched.  He then hunted among the heather\r\nand the ferns until he found a considerable stone.  This he secured to\r\nthe other end of his line of string, and he hung it over the parapet of\r\nthe bridge so that it swung clear above the water.  He then stood on\r\nthe fatal spot, some distance from the edge of the bridge, with my\r\nrevolver in his hand, the string being taut between the weapon and the\r\nheavy stone on the farther side.\r\n\r\n\"Now for it!\" he cried.\r\n\r\nAt the words he raised the pistol to his head, and then let go his\r\ngrip.  In an instant it had been whisked away by the weight of the\r\nstone, had struck with a sharp crack against the parapet, and had\r\nvanished over the side into the water.  It had hardly gone before\r\nHolmes was kneeling beside the stonework, and a joyous cry showed that\r\nhe had found what he expected.\r\n\r\n\"Was there ever a more exact demonstration?\" he cried.  \"See, Watson,\r\nyour revolver has solved the problem!\"  As he spoke he pointed to a\r\nsecond chip of the exact size and shape of the first which had appeared\r\non the under edge of the stone balustrade.\r\n\r\n\"We'll stay at the inn to-night,\" he continued, as he rose and faced\r\nthe astonished sergeant.  \"You will, of course, get a grappling-hook\r\nand you will easily restore my friend's revolver.  You will also find\r\nbeside it the revolver, string and weight with which this vindictive\r\nwoman attempted to disguise her own crime and to fasten a charge of\r\nmurder upon an innocent victim.  You can let Mr. Gibson know that I\r\nwill see him in the morning, when steps can be taken for Miss Dunbar's\r\nvindication.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLate that evening, as we sat together smoking our pipes in the village\r\ninn, Holmes gave me a brief review of what had passed.\r\n\r\n\"I fear, Watson,\" said he, \"that you will not improve any reputation\r\nwhich I may have acquired by adding the Case of the Thor Bridge Mystery\r\nto your annals.  I have been sluggish in mind and wanting in that\r\nmixture of imagination and reality which is the basis of my art.  I\r\nconfess that the chip in the stonework was a sufficient clue to suggest\r\nthe true solution, and that I blame myself for not having attained it\r\nsooner.\r\n\r\n\"It must be admitted that the workings of this unhappy woman's mind\r\nwere deep and subtle, so that it was no very simple matter to unravel\r\nher plot.  I do not think that in our adventures we have ever come\r\nacross a stranger example of what perverted love can bring about.\r\nWhether Miss Dunbar was her rival in a physical or in a merely mental\r\nsense seems to have been equally unforgivable in her eyes.  No doubt\r\nshe blamed this innocent lady for all those harsh dealings and unkind\r\nwords with which her husband tried to repel her too demonstrative\r\naffection.  Her first resolution was to end her own life.  Her second\r\nwas to do it in such a way as to involve her victim in a fate which was\r\nworse far than any sudden death could be.\r\n\r\n\"We can follow the various steps quite clearly, and they show a\r\nremarkable subtlety of mind.  A note was extracted very cleverly from\r\nMiss Dunbar which would make it appear that she had chosen the scene of\r\nthe crime.  In her anxiety that it should be discovered she somewhat\r\noverdid it, by holding it in her hand to the last.  This alone should\r\nhave excited my suspicions earlier than it did.\r\n\r\n\"Then she took one of her husband's revolvers--there was, as you saw,\r\nan arsenal in the house--and kept it for her own use.  A similar one\r\nshe concealed that morning in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe after discharging\r\none barrel, which she could easily do in the woods without attracting\r\nattention.  She then went down to the bridge where she had contrived\r\nthis exceedingly ingenious method for getting rid of her weapon.  When\r\nMiss Dunbar appeared she used her last breath in pouring out her\r\nhatred, and then, when she was out of hearing, carried out her terrible\r\npurpose.  Every link is now in its place and the chain is complete.\r\nThe papers may ask why the mere was not dragged in the first instance,\r\nbut it is easy to be wise after the event, and in any case the expanse\r\nof a reed-filled lake is no easy matter to drag unless you have a clear\r\nperception of what you are looking for and where.  Well, Watson, we\r\nhave helped a remarkable woman, and also a formidable man.  Should they\r\nin the future join their forces, as seems not unlikely, the financial\r\nworld may find that Mr. Neil Gibson has learned something in that\r\nschoolroom of Sorrow where our earthly lessons are taught.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE CREEPING MAN\r\n\r\nMr. Sherlock Holmes was always of opinion that I should publish the\r\nsingular facts connected with Professor Presbury, if only to dispel\r\nonce for all the ugly rumours which some twenty years ago agitated the\r\nUniversity and were echoed in the learned societies of London.  There\r\nwere, however, certain obstacles in the way, and the true history of\r\nthis curious case remained entombed in the tin box which contains so\r\nmany records of my friend's adventures.  Now we have at last obtained\r\npermission to ventilate the facts which formed one of the very last\r\ncases handled by Holmes before his retirement from practice.  Even now\r\na certain reticence and discretion have to be observed in laying the\r\nmatter before the public.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one Sunday evening early in September of the year 1903 that I\r\nreceived one of Holmes's laconic messages: \"Come at once if\r\nconvenient--if inconvenient come all the same.--S.H.\"  The relations\r\nbetween us in those latter days were peculiar.  He was a man of habits,\r\nnarrow and concentrated habits, and I had become one of them.  As an\r\ninstitution I was like the violin, the shag tobacco, the old black\r\npipe, the index books, and others perhaps less excusable.  When it was\r\na case of active work and a comrade was needed upon whose nerve he\r\ncould place some reliance, my role was obvious.  But apart from this I\r\nhad uses.  I was a whetstone for his mind.  I stimulated him.  He liked\r\nto think aloud in my presence.  His remarks could hardly be said to be\r\nmade to me--many of them would have been as appropriately addressed to\r\nhis bedstead--but none the less, having formed the habit, it had become\r\nin some way helpful that I should register and interject.  If I\r\nirritated him by a certain methodical slowness in my mentality, that\r\nirritation served only to make his own flame-like intuitions and\r\nimpressions flash up the more vividly and swiftly.  Such was my humble\r\nrole in our alliance.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at Baker Street I found him huddled up in his arm-chair\r\nwith updrawn knees, his pipe in his mouth and his brow furrowed with\r\nthought.  It was clear that he was in the throes of some vexatious\r\nproblem.  With a wave of his hand he indicated my old arm-chair, but\r\notherwise for half an hour he gave no sign that he was aware of my\r\npresence.  Then with a start he seemed to come from his reverie, and,\r\nwith his usual whimsical smile, he greeted me back to what had once\r\nbeen my home.\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse a certain abstraction of mind, my dear Watson,\" said\r\nhe.  \"Some curious facts have been submitted to me within the last\r\ntwenty-four hours, and they in turn have given rise to some\r\nspeculations of a more general character.  I have serious thoughts of\r\nwriting a small monograph upon the uses of dogs in the work of the\r\ndetective.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely, Holmes, this has been explored,\" said I.\r\n\"Bloodhounds--sleuth-hounds----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Watson; that side of the matter is, of course, obvious.  But\r\nthere is another which is far more subtle.  You may recollect that in\r\nthe case which you, in your sensational way, coupled with the Copper\r\nBeeches, I was able, by watching the mind of the child, to form a\r\ndeduction as to the criminal habits of the very smug and respectable\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I remember it well.\"\r\n\r\n\"My line of thoughts about dogs is analogous.  A dog reflects the\r\nfamily life.  Whoever saw a frisky dog in a gloomy family, or a sad dog\r\nin a happy one?  Snarling people have snarling dogs, dangerous people\r\nhave dangerous ones.  And their passing moods may reflect the passing\r\nmoods of others.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head.  \"Surely, Holmes, this is a little far-fetched,\" said\r\nI.\r\n\r\nHe had refilled his pipe and resumed his seat, taking no notice of my\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n\"The practical application of what I have said is very close to the\r\nproblem which I am investigating.  It is a tangled skein, you\r\nunderstand, and I am looking for a loose end.  One possible loose end\r\nlies in the question: Why does Professor Presbury's faithful\r\nwolf-hound, Roy, endeavour to bite him?\"\r\n\r\nI sank back in my chair in some disappointment.  Was it for so trivial\r\na question as this that I had been summoned from my work?  Holmes\r\nglanced across at me.\r\n\r\n\"The same old Watson!\" said he.  \"You never learn that the gravest\r\nissues may depend upon the smallest things.  But is it not on the face\r\nof it strange that a staid, elderly philosopher--you've heard of\r\nPresbury, of course, the famous Camford physiologist?--that such a man,\r\nwhose friend has been his devoted wolf-hound, should now have been\r\ntwice attacked by his own dog?  What do you make of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The dog is ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that has to be considered.  But he attacks no one else, nor does\r\nhe apparently molest his master, save on very special occasions.\r\nCurious, Watson--very curious.  But young Mr. Bennett is before his\r\ntime, if that is his ring.  I had hoped to have a longer chat with you\r\nbefore he came.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a quick step on the stairs, a sharp tap at the door, and a\r\nmoment later the new client presented himself.  He was a tall, handsome\r\nyouth about thirty, well dressed and elegant, but with something in his\r\nbearing which suggested the shyness of the student rather than the\r\nself-possession of the man of the world.  He shook hands with Holmes,\r\nand then looked with some surprise at me.\r\n\r\n\"This matter is very delicate, Mr. Holmes,\" he said.  \"Consider the\r\nrelation in which I stand to Professor Presbury, both privately and\r\npublicly.  I really can hardly justify myself if I speak before any\r\nthird person.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have no fear, Mr. Bennett.  Dr. Watson is the very soul of discretion,\r\nand I can assure you that this is a matter in which I am very likely to\r\nneed an assistant.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you like, Mr. Holmes.  You will, I am sure, understand my having\r\nsome reserves in the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will appreciate it, Watson, when I tell you that this gentleman,\r\nMr. Trevor Bennett, is professional assistant to the great scientist,\r\nlives under his roof, and is engaged to his only daughter.  Certainly\r\nwe must agree that the Professor has every claim upon his loyalty and\r\ndevotion.  But it may best be shown by taking the necessary steps to\r\nclear up this strange mystery.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, Mr. Holmes.  That is my one object.  Does Dr. Watson know\r\nthe situation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not had time to explain it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then perhaps I had better go over the ground again before explaining\r\nsome fresh developments.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do so myself,\" said Holmes, \"in order to show that I have the\r\nevents in their due order.  The Professor, Watson, is a man of European\r\nreputation.  His life has been academic.  There has never been a breath\r\nof scandal.  He is a widower with one daughter, Edith.  He is, I\r\ngather, a man of very virile and positive, one might almost say\r\ncombative, character.  So the matter stood until a very few months ago.\r\n\r\n\"Then the current of his life was broken.  He is sixty-one years of\r\nage, but he became engaged to the daughter of Professor Morphy, his\r\ncolleague in the chair of Comparative Anatomy.  It was not, as I\r\nunderstand, the reasoned courting of an elderly man, but rather the\r\npassionate frenzy of youth, for no one could have shown himself a more\r\ndevoted lover.  The lady, Alice Morphy, was a very perfect girl both in\r\nmind and body, so that there was every excuse for the Professor's\r\ninfatuation.  Nonetheless, it did not meet with full approval in his\r\nown family.\"\r\n\r\n\"We thought it rather excessive,\" said our visitor.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  Excessive and a little violent and unnatural.  Professor\r\nPresbury was rich, however, and there was no objection upon the part of\r\nthe father.  The daughter, however, had other views, and there were\r\nalready several candidates for her hand, who, if they were less\r\neligible from a worldly point of view, were at least more of an age.\r\nThe girl seemed to like the Professor in spite of his eccentricities.\r\nIt was only age which stood in the way.\r\n\r\n\"About this time a little mystery suddenly clouded the normal routine\r\nof the Professor's life.  He did what he had never done before.  He\r\nleft home and gave no indication where he was going.  He was away a\r\nfortnight, and returned looking rather travel-worn.  He made no\r\nallusion to where he had been, although he was usually the frankest of\r\nmen.  It chanced, however, that our client here, Mr. Bennett, received\r\na letter from a fellow-student in Prague, who said that he was glad to\r\nhave seen Professor Presbury there, although he had not been able to\r\ntalk to him.  Only in this way did his own household learn where he had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\n\"Now comes the point.  From that time onwards a curious change came\r\nover the Professor.  He became furtive and sly.  Those around him had\r\nalways the feeling that he was not the man that they had known, but\r\nthat he was under some shadow which had darkened his higher qualities.\r\nHis intellect was not affected.  His lectures were as brilliant as\r\never.  But always there was something new, something sinister and\r\nunexpected.  His daughter, who was devoted to him, tried again and\r\nagain to resume the old relations and to penetrate this mask which her\r\nfather seemed to have put on.  You, sir, as I understand, did the\r\nsame--but all was in vain.  And now, Mr. Bennett, tell in your own\r\nwords the incident of the letters.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must understand, Dr. Watson, that the Professor had no secrets\r\nfrom me.  If I were his son or his younger brother, I could not have\r\nmore completely enjoyed his confidence.  As his secretary I handled\r\nevery paper which came to him, and I opened and subdivided his letters.\r\nShortly after his return all this was changed.  He told me that certain\r\nletters might come to him from London which would be marked by a cross\r\nunder the stamp.  These were to be set aside for his own eyes only.  I\r\nmay say that several of these did pass through my hands, that they had\r\nthe E.C. mark, and were in an illiterate handwriting.  If he answered\r\nthem at all the answers did not pass through my hands nor into the\r\nletter-basket in which our correspondence was collected.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the box,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, the box.  The Professor brought back a little wooden box from\r\nhis travels.  It was the one thing which suggested a Continental tour,\r\nfor it was one of those quaint carved things which one associates with\r\nGermany.  This he placed in his instrument cupboard.  One day, in\r\nlooking for a cannula, I took up the box.  To my surprise he was very\r\nangry, and reproved me in words which were quite savage for my\r\ncuriosity.  It was the first time such a thing had happened and I was\r\ndeeply hurt.  I endeavoured to explain that it was a mere accident that\r\nI had touched the box, but all the evening I was conscious that he\r\nlooked at me harshly and that the incident was rankling in his mind.\"\r\nMr. Bennett drew a little diary book from his pocket.  \"That was on\r\nJuly 2,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"You are certainly an admirable witness,\" said Holmes.  \"I may need\r\nsome of these dates which you have noted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I learned method among other things from my great teacher.  From the\r\ntime that I observed abnormality in his behaviour I felt that it was my\r\nduty to study his case.  Thus I have it here that it was on that very\r\nday, July 2, that Roy attacked the Professor, as he came from his study\r\ninto the hall.  Again on July 11, there was a scene of the same sort\r\nand then I have a note of yet another upon July 20.  After that we had\r\nto banish Roy to the stables.  He was a dear, affectionate animal--but\r\nI fear I weary you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett spoke in a tone of reproach, for it was very clear that\r\nHolmes was not listening.  His face was rigid and his eyes gazed\r\nabstractedly at the ceiling.  With an effort he recovered himself.\r\n\r\n\"Singular!  Most singular!\" he murmured.  \"These details were new to\r\nme, Mr. Bennett.  I think we have now fairly gone over the old ground,\r\nhave we not?  But you spoke of some fresh developments.\"\r\n\r\nThe pleasant, open face of our visitor clouded over, shadowed by some\r\ngrim remembrance.  \"What I speak of occurred the night before last,\"\r\nsaid he.  \"I was lying awake about two in the morning, when I was aware\r\nof a dull muffled sound coming from the passage.  I opened my door and\r\npeeped out.  I should explain that the Professor sleeps at the end of\r\nthe passage----\"\r\n\r\n\"The date being----?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\nOur visitor was clearly annoyed at so irrelevant an interruption.\r\n\r\n\"I have said, sir, that it was the night before last--that is,\r\nSeptember 4.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes nodded and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Pray continue,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"He sleeps at the end of the passage, and would have to pass my door in\r\norder to reach the staircase.  It was a really terrifying experience,\r\nMr. Holmes.  I think that I am as strong-nerved as my neighbours, but I\r\nwas shaken by what I saw.  The passage was dark save that one window\r\nhalf-way along it threw a patch of light.  I could see that something\r\nwas coming along the passage, something dark and crouching.  Then\r\nsuddenly it emerged into the light, and I saw that it was he.  He was\r\ncrawling, Mr. Holmes--crawling!  He was not quite on his hands and\r\nknees.  I should rather say on his hands and feet, with his face sunk\r\nbetween his hands.  Yet he seemed to move with ease.  I was so\r\nparalysed by the sight that it was not until he had reached my door\r\nthat I was able to step forward and ask if I could assist him.  His\r\nanswer was extraordinary.  He sprang up, spat out some atrocious word\r\nat me, and hurried on past me, and down the staircase.  I waited about\r\nfor an hour, but he did not come back.  It must have been daylight\r\nbefore he regained his room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Watson, what make you of that?\" asked Holmes, with the air of\r\nthe pathologist who presents a rare specimen.\r\n\r\n\"Lumbago, possibly.  I have known a severe attack make a man walk in\r\njust such a way, and nothing would be more trying to the temper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, Watson!  You always keep us flat-footed on the ground.  But we\r\ncan hardly accept lumbago, since he was able to stand erect in a\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was never better in health,\" said Bennett.  \"In fact, he is\r\nstronger than I have known him for years.  But there are the facts, Mr.\r\nHolmes.  It is not a case in which we can consult the police, and yet\r\nwe are utterly at our wits' end as to what to do, and we feel in some\r\nstrange way that we are drifting towards disaster.  Edith--Miss\r\nPresbury--feels as I do, that we cannot wait passively any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly a very curious and suggestive case.  What do you\r\nthink, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Speaking as a medical man,\" said I, \"it appears to be a case for an\r\nalienist.  The old gentleman's cerebral processes were disturbed by the\r\nlove affair.  He made a journey abroad in the hope of breaking himself\r\nof the passion.  His letters and the box may be connected with some\r\nother private transaction--a loan, perhaps, or share certificates,\r\nwhich are in the box.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the wolf-hound no doubt disapproved of the financial bargain.  No,\r\nno, Watson, there is more in it than this.  Now, I can only suggest----\"\r\n\r\nWhat Sherlock Holmes was about to suggest will never be known, for at\r\nthis moment the door opened and a young lady was shown into the room.\r\nAs she appeared Mr. Bennett sprang up with a cry and ran forward with\r\nhis hands out to meet those which she had herself outstretched.\r\n\r\n\"Edith, dear!  Nothing the matter, I hope?\"\r\n\r\n\"I felt I must follow you.  Oh, Jack, I have been so dreadfully\r\nfrightened!  It is awful to be there alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes, this is the young lady I spoke of.  This is my fiancée.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were gradually coming to that conclusion, were we not, Watson?\"\r\nHolmes answered, with a smile.  \"I take it, Miss Presbury, that there\r\nis some fresh development in the case, and that you thought we should\r\nknow?\"\r\n\r\nOur new visitor, a bright, handsome girl of a conventional English\r\ntype, smiled back at Holmes as she seated herself beside Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n\"When I found Mr. Bennett had left his hotel I thought I should\r\nprobably find him here.  Of course, he had told me that he would\r\nconsult you.  But, oh, Mr. Holmes, can you do nothing for my poor\r\nfather?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have hopes, Miss Presbury, but the case is still obscure.  Perhaps\r\nwhat you have to say may throw some fresh light upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was last night, Mr. Holmes.  He had been very strange all day.  I\r\nam sure that there are times when he has no recollection of what he\r\ndoes.  He lives as in a strange dream.  Yesterday was such a day.  It\r\nwas not my father with whom I lived.  His outward shell was there, but\r\nit was not really he.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me what happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was awakened in the night by the dog barking most furiously.  Poor\r\nRoy, he is chained now near the stable.  I may say that I always sleep\r\nwith my door locked; for, as Jack--as Mr. Bennett--will tell you, we\r\nall have a feeling of impending danger.  My room is on the second\r\nfloor.  It happened that the blind was up in my window, and there was\r\nbright moonlight outside.  As I lay with my eyes fixed upon the square\r\nof light, listening to the frenzied barkings of the dog, I was amazed\r\nto see my father's face looking in at me.  Mr. Holmes, I nearly died of\r\nsurprise and horror.  There it was pressed against the window-pane, and\r\none hand seemed to be raised as if to push up the window.  If that\r\nwindow had opened, I think I should have gone mad.  It was no delusion,\r\nMr. Holmes.  Don't deceive yourself by thinking so.  I dare say it was\r\ntwenty seconds or so that I lay paralysed and watched the face.  Then\r\nit vanished, but I could not--I could not spring out of bed and look\r\nout after it.  I lay cold and shivering till morning.  At breakfast he\r\nwas sharp and fierce in manner, and made no allusion to the adventure\r\nof the night.  Neither did I, but I gave an excuse for coming to\r\ntown--and here I am.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes looked thoroughly surprised at Miss Presbury's narrative.\r\n\r\n\"My dear young lady, you say that your room is on the second floor.  Is\r\nthere a long ladder in the garden?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mr. Holmes; that is the amazing part of it.  There is no possible\r\nway of reaching the window--and yet he was there.\"\r\n\r\n\"The date being September 5,\" said Holmes.  \"That certainly complicates\r\nmatters.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the young lady's turn to look surprised.  \"This is the second\r\ntime that you have alluded to the date, Mr. Holmes,\" said Bennett.  \"Is\r\nit possible that it has any bearing upon the case?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible--very possible--and yet I have not my full material at\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly you are thinking of the connection between insanity and\r\nphases of the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I assure you.  It was quite a different line of thought.  Possibly\r\nyou can leave your notebook with me and I will check the dates.  Now I\r\nthink, Watson, that our line of action is perfectly clear.  This young\r\nlady has informed us--and I have the greatest confidence in her\r\nintuition--that her father remembers little or nothing which occurs\r\nupon certain dates.  We will therefore call upon him as if he had given\r\nus an appointment upon such a date.  He will put it down to his own\r\nlack of memory.  Thus we will open our campaign by having a good close\r\nview of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is excellent,\" said Mr. Bennett.  \"I warn you, however, that the\r\nProfessor is irascible and violent at times.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes smiled.  \"There are reasons why we should come at once--very\r\ncogent reasons if my theories hold good.  To-morrow, Mr. Bennett, will\r\ncertainly see us in Camford.  There is, if I remember right, an inn\r\ncalled the 'Chequers' where the port used to be above mediocrity, and\r\nthe linen was above reproach.  I think, Watson, that our lot for the\r\nnext few days might lie in less pleasant places.\"\r\n\r\nMonday morning found us on our way to the famous University town--an\r\neasy effort on the part of Holmes, who had no roots to pull up, but one\r\nwhich involved frantic planning and hurrying on my part, as my practice\r\nwas by this time not inconsiderable.  Holmes made no allusion to the\r\ncase until after we had deposited our suit-cases at the ancient hostel\r\nof which he had spoken.\r\n\r\n\"I think, Watson, that we can catch the Professor just before lunch.\r\nHe lectures at eleven, and should have an interval at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"What possible excuse have we for calling?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes glanced at his notebook.\r\n\r\n\"There was a period of excitement upon August 26.  We will assume that\r\nhe is a little hazy as to what he does at such times.  If we insist\r\nthat we are there by appointment I think he will hardly venture to\r\ncontradict us.  Have you the effrontery necessary to put it through?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can but try.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent, Watson!  Compound of the Busy Bee and Excelsior.  We can\r\nbut try--the motto of the firm.  A friendly native will surely guide\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a one on the back of a smart hansom swept us past a row of ancient\r\ncolleges, and finally turning into a tree-lined drive pulled up at the\r\ndoor of a charming house, girt round with lawns and covered with purple\r\nwistaria.  Professor Presbury was certainly surrounded with every sign\r\nnot only of comfort but of luxury.  Even as we pulled up a grizzled\r\nhead appeared at the front window, and we were aware of a pair of keen\r\neyes from under shaggy brows which surveyed us through large horn\r\nglasses.  A moment later we were actually in his sanctum, and the\r\nmysterious scientist, whose vagaries had brought us from London, was\r\nstanding before us.  There was certainly no sign of eccentricity either\r\nin his manner or appearance, for he was a portly, large-featured man,\r\ngrave, tall, and frock-coated, with the dignity of bearing which a\r\nlecturer needs.  His eyes were his most remarkable feature, keen,\r\nobservant, and clever to the verge of cunning.\r\n\r\nHe looked at our cards.  \"Pray sit down, gentlemen.  What can I do for\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Holmes smiled amiably.\r\n\r\n\"It was the question which I was about to put to you, Professor.\"\r\n\r\n\"To me, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly there is some mistake.  I heard through a second person that\r\nProfessor Presbury of Camford had need of my services.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed!\"  It seemed to me that there was a malicious sparkle in\r\nthe intense grey eyes.  \"You heard that, did you?  May I ask the name\r\nof your informant?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry, Professor, but the matter was rather confidential.  If I\r\nhave made a mistake there is no harm done.  I can only express my\r\nregret.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.  I should wish to go further into this matter.  It\r\ninterests me.  Have you any scrap of writing, any letter or telegram,\r\nto bear out your assertion?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume that you do not go so far as to assert that I summoned you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather answer no questions,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"No, I dare say not,\" said the Professor, with asperity.  \"However,\r\nthat particular one can be answered very easily without your aid.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked across the room to the bell.  Our London friend, Mr. Bennett,\r\nanswered the call.\r\n\r\n\"Come in, Mr. Bennett.  These two gentlemen have come from London under\r\nthe impression that they have been summoned.  You handle all my\r\ncorrespondence.  Have you a note of anything going to a person named\r\nHolmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" Bennett answered, with a flush.\r\n\r\n\"That is conclusive,\" said the Professor, glaring angrily at my\r\ncompanion.  \"Now, sir\"--he leaned forward with his two hands upon the\r\ntable--\"it seems to me that your position is a very questionable one.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"I can only repeat that I am sorry that we have made a needless\r\nintrusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly enough, Mr. Holmes!\" the old man cried, in a high screaming\r\nvoice, with extraordinary malignancy upon his face.  He got between us\r\nand the door as he spoke, and he shook his two hands at us with furious\r\npassion.  \"You can hardly get out of it so easily as that.\"  His face\r\nwas convulsed and he grinned and gibbered at us in his senseless rage.\r\nI am convinced that we should have had to fight our way out of the room\r\nif Mr. Bennett had not intervened.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Professor,\" he cried, \"consider your position!  Consider the\r\nscandal at the University!  Mr. Holmes is a well-known man.  You cannot\r\npossibly treat him with such discourtesy.\"\r\n\r\nSulkily our host--if I may call him so--cleared the path to the door.\r\nWe were glad to find ourselves outside the house, and in the quiet of\r\nthe tree-lined drive.  Holmes seemed greatly amused by the episode.\r\n\r\n\"Our learned friend's nerves are somewhat out of order,\" said he.\r\n\"Perhaps our intrusion was a little crude, and yet we have gained that\r\npersonal contact which I desired.  But, dear me, Watson, he is surely\r\nat our heels.  The villain still pursues us.\"\r\n\r\nThere were the sounds of running feet behind, but it was, to my relief,\r\nnot the formidable Professor but his assistant who appeared round the\r\ncurve of the drive.  He came panting up to us.\r\n\r\n\"I am so sorry, Mr. Holmes.  I wished to apologize.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir, there is no need.  It is all in the way of professional\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never seen him in a more dangerous mood.  But he grows more\r\nsinister.  You can understand now why his daughter and I are alarmed.\r\nAnd yet his mind is perfectly clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too clear!\" said Holmes.  \"That was my miscalculation.  It is evident\r\nthat his memory is much more reliable than I had thought.  By the way,\r\ncan we, before we go, see the window of Miss Presbury's room?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett pushed his way through some shrubs and we had a view of the\r\nside of the house.\r\n\r\n\"It is there.  The second on the left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, it seems hardly accessible.  And yet you will observe that\r\nthere is a creeper below and a water-pipe above which give some\r\nfoothold.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not climb it myself,\" said Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n\"Very likely.  It would certainly be a dangerous exploit for any normal\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was one other thing I wished to tell you, Mr. Holmes.  I have\r\nthe address of the man in London to whom the Professor writes.  He\r\nseems to have written this morning and I got it from his\r\nblotting-paper.  It is an ignoble position for a trusted secretary, but\r\nwhat else can I do?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes glanced at the paper and put it into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Dorak--a curious name.  Slavonic, I imagine.  Well, it is an important\r\nlink in the chain.  We return to London this afternoon, Mr. Bennett.  I\r\nsee no good purpose to be served by our remaining.  We cannot arrest\r\nthe Professor, because he has done no crime, nor can we place him under\r\nconstraint, for he cannot be proved to be mad.  No action is as yet\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what on earth are we to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little patience, Mr. Bennett.  Things will soon develop.  Unless I\r\nam mistaken next Tuesday may mark a crisis.  Certainly we shall be in\r\nCamford on that day.  Meanwhile, the general position is undeniably\r\nunpleasant, and if Miss Presbury can prolong her visit----\"\r\n\r\n\"That is easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let her stay till we can assure her that all danger is past.\r\nMeanwhile, let him have his way and do not cross him.  So long as he is\r\nin a good humour all is well.\"\r\n\r\n\"There he is!\" said Bennett, in a startled whisper.  Looking between\r\nthe branches we saw the tall, erect figure emerge from the hall door\r\nand look around him.  He stood leaning forward, his hands swinging\r\nstraight before him, his head turning from side to side.  The secretary\r\nwith a last wave slipped off among the trees, and we saw him presently\r\nrejoin his employer, the two entering the house together in what seemed\r\nto be animated and even excited conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I expect the old gentleman has been putting two and two together,\"\r\nsaid Holmes, as we walked hotelwards.  \"He struck me as having a\r\nparticularly clear and logical brain, from the little I saw of him.\r\nExplosive, no doubt, but then from his point of view he has something\r\nto explode about if detectives are put on his track and he suspects his\r\nown household of doing it.  I rather fancy that friend Bennett is in\r\nfor an uncomfortable time.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes stopped at a post office and sent off a telegram on our way.\r\nThe answer reached us in the evening, and he tossed it across to me.\r\n\"Have visited the Commercial Road and seen Dorak.  Suave person,\r\nBohemian, elderly.  Keeps large general store.--Mercer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercer is since your time,\" said Holmes.  \"He is my general utility\r\nman who looks up routine business.  It was important to know something\r\nof the man with whom our Professor was so secretly corresponding.  His\r\nnationality connects up with the Prague visit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank goodness that something connects with something,\" said I.  \"At\r\npresent we seem to be faced by a long series of inexplicable incidents\r\nwith no bearing upon each other.  For example, what possible connection\r\ncan there be between an angry wolf-hound and a visit to Bohemia, or\r\neither of them with a man crawling down a passage at night?  As to your\r\ndates, that is the biggest mystification of all.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes smiled and rubbed his hands.  We were, I may say, seated in the\r\nold sitting-room of the ancient hotel, with a bottle of the famous\r\nvintage of which Holmes had spoken on the table between us.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, let us take the dates first,\" said he, his finger-tips\r\ntogether and his manner as if he were addressing a class.  \"This\r\nexcellent young man's diary shows that there was trouble upon July 2,\r\nand from then onwards it seems to have been at nine-day intervals,\r\nwith, so far as I remember, only one exception.  Thus the last outbreak\r\nupon Friday was on September 3, which also falls into the series, as\r\ndid August 26, which preceded it.  The thing is beyond coincidence.\"\r\n\r\nI was forced to agree.\r\n\r\n\"Let us, then, form the provisional theory that every nine days the\r\nProfessor takes some strong drug which has a passing but highly\r\npoisonous effect.  His naturally violent nature is intensified by it.\r\nHe learned to take this drug while he was in Prague, and is now\r\nsupplied with it by a Bohemian intermediary in London.  This all hangs\r\ntogether, Watson!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the dog, the face at the window, the creeping man in the passage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, we have made a beginning.  I should not expect any fresh\r\ndevelopments until next Tuesday.  In the meantime we can only keep in\r\ntouch with friend Bennett and enjoy the amenities of this charming\r\ntown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning Mr. Bennett slipped round to bring us the latest report.\r\nAs Holmes had imagined, times had not been easy with him.  Without\r\nexactly accusing him of being responsible for our presence, the\r\nProfessor had been very rough and rude in his speech, and evidently\r\nfelt some strong grievance.  This morning he was quite himself again,\r\nhowever, and had delivered his usual brilliant lecture to a crowded\r\nclass.  \"Apart from his queer fits,\" said Bennett, \"he has actually\r\nmore energy and vitality than I can ever remember, nor was his brain\r\never clearer.  But it's not he--it's never the man whom we have known.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you have anything to fear now for a week at least,\"\r\nHolmes answered.  \"I am a busy man, and Dr. Watson has his patients to\r\nattend to.  Let us agree that we meet here at this hour next Tuesday,\r\nand I shall be surprised if before we leave you again we are not able\r\nto explain, even if we cannot perhaps put an end to, your troubles.\r\nMeanwhile, keep us posted in what occurs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw nothing of my friend for the next few days, but on the following\r\nMonday evening I had a short note asking me to meet him next day at the\r\ntrain.  From what he told me as we travelled up to Camford all was\r\nwell, the peace of the Professor's house had been unruffled, and his\r\nown conduct perfectly normal.  This also was the report which was given\r\nus by Mr. Bennett himself when he called upon us that evening at our\r\nold quarters in the \"Chequers.\"  \"He heard from his London\r\ncorrespondent to-day.  There was a letter and there was a small packet,\r\neach with the cross under the stamp which warned me not to touch them.\r\nThere has been nothing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may prove quite enough,\" said Holmes grimly.  \"Now, Mr. Bennett,\r\nwe shall, I think, come to some conclusion to-night.  If my deductions\r\nare correct we should have an opportunity of bringing matters to a\r\nhead.  In order to do so it is necessary to hold the Professor under\r\nobservation.  I would suggest, therefore, that you remain awake and on\r\nthe look out.  Should you hear him pass your door do not interrupt him,\r\nbut follow him as discreetly as you can.  Dr. Watson and I will not be\r\nfar off.  By the way, where is the key of that little box of which you\r\nspoke?\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon his watch-chain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fancy our researches must lie in that direction.  At the worst the\r\nlock should not be very formidable.  Have you any other able-bodied man\r\non the premises?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is the coachman, Macphail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does he sleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Over the stables.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might possibly want him.  Well, we can do no more until we see how\r\nthings develop.  Good-bye--but I expect that we shall see you before\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight before we took our station among some bushes\r\nimmediately opposite the hall door of the Professor.  It was a fine\r\nnight, but chilly, and we were glad of our warm overcoats.  There was a\r\nbreeze, and clouds were scudding across the sky, obscuring from time to\r\ntime the half-moon.  It would have been a dismal vigil were it not for\r\nthe expectation and excitement which carried us along, and the\r\nassurance of my comrade that we had probably reached the end of the\r\nstrange sequence of events which had engaged our attention.\r\n\r\n\"If the cycle of nine days holds good then we shall have the Professor\r\nat his worst to-night,\" said Holmes.  \"The fact that these strange\r\nsymptoms began after his visit to Prague, that he is in secret\r\ncorrespondence with a Bohemian dealer in London, who presumably\r\nrepresents someone in Prague, and that he received a packet from him\r\nthis very day, all point in one direction.  What he takes and why he\r\ntakes it are still beyond our ken, but that it emanates in some way\r\nfrom Prague is clear enough.  He takes it under definite directions\r\nwhich regulate this ninth-day system, which was the first point which\r\nattracted my attention.  But his symptoms are most remarkable.  Did you\r\nobserve his knuckles?\"\r\n\r\nI had to confess that I did not.\r\n\r\n\"Thick and horny in a way which is quite new in my experience.  Always\r\nlook at the hands first, Watson.  Then cuffs, trouser-knees, and boots.\r\nVery curious knuckles which can only be explained by the mode of\r\nprogression observed by----\"  Holmes paused, and suddenly clapped his\r\nhand to his forehead.  \"Oh, Watson, Watson, what a fool I have been!\r\nIt seems incredible, and yet it must be true.  All points in one\r\ndirection.  How could I miss seeing the connection of ideas?  Those\r\nknuckles--how could I have passed those knuckles?  And the dog!  And\r\nthe ivy!  It's surely time that I disappeared into that little farm of\r\nmy dreams.  Look out, Watson!  Here he is!  We shall have the chance of\r\nseeing for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe hall door had slowly opened, and against the lamp-lit background we\r\nsaw the tall figure of Professor Presbury.  He was clad in his\r\ndressing-gown.  As he stood outlined in the doorway he was erect but\r\nleaning forward with dangling arms, as when we saw him last.\r\n\r\nNow he stepped forward into the drive, and an extraordinary change came\r\nover him.  He sank down into a crouching position, and moved along upon\r\nhis hands and feet, skipping every now and then as if he were\r\noverflowing with energy and vitality.  He moved along the face of the\r\nhouse and then round the corner.  As he disappeared Bennett slipped\r\nthrough the hall door and softly followed him.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Watson, come!\" cried Holmes, and we stole as softly as we could\r\nthrough the bushes until we had gained a spot whence we could see the\r\nother side of the house, which was bathed in the light of the\r\nhalf-moon.  The Professor was clearly visible crouching at the foot of\r\nthe ivy-covered wall.  As we watched him he suddenly began with\r\nincredible agility to ascend it.  From branch to branch he sprang, sure\r\nof foot and firm of grasp, climbing apparently in mere joy at his own\r\npowers, with no definite object in view.  With his dressing-gown\r\nflapping on each side of him he looked like some huge bat glued against\r\nthe side of his own house, a great square dark patch upon the moonlit\r\nwall.  Presently he tired of this amusement, and, dropping from branch\r\nto branch, he squatted down into the old attitude and moved towards the\r\nstables, creeping along in the same strange way as before.  The\r\nwolf-hound was out now, barking furiously, and more excited than ever\r\nwhen it actually caught sight of its master.  It was straining on its\r\nchain, and quivering with eagerness and rage.  The Professor squatted\r\ndown very deliberately just out of reach of the hound, and began to\r\nprovoke it in every possible way.  He took handfuls of pebbles from the\r\ndrive and threw them in the dog's face, prodded him with a stick which\r\nhe had picked up, flicked his hands about only a few inches from the\r\ngaping mouth, and endeavoured in every way to increase the animal's\r\nfury, which was already beyond all control.  In all our adventures I do\r\nnot know that I have ever seen a more strange sight than this impassive\r\nand still dignified figure crouching frog-like upon the ground and\r\ngoading to a wilder exhibition of passion the maddened hound, which\r\nramped and raged in front of him, by all manner of ingenious and\r\ncalculated cruelty.\r\n\r\nAnd then in a moment it happened!  It was not the chain that broke, but\r\nit was the collar that slipped, for it had been made for a thick-necked\r\nNewfoundland.  We heard the rattle of falling metal, and the next\r\ninstant dog and man were rolling on the ground together, the one\r\nroaring in rage, the other screaming in a strange shrill falsetto of\r\nterror.  It was a very narrow thing for the Professor's life.  The\r\nsavage creature had him fairly by the throat, its fangs had bitten\r\ndeep, and he was senseless before we could reach them and drag the two\r\napart.  It might have been a dangerous task for us, but Bennett's voice\r\nand presence brought the great wolf-hound instantly to reason.  The\r\nuproar had brought the sleepy and astonished coachman from his room\r\nabove the stables.  \"I'm not surprised,\" said he, shaking his head.\r\n\"I've seen him at it before.  I knew the dog would get him sooner or\r\nlater.\"\r\n\r\nThe hound was secured, and together we carried the Professor up to his\r\nroom, where Bennett, who had a medical degree, helped me to dress his\r\ntorn throat.  The sharp teeth had passed dangerously near the carotid\r\nartery, and the hemorrhage was serious.  In half an hour the danger was\r\npast, I had given the patient an injection of morphia, and he had sunk\r\ninto deep sleep.  Then, and only then, were we able to look at each\r\nother and to take stock of the situation.\r\n\r\n\"I think a first-class surgeon should see him,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, no!\" cried Bennett.  \"At present the scandal is\r\nconfined to our own household.  It is safe with us.  If it gets beyond\r\nthese walls it will never stop.  Consider his position at the\r\nUniversity, his European reputation, the feelings of his daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" said Holmes.  \"I think it may be quite possible to keep the\r\nmatter to ourselves, and also to prevent its recurrence now that we\r\nhave a free hand.  The key from the watch-chain, Mr. Bennett.  Macphail\r\nwill guard the patient and let us know if there is any change.  Let us\r\nsee what we can find in the Professor's mysterious box.\"\r\n\r\nThere was not much, but there was enough--an empty phial, another\r\nnearly full, a hypodermic syringe, several letters in a crabbed,\r\nforeign hand.  The marks on the envelopes showed that they were those\r\nwhich had disturbed the routine of the secretary, and each was dated\r\nfrom the Commercial Road and signed \"A. Dorak.\"  They were mere\r\ninvoices to say that a fresh bottle was being sent to Professor\r\nPresbury, or receipts to acknowledge money.  There was one other\r\nenvelope, however, in a more educated hand and bearing the Austrian\r\nstamp with the postmark of Prague.  \"Here we have our material!\" cried\r\nHolmes, as he tore out the enclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HONOURED COLLEAGUE,\" it ran.  \"Since your esteemed visit I have\r\nthought much of your case, and though in your circumstances there are\r\nsome special reasons for the treatment, I would none the less enjoin\r\ncaution, as my results have shown that it is not without danger of a\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\"It is possible that the Serum of Anthropoid would have been better.  I\r\nhave, as I explained to you, used black-faced Langur because a specimen\r\nwas accessible.  Langur is, of course, a crawler and climber, while\r\nAnthropoid walks erect, and is in all ways nearer.\r\n\r\n\"I beg you to take every possible precaution that there be no premature\r\nrevelation of the process.  I have one other client in England, and\r\nDorak is my agent for both.\r\n\r\n\"Weekly reports will oblige.\r\n\r\n\"Yours with high esteem,\r\n    \"H. LOWENSTEIN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLowenstein!  The name brought back to me the memory of some snippet\r\nfrom a newspaper which spoke of an obscure scientist who was striving\r\nin some unknown way for the secret of rejuvenescence and the elixir of\r\nlife.  Lowenstein of Prague!  Lowenstein with the wondrous\r\nstrength-giving serum, tabooed by the profession because he refused to\r\nreveal its source.  In a few words I said what I remembered.  Bennett\r\nhad taken a manual of Zoology from the shelves.  \"'Langur,'\" he read,\r\n\"'the great black-faced monkey of the Himalayan slopes, biggest and\r\nmost human of climbing monkeys.'  Many details are added.  Well, thanks\r\nto you, Mr. Holmes, it is very clear that we have traced the evil to\r\nits source.\"\r\n\r\n\"The real source,\" said Holmes, \"lies, of course, in that untimely love\r\naffair which gave our impetuous Professor the idea that he could only\r\ngain his wish by turning himself into a younger man.  When one tries to\r\nrise above Nature one is liable to fall below it.  The highest type of\r\nman may revert to the animal if he leaves the straight road of\r\ndestiny.\"  He sat musing for a little with the phial in his hand,\r\nlooking at the clear liquid within.  \"When I have written to this man\r\nand told him that I hold him criminally responsible for the poisons\r\nwhich he circulates, we will have no more trouble.  But it may recur.\r\nOthers may find a better way.  There is danger there--a very real\r\ndanger to humanity.  Consider, Watson, that the material, the sensual,\r\nthe worldly would all prolong their worthless lives.  The spiritual\r\nwould not avoid the call to something higher.  It would be the survival\r\nof the least fit.  What sort of cesspool may not our poor world\r\nbecome?\"  Suddenly the dreamer disappeared, and Holmes, the man of\r\naction, sprang from his chair.  \"I think there is nothing more to be\r\nsaid, Mr. Bennett.  The various incidents will now fit themselves\r\neasily into the general scheme.  The dog, of course, was aware of the\r\nchange far more quickly than you.  His smell would ensure that.  It was\r\nthe monkey, not the Professor, whom Roy attacked, just as it was the\r\nmonkey who teased Roy.  Climbing was a joy to the creature, and it was\r\na mere chance, I take it, that the pastime brought him to the young\r\nlady's window.  There is an early train to town, Watson, but I think we\r\nshall just have time for a cup of tea at the 'Chequers' before we catch\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE LION'S MANE\r\n\r\nIt is a most singular thing that a problem which was certainly as\r\nabstruse and unusual as any which I have faced in my long professional\r\ncareer should have come to me after my retirement; and be brought, as\r\nit were, to my very door.  It occurred after my withdrawal to my little\r\nSussex home, when I had given myself up entirely to that soothing life\r\nof Nature for which I had so often yearned during the long years spent\r\namid the gloom of London.  At this period of my life the good Watson\r\nhad passed almost beyond my ken.  An occasional week-end visit was the\r\nmost that I ever saw of him.  Thus I must act as my own chronicler.\r\nAh! had he but been with me, how much he might have made of so\r\nwonderful a happening and of my eventual triumph against every\r\ndifficulty!  As it is, however, I must needs tell my tale in my own\r\nplain way, showing by my words each step upon the difficult road which\r\nlay before me as I searched for the mystery of the Lion's Mane.\r\n\r\nMy villa is situated upon the southern slope of the Downs, commanding a\r\ngreat view of the Channel.  At this point the coast-line is entirely of\r\nchalk cliffs, which can only be descended by a single, long, tortuous\r\npath, which is steep and slippery.  At the bottom of the path lie a\r\nhundred yards of pebbles and shingle, even when the tide is at full.\r\nHere and there, however, there are curves and hollows which make\r\nsplendid swimming-pools filled afresh with each flow.  This admirable\r\nbeach extends for some miles in each direction, save only at one point\r\nwhere the little cove and village of Fulworth break the line.\r\n\r\nMy house is lonely.  I, my old housekeeper, and my bees have the estate\r\nall to ourselves.  Half a mile off, however, is Harold Stackhurst's\r\nwell-known coaching establishment.  The Gables, quite a large place,\r\nwhich contains some score of young fellows preparing for various\r\nprofessions, with a staff of several masters.  Stackhurst himself was a\r\nwell-known rowing Blue in his day, and an excellent all-round scholar.\r\nHe and I were always friendly from the day I came to the coast, and he\r\nwas the one man who was on such terms with me that we could drop in on\r\neach other in the evenings without an invitation.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of July, 1907, there was a severe gale, the wind\r\nblowing up-Channel, heaping the seas to the base of the cliffs, and\r\nleaving a lagoon at the turn of the tide.  On the morning of which I\r\nspeak the wind had abated, and all Nature was newly washed and fresh.\r\nIt was impossible to work upon so delightful a day, and I strolled out\r\nbefore breakfast to enjoy the exquisite air.  I walked along the cliff\r\npath which led to the steep descent to the beach.  As I walked I heard\r\na shout behind me, and there was Harold Stackhurst waving his hand in\r\ncheery greeting.\r\n\r\n\"What a morning, Mr. Holmes!  I thought I should see you out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Going for a swim, I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"At your old tricks again,\" he laughed, patting his bulging pocket.\r\n\"Yes.  McPherson started early, and I expect I may find him there.\"\r\n\r\nFitzroy McPherson was the science master, a fine upstanding young\r\nfellow whose life had been crippled by heart trouble following\r\nrheumatic fever.  He was a natural athlete, however, and excelled in\r\nevery game which did not throw too great a strain upon him.  Summer and\r\nwinter he went for his swim, and, as I am a swimmer myself, I have\r\noften joined him.\r\n\r\nAt this moment we saw the man himself.  His head showed above the edge\r\nof the cliff where the path ends.  Then his whole figure appeared at\r\nthe top, staggering like a drunken man.  The next instant he threw up\r\nhis hands, and, with a terrible cry, fell upon his face.  Stackhurst\r\nand I rushed forward--it may have been fifty yards--and turned him on\r\nhis back.  He was obviously dying.  Those glazed sunken eyes and\r\ndreadful livid cheeks could mean nothing else.  One glimmer of life\r\ncame into his face for an instant, and he uttered two or three words\r\nwith an eager air of warning.  They were slurred and indistinct, but to\r\nmy ear the last of them, which burst in a shriek from his lips, were\r\n\"the lion's mane.\"  It was utterly irrelevant and unintelligible, and\r\nyet I could twist the sound into no other sense.  Then he half raised\r\nhimself from the ground, threw his arms into the air and fell forward\r\non his side.  He was dead.\r\n\r\nMy companion was paralysed by the sudden horror of it, but I, as may\r\nwell be imagined, had every sense on the alert.  And I had need, for it\r\nwas speedily evident that we were in the presence of an extraordinary\r\ncase.  The man was dressed only in his Burberry overcoat, his trousers,\r\nand an unlaced pair of canvas shoes.  As he fell over, his Burberry,\r\nwhich had been simply thrown round his shoulders, slipped off, exposing\r\nhis trunk.  We stared at it in amazement.  His back was covered with\r\ndark red lines as though he had been terribly flogged by a thin wire\r\nscourge.  The instrument with which this punishment had been inflicted\r\nwas clearly flexible, for the long, angry weals curved round his\r\nshoulders and ribs.  There was blood dripping down his chin, for he had\r\nbitten through his lower lip in the paroxysm of his agony.  His drawn\r\nand distorted face told how terrible that agony had been.\r\n\r\nI was kneeling and Stackhurst standing by the body when a shadow fell\r\nacross us, and we found that Ian Murdoch was by our side.  Murdoch was\r\nthe mathematical coach at the establishment, a tall, dark, thin man, so\r\ntaciturn and aloof that none can be said to have been his friend.  He\r\nseemed to live in some high, abstract region of surds and conic\r\nsections with little to connect him with ordinary life.  He was looked\r\nupon as an oddity by the students, and would have been their butt, but\r\nthere was some strange outlandish blood in the man, which showed itself\r\nnot only in his coal-black eyes and swarthy face, but also in\r\noccasional outbreaks of temper, which could only be described as\r\nferocious.  On one occasion, being plagued by a little dog belonging to\r\nMcPherson, he had caught the creature up and hurled it through the\r\nplate-glass window, an action for which Stackhurst would certainly have\r\ngiven him his dismissal had he not been a very valuable teacher.  Such\r\nwas the strange, complex man who now appeared beside us.  He seemed to\r\nbe honestly shocked at the sight before him, though the incident of the\r\ndog may show that there was no great sympathy between the dead man and\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Poor fellow!  Poor fellow!  What can I do?  How can I help?\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you with him?  Can you tell us what has happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, I was late this morning.  I was not on the beach at all.  I\r\nhave come straight from The Gables.  What can I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can hurry to the police-station at Fulworth.  Report the matter at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\nWithout a word he made off at top speed, and I proceeded to take the\r\nmatter in hand, while Stackhurst, dazed at this tragedy, remained by\r\nthe body.  My first task naturally was to note who was on the beach.\r\nFrom the top of the path I could see the whole sweep of it, and it was\r\nabsolutely deserted save that two or three dark figures could be seen\r\nfar away moving towards the village of Fulworth.  Having satisfied\r\nmyself upon this point, I walked slowly down the path.  There was clay\r\nor soft marl mixed with the chalk, and every here and there I saw the\r\nsame footstep, both ascending and descending.  No one else had gone\r\ndown to the beach by this track that morning.  At one place I observed\r\nthe print of an open hand with the fingers towards the incline.  This\r\ncould only mean that poor McPherson had fallen as he ascended.  There\r\nwere rounded depressions, too, which suggested that he had come down\r\nupon his knees more than once.  At the bottom of the path was the\r\nconsiderable lagoon left by the retreating tide.  At the side of it\r\nMcPherson had undressed, for there lay his towel on a rock.  It was\r\nfolded and dry, so that it would seem that after all he had never\r\nentered the water.  Once or twice as I hunted round amid the hard\r\nshingle I came on little patches of sand where the print of his canvas\r\nshoe, and also of his naked foot, could be seen.  The latter fact\r\nproved that he had made all ready to bathe, though the towel indicated\r\nthat he had not actually done so.\r\n\r\nAnd here was the problem clearly defined--as strange a one as had ever\r\nconfronted me.  The man had not been on the beach more than a quarter\r\nof an hour at the most.  Stackhurst had followed him from The Gables,\r\nso there could be no doubt about that.  He had gone to bathe and had\r\nstripped, as the naked footsteps showed.  Then he had suddenly huddled\r\non his clothes again--they were all dishevelled and unfastened--and he\r\nhad returned without bathing, or at any rate without drying himself.\r\nAnd the reason for his change of purpose had been that he had been\r\nscourged in some savage, inhuman fashion, tortured until he bit his lip\r\nthrough in his agony, and was left with only strength enough to crawl\r\naway and to die.  Who had done this barbarous deed?  There were, it is\r\ntrue, small grottos and caves in the base of the cliffs, but the low\r\nsun shone directly into them, and there was no place for concealment.\r\nThen, again, there were those distant figures on the beach.  They\r\nseemed too far away to have been connected with the crime, and the\r\nbroad lagoon in which McPherson had intended to bathe lay between him\r\nand them, lapping up to the rocks.  On the sea two or three\r\nfishing-boats were at no great distance.  Their occupants might be\r\nexamined at our leisure.  There were several roads for inquiry, but\r\nnone which led to any very obvious goal.\r\n\r\nWhen I at last returned to the body I found that a little group of\r\nwandering folk had gathered round it.  Stackhurst was, of course, still\r\nthere, and Ian Murdoch had just arrived with Anderson, the village\r\nconstable, a big, ginger-moustached man of the slow, solid Sussex\r\nbreed--a breed which covers much good sense under a heavy, silent\r\nexterior.  He listened to everything, took note of all we said, and\r\nfinally drew me aside.\r\n\r\n\"I'd be glad of your advice, Mr. Holmes.  This is a big thing for me to\r\nhandle, and I'll hear of it from Lewes if I go wrong.\"\r\n\r\nI advised him to send for his immediate superior, and for a doctor;\r\nalso to allow nothing to be moved, and as few fresh footmarks as\r\npossible to be made, until they came.  In the meantime I searched the\r\ndead man's pockets.  There were his handkerchief, a large knife, and a\r\nsmall folding card-case.  From this projected a slip of paper, which I\r\nunfolded and handed to the constable.  There was written on it in a\r\nscrawling, feminine hand: \"I will be there, you may be sure.--Maudie.\"\r\nIt read like a love affair, an assignation, though when and where were\r\na blank.  The constable replaced it in the card-case and returned it\r\nwith the other things to the pockets of the Burberry.  Then, as nothing\r\nmore suggested itself, I walked back to my house for breakfast, having\r\nfirst arranged that the base of the cliffs should be thoroughly\r\nsearched.\r\n\r\n\r\nStackhurst was round in an hour or two to tell me that the body had\r\nbeen removed to The Gables, where the inquest would be held.  He\r\nbrought with him some serious and definite news.  As I expected,\r\nnothing had been found in the small caves below the cliff, but he had\r\nexamined the papers in McPherson's desk, and there were several which\r\nshowed an intimate correspondence with a certain Miss Maud Bellamy, of\r\nFulworth.  We had then established the identity of the writer of the\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n\"The police have the letters,\" he explained.  \"I could not bring them.\r\nBut there is no doubt that it was a serious love affair.  I see no\r\nreason, however, to connect it with that horrible happening save,\r\nindeed, that the lady had made an appointment with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But hardly at a bathing-pool which all of you were in the habit of\r\nusing,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"It is mere chance,\" said he, \"that several of the students were not\r\nwith McPherson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it mere chance?\"\r\n\r\nStackhurst knit his brows in thought.\r\n\r\n\"Ian Murdoch held them back,\" said he; \"he would insist upon some\r\nalgebraic demonstration before breakfast.  Poor chap, he is dreadfully\r\ncut up about it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet I gather that they were not friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"At one time they were not.  But for a year or more Murdoch has been as\r\nnear to McPherson as he ever could be to anyone.  He is not of a very\r\nsympathetic disposition by nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I understand.  I seem to remember your telling me once about a\r\nquarrel over the ill-usage of a dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"That blew over all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"But left some vindictive feeling, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; I am sure they were real friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, we must explore the matter of the girl.  Do you know her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everyone knows her.  She is the beauty of the neighbourhood--a real\r\nbeauty, Holmes, who would draw attention everywhere.  I knew that\r\nMcPherson was attracted by her, but I had no notion that it had gone so\r\nfar as these letters would seem to indicate.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is the daughter of old Tom Bellamy, who owns all the boats and\r\nbathing-cots at Fulworth.  He was a fisherman to start with, but is now\r\na man of some substance.  He and his son William run the business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we walk into Fulworth and see them?\"\r\n\r\n\"On what pretext?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we can easily find a pretext.  After all, this poor man did not\r\nill-use himself in this outrageous way.  Some human hand was on the\r\nhandle of that scourge, if indeed it was a scourge which inflicted the\r\ninjuries.  His circle of acquaintances in this lonely place was surely\r\nlimited.  Let us follow it up in every direction and we can hardly fail\r\nto come upon the motive, which in turn should lead us to the criminal.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been a pleasant walk across the thyme-scented Downs had\r\nour minds not been poisoned by the tragedy we had witnessed.  The\r\nvillage of Fulworth lies in a hollow curving in a semicircle round the\r\nbay.  Behind the old-fashioned hamlet several modern houses have been\r\nbuilt upon the rising ground.  It was to one of these that Stackhurst\r\nguided me.\r\n\r\n\"That's The Haven, as Bellamy called it.  The one with the corner tower\r\nand slate roof.  Not bad for a man who started with nothing but----  By\r\nJove, look at that!\"\r\n\r\nThe garden gate of The Haven had opened and a man had emerged.  There\r\nwas no mistaking that tall, angular, straggling figure.  It was Ian\r\nMurdoch, the mathematician.  A moment later we confronted him upon the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\" said Stackhurst.  The man nodded, gave us a sideways glance\r\nfrom his curious dark eyes, and would have passed us, but his principal\r\npulled him up.\r\n\r\n\"What were you doing there?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nMurdoch's face flushed with anger.  \"I am your subordinate, sir, under\r\nyour roof.  I am not aware that I owe you any account of my private\r\nactions.\"\r\n\r\nStackhurst's nerves were near the surface after all he had endured.\r\nOtherwise, perhaps, he would have waited.  Now he lost his temper\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n\"In the circumstances your answer is pure impertinence, Mr. Murdoch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your own question might perhaps come under the same heading.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is not the first time that I have had to overlook your\r\ninsubordinate ways.  It will certainly be the last.  You will kindly\r\nmake fresh arrangements for your future as speedily as you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had intended to do so.  I have lost to-day the only person who made\r\nThe Gables habitable.\"\r\n\r\nHe strode off upon his way, while Stackhurst, with angry eyes, stood\r\nglaring after him.  \"Is he not an impossible, intolerable man?\" he\r\ncried.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that impressed itself forcibly upon my mind was that Mr.\r\nIan Murdoch was taking the first chance to open a path of escape from\r\nthe scene of the crime.  Suspicion, vague and nebulous, was now\r\nbeginning to take outline in my mind.  Perhaps the visit to the\r\nBellamys might throw some further light upon the matter.  Stackhurst\r\npulled himself together and we went forward to the house.\r\n\r\nMr. Bellamy proved to be a middle-aged man with a flaming red beard.\r\nHe seemed to be in a very angry mood, and his face was soon as florid\r\nas his hair.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I do not desire any particulars.  My son here\"--indicating a\r\npowerful young man, with a heavy, sullen face, in the corner of the\r\nsitting-room--\"is of one mind with me that Mr. McPherson's attentions\r\nto Maud were insulting.  Yes, sir, the word 'marriage' was never\r\nmentioned, and yet there were letters and meetings, and a great deal\r\nmore of which neither of us could approve.  She has no mother, and we\r\nare her only guardians.  We are determined----\"\r\n\r\nBut the words were taken from his mouth by the appearance of the lady\r\nherself.  There was no gainsaying that she would have graced any\r\nassembly in the world.  Who could have imagined that so rare a flower\r\nwould grow from such a root and in such an atmosphere?  Women have\r\nseldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my\r\nheart, but I could not look upon her perfect clear-cut face, with all\r\nthe soft freshness of the Downlands in her delicate colouring, without\r\nrealizing that no young man would cross her path unscathed.  Such was\r\nthe girl who had pushed open the door and stood now, wide-eyed and\r\nintense, in front of Harold Stackhurst.\r\n\r\n\"I know already that Fitzroy is dead,\" she said.  \"Do not be afraid to\r\ntell me the particulars.\"\r\n\r\n\"This other gentleman of yours let us know the news,\" explained the\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\"There is no reason why my sister should be brought into the matter,\"\r\ngrowled the younger man.  The sister turned a sharp, fierce look upon\r\nhim.  \"This is my business, William.  Kindly leave me to manage it in\r\nmy own way.  By all accounts there has been a crime committed.  If I\r\ncan help to show who did it, it is the least I can do for him who is\r\ngone.\"\r\n\r\nShe listened to a short account from my companion, with a composed\r\nconcentration which showed me that she possessed strong character as\r\nwell as great beauty.  Maud Bellamy will always remain in my memory as\r\na most complete and remarkable woman.  It seems that she already knew\r\nme by sight, for she turned to me at the end.\r\n\r\n\"Bring them to justice, Mr. Holmes.  You have my sympathy and my help,\r\nwhoever they may be.\"  It seemed to me that she glanced defiantly at\r\nher father and brother as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said I.  \"I value a woman's instinct in such matters.  You\r\nuse the word 'they.'  You think that more than one was concerned?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew Mr. McPherson well enough to be aware that he was a brave and a\r\nstrong man.  No single person could ever have inflicted such an outrage\r\nupon him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might I have one word with you alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, Maud, not to mix yourself up in the matter,\" cried her\r\nfather angrily.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me helplessly.  \"What can I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole world will know the facts presently, so there can be no harm\r\nif I discuss them here,\" said I.  \"I should have preferred privacy, but\r\nif your father will not allow it, he must share the deliberations.\"\r\nThen I spoke of the note which had been found in the dead man's pocket.\r\n\"It is sure to be produced at the inquest.  May I ask you to throw any\r\nlight upon it that you can?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no reason for mystery,\" she answered.  \"We were engaged to be\r\nmarried, and we only kept it secret because Fitzroy's uncle, who is\r\nvery old and said to be dying, might have disinherited him if he had\r\nmarried against his wish.  There was no other reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could have told us,\" growled Mr. Bellamy.\r\n\r\n\"So I would, father, if you had ever shown sympathy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I object to my girl picking up with men outside her own station.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was your prejudice against him which prevented us from telling you.\r\nAs to this appointment\"--she fumbled in her dress and produced a\r\ncrumpled note--\"it was in answer to this.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DEAREST,\" ran the message: \"The old place on the beach just after\r\nsunset on Tuesday.  It is the only time I can get away.--F.M.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday was to-day, and I had meant to meet him to-night.\"\r\n\r\nI turned over the paper.  \"This never came by post.  How did you get\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather not answer that question.  It has really nothing to do\r\nwith the matter which you are investigating.  But anything which bears\r\nupon that I will most freely answer.\"\r\n\r\nShe was as good as her word, but there was nothing which was helpful in\r\nour investigation.  She had no reason to think that her fiancé had any\r\nhidden enemy, but she admitted that she had had several warm admirers.\r\n\r\n\"May I ask if Mr. Ian Murdoch was one of them?\"\r\n\r\nShe blushed and seemed confused.\r\n\r\n\"There was a time when I thought he was.  But that was all changed when\r\nhe understood the relations between Fitzroy and myself.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the shadow round this strange man seemed to me to be taking more\r\ndefinite shape.  His record must be examined.  His rooms must be\r\nprivately searched.  Stackhurst was a willing collaborator, for in his\r\nmind also suspicions were forming.  We returned from our visit to The\r\nHaven with the hope that one free end of this tangled skein was already\r\nin our hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nA week passed.  The inquest had thrown no light upon the matter and had\r\nbeen adjourned for further evidence.  Stackhurst had made discreet\r\ninquiry about his subordinate, and there had been a superficial search\r\nof his room, but without result.  Personally, I had gone over the whole\r\nground again, both physically and mentally, but with no new\r\nconclusions.  In all my chronicles the reader will find no case which\r\nbrought me so completely to the limit of my powers.  Even my\r\nimagination could conceive no solution to the mystery.  And then there\r\ncame the incident of the dog.\r\n\r\nIt was my old housekeeper who heard of it first by that strange\r\nwireless by which such people collect the news of the country-side.\r\n\r\n\"Sad story this, sir, about Mr. McPherson's dog,\" said she one evening.\r\n\r\nI do not encourage such conversations, but the words arrested my\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\"What of Mr. McPherson's dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead, sir.  Died of grief for its master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir, everyone is talking of it.  It took on terrible, and has\r\neaten nothing for a week.  Then to-day two of the young gentlemen from\r\nThe Gables found it dead--down on the beach, sir, at the very place\r\nwhere its master met his end.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the very place.\"  The words stood out clear in my memory.  Some dim\r\nperception that the matter was vital rose in my mind.  That the dog\r\nshould die was after the beautiful, faithful nature of dogs.  But 'in\r\nthe very place'!  Why should this lonely beach be fatal to it?  Was it\r\npossible that it also, had been sacrificed to some revengeful feud?\r\nWas it possible----?  Yes, the perception was dim, but already\r\nsomething was building up in my mind.  In a few minutes I was on my way\r\nto The Gables, where I found Stackhurst in his study.  At my request he\r\nsent for Sudbury and Blount, the two students who had found the dog.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it lay on the very edge of the pool,\" said one of them.  \"It must\r\nhave followed the trail of its dead master.\"\r\n\r\nI saw the faithful little creature, an Airedale terrier, laid out upon\r\nthe mat in the hall.  The body was stiff and rigid, the eyes\r\nprojecting, and the limbs contorted.  There was agony in every line of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFrom The Gables I walked down to the bathing-pool.  The sun had sunk\r\nand the shadow of the great cliff lay black across the water, which\r\nglimmered dully like a sheet of lead. The place was deserted and there\r\nwas no sign of life save for two sea-birds circling and screaming\r\noverhead.  In the fading light I could dimly make out the little dog's\r\nspoor upon the sand round the very rock on which his master's towel had\r\nbeen laid.  For a long time I stood in deep meditation while the\r\nshadows grew darker around me.  My mind was filled with racing\r\nthoughts.  You have known what it was to be in a nightmare in which you\r\nfeel that there is some all-important thing for which you search and\r\nwhich you know is there, though it remains for ever just beyond your\r\nreach.  That was how I felt that evening as I stood alone by that place\r\nof death.  Then at last I turned and walked slowly homewards.  I had\r\njust reached the top of the path when it came to me.  Like a flash, I\r\nremembered the thing for which I had so eagerly and vainly grasped.\r\nYou will know, or Watson has written in vain, that I hold a vast store\r\nof out-of-the-way knowledge, without scientific system, but very\r\navailable for the needs of my work.  My mind is like a crowded box-room\r\nwith packets of all sorts stowed away therein--so many that I may well\r\nhave but a vague perception of what was there.  I had known that there\r\nwas something which might bear upon this matter.  It was still vague,\r\nbut at least I knew how I could make it clear.  It was monstrous,\r\nincredible, and yet it was always a possibility.  I would test it to\r\nthe full.  There is a great garret in my little house which is stuffed\r\nwith books.  It was into this that I plunged and rummaged for an hour.\r\nAt the end of that time I emerged with a little chocolate and silver\r\nvolume.  Eagerly I turned up the chapter of which I had a dim\r\nremembrance.  Yes, it was indeed a far-fetched and unlikely\r\nproposition, and yet I could not be at rest until I had made sure if it\r\nmight, indeed, be so.  It was late when I retired, with my mind eagerly\r\nawaiting the work of the morrow.\r\n\r\nBut that work met with an annoying interruption.  I had hardly\r\nswallowed my early cup of tea and was starting for the beach when I had\r\na call from Inspector Bardie of the Sussex Constabulary--a steady,\r\nsolid, bovine man with thoughtful eyes, which looked at me now with a\r\nvery troubled expression.\r\n\r\n\"I know your immense experience, sir,\" said he.  \"This is quite\r\nunofficial, of course, and need go no farther.  But I am fairly up\r\nagainst it in this McPherson case.  The question is, shall I make an\r\narrest, or shall I not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Meaning Mr. Ian Murdoch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.  There is really no one else when you come to think of it.\r\nThat's the advantage of this solitude.  We narrow it down to a very\r\nsmall compass.  If he did not do it, then who did?\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you against him?\"\r\n\r\nHe had gleaned along the same furrows as I had.  There was Murdoch's\r\ncharacter and the mystery which seemed to hang round the man.  His\r\nfurious bursts of temper, as shown in the incident of the dog.  The\r\nfact that he had quarrelled with McPherson in the past, and that there\r\nwas some reason to think that he might have resented his attentions to\r\nMiss Bellamy.  He had all my points, but no fresh ones, save that\r\nMurdoch seemed to be making every preparation for departure.\r\n\r\n\"What would my position be if I let him slip away with all this\r\nevidence against him?\"  The burly, phlegmatic man was sorely troubled\r\nin his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Consider,\" I said, \"all the essential gaps in your case.  On the\r\nmorning of the crime he can surely prove an alibi.  He had been with\r\nhis scholars till the last moment, and within a few minutes of\r\nMcPherson's appearance he came upon us from behind.  Then bear in mind\r\nthe absolute impossibility that he could single-handed have inflicted\r\nthis outrage upon a man quite as strong as himself.  Finally, there is\r\nthis question of the instrument with which these injuries were\r\ninflicted.\"\r\n\r\n\"What could it be but a scourge or flexible whip of some sort?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you examined the marks?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen them.  So has the doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have examined them very carefully with a lens.  They have\r\npeculiarities.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\nI stepped to my bureau and brought out an enlarged photograph.  \"This\r\nis my method in such cases,\" I explained.\r\n\r\n\"You certainly do things thoroughly, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should hardly be what I am if I did not.  Now let us consider this\r\nweal which extends round the right shoulder.  Do you observe nothing\r\nremarkable?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely it is evident that it is unequal in its intensity.  There is a\r\ndot of extravasated blood, here, and another there.  There are similar\r\nindications in this other weal down here.  What can that mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no idea.  Have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I have.  Perhaps I haven't.  I may be able to say more soon.\r\nAnything which will define what made that mark will bring us a long way\r\ntowards the criminal.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, of course, an absurd idea,\" said the policeman, \"but if a\r\nred-hot net of wire had been laid across the back, then these\r\nbetter-marked points would represent where the meshes crossed each\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\n\"A most ingenious comparison.  Or shall we say a very stiff\r\ncat-o'-nine-tails with small hard knots upon it?\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, Mr. Holmes, I think you have hit it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or there may be some very different cause, Mr. Bardie.  But your case\r\nis far too weak for an arrest.  Besides, we have those last\r\nwords--'Lion's Mane.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I have wondered whether Ian----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have considered that.  If the second word had borne any\r\nresemblance to Murdoch--but it did not.  He gave it almost in a shriek.\r\nI am sure that it was 'Mane.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you no alternative, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I have.  But I do not care to discuss it until there is\r\nsomething more solid to discuss.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when will that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"In an hour--possibly less.\"\r\n\r\nThe Inspector rubbed his chin and looked at me with dubious eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could see what was in your mind, Mr. Holmes.  Perhaps it's\r\nthose fishing-boats.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; they were too far out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, is it Bellamy and that big son of his?  They were not too\r\nsweet upon Mr. McPherson.  Could they have done him a mischief?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; you won't draw me until I am ready,\" said I with a smile.\r\n\"Now, Inspector, we each have our own work to do.  Perhaps if you were\r\nto meet me here at midday----?\"\r\n\r\nSo far we had got when there came the tremendous interruption which was\r\nthe beginning of the end.  My outer door was flung open, there were\r\nblundering footsteps in the passage, and Ian Murdoch staggered into the\r\nroom, pallid, dishevelled, his clothes in wild disorder, clawing with\r\nhis bony hands at the furniture to hold himself erect.  \"Brandy!\r\nBrandy!\" he gasped, and fell groaning upon the sofa.\r\n\r\nHe was not alone.  Behind him came Stackhurst, hatless and panting,\r\nalmost as distrait as his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, brandy!\" he cried.  \"The man is at his last gasp.  It was\r\nall I could do to bring him here.  He fainted twice upon the way.\"\r\n\r\nHalf a tumbler of the raw spirit brought about a wondrous change.  He\r\npushed himself up on one arm and swung his coat from off his shoulders.\r\n\"For God's sake! oil, opium, morphia!\" he cried.  \"Anything to ease\r\nthis infernal agony!\"\r\n\r\nThe Inspector and I cried out at the sight.  There, criss-crossed upon\r\nthe man's naked shoulder, was the same strange reticulated pattern of\r\nred, inflamed lines which had been the death-mark of Fitzroy McPherson.\r\n\r\nThe pain was evidently terrible and was more than local, for the\r\nsufferer's breathing would stop for a time, his face would turn black,\r\nand then with loud gasps he would clap his hand to his heart, while his\r\nbrow dropped beads of sweat.  At any moment he might die.  More and\r\nmore brandy was poured down his throat, each fresh dose bringing him\r\nback to life.  Pads of cotton-wool soaked in salad-oil seemed to take\r\nthe agony from the strange wounds.  At last his head fell heavily upon\r\nthe cushion.  Exhausted Nature had taken refuge in its last storehouse\r\nof vitality.  It was half a sleep and half a faint, but at least it was\r\nease from pain.\r\n\r\nTo question him had been impossible, but the moment we were assured of\r\nhis condition Stackhurst turned upon me.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" he cried, \"what is it, Holmes?  What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you find him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Down on the beach.  Exactly where poor McPherson met his end.  If this\r\nman's heart had been weak as McPherson's was, he would not be here now.\r\nMore than once I thought he was gone as I brought him up.  It was too\r\nfar to The Gables, so I made for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see him on the beach?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was walking on the cliff when I heard his cry.  He was at the edge\r\nof the water, reeling about like a drunken man.  I ran down, threw some\r\nclothes about him, and brought him up.  For Heaven's sake, Holmes, use\r\nall the powers you have and spare no pains to lift the curse from this\r\nplace, for life is becoming unendurable.  Can you, with all your\r\nworld-wide reputation, do nothing for us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I can, Stackhurst.  Come with me now!  And you, Inspector,\r\ncome along!  We will see if we cannot deliver this murderer into your\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving the unconscious man in the charge of my housekeeper, we all\r\nthree went down to the deadly lagoon.  On the shingle there was piled a\r\nlittle heap of towels and clothes, left by the stricken man.  Slowly I\r\nwalked round the edge of the water, my comrades in Indian file behind\r\nme.  Most of the pool was quite shallow, but under the cliff where the\r\nbeach was hollowed out it was four or five feet deep.  It was to this\r\npart that a swimmer would naturally go, for it formed a beautiful\r\npellucid green pool as clear as crystal.  A line of rocks lay above it\r\nat the base of the cliff, and along this I led the way, peering eagerly\r\ninto the depths beneath me.  I had reached the deepest and stillest\r\npool when my eyes caught that for which they were searching, and I\r\nburst into a shout of triumph.\r\n\r\n\"Cyanea!\" I cried.  \"Cyanea!  Behold the Lion's Mane!\"\r\n\r\nThe strange object at which I pointed did indeed look like a tangled\r\nmass torn from the mane of a lion.  It lay upon a rocky shelf some\r\nthree feet under the water, a curious waving, vibrating, hairy creature\r\nwith streaks of silver among its yellow tresses.  It pulsated with a\r\nslow, heavy dilation and contraction.\r\n\r\n\"It has done mischief enough.  Its day is over!\" I cried.  \"Help me,\r\nStackhurst!  Let us end the murderer for ever.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a big boulder just above the ledge, and we pushed it until it\r\nfell with a tremendous splash into the water.  When the ripples had\r\ncleared we saw that it had settled upon the ledge below.  One flapping\r\nedge of yellow membrane showed that our victim was beneath it.  A thick\r\noily scum oozed out from below the stone and stained the water round,\r\nrising slowly to the surface.\r\n\r\n\"Well, this gets me!\" cried the Inspector.  \"What was it, Mr. Holmes?\r\nI'm born and bred in these parts, but I never saw such a thing.  It\r\ndon't belong to Sussex.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as well for Sussex,\" I remarked.  \"It may have been the\r\nsouth-west gale that brought it up.  Come back to my house, both of\r\nyou, and I will give you the terrible experience of one who has good\r\nreason to remember his own meeting with the same peril of the seas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we reached my study, we found that Murdoch was so far recovered\r\nthat he could sit up.  He was dazed in mind, and every now and then was\r\nshaken by a paroxysm of pain.  In broken words he explained that he had\r\nno notion what had occurred to him, save that terrific pangs had\r\nsuddenly shot through him, and that it had taken all his fortitude to\r\nreach the bank.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a book,\" I said, taking up the little volume, \"which first\r\nbrought light into what might have been for ever dark.  It is _Out of\r\nDoors_, by the famous observer J. G. Wood.  Wood himself very nearly\r\nperished from contact with this vile creature, so he wrote with a very\r\nfull knowledge.  _Cyanea Capillata_ is the miscreant's full name, and\r\nhe can be as dangerous to life as, and far more painful than, the bite\r\nof the cobra.  Let me briefly give this extract.\r\n\r\n\"'If the bather should see a loose roundish mass of tawny membranes and\r\nfibres, something like very large handfuls of lion's mane and silver\r\npaper, let him beware, for this is the fearful stinger, _Cyanea\r\nCapillata_.' Could our sinister acquaintance be more clearly described?\r\n\r\n\"He goes on to tell his own encounter with one when swimming off the\r\ncoast of Kent.  He found that the creature radiated almost invisible\r\nfilaments to the distance of fifty feet, and that anyone within that\r\ncircumference from the deadly centre was in danger of death.  Even at a\r\ndistance the effect upon Wood was almost fatal.  'The multitudinous\r\nthreads caused light scarlet lines upon the skin which on closer\r\nexamination resolved into minute dots or pustules, each dot charged as\r\nit were with a red-hot needle making its way through the nerves.'\r\n\r\n\"The local pain was, as he explains, the least part of the exquisite\r\ntorment.  'Pangs shot through the chest, causing me to fall as if\r\nstruck by a bullet.  The pulsation would cease, and then the heart\r\nwould give six or seven leaps as if it would force its way through the\r\nchest.'\r\n\r\n\"It nearly killed him, although he had only been exposed to it in the\r\ndisturbed ocean and not in the narrow calm waters of a bathing-pool.\r\nHe says that he could hardly recognize himself afterwards, so white,\r\nwrinkled and shrivelled was his face.  He gulped down brandy, a whole\r\nbottleful, and it seems to have saved his life.  There is the book,\r\nInspector.  I leave it with you, and you cannot doubt that it contains\r\na full explanation of the tragedy of poor McPherson.\"\r\n\r\n\"And incidentally exonerates me,\" remarked Ian Murdoch with a wry\r\nsmile.  \"I do not blame you, Inspector, nor you, Mr. Holmes, for your\r\nsuspicions were natural.  I feel that on the very eve of my arrest I\r\nhave only cleared myself by sharing the fate of my poor friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mr. Murdoch.  I was already upon the track, and had I been out as\r\nearly as I intended I might well have saved you from this terrific\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did you know, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for\r\ntrifles.  That phrase 'Lion's Mane' haunted my mind.  I knew that I had\r\nseen it somewhere in an unexpected context.  You have seen that it does\r\ndescribe the creature.  I have no doubt that it was floating on the\r\nwater when McPherson saw it, and that this phrase was the only one by\r\nwhich he could convey to us a warning as to the creature which had been\r\nhis death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I, at least, am cleared,\" said Murdoch, rising slowly to his\r\nfeet.  \"There are one or two words of explanation which I should give,\r\nfor I know the direction in which your inquiries have run.  It is true\r\nthat I loved this lady, but from the day when she chose my friend\r\nMcPherson my one desire was to help her to happiness.  I was well\r\ncontent to stand aside and act as their go-between.  Often I carried\r\ntheir messages, and it was because I was in their confidence and\r\nbecause she was so dear to me that I hastened to tell her of my\r\nfriend's death, lest someone should forestall me in a more sudden and\r\nheartless manner.  She would not tell you, sir, of our relations lest\r\nyou should disapprove and I might suffer.  But with your leave I must\r\ntry to get back to The Gables, for my bed will be very welcome.\"\r\n\r\nStackhurst held out his hand.  \"Our nerves have all been at\r\nconcert-pitch,\" said he.  \"Forgive what is past, Murdoch.  We shall\r\nunderstand each other better in the future.\"  They passed out together\r\nwith their arms linked in friendly fashion.  The Inspector remained,\r\nstaring at me in silence with his ox-like eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've done it!\" he cried at last.  \"I had read of you, but I\r\nnever believed it.  It's wonderful!\"\r\n\r\nI was forced to shake my head.  To accept such praise was to lower\r\none's own standards.\r\n\r\n\"I was slow at the outset--culpably slow.  Had the body been found in\r\nthe water I could hardly have missed it.  It was the towel which misled\r\nme.  The poor fellow had never thought to dry himself, and so I in turn\r\nwas led to believe that he had never been in the water.  Why, then,\r\nshould the attack of any water creature suggest itself to me?  That was\r\nwhere I went astray.  Well, well, Inspector, I often ventured to chaff\r\nyou gentlemen of the police force, but _Cyanea Capillata_ very nearly\r\navenged Scotland Yard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE VEILED LODGER\r\n\r\nWhen one considers that Mr. Sherlock Holmes was in active practice for\r\ntwenty-three years, and that during seventeen of these I was allowed to\r\nco-operate with him and to keep notes of his doings, it will be clear\r\nthat I have a mass of material at my command.  The problem has always\r\nbeen, not to find, but to choose.  There is the long row of year-books\r\nwhich fill a shelf, and there are the dispatch-cases filled with\r\ndocuments, a perfect quarry for the student, not only of crime, but of\r\nthe social and official scandals of the late Victorian era.  Concerning\r\nthese latter, I may say that the writers of agonized letters, who beg\r\nthat the honour of their families or the reputation of famous forbears\r\nmay not be touched, have nothing to fear.  The discretion and high\r\nsense of professional honour which have always distinguished my friend\r\nare still at work in the choice of these memoirs, and no confidence\r\nwill be abused.  I deprecate, however, in the strongest way the\r\nattempts which have been made lately to get at and to destroy these\r\npapers.  The source of these outrages is known, and if they are\r\nrepeated I have Mr. Holmes's authority for saying that the whole story\r\nconcerning the politician, the lighthouse and the trained cormorant\r\nwill be given to the public.  There is at least one reader who will\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nIt is not reasonable to suppose that every one of these cases gave\r\nHolmes the opportunity of showing those curious gifts of instinct and\r\nobservation which I have endeavoured to set forth in these memoirs.\r\nSometimes he had with much effort to pick the fruit, sometimes it fell\r\neasily into his lap.  But the most terrible human tragedies were often\r\ninvolved in these cases which brought him the fewest personal\r\nopportunities, and it is one of these which I now desire to record.  In\r\ntelling it, I have made a slight change of name and place, but\r\notherwise the facts are as stated.\r\n\r\nOne forenoon--it was late in 1896--I received a hurried note from\r\nHolmes asking for my attendance.  When I arrived, I found him seated in\r\na smoke-laden atmosphere, with an elderly, motherly woman of the buxom\r\nlandlady type in the corresponding chair in front of him.\r\n\r\n\"This is Mrs. Merrilow, of South Brixton,\" said my friend, with a wave\r\nof the hand.  \"Mrs. Merrilow does not object to tobacco, Watson, if you\r\nwish to indulge your filthy habits.  Mrs. Merrilow has an interesting\r\nstory to tell which may well lead to further developments in which your\r\npresence may be useful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything I can do----\"\r\n\r\n\"You will understand, Mrs. Merrilow, that if I come to Mrs. Ronder I\r\nshould prefer to have a witness.  You will make her understand that\r\nbefore we arrive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord bless you, Mr. Holmes,\" said our visitor, \"she is that anxious to\r\nsee you that you might bring the whole parish at your heels!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall come early in the afternoon.  Let us see that we have\r\nour facts correct before we start.  If we go over them it will help Dr.\r\nWatson to understand the situation.  You say that Mrs. Ronder has been\r\nyour lodger for seven years and that you have only once seen her face.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I wish to God I had not!\" said Mrs. Merrilow.\r\n\r\n\"It was, I understand, terribly mutilated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, you would hardly say it was a face at all.  That's\r\nhow it looked.  Our milkman got a glimpse of her once peeping out of\r\nthe upper window, and he dropped his tin and the milk all over the\r\nfront garden.  That is the kind of face it is.  When I saw her--I\r\nhappened on her unawares--she covered up quick, and then she said,\r\n'Now, Mrs. Merrilow, you know at last why it is that I never raise my\r\nveil.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know anything about her history?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she give references when she came?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, but she gave hard cash, and plenty of it.  A quarter's rent\r\nright down on the table in advance and no arguing about terms.  In\r\nthese times a poor woman like me can't afford to turn down a chance\r\nlike that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she give any reason for choosing your house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine stands well back from the road and is more private than most.\r\nThen, again, I only take the one, and I have no family of my own.  I\r\nreckon she had tried others and found that mine suited her best.  It's\r\nprivacy she is after, and she is ready to pay for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say that she never showed her face from first to last save on the\r\none accidental occasion.  Well, it is a very remarkable story, most\r\nremarkable, and I don't wonder that you want it examined.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't, Mr. Holmes.  I am quite satisfied so long as I get my rent.\r\nYou could not have a quieter lodger, or one who gives less trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what has brought matters to a head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her health, Mr. Holmes.  She seems to be wasting away.  And there's\r\nsomething terrible on her mind.  'Murder!' she cries.  'Murder!'  And\r\nonce I heard her, 'You cruel beast!  You monster!' she cried.  It was\r\nin the night, and it fair rang through the house and sent the shivers\r\nthrough me.  So I went to her in the morning.  'Mrs. Ronder,' I says,\r\n'if you have anything that is troubling your soul, there's the clergy,'\r\nI says, 'and there's the police.  Between them you should get some\r\nhelp.'  'For God's sake, not the police!' says she, 'and the clergy\r\ncan't change what is past.  And yet,' she says, 'it would ease my mind\r\nif someone knew the truth before I died.'  'Well,' says I, 'if you\r\nwon't have the regulars, there is this detective man what we read\r\nabout'--beggin' your pardon, Mr. Holmes.  And she, she fair jumped at\r\nit.  'That's the man,' says she.  'I wonder I never thought of it\r\nbefore.  Bring him here, Mrs. Merrilow, and if he won't come, tell him\r\nI am the wife of Ronder's wild beast show.  Say that, and give him the\r\nname Abbas Parva.' Here it is as she wrote it, Abbas Parva.  'That will\r\nbring him, if he's the man I think he is.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And it will, too,\" remarked Holmes.  \"Very good, Mrs. Merrilow.  I\r\nshould like to have a little chat with Dr. Watson.  That will carry us\r\ntill lunch-time.  About three o'clock you may expect to see us at your\r\nhouse in Brixton.\"\r\n\r\nOur visitor had no sooner waddled out of the room--no other verb can\r\ndescribe Mrs. Merrilow's method of progression--than Sherlock Holmes\r\nthrew himself with fierce energy upon the pile of commonplace books in\r\nthe corner.  For a few minutes there was a constant swish of the\r\nleaves, and then with a grunt of satisfaction he came upon what he\r\nsought.  So excited was he that he did not rise, but sat upon the floor\r\nlike some strange Buddha, with crossed legs, the huge books all round\r\nhim, and one open upon his knees.\r\n\r\n\"The case worried me at the time, Watson.  Here are my marginal notes\r\nto prove it.  I confess that I could make nothing of it.  And yet I was\r\nconvinced that the coroner was wrong.  Have you no recollection of the\r\nAbbas Parva tragedy?\"\r\n\r\n\"None, Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet you were with me then.  But certainly my own impression was\r\nvery superficial, for there was nothing to go by, and none of the\r\nparties had engaged my services.  Perhaps you would care to read the\r\npapers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you not give me the points?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very easily done.  It will probably come back to your memory\r\nas I talk.  Ronder, of course, was a household word.  He was the rival\r\nof Wombwell, and of Sanger, one of the greatest showmen of his day.\r\nThere is evidence, however, that he took to drink, and that both he and\r\nhis show were on the down grade at the time of the great tragedy.  The\r\ncaravan had halted for the night at Abbas Parva, which is a small\r\nvillage in Berkshire, when this horror occurred.  They were on their\r\nway to Wimbledon, travelling by road, and they were simply camping, and\r\nnot exhibiting, as the place is so small a one that it would not have\r\npaid them to open.\r\n\r\n\"They had among their exhibits a very fine North African lion.  Sahara\r\nKing was its name, and it was the habit, both of Ronder and his wife,\r\nto give exhibitions inside its cage.  Here, you see, is a photograph of\r\nthe performance, by which you will perceive that Ronder was a huge\r\nporcine person and that his wife was a very magnificent woman.  It was\r\ndeposed at the inquest that there had been some signs that the lion was\r\ndangerous, but, as usual, familiarity begat contempt, and no notice was\r\ntaken of the fact.\r\n\r\n\"It was usual for either Ronder or his wife to feed the lion at night.\r\nSometimes one went, sometimes both, but they never allowed anyone else\r\nto do it, for they believed that so long as they were the food-carriers\r\nhe would regard them as benefactors, and would never molest them.  On\r\nthis particular night, seven years ago, they both went, and a very\r\nterrible happening followed, the details of which have never been made\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n\"It seems that the whole camp was roused near midnight by the roars of\r\nthe animal and the screams of the woman.  The different grooms and\r\n_employés_ rushed from their tents, carrying lanterns, and by their\r\nlight an awful sight was revealed.  Ronder lay, with the back of his\r\nhead crushed in and deep claw-marks across his scalp, some ten yards\r\nfrom the cage, which was open.  Close to the door of the cage lay Mrs.\r\nRonder, upon her back, with the creature squatting and snarling above\r\nher.  It had torn her face in such a fashion that it was never thought\r\nthat she could live.  Several of the circus men, headed by Leonardo,\r\nthe strongman, and Griggs, the clown, drove the creature off with\r\npoles, upon which it sprang back into the cage, and was at once locked\r\nin.  How it had got loose was a mystery.  It was conjectured that the\r\npair intended to enter the cage, but that when the door was loosed the\r\ncreature bounded out upon them.  There was no other point of interest\r\nin the evidence, save that the woman in a delirium of agony kept\r\nscreaming, 'Coward!  Coward!' as she was carried back to the van in\r\nwhich they lived.  It was six months before she was fit to give\r\nevidence, but the inquest was duly held, with the obvious verdict of\r\ndeath from misadventure.\"\r\n\r\n\"What alternative could be conceived?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"You may well say so.  And yet there were one or two points which\r\nworried young Edmunds, of the Berkshire Constabulary.  A smart lad\r\nthat!  He was sent later to Allahabad.  That was how I came into the\r\nmatter, for he dropped in and smoked a pipe or two over it.\"\r\n\r\n\"A thin, yellow-haired man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  I was sure you would pick up the trail presently.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what worried him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we were both worried.  It was so deucedly difficult to\r\nreconstruct the affair.  Look at it from the lion's point of view.  He\r\nis liberated.  What does he do?  He takes half a dozen bounds forward,\r\nwhich brings him to Ronder.  Ronder turns to fly,--the claw-marks were\r\non the back of his head--but the lion strikes him down.  Then, instead\r\nof bounding on and escaping, he returns to the woman, who was close to\r\nthe cage, and he knocks her over and chews her face up.  Then, again,\r\nthose cries of hers would seem to imply that her husband had in some\r\nway failed her.  What could the poor devil have done to help her?  You\r\nsee the difficulty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then there was another thing.  It comes back to me now as I think\r\nit over.  There was some evidence that, just at the time the lion\r\nroared and the woman screamed, a man began shouting in terror.\"\r\n\r\n\"This man Ronder, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if his skull was smashed in you would hardly expect to hear from\r\nhim again.  There were at least two witnesses who spoke of the cries of\r\na man being mingled with those of a woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think the whole camp was crying out by then.  As to the other\r\npoints, I think I could suggest a solution.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be glad to consider it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The two were together, ten yards from the cage, when the lion got\r\nloose.  The man turned and was struck down.  The woman conceived the\r\nidea of getting into the cage and shutting the door.  It was her only\r\nrefuge.  She made for it, and just as she reached it the beast bounded\r\nafter her and knocked her over.  She was angry with her husband for\r\nhaving encouraged the beast's rage by turning.  If they had faced it,\r\nthey might have cowed it.  Hence her cries of 'Coward!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Brilliant, Watson!  Only one flaw in your diamond.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the flaw, Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they were both ten paces from the cage, how came the beast to get\r\nloose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible that they had some enemy who loosed it?\"\r\n\r\n\"And why should it attack them savagely when it was in the habit of\r\nplaying with them, and doing tricks with them inside the cage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly the same enemy had done something to enrage it.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes looked thoughtful and remained in silence for some moments.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Watson, there is this to be said for your theory.  Ronder was a\r\nman of many enemies.  Edmunds told me that in his cups he was horrible.\r\nA huge bully of a man, he cursed and slashed at everyone who came in\r\nhis way.  I expect those cries about a monster, of which our visitor\r\nhas spoken, were nocturnal reminiscences of the dear departed.\r\nHowever, our speculations are futile until we have all the facts.\r\nThere is a cold partridge on the sideboard, Watson, and a bottle of\r\nMontrachet.  Let us renew our energies before we make a fresh call upon\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen our hansom deposited us at the house of Mrs. Merrilow, we found\r\nthat plump lady blocking up the open door of her humble but retired\r\nabode.  It was very clear that her chief preoccupation was lest she\r\nshould lose a valuable lodger, and she implored us, before showing us\r\nup, to say and do nothing which could lead to so undesirable an end.\r\nThen, having reassured her, we followed her up the straight,\r\nbadly-carpeted staircase and were shown into the room of the mysterious\r\nlodger.\r\n\r\nIt was a close, musty, ill-ventilated place, as might be expected,\r\nsince its inmate seldom left it.  From keeping beasts in a cage, the\r\nwoman seemed, by some retribution of Fate, to have become herself a\r\nbeast in a cage.  She sat now in a broken arm-chair in the shadowy\r\ncorner of the room.  Long years of inaction had coarsened the lines of\r\nher figure, but at some period it must have been beautiful, and was\r\nstill full and voluptuous.  A thick dark veil covered her face, but it\r\nwas cut off close at her upper lip, and disclosed a perfectly-shaped\r\nmouth and a delicately-rounded chin.  I could well conceive that she\r\nhad indeed been a very remarkable woman.  Her voice, too, was\r\nwell-modulated and pleasing.\r\n\r\n\"My name is not unfamiliar to you, Mr. Holmes,\" said she.  \"I thought\r\nthat it would bring you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so, madam, though I do not know how you are aware that I was\r\ninterested in your case.\"\r\n\r\n\"I learned it when I had recovered my health and was examined by Mr.\r\nEdmunds, the County detective.  I fear I lied to him.  Perhaps it would\r\nhave been wiser had I told the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is usually wiser to tell the truth.  But why did you lie to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the fate of someone else depended upon it.  I know that he was\r\na very worthless being, and yet I would not have his destruction upon\r\nmy conscience.  We had been so close--so close!\"\r\n\r\n\"But has this impediment been removed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.  The person that I allude to is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why should you not now tell the police anything you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because there is another person to be considered.  That other person\r\nis myself.  I could not stand the scandal and publicity which would\r\ncome from a police examination.  I have not long to live, but I wish to\r\ndie undisturbed.  And yet I wanted to find one man of judgment to whom\r\nI could tell my terrible story, so that when I am gone all might be\r\nunderstood.\"\r\n\r\n\"You compliment me, madam.  At the same time, I am a responsible\r\nperson.  I do not promise you that when you have spoken I may not\r\nmyself think it my duty to refer the case to the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not, Mr. Holmes.  I know your character and methods too well,\r\nfor I have followed your work for some years.  Reading is the only\r\npleasure which Fate has left me, and I miss little which passes in the\r\nworld.  But in any case, I will take my chance of the use which you may\r\nmake of my tragedy.  It will ease my mind to tell it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend and I would be glad to hear it.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman rose and took from a drawer the photograph of a man.  He was\r\nclearly a professional acrobat, a man of magnificent physique, taken\r\nwith his huge arms folded across his swollen chest and a smile breaking\r\nfrom under his heavy moustache--the self-satisfied smile of the man of\r\nmany conquests.\r\n\r\n\"That is Leonardo,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Leonardo, the strongman, who gave evidence?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same.  And this--this is my husband.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a dreadful face--a human pig, or rather a human wild boar, for\r\nit was formidable in its bestiality.  One could imagine that vile mouth\r\nchamping and foaming in its rage, and one could conceive those small,\r\nvicious eyes darting pure malignancy as they looked forth upon the\r\nworld, Ruffian, bully, beast--it was all written on that heavy-jowled\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Those two pictures will help you, gentlemen, to understand the story.\r\nI was a poor circus girl brought up on the sawdust, and doing springs\r\nthrough the hoop before I was ten.  When I became a woman this man\r\nloved me, if such lust as his can be called love, and in an evil moment\r\nI became his wife.  From that day I was in hell, and he the devil who\r\ntormented me.  There was no one in the show who did not know of his\r\ntreatment.  He deserted me for others.  He tied me down and lashed me\r\nwith his riding-whip when I complained.  They all pitied me and they\r\nall loathed him, but what could they do?  They feared him, one and all.\r\nFor he was terrible at all times, and murderous when he was drunk.\r\nAgain and again he was had for assault, and for cruelty to the beasts,\r\nbut he had plenty of money and the fines were nothing to him.  The best\r\nmen all left us and the show began to go downhill.  It was only\r\nLeonardo and I who kept it up--with little Jimmy Griggs, the clown.\r\nPoor devil, he had not much to be funny about, but he did what he could\r\nto hold things together.\r\n\r\n\"Then Leonardo came more and more into my life.  You see what he was\r\nlike.  I know now the poor spirit that was hidden in that splendid\r\nbody, but compared to my husband he seemed like the Angel Gabriel.  He\r\npitied me and helped me, till at last our intimacy turned to\r\nlove--deep, deep, passionate love, such love as I had dreamed of but\r\nnever hoped to feel.  My husband suspected it, but I think that he was\r\na coward as well as a bully, and that Leonardo was the one man that he\r\nwas afraid of.  He took revenge in his own way by torturing me more\r\nthan ever.  One night my cries brought Leonardo to the door of our van.\r\nWe were near tragedy that night, and soon my lover and I understood\r\nthat it could not be avoided.  My husband was not fit to live.  We\r\nplanned that he should die.\r\n\r\n\"Leonardo had a clever, scheming brain.  It was he who planned it.  I\r\ndo not say that to blame him, for I was ready to go with him every inch\r\nof the way.  But I should never have had the wit to think of such a\r\nplan.  We made a club--Leonardo made it--and in the leaden head he\r\nfastened five long steel nails, the points outwards, with just such a\r\nspread as the lion's paw.  This was to give my husband his death-blow,\r\nand yet to leave the evidence that it was the lion which we would loose\r\nwho had done the deed.\r\n\r\n\"It was a pitch-dark night when my husband and I went down, as was our\r\ncustom, to feed the beast.  We carried with us the raw meat in a zinc\r\npail.  Leonardo was waiting at the corner of the big van which we\r\nshould have to pass before we reached the cage.  He was too slow, and\r\nwe walked past him before he could strike, but he followed us on tiptoe\r\nand I heard the crash as the club smashed my husband's skull.  My heart\r\nleaped with joy at the sound.  I sprang forward, and I undid the catch\r\nwhich held the door of the great lion's cage.\r\n\r\n\"And then the terrible thing happened.  You may have heard how quick\r\nthese creatures are to scent human blood, and how it excites them.\r\nSome strange instinct had told the creature in one instant that a human\r\nbeing had been slain.  As I slipped the bars it bounded out, and was on\r\nme in an instant.  Leonardo could have saved me.  If he had rushed\r\nforward and struck the beast with his club he might have cowed it.  But\r\nthe man lost his nerve.  I heard him shout in his terror, and then I\r\nsaw him turn and fly.  At the same instant the teeth of the lion met in\r\nmy face.  Its hot, filthy breath had already poisoned me and I was\r\nhardly conscious of pain.  With the palms of my hands I tried to push\r\nthe great steaming, blood-stained jaws away from me, and I screamed for\r\nhelp.  I was conscious that the camp was stirring, and then dimly I\r\nremember a group of men, Leonardo, Griggs and others, dragging me from\r\nunder the creature's paws.  That was my last memory, Mr. Holmes, for\r\nmany a weary month.  When I came to myself, and saw myself in the\r\nmirror, I cursed that lion--oh, how I cursed him!---not because he had\r\ntorn away my beauty, but because he had not torn away my life.  I had\r\nbut one desire, Mr. Holmes, and I had enough money to gratify it.  It\r\nwas that I should cover myself so that my poor face should be seen by\r\nnone, and that I should dwell where none whom I had ever known should\r\nfind me.  That was all that was left to me to do--and that is what I\r\nhave done.  A poor wounded beast that has crawled into its hole to\r\ndie--that is the end of Eugenia Ronder.\"\r\n\r\nWe sat in silence for some time after the unhappy woman had told her\r\nstory.  Then Holmes stretched out his long arm and patted her hand with\r\nsuch a show of sympathy as I had seldom known him to exhibit.\r\n\r\n\"Poor girl!\" he said.  \"Poor girl!  The ways of Fate are indeed hard to\r\nunderstand.  If there is not some compensation hereafter, then the\r\nworld is a cruel jest.  But what of this man Leonardo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never saw him or heard from him again.  Perhaps I have been wrong to\r\nfeel so bitterly against him.  He might as soon have loved one of the\r\nfreaks whom we carried round the country as the thing which the lion\r\nhad left.  But a woman's love is not so easily set aside.  He had left\r\nme under the beast's claws, he had deserted me in my need, and yet I\r\ncould not bring myself to give him to the gallows.  For myself, I cared\r\nnothing what became of me.  What could be more dreadful than my actual\r\nlife?  But I stood between Leonardo and his fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he is dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was drowned last month when bathing near Margate.  I saw his death\r\nin the paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did he do with this five-clawed club, which is the most\r\nsingular and ingenious part of all your story?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell, Mr. Holmes.  There is a chalk-pit by the camp, with a\r\ndeep green pool at the base of it.  Perhaps in the depths of that\r\npool----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, it is of little consequence now.  The case is closed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the woman, \"the case is closed.\"\r\n\r\nWe had risen to go, but there was something in the woman's voice which\r\narrested Holmes's attention.  He turned swiftly upon her.\r\n\r\n\"Your life is not your own,\" he said.  \"Keep your hands off it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What use is it to anyone?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you tell?  The example of patient suffering is in itself the\r\nmost precious of all lessons to an impatient world.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman's answer was a terrible one.  She raised her veil and stepped\r\nforward into the light.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if you would bear it,\" she said.\r\n\r\nIt was horrible.  No words can describe the framework of a face when\r\nthe face itself is gone.  Two living and beautiful brown eyes looking\r\nsadly out from that grisly ruin did but make the view more awful.\r\nHolmes held up his hand in a gesture of pity and protest, and together\r\nwe left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later, when I called upon my friend, he pointed with some\r\npride to a small blue bottle upon his mantelpiece.  I picked it up.\r\nThere was a red poison label.  A pleasant almondy odour rose when I\r\nopened it.\r\n\r\n\"Prussic acid?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  It came by post.  'I send you my temptation.  I will follow\r\nyour advice.'  That was the message.  I think, Watson, we can guess the\r\nname of the brave woman who sent it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF SHOSCOMBE OLD PLACE\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had been bending for a long time over a low-power\r\nmicroscope.  Now he straightened himself up and looked round at me in\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n\"It is glue, Watson,\" said he.  \"Unquestionably it is glue.  Have a\r\nlook at these scattered objects in the field!\"\r\n\r\nI stooped to the eyepiece and focused for my vision.\r\n\r\n\"Those hairs are threads from a tweed coat.  The irregular grey masses\r\nare dust.  There are epithelial scales on the left.  Those brown blobs\r\nin the centre are undoubtedly glue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, laughing, \"I am prepared to take your word for it.\r\nDoes anything depend upon it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a very fine demonstration,\" he answered.  \"In the St. Pancras\r\ncase you may remember that a cap was found beside the dead policeman.\r\nThe accused man denies that it is his.  But he is a picture-frame maker\r\nwho habitually handles glue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it one of your cases?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; my friend, Merivale of the Yard, asked me to look into the case.\r\nSince I ran down that coiner by the zinc and copper filings in the seam\r\nof his cuff they have begun to realize the importance of the\r\nmicroscope.\"  He looked impatiently at his watch.  \"I had a new client\r\ncalling, but he is overdue.  By the way, Watson, you know something of\r\nracing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I ought to.  I pay for it with about half my wound pension.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll make you my 'Handy Guide to the Turf.'  What about Sir\r\nRobert Norberton?  Does the name recall anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I should say so.  He lives at Shoscombe Old Place, and I know it\r\nwell, for my summer quarters were down there once.  Norberton nearly\r\ncame within your province once.\"\r\n\r\n\"How was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was when he horsewhipped Sam Brewer, the well-known Curzon Street\r\nmoneylender, on Newmarket Heath.  He nearly killed the man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, he sounds interesting!  Does he often indulge in that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he has the name of being a dangerous man.  He is about the most\r\ndaredevil rider in England--second in the Grand National a few years\r\nback.  He is one of those men who have overshot their true generation.\r\nHe should have been a buck in the days of the Regency--a boxer, an\r\nathlete, a plunger on the Turf, a lover of fair ladies, and, by all\r\naccount, so far down Queer Street that he may never find his way back\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital, Watson!  A thumb-nail sketch.  I seem to know the man.  Now,\r\ncan you give me some idea of Shoscombe Old Place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that it is in the centre of Shoscombe Park, and that the famous\r\nShoscombe stud and training quarters are to be found there.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the head trainer,\" said Holmes, \"is John Mason.  You need not look\r\nsurprised at my knowledge, Watson, for this is a letter from him which\r\nI am unfolding.  But let us have some more about Shoscombe.  I seem to\r\nhave struck a rich vein.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are the Shoscombe spaniels,\" said I.  \"You hear of them at every\r\ndog show.  The most exclusive breed in England.  They are the special\r\npride of the lady of Shoscombe Old Place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir Robert Norberton's wife, I presume!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir Robert has never married.  Just as well, I think, considering his\r\nprospects.  He lives with his widowed sister, Lady Beatrice Falder.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that she lives with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no.  The place belonged to her late husband, Sir James.  Norberton\r\nhas no claim on it at all.  It is only a life interest and reverts to\r\nher husband's brother.  Meantime, she draws the rents every year.\"\r\n\r\n\"And brother Robert, I suppose, spends the said rents?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is about the size of it.  He is a devil of a fellow and must lead\r\nher a most uneasy life.  Yet I have heard that she is devoted to him.\r\nBut what is amiss at Shoscombe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that is just what I want to know.  And here, I expect, is the man\r\nwho can tell us.\"\r\n\r\nThe door had opened and the page had shown in a tall, clean-shaven man\r\nwith the firm, austere expression which is only seen upon those who\r\nhave to control horses or boys.  Mr. John Mason had many of both under\r\nhis sway, and he looked equal to the task.  He bowed with cold\r\nself-possession and seated himself upon the chair to which Holmes had\r\nwaved him.\r\n\r\n\"You had my note, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it explained nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was too delicate a thing for me to put the details on paper.  And\r\ntoo complicated.  It was only face to face I could do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we are at your disposal.\"\r\n\r\n\"First of all, Mr. Holmes, I think that my employer, Sir Robert, has\r\ngone mad.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes raised his eyebrows.  \"This is Baker Street, not Harley Street,\"\r\nsaid he.  \"But why do you say so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, when a man does one queer thing, or two queer things, there\r\nmay be a meaning to it, but when everything he does is queer, then you\r\nbegin to wonder.  I believe Shoscombe Prince and the Derby have turned\r\nhis brain.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a colt you are running?\"\r\n\r\n\"The best in England, Mr. Holmes.  I should know, if anyone does.  Now,\r\nI'll be plain with you, for I know you are gentlemen of honour and that\r\nit won't go beyond the room.  Sir Robert has got to win this Derby.\r\nHe's up to the neck, and it's his last chance.  Everything he could\r\nraise or borrow is on the horse--and at fine odds, too!  You can get\r\nforties now, but it was nearer the hundred when he began to back him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how is that, if the horse is so good?\"\r\n\r\n\"The public don't know how good he is.  Sir Robert has been too clever\r\nfor the touts.  He has the Prince's half-brother out for spins.  You\r\ncan't tell 'em apart.  But there are two lengths in a furlong between\r\nthem when it comes to a gallop.  He thinks of nothing but the horse and\r\nthe race.  His whole life is on it.  He's holding off the Jews till\r\nthen.  If the Prince fails him, he is done.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems a rather desperate gamble, but where does the madness come\r\nin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, first of all, you have only to look at him.  I don't believe he\r\nsleeps at night.  He is down at the stables at all hours.  His eyes are\r\nwild.  It has all been too much for his nerves.  Then there is his\r\nconduct to Lady Beatrice!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! what is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have always been the best of friends.  They had the same tastes,\r\nthe two of them, and she loved the horses as much as he did.  Every day\r\nat the same hour she would drive down to see them--and, above all, she\r\nloved the Prince.  He would prick up his ears when he heard the wheels\r\non the gravel, and he would trot out each morning to the carriage to\r\nget his lump of sugar.  But that's all over now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, she seems to have lost all interest in the horses.  For a week\r\nnow she has driven past the stables with never so much as 'good\r\nmorning'!\"\r\n\r\n\"You think there has been a quarrel?\"\r\n\r\n\"And a bitter, savage, spiteful quarrel at that.  Why else would he\r\ngive away her pet spaniel that she loved as if he were her child?  He\r\ngave it a few days ago to old Barnes, what keeps the 'Green Dragon,'\r\nthree miles off, at Crendall.\"\r\n\r\n\"That certainly did seem strange.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, with her weak heart and dropsy one couldn't expect that she\r\ncould get about with him, but he spent two hours every evening in her\r\nroom.  He might well do what he could, for she has been a rare good\r\nfriend to him.  But that's all over, too.  He never goes near her.  And\r\nshe takes it to heart.  She is brooding and sulky and drinking, Mr.\r\nHolmes--drinking like a fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she drink before this estrangement?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, she took her glass, but now it is often a whole bottle of an\r\nevening.  So Stephens, the butler, told me.  It's all changed, Mr.\r\nHolmes, and there is something damned rotten about it.  But then,\r\nagain, what is master doing down at the old church crypt at night?  And\r\nwho is the man that meets him there?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes rubbed his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, Mr. Mason.  You get more and more interesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the butler who saw him go.  Twelve o'clock at night and raining\r\nhard.  So next night I was up at the house and, sure enough, master was\r\noff again.  Stephens and I went after him, but it was jumpy work, for\r\nit would have been a bad job if he had seen us.  He's a terrible man\r\nwith his fists if he gets started, and no respecter of persons.  So we\r\nwere shy of getting too near, but we marked him down all right.  It was\r\nthe haunted crypt that he was making for, and there was a man waiting\r\nfor him there.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is this haunted crypt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, there is an old ruined chapel in the park.  It is so old\r\nthat nobody could fix its date.  And under it there's a crypt which has\r\na bad name among us.  It's a dark, damp, lonely place by day, but there\r\nare few in that county that would have the nerve to go near it at\r\nnight.  But master's not afraid.  He never feared anything in his life.\r\nBut what is he doing there in the night-time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a bit!\" said Holmes.  \"You say there is another man there.  It\r\nmust be one of your own stable-men, or someone from the house!  Surely\r\nyou have only to spot who it is and question him?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no one I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have seen him, Mr. Holmes.  It was on that second night.\r\nSir Robert turned and passed us--me and Stephens, quaking in the bushes\r\nlike two bunny-rabbits, for there was a bit of moon that night.  But we\r\ncould hear the other moving about behind.  We were not afraid of him.\r\nSo we up when Sir Robert was gone and pretended we were just having a\r\nwalk like in the moonlight, and so we came right on him as casual and\r\ninnocent as you please.  'Hullo, mate! who may you be?' says I.  I\r\nguess he had not heard us coming, so he looked over his shoulder with a\r\nface as if he had seen the Devil coming out of Hell.  He let out a\r\nyell, and away he went as hard as he could lick it in the darkness.  He\r\ncould run!--I'll give him that.  In a minute he was out of sight and\r\nhearing, and who he was, or what he was, we never found.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you saw him clearly in the moonlight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I would swear to his yellow face--a mean dog, I should say.  What\r\ncould he have in common with Sir Robert?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes sat for some time lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\"Who keeps Lady Beatrice Falder company?\" he asked at last.\r\n\r\n\"There is her maid, Carrie Evans.  She has been with her this five\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is, no doubt, devoted?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mason shuffled uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n\"She's devoted enough,\" he answered at last.  \"But I won't say to whom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell tales out of school.\"\r\n\r\n\"I quite understand, Mr. Mason.  Of course, the situation is clear\r\nenough.  From Dr. Watson's description of Sir Robert I can realize that\r\nno woman is safe from him.  Don't you think the quarrel between brother\r\nand sister may lie there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the scandal has been pretty clear for a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she may not have seen it before.  Let us suppose that she has\r\nsuddenly found it out.  She wants to get rid of the woman.  Her brother\r\nwill not permit it.  The invalid, with her weak heart and inability to\r\nget about, has no means of enforcing her will.  The hated maid is still\r\ntied to her.  The lady refuses to speak, sulks, takes to drink.  Sir\r\nRobert in his anger takes her pet spaniel away from her.  Does not all\r\nthis hang together?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it might do--so far as it goes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!  As far as it goes.  How would all that bear upon the visits\r\nby night to the old crypt?  We can't fit that into our plot.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, and there is something more that I can't fit in.  Why should\r\nSir Robert want to dig up a dead body?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes sat up abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"We only found it out yesterday--after I had written to you.  Yesterday\r\nSir Robert had gone to London, so Stephens and I went down to the\r\ncrypt.  It was all in order, sir, except that in one corner was a bit\r\nof a human body.\"\r\n\r\n\"You informed the police, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\nOur visitor smiled grimly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I think it would hardly interest them.  It was just the\r\nhead and a few bones of a mummy.  It may have been a thousand years\r\nold.  But it wasn't there before.  That I'll swear, and so will\r\nStephens.  It had been stowed away in a corner and covered over with a\r\nboard, but that corner had always been empty before.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we just left it there.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was wise.  You say Sir Robert was away yesterday.  Has he\r\nreturned?\"\r\n\r\n\"We expect him back to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did Sir Robert give away his sister's dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was just a week ago to-day.  The creature was howling outside the\r\nold well-house, and Sir Robert was in one of his tantrums that morning.\r\nHe caught it up and I thought he would have killed it.  Then he gave it\r\nto Sandy Bain, the jockey, and told him to take the dog to old Barnes\r\nat the 'Green Dragon,' for he never wished to see it again.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes sat for some time in silent thought.  He had lit the oldest and\r\nfoulest of his pipes.\r\n\r\n\"I am not clear yet what you want me to do in this matter, Mr. Mason,\"\r\nhe said at last.  \"Can't you make it more definite?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps this will make it more definite, Mr. Holmes,\" said our visitor.\r\n\r\nHe took a paper from his pocket and, unwrapping it carefully, he\r\nexposed a charred fragment of bone.\r\n\r\nHolmes examined it with interest.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a central heating furnace in the cellar under Lady Beatrice's\r\nroom.  It's been off for some time, but Sir Robert complained of cold\r\nand had it on again.  Harvey runs it--he's one of my lads.  This very\r\nmorning he came to me with this which he found raking out the cinders.\r\nHe didn't like the look of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor do I,\" said Holmes.  \"What do you make of it, Watson?\"\r\n\r\nIt was burned to a black cinder, but there could be no question as to\r\nits anatomical significance.\r\n\r\n\"It's the upper condyle of a human femur,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!\"  Holmes had become very serious.  \"When does this lad tend\r\nto the furnace?\"\r\n\r\n\"He makes it up every evening and then leaves it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then anyone could visit it during the night?\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you enter it from outside?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one door from outside.  There is another which leads up by a\r\nstair to the passage in which Lady Beatrice's room is situated.\"\r\n\r\n\"These are deep waters, Mr. Mason; deep and rather dirty.  You say that\r\nSir Robert was not at home last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, whoever was burning bones, it was not he.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the name of that inn you spoke of?\"\r\n\r\n\"The 'Green Dragon.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there good fishing in that part of Berkshire?\"\r\n\r\nThe honest trainer showed very clearly upon his face that he was\r\nconvinced that yet another lunatic had come into his harassed life.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I've heard there are trout in the millstream and pike in\r\nthe Hall lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good enough.  Watson and I are famous fishermen--are we not,\r\nWatson?  You may address us in future at the 'Green Dragon.'  We should\r\nreach it to-night.  I need not say that we don't want to see you, Mr.\r\nMason, but a note will reach us, and no doubt I could find you if I\r\nwant you.  When we have gone a little farther into the matter I will\r\nlet you have a considered opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThus it was that on a bright May evening Holmes and I found ourselves\r\nalone in a first-class carriage and bound for the little\r\n\"halt-on-demand\" station of Shoscombe.  The rack above us was covered\r\nwith a formidable litter of rods, reels and baskets.  On reaching our\r\ndestination a short drive took us to an old-fashioned tavern, where a\r\nsporting host, Josiah Barnes, entered eagerly into our plans for the\r\nextirpation of the fish of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\"What about the Hall lake and the chance of a pike?\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe face of the innkeeper clouded.\r\n\r\n\"That wouldn't do, sir.  You might chance to find yourself in the lake\r\nbefore you were through.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Sir Robert, sir.  He's terrible jealous of touts.  If you two\r\nstrangers were as near his training quarters as that he'd be after you\r\nas sure as fate.  He ain't taking no chances, Sir Robert ain't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heard he has a horse entered for the Derby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and a good colt, too.  He carries all our money for the race, and\r\nall Sir Robert's into the bargain.  By the way\"--he looked at us with\r\nthoughtful eyes--\"I suppose you ain't on the Turf yourselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed.  Just two weary Londoners who badly need some good\r\nBerkshire air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are in the right place for that.  There is a deal of it\r\nlying about.  But mind what I have told you about Sir Robert.  He's the\r\nsort that strikes first and speaks afterwards.  Keep clear of the park.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, Mr. Barnes!  We certainly shall.  By the way, that was a most\r\nbeautiful spaniel that was whining in the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say it was.  That was the real Shoscombe breed.  There ain't\r\na better in England.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a dog-fancier myself,\" said Holmes.  \"Now, if it is a fair\r\nquestion, what would a prize dog like that cost?\"\r\n\r\n\"More than I could pay, sir.  It was Sir Robert himself who gave me\r\nthis one.  That's why I have to keep it on a lead.  It would be off to\r\nthe Hall in a jiffy if I gave it its head.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are getting some cards in our hand, Watson,\" said Holmes, when the\r\nlandlord had left us.  \"It's not an easy one to play, but we may see\r\nour way in a day or two.  By the way Sir Robert is still in London, I\r\nhear.  We might, perhaps, enter the sacred domain to-night without fear\r\nof bodily assault.  There are one or two points on which I should like\r\nreassurance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any theory, Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only this, Watson, that something happened a week or so ago which has\r\ncut deep into the life of the Shoscombe household.  What is that\r\nsomething?  We can only guess at it from its effects.  They seem to be\r\nof a curiously mixed character.  But that should surely help us.  It is\r\nonly the colourless, uneventful case which is hopeless.\r\n\r\n\"Let us consider our data.  The brother no longer visits the beloved\r\ninvalid sister.  He gives away her favourite dog.  Her dog, Watson!\r\nDoes that suggest nothing to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but the brother's spite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it might be so.  Or--well, there is an alternative.  Now to\r\ncontinue our review of the situation from the time that the quarrel, if\r\nthere is a quarrel, began.  The lady keeps her room, alters her habits,\r\nis not seen save when she drives out with her maid, refuses to stop at\r\nthe stables to greet her favourite horse, and apparently takes to\r\ndrink.  That covers the case, does it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Save for the business in the crypt.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is another line of thought.  There are two, and I beg you will\r\nnot tangle them.  Line A, which concerns Lady Beatrice, has a vaguely\r\nsinister flavour, has it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can make nothing of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, let us take up line B, which concerns Sir Robert.  He is\r\nmad keen upon winning the Derby.  He is in the hands of the Jews, and\r\nmay at any moment be sold up and his racing stables seized by his\r\ncreditors.  He is a daring and desperate man.  He derives his income\r\nfrom his sister.  His sister's maid is his willing tool.  So far we\r\nseem to be on fairly safe ground, do we not?\"\r\n\r\n\"But the crypt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, the crypt!  Let us suppose, Watson--it is merely a scandalous\r\nsupposition, a hypothesis put forward for argument's sake--that Sir\r\nRobert has done away with his sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Holmes, it is out of the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very possibly, Watson.  Sir Robert is a man of an honourable stock.\r\nBut you do occasionally find a carrion crow among the eagles.  Let us\r\nfor a moment argue upon this supposition.  He could not fly the country\r\nuntil he had realized his fortune, and that fortune could only be\r\nrealized by bringing off this coup with Shoscombe Prince.  Therefore,\r\nhe has still to stand his ground.  To do this he would have to dispose\r\nof the body of his victim, and he would also have to find a substitute\r\nwho would impersonate her.  With the maid as his confidante that would\r\nnot be impossible.  The woman's body might be conveyed to the crypt,\r\nwhich is a place so seldom visited, and it might be secretly destroyed\r\nat night in the furnace, leaving behind it such evidence as we have\r\nalready seen.  What say you to that, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is all possible if you grant the original monstrous\r\nsupposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that there is a small experiment which we may try to-morrow,\r\nWatson, in order to throw some light on the matter.  Meanwhile, if we\r\nmean to keep up our characters, I suggest that we have our host in for\r\na glass of his own wine and hold some high converse upon eels and dace,\r\nwhich seems to be the straight road to his affections.  We may chance\r\nto come upon some useful local gossip in the process.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning Holmes discovered that we had come without our\r\nspoon-bait for jack, which absolved us from fishing for the day.  About\r\neleven o'clock we started for a walk, and he obtained leave to take the\r\nblack spaniel with us.\r\n\r\n\"This is the place,\" said he, as we came to two high park gates with\r\nheraldic griffins towering above them.  \"About midday, Mr. Barnes\r\ninforms me, the old lady takes a drive, and the carriage must slow down\r\nwhile the gates are opened.  When it comes through, and before it\r\ngathers speed, I want you, Watson, to stop the coachman with some\r\nquestion.  Never mind me.  I shall stand behind this holly-bush and see\r\nwhat I can see.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not a long vigil.  Within a quarter of an hour we saw the big\r\nopen yellow barouche coming down the long avenue, with two splendid,\r\nhigh-stepping grey carriage horses in the shafts.  Holmes crouched\r\nbehind his bush with the dog.  I stood unconcernedly swinging a cane in\r\nthe roadway.  A keeper ran out and the gates swung open.\r\n\r\nThe carriage had slowed to a walk and I was able to get a good look at\r\nthe occupants.  A highly-coloured young woman with flaxen hair and\r\nimpudent eyes sat on the left.  At her right was an elderly person with\r\nrounded back and a huddle of shawls about her face and shoulders which\r\nproclaimed the invalid.  When the horses reached the high road I held\r\nup my hand with an authoritative gesture, and as the coachman pulled up\r\nI inquired if Sir Robert was at Shoscombe Old Place.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Holmes stepped out and released the spaniel.  With a\r\njoyous cry it dashed forward to the carriage and sprang upon the step.\r\nThen in a moment its eager greeting changed to furious rage, and it\r\nsnapped at the black skirt above it.\r\n\r\n\"Drive on!  Drive on!\" shrieked a harsh voice.  The coachman lashed the\r\nhorses, and we were left standing in the roadway.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Watson, that's done it,\" said Holmes, as he fastened the lead to\r\nthe neck of the excited spaniel.  \"He thought it was his mistress and\r\nhe found it was a stranger.  Dogs don't make mistakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it was the voice of a man!\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!  We have added one card to our hand, Watson, but it needs\r\ncareful playing, all the same.\"\r\n\r\nMy companion seemed to have no further plans for the day, and we did\r\nactually use our fishing tackle in the mill-stream, with the result\r\nthat we had a dish of trout for our supper.  It was only after that\r\nmeal that Holmes showed signs of renewed activity.  Once more we found\r\nourselves upon the same road as in the morning, which led us to the\r\npark gates.  A tall, dark figure was awaiting us there, who proved to\r\nbe our London acquaintance, Mr. John Mason, the trainer.\r\n\r\n\"Good evening, gentlemen,\" said he.  \"I got your note, Mr. Holmes.  Sir\r\nRobert has not returned yet, but I hear that he is expected to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far is this crypt from the house?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"A good quarter of a mile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I think we can disregard him altogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't afford to do that, Mr. Holmes.  The moment he arrives he will\r\nwant to see me to get the last news of Shoscombe Prince.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see!  In that case we must work without you, Mr. Mason.  You can\r\nshow us the crypt and then leave us.\"\r\n\r\nIt was pitch-dark and without a moon, but Mason led us over the\r\ngrass-lands until a dark mass loomed up in front of us which proved to\r\nbe the ancient chapel.  We entered the broken gap which was once the\r\nporch and our guide, stumbling among heaps of loose masonry, picked his\r\nway to the corner of the building, where a steep stair led down into\r\nthe crypt.  Striking a match, he illuminated the melancholy\r\nplace--dismal and evil-smelling, with ancient crumbling walls of\r\nrough-hewn stone, and piles of coffins, some of lead and some of stone,\r\nextending upon one side right up to the arched and groined roof which\r\nlost itself in the shadows above our heads.  Holmes had lit his\r\nlantern, which shot a tiny tunnel of vivid yellow light upon the\r\nmournful scene.  Its rays were reflected back from the coffin-plates,\r\nmany of them adorned with the griffin and coronet of this old family\r\nwhich carried its honours even to the gate of Death.\r\n\r\n\"You spoke of some bones, Mr. Mason.  Could you show them before you\r\ngo?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are here in this corner.\"  The trainer strode across and then\r\nstood in silent surprise as our light was turned upon the place.  \"They\r\nare gone,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"So I expected,\" said Holmes, chuckling.  \"I fancy the ashes of them\r\nmight even now be found in that oven which had already consumed a part.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why in the world would anyone want to burn the bones of a man who\r\nhas been dead a thousand years?\" asked John Mason.\r\n\r\n\"That is what we are here to find out,\" said Holmes.  \"It may mean a\r\nlong search, and we need not detain you.  I fancy that we shall get our\r\nsolution before morning.\"\r\n\r\nWhen John Mason had left us, Holmes set to work making a very careful\r\nexamination of the graves, ranging from a very ancient one, which\r\nappeared to be Saxon, in the centre, through a long line of Norman\r\nHugos and Odos, until we reached the Sir William and Sir Denis Falder\r\nof the eighteenth century.  It was an hour or more before Holmes came\r\nto a leaden coffin standing on end before the entrance to the vault.  I\r\nheard his little cry of satisfaction, and was aware from his hurried\r\nbut purposeful movements that he had reached a goal.  With his lens he\r\nwas eagerly examining the edges of the heavy lid.  Then he drew from\r\nhis pocket a short jemmy, a box-opener, which he thrust into a chink,\r\nlevering back the whole front, which seemed to be secured by only a\r\ncouple of clamps.  There was a rending, tearing sound as it gave way,\r\nbut it had hardly hinged back and partly revealed the contents before\r\nwe had an unforeseen interruption.\r\n\r\nSomeone was walking in the chapel above.  It was the firm, rapid step\r\nof one who came with a definite purpose and knew well the ground upon\r\nwhich he walked.  A light streamed down the stairs, and an instant\r\nlater the man who bore it was framed in the Gothic archway.  He was a\r\nterrible figure, huge in stature and fierce in manner.  A large\r\nstable-lantern which he held in front of him shone upwards upon a\r\nstrong, heavily-moustached face and angry eyes, which glared round him\r\ninto every recess of the vault, finally fixing themselves with a deadly\r\nstare upon my companion and myself.\r\n\r\n\"Who the devil are you?\" he thundered.  \"And what are you doing upon my\r\nproperty?\"  Then, as Holmes returned no answer, he took a couple of\r\nsteps forward and raised a heavy stick which he carried.  \"Do you hear\r\nme?\" he cried.  \"Who are you?  What are you doing here?\"  His cudgel\r\nquivered in the air.\r\n\r\nBut instead of shrinking, Holmes advanced to meet him.\r\n\r\n\"I also have a question to ask you, Sir Robert,\" he said in his\r\nsternest tone.  \"Who is this?  And what is it doing here?\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and tore open the coffin-lid behind him.  In the glare of the\r\nlantern I saw a body swathed in a sheet from head to foot, with\r\ndreadful, witch-like features, all nose and chin, projecting at one\r\nend, the dim, glazed eyes staring from a discoloured and crumbling face.\r\n\r\nThe Baronet had staggered back with a cry and supported himself against\r\na stone sarcophagus.\r\n\r\n\"How came you to know of this?\" he cried.  And then, with some return\r\nof his truculent manner: \"What business is it of yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Sherlock Holmes,\" said my companion.  \"Possibly it is\r\nfamiliar to you.  In any case, my business is that of every other good\r\ncitizen--to uphold the law.  It seems to me that you have much to\r\nanswer for.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert glared for a moment, but Holmes's quiet voice and cool,\r\nassured manner had their effect.\r\n\r\n\"'Fore God, Mr. Holmes, it's all right,\" said he.  \"Appearances are\r\nagainst me, I'll admit, but I could act no otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be happy to think so, but I fear your explanations must be\r\nfor the police.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert shrugged his broad shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if it must be, it must.  Come up to the house and you can judge\r\nfor yourself how the matter stands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nQuarter of an hour later we found ourselves in what I judge, from the\r\nlines of polished barrels behind glass covers, to be the gun-room of\r\nthe old house.  It was comfortably furnished, and here Sir Robert left\r\nus for a few moments.  When he returned he had two companions with him;\r\nthe one, the florid young woman whom we had seen in the carriage; the\r\nother, a small rat-faced man with a disagreeably furtive manner.  These\r\ntwo wore an appearance of utter bewilderment, which showed that the\r\nBaronet had not yet had time to explain to them the turn events had\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said Sir Robert, with a wave of his hand, \"are Mr. and Mrs.\r\nNorlett.  Mrs. Norlett, under her maiden name of Evans, has for some\r\nyears been my sister's confidential maid.  I have brought them here\r\nbecause I feel that my best course is to explain the true position to\r\nyou, and they are the two people upon earth who can substantiate what I\r\nsay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this necessary, Sir Robert?  Have you thought what you are doing?\"\r\ncried the woman.\r\n\r\n\"As to me, I entirely disclaim all responsibility,\" said her husband.\r\n\r\nSir Robert gave him a glance of contempt.  \"I will take all\r\nresponsibility,\" said he.  \"Now, Mr. Holmes, listen to a plain\r\nstatement of the facts.\r\n\r\n\"You have clearly gone pretty deeply into my affairs or I should not\r\nhave found you where I did.  Therefore, you know already, in all\r\nprobability, that I am running a dark horse for the Derby and that\r\neverything depends upon my success.  If I win, all is easy.  If I\r\nlose--well, I dare not think of that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand the position,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"I am dependent upon my sister, Lady Beatrice, for everything.  But it\r\nis well known that her interest in the estate is for her own life only.\r\nFor myself, I am deeply in the hands of the Jews.  I have always known\r\nthat if my sister were to die my creditors would be on to my estate\r\nlike a flock of vultures.  Everything would be seized; my stables, my\r\nhorses--everything.  Well, Mr. Holmes, my sister _did_ die just a week\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you told no one!\"\r\n\r\n\"What could I do?  Absolute ruin faced me.  If I could stave things off\r\nfor three weeks all would be well.  Her maid's husband--this man\r\nhere--is an actor.  It came into our heads--it came into my head--that\r\nhe could for that short period personate my sister.  It was but a case\r\nof appearing daily in the carriage, for no one need enter her room save\r\nthe maid.  It was not difficult to arrange.  My sister died of the\r\ndropsy which had long afflicted her.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be for a coroner to decide.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her doctor would certify that for months her symptoms have threatened\r\nsuch an end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what did you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"The body could not remain there.  On the first night Norlett and I\r\ncarried it out to the old well-house, which is now never used.  We were\r\nfollowed, however, by her pet spaniel, which yapped continually at the\r\ndoor, so I felt some safer place was needed.  I got rid of the spaniel\r\nand we carried the body to the crypt of the church.  There was no\r\nindignity or irreverence, Mr. Holmes.  I do not feel that I have\r\nwronged the dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your conduct seems to me inexcusable, Sir Robert.\"\r\n\r\nThe Baronet shook his head impatiently.  \"It is easy to preach,\" said\r\nhe.  \"Perhaps you would have felt differently if you had been in my\r\nposition.  One cannot see all one's hopes and all one's plans shattered\r\nat the last moment and make no effort to save them.  It seemed to me\r\nthat it would be no unworthy resting-place if we put her for the time\r\nin one of the coffins of her husband's ancestors lying in what is still\r\nconsecrated ground.  We opened such a coffin, removed the contents, and\r\nplaced her as you have seen her.  As to the old relics which we took\r\nout, we could not leave them on the floor of the crypt.  Norlett and I\r\nremoved them, and he descended at night and burned them in the central\r\nfurnace.  There is my story, Mr. Holmes, though how you forced my hand\r\nso that I have to tell it is more than I can say.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes sat for some time lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\"There is one flaw in your narrative, Sir Robert,\" he said at last.\r\n\"Your bets on the race, and therefore your hopes for the future, would\r\nhold good even if your creditors seized your estate.\"\r\n\r\n\"The horse would be part of the estate.  What do they care for my bets?\r\nAs likely as not they would not run him at all.  My chief creditor is,\r\nunhappily, my most bitter enemy--a rascally fellow, Sam Brewer, whom I\r\nwas once compelled to horsewhip on Newmarket Heath.  Do you suppose\r\nthat he would try to save me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sir Robert,\" said Holmes, rising, \"this matter must, of course,\r\nbe referred to the police.  It was my duty to bring the facts to light\r\nand there I must leave it.  As to the morality or decency of your own\r\nconduct, it is not for me to express an opinion.  It is nearly\r\nmidnight, Watson, and I think we may make our way back to our humble\r\nabode.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally known now that this singular episode ended upon a\r\nhappier note than Sir Robert's actions deserved.  Shoscombe Prince did\r\nwin the Derby, the sporting owner did net eighty thousand pounds in\r\nbets, and the creditors did hold their hand until the race was over,\r\nwhen they were paid in full, and enough was left to re-establish Sir\r\nRobert in a fair position in life.  Both police and coroner took a\r\nlenient view of the transaction, and beyond a mild censure for the\r\ndelay in registering the lady's decease, the lucky owner got away\r\nscatheless from this strange incident in a career which has now\r\noutlived its shadows and promises to end in an honoured old age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE RETIRED COLOURMAN\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was in a melancholy and philosophic mood that morning.\r\nHis alert practical nature was subject to such reactions.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see him?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You mean the old fellow who has just gone out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I met him at the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you think of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"A pathetic, futile, broken creature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, Watson.  Pathetic and futile.  But is not all life pathetic\r\nand futile?  Is not his story a microcosm of the whole?  We reach.  We\r\ngrasp.  And what is left in our hands at the end?  A shadow.  Or worse\r\nthan a shadow--misery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he one of your clients?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose I may call him so.  He has been sent on by the Yard.\r\nJust as medical men occasionally send their incurables to a quack.\r\nThey argue that they can do nothing more, and that whatever happens the\r\npatient can be no worse than he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes took a rather soiled card from the table.  \"Josiah Amberley.  He\r\nsays he was junior partner of Brickfall and Amberley, who are\r\nmanufacturers of artistic materials.  You will see their names upon\r\npaint-boxes.  He made his little pile, retired from business at the age\r\nof sixty-one, bought a house at Lewisham, and settled down to rest\r\nafter a life of ceaseless grind.  One would think his future was\r\ntolerably assured.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes glanced over some notes which he had scribbled upon the back of\r\nan envelope.\r\n\r\n\"Retired in 1896, Watson.  Early in 1897 he married a woman twenty\r\nyears younger than himself--a good-looking woman, too, if the\r\nphotograph does not flatter.  A competence, a wife, leisure--it seemed\r\na straight road which lay before him.  And yet within two years he is,\r\nas you have seen, as broken and miserable a creature as crawls beneath\r\nthe sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what has happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"The old story, Watson.  A treacherous friend and a fickle wife.  It\r\nwould appear that Amberley has one hobby in life, and it is chess.  Not\r\nfar from him at Lewisham there lives a young doctor who is also a\r\nchess-player.  I have noted his name as Dr. Ray Ernest.  Ernest was\r\nfrequently in the house, and an intimacy between him and Mrs. Amberley\r\nwas a natural sequence, for you must admit that our unfortunate client\r\nhas few outward graces, whatever his inner virtues may be.  The couple\r\nwent off together last week--destination untraced.  What is more, the\r\nfaithless spouse carried off the old man's deed-box as her personal\r\nluggage with a good part of his life's savings within.  Can we find the\r\nlady?  Can we save the money?  A commonplace problem so far as it has\r\ndeveloped, and yet a vital one for Josiah Amberley.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the immediate question, my dear Watson, happens to be, What will\r\n_you_ do?--if you will be good enough to understudy me.  You know that\r\nI am preoccupied with this case of the two Coptic Patriarchs, which\r\nshould come to a head to-day.  I really have not time to go out to\r\nLewisham, and yet evidence taken on the spot has a special value.  The\r\nold fellow was quite insistent that I should go, but I explained my\r\ndifficulty.  He is prepared to meet a representative.\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means,\" I answered.  \"I confess I don't see that I can be of\r\nmuch service, but I am willing to do my best.\"  And so it was that on a\r\nsummer afternoon I set forth to Lewisham, little dreaming that within a\r\nweek the affair in which I was engaging would be the eager debate of\r\nall England.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late that evening before I returned to Baker Street and gave an\r\naccount of my mission.  Holmes lay with his gaunt figure stretched in\r\nhis deep chair, his pipe curling forth slow wreaths of acrid tobacco,\r\nwhile his eyelids drooped over his eyes so lazily that he might almost\r\nhave been asleep were it not that at any halt or questionable passage\r\nof my narrative they half lifted, and two grey eyes, as bright and keen\r\nas rapiers, transfixed me with their searching glance.\r\n\r\n\"The Haven is the name of Mr. Josiah Amberley's house,\" I explained.\r\n\"I think it would interest you, Holmes.  It is like some penurious\r\npatrician who has sunk into the company of his inferiors.  You know\r\nthat particular quarter, the monotonous brick streets, the weary\r\nsuburban highways.  Right in the middle of them, a little island of\r\nancient culture and comfort, lies this old home, surrounded by a high\r\nsun-baked wall mottled with lichens and topped with moss, the sort of\r\nwall----\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut out the poetry, Watson,\" said Holmes severely.  \"I note that it\r\nwas a high brick wall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  I should not have known which was The Haven had I not asked\r\na lounger who was smoking in the street.  I have a reason for\r\nmentioning him.  He was a tall, dark, heavily-moustached, rather\r\nmilitary-looking man.  He nodded in answer to my inquiry and gave me a\r\ncuriously questioning glance, which came back to my memory a little\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\"I had hardly entered the gateway before I saw Mr. Amberley coming down\r\nthe drive.  I only had a glimpse of him this morning, and he certainly\r\ngave me the impression of a strange creature, but when I saw him in\r\nfull light his appearance was even more abnormal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have, of course, studied it, and yet I should be interested to have\r\nyour impression,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"He seemed to me like a man who was literally bowed down by care.  His\r\nback was curved as though he carried a heavy burden.  Yet he was not\r\nthe weakling that I had at first imagined, for his shoulders and chest\r\nhave the framework of a giant, though his figure tapers away into a\r\npair of spindled legs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Left shoe wrinkled, right one smooth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not observe that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you wouldn't.  I spotted his artificial limb.  But proceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was struck by the snaky locks of grizzled hair which curled from\r\nunder his old straw hat, and his face with its fierce, eager expression\r\nand the deeply-lined features.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Watson.  What did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"He began pouring out the story of his grievances.  We walked down the\r\ndrive together, and of course I took a good look round.  I have never\r\nseen a worse-kept place.  The garden was all running to seed, giving me\r\nan impression of wild neglect in which the plants had been allowed to\r\nfind the way of nature rather than of art.  How any decent woman could\r\nhave tolerated such a state of things, I don't know.  The house, too,\r\nwas slatternly to the last degree, but the poor man seemed himself to\r\nbe aware of it and to be trying to remedy it, for a great pot of green\r\npaint stood in the centre of the hall and he was carrying a thick brush\r\nin his left hand.  He had been working on the woodwork.\r\n\r\n\"He took me into his dingy sanctum, and we had a long chat.  Of course,\r\nhe was disappointed that you had not come yourself.  'I hardly\r\nexpected,' he said, 'that so humble an individual as myself, especially\r\nafter my heavy financial loss, could obtain the complete attention of\r\nso famous a man as Mr. Sherlock Holmes.'\r\n\r\n\"I assured him that the financial question did not arise.  'No, of\r\ncourse, it is art for art's sake with him,' said he; 'but even on the\r\nartistic side of crime he might have found something here to study.\r\nAnd human nature, Dr. Watson--the black ingratitude of it all!  When\r\ndid I ever refuse one of her requests?  Was ever a woman so pampered?\r\nAnd that young man--he might have been my own son.  He had the run of\r\nmy house.  And yet see how they have treated me!  Oh, Dr. Watson, it is\r\na dreadful, dreadful world!'\r\n\r\n\"That was the burden of his song for an hour or more.  He had, it\r\nseems, no suspicion of an intrigue.  They lived alone save for a woman\r\nwho comes in by the day and leaves every evening at six.  On that\r\nparticular evening old Amberley, wishing to give his wife a treat, had\r\ntaken two upper circle seats at the Haymarket Theatre.  At the last\r\nmoment she had complained of a headache and had refused to go.  He had\r\ngone alone.  There seemed to be no doubt about the fact, for he\r\nproduced the unused ticket which he had taken for his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is remarkable--most remarkable,\" said Holmes, whose interest in\r\nthe case seemed to be rising.  \"Pray continue, Watson.  I find your\r\nnarrative most arresting.  Did you personally examine this ticket?  You\r\ndid not, perchance, take the number?\"\r\n\r\n\"It so happens that I did,\" I answered with some pride.  \"It chanced to\r\nbe my old school number, thirty-one, and so it stuck in my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent, Watson!  His seat, then, was either thirty or thirty-two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" I answered, with some mystification.  \"And on B row.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is most satisfactory.  What else did he tell you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He showed me his strong-room, as he called it.  It really is a\r\nstrong-room--like a bank--with iron door and shutter--burglar-proof, as\r\nhe claimed.  However, the woman seems to have had a duplicate key, and\r\nbetween them they had carried off some seven thousand pounds' worth of\r\ncash and securities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Securities!  How could they dispose of those?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said that he had given the police a list and that he hoped they\r\nwould be unsalable.  He had got back from the theatre about midnight,\r\nand found the place plundered, the door and window open and the\r\nfugitives gone.  There was no letter or message, nor has he heard a\r\nword since.  He at once gave the alarm to the police.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes brooded for some minutes.\r\n\r\n\"You say he was painting.  What was he painting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he was painting the passage.  But he had already painted the\r\ndoor and woodwork of this room I spoke of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it not strike you as a strange occupation in the circumstances?\"\r\n\r\n\"'One must do something to ease an aching heart.'  That was his own\r\nexplanation.  It was eccentric, no doubt, but he is clearly an\r\neccentric man.  He tore up one of his wife's photographs in my\r\npresence--tore it up furiously in a tempest of passion.  'I never wish\r\nto see her damned face again,' he shrieked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything more, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, one thing which struck me more than anything else.  I had driven\r\nto the Blackheath Station and had caught my train there, when just as\r\nit was starting I saw a man dart into the carriage next to my own.  You\r\nknow that I have a quick eye for faces, Holmes.  It was undoubtedly the\r\ntall, dark man whom I had addressed in the street.  I saw him once more\r\nat London Bridge, and then I lost him in the crowd.  But I am convinced\r\nthat he was following me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt!  No doubt!\" said Holmes.  \"A tall, dark, heavily-moustached\r\nman, you say, with grey-tinted sun-glasses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Holmes, you are a wizard.  I did not say so, but he had grey-tinted\r\nsun-glasses.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a Masonic tie-pin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Holmes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite simple, my dear Watson.  But let us get down to what is\r\npractical.  I must admit to you that the case, which seemed to me to be\r\nso absurdly simple as to be hardly worth my notice, is rapidly assuming\r\na very different aspect.  It is true that though in your mission you\r\nhave missed everything of importance, yet even those things which have\r\nobtruded themselves upon your notice give rise to serious thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have I missed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be hurt, my dear fellow.  You know that I am quite impersonal.\r\nNo one else would have done better.  Some possibly not so well.  But\r\nclearly you have missed some vital points.  What is the opinion of the\r\nneighbours about this man Amberley and his wife?  That surely is of\r\nimportance.  What of Dr. Ernest?  Was he the gay Lothario one would\r\nexpect?  With your natural advantages, Watson, every lady is your\r\nhelper and accomplice.  What about the girl at the post office, or the\r\nwife of the greengrocer?  I can picture you whispering soft nothings\r\nwith the young lady at the 'Blue Anchor,' and receiving hard somethings\r\nin exchange.  All this you have left undone.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can still be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been done.  Thanks to the telephone and the help of the Yard, I\r\ncan usually get my essentials without leaving this room.  As a matter\r\nof fact, my information confirms the man's story.  He has the local\r\nrepute of being a miser as well as a harsh and exacting husband.  That\r\nhe had a large sum of money in that strong-room of his is certain.  So\r\nalso is it that young Dr. Ernest, an unmarried man, played chess with\r\nAmberley, and probably played the fool with his wife.  All this seems\r\nplain sailing, and one would think that there was no more to be\r\nsaid--and yet!--and yet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where lies the difficulty?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my imagination, perhaps.  Well, leave it there, Watson.  Let us\r\nescape from this weary workaday world by the side door of music.\r\nCarina sings to-night at the Albert Hall, and we still have time to\r\ndress, dine and enjoy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning I was up betimes, but some toast crumbs and two empty\r\negg-shells told me that my companion was earlier still.  I found a\r\nscribbled note upon the table.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR WATSON,--\r\n\r\nThere are one or two points of contact which I should wish to establish\r\nwith Mr. Josiah Amberley.  When I have done so we can dismiss the\r\ncase--or not.  I would only ask you to be on hand about three o'clock,\r\nas I conceive it possible that I may want you.\r\n\r\nS. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw nothing of Holmes all day, but at the hour named he returned,\r\ngrave, preoccupied and aloof.  At such times it was wiser to leave him\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\n\"Has Amberley been here yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  I am expecting him.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not disappointed, for presently the old fellow arrived with a\r\nvery worried and puzzled expression upon his austere face.\r\n\r\n\"I've had a telegram, Mr. Holmes.  I can make nothing of it.\"  He\r\nhanded it over, and Holmes read it aloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Come at once without fail.  Can give you information as to your recent\r\nloss.--ELMAN.  The Vicarage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Dispatched at two-ten from Little Turlington,\" said Holmes.  \"Little\r\nTurlington is in Essex, I believe, not far from Frinton.  Well, of\r\ncourse you will start at once.  This is evidently from a responsible\r\nperson, the vicar of the place.  Where is my Crockford?  Yes, here we\r\nhave him.  J. C. Elman, M.A., Living of Mossmoor cum Little Purlington.\r\nLook up the trains, Watson.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one at five-twenty from Liverpool Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent.  You had best go with him, Watson.  He may need help or\r\nadvice.  Clearly we have come to a crisis in this affair.\"\r\n\r\nBut our client seemed by no means eager to start.\r\n\r\n\"It's perfectly absurd, Mr. Holmes,\" he said.  \"What can this man\r\npossibly know of what has occurred?  It is waste of time and money.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would not have telegraphed to you if he did not know something.\r\nWire at once that you are coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I shall go.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes assumed his sternest aspect.\r\n\r\n\"It would make the worst possible impression both on the police and\r\nupon myself, Mr. Amberley, if when so obvious a clue arose you should\r\nrefuse to follow it up.  We should feel that you were not really in\r\nearnest in this investigation.\"\r\n\r\nOur client seemed horrified at the suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course I shall go if you look at it in that way,\" said he.\r\n\"On the face of it, it seems absurd to suppose that this parson knows\r\nanything, but if you think----\"\r\n\r\n\"I _do_ think,\" said Holmes, with emphasis, and so we were launched\r\nupon our journey.  Holmes took me aside before we left the room and\r\ngave me one word of counsel which showed that he considered the matter\r\nto be of importance.  \"Whatever you do, see that he really _does_ go,\"\r\nsaid he.  \"Should he break away or return, get to the nearest telephone\r\nexchange and send the single word 'Bolted.'  I will arrange here that\r\nit shall reach me wherever I am.\"\r\n\r\nLittle Purlington is not an easy place to reach, for it is on a branch\r\nline.  My remembrance of the journey is not a pleasant one, for the\r\nweather was hot, the train slow, and my companion sullen and silent,\r\nhardly talking at all, save to make an occasional sardonic remark as to\r\nthe futility of our proceedings.  When we at last reached the little\r\nstation it was a two-mile drive before we came to the Vicarage, where a\r\nbig, solemn, rather pompous clergyman received us in his study.  Our\r\ntelegram lay before him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" he asked, \"what can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We came,\" I explained, \"in answer to your wire.\"\r\n\r\n\"My wire!  I sent no wire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean the wire which you sent to Mr. Josiah Amberley about his wife\r\nand his money.\"\r\n\r\n\"If this is a joke, sir, it is a very questionable one,\" said the vicar\r\nangrily.  \"I have never heard of the gentleman you name, and I have not\r\nsent a wire to anyone.\"\r\n\r\nOur client and I looked at each other in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps there is some mistake,\" said I; \"are there perhaps two\r\nvicarages?  Here is the wire itself, signed Elman, and dated from the\r\nVicarage.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is only one vicarage, sir, and only one vicar, and this wire is\r\na scandalous forgery, the origin of which shall certainly be\r\ninvestigated by the police.  Meanwhile, I can see no possible object in\r\nprolonging this interview.\"\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Amberley and I found ourselves on the roadside in what seemed to\r\nme to be the most primitive village in England.  We made for the\r\ntelegraph office, but it was already closed.  There was a telephone,\r\nhowever, at the little 'Railway Arms,' and by it I got into touch with\r\nHolmes, who shared in our amazement at the result of our journey.\r\n\r\n\"Most singular!\" said the distant voice.  \"Most remarkable!  I much\r\nfear, my dear Watson, that there is no return train to-night.  I have\r\nunwittingly condemned you to the horrors of a country inn.  However,\r\nthere is always Nature, Watson--Nature and Josiah Amberley--you can be\r\nin close commune with both.\"  I heard his dry chuckle as he turned away.\r\n\r\nIt was soon apparent to me that my companion's reputation as a miser\r\nwas not undeserved.  He had grumbled at the expense of the journey, had\r\ninsisted upon travelling third-class, and was now clamorous in his\r\nobjections to the hotel bill.  Next morning, when we did at last arrive\r\nin London, it was hard to say which of us was in the worse humour.\r\n\r\n\"You had best take Baker Street as we pass,\" said I.  \"Mr. Holmes may\r\nhave some fresh instructions.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they are not worth more than the last ones they are not of much\r\nuse,\" said Amberley, with a malevolent scowl.  None the less, he kept\r\nme company.  I had already warned Holmes by telegram of the hour of our\r\narrival, but we found a message waiting that he was at Lewisham, and\r\nwould expect us there.  That was a surprise, but an even greater one\r\nwas to find that he was not alone in the sitting-room of our client.  A\r\nstern-looking, impassive man sat beside him, a dark man with\r\ngrey-tinted glasses and a large Masonic pin projecting from his tie.\r\n\r\n\"This is my friend Mr. Barker,\" said Holmes.  \"He has been interesting\r\nhimself also in your business, Mr. Josiah Amberley, though we have been\r\nworking independently.  But we both have the same question to ask you!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Amberley sat down heavily.  He sensed impending danger.  I read it\r\nin his straining eyes and his twitching features.\r\n\r\n\"What is the question, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only this: What did you do with the bodies?\"\r\n\r\nThe man sprang to his feet with a hoarse scream.  He clawed into the\r\nair with his bony hands.  His mouth was open, and for the instant he\r\nlooked like some horrible bird of prey.  In a flash we got a glimpse of\r\nthe real Josiah Amberley, a misshapen demon with a soul as distorted as\r\nhis body.  As he fell back into his chair he clapped his hand to his\r\nlips as if to stifle a cough.  Holmes sprang at his throat like a\r\ntiger, and twisted his face towards the ground.  A white pellet fell\r\nfrom between his gasping lips.\r\n\r\n\"No short cuts, Josiah Amberley.  Things must be done decently and in\r\norder.  What about it, Barker?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a cab at the door,\" said our taciturn companion.\r\n\r\n\"It is only a few hundred yards to the station.  We will go together.\r\nYou can stay here, Watson.  I shall be back within half an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old colourman had the strength of a lion in that great trunk of\r\nhis, but he was helpless in the hands of the two experienced\r\nman-handlers.  Wriggling and twisting he was dragged to the waiting\r\ncab, and I was left to my solitary vigil in the ill-omened house.  In\r\nless time than he had named, however, Holmes was back, in company with\r\na smart young police inspector.\r\n\r\n\"I've left Barker to look after the formalities,\" said Holmes.  \"You\r\nhad not met Barker, Watson.  He is my hated rival upon the Surrey\r\nshore.  When you said a tall dark man it was not difficult for me to\r\ncomplete the picture.  He has several good cases to his credit, has he\r\nnot, Inspector?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has certainly interfered several times,\" the Inspector answered\r\nwith reserve.\r\n\r\n\"His methods are irregular, no doubt, like my own.  The irregulars are\r\nuseful sometimes, you know.  You, for example, with your compulsory\r\nwarning about whatever he said being used against him, could never have\r\nbluffed this rascal into what is virtually a confession.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not.  But we get there all the same, Mr. Holmes.  Don't\r\nimagine that we had not formed our own views of this case, and that we\r\nwould not have laid our hands on our man.  You will excuse us for\r\nfeeling sore when you jump in with methods which we cannot use, and so\r\nrob us of the credit.\"\r\n\r\n\"There shall be no such robbery, MacKinnon.  I assure you that I efface\r\nmyself from now onwards, and as to Barker, he has done nothing save\r\nwhat I told him.\"\r\n\r\nThe Inspector seemed considerably relieved.\r\n\r\n\"That is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes.  Praise or blame can matter\r\nlittle to you, but it is very different to us when the newspapers begin\r\nto ask questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.  But they are pretty sure to ask questions anyhow, so it\r\nwould be as well to have answers.  What will you say, for example, when\r\nthe intelligent and enterprising reporter asks you what the exact\r\npoints were which aroused your suspicion, and finally gave you a\r\ncertain conviction as to the real facts?\"\r\n\r\nThe Inspector looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"We don't seem to have got any real facts yet, Mr. Holmes.  You say\r\nthat the prisoner, in the presence of three witnesses, practically\r\nconfessed, by trying to commit suicide, that he had murdered his wife\r\nand her lover.  What other facts have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you arranged for a search?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are three constables on their way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will soon get the clearest fact of all.  The bodies cannot be\r\nfar away.  Try the cellars and the garden.  It should not take long to\r\ndig up the likely places.  This house is older than the water-pipes.\r\nThere must be a disused well somewhere.  Try your luck there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did you know of it, and how was it done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll show you first how it was done, and then I will give the\r\nexplanation which is due to you, and even more to my long-suffering\r\nfriend here, who has been invaluable throughout.  But, first, I would\r\ngive you an insight into this man's mentality.  It is a very unusual\r\none--so much so that I think his destination is more likely to be\r\nBroadmoor than the scaffold.  He has, to a high degree, the sort of\r\nmind which one associates with the mediæval Italian nature rather than\r\nwith the modern Briton.  He was a miserable miser who made his wife so\r\nwretched by his niggardly ways that she was a ready prey for any\r\nadventurer.  Such a one came upon the scene in the person of this\r\nchess-playing doctor.  Amberley excelled at chess--one mark, Watson, of\r\na scheming mind.  Like all misers, he was a jealous man, and his\r\njealousy became a frantic mania.  Rightly or wrongly, he suspected an\r\nintrigue.  He determined to have his revenge, and he planned it with\r\ndiabolical cleverness.  Come here!\"\r\n\r\nHolmes led us along the passage with as much certainty as if he had\r\nlived in the house, and halted at the open door of the strong-room.\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!  What an awful smell of paint!\" cried the Inspector.\r\n\r\n\"That was our first clue,\" said Holmes.  \"You can thank Dr. Watson's\r\nobservation for that, though he failed to draw the inference.  It set\r\nmy foot upon the trail.  Why should this man at such a time be filling\r\nhis house with strong odours?  Obviously, to cover some other smell\r\nwhich he wished to conceal--some guilty smell which would suggest\r\nsuspicions.  Then came the idea of a room such as you see here with\r\niron door and shutter--a hermetically sealed room.  Put those two facts\r\ntogether, and whither do they lead?  I could only determine that by\r\nexamining the house myself.  I was already certain that the case was\r\nserious, for I had examined the box-office chart at the Haymarket\r\nTheatre--another of Dr. Watson's bull's-eyes--and ascertained that\r\nneither B thirty nor thirty-two of the upper circle had been occupied\r\nthat night.  Therefore, Amberley had not been to the theatre, and his\r\nalibi fell to the ground.  He made a bad slip when he allowed my astute\r\nfriend to notice the number of the seat taken for his wife.  The\r\nquestion now arose how I might be able to examine the house.  I sent an\r\nagent to the most impossible village I could think of, and summoned my\r\nman to it at such an hour that he could not possibly get back.  To\r\nprevent any miscarriage, Dr. Watson accompanied him.  The good vicar's\r\nname I took, of course, out of my Crockford.  Do I make it all clear to\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is masterly,\" said the Inspector, in an awed voice.\r\n\r\n\"There being no fear of interruption I proceeded to burgle the house.\r\nBurglary has always been an alternative profession, had I cared to\r\nadopt it, and I have little doubt that I should have come to the front.\r\nObserve what I found.  You see the gas-pipe along the skirting here.\r\nVery good.  It rises in the angle of the wall, and there is a tap here\r\nin the corner.  The pipe runs out into the strong-room, as you can see,\r\nand ends in that plaster rose in the centre of the ceiling, where it is\r\nconcealed by the ornamentation.  That end is wide open.  At any moment\r\nby turning the outside tap the room could be flooded with gas.  With\r\ndoor and shutter closed and the tap full on I would not give two\r\nminutes of conscious sensation to anyone shut up in that little\r\nchamber.  By what devilish device he decoyed them there I do not know,\r\nbut once inside the door they were at his mercy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Inspector examined the pipe with interest.  \"One of our officers\r\nmentioned the smell of gas,\" said he, \"but, of course, the window and\r\ndoor were open then, and the paint--or some of it--was already about.\r\nHe had begun the work of painting the day before, according to his\r\nstory.  But what next, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then came an incident which was rather unexpected to myself.  I\r\nwas slipping through the pantry window in the early dawn when I felt a\r\nhand inside my collar, and a voice said: 'Now, you rascal, what are you\r\ndoing in there?'  When I could twist my head round I looked into the\r\ntinted spectacles of my friend and rival, Mr. Barker.  It was a curious\r\nforgathering, and set us both smiling.  It seems that he had been\r\nengaged by Dr. Ray Ernest's family to make some investigations, and had\r\ncome to the same conclusion as to foul play.  He had watched the house\r\nfor some days, and had spotted Dr. Watson as one of the obviously\r\nsuspicious characters who had called there.  He could hardly arrest\r\nWatson, but when he saw a man actually climbing out of the pantry\r\nwindow there came a limit to his restraint.  Of course, I told him how\r\nmatters stood and we continued the case together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why him?  Why not us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it was in my mind to put that little test which answered so\r\nadmirably.  I fear you would not have gone so far.\"\r\n\r\nThe Inspector smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe not.  I understand that I have your word, Mr. Holmes, that\r\nyou step right out of the case now and that you turn all your results\r\nover to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, that is always my custom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, in the name of the Force I thank you.  It seems a clear case, as\r\nyou put it, and there can't be much difficulty over the bodies.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll show you a grim little bit of evidence,\" said Holmes, \"and I am\r\nsure Amberley himself never observed it.  You'll get results,\r\nInspector, by always putting yourself in the other fellow's place, and\r\nthinking what you would do yourself.  It takes some imagination, but it\r\npays.  Now, we will suppose that you were shut up in this little room,\r\nhad not two minutes to live, but wanted to get even with the fiend who\r\nwas probably mocking at you from the other side of the door.  What\r\nwould you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Write a message.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  You would like to tell people how you died.  No use writing\r\non paper.  That would be seen.  If you wrote on the wall some eye might\r\nrest upon it.  Now, look here!  Just above the skirting is scribbled\r\nwith a purple indelible pencil: 'We we----'  That's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's only a foot above the ground.  The poor devil was on the\r\nfloor and dying when he wrote it.  He lost his senses before he could\r\nfinish.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was writing, 'We were murdered.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That's how I read it.  If you find an indelible pencil on the body----\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll look out for it, you may be sure.  But those securities?\r\nClearly there was no robbery at all.  And yet he _did_ possess those\r\nbonds.  We verified that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be sure he has them hidden in a safe place.  When the whole\r\nelopement had passed into history he would suddenly discover them, and\r\nannounce that the guilty couple had relented and sent back the plunder\r\nor had dropped it on the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly seem to have met every difficulty,\" said the Inspector.\r\n\"Of course, he was bound to call us in, but why he should have gone to\r\nyou I can't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pure swank!\" Holmes answered.  \"He felt so clever and so sure of\r\nhimself that he imagined no one could touch him.  He could say to any\r\nsuspicious neighbour, 'Look at the steps I have taken.  I have\r\nconsulted not only the police, but even Sherlock Holmes.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Inspector laughed.\r\n\r\n\"We must forgive you your 'even,' Mr. Holmes,\" said he; \"it's as\r\nworkmanlike a job as I can remember.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA couple of days later my friend tossed across to me a copy of the\r\nbi-weekly _North Surrey Observer_.  Under a series of flaming\r\nheadlines, which began with \"The Haven Horror\" and ended with\r\n\"Brilliant Police Investigation,\" there was a packed column of print\r\nwhich gave the first consecutive account of the affair.  The concluding\r\nparagraph is typical of the whole.  It ran thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The remarkable acumen by which Inspector MacKinnon deduced from the\r\nsmell of paint that some other smell, that of gas, for example, might\r\nbe concealed; the bold deduction that the strongroom might also be the\r\ndeath-chamber, and the subsequent inquiry which led to the discovery of\r\nthe bodies in a disused well, cleverly concealed by a dog-kennel,\r\nshould live in the history of crime as a standing example of the\r\nintelligence of our professional detectives.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, MacKinnon is a good fellow,\" said Holmes, with a tolerant\r\nsmile.  \"You can file it in our archives, Watson.  Some day the true\r\nstory may be told.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinted in Great Britain by Butler & Tanner Ltd., Frome and London\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  By A.
