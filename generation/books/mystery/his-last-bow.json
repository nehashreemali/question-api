He has, for many years, lived in a small farm upon the\r\nDowns five miles from Eastbourne, where his time is divided between\r\nphilosophy and agriculture. During this period of rest he has refused\r\nthe most princely offers to take up various cases, having determined\r\nthat his retirement was a permanent one. The approach of the German war\r\ncaused him, however, to lay his remarkable combination of intellectual\r\nand practical activity at the disposal of the Government, with\r\nhistorical results which are recounted in _His Last Bow_. Several\r\nprevious experiences which have lain long in my portfolio have been\r\nadded to _His Last Bow_ so as to complete the volume.\r\n\r\nJohn H.

The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles\r\n\r\nI find it recorded in my notebook that it was a bleak and windy day\r\ntowards the end of March in the year 1892. Holmes had received a\r\ntelegram while we sat at our lunch, and he had scribbled a reply. He\r\nmade no remark, but the matter remained in his thoughts, for he stood\r\nin front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face, smoking his\r\npipe, and casting an occasional glance at the message. Suddenly he\r\nturned upon me with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I suppose, Watson, we must look upon you as a man of letters,” said\r\nhe. “How do you define the word ‘grotesque’?”\r\n\r\n“Strange—remarkable,” I suggested.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head at my definition.\r\n\r\n“There is surely something more than that,” said he; “some underlying\r\nsuggestion of the tragic and the terrible. If you cast your mind back\r\nto some of those narratives with which you have afflicted a\r\nlong-suffering public, you will recognise how often the grotesque has\r\ndeepened into the criminal. Think of that little affair of the\r\nred-headed men. That was grotesque enough in the outset, and yet it\r\nended in a desperate attempt at robbery. Or, again, there was that most\r\ngrotesque affair of the five orange pips, which led straight to a\r\nmurderous conspiracy. The word puts me on the alert.”\r\n\r\n“Have you it there?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHe read the telegram aloud.\r\n\r\n“Have just had most incredible and grotesque experience. May I consult\r\nyou?\r\n\r\n“Scott Eccles,\r\n“Post Office, Charing Cross.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Man or woman?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, man, of course. No woman would ever send a reply-paid telegram.\r\nShe would have come.”\r\n\r\n“Will you see him?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Watson, you know how bored I have been since we locked up\r\nColonel Carruthers. My mind is like a racing engine, tearing itself to\r\npieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it was\r\nbuilt. Life is commonplace, the papers are sterile; audacity and\r\nromance seem to have passed forever from the criminal world. Can you\r\nask me, then, whether I am ready to look into any new problem, however\r\ntrivial it may prove? But here, unless I am mistaken, is our client.”\r\n\r\nA measured step was heard upon the stairs, and a moment later a stout,\r\ntall, grey-whiskered and solemnly respectable person was ushered into\r\nthe room. His life history was written in his heavy features and\r\npompous manner. From his spats to his gold-rimmed spectacles he was a\r\nConservative, a churchman, a good citizen, orthodox and conventional to\r\nthe last degree. But some amazing experience had disturbed his native\r\ncomposure and left its traces in his bristling hair, his flushed, angry\r\ncheeks, and his flurried, excited manner. He plunged instantly into his\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n“I have had a most singular and unpleasant experience, Mr. Holmes,”\r\nsaid he. “Never in my life have I been placed in such a situation. It\r\nis most improper—most outrageous. I must insist upon some explanation.”\r\nHe swelled and puffed in his anger.\r\n\r\n“Pray sit down, Mr. Scott Eccles,” said Holmes in a soothing voice.\r\n“May I ask, in the first place, why you came to me at all?”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, it did not appear to be a matter which concerned the\r\npolice, and yet, when you have heard the facts, you must admit that I\r\ncould not leave it where it was. Private detectives are a class with\r\nwhom I have absolutely no sympathy, but none the less, having heard\r\nyour name—”\r\n\r\n“Quite so. But, in the second place, why did you not come at once?”\r\n\r\nHolmes glanced at his watch.\r\n\r\n“It is a quarter-past two,” he said. “Your telegram was dispatched\r\nabout one. But no one can glance at your toilet and attire without\r\nseeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking.”\r\n\r\nOur client smoothed down his unbrushed hair and felt his unshaven chin.\r\n\r\n“You are right, Mr. Holmes. I never gave a thought to my toilet. I was\r\nonly too glad to get out of such a house. But I have been running round\r\nmaking inquiries before I came to you. I went to the house agents, you\r\nknow, and they said that Mr. Garcia’s rent was paid up all right and\r\nthat everything was in order at Wisteria Lodge.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, sir,” said Holmes, laughing. “You are like my friend, Dr.\r\nWatson, who has a bad habit of telling his stories wrong end foremost.\r\nPlease arrange your thoughts and let me know, in their due sequence,\r\nexactly what those events are which have sent you out unbrushed and\r\nunkempt, with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry, in search of\r\nadvice and assistance.”\r\n\r\nOur client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure it must look very bad, Mr. Holmes, and I am not aware that in\r\nmy whole life such a thing has ever happened before. But I will tell\r\nyou the whole queer business, and when I have done so you will admit, I\r\nam sure, that there has been enough to excuse me.”\r\n\r\nBut his narrative was nipped in the bud. There was a bustle outside,\r\nand Mrs. Hudson opened the door to usher in two robust and\r\nofficial-looking individuals, one of whom was well known to us as\r\nInspector Gregson of Scotland Yard, an energetic, gallant, and, within\r\nhis limitations, a capable officer. He shook hands with Holmes and\r\nintroduced his comrade as Inspector Baynes, of the Surrey Constabulary.\r\n\r\n“We are hunting together, Mr. Holmes, and our trail lay in this\r\ndirection.” He turned his bulldog eyes upon our visitor. “Are you Mr.\r\nJohn Scott Eccles, of Popham House, Lee?”\r\n\r\n“I am.”\r\n\r\n“We have been following you about all the morning.”\r\n\r\n“You traced him through the telegram, no doubt,” said Holmes.\r\n\r\n“Exactly, Mr. Holmes. We picked up the scent at Charing Cross\r\nPost-Office and came on here.”\r\n\r\n“But why do you follow me? What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“We wish a statement, Mr. Scott Eccles, as to the events which led up\r\nto the death last night of Mr. Aloysius Garcia, of Wisteria Lodge, near\r\nEsher.”\r\n\r\nOur client had sat up with staring eyes and every tinge of colour\r\nstruck from his astonished face.\r\n\r\n“Dead? Did you say he was dead?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, he is dead.”\r\n\r\n“But how? An accident?”\r\n\r\n“Murder, if ever there was one upon earth.”\r\n\r\n“Good God! This is awful! You don’t mean—you don’t mean that I am\r\nsuspected?”\r\n\r\n“A letter of yours was found in the dead man’s pocket, and we know by\r\nit that you had planned to pass last night at his house.”\r\n\r\n“So I did.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you did, did you?”\r\n\r\nOut came the official notebook.\r\n\r\n“Wait a bit, Gregson,” said Sherlock Holmes. “All you desire is a plain\r\nstatement, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“And it is my duty to warn Mr. Scott Eccles that it may be used against\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Eccles was going to tell us about it when you entered the room. I\r\nthink, Watson, a brandy and soda would do him no harm. Now, sir, I\r\nsuggest that you take no notice of this addition to your audience, and\r\nthat you proceed with your narrative exactly as you would have done had\r\nyou never been interrupted.”\r\n\r\nOur visitor had gulped off the brandy and the colour had returned to\r\nhis face. With a dubious glance at the inspector’s notebook, he plunged\r\nat once into his extraordinary statement.\r\n\r\n“I am a bachelor,” said he, “and being of a sociable turn I cultivate a\r\nlarge number of friends. Among these are the family of a retired brewer\r\ncalled Melville, living at Abermarle Mansion, Kensington. It was at his\r\ntable that I met some weeks ago a young fellow named Garcia. He was, I\r\nunderstood, of Spanish descent and connected in some way with the\r\nembassy. He spoke perfect English, was pleasing in his manners, and as\r\ngood-looking a man as ever I saw in my life.\r\n\r\n“In some way we struck up quite a friendship, this young fellow and I.\r\nHe seemed to take a fancy to me from the first, and within two days of\r\nour meeting he came to see me at Lee. One thing led to another, and it\r\nended in his inviting me out to spend a few days at his house, Wisteria\r\nLodge, between Esher and Oxshott. Yesterday evening I went to Esher to\r\nfulfil this engagement.\r\n\r\n“He had described his household to me before I went there. He lived\r\nwith a faithful servant, a countryman of his own, who looked after all\r\nhis needs. This fellow could speak English and did his housekeeping for\r\nhim. Then there was a wonderful cook, he said, a half-breed whom he had\r\npicked up in his travels, who could serve an excellent dinner. I\r\nremember that he remarked what a queer household it was to find in the\r\nheart of Surrey, and that I agreed with him, though it has proved a\r\ngood deal queerer than I thought.\r\n\r\n“I drove to the place—about two miles on the south side of Esher. The\r\nhouse was a fair-sized one, standing back from the road, with a curving\r\ndrive which was banked with high evergreen shrubs. It was an old,\r\ntumbledown building in a crazy state of disrepair. When the trap pulled\r\nup on the grass-grown drive in front of the blotched and\r\nweather-stained door, I had doubts as to my wisdom in visiting a man\r\nwhom I knew so slightly. He opened the door himself, however, and\r\ngreeted me with a great show of cordiality. I was handed over to the\r\nmanservant, a melancholy, swarthy individual, who led the way, my bag\r\nin his hand, to my bedroom. The whole place was depressing. Our dinner\r\nwas _tête-à-tête_, and though my host did his best to be entertaining,\r\nhis thoughts seemed to continually wander, and he talked so vaguely and\r\nwildly that I could hardly understand him. He continually drummed his\r\nfingers on the table, gnawed his nails, and gave other signs of nervous\r\nimpatience. The dinner itself was neither well served nor well cooked,\r\nand the gloomy presence of the taciturn servant did not help to enliven\r\nus. I can assure you that many times in the course of the evening I\r\nwished that I could invent some excuse which would take me back to Lee.\r\n\r\n“One thing comes back to my memory which may have a bearing upon the\r\nbusiness that you two gentlemen are investigating. I thought nothing of\r\nit at the time. Near the end of dinner a note was handed in by the\r\nservant. I noticed that after my host had read it he seemed even more\r\ndistrait and strange than before. He gave up all pretence at\r\nconversation and sat, smoking endless cigarettes, lost in his own\r\nthoughts, but he made no remark as to the contents. About eleven I was\r\nglad to go to bed. Some time later Garcia looked in at my door—the room\r\nwas dark at the time—and asked me if I had rung. I said that I had not.\r\nHe apologised for having disturbed me so late, saying that it was\r\nnearly one o’clock. I dropped off after this and slept soundly all\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n“And now I come to the amazing part of my tale. When I woke it was\r\nbroad daylight. I glanced at my watch, and the time was nearly nine. I\r\nhad particularly asked to be called at eight, so I was very much\r\nastonished at this forgetfulness. I sprang up and rang for the servant.\r\nThere was no response. I rang again and again, with the same result.\r\nThen I came to the conclusion that the bell was out of order. I huddled\r\non my clothes and hurried downstairs in an exceedingly bad temper to\r\norder some hot water. You can imagine my surprise when I found that\r\nthere was no one there. I shouted in the hall. There was no answer.\r\nThen I ran from room to room. All were deserted. My host had shown me\r\nwhich was his bedroom the night before, so I knocked at the door. No\r\nreply. I turned the handle and walked in. The room was empty, and the\r\nbed had never been slept in. He had gone with the rest. The foreign\r\nhost, the foreign footman, the foreign cook, all had vanished in the\r\nnight! That was the end of my visit to Wisteria Lodge.”\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was rubbing his hands and chuckling as he added this\r\nbizarre incident to his collection of strange episodes.\r\n\r\n“Your experience is, so far as I know, perfectly unique,” said he. “May\r\nI ask, sir, what you did then?”\r\n\r\n“I was furious. My first idea was that I had been the victim of some\r\nabsurd practical joke. I packed my things, banged the hall door behind\r\nme, and set off for Esher, with my bag in my hand. I called at Allan\r\nBrothers’, the chief land agents in the village, and found that it was\r\nfrom this firm that the villa had been rented. It struck me that the\r\nwhole proceeding could hardly be for the purpose of making a fool of\r\nme, and that the main object must be to get out of the rent. It is late\r\nin March, so quarter-day is at hand. But this theory would not work.\r\nThe agent was obliged to me for my warning, but told me that the rent\r\nhad been paid in advance. Then I made my way to town and called at the\r\nSpanish embassy. The man was unknown there. After this I went to see\r\nMelville, at whose house I had first met Garcia, but I found that he\r\nreally knew rather less about him than I did. Finally when I got your\r\nreply to my wire I came out to you, since I gather that you are a\r\nperson who gives advice in difficult cases. But now, Mr. Inspector, I\r\nunderstand, from what you said when you entered the room, that you can\r\ncarry the story on, and that some tragedy had occurred. I can assure\r\nyou that every word I have said is the truth, and that, outside of what\r\nI have told you, I know absolutely nothing about the fate of this man.\r\nMy only desire is to help the law in every possible way.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure of it, Mr. Scott Eccles—I am sure of it,” said Inspector\r\nGregson in a very amiable tone. “I am bound to say that everything\r\nwhich you have said agrees very closely with the facts as they have\r\ncome to our notice. For example, there was that note which arrived\r\nduring dinner. Did you chance to observe what became of it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did. Garcia rolled it up and threw it into the fire.”\r\n\r\n“What do you say to that, Mr. Baynes?”\r\n\r\nThe country detective was a stout, puffy, red man, whose face was only\r\nredeemed from grossness by two extraordinarily bright eyes, almost\r\nhidden behind the heavy creases of cheek and brow. With a slow smile he\r\ndrew a folded and discoloured scrap of paper from his pocket.\r\n\r\n“It was a dog-grate, Mr. Holmes, and he overpitched it. I picked this\r\nout unburned from the back of it.”\r\n\r\nHolmes smiled his appreciation.\r\n\r\n“You must have examined the house very carefully to find a single\r\npellet of paper.”\r\n\r\n“I did, Mr. Holmes. It’s my way. Shall I read it, Mr. Gregson?”\r\n\r\nThe Londoner nodded.\r\n\r\n“The note is written upon ordinary cream-laid paper without watermark.\r\nIt is a quarter-sheet. The paper is cut off in two snips with a\r\nshort-bladed scissors. It has been folded over three times and sealed\r\nwith purple wax, put on hurriedly and pressed down with some flat oval\r\nobject. It is addressed to Mr. Garcia, Wisteria Lodge. It says:\r\n\r\n“Our own colours, green and white. Green open, white shut. Main stair,\r\nfirst corridor, seventh right, green baize. Godspeed. D.\r\n\r\n“It is a woman’s writing, done with a sharp-pointed pen, but the\r\naddress is either done with another pen or by someone else. It is\r\nthicker and bolder, as you see.”\r\n\r\n“A very remarkable note,” said Holmes, glancing it over. “I must\r\ncompliment you, Mr. Baynes, upon your attention to detail in your\r\nexamination of it. A few trifling points might perhaps be added. The\r\noval seal is undoubtedly a plain sleeve-link—what else is of such a\r\nshape? The scissors were bent nail scissors. Short as the two snips\r\nare, you can distinctly see the same slight curve in each.”\r\n\r\nThe country detective chuckled.\r\n\r\n“I thought I had squeezed all the juice out of it, but I see there was\r\na little over,” he said. “I’m bound to say that I make nothing of the\r\nnote except that there was something on hand, and that a woman, as\r\nusual was at the bottom of it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Scott Eccles had fidgeted in his seat during this conversation.\r\n\r\n“I am glad you found the note, since it corroborates my story,” said\r\nhe. “But I beg to point out that I have not yet heard what has happened\r\nto Mr. Garcia, nor what has become of his household.”\r\n\r\n“As to Garcia,” said Gregson, “that is easily answered. He was found\r\ndead this morning upon Oxshott Common, nearly a mile from his home. His\r\nhead had been smashed to pulp by heavy blows of a sandbag or some such\r\ninstrument, which had crushed rather than wounded. It is a lonely\r\ncorner, and there is no house within a quarter of a mile of the spot.\r\nHe had apparently been struck down first from behind, but his assailant\r\nhad gone on beating him long after he was dead. It was a most furious\r\nassault. There are no footsteps nor any clue to the criminals.”\r\n\r\n“Robbed?”\r\n\r\n“No, there was no attempt at robbery.”\r\n\r\n“This is very painful—very painful and terrible,” said Mr. Scott Eccles\r\nin a querulous voice, “but it is really uncommonly hard on me. I had\r\nnothing to do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excursion and\r\nmeeting so sad an end. How do I come to be mixed up with the case?”\r\n\r\n“Very simply, sir,” Inspector Baynes answered. “The only document found\r\nin the pocket of the deceased was a letter from you saying that you\r\nwould be with him on the night of his death. It was the envelope of\r\nthis letter which gave us the dead man’s name and address. It was after\r\nnine this morning when we reached his house and found neither you nor\r\nanyone else inside it. I wired to Mr. Gregson to run you down in London\r\nwhile I examined Wisteria Lodge. Then I came into town, joined Mr.\r\nGregson, and here we are.”\r\n\r\n“I think now,” said Gregson, rising, “we had best put this matter into\r\nan official shape. You will come round with us to the station, Mr.\r\nScott Eccles, and let us have your statement in writing.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, I will come at once. But I retain your services, Mr.\r\nHolmes. I desire you to spare no expense and no pains to get at the\r\ntruth.”\r\n\r\nMy friend turned to the country inspector.\r\n\r\n“I suppose that you have no objection to my collaborating with you, Mr.\r\nBaynes?”\r\n\r\n“Highly honoured, sir, I am sure.”\r\n\r\n“You appear to have been very prompt and businesslike in all that you\r\nhave done. Was there any clue, may I ask, as to the exact hour that the\r\nman met his death?”\r\n\r\n“He had been there since one o’clock. There was rain about that time,\r\nand his death had certainly been before the rain.”\r\n\r\n“But that is perfectly impossible, Mr. Baynes,” cried our client. “His\r\nvoice is unmistakable. I could swear to it that it was he who addressed\r\nme in my bedroom at that very hour.”\r\n\r\n“Remarkable, but by no means impossible,” said Holmes, smiling.\r\n\r\n“You have a clue?” asked Gregson.\r\n\r\n“On the face of it the case is not a very complex one, though it\r\ncertainly presents some novel and interesting features. A further\r\nknowledge of facts is necessary before I would venture to give a final\r\nand definite opinion. By the way, Mr. Baynes, did you find anything\r\nremarkable besides this note in your examination of the house?”\r\n\r\nThe detective looked at my friend in a singular way.\r\n\r\n“There were,” said he, “one or two _very_ remarkable things. Perhaps\r\nwhen I have finished at the police-station you would care to come out\r\nand give me your opinion of them.”\r\n\r\n“I am entirely at your service,” said Sherlock Holmes, ringing the\r\nbell. “You will show these gentlemen out, Mrs. Hudson, and kindly send\r\nthe boy with this telegram. He is to pay a five-shilling reply.”\r\n\r\nWe sat for some time in silence after our visitors had left. Holmes\r\nsmoked hard, with his brows drawn down over his keen eyes, and his head\r\nthrust forward in the eager way characteristic of the man.\r\n\r\n“Well, Watson,” he asked, turning suddenly upon me, “what do you make\r\nof it?”\r\n\r\n“I can make nothing of this mystification of Scott Eccles.”\r\n\r\n“But the crime?”\r\n\r\n“Well, taken with the disappearance of the man’s companions, I should\r\nsay that they were in some way concerned in the murder and had fled\r\nfrom justice.”\r\n\r\n“That is certainly a possible point of view. On the face of it you must\r\nadmit, however, that it is very strange that his two servants should\r\nhave been in a conspiracy against him and should have attacked him on\r\nthe one night when he had a guest. They had him alone at their mercy\r\nevery other night in the week.”\r\n\r\n“Then why did they fly?”\r\n\r\n“Quite so. Why did they fly? There is a big fact. Another big fact is\r\nthe remarkable experience of our client, Scott Eccles. Now, my dear\r\nWatson, is it beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish an\r\nexplanation which would cover both of these big facts? If it were one\r\nwhich would also admit of the mysterious note with its very curious\r\nphraseology, why, then it would be worth accepting as a temporary\r\nhypothesis. If the fresh facts which come to our knowledge all fit\r\nthemselves into the scheme, then our hypothesis may gradually become a\r\nsolution.”\r\n\r\n“But what is our hypothesis?”\r\n\r\nHolmes leaned back in his chair with half-closed eyes.\r\n\r\n“You must admit, my dear Watson, that the idea of a joke is impossible.\r\nThere were grave events afoot, as the sequel showed, and the coaxing of\r\nScott Eccles to Wisteria Lodge had some connection with them.”\r\n\r\n“But what possible connection?”\r\n\r\n“Let us take it link by link. There is, on the face of it, something\r\nunnatural about this strange and sudden friendship between the young\r\nSpaniard and Scott Eccles. It was the former who forced the pace. He\r\ncalled upon Eccles at the other end of London on the very day after he\r\nfirst met him, and he kept in close touch with him until he got him\r\ndown to Esher. Now, what did he want with Eccles? What could Eccles\r\nsupply? I see no charm in the man. He is not particularly\r\nintelligent—not a man likely to be congenial to a quick-witted Latin.\r\nWhy, then, was he picked out from all the other people whom Garcia met\r\nas particularly suited to his purpose? Has he any one outstanding\r\nquality? I say that he has. He is the very type of conventional British\r\nrespectability, and the very man as a witness to impress another\r\nBriton. You saw yourself how neither of the inspectors dreamed of\r\nquestioning his statement, extraordinary as it was.”\r\n\r\n“But what was he to witness?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, as things turned out, but everything had they gone another\r\nway. That is how I read the matter.”\r\n\r\n“I see, he might have proved an alibi.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly, my dear Watson; he might have proved an alibi. We will\r\nsuppose, for argument’s sake, that the household of Wisteria Lodge are\r\nconfederates in some design. The attempt, whatever it may be, is to\r\ncome off, we will say, before one o’clock. By some juggling of the\r\nclocks it is quite possible that they may have got Scott Eccles to bed\r\nearlier than he thought, but in any case it is likely that when Garcia\r\nwent out of his way to tell him that it was one it was really not more\r\nthan twelve. If Garcia could do whatever he had to do and be back by\r\nthe hour mentioned he had evidently a powerful reply to any accusation.\r\nHere was this irreproachable Englishman ready to swear in any court of\r\nlaw that the accused was in the house all the time. It was an insurance\r\nagainst the worst.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I see that. But how about the disappearance of the others?”\r\n\r\n“I have not all my facts yet, but I do not think there are any\r\ninsuperable difficulties. Still, it is an error to argue in front of\r\nyour data. You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your\r\ntheories.”\r\n\r\n“And the message?”\r\n\r\n“How did it run? ‘Our own colours, green and white.’ Sounds like\r\nracing. ‘Green open, white shut.’ That is clearly a signal. ‘Main\r\nstair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize.’ This is an\r\nassignation. We may find a jealous husband at the bottom of it all. It\r\nwas clearly a dangerous quest. She would not have said ‘Godspeed’ had\r\nit not been so. ‘D’—that should be a guide.”\r\n\r\n“The man was a Spaniard. I suggest that ‘D’ stands for Dolores, a\r\ncommon female name in Spain.”\r\n\r\n“Good, Watson, very good—but quite inadmissible. A Spaniard would write\r\nto a Spaniard in Spanish. The writer of this note is certainly English.\r\nWell, we can only possess our soul in patience until this excellent\r\ninspector come back for us. Meanwhile we can thank our lucky fate which\r\nhas rescued us for a few short hours from the insufferable fatigues of\r\nidleness.”\r\n\r\nAn answer had arrived to Holmes’s telegram before our Surrey officer\r\nhad returned. Holmes read it and was about to place it in his notebook\r\nwhen he caught a glimpse of my expectant face. He tossed it across with\r\na laugh.\r\n\r\n“We are moving in exalted circles,” said he.\r\n\r\nThe telegram was a list of names and addresses:\r\n\r\nLord Harringby, The Dingle; Sir George Ffolliott, Oxshott Towers; Mr.\r\nHynes Hynes, J.P., Purdley Place; Mr. James Baker Williams, Forton Old\r\nHall; Mr. Henderson, High Gable; Rev. Joshua Stone, Nether Walsling.\r\n\r\n“This is a very obvious way of limiting our field of operations,” said\r\nHolmes. “No doubt Baynes, with his methodical mind, has already adopted\r\nsome similar plan.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t quite understand.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear fellow, we have already arrived at the conclusion that\r\nthe message received by Garcia at dinner was an appointment or an\r\nassignation. Now, if the obvious reading of it is correct, and in order\r\nto keep the tryst one has to ascend a main stair and seek the seventh\r\ndoor in a corridor, it is perfectly clear that the house is a very\r\nlarge one. It is equally certain that this house cannot be more than a\r\nmile or two from Oxshott, since Garcia was walking in that direction\r\nand hoped, according to my reading of the facts, to be back in Wisteria\r\nLodge in time to avail himself of an alibi, which would only be valid\r\nup to one o’clock. As the number of large houses close to Oxshott must\r\nbe limited, I adopted the obvious method of sending to the agents\r\nmentioned by Scott Eccles and obtaining a list of them. Here they are\r\nin this telegram, and the other end of our tangled skein must lie among\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nIt was nearly six o’clock before we found ourselves in the pretty\r\nSurrey village of Esher, with Inspector Baynes as our companion.\r\n\r\nHolmes and I had taken things for the night, and found comfortable\r\nquarters at the Bull. Finally we set out in the company of the\r\ndetective on our visit to Wisteria Lodge. It was a cold, dark March\r\nevening, with a sharp wind and a fine rain beating upon our faces, a\r\nfit setting for the wild common over which our road passed and the\r\ntragic goal to which it led us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Tiger of San Pedro\r\n\r\n\r\nA cold and melancholy walk of a couple of miles brought us to a high\r\nwooden gate, which opened into a gloomy avenue of chestnuts. The curved\r\nand shadowed drive led us to a low, dark house, pitch-black against a\r\nslate-coloured sky. From the front window upon the left of the door\r\nthere peeped a glimmer of a feeble light.\r\n\r\n“There’s a constable in possession,” said Baynes. “I’ll knock at the\r\nwindow.” He stepped across the grass plot and tapped with his hand on\r\nthe pane. Through the fogged glass I dimly saw a man spring up from a\r\nchair beside the fire, and heard a sharp cry from within the room. An\r\ninstant later a white-faced, hard-breathing policeman had opened the\r\ndoor, the candle wavering in his trembling hand.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, Walters?” asked Baynes sharply.\r\n\r\nThe man mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and gave a long sigh\r\nof relief.\r\n\r\n“I am glad you have come, sir. It has been a long evening, and I don’t\r\nthink my nerve is as good as it was.”\r\n\r\n“Your nerve, Walters? I should not have thought you had a nerve in your\r\nbody.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, it’s this lonely, silent house and the queer thing in the\r\nkitchen. Then when you tapped at the window I thought it had come\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“That what had come again?”\r\n\r\n“The devil, sir, for all I know. It was at the window.”\r\n\r\n“What was at the window, and when?”\r\n\r\n“It was just about two hours ago. The light was just fading. I was\r\nsitting reading in the chair. I don’t know what made me look up, but\r\nthere was a face looking in at me through the lower pane. Lord, sir,\r\nwhat a face it was! I’ll see it in my dreams.”\r\n\r\n“Tut, tut, Walters. This is not talk for a police-constable.”\r\n\r\n“I know, sir, I know; but it shook me, sir, and there’s no use to deny\r\nit. It wasn’t black, sir, nor was it white, nor any colour that I know\r\nbut a kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk in it. Then\r\nthere was the size of it—it was twice yours, sir. And the look of\r\nit—the great staring goggle eyes, and the line of white teeth like a\r\nhungry beast. I tell you, sir, I couldn’t move a finger, nor get my\r\nbreath, till it whisked away and was gone. Out I ran and through the\r\nshrubbery, but thank God there was no one there.”\r\n\r\n“If I didn’t know you were a good man, Walters, I should put a black\r\nmark against you for this. If it were the devil himself a constable on\r\nduty should never thank God that he could not lay his hands upon him. I\r\nsuppose the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of nerves?”\r\n\r\n“That, at least, is very easily settled,” said Holmes, lighting his\r\nlittle pocket lantern. “Yes,” he reported, after a short examination of\r\nthe grass bed, “a number twelve shoe, I should say. If he was all on\r\nthe same scale as his foot he must certainly have been a giant.”\r\n\r\n“What became of him?”\r\n\r\n“He seems to have broken through the shrubbery and made for the road.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the inspector with a grave and thoughtful face, “whoever\r\nhe may have been, and whatever he may have wanted, he’s gone for the\r\npresent, and we have more immediate things to attend to. Now, Mr.\r\nHolmes, with your permission, I will show you round the house.”\r\n\r\nThe various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had yielded nothing to a careful\r\nsearch. Apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing with them,\r\nand all the furniture down to the smallest details had been taken over\r\nwith the house. A good deal of clothing with the stamp of Marx and Co.,\r\nHigh Holborn, had been left behind. Telegraphic inquiries had been\r\nalready made which showed that Marx knew nothing of his customer save\r\nthat he was a good payer. Odds and ends, some pipes, a few novels, two\r\nof them in Spanish, an old-fashioned pinfire revolver, and a guitar\r\nwere among the personal property.\r\n\r\n“Nothing in all this,” said Baynes, stalking, candle in hand, from room\r\nto room. “But now, Mr. Holmes, I invite your attention to the kitchen.”\r\n\r\nIt was a gloomy, high-ceilinged room at the back of the house, with a\r\nstraw litter in one corner, which served apparently as a bed for the\r\ncook. The table was piled with half-eaten dishes and dirty plates, the\r\n_débris_ of last night’s dinner.\r\n\r\n“Look at this,” said Baynes. “What do you make of it?”\r\n\r\nHe held up his candle before an extraordinary object which stood at the\r\nback of the dresser. It was so wrinkled and shrunken and withered that\r\nit was difficult to say what it might have been. One could but say that\r\nit was black and leathery and that it bore some resemblance to a\r\ndwarfish, human figure. At first, as I examined it, I thought that it\r\nwas a mummified negro baby, and then it seemed a very twisted and\r\nancient monkey. Finally I was left in doubt as to whether it was animal\r\nor human. A double band of white shells were strung round the centre of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Very interesting—very interesting, indeed!” said Holmes, peering at\r\nthis sinister relic. “Anything more?”\r\n\r\nIn silence Baynes led the way to the sink and held forward his candle.\r\nThe limbs and body of some large, white bird, torn savagely to pieces\r\nwith the feathers still on, were littered all over it. Holmes pointed\r\nto the wattles on the severed head.\r\n\r\n“A white cock,” said he. “Most interesting! It is really a very curious\r\ncase.”\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Baynes had kept his most sinister exhibit to the last. From\r\nunder the sink he drew a zinc pail which contained a quantity of blood.\r\nThen from the table he took a platter heaped with small pieces of\r\ncharred bone.\r\n\r\n“Something has been killed and something has been burned. We raked all\r\nthese out of the fire. We had a doctor in this morning. He says that\r\nthey are not human.”\r\n\r\nHolmes smiled and rubbed his hands.\r\n\r\n“I must congratulate you, Inspector, on handling so distinctive and\r\ninstructive a case. Your powers, if I may say so without offence, seem\r\nsuperior to your opportunities.”\r\n\r\nInspector Baynes’s small eyes twinkled with pleasure.\r\n\r\n“You’re right, Mr. Holmes. We stagnate in the provinces. A case of this\r\nsort gives a man a chance, and I hope that I shall take it. What do you\r\nmake of these bones?”\r\n\r\n“A lamb, I should say, or a kid.”\r\n\r\n“And the white cock?”\r\n\r\n“Curious, Mr. Baynes, very curious. I should say almost unique.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, there must have been some very strange people with some very\r\nstrange ways in this house. One of them is dead. Did his companions\r\nfollow him and kill him? If they did we should have them, for every\r\nport is watched. But my own views are different. Yes, sir, my own views\r\nare very different.”\r\n\r\n“You have a theory then?”\r\n\r\n“And I’ll work it myself, Mr. Holmes. It’s only due to my own credit to\r\ndo so. Your name is made, but I have still to make mine. I should be\r\nglad to be able to say afterwards that I had solved it without your\r\nhelp.”\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed good-humouredly.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, Inspector,” said he. “Do you follow your path and I will\r\nfollow mine. My results are always very much at your service if you\r\ncare to apply to me for them. I think that I have seen all that I wish\r\nin this house, and that my time may be more profitably employed\r\nelsewhere. _Au revoir_ and good luck!”\r\n\r\nI could tell by numerous subtle signs, which might have been lost upon\r\nanyone but myself, that Holmes was on a hot scent. As impassive as ever\r\nto the casual observer, there were none the less a subdued eagerness\r\nand suggestion of tension in his brightened eyes and brisker manner\r\nwhich assured me that the game was afoot. After his habit he said\r\nnothing, and after mine I asked no questions. Sufficient for me to\r\nshare the sport and lend my humble help to the capture without\r\ndistracting that intent brain with needless interruption. All would\r\ncome round to me in due time.\r\n\r\nI waited, therefore—but to my ever-deepening disappointment I waited in\r\nvain. Day succeeded day, and my friend took no step forward. One\r\nmorning he spent in town, and I learned from a casual reference that he\r\nhad visited the British Museum. Save for this one excursion, he spent\r\nhis days in long and often solitary walks, or in chatting with a number\r\nof village gossips whose acquaintance he had cultivated.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure, Watson, a week in the country will be invaluable to you,” he\r\nremarked. “It is very pleasant to see the first green shoots upon the\r\nhedges and the catkins on the hazels once again. With a spud, a tin\r\nbox, and an elementary book on botany, there are instructive days to be\r\nspent.” He prowled about with this equipment himself, but it was a poor\r\nshow of plants which he would bring back of an evening.\r\n\r\nOccasionally in our rambles we came across Inspector Baynes. His fat,\r\nred face wreathed itself in smiles and his small eyes glittered as he\r\ngreeted my companion. He said little about the case, but from that\r\nlittle we gathered that he also was not dissatisfied at the course of\r\nevents. I must admit, however, that I was somewhat surprised when, some\r\nfive days after the crime, I opened my morning paper to find in large\r\nletters:\r\n\r\n    THE OXSHOTT MYSTERY\r\n    A SOLUTION\r\n    ARREST OF SUPPOSED ASSASSIN\r\n\r\nHolmes sprang in his chair as if he had been stung when I read the\r\nheadlines.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” he cried. “You don’t mean that Baynes has got him?”\r\n\r\n“Apparently,” said I as I read the following report:\r\n\r\n“Great excitement was caused in Esher and the neighbouring district\r\nwhen it was learned late last night that an arrest had been effected in\r\nconnection with the Oxshott murder. It will be remembered that Mr.\r\nGarcia, of Wisteria Lodge, was found dead on Oxshott Common, his body\r\nshowing signs of extreme violence, and that on the same night his\r\nservant and his cook fled, which appeared to show their participation\r\nin the crime. It was suggested, but never proved, that the deceased\r\ngentleman may have had valuables in the house, and that their\r\nabstraction was the motive of the crime. Every effort was made by\r\nInspector Baynes, who has the case in hand, to ascertain the hiding\r\nplace of the fugitives, and he had good reason to believe that they had\r\nnot gone far but were lurking in some retreat which had been already\r\nprepared. It was certain from the first, however, that they would\r\neventually be detected, as the cook, from the evidence of one or two\r\ntradespeople who have caught a glimpse of him through the window, was a\r\nman of most remarkable appearance—being a huge and hideous mulatto,\r\nwith yellowish features of a pronounced negroid type. This man has been\r\nseen since the crime, for he was detected and pursued by Constable\r\nWalters on the same evening, when he had the audacity to revisit\r\nWisteria Lodge. Inspector Baynes, considering that such a visit must\r\nhave some purpose in view and was likely, therefore, to be repeated,\r\nabandoned the house but left an ambuscade in the shrubbery. The man\r\nwalked into the trap and was captured last night after a struggle in\r\nwhich Constable Downing was badly bitten by the savage. We understand\r\nthat when the prisoner is brought before the magistrates a remand will\r\nbe applied for by the police, and that great developments are hoped\r\nfrom his capture.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Really we must see Baynes at once,” cried Holmes, picking up his hat.\r\n“We will just catch him before he starts.” We hurried down the village\r\nstreet and found, as we had expected, that the inspector was just\r\nleaving his lodgings.\r\n\r\n“You’ve seen the paper, Mr. Holmes?” he asked, holding one out to us.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Baynes, I’ve seen it. Pray don’t think it a liberty if I give you\r\na word of friendly warning.”\r\n\r\n“Of warning, Mr. Holmes?”\r\n\r\n“I have looked into this case with some care, and I am not convinced\r\nthat you are on the right lines. I don’t want you to commit yourself\r\ntoo far unless you are sure.”\r\n\r\n“You’re very kind, Mr. Holmes.”\r\n\r\n“I assure you I speak for your good.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that something like a wink quivered for an instant over\r\none of Mr. Baynes’s tiny eyes.\r\n\r\n“We agreed to work on our own lines, Mr. Holmes. That’s what I am\r\ndoing.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, very good,” said Holmes. “Don’t blame me.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; I believe you mean well by me. But we all have our own\r\nsystems, Mr. Holmes. You have yours, and maybe I have mine.”\r\n\r\n“Let us say no more about it.”\r\n\r\n“You’re welcome always to my news. This fellow is a perfect savage, as\r\nstrong as a cart-horse and as fierce as the devil. He chewed Downing’s\r\nthumb nearly off before they could master him. He hardly speaks a word\r\nof English, and we can get nothing out of him but grunts.”\r\n\r\n“And you think you have evidence that he murdered his late master?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say so, Mr. Holmes; I didn’t say so. We all have our little\r\nways. You try yours and I will try mine. That’s the agreement.”\r\n\r\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders as we walked away together. “I can’t make\r\nthe man out. He seems to be riding for a fall. Well, as he says, we\r\nmust each try our own way and see what comes of it. But there’s\r\nsomething in Inspector Baynes which I can’t quite understand.”\r\n\r\n“Just sit down in that chair, Watson,” said Sherlock Holmes when we had\r\nreturned to our apartment at the Bull. “I want to put you in touch with\r\nthe situation, as I may need your help to-night. Let me show you the\r\nevolution of this case so far as I have been able to follow it. Simple\r\nas it has been in its leading features, it has none the less presented\r\nsurprising difficulties in the way of an arrest. There are gaps in that\r\ndirection which we have still to fill.\r\n\r\n“We will go back to the note which was handed in to Garcia upon the\r\nevening of his death. We may put aside this idea of Baynes’s that\r\nGarcia’s servants were concerned in the matter. The proof of this lies\r\nin the fact that it was _he_ who had arranged for the presence of Scott\r\nEccles, which could only have been done for the purpose of an alibi. It\r\nwas Garcia, then, who had an enterprise, and apparently a criminal\r\nenterprise, in hand that night in the course of which he met his death.\r\nI say ‘criminal’ because only a man with a criminal enterprise desires\r\nto establish an alibi. Who, then, is most likely to have taken his\r\nlife? Surely the person against whom the criminal enterprise was\r\ndirected. So far it seems to me that we are on safe ground.\r\n\r\n“We can now see a reason for the disappearance of Garcia’s household.\r\nThey were _all_ confederates in the same unknown crime. If it came off\r\nwhen Garcia returned, any possible suspicion would be warded off by the\r\nEnglishman’s evidence, and all would be well. But the attempt was a\r\ndangerous one, and if Garcia did _not_ return by a certain hour it was\r\nprobable that his own life had been sacrificed. It had been arranged,\r\ntherefore, that in such a case his two subordinates were to make for\r\nsome prearranged spot where they could escape investigation and be in a\r\nposition afterwards to renew their attempt. That would fully explain\r\nthe facts, would it not?”\r\n\r\nThe whole inexplicable tangle seemed to straighten out before me. I\r\nwondered, as I always did, how it had not been obvious to me before.\r\n\r\n“But why should one servant return?”\r\n\r\n“We can imagine that in the confusion of flight something precious,\r\nsomething which he could not bear to part with, had been left behind.\r\nThat would explain his persistence, would it not?”\r\n\r\n“Well, what is the next step?”\r\n\r\n“The next step is the note received by Garcia at the dinner. It\r\nindicates a confederate at the other end. Now, where was the other end?\r\nI have already shown you that it could only lie in some large house,\r\nand that the number of large houses is limited. My first days in this\r\nvillage were devoted to a series of walks in which in the intervals of\r\nmy botanical researches I made a reconnaissance of all the large houses\r\nand an examination of the family history of the occupants. One house,\r\nand only one, riveted my attention. It is the famous old Jacobean\r\ngrange of High Gable, one mile on the farther side of Oxshott, and less\r\nthan half a mile from the scene of the tragedy. The other mansions\r\nbelonged to prosaic and respectable people who live far aloof from\r\nromance. But Mr. Henderson, of High Gable, was by all accounts a\r\ncurious man to whom curious adventures might befall. I concentrated my\r\nattention, therefore, upon him and his household.\r\n\r\n“A singular set of people, Watson—the man himself the most singular of\r\nthem all. I managed to see him on a plausible pretext, but I seemed to\r\nread in his dark, deep-set, brooding eyes that he was perfectly aware\r\nof my true business. He is a man of fifty, strong, active, with\r\niron-grey hair, great bunched black eyebrows, the step of a deer and\r\nthe air of an emperor—a fierce, masterful man, with a red-hot spirit\r\nbehind his parchment face. He is either a foreigner or has lived long\r\nin the tropics, for he is yellow and sapless, but tough as whipcord.\r\nHis friend and secretary, Mr. Lucas, is undoubtedly a foreigner,\r\nchocolate brown, wily, suave, and catlike, with a poisonous gentleness\r\nof speech. You see, Watson, we have come already upon two sets of\r\nforeigners—one at Wisteria Lodge and one at High Gable—so our gaps are\r\nbeginning to close.\r\n\r\n“These two men, close and confidential friends, are the centre of the\r\nhousehold; but there is one other person who for our immediate purpose\r\nmay be even more important. Henderson has two children—girls of eleven\r\nand thirteen. Their governess is a Miss Burnet, an Englishwoman of\r\nforty or thereabouts. There is also one confidential manservant. This\r\nlittle group forms the real family, for they travel about together, and\r\nHenderson is a great traveller, always on the move. It is only within\r\nthe last weeks that he has returned, after a year’s absence, to High\r\nGable. I may add that he is enormously rich, and whatever his whims may\r\nbe he can very easily satisfy them. For the rest, his house is full of\r\nbutlers, footmen, maidservants, and the usual overfed, underworked\r\nstaff of a large English country house.\r\n\r\n“So much I learned partly from village gossip and partly from my own\r\nobservation. There are no better instruments than discharged servants\r\nwith a grievance, and I was lucky enough to find one. I call it luck,\r\nbut it would not have come my way had I not been looking out for it. As\r\nBaynes remarks, we all have our systems. It was my system which enabled\r\nme to find John Warner, late gardener of High Gable, sacked in a moment\r\nof temper by his imperious employer. He in turn had friends among the\r\nindoor servants who unite in their fear and dislike of their master. So\r\nI had my key to the secrets of the establishment.\r\n\r\n“Curious people, Watson! I don’t pretend to understand it all yet, but\r\nvery curious people anyway. It’s a double-winged house, and the\r\nservants live on one side, the family on the other. There’s no link\r\nbetween the two save for Henderson’s own servant, who serves the\r\nfamily’s meals. Everything is carried to a certain door, which forms\r\nthe one connection. Governess and children hardly go out at all, except\r\ninto the garden. Henderson never by any chance walks alone. His dark\r\nsecretary is like his shadow. The gossip among the servants is that\r\ntheir master is terribly afraid of something. ‘Sold his soul to the\r\ndevil in exchange for money,’ says Warner, ‘and expects his creditor to\r\ncome up and claim his own.’ Where they came from, or who they are,\r\nnobody has an idea. They are very violent. Twice Henderson has lashed\r\nat folk with his dog-whip, and only his long purse and heavy\r\ncompensation have kept him out of the courts.\r\n\r\n“Well, now, Watson, let us judge the situation by this new information.\r\nWe may take it that the letter came out of this strange household and\r\nwas an invitation to Garcia to carry out some attempt which had already\r\nbeen planned. Who wrote the note? It was someone within the citadel,\r\nand it was a woman. Who then but Miss Burnet, the governess? All our\r\nreasoning seems to point that way. At any rate, we may take it as a\r\nhypothesis and see what consequences it would entail. I may add that\r\nMiss Burnet’s age and character make it certain that my first idea that\r\nthere might be a love interest in our story is out of the question.\r\n\r\n“If she wrote the note she was presumably the friend and confederate of\r\nGarcia. What, then, might she be expected to do if she heard of his\r\ndeath? If he met it in some nefarious enterprise her lips might be\r\nsealed. Still, in her heart, she must retain bitterness and hatred\r\nagainst those who had killed him and would presumably help so far as\r\nshe could to have revenge upon them. Could we see her, then and try to\r\nuse her? That was my first thought. But now we come to a sinister fact.\r\nMiss Burnet has not been seen by any human eye since the night of the\r\nmurder. From that evening she has utterly vanished. Is she alive? Has\r\nshe perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend whom she had\r\nsummoned? Or is she merely a prisoner? There is the point which we\r\nstill have to decide.\r\n\r\n“You will appreciate the difficulty of the situation, Watson. There is\r\nnothing upon which we can apply for a warrant. Our whole scheme might\r\nseem fantastic if laid before a magistrate. The woman’s disappearance\r\ncounts for nothing, since in that extraordinary household any member of\r\nit might be invisible for a week. And yet she may at the present moment\r\nbe in danger of her life. All I can do is to watch the house and leave\r\nmy agent, Warner, on guard at the gates. We can’t let such a situation\r\ncontinue. If the law can do nothing we must take the risk ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“What do you suggest?”\r\n\r\n“I know which is her room. It is accessible from the top of an\r\nouthouse. My suggestion is that you and I go to-night and see if we can\r\nstrike at the very heart of the mystery.”\r\n\r\nIt was not, I must confess, a very alluring prospect. The old house\r\nwith its atmosphere of murder, the singular and formidable inhabitants,\r\nthe unknown dangers of the approach, and the fact that we were putting\r\nourselves legally in a false position all combined to damp my ardour.\r\nBut there was something in the ice-cold reasoning of Holmes which made\r\nit impossible to shrink from any adventure which he might recommend.\r\nOne knew that thus, and only thus, could a solution be found. I clasped\r\nhis hand in silence, and the die was cast.\r\n\r\nBut it was not destined that our investigation should have so\r\nadventurous an ending. It was about five o’clock, and the shadows of\r\nthe March evening were beginning to fall, when an excited rustic rushed\r\ninto our room.\r\n\r\n“They’ve gone, Mr. Holmes. They went by the last train. The lady broke\r\naway, and I’ve got her in a cab downstairs.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent, Warner!” cried Holmes, springing to his feet. “Watson, the\r\ngaps are closing rapidly.”\r\n\r\nIn the cab was a woman, half-collapsed from nervous exhaustion. She\r\nbore upon her aquiline and emaciated face the traces of some recent\r\ntragedy. Her head hung listlessly upon her breast, but as she raised it\r\nand turned her dull eyes upon us I saw that her pupils were dark dots\r\nin the centre of the broad grey iris. She was drugged with opium.\r\n\r\n“I watched at the gate, same as you advised, Mr. Holmes,” said our\r\nemissary, the discharged gardener. “When the carriage came out I\r\nfollowed it to the station. She was like one walking in her sleep, but\r\nwhen they tried to get her into the train she came to life and\r\nstruggled. They pushed her into the carriage. She fought her way out\r\nagain. I took her part, got her into a cab, and here we are. I shan’t\r\nforget the face at the carriage window as I led her away. I’d have a\r\nshort life if he had his way—the black-eyed, scowling, yellow devil.”\r\n\r\nWe carried her upstairs, laid her on the sofa, and a couple of cups of\r\nthe strongest coffee soon cleared her brain from the mists of the drug.\r\nBaynes had been summoned by Holmes, and the situation rapidly explained\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n“Why, sir, you’ve got me the very evidence I want,” said the inspector\r\nwarmly, shaking my friend by the hand. “I was on the same scent as you\r\nfrom the first.”\r\n\r\n“What! You were after Henderson?”\r\n\r\n“Why, Mr. Holmes, when you were crawling in the shrubbery at High Gable\r\nI was up one of the trees in the plantation and saw you down below. It\r\nwas just who would get his evidence first.”\r\n\r\n“Then why did you arrest the mulatto?”\r\n\r\nBaynes chuckled.\r\n\r\n“I was sure Henderson, as he calls himself, felt that he was suspected,\r\nand that he would lie low and make no move so long as he thought he was\r\nin any danger. I arrested the wrong man to make him believe that our\r\neyes were off him. I knew he would be likely to clear off then and give\r\nus a chance of getting at Miss Burnet.”\r\n\r\nHolmes laid his hand upon the inspector’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“You will rise high in your profession. You have instinct and\r\nintuition,” said he.\r\n\r\nBaynes flushed with pleasure.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had a plain-clothes man waiting at the station all the week.\r\nWherever the High Gable folk go he will keep them in sight. But he must\r\nhave been hard put to it when Miss Burnet broke away. However, your man\r\npicked her up, and it all ends well. We can’t arrest without her\r\nevidence, that is clear, so the sooner we get a statement the better.”\r\n\r\n“Every minute she gets stronger,” said Holmes, glancing at the\r\ngoverness. “But tell me, Baynes, who is this man Henderson?”\r\n\r\n“Henderson,” the inspector answered, “is Don Murillo, once called the\r\nTiger of San Pedro.”\r\n\r\nThe Tiger of San Pedro! The whole history of the man came back to me in\r\na flash. He had made his name as the most lewd and bloodthirsty tyrant\r\nthat had ever governed any country with a pretence to civilization.\r\nStrong, fearless, and energetic, he had sufficient virtue to enable him\r\nto impose his odious vices upon a cowering people for ten or twelve\r\nyears. His name was a terror through all Central America. At the end of\r\nthat time there was a universal rising against him. But he was as\r\ncunning as he was cruel, and at the first whisper of coming trouble he\r\nhad secretly conveyed his treasures aboard a ship which was manned by\r\ndevoted adherents. It was an empty palace which was stormed by the\r\ninsurgents next day. The dictator, his two children, his secretary, and\r\nhis wealth had all escaped them. From that moment he had vanished from\r\nthe world, and his identity had been a frequent subject for comment in\r\nthe European press.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, Don Murillo, the Tiger of San Pedro,” said Baynes. “If you\r\nlook it up you will find that the San Pedro colours are green and\r\nwhite, same as in the note, Mr. Holmes. Henderson he called himself,\r\nbut I traced him back, Paris and Rome and Madrid to Barcelona, where\r\nhis ship came in in ’86. They’ve been looking for him all the time for\r\ntheir revenge, but it is only now that they have begun to find him\r\nout.”\r\n\r\n“They discovered him a year ago,” said Miss Burnet, who had sat up and\r\nwas now intently following the conversation. “Once already his life has\r\nbeen attempted, but some evil spirit shielded him. Now, again, it is\r\nthe noble, chivalrous Garcia who has fallen, while the monster goes\r\nsafe. But another will come, and yet another, until some day justice\r\nwill be done; that is as certain as the rise of to-morrow’s sun.” Her\r\nthin hands clenched, and her worn face blanched with the passion of her\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\n“But how come you into this matter, Miss Burnet?” asked Holmes. “How\r\ncan an English lady join in such a murderous affair?”\r\n\r\n“I join in it because there is no other way in the world by which\r\njustice can be gained. What does the law of England care for the rivers\r\nof blood shed years ago in San Pedro, or for the shipload of treasure\r\nwhich this man has stolen? To you they are like crimes committed in\r\nsome other planet. But _we_ know. We have learned the truth in sorrow\r\nand in suffering. To us there is no fiend in hell like Juan Murillo,\r\nand no peace in life while his victims still cry for vengeance.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” said Holmes, “he was as you say. I have heard that he was\r\natrocious. But how are you affected?”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you it all. This villain’s policy was to murder, on one\r\npretext or another, every man who showed such promise that he might in\r\ntime come to be a dangerous rival. My husband—yes, my real name is\r\nSignora Victor Durando—was the San Pedro minister in London. He met me\r\nand married me there. A nobler man never lived upon earth. Unhappily,\r\nMurillo heard of his excellence, recalled him on some pretext, and had\r\nhim shot. With a premonition of his fate he had refused to take me with\r\nhim. His estates were confiscated, and I was left with a pittance and a\r\nbroken heart.\r\n\r\n“Then came the downfall of the tyrant. He escaped as you have just\r\ndescribed. But the many whose lives he had ruined, whose nearest and\r\ndearest had suffered torture and death at his hands, would not let the\r\nmatter rest. They banded themselves into a society which should never\r\nbe dissolved until the work was done. It was my part after we had\r\ndiscovered in the transformed Henderson the fallen despot, to attach\r\nmyself to his household and keep the others in touch with his\r\nmovements. This I was able to do by securing the position of governess\r\nin his family. He little knew that the woman who faced him at every\r\nmeal was the woman whose husband he had hurried at an hour’s notice\r\ninto eternity. I smiled on him, did my duty to his children, and bided\r\nmy time. An attempt was made in Paris and failed. We zig-zagged swiftly\r\nhere and there over Europe to throw off the pursuers and finally\r\nreturned to this house, which he had taken upon his first arrival in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n“But here also the ministers of justice were waiting. Knowing that he\r\nwould return there, Garcia, who is the son of the former highest\r\ndignitary in San Pedro, was waiting with two trusty companions of\r\nhumble station, all three fired with the same reasons for revenge. He\r\ncould do little during the day, for Murillo took every precaution and\r\nnever went out save with his satellite Lucas, or Lopez as he was known\r\nin the days of his greatness. At night, however, he slept alone, and\r\nthe avenger might find him. On a certain evening, which had been\r\nprearranged, I sent my friend final instructions, for the man was\r\nforever on the alert and continually changed his room. I was to see\r\nthat the doors were open and the signal of a green or white light in a\r\nwindow which faced the drive was to give notice if all was safe or if\r\nthe attempt had better be postponed.\r\n\r\n“But everything went wrong with us. In some way I had excited the\r\nsuspicion of Lopez, the secretary. He crept up behind me and sprang\r\nupon me just as I had finished the note. He and his master dragged me\r\nto my room and held judgment upon me as a convicted traitress. Then and\r\nthere they would have plunged their knives into me could they have seen\r\nhow to escape the consequences of the deed. Finally, after much debate,\r\nthey concluded that my murder was too dangerous. But they determined to\r\nget rid forever of Garcia. They had gagged me, and Murillo twisted my\r\narm round until I gave him the address. I swear that he might have\r\ntwisted it off had I understood what it would mean to Garcia. Lopez\r\naddressed the note which I had written, sealed it with his sleeve-link,\r\nand sent it by the hand of the servant, José. How they murdered him I\r\ndo not know, save that it was Murillo’s hand who struck him down, for\r\nLopez had remained to guard me. I believe he must have waited among the\r\ngorse bushes through which the path winds and struck him down as he\r\npassed. At first they were of a mind to let him enter the house and to\r\nkill him as a detected burglar; but they argued that if they were mixed\r\nup in an inquiry their own identity would at once be publicly disclosed\r\nand they would be open to further attacks. With the death of Garcia,\r\nthe pursuit might cease, since such a death might frighten others from\r\nthe task.\r\n\r\n“All would now have been well for them had it not been for my knowledge\r\nof what they had done. I have no doubt that there were times when my\r\nlife hung in the balance. I was confined to my room, terrorised by the\r\nmost horrible threats, cruelly ill-used to break my spirit—see this\r\nstab on my shoulder and the bruises from end to end of my arms—and a\r\ngag was thrust into my mouth on the one occasion when I tried to call\r\nfrom the window. For five days this cruel imprisonment continued, with\r\nhardly enough food to hold body and soul together. This afternoon a\r\ngood lunch was brought me, but the moment after I took it I knew that I\r\nhad been drugged. In a sort of dream I remember being half-led,\r\nhalf-carried to the carriage; in the same state I was conveyed to the\r\ntrain. Only then, when the wheels were almost moving, did I suddenly\r\nrealise that my liberty lay in my own hands. I sprang out, they tried\r\nto drag me back, and had it not been for the help of this good man, who\r\nled me to the cab, I should never had broken away. Now, thank God, I am\r\nbeyond their power forever.”\r\n\r\nWe had all listened intently to this remarkable statement. It was\r\nHolmes who broke the silence.\r\n\r\n“Our difficulties are not over,” he remarked, shaking his head. “Our\r\npolice work ends, but our legal work begins.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said I. “A plausible lawyer could make it out as an act of\r\nself-defence. There may be a hundred crimes in the background, but it\r\nis only on this one that they can be tried.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said Baynes cheerily, “I think better of the law than\r\nthat. Self-defence is one thing. To entice a man in cold blood with the\r\nobject of murdering him is another, whatever danger you may fear from\r\nhim. No, no, we shall all be justified when we see the tenants of High\r\nGable at the next Guildford Assizes.”\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of history, however, that a little time was still to\r\nelapse before the Tiger of San Pedro should meet with his deserts. Wily\r\nand bold, he and his companion threw their pursuer off their track by\r\nentering a lodging-house in Edmonton Street and leaving by the\r\nback-gate into Curzon Square. From that day they were seen no more in\r\nEngland. Some six months afterwards the Marquess of Montalva and Signor\r\nRulli, his secretary, were both murdered in their rooms at the Hotel\r\nEscurial at Madrid. The crime was ascribed to Nihilism, and the\r\nmurderers were never arrested. Inspector Baynes visited us at Baker\r\nStreet with a printed description of the dark face of the secretary,\r\nand of the masterful features, the magnetic black eyes, and the tufted\r\nbrows of his master. We could not doubt that justice, if belated, had\r\ncome at last.\r\n\r\n“A chaotic case, my dear Watson,” said Holmes over an evening pipe. “It\r\nwill not be possible for you to present in that compact form which is\r\ndear to your heart. It covers two continents, concerns two groups of\r\nmysterious persons, and is further complicated by the highly\r\nrespectable presence of our friend, Scott Eccles, whose inclusion shows\r\nme that the deceased Garcia had a scheming mind and a well-developed\r\ninstinct of self-preservation. It is remarkable only for the fact that\r\namid a perfect jungle of possibilities we, with our worthy\r\ncollaborator, the inspector, have kept our close hold on the essentials\r\nand so been guided along the crooked and winding path. Is there any\r\npoint which is not quite clear to you?”\r\n\r\n“The object of the mulatto cook’s return?”\r\n\r\n“I think that the strange creature in the kitchen may account for it.\r\nThe man was a primitive savage from the backwoods of San Pedro, and\r\nthis was his fetish. When his companion and he had fled to some\r\nprearranged retreat—already occupied, no doubt by a confederate—the\r\ncompanion had persuaded him to leave so compromising an article of\r\nfurniture. But the mulatto’s heart was with it, and he was driven back\r\nto it next day, when, on reconnoitering through the window, he found\r\npoliceman Walters in possession. He waited three days longer, and then\r\nhis piety or his superstition drove him to try once more. Inspector\r\nBaynes, who, with his usual astuteness, had minimised the incident\r\nbefore me, had really recognised its importance and had left a trap\r\ninto which the creature walked. Any other point, Watson?”\r\n\r\n“The torn bird, the pail of blood, the charred bones, all the mystery\r\nof that weird kitchen?”\r\n\r\nHolmes smiled as he turned up an entry in his note-book.\r\n\r\n“I spent a morning in the British Museum reading up on that and other\r\npoints. Here is a quotation from Eckermann’s _Voodooism and the Negroid\r\nReligions:_\r\n\r\n“‘The true voodoo-worshipper attempts nothing of importance without\r\ncertain sacrifices which are intended to propitiate his unclean gods.\r\nIn extreme cases these rites take the form of human sacrifices followed\r\nby cannibalism. The more usual victims are a white cock, which is\r\nplucked in pieces alive, or a black goat, whose throat is cut and body\r\nburned.’\r\n\r\n\r\n“So you see our savage friend was very orthodox in his ritual. It is\r\ngrotesque, Watson,” Holmes added, as he slowly fastened his notebook,\r\n“but, as I have had occasion to remark, there is but one step from the\r\ngrotesque to the horrible.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the third week of November, in the year 1895, a dense yellow fog\r\nsettled down upon London. From the Monday to the Thursday I doubt\r\nwhether it was ever possible from our windows in Baker Street to see\r\nthe loom of the opposite houses. The first day Holmes had spent in\r\ncross-indexing his huge book of references. The second and third had\r\nbeen patiently occupied upon a subject which he had recently made his\r\nhobby—the music of the Middle Ages. But when, for the fourth time,\r\nafter pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw the greasy, heavy\r\nbrown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops upon\r\nthe window-panes, my comrade’s impatient and active nature could endure\r\nthis drab existence no longer. He paced restlessly about our\r\nsitting-room in a fever of suppressed energy, biting his nails, tapping\r\nthe furniture, and chafing against inaction.\r\n\r\n“Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?” he said.\r\n\r\nI was aware that by anything of interest, Holmes meant anything of\r\ncriminal interest. There was the news of a revolution, of a possible\r\nwar, and of an impending change of government; but these did not come\r\nwithin the horizon of my companion. I could see nothing recorded in the\r\nshape of crime which was not commonplace and futile. Holmes groaned and\r\nresumed his restless meanderings.\r\n\r\n“The London criminal is certainly a dull fellow,” said he in the\r\nquerulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him. “Look out\r\nthis window, Watson. See how the figures loom up, are dimly seen, and\r\nthen blend once more into the cloud-bank. The thief or the murderer\r\ncould roam London on such a day as the tiger does the jungle, unseen\r\nuntil he pounces, and then evident only to his victim.”\r\n\r\n“There have,” said I, “been numerous petty thefts.”\r\n\r\nHolmes snorted his contempt.\r\n\r\n“This great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than\r\nthat,” said he. “It is fortunate for this community that I am not a\r\ncriminal.”\r\n\r\n“It is, indeed!” said I heartily.\r\n\r\n“Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, or any of the fifty men who\r\nhave good reason for taking my life, how long could I survive against\r\nmy own pursuit? A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be over.\r\nIt is well they don’t have days of fog in the Latin countries—the\r\ncountries of assassination. By Jove! here comes something at last to\r\nbreak our dead monotony.”\r\n\r\nIt was the maid with a telegram. Holmes tore it open and burst out\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n“Well, well! What next?” said he. “Brother Mycroft is coming round.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Why not? It is as if you met a tram-car coming down a country lane.\r\nMycroft has his rails and he runs on them. His Pall Mall lodgings, the\r\nDiogenes Club, Whitehall—that is his cycle. Once, and only once, he has\r\nbeen here. What upheaval can possibly have derailed him?”\r\n\r\n“Does he not explain?”\r\n\r\nHolmes handed me his brother’s telegram.\r\n\r\n\r\n “Must see you over Cadogan West. Coming at once.” MYCROFT.\r\n\r\n“Cadogan West? I have heard the name.”\r\n\r\n“It recalls nothing to my mind. But that Mycroft should break out in\r\nthis erratic fashion! A planet might as well leave its orbit. By the\r\nway, do you know what Mycroft is?”\r\n\r\nI had some vague recollection of an explanation at the time of the\r\nAdventure of the Greek Interpreter.\r\n\r\n“You told me that he had some small office under the British\r\ngovernment.”\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled.\r\n\r\n“I did not know you quite so well in those days. One has to be discreet\r\nwhen one talks of high matters of state. You are right in thinking that\r\nhe is under the British government. You would also be right in a sense\r\nif you said that occasionally he _is_ the British government.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Holmes!”\r\n\r\n“I thought I might surprise you. Mycroft draws four hundred and fifty\r\npounds a year, remains a subordinate, has no ambitions of any kind,\r\nwill receive neither honour nor title, but remains the most\r\nindispensable man in the country.”\r\n\r\n“But how?”\r\n\r\n“Well, his position is unique. He has made it for himself. There has\r\nnever been anything like it before, nor will be again. He has the\r\ntidiest and most orderly brain, with the greatest capacity for storing\r\nfacts, of any man living. The same great powers which I have turned to\r\nthe detection of crime he has used for this particular business. The\r\nconclusions of every department are passed to him, and he is the\r\ncentral exchange, the clearinghouse, which makes out the balance. All\r\nother men are specialists, but his specialism is omniscience. We will\r\nsuppose that a minister needs information as to a point which involves\r\nthe Navy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question; he could get his\r\nseparate advices from various departments upon each, but only Mycroft\r\ncan focus them all, and say offhand how each factor would affect the\r\nother. They began by using him as a short-cut, a convenience; now he\r\nhas made himself an essential. In that great brain of his everything is\r\npigeon-holed and can be handed out in an instant. Again and again his\r\nword has decided the national policy. He lives in it. He thinks of\r\nnothing else save when, as an intellectual exercise, he unbends if I\r\ncall upon him and ask him to advise me on one of my little problems.\r\nBut Jupiter is descending to-day. What on earth can it mean? Who is\r\nCadogan West, and what is he to Mycroft?”\r\n\r\n“I have it,” I cried, and plunged among the litter of papers upon the\r\nsofa. “Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough! Cadogan West was the young\r\nman who was found dead on the Underground on Tuesday morning.”\r\n\r\nHolmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to his lips.\r\n\r\n“This must be serious, Watson. A death which has caused my brother to\r\nalter his habits can be no ordinary one. What in the world can he have\r\nto do with it? The case was featureless as I remember it. The young man\r\nhad apparently fallen out of the train and killed himself. He had not\r\nbeen robbed, and there was no particular reason to suspect violence. Is\r\nthat not so?”\r\n\r\n“There has been an inquest,” said I, “and a good many fresh facts have\r\ncome out. Looked at more closely, I should certainly say that it was a\r\ncurious case.”\r\n\r\n“Judging by its effect upon my brother, I should think it must be a\r\nmost extraordinary one.” He snuggled down in his armchair. “Now,\r\nWatson, let us have the facts.”\r\n\r\n“The man’s name was Arthur Cadogan West. He was twenty-seven years of\r\nage, unmarried, and a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal.”\r\n\r\n“Government employ. Behold the link with Brother Mycroft!”\r\n\r\n“He left Woolwich suddenly on Monday night. Was last seen by his\r\nfiancée, Miss Violet Westbury, whom he left abruptly in the fog about\r\n7:30 that evening. There was no quarrel between them and she can give\r\nno motive for his action. The next thing heard of him was when his dead\r\nbody was discovered by a plate-layer named Mason, just outside Aldgate\r\nStation on the Underground system in London.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“The body was found at six on Tuesday morning. It was lying wide of the\r\nmetals upon the left hand of the track as one goes eastward, at a point\r\nclose to the station, where the line emerges from the tunnel in which\r\nit runs. The head was badly crushed—an injury which might well have\r\nbeen caused by a fall from the train. The body could only have come on\r\nthe line in that way. Had it been carried down from any neighbouring\r\nstreet, it must have passed the station barriers, where a collector is\r\nalways standing. This point seems absolutely certain.”\r\n\r\n“Very good. The case is definite enough. The man, dead or alive, either\r\nfell or was precipitated from a train. So much is clear to me.\r\nContinue.”\r\n\r\n“The trains which traverse the lines of rail beside which the body was\r\nfound are those which run from west to east, some being purely\r\nMetropolitan, and some from Willesden and outlying junctions. It can be\r\nstated for certain that this young man, when he met his death, was\r\ntravelling in this direction at some late hour of the night, but at\r\nwhat point he entered the train it is impossible to state.”\r\n\r\n“His ticket, of course, would show that.”\r\n\r\n“There was no ticket in his pockets.”\r\n\r\n“No ticket! Dear me, Watson, this is really very singular. According to\r\nmy experience it is not possible to reach the platform of a\r\nMetropolitan train without exhibiting one’s ticket. Presumably, then,\r\nthe young man had one. Was it taken from him in order to conceal the\r\nstation from which he came? It is possible. Or did he drop it in the\r\ncarriage? That is also possible. But the point is of curious interest.\r\nI understand that there was no sign of robbery?”\r\n\r\n“Apparently not. There is a list here of his possessions. His purse\r\ncontained two pounds fifteen. He had also a check-book on the Woolwich\r\nbranch of the Capital and Counties Bank. Through this his identity was\r\nestablished. There were also two dress-circle tickets for the Woolwich\r\nTheatre, dated for that very evening. Also a small packet of technical\r\npapers.”\r\n\r\nHolmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“There we have it at last, Watson! British government—Woolwich.\r\nArsenal—technical papers—Brother Mycroft, the chain is complete. But\r\nhere he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for himself.”\r\n\r\nA moment later the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes was ushered\r\ninto the room. Heavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of\r\nuncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame\r\nthere was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its\r\nsteel-grey, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its\r\nplay of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross\r\nbody and remembered only the dominant mind.\r\n\r\nAt his heels came our old friend Lestrade, of Scotland Yard—thin and\r\naustere. The gravity of both their faces foretold some weighty quest.\r\nThe detective shook hands without a word. Mycroft Holmes struggled out\r\nof his overcoat and subsided into an armchair.\r\n\r\n“A most annoying business, Sherlock,” said he. “I extremely dislike\r\naltering my habits, but the powers that be would take no denial. In the\r\npresent state of Siam it is most awkward that I should be away from the\r\noffice. But it is a real crisis. I have never seen the Prime Minister\r\nso upset. As to the Admiralty—it is buzzing like an overturned\r\nbee-hive. Have you read up the case?”\r\n\r\n“We have just done so. What were the technical papers?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, there’s the point! Fortunately, it has not come out. The press\r\nwould be furious if it did. The papers which this wretched youth had in\r\nhis pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine.”\r\n\r\nMycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which showed his sense of the\r\nimportance of the subject. His brother and I sat expectant.\r\n\r\n“Surely you have heard of it? I thought everyone had heard of it.”\r\n\r\n“Only as a name.”\r\n\r\n“Its importance can hardly be exaggerated. It has been the most\r\njealously guarded of all government secrets. You may take it from me\r\nthat naval warfare becomes impossible within the radius of a\r\nBruce-Partington’s operation. Two years ago a very large sum was\r\nsmuggled through the Estimates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly\r\nof the invention. Every effort has been made to keep the secret. The\r\nplans, which are exceedingly intricate, comprising some thirty separate\r\npatents, each essential to the working of the whole, are kept in an\r\nelaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal, with\r\nburglar-proof doors and windows. Under no conceivable circumstances\r\nwere the plans to be taken from the office. If the chief constructor of\r\nthe Navy desired to consult them, even he was forced to go to the\r\nWoolwich office for the purpose. And yet here we find them in the\r\npocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of London. From an official\r\npoint of view it’s simply awful.”\r\n\r\n“But you have recovered them?”\r\n\r\n“No, Sherlock, no! That’s the pinch. We have not. Ten papers were taken\r\nfrom Woolwich. There were seven in the pocket of Cadogan West. The\r\nthree most essential are gone—stolen, vanished. You must drop\r\neverything, Sherlock. Never mind your usual petty puzzles of the\r\npolice-court. It’s a vital international problem that you have to\r\nsolve. Why did Cadogan West take the papers, where are the missing\r\nones, how did he die, how came his body where it was found, how can the\r\nevil be set right? Find an answer to all these questions, and you will\r\nhave done good service for your country.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you not solve it yourself, Mycroft? You can see as far as I.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly, Sherlock. But it is a question of getting details. Give me\r\nyour details, and from an armchair I will return you an excellent\r\nexpert opinion. But to run here and run there, to cross-question\r\nrailway guards, and lie on my face with a lens to my eye—it is not my\r\nmétier. No, you are the one man who can clear the matter up. If you\r\nhave a fancy to see your name in the next honours list—”\r\n\r\nMy friend smiled and shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I play the game for the game’s own sake,” said he. “But the problem\r\ncertainly presents some points of interest, and I shall be very pleased\r\nto look into it. Some more facts, please.”\r\n\r\n“I have jotted down the more essential ones upon this sheet of paper,\r\ntogether with a few addresses which you will find of service. The\r\nactual official guardian of the papers is the famous government expert,\r\nSir James Walter, whose decorations and sub-titles fill two lines of a\r\nbook of reference. He has grown grey in the service, is a gentleman, a\r\nfavoured guest in the most exalted houses, and, above all, a man whose\r\npatriotism is beyond suspicion. He is one of two who have a key of the\r\nsafe. I may add that the papers were undoubtedly in the office during\r\nworking hours on Monday, and that Sir James left for London about three\r\no’clock taking his key with him. He was at the house of Admiral\r\nSinclair at Barclay Square during the whole of the evening when this\r\nincident occurred.”\r\n\r\n“Has the fact been verified?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; his brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, has testified to his\r\ndeparture from Woolwich, and Admiral Sinclair to his arrival in London;\r\nso Sir James is no longer a direct factor in the problem.”\r\n\r\n“Who was the other man with a key?”\r\n\r\n“The senior clerk and draughtsman, Mr. Sidney Johnson. He is a man of\r\nforty, married, with five children. He is a silent, morose man, but he\r\nhas, on the whole, an excellent record in the public service. He is\r\nunpopular with his colleagues, but a hard worker. According to his own\r\naccount, corroborated only by the word of his wife, he was at home the\r\nwhole of Monday evening after office hours, and his key has never left\r\nthe watch-chain upon which it hangs.”\r\n\r\n“Tell us about Cadogan West.”\r\n\r\n“He has been ten years in the service and has done good work. He has\r\nthe reputation of being hot-headed and imperious, but a straight,\r\nhonest man. We have nothing against him. He was next Sidney Johnson in\r\nthe office. His duties brought him into daily, personal contact with\r\nthe plans. No one else had the handling of them.”\r\n\r\n“Who locked up the plans that night?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it is surely perfectly clear who took them away. They are\r\nactually found upon the person of this junior clerk, Cadogan West. That\r\nseems final, does it not?”\r\n\r\n“It does, Sherlock, and yet it leaves so much unexplained. In the first\r\nplace, why did he take them?”\r\n\r\n“I presume they were of value?”\r\n\r\n“He could have got several thousands for them very easily.”\r\n\r\n“Can you suggest any possible motive for taking the papers to London\r\nexcept to sell them?”\r\n\r\n“No, I cannot.”\r\n\r\n“Then we must take that as our working hypothesis. Young West took the\r\npapers. Now this could only be done by having a false key—”\r\n\r\n“Several false keys. He had to open the building and the room.”\r\n\r\n“He had, then, several false keys. He took the papers to London to sell\r\nthe secret, intending, no doubt, to have the plans themselves back in\r\nthe safe next morning before they were missed. While in London on this\r\ntreasonable mission he met his end.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“We will suppose that he was travelling back to Woolwich when he was\r\nkilled and thrown out of the compartment.”\r\n\r\n“Aldgate, where the body was found, is considerably past the station\r\nLondon Bridge, which would be his route to Woolwich.”\r\n\r\n“Many circumstances could be imagined under which he would pass London\r\nBridge. There was someone in the carriage, for example, with whom he\r\nwas having an absorbing interview. This interview led to a violent\r\nscene in which he lost his life. Possibly he tried to leave the\r\ncarriage, fell out on the line, and so met his end. The other closed\r\nthe door. There was a thick fog, and nothing could be seen.”\r\n\r\n“No better explanation can be given with our present knowledge; and yet\r\nconsider, Sherlock, how much you leave untouched. We will suppose, for\r\nargument’s sake, that young Cadogan West _had_ determined to convey\r\nthese papers to London. He would naturally have made an appointment\r\nwith the foreign agent and kept his evening clear. Instead of that he\r\ntook two tickets for the theatre, escorted his fiancée halfway there,\r\nand then suddenly disappeared.”\r\n\r\n“A blind,” said Lestrade, who had sat listening with some impatience to\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\n“A very singular one. That is objection No. 1. Objection No. 2: We will\r\nsuppose that he reaches London and sees the foreign agent. He must\r\nbring back the papers before morning or the loss will be discovered. He\r\ntook away ten. Only seven were in his pocket. What had become of the\r\nother three? He certainly would not leave them of his own free will.\r\nThen, again, where is the price of his treason? One would have expected\r\nto find a large sum of money in his pocket.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me perfectly clear,” said Lestrade. “I have no doubt at\r\nall as to what occurred. He took the papers to sell them. He saw the\r\nagent. They could not agree as to price. He started home again, but the\r\nagent went with him. In the train the agent murdered him, took the more\r\nessential papers, and threw his body from the carriage. That would\r\naccount for everything, would it not?”\r\n\r\n“Why had he no ticket?”\r\n\r\n“The ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agent’s\r\nhouse. Therefore he took it from the murdered man’s pocket.”\r\n\r\n“Good, Lestrade, very good,” said Holmes. “Your theory holds together.\r\nBut if this is true, then the case is at an end. On the one hand, the\r\ntraitor is dead. On the other, the plans of the Bruce-Partington\r\nsubmarine are presumably already on the Continent. What is there for us\r\nto do?”\r\n\r\n“To act, Sherlock—to act!” cried Mycroft, springing to his feet. “All\r\nmy instincts are against this explanation. Use your powers! Go to the\r\nscene of the crime! See the people concerned! Leave no stone unturned!\r\nIn all your career you have never had so great a chance of serving your\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well!” said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. “Come, Watson! And\r\nyou, Lestrade, could you favour us with your company for an hour or\r\ntwo? We will begin our investigation by a visit to Aldgate Station.\r\nGood-bye, Mycroft. I shall let you have a report before evening, but I\r\nwarn you in advance that you have little to expect.”\r\n\r\nAn hour later Holmes, Lestrade and I stood upon the Underground\r\nrailroad at the point where it emerges from the tunnel immediately\r\nbefore Aldgate Station. A courteous red-faced old gentleman represented\r\nthe railway company.\r\n\r\n“This is where the young man’s body lay,” said he, indicating a spot\r\nabout three feet from the metals. “It could not have fallen from above,\r\nfor these, as you see, are all blank walls. Therefore, it could only\r\nhave come from a train, and that train, so far as we can trace it, must\r\nhave passed about midnight on Monday.”\r\n\r\n“Have the carriages been examined for any sign of violence?”\r\n\r\n“There are no such signs, and no ticket has been found.”\r\n\r\n“No record of a door being found open?”\r\n\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\n“We have had some fresh evidence this morning,” said Lestrade. “A\r\npassenger who passed Aldgate in an ordinary Metropolitan train about\r\n11:40 on Monday night declares that he heard a heavy thud, as of a body\r\nstriking the line, just before the train reached the station. There was\r\ndense fog, however, and nothing could be seen. He made no report of it\r\nat the time. Why, whatever is the matter with Mr. Holmes?”\r\n\r\nMy friend was standing with an expression of strained intensity upon\r\nhis face, staring at the railway metals where they curved out of the\r\ntunnel. Aldgate is a junction, and there was a network of points. On\r\nthese his eager, questioning eyes were fixed, and I saw on his keen,\r\nalert face that tightening of the lips, that quiver of the nostrils,\r\nand concentration of the heavy, tufted brows which I knew so well.\r\n\r\n“Points,” he muttered; “the points.”\r\n\r\n“What of it? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose there are no great number of points on a system such as\r\nthis?”\r\n\r\n“No; they are very few.”\r\n\r\n“And a curve, too. Points, and a curve. By Jove! if it were only so.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, Mr. Holmes? Have you a clue?”\r\n\r\n“An idea—an indication, no more. But the case certainly grows in\r\ninterest. Unique, perfectly unique, and yet why not? I do not see any\r\nindications of bleeding on the line.”\r\n\r\n“There were hardly any.”\r\n\r\n“But I understand that there was a considerable wound.”\r\n\r\n“The bone was crushed, but there was no great external injury.”\r\n\r\n“And yet one would have expected some bleeding. Would it be possible\r\nfor me to inspect the train which contained the passenger who heard the\r\nthud of a fall in the fog?”\r\n\r\n“I fear not, Mr. Holmes. The train has been broken up before now, and\r\nthe carriages redistributed.”\r\n\r\n“I can assure you, Mr. Holmes,” said Lestrade, “that every carriage has\r\nbeen carefully examined. I saw to it myself.”\r\n\r\nIt was one of my friend’s most obvious weaknesses that he was impatient\r\nwith less alert intelligences than his own.\r\n\r\n“Very likely,” said he, turning away. “As it happens, it was not the\r\ncarriages which I desired to examine. Watson, we have done all we can\r\nhere. We need not trouble you any further, Mr. Lestrade. I think our\r\ninvestigations must now carry us to Woolwich.”\r\n\r\nAt London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother, which he\r\nhanded to me before dispatching it. It ran thus:\r\n\r\nSee some light in the darkness, but it may possibly flicker out.\r\nMeanwhile, please send by messenger, to await return at Baker Street, a\r\ncomplete list of all foreign spies or international agents known to be\r\nin England, with full address.—Sherlock.\r\n\r\n\r\n“That should be helpful, Watson,” he remarked as we took our seats in\r\nthe Woolwich train. “We certainly owe Brother Mycroft a debt for having\r\nintroduced us to what promises to be a really very remarkable case.”\r\n\r\nHis eager face still wore that expression of intense and high-strung\r\nenergy, which showed me that some novel and suggestive circumstance had\r\nopened up a stimulating line of thought. See the foxhound with hanging\r\nears and drooping tail as it lolls about the kennels, and compare it\r\nwith the same hound as, with gleaming eyes and straining muscles, it\r\nruns upon a breast-high scent—such was the change in Holmes since the\r\nmorning. He was a different man from the limp and lounging figure in\r\nthe mouse-coloured dressing-gown who had prowled so restlessly only a\r\nfew hours before round the fog-girt room.\r\n\r\n“There is material here. There is scope,” said he. “I am dull indeed\r\nnot to have understood its possibilities.”\r\n\r\n“Even now they are dark to me.”\r\n\r\n“The end is dark to me also, but I have hold of one idea which may lead\r\nus far. The man met his death elsewhere, and his body was on the _roof_\r\nof a carriage.”\r\n\r\n“On the roof!”\r\n\r\n“Remarkable, is it not? But consider the facts. Is it a coincidence\r\nthat it is found at the very point where the train pitches and sways as\r\nit comes round on the points? Is not that the place where an object\r\nupon the roof might be expected to fall off? The points would affect no\r\nobject inside the train. Either the body fell from the roof, or a very\r\ncurious coincidence has occurred. But now consider the question of the\r\nblood. Of course, there was no bleeding on the line if the body had\r\nbled elsewhere. Each fact is suggestive in itself. Together they have a\r\ncumulative force.”\r\n\r\n“And the ticket, too!” I cried.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. We could not explain the absence of a ticket. This would\r\nexplain it. Everything fits together.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose it were so, we are still as far as ever from unravelling\r\nthe mystery of his death. Indeed, it becomes not simpler but stranger.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said Holmes, thoughtfully, “perhaps.” He relapsed into a\r\nsilent reverie, which lasted until the slow train drew up at last in\r\nWoolwich Station. There he called a cab and drew Mycroft’s paper from\r\nhis pocket.\r\n\r\n“We have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make,” said he. “I\r\nthink that Sir James Walter claims our first attention.”\r\n\r\nThe house of the famous official was a fine villa with green lawns\r\nstretching down to the Thames. As we reached it the fog was lifting,\r\nand a thin, watery sunshine was breaking through. A butler answered our\r\nring.\r\n\r\n“Sir James, sir!” said he with solemn face. “Sir James died this\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!” cried Holmes in amazement. “How did he die?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you would care to step in, sir, and see his brother, Colonel\r\nValentine?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we had best do so.”\r\n\r\nWe were ushered into a dim-lit drawing-room, where an instant later we\r\nwere joined by a very tall, handsome, light-bearded man of fifty, the\r\nyounger brother of the dead scientist. His wild eyes, stained cheeks,\r\nand unkempt hair all spoke of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the\r\nhousehold. He was hardly articulate as he spoke of it.\r\n\r\n“It was this horrible scandal,” said he. “My brother, Sir James, was a\r\nman of very sensitive honour, and he could not survive such an affair.\r\nIt broke his heart. He was always so proud of the efficiency of his\r\ndepartment, and this was a crushing blow.”\r\n\r\n“We had hoped that he might have given us some indications which would\r\nhave helped us to clear the matter up.”\r\n\r\n“I assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you and to\r\nall of us. He had already put all his knowledge at the disposal of the\r\npolice. Naturally he had no doubt that Cadogan West was guilty. But all\r\nthe rest was inconceivable.”\r\n\r\n“You cannot throw any new light upon the affair?”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing myself save what I have read or heard. I have no desire\r\nto be discourteous, but you can understand, Mr. Holmes, that we are\r\nmuch disturbed at present, and I must ask you to hasten this interview\r\nto an end.”\r\n\r\n“This is indeed an unexpected development,” said my friend when we had\r\nregained the cab. “I wonder if the death was natural, or whether the\r\npoor old fellow killed himself! If the latter, may it be taken as some\r\nsign of self-reproach for duty neglected? We must leave that question\r\nto the future. Now we shall turn to the Cadogan Wests.”\r\n\r\nA small but well-kept house in the outskirts of the town sheltered the\r\nbereaved mother. The old lady was too dazed with grief to be of any use\r\nto us, but at her side was a white-faced young lady, who introduced\r\nherself as Miss Violet Westbury, the fiancée of the dead man, and the\r\nlast to see him upon that fatal night.\r\n\r\n“I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes,” she said. “I have not shut an eye\r\nsince the tragedy, thinking, thinking, thinking, night and day, what\r\nthe true meaning of it can be. Arthur was the most single-minded,\r\nchivalrous, patriotic man upon earth. He would have cut his right hand\r\noff before he would sell a State secret confided to his keeping. It is\r\nabsurd, impossible, preposterous to anyone who knew him.”\r\n\r\n“But the facts, Miss Westbury?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; I admit I cannot explain them.”\r\n\r\n“Was he in any want of money?”\r\n\r\n“No; his needs were very simple and his salary ample. He had saved a\r\nfew hundreds, and we were to marry at the New Year.”\r\n\r\n“No signs of any mental excitement? Come, Miss Westbury, be absolutely\r\nfrank with us.”\r\n\r\nThe quick eye of my companion had noted some change in her manner. She\r\ncoloured and hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said at last, “I had a feeling that there was something on\r\nhis mind.”\r\n\r\n“For long?”\r\n\r\n“Only for the last week or so. He was thoughtful and worried. Once I\r\npressed him about it. He admitted that there was something, and that it\r\nwas concerned with his official life. ‘It is too serious for me to\r\nspeak about, even to you,’ said he. I could get nothing more.”\r\n\r\nHolmes looked grave.\r\n\r\n“Go on, Miss Westbury. Even if it seems to tell against him, go on. We\r\ncannot say what it may lead to.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I have nothing more to tell. Once or twice it seemed to me\r\nthat he was on the point of telling me something. He spoke one evening\r\nof the importance of the secret, and I have some recollection that he\r\nsaid that no doubt foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it.”\r\n\r\nMy friend’s face grew graver still.\r\n\r\n“Anything else?”\r\n\r\n“He said that we were slack about such matters—that it would be easy\r\nfor a traitor to get the plans.”\r\n\r\n“Was it only recently that he made such remarks?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, quite recently.”\r\n\r\n“Now tell us of that last evening.”\r\n\r\n“We were to go to the theatre. The fog was so thick that a cab was\r\nuseless. We walked, and our way took us close to the office. Suddenly\r\nhe darted away into the fog.”\r\n\r\n“Without a word?”\r\n\r\n“He gave an exclamation; that was all. I waited but he never returned.\r\nThen I walked home. Next morning, after the office opened, they came to\r\ninquire. About twelve o’clock we heard the terrible news. Oh, Mr.\r\nHolmes, if you could only, only save his honour! It was so much to\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n“Come, Watson,” said he, “our ways lie elsewhere. Our next station must\r\nbe the office from which the papers were taken.\r\n\r\n“It was black enough before against this young man, but our inquiries\r\nmake it blacker,” he remarked as the cab lumbered off. “His coming\r\nmarriage gives a motive for the crime. He naturally wanted money. The\r\nidea was in his head, since he spoke about it. He nearly made the girl\r\nan accomplice in the treason by telling her his plans. It is all very\r\nbad.”\r\n\r\n“But surely, Holmes, character goes for something? Then, again, why\r\nshould he leave the girl in the street and dart away to commit a\r\nfelony?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly! There are certainly objections. But it is a formidable case\r\nwhich they have to meet.”\r\n\r\nMr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, met us at the office and received\r\nus with that respect which my companion’s card always commanded. He was\r\na thin, gruff, bespectacled man of middle age, his cheeks haggard, and\r\nhis hands twitching from the nervous strain to which he had been\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\n“It is bad, Mr. Holmes, very bad! Have you heard of the death of the\r\nchief?”\r\n\r\n“We have just come from his house.”\r\n\r\n“The place is disorganised. The chief dead, Cadogan West dead, our\r\npapers stolen. And yet, when we closed our door on Monday evening, we\r\nwere as efficient an office as any in the government service. Good God,\r\nit’s dreadful to think of! That West, of all men, should have done such\r\na thing!”\r\n\r\n“You are sure of his guilt, then?”\r\n\r\n“I can see no other way out of it. And yet I would have trusted him as\r\nI trust myself.”\r\n\r\n“At what hour was the office closed on Monday?”\r\n\r\n“At five.”\r\n\r\n“Did you close it?”\r\n\r\n“I am always the last man out.”\r\n\r\n“Where were the plans?”\r\n\r\n“In that safe. I put them there myself.”\r\n\r\n“Is there no watchman to the building?”\r\n\r\n“There is, but he has other departments to look after as well. He is an\r\nold soldier and a most trustworthy man. He saw nothing that evening. Of\r\ncourse the fog was very thick.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose that Cadogan West wished to make his way into the building\r\nafter hours; he would need three keys, would he not, before he could\r\nreach the papers?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he would. The key of the outer door, the key of the office, and\r\nthe key of the safe.”\r\n\r\n“Only Sir James Walter and you had those keys?”\r\n\r\n“I had no keys of the doors—only of the safe.”\r\n\r\n“Was Sir James a man who was orderly in his habits?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think he was. I know that so far as those three keys are\r\nconcerned he kept them on the same ring. I have often seen them there.”\r\n\r\n“And that ring went with him to London?”\r\n\r\n“He said so.”\r\n\r\n“And your key never left your possession?”\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“Then West, if he is the culprit, must have had a duplicate. And yet\r\nnone was found upon his body. One other point: if a clerk in this\r\noffice desired to sell the plans, would it not be simpler to copy the\r\nplans for himself than to take the originals, as was actually done?”\r\n\r\n“It would take considerable technical knowledge to copy the plans in an\r\neffective way.”\r\n\r\n“But I suppose either Sir James, or you, or West has that technical\r\nknowledge?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt we had, but I beg you won’t try to drag me into the matter,\r\nMr. Holmes. What is the use of our speculating in this way when the\r\noriginal plans were actually found on West?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it is certainly singular that he should run the risk of taking\r\noriginals if he could safely have taken copies, which would have\r\nequally served his turn.”\r\n\r\n“Singular, no doubt—and yet he did so.”\r\n\r\n“Every inquiry in this case reveals something inexplicable. Now there\r\nare three papers still missing. They are, as I understand, the vital\r\nones.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is so.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say that anyone holding these three papers, and without\r\nthe seven others, could construct a Bruce-Partington submarine?”\r\n\r\n“I reported to that effect to the Admiralty. But to-day I have been\r\nover the drawings again, and I am not so sure of it. The double valves\r\nwith the automatic self-adjusting slots are drawn in one of the papers\r\nwhich have been returned. Until the foreigners had invented that for\r\nthemselves they could not make the boat. Of course they might soon get\r\nover the difficulty.”\r\n\r\n“But the three missing drawings are the most important?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly.”\r\n\r\n“I think, with your permission, I will now take a stroll round the\r\npremises. I do not recall any other question which I desired to ask.”\r\n\r\nHe examined the lock of the safe, the door of the room, and finally the\r\niron shutters of the window. It was only when we were on the lawn\r\noutside that his interest was strongly excited. There was a laurel bush\r\noutside the window, and several of the branches bore signs of having\r\nbeen twisted or snapped. He examined them carefully with his lens, and\r\nthen some dim and vague marks upon the earth beneath. Finally he asked\r\nthe chief clerk to close the iron shutters, and he pointed out to me\r\nthat they hardly met in the centre, and that it would be possible for\r\nanyone outside to see what was going on within the room.\r\n\r\n“The indications are ruined by three days’ delay. They may mean\r\nsomething or nothing. Well, Watson, I do not think that Woolwich can\r\nhelp us further. It is a small crop which we have gathered. Let us see\r\nif we can do better in London.”\r\n\r\nYet we added one more sheaf to our harvest before we left Woolwich\r\nStation. The clerk in the ticket office was able to say with confidence\r\nthat he saw Cadogan West—whom he knew well by sight—upon the Monday\r\nnight, and that he went to London by the 8:15 to London Bridge. He was\r\nalone and took a single third-class ticket. The clerk was struck at the\r\ntime by his excited and nervous manner. So shaky was he that he could\r\nhardly pick up his change, and the clerk had helped him with it. A\r\nreference to the timetable showed that the 8:15 was the first train\r\nwhich it was possible for West to take after he had left the lady about\r\n7:30.\r\n\r\n“Let us reconstruct, Watson,” said Holmes after half an hour of\r\nsilence. “I am not aware that in all our joint researches we have ever\r\nhad a case which was more difficult to get at. Every fresh advance\r\nwhich we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. And yet we have surely\r\nmade some appreciable progress.\r\n\r\n“The effect of our inquiries at Woolwich has in the main been against\r\nyoung Cadogan West; but the indications at the window would lend\r\nthemselves to a more favourable hypothesis. Let us suppose, for\r\nexample, that he had been approached by some foreign agent. It might\r\nhave been done under such pledges as would have prevented him from\r\nspeaking of it, and yet would have affected his thoughts in the\r\ndirection indicated by his remarks to his fiancée. Very good. We will\r\nnow suppose that as he went to the theatre with the young lady he\r\nsuddenly, in the fog, caught a glimpse of this same agent going in the\r\ndirection of the office. He was an impetuous man, quick in his\r\ndecisions. Everything gave way to his duty. He followed the man,\r\nreached the window, saw the abstraction of the documents, and pursued\r\nthe thief. In this way we get over the objection that no one would take\r\noriginals when he could make copies. This outsider had to take\r\noriginals. So far it holds together.”\r\n\r\n“What is the next step?”\r\n\r\n“Then we come into difficulties. One would imagine that under such\r\ncircumstances the first act of young Cadogan West would be to seize the\r\nvillain and raise the alarm. Why did he not do so? Could it have been\r\nan official superior who took the papers? That would explain West’s\r\nconduct. Or could the chief have given West the slip in the fog, and\r\nWest started at once to London to head him off from his own rooms,\r\npresuming that he knew where the rooms were? The call must have been\r\nvery pressing, since he left his girl standing in the fog and made no\r\neffort to communicate with her. Our scent runs cold here, and there is\r\na vast gap between either hypothesis and the laying of West’s body,\r\nwith seven papers in his pocket, on the roof of a Metropolitan train.\r\nMy instinct now is to work from the other end. If Mycroft has given us\r\nthe list of addresses we may be able to pick our man and follow two\r\ntracks instead of one.”\r\n\r\nSurely enough, a note awaited us at Baker Street. A government\r\nmessenger had brought it post-haste. Holmes glanced at it and threw it\r\nover to me.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous small fry, but few who would handle so big an\r\naffair. The only men worth considering are Adolph Mayer, of 13, Great\r\nGeorge Street, Westminster; Louis La Rothière, of Campden Mansions,\r\nNotting Hill; and Hugo Oberstein, 13, Caulfield Gardens, Kensington.\r\nThe latter was known to be in town on Monday and is now reported as\r\nhaving left. Glad to hear you have seen some light. The Cabinet awaits\r\nyour final report with the utmost anxiety. Urgent representations have\r\narrived from the very highest quarter. The whole force of the State is\r\nat your back if you should need it.—Mycroft.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid,” said Holmes, smiling, “that all the Queen’s horses and\r\nall the Queen’s men cannot avail in this matter.” He had spread out his\r\nbig map of London and leaned eagerly over it. “Well, well,” said he\r\npresently with an exclamation of satisfaction, “things are turning a\r\nlittle in our direction at last. Why, Watson, I do honestly believe\r\nthat we are going to pull it off, after all.” He slapped me on the\r\nshoulder with a sudden burst of hilarity. “I am going out now. It is\r\nonly a reconnaissance. I will do nothing serious without my trusted\r\ncomrade and biographer at my elbow. Do you stay here, and the odds are\r\nthat you will see me again in an hour or two. If time hangs heavy get\r\nfoolscap and a pen, and begin your narrative of how we saved the\r\nState.”\r\n\r\nI felt some reflection of his elation in my own mind, for I knew well\r\nthat he would not depart so far from his usual austerity of demeanour\r\nunless there was good cause for exultation. All the long November\r\nevening I waited, filled with impatience for his return. At last,\r\nshortly after nine o’clock, there arrived a messenger with a note:\r\n\r\nAm dining at Goldini’s Restaurant, Gloucester Road, Kensington. Please\r\ncome at once and join me there. Bring with you a jemmy, a dark lantern,\r\na chisel, and a revolver.—S.H.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a nice equipment for a respectable citizen to carry through the\r\ndim, fog-draped streets. I stowed them all discreetly away in my\r\novercoat and drove straight to the address given. There sat my friend\r\nat a little round table near the door of the garish Italian restaurant.\r\n\r\n“Have you had something to eat? Then join me in a coffee and curaçao.\r\nTry one of the proprietor’s cigars. They are less poisonous than one\r\nwould expect. Have you the tools?”\r\n\r\n“They are here, in my overcoat.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent. Let me give you a short sketch of what I have done, with\r\nsome indication of what we are about to do. Now it must be evident to\r\nyou, Watson, that this young man’s body was _placed_ on the roof of the\r\ntrain. That was clear from the instant that I determined the fact that\r\nit was from the roof, and not from a carriage, that he had fallen.”\r\n\r\n“Could it not have been dropped from a bridge?”\r\n\r\n“I should say it was impossible. If you examine the roofs you will find\r\nthat they are slightly rounded, and there is no railing round them.\r\nTherefore, we can say for certain that young Cadogan West was placed on\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“How could he be placed there?”\r\n\r\n“That was the question which we had to answer. There is only one\r\npossible way. You are aware that the Underground runs clear of tunnels\r\nat some points in the West End. I had a vague memory that as I have\r\ntravelled by it I have occasionally seen windows just above my head.\r\nNow, suppose that a train halted under such a window, would there be\r\nany difficulty in laying a body upon the roof?”\r\n\r\n“It seems most improbable.”\r\n\r\n“We must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other contingencies\r\nfail, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Here all\r\nother contingencies _have_ failed. When I found that the leading\r\ninternational agent, who had just left London, lived in a row of houses\r\nwhich abutted upon the Underground, I was so pleased that you were a\r\nlittle astonished at my sudden frivolity.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that was it, was it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that was it. Mr. Hugo Oberstein, of 13, Caulfield Gardens, had\r\nbecome my objective. I began my operations at Gloucester Road Station,\r\nwhere a very helpful official walked with me along the track and\r\nallowed me to satisfy myself not only that the back-stair windows of\r\nCaulfield Gardens open on the line but the even more essential fact\r\nthat, owing to the intersection of one of the larger railways, the\r\nUnderground trains are frequently held motionless for some minutes at\r\nthat very spot.”\r\n\r\n“Splendid, Holmes! You have got it!”\r\n\r\n“So far—so far, Watson. We advance, but the goal is afar. Well, having\r\nseen the back of Caulfield Gardens, I visited the front and satisfied\r\nmyself that the bird was indeed flown. It is a considerable house,\r\nunfurnished, so far as I could judge, in the upper rooms. Oberstein\r\nlived there with a single valet, who was probably a confederate\r\nentirely in his confidence. We must bear in mind that Oberstein has\r\ngone to the Continent to dispose of his booty, but not with any idea of\r\nflight; for he had no reason to fear a warrant, and the idea of an\r\namateur domiciliary visit would certainly never occur to him. Yet that\r\nis precisely what we are about to make.”\r\n\r\n“Could we not get a warrant and legalise it?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly on the evidence.”\r\n\r\n“What can we hope to do?”\r\n\r\n“We cannot tell what correspondence may be there.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like it, Holmes.”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, you shall keep watch in the street. I’ll do the\r\ncriminal part. It’s not a time to stick at trifles. Think of Mycroft’s\r\nnote, of the Admiralty, the Cabinet, the exalted person who waits for\r\nnews. We are bound to go.”\r\n\r\nMy answer was to rise from the table.\r\n\r\n“You are right, Holmes. We are bound to go.”\r\n\r\nHe sprang up and shook me by the hand.\r\n\r\n“I knew you would not shrink at the last,” said he, and for a moment I\r\nsaw something in his eyes which was nearer to tenderness than I had\r\never seen. The next instant he was his masterful, practical self once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n“It is nearly half a mile, but there is no hurry. Let us walk,” said\r\nhe. “Don’t drop the instruments, I beg. Your arrest as a suspicious\r\ncharacter would be a most unfortunate complication.”\r\n\r\nCaulfield Gardens was one of those lines of flat-faced pillared, and\r\nporticoed houses which are so prominent a product of the middle\r\nVictorian epoch in the West End of London. Next door there appeared to\r\nbe a children’s party, for the merry buzz of young voices and the\r\nclatter of a piano resounded through the night. The fog still hung\r\nabout and screened us with its friendly shade. Holmes had lit his\r\nlantern and flashed it upon the massive door.\r\n\r\n“This is a serious proposition,” said he. “It is certainly bolted as\r\nwell as locked. We would do better in the area. There is an excellent\r\narchway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude.\r\nGive me a hand, Watson, and I’ll do the same for you.”\r\n\r\nA minute later we were both in the area. Hardly had we reached the dark\r\nshadows before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog above. As\r\nits soft rhythm died away, Holmes set to work upon the lower door. I\r\nsaw him stoop and strain until with a sharp crash it flew open. We\r\nsprang through into the dark passage, closing the area door behind us.\r\nHolmes led the way up the curving, uncarpeted stair. His little fan of\r\nyellow light shone upon a low window.\r\n\r\n“Here we are, Watson—this must be the one.” He threw it open, and as he\r\ndid so there was a low, harsh murmur, growing steadily into a loud roar\r\nas a train dashed past us in the darkness. Holmes swept his light along\r\nthe window-sill. It was thickly coated with soot from the passing\r\nengines, but the black surface was blurred and rubbed in places.\r\n\r\n“You can see where they rested the body. Halloa, Watson! what is this?\r\nThere can be no doubt that it is a blood mark.” He was pointing to\r\nfaint discolorations along the woodwork of the window. “Here it is on\r\nthe stone of the stair also. The demonstration is complete. Let us stay\r\nhere until a train stops.”\r\n\r\nWe had not long to wait. The very next train roared from the tunnel as\r\nbefore, but slowed in the open, and then, with a creaking of brakes,\r\npulled up immediately beneath us. It was not four feet from the\r\nwindow-ledge to the roof of the carriages. Holmes softly closed the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n“So far we are justified,” said he. “What do you think of it, Watson?”\r\n\r\n“A masterpiece. You have never risen to a greater height.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot agree with you there. From the moment that I conceived the\r\nidea of the body being upon the roof, which surely was not a very\r\nabstruse one, all the rest was inevitable. If it were not for the grave\r\ninterests involved the affair up to this point would be insignificant.\r\nOur difficulties are still before us. But perhaps we may find something\r\nhere which may help us.”\r\n\r\nWe had ascended the kitchen stair and entered the suite of rooms upon\r\nthe first floor. One was a dining-room, severely furnished and\r\ncontaining nothing of interest. A second was a bedroom, which also drew\r\nblank. The remaining room appeared more promising, and my companion\r\nsettled down to a systematic examination. It was littered with books\r\nand papers, and was evidently used as a study. Swiftly and methodically\r\nHolmes turned over the contents of drawer after drawer and cupboard\r\nafter cupboard, but no gleam of success came to brighten his austere\r\nface. At the end of an hour he was no further than when he started.\r\n\r\n“The cunning dog has covered his tracks,” said he. “He has left nothing\r\nto incriminate him. His dangerous correspondence has been destroyed or\r\nremoved. This is our last chance.”\r\n\r\nIt was a small tin cash-box which stood upon the writing-desk. Holmes\r\npried it open with his chisel. Several rolls of paper were within,\r\ncovered with figures and calculations, without any note to show to what\r\nthey referred. The recurring words, “water pressure” and “pressure to\r\nthe square inch” suggested some possible relation to a submarine.\r\nHolmes tossed them all impatiently aside. There only remained an\r\nenvelope with some small newspaper slips inside it. He shook them out\r\non the table, and at once I saw by his eager face that his hopes had\r\nbeen raised.\r\n\r\n“What’s this, Watson? Eh? What’s this? Record of a series of messages\r\nin the advertisements of a paper. _Daily Telegraph_ agony column by the\r\nprint and paper. Right-hand top corner of a page. No dates—but messages\r\narrange themselves. This must be the first:\r\n\r\n“Hoped to hear sooner. Terms agreed to. Write fully to address given on\r\ncard.—Pierrot.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Next comes:\r\n\r\n“Too complex for description. Must have full report. Stuff awaits you\r\nwhen goods delivered.—Pierrot.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Then comes:\r\n\r\n“Matter presses. Must withdraw offer unless contract completed. Make\r\nappointment by letter. Will confirm by advertisement.—Pierrot.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Finally:\r\n\r\n“Monday night after nine. Two taps. Only ourselves. Do not be so\r\nsuspicious. Payment in hard cash when goods delivered.—Pierrot.\r\n\r\n\r\n“A fairly complete record, Watson! If we could only get at the man at\r\nthe other end!” He sat lost in thought, tapping his fingers on the\r\ntable. Finally he sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps it won’t be so difficult, after all. There is nothing\r\nmore to be done here, Watson. I think we might drive round to the\r\noffices of the _Daily Telegraph_, and so bring a good day’s work to a\r\nconclusion.”\r\n\r\nMycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round by appointment after\r\nbreakfast next day and Sherlock Holmes had recounted to them our\r\nproceedings of the day before. The professional shook his head over our\r\nconfessed burglary.\r\n\r\n“We can’t do these things in the force, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “No\r\nwonder you get results that are beyond us. But some of these days\r\nyou’ll go too far, and you’ll find yourself and your friend in\r\ntrouble.”\r\n\r\n“For England, home and beauty—eh, Watson? Martyrs on the altar of our\r\ncountry. But what do you think of it, Mycroft?”\r\n\r\n“Excellent, Sherlock! Admirable! But what use will you make of it?”\r\n\r\nHolmes picked up the _Daily Telegraph_ which lay upon the table.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen Pierrot’s advertisement to-day?”\r\n\r\n“What? Another one?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, here it is:\r\n\r\n“To-night. Same hour. Same place. Two taps. Most vitally important.\r\nYour own safety at stake.—Pierrot.\r\n\r\n\r\n“By George!” cried Lestrade. “If he answers that we’ve got him!”\r\n\r\n“That was my idea when I put it in. I think if you could both make it\r\nconvenient to come with us about eight o’clock to Caulfield Gardens we\r\nmight possibly get a little nearer to a solution.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable characteristics of Sherlock Holmes was his\r\npower of throwing his brain out of action and switching all his\r\nthoughts on to lighter things whenever he had convinced himself that he\r\ncould no longer work to advantage. I remember that during the whole of\r\nthat memorable day he lost himself in a monograph which he had\r\nundertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus. For my own part I had\r\nnone of this power of detachment, and the day, in consequence, appeared\r\nto be interminable. The great national importance of the issue, the\r\nsuspense in high quarters, the direct nature of the experiment which we\r\nwere trying—all combined to work upon my nerve. It was a relief to me\r\nwhen at last, after a light dinner, we set out upon our expedition.\r\nLestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at the outside of Gloucester\r\nRoad Station. The area door of Oberstein’s house had been left open the\r\nnight before, and it was necessary for me, as Mycroft Holmes absolutely\r\nand indignantly declined to climb the railings, to pass in and open the\r\nhall door. By nine o’clock we were all seated in the study, waiting\r\npatiently for our man.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed and yet another. When eleven struck, the measured beat\r\nof the great church clock seemed to sound the dirge of our hopes.\r\nLestrade and Mycroft were fidgeting in their seats and looking twice a\r\nminute at their watches. Holmes sat silent and composed, his eyelids\r\nhalf shut, but every sense on the alert. He raised his head with a\r\nsudden jerk.\r\n\r\n“He is coming,” said he.\r\n\r\nThere had been a furtive step past the door. Now it returned. We heard\r\na shuffling sound outside, and then two sharp taps with the knocker.\r\nHolmes rose, motioning us to remain seated. The gas in the hall was a\r\nmere point of light. He opened the outer door, and then as a dark\r\nfigure slipped past him he closed and fastened it. “This way!” we heard\r\nhim say, and a moment later our man stood before us. Holmes had\r\nfollowed him closely, and as the man turned with a cry of surprise and\r\nalarm he caught him by the collar and threw him back into the room.\r\nBefore our prisoner had recovered his balance the door was shut and\r\nHolmes standing with his back against it. The man glared round him,\r\nstaggered, and fell senseless upon the floor. With the shock, his\r\nbroad-brimmed hat flew from his head, his cravat slipped down from his\r\nlips, and there were the long light beard and the soft, handsome\r\ndelicate features of Colonel Valentine Walter.\r\n\r\nHolmes gave a whistle of surprise.\r\n\r\n“You can write me down an ass this time, Watson,” said he. “This was\r\nnot the bird that I was looking for.”\r\n\r\n“Who is he?” asked Mycroft eagerly.\r\n\r\n“The younger brother of the late Sir James Walter, the head of the\r\nSubmarine Department. Yes, yes; I see the fall of the cards. He is\r\ncoming to. I think that you had best leave his examination to me.”\r\n\r\nWe had carried the prostrate body to the sofa. Now our prisoner sat up,\r\nlooked round him with a horror-stricken face, and passed his hand over\r\nhis forehead, like one who cannot believe his own senses.\r\n\r\n“What is this?” he asked. “I came here to visit Mr. Oberstein.”\r\n\r\n“Everything is known, Colonel Walter,” said Holmes. “How an English\r\ngentleman could behave in such a manner is beyond my comprehension. But\r\nyour whole correspondence and relations with Oberstein are within our\r\nknowledge. So also are the circumstances connected with the death of\r\nyoung Cadogan West. Let me advise you to gain at least the small credit\r\nfor repentance and confession, since there are still some details which\r\nwe can only learn from your lips.”\r\n\r\nThe man groaned and sank his face in his hands. We waited, but he was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n“I can assure you,” said Holmes, “that every essential is already\r\nknown. We know that you were pressed for money; that you took an\r\nimpress of the keys which your brother held; and that you entered into\r\na correspondence with Oberstein, who answered your letters through the\r\nadvertisement columns of the _Daily Telegraph_. We are aware that you\r\nwent down to the office in the fog on Monday night, but that you were\r\nseen and followed by young Cadogan West, who had probably some previous\r\nreason to suspect you. He saw your theft, but could not give the alarm,\r\nas it was just possible that you were taking the papers to your brother\r\nin London. Leaving all his private concerns, like the good citizen that\r\nhe was, he followed you closely in the fog and kept at your heels until\r\nyou reached this very house. There he intervened, and then it was,\r\nColonel Walter, that to treason you added the more terrible crime of\r\nmurder.”\r\n\r\n“I did not! I did not! Before God I swear that I did not!” cried our\r\nwretched prisoner.\r\n\r\n“Tell us, then, how Cadogan West met his end before you laid him upon\r\nthe roof of a railway carriage.”\r\n\r\n“I will. I swear to you that I will. I did the rest. I confess it. It\r\nwas just as you say. A Stock Exchange debt had to be paid. I needed the\r\nmoney badly. Oberstein offered me five thousand. It was to save myself\r\nfrom ruin. But as to murder, I am as innocent as you.”\r\n\r\n“What happened, then?”\r\n\r\n“He had his suspicions before, and he followed me as you describe. I\r\nnever knew it until I was at the very door. It was thick fog, and one\r\ncould not see three yards. I had given two taps and Oberstein had come\r\nto the door. The young man rushed up and demanded to know what we were\r\nabout to do with the papers. Oberstein had a short life-preserver. He\r\nalways carried it with him. As West forced his way after us into the\r\nhouse Oberstein struck him on the head. The blow was a fatal one. He\r\nwas dead within five minutes. There he lay in the hall, and we were at\r\nour wits’ end what to do. Then Oberstein had this idea about the trains\r\nwhich halted under his back window. But first he examined the papers\r\nwhich I had brought. He said that three of them were essential, and\r\nthat he must keep them. ‘You cannot keep them,’ said I. ‘There will be\r\na dreadful row at Woolwich if they are not returned.’ ‘I must keep\r\nthem,’ said he, ‘for they are so technical that it is impossible in the\r\ntime to make copies.’ ‘Then they must all go back together to-night,’\r\nsaid I. He thought for a little, and then he cried out that he had it.\r\n‘Three I will keep,’ said he. ‘The others we will stuff into the pocket\r\nof this young man. When he is found the whole business will assuredly\r\nbe put to his account.’ I could see no other way out of it, so we did\r\nas he suggested. We waited half an hour at the window before a train\r\nstopped. It was so thick that nothing could be seen, and we had no\r\ndifficulty in lowering West’s body on to the train. That was the end of\r\nthe matter so far as I was concerned.”\r\n\r\n“And your brother?”\r\n\r\n“He said nothing, but he had caught me once with his keys, and I think\r\nthat he suspected. I read in his eyes that he suspected. As you know,\r\nhe never held up his head again.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence in the room. It was broken by Mycroft Holmes.\r\n\r\n“Can you not make reparation? It would ease your conscience, and\r\npossibly your punishment.”\r\n\r\n“What reparation can I make?”\r\n\r\n“Where is Oberstein with the papers?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“Did he give you no address?”\r\n\r\n“He said that letters to the Hôtel du Louvre, Paris, would eventually\r\nreach him.”\r\n\r\n“Then reparation is still within your power,” said Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n“I will do anything I can. I owe this fellow no particular good-will.\r\nHe has been my ruin and my downfall.”\r\n\r\n“Here are paper and pen. Sit at this desk and write to my dictation.\r\nDirect the envelope to the address given. That is right. Now the\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n“Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n“With regard to our transaction, you will no doubt have observed by now\r\nthat one essential detail is missing. I have a tracing which will make\r\nit complete. This has involved me in extra trouble, however, and I must\r\nask you for a further advance of five hundred pounds. I will not trust\r\nit to the post, nor will I take anything but gold or notes. I would\r\ncome to you abroad, but it would excite remark if I left the country at\r\npresent. Therefore I shall expect to meet you in the smoking-room of\r\nthe Charing Cross Hotel at noon on Saturday. Remember that only English\r\nnotes, or gold, will be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n“That will do very well. I shall be very much surprised if it does not\r\nfetch our man.”\r\n\r\nAnd it did! It is a matter of history—that secret history of a nation\r\nwhich is often so much more intimate and interesting than its public\r\nchronicles—that Oberstein, eager to complete the coup of his lifetime,\r\ncame to the lure and was safely engulfed for fifteen years in a British\r\nprison. In his trunk were found the invaluable Bruce-Partington plans,\r\nwhich he had put up for auction in all the naval centres of Europe.\r\n\r\nColonel Walter died in prison towards the end of the second year of his\r\nsentence. As to Holmes, he returned refreshed to his monograph upon the\r\nPolyphonic Motets of Lassus, which has since been printed for private\r\ncirculation, and is said by experts to be the last word upon the\r\nsubject. Some weeks afterwards I learned incidentally that my friend\r\nspent a day at Windsor, whence he returned with a remarkably fine\r\nemerald tie-pin. When I asked him if he had bought it, he answered that\r\nit was a present from a certain gracious lady in whose interests he had\r\nonce been fortunate enough to carry out a small commission. He said no\r\nmore; but I fancy that I could guess at that lady’s august name, and I\r\nhave little doubt that the emerald pin will forever recall to my\r\nfriend’s memory the adventure of the Bruce-Partington plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adventure of the Devil’s Foot\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recording from time to time some of the curious experiences and\r\ninteresting recollections which I associate with my long and intimate\r\nfriendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have continually been faced by\r\ndifficulties caused by his own aversion to publicity. To his sombre and\r\ncynical spirit all popular applause was always abhorrent, and nothing\r\namused him more at the end of a successful case than to hand over the\r\nactual exposure to some orthodox official, and to listen with a mocking\r\nsmile to the general chorus of misplaced congratulation. It was indeed\r\nthis attitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not any lack of\r\ninteresting material which has caused me of late years to lay very few\r\nof my records before the public. My participation in some of his\r\nadventures was always a privilege which entailed discretion and\r\nreticence upon me.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram\r\nfrom Holmes last Tuesday—he has never been known to write where a\r\ntelegram would serve—in the following terms: “Why not tell them of the\r\nCornish horror—strangest case I have handled.” I have no idea what\r\nbackward sweep of memory had brought the matter fresh to his mind, or\r\nwhat freak had caused him to desire that I should recount it; but I\r\nhasten, before another cancelling telegram may arrive, to hunt out the\r\nnotes which give me the exact details of the case and to lay the\r\nnarrative before my readers.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that Holmes’s iron\r\nconstitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of constant\r\nhard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by occasional\r\nindiscretions of his own. In March of that year Dr. Moore Agar, of\r\nHarley Street, whose dramatic introduction to Holmes I may some day\r\nrecount, gave positive injunctions that the famous private agent lay\r\naside all his cases and surrender himself to complete rest if he wished\r\nto avert an absolute breakdown. The state of his health was not a\r\nmatter in which he himself took the faintest interest, for his mental\r\ndetachment was absolute, but he was induced at last, on the threat of\r\nbeing permanently disqualified from work, to give himself a complete\r\nchange of scene and air. Thus it was that in the early spring of that\r\nyear we found ourselves together in a small cottage near Poldhu Bay, at\r\nthe further extremity of the Cornish peninsula.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well suited to the grim\r\nhumour of my patient. From the windows of our little whitewashed house,\r\nwhich stood high upon a grassy headland, we looked down upon the whole\r\nsinister semi-circle of Mounts Bay, that old death trap of sailing\r\nvessels, with its fringe of black cliffs and surge-swept reefs on which\r\ninnumerable seamen have met their end. With a northerly breeze it lies\r\nplacid and sheltered, inviting the storm-tossed craft to tack into it\r\nfor rest and protection.\r\n\r\nThen come the sudden swirl round of the wind, the blistering gale from\r\nthe south-west, the dragging anchor, the lee shore, and the last battle\r\nin the creaming breakers. The wise mariner stands far out from that\r\nevil place.\r\n\r\nOn the land side our surroundings were as sombre as on the sea. It was\r\na country of rolling moors, lonely and dun-coloured, with an occasional\r\nchurch tower to mark the site of some old-world village. In every\r\ndirection upon these moors there were traces of some vanished race\r\nwhich had passed utterly away, and left as its sole record strange\r\nmonuments of stone, irregular mounds which contained the burned ashes\r\nof the dead, and curious earthworks which hinted at prehistoric strife.\r\nThe glamour and mystery of the place, with its sinister atmosphere of\r\nforgotten nations, appealed to the imagination of my friend, and he\r\nspent much of his time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the\r\nmoor. The ancient Cornish language had also arrested his attention, and\r\nhe had, I remember, conceived the idea that it was akin to the\r\nChaldean, and had been largely derived from the Phœnician traders in\r\ntin. He had received a consignment of books upon philology and was\r\nsettling down to develop this thesis when suddenly, to my sorrow and to\r\nhis unfeigned delight, we found ourselves, even in that land of dreams,\r\nplunged into a problem at our very doors which was more intense, more\r\nengrossing, and infinitely more mysterious than any of those which had\r\ndriven us from London. Our simple life and peaceful, healthy routine\r\nwere violently interrupted, and we were precipitated into the midst of\r\na series of events which caused the utmost excitement not only in\r\nCornwall but throughout the whole west of England. Many of my readers\r\nmay retain some recollection of what was called at the time “The\r\nCornish Horror,” though a most imperfect account of the matter reached\r\nthe London press. Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true\r\ndetails of this inconceivable affair to the public.\r\n\r\nI have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted this\r\npart of Cornwall. The nearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick\r\nWollas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered\r\nround an ancient, moss-grown church. The vicar of the parish, Mr.\r\nRoundhay, was something of an archæologist, and as such Holmes had made\r\nhis acquaintance. He was a middle-aged man, portly and affable, with a\r\nconsiderable fund of local lore. At his invitation we had taken tea at\r\nthe vicarage and had come to know, also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis, an\r\nindependent gentleman, who increased the clergyman’s scanty resources\r\nby taking rooms in his large, straggling house. The vicar, being a\r\nbachelor, was glad to come to such an arrangement, though he had little\r\nin common with his lodger, who was a thin, dark, spectacled man, with a\r\nstoop which gave the impression of actual, physical deformity. I\r\nremember that during our short visit we found the vicar garrulous, but\r\nhis lodger strangely reticent, a sad-faced, introspective man, sitting\r\nwith averted eyes, brooding apparently upon his own affairs.\r\n\r\nThese were the two men who entered abruptly into our little\r\nsitting-room on Tuesday, March the 16th, shortly after our breakfast\r\nhour, as we were smoking together, preparatory to our daily excursion\r\nupon the moors.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Holmes,” said the vicar in an agitated voice, “the most\r\nextraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night. It is\r\nthe most unheard-of business. We can only regard it as a special\r\nProvidence that you should chance to be here at the time, for in all\r\nEngland you are the one man we need.”\r\n\r\nI glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes; but Holmes\r\ntook his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound\r\nwho hears the view-halloa. He waved his hand to the sofa, and our\r\npalpitating visitor with his agitated companion sat side by side upon\r\nit. Mr. Mortimer Tregennis was more self-contained than the clergyman,\r\nbut the twitching of his thin hands and the brightness of his dark eyes\r\nshowed that they shared a common emotion.\r\n\r\n“Shall I speak or you?” he asked of the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may be, and\r\nthe vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the\r\nspeaking,” said Holmes.\r\n\r\nI glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with the formally dressed\r\nlodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which Holmes’s\r\nsimple deduction had brought to their faces.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I had best say a few words first,” said the vicar, “and then\r\nyou can judge if you will listen to the details from Mr. Tregennis, or\r\nwhether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this mysterious\r\naffair. I may explain, then, that our friend here spent last evening in\r\nthe company of his two brothers, Owen and George, and of his sister\r\nBrenda, at their house of Tredannick Wartha, which is near the old\r\nstone cross upon the moor. He left them shortly after ten o’clock,\r\nplaying cards round the dining-room table, in excellent health and\r\nspirits. This morning, being an early riser, he walked in that\r\ndirection before breakfast and was overtaken by the carriage of Dr.\r\nRichards, who explained that he had just been sent for on a most urgent\r\ncall to Tredannick Wartha. Mr. Mortimer Tregennis naturally went with\r\nhim. When he arrived at Tredannick Wartha he found an extraordinary\r\nstate of things. His two brothers and his sister were seated round the\r\ntable exactly as he had left them, the cards still spread in front of\r\nthem and the candles burned down to their sockets. The sister lay back\r\nstone-dead in her chair, while the two brothers sat on each side of her\r\nlaughing, shouting, and singing, the senses stricken clean out of them.\r\nAll three of them, the dead woman and the two demented men, retained\r\nupon their faces an expression of the utmost horror—a convulsion of\r\nterror which was dreadful to look upon. There was no sign of the\r\npresence of anyone in the house, except Mrs. Porter, the old cook and\r\nhousekeeper, who declared that she had slept deeply and heard no sound\r\nduring the night. Nothing had been stolen or disarranged, and there is\r\nabsolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has\r\nfrightened a woman to death and two strong men out of their senses.\r\nThere is the situation, Mr. Holmes, in a nutshell, and if you can help\r\nus to clear it up you will have done a great work.”\r\n\r\nI had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into the\r\nquiet which had been the object of our journey; but one glance at his\r\nintense face and contracted eyebrows told me how vain was now the\r\nexpectation. He sat for some little time in silence, absorbed in the\r\nstrange drama which had broken in upon our peace.\r\n\r\n“I will look into this matter,” he said at last. “On the face of it, it\r\nwould appear to be a case of a very exceptional nature. Have you been\r\nthere yourself, Mr. Roundhay?”\r\n\r\n“No, Mr. Holmes. Mr. Tregennis brought back the account to the\r\nvicarage, and I at once hurried over with him to consult you.”\r\n\r\n“How far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred?”\r\n\r\n“About a mile inland.”\r\n\r\n“Then we shall walk over together. But before we start I must ask you a\r\nfew questions, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis.”\r\n\r\nThe other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his\r\nmore controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive emotion\r\nof the clergyman. He sat with a pale, drawn face, his anxious gaze\r\nfixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands clasped convulsively together.\r\nHis pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience which\r\nhad befallen his family, and his dark eyes seemed to reflect something\r\nof the horror of the scene.\r\n\r\n“Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes,” said he eagerly. “It is a bad thing to\r\nspeak of, but I will answer you the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me about last night.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar has said, and my elder\r\nbrother George proposed a game of whist afterwards. We sat down about\r\nnine o’clock. It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to go. I left them\r\nall round the table, as merry as could be.”\r\n\r\n“Who let you out?”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out. I shut the hall door\r\nbehind me. The window of the room in which they sat was closed, but the\r\nblind was not drawn down. There was no change in door or window this\r\nmorning, or any reason to think that any stranger had been to the\r\nhouse. Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and Brenda\r\nlying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the chair.\r\nI’ll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as I\r\nlive.”\r\n\r\n“The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,” said\r\nHolmes. “I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any\r\nway account for them?”\r\n\r\n“It’s devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!” cried Mortimer Tregennis. “It is\r\nnot of this world. Something has come into that room which has dashed\r\nthe light of reason from their minds. What human contrivance could do\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“I fear,” said Holmes, “that if the matter is beyond humanity it is\r\ncertainly beyond me. Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations\r\nbefore we fall back upon such a theory as this. As to yourself, Mr.\r\nTregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family,\r\nsince they lived together and you had rooms apart?”\r\n\r\n“That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We\r\nwere a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold our venture to a\r\ncompany, and so retired with enough to keep us. I won’t deny that there\r\nwas some feeling about the division of the money and it stood between\r\nus for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we were the\r\nbest of friends together.”\r\n\r\n“Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does anything\r\nstand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the\r\ntragedy? Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which can help\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing at all, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Your people were in their usual spirits?”\r\n\r\n“Never better.”\r\n\r\n“Were they nervous people? Did they ever show any apprehension of\r\ncoming danger?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing of the kind.”\r\n\r\n“You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?”\r\n\r\nMortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment.\r\n\r\n“There is one thing that occurs to me,” said he at last. “As we sat at\r\nthe table my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my\r\npartner at cards, was facing it. I saw him once look hard over my\r\nshoulder, so I turned round and looked also. The blind was up and the\r\nwindow shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it\r\nseemed to me for a moment that I saw something moving among them. I\r\ncouldn’t even say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there was\r\nsomething there. When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me\r\nthat he had the same feeling. That is all that I can say.”\r\n\r\n“Did you not investigate?”\r\n\r\n“No; the matter passed as unimportant.”\r\n\r\n“You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?”\r\n\r\n“None at all.”\r\n\r\n“I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning.”\r\n\r\n“I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast. This\r\nmorning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook\r\nme. He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent\r\nmessage. I sprang in beside him and we drove on. When we got there we\r\nlooked into that dreadful room. The candles and the fire must have\r\nburned out hours before, and they had been sitting there in the dark\r\nuntil dawn had broken. The doctor said Brenda must have been dead at\r\nleast six hours. There were no signs of violence. She just lay across\r\nthe arm of the chair with that look on her face. George and Owen were\r\nsinging snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes. Oh, it was\r\nawful to see! I couldn’t stand it, and the doctor was as white as a\r\nsheet. Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we nearly\r\nhad him on our hands as well.”\r\n\r\n“Remarkable—most remarkable!” said Holmes, rising and taking his hat.\r\n“I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha without\r\nfurther delay. I confess that I have seldom known a case which at first\r\nsight presented a more singular problem.”\r\n\r\nOur proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the\r\ninvestigation. It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident\r\nwhich left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to\r\nthe spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding,\r\ncountry lane. While we made our way along it we heard the rattle of a\r\ncarriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass. As it drove\r\nby us I caught a glimpse through the closed window of a horribly\r\ncontorted, grinning face glaring out at us. Those staring eyes and\r\ngnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.\r\n\r\n“My brothers!” cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to his lips. “They are\r\ntaking them to Helston.”\r\n\r\nWe looked with horror after the black carriage, lumbering upon its way.\r\nThen we turned our steps towards this ill-omened house in which they\r\nhad met their strange fate.\r\n\r\nIt was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with\r\na considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well\r\nfilled with spring flowers. Towards this garden the window of the\r\nsitting-room fronted, and from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis,\r\nmust have come that thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a single\r\ninstant blasted their minds. Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully\r\namong the flower-plots and along the path before we entered the porch.\r\nSo absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over\r\nthe watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet and the\r\ngarden path. Inside the house we were met by the elderly Cornish\r\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the aid of a young girl, looked\r\nafter the wants of the family. She readily answered all Holmes’s\r\nquestions. She had heard nothing in the night. Her employers had all\r\nbeen in excellent spirits lately, and she had never known them more\r\ncheerful and prosperous. She had fainted with horror upon entering the\r\nroom in the morning and seeing that dreadful company round the table.\r\nShe had, when she recovered, thrown open the window to let the morning\r\nair in, and had run down to the lane, whence she sent a farm-lad for\r\nthe doctor. The lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see her. It\r\ntook four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum carriage. She\r\nwould not herself stay in the house another day and was starting that\r\nvery afternoon to rejoin her family at St. Ives.\r\n\r\nWe ascended the stairs and viewed the body. Miss Brenda Tregennis had\r\nbeen a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age. Her\r\ndark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death, but there still\r\nlingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been\r\nher last human emotion. From her bedroom we descended to the\r\nsitting-room, where this strange tragedy had actually occurred. The\r\ncharred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate. On the table were\r\nthe four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards scattered over\r\nits surface. The chairs had been moved back against the walls, but all\r\nelse was as it had been the night before. Holmes paced with light,\r\nswift steps about the room; he sat in the various chairs, drawing them\r\nup and reconstructing their positions. He tested how much of the garden\r\nwas visible; he examined the floor, the ceiling, and the fireplace; but\r\nnever once did I see that sudden brightening of his eyes and tightening\r\nof his lips which would have told me that he saw some gleam of light in\r\nthis utter darkness.\r\n\r\n“Why a fire?” he asked once. “Had they always a fire in this small room\r\non a spring evening?”\r\n\r\nMortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that\r\nreason, after his arrival, the fire was lit. “What are you going to do\r\nnow, Mr. Holmes?” he asked.\r\n\r\nMy friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm. “I think, Watson, that\r\nI shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so often\r\nand so justly condemned,” said he. “With your permission, gentlemen, we\r\nwill now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new factor\r\nis likely to come to our notice here. I will turn the facts over in my\r\nmind, Mr. Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will certainly\r\ncommunicate with you and the vicar. In the meantime I wish you both\r\ngood-morning.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that Holmes\r\nbroke his complete and absorbed silence. He sat coiled in his armchair,\r\nhis haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue swirl of his\r\ntobacco smoke, his black brows drawn down, his forehead contracted, his\r\neyes vacant and far away. Finally he laid down his pipe and sprang to\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n“It won’t do, Watson!” said he with a laugh. “Let us walk along the\r\ncliffs together and search for flint arrows. We are more likely to find\r\nthem than clues to this problem. To let the brain work without\r\nsufficient material is like racing an engine. It racks itself to\r\npieces. The sea air, sunshine, and patience, Watson—all else will come.\r\n\r\n“Now, let us calmly define our position, Watson,” he continued as we\r\nskirted the cliffs together. “Let us get a firm grip of the very little\r\nwhich we _do_ know, so that when fresh facts arise we may be ready to\r\nfit them into their places. I take it, in the first place, that neither\r\nof us is prepared to admit diabolical intrusions into the affairs of\r\nmen. Let us begin by ruling that entirely out of our minds. Very good.\r\nThere remain three persons who have been grievously stricken by some\r\nconscious or unconscious human agency. That is firm ground. Now, when\r\ndid this occur? Evidently, assuming his narrative to be true, it was\r\nimmediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left the room. That is a\r\nvery important point. The presumption is that it was within a few\r\nminutes afterwards. The cards still lay upon the table. It was already\r\npast their usual hour for bed. Yet they had not changed their position\r\nor pushed back their chairs. I repeat, then, that the occurrence was\r\nimmediately after his departure, and not later than eleven o’clock last\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n“Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the movements of\r\nMortimer Tregennis after he left the room. In this there is no\r\ndifficulty, and they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing my methods as\r\nyou do, you were, of course, conscious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot\r\nexpedient by which I obtained a clearer impress of his foot than might\r\notherwise have been possible. The wet, sandy path took it admirably.\r\nLast night was also wet, you will remember, and it was not\r\ndifficult—having obtained a sample print—to pick out his track among\r\nothers and to follow his movements. He appears to have walked away\r\nswiftly in the direction of the vicarage.\r\n\r\n“If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some\r\noutside person affected the card-players, how can we reconstruct that\r\nperson, and how was such an impression of horror conveyed? Mrs. Porter\r\nmay be eliminated. She is evidently harmless. Is there any evidence\r\nthat someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced\r\nso terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their\r\nsenses? The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer\r\nTregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement\r\nin the garden. That is certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy,\r\ncloudy, and dark. Anyone who had the design to alarm these people would\r\nbe compelled to place his very face against the glass before he could\r\nbe seen. There is a three-foot flower-border outside this window, but\r\nno indication of a footmark. It is difficult to imagine, then, how an\r\noutsider could have made so terrible an impression upon the company,\r\nnor have we found any possible motive for so strange and elaborate an\r\nattempt. You perceive our difficulties, Watson?”\r\n\r\n“They are only too clear,” I answered with conviction.\r\n\r\n“And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not\r\ninsurmountable,” said Holmes. “I fancy that among your extensive\r\narchives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure.\r\nMeanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are\r\navailable, and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of\r\nneolithic man.”\r\n\r\nI may have commented upon my friend’s power of mental detachment, but\r\nnever have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in\r\nCornwall when for two hours he discoursed upon celts, arrowheads, and\r\nshards, as lightly as if no sinister mystery were waiting for his\r\nsolution. It was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our\r\ncottage that we found a visitor awaiting us, who soon brought our minds\r\nback to the matter in hand. Neither of us needed to be told who that\r\nvisitor was. The huge body, the craggy and deeply seamed face with the\r\nfierce eyes and hawk-like nose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed\r\nour cottage ceiling, the beard—golden at the fringes and white near the\r\nlips, save for the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigar—all these\r\nwere as well known in London as in Africa, and could only be associated\r\nwith the tremendous personality of Dr. Leon Sterndale, the great\r\nlion-hunter and explorer.\r\n\r\nWe had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice\r\ncaught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths. He made no\r\nadvances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him,\r\nas it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him\r\nto spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a\r\nsmall bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance. Here,\r\namid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life,\r\nattending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed to\r\nthe affairs of his neighbours. It was a surprise to me, therefore, to\r\nhear him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any\r\nadvance in his reconstruction of this mysterious episode. “The county\r\npolice are utterly at fault,” said he, “but perhaps your wider\r\nexperience has suggested some conceivable explanation. My only claim to\r\nbeing taken into your confidence is that during my many residences here\r\nI have come to know this family of Tregennis very well—indeed, upon my\r\nCornish mother’s side I could call them cousins—and their strange fate\r\nhas naturally been a great shock to me. I may tell you that I had got\r\nas far as Plymouth upon my way to Africa, but the news reached me this\r\nmorning, and I came straight back again to help in the inquiry.”\r\n\r\nHolmes raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“Did you lose your boat through it?”\r\n\r\n“I will take the next.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me! that is friendship indeed.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you they were relatives.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so—cousins of your mother. Was your baggage aboard the ship?”\r\n\r\n“Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.”\r\n\r\n“I see. But surely this event could not have found its way into the\r\nPlymouth morning papers.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; I had a telegram.”\r\n\r\n“Might I ask from whom?”\r\n\r\nA shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.\r\n\r\n“You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.”\r\n\r\n“It is my business.”\r\n\r\nWith an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.\r\n\r\n“I have no objection to telling you,” he said. “It was Mr. Roundhay,\r\nthe vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Holmes. “I may say in answer to your original\r\nquestion that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of\r\nthis case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion. It\r\nwould be premature to say more.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any\r\nparticular direction?”\r\n\r\n“No, I can hardly answer that.”\r\n\r\n“Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit.” The famous\r\ndoctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-humour, and within\r\nfive minutes Holmes had followed him. I saw him no more until the\r\nevening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face which\r\nassured me that he had made no great progress with his investigation.\r\nHe glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw it into the grate.\r\n\r\n“From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,” he said. “I learned the name of it\r\nfrom the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale’s\r\naccount was true. It appears that he did indeed spend last night there,\r\nand that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to\r\nAfrica, while he returned to be present at this investigation. What do\r\nyou make of that, Watson?”\r\n\r\n“He is deeply interested.”\r\n\r\n“Deeply interested—yes. There is a thread here which we had not yet\r\ngrasped and which might lead us through the tangle. Cheer up, Watson,\r\nfor I am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand. When\r\nit does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us.”\r\n\r\nLittle did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realised, or\r\nhow strange and sinister would be that new development which opened up\r\nan entirely fresh line of investigation. I was shaving at my window in\r\nthe morning when I heard the rattle of hoofs and, looking up, saw a\r\ndog-cart coming at a gallop down the road. It pulled up at our door,\r\nand our friend, the vicar, sprang from it and rushed up our garden\r\npath. Holmes was already dressed, and we hastened down to meet him.\r\n\r\nOur visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at last\r\nin gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him.\r\n\r\n“We are devil-ridden, Mr. Holmes! My poor parish is devil-ridden!” he\r\ncried. “Satan himself is loose in it! We are given over into his\r\nhands!” He danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object if it were\r\nnot for his ashy face and startled eyes. Finally he shot out his\r\nterrible news.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the\r\nsame symptoms as the rest of his family.”\r\n\r\nHolmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant.\r\n\r\n“Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I can.”\r\n\r\n“Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast. Mr. Roundhay, we are\r\nentirely at your disposal. Hurry—hurry, before things get disarranged.”\r\n\r\nThe lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle\r\nby themselves, the one above the other. Below was a large sitting-room;\r\nabove, his bedroom. They looked out upon a croquet lawn which came up\r\nto the windows. We had arrived before the doctor or the police, so that\r\neverything was absolutely undisturbed. Let me describe exactly the\r\nscene as we saw it upon that misty March morning. It has left an\r\nimpression which can never be effaced from my mind.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing stuffiness.\r\nThe servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would\r\nhave been even more intolerable. This might partly be due to the fact\r\nthat a lamp stood flaring and smoking on the centre table. Beside it\r\nsat the dead man, leaning back in his chair, his thin beard projecting,\r\nhis spectacles pushed up on to his forehead, and his lean dark face\r\nturned towards the window and twisted into the same distortion of\r\nterror which had marked the features of his dead sister. His limbs were\r\nconvulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a very\r\nparoxysm of fear. He was fully clothed, though there were signs that\r\nhis dressing had been done in a hurry. We had already learned that his\r\nbed had been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him in the\r\nearly morning.\r\n\r\nOne realised the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes’s phlegmatic\r\nexterior when one saw the sudden change which came over him from the\r\nmoment that he entered the fatal apartment. In an instant he was tense\r\nand alert, his eyes shining, his face set, his limbs quivering with\r\neager activity. He was out on the lawn, in through the window, round\r\nthe room, and up into the bedroom, for all the world like a dashing\r\nfoxhound drawing a cover. In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around\r\nand ended by throwing open the window, which appeared to give him some\r\nfresh cause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud\r\nejaculations of interest and delight. Then he rushed down the stair,\r\nout through the open window, threw himself upon his face on the lawn,\r\nsprang up and into the room once more, all with the energy of the\r\nhunter who is at the very heels of his quarry. The lamp, which was an\r\nordinary standard, he examined with minute care, making certain\r\nmeasurements upon its bowl. He carefully scrutinised with his lens the\r\ntalc shield which covered the top of the chimney and scraped off some\r\nashes which adhered to its upper surface, putting some of them into an\r\nenvelope, which he placed in his pocketbook. Finally, just as the\r\ndoctor and the official police put in an appearance, he beckoned to the\r\nvicar and we all three went out upon the lawn.\r\n\r\n“I am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely barren,”\r\nhe remarked. “I cannot remain to discuss the matter with the police,\r\nbut I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if you would give\r\nthe inspector my compliments and direct his attention to the bedroom\r\nwindow and to the sitting-room lamp. Each is suggestive, and together\r\nthey are almost conclusive. If the police would desire further\r\ninformation I shall be happy to see any of them at the cottage. And\r\nnow, Watson, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better employed\r\nelsewhere.”\r\n\r\nIt may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur, or that\r\nthey imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of investigation;\r\nbut it is certain that we heard nothing from them for the next two\r\ndays. During this time Holmes spent some of his time smoking and\r\ndreaming in the cottage; but a greater portion in country walks which\r\nhe undertook alone, returning after many hours without remark as to\r\nwhere he had been. One experiment served to show me the line of his\r\ninvestigation. He had bought a lamp which was the duplicate of the one\r\nwhich had burned in the room of Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of\r\nthe tragedy. This he filled with the same oil as that used at the\r\nvicarage, and he carefully timed the period which it would take to be\r\nexhausted. Another experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant\r\nnature, and one which I am not likely ever to forget.\r\n\r\n“You will remember, Watson,” he remarked one afternoon, “that there is\r\na single common point of resemblance in the varying reports which have\r\nreached us. This concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the room in\r\neach case upon those who had first entered it. You will recollect that\r\nMortimer Tregennis, in describing the episode of his last visit to his\r\nbrother’s house, remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell\r\ninto a chair? You had forgotten? Well I can answer for it that it was\r\nso. Now, you will remember also that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told\r\nus that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards\r\nopened the window. In the second case—that of Mortimer Tregennis\r\nhimself—you cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the room\r\nwhen we arrived, though the servant had thrown open the window. That\r\nservant, I found upon inquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her bed.\r\nYou will admit, Watson, that these facts are very suggestive. In each\r\ncase there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere. In each case, also,\r\nthere is combustion going on in the room—in the one case a fire, in the\r\nother a lamp. The fire was needed, but the lamp was lit—as a comparison\r\nof the oil consumed will show—long after it was broad daylight. Why?\r\nSurely because there is some connection between three things—the\r\nburning, the stuffy atmosphere, and, finally, the madness or death of\r\nthose unfortunate people. That is clear, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“It would appear so.”\r\n\r\n“At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis. We will suppose,\r\nthen, that something was burned in each case which produced an\r\natmosphere causing strange toxic effects. Very good. In the first\r\ninstance—that of the Tregennis family—this substance was placed in the\r\nfire. Now the window was shut, but the fire would naturally carry fumes\r\nto some extent up the chimney. Hence one would expect the effects of\r\nthe poison to be less than in the second case, where there was less\r\nescape for the vapour. The result seems to indicate that it was so,\r\nsince in the first case only the woman, who had presumably the more\r\nsensitive organism, was killed, the others exhibiting that temporary or\r\npermanent lunacy which is evidently the first effect of the drug. In\r\nthe second case the result was complete. The facts, therefore, seem to\r\nbear out the theory of a poison which worked by combustion.\r\n\r\n“With this train of reasoning in my head I naturally looked about in\r\nMortimer Tregennis’s room to find some remains of this substance. The\r\nobvious place to look was the talc shelf or smoke-guard of the lamp.\r\nThere, sure enough, I perceived a number of flaky ashes, and round the\r\nedges a fringe of brownish powder, which had not yet been consumed.\r\nHalf of this I took, as you saw, and I placed it in an envelope.”\r\n\r\n“Why half, Holmes?”\r\n\r\n“It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official\r\npolice force. I leave them all the evidence which I found. The poison\r\nstill remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it. Now, Watson,\r\nwe will light our lamp; we will, however, take the precaution to open\r\nour window to avoid the premature decease of two deserving members of\r\nsociety, and you will seat yourself near that open window in an\r\narmchair unless, like a sensible man, you determine to have nothing to\r\ndo with the affair. Oh, you will see it out, will you? I thought I knew\r\nmy Watson. This chair I will place opposite yours, so that we may be\r\nthe same distance from the poison and face to face. The door we will\r\nleave ajar. Each is now in a position to watch the other and to bring\r\nthe experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming. Is that all\r\nclear? Well, then, I take our powder—or what remains of it—from the\r\nenvelope, and I lay it above the burning lamp. So! Now, Watson, let us\r\nsit down and await developments.”\r\n\r\nThey were not long in coming. I had hardly settled in my chair before I\r\nwas conscious of a thick, musky odour, subtle and nauseous. At the very\r\nfirst whiff of it my brain and my imagination were beyond all control.\r\nA thick, black cloud swirled before my eyes, and my mind told me that\r\nin this cloud, unseen as yet, but about to spring out upon my appalled\r\nsenses, lurked all that was vaguely horrible, all that was monstrous\r\nand inconceivably wicked in the universe. Vague shapes swirled and swam\r\namid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace and a warning of something\r\ncoming, the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the threshold,\r\nwhose very shadow would blast my soul. A freezing horror took\r\npossession of me. I felt that my hair was rising, that my eyes were\r\nprotruding, that my mouth was opened, and my tongue like leather. The\r\nturmoil within my brain was such that something must surely snap. I\r\ntried to scream and was vaguely aware of some hoarse croak which was my\r\nown voice, but distant and detached from myself. At the same moment, in\r\nsome effort of escape, I broke through that cloud of despair and had a\r\nglimpse of Holmes’s face, white, rigid, and drawn with horror—the very\r\nlook which I had seen upon the features of the dead. It was that vision\r\nwhich gave me an instant of sanity and of strength. I dashed from my\r\nchair, threw my arms round Holmes, and together we lurched through the\r\ndoor, and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves down upon the\r\ngrass plot and were lying side by side, conscious only of the glorious\r\nsunshine which was bursting its way through the hellish cloud of terror\r\nwhich had girt us in. Slowly it rose from our souls like the mists from\r\na landscape until peace and reason had returned, and we were sitting\r\nupon the grass, wiping our clammy foreheads, and looking with\r\napprehension at each other to mark the last traces of that terrific\r\nexperience which we had undergone.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, Watson!” said Holmes at last with an unsteady voice, “I\r\nowe you both my thanks and an apology. It was an unjustifiable\r\nexperiment even for one’s self, and doubly so for a friend. I am really\r\nvery sorry.”\r\n\r\n“You know,” I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen so much\r\nof Holmes’s heart before, “that it is my greatest joy and privilege to\r\nhelp you.”\r\n\r\nHe relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein which was\r\nhis habitual attitude to those about him. “It would be superfluous to\r\ndrive us mad, my dear Watson,” said he. “A candid observer would\r\ncertainly declare that we were so already before we embarked upon so\r\nwild an experiment. I confess that I never imagined that the effect\r\ncould be so sudden and so severe.” He dashed into the cottage, and,\r\nreappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm’s length, he threw\r\nit among a bank of brambles. “We must give the room a little time to\r\nclear. I take it, Watson, that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt\r\nas to how these tragedies were produced?”\r\n\r\n“None whatever.”\r\n\r\n“But the cause remains as obscure as before. Come into the arbour here\r\nand let us discuss it together. That villainous stuff seems still to\r\nlinger round my throat. I think we must admit that all the evidence\r\npoints to this man, Mortimer Tregennis, having been the criminal in the\r\nfirst tragedy, though he was the victim in the second one. We must\r\nremember, in the first place, that there is some story of a family\r\nquarrel, followed by a reconciliation. How bitter that quarrel may have\r\nbeen, or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell. When I think of\r\nMortimer Tregennis, with the foxy face and the small shrewd, beady eyes\r\nbehind the spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge to be of a\r\nparticularly forgiving disposition. Well, in the next place, you will\r\nremember that this idea of someone moving in the garden, which took our\r\nattention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy, emanated\r\nfrom him. He had a motive in misleading us. Finally, if he did not\r\nthrow the substance into the fire at the moment of leaving the room,\r\nwho did do so? The affair happened immediately after his departure. Had\r\nanyone else come in, the family would certainly have risen from the\r\ntable. Besides, in peaceful Cornwall, visitors did not arrive after ten\r\no’clock at night. We may take it, then, that all the evidence points to\r\nMortimer Tregennis as the culprit.”\r\n\r\n“Then his own death was suicide!”\r\n\r\n“Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition.\r\nThe man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate\r\nupon his own family might well be driven by remorse to inflict it upon\r\nhimself. There are, however, some cogent reasons against it.\r\nFortunately, there is one man in England who knows all about it, and I\r\nhave made arrangements by which we shall hear the facts this afternoon\r\nfrom his own lips. Ah! he is a little before his time. Perhaps you\r\nwould kindly step this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been conducting\r\na chemical experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly fit\r\nfor the reception of so distinguished a visitor.”\r\n\r\nI had heard the click of the garden gate, and now the majestic figure\r\nof the great African explorer appeared upon the path. He turned in some\r\nsurprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat.\r\n\r\n“You sent for me, Mr. Holmes. I had your note about an hour ago, and I\r\nhave come, though I really do not know why I should obey your summons.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate,” said Holmes.\r\n“Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence.\r\nYou will excuse this informal reception in the open air, but my friend\r\nWatson and I have nearly furnished an additional chapter to what the\r\npapers call the Cornish Horror, and we prefer a clear atmosphere for\r\nthe present. Perhaps, since the matters which we have to discuss will\r\naffect you personally in a very intimate fashion, it is as well that we\r\nshould talk where there can be no eavesdropping.”\r\n\r\nThe explorer took his cigar from his lips and gazed sternly at my\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n“I am at a loss to know, sir,” he said, “what you can have to speak\r\nabout which affects me personally in a very intimate fashion.”\r\n\r\n“The killing of Mortimer Tregennis,” said Holmes.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I wished that I were armed. Sterndale’s fierce face turned\r\nto a dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted, passionate veins\r\nstarted out in his forehead, while he sprang forward with clenched\r\nhands towards my companion. Then he stopped, and with a violent effort\r\nhe resumed a cold, rigid calmness, which was, perhaps, more suggestive\r\nof danger than his hot-headed outburst.\r\n\r\n“I have lived so long among savages and beyond the law,” said he, “that\r\nI have got into the way of being a law to myself. You would do well,\r\nMr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do you an\r\ninjury.”\r\n\r\n“Nor have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr. Sterndale. Surely the\r\nclearest proof of it is that, knowing what I know, I have sent for you\r\nand not for the police.”\r\n\r\nSterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for, perhaps, the first time\r\nin his adventurous life. There was a calm assurance of power in\r\nHolmes’s manner which could not be withstood. Our visitor stammered for\r\na moment, his great hands opening and shutting in his agitation.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” he asked at last. “If this is bluff upon your part,\r\nMr. Holmes, you have chosen a bad man for your experiment. Let us have\r\nno more beating about the bush. What _do_ you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you,” said Holmes, “and the reason why I tell you is that\r\nI hope frankness may beget frankness. What my next step may be will\r\ndepend entirely upon the nature of your own defence.”\r\n\r\n“My defence?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“My defence against what?”\r\n\r\n“Against the charge of killing Mortimer Tregennis.”\r\n\r\nSterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief. “Upon my word, you\r\nare getting on,” said he. “Do all your successes depend upon this\r\nprodigious power of bluff?”\r\n\r\n“The bluff,” said Holmes sternly, “is upon your side, Dr. Leon\r\nSterndale, and not upon mine. As a proof I will tell you some of the\r\nfacts upon which my conclusions are based. Of your return from\r\nPlymouth, allowing much of your property to go on to Africa, I will say\r\nnothing save that it first informed me that you were one of the factors\r\nwhich had to be taken into account in reconstructing this drama—”\r\n\r\n“I came back—”\r\n\r\n“I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and\r\ninadequate. We will pass that. You came down here to ask me whom I\r\nsuspected. I refused to answer you. You then went to the vicarage,\r\nwaited outside it for some time, and finally returned to your cottage.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know that?”\r\n\r\n“I followed you.”\r\n\r\n“I saw no one.”\r\n\r\n“That is what you may expect to see when I follow you. You spent a\r\nrestless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans, which in\r\nthe early morning you proceeded to put into execution. Leaving your\r\ndoor just as day was breaking, you filled your pocket with some reddish\r\ngravel that was lying heaped beside your gate.”\r\n\r\nSterndale gave a violent start and looked at Holmes in amazement.\r\n\r\n“You then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the\r\nvicarage. You were wearing, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed\r\ntennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your feet. At the\r\nvicarage you passed through the orchard and the side hedge, coming out\r\nunder the window of the lodger Tregennis. It was now daylight, but the\r\nhousehold was not yet stirring. You drew some of the gravel from your\r\npocket, and you threw it up at the window above you.”\r\n\r\nSterndale sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n“I believe that you are the devil himself!” he cried.\r\n\r\nHolmes smiled at the compliment. “It took two, or possibly three,\r\nhandfuls before the lodger came to the window. You beckoned him to come\r\ndown. He dressed hurriedly and descended to his sitting-room. You\r\nentered by the window. There was an interview—a short one—during which\r\nyou walked up and down the room. Then you passed out and closed the\r\nwindow, standing on the lawn outside smoking a cigar and watching what\r\noccurred. Finally, after the death of Tregennis, you withdrew as you\r\nhad come. Now, Dr. Sterndale, how do you justify such conduct, and what\r\nwere the motives for your actions? If you prevaricate or trifle with\r\nme, I give you my assurance that the matter will pass out of my hands\r\nforever.”\r\n\r\nOur visitor’s face had turned ashen grey as he listened to the words of\r\nhis accuser. Now he sat for some time in thought with his face sunk in\r\nhis hands. Then with a sudden impulsive gesture he plucked a photograph\r\nfrom his breast-pocket and threw it on the rustic table before us.\r\n\r\n“That is why I have done it,” said he.\r\n\r\nIt showed the bust and face of a very beautiful woman. Holmes stooped\r\nover it.\r\n\r\n“Brenda Tregennis,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Brenda Tregennis,” repeated our visitor. “For years I have loved\r\nher. For years she has loved me. There is the secret of that Cornish\r\nseclusion which people have marvelled at. It has brought me close to\r\nthe one thing on earth that was dear to me. I could not marry her, for\r\nI have a wife who has left me for years and yet whom, by the deplorable\r\nlaws of England, I could not divorce. For years Brenda waited. For\r\nyears I waited. And this is what we have waited for.” A terrible sob\r\nshook his great frame, and he clutched his throat under his brindled\r\nbeard. Then with an effort he mastered himself and spoke on:\r\n\r\n“The vicar knew. He was in our confidence. He would tell you that she\r\nwas an angel upon earth. That was why he telegraphed to me and I\r\nreturned. What was my baggage or Africa to me when I learned that such\r\na fate had come upon my darling? There you have the missing clue to my\r\naction, Mr. Holmes.”\r\n\r\n“Proceed,” said my friend.\r\n\r\nDr. Sterndale drew from his pocket a paper packet and laid it upon the\r\ntable. On the outside was written “_Radix pedis diaboli_” with a red\r\npoison label beneath it. He pushed it towards me. “I understand that\r\nyou are a doctor, sir. Have you ever heard of this preparation?”\r\n\r\n“Devil’s-foot root! No, I have never heard of it.”\r\n\r\n“It is no reflection upon your professional knowledge,” said he, “for I\r\nbelieve that, save for one sample in a laboratory at Buda, there is no\r\nother specimen in Europe. It has not yet found its way either into the\r\npharmacopœia or into the literature of toxicology. The root is shaped\r\nlike a foot, half human, half goatlike; hence the fanciful name given\r\nby a botanical missionary. It is used as an ordeal poison by the\r\nmedicine-men in certain districts of West Africa and is kept as a\r\nsecret among them. This particular specimen I obtained under very\r\nextraordinary circumstances in the Ubangi country.” He opened the paper\r\nas he spoke and disclosed a heap of reddish-brown, snuff-like powder.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir?” asked Holmes sternly.\r\n\r\n“I am about to tell you, Mr. Holmes, all that actually occurred, for\r\nyou already know so much that it is clearly to my interest that you\r\nshould know all. I have already explained the relationship in which I\r\nstood to the Tregennis family. For the sake of the sister I was\r\nfriendly with the brothers. There was a family quarrel about money\r\nwhich estranged this man Mortimer, but it was supposed to be made up,\r\nand I afterwards met him as I did the others. He was a sly, subtle,\r\nscheming man, and several things arose which gave me a suspicion of\r\nhim, but I had no cause for any positive quarrel.\r\n\r\n“One day, only a couple of weeks ago, he came down to my cottage and I\r\nshowed him some of my African curiosities. Among other things I\r\nexhibited this powder, and I told him of its strange properties, how it\r\nstimulates those brain centres which control the emotion of fear, and\r\nhow either madness or death is the fate of the unhappy native who is\r\nsubjected to the ordeal by the priest of his tribe. I told him also how\r\npowerless European science would be to detect it. How he took it I\r\ncannot say, for I never left the room, but there is no doubt that it\r\nwas then, while I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes, that he\r\nmanaged to abstract some of the devil’s-foot root. I well remember how\r\nhe plied me with questions as to the amount and the time that was\r\nneeded for its effect, but I little dreamed that he could have a\r\npersonal reason for asking.\r\n\r\n“I thought no more of the matter until the vicar’s telegram reached me\r\nat Plymouth. This villain had thought that I would be at sea before the\r\nnews could reach me, and that I should be lost for years in Africa. But\r\nI returned at once. Of course, I could not listen to the details\r\nwithout feeling assured that my poison had been used. I came round to\r\nsee you on the chance that some other explanation had suggested itself\r\nto you. But there could be none. I was convinced that Mortimer\r\nTregennis was the murderer; that for the sake of money, and with the\r\nidea, perhaps, that if the other members of his family were all insane\r\nhe would be the sole guardian of their joint property, he had used the\r\ndevil’s-foot powder upon them, driven two of them out of their senses,\r\nand killed his sister Brenda, the one human being whom I have ever\r\nloved or who has ever loved me. There was his crime; what was to be his\r\npunishment?\r\n\r\n“Should I appeal to the law? Where were my proofs? I knew that the\r\nfacts were true, but could I help to make a jury of countrymen believe\r\nso fantastic a story? I might or I might not. But I could not afford to\r\nfail. My soul cried out for revenge. I have said to you once before,\r\nMr. Holmes, that I have spent much of my life outside the law, and that\r\nI have come at last to be a law to myself. So it was even now. I\r\ndetermined that the fate which he had given to others should be shared\r\nby himself. Either that or I would do justice upon him with my own\r\nhand. In all England there can be no man who sets less value upon his\r\nown life than I do at the present moment.\r\n\r\n“Now I have told you all. You have yourself supplied the rest. I did,\r\nas you say, after a restless night, set off early from my cottage. I\r\nforesaw the difficulty of arousing him, so I gathered some gravel from\r\nthe pile which you have mentioned, and I used it to throw up to his\r\nwindow. He came down and admitted me through the window of the\r\nsitting-room. I laid his offence before him. I told him that I had come\r\nboth as judge and executioner. The wretch sank into a chair, paralysed\r\nat the sight of my revolver. I lit the lamp, put the powder above it,\r\nand stood outside the window, ready to carry out my threat to shoot him\r\nshould he try to leave the room. In five minutes he died. My God! how\r\nhe died! But my heart was flint, for he endured nothing which my\r\ninnocent darling had not felt before him. There is my story, Mr.\r\nHolmes. Perhaps, if you loved a woman, you would have done as much\r\nyourself. At any rate, I am in your hands. You can take what steps you\r\nlike. As I have already said, there is no man living who can fear death\r\nless than I do.”\r\n\r\nHolmes sat for some little time in silence.\r\n\r\n“What were your plans?” he asked at last.\r\n\r\n“I had intended to bury myself in central Africa. My work there is but\r\nhalf finished.”\r\n\r\n“Go and do the other half,” said Holmes. “I, at least, am not prepared\r\nto prevent you.”\r\n\r\nDr. Sterndale raised his giant figure, bowed gravely, and walked from\r\nthe arbour. Holmes lit his pipe and handed me his pouch.\r\n\r\n“Some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change,” said\r\nhe. “I think you must agree, Watson, that it is not a case in which we\r\nare called upon to interfere. Our investigation has been independent,\r\nand our action shall be so also. You would not denounce the man?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“I have never loved, Watson, but if I did and if the woman I loved had\r\nmet such an end, I might act even as our lawless lion-hunter has done.\r\nWho knows? Well, Watson, I will not offend your intelligence by\r\nexplaining what is obvious. The gravel upon the window-sill was, of\r\ncourse, the starting-point of my research. It was unlike anything in\r\nthe vicarage garden. Only when my attention had been drawn to Dr.\r\nSterndale and his cottage did I find its counterpart. The lamp shining\r\nin broad daylight and the remains of powder upon the shield were\r\nsuccessive links in a fairly obvious chain. And now, my dear Watson, I\r\nthink we may dismiss the matter from our mind and go back with a clear\r\nconscience to the study of those Chaldean roots which are surely to be\r\ntraced in the Cornish branch of the great Celtic speech.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adventure of the Red Circle\r\n\r\n\r\n PART I\r\n\r\n“Well, Mrs. Warren, I cannot see that you have any particular cause for\r\nuneasiness, nor do I understand why I, whose time is of some value,\r\nshould interfere in the matter. I really have other things to engage\r\nme.” So spoke Sherlock Holmes and turned back to the great scrapbook in\r\nwhich he was arranging and indexing some of his recent material.\r\n\r\nBut the landlady had the pertinacity and also the cunning of her sex.\r\nShe held her ground firmly.\r\n\r\n“You arranged an affair for a lodger of mine last year,” she said—“Mr.\r\nFairdale Hobbs.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes—a simple matter.”\r\n\r\n“But he would never cease talking of it—your kindness, sir, and the way\r\nin which you brought light into the darkness. I remembered his words\r\nwhen I was in doubt and darkness myself. I know you could if you only\r\nwould.”\r\n\r\nHolmes was accessible upon the side of flattery, and also, to do him\r\njustice, upon the side of kindliness. The two forces made him lay down\r\nhis gum-brush with a sigh of resignation and push back his chair.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, Mrs. Warren, let us hear about it, then. You don’t object\r\nto tobacco, I take it? Thank you, Watson—the matches! You are uneasy,\r\nas I understand, because your new lodger remains in his rooms and you\r\ncannot see him. Why, bless you, Mrs. Warren, if I were your lodger you\r\noften would not see me for weeks on end.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt, sir; but this is different. It frightens me, Mr. Holmes. I\r\ncan’t sleep for fright. To hear his quick step moving here and moving\r\nthere from early morning to late at night, and yet never to catch so\r\nmuch as a glimpse of him—it’s more than I can stand. My husband is as\r\nnervous over it as I am, but he is out at his work all day, while I get\r\nno rest from it. What is he hiding for? What has he done? Except for\r\nthe girl, I am all alone in the house with him, and it’s more than my\r\nnerves can stand.”\r\n\r\nHolmes leaned forward and laid his long, thin fingers upon the woman’s\r\nshoulder. He had an almost hypnotic power of soothing when he wished.\r\nThe scared look faded from her eyes, and her agitated features smoothed\r\ninto their usual commonplace. She sat down in the chair which he had\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\n“If I take it up I must understand every detail,” said he. “Take time\r\nto consider. The smallest point may be the most essential. You say that\r\nthe man came ten days ago and paid you for a fortnight’s board and\r\nlodging?”\r\n\r\n“He asked my terms, sir. I said fifty shillings a week. There is a\r\nsmall sitting-room and bedroom, and all complete, at the top of the\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“He said, ‘I’ll pay you five pounds a week if I can have it on my own\r\nterms.’ I’m a poor woman, sir, and Mr. Warren earns little, and the\r\nmoney meant much to me. He took out a ten-pound note, and he held it\r\nout to me then and there. ‘You can have the same every fortnight for a\r\nlong time to come if you keep the terms,’ he said. ‘If not, I’ll have\r\nno more to do with you.’\r\n\r\n“What were the terms?”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, they were that he was to have a key of the house. That was\r\nall right. Lodgers often have them. Also, that he was to be left\r\nentirely to himself and never, upon any excuse, to be disturbed.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing wonderful in that, surely?”\r\n\r\n“Not in reason, sir. But this is out of all reason. He has been there\r\nfor ten days, and neither Mr. Warren, nor I, nor the girl has once set\r\neyes upon him. We can hear that quick step of his pacing up and down,\r\nup and down, night, morning, and noon; but except on that first night\r\nhe had never once gone out of the house.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he went out the first night, did he?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, and returned very late—after we were all in bed. He told me\r\nafter he had taken the rooms that he would do so and asked me not to\r\nbar the door. I heard him come up the stair after midnight.”\r\n\r\n“But his meals?”\r\n\r\n“It was his particular direction that we should always, when he rang,\r\nleave his meal upon a chair, outside his door. Then he rings again when\r\nhe has finished, and we take it down from the same chair. If he wants\r\nanything else he prints it on a slip of paper and leaves it.”\r\n\r\n“Prints it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; prints it in pencil. Just the word, nothing more. Here’s the\r\none I brought to show you—SOAP. Here’s another—MATCH. This is one he\r\nleft the first morning—DAILY GAZETTE. I leave that paper with his\r\nbreakfast every morning.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me, Watson,” said Homes, staring with great curiosity at the\r\nslips of foolscap which the landlady had handed to him, “this is\r\ncertainly a little unusual. Seclusion I can understand; but why print?\r\nPrinting is a clumsy process. Why not write? What would it suggest,\r\nWatson?”\r\n\r\n“That he desired to conceal his handwriting.”\r\n\r\n“But why? What can it matter to him that his landlady should have a\r\nword of his writing? Still, it may be as you say. Then, again, why such\r\nlaconic messages?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot imagine.”\r\n\r\n“It opens a pleasing field for intelligent speculation. The words are\r\nwritten with a broad-pointed, violet-tinted pencil of a not unusual\r\npattern. You will observe that the paper is torn away at the side here\r\nafter the printing was done, so that the ‘S’ of ‘SOAP’ is partly gone.\r\nSuggestive, Watson, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Of caution?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. There was evidently some mark, some thumbprint, something\r\nwhich might give a clue to the person’s identity. Now, Mrs. Warren, you\r\nsay that the man was of middle size, dark, and bearded. What age would\r\nhe be?”\r\n\r\n“Youngish, sir—not over thirty.”\r\n\r\n“Well, can you give me no further indications?”\r\n\r\n“He spoke good English, sir, and yet I thought he was a foreigner by\r\nhis accent.”\r\n\r\n“And he was well dressed?”\r\n\r\n“Very smartly dressed, sir—quite the gentleman. Dark clothes—nothing\r\nyou would note.”\r\n\r\n“He gave no name?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And has had no letters or callers?”\r\n\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\n“But surely you or the girl enter his room of a morning?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; he looks after himself entirely.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me! that is certainly remarkable. What about his luggage?”\r\n\r\n“He had one big brown bag with him—nothing else.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we don’t seem to have much material to help us. Do you say\r\nnothing has come out of that room—absolutely nothing?”\r\n\r\nThe landlady drew an envelope from her bag; from it she shook out two\r\nburnt matches and a cigarette-end upon the table.\r\n\r\n“They were on his tray this morning. I brought them because I had heard\r\nthat you can read great things out of small ones.”\r\n\r\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“There is nothing here,” said he. “The matches have, of course, been\r\nused to light cigarettes. That is obvious from the shortness of the\r\nburnt end. Half the match is consumed in lighting a pipe or cigar. But,\r\ndear me! this cigarette stub is certainly remarkable. The gentleman was\r\nbearded and moustached, you say?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand that. I should say that only a clean-shaven man\r\ncould have smoked this. Why, Watson, even your modest moustache would\r\nhave been singed.”\r\n\r\n“A holder?” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“No, no; the end is matted. I suppose there could not be two people in\r\nyour rooms, Mrs. Warren?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir. He eats so little that I often wonder it can keep life in\r\none.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I think we must wait for a little more material. After all, you\r\nhave nothing to complain of. You have received your rent, and he is not\r\na troublesome lodger, though he is certainly an unusual one. He pays\r\nyou well, and if he chooses to lie concealed it is no direct business\r\nof yours. We have no excuse for an intrusion upon his privacy until we\r\nhave some reason to think that there is a guilty reason for it. I’ve\r\ntaken up the matter, and I won’t lose sight of it. Report to me if\r\nanything fresh occurs, and rely upon my assistance if it should be\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n“There are certainly some points of interest in this case, Watson,” he\r\nremarked when the landlady had left us. “It may, of course, be\r\ntrivial—individual eccentricity; or it may be very much deeper than\r\nappears on the surface. The first thing that strikes one is the obvious\r\npossibility that the person now in the rooms may be entirely different\r\nfrom the one who engaged them.”\r\n\r\n“Why should you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Well, apart from this cigarette-end, was it not suggestive that the\r\nonly time the lodger went out was immediately after his taking the\r\nrooms? He came back—or someone came back—when all witnesses were out of\r\nthe way. We have no proof that the person who came back was the person\r\nwho went out. Then, again, the man who took the rooms spoke English\r\nwell. This other, however, prints ‘match’ when it should have been\r\n‘matches.’ I can imagine that the word was taken out of a dictionary,\r\nwhich would give the noun but not the plural. The laconic style may be\r\nto conceal the absence of knowledge of English. Yes, Watson, there are\r\ngood reasons to suspect that there has been a substitution of lodgers.”\r\n\r\n“But for what possible end?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! there lies our problem. There is one rather obvious line of\r\ninvestigation.” He took down the great book in which, day by day, he\r\nfiled the agony columns of the various London journals. “Dear me!” said\r\nhe, turning over the pages, “what a chorus of groans, cries, and\r\nbleatings! What a rag-bag of singular happenings! But surely the most\r\nvaluable hunting-ground that ever was given to a student of the\r\nunusual! This person is alone and cannot be approached by letter\r\nwithout a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired. How is any\r\nnews or any message to reach him from without? Obviously by\r\nadvertisement through a newspaper. There seems no other way, and\r\nfortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only. Here are\r\nthe _Daily Gazette_ extracts of the last fortnight. ‘Lady with a black\r\nboa at Prince’s Skating Club’—that we may pass. ‘Surely Jimmy will not\r\nbreak his mother’s heart’—that appears to be irrelevant. ‘If the lady\r\nwho fainted on Brixton bus’—she does not interest me. ‘Every day my\r\nheart longs—’ Bleat, Watson—unmitigated bleat! Ah, this is a little\r\nmore possible. Listen to this: ‘Be patient. Will find some sure means\r\nof communications. Meanwhile, this column. G.’ That is two days after\r\nMrs. Warren’s lodger arrived. It sounds plausible, does it not? The\r\nmysterious one could understand English, even if he could not print it.\r\nLet us see if we can pick up the trace again. Yes, here we are—three\r\ndays later. ‘Am making successful arrangements. Patience and prudence.\r\nThe clouds will pass. G.’ Nothing for a week after that. Then comes\r\nsomething much more definite: ‘The path is clearing. If I find chance\r\nsignal message remember code agreed—One A, two B, and so on. You will\r\nhear soon. G.’ That was in yesterday’s paper, and there is nothing in\r\nto-day’s. It’s all very appropriate to Mrs. Warren’s lodger. If we wait\r\na little, Watson, I don’t doubt that the affair will grow more\r\nintelligible.”\r\n\r\nSo it proved; for in the morning I found my friend standing on the\r\nhearthrug with his back to the fire and a smile of complete\r\nsatisfaction upon his face.\r\n\r\n“How’s this, Watson?” he cried, picking up the paper from the table.\r\n“‘High red house with white stone facings. Third floor. Second window\r\nleft. After dusk. G.’ That is definite enough. I think after breakfast\r\nwe must make a little reconnaissance of Mrs. Warren’s neighbourhood.\r\nAh, Mrs. Warren! what news do you bring us this morning?”\r\n\r\nOur client had suddenly burst into the room with an explosive energy\r\nwhich told of some new and momentous development.\r\n\r\n“It’s a police matter, Mr. Holmes!” she cried. “I’ll have no more of\r\nit! He shall pack out of there with his baggage. I would have gone\r\nstraight up and told him so, only I thought it was but fair to you to\r\ntake your opinion first. But I’m at the end of my patience, and when it\r\ncomes to knocking my old man about—”\r\n\r\n“Knocking Mr. Warren about?”\r\n\r\n“Using him roughly, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“But who used him roughly?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that’s what we want to know! It was this morning, sir. Mr. Warren\r\nis a timekeeper at Morton and Waylight’s, in Tottenham Court Road. He\r\nhas to be out of the house before seven. Well, this morning he had not\r\ngone ten paces down the road when two men came up behind him, threw a\r\ncoat over his head, and bundled him into a cab that was beside the\r\ncurb. They drove him an hour, and then opened the door and shot him\r\nout. He lay in the roadway so shaken in his wits that he never saw what\r\nbecame of the cab. When he picked himself up he found he was on\r\nHampstead Heath; so he took a bus home, and there he lies now on his\r\nsofa, while I came straight round to tell you what had happened.”\r\n\r\n“Most interesting,” said Holmes. “Did he observe the appearance of\r\nthese men—did he hear them talk?”\r\n\r\n“No; he is clean dazed. He just knows that he was lifted up as if by\r\nmagic and dropped as if by magic. Two at least were in it, and maybe\r\nthree.”\r\n\r\n“And you connect this attack with your lodger?”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ve lived there fifteen years and no such happenings ever came\r\nbefore. I’ve had enough of him. Money’s not everything. I’ll have him\r\nout of my house before the day is done.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a bit, Mrs. Warren. Do nothing rash. I begin to think that this\r\naffair may be very much more important than appeared at first sight. It\r\nis clear now that some danger is threatening your lodger. It is equally\r\nclear that his enemies, lying in wait for him near your door, mistook\r\nyour husband for him in the foggy morning light. On discovering their\r\nmistake they released him. What they would have done had it not been a\r\nmistake, we can only conjecture.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what am I to do, Mr. Holmes?”\r\n\r\n“I have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours, Mrs. Warren.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see how that is to be managed, unless you break in the door. I\r\nalways hear him unlock it as I go down the stair after I leave the\r\ntray.”\r\n\r\n“He has to take the tray in. Surely we could conceal ourselves and see\r\nhim do it.”\r\n\r\nThe landlady thought for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, there’s the box-room opposite. I could arrange a\r\nlooking-glass, maybe, and if you were behind the door—”\r\n\r\n“Excellent!” said Holmes. “When does he lunch?”\r\n\r\n“About one, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Then Dr. Watson and I will come round in time. For the present, Mrs.\r\nWarren, good-bye.”\r\n\r\nAt half-past twelve we found ourselves upon the steps of Mrs. Warren’s\r\nhouse—a high, thin, yellow-brick edifice in Great Orme Street, a narrow\r\nthoroughfare at the northeast side of the British Museum. Standing as\r\nit does near the corner of the street, it commands a view down Howe\r\nStreet, with its more pretentious houses. Holmes pointed with a chuckle\r\nto one of these, a row of residential flats, which projected so that\r\nthey could not fail to catch the eye.\r\n\r\n“See, Watson!” said he. “‘High red house with stone facings.’ There is\r\nthe signal station all right. We know the place, and we know the code;\r\nso surely our task should be simple. There’s a ‘to let’ card in that\r\nwindow. It is evidently an empty flat to which the confederate has\r\naccess. Well, Mrs. Warren, what now?”\r\n\r\n“I have it all ready for you. If you will both come up and leave your\r\nboots below on the landing, I’ll put you there now.”\r\n\r\nIt was an excellent hiding-place which she had arranged. The mirror was\r\nso placed that, seated in the dark, we could very plainly see the door\r\nopposite. We had hardly settled down in it, and Mrs. Warren left us,\r\nwhen a distant tinkle announced that our mysterious neighbour had rung.\r\nPresently the landlady appeared with the tray, laid it down upon a\r\nchair beside the closed door, and then, treading heavily, departed.\r\nCrouching together in the angle of the door, we kept our eyes fixed\r\nupon the mirror. Suddenly, as the landlady’s footsteps died away, there\r\nwas the creak of a turning key, the handle revolved, and two thin hands\r\ndarted out and lifted the tray from the chair. An instant later it was\r\nhurriedly replaced, and I caught a glimpse of a dark, beautiful,\r\nhorrified face glaring at the narrow opening of the box-room. Then the\r\ndoor crashed to, the key turned once more, and all was silence. Holmes\r\ntwitched my sleeve, and together we stole down the stair.\r\n\r\n“I will call again in the evening,” said he to the expectant landlady.\r\n“I think, Watson, we can discuss this business better in our own\r\nquarters.”\r\n\r\n“My surmise, as you saw, proved to be correct,” said he, speaking from\r\nthe depths of his easy-chair. “There has been a substitution of\r\nlodgers. What I did not foresee is that we should find a woman, and no\r\nordinary woman, Watson.”\r\n\r\n“She saw us.”\r\n\r\n“Well, she saw something to alarm her. That is certain. The general\r\nsequence of events is pretty clear, is it not? A couple seek refuge in\r\nLondon from a very terrible and instant danger. The measure of that\r\ndanger is the rigour of their precautions. The man, who has some work\r\nwhich he must do, desires to leave the woman in absolute safety while\r\nhe does it. It is not an easy problem, but he solved it in an original\r\nfashion, and so effectively that her presence was not even known to the\r\nlandlady who supplies her with food. The printed messages, as is now\r\nevident, were to prevent her sex being discovered by her writing. The\r\nman cannot come near the woman, or he will guide their enemies to her.\r\nSince he cannot communicate with her direct, he has recourse to the\r\nagony column of a paper. So far all is clear.”\r\n\r\n“But what is at the root of it?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, Watson—severely practical, as usual! What is at the root of\r\nit all? Mrs. Warren’s whimsical problem enlarges somewhat and assumes a\r\nmore sinister aspect as we proceed. This much we can say: that it is no\r\nordinary love escapade. You saw the woman’s face at the sign of danger.\r\nWe have heard, too, of the attack upon the landlord, which was\r\nundoubtedly meant for the lodger. These alarms, and the desperate need\r\nfor secrecy, argue that the matter is one of life or death. The attack\r\nupon Mr. Warren further shows that the enemy, whoever they are, are\r\nthemselves not aware of the substitution of the female lodger for the\r\nmale. It is very curious and complex, Watson.”\r\n\r\n“Why should you go further in it? What have you to gain from it?”\r\n\r\n“What, indeed? It is art for art’s sake, Watson. I suppose when you\r\ndoctored you found yourself studying cases without thought of a fee?”\r\n\r\n“For my education, Holmes.”\r\n\r\n“Education never ends, Watson. It is a series of lessons with the\r\ngreatest for the last. This is an instructive case. There is neither\r\nmoney nor credit in it, and yet one would wish to tidy it up. When dusk\r\ncomes we should find ourselves one stage advanced in our\r\ninvestigation.”\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to Mrs. Warren’s rooms, the gloom of a London winter\r\nevening had thickened into one grey curtain, a dead monotone of colour,\r\nbroken only by the sharp yellow squares of the windows and the blurred\r\nhaloes of the gas-lamps. As we peered from the darkened sitting-room of\r\nthe lodging-house, one more dim light glimmered high up through the\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\n“Someone is moving in that room,” said Holmes in a whisper, his gaunt\r\nand eager face thrust forward to the window-pane. “Yes, I can see his\r\nshadow. There he is again! He has a candle in his hand. Now he is\r\npeering across. He wants to be sure that she is on the lookout. Now he\r\nbegins to flash. Take the message also, Watson, that we may check each\r\nother. A single flash—that is A, surely. Now, then. How many did you\r\nmake it? Twenty. So did I. That should mean T. AT—that’s intelligible\r\nenough. Another T. Surely this is the beginning of a second word. Now,\r\nthen—TENTA. Dead stop. That can’t be all, Watson? ATTENTA gives no\r\nsense. Nor is it any better as three words AT, TEN, TA, unless T. A.\r\nare a person’s initials. There it goes again! What’s that? ATTE—why, it\r\nis the same message over again. Curious, Watson, very curious. Now he\r\nis off once more! AT—why he is repeating it for the third time. ATTENTA\r\nthree times! How often will he repeat it? No, that seems to be the\r\nfinish. He has withdrawn from the window. What do you make of it,\r\nWatson?”\r\n\r\n“A cipher message, Holmes.”\r\n\r\nMy companion gave a sudden chuckle of comprehension. “And not a very\r\nobscure cipher, Watson,” said he. “Why, of course, it is Italian! The A\r\nmeans that it is addressed to a woman. ‘Beware! Beware! Beware!’ How’s\r\nthat, Watson?\r\n\r\n“I believe you have hit it.”\r\n\r\n“Not a doubt of it. It is a very urgent message, thrice repeated to\r\nmake it more so. But beware of what? Wait a bit, he is coming to the\r\nwindow once more.”\r\n\r\nAgain we saw the dim silhouette of a crouching man and the whisk of the\r\nsmall flame across the window as the signals were renewed. They came\r\nmore rapidly than before—so rapid that it was hard to follow them.\r\n\r\n“PERICOLO—pericolo—eh, what’s that, Watson? ‘Danger,’ isn’t it? Yes, by\r\nJove, it’s a danger signal. There he goes again! PERI. Halloa, what on\r\nearth—”\r\n\r\nThe light had suddenly gone out, the glimmering square of window had\r\ndisappeared, and the third floor formed a dark band round the lofty\r\nbuilding, with its tiers of shining casements. That last warning cry\r\nhad been suddenly cut short. How, and by whom? The same thought\r\noccurred on the instant to us both. Holmes sprang up from where he\r\ncrouched by the window.\r\n\r\n“This is serious, Watson,” he cried. “There is some devilry going\r\nforward! Why should such a message stop in such a way? I should put\r\nScotland Yard in touch with this business—and yet, it is too pressing\r\nfor us to leave.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I go for the police?”\r\n\r\n“We must define the situation a little more clearly. It may bear some\r\nmore innocent interpretation. Come, Watson, let us go across ourselves\r\nand see what we can make of it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n PART II\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we walked rapidly down Howe Street I glanced back at the building\r\nwhich we had left. There, dimly outlined at the top window, I could see\r\nthe shadow of a head, a woman’s head, gazing tensely, rigidly, out into\r\nthe night, waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal of that\r\ninterrupted message. At the doorway of the Howe Street flats a man,\r\nmuffled in a cravat and greatcoat, was leaning against the railing. He\r\nstarted as the hall-light fell upon our faces.\r\n\r\n“Holmes!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Why, Gregson!” said my companion as he shook hands with the Scotland\r\nYard detective. “Journeys end with lovers’ meetings. What brings you\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“The same reasons that bring you, I expect,” said Gregson. “How you got\r\non to it I can’t imagine.”\r\n\r\n“Different threads, but leading up to the same tangle. I’ve been taking\r\nthe signals.”\r\n\r\n“Signals?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, from that window. They broke off in the middle. We came over to\r\nsee the reason. But since it is safe in your hands I see no object in\r\ncontinuing this business.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a bit!” cried Gregson eagerly. “I’ll do you this justice, Mr.\r\nHolmes, that I was never in a case yet that I didn’t feel stronger for\r\nhaving you on my side. There’s only the one exit to these flats, so we\r\nhave him safe.”\r\n\r\n“Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, we score over you for once, Mr. Holmes. You must give us\r\nbest this time.” He struck his stick sharply upon the ground, on which\r\na cabman, his whip in his hand, sauntered over from a four-wheeler\r\nwhich stood on the far side of the street. “May I introduce you to Mr.\r\nSherlock Holmes?” he said to the cabman. “This is Mr. Leverton, of\r\nPinkerton’s American Agency.”\r\n\r\n“The hero of the Long Island cave mystery?” said Holmes. “Sir, I am\r\npleased to meet you.”\r\n\r\nThe American, a quiet, businesslike young man, with a clean-shaven,\r\nhatchet face, flushed up at the words of commendation. “I am on the\r\ntrail of my life now, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “If I can get Gorgiano—”\r\n\r\n“What! Gorgiano of the Red Circle?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he has a European fame, has he? Well, we’ve learned all about him\r\nin America. We _know_ he is at the bottom of fifty murders, and yet we\r\nhave nothing positive we can take him on. I tracked him over from New\r\nYork, and I’ve been close to him for a week in London, waiting some\r\nexcuse to get my hand on his collar. Mr. Gregson and I ran him to\r\nground in that big tenement house, and there’s only one door, so he\r\ncan’t slip us. There’s three folk come out since he went in, but I’ll\r\nswear he wasn’t one of them.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Holmes talks of signals,” said Gregson. “I expect, as usual, he\r\nknows a good deal that we don’t.”\r\n\r\nIn a few clear words Holmes explained the situation as it had appeared\r\nto us. The American struck his hands together with vexation.\r\n\r\n“He’s on to us!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Why do you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it figures out that way, does it not? Here he is, sending out\r\nmessages to an accomplice—there are several of his gang in London. Then\r\nsuddenly, just as by your own account he was telling them that there\r\nwas danger, he broke short off. What could it mean except that from the\r\nwindow he had suddenly either caught sight of us in the street, or in\r\nsome way come to understand how close the danger was, and that he must\r\nact right away if he was to avoid it? What do you suggest, Mr. Holmes?”\r\n\r\n“That we go up at once and see for ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“But we have no warrant for his arrest.”\r\n\r\n“He is in unoccupied premises under suspicious circumstances,” said\r\nGregson. “That is good enough for the moment. When we have him by the\r\nheels we can see if New York can’t help us to keep him. I’ll take the\r\nresponsibility of arresting him now.”\r\n\r\nOur official detectives may blunder in the matter of intelligence, but\r\nnever in that of courage. Gregson climbed the stair to arrest this\r\ndesperate murderer with the same absolutely quiet and businesslike\r\nbearing with which he would have ascended the official staircase of\r\nScotland Yard. The Pinkerton man had tried to push past him, but\r\nGregson had firmly elbowed him back. London dangers were the privilege\r\nof the London force.\r\n\r\nThe door of the left-hand flat upon the third landing was standing\r\najar. Gregson pushed it open. Within all was absolute silence and\r\ndarkness. I struck a match and lit the detective’s lantern. As I did\r\nso, and as the flicker steadied into a flame, we all gave a gasp of\r\nsurprise. On the deal boards of the carpetless floor there was outlined\r\na fresh track of blood. The red steps pointed towards us and led away\r\nfrom an inner room, the door of which was closed. Gregson flung it open\r\nand held his light full blaze in front of him, while we all peered\r\neagerly over his shoulders.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the floor of the empty room was huddled the figure of\r\nan enormous man, his clean-shaven, swarthy face grotesquely horrible in\r\nits contortion and his head encircled by a ghastly crimson halo of\r\nblood, lying in a broad wet circle upon the white woodwork. His knees\r\nwere drawn up, his hands thrown out in agony, and from the centre of\r\nhis broad, brown, upturned throat there projected the white haft of a\r\nknife driven blade-deep into his body. Giant as he was, the man must\r\nhave gone down like a pole-axed ox before that terrific blow. Beside\r\nhis right hand a most formidable horn-handled, two-edged dagger lay\r\nupon the floor, and near it a black kid glove.\r\n\r\n“By George! it’s Black Gorgiano himself!” cried the American detective.\r\n“Someone has got ahead of us this time.”\r\n\r\n“Here is the candle in the window, Mr. Holmes,” said Gregson. “Why,\r\nwhatever are you doing?”\r\n\r\nHolmes had stepped across, had lit the candle, and was passing it\r\nbackward and forward across the window-panes. Then he peered into the\r\ndarkness, blew the candle out, and threw it on the floor.\r\n\r\n“I rather think that will be helpful,” said he. He came over and stood\r\nin deep thought while the two professionals were examining the body.\r\n“You say that three people came out from the flat while you were\r\nwaiting downstairs,” said he at last. “Did you observe them closely?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did.”\r\n\r\n“Was there a fellow about thirty, black-bearded, dark, of middle size?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; he was the last to pass me.”\r\n\r\n“That is your man, I fancy. I can give you his description, and we have\r\na very excellent outline of his footmark. That should be enough for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Not much, Mr. Holmes, among the millions of London.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not. That is why I thought it best to summon this lady to your\r\naid.”\r\n\r\nWe all turned round at the words. There, framed in the doorway, was a\r\ntall and beautiful woman—the mysterious lodger of Bloomsbury. Slowly\r\nshe advanced, her face pale and drawn with a frightful apprehension,\r\nher eyes fixed and staring, her terrified gaze riveted upon the dark\r\nfigure on the floor.\r\n\r\n“You have killed him!” she muttered. “Oh, _Dio mio_, you have killed\r\nhim!” Then I heard a sudden sharp intake of her breath, and she sprang\r\ninto the air with a cry of joy. Round and round the room she danced,\r\nher hands clapping, her dark eyes gleaming with delighted wonder, and a\r\nthousand pretty Italian exclamations pouring from her lips. It was\r\nterrible and amazing to see such a woman so convulsed with joy at such\r\na sight. Suddenly she stopped and gazed at us all with a questioning\r\nstare.\r\n\r\n“But you! You are police, are you not? You have killed Giuseppe\r\nGorgiano. Is it not so?”\r\n\r\n“We are police, madam.”\r\n\r\nShe looked round into the shadows of the room.\r\n\r\n“But where, then, is Gennaro?” she asked. “He is my husband, Gennaro\r\nLucca. I am Emilia Lucca, and we are both from New York. Where is\r\nGennaro? He called me this moment from this window, and I ran with all\r\nmy speed.”\r\n\r\n“It was I who called,” said Holmes.\r\n\r\n“You! How could you call?”\r\n\r\n“Your cipher was not difficult, madam. Your presence here was\r\ndesirable. I knew that I had only to flash ‘_Vieni_’ and you would\r\nsurely come.”\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Italian looked with awe at my companion.\r\n\r\n“I do not understand how you know these things,” she said. “Giuseppe\r\nGorgiano—how did he—” She paused, and then suddenly her face lit up\r\nwith pride and delight. “Now I see it! My Gennaro! My splendid,\r\nbeautiful Gennaro, who has guarded me safe from all harm, he did it,\r\nwith his own strong hand he killed the monster! Oh, Gennaro, how\r\nwonderful you are! What woman could ever be worthy of such a man?”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mrs. Lucca,” said the prosaic Gregson, laying his hand upon the\r\nlady’s sleeve with as little sentiment as if she were a Notting Hill\r\nhooligan, “I am not very clear yet who you are or what you are; but\r\nyou’ve said enough to make it very clear that we shall want you at the\r\nYard.”\r\n\r\n“One moment, Gregson,” said Holmes. “I rather fancy that this lady may\r\nbe as anxious to give us information as we can be to get it. You\r\nunderstand, madam, that your husband will be arrested and tried for the\r\ndeath of the man who lies before us? What you say may be used in\r\nevidence. But if you think that he has acted from motives which are not\r\ncriminal, and which he would wish to have known, then you cannot serve\r\nhim better than by telling us the whole story.”\r\n\r\n“Now that Gorgiano is dead we fear nothing,” said the lady. “He was a\r\ndevil and a monster, and there can be no judge in the world who would\r\npunish my husband for having killed him.”\r\n\r\n“In that case,” said Holmes, “my suggestion is that we lock this door,\r\nleave things as we found them, go with this lady to her room, and form\r\nour opinion after we have heard what it is that she has to say to us.”\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later we were seated, all four, in the small sitting-room\r\nof Signora Lucca, listening to her remarkable narrative of those\r\nsinister events, the ending of which we had chanced to witness. She\r\nspoke in rapid and fluent but very unconventional English, which, for\r\nthe sake of clearness, I will make grammatical.\r\n\r\n“I was born in Posilippo, near Naples,” said she, “and was the daughter\r\nof Augusto Barelli, who was the chief lawyer and once the deputy of\r\nthat part. Gennaro was in my father’s employment, and I came to love\r\nhim, as any woman must. He had neither money nor position—nothing but\r\nhis beauty and strength and energy—so my father forbade the match. We\r\nfled together, were married at Bari, and sold my jewels to gain the\r\nmoney which would take us to America. This was four years ago, and we\r\nhave been in New York ever since.\r\n\r\n“Fortune was very good to us at first. Gennaro was able to do a service\r\nto an Italian gentleman—he saved him from some ruffians in the place\r\ncalled the Bowery, and so made a powerful friend. His name was Tito\r\nCastalotte, and he was the senior partner of the great firm of\r\nCastalotte and Zamba, who are the chief fruit importers of New York.\r\nSignor Zamba is an invalid, and our new friend Castalotte has all power\r\nwithin the firm, which employs more than three hundred men. He took my\r\nhusband into his employment, made him head of a department, and showed\r\nhis good-will towards him in every way. Signor Castalotte was a\r\nbachelor, and I believe that he felt as if Gennaro was his son, and\r\nboth my husband and I loved him as if he were our father. We had taken\r\nand furnished a little house in Brooklyn, and our whole future seemed\r\nassured when that black cloud appeared which was soon to overspread our\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n“One night, when Gennaro returned from his work, he brought a\r\nfellow-countryman back with him. His name was Gorgiano, and he had come\r\nalso from Posilippo. He was a huge man, as you can testify, for you\r\nhave looked upon his corpse. Not only was his body that of a giant but\r\neverything about him was grotesque, gigantic, and terrifying. His voice\r\nwas like thunder in our little house. There was scarce room for the\r\nwhirl of his great arms as he talked. His thoughts, his emotions, his\r\npassions, all were exaggerated and monstrous. He talked, or rather\r\nroared, with such energy that others could but sit and listen, cowed\r\nwith the mighty stream of words. His eyes blazed at you and held you at\r\nhis mercy. He was a terrible and wonderful man. I thank God that he is\r\ndead!\r\n\r\n“He came again and again. Yet I was aware that Gennaro was no more\r\nhappy than I was in his presence. My poor husband would sit pale and\r\nlistless, listening to the endless raving upon politics and upon social\r\nquestions which made up our visitor’s conversation. Gennaro said\r\nnothing, but I, who knew him so well, could read in his face some\r\nemotion which I had never seen there before. At first I thought that it\r\nwas dislike. And then, gradually, I understood that it was more than\r\ndislike. It was fear—a deep, secret, shrinking fear. That night—the\r\nnight that I read his terror—I put my arms round him and I implored him\r\nby his love for me and by all that he held dear to hold nothing from\r\nme, and to tell me why this huge man overshadowed him so.\r\n\r\n“He told me, and my own heart grew cold as ice as I listened. My poor\r\nGennaro, in his wild and fiery days, when all the world seemed against\r\nhim and his mind was driven half mad by the injustices of life, had\r\njoined a Neapolitan society, the Red Circle, which was allied to the\r\nold Carbonari. The oaths and secrets of this brotherhood were\r\nfrightful, but once within its rule no escape was possible. When we had\r\nfled to America Gennaro thought that he had cast it all off forever.\r\nWhat was his horror one evening to meet in the streets the very man who\r\nhad initiated him in Naples, the giant Gorgiano, a man who had earned\r\nthe name of ‘Death’ in the south of Italy, for he was red to the elbow\r\nin murder! He had come to New York to avoid the Italian police, and he\r\nhad already planted a branch of this dreadful society in his new home.\r\nAll this Gennaro told me and showed me a summons which he had received\r\nthat very day, a Red Circle drawn upon the head of it telling him that\r\na lodge would be held upon a certain date, and that his presence at it\r\nwas required and ordered.\r\n\r\n“That was bad enough, but worse was to come. I had noticed for some\r\ntime that when Gorgiano came to us, as he constantly did, in the\r\nevening, he spoke much to me; and even when his words were to my\r\nhusband those terrible, glaring, wild-beast eyes of his were always\r\nturned upon me. One night his secret came out. I had awakened what he\r\ncalled ‘love’ within him—the love of a brute—a savage. Gennaro had not\r\nyet returned when he came. He pushed his way in, seized me in his\r\nmighty arms, hugged me in his bear’s embrace, covered me with kisses,\r\nand implored me to come away with him. I was struggling and screaming\r\nwhen Gennaro entered and attacked him. He struck Gennaro senseless and\r\nfled from the house which he was never more to enter. It was a deadly\r\nenemy that we made that night.\r\n\r\n“A few days later came the meeting. Gennaro returned from it with a\r\nface which told me that something dreadful had occurred. It was worse\r\nthan we could have imagined possible. The funds of the society were\r\nraised by blackmailing rich Italians and threatening them with violence\r\nshould they refuse the money. It seems that Castalotte, our dear friend\r\nand benefactor, had been approached. He had refused to yield to\r\nthreats, and he had handed the notices to the police. It was resolved\r\nnow that such an example should be made of them as would prevent any\r\nother victim from rebelling. At the meeting it was arranged that he and\r\nhis house should be blown up with dynamite. There was a drawing of lots\r\nas to who should carry out the deed. Gennaro saw our enemy’s cruel face\r\nsmiling at him as he dipped his hand in the bag. No doubt it had been\r\nprearranged in some fashion, for it was the fatal disc with the Red\r\nCircle upon it, the mandate for murder, which lay upon his palm. He was\r\nto kill his best friend, or he was to expose himself and me to the\r\nvengeance of his comrades. It was part of their fiendish system to\r\npunish those whom they feared or hated by injuring not only their own\r\npersons but those whom they loved, and it was the knowledge of this\r\nwhich hung as a terror over my poor Gennaro’s head and drove him nearly\r\ncrazy with apprehension.\r\n\r\n“All that night we sat together, our arms round each other, each\r\nstrengthening each for the troubles that lay before us. The very next\r\nevening had been fixed for the attempt. By midday my husband and I were\r\non our way to London, but not before he had given our benefactor full\r\nwarning of this danger, and had also left such information for the\r\npolice as would safeguard his life for the future.\r\n\r\n“The rest, gentlemen, you know for yourselves. We were sure that our\r\nenemies would be behind us like our own shadows. Gorgiano had his\r\nprivate reasons for vengeance, but in any case we knew how ruthless,\r\ncunning, and untiring he could be. Both Italy and America are full of\r\nstories of his dreadful powers. If ever they were exerted it would be\r\nnow. My darling made use of the few clear days which our start had\r\ngiven us in arranging for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no\r\npossible danger could reach me. For his own part, he wished to be free\r\nthat he might communicate both with the American and with the Italian\r\npolice. I do not myself know where he lived, or how. All that I learned\r\nwas through the columns of a newspaper. But once as I looked through my\r\nwindow, I saw two Italians watching the house, and I understood that in\r\nsome way Gorgiano had found our retreat. Finally Gennaro told me,\r\nthrough the paper, that he would signal to me from a certain window,\r\nbut when the signals came they were nothing but warnings, which were\r\nsuddenly interrupted. It is very clear to me now that he knew Gorgiano\r\nto be close upon him, and that, thank God! he was ready for him when he\r\ncame. And now, gentleman, I would ask you whether we have anything to\r\nfear from the law, or whether any judge upon earth would condemn my\r\nGennaro for what he has done?”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Gregson,” said the American, looking across at the official,\r\n“I don’t know what your British point of view may be, but I guess that\r\nin New York this lady’s husband will receive a pretty general vote of\r\nthanks.”\r\n\r\n“She will have to come with me and see the chief,” Gregson answered.\r\n“If what she says is corroborated, I do not think she or her husband\r\nhas much to fear. But what I can’t make head or tail of, Mr. Holmes, is\r\nhow on earth _you_ got yourself mixed up in the matter.”\r\n\r\n“Education, Gregson, education. Still seeking knowledge at the old\r\nuniversity. Well, Watson, you have one more specimen of the tragic and\r\ngrotesque to add to your collection. By the way, it is not eight\r\no’clock, and a Wagner night at Covent Garden! If we hurry, we might be\r\nin time for the second act.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax\r\n\r\n\r\n“But why Turkish?” asked Mr. Sherlock Holmes, gazing fixedly at my\r\nboots. I was reclining in a cane-backed chair at the moment, and my\r\nprotruded feet had attracted his ever-active attention.\r\n\r\n“English,” I answered in some surprise. “I got them at Latimer’s, in\r\nOxford Street.”\r\n\r\nHolmes smiled with an expression of weary patience.\r\n\r\n“The bath!” he said; “the bath! Why the relaxing and expensive Turkish\r\nrather than the invigorating home-made article?”\r\n\r\n“Because for the last few days I have been feeling rheumatic and old. A\r\nTurkish bath is what we call an alterative in medicine—a fresh\r\nstarting-point, a cleanser of the system.\r\n\r\n“By the way, Holmes,” I added, “I have no doubt the connection between\r\nmy boots and a Turkish bath is a perfectly self-evident one to a\r\nlogical mind, and yet I should be obliged to you if you would indicate\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“The train of reasoning is not very obscure, Watson,” said Holmes with\r\na mischievous twinkle. “It belongs to the same elementary class of\r\ndeduction which I should illustrate if I were to ask you who shared\r\nyour cab in your drive this morning.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t admit that a fresh illustration is an explanation,” said I\r\nwith some asperity.\r\n\r\n“Bravo, Watson! A very dignified and logical remonstrance. Let me see,\r\nwhat were the points? Take the last one first—the cab. You observe that\r\nyou have some splashes on the left sleeve and shoulder of your coat.\r\nHad you sat in the centre of a hansom you would probably have had no\r\nsplashes, and if you had they would certainly have been symmetrical.\r\nTherefore it is clear that you sat at the side. Therefore it is equally\r\nclear that you had a companion.”\r\n\r\n“That is very evident.”\r\n\r\n“Absurdly commonplace, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“But the boots and the bath?”\r\n\r\n“Equally childish. You are in the habit of doing up your boots in a\r\ncertain way. I see them on this occasion fastened with an elaborate\r\ndouble bow, which is not your usual method of tying them. You have,\r\ntherefore, had them off. Who has tied them? A bootmaker—or the boy at\r\nthe bath. It is unlikely that it is the bootmaker, since your boots are\r\nnearly new. Well, what remains? The bath. Absurd, is it not? But, for\r\nall that, the Turkish bath has served a purpose.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“You say that you have had it because you need a change. Let me suggest\r\nthat you take one. How would Lausanne do, my dear Watson—first-class\r\ntickets and all expenses paid on a princely scale?”\r\n\r\n“Splendid! But why?”\r\n\r\nHolmes leaned back in his armchair and took his notebook from his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n“One of the most dangerous classes in the world,” said he, “is the\r\ndrifting and friendless woman. She is the most harmless and often the\r\nmost useful of mortals, but she is the inevitable inciter of crime in\r\nothers. She is helpless. She is migratory. She has sufficient means to\r\ntake her from country to country and from hotel to hotel. She is lost,\r\nas often as not, in a maze of obscure _pensions_ and boardinghouses.\r\nShe is a stray chicken in a world of foxes. When she is gobbled up she\r\nis hardly missed. I much fear that some evil has come to the Lady\r\nFrances Carfax.”\r\n\r\nI was relieved at this sudden descent from the general to the\r\nparticular. Holmes consulted his notes.\r\n\r\n“Lady Frances,” he continued, “is the sole survivor of the direct\r\nfamily of the late Earl of Rufton. The estates went, as you may\r\nremember, in the male line. She was left with limited means, but with\r\nsome very remarkable old Spanish jewellery of silver and curiously cut\r\ndiamonds to which she was fondly attached—too attached, for she refused\r\nto leave them with her banker and always carried them about with her. A\r\nrather pathetic figure, the Lady Frances, a beautiful woman, still in\r\nfresh middle age, and yet, by a strange change, the last derelict of\r\nwhat only twenty years ago was a goodly fleet.”\r\n\r\n“What has happened to her, then?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, what has happened to the Lady Frances? Is she alive or dead? There\r\nis our problem. She is a lady of precise habits, and for four years it\r\nhas been her invariable custom to write every second week to Miss\r\nDobney, her old governess, who has long retired and lives in\r\nCamberwell. It is this Miss Dobney who has consulted me. Nearly five\r\nweeks have passed without a word. The last letter was from the Hôtel\r\nNational at Lausanne. Lady Frances seems to have left there and given\r\nno address. The family are anxious, and as they are exceedingly wealthy\r\nno sum will be spared if we can clear the matter up.”\r\n\r\n“Is Miss Dobney the only source of information? Surely she had other\r\ncorrespondents?”\r\n\r\n“There is one correspondent who is a sure draw, Watson. That is the\r\nbank. Single ladies must live, and their passbooks are compressed\r\ndiaries. She banks at Silvester’s. I have glanced over her account. The\r\nlast check but one paid her bill at Lausanne, but it was a large one\r\nand probably left her with cash in hand. Only one check has been drawn\r\nsince.”\r\n\r\n“To whom, and where?”\r\n\r\n“To Miss Marie Devine. There is nothing to show where the check was\r\ndrawn. It was cashed at the Crédit Lyonnais at Montpellier less than\r\nthree weeks ago. The sum was fifty pounds.”\r\n\r\n“And who is Miss Marie Devine?”\r\n\r\n“That also I have been able to discover. Miss Marie Devine was the maid\r\nof Lady Frances Carfax. Why she should have paid her this check we have\r\nnot yet determined. I have no doubt, however, that your researches will\r\nsoon clear the matter up.”\r\n\r\n“_My_ researches!”\r\n\r\n“Hence the health-giving expedition to Lausanne. You know that I cannot\r\npossibly leave London while old Abrahams is in such mortal terror of\r\nhis life. Besides, on general principles it is best that I should not\r\nleave the country. Scotland Yard feels lonely without me, and it causes\r\nan unhealthy excitement among the criminal classes. Go, then, my dear\r\nWatson, and if my humble counsel can ever be valued at so extravagant a\r\nrate as two pence a word, it waits your disposal night and day at the\r\nend of the Continental wire.”\r\n\r\nTwo days later found me at the Hôtel National at Lausanne, where I\r\nreceived every courtesy at the hands of M. Moser, the well-known\r\nmanager. Lady Frances, as he informed me, had stayed there for several\r\nweeks. She had been much liked by all who met her. Her age was not more\r\nthan forty. She was still handsome and bore every sign of having in her\r\nyouth been a very lovely woman. M. Moser knew nothing of any valuable\r\njewellery, but it had been remarked by the servants that the heavy\r\ntrunk in the lady’s bedroom was always scrupulously locked. Marie\r\nDevine, the maid, was as popular as her mistress. She was actually\r\nengaged to one of the head waiters in the hotel, and there was no\r\ndifficulty in getting her address. It was 11, Rue de Trajan,\r\nMontpellier. All this I jotted down and felt that Holmes himself could\r\nnot have been more adroit in collecting his facts.\r\n\r\nOnly one corner still remained in the shadow. No light which I\r\npossessed could clear up the cause for the lady’s sudden departure. She\r\nwas very happy at Lausanne. There was every reason to believe that she\r\nintended to remain for the season in her luxurious rooms overlooking\r\nthe lake. And yet she had left at a single day’s notice, which involved\r\nher in the useless payment of a week’s rent. Only Jules Vibart, the\r\nlover of the maid, had any suggestion to offer. He connected the sudden\r\ndeparture with the visit to the hotel a day or two before of a tall,\r\ndark, bearded man. “_Un sauvage—un veritable sauvage!_” cried Jules\r\nVibart. The man had rooms somewhere in the town. He had been seen\r\ntalking earnestly to Madame on the promenade by the lake. Then he had\r\ncalled. She had refused to see him. He was English, but of his name\r\nthere was no record. Madame had left the place immediately afterwards.\r\nJules Vibart, and, what was of more importance, Jules Vibart’s\r\nsweetheart, thought that this call and the departure were cause and\r\neffect. Only one thing Jules would not discuss. That was the reason why\r\nMarie had left her mistress. Of that he could or would say nothing. If\r\nI wished to know, I must go to Montpellier and ask her.\r\n\r\nSo ended the first chapter of my inquiry. The second was devoted to the\r\nplace which Lady Frances Carfax had sought when she left Lausanne.\r\nConcerning this there had been some secrecy, which confirmed the idea\r\nthat she had gone with the intention of throwing someone off her track.\r\nOtherwise why should not her luggage have been openly labelled for\r\nBaden? Both she and it reached the Rhenish spa by some circuitous\r\nroute. This much I gathered from the manager of Cook’s local office. So\r\nto Baden I went, after dispatching to Holmes an account of all my\r\nproceedings and receiving in reply a telegram of half-humorous\r\ncommendation.\r\n\r\nAt Baden the track was not difficult to follow. Lady Frances had stayed\r\nat the Englischer Hof for a fortnight. While there she had made the\r\nacquaintance of a Dr. Shlessinger and his wife, a missionary from South\r\nAmerica. Like most lonely ladies, Lady Frances found her comfort and\r\noccupation in religion. Dr. Shlessinger’s remarkable personality, his\r\nwhole hearted devotion, and the fact that he was recovering from a\r\ndisease contracted in the exercise of his apostolic duties affected her\r\ndeeply. She had helped Mrs. Shlessinger in the nursing of the\r\nconvalescent saint. He spent his day, as the manager described it to\r\nme, upon a lounge-chair on the veranda, with an attendant lady upon\r\neither side of him. He was preparing a map of the Holy Land, with\r\nspecial reference to the kingdom of the Midianites, upon which he was\r\nwriting a monograph. Finally, having improved much in health, he and\r\nhis wife had returned to London, and Lady Frances had started thither\r\nin their company. This was just three weeks before, and the manager had\r\nheard nothing since. As to the maid, Marie, she had gone off some days\r\nbeforehand in floods of tears, after informing the other maids that she\r\nwas leaving service forever. Dr. Shlessinger had paid the bill of the\r\nwhole party before his departure.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” said the landlord in conclusion, “you are not the only\r\nfriend of Lady Frances Carfax who is inquiring after her just now. Only\r\na week or so ago we had a man here upon the same errand.”\r\n\r\n“Did he give a name?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“None; but he was an Englishman, though of an unusual type.”\r\n\r\n“A savage?” said I, linking my facts after the fashion of my\r\nillustrious friend.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. That describes him very well. He is a bulky, bearded,\r\nsunburned fellow, who looks as if he would be more at home in a\r\nfarmers’ inn than in a fashionable hotel. A hard, fierce man, I should\r\nthink, and one whom I should be sorry to offend.”\r\n\r\nAlready the mystery began to define itself, as figures grow clearer\r\nwith the lifting of a fog. Here was this good and pious lady pursued\r\nfrom place to place by a sinister and unrelenting figure. She feared\r\nhim, or she would not have fled from Lausanne. He had still followed.\r\nSooner or later he would overtake her. Had he already overtaken her?\r\nWas _that_ the secret of her continued silence? Could the good people\r\nwho were her companions not screen her from his violence or his\r\nblackmail? What horrible purpose, what deep design, lay behind this\r\nlong pursuit? There was the problem which I had to solve.\r\n\r\nTo Holmes I wrote showing how rapidly and surely I had got down to the\r\nroots of the matter. In reply I had a telegram asking for a description\r\nof Dr. Shlessinger’s left ear. Holmes’s ideas of humour are strange and\r\noccasionally offensive, so I took no notice of his ill-timed\r\njest—indeed, I had already reached Montpellier in my pursuit of the\r\nmaid, Marie, before his message came.\r\n\r\nI had no difficulty in finding the ex-servant and in learning all that\r\nshe could tell me. She was a devoted creature, who had only left her\r\nmistress because she was sure that she was in good hands, and because\r\nher own approaching marriage made a separation inevitable in any case.\r\nHer mistress had, as she confessed with distress, shown some\r\nirritability of temper towards her during their stay in Baden, and had\r\neven questioned her once as if she had suspicions of her honesty, and\r\nthis had made the parting easier than it would otherwise have been.\r\nLady Frances had given her fifty pounds as a wedding-present. Like me,\r\nMarie viewed with deep distrust the stranger who had driven her\r\nmistress from Lausanne. With her own eyes she had seen him seize the\r\nlady’s wrist with great violence on the public promenade by the lake.\r\nHe was a fierce and terrible man. She believed that it was out of dread\r\nof him that Lady Frances had accepted the escort of the Shlessingers to\r\nLondon. She had never spoken to Marie about it, but many little signs\r\nhad convinced the maid that her mistress lived in a state of continual\r\nnervous apprehension. So far she had got in her narrative, when\r\nsuddenly she sprang from her chair and her face was convulsed with\r\nsurprise and fear. “See!” she cried. “The miscreant follows still!\r\nThere is the very man of whom I speak.”\r\n\r\nThrough the open sitting-room window I saw a huge, swarthy man with a\r\nbristling black beard walking slowly down the centre of the street and\r\nstaring eagerly at the numbers of the houses. It was clear that, like\r\nmyself, he was on the track of the maid. Acting upon the impulse of the\r\nmoment, I rushed out and accosted him.\r\n\r\n“You are an Englishman,” I said.\r\n\r\n“What if I am?” he asked with a most villainous scowl.\r\n\r\n“May I ask what your name is?”\r\n\r\n“No, you may not,” said he with decision.\r\n\r\nThe situation was awkward, but the most direct way is often the best.\r\n\r\n“Where is the Lady Frances Carfax?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHe stared at me with amazement.\r\n\r\n“What have you done with her? Why have you pursued her? I insist upon\r\nan answer!” said I.\r\n\r\nThe fellow gave a bellow of anger and sprang upon me like a tiger. I\r\nhave held my own in many a struggle, but the man had a grip of iron and\r\nthe fury of a fiend. His hand was on my throat and my senses were\r\nnearly gone before an unshaven French _ouvrier_ in a blue blouse darted\r\nout from a _cabaret_ opposite, with a cudgel in his hand, and struck my\r\nassailant a sharp crack over the forearm, which made him leave go his\r\nhold. He stood for an instant fuming with rage and uncertain whether he\r\nshould not renew his attack. Then, with a snarl of anger, he left me\r\nand entered the cottage from which I had just come. I turned to thank\r\nmy preserver, who stood beside me in the roadway.\r\n\r\n“Well, Watson,” said he, “a very pretty hash you have made of it! I\r\nrather think you had better come back with me to London by the night\r\nexpress.”\r\n\r\nAn hour afterwards, Sherlock Holmes, in his usual garb and style, was\r\nseated in my private room at the hotel. His explanation of his sudden\r\nand opportune appearance was simplicity itself, for, finding that he\r\ncould get away from London, he determined to head me off at the next\r\nobvious point of my travels. In the disguise of a workingman he had sat\r\nin the _cabaret_ waiting for my appearance.\r\n\r\n“And a singularly consistent investigation you have made, my dear\r\nWatson,” said he. “I cannot at the moment recall any possible blunder\r\nwhich you have omitted. The total effect of your proceeding has been to\r\ngive the alarm everywhere and yet to discover nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you would have done no better,” I answered bitterly.\r\n\r\n“There is no ‘perhaps’ about it. I _have_ done better. Here is the Hon.\r\nPhilip Green, who is a fellow-lodger with you in this hotel, and we may\r\nfind him the starting-point for a more successful investigation.”\r\n\r\nA card had come up on a salver, and it was followed by the same bearded\r\nruffian who had attacked me in the street. He started when he saw me.\r\n\r\n“What is this, Mr. Holmes?” he asked. “I had your note and I have come.\r\nBut what has this man to do with the matter?”\r\n\r\n“This is my old friend and associate, Dr. Watson, who is helping us in\r\nthis affair.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger held out a huge, sunburned hand, with a few words of\r\napology.\r\n\r\n“I hope I didn’t harm you. When you accused me of hurting her I lost my\r\ngrip of myself. Indeed, I’m not responsible in these days. My nerves\r\nare like live wires. But this situation is beyond me. What I want to\r\nknow, in the first place, Mr. Holmes, is, how in the world you came to\r\nhear of my existence at all.”\r\n\r\n“I am in touch with Miss Dobney, Lady Frances’s governess.”\r\n\r\n“Old Susan Dobney with the mob cap! I remember her well.”\r\n\r\n“And she remembers you. It was in the days before—before you found it\r\nbetter to go to South Africa.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I see you know my whole story. I need hide nothing from you. I\r\nswear to you, Mr. Holmes, that there never was in this world a man who\r\nloved a woman with a more wholehearted love than I had for Frances. I\r\nwas a wild youngster, I know—not worse than others of my class. But her\r\nmind was pure as snow. She could not bear a shadow of coarseness. So,\r\nwhen she came to hear of things that I had done, she would have no more\r\nto say to me. And yet she loved me—that is the wonder of it!—loved me\r\nwell enough to remain single all her sainted days just for my sake\r\nalone. When the years had passed and I had made my money at Barberton I\r\nthought perhaps I could seek her out and soften her. I had heard that\r\nshe was still unmarried, I found her at Lausanne and tried all I knew.\r\nShe weakened, I think, but her will was strong, and when next I called\r\nshe had left the town. I traced her to Baden, and then after a time\r\nheard that her maid was here. I’m a rough fellow, fresh from a rough\r\nlife, and when Dr. Watson spoke to me as he did I lost hold of myself\r\nfor a moment. But for God’s sake tell me what has become of the Lady\r\nFrances.”\r\n\r\n“That is for us to find out,” said Sherlock Holmes with peculiar\r\ngravity. “What is your London address, Mr. Green?”\r\n\r\n“The Langham Hotel will find me.”\r\n\r\n“Then may I recommend that you return there and be on hand in case I\r\nshould want you? I have no desire to encourage false hopes, but you may\r\nrest assured that all that can be done will be done for the safety of\r\nLady Frances. I can say no more for the instant. I will leave you this\r\ncard so that you may be able to keep in touch with us. Now, Watson, if\r\nyou will pack your bag I will cable to Mrs. Hudson to make one of her\r\nbest efforts for two hungry travellers at 7:30 to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nA telegram was awaiting us when we reached our Baker Street rooms,\r\nwhich Holmes read with an exclamation of interest and threw across to\r\nme. “Jagged or torn,” was the message, and the place of origin, Baden.\r\n\r\n“What is this?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It is everything,” Holmes answered. “You may remember my seemingly\r\nirrelevant question as to this clerical gentleman’s left ear. You did\r\nnot answer it.”\r\n\r\n“I had left Baden and could not inquire.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. For this reason I sent a duplicate to the manager of the\r\nEnglischer Hof, whose answer lies here.”\r\n\r\n“What does it show?”\r\n\r\n“It shows, my dear Watson, that we are dealing with an exceptionally\r\nastute and dangerous man. The Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, missionary from\r\nSouth America, is none other than Holy Peters, one of the most\r\nunscrupulous rascals that Australia has ever evolved—and for a young\r\ncountry it has turned out some very finished types. His particular\r\nspecialty is the beguiling of lonely ladies by playing upon their\r\nreligious feelings, and his so-called wife, an Englishwoman named\r\nFraser, is a worthy helpmate. The nature of his tactics suggested his\r\nidentity to me, and this physical peculiarity—he was badly bitten in a\r\nsaloon-fight at Adelaide in ’89—confirmed my suspicion. This poor lady\r\nis in the hands of a most infernal couple, who will stick at nothing,\r\nWatson. That she is already dead is a very likely supposition. If not,\r\nshe is undoubtedly in some sort of confinement and unable to write to\r\nMiss Dobney or her other friends. It is always possible that she never\r\nreached London, or that she has passed through it, but the former is\r\nimprobable, as, with their system of registration, it is not easy for\r\nforeigners to play tricks with the Continental police; and the latter\r\nis also unlikely, as these rogues could not hope to find any other\r\nplace where it would be as easy to keep a person under restraint. All\r\nmy instincts tell me that she is in London, but as we have at present\r\nno possible means of telling where, we can only take the obvious steps,\r\neat our dinner, and possess our souls in patience. Later in the evening\r\nI will stroll down and have a word with friend Lestrade at Scotland\r\nYard.”\r\n\r\nBut neither the official police nor Holmes’s own small but very\r\nefficient organisation sufficed to clear away the mystery. Amid the\r\ncrowded millions of London the three persons we sought were as\r\ncompletely obliterated as if they had never lived. Advertisements were\r\ntried, and failed. Clues were followed, and led to nothing. Every\r\ncriminal resort which Shlessinger might frequent was drawn in vain. His\r\nold associates were watched, but they kept clear of him. And then\r\nsuddenly, after a week of helpless suspense there came a flash of\r\nlight. A silver-and-brilliant pendant of old Spanish design had been\r\npawned at Bovington’s, in Westminster Road. The pawner was a large,\r\nclean-shaven man of clerical appearance. His name and address were\r\ndemonstrably false. The ear had escaped notice, but the description was\r\nsurely that of Shlessinger.\r\n\r\nThree times had our bearded friend from the Langham called for news—the\r\nthird time within an hour of this fresh development. His clothes were\r\ngetting looser on his great body. He seemed to be wilting away in his\r\nanxiety. “If you will only give me something to do!” was his constant\r\nwail. At last Holmes could oblige him.\r\n\r\n“He has begun to pawn the jewels. We should get him now.”\r\n\r\n“But does this mean that any harm has befallen the Lady Frances?”\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head very gravely.\r\n\r\n“Supposing that they have held her prisoner up to now, it is clear that\r\nthey cannot let her loose without their own destruction. We must\r\nprepare for the worst.”\r\n\r\n“What can I do?”\r\n\r\n“These people do not know you by sight?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“It is possible that he will go to some other pawnbroker in the future.\r\nIn that case, we must begin again. On the other hand, he has had a fair\r\nprice and no questions asked, so if he is in need of ready-money he\r\nwill probably come back to Bovington’s. I will give you a note to them,\r\nand they will let you wait in the shop. If the fellow comes you will\r\nfollow him home. But no indiscretion, and, above all, no violence. I\r\nput you on your honour that you will take no step without my knowledge\r\nand consent.”\r\n\r\nFor two days the Hon. Philip Green (he was, I may mention, the son of\r\nthe famous admiral of that name who commanded the Sea of Azof fleet in\r\nthe Crimean War) brought us no news. On the evening of the third he\r\nrushed into our sitting-room, pale, trembling, with every muscle of his\r\npowerful frame quivering with excitement.\r\n\r\n“We have him! We have him!” he cried.\r\n\r\nHe was incoherent in his agitation. Holmes soothed him with a few words\r\nand thrust him into an armchair.\r\n\r\n“Come, now, give us the order of events,” said he.\r\n\r\n“She came only an hour ago. It was the wife, this time, but the pendant\r\nshe brought was the fellow of the other. She is a tall, pale woman,\r\nwith ferret eyes.”\r\n\r\n“That is the lady,” said Holmes.\r\n\r\n“She left the office and I followed her. She walked up the Kennington\r\nRoad, and I kept behind her. Presently she went into a shop. Mr.\r\nHolmes, it was an undertaker’s.”\r\n\r\nMy companion started. “Well?” he asked in that vibrant voice which told\r\nof the fiery soul behind the cold grey face.\r\n\r\n“She was talking to the woman behind the counter. I entered as well.\r\n‘It is late,’ I heard her say, or words to that effect. The woman was\r\nexcusing herself. ‘It should be there before now,’ she answered. ‘It\r\ntook longer, being out of the ordinary.’ They both stopped and looked\r\nat me, so I asked some questions and then left the shop.”\r\n\r\n“You did excellently well. What happened next?”\r\n\r\n“The woman came out, but I had hid myself in a doorway. Her suspicions\r\nhad been aroused, I think, for she looked round her. Then she called a\r\ncab and got in. I was lucky enough to get another and so to follow her.\r\nShe got down at last at No. 36, Poultney Square, Brixton. I drove past,\r\nleft my cab at the corner of the square, and watched the house.”\r\n\r\n“Did you see anyone?”\r\n\r\n“The windows were all in darkness save one on the lower floor. The\r\nblind was down, and I could not see in. I was standing there, wondering\r\nwhat I should do next, when a covered van drove up with two men in it.\r\nThey descended, took something out of the van, and carried it up the\r\nsteps to the hall door. Mr. Holmes, it was a coffin.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“For an instant I was on the point of rushing in. The door had been\r\nopened to admit the men and their burden. It was the woman who had\r\nopened it. But as I stood there she caught a glimpse of me, and I think\r\nthat she recognised me. I saw her start, and she hastily closed the\r\ndoor. I remembered my promise to you, and here I am.”\r\n\r\n“You have done excellent work,” said Holmes, scribbling a few words\r\nupon a half-sheet of paper. “We can do nothing legal without a warrant,\r\nand you can serve the cause best by taking this note down to the\r\nauthorities and getting one. There may be some difficulty, but I should\r\nthink that the sale of the jewellery should be sufficient. Lestrade\r\nwill see to all details.”\r\n\r\n“But they may murder her in the meanwhile. What could the coffin mean,\r\nand for whom could it be but for her?”\r\n\r\n“We will do all that can be done, Mr. Green. Not a moment will be lost.\r\nLeave it in our hands. Now, Watson,” he added as our client hurried\r\naway, “he will set the regular forces on the move. We are, as usual,\r\nthe irregulars, and we must take our own line of action. The situation\r\nstrikes me as so desperate that the most extreme measures are\r\njustified. Not a moment is to be lost in getting to Poultney Square.\r\n\r\n“Let us try to reconstruct the situation,” said he as we drove swiftly\r\npast the Houses of Parliament and over Westminster Bridge. “These\r\nvillains have coaxed this unhappy lady to London, after first\r\nalienating her from her faithful maid. If she has written any letters\r\nthey have been intercepted. Through some confederate they have engaged\r\na furnished house. Once inside it, they have made her a prisoner, and\r\nthey have become possessed of the valuable jewellery which has been\r\ntheir object from the first. Already they have begun to sell part of\r\nit, which seems safe enough to them, since they have no reason to think\r\nthat anyone is interested in the lady’s fate. When she is released she\r\nwill, of course, denounce them. Therefore, she must not be released.\r\nBut they cannot keep her under lock and key forever. So murder is their\r\nonly solution.”\r\n\r\n“That seems very clear.”\r\n\r\n“Now we will take another line of reasoning. When you follow two\r\nseparate chains of thought, Watson, you will find some point of\r\nintersection which should approximate to the truth. We will start now,\r\nnot from the lady but from the coffin and argue backward. That incident\r\nproves, I fear, beyond all doubt that the lady is dead. It points also\r\nto an orthodox burial with proper accompaniment of medical certificate\r\nand official sanction. Had the lady been obviously murdered, they would\r\nhave buried her in a hole in the back garden. But here all is open and\r\nregular. What does this mean? Surely that they have done her to death\r\nin some way which has deceived the doctor and simulated a natural\r\nend—poisoning, perhaps. And yet how strange that they should ever let a\r\ndoctor approach her unless he were a confederate, which is hardly a\r\ncredible proposition.”\r\n\r\n“Could they have forged a medical certificate?”\r\n\r\n“Dangerous, Watson, very dangerous. No, I hardly see them doing that.\r\nPull up, cabby! This is evidently the undertaker’s, for we have just\r\npassed the pawnbroker’s. Would you go in, Watson? Your appearance\r\ninspires confidence. Ask what hour the Poultney Square funeral takes\r\nplace to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThe woman in the shop answered me without hesitation that it was to be\r\nat eight o’clock in the morning. “You see, Watson, no mystery;\r\neverything above-board! In some way the legal forms have undoubtedly\r\nbeen complied with, and they think that they have little to fear. Well,\r\nthere’s nothing for it now but a direct frontal attack. Are you armed?”\r\n\r\n“My stick!”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, we shall be strong enough. ‘Thrice is he armed who hath\r\nhis quarrel just.’ We simply can’t afford to wait for the police or to\r\nkeep within the four corners of the law. You can drive off, cabby. Now,\r\nWatson, we’ll just take our luck together, as we have occasionally in\r\nthe past.”\r\n\r\nHe had rung loudly at the door of a great dark house in the centre of\r\nPoultney Square. It was opened immediately, and the figure of a tall\r\nwoman was outlined against the dim-lit hall.\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you want?” she asked sharply, peering at us through the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n“I want to speak to Dr. Shlessinger,” said Holmes.\r\n\r\n“There is no such person here,” she answered, and tried to close the\r\ndoor, but Holmes had jammed it with his foot.\r\n\r\n“Well, I want to see the man who lives here, whatever he may call\r\nhimself,” said Holmes firmly.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. Then she threw open the door. “Well, come in!” said she.\r\n“My husband is not afraid to face any man in the world.” She closed the\r\ndoor behind us and showed us into a sitting-room on the right side of\r\nthe hall, turning up the gas as she left us. “Mr. Peters will be with\r\nyou in an instant,” she said.\r\n\r\nHer words were literally true, for we had hardly time to look around\r\nthe dusty and moth-eaten apartment in which we found ourselves before\r\nthe door opened and a big, clean-shaven bald-headed man stepped lightly\r\ninto the room. He had a large red face, with pendulous cheeks, and a\r\ngeneral air of superficial benevolence which was marred by a cruel,\r\nvicious mouth.\r\n\r\n“There is surely some mistake here, gentlemen,” he said in an unctuous,\r\nmake-everything-easy voice. “I fancy that you have been misdirected.\r\nPossibly if you tried farther down the street—”\r\n\r\n“That will do; we have no time to waste,” said my companion firmly.\r\n“You are Henry Peters, of Adelaide, late the Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, of\r\nBaden and South America. I am as sure of that as that my own name is\r\nSherlock Holmes.”\r\n\r\nPeters, as I will now call him, started and stared hard at his\r\nformidable pursuer. “I guess your name does not frighten me, Mr.\r\nHolmes,” said he coolly. “When a man’s conscience is easy you can’t\r\nrattle him. What is your business in my house?”\r\n\r\n“I want to know what you have done with the Lady Frances Carfax, whom\r\nyou brought away with you from Baden.”\r\n\r\n“I’d be very glad if you could tell me where that lady may be,” Peters\r\nanswered coolly. “I’ve a bill against her for nearly a hundred pounds,\r\nand nothing to show for it but a couple of trumpery pendants that the\r\ndealer would hardly look at. She attached herself to Mrs. Peters and me\r\nat Baden—it is a fact that I was using another name at the time—and she\r\nstuck on to us until we came to London. I paid her bill and her ticket.\r\nOnce in London, she gave us the slip, and, as I say, left these\r\nout-of-date jewels to pay her bills. You find her, Mr. Holmes, and I’m\r\nyour debtor.”\r\n\r\n“I _mean_ to find her,” said Sherlock Holmes. “I’m going through this\r\nhouse till I do find her.”\r\n\r\n“Where is your warrant?”\r\n\r\nHolmes half drew a revolver from his pocket. “This will have to serve\r\ntill a better one comes.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you’re a common burglar.”\r\n\r\n“So you might describe me,” said Holmes cheerfully. “My companion is\r\nalso a dangerous ruffian. And together we are going through your\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\nOur opponent opened the door.\r\n\r\n“Fetch a policeman, Annie!” said he. There was a whisk of feminine\r\nskirts down the passage, and the hall door was opened and shut.\r\n\r\n“Our time is limited, Watson,” said Holmes. “If you try to stop us,\r\nPeters, you will most certainly get hurt. Where is that coffin which\r\nwas brought into your house?”\r\n\r\n“What do you want with the coffin? It is in use. There is a body in\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“I must see the body.”\r\n\r\n“Never with my consent.”\r\n\r\n“Then without it.” With a quick movement Holmes pushed the fellow to\r\none side and passed into the hall. A door half opened stood immediately\r\nbefore us. We entered. It was the dining-room. On the table, under a\r\nhalf-lit chandelier, the coffin was lying. Holmes turned up the gas and\r\nraised the lid. Deep down in the recesses of the coffin lay an\r\nemaciated figure. The glare from the lights above beat down upon an\r\naged and withered face. By no possible process of cruelty, starvation,\r\nor disease could this worn-out wreck be the still beautiful Lady\r\nFrances. Holmes’s face showed his amazement, and also his relief.\r\n\r\n“Thank God!” he muttered. “It’s someone else.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you’ve blundered badly for once, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said\r\nPeters, who had followed us into the room.\r\n\r\n“Who is the dead woman?”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you really must know, she is an old nurse of my wife’s, Rose\r\nSpender by name, whom we found in the Brixton Workhouse Infirmary. We\r\nbrought her round here, called in Dr. Horsom, of 13, Firbank\r\nVillas—mind you take the address, Mr. Holmes—and had her carefully\r\ntended, as Christian folk should. On the third day she died—certificate\r\nsays senile decay—but that’s only the doctor’s opinion, and of course\r\nyou know better. We ordered her funeral to be carried out by Stimson\r\nand Co., of the Kennington Road, who will bury her at eight o’clock\r\nto-morrow morning. Can you pick any hole in that, Mr. Holmes? You’ve\r\nmade a silly blunder, and you may as well own up to it. I’d give\r\nsomething for a photograph of your gaping, staring face when you pulled\r\naside that lid expecting to see the Lady Frances Carfax and only found\r\na poor old woman of ninety.”\r\n\r\nHolmes’s expression was as impassive as ever under the jeers of his\r\nantagonist, but his clenched hands betrayed his acute annoyance.\r\n\r\n“I am going through your house,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Are you, though!” cried Peters as a woman’s voice and heavy steps\r\nsounded in the passage. “We’ll soon see about that. This way, officers,\r\nif you please. These men have forced their way into my house, and I\r\ncannot get rid of them. Help me to put them out.”\r\n\r\nA sergeant and a constable stood in the doorway. Holmes drew his card\r\nfrom his case.\r\n\r\n“This is my name and address. This is my friend, Dr. Watson.”\r\n\r\n“Bless you, sir, we know you very well,” said the sergeant, “but you\r\ncan’t stay here without a warrant.”\r\n\r\n“Of course not. I quite understand that.”\r\n\r\n“Arrest him!” cried Peters.\r\n\r\n“We know where to lay our hands on this gentleman if he is wanted,”\r\nsaid the sergeant majestically, “but you’ll have to go, Mr. Holmes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Watson, we shall have to go.”\r\n\r\nA minute later we were in the street once more. Holmes was as cool as\r\never, but I was hot with anger and humiliation. The sergeant had\r\nfollowed us.\r\n\r\n“Sorry, Mr. Holmes, but that’s the law.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly, Sergeant, you could not do otherwise.”\r\n\r\n“I expect there was good reason for your presence there. If there is\r\nanything I can do—”\r\n\r\n“It’s a missing lady, Sergeant, and we think she is in that house. I\r\nexpect a warrant presently.”\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll keep my eye on the parties, Mr. Holmes. If anything comes\r\nalong, I will surely let you know.”\r\n\r\nIt was only nine o’clock, and we were off full cry upon the trail at\r\nonce. First we drove to Brixton Workhouse Infirmary, where we found\r\nthat it was indeed the truth that a charitable couple had called some\r\ndays before, that they had claimed an imbecile old woman as a former\r\nservant, and that they had obtained permission to take her away with\r\nthem. No surprise was expressed at the news that she had since died.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was our next goal. He had been called in, had found the\r\nwoman dying of pure senility, had actually seen her pass away, and had\r\nsigned the certificate in due form. “I assure you that everything was\r\nperfectly normal and there was no room for foul play in the matter,”\r\nsaid he. Nothing in the house had struck him as suspicious save that\r\nfor people of their class it was remarkable that they should have no\r\nservant. So far and no further went the doctor.\r\n\r\nFinally we found our way to Scotland Yard. There had been difficulties\r\nof procedure in regard to the warrant. Some delay was inevitable. The\r\nmagistrate’s signature might not be obtained until next morning. If\r\nHolmes would call about nine he could go down with Lestrade and see it\r\nacted upon. So ended the day, save that near midnight our friend, the\r\nsergeant, called to say that he had seen flickering lights here and\r\nthere in the windows of the great dark house, but that no one had left\r\nit and none had entered. We could but pray for patience and wait for\r\nthe morrow.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was too irritable for conversation and too restless for\r\nsleep. I left him smoking hard, with his heavy, dark brows knotted\r\ntogether, and his long, nervous fingers tapping upon the arms of his\r\nchair, as he turned over in his mind every possible solution of the\r\nmystery. Several times in the course of the night I heard him prowling\r\nabout the house. Finally, just after I had been called in the morning,\r\nhe rushed into my room. He was in his dressing-gown, but his pale,\r\nhollow-eyed face told me that his night had been a sleepless one.\r\n\r\n“What time was the funeral? Eight, was it not?” he asked eagerly.\r\n“Well, it is 7:20 now. Good heavens, Watson, what has become of any\r\nbrains that God has given me? Quick, man, quick! It’s life or death—a\r\nhundred chances on death to one on life. I’ll never forgive myself,\r\nnever, if we are too late!”\r\n\r\nFive minutes had not passed before we were flying in a hansom down\r\nBaker Street. But even so it was twenty-five to eight as we passed Big\r\nBen, and eight struck as we tore down the Brixton Road. But others were\r\nlate as well as we. Ten minutes after the hour the hearse was still\r\nstanding at the door of the house, and even as our foaming horse came\r\nto a halt the coffin, supported by three men, appeared on the\r\nthreshold. Holmes darted forward and barred their way.\r\n\r\n“Take it back!” he cried, laying his hand on the breast of the\r\nforemost. “Take it back this instant!”\r\n\r\n“What the devil do you mean? Once again I ask you, where is your\r\nwarrant?” shouted the furious Peters, his big red face glaring over the\r\nfarther end of the coffin.\r\n\r\n“The warrant is on its way. The coffin shall remain in the house until\r\nit comes.”\r\n\r\nThe authority in Holmes’s voice had its effect upon the bearers. Peters\r\nhad suddenly vanished into the house, and they obeyed these new orders.\r\n“Quick, Watson, quick! Here is a screw-driver!” he shouted as the\r\ncoffin was replaced upon the table. “Here’s one for you, my man! A\r\nsovereign if the lid comes off in a minute! Ask no questions—work away!\r\nThat’s good! Another! And another! Now pull all together! It’s giving!\r\nIt’s giving! Ah, that does it at last.”\r\n\r\nWith a united effort we tore off the coffin-lid. As we did so there\r\ncame from the inside a stupefying and overpowering smell of chloroform.\r\nA body lay within, its head all wreathed in cotton-wool, which had been\r\nsoaked in the narcotic. Holmes plucked it off and disclosed the\r\nstatuesque face of a handsome and spiritual woman of middle age. In an\r\ninstant he had passed his arm round the figure and raised her to a\r\nsitting position.\r\n\r\n“Is she gone, Watson? Is there a spark left? Surely we are not too\r\nlate!”\r\n\r\nFor half an hour it seemed that we were. What with actual suffocation,\r\nand what with the poisonous fumes of the chloroform, the Lady Frances\r\nseemed to have passed the last point of recall. And then, at last, with\r\nartificial respiration, with injected ether, and with every device that\r\nscience could suggest, some flutter of life, some quiver of the\r\neyelids, some dimming of a mirror, spoke of the slowly returning life.\r\nA cab had driven up, and Holmes, parting the blind, looked out at it.\r\n“Here is Lestrade with his warrant,” said he. “He will find that his\r\nbirds have flown. And here,” he added as a heavy step hurried along the\r\npassage, “is someone who has a better right to nurse this lady than we\r\nhave. Good morning, Mr. Green; I think that the sooner we can move the\r\nLady Frances the better. Meanwhile, the funeral may proceed, and the\r\npoor old woman who still lies in that coffin may go to her last\r\nresting-place alone.”\r\n\r\n“Should you care to add the case to your annals, my dear Watson,” said\r\nHolmes that evening, “it can only be as an example of that temporary\r\neclipse to which even the best-balanced mind may be exposed. Such slips\r\nare common to all mortals, and the greatest is he who can recognise and\r\nrepair them. To this modified credit I may, perhaps, make some claim.\r\nMy night was haunted by the thought that somewhere a clue, a strange\r\nsentence, a curious observation, had come under my notice and had been\r\ntoo easily dismissed. Then, suddenly, in the grey of the morning, the\r\nwords came back to me. It was the remark of the undertaker’s wife, as\r\nreported by Philip Green. She had said, ‘It should be there before now.\r\nIt took longer, being out of the ordinary.’ It was the coffin of which\r\nshe spoke. It had been out of the ordinary. That could only mean that\r\nit had been made to some special measurement. But why? Why? Then in an\r\ninstant I remembered the deep sides, and the little wasted figure at\r\nthe bottom. Why so large a coffin for so small a body? To leave room\r\nfor another body. Both would be buried under the one certificate. It\r\nhad all been so clear, if only my own sight had not been dimmed. At\r\neight the Lady Frances would be buried. Our one chance was to stop the\r\ncoffin before it left the house.\r\n\r\n“It was a desperate chance that we might find her alive, but it _was_ a\r\nchance, as the result showed. These people had never, to my knowledge,\r\ndone a murder. They might shrink from actual violence at the last. They\r\ncould bury her with no sign of how she met her end, and even if she\r\nwere exhumed there was a chance for them. I hoped that such\r\nconsiderations might prevail with them. You can reconstruct the scene\r\nwell enough. You saw the horrible den upstairs, where the poor lady had\r\nbeen kept so long. They rushed in and overpowered her with their\r\nchloroform, carried her down, poured more into the coffin to insure\r\nagainst her waking, and then screwed down the lid. A clever device,\r\nWatson. It is new to me in the annals of crime. If our ex-missionary\r\nfriends escape the clutches of Lestrade, I shall expect to hear of some\r\nbrilliant incidents in their future career.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adventure of the Dying Detective\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Hudson, the landlady of Sherlock Holmes, was a long-suffering\r\nwoman. Not only was her first-floor flat invaded at all hours by\r\nthrongs of singular and often undesirable characters but her remarkable\r\nlodger showed an eccentricity and irregularity in his life which must\r\nhave sorely tried her patience. His incredible untidiness, his\r\naddiction to music at strange hours, his occasional revolver practice\r\nwithin doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific experiments,\r\nand the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him made\r\nhim the very worst tenant in London. On the other hand, his payments\r\nwere princely. I have no doubt that the house might have been purchased\r\nat the price which Holmes paid for his rooms during the years that I\r\nwas with him.\r\n\r\nThe landlady stood in the deepest awe of him and never dared to\r\ninterfere with him, however outrageous his proceedings might seem. She\r\nwas fond of him, too, for he had a remarkable gentleness and courtesy\r\nin his dealings with women. He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he\r\nwas always a chivalrous opponent. Knowing how genuine was her regard\r\nfor him, I listened earnestly to her story when she came to my rooms in\r\nthe second year of my married life and told me of the sad condition to\r\nwhich my poor friend was reduced.\r\n\r\n“He’s dying, Dr. Watson,” said she. “For three days he has been\r\nsinking, and I doubt if he will last the day. He would not let me get a\r\ndoctor. This morning when I saw his bones sticking out of his face and\r\nhis great bright eyes looking at me I could stand no more of it. ‘With\r\nyour leave or without it, Mr. Holmes, I am going for a doctor this very\r\nhour,’ said I. ‘Let it be Watson, then,’ said he. I wouldn’t waste an\r\nhour in coming to him, sir, or you may not see him alive.”\r\n\r\nI was horrified for I had heard nothing of his illness. I need not say\r\nthat I rushed for my coat and my hat. As we drove back I asked for the\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n“There is little I can tell you, sir. He has been working at a case\r\ndown at Rotherhithe, in an alley near the river, and he has brought\r\nthis illness back with him. He took to his bed on Wednesday afternoon\r\nand has never moved since. For these three days neither food nor drink\r\nhas passed his lips.”\r\n\r\n“Good God! Why did you not call in a doctor?”\r\n\r\n“He wouldn’t have it, sir. You know how masterful he is. I didn’t dare\r\nto disobey him. But he’s not long for this world, as you’ll see for\r\nyourself the moment that you set eyes on him.”\r\n\r\nHe was indeed a deplorable spectacle. In the dim light of a foggy\r\nNovember day the sick room was a gloomy spot, but it was that gaunt,\r\nwasted face staring at me from the bed which sent a chill to my heart.\r\nHis eyes had the brightness of fever, there was a hectic flush upon\r\neither cheek, and dark crusts clung to his lips; the thin hands upon\r\nthe coverlet twitched incessantly, his voice was croaking and\r\nspasmodic. He lay listlessly as I entered the room, but the sight of me\r\nbrought a gleam of recognition to his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Well, Watson, we seem to have fallen upon evil days,” said he in a\r\nfeeble voice, but with something of his old carelessness of manner.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow!” I cried, approaching him.\r\n\r\n“Stand back! Stand right back!” said he with the sharp imperiousness\r\nwhich I had associated only with moments of crisis. “If you approach\r\nme, Watson, I shall order you out of the house.”\r\n\r\n“But why?”\r\n\r\n“Because it is my desire. Is that not enough?”\r\n\r\nYes, Mrs. Hudson was right. He was more masterful than ever. It was\r\npitiful, however, to see his exhaustion.\r\n\r\n“I only wished to help,” I explained.\r\n\r\n“Exactly! You will help best by doing what you are told.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Holmes.”\r\n\r\nHe relaxed the austerity of his manner.\r\n\r\n“You are not angry?” he asked, gasping for breath.\r\n\r\nPoor devil, how could I be angry when I saw him lying in such a plight\r\nbefore me?\r\n\r\n“It’s for your own sake, Watson,” he croaked.\r\n\r\n“For _my_ sake?”\r\n\r\n“I know what is the matter with me. It is a coolie disease from\r\nSumatra—a thing that the Dutch know more about than we, though they\r\nhave made little of it up to date. One thing only is certain. It is\r\ninfallibly deadly, and it is horribly contagious.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke now with a feverish energy, the long hands twitching and\r\njerking as he motioned me away.\r\n\r\n“Contagious by touch, Watson—that’s it, by touch. Keep your distance\r\nand all is well.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens, Holmes! Do you suppose that such a consideration weighs\r\nwith me of an instant? It would not affect me in the case of a\r\nstranger. Do you imagine it would prevent me from doing my duty to so\r\nold a friend?”\r\n\r\nAgain I advanced, but he repulsed me with a look of furious anger.\r\n\r\n“If you will stand there I will talk. If you do not you must leave the\r\nroom.”\r\n\r\nI have so deep a respect for the extraordinary qualities of Holmes that\r\nI have always deferred to his wishes, even when I least understood\r\nthem. But now all my professional instincts were aroused. Let him be my\r\nmaster elsewhere, I at least was his in a sick room.\r\n\r\n“Holmes,” said I, “you are not yourself. A sick man is but a child, and\r\nso I will treat you. Whether you like it or not, I will examine your\r\nsymptoms and treat you for them.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with venomous eyes.\r\n\r\n“If I am to have a doctor whether I will or not, let me at least have\r\nsomeone in whom I have confidence,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Then you have none in me?”\r\n\r\n“In your friendship, certainly. But facts are facts, Watson, and, after\r\nall, you are only a general practitioner with very limited experience\r\nand mediocre qualifications. It is painful to have to say these things,\r\nbut you leave me no choice.”\r\n\r\nI was bitterly hurt.\r\n\r\n“Such a remark is unworthy of you, Holmes. It shows me very clearly the\r\nstate of your own nerves. But if you have no confidence in me I would\r\nnot intrude my services. Let me bring Sir Jasper Meek or Penrose\r\nFisher, or any of the best men in London. But someone you _must_ have,\r\nand that is final. If you think that I am going to stand here and see\r\nyou die without either helping you myself or bringing anyone else to\r\nhelp you, then you have mistaken your man.”\r\n\r\n“You mean well, Watson,” said the sick man with something between a sob\r\nand a groan. “Shall I demonstrate your own ignorance? What do you know,\r\npray, of Tapanuli fever? What do you know of the black Formosa\r\ncorruption?”\r\n\r\n“I have never heard of either.”\r\n\r\n“There are many problems of disease, many strange pathological\r\npossibilities, in the East, Watson.” He paused after each sentence to\r\ncollect his failing strength. “I have learned so much during some\r\nrecent researches which have a medico-criminal aspect. It was in the\r\ncourse of them that I contracted this complaint. You can do nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly not. But I happen to know that Dr. Ainstree, the greatest\r\nliving authority upon tropical disease, is now in London. All\r\nremonstrance is useless, Holmes, I am going this instant to fetch him.”\r\nI turned resolutely to the door.\r\n\r\nNever have I had such a shock! In an instant, with a tiger-spring, the\r\ndying man had intercepted me. I heard the sharp snap of a twisted key.\r\nThe next moment he had staggered back to his bed, exhausted and panting\r\nafter his one tremendous outflame of energy.\r\n\r\n“You won’t take the key from me by force, Watson. I’ve got you, my\r\nfriend. Here you are, and here you will stay until I will otherwise.\r\nBut I’ll humour you.” (All this in little gasps, with terrible\r\nstruggles for breath between.) “You’ve only my own good at heart. Of\r\ncourse I know that very well. You shall have your way, but give me time\r\nto get my strength. Not now, Watson, not now. It’s four o’clock. At six\r\nyou can go.”\r\n\r\n“This is insanity, Holmes.”\r\n\r\n“Only two hours, Watson. I promise you will go at six. Are you content\r\nto wait?”\r\n\r\n“I seem to have no choice.”\r\n\r\n“None in the world, Watson. Thank you, I need no help in arranging the\r\nclothes. You will please keep your distance. Now, Watson, there is one\r\nother condition that I would make. You will seek help, not from the man\r\nyou mention, but from the one that I choose.”\r\n\r\n“By all means.”\r\n\r\n“The first three sensible words that you have uttered since you entered\r\nthis room, Watson. You will find some books over there. I am somewhat\r\nexhausted; I wonder how a battery feels when it pours electricity into\r\na non-conductor? At six, Watson, we resume our conversation.”\r\n\r\nBut it was destined to be resumed long before that hour, and in\r\ncircumstances which gave me a shock hardly second to that caused by his\r\nspring to the door. I had stood for some minutes looking at the silent\r\nfigure in the bed. His face was almost covered by the clothes and he\r\nappeared to be asleep. Then, unable to settle down to reading, I walked\r\nslowly round the room, examining the pictures of celebrated criminals\r\nwith which every wall was adorned. Finally, in my aimless\r\nperambulation, I came to the mantelpiece. A litter of pipes,\r\ntobacco-pouches, syringes, penknives, revolver-cartridges, and other\r\n_débris_ was scattered over it. In the midst of these was a small black\r\nand white ivory box with a sliding lid. It was a neat little thing, and\r\nI had stretched out my hand to examine it more closely, when——\r\n\r\nIt was a dreadful cry that he gave—a yell which might have been heard\r\ndown the street. My skin went cold and my hair bristled at that\r\nhorrible scream. As I turned I caught a glimpse of a convulsed face and\r\nfrantic eyes. I stood paralysed, with the little box in my hand.\r\n\r\n“Put it down! Down, this instant, Watson—this instant, I say!” His head\r\nsank back upon the pillow and he gave a deep sigh of relief as I\r\nreplaced the box upon the mantelpiece. “I hate to have my things\r\ntouched, Watson. You know that I hate it. You fidget me beyond\r\nendurance. You, a doctor—you are enough to drive a patient into an\r\nasylum. Sit down, man, and let me have my rest!”\r\n\r\nThe incident left a most unpleasant impression upon my mind. The\r\nviolent and causeless excitement, followed by this brutality of speech,\r\nso far removed from his usual suavity, showed me how deep was the\r\ndisorganisation of his mind. Of all ruins, that of a noble mind is the\r\nmost deplorable. I sat in silent dejection until the stipulated time\r\nhad passed. He seemed to have been watching the clock as well as I, for\r\nit was hardly six before he began to talk with the same feverish\r\nanimation as before.\r\n\r\n“Now, Watson,” said he. “Have you any change in your pocket?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Any silver?”\r\n\r\n“A good deal.”\r\n\r\n“How many half-crowns?”\r\n\r\n“I have five.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, too few! Too few! How very unfortunate, Watson! However, such as\r\nthey are you can put them in your watchpocket. And all the rest of your\r\nmoney in your left trouser pocket. Thank you. It will balance you so\r\nmuch better like that.”\r\n\r\nThis was raving insanity. He shuddered, and again made a sound between\r\na cough and a sob.\r\n\r\n“You will now light the gas, Watson, but you will be very careful that\r\nnot for one instant shall it be more than half on. I implore you to be\r\ncareful, Watson. Thank you, that is excellent. No, you need not draw\r\nthe blind. Now you will have the kindness to place some letters and\r\npapers upon this table within my reach. Thank you. Now some of that\r\nlitter from the mantelpiece. Excellent, Watson! There is a sugar-tongs\r\nthere. Kindly raise that small ivory box with its assistance. Place it\r\nhere among the papers. Good! You can now go and fetch Mr. Culverton\r\nSmith, of 13, Lower Burke Street.”\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, my desire to fetch a doctor had somewhat weakened,\r\nfor poor Holmes was so obviously delirious that it seemed dangerous to\r\nleave him. However, he was as eager now to consult the person named as\r\nhe had been obstinate in refusing.\r\n\r\n“I never heard the name,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Possibly not, my good Watson. It may surprise you to know that the man\r\nupon earth who is best versed in this disease is not a medical man, but\r\na planter. Mr. Culverton Smith is a well-known resident of Sumatra, now\r\nvisiting London. An outbreak of the disease upon his plantation, which\r\nwas distant from medical aid, caused him to study it himself, with some\r\nrather far-reaching consequences. He is a very methodical person, and I\r\ndid not desire you to start before six, because I was well aware that\r\nyou would not find him in his study. If you could persuade him to come\r\nhere and give us the benefit of his unique experience of this disease,\r\nthe investigation of which has been his dearest hobby, I cannot doubt\r\nthat he could help me.”\r\n\r\nI gave Holmes’s remarks as a consecutive whole and will not attempt to\r\nindicate how they were interrupted by gaspings for breath and those\r\nclutchings of his hands which indicated the pain from which he was\r\nsuffering. His appearance had changed for the worse during the few\r\nhours that I had been with him. Those hectic spots were more\r\npronounced, the eyes shone more brightly out of darker hollows, and a\r\ncold sweat glimmered upon his brow. He still retained, however, the\r\njaunty gallantry of his speech. To the last gasp he would always be the\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n“You will tell him exactly how you have left me,” said he. “You will\r\nconvey the very impression which is in your own mind—a dying man—a\r\ndying and delirious man. Indeed, I cannot think why the whole bed of\r\nthe ocean is not one solid mass of oysters, so prolific the creatures\r\nseem. Ah, I am wandering! Strange how the brain controls the brain!\r\nWhat was I saying, Watson?”\r\n\r\n“My directions for Mr. Culverton Smith.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, I remember. My life depends upon it. Plead with him, Watson.\r\nThere is no good feeling between us. His nephew, Watson—I had\r\nsuspicions of foul play and I allowed him to see it. The boy died\r\nhorribly. He has a grudge against me. You will soften him, Watson. Beg\r\nhim, pray him, get him here by any means. He can save me—only he!”\r\n\r\n“I will bring him in a cab, if I have to carry him down to it.”\r\n\r\n“You will do nothing of the sort. You will persuade him to come. And\r\nthen you will return in front of him. Make any excuse so as not to come\r\nwith him. Don’t forget, Watson. You won’t fail me. You never did fail\r\nme. No doubt there are natural enemies which limit the increase of the\r\ncreatures. You and I, Watson, we have done our part. Shall the world,\r\nthen, be overrun by oysters? No, no; horrible! You’ll convey all that\r\nis in your mind.”\r\n\r\nI left him full of the image of this magnificent intellect babbling\r\nlike a foolish child. He had handed me the key, and with a happy\r\nthought I took it with me lest he should lock himself in. Mrs. Hudson\r\nwas waiting, trembling and weeping, in the passage. Behind me as I\r\npassed from the flat I heard Holmes’s high, thin voice in some\r\ndelirious chant. Below, as I stood whistling for a cab, a man came on\r\nme through the fog.\r\n\r\n“How is Mr. Holmes, sir?” he asked.\r\n\r\nIt was an old acquaintance, Inspector Morton, of Scotland Yard, dressed\r\nin unofficial tweeds.\r\n\r\n“He is very ill,” I answered.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me in a most singular fashion. Had it not been too\r\nfiendish, I could have imagined that the gleam of the fanlight showed\r\nexultation in his face.\r\n\r\n“I heard some rumour of it,” said he.\r\n\r\nThe cab had driven up, and I left him.\r\n\r\nLower Burke Street proved to be a line of fine houses lying in the\r\nvague borderland between Notting Hill and Kensington. The particular\r\none at which my cabman pulled up had an air of smug and demure\r\nrespectability in its old-fashioned iron railings, its massive\r\nfolding-door, and its shining brasswork. All was in keeping with a\r\nsolemn butler who appeared framed in the pink radiance of a tinted\r\nelectrical light behind him.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Culverton Smith is in. Dr. Watson! Very good, sir, I will\r\ntake up your card.”\r\n\r\nMy humble name and title did not appear to impress Mr. Culverton Smith.\r\nThrough the half-open door I heard a high, petulant, penetrating voice.\r\n\r\n“Who is this person? What does he want? Dear me, Staples, how often\r\nhave I said that I am not to be disturbed in my hours of study?”\r\n\r\nThere came a gentle flow of soothing explanation from the butler.\r\n\r\n“Well, I won’t see him, Staples. I can’t have my work interrupted like\r\nthis. I am not at home. Say so. Tell him to come in the morning if he\r\nreally must see me.”\r\n\r\nAgain the gentle murmur.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, give him that message. He can come in the morning, or he\r\ncan stay away. My work must not be hindered.”\r\n\r\nI thought of Holmes tossing upon his bed of sickness and counting the\r\nminutes, perhaps, until I could bring help to him. It was not a time to\r\nstand upon ceremony. His life depended upon my promptness. Before the\r\napologetic butler had delivered his message I had pushed past him and\r\nwas in the room.\r\n\r\nWith a shrill cry of anger a man rose from a reclining chair beside the\r\nfire. I saw a great yellow face, coarse-grained and greasy, with heavy,\r\ndouble-chin, and two sullen, menacing grey eyes which glared at me from\r\nunder tufted and sandy brows. A high bald head had a small velvet\r\nsmoking-cap poised coquettishly upon one side of its pink curve. The\r\nskull was of enormous capacity, and yet as I looked down I saw to my\r\namazement that the figure of the man was small and frail, twisted in\r\nthe shoulders and back like one who has suffered from rickets in his\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\n“What’s this?” he cried in a high, screaming voice. “What is the\r\nmeaning of this intrusion? Didn’t I send you word that I would see you\r\nto-morrow morning?”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry,” said I, “but the matter cannot be delayed. Mr. Sherlock\r\nHolmes—”\r\n\r\nThe mention of my friend’s name had an extraordinary effect upon the\r\nlittle man. The look of anger passed in an instant from his face. His\r\nfeatures became tense and alert.\r\n\r\n“Have you come from Holmes?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I have just left him.”\r\n\r\n“What about Holmes? How is he?”\r\n\r\n“He is desperately ill. That is why I have come.”\r\n\r\nThe man motioned me to a chair, and turned to resume his own. As he did\r\nso I caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror over the mantelpiece. I\r\ncould have sworn that it was set in a malicious and abominable smile.\r\nYet I persuaded myself that it must have been some nervous contraction\r\nwhich I had surprised, for he turned to me an instant later with\r\ngenuine concern upon his features.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to hear this,” said he. “I only know Mr. Holmes through\r\nsome business dealings which we have had, but I have every respect for\r\nhis talents and his character. He is an amateur of crime, as I am of\r\ndisease. For him the villain, for me the microbe. There are my\r\nprisons,” he continued, pointing to a row of bottles and jars which\r\nstood upon a side table. “Among those gelatine cultivations some of the\r\nvery worst offenders in the world are now doing time.”\r\n\r\n“It was on account of your special knowledge that Mr. Holmes desired to\r\nsee you. He has a high opinion of you and thought that you were the one\r\nman in London who could help him.”\r\n\r\nThe little man started, and the jaunty smoking-cap slid to the floor.\r\n\r\n“Why?” he asked. “Why should Mr. Holmes think that I could help him in\r\nhis trouble?”\r\n\r\n“Because of your knowledge of Eastern diseases.”\r\n\r\n“But why should he think that this disease which he has contracted is\r\nEastern?”\r\n\r\n“Because, in some professional inquiry, he has been working among\r\nChinese sailors down in the docks.”\r\n\r\nMr. Culverton Smith smiled pleasantly and picked up his smoking-cap.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s it—is it?” said he. “I trust the matter is not so grave as\r\nyou suppose. How long has he been ill?”\r\n\r\n“About three days.”\r\n\r\n“Is he delirious?”\r\n\r\n“Occasionally.”\r\n\r\n“Tut, tut! This sounds serious. It would be inhuman not to answer his\r\ncall. I very much resent any interruption to my work, Dr. Watson, but\r\nthis case is certainly exceptional. I will come with you at once.”\r\n\r\nI remembered Holmes’s injunction.\r\n\r\n“I have another appointment,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Very good. I will go alone. I have a note of Mr. Holmes’s address. You\r\ncan rely upon my being there within half an hour at most.”\r\n\r\nIt was with a sinking heart that I reentered Holmes’s bedroom. For all\r\nthat I knew the worst might have happened in my absence. To my enormous\r\nrelief, he had improved greatly in the interval. His appearance was as\r\nghastly as ever, but all trace of delirium had left him and he spoke in\r\na feeble voice, it is true, but with even more than his usual crispness\r\nand lucidity.\r\n\r\n“Well, did you see him, Watson?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; he is coming.”\r\n\r\n“Admirable, Watson! Admirable! You are the best of messengers.”\r\n\r\n“He wished to return with me.”\r\n\r\n“That would never do, Watson. That would be obviously impossible. Did\r\nhe ask what ailed me?”\r\n\r\n“I told him about the Chinese in the East End.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly! Well, Watson, you have done all that a good friend could. You\r\ncan now disappear from the scene.”\r\n\r\n“I must wait and hear his opinion, Holmes.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you must. But I have reasons to suppose that this opinion\r\nwould be very much more frank and valuable if he imagines that we are\r\nalone. There is just room behind the head of my bed, Watson.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Holmes!”\r\n\r\n“I fear there is no alternative, Watson. The room does not lend itself\r\nto concealment, which is as well, as it is the less likely to arouse\r\nsuspicion. But just there, Watson, I fancy that it could be done.”\r\nSuddenly he sat up with a rigid intentness upon his haggard face.\r\n“There are the wheels, Watson. Quick, man, if you love me! And don’t\r\nbudge, whatever happens—whatever happens, do you hear? Don’t speak!\r\nDon’t move! Just listen with all your ears.” Then in an instant his\r\nsudden access of strength departed, and his masterful, purposeful talk\r\ndroned away into the low, vague murmurings of a semi-delirious man.\r\n\r\nFrom the hiding-place into which I had been so swiftly hustled I heard\r\nthe footfalls upon the stair, with the opening and the closing of the\r\nbedroom door. Then, to my surprise, there came a long silence, broken\r\nonly by the heavy breathings and gaspings of the sick man. I could\r\nimagine that our visitor was standing by the bedside and looking down\r\nat the sufferer. At last that strange hush was broken.\r\n\r\n“Holmes!” he cried. “Holmes!” in the insistent tone of one who awakens\r\na sleeper. “Can’t you hear me, Holmes?” There was a rustling, as if he\r\nhad shaken the sick man roughly by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Is that you, Mr. Smith?” Holmes whispered. “I hardly dared hope that\r\nyou would come.”\r\n\r\nThe other laughed.\r\n\r\n“I should imagine not,” he said. “And yet, you see, I am here. Coals of\r\nfire, Holmes—coals of fire!”\r\n\r\n“It is very good of you—very noble of you. I appreciate your special\r\nknowledge.”\r\n\r\nOur visitor sniggered.\r\n\r\n“You do. You are, fortunately, the only man in London who does. Do you\r\nknow what is the matter with you?”\r\n\r\n“The same,” said Holmes.\r\n\r\n“Ah! You recognise the symptoms?”\r\n\r\n“Only too well.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I shouldn’t be surprised, Holmes. I shouldn’t be surprised if it\r\n_were_ the same. A bad lookout for you if it is. Poor Victor was a dead\r\nman on the fourth day—a strong, hearty young fellow. It was certainly,\r\nas you said, very surprising that he should have contracted an\r\nout-of-the-way Asiatic disease in the heart of London—a disease, too,\r\nof which I had made such a very special study. Singular coincidence,\r\nHolmes. Very smart of you to notice it, but rather uncharitable to\r\nsuggest that it was cause and effect.”\r\n\r\n“I knew that you did it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you did, did you? Well, you couldn’t prove it, anyhow. But what do\r\nyou think of yourself spreading reports about me like that, and then\r\ncrawling to me for help the moment you are in trouble? What sort of a\r\ngame is that—eh?”\r\n\r\nI heard the rasping, laboured breathing of the sick man. “Give me the\r\nwater!” he gasped.\r\n\r\n“You’re precious near your end, my friend, but I don’t want you to go\r\ntill I have had a word with you. That’s why I give you water. There,\r\ndon’t slop it about! That’s right. Can you understand what I say?”\r\n\r\nHolmes groaned.\r\n\r\n“Do what you can for me. Let bygones be bygones,” he whispered. “I’ll\r\nput the words out of my head—I swear I will. Only cure me, and I’ll\r\nforget it.”\r\n\r\n“Forget what?”\r\n\r\n“Well, about Victor Savage’s death. You as good as admitted just now\r\nthat you had done it. I’ll forget it.”\r\n\r\n“You can forget it or remember it, just as you like. I don’t see you in\r\nthe witnessbox. Quite another shaped box, my good Holmes, I assure you.\r\nIt matters nothing to me that you should know how my nephew died. It’s\r\nnot him we are talking about. It’s you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes.”\r\n\r\n“The fellow who came for me—I’ve forgotten his name—said that you\r\ncontracted it down in the East End among the sailors.”\r\n\r\n“I could only account for it so.”\r\n\r\n“You are proud of your brains, Holmes, are you not? Think yourself\r\nsmart, don’t you? You came across someone who was smarter this time.\r\nNow cast your mind back, Holmes. Can you think of no other way you\r\ncould have got this thing?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t think. My mind is gone. For heaven’s sake help me!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will help you. I’ll help you to understand just where you are\r\nand how you got there. I’d like you to know before you die.”\r\n\r\n“Give me something to ease my pain.”\r\n\r\n“Painful, is it? Yes, the coolies used to do some squealing towards the\r\nend. Takes you as cramp, I fancy.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; it is cramp.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you can hear what I say, anyhow. Listen now! Can you remember\r\nany unusual incident in your life just about the time your symptoms\r\nbegan?”\r\n\r\n“No, no; nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Think again.”\r\n\r\n“I’m too ill to think.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I’ll help you. Did anything come by post?”\r\n\r\n“By post?”\r\n\r\n“A box by chance?”\r\n\r\n“I’m fainting—I’m gone!”\r\n\r\n“Listen, Holmes!” There was a sound as if he was shaking the dying man,\r\nand it was all that I could do to hold myself quiet in my hiding-place.\r\n“You must hear me. You _shall_ hear me. Do you remember a box—an ivory\r\nbox? It came on Wednesday. You opened it—do you remember?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I opened it. There was a sharp spring inside it. Some joke—”\r\n\r\n“It was no joke, as you will find to your cost. You fool, you would\r\nhave it and you have got it. Who asked you to cross my path? If you had\r\nleft me alone I would not have hurt you.”\r\n\r\n“I remember,” Holmes gasped. “The spring! It drew blood. This box—this\r\non the table.”\r\n\r\n“The very one, by George! And it may as well leave the room in my\r\npocket. There goes your last shred of evidence. But you have the truth\r\nnow, Holmes, and you can die with the knowledge that I killed you. You\r\nknew too much of the fate of Victor Savage, so I have sent you to share\r\nit. You are very near your end, Holmes. I will sit here and I will\r\nwatch you die.”\r\n\r\nHolmes’s voice had sunk to an almost inaudible whisper.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” said Smith. “Turn up the gas? Ah, the shadows begin to\r\nfall, do they? Yes, I will turn it up, that I may see you the better.”\r\nHe crossed the room and the light suddenly brightened. “Is there any\r\nother little service that I can do you, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“A match and a cigarette.”\r\n\r\nI nearly called out in my joy and my amazement. He was speaking in his\r\nnatural voice—a little weak, perhaps, but the very voice I knew. There\r\nwas a long pause, and I felt that Culverton Smith was standing in\r\nsilent amazement looking down at his companion.\r\n\r\n“What’s the meaning of this?” I heard him say at last in a dry, rasping\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n“The best way of successfully acting a part is to be it,” said Holmes.\r\n“I give you my word that for three days I have tasted neither food nor\r\ndrink until you were good enough to pour me out that glass of water.\r\nBut it is the tobacco which I find most irksome. Ah, here _are_ some\r\ncigarettes.” I heard the striking of a match. “That is very much\r\nbetter. Halloa! halloa! Do I hear the step of a friend?”\r\n\r\nThere were footfalls outside, the door opened, and Inspector Morton\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n“All is in order and this is your man,” said Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe officer gave the usual cautions.\r\n\r\n“I arrest you on the charge of the murder of one Victor Savage,” he\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\n“And you might add of the attempted murder of one Sherlock Holmes,”\r\nremarked my friend with a chuckle. “To save an invalid trouble,\r\nInspector, Mr. Culverton Smith was good enough to give our signal by\r\nturning up the gas. By the way, the prisoner has a small box in the\r\nright-hand pocket of his coat which it would be as well to remove.\r\nThank you. I would handle it gingerly if I were you. Put it down here.\r\nIt may play its part in the trial.”\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden rush and a scuffle, followed by the clash of iron\r\nand a cry of pain.\r\n\r\n“You’ll only get yourself hurt,” said the inspector. “Stand still, will\r\nyou?” There was the click of the closing handcuffs.\r\n\r\n“A nice trap!” cried the high, snarling voice. “It will bring _you_\r\ninto the dock, Holmes, not me. He asked me to come here to cure him. I\r\nwas sorry for him and I came. Now he will pretend, no doubt, that I\r\nhave said anything which he may invent which will corroborate his\r\ninsane suspicions. You can lie as you like, Holmes. My word is always\r\nas good as yours.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!” cried Holmes. “I had totally forgotten him. My dear\r\nWatson, I owe you a thousand apologies. To think that I should have\r\noverlooked you! I need not introduce you to Mr. Culverton Smith, since\r\nI understand that you met somewhat earlier in the evening. Have you the\r\ncab below? I will follow you when I am dressed, for I may be of some\r\nuse at the station.\r\n\r\n“I never needed it more,” said Holmes as he refreshed himself with a\r\nglass of claret and some biscuits in the intervals of his toilet.\r\n“However, as you know, my habits are irregular, and such a feat means\r\nless to me than to most men. It was very essential that I should\r\nimpress Mrs. Hudson with the reality of my condition, since she was to\r\nconvey it to you, and you in turn to him. You won’t be offended,\r\nWatson? You will realise that among your many talents dissimulation\r\nfinds no place, and that if you had shared my secret you would never\r\nhave been able to impress Smith with the urgent necessity of his\r\npresence, which was the vital point of the whole scheme. Knowing his\r\nvindictive nature, I was perfectly certain that he would come to look\r\nupon his handiwork.”\r\n\r\n“But your appearance, Holmes—your ghastly face?”\r\n\r\n“Three days of absolute fast does not improve one’s beauty, Watson. For\r\nthe rest, there is nothing which a sponge may not cure. With vaseline\r\nupon one’s forehead, belladonna in one’s eyes, rouge over the\r\ncheek-bones, and crusts of beeswax round one’s lips, a very satisfying\r\neffect can be produced. Malingering is a subject upon which I have\r\nsometimes thought of writing a monograph. A little occasional talk\r\nabout half-crowns, oysters, or any other extraneous subject produces a\r\npleasing effect of delirium.”\r\n\r\n“But why would you not let me near you, since there was in truth no\r\ninfection?”\r\n\r\n“Can you ask, my dear Watson? Do you imagine that I have no respect for\r\nyour medical talents? Could I fancy that your astute judgment would\r\npass a dying man who, however weak, had no rise of pulse or\r\ntemperature? At four yards, I could deceive you. If I failed to do so,\r\nwho would bring my Smith within my grasp? No, Watson, I would not touch\r\nthat box. You can just see if you look at it sideways where the sharp\r\nspring like a viper’s tooth emerges as you open it. I dare say it was\r\nby some such device that poor Savage, who stood between this monster\r\nand a reversion, was done to death. My correspondence, however, is, as\r\nyou know, a varied one, and I am somewhat upon my guard against any\r\npackages which reach me. It was clear to me, however, that by\r\npretending that he had really succeeded in his design I might surprise\r\na confession. That pretence I have carried out with the thoroughness of\r\nthe true artist. Thank you, Watson, you must help me on with my coat.\r\nWhen we have finished at the police-station I think that something\r\nnutritious at Simpson’s would not be out of place.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Last Bow: The War Service of Sherlock Holmes\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nine o’clock at night upon the second of August—the most\r\nterrible August in the history of the world. One might have thought\r\nalready that God’s curse hung heavy over a degenerate world, for there\r\nwas an awesome hush and a feeling of vague expectancy in the sultry and\r\nstagnant air. The sun had long set, but one blood-red gash like an open\r\nwound lay low in the distant west. Above, the stars were shining\r\nbrightly, and below, the lights of the shipping glimmered in the bay.\r\nThe two famous Germans stood beside the stone parapet of the garden\r\nwalk, with the long, low, heavily gabled house behind them, and they\r\nlooked down upon the broad sweep of the beach at the foot of the great\r\nchalk cliff in which Von Bork, like some wandering eagle, had perched\r\nhimself four years before. They stood with their heads close together,\r\ntalking in low, confidential tones. From below the two glowing ends of\r\ntheir cigars might have been the smouldering eyes of some malignant\r\nfiend looking down in the darkness.\r\n\r\nA remarkable man this Von Bork—a man who could hardly be matched among\r\nall the devoted agents of the Kaiser. It was his talents which had\r\nfirst recommended him for the English mission, the most important\r\nmission of all, but since he had taken it over those talents had become\r\nmore and more manifest to the half-dozen people in the world who were\r\nreally in touch with the truth. One of these was his present companion,\r\nBaron Von Herling, the chief secretary of the legation, whose huge\r\n100-horse-power Benz car was blocking the country lane as it waited to\r\nwaft its owner back to London.\r\n\r\n“So far as I can judge the trend of events, you will probably be back\r\nin Berlin within the week,” the secretary was saying. “When you get\r\nthere, my dear Von Bork, I think you will be surprised at the welcome\r\nyou will receive. I happen to know what is thought in the highest\r\nquarters of your work in this country.” He was a huge man, the\r\nsecretary, deep, broad, and tall, with a slow, heavy fashion of speech\r\nwhich had been his main asset in his political career.\r\n\r\nVon Bork laughed.\r\n\r\n“They are not very hard to deceive,” he remarked. “A more docile,\r\nsimple folk could not be imagined.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about that,” said the other thoughtfully. “They have\r\nstrange limits and one must learn to observe them. It is that surface\r\nsimplicity of theirs which makes a trap for the stranger. One’s first\r\nimpression is that they are entirely soft. Then one comes suddenly upon\r\nsomething very hard, and you know that you have reached the limit and\r\nmust adapt yourself to the fact. They have, for example, their insular\r\nconventions which simply _must_ be observed.”\r\n\r\n“Meaning ‘good form’ and that sort of thing?” Von Bork sighed as one\r\nwho had suffered much.\r\n\r\n“Meaning British prejudice in all its queer manifestations. As an\r\nexample I may quote one of my own worst blunders—I can afford to talk\r\nof my blunders, for you know my work well enough to be aware of my\r\nsuccesses. It was on my first arrival. I was invited to a week-end\r\ngathering at the country house of a cabinet minister. The conversation\r\nwas amazingly indiscreet.”\r\n\r\nVon Bork nodded. “I’ve been there,” said he dryly.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. Well, I naturally sent a résumé of the information to Berlin.\r\nUnfortunately our good chancellor is a little heavy-handed in these\r\nmatters, and he transmitted a remark which showed that he was aware of\r\nwhat had been said. This, of course, took the trail straight up to me.\r\nYou’ve no idea the harm that it did me. There was nothing soft about\r\nour British hosts on that occasion, I can assure you. I was two years\r\nliving it down. Now you, with this sporting pose of yours—”\r\n\r\n“No, no, don’t call it a pose. A pose is an artificial thing. This is\r\nquite natural. I am a born sportsman. I enjoy it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that makes it the more effective. You yacht against them, you\r\nhunt with them, you play polo, you match them in every game, your\r\nfour-in-hand takes the prize at Olympia. I have even heard that you go\r\nthe length of boxing with the young officers. What is the result?\r\nNobody takes you seriously. You are a ‘good old sport’ ‘quite a decent\r\nfellow for a German,’ a hard-drinking, night-club, knock-about-town,\r\ndevil-may-care young fellow. And all the time this quiet country house\r\nof yours is the centre of half the mischief in England, and the\r\nsporting squire the most astute secret-service man in Europe. Genius,\r\nmy dear Von Bork—genius!”\r\n\r\n“You flatter me, Baron. But certainly I may claim my four years in this\r\ncountry have not been unproductive. I’ve never shown you my little\r\nstore. Would you mind stepping in for a moment?”\r\n\r\nThe door of the study opened straight on to the terrace. Von Bork\r\npushed it back, and, leading the way, he clicked the switch of the\r\nelectric light. He then closed the door behind the bulky form which\r\nfollowed him and carefully adjusted the heavy curtain over the latticed\r\nwindow. Only when all these precautions had been taken and tested did\r\nhe turn his sunburned aquiline face to his guest.\r\n\r\n“Some of my papers have gone,” said he. “When my wife and the household\r\nleft yesterday for Flushing they took the less important with them. I\r\nmust, of course, claim the protection of the embassy for the others.”\r\n\r\n“Your name has already been filed as one of the personal suite. There\r\nwill be no difficulties for you or your baggage. Of course, it is just\r\npossible that we may not have to go. England may leave France to her\r\nfate. We are sure that there is no binding treaty between them.”\r\n\r\n“And Belgium?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and Belgium, too.”\r\n\r\nVon Bork shook his head. “I don’t see how that could be. There is a\r\ndefinite treaty there. She could never recover from such a\r\nhumiliation.”\r\n\r\n“She would at least have peace for the moment.”\r\n\r\n“But her honour?”\r\n\r\n“Tut, my dear sir, we live in a utilitarian age. Honour is a mediæval\r\nconception. Besides England is not ready. It is an inconceivable thing,\r\nbut even our special war tax of fifty million, which one would think\r\nmade our purpose as clear as if we had advertised it on the front page\r\nof the _Times_, has not roused these people from their slumbers. Here\r\nand there one hears a question. It is my business to find an answer.\r\nHere and there also there is an irritation. It is my business to soothe\r\nit. But I can assure you that so far as the essentials go—the storage\r\nof munitions, the preparation for submarine attack, the arrangements\r\nfor making high explosives—nothing is prepared. How, then, can England\r\ncome in, especially when we have stirred her up such a devil’s brew of\r\nIrish civil war, window-breaking Furies, and God knows what to keep her\r\nthoughts at home.”\r\n\r\n“She must think of her future.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that is another matter. I fancy that in the future we have our own\r\nvery definite plans about England, and that your information will be\r\nvery vital to us. It is to-day or to-morrow with Mr. John Bull. If he\r\nprefers to-day we are perfectly ready. If it is to-morrow we shall be\r\nmore ready still. I should think they would be wiser to fight with\r\nallies than without them, but that is their own affair. This week is\r\ntheir week of destiny. But you were speaking of your papers.” He sat in\r\nthe armchair with the light shining upon his broad bald head, while he\r\npuffed sedately at his cigar.\r\n\r\nThe large oak-panelled, book-lined room had a curtain hung in the\r\nfurther corner. When this was drawn it disclosed a large, brass-bound\r\nsafe. Von Bork detached a small key from his watch chain, and after\r\nsome considerable manipulation of the lock he swung open the heavy\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n“Look!” said he, standing clear, with a wave of his hand.\r\n\r\nThe light shone vividly into the opened safe, and the secretary of the\r\nembassy gazed with an absorbed interest at the rows of stuffed\r\npigeon-holes with which it was furnished. Each pigeon-hole had its\r\nlabel, and his eyes as he glanced along them read a long series of such\r\ntitles as “Fords,” “Harbour-defences,” “Aeroplanes,” “Ireland,”\r\n“Egypt,” “Portsmouth forts,” “The Channel,” “Rosythe,” and a score of\r\nothers. Each compartment was bristling with papers and plans.\r\n\r\n“Colossal!” said the secretary. Putting down his cigar he softly\r\nclapped his fat hands.\r\n\r\n“And all in four years, Baron. Not such a bad show for the\r\nhard-drinking, hard-riding country squire. But the gem of my collection\r\nis coming and there is the setting all ready for it.” He pointed to a\r\nspace over which “Naval Signals” was printed.\r\n\r\n“But you have a good dossier there already.”\r\n\r\n“Out of date and waste paper. The Admiralty in some way got the alarm\r\nand every code has been changed. It was a blow, Baron—the worst setback\r\nin my whole campaign. But thanks to my check-book and the good Altamont\r\nall will be well to-night.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron looked at his watch and gave a guttural exclamation of\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n“Well, I really can wait no longer. You can imagine that things are\r\nmoving at present in Carlton Terrace and that we have all to be at our\r\nposts. I had hoped to be able to bring news of your great coup. Did\r\nAltamont name no hour?”\r\n\r\nVon Bork pushed over a telegram.\r\n\r\nWill come without fail to-night and bring new sparking plugs.—ALTAMONT.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sparking plugs, eh?”\r\n\r\n“You see he poses as a motor expert and I keep a full garage. In our\r\ncode everything likely to come up is named after some spare part. If he\r\ntalks of a radiator it is a battleship, of an oil pump a cruiser, and\r\nso on. Sparking plugs are naval signals.”\r\n\r\n“From Portsmouth at midday,” said the secretary, examining the\r\nsuperscription. “By the way, what do you give him?”\r\n\r\n“Five hundred pounds for this particular job. Of course he has a salary\r\nas well.”\r\n\r\n“The greedy rogue. They are useful, these traitors, but I grudge them\r\ntheir blood money.”\r\n\r\n“I grudge Altamont nothing. He is a wonderful worker. If I pay him\r\nwell, at least he delivers the goods, to use his own phrase. Besides he\r\nis not a traitor. I assure you that our most pan-Germanic Junker is a\r\nsucking dove in his feelings towards England as compared with a real\r\nbitter Irish-American.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, an Irish-American?”\r\n\r\n“If you heard him talk you would not doubt it. Sometimes I assure you I\r\ncan hardly understand him. He seems to have declared war on the King’s\r\nEnglish as well as on the English king. Must you really go? He may be\r\nhere any moment.”\r\n\r\n“No. I’m sorry, but I have already overstayed my time. We shall expect\r\nyou early to-morrow, and when you get that signal book through the\r\nlittle door on the Duke of York’s steps you can put a triumphant Finis\r\nto your record in England. What! Tokay!” He indicated a heavily sealed\r\ndust-covered bottle which stood with two high glasses upon a salver.\r\n\r\n“May I offer you a glass before your journey?”\r\n\r\n“No, thanks. But it looks like revelry.”\r\n\r\n“Altamont has a nice taste in wines, and he took a fancy to my Tokay.\r\nHe is a touchy fellow and needs humouring in small things. I have to\r\nstudy him, I assure you.” They had strolled out on to the terrace\r\nagain, and along it to the further end where at a touch from the\r\nBaron’s chauffeur the great car shivered and chuckled. “Those are the\r\nlights of Harwich, I suppose,” said the secretary, pulling on his dust\r\ncoat. “How still and peaceful it all seems. There may be other lights\r\nwithin the week, and the English coast a less tranquil place! The\r\nheavens, too, may not be quite so peaceful if all that the good Zepplin\r\npromises us comes true. By the way, who is that?”\r\n\r\nOnly one window showed a light behind them; in it there stood a lamp,\r\nand beside it, seated at a table, was a dear old ruddy-faced woman in a\r\ncountry cap. She was bending over her knitting and stopping\r\noccasionally to stroke a large black cat upon a stool beside her.\r\n\r\n“That is Martha, the only servant I have left.”\r\n\r\nThe secretary chuckled.\r\n\r\n“She might almost personify Britannia,” said he, “with her complete\r\nself-absorption and general air of comfortable somnolence. Well, au\r\nrevoir, Von Bork!” With a final wave of his hand he sprang into the\r\ncar, and a moment later the two golden cones from the headlights shot\r\nthrough the darkness. The secretary lay back in the cushions of the\r\nluxurious limousine, with his thoughts so full of the impending\r\nEuropean tragedy that he hardly observed that as his car swung round\r\nthe village street it nearly passed over a little Ford coming in the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nVon Bork walked slowly back to the study when the last gleams of the\r\nmotor lamps had faded into the distance. As he passed he observed that\r\nhis old housekeeper had put out her lamp and retired. It was a new\r\nexperience to him, the silence and darkness of his widespread house,\r\nfor his family and household had been a large one. It was a relief to\r\nhim, however, to think that they were all in safety and that, but for\r\nthat one old woman who had lingered in the kitchen, he had the whole\r\nplace to himself. There was a good deal of tidying up to do inside his\r\nstudy and he set himself to do it until his keen, handsome face was\r\nflushed with the heat of the burning papers. A leather valise stood\r\nbeside his table, and into this he began to pack very neatly and\r\nsystematically the precious contents of his safe. He had hardly got\r\nstarted with the work, however, when his quick ears caught the sounds\r\nof a distant car. Instantly he gave an exclamation of satisfaction,\r\nstrapped up the valise, shut the safe, locked it, and hurried out on to\r\nthe terrace. He was just in time to see the lights of a small car come\r\nto a halt at the gate. A passenger sprang out of it and advanced\r\nswiftly towards him, while the chauffeur, a heavily built, elderly man\r\nwith a grey moustache, settled down like one who resigns himself to a\r\nlong vigil.\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Von Bork eagerly, running forward to meet his visitor.\r\n\r\nFor answer the man waved a small brown-paper parcel triumphantly above\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n“You can give me the glad hand to-night, mister,” he cried. “I’m\r\nbringing home the bacon at last.”\r\n\r\n“The signals?”\r\n\r\n“Same as I said in my cable. Every last one of them, semaphore, lamp\r\ncode, Marconi—a copy, mind you, not the original. That was too\r\ndangerous. But it’s the real goods, and you can lay to that.” He\r\nslapped the German upon the shoulder with a rough familiarity from\r\nwhich the other winced.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” he said. “I’m all alone in the house. I was only waiting for\r\nthis. Of course a copy is better than the original. If an original were\r\nmissing they would change the whole thing. You think it’s all safe\r\nabout the copy?”\r\n\r\nThe Irish-American had entered the study and stretched his long limbs\r\nfrom the armchair. He was a tall, gaunt man of sixty, with clear-cut\r\nfeatures and a small goatee beard which gave him a general resemblance\r\nto the caricatures of Uncle Sam. A half-smoked, sodden cigar hung from\r\nthe corner of his mouth, and as he sat down he struck a match and relit\r\nit. “Making ready for a move?” he remarked as he looked round him.\r\n“Say, mister,” he added, as his eyes fell upon the safe from which the\r\ncurtain was now removed, “you don’t tell me you keep your papers in\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Gosh, in a wide-open contraption like that! And they reckon you to be\r\nsome spy. Why, a Yankee crook would be into that with a can-opener. If\r\nI’d known that any letter of mine was goin’ to lie loose in a thing\r\nlike that I’d have been a mug to write to you at all.”\r\n\r\n“It would puzzle any crook to force that safe,” Von Bork answered. “You\r\nwon’t cut that metal with any tool.”\r\n\r\n“But the lock?”\r\n\r\n“No, it’s a double combination lock. You know what that is?”\r\n\r\n“Search me,” said the American.\r\n\r\n“Well, you need a word as well as a set of figures before you can get\r\nthe lock to work.” He rose and showed a double-radiating disc round the\r\nkeyhole. “This outer one is for the letters, the inner one for the\r\nfigures.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, that’s fine.”\r\n\r\n“So it’s not quite as simple as you thought. It was four years ago that\r\nI had it made, and what do you think I chose for the word and figures?”\r\n\r\n“It’s beyond me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I chose August for the word, and 1914 for the figures, and here\r\nwe are.”\r\n\r\nThe American’s face showed his surprise and admiration.\r\n\r\n“My, but that was smart! You had it down to a fine thing.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a few of us even then could have guessed the date. Here it is,\r\nand I’m shutting down to-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I guess you’ll have to fix me up also. I’m not staying in this\r\ngoldarned country all on my lonesome. In a week or less, from what I\r\nsee, John Bull will be on his hind legs and fair ramping. I’d rather\r\nwatch him from over the water.”\r\n\r\n“But you’re an American citizen?”\r\n\r\n“Well, so was Jack James an American citizen, but he’s doing time in\r\nPortland all the same. It cuts no ice with a British copper to tell him\r\nyou’re an American citizen. ‘It’s British law and order over here,’\r\nsays he. By the way, mister, talking of Jack James, it seems to me you\r\ndon’t do much to cover your men.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” Von Bork asked sharply.\r\n\r\n“Well, you are their employer, ain’t you? It’s up to you to see that\r\nthey don’t fall down. But they do fall down, and when did you ever pick\r\nthem up? There’s James—”\r\n\r\n“It was James’s own fault. You know that yourself. He was too\r\nself-willed for the job.”\r\n\r\n“James was a bonehead—I give you that. Then there was Hollis.”\r\n\r\n“The man was mad.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he went a bit woozy towards the end. It’s enough to make a man\r\nbug-house when he has to play a part from morning to night with a\r\nhundred guys all ready to set the coppers wise to him. But now there is\r\nSteiner—”\r\n\r\nVon Bork started violently, and his ruddy face turned a shade paler.\r\n\r\n“What about Steiner?”\r\n\r\n“Well, they’ve got him, that’s all. They raided his store last night,\r\nand he and his papers are all in Portsmouth jail. You’ll go off and he,\r\npoor devil, will have to stand the racket, and lucky if he gets off\r\nwith his life. That’s why I want to get over the water as soon as you\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\nVon Bork was a strong, self-contained man, but it was easy to see that\r\nthe news had shaken him.\r\n\r\n“How could they have got on to Steiner?” he muttered. “That’s the worst\r\nblow yet.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you nearly had a worse one, for I believe they are not far off\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean that!”\r\n\r\n“Sure thing. My landlady down Fratton way had some inquiries, and when\r\nI heard of it I guessed it was time for me to hustle. But what I want\r\nto know, mister, is how the coppers know these things? Steiner is the\r\nfifth man you’ve lost since I signed on with you, and I know the name\r\nof the sixth if I don’t get a move on. How do you explain it, and ain’t\r\nyou ashamed to see your men go down like this?”\r\n\r\nVon Bork flushed crimson.\r\n\r\n“How dare you speak in such a way!”\r\n\r\n“If I didn’t dare things, mister, I wouldn’t be in your service. But\r\nI’ll tell you straight what is in my mind. I’ve heard that with you\r\nGerman politicians when an agent has done his work you are not sorry to\r\nsee him put away.”\r\n\r\nVon Bork sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Do you dare to suggest that I have given away my own agents!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t stand for that, mister, but there’s a stool pigeon or a cross\r\nsomewhere, and it’s up to you to find out where it is. Anyhow I am\r\ntaking no more chances. It’s me for little Holland, and the sooner the\r\nbetter.”\r\n\r\nVon Bork had mastered his anger.\r\n\r\n“We have been allies too long to quarrel now at the very hour of\r\nvictory,” he said. “You’ve done splendid work and taken risks, and I\r\ncan’t forget it. By all means go to Holland, and you can get a boat\r\nfrom Rotterdam to New York. No other line will be safe a week from now.\r\nI’ll take that book and pack it with the rest.”\r\n\r\nThe American held the small parcel in his hand, but made no motion to\r\ngive it up.\r\n\r\n“What about the dough?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“The what?”\r\n\r\n“The boodle. The reward. The £500. The gunner turned damned nasty at\r\nthe last, and I had to square him with an extra hundred dollars or it\r\nwould have been nitsky for you and me. ‘Nothin’ doin’!’ says he, and he\r\nmeant it, too, but the last hundred did it. It’s cost me two hundred\r\npound from first to last, so it isn’t likely I’d give it up without\r\ngettin’ my wad.”\r\n\r\nVon Bork smiled with some bitterness. “You don’t seem to have a very\r\nhigh opinion of my honour,” said he, “you want the money before you\r\ngive up the book.”\r\n\r\n“Well, mister, it is a business proposition.”\r\n\r\n“All right. Have your way.” He sat down at the table and scribbled a\r\ncheck, which he tore from the book, but he refrained from handing it to\r\nhis companion. “After all, since we are to be on such terms, Mr.\r\nAltamont,” said he, “I don’t see why I should trust you any more than\r\nyou trust me. Do you understand?” he added, looking back over his\r\nshoulder at the American. “There’s the check upon the table. I claim\r\nthe right to examine that parcel before you pick the money up.”\r\n\r\nThe American passed it over without a word. Von Bork undid a winding of\r\nstring and two wrappers of paper. Then he sat gazing for a moment in\r\nsilent amazement at a small blue book which lay before him. Across the\r\ncover was printed in golden letters _Practical Handbook of Bee\r\nCulture_. Only for one instant did the master spy glare at this\r\nstrangely irrelevant inscription. The next he was gripped at the back\r\nof his neck by a grasp of iron, and a chloroformed sponge was held in\r\nfront of his writhing face.\r\n\r\n“Another glass, Watson!” said Mr. Sherlock Holmes as he extended the\r\nbottle of Imperial Tokay.\r\n\r\nThe thickset chauffeur, who had seated himself by the table, pushed\r\nforward his glass with some eagerness.\r\n\r\n“It is a good wine, Holmes.”\r\n\r\n“A remarkable wine, Watson. Our friend upon the sofa has assured me\r\nthat it is from Franz Josef’s special cellar at the Schoenbrunn Palace.\r\nMight I trouble you to open the window, for chloroform vapour does not\r\nhelp the palate.”\r\n\r\nThe safe was ajar, and Holmes standing in front of it was removing\r\ndossier after dossier, swiftly examining each, and then packing it\r\nneatly in Von Bork’s valise. The German lay upon the sofa sleeping\r\nstertorously with a strap round his upper arms and another round his\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\n“We need not hurry ourselves, Watson. We are safe from interruption.\r\nWould you mind touching the bell? There is no one in the house except\r\nold Martha, who has played her part to admiration. I got her the\r\nsituation here when first I took the matter up. Ah, Martha, you will be\r\nglad to hear that all is well.”\r\n\r\nThe pleasant old lady had appeared in the doorway. She curtseyed with a\r\nsmile to Mr. Holmes, but glanced with some apprehension at the figure\r\nupon the sofa.\r\n\r\n“It is all right, Martha. He has not been hurt at all.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad of that, Mr. Holmes. According to his lights he has been a\r\nkind master. He wanted me to go with his wife to Germany yesterday, but\r\nthat would hardly have suited your plans, would it, sir?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed, Martha. So long as you were here I was easy in my mind. We\r\nwaited some time for your signal to-night.”\r\n\r\n“It was the secretary, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I know. His car passed ours.”\r\n\r\n“I thought he would never go. I knew that it would not suit your plans,\r\nsir, to find him here.”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed. Well, it only meant that we waited half an hour or so\r\nuntil I saw your lamp go out and knew that the coast was clear. You can\r\nreport to me to-morrow in London, Martha, at Claridge’s Hotel.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you have everything ready to leave.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. He posted seven letters to-day. I have the addresses as\r\nusual.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, Martha. I will look into them to-morrow. Good-night. These\r\npapers,” he continued as the old lady vanished, “are not of very great\r\nimportance, for, of course, the information which they represent has\r\nbeen sent off long ago to the German government. These are the\r\noriginals which could not safely be got out of the country.”\r\n\r\n“Then they are of no use.”\r\n\r\n“I should not go so far as to say that, Watson. They will at least show\r\nour people what is known and what is not. I may say that a good many of\r\nthese papers have come through me, and I need not add are thoroughly\r\nuntrustworthy. It would brighten my declining years to see a German\r\ncruiser navigating the Solent according to the mine-field plans which I\r\nhave furnished. But you, Watson”—he stopped his work and took his old\r\nfriend by the shoulders—“I’ve hardly seen you in the light yet. How\r\nhave the years used you? You look the same blithe boy as ever.”\r\n\r\n“I feel twenty years younger, Holmes. I have seldom felt so happy as\r\nwhen I got your wire asking me to meet you at Harwich with the car. But\r\nyou, Holmes—you have changed very little—save for that horrible\r\ngoatee.”\r\n\r\n“These are the sacrifices one makes for one’s country, Watson,” said\r\nHolmes, pulling at his little tuft. “To-morrow it will be but a\r\ndreadful memory. With my hair cut and a few other superficial changes I\r\nshall no doubt reappear at Claridge’s to-morrow as I was before this\r\nAmerican stunt—I beg your pardon, Watson, my well of English seems to\r\nbe permanently defiled—before this American job came my way.”\r\n\r\n“But you have retired, Holmes. We heard of you as living the life of a\r\nhermit among your bees and your books in a small farm upon the South\r\nDowns.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly, Watson. Here is the fruit of my leisured ease, the magnum\r\nopus of my latter years!” He picked up the volume from the table and\r\nread out the whole title, _Practical Handbook of Bee Culture, with Some\r\nObservations upon the Segregation of the Queen_. “Alone I did it.\r\nBehold the fruit of pensive nights and laborious days when I watched\r\nthe little working gangs as once I watched the criminal world of\r\nLondon.”\r\n\r\n“But how did you get to work again?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I have often marvelled at it myself. The Foreign Minister alone I\r\ncould have withstood, but when the Premier also deigned to visit my\r\nhumble roof—! The fact is, Watson, that this gentleman upon the sofa\r\nwas a bit too good for our people. He was in a class by himself. Things\r\nwere going wrong, and no one could understand why they were going\r\nwrong. Agents were suspected or even caught, but there was evidence of\r\nsome strong and secret central force. It was absolutely necessary to\r\nexpose it. Strong pressure was brought upon me to look into the matter.\r\nIt has cost me two years, Watson, but they have not been devoid of\r\nexcitement. When I say that I started my pilgrimage at Chicago,\r\ngraduated in an Irish secret society at Buffalo, gave serious trouble\r\nto the constabulary at Skibbareen, and so eventually caught the eye of\r\na subordinate agent of Von Bork, who recommended me as a likely man,\r\nyou will realise that the matter was complex. Since then I have been\r\nhonoured by his confidence, which has not prevented most of his plans\r\ngoing subtly wrong and five of his best agents being in prison. I\r\nwatched them, Watson, and I picked them as they ripened. Well, sir, I\r\nhope that you are none the worse!”\r\n\r\nThe last remark was addressed to Von Bork himself, who after much\r\ngasping and blinking had lain quietly listening to Holmes’s statement.\r\nHe broke out now into a furious stream of German invective, his face\r\nconvulsed with passion. Holmes continued his swift investigation of\r\ndocuments while his prisoner cursed and swore.\r\n\r\n“Though unmusical, German is the most expressive of all languages,” he\r\nobserved when Von Bork had stopped from pure exhaustion. “Hullo!\r\nHullo!” he added as he looked hard at the corner of a tracing before\r\nputting it in the box. “This should put another bird in the cage. I had\r\nno idea that the paymaster was such a rascal, though I have long had an\r\neye upon him. Mister Von Bork, you have a great deal to answer for.”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner had raised himself with some difficulty upon the sofa and\r\nwas staring with a strange mixture of amazement and hatred at his\r\ncaptor.\r\n\r\n“I shall get level with you, Altamont,” he said, speaking with slow\r\ndeliberation. “If it takes me all my life I shall get level with you!”\r\n\r\n“The old sweet song,” said Holmes. “How often have I heard it in days\r\ngone by. It was a favorite ditty of the late lamented Professor\r\nMoriarty. Colonel Sebastian Moran has also been known to warble it. And\r\nyet I live and keep bees upon the South Downs.”\r\n\r\n“Curse you, you double traitor!” cried the German, straining against\r\nhis bonds and glaring murder from his furious eyes.\r\n\r\n“No, no, it is not so bad as that,” said Holmes, smiling. “As my speech\r\nsurely shows you, Mr. Altamont of Chicago had no existence in fact. I\r\nused him and he is gone.”\r\n\r\n“Then who are you?”\r\n\r\n“It is really immaterial who I am, but since the matter seems to\r\ninterest you, Mr. Von Bork, I may say that this is not my first\r\nacquaintance with the members of your family. I have done a good deal\r\nof business in Germany in the past and my name is probably familiar to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I would wish to know it,” said the Prussian grimly.\r\n\r\n“It was I who brought about the separation between Irene Adler and the\r\nlate King of Bohemia when your cousin Heinrich was the Imperial Envoy.\r\nIt was I also who saved from murder, by the Nihilist Klopman, Count Von\r\nund Zu Grafenstein, who was your mother’s elder brother. It was I—”\r\n\r\nVon Bork sat up in amazement.\r\n\r\n“There is only one man,” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Holmes.\r\n\r\nVon Bork groaned and sank back on the sofa. “And most of that\r\ninformation came through you,” he cried. “What is it worth? What have I\r\ndone? It is my ruin forever!”\r\n\r\n“It is certainly a little untrustworthy,” said Holmes. “It will require\r\nsome checking and you have little time to check it. Your admiral may\r\nfind the new guns rather larger than he expects, and the cruisers\r\nperhaps a trifle faster.”\r\n\r\nVon Bork clutched at his own throat in despair.\r\n\r\n“There are a good many other points of detail which will, no doubt,\r\ncome to light in good time. But you have one quality which is very rare\r\nin a German, Mr. Von Bork: you are a sportsman and you will bear me no\r\nill-will when you realise that you, who have outwitted so many other\r\npeople, have at last been outwitted yourself. After all, you have done\r\nyour best for your country, and I have done my best for mine, and what\r\ncould be more natural? Besides,” he added, not unkindly, as he laid his\r\nhand upon the shoulder of the prostrate man, “it is better than to fall\r\nbefore some ignoble foe. These papers are now ready, Watson. If you\r\nwill help me with our prisoner, I think that we may get started for\r\nLondon at once.”\r\n\r\nIt was no easy task to move Von Bork, for he was a strong and a\r\ndesperate man. Finally, holding either arm, the two friends walked him\r\nvery slowly down the garden walk which he had trod with such proud\r\nconfidence when he received the congratulations of the famous\r\ndiplomatist only a few hours before. After a short, final struggle he\r\nwas hoisted, still bound hand and foot, into the spare seat of the\r\nlittle car. His precious valise was wedged in beside him.\r\n\r\n“I trust that you are as comfortable as circumstances permit,” said\r\nHolmes when the final arrangements were made. “Should I be guilty of a\r\nliberty if I lit a cigar and placed it between your lips?”\r\n\r\nBut all amenities were wasted upon the angry German.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you realise, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said he, “that if your\r\ngovernment bears you out in this treatment it becomes an act of war.”\r\n\r\n“What about your government and all this treatment?” said Holmes,\r\ntapping the valise.\r\n\r\n“You are a private individual. You have no warrant for my arrest. The\r\nwhole proceeding is absolutely illegal and outrageous.”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely,” said Holmes.\r\n\r\n“Kidnapping a German subject.”\r\n\r\n“And stealing his private papers.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you realise your position, you and your accomplice here. If I\r\nwere to shout for help as we pass through the village—”\r\n\r\n“My dear sir, if you did anything so foolish you would probably enlarge\r\nthe two limited titles of our village inns by giving us ‘The Dangling\r\nPrussian’ as a signpost. The Englishman is a patient creature, but at\r\npresent his temper is a little inflamed, and it would be as well not to\r\ntry him too far. No, Mr. Von Bork, you will go with us in a quiet,\r\nsensible fashion to Scotland Yard, whence you can send for your friend,\r\nBaron Von Herling, and see if even now you may not fill that place\r\nwhich he has reserved for you in the ambassadorial suite. As to you,\r\nWatson, you are joining us with your old service, as I understand, so\r\nLondon won’t be out of your way. Stand with me here upon the terrace,\r\nfor it may be the last quiet talk that we shall ever have.”\r\n\r\nThe two friends chatted in intimate converse for a few minutes,\r\nrecalling once again the days of the past, while their prisoner vainly\r\nwriggled to undo the bonds that held him. As they turned to the car\r\nHolmes pointed back to the moonlit sea and shook a thoughtful head.\r\n\r\n“There’s an east wind coming, Watson.”\r\n\r\n“I think not, Holmes. It is very warm.”\r\n\r\n“Good old Watson! You are the one fixed point in a changing age.\r\nThere’s an east wind coming all the same, such a wind as never blew on\r\nEngland yet. It will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a good many of us\r\nmay wither before its blast. But it’s God’s own wind none the less, and\r\na cleaner, better, stronger land will lie in the sunshine when the\r\nstorm has cleared. Start her up, Watson, for it’s time that we were on\r\nour way. I have a check for five hundred pounds which should be cashed\r\nearly, for the drawer is quite capable of stopping it if he can.”",
