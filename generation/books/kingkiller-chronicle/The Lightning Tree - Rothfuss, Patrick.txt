THE LIGHTNING TREE

Patrick Rothfuss

Morning: The Narrow Road

Bast almost made it out the back door of

the Waystone Inn.

He actually had made it outside, both

feet were over the threshold and the door

was almost entirely eased shut behind

him before he heard his master’s voice.

Bast paused, hand on the latch. He

frowned at the door, hardly a handspan

from being closed. He hadn’t made any

noise. He knew it. He was familiar with

all the silent pieces of the inn, which

floorboards sighed beneath a foot, which

windows stuck …

The back door’s hinges creaked

sometimes, depending on their mood, but

that was easy to work around. Bast

shifted his grip on the latch, lifted up so

that the door’s weight didn’t hang so

heavy, then eased it slowly closed. No

creak. The swinging door was softer than

a sigh.

Bast stood upright and grinned. His

face was sweet and sly and wild. He

looked like a naughty child who had

managed to steal the moon and eat it. His

smile was like the last sliver of

remaining moon, sharp and white and

dangerous.

“Bast!” The call came again, louder

this time. Nothing so crass as a shout, his

master would never stoop to bellowing.

But when he wanted to be heard, his

baritone would not be stopped by

anything so insubstantial as an oaken

door. His voice carried like a horn, and

Bast felt his name tug at him like a hand

around his heart.

Bast sighed, then opened the door

lightly and strode back inside. He was

dark, and tall, and lovely. When he

walked he looked like he was dancing.

“Yes, Reshi?” he called.

After a moment the innkeeper stepped

into the kitchen; he wore a clean white

apron and his hair was red. Other than

that, he was painfully unremarkable. His

face held the doughy placidness of bored

innkeepers everywhere. Despite the early

hour, he looked tired.

He handed Bast a leather book. “You

almost forgot this,” he said without a hint

of sarcasm.

Bast took the book and made a show of

looking surprised. “Oh! Thank you,

Reshi!”

The innkeeper shrugged and his mouth

made the shape of a smile. “No bother,

Bast. While you’re out on your errands,

would you mind picking up some eggs?”

Bast nodded, tucking the book under his

arm. “Anything else?” he asked dutifully.

“Maybe some carrots too. I’m thinking

we’ll do stew tonight. It’s Felling, so

we’ll need to be ready for a crowd.” His

mouth turned up slightly at one corner as

he said this.

The innkeeper started to turn away, then

stopped. “Oh. The Williams boy stopped

by last night, looking for you. Didn’t

leave any sort of message.” He raised an

eyebrow at Bast. The look said more

than it said.

“I haven’t the slightest idea what he

wants,” Bast said.

The innkeeper made a noncommittal

noise and turned back toward the

common room.

Before he’d taken three steps Bast was

already out the door and running through

the early-morning sunlight.

By the time Bast arrived, there were

already two children waiting. They

played on the huge greystone that lay

half-fallen at the bottom of the hill,

climbing up the tilting side of it, then

jumping down into the tall grass.

Knowing they were watching, Bast took

his time climbing the tiny hill. At the top

stood what the children called the

lightning tree, though these days it was

little more than a branchless trunk barely

taller than a man. All the bark had long

since fallen away, and the sun had

bleached the wood as white as bone. All

except the very top, where even after all

these years the wood was charred a

jagged black.

Bast touched the trunk with his

fingertips and made a slow circuit of the

tree. He went deasil, the same direction

as the turning sun. The proper way for

making. Then he turned and switched

hands, making three slow circles

widdershins. That turning was against the

world. It was the way of breaking. Back

and forth he went, as if the tree were a

bobbin and he was winding and

unwinding.

Finally he sat with his back against the

tree and set the book on a nearby stone.

The sun shone on the gold gilt letters,

Celum Tinture. Then he amused himself

by tossing stones into the nearby stream

that cut into the low slope of the hill

opposite the greystone.

After a minute, a round little blond boy

trudged up the hill. He was the baker’s

youngest son, Brann. He smelled of

sweat and fresh bread and … something

else. Something out of place.

The boy’s slow approach had an air of

ritual about it. He crested the small hill

and stood there for a moment quietly, the

only noise coming from the other two

children playing below.

Finally Bast turned to look the boy

over. He was no more than eight or nine,

well dressed, and plumper than most of

the other town’s children. He carried a

wad of white cloth in his hand.

The boy swallowed nervously. “I need

a lie.”

Bast nodded. “What sort of lie?”

The boy gingerly opened his hand,

revealing the wad of cloth to be a

makeshift bandage, spattered with bright

red. It stuck to his hand slightly. Bast

nodded; that was what he’d smelled

before.

“I was playing with my mum’s knives,”

Brann said.

Bast examined the cut. It ran shallow

along the meat near the thumb. Nothing

serious. “Hurt much?”

“Nothing like the birching I’ll get if she

finds out I was messing with her knives.”

Bast nodded sympathetically. “You

clean the knife and put it back?”

Brann nodded.

Bast tapped his lips thoughtfully. “You

thought you saw a big black rat. It scared

you. You threw a knife at it and cut

yourself. Yesterday one of the other

children told you a story about rats

chewing off soldier’s ears and toes while

they slept. It gave you nightmares.”

Brann gave a shudder. “Who told me

the story?”

Bast shrugged. “Pick someone you

don’t like.”

The boy grinned viciously.

Bast began to tick off things on his

fingers. “Get some blood on the knife

before you throw it.” He pointed at the

cloth the boy had wrapped his hand in.

“Get rid of that, too. The blood is dry,

obviously old. Can you work up a good

cry?”

The boy shook his head, seeming a little

embarrassed by the fact.

“Put some salt in your eyes. Get all

snotty and teary before you run to them.

Howl and blubber. Then when they’re

asking you about your hand, tell your

mum you’re sorry if you broke her knife.”

Brann listened, nodding slowly at first,

then faster. He smiled. “That’s good.” He

looked around nervously. “What do I

owe you?”

“Any secrets?” Bast asked.

The baker’s boy thought for a minute.

“Old Lant’s tupping the Widow Creel

…” he said hopefully.

Bast waved his hand. “For years.

Everyone knows.” Bast rubbed his nose,

then said, “Can you bring me two sweet

buns later today?”

Brann nodded.

“That’s a good start,” Bast said. “What

have you got in your pockets?”

The boy dug around and held up both

his hands. He had two iron shims, a flat

greenish stone, a bird skull, a tangle of

string, and a bit of chalk.

Bast claimed the string. Then, careful

not to touch the shims, he took the

greenish stone between two fingers and

arched an eyebrow at the boy.

After a moment’s hesitation, the boy

nodded.

Bast put the stone in his pocket.

“What if I get a birching anyway?”

Brann asked.

Bast shrugged. “That’s your business.

You wanted a lie. I gave you a good one.

If you want me to get you out of trouble,

that’s something else entirely.”

The baker’s boy looked disappointed,

but he nodded and headed down the hill.

Next up the hill was a slightly older

boy in tattered homespun. One of the

Alard boys, Kale. He had a split lip and

a crust of blood around one nostril. He

was as furious as only a boy of ten can

be. His expression was a thunderstorm.

“I caught my brother kissing Gretta

behind the old mill!” he said as soon as

he crested the hill, not waiting for Bast to

ask. “He knew I was sweet on her!”

Bast spread his hands helplessly,

shrugging.

“Revenge,” the boy spat.

“Public revenge?” Bast asked. “Or

secret revenge?”

The boy touched his split lip with his

tongue. “Secret revenge,” he said in a

low voice.

“How much revenge?” Bast asked.

The boy thought for a bit, then held up

his hands about two feet apart. “This

much.”

“Hmmmm,” Bast said. “How much on a

scale from mouse to bull?

The boy rubbed his nose for a while.

“About a cat’s worth,” he said. “Maybe a

dog’s worth. Not like Crazy Martin’s dog

though. Like the Bentons’ dogs.”

Bast nodded and tilted his head back in

a thoughtful way. “Okay,” he said. “Piss

in his shoes.”

The boy looked skeptical. “That don’t

sound like a whole dog’s worth of

revenge.”

Bast shook his head. “You piss in a cup

and hide it. Let it sit for a day or two.

Then one night when he’s put his shoes

by the fire, pour the piss on his shoes.

Don’t make a puddle, just get them damp.

In the morning they’ll be dry and

probably won’t even smell too much …”

“What’s the point?” the boy interrupted

angrily. “That’s not a flea’s worth of

revenge!”

Bast held up a pacifying hand. “When

his feet get sweaty, he’ll start to smell

like piss.” Bast said calmly. “If he steps

in a puddle, he’ll smell like piss. When

he walks in the snow, he’ll smell like

piss. It will be hard for him to figure out

exactly where it’s coming from, but

everyone will know your brother is the

one that reeks.” Bast grinned at the boy.

“I’m guessing your Gretta isn’t going to

want to kiss the boy who can’t stop

pissing himself.”

Raw admiration spread across the

young boy’s face like sunrise in the

mountains. “That’s the most bastardly

thing I’ve ever heard,” he said,

awestruck.

Bast tried to look modest and failed.

“Have you got anything for me?”

“I found a wild beehive,” the boy said.

“That will do for a start,” Bast said.

“Where?”

“It’s off past the Orissons’. Past

Littlecreek.” The boy squatted and drew

a map in the dirt. “You see?”

Bast nodded. “Anything else?”

“Well … I know where Crazy Martin

keeps his still …”

Bast raised his eyebrows at that.

“Really?”

The boy drew another map and gave

some directions. Then he stood and

dusted off his knees. “We square?”

Bast scuffed his foot in the dirt,

destroying the map. “We’re square.”

The boy dusted off his knees, “I’ve got

a message too. Rike wants to see you.”

Bast shook his head firmly. “He knows

the rules. Tell him no.”

“I already told him,” the boy said with

a comically exaggerated shrug. “But I’ll

tell him again if I see him …”

There were no more children waiting

after Kale, so Bast tucked the leather

book under his arm and went on a long,

rambling stroll. He found some wild

raspberries and ate them. He took a drink

from the Ostlar’s well.

Eventually Bast climbed to the top of a

nearby bluff where he gave a great

stretch before tucking the leather-bound

copy of Celum Tinture into a spreading

hawthorn tree where a wide branch made

a cozy nook against the trunk.

He looked up at the sky then, clear and

bright. No clouds. Not much wind. Warm

but not hot. Hadn’t rained for a solid

span. It wasn’t a market day. Hours

before noon on Felling …

Bast’s brow furrowed a bit, as if

performing some complex calculation.

Then he nodded to himself.

Then Bast headed back down the bluff,

past Old Lant’s place and around the

brambles that bordered the Alard farm.

When he came to Littlecreek he cut some

reeds and idly whittled at them with a

small bright knife. Then brought the

string out of his pocket and bound them

together, fashioning a tidy set of

shepherd’s pipes.

He blew across the top of them and

cocked his head to listen to their sweet

discord. His bright knife trimmed some

more, and he blew again. This time the

tune was closer, which made the discord

far more grating.

Bast’s knife flicked again, once, twice,

thrice. Then he put it away and brought

the pipes closer to his face. He breathed

in through his nose, smelling the wet

green of them. Then he licked the fresh-

cut tops of the reeds, the flicker of his

tongue a sudden, startling red.

Then he drew a breath and blew against

the pipes. This time the sound was bright

as moonlight, lively as a leaping fish,

sweet as stolen fruit. Smiling, Bast

headed off into the Bentons’ back hills,

and it wasn’t long before he heard the

low, mindless bleat of distant sheep.

A minute later, Bast came over the crest

of a hill and saw two dozen fat, daft

sheep cropping grass in the green valley

below. It was shadowy here, and

secluded. The lack of recent rain meant

the grazing was better here. The steep

sides of the valley meant the sheep

weren’t prone to straying and didn’t need

much looking after.

A young woman sat in the shade of a

spreading elm that overlooked the valley.

She had taken off her shoes and bonnet.

Her long, thick hair was the color of ripe

wheat.

Bast began playing then. A dangerous

tune. It was sweet and bright and slow

and sly.

The shepherdess perked up at the sound

of it, or so it seemed at first. She lifted

her head, excited … but no. She didn’t

look in his direction at all. She was

merely climbing to her feet to have a

stretch, rising high up onto her toes,

hands twining over her head.

Still apparently unaware she was being

serenaded, the young woman picked up a

nearby blanket, spread it beneath the tree,

and sat back down. It was a little odd, as

she’d been sitting there before without

the blanket. Perhaps she’d just grown

chilly.

Bast continued to play as he walked

down the slope of the valley toward her.

He did not hurry, and the music he made

was sweet and playful and languorous all

at once.

The shepherdess showed no sign of

noticing the music or Bast himself. In fact

she looked away from him, toward the

far end of the little valley, as if curious

what the sheep might be doing there.

When she turned her head, it exposed the

lovely line of her neck from her perfect

shell-like ear, down to the gentle swell

of breast that showed above her bodice.

Eyes intent on the young woman, Bast

stepped on a loose stone and stumbled

awkwardly down the hill. He blew one

hard, squawking note, then dropped a

few more from his song as he threw out

one arm wildly to catch his balance.

The shepherdess laughed then, but she

was pointedly looking at the other end of

the valley. Perhaps the sheep had done

something humorous. Yes. That was

surely it. They could be funny animals at

times.

Even so, one can only look at sheep for

so long. She sighed and relaxed, leaning

back against the sloping trunk of the tree.

The motion accidentally pulled the hem

of her skirt up slightly past her knee. Her

calves were round and tan and covered

with the lightest down of honey-colored

hair.

Bast continued down the hill. His steps

delicate and graceful. He looked like a

stalking cat. He looked like he were

dancing.

Apparently satisfied the sheep were

safe, the shepherdess sighed again,

closed her eyes, and lay her head against

the trunk of the tree. Her face tilted up to

catch the sun. She seemed about to sleep,

but for all her sighing her breath seemed

to be coming rather quickly. And when

she shifted restlessly to make herself

more comfortable, one hand fell in such a

way that it accidentally drew the hem of

her dress even farther up until it showed

a pale expanse of thigh.

It is hard to grin while playing

shepherd’s

pipes.

Somehow

Bast

managed it.

The sun was climbing the sky when Bast

returned to the lightning tree, pleasantly

sweaty and in a state of mild dishevel.

There were no children waiting near the

greystones this time, which suited him

perfectly.

He did a quick circle of the tree again

when he reached the top of the hill, once

in each direction to ensure his small

workings were still in place. Then he

slumped down and at the foot of the tree

and leaned against the trunk. Less than a

minute later his eyes were closed and he

was snoring slightly.

After the better part of an hour, the

near-silent sound of footsteps roused

him. He gave a great stretch and spied a

thin boy with freckles and clothes that

were slightly past the point where they

might merely be called well-worn.

“Kostrel!” Bast said happily. “How’s

the road to Tinuë?”

“Seems sunny enough to me today,” the

boy said as he came to the top of the hill.

“And I found a lovely secret by the

roadside. Something I thought you might

be interested in.”

“Ah,” Bast said. “Come have a seat

then. What sort of secret did you stumble

on?”

Kostrel sat cross-legged on the grass

nearby. “I know where Emberlee takes

her bath.”

Bast raised a half-interested eyebrow.

“Is that so?”

Kostrel grinned. “You faker. Don’t

pretend you don’t care.”

“Of course I care,” Bast said. “She’s

the sixth prettiest girl in town, after all.”

“Sixth?” the boy said, indignant. “She’s

the second prettiest and you know it.”

“Perhaps fourth,” Bast conceded.

“After Ania.”

“Ania’s legs are skinny as a chicken’s,”

Kostrel observed calmly.

Bast smiled at the boy. “To each his

own. But yes. I am interested. What

would you like in trade? An answer, a

favor, a secret?”

“I want a favor and information,” the

boy said with a small smirk. His dark

eyes were sharp in his lean face. “I want

good answers to three questions. And it’s

worth it. Because Emberlee is the third

prettiest girl in town.”

Bast opened his mouth as if he were

going to protest, then shrugged and

smiled. “No favor. But I’ll give you three

answers on a subject named beforehand,”

he countered. “Any subject except that of

my employer, whose trust in me I cannot

in good conscience betray.”

Kostrel nodded in agreement. “Three

full answers,” he said. “With no

equivocating or bullshittery.”

Bast nodded. “So long as the questions

are focused and specific. No ‘ tell me

everything you know about’ nonsense.”

“That wouldn’t be a question,” Kostrel

pointed out.

“Exactly,” Bast said. “And you agree

not to tell anyone else where Emberlee is

having her bullshittery Kostrel scowled

at that, and Bast laughed. “You little

cocker, you would have sold it twenty

times, wouldn’t you?”

The boy shrugged easily, not denying it,

and not embarrassed either. “It’s

valuable information.”

Bast chuckled. “Three full, earnest

answers on a single subject with the

understanding that I’m the only one

you’ve told.”

“You are,” the boy said sullenly. “I

came here first.”

“And with the understanding that you

won’t tell Emberlee anyone knows.”

Kostrel looked so offended at this that

Bast didn’t bother waiting for him to

agree. “And with the understanding that

you won’t show up yourself.”

The dark-eyed boy spat a couple words

that surprised Bast more than his earlier

use of “equivocating.”

“Fine,” Kostrel growled. “But if you

don’t know the answer to my question, I

get to ask another.”

Bast thought about it for a moment, then

nodded.

“And if I pick a subject you don’t know

much about, I get to chose another.”

Another nod. “That’s fair.”

“And you loan me another book,” the

boy said, his dark eyes glaring. “And a

copper penny. And you have to describe

her breasts to me.”

Bast threw back his head and laughed.

“Done.”

They shook on the deal, the boy’s thin

hand was delicate as a bird’s wing.

Bast leaned against the lightning tree,

yawning and rubbing the back of his

neck. “So. What’s your subject?”

Kostrel’s grim look lifted a little then,

and he grinned excitedly. “I want to

know about the Fae.”

It says a great deal that Bast finished

his great yawp of a yawn as if nothing

were the matter. It is quite hard to yawn

and stretch when your belly feels like

you’ve swallowed a lump of bitter iron

and your mouth has gone suddenly dry.

But

Bast

was

something

of

a

professional dissembler, so he yawned

and stretched, and even went so far as to

scratch himself under one arm lazily.

“Well?” the boy asked impatiently. “Do

you know enough about them?”

“A fair amount,” Bast said, doing a

much better job of looking modest this

time. “More than most folk, I imagine.”

Kostrel leaned forward, his thin face

intent. “I thought you might. You aren’t

from around here. You know things.

You’ve seen what’s really out there in

the world.”

“Some of it,” Bast admitted. He looked

up at the sun. “Ask your questions then. I

have to be somewhere come noon.”

The boy nodded seriously, then looked

down at the grass in front of himself for a

moment, thinking. “What are they like?”

Bast blinked for a moment, taken aback.

Then he laughed helplessly and threw up

his hands. “Merciful Tehlu. Do you have

any idea how crazy that question is?

They’re not like anything. They’re like

themselves.”

Kostrel looked indignant. “Don’t you

try to shim me!” he said, leveling a finger

at Bast. “I said no bullshittery!”

“I’m not. Honest I’m not.” Bast raised

his hands defensively. “It’s just an

impossible question to answer is all.

What would you say if I asked you what

people were like? How could you

answer that? There are so many kinds of

people, and they’re all different.”

“So it’s a big question,” Kostrel said.

“Give me a big answer.”

“It’s not just big,” Bast said. “It would

fill a book.”

The

boy

gave

a

profoundly

unsympathetic shrug.

Bast scowled. “It could be argued that

your question is neither focused nor

specific.”

Kostrel raised an eyebrow. “So we’re

arguing now? I thought we were trading

information? Fully and freely. If you

asked me where Emberlee was going for

her bath, and I said, ‘in a stream’ you’d

feel like I’d measured you some pretty

short corn, wouldn’t you?”

Bast sighed. “Fair enough. But if I told

you every rumor and snippet I’d ever

heard, this would take a span of days.

Most of it would be useless, and some

probably wouldn’t even be true because

it’s just from stories that I’ve heard.”

Kostrel frowned, but before he could

protest, Bast held up a hand. “Here’s

what I’ll do. Despite the unfocused

nature of your question, I’ll give you an

answer that covers the rough shape of

things and …” Bast hesitated. “… one

true secret on the subject. Okay?”

“Two secrets.” Kostrel said, his dark

eyes glittering with excitement.

“Fair enough.” Bast took a deep breath.

“When you say fae, you’re talking about

anything that lives in the Fae. That

includes a lot of things that are … just

creatures. Like animals. Here you have

dogs and squirrels and bears. In the Fae,

they have raum and dennerlings and …”

“And trow?”

Bast nodded. “And trow. They’re real.”

“And dragons?”

Bast shook his head. “Not that I’ve ever

heard. Not anymore …”

Kostrel looked disappointed. “What

about the fair folk? Like faerie tinkers

and such?” The boy narrowed his eyes.

“Mind you, this isn’t a new question,

merely an attempt to focus your ongoing

answer.”

Bast laughed helplessly. “Lord and

lady. Ongoing? Was your mother scared

by an azzie when she was pregnant?

Where do you get that kind of talk?

“I stay awake in church.” Kostrel

shrugged. “And sometimes Abbe Leodin

lets me read his books. What do they

look like?”

“Like regular people,” Bast said.

“Like you and me?” the boy asked.

Bast fought back a smile. “Just like you

or me. You wouldn’t hardly notice if they

passed you on the street. But there are

others. Some of them are … They’re

different. More powerful.”

“Like Varsa never-dead?”

“Some,” Bast conceded. “But some are

powerful in other ways. Like the mayor

is powerful. Or like a moneylender.”

Bast’s expression went sour. “Many of

those … they’re not good to be around.

They like to trick people. Play with them.

Hurt them.”

Some of the excitement bled out of

Kostrel at this. “They sound like

demons.”

Bast hesitated, then nodded a reluctant

agreement. “Some are very much like

demons,” he admitted. “Or so close as it

makes no difference.”

“Are some of them like angels, too?”

the boy asked.

“It’s nice to think that,” Bast said. “I

hope so.”

“Where do they come from?”

Bast cocked his head. “That’s your

second question then?” he asked. “I’m

guessing it must be, as it’s got nothing to

do with what the Fae are like …”

Kostrel grimaced, seeming a little

embarrassed, though Bast couldn’t tell if

he was ashamed he’d gotten carried

away with his questions, or ashamed

he’d been caught trying to get a free

answer. “Sorry,” he said. “Is it true that a

faerie can never lie?”

“Some can’t,” Bast said. “Some don’t

like to. Some are happy to lie but

wouldn’t ever go back on promise or

break their word.” He shrugged. “Others

lie quite well, and do so at every

opportunity.”

Kostrel began to ask something else,

but Bast cleared his throat. “You have to

admit,” he said. “That’s a pretty good

answer. I even gave you a few free

questions, to help with the focus of

things, as it were.”

Kostrel gave a slightly sullen nod.

“Here’s your first secret.” Bast held up

a single finger. “Most of the Fae don’t

come to this world. They don’t like it. It

rubs all rough against them, like wearing

a burlap shirt. But when they do come,

they like some places better than others.

They like wild places. Secret places.

Strange places. There are many types of

fae, many courts and houses. And all of

them are ruled according to their own

desires …”

Bast continued in a tone of soft

conspiracy. “But something that appeals

to all the fae are places with connections

to the raw, true things that shape the

world. Places that are touched with fire

and stone. Places that are close to water

and air. When all four come together …”

Bast paused to see if the boy would

interject something here. But Kostrel’s

face had lost the sharp cunning it had

held before. He looked like a child

again, mouth slightly agape, his eyes

wide with wonder.

“Second secret,” Bast said. “The fae

folk look nearly like we do, but not

exactly. Most have something about them

that makes them different. Their eyes.

Their ears. The color of their hair or

skin. Sometimes they’re taller than

normal, or shorter, or stronger, or more

beautiful.”

“Like Felurian”

“Yes, yes,” Bast said testily. “Like

Felurian. But any of the Fae who has the

skill to travel here will have craft enough

to hide those things.” He leaned back,

nodding to himself. “That is a type of

magic all the fair folk share.”

Bast threw the final comment out like a

fisherman casting a lure.

Kostrel

closed

his

mouth

and

swallowed hard. He didn’t fight the line.

Didn’t even know that he’d been hooked.

“What sort of magic can they do?”

Bast rolled his eyes dramatically. “Oh

come now, that’s another whole book’s

worth of question.”

“Well maybe you should just write a

book then,” Kostrel said flatly. “Then

you can lend it to me and kill two birds

with one stone.”

The comment seemed to catch Bast off

his stride. “Write a book?”

“That’s what people do when they

know every damn thing, isn’t it?” Kostrel

said sarcastically. “They write it down

so they can show off.”

Bast looked thoughtful for a moment,

then shook his head as if to clear it.

“Okay. Here’s the bones of what I know.

They don’t think of it as magic. They’d

never use that term. They’ll talk of art or

craft. They talk of seeming or shaping.”

He looked up at the sun and pursed his

lips. “But if they were being frank, and

they are rarely frank, mind you, they

would tell you almost everything they do

is either glammourie or grammarie.

Glammourie is the art of making

something seem. Grammarie is the craft

of making something be.”

Bast rushed ahead before the boy could

interrupt. “Glammourie is easier. They

can make a thing seem other than it is.

They could make a white shirt seem like

it was blue. Or a torn shirt seem like it

was whole. Most of the folk have at least

a scrap of this art. Enough to hide

themselves from mortal eyes. If their hair

was all of silver-white, their glammourie

could make it look as black as night.”

Kostrel’s face was lost in wonder yet

again. But it was not the gormless, gaping

wonder of before. It was a thoughtful

wonder. A clever wonder, curious and

hungry. It was the sort of wonder that

would steer a boy toward a question that

started with a how.

Bast could see the shape of these things

moving in the boy’s dark eyes. His damn

clever eyes. Too clever by half. Soon

those vague wonderings would start to

crystallize into questions like “How do

they make their glammourie? ” or even worse. “How might a young boy break

it?”

And what then, with a question like that

hanging in the air? Nothing good would

come of it. To break a promise fairly

made and lie outright was retrograde to

his desire. Even worse to do it in this

place. Far easier to tell the truth, then

make sure something happened to the boy

…

But honestly, he liked the boy. He

wasn’t dull, or easy. He wasn’t mean or

low. He pushed back. He was funny and

grim and hungry and more alive than any

three other people in the town all put

together. He was bright as broken glass

and sharp enough to cut himself. And

Bast too, apparently.

Bast rubbed his face. This never used

to happen. He had never been in conflict

with his own desire before he came here.

He hated it. It was so simply singular

before. Want and have. See and take. Run

and chase. Thirst and slake. And if he

were thwarted in pursuit of his desire …

what of it? That was simply the way of

things. The desire itself was still his, it

was still pure.

It wasn’t like that now. Now his desires

grew complicated. They constantly

conflicted with each other. He felt

endlessly turned against himself. Nothing

was simple anymore, he was pulled so

many ways …

“Bast?” Kostrel said, his head cocked

to the side, concern plain on his face.

“Are you okay?” he asked. “What’s the

matter?”

Bast smiled an honest smile. He was a

curious boy. Of course. That was the

way. That was the narrow road between

desires. “I was just thinking. Grammarie

is much harder to explain. I can’t say I

understand it all that well myself.”

“Just do your best,” Kostrel said

kindly. “Whatever you tell me will be

more than I know.”

No, he couldn’t kill this boy. That

would be too hard a thing.

“Grammarie is changing a thing,” Bast

said, making an inarticulate gesture.

“Making it into something different than

what it is.”

“Like turning lead into gold?” Kostrel

asked. “Is that how they make faerie

gold?”

Bast made a point of smiling at the

question. “Good guess, but that’s

glammourie. It’s easy, but it doesn’t last.

That’s why people who take faerie gold

end up with pockets full of stones or

acorns in the morning.”

“Could they turn gravel into gold?”

Kostrel asked. “If they really wanted

to?”

“It’s not that sort of change,” Bast said,

though he still smiled and nodded at the

question. “That’s too big. Grammarie is

about … shifting. It’s about making

something into more of what it already

is.”

Kostrel’s face twisted with confusion.

Bast took a deep breath and let it out

through his nose. “Let me try something

else. What have you got in your

pockets?”

Kostrel rummaged about and held out

his hands. There was a brass button, a

scrap of paper, a stub of pencil, a small

folding knife … and a stone with a hole in it. Of course.

Bast slowly passed his hand over the

collection

of

oddments,

eventually

stopping above the knife. It wasn’t

particularly fine or fancy, just a piece of

smooth wood the size of a finger with a

groove where a short, hinged blade was

tucked away.

Bast picked it up delicately between

two fingers and set it down on the ground

between them. “What’s this?”

Kostrel stuffed the rest of his

belongings into his pocket. “It’s my

knife.”

“That’s it?” Bast asked.

The boy’s eyes narrowed suspiciously.

“What else could it be?”

Bast brought out his own knife. It was a

little larger, and instead of wood, it was

carved from a piece of antler, polished

and beautiful. Bast opened it, and the

bright blade shone in the sun.

He laid his knife next to the boy’s.

“Would you trade your knife for mine?”

Kostrel eyed the knife jealously. But

even so, there wasn’t a hint of hesitation

before he shook his head.

“Why not?”

“Because it’s mine,” the boy said, his

face clouding over.

“Mine’s better,” Bast said matter-of-

factly.

Kostrel reached out and picked up his

knife, closing his hand around it

possessively. His face was sullen as a

storm. “My da gave me this,” he said.

“Before he took the king’s coin and went

to be a soldier and save us from the

rebels.” He looked up at Bast, as if

daring him to say a single word contrary

to that.

Bast didn’t look away from him, just

nodded seriously. “So it’s more than just

a knife.” he said. “It’s special to you.”

Still clutching the knife, Kostrel

nodded, blinking rapidly.

“For you, it’s the best knife.”

Another nod.

“It’s more important than other knives.

And that’s not just a seeming, ” Bast said.

“It’s something the knife is. ”

There was a flicker of understanding in

Kostrel’s eyes.

Bast nodded. “That’s grammarie. Now

imagine if someone could take a knife

and make it be more of what a knife is.

Make it into the best knife. Not just for

them, but for anyone. ” Bast picked up his

own knife and closed it. “If they were

really skilled, they could do it with

something other than a knife. They could

make a fire that was more of what a fire

is. Hungrier. Hotter. Someone truly

powerful could do even more. They

could take a shadow …” He trailed off

gently, leaving an open space in the

empty air.

Kostrel drew a breath and leapt to fill it

with a question. “Like Felurian!’ he said.

“Is that what she did to make Kvothe’s

shadow cloak?”

Bast nodded seriously, glad for the

question, hating that it had to be that

question. “It seems likely to me. What

does a shadow do? It conceals, it

protects. Kvothe’s cloak of shadows

does the same, but more.”

Kostrel

was

nodding

along

in

understanding, and Bast pushed on

quickly, eager to leave this particular

subject behind. “Think of Felurian

herself …”

The boy grinned, he seemed to have no

trouble doing that.

“A woman can be a thing of beauty,”

Bast said slowly. “She can be a focus of

desire. Felurian is that. Like the knife.

The most beautiful. The focus of the most

desire. For everyone …” Bast let his

statement trail off gently yet again.

Kostrel’s

eyes

were

far

away,

obviously giving the matter his full

deliberation. Bast gave him time for it,

and after a moment another question

bubbled out of the boy. “Couldn’t it be

merely glammourie?” he asked.

“Ah,” said Bast, smiling. “But what is

the difference between being beautiful

and seeming beautiful?”

“Well …” Kostrel stalled for a

moment, then rallied. “One is real and

the other isn’t.” He sounded certain, but

it wasn’t reflected in his expression.

“One would be fake. You could tell the

difference, couldn’t you?”

Bast let the question sail by. It was

close, but not quite. “What’s the

difference between a shirt that looks

white and a shirt that is white?” he

countered.

“A woman isn’t the same as a shirt,”

Kostrel said with vast disdain. “You’d

know if you touched her. If she looked all

soft and rosy like Emberlee, but her hair

felt like a horse’s tail, you’d know it

wasn’t real.”

“Glammourie isn’t just for fooling

eyes,” Bast said. “It’s for everything.

Faerie gold feels heavy. And a

glamoured pig would smell like roses

when you kissed it.”

Kostrel reeled visibly at that. The shift

from Emberlee to a glamoured pig

obviously left him feeling more than

slightly appalled. Bast waited a moment

for him to recover.

“Wouldn’t it be harder to glamour a

pig?” he asked at last.

“You’re

clever,”

Bast

said

encouragingly. “You’re exactly right.

And glamouring a pretty girl to be more

pretty wouldn’t be much work at all. It’s

like putting icing on a cake.”

Kostrel rubbed his cheek thoughtfully.

“Can you use glammourie and grammarie

at the same time?”

Bast was more genuinely impressed

this time. “That’s what I’ve heard.”

Kostrel nodded to himself. “That’s

what Felurian must do,” he said. “Like

cream on icing on cake.”

“I think so,” Bast said. “The one I met

…” He stopped abruptly, his mouth

snapped shut.

“You’ve met one of the Fae?”

Bast grinned like a beartrap. “Yes.”

This time Kostrel felt the hook and line

both. But it was too late. “You bastard!”

“I am,” Bast admitted happily.

“You tricked me into asking that.”

“I did,” Bast said. “It was a question

related to this subject, and I answered it

fully and without equivocation.”

Kostrel got to his feet and stormed off,

only to come back a moment later. “Give

me my penny,” he demanded.

Bast reached into his pocket and pulled

out a copper penny. “Where’s does

Emberlee take her bath?”

Kostrel glowered furiously, then said,

“Out past Oldstone bridge, up toward the

hills about half a mile. There’s a little

hollow with an elm tree.”

“And when?”

“After lunch on the Boggan farm. After

she finishes the washing up and hangs the

laundry.”

Bast tossed him the penny, still grinning

like mad.

“I hope your dick falls off,” the boy

said venomously before stomping back

down the hill.

Bast couldn’t help but laugh. He tried to

do it quietly to spare the boy’s feelings

but didn’t meet with much success.

Kostrel turned at the bottom of the hill,

and shouted, “And you still owe me a

book!”

Bast

stopped

laughing

then

as

something jogged loose in his memory.

He panicked for a moment when he

realized Celum Tinture wasn’t in its

usual spot.

Then he remembered leaving the book

in the tree on top of the bluff and relaxed.

The clear sky showed no sign of rain. It

was safe enough. Besides, it was nearly

noon, perhaps a little past. So he turned

and hurried down the hill, not wanting to

be late.

Bast sprinted most of the way to the little

dell, and by the time he arrived he was

sweating like a hard-run horse. His shirt

stuck to him unpleasantly, so as he

walked down the sloping bank to the

water, he pulled it off and used it to mop

the sweat from his face.

A long, flat jut of stone pushed out into

Littlecreek there, forming one side of a

calm pool where the stream turned back

on itself. A stand of willow trees

overhung the water, making it private and

shady. The shoreline was overgrown

with thick bushes, and the water was

smooth and calm and clear.

Bare-chested, Bast walked out onto the

rough jut of stone. Dressed, his face and

hands made him look rather lean, but

shirtless his wide shoulders were

surprising, more what you might expect

to see on a field hand, rather than a

shiftless sort that did little more than

lounge around an empty inn all day.

Once he was out of the shadow of the

willows, Bast knelt to dunk his shirt in

the pool. Then he wrung it over his head,

shivering a bit at the chill of it. He

rubbed his chest and arms briskly,

shaking drops of water from his face.

He set the shirt aside, grabbed the lip of

stone at the edge of the pool, then took a

deep breath and dunked his head. The

motion made the muscles across his back

and shoulders flex. A moment later he

pulled his head out, gasping slightly and

shaking water from his hair.

Bast stood then, slicking back his hair

with both hands. Water streamed down

his chest, making runnels in the dark hair,

trailing down across the flat plane of his

stomach.

He shook himself off a bit, then stepped

over to dark niche made by a jagged

shelf of overhanging rock. He felt around

for a moment before pulling out a knob of

butter-colored soap.

He knelt at the edge of the water again,

dunking his shirt several times, then

scrubbing it with the soap. It took a

while, as he had no washing board, and

he obviously didn’t want to chafe his

shirt against the rough stones. He soaped

and rinsed the shirt several times,

wringing it out with his hands, making the

muscles in his arms and shoulders tense

and twine. He did a thorough job, though

by the time he was finished, he was

completely soaked and spattered with

lather.

Bast spread his shirt out on a sunny

stone to dry. He started to undo his pants,

then stopped and tipped his head on one

side, trying to jog loose water from his

ear.

It might be because of the water in his

ear that Bast didn’t hear the excited

twittering coming from the bushes that

grew along the shore. A sound that could,

conceivably, be sparrows chattering

among the branches. A flock of

sparrows. Several flocks, perhaps.

And if Bast didn’t see the bushes

moving either? Or note that in among the

hanging foliage of the willow branches

there were colors normally not found in

trees? Sometimes a pale pink, sometimes

blushing

red.

Sometimes

an

ill-

considered yellow or a cornflower blue.

And while it’s true that dresses might

come in those colors … well … so did

birds. Finches and jays. And besides, it

was fairly common knowledge among the

young women of the town that the dark

young man who worked at the inn was

woefully nearsighted.

The sparrows twittered in the bushes as

Bast worked at the drawstring of his

pants again. The knot apparently giving

him some trouble. He fumbled with it for

a while, then grew frustrated and gave a

great, catlike stretch, arms arching over

his head, his body bending like a bow.

Finally he managed to work the knot

loose and shuck free of his pants. He

wore nothing underneath. He tossed them

aside and from the willow came a

squawk of the sort that could have come

from a larger bird. A heron perhaps. Or a

crow. And if a branch shook violently at

the same time, well, perhaps a bird had

leaned too far from its branch and nearly

fell. It certainly stood to reason that some

birds were more clumsy than others. And

besides, at the time Bast was looking the

other way.

Bast dove into the water then, splashing

like a boy and gasping at the cold. After

a few minutes he moved to a shallower

portion of the pool where the water rose

to barely reach his narrow waist.

Beneath the water, a careful observer

might note the young man’s legs looked

somewhat … odd. But it was shady

there, and everyone knows that water

bends light strangely, making things look

other than they are. And besides, birds

are not the most careful of observers,

especially when their attention is focused

elsewhere.

An hour or so later, slightly damp and

smelling of sweet honeysuckle soap, Bast

climbed the bluff where he was fairly

certain that he’d left his master’s book. It

was the third bluff he’d climbed in the

last half hour.

When he reached the top, Bast relaxed

at the sight of a hawthorn tree. Walking





closer, he saw it was the right tree, the nook right where he remembered. But the

book was gone. A quick circle of the tree

showed that it hadn’t fallen to the ground.

Then the wind stirred and Bast saw

something white. He felt a sudden chill,

fearing it was a page torn free from the

book. Few things angered his master like

a mistreated book.

But no. Reaching up, Bast didn’t feel

paper. It was a smooth stretch of birch

bark. He pulled it down and saw the

letters crudely scratched into the side.

I ned ta tawk ta ewe. Ets

emportant.

Rike

Afternoon: Birds and Bees

With no idea of where he might find

Rike, Bast made his way back to the

lightning tree. He had just settled down

in his usual place when a young girl

came into the clearing.

She didn’t stop at the greystone and

instead trudged straight up the side of the

hill. She was younger than the others, six

or seven. she wore a bright blue dress

and had deep purple ribbons twining

through her carefully curled hair.

She had never come to the lightning tree

before, but Bast had seen her. Even if he

hadn’t, he could have guessed by her fine

clothes and the smell of rosewater that

she was Viette, the mayor’s youngest

daughter.

She climbed the low hill slowly,

carrying something furry in the crook of

her arm. When she reached the top of the

hill she stood, slightly fidgety, but still waiting.

Bast eyed her quietly for a moment.

“Do you know the rules?” he asked.

She stood, purple ribbons in her hair.

She was obviously slightly scared, but

her lower lip stuck out, defiant. She

nodded.

“What are they?”

The young girl licked her lips and

began to recite in a singsong voice. “No

one taller than the stone.” She pointed to

the fallen greystone at the foot of the hill.

“Come to blacktree, come alone.” She

put her finger to her lips, miming a

shushing noise.

“Tell no—”

“Hold on,” Bast interrupted. “You say

the last two lines while touching the

tree.”

The girl blanched a bit at this but

stepped forward and put her hand against

the sun-bleached wood of the long-dead

tree.

The girl cleared her throat again, then

paused, her lips moving silently as she

ran through the beginning of the poem

until she found her place again. “Tell no

adult what’s been said, lest the lightning

strike you dead.”

When she spoke the last word, Viette

gasped and jerked her hand back, as if

something had burned or bitten her

fingers. Her eyes went wide as she

looked down at her fingertips and saw

they were an untouched, healthy pink.

Bast hid a smile behind his hand.

“Very well then,” Bast said. “You

know the rules. I keep your secrets and

you keep mine. I can answer questions or

help you solve a problem.” He sat down

again, his back against the tree, bringing

him to eye level with the girl. “What do

you want?”

She held out the tiny puff of white fur

she carried in the crook of her arm. It

mewled. “Is this a magic kitten?” she

asked.

Bast took the kitten in his hand and

looked it over. It was a sleepy thing,

almost entirely white. One eye was blue,

the other green. “It is, actually,” he said,

slightly surprised. “At least a little.” He

handed it back.

She nodded seriously. “I want to call

her Princess Icing Bun.”

Bast simply stared at her, nonplussed.

“Okay.”

The girl scowled at him. “I don’t know

if she’s a girl or a boy!”

“Oh,” Bast said. He held out his hand,

took the kitten, then petted it and handed

it back. “It’s a girl.”

The mayor’s daughter narrowed her

eyes at him. “Are you fibbing?”

Bast blinked at the girl, then laughed.

“Why would you believe me the first

time and not the second?” he asked.

“I could tell she was a magic kitten,”

Viette said, rolling her eyes in

exasperation. “I just wanted to make

sure. But she’s not wearing a dress. She

doesn’t have any ribbons or bows. How

can you tell if she’s a girl?”

Bast opened his mouth. Then closed it

again. This was not some farmer’s child.

She had a governess and a whole

closetful of clothes. She didn’t spend her

time around sheep and pigs and goats.

She’d never seen a lamb born. She had

an older sister, but no brothers …

He hesitated; he’d rather not lie. Not

here. But he hadn’t promised to answer

her question, hadn’t made any sort of

agreement at all with her. That made

things easier. A great deal easier than

having an angry mayor visit the

Waystone, demanding to know why his

daughter suddenly knew the word

“penis.”

“I tickle the kitten’s tummy,” Bast said

easily. “And if it winks at me, I know it’s

a girl.”

This satisfied Viette, and she nodded

gravely. “How can I get my father to let

me keep it?”

“You’ve already asked him nicely?”

She nodded. “Daddy hates cats.”

“Begged and cried?”

Nod.

“Screamed and thrown a fit?”

She rolled her eyes and gave an

exasperated sigh. “I’ve tried all that, or I

wouldn’t be here.”

Bast thought for a moment. “Okay.

First, you have to get some food that will

keep good for a couple days. Biscuits.

Sausage. Apples. Hide it in your room

where nobody will find it. Not even your

governess. Not even the maid. Do you

have a place like that?”

The little girl nodded.

“Then go ask your daddy one more

time. Be gentle and polite. If he still says

no, don’t be angry. Just tell him that you

love the kitten. Say if you can’t have her,

you’re afraid you’ll be so sad you’ll

die.”

“He’ll still say no,” the little girl said.

Bast shrugged. “Probably. Here’s the

second part. Tonight, pick at your dinner.

Don’t eat it. Not even the dessert.” The

little girl started to say something, but

Bast held up a hand. “If anyone asks you,

just say you’re not hungry. Don’t mention

the kitten. When you’re alone in your

room tonight, eat some of the food you’ve

hidden.”

The little girl looked thoughtful.

Bast continued. “Tomorrow, don’t get

out of bed. Say you’re too tired. Don’t

eat your breakfast. Don’t eat your lunch.

You can drink a little water, but just sips.

Just lie in bed. When they ask what’s the

matter—”

She brightened. “I say I want my

kitten!”

Bast shook his head, his expression

grim. “No. That will spoil it. Just say

you’re tired. If they leave you alone, you

can eat, but be careful. If they catch you,

you’ll never get your kitten.”

The girl was listening intently now, her

brow furrowed in concentration.

“By dinner they’ll be worried. They’ll

offer you more food. Your favorites.

Keep saying you’re not hungry. You’re

just tired. Just lie there. Don’t talk. Do

that all day long.”

“Can I get up to pee?”

Bast nodded. “But remember to act

tired. No playing. The next day, they’ll

be scared. They’ll bring in a doctor.

They’ll try to feed you broth. They’ll try

everything. At some point your father

will be there, and he’ll ask you what’s

the matter.”

Bast grinned at her. “That’s when you

start to cry. No howling. Don’t blubber.

Just tears. Just lie there and cry. Then say

you miss your kitten so much. You miss

your kitten so much you don’t want to be

alive anymore.”

The little girl thought about it for a long

minute, petting her kitten absentmindedly

with one hand. Finally she nodded,

“Okay.” She turned to go.

“Hold on now!” Bast said quickly. “I

gave you what you wanted. You owe me

now.”

The little girl turned around, her

expression an odd mix of surprise and

anxious embarrassment. “I didn’t bring

any money,” she said, not meeting his

eye.

“Not money,” Bast said. “I gave you

two answers and a way to get your kitten.

You owe me three things. You pay with

gifts and favors. You pay in secrets …”

She thought for a moment. “Daddy

hides his strongbox key inside the mantel

clock.”

Bast nodded approvingly. “That’s one.”

The little girl looked up into the sky,

still petting her kitten. “I saw mama

kissing the maid once.”

Bast raised an eyebrow at that. “That’s

two …”

The girl put her finger in her ear and

wiggled it. “That’s all, I think.”

“How about a favor, then?” Bast said.

“I need you to fetch me two dozen

daisies with long stems. And a blue

ribbon. And two armfuls of gemlings.”

Viette’s face puckered in confusion.

“What’s a gemling?”

“Flowers,” Bast said, looking puzzled

himself. “Maybe you call them balsams?

They grow wild all over around here,”

he said, making a wide gesture with both

hands.

“Do you mean geraniums?” she asked.

Bast shook his head. “No. They’ve got

loose petals, and they’re about this big.”

he made a circle with his thumb and

middle finger. “They’re yellow and

orange and red …”

The girl stared at him blankly.

“Widow Creel keeps them in her

window box,” Bast continued. “When

you touch the seedpods, they pop …”

Viette’s face lit up. “Oh! You mean

touch-me-nots, ” she said, her tone more

than slightly patronizing. “I can bring you

a bunch of those. That’s easy. ” She

turned to run down the hill.

Bast called out before she’d taken six

steps. “Wait!” When she spun around, he

asked her. “What do you say if somebody

asks you who you’re picking flowers

for?”

She rolled her eyes again. “I tell them

it’s none of their tupping business,” she

said. “Because my daddy is the mayor.”

After Viette left, a high whistle made

Bast look down the hill toward the

greystone. There were no children

waiting there.

The whistle came again, and Bast

stood, stretching long and hard. It would

have surprised most of the young women

in town how easily he spotted the figure

standing in the shadow of the trees at the

edge of the clearing nearly two hundred

feet away.

Bast sauntered down the hill, across the

grassy field, and into the shadow of the

trees. There was an older boy there with

smudgy face and a pug nose. He was

perhaps twelve and his shirt and pants

were both too small for him, showing too

much dirty wrist at the cuff and bare

ankle below. He was barefoot and had a

slightly sour smell about him.

“Rike.” Bast’s voice held none of the

friendly, bantering tone he’d used with

the town’s other children. “How’s the

road to Tinuë?”

“It’s a long damn way,” the boy said

bitterly, not meeting Bast’s eye. “We live

in the ass of nowhere.”

“I see you have my book,” Bast said.

The boy held it out. “I wann’t tryin’ to

steal it,” he muttered quickly. “I just

needed to talk to you.”

Bast took the book silently.

“I didn’t break the rules,” the boy said.

“I didn’t even come into the clearing. But

I need help. I’ll pay for it.”

“You lied to me, Rike,” Bast said, his

voice grim.

“And din’t I pay for that?” the boy

demanded angrily, looking up for the first

time. “Din’t I pay for it ten times over?

Ent my life shit enough without having

more shit piled on top of it?”

“And it’s all beside the point because

you’re too old now,” Bast said flatly.

“I aren’t either!” the boy stomped a

foot. Then struggled and took a deep

breath, visibly forcing his temper back

under control. “Tam is older’n me and he

can still come to the tree! I’m just taller’n

him!”

“Those are the rules,” Bast said.

“It’s a shite rule!” the boy shouted, his

hands making angry fists. “And you’re a

shite little bastard who deserves more of

the belt than he gets!”

There was a silence then, broken only

by the boy’s ragged breathing. Rike’s

eyes were on the ground, fists clenched

at his sides, he was shaking.

Bast’s eyes narrowed ever so slightly.

The boy’s voice was rough. “Just one,”

Rike said. “Just one favor just this once.

It’s a big one. But I’ll pay. I’ll pay

triple.”

Bast drew a deep breath and let it out

as a sigh. “Rike, I—”

“Please, Bast?” He was still shaking,

but Bast realized the boy’s voice wasn’t

angry anymore. “Please?” Eyes still on

the ground, he took a hesitant step

forward. “Just … please?” His hand

reached out and just hung there aimlessly,

as if he didn’t know what to do with it.

Finally he caught hold of Bast’s

shirtsleeve and tugged it once, feebly,

before letting his hand fall back to his side.

“I just can’t fix this on my own.” Rike

looked up, eyes full of tears. His face

was twisted in a knot of anger and fear.

A boy too young to keep from crying, but

still old enough so that he couldn’t help

but hate himself for doing it.

“I need you to get rid of my da,” he said

in a broken voice. “I can’t figure a way. I

could stick him while he’s asleep, but my

ma would find out. He drinks and hits at

her. And she cries all the time and then

he hits her more.”

Rike was looking at the ground again,

the words pouring out of him in a gush. “I

could get him when he’s drunk

somewhere, but he’s so big. I couldn’t

move him. They’d find the body and then

the azzie would get me. I couldn’t look

my ma in the eye then. Not if she knew. I

can’t think what that would do to her, if

she knew I was the sort of person that

would kill his own da.”

He looked up then, his face furious,

eyes red with weeping. “I would though.

I’d kill him. You just got to tell me how.”

There was a moment of quiet.

“Okay,” Bast said.

They went down to the stream where they

could have a drink and Rike could wash

his face and collect himself a little bit.

When the boy’s face was cleaner, Bast

noted not all the smudginess was dirt. It

was easy to make the mistake, as the

summer sun had tanned him a rich nut

brown. Even after he was clean it was

hard to tell they were the faint remains of

bruises.

But rumor or no, Bast’s eyes were

sharp. Cheek and jaw. A darkness all

around one skinny wrist. And when he

bent to take a drink from the stream, Bast

glimpsed the boy’s back …

“So,” Bast said as they sat beside the

stream. “What exactly do you want? Do

you want to kill him, or do you just want

to have him gone?”

“If he was just gone, I’d never sleep

again for worry he’d come slouching

back.” Rike said, then was quiet for a bit.

“He went gone two span once.” He gave

a faint smile. “That was a good time, just

me and my ma. It was like my birthday

every day when I woke up and he wasn’t

there. I never knew my ma could sing …”

The boy went quiet again. “I thought

he’d fallen somewhere drunk and finally

broke his neck. But he’d just traded off a

year of furs for drinking money. He’d just

been in his trapping shack, all stupor-

drunk for half a month, not hardly more

than a mile away.”

The boy shook his head, more firmly

this time. “No, if he goes, he won’t stay

away.”

“I can figure out the how,” Bast said.

“That’s what I do. But you need to tell

me what you really want.”

Rike sat for a long while, jaw clenching

and unclenching. “Gone,” he said at last.

The word seemed to catch in his throat.

“So long as he stays gone forever. If you

can really do it.”

“I can do it,” Bast said.

Rike looked at his hands for a long

time. “Gone then. I’d kill him. But that

sort of thing ent right. I don’t want to be

that sort of man. A fellow shouldn’t ought

to kill his da.”

“I could do it for you,” Bast said easily.

Rike sat for a while, then shook his

head. “It’s the same thing, innit? Either

way it’s me. And if it were me, it would

be more honest if I did it with my hands

rather than do it with my mouth.”

Bast nodded. “Right then. Gone

forever.”

“And soon,” Rike said.

Bast sighed and looked up at the sun.

He already had things to do today. The

turning wheels of his desire did not come

grinding to a halt because some farmer

drank too much. Emberlee would be

taking her bath soon. He was supposed to

get carrots …

He didn’t owe the boy a thing, either.

Quite the opposite. The boy had lied to

him. Broken his promise. And while Bast

had settled that account so firmly that no

other child in town would ever dream of

crossing him like that again … it was

still galling to remember. The thought of

helping him now, despite that, it was

quite the opposite of his desire.

“It has to be soon,” Rike said. “He’s

getting worse. I can run off, but ma can’t.

And little Bip can’t neither. And …”

“Fine, fine …” Bast cut him off, waving

his hands. “Soon.”

Rike swallowed. “What’s this going to

cost me?” he asked, anxious.

“A lot,” Bast said grimly. “We’re not

talking about ribbons and buttons here.

Think how much you want this. Think

how big it is.” He met the boy’s eye and

didn’t look away. “Three times that is

what you owe me. Plus some for soon.”

He stared hard at the boy. “Think hard on

that.”

Rike was a little pale now, but he

nodded without looking away. “You can

have what you like of mine,” he said.

“But nothin’ of ma’s. She ent got much

that my da hasn’t already drank away.”

“We’ll work it out,” Bast said. “But

it’ll be nothing of hers. I promise.”

Rike took a deep breath, then gave a

sharp nod. “Okay. Where do we start?”

Bast pointed at the stream. “Find a

river stone with a hole in it and bring it

to me.”

Rike gave Bast an odd look. “Yeh want

a faerie stone?”

“Faerie stone,” Bast said with such

scathing mockery that Rike flushed with

embarrassment. “You’re too old for that

nonsense.” Bast gave the boy a look. “Do

you want my help or not?” he asked.

“I do,” Rike said in a small voice.

“Then I want a river stone.” Bast

pointed back at the stream. “You have to

be the one to find it,” he said. “It can’t be

anyone else. And you need to find it dry

on the shore.”

Rike nodded.

“Right then.” Bast clapped his hands

twice. “Off you go.”

Rike left and Bast returned to the

lightning tree. No children were waiting

to talk to him, so he idled the time away.

He skipped stones in the nearby stream

and flipped through Celum Tinture,

glancing at some of the illustrations.

Calcification. Titration. Sublimation.

Brann, happily unbirched with one hand

bandaged, brought him two sweet buns

wrapped in a white handkerchief. Bast

ate the first and set the second aside.

Viette brought armloads of flowers and

a fine blue ribbon. Bast wove the daisies

into a crown, threading the ribbon

through the stems.

Then, looking up at the sun, he saw that

it was nearly time, Bast removed his

shirt and filled it with the wealth of

yellow and red touch-me-nots Viette had

brought him. He added the handkerchief

and crown, then fetched a stick and made

a bindle so he could carry the lot more

easily.

He headed out past the Oldstone bridge,

then up toward the hills and around a

bluff until he found the place Kostrel had

described. It was cleverly hidden away,

and the stream curved and eddied into a

lovely little pool perfect for a private

bath.

Bast sat behind some bushes, and after

nearly half an hour of waiting he had

fallen into a doze. The sharp crackle of a

twig and a scrap of an idle song roused

him, and he peered down to see a young

woman making her careful way down the

steep hillside to the water’s edge.

Moving

silently,

Bast

scurried

upstream, carrying his bundle. Two

minutes later he was kneeling on the

grassy waterside with the pile of flowers

beside him.

He picked up a yellow blossom and

breathed on it gently. As his breath

brushed the petals, its color faded and

changed into a delicate blue. He dropped

it and the current carried it slowly

downstream.

Bast gathered up a handful of posies,

red and orange, and breathed on them

again. They too shifted and changed until

they were a pale and vibrant blue. He

scattered them onto the surface of the

stream. He did this twice more until there

were no flowers left.

Then, picking up the handkerchief and

daisy

crown,

he

sprinted

back

downstream to the cozy little hollow

with the elm. He’d moved quickly

enough that Emberlee was just coming to

the edge of the water.

Softly, silently, he crept up to the

spreading elm. Even with one hand

carrying the handkerchief and crown, he

went up the side as nimbly as a squirrel.

Bast lay along a low branch, sheltered

by leaves, breathing fast but not hard.

Emberlee was removing her stockings

and setting them carefully on a nearby

hedge. Her hair was a burnished golden

red, falling in lazy curls. Her face was sweet and round, a lovely shade of pale

and pink.

Bast grinned as he watched her look

around, first left, then right. Then she

began to unlace her bodice. Her dress

was a pale cornflower blue, edged with

yellow, and when she spread it on the

hedge, it flared and splayed out like the

wing of a great bird. Perhaps some

fantastic combination of a finch and a

jay.

Dressed only in her white shift,

Emberlee looked around again: left, then

right. Then she shimmied free of it, a

fascinating motion. She tossed the shift

aside and stood there, naked as the moon.

Her creamy skin was amazing with

freckle. Her hips wide and lovely. The

tips of her breasts were brushed with the

palest of pink.

She scampered into the water. Making a

series of small, dismayed cries at the

chill of it. They were, on consideration,

not really similar to a raven’s at all.

Though they could, perhaps, be slightly

like a heron’s.

Emberlee washed herself a bit,

splashing and shivering. She soaped

herself, dunked her head in the river, and

came up gasping. Wet, her hair became

the color of ripe cherries.

It was then that the first of the blue

touch-me-nots arrived, drifting on the

water. She glanced at it curiously as it

floated by and began to lather soap into

her hair.

More flowers followed. They came

downstream and made circles around

her, caught in the slow eddy of the pool.

She looked at them, amazed. Then sieved

a double handful from the water and

brought them to her face, drawing a deep

breath to smell them.

She laughed delightedly and dunked

under the surface, coming up in the

middle of the flowers, the water sluiced

her pale skin, running over her naked

breasts. Blossoms clung to her, as if

reluctant to let go.

That was when Bast fell out of the tree.

There was a brief, mad scrabbling of

fingers against bark, a bit of a yelp, then

he hit the ground like a sack of suet. He

lay on his back in the grass and let out a

low, miserable groan.

He heard a splashing, and then

Emberlee appeared above him. She held

her white shift in front of her. Bast

looked up from where he lay in the tall

grass.

He’d been lucky to land on that patch of

springy turf, cushioned with tall, green

grass. A few feet to one side, and he’d

have broken himself against the rocks.

Five feet the other way and he would

have been wallowing in mud.

Emberlee knelt beside him, her skin

pale, her hair dark. One posy clung to her

neck—it was the same color as her eyes,

a pale and vibrant blue.

“Oh,” Bast said happily as he gazed up

at her. His eyes were slightly dazed.

“You’re so much lovelier than I’d

imagined.”

He lifted a hand as if to brush her

cheek, only to find it holding the crown

and knotted handkerchief. “Ahh,” he said,

remembering. “I’ve brought you some

daisies too. And a sweet bun.”

“Thank you,” she said, taking the daisy

crown with both hands. She had to let go

of her shift to do this. It fell lightly to the

grass.

Bast blinked, momentarily at a loss for

words.

Emberlee tilted her head to look at the

crown; the ribbon was a striking

cornflower blue, but it was nothing near

as lovely as her eyes. She lifted it with

both hands and settled it proudly on her

head. Her arms still raised, she drew a

slow breath.

Bast’s eyes slipped from her crown.

She smiled at him indulgently.

Bast drew a breath to speak, then

stopped and drew another through his

nose. Honeysuckle.

“Did you steal my soap?” he asked

incredulously.

Emberlee laughed and kissed him.

A good while later, Bast took the long

way back to the lightning tree, making a

wide loop up into the hills north of town.

Things were rockier up that way, no

ground flat enough to plant, the terrain

too treacherous for grazing.

Even with the boy’s directions, it took

Bast a while to find Martin’s still. He

had to give the crazy old bastard credit

though.

Between

the

brambles,

rockslides, and fallen trees, there wasn’t

a chance he would have stumbled onto it

accidentally, tucked back into a shallow

cave in a scrubby little box valley.

The

still

wasn’t

some

slipshod

contraption bunged together out of old

pots and twisted wire, either. It was a

work of art. There were barrels and

basins and great spirals of copper tube.

A great copper kettle twice the size of a

washbin, and a smolder-stove for

warming it. A wooden trough ran all

along the ceiling, and only after

following it outside did Bast realize

Martin collected rainwater and brought it

inside to fill his cooling barrels.

Looking it over, Bast had the sudden

urge to flip through Celum Tinture and

learn what all the different pieces of the

still were called, what they were for.

Only then did he realize he’d left the

book back at the lightning tree.

So instead Bast rooted around until he

found a box filled with a mad miscellany

of containers: two dozen bottles of all

sorts, clay jugs, old canning jars … A

dozen of them were full. None of them

were labeled in any way.

Bast lifted out a tall bottle that had

obviously once held wine. He pulled the

cork, sniffed it gingerly, then took a

careful sip. His face bloomed into a

sunrise of delight. He’d half expected

turpentine, but this was … well … he

wasn’t sure entirely. He took another

drink. There was something of apples

about it, and … barley?

Bast took a third drink, grinning.

Whatever you care to call it, it was

lovely. Smooth and strong and just a little

sweet. Martin might mad as a badger, but

he clearly knew his liquor.

It was better than an hour before Bast

made it back to the lightning tree. Rike

hadn’t returned, but Celum Tinture was

sitting there unharmed. For the first time

he could remember, he was glad to see

the book. He flipped it open to the

chapter on distillation and read for half

an hour, nodding to himself at various

points. It was called a condensate coil.

He’d thought it looked important.

Eventually he closed the book and

sighed. There were a few clouds rolling

in, and no good could come of leaving

the book unattended again. His luck

wouldn’t last forever, and he shuddered

to think what would happen if the wind

tumbled the book into the grass and tore

the pages. If there was a sudden rain …

So Bast wandered back to the

Waystone Inn and slipped silently

through

the

back

door.

Stepping

carefully, he opened a cupboard and

tucked the book inside. He made his

silent way halfway back to the door

before he heard footsteps behind him.

“Ah, Bast,” the innkeeper said. “Have

you brought the carrots?”

Bast

froze,

caught

awkwardly

midsneak. He straightened up and

brushed self-consciously at his clothes.

“I … I haven’t quite got round to that yet,

Reshi.”

The innkeeper gave a deep sigh. “I

don’t ask a …” He stopped and sniffed,

then eyed the dark-haired man narrowly.

“Are you drunk, Bast?”

Bast looked affronted. “Reshi!”

The innkeeper rolled his eyes. “Fine

then, have you been drinking?”

“I’ve been investigating, ” Bast said,

emphasizing the word. “Did you know

Crazy Martin runs a still?”

“I didn’t,” the innkeeper said, his tone

making it clear he didn’t find this

information to be particularly thrilling.

“And Martin isn’t crazy. He just has a

handful of unfortunately strong affect

compulsions. And a touch of tabard

madness from when he was a soldier.”

“Well, yes …” Bast said slowly. “I

know, because he set his dog on me and

when I climbed a tree to get away, he

tried to chop the tree down. But also,

aside from those things, he’s crazy too,

Reshi. Really, really crazy.”

“Bast.” The innkeeper gave him a

chiding look.

“I’m not saying he’s bad, Reshi. I’m not

even saying I don’t like him. But trust me.

I know crazy. His head isn’t put together

like a normal person’s.”

The innkeeper gave an agreeable if

slightly impatient nod. “Noted.”

Bast opened his mouth, then looked

slightly confused. “What were we talking

about?”

“Your advanced state of investigation,”

the innkeeper said, glancing out the

window. “Despite the fact that it is

barely three bells.”

“Ah. Right!” Bast said excitedly. “I

know Martin’s been running a tab for the

better part of a year now. And I know

you’ve had trouble settling up because he

doesn’t have any money.”

“He doesn’t use money,” the innkeeper

corrected gently.

“Same difference, Reshi,” Bast sighed.

“And it doesn’t change the fact that we

don’t need another sack of barley. The

pantry is choking on barley. But since he

runs a still …”

The innkeeper was already shaking his

head. “No, Bast,” he said. “I won’t go

poisoning my customers with hillwine.

You have no idea what ends up in that

stuff …”

“But I do know, Reshi,” Bast said

plaintively. “Ethel acetates and methans.

And tinleach. There’s none of that.”

The innkeeper blinked, obviously taken

aback. “Did … Have you actually been

reading Celum Tinture?”

“I did, Reshi.” Bast beamed. “For the

betterment of my education and my desire

to not poison folk. I tasted some, Reshi,

and I can say with some authority that

Martin is not making hillwine. It’s lovely

stuff. It’s halfway to Rhis, and that’s not

something I say lightly.”

The innkeeper stroked his upper lip

thoughtfully. “Where did you get some to

taste?” he asked.

“I traded for it,” Bast said, easily

skirting the edges of the truth. “I was

thinking,” Bast continued. “Not only

would it give Martin a chance to settle

his tab. But it would help us get some

new stock in. That’s harder, the roads as

bad as they are …”

The innkeeper held up both hands

helplessly. “I’m already convinced,

Bast.”

Bast grinned happily.

“Honestly, I would have done it merely

to celebrate you reading your lesson for

once. But it will be nice for Martin, too.

It will give him an excuse to come by

more often. It will be good for him.”

Bast’s smile faded a bit.

If the innkeeper noticed, he didn’t

comment on it. “I’ll send a boy round to

Martin’s and ask him to come by with a

couple bottles.”

“Get five or six,” Bast said. “It’s

getting cold at night. Winter’s coming.”

The innkeeper smiled. “I’m sure Martin

will be flattered.”

Bast paled at that. “By all the gorse no,

Reshi,” he said, waving his hands in

front of himself and taking a step

backwards. “Don’t tell him I’ll be

drinking it. He hates me.”

The innkeeper hid a smile behind his

hand.

“It’s not funny, Reshi,” Bast said

angrily. “He throws rocks at me.”

“Not for months,” the innkeeper pointed

out. “Martin has been perfectly cordial to

you the last several times he’s stopped

by for a visit.”

“Because there aren’t any rocks inside

the inn,” Bast said.

“Be

fair,

Bast,”

the

innkeeper

continued. “He’s been civil for almost a

year.

Polite

even.

Remember

he

apologized to you two months back?

Have you heard of Martin ever

apologizing to anyone else in town?

Ever?”

“No,” Bast said sulkily.

The innkeeper nodded. “That’s a big

gesture for him. He’s turning a new leaf.”

“I know,” Bast muttered, moving

toward the back door. “But if he’s here

when I get home tonight, I’m eating

dinner in the kitchen.”

Rike caught up with Bast before he even

made it to the clearing, let alone the

lightning tree.

“I’ve got it,” the boy said, holding up

his hand triumphantly. The entire lower

half of his body was dripping wet.

“What, already?” Bast asked.

The boy nodded and flourished the

stone between two fingers. It was flat

and smooth and round, slightly bigger

than a copper penny. “What now?”

Bast stroked his chin for a moment, as

if trying to remember. “Now we need a

needle. But it has to be borrowed from a

house where no men live.”

Rike looked thoughtful for a moment,

then brightened. “I can get one from Aunt

Sellie!”

Bast fought the urge to curse. He’d

forgotten about Sellie. “That will do …”

he said, reluctantly, “but it will work

best if the needle comes from a house

with a lot of women living in it. The

more women the better.”

Rike looked up for another moment.

“Widow Creel then. She’s got a

daughter.”

“She’s got a boy, too.” Bast pointed

out. “A house where no men or boys

live.”

“But where a lot of girls live …” Rike

said. He had to think about it for a long

while. “Old Nan don’t like me none,” he

said. “But I reckon she’d give me a pin.”

“A needle,” Bast stressed. “And you

have to borrow it. You can’t steal it or

buy it. She has to lend it to you.”

Bast had half expected the boy to

grouse about the particulars, about the

fact that Old Nan lived all the way off on

the other side of town, about as far west

as you could go and still be considered

part of the town. It would take him half

an hour to get there, and even then, Old

Nan might not be home.

But Rike didn’t so much as sigh. He just

nodded seriously, turned, and took off at

a sprint, bare feet flying.

Bast continued to the lightning tree, but

when he came to the clearing he saw an

entire tangle of children playing on the

greystone, doubtless waiting for him.

Four of them.

Watching them from the shadow of the

trees at the edge of the clearing, Bast

hesitated, then glanced up at the sun

before slipping back into the woods. He

had other fish to fry.

The Williams farm wasn’t a farm in any

proper sense. Not for decades. The fields

had gone fallow so long ago that they

were barely recognizable as such,

spotted with brambles and sapling trees.

The tall barn had fallen into disrepair

and half the roof gaped open to the sky.

Walking up the long path through the

fields, Bast turned a corner and saw

Rike’s house. It told a different story than

the barn. It was small but tidy. The

shingles needed some repair, but other

than that, it looked well loved and

tended-to. Yellow curtains were blowing

out the kitchen window, and there was

flower box spilling over with fox fiddle

and marigold.

There was a pen with a trio of goats on

one side of the house, and a large well-

tended garden on the other. It was fenced

thickly with lashed-together sticks, but

Bast could see straight lines of

flourishing greenery inside. Carrots. He

still needed carrots.

Craning his neck a bit, Bast saw

several large, square boxes behind the

house. He took a few more steps to the

side and eyed them before he realized

they were beehives.

Just then there was a great storm of

barking and two great black, floppy-

eared dogs came bounding from the

house toward Bast, baying for all they

were worth. When they came close

enough, Bast got down on one knee and

wrestled with them playfully, scratching

their ears and the ruff of their necks.

After a few minutes of this, Bast

continued to the house, the dogs weaving

back and forth in front of him before they

spotted some sort of animal and tore off

into the underbrush. He knocked politely

at the front door, though after all the

barking his presence could hardly be a

surprise.

The door opened a couple inches, and

for a moment all Bast could see was a

slender slice of darkness. Then the door

opened a little wider, revealing Rike’s

mother. She was tall, and her curling

brown hair was springing loose from the

braid that hung down her back.

She swung the door fully open, holding

a tiny, half-naked baby in the curve of her

arm. Its round face was pressed into her

breast and it was sucking busily, making

small grunting noises.

Glancing down, Bast smiled warmly.

The woman looked fondly down at her

child, then favored Bast with a tired

smile. “Hello Bast, what can I do for

you?”

“Ah. Well,” he said awkwardly, pulling

his gaze up to meet her eye. “I was

wondering, ma’am. That is, Mrs.

Williams—”

“Nettie is fine, Bast,” she said

indulgently. More than a few of the

townfolk considered Bast somewhat

simple in the head, a fact that Bast didn’t

mind in the least.

“Nettie,” Bast said, smiling his most

ingratiating smile.

There was a pause, and she leaned

against the doorframe. A little girl

peeked out from around the woman’s

faded blue skirt, nothing more than a pair

of serious dark eyes.

Bast

smiled

at

the

girl,

who

disappeared back behind her mother.

Nettie looked at Bast expectantly.

Finally she prompted. “You were

wondering …”

“Oh, yes.” Bast said. “I was wondering

if your husband happened to be about.”

“I’m afraid not,” she said. “Jessom’s

off checking his traps.”

“Ah,” Bast said, disappointed. “Will he

be back anytime soon? I’d be happy to

wait …”

She shook her head, “I’m sorry. He’ll

do his lines then spend the night skinning

and drying up in his shack.” She nodded

vaguely toward the northern hills.

“Ah,” Bast said again.

Nestled snugly in her mother’s arm, the

baby drew a deep breath, then sighed it

out blissfully, going quiet and limp.

Nettie looked down, then up at Bast,

holding a finger to her lips.

Bast nodded and stepped back from the

doorway, watching as Nettie stepped

inside, deftly detached the sleeping baby

from her nipple with her free hand, then

carefully tucked the child into a small

wooden cradle on the floor. The dark-

eyed girl emerged from behind her

mother and went to peer down at the

baby.

“Call me if she starts to fuss,” Nettie

said softly. The little girl nodded

seriously, sat down on a nearby chair,

and began to gently rock the cradle with

her foot.

Nettie stepped outside, closing the door

behind her. She walked the few steps

necessary to join Bast, rearranging her

bodice unself-consciously. In the sunlight

Bast noticed her high cheekbones and

generous mouth. Even so, she was more

tired than pretty, her dark eyes heavy

with worry.

The tall woman crossed her arms over

her chest. “What’s the trouble then?” she

asked wearily.

Bast looked confused. “No trouble,” he

said. “I was wondering if your husband

had any work.”

Nettie uncrossed her arms, looking

surprised. “Oh.”

“There isn’t much for me to do at the

inn,” Bast said a little sheepishly. “I

thought your husband might need an extra

hand.”

Nettie looked around, eyes brushing

over the old barn. Her mouth tugging

down at the corners. “He traps and hunts

for the most part these days,” she said.

“Keeps him busy, but not so much that

he’d need help, I imagine.” She looked

back to Bast. “At least he’s never made

mention of wanting any.”

“How about yourself?” Bast asked,

giving his most charming smile. “Is there

anything around the place you could use a

hand with?”

Nettie smiled at Bast indulgently. It was

only a small smile, but it stripped ten

years and half a world of worry off her face, making her practically shine with

loveliness. “There isn’t much to do,” she

said apologetically. “Only three goats,

and my boy minds them.”

“Firewood?” Bast asked. “I’m not

afraid to work up a sweat. And it has to

be hard getting by with your gentleman

gone for days on end …” He grinned at

her hopefully.

“And we just haven’t got the money for

help, I’m afraid.” Nettie said.

“I just want some carrots,” Bast said.

Nettie looked at him for a minute, then

burst out laughing. “Carrots,” she said,

rubbing at her face. “How many

carrots?”

“Maybe … six?” Bast asked, not

sounding very sure of his answer at all.

She laughed again, shaking her head a

little. “Okay. You can split some wood.”

She pointed to the chopping block that

stood in back of the house. “I’ll come get

you when you’ve done six carrots’

worth.”

Bast set to work eagerly, and soon the

yard was full of the crisp, healthy sound

of splitting wood. The sun was still

strong in the sky, and after just a few

minutes Bast was covered in a sheen of

sweat. He carelessly peeled away his

shirt and hung it on the nearby garden

fence.

There was something different about the

way he split the wood. Nothing dramatic.

In fact he split wood the same way

everyone did: you set the log upright, you

swing the axe, you split the wood. There

isn’t much room to extemporize.

But still, there was a difference in the

way he did it. When he set the log

upright, he moved intently. Then he

would stand for a tiny moment, perfectly

still. Then came the swing. It was a fluid

thing. The placement of his feet, the play

of the long muscles in his arms …

There

was

nothing

exaggerated.

Nothing like a flourish. Even so, when he

brought the axe up and over in a perfect

arc, there was a grace to it. The sharp

cough the wood made as it split, the

sudden way the halves went tumbling to

the ground. He made it all look somehow

… well … dashing.

He worked a hard half hour, at which

time Nettie came out of the house,

carrying a glass of water and a handful of

fat carrots with the loose greens still

attached. “I’m sure that’s at least six

carrots’ worth of work,” she said,

smiling at him.

Bast took the glass of water, drank half

of it, then bent over and poured the rest

over his head. He shook himself off a bit,

then stood back up, his dark hair curling

and clinging to his face. “Are you sure

there’s nothing else you could use a hand

with?” he asked, giving her an easy grin.

His eyes were dark and smiling and

bluer than the sky.

Nettie shook her head. Her hair was out

of her braid now, and when she looked

down, the loose curls of it fell partly

across her face. “I can’t think of

anything,” she said.

“I’m a dab hand with honey, too,” Bast

said, hoisting the axe to rest against his

naked shoulder.

She looked a little puzzled at that until

Bast nodded toward the wooden hives

scattered through the overgrown field.

“Oh,” she said, as if remembering a half-

forgotten dream. “I used to do candles

and honey. But we lost a few hives to

that bad winter three years back. Then

one to nits. Then there was that wet

spring and three more went down with

the chalk before we even knew.” She

shrugged. “Early this summer we sold

one to the Hestles so we’d have money

for the levy …”

She shook her head again, as if she’d

been daydreaming. She shrugged and

turned back to look at Bast. “Do you

know about bees?”

“A fair bit,” Bast said softly. “They

aren’t hard to handle. They just need

patience and gentleness.” He casually

swung the axe so it stuck in the nearby

stump. “They’re the same as everything

else, really. They just want to know

they’re safe.”

Nettie was looking out at the field,

nodding along with Bast’s words

unconsciously. “There’s only the two

left,” she said. “Enough for a few

candles. A little honey. Not much. Hardly

worth the bother, really.”

“Oh come now,” Bast said gently. “A

little sweetness is all any of us have

sometimes. It’s always worth it. Even if

it takes some work.”

Nettie turned to look at him. She met his

eyes now. Not speaking, but not looking

away either. Her eyes were like an open

door.

Bast smiled, gentle and patient, his

voice was warm and sweet as honey. He

held out his hand. “Come with me,” he

said. “I have something to show you.”

The sun was starting to sink toward the western trees by the time Bast returned to

the lightning tree. He was limping

slightly, and he had dirt in his hair, but he

seemed to be in good spirits.

There were two children at the bottom

of the hill, sitting on the greystone and

swinging their feet as if it were a huge

stone bench. Bast didn’t even have time

to sit down before they came up the hill

together.

It was Wilk, a serious boy of ten with

shaggy blond hair. At his side was his

little sister Pem, half his age with three

times the mouth.

The boy nodded at Bast as he came to

the top of the hill, then he looked down.

“You hurt your hand,” he said.

Bast looked down at his hand and was

surprised to see a few dark streaks of

blood dripping down the side of it. He

brought out his handkerchief and daubed

at it.

“What happened?” little Pem asked

him.

“I was attacked by a bear,” he lied

nonchalantly.

The boy nodded, giving no indication of

whether or not he believed it was true. “I

need a riddle that will stump Tessa,” the

boy said. “A good one.”

“You

smell

like

granda,”

Pem

chirruped as she came up to stand beside

her brother.

Wilk ignored her. Bast did the same.

“Okay,” said Bast. “I need a favor, I’ll

trade you. A favor for a riddle.”

“You smell like granda when he’s been

at his medicine,” Pem clarified.

“It has to be a good one though,” Wilk

stressed. “A stumper.”

“Show me something that’s never been

seen before and will never be seen

again,” Bast said.

“Hmmm …” Wilk said, looking

thoughtful.

“Granda says he feels loads better with

his medicine,” Pem said, louder, plainly

irritated at being ignored. “But Mum says

it’s not medicine. She says he’s on the

bottle. And granda says he feels loads

better so it’s medicine by dammit.” She

looked back and forth between Bast and

Wilk, as if daring them to scold her.

Neither of them did. She looked a little

crestfallen.

“That is a good one,” Wilk admitted at

last. “What’s the answer?”

Bast gave a slow grin. “What will you

trade me for it?”

Wilk cocked his head on one side, “I

already said. A favor.”

“I traded you the riddle for a favor,”

Bast said easily. “But now you’re asking

for the answer …”

Wilk looked confused for half a

moment, then his face went red and

angry. He drew a deep breath as if he

were going to shout. Then seemed to

think better of it and stormed down the

hill, stomping his feet.

His sister watched him go, then turned

back to Bast. “Your shirt is ripped,” she

said disapprovingly. “And you’ve got

grass stains on your pants. Your mam is

going to give you a hiding.”

“No she won’t,” Bast said smugly.

“Because I’m all grown, and I can do

whatever I want with my pants. I could

light them on fire and I wouldn’t get in

any trouble at all.”

The little girl stared at him with

smoldering envy.

Wilk stomped back up the hill. “Fine,”

he said sullenly.

“My favor first,” Bast said. He handed

the boy a small bottle with a cork in the

top. “I need you to fill this up with water

that’s been caught midair.”

“What?” Wilk said.

“Naturally falling water,” Bast said.

“You can’t dip it out of a barrel or a

stream. You have to catch it while it’s

still in the air.”

“Water falls out of a pump when you

pump it …” Wilk said without any real

hope in his voice.

“Naturally falling water,” Bast said

again, stressing the first word. “It’s no

good if someone just stands on a chair

and pours it out of a bucket.”

“What do you need it for?” Pem asked

in her little piping voice.

“What will you trade me for the answer

to that question?” Bast said.

The little girl went pale and slapped

one hand across her mouth.

“It might not rain for days, ” Wilk said.

Pem gave a gusty sigh. “It doesn’t have

to be rain,” his sister said, her voice

dripping with condescension. “You

could just go to the waterfall by

Littlecliff and fill the bottle there.”

Wilk blinked.

Bast grinned at her. “You’re a clever

girl.”

She rolled her eyes, “Everybody says

that …”

Bast brought out something from his

pocket and held it. It was a green

cornhusk wrapped around a daub of

sticky honeycomb. The little girl’s eyes

lit up when she saw it.

“I also need twenty-one perfect

acorns,” he said. “No holes, with all

their little hats intact. If you gather them

for me over by the waterfall, I’ll give

you this.”

She nodded eagerly. Then both she and

her brother hurried down the hill.

Bast went back down to the pool by the

spreading willow and took another bath.

It wasn’t his usual bathing time, so there

were no birds waiting, and as a result the

bath was much more matter-of-fact than

before.

He quickly rinsed himself clean of

sweat and honey and he daubed a bit at

his clothes too, scrubbing to get rid of the





grass stains and the smell of whiskey.

The cold water stung the cuts on his

knuckles a bit, but they were nothing

serious and would mend well enough on

their own.

Naked and dripping, he pulled himself

from the pool and found a dark rock, hot

from the long day of sun. He draped his

clothes over it and let them bake dry

while he shook his hair dry and stripped

the water from his arms and chest with

his hands.

Then he made his way back to the

lightning tree, picked a long piece of

grass

to

chew

on,

and

almost

immediately fell asleep in the golden

afternoon sunlight.

Evening: Lessons

Hours later, the evening shadows

stretched to cover Bast, and he shivered

himself awake.

He sat up, rubbing his face and looking

around blearily. The sun was just

beginning to brush the tops of the western

trees. Wilk and Pem hadn’t returned, but

that was hardly a surprise. He ate the

piece of honeycomb he’d promised Pem,

licking his fingers slowly. Then he

chewed the wax idly and watched a pair

of hawks turn lazy circles in the sky.

Eventually he heard a whistle from the

trees. He got to his feet and stretched, his

body bending like a bow. Then he

sprinted down the hill … except, in the

fading light it didn’t quite look like a

sprint.

If he were a boy of ten, it would have

looked like skipping. But he was no boy.

If he were a goat, it would have looked like he were prancing. But he was no

goat. A man headed down the hill that

quickly, it would have looked like he

were running.

But there was something odd about

Bast’s motion in the fading light.

Something hard to describe. He almost

looked

like

he

were

…

what?

Frolicking? Dancing?

Small matter. Suffice to say that he

quickly made his way to the edge of the

clearing where Rike stood in the growing

dark beneath the trees.

“I’ve got it,” the boy said triumphantly,

he held up his hand, but the needle was

invisible in the dark.

“You borrowed it?” Bast asked. “Not

traded or bargained for it?”

Rike nodded.

“Okay,” Bast said. “Follow me.”

The two of them walked over to the

greystone, Rike following wordlessly

when Bast climbed up one side of the

half-fallen stone. The sunlight was still

strong there, and both of them had plenty

of space to stand on the broad back of the

tilted greystone. Rike looked around

anxiously, as if worried someone might

see him.

“Let’s see the stone,” Bast said.

Rike dug into his pocket and held it out

to Bast.

Bast pulled his hand back suddenly, as

if the boy had tried to hand him a

glowing coal. “Don’t be stupid,” he

snapped. “It’s not for me. The charm is

only going to work for one person. Do

you want that to be me?”

The boy brought his hand back and eyed

the stone. “What do you mean one

person?”

“It’s the way of charms,” Bast said.

“They only work for one person at a

time.” Seeing the boy’s confusion written

plainly on his face, Bast sighed. “You

know how some girls make come-hither

charms, hoping to catch a boy’s eye?”

Rike nodded, blushing a little.

“This is the opposite,” Bast said. “It’s a

go-thither charm. You’re going to prick

your finger, get a drop of your blood on

it, and that will seal it. It will make

things go away.”

Rike looked down at the stone. “What

sort of things?” he said.

“Anything that wants to hurt you,” Bast

said easily. “You can just keep it in your

pocket, or you can get a piece of cord—”

“It will make my da leave?” Rike

interrupted.

Bast frowned. “That’s what I said.

You’re his blood. So it will push him

away more strongly than anything else.

You’ll probably want to hang it around

your neck so—”

“What about a bear?” Rike asked,

looking at the stone thoughtfully. “Would

it make a bear leave me alone?”

Bast made a back-and-forth motion

with his hand. “Wild things are

different,” he said. “They’re possessed

of pure desire. They don’t want to hurt

you. They usually want food, or safety. A

bear would—”

“Can I give it to my mum?” Rike

interrupted again, looking up at Bast. His

dark eyes serious.

“… want to protect its terr … What?”

Bast stumbled to a halt.

“My mum should have it,” Rike said.

“What if I was off away with the charm

and my da came back?”

“He’s going farther away than that,”

Bast said, his voice thick with certainty.

“It’s not like he’ll be hiding around the

corner at the smithy …”

Rike’s face was set now, his pug nose

making him seem all the more stubborn.

He shook his head. “She should have it.

She’s important. She has to take care of

Tess and little Bip.”

“It will work just fine—”

“It’s got to be for HER!” Rike shouted,

his hand making a fist around the stone.

“You said it could be for one person, so

you make it be for her!”

Bast scowled at the boy darkly. “I don’t

like your tone,” he said grimly. “You

asked me to make your da go away. And

that’s what I’m doing …”

“But what if it’s not enough?” Rike’s

face was red.

“It will be,” Bast said, absentmindedly

rubbing his thumb across the knuckles of

his hand. “He’ll go far away. You have

my word—”

“NO!” Rike said, his face going red and

angry. “What if sending him isn’t

enough? What if I grow up like my da? I

get so …” His voice choked off, and his

eyes started to leak tears. “I’m not good.

I know it. I know better than anyone. Like

you said. I got his blood in me. She needs

to be safe from me. If I grow up twisted

up and bad, she needs the charm to …

she needs something to make me go a—”

Rike clenched his teeth, unable to

continue.

Bast reached out and took hold of the

boy’s shoulder. He was stiff and rigid as

a plank of wood, but Bast gathered him

in and put his arms around his shoulders.

Gently, because he had seen the boy’s

back. They stood there for a long

moment, Rike stiff and tight as a

bowstring, trembling like a sail tight

against the wind.

“Rike,” Bast said softly. “You’re a

good boy. Do you know that?”

The boy bent then, sagged against Bast

and seemed like he would break himself

apart with sobbing. His face was pressed

into Bast’s stomach and he said

something, but it was muffled and

disjointed. Bast made a soft crooning

sound of the sort you’d use to calm a

horse or soothe a hive of restless bees.

The storm passed, and Rike stepped

quickly away and scrubbed at his face

roughly with his sleeve. The sky was just

starting to tinge red with sunset.

“Right,” Bast said. “It’s time. We’ll

make it for your mother. You’ll have to

give it to her. River stone works best if

it’s given as a gift.”

Rike nodded, not looking up. “What if

she won’t wear it?” he asked quietly.

Bast blinked, confused. “She’ll wear it

because you gave it to her,” he said.

“What if she doesn’t?” he asked.

Bast opened his mouth, then hesitated

and closed it again. He looked up and

saw the first of twilight’s stars emerge.

He looked down at the boy. He sighed.

He wasn’t good at this.

So much was so easy. Glamour was

second nature. It was just making folk see

what they wanted to see. Fooling folk

was simple as singing. Tricking folk and

telling lies, it was like breathing.

But this? Convincing someone of the

truth that they were too twisted to see?

How could you even begin?

It was baffling. These creatures. They

were fraught and frayed in their desire. A

snake would never poison itself, but

these folk made an art of it. They

wrapped themselves in fears and wept at

being blind. It was infuriating. It was

enough to break a heart.

So Bast took the easy way. “It’s part of

the magic,” he lied. “When you give it to

her, you have to tell her that you made it

for her because you love her.”

The boy looked uncomfortable, as if he

were trying to swallow a stone.

“It’s essential for the magic,” Bast said

firmly. “And then, if you want to make

the magic stronger, you need to tell her

every day. Once in the morning and once

at night.”

The boy nodded, a determined look on

his face. “Okay. I can do that.”

“Right then,” Bast said. “Sit down here.

Prick your finger.”

Rike did just that. He jabbed his stubby

finger and let a bead of blood well up

then fall onto the stone.

“Good,” Bast said, sitting down across

from the boy. “Now give me the needle.”

Rike handed over the needle. “But you

said it just needed—”

“Don’t tell me what I said,” Bast

groused. “Hold the stone flat so that the

hole faces up.”

Rike did.

“Hold it steady,” Bast said, and pricked

his own finger. A slow bead of blood

grew. “Don’t move.”

Rike braced the stone with his other

hand.

Bast turned his finger, and the drop of

blood hung in the air for a moment before

falling straight through the hole to strike

the greystone underneath.

There was no sound. No stirring in the

air. No distant thunder. If anything, it

seemed there was a half second of

perfect brick-heavy silence in the air. But

it was probably nothing more than a brief

pause in the wind.

“Is that it?” Rike asked after a moment,

clearly expecting something more.

“Yup,” Bast said, licking the blood

from his finger with a red, red tongue.

Then he worked his mouth a little and

spat out the wax he had been chewing.

He rolled it between his fingers and

handed it to the boy. “Rub this into the

stone, then take it to the top of the highest

hill you can find. Stay there until the last

of the sunset fades, and then give to her

tonight.”

Rike’s eyes darted around the horizon,

looking for a good hill. Then he leapt

from the stone and sprinted off.

Bast was halfway back to the Waystone

Inn when he realized he had no idea

where his carrots were.

When Bast came in the back door, he

could smell bread and beer and

simmering stew. Looking around the

kitchen he saw crumbs on the breadboard

and the lid was off the kettle. Dinner had

already been served.

Stepping softly, he peered through the

door into the common room. The usual

folk sat hunched at the bar, there was Old

Cob and Graham, scraping their bowls.

The smith’s prentice was running bread

along the inside of his bowl, then stuffing

it into his mouth a piece at time. Jake

spread butter on the last slice of bread,

and Shep knocked his empty mug politely

against the bar, the hollow sound a

question in itself.

Bast bustled through the doorway with

a fresh bowl of stew for the smith’s

prentice as the innkeeper poured Shep

more beer. Collecting the empty bowl,

Bast disappeared back into the kitchen,

then he came back with another loaf of

bread half-sliced and steaming.

“Guess what I caught wind of today?”

Old Cob said with the grin of a man who

knew he had the freshest news at the

table.

“What’s that?” The boy asked around

half a mouthful of stew.

Cob reached out and took the heel of

the bread, a right he claimed as the oldest

person there, despite the fact that he

wasn’t actually the oldest, and the fact

that nobody else much cared for the heel.

Bast suspected he took it because he was

proud he still had so many teeth left.

Cob grinned. “Guess,” he said to the

boy, then slowly slathered his bread with

butter and took a big bite.

“I reckon it’s something about Jessom

Williams,” Jake said blithely.

Old Cob glared at him, his mouth full of

bread and butter.

“What I heard,” Jake drawled slowly,

smiling as Old Cob tried furiously chew

his mouth clear, “was that Jessom was

out running his traplines and he got

jumped by a cougar. Then while he was

legging it away, he lost track of hisself

and went right over Littlecliff. Busted

himself up something fierce.”

Old Cob finally managed to swallow.

“You’re thick as a post, Jacob Walker.

That ain’t what happened at all. He fell

off Littlecliff, but there weren’t a cougar.

Cougar ain’t going to attack a full-grown

man.”

“It will if he’s all smelling of blood,”

Jake insisted. “Which Jessom was, on

account of the fact that he was baggin’ up

all his game.”

There was a muttering of agreement at

this, which obviously irritated Old Cob.

“It weren’t a cougar,” he insisted. “He

was drunk off his feet. That’s what I

heard. Stumbling-lost drunk. That’s the

only sense of it. ’Cause Littlecliff ent

nowhere near his trapline. Unless you

think a cougar chased him for almost a

mile …”

Old Cob sat back in his chair then,

smug as a judge. Everyone knew Jessom

was a bit of a drinker. And while

Littlecliff wasn’t really a mile from the

Williams’s land, it was too far to be

chased by a cougar.

Jake glared venomously at Old Cob, but

before he could say anything Graham

chimed in. “I heard it was drink too. A

couple kids found him while they were

playing by the falls. They thought he was

dead, and ran to fetch the constable. But

he was just head-struck and drunk as a

lord. There was all manner of broken

glass too. He was cut him up some.”

Old Cob threw his hands up in the air.

“Well ain’t that wonderful!” he said,

scowling back and forth between Graham

and Jake. “Any other parts of my story

you’d like to tell afore I’m finished?”

Graham looked taken aback. “I thought

you were—”

“I wasn’t finished,” Cob said, as if

talking to a simpleton. “I was reelin’ it

out slow. I swear. What you folk don’t

know about tellin’ stories would fit into

a book.”

A tense silence settled among the

friends.

“I got some news too,” the smith’s

prentice said almost shyly. He sat

slightly hunched at the bar, as if

embarrassed at being a head taller than

everyone else and twice as broad across

the shoulders. “If’n nobody else has

heard it, that is.”

Shep spoke up. “Go on, boy. You don’t

have to ask. Those two just been gnawing

on each other for years. They don’t mean

anything by it.”

“Well I was doing shoes,” the prentice

said, “when Crazy Martin came in.” The

boy shook his head in amazement and

took a long drink of beer. “I ain’t only

seen him a few times in town, and I

forgot how big he is. I don’t have to look

up to see him. But I still think he’s

biggern me. And today he looked even

bigger still ’cause he was furious. He

was spittin’ nails. I swear. He looked

like someone had tied two angry bulls

together and made them wear a shirt!”

The boy laughed the easy laugh of

someone who’s had a little more beer

than he’s used to.

There was a pause. “What’s the news

then?” Shep said gently, giving him a

nudge.

“Oh!” the smith’s prentice said. “He

came asking Master Ferris if he had

enough copper to mend a big kettle.” The

prentice spread his long arms out wide,

one hand almost smacking Shep in the

face.

“Apparently someone found Martin’s

still.” The smith’s prentice leaned

forward, wobbling slightly, and said in

hushed voice. “Stole a bunch of his drink

and wrecked up the place a bit.”

The boy leaned back in his chair and

crossed his arms proudly across his

chest, confident of a story well told.

But there was none of the buzz that

normally accompanied a piece of good

gossip. He took another drink of beer,

and slowly began to look confused.

“Tehlu anyway,” Graham said, his face

gone pale. “Martin’ll kill him.”

“What?” the prentice said. “Who?”

“Jessom, you tit,” Jake snapped. He

tried to cuff the boy on the back of his

head and had to settle for his shoulder

instead. “The fellow who got skunk

drunk in the middle of the day and fell off

a cliff carrying a bunch of bottles?”

“I thought it was a cougar,” Old Cob

said spitefully.

“He’ll wish it was ten cougars when

Martin gets him,” Jake said grimly.

“What?” The smith’s prentice laughed.

“Crazy Martin? He’s addled, sure, but he

a i n’ t mean. A couple span ago he

cornered me and talked bollocks about

barley for two hours.” He laughed again.

“About how it was healthful. How wheat

would ruin a man. How money was dirty.

How it chained you to the earth or some

nonsense.”

The prentice dropped his voice and

hunched his shoulders a bit, widening his

eyes and doing a passable Crazy Martin

impression. “You know? ” he said,

making his voice rough and darting his

eyes around. “Yeah. You know. You hear

what I’m sayin? ”

The prentice laughed again, rocking

back on his stool. He had obviously had

a little more beer than was good for him.

“People think they have to be afraid of

big folk, but they don’t. I’ve never hit a

man in my life.”

Everyone just stared at him. Their eyes

were deadly earnest.

“Martin killed one of Ensal’s dogs for

growling at him,” Shep said. “Right in

the middle of market. Threw a shovel

like it was a spear. Then gave it a

kicking.”

“Nearly killed that last priest,” Graham

said. “The one before Abbe Leodin.

Nobody knows why. Fellow went up to

Martin’s house. That evening Martin

brought him to town in a wheelbarrow

and left him in front of the church.” He

looked at the smith’s prentice. “That was

before your time though. Makes sense

you wouldn’t know.”

“Punched a tinker once,” Jake said.

“Punched a tinker? ” the innkeeper

burst out, incredulous.

“Reshi,” Bast said gently. “Martin is

fucking crazy. ”

Jake nodded. “Even the levy man

doesn’t go up to Martin’s place.”

Cob looked like he was going to call

Jake out again, then decided to take a

gentler tone. “Well yes,” he said. “True

enough. But that’s ’cause Martin pulled

his full rail in the king’s army. Eight

years.”

“And came back mad as a frothing

dog,” Shep said.

Old Cob was already off his stool and

halfway to the door. “Enough talk. We

got to let Jessom know. If he can get out

of town until Martin cools down a bit

…”

“So … when he’s dead?” Jake said

sharply. “Remember when he threw a

horse through the window of the old inn

because the barman wouldn’t give him

another beer?”

“ A tinker?” the innkeeper repeated,

sounding no less shocked than before.

Silence descended at the sound of

footsteps on the landing. Everyone eyed

the door and went still as stone, except

for Bast, who slowly edged toward the

doorway to the kitchen.

Everyone breathed a huge sigh of relief

when the door opened to reveal the tall,

slim shape of Carter. He closed the door

behind him, not noticing the tension in the

room. “Guess who’s standing a round of

bottle whiskey for everyone tonight?” he

called out cheerfully, then stopped where

he stood, confused by the roomful of grim

expressions.

Old Cob started to walk to the door

again, motioning for his friend to follow.

“Come on Carter, we’ll explain on the

way. We’ve got to find Jessom double

quick.”

“You’ll have a long ride to find him,”

Carter said. “I drove him all the way to

Baden this afternoon.”

Everyone in the room seemed to relax,

“That’s why you’re so late,” Graham

said, his voice thick with relief. He

slumped back onto his stool and tapped

the bar hard with a knuckle. Bast drew

him another beer.

Carter frowned. “Not so late as all

that,” he groused. “I’d like to see you

make it all the way to Baden and back in

this time, that’s more’n forty miles …”

Old Cob put a hand on the man’s

shoulder. “Nah. It ain’t like that,” he

said, steering his friend toward the bar.

“We were just a little spooked. You

probably

saved

that

damn

fool’s

Jessom’s life by getting him out of town.”

He squinted at him. “Though I’ve told

you you shouldn’t be out on the road by

yourself these days …”

The innkeeper fetched Carter a bowl

while Bast went outside to tend to his

horse. While he ate, his friends told him

the day’s gossip in dribs and drabs.

“Well that explains it,” Carter said.

“Jessom showed up reeking like a rummy

and looking like he’d been beat by

twelve different demons. Paid me to

drive him to the Iron Hall, and he took

the king’s coin right there.” Carter took a

drink of beer. “Then paid me to take him

to Baden straight off. Didn’t want to stop

off at his house for his clothes or

anything.”

“Not much need for that,” Shep said.

“They’ll dress and feed him in the king’s

army.”

Graham let out a huge sigh. “That was a

near miss. Can you imagine what would

happen if the azzie came for Martin?”

Everyone was silent for a moment,

imagining the trouble that would come if

an officer of the Crown’s Law was

assaulted here in town.

The smith’s prentice looked around at

him, “What about Jessom’s family?” he

asked, plainly worried. “Will Martin

come after them?”

The men at the bar shook their head in

concert. “Martin is crazy,” Old Cob said.

“But he’s not that sort. Not to go after a

woman or her wee ones.”

“I heard he punched the tinker because

he was making some advances on young

Jenna,” Graham said.

“There’s truth to that,” Old Cob said

softly. “I saw it.”

Everyone in the room turned to look at

him, surprised. They’d known Cob all

their lives and had heard all his stories.

Even the most boring of them had been

trotted out three or four times over the

long years. The thought that he might

have held something back was … well

… it was almost unthinkable.

“He was getting all handsy with young

Jenna,” Cob said, not looking up from his

beer. “And she was younger still back

then, mind you.” He paused for a

moment, then sighed. “But I was still old,

and … well … I knew that tinker would

give me a hiding if I tried to stop him. I

could see that plain enough on his face.”

The old man sighed. “I ain’t proud of

that.”

Cob looked up with a vicious little

grin. “Then Martin came round the

corner,” he said. “This was off behind

the old Cooper’s place, remember? And

Martin looked at the fellow, and at Jenna,

who wasn’t crying or nothing, but she

obviously wasn’t happy either. And the

tinker has hold of her wrist …”

Cob shook his head. “When he hit him.

It was like a hammer hitting a ham.

Knocked him right out into the street. Ten

feet, give or take. Then Martin eyed

Jenna, who was crying just a bit then.

More surprised than anything. And

Martin stuck the boot in him. Just once.

Not as hard as he could, either. I could

tell he was just settling up accounts in his

head. Like he was a moneylender

shimming up one side of his scale.”

“That fellow wasn’t any kind of proper

tinker,” Jake said. “I remember him.”

“And I heard things about that priest,”

Graham added.

A few of the others nodded wordlessly.

“What if Jessom comes back?” the

smith’s prentice asked. “I heard some

folk get drunk and take the coin, then turn

all cowardly and jump the rail when they

sober up.”

Everyone seemed to consider that. It

wasn’t a hard thought for any of them. A

band of the king’s guard had come

through town only last month and posted

a notice, announcing a reward for

deserters.

“Tehlu anyway,” Shep said grimly into

his nearly empty mug. “Wouldn’t that be

a great royal pisser of a mess?”

“Jessom’s not coming back,” Bast said

dismissively. His voice had such a note

of certainty that everyone turned to eye

him curiously.

Bast tore off a piece of bread and put it

in his mouth before he realized he was

the center of attention. He swallowed

awkwardly and made a broad gesture

with both hands. “What?” he asked them,

laughing. “Would you come back,

knowing Martin was waiting?”

There was a chorus of negative grunts

and shaken heads.

“You have to be a special kind of

stupid to wreck up Martin’s still,” Old

Cob said.

“Maybe eight years will be enough for

Martin to cool down a bit,” Shep said.

“Not likely,” Jake said.

Later, after the customers were gone,

Bast and the innkeeper sat down in the

kitchen, making their own dinner from the

remainder of the stew and half a loaf of

bread.

“So what did you learn today, Bast?”

the innkeeper asked.

Bast grinned widely. “Today, Reshi, I

found out where Emberlee takes her

bath!”

The innkeeper cocked his head

thoughtfully. “Emberlee? The Alards’

daughter?”

“Emberlee Ashton!” Bast threw his

arms up into the air and made an

exasperated noise. “She’s only the third

prettiest girl in twenty miles, Reshi!”

“Ah,” the innkeeper said, an honest

smile flickering across his face for the

first time that day. “You’ll have to point

her out to me.”

Bast grinned. “I’ll take you there

tomorrow,” he said eagerly. “I don’t

know if she takes a bath every day, but

it’s worth the gamble. She’s sweet as

cream and broad of beam.” His smile

grew to wicked proportions. “She’s a

milkmaid, Reshi,” he said the last with

heavy emphasis. “A milkmaid. ”

The innkeeper shook his head, even as

his own smile spread helplessly across

his face. Finally he broke into a chuckle

and held up his hand. “You can point her

out to me sometime when she has her

clothes on,” he said pointedly. “That will

do nicely.”

Bast gave a disapproving sigh. “It

would do you a world of good to get out

a bit, Reshi.”

The

innkeeper

shrugged.

“It’s

possible,” he said as he poked idly at his

stew.

They ate in silence for a long while.

Bast tried to think of something to say.

“I did get the carrots, Reshi,” Bast said

as he finished his stew and ladled the

rest of it out of the kettle.

“Better late than never, I suppose,” the

innkeeper said his voice was listless and

grey. “We’ll use them tomorrow.”

Bast shifted in his seat, embarrassed.

“I’m afraid I lost them afterwards,” he

said sheepishly.

This wrung another tired smile from the

innkeeper. “Don’t worry yourself over it,

Bast.” His eyes narrowed then, focusing

on hand that held Bast’s spoon. “What

happened to your hand?”

Bast looked down at the knuckles of his

right hand, they weren’t bloody anymore,

but they were skinned rather badly.

“I fell out of a tree,” Bast said. Not

lying, but not answering the question,

either. It was better not to lie outright.

Even weary and dull, his master was not

an easy man to fool.

“You should be more careful, Bast,” the

innkeeper said, prodding listlessly at his

food. “And with as little as there is to do

around here, it would be nice if you spent

a little more time on your studies.”

“I learned loads of things today,

Reshi,” Bast protested.

The innkeeper sat up, looking more

attentive. “Really?” he said. “Impress me

then.”

Bast thought for a moment. “Nettie

Williams found a wild hive of bees

today,” he said. “And she managed to

catch the queen …”

George R. R. Martin

Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy

Award-winner

George

R.

R.

Martin, New York Times bestselling

author of the landmark A Song of

Ice and Fire fantasy series, has

been

called

“the

American

Tolkien.”

Born in Bayonne, New

Jersey, George R. R. Martin

made his first sale in 1971,

and soon established himself

as one of the most popular

SF writers of the seventies.

He quickly became a

mainstay of the Ben Bova

Analog with stories such as

“With Morning Comes

Mistfall,” “And Seven Times

Never Kill Man,” “The

Second Kind of Loneliness,”

“The Storms of Windhaven”

(in collaboration with Lisa

Tuttle, and later expanded by

them into the novel

Windhaven ), “Override,” and

others, although he also sold

to Amazing, Fantastic, Galaxy,

Orbit, and other markets. One

of his Analog stories, the

striking novella “A Song for

Lya,” won him his first Hugo

Award, in 1974.

By the end of the seventies,

he had reached the height of

his influence as a science-

fiction writer and was

producing his best work in

that category with stories

such as the famous

“Sandkings,” his best-known

story, which won both the

Nebula and the Hugo in

1980 (he’d later win another

Nebula in 1985 for his story

“Portraits of His Children”),

“The Way of Cross and

Dragon,” which won a Hugo

Award in the same year

(making Martin the first

author ever to receive two

Hugo Awards for fiction in

the same year,

“Bitterblooms,” “The Stone

City,” “Starlady,” and

others. These stories would

be collected in Sandkings, one

of the strongest collections of

the period. By now, he had

mostly moved away from

Analog although he would

have a long sequence of

stories about the droll

interstellar adventures of

Havalend Tuf (later collected

in Tuf Voyaging ) running

throughout the eighties in the

Stanley Schmidt Analog, as

well as a few strong

individual pieces such as the

novella “Nightflyers”—most

of his major work of the late

seventies and early eighties,

though, would appear in

Omni . The late seventies and

the eighties also saw the

publication of his memorable

novel Dying of the Light , his

only solo SF novel, while his

stories were collected in A

Song for Lya, Sandkings, Songs of

Stars and Shadows, Songs the

Dead Men Sing, Nightflyers, and

Portraits of His Children. By the

beginning of the eighties,

he’d moved away from SF

and into the horror genre,

publishing the big horror

novel Fevre Dream, and

winning the Bram Stoker

Award for his horror story

“The Pear-Shaped Man”

and the World Fantasy

Award for his werewolf

novella “The Skin Trade.”

By the end of that decade,

though, the crash of the

horror market and the

commercial failure of his

ambitious horror novel

Armageddon Rag had driven

him out of the print world

and to a successful career in

television instead, where for

more than a decade he

worked as story editor or

producer on such shows as

new Twilight Zone and Beauty

and the Beast.

After years away, Martin

made a triumphant return to

the print world in 1996 with

the publication in 1996 of

the immensely successful

fantasy novel A Game of

Thrones, the start of his Song

of Ice and Fire sequence. A

freestanding novella taken

from that work, “Blood of

the Dragon,” won Martin

another Hugo Award in

1997. Further books in the

Song of Ice and Fire series

— A Clash of Kings, A Storm of

Swords, A Feast for Crows, and

A Dance with Dragons— have

made it one of the most

popular, acclaimed, and

bestselling series in all of

modern fantasy. Recently, the

books were made into an

HBO TV series, Game of

Thrones, which has become

one of the most popular and

acclaimed shows on

television, and made Martin

a recognizable figure well

outside of the usual genre

boundaries, even inspiring a

satirical version of him on

Saturday Night Live . Martin’s

most recent books are the

latest book in the Ice and

Fire series, A Dance With

Dragons, a massive two-

volume retrospective

collection spanning the

entire spectrum of his career,

Dreamsongs, a novella

collection, Starlady and Fast-

Friend, a novel written in

collaboration with Gardner

Dozois and Daniel Abraham,

Hunter’s Run, and, as editor,

several anthologies edited in

collaboration with Gardner

Dozois, including Warriors,

Songs of the Dying Earth, Songs of

Love and Death, Down These

Strange Streets, and Dangerous

Women, as well as several new

volumes in his long-running

Wild Cards anthology series,

Wild Cards: Busted Flush and

Wild Cards: Inside Straight. In

2012, Martin was given the

Life Achievement Award by

the World Fantasy

Convention. A World of Ice and

Fire , a comprehensive history

of Westeros and the lands

beyond, will be released in

fall of 2014.

Here he takes us to the

turbulent land of Westeros,

home to his Ice and Fire

series, for the story of that

swashbuckling rogue

Daemon Targaryen, the

Prince who never became a

King—although his ambition

to become one would plunge

the entire world into war.
