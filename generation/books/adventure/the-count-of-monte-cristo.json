Marseilles—The Arrival\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde\r\nsignalled the three-master, the _Pharaon_ from Smyrna, Trieste, and\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\nAs usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If,\r\ngot on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.\r\n\r\nImmediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean\r\nwere covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a\r\nship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the _Pharaon_,\r\nhas been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs\r\nto an owner of the city.\r\n\r\nThe ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic\r\nshock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled\r\nPomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker,\r\nbut so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is\r\nthe forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have\r\nhappened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly\r\nthat if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself,\r\nfor she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the\r\nanchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by\r\nthe side of the pilot, who was steering the _Pharaon_ towards the\r\nnarrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity\r\nand vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each\r\ndirection of the pilot.\r\n\r\nThe vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much\r\naffected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the\r\nvessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled\r\nalongside the _Pharaon_, which he reached as she rounded into La\r\nRéserve basin.\r\n\r\nWhen the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his\r\nstation by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s\r\nbulwarks.\r\n\r\nHe was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with\r\nblack eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole\r\nappearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men\r\naccustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.\r\n\r\n“Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s the\r\nmatter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?”\r\n\r\n“A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man, “a great\r\nmisfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave\r\nCaptain Leclere.”\r\n\r\n“And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that\r\nhead. But poor Captain Leclere——”\r\n\r\n“What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable\r\nresignation. “What happened to the worthy captain?”\r\n\r\n“He died.”\r\n\r\n“Fell into the sea?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.” Then turning to\r\nthe crew, he said, “Bear a hand there, to take in sail!”\r\n\r\nAll hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the\r\ncrew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and\r\nouthaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail\r\nclewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his\r\norders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to\r\nthe owner.\r\n\r\n“And how did this misfortune occur?” inquired the latter, resuming the\r\ninterrupted conversation.\r\n\r\n0023m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the\r\nharbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind.\r\nIn twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days\r\nafterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his\r\nrest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head\r\nand his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword\r\nand cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,” added the young man\r\nwith a melancholy smile, “to make war against the English for ten\r\nyears, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you see, Edmond,” replied the owner, who appeared more comforted\r\nat every moment, “we are all mortal, and the old must make way for the\r\nyoung. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure\r\nme that the cargo——”\r\n\r\n“Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise\r\nyou not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.”\r\n\r\nThen, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted:\r\n“Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!”\r\n\r\nThe order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a\r\nman-of-war.\r\n\r\n“Let go—and clue up!” At this last command all the sails were lowered,\r\nand the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.\r\n\r\n“Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, observing the\r\nowner’s impatience, “here is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out\r\nof his cabin, who will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I\r\nmust look after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.”\r\n\r\nThe owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which\r\nDantès flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit\r\nto a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man,\r\ngoing to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came\r\ntowards the owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of\r\nage, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors,\r\ninsolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as\r\nresponsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors,\r\nmade him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dantès was beloved by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Well, M. Morrel,” said Danglars, “you have heard of the misfortune\r\nthat has befallen us?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.”\r\n\r\n“And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service,\r\nas became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as\r\nthat of Morrel & Son,” replied Danglars.\r\n\r\n“But,” replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was watching the\r\nanchoring of his vessel, “it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so\r\nold as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend\r\nEdmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require\r\ninstruction from anyone.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate.\r\n“Yes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was\r\nthe captain’s breath out of his body when he assumed the command\r\nwithout consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at\r\nthe Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.”\r\n\r\n0025m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, “that was his\r\nduty as captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of\r\nElba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.”\r\n\r\n“The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are,\r\nM. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the\r\npleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.”\r\n\r\n“Dantès,” said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, “come this\r\nway!”\r\n\r\n“In a moment, sir,” answered Dantès, “and I’m with you.” Then calling\r\nto the crew, he said, “Let go!”\r\n\r\nThe anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through\r\nthe port-hole. Dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of\r\nthe pilot, until this manœuvre was completed, and then he added,\r\n“Half-mast the colors, and square the yards!”\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Danglars, “he fancies himself captain already, upon my\r\nword.”\r\n\r\n“And so, in fact, he is,” said the owner.\r\n\r\n“Except your signature and your partner’s, M. Morrel.”\r\n\r\n“And why should he not have this?” asked the owner; “he is young, it is\r\ntrue, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.”\r\n\r\nA cloud passed over Danglars’ brow.\r\n\r\n“Your pardon, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, approaching, “the vessel now\r\nrides at anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?”\r\n\r\nDanglars retreated a step or two. “I wished to inquire why you stopped\r\nat the Island of Elba?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain\r\nLeclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.”\r\n\r\n“Then did you see him, Edmond?”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“The marshal.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nMorrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said\r\nsuddenly—\r\n\r\n“And how is the emperor?”\r\n\r\n“Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.”\r\n\r\n“You saw the emperor, then?”\r\n\r\n“He entered the marshal’s apartment while I was there.”\r\n\r\n“And you spoke to him?”\r\n\r\n“Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,” said Dantès, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“And what did he say to you?”\r\n\r\n“Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the\r\ncourse she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not\r\nbeen laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I\r\ntold him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel &\r\nSon. ‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners\r\nfrom father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same\r\nregiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.’”\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_ and that is true!” cried the owner, greatly delighted. “And\r\nthat was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain.\r\nDantès, you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you\r\nwill see it will bring tears into the old soldier’s eyes. Come, come,”\r\ncontinued he, patting Edmond’s shoulder kindly, “you did very right,\r\nDantès, to follow Captain Leclere’s instructions, and touch at Elba,\r\nalthough if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the\r\nmarshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into\r\ntrouble.”\r\n\r\n0027m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“How could that bring me into trouble, sir?” asked Dantès; “for I did\r\nnot even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made\r\nsuch inquiries as he would of the first comer. But, pardon me, here are\r\nthe health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.” And\r\nthe young man went to the gangway. As he departed, Danglars approached,\r\nand said,—\r\n\r\n“Well, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his\r\nlanding at Porto-Ferrajo?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“Well, so much the better,” said the supercargo; “for it is not\r\npleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty.”\r\n\r\n“Dantès has done his,” replied the owner, “and that is not saying much.\r\nIt was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.”\r\n\r\n“Talking of Captain Leclere, has not Dantès given you a letter from\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n“To me?—no—was there one?”\r\n\r\n“I believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter\r\nto his care.”\r\n\r\n“Of what packet are you speaking, Danglars?”\r\n\r\n“Why, that which Dantès left at Porto-Ferrajo.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?”\r\n\r\nDanglars turned very red.\r\n\r\n“I was passing close to the door of the captain’s cabin, which was half\r\nopen, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantès.”\r\n\r\n“He did not speak to me of it,” replied the shipowner; “but if there be\r\nany letter he will give it to me.”\r\n\r\nDanglars reflected for a moment. “Then, M. Morrel, I beg of you,” said\r\nhe, “not to say a word to Dantès on the subject. I may have been\r\nmistaken.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear Dantès, are you now free?” inquired the owner.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You have not been long detained.”\r\n\r\n“No. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and\r\nas to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I\r\ngave them.”\r\n\r\n“Then you have nothing more to do here?”\r\n\r\n“No—everything is all right now.”\r\n\r\n“Then you can come and dine with me?”\r\n\r\n“I really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first visit is due\r\nto my father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have\r\ndone me.”\r\n\r\n0029m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Right, Dantès, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.”\r\n\r\n“And,” inquired Dantès, with some hesitation, “do you know how my\r\nfather is?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.”\r\n\r\n“That proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your\r\nabsence.”\r\n\r\nDantès smiled. “My father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left,\r\nI doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from\r\nHeaven.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has\r\nbeen paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.”\r\n\r\n“True, Dantès, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who\r\nexpects you no less impatiently than your father—the lovely Mercédès.”\r\n\r\nDantès blushed.\r\n\r\n“Ah, ha,” said the shipowner, “I am not in the least surprised, for she\r\nhas been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the\r\n_Pharaon_. _Peste!_ Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!”\r\n\r\n“She is not my mistress,” replied the young sailor, gravely; “she is my\r\nbetrothed.”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes one and the same thing,” said Morrel, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Not with us, sir,” replied Dantès.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, my dear Edmond,” continued the owner, “don’t let me detain\r\nyou. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all\r\nthe time you require for your own. Do you want any money?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; I have all my pay to take—nearly three months’ wages.”\r\n\r\n“You are a careful fellow, Edmond.”\r\n\r\n“Say I have a poor father, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see\r\nyour father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those\r\nwho detained him from me after a three months’ voyage.”\r\n\r\n“Then I have your leave, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?”\r\n\r\n“He was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask your\r\nleave of absence for some days.”\r\n\r\n“To get married?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.”\r\n\r\n“Very good; have what time you require, Dantès. It will take quite six\r\nweeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until\r\nthree months after that; only be back again in three months, for the\r\n_Pharaon_,” added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back,\r\n“cannot sail without her captain.”\r\n\r\n“Without her captain!” cried Dantès, his eyes sparkling with animation;\r\n“pray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes\r\nof my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain of the\r\n_Pharaon_?”\r\n\r\n“If I were sole owner we’d shake hands on it now, my dear Dantès, and\r\ncall it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the Italian\r\nproverb—_Chi ha compagno ha padrone_—‘He who has a partner has a\r\nmaster.’ But the thing is at least half done, as you have one out of\r\ntwo votes. Rely on me to procure you the other; I will do my best.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, M. Morrel,” exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his eyes,\r\nand grasping the owner’s hand, “M. Morrel, I thank you in the name of\r\nmy father and of Mercédès.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right, Edmond. There’s a providence that watches over the\r\ndeserving. Go to your father; go and see Mercédès, and afterwards come\r\nto me.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I row you ashore?”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with\r\nDanglars. Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?”\r\n\r\n“That is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do you\r\nmean is he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the\r\nday when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose\r\nto him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle\r\nthe dispute—a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite\r\nright to refuse. If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the\r\nquestion, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you\r\nwill be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.”\r\n\r\n“But tell me, Dantès, if you had command of the _Pharaon_ should you be\r\nglad to see Danglars remain?”\r\n\r\n“Captain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest respect\r\nfor those who possess the owners’ confidence.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right, that’s right, Dantès! I see you are a thoroughly good\r\nfellow, and will detain you no longer. Go, for I see how impatient you\r\nare.”\r\n\r\n“Then I have leave?”\r\n\r\n“Go, I tell you.”\r\n\r\n“May I have the use of your skiff?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Then, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!”\r\n\r\n“I hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond. Good luck to you.”\r\n\r\nThe young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down in the stern\r\nsheets, with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebière. The two\r\noarsmen bent to their work, and the little boat glided away as rapidly\r\nas possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the\r\nnarrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of\r\nthe harbor to the Quai d’Orléans.\r\n\r\nThe shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him\r\nspring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which\r\nfrom five o’clock in the morning until nine o’clock at night, swarms in\r\nthe famous street of La Canebière,—a street of which the modern\r\nPhocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world,\r\nand with that accent which gives so much character to what is said, “If\r\nParis had La Canebière, Paris would be a second Marseilles.” On turning\r\nround the owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently awaiting orders,\r\nbut in reality also watching the young sailor,—but there was a great\r\ndifference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the\r\nmovements of Edmond Dantès.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 2. Father and Son\r\n\r\nWe will leave Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred, and\r\nendeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil\r\nsuspicions against his comrade, and follow Dantès, who, after having\r\ntraversed La Canebière, took the Rue de Noailles, and entering a small\r\nhouse, on the left of the Allées de Meilhan, rapidly ascended four\r\nflights of a dark staircase, holding the baluster with one hand, while\r\nwith the other he repressed the beatings of his heart, and paused\r\nbefore a half-open door, from which he could see the whole of a small\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThis room was occupied by Dantès’ father. The news of the arrival of\r\nthe _Pharaon_ had not yet reached the old man, who, mounted on a chair,\r\nwas amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and\r\nsprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window.\r\nSuddenly, he felt an arm thrown around his body, and a well-known voice\r\nbehind him exclaimed, “Father—dear father!”\r\n\r\nThe old man uttered a cry, and turned round; then, seeing his son, he\r\nfell into his arms, pale and trembling.\r\n\r\n“What ails you, my dearest father? Are you ill?” inquired the young\r\nman, much alarmed.\r\n\r\n“No, no, my dear Edmond—my boy—my son!—no; but I did not expect you;\r\nand joy, the surprise of seeing you so suddenly—Ah, I feel as if I were\r\ngoing to die.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, cheer up, my dear father! ’Tis I—really I! They say joy\r\nnever hurts, and so I came to you without any warning. Come now, do\r\nsmile, instead of looking at me so solemnly. Here I am back again, and\r\nwe are going to be happy.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, my boy, so we will—so we will,” replied the old man; “but\r\nhow shall we be happy? Shall you never leave me again? Come, tell me\r\nall the good fortune that has befallen you.”\r\n\r\n“God forgive me,” said the young man, “for rejoicing at happiness\r\nderived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not seek\r\nthis good fortune; it has happened, and I really cannot pretend to\r\nlament it. The good Captain Leclere is dead, father, and it is probable\r\nthat, with the aid of M. Morrel, I shall have his place. Do you\r\nunderstand, father? Only imagine me a captain at twenty, with a hundred\r\nlouis pay, and a share in the profits! Is this not more than a poor\r\nsailor like me could have hoped for?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear boy,” replied the old man, “it is very fortunate.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, with the first money I touch, I mean you to have a small\r\nhouse, with a garden in which to plant clematis, nasturtiums, and\r\nhoneysuckle. But what ails you, father? Are you not well?”\r\n\r\n“’Tis nothing, nothing; it will soon pass away”—and as he said so the\r\nold man’s strength failed him, and he fell backwards.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said the young man, “a glass of wine, father, will revive\r\nyou. Where do you keep your wine?”\r\n\r\n“No, no; thanks. You need not look for it; I do not want it,” said the\r\nold man.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, father, tell me where it is,” and he opened two or three\r\ncupboards.\r\n\r\n“It is no use,” said the old man, “there is no wine.”\r\n\r\n“What, no wine?” said Dantès, turning pale, and looking alternately at\r\nthe hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards. “What, no\r\nwine? Have you wanted money, father?”\r\n\r\n“I want nothing now that I have you,” said the old man.\r\n\r\n“Yet,” stammered Dantès, wiping the perspiration from his brow,—“yet I\r\ngave you two hundred francs when I left, three months ago.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, Edmond, that is true, but you forgot at that time a little\r\ndebt to our neighbor, Caderousse. He reminded me of it, telling me if I\r\ndid not pay for you, he would be paid by M. Morrel; and so, you see,\r\nlest he might do you an injury——”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I paid him.”\r\n\r\n“But,” cried Dantès, “it was a hundred and forty francs I owed\r\nCaderousse.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” stammered the old man.\r\n\r\n“And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you?”\r\n\r\nThe old man nodded.\r\n\r\n“So that you have lived for three months on sixty francs,” muttered\r\nEdmond.\r\n\r\n“You know how little I require,” said the old man.\r\n\r\n“Heaven pardon me,” cried Edmond, falling on his knees before his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?”\r\n\r\n“You have wounded me to the heart.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind it, for I see you once more,” said the old man; “and now\r\nit’s all over—everything is all right again.”\r\n\r\n0035m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes, here I am,” said the young man, “with a promising future and a\r\nlittle money. Here, father, here!” he said, “take this—take it, and\r\nsend for something immediately.” And he emptied his pockets on the\r\ntable, the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces, five or six\r\nfive-franc pieces, and some smaller coin. The countenance of old Dantès\r\nbrightened.\r\n\r\n“Whom does this belong to?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“To me, to you, to us! Take it; buy some provisions; be happy, and\r\ntomorrow we shall have more.”\r\n\r\n“Gently, gently,” said the old man, with a smile; “and by your leave I\r\nwill use your purse moderately, for they would say, if they saw me buy\r\ntoo many things at a time, that I had been obliged to await your\r\nreturn, in order to be able to purchase them.”\r\n\r\n“Do as you please; but, first of all, pray have a servant, father. I\r\nwill not have you left alone so long. I have some smuggled coffee and\r\nmost capital tobacco, in a small chest in the hold, which you shall\r\nhave tomorrow. But, hush, here comes somebody.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis Caderousse, who has heard of your arrival, and no doubt comes to\r\ncongratulate you on your fortunate return.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, lips that say one thing, while the heart thinks another,” murmured\r\nEdmond. “But, never mind, he is a neighbor who has done us a service on\r\na time, so he’s welcome.”\r\n\r\nAs Edmond paused, the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at\r\nthe door. He was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of\r\ncloth, which, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining.\r\n\r\n“What, is it you, Edmond, back again?” said he, with a broad\r\nMarseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth.\r\n\r\n“Yes, as you see, neighbor Caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to you\r\nin any and every way,” replied Dantès, but ill-concealing his coldness\r\nunder this cloak of civility.\r\n\r\n“Thanks—thanks; but, fortunately, I do not want for anything; and it\r\nchances that at times there are others who have need of me.” Dantès\r\nmade a gesture. “I do not allude to you, my boy. No!—no! I lent you\r\nmoney, and you returned it; that’s like good neighbors, and we are\r\nquits.”\r\n\r\n“We are never quits with those who oblige us,” was Dantès’ reply; “for\r\nwhen we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the use of mentioning that? What is done is done. Let us talk\r\nof your happy return, my boy. I had gone on the quay to match a piece\r\nof mulberry cloth, when I met friend Danglars. ‘You at\r\nMarseilles?’—‘Yes,’ says he.\r\n\r\n“‘I thought you were at Smyrna.’—‘I was; but am now back again.’\r\n\r\n“‘And where is the dear boy, our little Edmond?’\r\n\r\n“‘Why, with his father, no doubt,’ replied Danglars. And so I came,”\r\nadded Caderousse, “as fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking\r\nhands with a friend.”\r\n\r\n0037m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Worthy Caderousse!” said the old man, “he is so much attached to us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, to be sure I am. I love and esteem you, because honest folks are\r\nso rare. But it seems you have come back rich, my boy,” continued the\r\ntailor, looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dantès\r\nhad thrown on the table.\r\n\r\nThe young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes\r\nof his neighbor. “Eh,” he said, negligently, “this money is not mine. I\r\nwas expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in\r\nmy absence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table. Come,\r\nfather” added Dantès, “put this money back in your box—unless neighbor\r\nCaderousse wants anything, and in that case it is at his service.”\r\n\r\n“No, my boy, no,” said Caderousse. “I am not in any want, thank God, my\r\nliving is suited to my means. Keep your money—keep it, I say;—one never\r\nhas too much;—but, at the same time, my boy, I am as much obliged by\r\nyour offer as if I took advantage of it.”\r\n\r\n“It was offered with good will,” said Dantès.\r\n\r\n“No doubt, my boy; no doubt. Well, you stand well with M. Morrel I\r\nhear,—you insinuating dog, you!”\r\n\r\n“M. Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,” replied Dantès.\r\n\r\n“Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.”\r\n\r\n“What, did you refuse to dine with him?” said old Dantès; “and did he\r\ninvite you to dine?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear father,” replied Edmond, smiling at his father’s\r\nastonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son.\r\n\r\n“And why did you refuse, my son?” inquired the old man.\r\n\r\n“That I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,” replied the\r\nyoung man. “I was most anxious to see you.”\r\n\r\n“But it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,” said Caderousse.\r\n“And when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy\r\nthe owner.”\r\n\r\n“But I explained to him the cause of my refusal,” replied Dantès, “and\r\nI hope he fully understood it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one’s\r\npatrons.”\r\n\r\n“I hope to be captain without that,” said Dantès.\r\n\r\n“So much the better—so much the better! Nothing will give greater\r\npleasure to all your old friends; and I know one down there behind the\r\nSaint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it.”\r\n\r\n“Mercédès?” said the old man.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear father, and with your permission, now I have seen you,\r\nand know you are well and have all you require, I will ask your consent\r\nto go and pay a visit to the Catalans.”\r\n\r\n“Go, my dear boy,” said old Dantès; “and Heaven bless you in your wife,\r\nas it has blessed me in my son!”\r\n\r\n“His wife!” said Caderousse; “why, how fast you go on, father Dantès;\r\nshe is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.”\r\n\r\n“No, but according to all probability she soon will be,” replied\r\nEdmond.\r\n\r\n“Yes—yes,” said Caderousse; “but you were right to return as soon as\r\npossible, my boy.”\r\n\r\n“And why?”\r\n\r\n“Because Mercédès is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack\r\nfollowers; she particularly has them by dozens.”\r\n\r\n“Really?” answered Edmond, with a smile which had in it traces of\r\nslight uneasiness.\r\n\r\n0039m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” continued Caderousse, “and capital offers, too; but you\r\nknow, you will be captain, and who could refuse you then?”\r\n\r\n“Meaning to say,” replied Dantès, with a smile which but ill-concealed\r\nhis trouble, “that if I were not a captain——”\r\n\r\n“Eh—eh!” said Caderousse, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said the sailor, “I have a better opinion than you of\r\nwomen in general, and of Mercédès in particular; and I am certain that,\r\ncaptain or not, she will remain ever faithful to me.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better—so much the better,” said Caderousse. “When one is\r\ngoing to be married, there is nothing like implicit confidence; but\r\nnever mind that, my boy,—go and announce your arrival, and let her know\r\nall your hopes and prospects.”\r\n\r\n“I will go directly,” was Edmond’s reply; and, embracing his father,\r\nand nodding to Caderousse, he left the apartment.\r\n\r\nCaderousse lingered for a moment, then taking leave of old Dantès, he\r\nwent downstairs to rejoin Danglars, who awaited him at the corner of\r\nthe Rue Senac.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Danglars, “did you see him?”\r\n\r\n“I have just left him,” answered Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“Did he allude to his hope of being captain?”\r\n\r\n“He spoke of it as a thing already decided.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” said Danglars, “he is in too much hurry, it appears to me.”\r\n\r\n“Why, it seems M. Morrel has promised him the thing.”\r\n\r\n“So that he is quite elated about it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, he is actually insolent over the matter—has already offered\r\nme his patronage, as if he were a grand personage, and proffered me a\r\nloan of money, as though he were a banker.”\r\n\r\n“Which you refused?”\r\n\r\n“Most assuredly; although I might easily have accepted it, for it was I\r\nwho put into his hands the first silver he ever earned; but now M.\r\nDantès has no longer any occasion for assistance—he is about to become\r\na captain.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Danglars, “he is not one yet.”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_ it will be as well if he is not,” answered Caderousse; “for\r\nif he should be, there will be really no speaking to him.”\r\n\r\n“If we choose,” replied Danglars, “he will remain what he is; and\r\nperhaps become even less than he is.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing—I was speaking to myself. And is he still in love with the\r\nCatalane?”\r\n\r\n“Over head and ears; but, unless I am much mistaken, there will be a\r\nstorm in that quarter.”\r\n\r\n0041m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Explain yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Why should I?”\r\n\r\n“It is more important than you think, perhaps. You do not like Dantès?”\r\n\r\n“I never like upstarts.”\r\n\r\n“Then tell me all you know about the Catalane.”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing for certain; only I have seen things which induce me to\r\nbelieve, as I told you, that the future captain will find some\r\nannoyance in the vicinity of the Vieilles Infirmeries.”\r\n\r\n“What have you seen?—come, tell me!”\r\n\r\n“Well, every time I have seen Mercédès come into the city she has been\r\naccompanied by a tall, strapping, black-eyed Catalan, with a red\r\ncomplexion, brown skin, and fierce air, whom she calls cousin.”\r\n\r\n“Really; and you think this cousin pays her attentions?”\r\n\r\n“I only suppose so. What else can a strapping chap of twenty-one mean\r\nwith a fine wench of seventeen?”\r\n\r\n“And you say that Dantès has gone to the Catalans?”\r\n\r\n“He went before I came down.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go the same way; we will stop at La Réserve, and we can drink a\r\nglass of La Malgue, whilst we wait for news.”\r\n\r\n“Come along,” said Caderousse; “but you pay the score.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” replied Danglars; and going quickly to the designated\r\nplace, they called for a bottle of wine, and two glasses.\r\n\r\nPère Pamphile had seen Dantès pass not ten minutes before; and assured\r\nthat he was at the Catalans, they sat down under the budding foliage of\r\nthe planes and sycamores, in the branches of which the birds were\r\nsinging their welcome to one of the first days of spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 3. The Catalans\r\n\r\nBeyond a bare, weather-worn wall, about a hundred paces from the spot\r\nwhere the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their\r\nwine, was the village of the Catalans. Long ago this mysterious colony\r\nquitted Spain, and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this\r\nday. Whence it came no one knew, and it spoke an unknown tongue. One of\r\nits chiefs, who understood Provençal, begged the commune of Marseilles\r\nto give them this bare and barren promontory, where, like the sailors\r\nof old, they had run their boats ashore. The request was granted; and\r\nthree months afterwards, around the twelve or fifteen small vessels\r\nwhich had brought these gypsies of the sea, a small village sprang up.\r\nThis village, constructed in a singular and picturesque manner, half\r\nMoorish, half Spanish, still remains, and is inhabited by descendants\r\nof the first comers, who speak the language of their fathers. For three\r\nor four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory, on\r\nwhich they had settled like a flight of seabirds, without mixing with\r\nthe Marseillaise population, intermarrying, and preserving their\r\noriginal customs and the costume of their mother-country as they have\r\npreserved its language.\r\n\r\nOur readers will follow us along the only street of this little\r\nvillage, and enter with us one of the houses, which is sunburned to the\r\nbeautiful dead-leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country, and\r\nwithin coated with whitewash, like a Spanish posada. A young and\r\nbeautiful girl, with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the\r\ngazelle’s, was leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in\r\nher slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms, the\r\nflowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor; her\r\narms, bare to the elbow, brown, and modelled after those of the\r\nArlesian Venus, moved with a kind of restless impatience, and she\r\ntapped the earth with her arched and supple foot, so as to display the\r\npure and full shape of her well-turned leg, in its red cotton, gray and\r\nblue clocked, stocking. At three paces from her, seated in a chair\r\nwhich he balanced on two legs, leaning his elbow on an old worm-eaten\r\ntable, was a tall young man of twenty, or two-and-twenty, who was\r\nlooking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were\r\nmingled. He questioned her with his eyes, but the firm and steady gaze\r\nof the young girl controlled his look.\r\n\r\n“You see, Mercédès,” said the young man, “here is Easter come round\r\nagain; tell me, is this the moment for a wedding?”\r\n\r\n“I have answered you a hundred times, Fernand, and really you must be\r\nvery stupid to ask me again.”\r\n\r\n“Well, repeat it,—repeat it, I beg of you, that I may at last believe\r\nit! Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love, which had\r\nyour mother’s sanction. Make me understand once for all that you are\r\ntrifling with my happiness, that my life or death are nothing to you.\r\nAh, to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband, Mercédès, and\r\nto lose that hope, which was the only stay of my existence!”\r\n\r\n“At least it was not I who ever encouraged you in that hope, Fernand,”\r\nreplied Mercédès; “you cannot reproach me with the slightest coquetry.\r\nI have always said to you, ‘I love you as a brother; but do not ask\r\nfrom me more than sisterly affection, for my heart is another’s.’ Is\r\nnot this true, Fernand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is very true, Mercédès,” replied the young man, “Yes, you\r\nhave been cruelly frank with me; but do you forget that it is among the\r\nCatalans a sacred law to intermarry?”\r\n\r\n0045m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You mistake, Fernand; it is not a law, but merely a custom, and, I\r\npray of you, do not cite this custom in your favor. You are included in\r\nthe conscription, Fernand, and are only at liberty on sufferance,\r\nliable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms. Once a soldier,\r\nwhat would you do with me, a poor orphan, forlorn, without fortune,\r\nwith nothing but a half-ruined hut and a few ragged nets, the miserable\r\ninheritance left by my father to my mother, and by my mother to me? She\r\nhas been dead a year, and you know, Fernand, I have subsisted almost\r\nentirely on public charity. Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you,\r\nand that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing, and\r\nI accept it, Fernand, because you are the son of my father’s brother,\r\nbecause we were brought up together, and still more because it would\r\ngive you so much pain if I refuse. But I feel very deeply that this\r\nfish which I go and sell, and with the produce of which I buy the flax\r\nI spin,—I feel very keenly, Fernand, that this is charity.”\r\n\r\n“And if it were, Mercédès, poor and lone as you are, you suit me as\r\nwell as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of\r\nMarseilles! What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful\r\nhousekeeper, and where can I look for these better than in you?”\r\n\r\n“Fernand,” answered Mercédès, shaking her head, “a woman becomes a bad\r\nmanager, and who shall say she will remain an honest woman, when she\r\nloves another man better than her husband? Rest content with my\r\nfriendship, for I say once more that is all I can promise, and I will\r\npromise no more than I can bestow.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” replied Fernand, “you can endure your own wretchedness\r\npatiently, but you are afraid to share mine. Well, Mercédès, beloved by\r\nyou, I would tempt fortune; you would bring me good luck, and I should\r\nbecome rich. I could extend my occupation as a fisherman, might get a\r\nplace as clerk in a warehouse, and become in time a dealer myself.”\r\n\r\n“You could do no such thing, Fernand; you are a soldier, and if you\r\nremain at the Catalans it is because there is no war; so remain a\r\nfisherman, and contented with my friendship, as I cannot give you\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will do better, Mercédès. I will be a sailor; instead of the\r\ncostume of our fathers, which you despise, I will wear a varnished hat,\r\na striped shirt, and a blue jacket, with an anchor on the buttons.\r\nWould not that dress please you?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked Mercédès, with an angry glance,—“what do you\r\nmean? I do not understand you?”\r\n\r\n“I mean, Mercédès, that you are thus harsh and cruel with me, because\r\nyou are expecting someone who is thus attired; but perhaps he whom you\r\nawait is inconstant, or if he is not, the sea is so to him.”\r\n\r\n“Fernand,” cried Mercédès, “I believed you were good-hearted, and I was\r\nmistaken! Fernand, you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the\r\nanger of God! Yes, I will not deny it, I do await, and I do love him of\r\nwhom you speak; and, if he does not return, instead of accusing him of\r\nthe inconstancy which you insinuate, I will tell you that he died\r\nloving me and me only.” The young girl made a gesture of rage. “I\r\nunderstand you, Fernand; you would be revenged on him because I do not\r\nlove you; you would cross your Catalan knife with his dirk. What end\r\nwould that answer? To lose you my friendship if he were conquered, and\r\nsee that friendship changed into hate if you were victor. Believe me,\r\nto seek a quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who\r\nloves that man. No, Fernand, you will not thus give way to evil\r\nthoughts. Unable to have me for your wife, you will content yourself\r\nwith having me for your friend and sister; and besides,” she added, her\r\neyes troubled and moistened with tears, “wait, wait, Fernand; you said\r\njust now that the sea was treacherous, and he has been gone four\r\nmonths, and during these four months there have been some terrible\r\nstorms.”\r\n\r\nFernand made no reply, nor did he attempt to check the tears which\r\nflowed down the cheeks of Mercédès, although for each of these tears he\r\nwould have shed his heart’s blood; but these tears flowed for another.\r\nHe arose, paced a while up and down the hut, and then, suddenly\r\nstopping before Mercédès, with his eyes glowing and his hands\r\nclenched,—“Say, Mercédès,” he said, “once for all, is this your final\r\ndetermination?”\r\n\r\n“I love Edmond Dantès,” the young girl calmly replied, “and none but\r\nEdmond shall ever be my husband.”\r\n\r\n“And you will always love him?”\r\n\r\n“As long as I live.”\r\n\r\nFernand let fall his head like a defeated man, heaved a sigh that was\r\nlike a groan, and then suddenly looking her full in the face, with\r\nclenched teeth and expanded nostrils, said,—“But if he is dead——”\r\n\r\n“If he is dead, I shall die too.”\r\n\r\n“If he has forgotten you——”\r\n\r\n“Mercédès!” called a joyous voice from without,—“Mercédès!”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” exclaimed the young girl, blushing with delight, and fairly\r\nleaping in excess of love, “you see he has not forgotten me, for here\r\nhe is!” And rushing towards the door, she opened it, saying, “Here,\r\nEdmond, here I am!”\r\n\r\nFernand, pale and trembling, drew back, like a traveller at the sight\r\nof a serpent, and fell into a chair beside him. Edmond and Mercédès\r\nwere clasped in each other’s arms. The burning Marseilles sun, which\r\nshot into the room through the open door, covered them with a flood of\r\nlight. At first they saw nothing around them. Their intense happiness\r\nisolated them from all the rest of the world, and they only spoke in\r\nbroken words, which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem\r\nrather the expression of sorrow. Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy, pale,\r\nand threatening countenance of Fernand, as it was defined in the\r\nshadow. By a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself,\r\nthe young Catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt.\r\n\r\n“Ah, your pardon,” said Dantès, frowning in his turn; “I did not\r\nperceive that there were three of us.” Then, turning to Mercédès, he\r\ninquired, “Who is this gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“One who will be your best friend, Dantès, for he is my friend, my\r\ncousin, my brother; it is Fernand—the man whom, after you, Edmond, I\r\nlove the best in the world. Do you not remember him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” said Dantès, and without relinquishing Mercédès’ hand clasped in\r\none of his own, he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial\r\nair. But Fernand, instead of responding to this amiable gesture,\r\nremained mute and trembling. Edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly\r\nat the agitated and embarrassed Mercédès, and then again on the gloomy\r\nand menacing Fernand. This look told him all, and his anger waxed hot.\r\n\r\n“I did not know, when I came with such haste to you, that I was to meet\r\nan enemy here.”\r\n\r\n“An enemy!” cried Mercédès, with an angry look at her cousin. “An enemy\r\nin my house, do you say, Edmond! If I believed that, I would place my\r\narm under yours and go with you to Marseilles, leaving the house to\r\nreturn to it no more.”\r\n\r\nFernand’s eye darted lightning. “And should any misfortune occur to\r\nyou, dear Edmond,” she continued with the same calmness which proved to\r\nFernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his\r\nsinister thought, “if misfortune should occur to you, I would ascend\r\nthe highest point of the Cape de Morgiou and cast myself headlong from\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nFernand became deadly pale. “But you are deceived, Edmond,” she\r\ncontinued. “You have no enemy here—there is no one but Fernand, my\r\nbrother, who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend.”\r\n\r\nAnd at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the\r\nCatalan, who, as if fascinated by it, came slowly towards Edmond, and\r\noffered him his hand. His hatred, like a powerless though furious wave,\r\nwas broken against the strong ascendancy which Mercédès exercised over\r\nhim. Scarcely, however, had he touched Edmond’s hand when he felt he\r\nhad done all he could do, and rushed hastily out of the house.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” he exclaimed, running furiously and tearing his hair—“Oh, who\r\nwill deliver me from this man? Wretched—wretched that I am!”\r\n\r\n“Hallo, Catalan! Hallo, Fernand! where are you running to?” exclaimed a\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nThe young man stopped suddenly, looked around him, and perceived\r\nCaderousse sitting at table with Danglars, under an arbor.\r\n\r\n“Well”, said Caderousse, “why don’t you come? Are you really in such a\r\nhurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends?”\r\n\r\n“Particularly when they have still a full bottle before them,” added\r\nDanglars. Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did not\r\nsay a word.\r\n\r\n“He seems besotted,” said Danglars, pushing Caderousse with his knee.\r\n“Are we mistaken, and is Dantès triumphant in spite of all we have\r\nbelieved?”\r\n\r\n“Why, we must inquire into that,” was Caderousse’s reply; and turning\r\ntowards the young man, said, “Well, Catalan, can’t you make up your\r\nmind?”\r\n\r\nFernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow, and slowly\r\nentered the arbor, whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness\r\nto his senses, and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his\r\nexhausted body.\r\n\r\n“Good-day,” said he. “You called me, didn’t you?” And he fell, rather\r\nthan sat down, on one of the seats which surrounded the table.\r\n\r\n“I called you because you were running like a madman, and I was afraid\r\nyou would throw yourself into the sea,” said Caderousse, laughing.\r\n“Why, when a man has friends, they are not only to offer him a glass of\r\nwine, but, moreover, to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of\r\nwater unnecessarily!”\r\n\r\nFernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into\r\nhis hands, his elbows leaning on the table.\r\n\r\n“Well, Fernand, I must say,” said Caderousse, beginning the\r\nconversation, with that brutality of the common people in which\r\ncuriosity destroys all diplomacy, “you look uncommonly like a rejected\r\nlover;” and he burst into a hoarse laugh.\r\n\r\n“Bah!” said Danglars, “a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in\r\nlove. You are laughing at him, Caderousse.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied, “only hark how he sighs! Come, come, Fernand,” said\r\nCaderousse, “hold up your head, and answer us. It’s not polite not to\r\nreply to friends who ask news of your health.”\r\n\r\n“My health is well enough,” said Fernand, clenching his hands without\r\nraising his head.\r\n\r\n“Ah, you see, Danglars,” said Caderousse, winking at his friend, “this\r\nis how it is; Fernand, whom you see here, is a good and brave Catalan,\r\none of the best fishermen in Marseilles, and he is in love with a very\r\nfine girl, named Mercédès; but it appears, unfortunately, that the fine\r\ngirl is in love with the mate of the _Pharaon_; and as the _Pharaon_\r\narrived today—why, you understand!”\r\n\r\n“No; I do not understand,” said Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Poor Fernand has been dismissed,” continued Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“Well, and what then?” said Fernand, lifting up his head, and looking\r\nat Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his\r\nanger; “Mercédès is not accountable to any person, is she? Is she not\r\nfree to love whomsoever she will?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you take it in that sense,” said Caderousse, “it is another\r\nthing. But I thought you were a Catalan, and they told me the Catalans\r\nwere not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival. It was\r\neven told me that Fernand, especially, was terrible in his vengeance.”\r\n\r\nFernand smiled piteously. “A lover is never terrible,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Poor fellow!” remarked Danglars, affecting to pity the young man from\r\nthe bottom of his heart. “Why, you see, he did not expect to see Dantès\r\nreturn so suddenly—he thought he was dead, perhaps; or perchance\r\nfaithless! These things always come on us more severely when they come\r\nsuddenly.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, _ma foi_, under any circumstances!” said Caderousse, who drank as\r\nhe spoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take\r\neffect,—“under any circumstances Fernand is not the only person put out\r\nby the fortunate arrival of Dantès; is he, Danglars?”\r\n\r\n“No, you are right—and I should say that would bring him ill-luck.”\r\n\r\n“Well, never mind,” answered Caderousse, pouring out a glass of wine\r\nfor Fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time, while\r\nDanglars had merely sipped his. “Never mind—in the meantime he marries\r\nMercédès—the lovely Mercédès—at least he returns to do that.”\r\n\r\nDuring this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man,\r\non whose heart Caderousse’s words fell like molten lead.\r\n\r\n“And when is the wedding to be?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is not yet fixed!” murmured Fernand.\r\n\r\n“No, but it will be,” said Caderousse, “as surely as Dantès will be\r\ncaptain of the _Pharaon_—eh, Danglars?”\r\n\r\nDanglars shuddered at this unexpected attack, and turned to Caderousse,\r\nwhose countenance he scrutinized, to try and detect whether the blow\r\nwas premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already\r\nrendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, filling the glasses, “let us drink to Captain Edmond\r\nDantès, husband of the beautiful Catalane!”\r\n\r\nCaderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand, and\r\nswallowed the contents at a gulp. Fernand dashed his on the ground.\r\n\r\n“Eh, eh, eh!” stammered Caderousse. “What do I see down there by the\r\nwall, in the direction of the Catalans? Look, Fernand, your eyes are\r\nbetter than mine. I believe I see double. You know wine is a deceiver;\r\nbut I should say it was two lovers walking side by side, and hand in\r\nhand. Heaven forgive me, they do not know that we can see them, and\r\nthey are actually embracing!”\r\n\r\nDanglars did not lose one pang that Fernand endured.\r\n\r\n“Do you know them, Fernand?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” was the reply, in a low voice. “It is Edmond and Mercédès!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, see there, now!” said Caderousse; “and I did not recognize them!\r\nHallo, Dantès! hello, lovely damsel! Come this way, and let us know\r\nwhen the wedding is to be, for Fernand here is so obstinate he will not\r\ntell us.”\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue, will you?” said Danglars, pretending to restrain\r\nCaderousse, who, with the tenacity of drunkards, leaned out of the\r\narbor. “Try to stand upright, and let the lovers make love without\r\ninterruption. See, look at Fernand, and follow his example; he is\r\nwell-behaved!”\r\n\r\n0051m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFernand, probably excited beyond bearing, pricked by Danglars, as the\r\nbull is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen\r\nfrom his seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong\r\nupon his rival, when Mercédès, smiling and graceful, lifted up her\r\nlovely head, and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes. At this\r\nFernand recollected her threat of dying if Edmond died, and dropped\r\nagain heavily on his seat. Danglars looked at the two men, one after\r\nthe other, the one brutalized by liquor, the other overwhelmed with\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n“I shall get nothing from these fools,” he muttered; “and I am very\r\nmuch afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward. Here’s an\r\nenvious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing\r\nhis wrath, and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from\r\nunder his nose and takes on like a big baby. Yet this Catalan has eyes\r\nthat glisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards, Sicilians, and\r\nCalabrians, and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one\r\nblow. Unquestionably, Edmond’s star is in the ascendant, and he will\r\nmarry the splendid girl—he will be captain, too, and laugh at us all,\r\nunless”—a sinister smile passed over Danglars’ lips—“unless I take a\r\nhand in the affair,” he added.\r\n\r\n“Hallo!” continued Caderousse, half-rising, and with his fist on the\r\ntable, “hallo, Edmond! do you not see your friends, or are you too\r\nproud to speak to them?”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear fellow!” replied Dantès, “I am not proud, but I am happy,\r\nand happiness blinds, I think, more than pride.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, very well, that’s an explanation!” said Caderousse. “How do you\r\ndo, Madame Dantès?”\r\n\r\nMercédès courtesied gravely, and said—“That is not my name, and in my\r\ncountry it bodes ill fortune, they say, to call a young girl by the\r\nname of her betrothed before he becomes her husband. So call me\r\nMercédès, if you please.”\r\n\r\n“We must excuse our worthy neighbor, Caderousse,” said Dantès, “he is\r\nso easily mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“So, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, M. Dantès,” said\r\nDanglars, bowing to the young couple.\r\n\r\n“As soon as possible, M. Danglars; today all preliminaries will be\r\narranged at my father’s, and tomorrow, or next day at latest, the\r\nwedding festival here at La Réserve. My friends will be there, I hope;\r\nthat is to say, you are invited, M. Danglars, and you, Caderousse.”\r\n\r\n“And Fernand,” said Caderousse with a chuckle; “Fernand, too, is\r\ninvited!”\r\n\r\n“My wife’s brother is my brother,” said Edmond; “and we, Mercédès and\r\nI, should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time.”\r\n\r\nFernand opened his mouth to reply, but his voice died on his lips, and\r\nhe could not utter a word.\r\n\r\n“Today the preliminaries, tomorrow or next day the ceremony! You are in\r\na hurry, captain!”\r\n\r\n“Danglars,” said Edmond, smiling, “I will say to you as Mercédès said\r\njust now to Caderousse, ‘Do not give me a title which does not belong\r\nto me’; that may bring me bad luck.”\r\n\r\n“Your pardon,” replied Danglars, “I merely said you seemed in a hurry,\r\nand we have lots of time; the _Pharaon_ cannot be under weigh again in\r\nless than three months.”\r\n\r\n“We are always in a hurry to be happy, M. Danglars; for when we have\r\nsuffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in good\r\nfortune. But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste; I\r\nmust go to Paris.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, really?—to Paris! and will it be the first time you have ever been\r\nthere, Dantès?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Have you business there?”\r\n\r\n“Not of my own; the last commission of poor Captain Leclere; you know\r\nto what I allude, Danglars—it is sacred. Besides, I shall only take the\r\ntime to go and return.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I understand,” said Danglars, and then in a low tone, he\r\nadded, “To Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand\r\nmarshal gave him. Ah, this letter gives me an idea—a capital idea! Ah;\r\nDantès, my friend, you are not yet registered number one on board the\r\ngood ship _Pharaon_;” then turning towards Edmond, who was walking\r\naway, “A pleasant journey,” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two lovers\r\ncontinued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very\r\nelect of heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 4. Conspiracy\r\n\r\nDanglars followed Edmond and Mercédès with his eyes until the two\r\nlovers disappeared behind one of the angles of Fort Saint Nicolas;\r\nthen, turning round, he perceived Fernand, who had fallen, pale and\r\ntrembling, into his chair, while Caderousse stammered out the words of\r\na drinking-song.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear sir,” said Danglars to Fernand, “here is a marriage\r\nwhich does not appear to make everybody happy.”\r\n\r\n“It drives me to despair,” said Fernand.\r\n\r\n“Do you, then, love Mercédès?”\r\n\r\n“I adore her!”\r\n\r\n“For long?”\r\n\r\n“As long as I have known her—always.”\r\n\r\n“And you sit there, tearing your hair, instead of seeking to remedy\r\nyour condition; I did not think that was the way of your people.”\r\n\r\n“What would you have me do?” said Fernand.\r\n\r\n“How do I know? Is it my affair? I am not in love with Mademoiselle\r\nMercédès; but for you—in the words of the gospel, seek, and you shall\r\nfind.”\r\n\r\n“I have found already.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“I would stab the man, but the woman told me that if any misfortune\r\nhappened to her betrothed, she would kill herself.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! Women say those things, but never do them.”\r\n\r\n“You do not know Mercédès; what she threatens she will do.”\r\n\r\n“Idiot!” muttered Danglars; “whether she kill herself or not, what\r\nmatter, provided Dantès is not captain?”\r\n\r\n“Before Mercédès should die,” replied Fernand, with the accents of\r\nunshaken resolution, “I would die myself!”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I call love!” said Caderousse with a voice more tipsy than\r\never. “That’s love, or I don’t know what love is.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Danglars, “you appear to me a good sort of fellow, and\r\nhang me, I should like to help you, but——”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Caderousse, “but how?”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” replied Danglars, “you are three parts drunk; finish\r\nthe bottle, and you will be completely so. Drink then, and do not\r\nmeddle with what we are discussing, for that requires all one’s wit and\r\ncool judgment.”\r\n\r\n“I—drunk!” said Caderousse; “well that’s a good one! I could drink four\r\nmore such bottles; they are no bigger than cologne flasks. Père\r\nPamphile, more wine!”\r\n\r\nAnd Caderousse rattled his glass upon the table.\r\n\r\n“You were saying, sir——” said Fernand, awaiting with great anxiety the\r\nend of this interrupted remark.\r\n\r\n“What was I saying? I forget. This drunken Caderousse has made me lose\r\nthe thread of my sentence.”\r\n\r\n“Drunk, if you like; so much the worse for those who fear wine, for it\r\nis because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will\r\nextract from their hearts;” and Caderousse began to sing the two last\r\nlines of a song very popular at the time:\r\n\r\n‘Tous les méchants sont buveurs d’eau;\r\n\r\nC’est bien prouvé par le déluge.’1\r\n\r\n\r\n“You said, sir, you would like to help me, but——”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but I added, to help you it would be sufficient that Dantès did\r\nnot marry her you love; and the marriage may easily be thwarted,\r\nmethinks, and yet Dantès need not die.”\r\n\r\n“Death alone can separate them,” remarked Fernand.\r\n\r\n“You talk like a noodle, my friend,” said Caderousse; “and here is\r\nDanglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to\r\nyou that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you.\r\nSay there is no need why Dantès should die; it would, indeed, be a pity\r\nhe should. Dantès is a good fellow; I like Dantès. Dantès, your\r\nhealth.”\r\n\r\nFernand rose impatiently. “Let him run on,” said Danglars, restraining\r\nthe young man; “drunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says.\r\nAbsence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were\r\nbetween Edmond and Mercédès they would be as effectually separated as\r\nif he lay under a tombstone.”\r\n\r\n0056m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes; but one gets out of prison,” said Caderousse, who, with what\r\nsense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, “and when one\r\ngets out and one’s name is Edmond Dantès, one seeks revenge——”\r\n\r\n“What matters that?” muttered Fernand.\r\n\r\n“And why, I should like to know,” persisted Caderousse, “should they\r\nput Dantès in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.”\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue!” said Danglars.\r\n\r\n“I won’t hold my tongue!” replied Caderousse; “I say I want to know why\r\nthey should put Dantès in prison; I like Dantès; Dantès, your health!”\r\nand he swallowed another glass of wine.\r\n\r\n0057m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDanglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his\r\nintoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, “Well, you understand\r\nthere is no need to kill him.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of having\r\nDantès arrested. Have you that means?”\r\n\r\n“It is to be found for the searching. But why should I meddle in the\r\nmatter? it is no affair of mine.”\r\n\r\n“I know not why you meddle,” said Fernand, seizing his arm; “but this I\r\nknow, you have some motive of personal hatred against Dantès, for he\r\nwho himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others.”\r\n\r\n“I! motives of hatred against Dantès? None, on my word! I saw you were\r\nunhappy, and your unhappiness interested me; that’s all; but since you\r\nbelieve I act for my own account, adieu, my dear friend, get out of the\r\naffair as best you may;” and Danglars rose as if he meant to depart.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Fernand, restraining him, “stay! It is of very little\r\nconsequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry\r\nfeeling or not against Dantès. I hate him! I confess it openly. Do you\r\nfind the means, I will execute it, provided it is not to kill the man,\r\nfor Mercédès has declared she will kill herself if Dantès is killed.”\r\n\r\nCaderousse, who had let his head drop on the table, now raised it, and\r\nlooking at Fernand with his dull and fishy eyes, he said, “Kill Dantès!\r\nwho talks of killing Dantès? I won’t have him killed—I won’t! He’s my\r\nfriend, and this morning offered to share his money with me, as I\r\nshared mine with him. I won’t have Dantès killed—I won’t!”\r\n\r\n“And who has said a word about killing him, muddlehead?” replied\r\nDanglars. “We were merely joking; drink to his health,” he added,\r\nfilling Caderousse’s glass, “and do not interfere with us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, Dantès’ good health!” said Caderousse, emptying his glass,\r\n“here’s to his health! his health—hurrah!”\r\n\r\n“But the means—the means?” said Fernand.\r\n\r\n“Have you not hit upon any?” asked Danglars.\r\n\r\n“No!—you undertook to do so.”\r\n\r\n“True,” replied Danglars; “the French have the superiority over the\r\nSpaniards, that the Spaniards ruminate, while the French invent.”\r\n\r\n“Do you invent, then,” said Fernand impatiently.\r\n\r\n“Waiter,” said Danglars, “pen, ink, and paper.”\r\n\r\n“Pen, ink, and paper,” muttered Fernand.\r\n\r\n“Yes; I am a supercargo; pen, ink, and paper are my tools, and without\r\nmy tools I am fit for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Pen, ink, and paper, then,” called Fernand loudly.\r\n\r\n“There’s what you want on that table,” said the waiter.\r\n\r\n“Bring them here.” The waiter did as he was desired.\r\n\r\n0059m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“When one thinks,” said Caderousse, letting his hand drop on the paper,\r\n“there is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at\r\nthe corner of a wood to assassinate him! I have always had more dread\r\nof a pen, a bottle of ink, and a sheet of paper, than of a sword or\r\npistol.”\r\n\r\n“The fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be,” said Danglars. “Give\r\nhim some more wine, Fernand.” Fernand filled Caderousse’s glass, who,\r\nlike the confirmed toper he was, lifted his hand from the paper and\r\nseized the glass.\r\n\r\nThe Catalan watched him until Caderousse, almost overcome by this fresh\r\nassault on his senses, rested, or rather dropped, his glass upon the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n“Well!” resumed the Catalan, as he saw the final glimmer of\r\nCaderousse’s reason vanishing before the last glass of wine.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I should say, for instance,” resumed Danglars, “that if\r\nafter a voyage such as Dantès has just made, in which he touched at the\r\nIsland of Elba, someone were to denounce him to the king’s procureur as\r\na Bonapartist agent——”\r\n\r\n“I will denounce him!” exclaimed the young man hastily.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but they will make you then sign your declaration, and confront\r\nyou with him you have denounced; I will supply you with the means of\r\nsupporting your accusation, for I know the fact well. But Dantès cannot\r\nremain forever in prison, and one day or other he will leave it, and\r\nthe day when he comes out, woe betide him who was the cause of his\r\nincarceration!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a\r\nquarrel with me.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and Mercédès! Mercédès, who will detest you if you have only the\r\nmisfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved Edmond!”\r\n\r\n“True!” said Fernand.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” continued Danglars; “if we resolve on such a step, it would\r\nbe much better to take, as I now do, this pen, dip it into this ink,\r\nand write with the left hand (that the writing may not be recognized)\r\nthe denunciation we propose.” And Danglars, uniting practice with\r\ntheory, wrote with his left hand, and in a writing reversed from his\r\nusual style, and totally unlike it, the following lines, which he\r\nhanded to Fernand, and which Fernand read in an undertone:\r\n\r\n“The honorable, the king’s attorney, is informed by a friend of the\r\nthrone and religion, that one Edmond Dantès, mate of the ship\r\n_Pharaon_, arrived this morning from Smyrna, after having touched at\r\nNaples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been intrusted by Murat with a letter for\r\nthe usurper, and by the usurper with a letter for the Bonapartist\r\ncommittee in Paris. Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him,\r\nfor the letter will be found upon him, or at his father’s, or in his\r\ncabin on board the _Pharaon_.”\r\n\r\n“Very good,” resumed Danglars; “now your revenge looks like common\r\nsense, for in no way can it revert to yourself, and the matter will\r\nthus work its own way; there is nothing to do now but fold the letter\r\nas I am doing, and write upon it, ‘To the king’s attorney,’ and that’s\r\nall settled.” And Danglars wrote the address as he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and that’s all settled!” exclaimed Caderousse, who, by a last\r\neffort of intellect, had followed the reading of the letter, and\r\ninstinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation\r\nmust entail. “Yes, and that’s all settled; only it will be an infamous\r\nshame;” and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Danglars, taking it from beyond his reach; “and as what I\r\nsay and do is merely in jest, and I, amongst the first and foremost,\r\nshould be sorry if anything happened to Dantès—the worthy Dantès—look\r\nhere!” And taking the letter, he squeezed it up in his hands and threw\r\nit into a corner of the arbor.\r\n\r\n“All right!” said Caderousse. “Dantès is my friend, and I won’t have\r\nhim ill-used.”\r\n\r\n“And who thinks of using him ill? Certainly neither I nor Fernand,”\r\nsaid Danglars, rising and looking at the young man, who still remained\r\nseated, but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper\r\nflung into the corner.\r\n\r\n“In this case,” replied Caderousse, “let’s have some more wine. I wish\r\nto drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely Mercédès.”\r\n\r\n“You have had too much already, drunkard,” said Danglars; “and if you\r\ncontinue, you will be compelled to sleep here, because unable to stand\r\non your legs.”\r\n\r\n“I?” said Caderousse, rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken\r\nman, “I can’t keep on my legs? Why, I’ll wager I can go up into the\r\nbelfry of the Accoules, and without staggering, too!”\r\n\r\n“Done!” said Danglars, “I’ll take your bet; but tomorrow—today it is\r\ntime to return. Give me your arm, and let us go.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, let us go,” said Caderousse; “but I don’t want your arm at\r\nall. Come, Fernand, won’t you return to Marseilles with us?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Fernand; “I shall return to the Catalans.”\r\n\r\n“You’re wrong. Come with us to Marseilles—come along.”\r\n\r\n“I will not.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean? you will not? Well, just as you like, my prince;\r\nthere’s liberty for all the world. Come along, Danglars, and let the\r\nyoung gentleman return to the Catalans if he chooses.”\r\n\r\nDanglars took advantage of Caderousse’s temper at the moment, to take\r\nhim off towards Marseilles by the Porte Saint-Victor, staggering as he\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nWhen they had advanced about twenty yards, Danglars looked back and saw\r\nFernand stoop, pick up the crumpled paper, and putting it into his\r\npocket then rush out of the arbor towards Pillon.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Caderousse, “why, what a lie he told! He said he was going\r\nto the Catalans, and he is going to the city. Hallo, Fernand! You are\r\ncoming, my boy!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you don’t see straight,” said Danglars; “he’s gone right by the\r\nroad to the Vieilles Infirmeries.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Caderousse, “I should have sworn that he turned to the\r\nright—how treacherous wine is!”\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said Danglars to himself, “now the thing is at work and\r\nit will effect its purpose unassisted.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast\r\n\r\nThe morning’s sun rose clear and resplendent, touching the foamy waves\r\ninto a network of ruby-tinted light.\r\n\r\nThe feast had been made ready on the second floor at La Réserve, with\r\nwhose arbor the reader is already familiar. The apartment destined for\r\nthe purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows, over each\r\nof which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the\r\nname of one of the principal cities of France; beneath these windows a\r\nwooden balcony extended the entire length of the house. And although\r\nthe entertainment was fixed for twelve o’clock, an hour previous to\r\nthat time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests,\r\nconsisting of the favored part of the crew of the _Pharaon_, and other\r\npersonal friends of the bridegroom, the whole of whom had arrayed\r\nthemselves in their choicest costumes, in order to do greater honor to\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\nVarious rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the\r\n_Pharaon_ had promised to attend the nuptial feast; but all seemed\r\nunanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding\r\ncondescension could possibly be intended.\r\n\r\nDanglars, however, who now made his appearance, accompanied by\r\nCaderousse, effectually confirmed the report, stating that he had\r\nrecently conversed with M. Morrel, who had himself assured him of his\r\nintention to dine at La Réserve.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a moment later M. Morrel appeared and was saluted with an\r\nenthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the _Pharaon_, who\r\nhailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man\r\nwhose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first\r\nin command of the ship; and as Dantès was universally beloved on board\r\nhis vessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at\r\nfinding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly\r\ncoincided with their own.\r\n\r\nWith the entrance of M. Morrel, Danglars and Caderousse were despatched\r\nin search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the\r\narrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a\r\nlively sensation, and to beseech him to make haste.\r\n\r\nDanglars and Caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed; but\r\nere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards\r\nthem, composed of the betrothed pair, a party of young girls in\r\nattendance on the bride, by whose side walked Dantès’ father; the whole\r\nbrought up by Fernand, whose lips wore their usual sinister smile.\r\n\r\nNeither Mercédès nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his\r\ncountenance; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the\r\nsunshine and the presence of each other.\r\n\r\nHaving acquitted themselves of their errand, and exchanged a hearty\r\nshake of the hand with Edmond, Danglars and Caderousse took their\r\nplaces beside Fernand and old Dantès,—the latter of whom attracted\r\nuniversal notice.\r\n\r\nThe old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk, trimmed\r\nwith steel buttons, beautifully cut and polished. His thin but wiry\r\nlegs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings,\r\nevidently of English manufacture, while from his three-cornered hat\r\ndepended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons. Thus he came\r\nalong, supporting himself on a curiously carved stick, his aged\r\ncountenance lit up with happiness, looking for all the world like one\r\nof the aged dandies of 1796, parading the newly opened gardens of the\r\nLuxembourg and Tuileries.\r\n\r\nBeside him glided Caderousse, whose desire to partake of the good\r\nthings provided for the wedding party had induced him to become\r\nreconciled to the Dantès, father and son, although there still lingered\r\nin his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the\r\npreceding night; just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the\r\ndim and misty outline of a dream.\r\n\r\n0065m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Danglars approached the disappointed lover, he cast on him a look of\r\ndeep meaning, while Fernand, as he slowly paced behind the happy pair,\r\nwho seemed, in their own unmixed content, to have entirely forgotten\r\nthat such a being as himself existed, was pale and abstracted;\r\noccasionally, however, a deep flush would overspread his countenance,\r\nand a nervous contraction distort his features, while, with an agitated\r\nand restless gaze, he would glance in the direction of Marseilles, like\r\none who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event.\r\n\r\nDantès himself was simply, but becomingly, clad in the dress peculiar\r\nto the merchant service—a costume somewhat between a military and a\r\ncivil garb; and with his fine countenance, radiant with joy and\r\nhappiness, a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nLovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios, Mercédès boasted the same\r\nbright flashing eyes of jet, and ripe, round, coral lips. She moved\r\nwith the light, free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalusian. One more\r\npracticed in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes\r\nbeneath a veil, or, at least, have cast down her thickly fringed\r\nlashes, so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes;\r\nbut, on the contrary, the delighted girl looked around her with a smile\r\nthat seemed to say: “If you are my friends, rejoice with me, for I am\r\nvery happy.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as the bridal party came in sight of La Réserve, M. Morrel\r\ndescended and came forth to meet it, followed by the soldiers and\r\nsailors there assembled, to whom he had repeated the promise already\r\ngiven, that Dantès should be the successor to the late Captain Leclere.\r\nEdmond, at the approach of his patron, respectfully placed the arm of\r\nhis affianced bride within that of M. Morrel, who, forthwith conducting\r\nher up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the\r\nfeast was prepared, was gayly followed by the guests, beneath whose\r\nheavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of\r\nseveral minutes.\r\n\r\n“Father,” said Mercédès, stopping when she had reached the centre of\r\nthe table, “sit, I pray you, on my right hand; on my left I will place\r\nhim who has ever been as a brother to me,” pointing with a soft and\r\ngentle smile to Fernand; but her words and look seemed to inflict the\r\ndirest torture on him, for his lips became ghastly pale, and even\r\nbeneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen\r\nretreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Dantès, at the opposite side of the table, had been\r\noccupied in similarly placing his most honored guests. M. Morrel was\r\nseated at his right hand, Danglars at his left; while, at a sign from\r\nEdmond, the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nThen they began to pass around the dusky, piquant, Arlesian sausages,\r\nand lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses, prawns of large size and\r\nbrilliant color, the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel\r\nwithin, the clovis, esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than\r\nrivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster, North. All the\r\ndelicacies, in fact, that are cast up by the wash of waters on the\r\nsandy beach, and styled by the grateful fishermen “fruits of the sea.”\r\n\r\n“A pretty silence truly!” said the old father of the bridegroom, as he\r\ncarried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the\r\ntopaz, and which had just been placed before Mercédès herself. “Now,\r\nwould anybody think that this room contained a happy, merry party, who\r\ndesire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” sighed Caderousse, “a man cannot always feel happy because he is\r\nabout to be married.”\r\n\r\n“The truth is,” replied Dantès, “that I am too happy for noisy mirth;\r\nif that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy friend, you\r\nare right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to oppress us\r\nalmost the same as sorrow.”\r\n\r\nDanglars looked towards Fernand, whose excitable nature received and\r\nbetrayed each fresh impression.\r\n\r\n“Why, what ails you?” asked he of Edmond. “Do you fear any approaching\r\nevil? I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this\r\ninstant.”\r\n\r\n“And that is the very thing that alarms me,” returned Dantès. “Man does\r\nnot appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed; happiness\r\nis like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood, where\r\nfierce, fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach; and monsters of\r\nall shapes and kinds, requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours. I\r\nown that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of\r\nwhich I feel myself unworthy—that of being the husband of Mercédès.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, nay!” cried Caderousse, smiling, “you have not attained that\r\nhonor yet. Mercédès is not yet your wife. Just assume the tone and\r\nmanner of a husband, and see how she will remind you that your hour is\r\nnot yet come!”\r\n\r\nThe bride blushed, while Fernand, restless and uneasy, seemed to start\r\nat every fresh sound, and from time to time wiped away the large drops\r\nof perspiration that gathered on his brow.\r\n\r\n“Well, never mind that, neighbor Caderousse; it is not worthwhile to\r\ncontradict me for such a trifle as that. ’Tis true that Mercédès is not\r\nactually my wife; but,” added he, drawing out his watch, “in an hour\r\nand a half she will be.”\r\n\r\nA general exclamation of surprise ran round the table, with the\r\nexception of the elder Dantès, whose laugh displayed the still perfect\r\nbeauty of his large white teeth. Mercédès looked pleased and gratified,\r\nwhile Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch.\r\n\r\n“In an hour?” inquired Danglars, turning pale. “How is that, my\r\nfriend?”\r\n\r\n“Why, thus it is,” replied Dantès. “Thanks to the influence of M.\r\nMorrel, to whom, next to my father, I owe every blessing I enjoy, every\r\ndifficulty has been removed. We have purchased permission to waive the\r\nusual delay; and at half-past two o’clock the Mayor of Marseilles will\r\nbe waiting for us at the city hall. Now, as a quarter-past one has\r\nalready struck, I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying,\r\nthat, in another hour and thirty minutes Mercédès will have become\r\nMadame Dantès.”\r\n\r\n0069m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFernand closed his eyes, a burning sensation passed across his brow,\r\nand he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his\r\nfalling from his chair; but in spite of all his efforts, he could not\r\nrefrain from uttering a deep groan, which, however, was lost amid the\r\nnoisy felicitations of the company.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” cried the old man, “you make short work of this kind of\r\naffair. Arrived here only yesterday morning, and married today at three\r\no’clock! Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work!”\r\n\r\n“But,” asked Danglars, in a timid tone, “how did you manage about the\r\nother formalities—the contract—the settlement?”\r\n\r\n“The contract,” answered Dantès, laughingly, “it didn’t take long to\r\nfix that. Mercédès has no fortune; I have none to settle on her. So,\r\nyou see, our papers were quickly written out, and certainly do not come\r\nvery expensive.” This joke elicited a fresh burst of applause.\r\n\r\n“So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to\r\nbe the actual wedding dinner!” said Danglars.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” answered Dantès; “don’t imagine I am going to put you off in\r\nthat shabby manner. Tomorrow morning I start for Paris; four days to\r\ngo, and the same to return, with one day to discharge the commission\r\nentrusted to me, is all the time I shall be absent. I shall be back\r\nhere by the first of March, and on the second I give my real marriage\r\nfeast.”\r\n\r\nThis prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests\r\nto such a degree, that the elder Dantès, who, at the commencement of\r\nthe repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found it\r\ndifficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a moment’s\r\ntranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the\r\nbride and bridegroom.\r\n\r\nDantès, perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father, responded\r\nby a look of grateful pleasure; while Mercédès glanced at the clock and\r\nmade an expressive gesture to Edmond.\r\n\r\nAround the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at\r\nsuch a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social\r\nposition not to feel the trammels of etiquette. Such as at the\r\ncommencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves\r\naccording to their inclination rose unceremoniously, and sought out\r\nmore agreeable companions. Everybody talked at once, without waiting\r\nfor a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or\r\nher own thoughts.\r\n\r\nFernand’s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Danglars. As\r\nfor Fernand himself, he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the\r\ndamned; unable to rest, he was among the first to quit the table, and,\r\nas though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such\r\ndeafening sounds, he continued, in utter silence, to pace the farther\r\nend of the salon.\r\n\r\nCaderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed most\r\nanxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” said Caderousse, from whose mind the friendly treatment\r\nof Dantès, united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken\r\nof, had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at Dantès’ good\r\nfortune,—“upon my word, Dantès is a downright good fellow, and when I\r\nsee him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be. I\r\ncannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him\r\nthat trick you were planning yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, there was no harm meant,” answered Danglars; “at first I certainly\r\ndid feel somewhat uneasy as to what Fernand might be tempted to do; but\r\nwhen I saw how completely he had mastered his feelings, even so far as\r\nto become one of his rival’s attendants, I knew there was no further\r\ncause for apprehension.” Caderousse looked full at Fernand—he was\r\nghastly pale.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” continued Danglars, “the sacrifice was no trifling one,\r\nwhen the beauty of the bride is concerned. Upon my soul, that future\r\ncaptain of mine is a lucky dog! Gad! I only wish he would let me take\r\nhis place.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we not set forth?” asked the sweet, silvery voice of Mercédès;\r\n“two o’clock has just struck, and you know we are expected in a quarter\r\nof an hour.”\r\n\r\n0071m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“To be sure!—to be sure!” cried Dantès, eagerly quitting the table;\r\n“let us go directly!”\r\n\r\nHis words were re-echoed by the whole party, with vociferous cheers.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Danglars, who had been incessantly observing every\r\nchange in Fernand’s look and manner, saw him stagger and fall back,\r\nwith an almost convulsive spasm, against a seat placed near one of the\r\nopen windows. At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct\r\nsound on the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with\r\nthe clanking of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and\r\nbuzz as of many voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the\r\nbridal party, among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension\r\nquelled every disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most\r\ndeathlike stillness prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe sounds drew nearer. Three blows were struck upon the panel of the\r\ndoor. The company looked at each other in consternation.\r\n\r\n“I demand admittance,” said a loud voice outside the room, “in the name\r\nof the law!” As no attempt was made to prevent it, the door was opened,\r\nand a magistrate, wearing his official scarf, presented himself,\r\nfollowed by four soldiers and a corporal. Uneasiness now yielded to the\r\nmost extreme dread on the part of those present.\r\n\r\n“May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit?” said M.\r\nMorrel, addressing the magistrate, whom he evidently knew; “there is\r\ndoubtless some mistake easily explained.”\r\n\r\n“If it be so,” replied the magistrate, “rely upon every reparation\r\nbeing made; meanwhile, I am the bearer of an order of arrest, and\r\nalthough I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me, it must,\r\nnevertheless, be fulfilled. Who among the persons here assembled\r\nanswers to the name of Edmond Dantès?”\r\n\r\nEvery eye was turned towards the young man who, spite of the agitation\r\nhe could not but feel, advanced with dignity, and said, in a firm\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n“I am he; what is your pleasure with me?”\r\n\r\n“Edmond Dantès,” replied the magistrate, “I arrest you in the name of\r\nthe law!”\r\n\r\n“Me!” repeated Edmond, slightly changing color, “and wherefore, I\r\npray?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons\r\nthat have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary\r\nexamination.”\r\n\r\nM. Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless. He\r\nsaw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly\r\nwell knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate\r\ndecked with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold\r\nmarble effigy. Old Dantès, however, sprang forward. There are\r\nsituations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to\r\nunderstand. He prayed and supplicated in terms so moving, that even the\r\nofficer was touched, and, although firm in his duty, he kindly said,\r\n“My worthy friend, let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions. Your\r\nson has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in\r\nregistering his cargo, and it is more than probable he will be set at\r\nliberty directly he has given the information required, whether\r\ntouching the health of his crew, or the value of his freight.”\r\n\r\n“What is the meaning of all this?” inquired Caderousse, frowningly, of\r\nDanglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise.\r\n\r\n0073m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“How can I tell you?” replied he; “I am, like yourself, utterly\r\nbewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make out\r\nwhat it is about.” Caderousse then looked around for Fernand, but he\r\nhad disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with\r\nstartling clearness. The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed\r\nappeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication\r\nof the evening before had raised between himself and his memory.\r\n\r\n“So, so,” said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to Danglars, “this,\r\nthen, I suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday?\r\nAll I can say is, that if it be so, ’tis an ill turn, and well deserves\r\nto bring double evil on those who have projected it.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” returned Danglars, “I tell you again I have nothing\r\nwhatever to do with it; besides, you know very well that I tore the\r\npaper to pieces.”\r\n\r\n“No, you did not!” answered Caderousse, “you merely threw it by—I saw\r\nit lying in a corner.”\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue, you fool!—what should you know about it?—why, you\r\nwere drunk!”\r\n\r\n“Where is Fernand?” inquired Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“How do I know?” replied Danglars; “gone, as every prudent man ought to\r\nbe, to look after his own affairs, most likely. Never mind where he is,\r\nlet you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor friends.”\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation, Dantès, after having exchanged a cheerful\r\nshake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends, had surrendered\r\nhimself to the officer sent to arrest him, merely saying, “Make\r\nyourselves quite easy, my good fellows, there is some little mistake to\r\nclear up, that’s all, depend upon it; and very likely I may not have to\r\ngo so far as the prison to effect that.”\r\n\r\n0075m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, to be sure!” responded Danglars, who had now approached the group,\r\n“nothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain.”\r\n\r\nDantès descended the staircase, preceded by the magistrate, and\r\nfollowed by the soldiers. A carriage awaited him at the door; he got\r\nin, followed by two soldiers and the magistrate, and the vehicle drove\r\noff towards Marseilles.\r\n\r\n“Adieu, adieu, dearest Edmond!” cried Mercédès, stretching out her arms\r\nto him from the balcony.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner heard the cry, which sounded like the sob of a broken\r\nheart, and leaning from the coach he called out, “Good-bye, Mercédès—we\r\nshall soon meet again!” Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the\r\nturnings of Fort Saint Nicholas.\r\n\r\n“Wait for me here, all of you!” cried M. Morrel; “I will take the first\r\nconveyance I find, and hurry to Marseilles, whence I will bring you\r\nword how all is going on.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right!” exclaimed a multitude of voices, “go, and return as\r\nquickly as you can!”\r\n\r\nThis second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of\r\nterrified silence on the part of those who were left behind. The old\r\nfather and Mercédès remained for some time apart, each absorbed in\r\ngrief; but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their\r\neyes, and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other’s\r\narms.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass\r\nof water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit\r\ndown at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed\r\nnext to the seat on which poor Mercédès had fallen half fainting, when\r\nreleased from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dantès.\r\nInstinctively Fernand drew back his chair.\r\n\r\n“He is the cause of all this misery—I am quite sure of it,” whispered\r\nCaderousse, who had never taken his eyes off Fernand, to Danglars.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so,” answered the other; “he’s too stupid to imagine\r\nsuch a scheme. I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of\r\nwhoever wrought it.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mention those who aided and abetted the deed,” said\r\nCaderousse.\r\n\r\n“Surely,” answered Danglars, “one cannot be held responsible for every\r\nchance arrow shot into the air.”\r\n\r\n“You can, indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on somebody’s\r\nhead.”\r\n\r\nMeantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every\r\ndifferent form.\r\n\r\n“What think you, Danglars,” said one of the party, turning towards him,\r\n“of this event?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” replied he, “I think it just possible Dantès may have been\r\ndetected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as\r\ncontraband.”\r\n\r\n“But how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars, since\r\nyou are the ship’s supercargo?”\r\n\r\n“Why, as for that, I could only know what I was told respecting the\r\nmerchandise with which the vessel was laden. I know she was loaded with\r\ncotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastret’s\r\nwarehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascal’s; that is all I was obliged to\r\nknow, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars.”\r\n\r\n“Now I recollect,” said the afflicted old father; “my poor boy told me\r\nyesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another of tobacco for\r\nme!”\r\n\r\n“There, you see,” exclaimed Danglars. “Now the mischief is out; depend\r\nupon it the custom-house people went rummaging about the ship in our\r\nabsence, and discovered poor Dantès’ hidden treasures.”\r\n\r\nMercédès, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her lover’s\r\narrest. Her grief, which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst\r\nout in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said the old man, “be comforted, my poor child; there is\r\nstill hope!”\r\n\r\n“Hope!” repeated Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Hope!” faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die away on\r\nhis pale agitated lips, and a convulsive spasm passed over his\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n“Good news! good news!” shouted forth one of the party stationed in the\r\nbalcony on the lookout. “Here comes M. Morrel back. No doubt, now, we\r\nshall hear that our friend is released!”\r\n\r\nMercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him\r\nat the door. He was very pale.\r\n\r\n“What news?” exclaimed a general burst of voices.\r\n\r\n“Alas, my friends,” replied M. Morrel, with a mournful shake of his\r\nhead, “the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I expected.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, indeed—indeed, sir, he is innocent!” sobbed forth Mercédès.\r\n\r\n“That I believe!” answered M. Morrel; “but still he is charged——”\r\n\r\n“With what?” inquired the elder Dantès.\r\n\r\n“With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!” Many of our readers\r\nmay be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in\r\nthe period at which our story is dated.\r\n\r\nA despairing cry escaped the pale lips of Mercédès; the old man sank\r\ninto a chair.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Danglars!” whispered Caderousse, “you have deceived me—the trick\r\nyou spoke of last night has been played; but I cannot suffer a poor old\r\nman or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault. I am\r\ndetermined to tell them all about it.”\r\n\r\n“Be silent, you simpleton!” cried Danglars, grasping him by the arm,\r\n“or I will not answer even for your own safety. Who can tell whether\r\nDantès be innocent or guilty? The vessel did touch at Elba, where he\r\nquitted it, and passed a whole day in the island. Now, should any\r\nletters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon\r\nhim, will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his\r\naccomplices?”\r\n\r\nWith the rapid instinct of selfishness, Caderousse readily perceived\r\nthe solidity of this mode of reasoning; he gazed, doubtfully,\r\nwistfully, on Danglars, and then caution supplanted generosity.\r\n\r\n“Suppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it,” said he, casting a\r\nbewildered look on his companion.\r\n\r\n“To be sure!” answered Danglars. “Let us wait, by all means. If he be\r\ninnocent, of course he will be set at liberty; if guilty, why, it is no\r\nuse involving ourselves in a conspiracy.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go, then. I cannot stay here any longer.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart!” replied Danglars, pleased to find the other so\r\ntractable. “Let us take ourselves out of the way, and leave things for\r\nthe present to take their course.”\r\n\r\nAfter their departure, Fernand, who had now again become the friend and\r\nprotector of Mercédès, led the girl to her home, while some friends of\r\nDantès conducted his father, nearly lifeless, to the Allées de Meilhan.\r\n\r\nThe rumor of Edmond’s arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in\r\ncirculating throughout the city.\r\n\r\n“Could you ever have credited such a thing, my dear Danglars?” asked M.\r\nMorrel, as, on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh\r\ntidings of Dantès, from M. de Villefort, the assistant procureur, he\r\novertook his supercargo and Caderousse. “Could you have believed such a\r\nthing possible?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you know I told you,” replied Danglars, “that I considered the\r\ncircumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very\r\nsuspicious circumstance.”\r\n\r\n“And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?”\r\n\r\n0079m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Certainly not!” returned Danglars. Then added in a low whisper, “You\r\nunderstand that, on account of your uncle, M. Policar Morrel, who\r\nserved under the _other_ government, and who does not altogether\r\nconceal what he thinks on the subject, you are strongly suspected of\r\nregretting the abdication of Napoleon. I should have feared to injure\r\nboth Edmond and yourself, had I divulged my own apprehensions to a\r\nsoul. I am too well aware that though a subordinate, like myself, is\r\nbound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs, there are\r\nmany things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis well, Danglars—’tis well!” replied M. Morrel. “You are a worthy\r\nfellow; and I had already thought of your interests in the event of\r\npoor Edmond having become captain of the _Pharaon_.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible you were so kind?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed; I had previously inquired of Dantès what was his opinion\r\nof you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your\r\npost, for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you.”\r\n\r\n“And what was his reply?”\r\n\r\n“That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair\r\nwhich he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that\r\nwhoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship’s owners\r\nwould have his preference also.”\r\n\r\n“The hypocrite!” murmured Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Poor Dantès!” said Caderousse. “No one can deny his being a\r\nnoble-hearted young fellow.”\r\n\r\n“But meanwhile,” continued M. Morrel, “here is the _Pharaon_ without a\r\ncaptain.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” replied Danglars, “since we cannot leave this port for the next\r\nthree months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dantès\r\nwill be set at liberty.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt; but in the meantime?”\r\n\r\n“I am entirely at your service, M. Morrel,” answered Danglars. “You\r\nknow that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced\r\ncaptain in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to you to\r\naccept my services, that upon Edmond’s release from prison no further\r\nchange will be requisite on board the _Pharaon_ than for Dantès and\r\nmyself each to resume our respective posts.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, Danglars—that will smooth over all difficulties. I fully\r\nauthorize you at once to assume the command of the _Pharaon_, and look\r\ncarefully to the unloading of her freight. Private misfortunes must\r\nnever be allowed to interfere with business.”\r\n\r\n“Be easy on that score, M. Morrel; but do you think we shall be\r\npermitted to see our poor Edmond?”\r\n\r\n“I will let you know that directly I have seen M. de Villefort, whom I\r\nshall endeavor to interest in Edmond’s favor. I am aware he is a\r\nfurious royalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being king’s\r\nattorney, he is a man like ourselves, and I fancy not a bad sort of\r\none.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not,” replied Danglars; “but I hear that he is ambitious, and\r\nthat’s rather against him.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” returned M. Morrel, “we shall see. But now hasten on\r\nboard, I will join you there ere long.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies, and proceeded\r\nin the direction of the Palais de Justice.\r\n\r\n0081m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Danglars, addressing Caderousse, “the turn things have\r\ntaken. Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence?”\r\n\r\n“Not the slightest, but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere\r\njoke should lead to such consequences.”\r\n\r\n“But who perpetrated that joke, let me ask? neither you nor myself, but\r\nFernand; you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of the\r\nroom—indeed, I fancied I had destroyed it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” replied Caderousse, “that I can answer for, you did not. I\r\nonly wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying all crushed\r\nand crumpled in a corner of the arbor.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, if you did, depend upon it, Fernand picked it up, and\r\neither copied it or caused it to be copied; perhaps, even, he did not\r\ntake the trouble of recopying it. And now I think of it, by Heavens, he\r\nmay have sent the letter itself! Fortunately, for me, the handwriting\r\nwas disguised.”\r\n\r\n“Then you were aware of Dantès being engaged in a conspiracy?”\r\n\r\n“Not I. As I before said, I thought the whole thing was a joke, nothing\r\nmore. It seems, however, that I have unconsciously stumbled upon the\r\ntruth.”\r\n\r\n“Still,” argued Caderousse, “I would give a great deal if nothing of\r\nthe kind had happened; or, at least, that I had had no hand in it. You\r\nwill see, Danglars, that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! If any harm come of it, it should fall on the guilty person;\r\nand that, you know, is Fernand. How can we be implicated in any way?\r\nAll we have got to do is, to keep our own counsel, and remain perfectly\r\nquiet, not breathing a word to any living soul; and you will see that\r\nthe storm will pass away without in the least affecting us.”\r\n\r\n“Amen!” responded Caderousse, waving his hand in token of adieu to\r\nDanglars, and bending his steps towards the Allées de Meilhan, moving\r\nhis head to and fro, and muttering as he went, after the manner of one\r\nwhose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea.\r\n\r\n“So far, then,” said Danglars, mentally, “all has gone as I would have\r\nit. I am, temporarily, commander of the _Pharaon_, with the certainty\r\nof being permanently so, if that fool of a Caderousse can be persuaded\r\nto hold his tongue. My only fear is the chance of Dantès being\r\nreleased. But, there, he is in the hands of Justice; and,” added he\r\nwith a smile, “she will take her own.” So saying, he leaped into a\r\nboat, desiring to be rowed on board the _Pharaon_, where M. Morrel had\r\nagreed to meet him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 6. The Deputy Procureur du Roi\r\n\r\nIn one of the aristocratic mansions built by Puget in the Rue du Grand\r\nCours opposite the Medusa fountain, a second marriage feast was being\r\ncelebrated, almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by\r\nDantès. In this case, however, although the occasion of the\r\nentertainment was similar, the company was strikingly dissimilar.\r\nInstead of a rude mixture of sailors, soldiers, and those belonging to\r\nthe humblest grade of life, the present assembly was composed of the\r\nvery flower of Marseilles society,—magistrates who had resigned their\r\noffice during the usurper’s reign; officers who had deserted from the\r\nimperial army and joined forces with Condé; and younger members of\r\nfamilies, brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of\r\nexile would convert into a martyr, and fifteen of restoration elevate\r\nto the rank of a god.\r\n\r\nThe guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic\r\nconversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive\r\npassions that then agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily,\r\nfor five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness\r\nto the violence of party feeling.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held\r\nsovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a\r\nsmall population of five or six thousand souls,—after having been\r\naccustomed to hear the “_Vive Napoléons_” of a hundred and twenty\r\nmillions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,—was\r\nlooked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh\r\nconnection with France or claim to her throne.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates freely discussed their political views; the military\r\npart of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic, while\r\nthe women commented on the divorce of Josephine. It was not over the\r\ndownfall of the man, but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea, that\r\nthey rejoiced, and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and\r\ncheering prospect of a revivified political existence.\r\n\r\nAn old man, decorated with the cross of Saint Louis, now rose and\r\nproposed the health of King Louis XVIII. It was the Marquis de\r\nSaint-Méran. This toast, recalling at once the patient exile of\r\nHartwell and the peace-loving King of France, excited universal\r\nenthusiasm; glasses were elevated in the air _à l’Anglaise_, and the\r\nladies, snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms, strewed the\r\ntable with their floral treasures. In a word, an almost poetical fervor\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the Marquise de Saint-Méran, a woman with a stern,\r\nforbidding eye, though still noble and distinguished in appearance,\r\ndespite her fifty years—“ah, these revolutionists, who have driven us\r\nfrom those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle\r\nduring the Reign of Terror, would be compelled to own, were they here,\r\nthat all true devotion was on our side, since we were content to follow\r\nthe fortunes of a falling monarch, while they, on the contrary, made\r\ntheir fortune by worshipping the rising sun; yes, yes, they could not\r\nhelp admitting that the king, for whom we sacrificed rank, wealth, and\r\nstation was truly our ‘Louis the well-beloved,’ while their wretched\r\nusurper has been, and ever will be, to them their evil genius, their\r\n‘Napoleon the accursed.’ Am I not right, Villefort?”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, madame. I really must pray you to excuse me, but—in\r\ntruth—I was not attending to the conversation.”\r\n\r\n“Marquise, marquise!” interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the\r\ntoast, “let the young people alone; let me tell you, on one’s wedding\r\nday there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry\r\npolitics.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind, dearest mother,” said a young and lovely girl, with a\r\nprofusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid\r\ncrystal, “’tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de Villefort, so as to\r\nprevent his listening to what you said. But there—now take him—he is\r\nyour own for as long as you like. M. Villefort, I beg to remind you my\r\nmother speaks to you.”\r\n\r\n“If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly\r\ncaught, I shall be delighted to answer,” said M. de Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Never mind, Renée,” replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness\r\nthat seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however\r\nall other feelings may be withered in a woman’s nature, there is always\r\none bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the\r\nshrine of maternal love. “I forgive you. What I was saying, Villefort,\r\nwas, that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or\r\ndevotion.”\r\n\r\n“They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,”\r\nreplied the young man, “and that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the\r\nMahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious\r\nfollowers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the\r\npersonification of equality.”\r\n\r\n“He!” cried the marquise: “Napoleon the type of equality! For mercy’s\r\nsake, then, what would you call Robespierre? Come, come, do not strip\r\nthe latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican, who, to\r\nmy mind, has usurped quite enough.”\r\n\r\n0085m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Nay, madame; I would place each of these heroes on his right\r\npedestal—that of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze;\r\nthat of Napoleon on the column of the Place Vendôme. The only\r\ndifference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated\r\nby these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the\r\nequality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the\r\nguillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne.\r\nObserve,” said Villefort, smiling, “I do not mean to deny that both\r\nthese men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and\r\nthe 4th of April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy\r\nof being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil\r\norder; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust\r\nhe is forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical\r\nsatellites. Still, marquise, it has been so with other\r\nusurpers—Cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon,\r\nhad his partisans and advocates.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully\r\nrevolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the\r\nson of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.” A\r\ndeep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.\r\n\r\n“’Tis true, madame,” answered he, “that my father was a Girondin, but\r\nhe was not among the number of those who voted for the king’s death; he\r\nwas an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had\r\nwell-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father\r\nperished.”\r\n\r\n“True,” replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree\r\nat the tragic remembrance thus called up; “but bear in mind, if you\r\nplease, that our respective parents underwent persecution and\r\nproscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which\r\nI may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest\r\nadherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining\r\nthe new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin,\r\nthe Count Noirtier became a senator.”\r\n\r\n“Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that\r\nall these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.”\r\n\r\n“Suffer me, also, madame,” replied Villefort, “to add my earnest\r\nrequest to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s, that you will kindly allow\r\nthe veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What avails\r\nrecrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have\r\nlaid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his\r\npolitical principles. He was—nay, probably may still be—a Bonapartist,\r\nand is called Noirtier; I, on the contrary, am a staunch royalist, and\r\nstyle myself de Villefort. Let what may remain of revolutionary sap\r\nexhaust itself and die away with the old trunk, and condescend only to\r\nregard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the\r\nparent tree, without having the power, any more than the wish, to\r\nseparate entirely from the stock from which it sprung.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo, Villefort!” cried the marquis; “excellently well said! Come,\r\nnow, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring\r\nto persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and\r\nforgetfulness of the past.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart,” replied the marquise; “let the past be forever\r\nforgotten. I promise you it affords _me_ as little pleasure to revive\r\nit as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and\r\ninflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember, also,\r\nVillefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your\r\nfealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king\r\nconsented to forget the past, as I do” (and here she extended to him\r\nher hand)—“as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should\r\nthere fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the\r\ngovernment, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence\r\nwith rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected\r\nfamily.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the\r\ntimes in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already\r\nsuccessfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the\r\noffenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing\r\nyet.”\r\n\r\n0087m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Do you, indeed, think so?” inquired the marquise.\r\n\r\n“I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too\r\nnear France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.\r\nMarseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one\r\nfrivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists;\r\nfrom hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of\r\npersons, and assassinations in the lower.”\r\n\r\n“You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de\r\nSaint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois,\r\n“that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de\r\nSaint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”\r\n\r\n“To Saint Helena.”\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise.\r\n\r\n“An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two\r\nthousand leagues from here,” replied the count.\r\n\r\n“So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly\r\nto have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,\r\nof which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the\r\nsovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and\r\nwe cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, we shall find some way out of it,” responded M. de Salvieux.\r\n“There wasn’t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of\r\nshooting the poor Duc d’Enghien.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the marquise, “it seems probable that, by the aid of the\r\nHoly Alliance, we shall be rid of Napoleon; and we must trust to the\r\nvigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans. The\r\nking is either a king or no king; if he be acknowledged as sovereign of\r\nFrance, he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity; and this can\r\nbest be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down\r\nevery attempt at conspiracy—’tis the best and surest means of\r\npreventing mischief.”\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately, madame,” answered Villefort, “the strong arm of the law\r\nis not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place.”\r\n\r\n“Then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, madame, the law is frequently powerless to effect this; all it\r\ncan do is to avenge the wrong done.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, M. de Villefort,” cried a beautiful young creature, daughter to\r\nthe Comte de Salvieux, and the cherished friend of Mademoiselle de\r\nSaint-Méran, “do try and get up some famous trial while we are at\r\nMarseilles. I never was in a law-court; I am told it is so very\r\namusing!”\r\n\r\n“Amusing, certainly,” replied the young man, “inasmuch as, instead of\r\nshedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre,\r\nyou behold in a law-court a case of real and genuine distress—a drama\r\nof life. The prisoner whom you there see pale, agitated, and alarmed,\r\ninstead of—as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy—going home\r\nto sup peacefully with his family, and then retiring to rest, that he\r\nmay recommence his mimic woes on the morrow,—is removed from your sight\r\nmerely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the\r\nexecutioner. I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to\r\nbear you through such a scene. Of this, however, be assured, that\r\nshould any favorable opportunity present itself, I will not fail to\r\noffer you the choice of being present.”\r\n\r\n“For shame, M. de Villefort!” said Renée, becoming quite pale; “don’t\r\nyou see how you are frightening us?—and yet you laugh.”\r\n\r\n“What would you have? ’Tis like a duel. I have already recorded\r\nsentence of death, five or six times, against the movers of political\r\nconspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened,\r\nand only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart?”\r\n\r\n“Gracious heavens, M. de Villefort,” said Renée, becoming more and more\r\nterrified; “you surely are not in earnest.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I am,” replied the young magistrate with a smile; “and in the\r\ninteresting trial that young lady is anxious to witness, the case would\r\nonly be still more aggravated. Suppose, for instance, the prisoner, as\r\nis more than probable, to have served under Napoleon—well, can you\r\nexpect for an instant, that one accustomed, at the word of his\r\ncommander, to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe, will\r\nscruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be\r\nhis personal enemy, than to slaughter his fellow-creatures, merely\r\nbecause bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey? Besides, one\r\nrequires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused, in\r\norder to lash one’s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and\r\npower. I would not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile,\r\nas though in mockery of my words. No; my pride is to see the accused\r\npale, agitated, and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire\r\nof my eloquence.” Renée uttered a smothered exclamation.\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” cried one of the guests; “that is what I call talking to some\r\npurpose.”\r\n\r\n“Just the person we require at a time like the present,” said a second.\r\n\r\n“What a splendid business that last case of yours was, my dear\r\nVillefort!” remarked a third; “I mean the trial of the man for\r\nmurdering his father. Upon my word, you killed him ere the executioner\r\nhad laid his hand upon him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, as for parricides, and such dreadful people as that,” interposed\r\nRenée, “it matters very little what is done to them; but as regards\r\npoor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed\r\nthemselves up in political intrigues——”\r\n\r\n“Why, that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit; for,\r\ndon’t you see, Renée, the king is the father of his people, and he who\r\nshall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent\r\nof thirty-two millions of souls, is a parricide upon a fearfully great\r\nscale?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything about that,” replied Renée; “but, M. de\r\nVillefort, you have promised me—have you not?—always to show mercy to\r\nthose I plead for.”\r\n\r\n“Make yourself quite easy on that point,” answered Villefort, with one\r\nof his sweetest smiles; “you and I will always consult upon our\r\nverdicts.”\r\n\r\n“My love,” said the marquise, “attend to your doves, your lap-dogs, and\r\nembroidery, but do not meddle with what you do not understand. Nowadays\r\nthe military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the\r\nbadge of honor. There is a wise Latin proverb that is very much in\r\npoint.”\r\n\r\n“_Cedant arma togæ_,” said Villefort with a bow.\r\n\r\n“I cannot speak Latin,” responded the marquise.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Renée, “I cannot help regretting you had not chosen some\r\nother profession than your own—a physician, for instance. Do you know I\r\nalways felt a shudder at the idea of even a _destroying_ angel?”\r\n\r\n“Dear, good Renée,” whispered Villefort, as he gazed with unutterable\r\ntenderness on the lovely speaker.\r\n\r\n“Let us hope, my child,” cried the marquis, “that M. de Villefort may\r\nprove the moral and political physician of this province; if so, he\r\nwill have achieved a noble work.”\r\n\r\n“And one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father’s\r\nconduct,” added the incorrigible marquise.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” replied Villefort, with a mournful smile, “I have already had\r\nthe honor to observe that my father has—at least, I hope so—abjured his\r\npast errors, and that he is, at the present moment, a firm and zealous\r\nfriend to religion and order—a better royalist, possibly, than his son;\r\nfor he has to atone for past dereliction, while I have no other impulse\r\nthan warm, decided preference and conviction.” Having made this\r\nwell-turned speech, Villefort looked carefully around to mark the\r\neffect of his oratory, much as he would have done had he been\r\naddressing the bench in open court.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, my dear Villefort,” cried the Comte de Salvieux, “that is\r\nexactly what I myself said the other day at the Tuileries, when\r\nquestioned by his majesty’s principal chamberlain touching the\r\nsingularity of an alliance between the son of a Girondin and the\r\ndaughter of an officer of the Duc de Condé; and I assure you he seemed\r\nfully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences\r\nwas based upon sound and excellent principles. Then the king, who,\r\nwithout our suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted\r\nus by saying, ‘Villefort’—observe that the king did not pronounce the\r\nword Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on\r\nthat of Villefort—‘Villefort,’ said his majesty, ‘is a young man of\r\ngreat judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a figure in his\r\nprofession; I like him much, and it gave me great pleasure to hear that\r\nhe was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and Marquise de\r\nSaint-Méran. I should myself have recommended the match, had not the\r\nnoble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it.’”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express\r\nhimself so favorably of me?” asked the enraptured Villefort.\r\n\r\n“I give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid, he\r\nwill confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to\r\nhim, when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of\r\nyour espousing his daughter.”\r\n\r\n0091m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“That is true,” answered the marquis.\r\n\r\n“How much do I owe this gracious prince! What is there I would not do\r\nto evince my earnest gratitude!”\r\n\r\n“That is right,” cried the marquise. “I love to see you thus. Now,\r\nthen, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be most\r\nwelcome.”\r\n\r\n“For my part, dear mother,” interposed Renée, “I trust your wishes will\r\nnot prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty offenders, poor\r\ndebtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefort’s\r\nhands,—then I shall be contented.”\r\n\r\n“Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be\r\ncalled upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of\r\nwasps, or any other slight affection of the epidermis. If you wish to\r\nsee me the king’s attorney, you must desire for me some of those\r\nviolent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor\r\nredounds to the physician.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefort’s wish had\r\nsufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and\r\nwhispered a few words in his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table\r\nand quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon,\r\nhowever, returned, his whole face beaming with delight. Renée regarded\r\nhim with fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as\r\nthey then were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed\r\nto excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful\r\nand intelligent lover.\r\n\r\n“You were wishing just now,” said Villefort, addressing her, “that I\r\nwere a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble the\r\ndisciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in\r\n1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my\r\nbetrothal.”\r\n\r\n“And wherefore were you called away just now?” asked Mademoiselle de\r\nSaint-Méran, with an air of deep interest.\r\n\r\n“For a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the\r\nexecutioner.”\r\n\r\n“How dreadful!” exclaimed Renée, turning pale.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible?” burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to\r\nthe magistrate to hear his words.\r\n\r\n“Why, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy\r\nhas just been discovered.”\r\n\r\n“Can I believe my ears?” cried the marquise.\r\n\r\n“I will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,” said\r\nVillefort:\r\n\r\n“‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the\r\nreligious institutions of his country, that one named Edmond Dantès,\r\nmate of the ship _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having\r\ntouched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter\r\nfrom Murat to the usurper, and again taken charge of another letter\r\nfrom the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample corroboration\r\nof this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned\r\nEdmond Dantès, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him,\r\nor has it at his father’s abode. Should it not be found in the\r\npossession of father or son, then it will assuredly be discovered in\r\nthe cabin belonging to the said Dantès on board the _Pharaon_.’”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Renée, “this letter, which, after all, is but an anonymous\r\nscrawl, is not even addressed to you, but to the king’s attorney.”\r\n\r\n0093m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“True; but that gentleman being absent, his secretary, by his orders,\r\nopened his letters; thinking this one of importance, he sent for me,\r\nbut not finding me, took upon himself to give the necessary orders for\r\narresting the accused party.”\r\n\r\n“Then the guilty person is absolutely in custody?” said the marquise.\r\n\r\n“Nay, dear mother, say the accused person. You know we cannot yet\r\npronounce him guilty.”\r\n\r\n“He is in safe custody,” answered Villefort; “and rely upon it, if the\r\nletter is found, he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again,\r\nunless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman.”\r\n\r\n“And where is the unfortunate being?” asked Renée.\r\n\r\n“He is at my house.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, my friend,” interrupted the marquise, “do not neglect your\r\nduty to linger with us. You are the king’s servant, and must go\r\nwherever that service calls you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Villefort!” cried Renée, clasping her hands, and looking towards\r\nher lover with piteous earnestness, “be merciful on this the day of our\r\nbetrothal.”\r\n\r\nThe young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair\r\npleader sat, and leaning over her chair said tenderly:\r\n\r\n“To give you pleasure, my sweet Renée, I promise to show all the lenity\r\nin my power; but if the charges brought against this Bonapartist hero\r\nprove correct, why, then, you really must give me leave to order his\r\nhead to be cut off.”\r\n\r\nRenée shuddered at the word _cut_, for the growth in question had a\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“Never mind that foolish girl, Villefort,” said the marquise. “She will\r\nsoon get over these things.” So saying, Madame de Saint-Méran extended\r\nher dry bony hand to Villefort, who, while imprinting a son-in-law’s\r\nrespectful salute on it, looked at Renée, as much as to say, “I must\r\ntry and fancy ’tis your dear hand I kiss, as it should have been.”\r\n\r\n“These are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal,” sighed poor\r\nRenée.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, child!” exclaimed the angry marquise, “your folly\r\nexceeds all bounds. I should be glad to know what connection there can\r\npossibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the\r\nstate!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, mother!” murmured Renée.\r\n\r\n“Nay, madame, I pray you pardon this little traitor. I promise you that\r\nto make up for her want of loyalty, I will be most inflexibly severe;”\r\nthen casting an expressive glance at his betrothed, which seemed to\r\nsay, “Fear not, for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with\r\nmercy,” and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return, Villefort\r\ndeparted with paradise in his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 7. The Examination\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Villefort left the salon, than he assumed the grave air\r\nof a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands. Now, in\r\nspite of the nobility of his countenance, the command of which, like a\r\nfinished actor, he had carefully studied before the glass, it was by no\r\nmeans easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity. Except the\r\nrecollection of the line of politics his father had adopted, and which\r\nmight interfere, unless he acted with the greatest prudence, with his\r\nown career, Gérard de Villefort was as happy as a man could be. Already\r\nrich, he held a high official situation, though only twenty-seven. He\r\nwas about to marry a young and charming woman, whom he loved, not\r\npassionately, but reasonably, as became a deputy attorney of the king;\r\nand besides her personal attractions, which were very great,\r\nMademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s family possessed considerable political\r\ninfluence, which they would, of course, exert in his favor. The dowry\r\nof his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he had, besides, the\r\nprospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her\r\nfather’s death. These considerations naturally gave Villefort a feeling\r\nof such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\nAt the door he met the commissary of police, who was waiting for him.\r\nThe sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to\r\nearth; he composed his face, as we have before described, and said, “I\r\nhave read the letter, sir, and you have acted rightly in arresting this\r\nman; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the\r\nconspiracy.”\r\n\r\n“We know nothing as yet of the conspiracy, monsieur; all the papers\r\nfound have been sealed up and placed on your desk. The prisoner himself\r\nis named Edmond Dantès, mate on board the three-master the _Pharaon_,\r\ntrading in cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna, and belonging to Morrel &\r\nSon, of Marseilles.”\r\n\r\n“Before he entered the merchant service, had he ever served in the\r\nmarines?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, monsieur, he is very young.”\r\n\r\n“How old?”\r\n\r\n“Nineteen or twenty at the most.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment, and as Villefort had arrived at the corner of the Rue\r\ndes Conseils, a man, who seemed to have been waiting for him,\r\napproached; it was M. Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Ah, M. de Villefort,” cried he, “I am delighted to see you. Some of\r\nyour people have committed the strangest mistake—they have just\r\narrested Edmond Dantès, mate of my vessel.”\r\n\r\n“I know it, monsieur,” replied Villefort, “and I am now going to\r\nexamine him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Morrel, carried away by his friendship, “you do not know\r\nhim, and I do. He is the most estimable, the most trustworthy creature\r\nin the world, and I will venture to say, there is not a better seaman\r\nin all the merchant service. Oh, M. de Villefort, I beseech your\r\nindulgence for him.”\r\n\r\nVillefort, as we have seen, belonged to the aristocratic party at\r\nMarseilles, Morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the other\r\nsuspected of Bonapartism. Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel, and\r\nreplied coldly:\r\n\r\n“You are aware, monsieur, that a man may be estimable and trustworthy\r\nin private life, and the best seaman in the merchant service, and yet\r\nbe, politically speaking, a great criminal. Is it not true?”\r\n\r\nThe magistrate laid emphasis on these words, as if he wished to apply\r\nthem to the owner himself, while his eyes seemed to plunge into the\r\nheart of one who, interceding for another, had himself need of\r\nindulgence. Morrel reddened, for his own conscience was not quite clear\r\non politics; besides, what Dantès had told him of his interview with\r\nthe grand-marshal, and what the emperor had said to him, embarrassed\r\nhim. He replied, however, in a tone of deep interest:\r\n\r\n“I entreat you, M. de Villefort, be, as you always are, kind and\r\nequitable, and give him back to us soon.” This _give us_ sounded\r\nrevolutionary in the deputy’s ears.\r\n\r\n“Ah, ah,” murmured he, “is Dantès then a member of some Carbonari\r\nsociety, that his protector thus employs the collective form? He was,\r\nif I recollect, arrested in a tavern, in company with a great many\r\nothers.” Then he added, “Monsieur, you may rest assured I shall perform\r\nmy duty impartially, and that if he be innocent you shall not have\r\nappealed to me in vain; should he, however, be guilty, in this present\r\nepoch, impunity would furnish a dangerous example, and I must do my\r\nduty.”\r\n\r\n0097m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he had now arrived at the door of his own house, which adjoined the\r\nPalais de Justice, he entered, after having, coldly saluted the\r\nshipowner, who stood, as if petrified, on the spot where Villefort had\r\nleft him. The antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes, in\r\nthe midst of whom, carefully watched, but calm and smiling, stood the\r\nprisoner. Villefort traversed the antechamber, cast a side glance at\r\nDantès, and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him, disappeared,\r\nsaying, “Bring in the prisoner.”\r\n\r\nRapid as had been Villefort’s glance, it had served to give him an idea\r\nof the man he was about to interrogate. He had recognized intelligence\r\nin the high forehead, courage in the dark eye and bent brow, and\r\nfrankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth.\r\nVillefort’s first impression was favorable; but he had been so often\r\nwarned to mistrust first impulses, that he applied the maxim to the\r\nimpression, forgetting the difference between the two words. He\r\nstifled, therefore, the feelings of compassion that were rising,\r\ncomposed his features, and sat down, grim and sombre, at his desk. An\r\ninstant after Dantès entered. He was pale, but calm and collected, and\r\nsaluting his judge with easy politeness, looked round for a seat, as if\r\nhe had been in M. Morrel’s salon. It was then that he encountered for\r\nthe first time Villefort’s look,—that look peculiar to the magistrate,\r\nwho, while seeming to read the thoughts of others, betrays nothing of\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\n“Who and what are you?” demanded Villefort, turning over a pile of\r\npapers, containing information relative to the prisoner, that a police\r\nagent had given to him on his entry, and that, already, in an hour’s\r\ntime, had swelled to voluminous proportions, thanks to the corrupt\r\nespionage of which “the accused” is always made the victim.\r\n\r\n“My name is Edmond Dantès,” replied the young man calmly; “I am mate of\r\nthe _Pharaon_, belonging to Messrs. Morrel & Son.”\r\n\r\n“Your age?” continued Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Nineteen,” returned Dantès.\r\n\r\n“What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?”\r\n\r\n“I was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,” said the young man,\r\nhis voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between that\r\nhappy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great\r\nwas the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the\r\nradiant face of Mercédès.\r\n\r\n“You were at the festival of your marriage?” said the deputy,\r\nshuddering in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been\r\nattached to for three years.” Villefort, impassive as he was, was\r\nstruck with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of Dantès,\r\nsurprised in the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in\r\nhis own bosom—he also was on the point of being married, and he was\r\nsummoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another. “This\r\nphilosophic reflection,” thought he, “will make a great sensation at M.\r\nde Saint-Méran’s;” and he arranged mentally, while Dantès awaited\r\nfurther questions, the antithesis by which orators often create a\r\nreputation for eloquence. When this speech was arranged, Villefort\r\nturned to Dantès.\r\n\r\n0099m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Go on, sir,” said he.\r\n\r\n“What would you have me say?”\r\n\r\n“Give all the information in your power.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I\r\nknow; only,” added he, with a smile, “I warn you I know very little.”\r\n\r\n“Have you served under the usurper?”\r\n\r\n“I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.”\r\n\r\n“It is reported your political opinions are extreme,” said Villefort,\r\nwho had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make\r\nthis inquiry, as if it were an accusation.\r\n\r\n“My political opinions!” replied Dantès. “Alas, sir, I never had any\r\nopinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play.\r\nIf I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel. Thus\r\nall my opinions—I will not say public, but private—are confined to\r\nthese three sentiments,—I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and I\r\nadore Mercédès. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how\r\nuninteresting it is.” As Dantès spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous\r\nand open countenance, and recollected the words of Renée, who, without\r\nknowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him. With\r\nthe deputy’s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man\r\nuttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, for he\r\nwas scarcely a man,—simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of\r\nthe heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody,\r\nbecause he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked\r\ngood—extended his affection even to his judge, spite of Villefort’s\r\nsevere look and stern accent. Dantès seemed full of kindness.\r\n\r\n_“Pardieu!”_ said Villefort, “he is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain\r\nRenée’s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on\r\nme. I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet\r\nkiss in private.” Full of this idea, Villefort’s face became so joyous,\r\nthat when he turned to Dantès, the latter, who had watched the change\r\non his physiognomy, was smiling also.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Villefort, “have you any enemies, at least, that you know.”\r\n\r\n“I have enemies?” replied Dantès; “my position is not sufficiently\r\nelevated for that. As for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat\r\ntoo hasty; but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or twelve\r\nsailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that\r\nthey love and respect me, not as a father, for I am too young, but as\r\nan elder brother.”\r\n\r\n“But you may have excited jealousy. You are about to become captain at\r\nnineteen—an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl, who\r\nloves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the\r\nenvy of someone.”\r\n\r\n“You are right; you know men better than I do, and what you say may\r\npossibly be the case, I confess; but if such persons are among my\r\nacquaintances I prefer not to know it, because then I should be forced\r\nto hate them.”\r\n\r\n“You are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you. You\r\nseem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty\r\nto aid you in discovering the author of this accusation. Here is the\r\npaper; do you know the writing?” As he spoke, Villefort drew the letter\r\nfrom his pocket, and presented it to Dantès. Dantès read it. A cloud\r\npassed over his brow as he said:\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur, I do not know the writing, and yet it is tolerably\r\nplain. Whoever did it writes well. I am very fortunate,” added he,\r\nlooking gratefully at Villefort, “to be examined by such a man as you;\r\nfor this envious person is a real enemy.” And by the rapid glance that\r\nthe young man’s eyes shot forth, Villefort saw how much energy lay hid\r\nbeneath this mildness.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the deputy, “answer me frankly, not as a prisoner to a\r\njudge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in him, what\r\ntruth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter?”\r\nAnd Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter Dantès had just\r\ngiven back to him.\r\n\r\n“None at all. I will tell you the real facts. I swear by my honor as a\r\nsailor, by my love for Mercédès, by the life of my father——”\r\n\r\n“Speak, monsieur,” said Villefort. Then, internally, “If Renée could\r\nsee me, I hope she would be satisfied, and would no longer call me a\r\ndecapitator.”\r\n\r\n“Well, when we quitted Naples, Captain Leclere was attacked with a\r\nbrain fever. As we had no doctor on board, and he was so anxious to\r\narrive at Elba, that he would not touch at any other port, his disorder\r\nrose to such a height, that at the end of the third day, feeling he was\r\ndying, he called me to him. ‘My dear Dantès,’ said he, ‘swear to\r\nperform what I am going to tell you, for it is a matter of the deepest\r\nimportance.’\r\n\r\n“‘I swear, captain,’ replied I.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, as after my death the command devolves on you as mate, assume\r\nthe command, and bear up for the Island of Elba, disembark at\r\nPorto-Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, give him this letter—perhaps\r\nthey will give you another letter, and charge you with a commission.\r\nYou will accomplish what I was to have done, and derive all the honor\r\nand profit from it.’\r\n\r\n“‘I will do it, captain; but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the\r\ngrand-marshal’s presence as easily as you expect?’\r\n\r\n“‘Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him, and remove every\r\ndifficulty,’ said the captain. At these words he gave me a ring. It was\r\ntime—two hours after he was delirious; the next day he died.”\r\n\r\n“And what did you do then?”\r\n\r\n“What I ought to have done, and what everyone would have done in my\r\nplace. Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred; but with\r\na sailor the last requests of his superior are commands. I sailed for\r\nthe Island of Elba, where I arrived the next day; I ordered everybody\r\nto remain on board, and went on shore alone. As I had expected, I found\r\nsome difficulty in obtaining access to the grand-marshal; but I sent\r\nthe ring I had received from the captain to him, and was instantly\r\nadmitted. He questioned me concerning Captain Leclere’s death; and, as\r\nthe latter had told me, gave me a letter to carry on to a person in\r\nParis. I undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do. I\r\nlanded here, regulated the affairs of the vessel, and hastened to visit\r\nmy affianced bride, whom I found more lovely than ever. Thanks to M.\r\nMorrel, all the forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you, at\r\nmy marriage feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and\r\ntomorrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this\r\ncharge which you as well as I now see to be unjust.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Villefort, “this seems to me the truth. If you have been\r\nculpable, it was imprudence, and this imprudence was in obedience to\r\nthe orders of your captain. Give up this letter you have brought from\r\nElba, and pass your word you will appear should you be required, and go\r\nand rejoin your friends.\r\n\r\n“I am free, then, sir?” cried Dantès joyfully.\r\n\r\n“Yes; but first give me this letter.”\r\n\r\n“You have it already, for it was taken from me with some others which I\r\nsee in that packet.”\r\n\r\n“Stop a moment,” said the deputy, as Dantès took his hat and gloves.\r\n“To whom is it addressed?”\r\n\r\n_“To Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, Paris.”_ Had a thunderbolt\r\nfallen into the room, Villefort could not have been more stupefied. He\r\nsank into his seat, and hastily turning over the packet, drew forth the\r\nfatal letter, at which he glanced with an expression of terror.\r\n\r\n“M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13,” murmured he, growing still paler.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Dantès; “do you know him?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Villefort; “a faithful servant of the king does not know\r\nconspirators.”\r\n\r\n0103m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is a conspiracy, then?” asked Dantès, who after believing himself\r\nfree, now began to feel a tenfold alarm. “I have, however, already told\r\nyou, sir, I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed,”\r\nsaid Villefort.\r\n\r\n“I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it.”\r\n\r\n“Have you shown this letter to anyone?” asked Villefort, becoming still\r\nmore pale.\r\n\r\n“To no one, on my honor.”\r\n\r\n“Everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the\r\nIsland of Elba, and addressed to M. Noirtier?”\r\n\r\n“Everybody, except the person who gave it to me.”\r\n\r\n“And that was too much, far too much,” murmured Villefort. Villefort’s\r\nbrow darkened more and more, his white lips and clenched teeth filled\r\nDantès with apprehension. After reading the letter, Villefort covered\r\nhis face with his hands.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Dantès timidly, “what is the matter?” Villefort made no\r\nanswer, but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds, and\r\nagain perused the letter.\r\n\r\n“And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?”\r\n\r\n“I give you my word of honor, sir,” said Dantès; “but what is the\r\nmatter? You are ill—shall I ring for assistance?—shall I call?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Villefort, rising hastily; “stay where you are. It is for me\r\nto give orders here, and not you.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” replied Dantès proudly, “it was only to summon assistance\r\nfor you.”\r\n\r\n“I want none; it was a temporary indisposition. Attend to yourself;\r\nanswer me.” Dantès waited, expecting a question, but in vain. Villefort\r\nfell back on his chair, passed his hand over his brow, moist with\r\nperspiration, and, for the third time, read the letter.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if he knows the contents of this!” murmured he, “and that Noirtier\r\nis the father of Villefort, I am lost!” And he fixed his eyes upon\r\nEdmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is impossible to doubt it,” cried he, suddenly.\r\n\r\n“In heaven’s name!” cried the unhappy young man, “if you doubt me,\r\nquestion me; I will answer you.” Villefort made a violent effort, and\r\nin a tone he strove to render firm:\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he, “I am no longer able, as I had hoped, to restore you\r\nimmediately to liberty; before doing so, I must consult the trial\r\njustice; what my own feeling is you already know.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, monsieur,” cried Dantès, “you have been rather a friend than a\r\njudge.”\r\n\r\n0105m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, I must detain you some time longer, but I will strive to make it\r\nas short as possible. The principal charge against you is this letter,\r\nand you see——” Villefort approached the fire, cast it in, and waited\r\nuntil it was entirely consumed.\r\n\r\n“You see, I destroy it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” exclaimed Dantès, “you are goodness itself.”\r\n\r\n“Listen,” continued Villefort; “you can now have confidence in me after\r\nwhat I have done.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, command, and I will obey.”\r\n\r\n“Listen; this is not a command, but advice I give you.”\r\n\r\n“Speak, and I will follow your advice.”\r\n\r\n“I shall detain you until this evening in the Palais de Justice. Should\r\nanyone else interrogate you, say to him what you have said to me, but\r\ndo not breathe a word of this letter.”\r\n\r\n“I promise.” It was Villefort who seemed to entreat, and the prisoner\r\nwho reassured him.\r\n\r\n“You see,” continued he, glancing toward the grate, where fragments of\r\nburnt paper fluttered in the flames, “the letter is destroyed; you and\r\nI alone know of its existence; should you, therefore, be questioned,\r\ndeny all knowledge of it—deny it boldly, and you are saved.”\r\n\r\n“Be satisfied; I will deny it.”\r\n\r\n“It was the only letter you had?”\r\n\r\n“It was.”\r\n\r\n“Swear it.”\r\n\r\n“I swear it.”\r\n\r\nVillefort rang. A police agent entered. Villefort whispered some words\r\nin his ear, to which the officer replied by a motion of his head.\r\n\r\n“Follow him,” said Villefort to Dantès. Dantès saluted Villefort and\r\nretired. Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw himself\r\nhalf-fainting into a chair.\r\n\r\n“Alas, alas,” murmured he, “if the procureur himself had been at\r\nMarseilles I should have been ruined. This accursed letter would have\r\ndestroyed all my hopes. Oh, my father, must your past career always\r\ninterfere with my successes?” Suddenly a light passed over his face, a\r\nsmile played round his set mouth, and his haggard eyes were fixed in\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n“This will do,” said he, “and from this letter, which might have ruined\r\nme, I will make my fortune. Now to the work I have in hand.” And after\r\nhaving assured himself that the prisoner was gone, the deputy procureur\r\nhastened to the house of his betrothed.\r\n\r\n0107m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 8. The Château d’If\r\n\r\nThe commissary of police, as he traversed the antechamber, made a sign\r\nto two gendarmes, who placed themselves one on Dantès’ right and the\r\nother on his left. A door that communicated with the Palais de Justice\r\nwas opened, and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors,\r\nwhose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder. The Palais\r\nde Justice communicated with the prison,—a sombre edifice, that from\r\nits grated windows looks on the clock-tower of the Accoules. After\r\nnumberless windings, Dantès saw a door with an iron wicket. The\r\ncommissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice, every blow\r\nseeming to Dantès as if struck on his heart. The door opened, the two\r\ngendarmes gently pushed him forward, and the door closed with a loud\r\nsound behind him. The air he inhaled was no longer pure, but thick and\r\nmephitic,—he was in prison.\r\n\r\nHe was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber, but grated and barred,\r\nand its appearance, therefore, did not greatly alarm him; besides, the\r\nwords of Villefort, who seemed to interest himself so much, resounded\r\nstill in his ears like a promise of freedom. It was four o’clock when\r\nDantès was placed in this chamber. It was, as we have said, the 1st of\r\nMarch, and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness. The obscurity\r\naugmented the acuteness of his hearing; at the slightest sound he rose\r\nand hastened to the door, convinced they were about to liberate him,\r\nbut the sound died away, and Dantès sank again into his seat. At last,\r\nabout ten o’clock, and just as Dantès began to despair, steps were\r\nheard in the corridor, a key turned in the lock, the bolts creaked, the\r\nmassy oaken door flew open, and a flood of light from two torches\r\npervaded the apartment.\r\n\r\nBy the torchlight Dantès saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four\r\ngendarmes. He had advanced at first, but stopped at the sight of this\r\ndisplay of force.\r\n\r\n“Are you come to fetch me?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied a gendarme.\r\n\r\n“By the orders of the deputy procureur?”\r\n\r\n“I believe so.” The conviction that they came from M. de Villefort\r\nrelieved all Dantès’ apprehensions; he advanced calmly, and placed\r\nhimself in the centre of the escort. A carriage waited at the door, the\r\ncoachman was on the box, and a police officer sat beside him.\r\n\r\n“Is this carriage for me?” said Dantès.\r\n\r\n“It is for you,” replied a gendarme.\r\n\r\nDantès was about to speak; but feeling himself urged forward, and\r\nhaving neither the power nor the intention to resist, he mounted the\r\nsteps, and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes; the\r\ntwo others took their places opposite, and the carriage rolled heavily\r\nover the stones.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner glanced at the windows—they were grated; he had changed\r\nhis prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither.\r\nThrough the grating, however, Dantès saw they were passing through the\r\nRue Caisserie, and by the Rue Saint-Laurent and the Rue Taramis, to the\r\nquay. Soon he saw the lights of La Consigne.\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped, the officer descended, approached the guardhouse,\r\na dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order; Dantès saw\r\nthe reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay.\r\n\r\n“Can all this force be summoned on my account?” thought he.\r\n\r\nThe officer opened the door, which was locked, and, without speaking a\r\nword, answered Dantès’ question; for he saw between the ranks of the\r\nsoldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port. The two\r\ngendarmes who were opposite to him descended first, then he was ordered\r\nto alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example.\r\nThey advanced towards a boat, which a custom-house officer held by a\r\nchain, near the quay.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers looked at Dantès with an air of stupid curiosity. In an\r\ninstant he was placed in the stern-sheets of the boat, between the\r\ngendarmes, while the officer stationed himself at the bow; a shove sent\r\nthe boat adrift, and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards\r\nthe Pilon. At a shout from the boat, the chain that closes the mouth of\r\nthe port was lowered and in a second they were, as Dantès knew, in the\r\nFrioul and outside the inner harbor.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner’s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure\r\nair—for air is freedom; but he soon sighed, for he passed before La\r\nRéserve, where he had that morning been so happy, and now through the\r\nopen windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball. Dantès folded his\r\nhands, raised his eyes to heaven, and prayed fervently.\r\n\r\n0111m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boat continued her voyage. They had passed the Tête de Mort, were\r\nnow off the Anse du Pharo, and about to double the battery. This\r\nmanœuvre was incomprehensible to Dantès.\r\n\r\n“Whither are you taking me?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“You will soon know.”\r\n\r\n“But still——”\r\n\r\n“We are forbidden to give you any explanation.” Dantès, trained in\r\ndiscipline, knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question\r\nsubordinates, who were forbidden to reply; and so he remained silent.\r\n\r\nThe most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind. The boat they\r\nwere in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor\r\noutside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him\r\non some distant point. He was not bound, nor had they made any attempt\r\nto handcuff him; this seemed a good augury. Besides, had not the\r\ndeputy, who had been so kind to him, told him that provided he did not\r\npronounce the dreaded name of Noirtier, he had nothing to apprehend?\r\nHad not Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only\r\nproof against him?\r\n\r\nHe waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness.\r\n\r\nThey had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the lighthouse stood, on the\r\nright, and were now opposite the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the\r\nprisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for it\r\nwas there Mercédès dwelt. How was it that a presentiment did not warn\r\nMercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her?\r\n\r\nOne light alone was visible; and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès’\r\nchamber. Mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement. A\r\nloud cry could be heard by her. But pride restrained him and he did not\r\nutter it. What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a\r\nmadman?\r\n\r\nHe remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the boat went on,\r\nbut the prisoner thought only of Mercédès. An intervening elevation of\r\nland hid the light. Dantès turned and perceived that they had got out\r\nto sea. While he had been absorbed in thought, they had shipped their\r\noars and hoisted sail; the boat was now moving with the wind.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his repugnance to address the guards, Dantès turned to the\r\nnearest gendarme, and taking his hand,\r\n\r\n“Comrade,” said he, “I adjure you, as a Christian and a soldier, to\r\ntell me where we are going. I am Captain Dantès, a loyal Frenchman,\r\nthought accused of treason; tell me where you are conducting me, and I\r\npromise you on my honor I will submit to my fate.”\r\n\r\nThe gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion, who returned for\r\nanswer a sign that said, “I see no great harm in telling him now,” and\r\nthe gendarme replied:\r\n\r\n“You are a native of Marseilles, and a sailor, and yet you do not know\r\nwhere you are going?”\r\n\r\n“On my honor, I have no idea.”\r\n\r\n“Have you no idea whatever?”\r\n\r\n“None at all.”\r\n\r\n“That is impossible.”\r\n\r\n“I swear to you it is true. Tell me, I entreat.”\r\n\r\n“But my orders.”\r\n\r\n“Your orders do not forbid your telling me what I must know in ten\r\nminutes, in half an hour, or an hour. You see I cannot escape, even if\r\nI intended.”\r\n\r\n“Unless you are blind, or have never been outside the harbor, you must\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“I do not.”\r\n\r\n“Look round you then.” Dantès rose and looked forward, when he saw rise\r\nwithin a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which\r\nstands the Château d’If. This gloomy fortress, which has for more than\r\nthree hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends, seemed to\r\nDantès like a scaffold to a malefactor.\r\n\r\n“The Château d’If?” cried he, “what are we going there for?”\r\n\r\nThe gendarme smiled.\r\n\r\n“I am not going there to be imprisoned,” said Dantès; “it is only used\r\nfor political prisoners. I have committed no crime. Are there any\r\nmagistrates or judges at the Château d’If?”\r\n\r\n“There are only,” said the gendarme, “a governor, a garrison, turnkeys,\r\nand good thick walls. Come, come, do not look so astonished, or you\r\nwill make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good\r\nnature.”\r\n\r\nDantès pressed the gendarme’s hand as though he would crush it.\r\n\r\n“You think, then,” said he, “that I am taken to the Château d’If to be\r\nimprisoned there?”\r\n\r\n“It is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.”\r\n\r\n“Without any inquiry, without any formality?”\r\n\r\n“All the formalities have been gone through; the inquiry is already\r\nmade.”\r\n\r\n“And so, in spite of M. de Villefort’s promises?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know what M. de Villefort promised you,” said the gendarme,\r\n“but I know we are taking you to the Château d’If. But what are you\r\ndoing? Help, comrades, help!”\r\n\r\nBy a rapid movement, which the gendarme’s practiced eye had perceived,\r\nDantès sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea; but four\r\nvigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat. He\r\nfell back cursing with rage.\r\n\r\n“Good!” said the gendarme, placing his knee on his chest; “this is the\r\nway you keep your word as a sailor! Believe soft-spoken gentlemen\r\nagain! Hark ye, my friend, I have disobeyed my first order, but I will\r\nnot disobey the second; and if you move, I will blow your brains out.”\r\nAnd he levelled his carbine at Dantès, who felt the muzzle against his\r\ntemple.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind, and of so ending\r\nthe unexpected evil that had overtaken him. But he bethought him of M.\r\nde Villefort’s promise; and, besides, death in a boat from the hand of\r\na gendarme seemed too terrible. He remained motionless, but gnashing\r\nhis teeth and wringing his hands with fury.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock. One of\r\nthe sailors leaped on shore, a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley,\r\nand Dantès guessed they were at the end of the voyage, and that they\r\nwere mooring the boat.\r\n\r\nHis guards, taking him by the arms and coat-collar, forced him to rise,\r\nand dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the\r\nfortress, while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet\r\nfollowed behind.\r\n\r\nDantès made no resistance; he was like a man in a dream; he saw\r\nsoldiers drawn up on the embankment; he knew vaguely that he was\r\nascending a flight of steps; he was conscious that he passed through a\r\ndoor, and that the door closed behind him; but all this indistinctly as\r\nthrough a mist. He did not even see the ocean, that terrible barrier\r\nagainst freedom, which the prisoners look upon with utter despair.\r\n\r\nThey halted for a minute, during which he strove to collect his\r\nthoughts. He looked around; he was in a court surrounded by high walls;\r\nhe heard the measured tread of sentinels, and as they passed before the\r\nlight he saw the barrels of their muskets shine.\r\n\r\nThey waited upwards of ten minutes. Certain Dantès could not escape,\r\nthe gendarmes released him. They seemed awaiting orders. The orders\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n“Where is the prisoner?” said a voice.\r\n\r\n“Here,” replied the gendarmes.\r\n\r\n“Let him follow me; I will take him to his cell.”\r\n\r\n“Go!” said the gendarmes, thrusting Dantès forward.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner followed his guide, who led him into a room almost under\r\nground, whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with\r\ntears; a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly, and\r\nshowed Dantès the features of his conductor, an under-jailer,\r\nill-clothed, and of sullen appearance.\r\n\r\n0113m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Here is your chamber for tonight,” said he. “It is late, and the\r\ngovernor is asleep. Tomorrow, perhaps, he may change you. In the\r\nmeantime there is bread, water, and fresh straw; and that is all a\r\nprisoner can wish for. Goodnight.” And before Dantès could open his\r\nmouth—before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the\r\nwater—before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was, the\r\njailer disappeared, taking with him the lamp and closing the door,\r\nleaving stamped upon the prisoner’s mind the dim reflection of the\r\ndripping walls of his dungeon.\r\n\r\nDantès was alone in darkness and in silence—cold as the shadows that he\r\nfelt breathe on his burning forehead. With the first dawn of day the\r\njailer returned, with orders to leave Dantès where he was. He found the\r\nprisoner in the same position, as if fixed there, his eyes swollen with\r\nweeping. He had passed the night standing, and without sleep. The\r\njailer advanced; Dantès appeared not to perceive him. He touched him on\r\nthe shoulder. Edmond started.\r\n\r\n“Have you not slept?” said the jailer.\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” replied Dantès. The jailer stared.\r\n\r\n“Are you hungry?” continued he.\r\n\r\n“I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“Do you wish for anything?”\r\n\r\n“I wish to see the governor.”\r\n\r\nThe jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber.\r\n\r\nDantès followed him with his eyes, and stretched forth his hands\r\ntowards the open door; but the door closed. All his emotion then burst\r\nforth; he cast himself on the ground, weeping bitterly, and asking\r\nhimself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished.\r\n\r\nThe day passed thus; he scarcely tasted food, but walked round and\r\nround the cell like a wild beast in its cage. One thought in particular\r\ntormented him: namely, that during his journey hither he had sat so\r\nstill, whereas he might, a dozen times, have plunged into the sea, and,\r\nthanks to his powers of swimming, for which he was famous, have gained\r\nthe shore, concealed himself until the arrival of a Genoese or Spanish\r\nvessel, escaped to Spain or Italy, where Mercédès and his father could\r\nhave joined him. He had no fears as to how he should live—good seamen\r\nare welcome everywhere. He spoke Italian like a Tuscan, and Spanish\r\nlike a Castilian; he would have been free, and happy with Mercédès and\r\nhis father, whereas he was now confined in the Château d’If, that\r\nimpregnable fortress, ignorant of the future destiny of his father and\r\nMercédès; and all this because he had trusted to Villefort’s promise.\r\nThe thought was maddening, and Dantès threw himself furiously down on\r\nhis straw. The next morning at the same hour, the jailer came again.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the jailer, “are you more reasonable today?” Dantès made\r\nno reply.\r\n\r\n“Come, cheer up; is there anything that I can do for you?”\r\n\r\n“I wish to see the governor.”\r\n\r\n“I have already told you it was impossible.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?”\r\n\r\n“Because it is against prison rules, and prisoners must not even ask\r\nfor it.”\r\n\r\n“What is allowed, then?”\r\n\r\n“Better fare, if you pay for it, books, and leave to walk about.”\r\n\r\n“I do not want books, I am satisfied with my food, and do not care to\r\nwalk about; but I wish to see the governor.”\r\n\r\n“If you worry me by repeating the same thing, I will not bring you any\r\nmore to eat.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Edmond, “if you do not, I shall die of hunger—that\r\nis all.”\r\n\r\nThe jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die; and as every\r\nprisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer, he replied in a more\r\nsubdued tone.\r\n\r\n“What you ask is impossible; but if you are very well behaved you will\r\nbe allowed to walk about, and some day you will meet the governor, and\r\nif he chooses to reply, that is his affair.”\r\n\r\n“But,” asked Dantès, “how long shall I have to wait?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, a month—six months—a year.”\r\n\r\n“It is too long a time. I wish to see him at once.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the jailer, “do not always brood over what is impossible, or\r\nyou will be mad in a fortnight.”\r\n\r\n“You think so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; we have an instance here; it was by always offering a million of\r\nfrancs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad, who was\r\nin this chamber before you.”\r\n\r\n0119m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“How long has he left it?”\r\n\r\n“Two years.”\r\n\r\n“Was he liberated, then?”\r\n\r\n“No; he was put in a dungeon.”\r\n\r\n“Listen!” said Dantès. “I am not an abbé, I am not mad; perhaps I shall\r\nbe, but at present, unfortunately, I am not. I will make you another\r\noffer.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“I do not offer you a million, because I have it not; but I will give\r\nyou a hundred crowns if, the first time you go to Marseilles, you will\r\nseek out a young girl named Mercédès, at the Catalans, and give her two\r\nlines from me.”\r\n\r\n0120m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“If I took them, and were detected, I should lose my place, which is\r\nworth two thousand francs a year; so that I should be a great fool to\r\nrun such a risk for three hundred.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Dantès, “mark this; if you refuse at least to tell\r\nMercédès I am here, I will some day hide myself behind the door, and\r\nwhen you enter I will dash out your brains with this stool.”\r\n\r\n“Threats!” cried the jailer, retreating and putting himself on the\r\ndefensive; “you are certainly going mad. The abbé began like you, and\r\nin three days you will be like him, mad enough to tie up; but,\r\nfortunately, there are dungeons here.”\r\n\r\nDantès whirled the stool round his head.\r\n\r\n“All right, all right,” said the jailer; “all right, since you will\r\nhave it so. I will send word to the governor.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” returned Dantès, dropping the stool and sitting on it as\r\nif he were in reality mad. The jailer went out, and returned in an\r\ninstant with a corporal and four soldiers.\r\n\r\n“By the governor’s orders,” said he, “conduct the prisoner to the tier\r\nbeneath.”\r\n\r\n“To the dungeon, then,” said the corporal.\r\n\r\n“Yes; we must put the madman with the madmen.” The soldiers seized\r\nDantès, who followed passively.\r\n\r\nHe descended fifteen steps, and the door of a dungeon was opened, and\r\nhe was thrust in. The door closed, and Dantès advanced with\r\noutstretched hands until he touched the wall; he then sat down in the\r\ncorner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness. The jailer was\r\nright; Dantès wanted but little of being utterly mad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 9. The Evening of the Betrothal\r\n\r\nVillefort had, as we have said, hastened back to Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran’s in the Place du Grand Cours, and on entering the house\r\nfound that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in\r\nthe salon. Renée was, with all the rest of the company, anxiously\r\nawaiting him, and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation.\r\n\r\n“Well, Decapitator, Guardian of the State, Royalist, Brutus, what is\r\nthe matter?” said one. “Speak out.”\r\n\r\n“Are we threatened with a fresh Reign of Terror?” asked another.\r\n\r\n“Has the Corsican ogre broken loose?” cried a third.\r\n\r\n“Marquise,” said Villefort, approaching his future mother-in-law, “I\r\nrequest your pardon for thus leaving you. Will the marquis honor me by\r\na few moments’ private conversation?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, it is really a serious matter, then?” asked the marquis, remarking\r\nthe cloud on Villefort’s brow.\r\n\r\n“So serious that I must take leave of you for a few days; so,” added\r\nhe, turning to Renée, “judge for yourself if it be not important.”\r\n\r\n“You are going to leave us?” cried Renée, unable to hide her emotion at\r\nthis unexpected announcement.\r\n\r\n“Alas,” returned Villefort, “I must!”\r\n\r\n“Where, then, are you going?” asked the marquise.\r\n\r\n“That, madame, is an official secret; but if you have any commissions\r\nfor Paris, a friend of mine is going there tonight, and will with\r\npleasure undertake them.” The guests looked at each other.\r\n\r\n“You wish to speak to me alone?” said the marquis.\r\n\r\n“Yes, let us go to the library, please.” The marquis took his arm, and\r\nthey left the salon.\r\n\r\n“Well,” asked he, as soon as they were by themselves, “tell me what it\r\nis?”\r\n\r\n“An affair of the greatest importance, that demands my immediate\r\npresence in Paris. Now, excuse the indiscretion, marquis, but have you\r\nany landed property?”\r\n\r\n“All my fortune is in the funds; seven or eight hundred thousand\r\nfrancs.”\r\n\r\n“Then sell out—sell out, marquis, or you will lose it all.”\r\n\r\n0123m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“But how can I sell out here?”\r\n\r\n“You have a broker, have you not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then give me a letter to him, and tell him to sell out without an\r\ninstant’s delay, perhaps even now I shall arrive too late.”\r\n\r\n“The deuce you say!” replied the marquis, “let us lose no time, then!”\r\n\r\nAnd, sitting down, he wrote a letter to his broker, ordering him to\r\nsell out at the market price.\r\n\r\n“Now, then,” said Villefort, placing the letter in his pocketbook, “I\r\nmust have another!”\r\n\r\n“To whom?”\r\n\r\n“To the king.”\r\n\r\n“To the king?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I dare not write to his majesty.”\r\n\r\n“I do not ask you to write to his majesty, but ask M. de Salvieux to do\r\nso. I want a letter that will enable me to reach the king’s presence\r\nwithout all the formalities of demanding an audience; that would\r\noccasion a loss of precious time.”\r\n\r\n“But address yourself to the keeper of the seals; he has the right of\r\nentry at the Tuileries, and can procure you audience at any hour of the\r\nday or night.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless; but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my\r\ndiscovery with him. The keeper would leave me in the background, and\r\ntake all the glory to himself. I tell you, marquis, my fortune is made\r\nif I only reach the Tuileries the first, for the king will not forget\r\nthe service I do him.”\r\n\r\n“In that case go and get ready. I will call Salvieux and make him write\r\nthe letter.”\r\n\r\n“Be as quick as possible, I must be on the road in a quarter of an\r\nhour.”\r\n\r\n“Tell your coachman to stop at the door.”\r\n\r\n“You will present my excuses to the marquise and Mademoiselle Renée,\r\nwhom I leave on such a day with great regret.”\r\n\r\n“You will find them both here, and can make your farewells in person.”\r\n\r\n“A thousand thanks—and now for the letter.”\r\n\r\nThe marquis rang, a servant entered.\r\n\r\n“Say to the Comte de Salvieux that I would like to see him.”\r\n\r\n“Now, then, go,” said the marquis.\r\n\r\n“I shall be gone only a few moments.”\r\n\r\nVillefort hastily quitted the apartment, but reflecting that the sight\r\nof the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to\r\nthrow the whole city into confusion, he resumed his ordinary pace. At\r\nhis door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for\r\nhim. It was Mercédès, who, hearing no news of her lover, had come\r\nunobserved to inquire after him.\r\n\r\nAs Villefort drew near, she advanced and stood before him. Dantès had\r\nspoken of Mercédès, and Villefort instantly recognized her. Her beauty\r\nand high bearing surprised him, and when she inquired what had become\r\nof her lover, it seemed to him that she was the judge, and he the\r\naccused.\r\n\r\n“The young man you speak of,” said Villefort abruptly, “is a great\r\ncriminal, and I can do nothing for him, mademoiselle.” Mercédès burst\r\ninto tears, and, as Villefort strove to pass her, again addressed him.\r\n\r\n“But, at least, tell me where he is, that I may know whether he is\r\nalive or dead,” said she.\r\n\r\n0125m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I do not know; he is no longer in my hands,” replied Villefort.\r\n\r\nAnd desirous of putting an end to the interview, he pushed by her, and\r\nclosed the door, as if to exclude the pain he felt. But remorse is not\r\nthus banished; like Virgil’s wounded hero, he carried the arrow in his\r\nwound, and, arrived at the salon, Villefort uttered a sigh that was\r\nalmost a sob, and sank into a chair.\r\n\r\nThen the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart. The\r\nman he sacrificed to his ambition, that innocent victim immolated on\r\nthe altar of his father’s faults, appeared to him pale and threatening,\r\nleading his affianced bride by the hand, and bringing with him remorse,\r\nnot such as the ancients figured, furious and terrible, but that slow\r\nand consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to\r\nthe very moment of death. Then he had a moment’s hesitation. He had\r\nfrequently called for capital punishment on criminals, and owing to his\r\nirresistible eloquence they had been condemned, and yet the slightest\r\nshadow of remorse had never clouded Villefort’s brow, because they were\r\nguilty; at least, he believed so; but here was an innocent man whose\r\nhappiness he had destroyed. In this case he was not the judge, but the\r\nexecutioner.\r\n\r\nAs he thus reflected, he felt the sensation we have described, and\r\nwhich had hitherto been unknown to him, arise in his bosom, and fill\r\nhim with vague apprehensions. It is thus that a wounded man trembles\r\ninstinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be\r\nhealed, but Villefort’s was one of those that never close, or if they\r\ndo, only close to reopen more agonizing than ever. If at this moment\r\nthe sweet voice of Renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy, or\r\nthe fair Mercédès had entered and said, “In the name of God, I conjure\r\nyou to restore me my affianced husband,” his cold and trembling hands\r\nwould have signed his release; but no voice broke the stillness of the\r\nchamber, and the door was opened only by Villefort’s valet, who came to\r\ntell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness.\r\n\r\nVillefort rose, or rather sprang, from his chair, hastily opened one of\r\nthe drawers of his desk, emptied all the gold it contained into his\r\npocket, stood motionless an instant, his hand pressed to his head,\r\nmuttered a few inarticulate sounds, and then, perceiving that his\r\nservant had placed his cloak on his shoulders, he sprang into the\r\ncarriage, ordering the postilions to drive to M. de Saint-Méran’s. The\r\nhapless Dantès was doomed.\r\n\r\nAs the marquis had promised, Villefort found the marquise and Renée in\r\nwaiting. He started when he saw Renée, for he fancied she was again\r\nabout to plead for Dantès. Alas, her emotions were wholly personal: she\r\nwas thinking only of Villefort’s departure.\r\n\r\nShe loved Villefort, and he left her at the moment he was about to\r\nbecome her husband. Villefort knew not when he should return, and\r\nRenée, far from pleading for Dantès, hated the man whose crime\r\nseparated her from her lover.\r\n\r\n0127m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile what of Mercédès? She had met Fernand at the corner of the\r\nRue de la Loge; she had returned to the Catalans, and had despairingly\r\ncast herself on her couch. Fernand, kneeling by her side, took her\r\nhand, and covered it with kisses that Mercédès did not even feel. She\r\npassed the night thus. The lamp went out for want of oil, but she paid\r\nno heed to the darkness, and dawn came, but she knew not that it was\r\nday. Grief had made her blind to all but one object—that was Edmond.\r\n\r\n“Ah, you are there,” said she, at length, turning towards Fernand.\r\n\r\n“I have not quitted you since yesterday,” returned Fernand sorrowfully.\r\n\r\nM. Morrel had not readily given up the fight. He had learned that\r\nDantès had been taken to prison, and he had gone to all his friends,\r\nand the influential persons of the city; but the report was already in\r\ncirculation that Dantès was arrested as a Bonapartist agent; and as the\r\nmost sanguine looked upon any attempt of Napoleon to remount the throne\r\nas impossible, he met with nothing but refusal, and had returned home\r\nin despair, declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more\r\ncould be done.\r\n\r\nCaderousse was equally restless and uneasy, but instead of seeking,\r\nlike M. Morrel, to aid Dantès, he had shut himself up with two bottles\r\nof black currant brandy, in the hope of drowning reflection. But he did\r\nnot succeed, and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink, and\r\nyet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened. With his elbows\r\non the table he sat between the two empty bottles, while spectres\r\ndanced in the light of the unsnuffed candle—spectres such as Hoffmann\r\nstrews over his punch-drenched pages, like black, fantastic dust.\r\n\r\nDanglars alone was content and joyous—he had got rid of an enemy and\r\nmade his own situation on the _Pharaon_ secure. Danglars was one of\r\nthose men born with a pen behind the ear, and an inkstand in place of a\r\nheart. Everything with him was multiplication or subtraction. The life\r\nof a man was to him of far less value than a numeral, especially when,\r\nby taking it away, he could increase the sum total of his own desires.\r\nHe went to bed at his usual hour, and slept in peace.\r\n\r\nVillefort, after having received M. de Salvieux’s letter, embraced\r\nRenée, kissed the marquise’s hand, and shaken that of the marquis,\r\nstarted for Paris along the Aix road.\r\n\r\nOld Dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond.\r\nBut we know very well what had become of Edmond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 10. The King’s Closet at the Tuileries\r\n\r\nWe will leave Villefort on the road to Paris, travelling—thanks to\r\ntrebled fees—with all speed, and passing through two or three\r\napartments, enter at the Tuileries the little room with the arched\r\nwindow, so well known as having been the favorite closet of Napoleon\r\nand Louis XVIII., and now of Louis Philippe.\r\n\r\nThere, seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from\r\nHartwell, and to which, from one of those fancies not uncommon to great\r\npeople, he was particularly attached, the king, Louis XVIII., was\r\ncarelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty-two years of age, with\r\ngray hair, aristocratic bearing, and exceedingly gentlemanly attire,\r\nand meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of Gryphius’s rather\r\ninaccurate, but much sought-after, edition of Horace—a work which was\r\nmuch indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical\r\nmonarch.\r\n\r\n“You say, sir——” said the king.\r\n\r\n“That I am exceedingly disquieted, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Really, have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean\r\nkine?”\r\n\r\n“No, sire, for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and\r\nseven years of scarcity; and with a king as full of foresight as your\r\nmajesty, scarcity is not a thing to be feared.”\r\n\r\n“Then of what other scourge are you afraid, my dear Blacas?”\r\n\r\n“Sire, I have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the\r\nsouth.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear duke,” replied Louis XVIII., “I think you are wrongly\r\ninformed, and know positively that, on the contrary, it is very fine\r\nweather in that direction.” Man of ability as he was, Louis XVIII.\r\nliked a pleasant jest.\r\n\r\n“Sire,” continued M. de Blacas, “if it only be to reassure a faithful\r\nservant, will your majesty send into Languedoc, Provence, and Dauphiné,\r\ntrusty men, who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling\r\nin these three provinces?”\r\n\r\n“_Canimus surdis_,” replied the king, continuing the annotations in his\r\nHorace.\r\n\r\n“Sire,” replied the courtier, laughing, in order that he might seem to\r\ncomprehend the quotation, “your majesty may be perfectly right in\r\nrelying on the good feeling of France, but I fear I am not altogether\r\nwrong in dreading some desperate attempt.”\r\n\r\n“By whom?”\r\n\r\n“By Bonaparte, or, at least, by his adherents.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Blacas,” said the king, “you with your alarms prevent me from\r\nworking.”\r\n\r\n“And you, sire, prevent me from sleeping with your security.”\r\n\r\n“Wait, my dear sir, wait a moment; for I have such a delightful note on\r\nthe _Pastor quum traheret_—wait, and I will listen to you afterwards.”\r\n\r\nThere was a brief pause, during which Louis XVIII. wrote, in a hand as\r\nsmall as possible, another note on the margin of his Horace, and then\r\nlooking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of\r\nhis own, while he is only commenting upon the idea of another, said:\r\n\r\n“Go on, my dear duke, go on—I listen.”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” said Blacas, who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing\r\nVillefort to his own profit, “I am compelled to tell you that these are\r\nnot mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me; but a\r\nserious-minded man, deserving all my confidence, and charged by me to\r\nwatch over the south” (the duke hesitated as he pronounced these\r\nwords), “has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens\r\nthe king, and so I hastened to you, sire.”\r\n\r\n“_Mala ducis avi domum_,” continued Louis XVIII., still annotating.\r\n\r\n“Does your majesty wish me to drop the subject?”\r\n\r\n“By no means, my dear duke; but just stretch out your hand.”\r\n\r\n“Which?”\r\n\r\n“Whichever you please—there to the left.”\r\n\r\n“Here, sire?”\r\n\r\n“I tell you to the left, and you are looking to the right; I mean on my\r\nleft—yes, there. You will find yesterday’s report of the minister of\r\npolice. But here is M. Dandré himself;” and M. Dandré, announced by the\r\nchamberlain-in-waiting, entered.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” said Louis XVIII., with repressed smile, “come in, Baron,\r\nand tell the duke all you know—the latest news of M. de Bonaparte; do\r\nnot conceal anything, however serious,—let us see, the Island of Elba\r\nis a volcano, and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and\r\nbristling war—_bella, horrida bella_.”\r\n\r\nM. Dandré leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two\r\nhands, and said:\r\n\r\n“Has your majesty perused yesterday’s report?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; but tell the duke himself, who cannot find anything, what\r\nthe report contains—give him the particulars of what the usurper is\r\ndoing in his islet.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the baron to the duke, “all the servants of his\r\nmajesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the\r\nIsland of Elba. Bonaparte——”\r\n\r\nM. Dandré looked at Louis XVIII., who, employed in writing a note, did\r\nnot even raise his head. “Bonaparte,” continued the baron, “is mortally\r\nwearied, and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at\r\nPorto-Longone.”\r\n\r\n“And scratches himself for amusement,” added the king.\r\n\r\n“Scratches himself?” inquired the duke, “what does your majesty mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, my dear duke. Did you forget that this great man, this\r\nhero, this demigod, is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries\r\nhim to death, _prurigo_?”\r\n\r\n“And, moreover, my dear duke,” continued the minister of police, “we\r\nare almost assured that, in a very short time, the usurper will be\r\ninsane.”\r\n\r\n“Insane?”\r\n\r\n“Raving mad; his head becomes weaker. Sometimes he weeps bitterly,\r\nsometimes laughs boisterously, at other time he passes hours on the\r\nseashore, flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes\r\n‘duck-and-drake’ five or six times, he appears as delighted as if he\r\nhad gained another Marengo or Austerlitz. Now, you must agree that\r\nthese are indubitable symptoms of insanity.”\r\n\r\n“Or of wisdom, my dear baron—or of wisdom,” said Louis XVIII.,\r\nlaughing; “the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by\r\ncasting pebbles into the ocean—see Plutarch’s life of Scipio\r\nAfricanus.”\r\n\r\nM. de Blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the\r\ntruthful minister. Villefort, who did not choose to reveal the whole\r\nsecret, lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure, had\r\nyet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, Dandré,” said Louis XVIII., “Blacas is not yet convinced;\r\nlet us proceed, therefore, to the usurper’s conversion.” The minister\r\nof police bowed.\r\n\r\n“The usurper’s conversion!” murmured the duke, looking at the king and\r\nDandré, who spoke alternately, like Virgil’s shepherds. “The usurper\r\nconverted!”\r\n\r\n“Decidedly, my dear duke.”\r\n\r\n“In what way converted?”\r\n\r\n“To good principles. Tell him all about it, baron.”\r\n\r\n“Why, this is the way of it,” said the minister, with the gravest air\r\nin the world: “Napoleon lately had a review, and as two or three of his\r\nold veterans expressed a desire to return to France, he gave them their\r\ndismissal, and exhorted them to ‘serve the good king.’ These were his\r\nown words, of that I am certain.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Blacas, what think you of this?” inquired the king triumphantly,\r\nand pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him.\r\n\r\n“I say, sire, that the minister of police is greatly deceived or I am;\r\nand as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the\r\nguardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty, it is probable\r\nthat I am in error. However, sire, if I might advise, your majesty will\r\ninterrogate the person of whom I spoke to you, and I will urge your\r\nmajesty to do him this honor.”\r\n\r\n“Most willingly, duke; under your auspices I will receive any person\r\nyou please, but you must not expect me to be too confiding. Baron, have\r\nyou any report more recent than this, dated the 20th February, and this\r\nis the 3rd of March?”\r\n\r\n“No, sire, but I am hourly expecting one; it may have arrived since I\r\nleft my office.”\r\n\r\n“Go thither, and if there be none—well, well,” continued Louis XVIII.,\r\n“make one; that is the usual way, is it not?” and the king laughed\r\nfacetiously.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sire,” replied the minister, “we have no occasion to invent any;\r\nevery day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations,\r\ncoming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which\r\nthey seek to render, but cannot; they trust to fortune, and rely upon\r\nsome unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, go,” said Louis XVIII., “and remember that I am waiting for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I will but go and return, sire; I shall be back in ten minutes.”\r\n\r\n“And I, sire,” said M. de Blacas, “will go and find my messenger.”\r\n\r\n“Wait, sir, wait,” said Louis XVIII. “Really, M. de Blacas, I must\r\nchange your armorial bearings; I will give you an eagle with\r\noutstretched wings, holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to\r\nescape, and bearing this device—_Tenax_.”\r\n\r\n0133m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sire, I listen,” said De Blacas, biting his nails with impatience.\r\n\r\n“I wish to consult you on this passage, ‘_Molli fugiens anhelitu_,’ you\r\nknow it refers to a stag flying from a wolf. Are you not a sportsman\r\nand a great wolf-hunter? Well, then, what do you think of the _molli\r\nanhelitu_?”\r\n\r\n“Admirable, sire; but my messenger is like the stag you refer to, for\r\nhe has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days.”\r\n\r\n“Which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety, my dear duke, when we\r\nhave a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours, and\r\nthat without getting in the least out of breath.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, sire, you recompense but badly this poor young man, who has come\r\nso far, and with so much ardor, to give your majesty useful\r\ninformation. If only for the sake of M. de Salvieux, who recommends him\r\nto me, I entreat your majesty to receive him graciously.”\r\n\r\n“M. de Salvieux, my brother’s chamberlain?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sire.”\r\n\r\n“He is at Marseilles.”\r\n\r\n“And writes me thence.”\r\n\r\n“Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?”\r\n\r\n“No; but strongly recommends M. de Villefort, and begs me to present\r\nhim to your majesty.”\r\n\r\n“M. de Villefort!” cried the king, “is the messenger’s name M. de\r\nVillefort?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sire.”\r\n\r\n“And he comes from Marseilles?”\r\n\r\n“In person.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you not mention his name at once?” replied the king, betraying\r\nsome uneasiness.\r\n\r\n“Sire, I thought his name was unknown to your majesty.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, Blacas; he is a man of strong and elevated understanding,\r\nambitious, too, and, _pardieu!_ you know his father’s name!”\r\n\r\n“His father?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Noirtier.”\r\n\r\n“Noirtier the Girondin?—Noirtier the senator?”\r\n\r\n“He himself.”\r\n\r\n“And your majesty has employed the son of such a man?”\r\n\r\n“Blacas, my friend, you have but limited comprehension. I told you\r\nVillefort was ambitious, and to attain this ambition Villefort would\r\nsacrifice everything, even his father.”\r\n\r\n“Then, sire, may I present him?”\r\n\r\n“This instant, duke! Where is he?”\r\n\r\n“Waiting below, in my carriage.”\r\n\r\n“Seek him at once.”\r\n\r\n“I hasten to do so.”\r\n\r\nThe duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man; his\r\nreally sincere royalism made him youthful again. Louis XVIII. remained\r\nalone, and turning his eyes on his half-opened Horace, muttered:\r\n\r\n“_Justum et tenacem propositi virum_.”\r\n\r\nM. de Blacas returned as speedily as he had departed, but in the\r\nantechamber he was forced to appeal to the king’s authority.\r\nVillefort’s dusty garb, his costume, which was not of courtly cut,\r\nexcited the susceptibility of M. de Brezé, who was all astonishment at\r\nfinding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king\r\nin such attire. The duke, however, overcame all difficulties with a\r\nword—his majesty’s order; and, in spite of the protestations which the\r\nmaster of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles,\r\nVillefort was introduced.\r\n\r\nThe king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him. On\r\nopening the door, Villefort found himself facing him, and the young\r\nmagistrate’s first impulse was to pause.\r\n\r\n“Come in, M. de Villefort,” said the king, “come in.”\r\n\r\nVillefort bowed, and advancing a few steps, waited until the king\r\nshould interrogate him.\r\n\r\n“M. de Villefort,” said Louis XVIII., “the Duc de Blacas assures me you\r\nhave some interesting information to communicate.”\r\n\r\n“Sire, the duke is right, and I believe your majesty will think it\r\nequally important.”\r\n\r\n0137m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as\r\nbad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?”\r\n\r\n“Sire, I believe it to be most urgent, but I hope, by the speed I have\r\nused, that it is not irreparable.”\r\n\r\n“Speak as fully as you please, sir,” said the king, who began to give\r\nway to the emotion which had showed itself in Blacas’s face and\r\naffected Villefort’s voice. “Speak, sir, and pray begin at the\r\nbeginning; I like order in everything.”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “I will render a faithful report to your\r\nmajesty, but I must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to\r\nsome obscurity in my language.” A glance at the king after this\r\ndiscreet and subtle exordium, assured Villefort of the benignity of his\r\naugust auditor, and he went on:\r\n\r\n“Sire, I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible, to inform your\r\nmajesty that I have discovered, in the exercise of my duties, not a\r\ncommonplace and insignificant plot, such as is every day got up in the\r\nlower ranks of the people and in the army, but an actual conspiracy—a\r\nstorm which menaces no less than your majesty’s throne. Sire, the\r\nusurper is arming three ships, he meditates some project, which,\r\nhowever mad, is yet, perhaps, terrible. At this moment he will have\r\nleft Elba, to go whither I know not, but assuredly to attempt a landing\r\neither at Naples, or on the coast of Tuscany, or perhaps on the shores\r\nof France. Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island\r\nof Elba has maintained his relations with Italy and France?”\r\n\r\n“I am, sir,” said the king, much agitated; “and recently we have had\r\ninformation that the Bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the Rue\r\nSaint-Jacques. But proceed, I beg of you. How did you obtain these\r\ndetails?”\r\n\r\n“Sire, they are the results of an examination which I have made of a\r\nman of Marseilles, whom I have watched for some time, and arrested on\r\nthe day of my departure. This person, a sailor, of turbulent character,\r\nand whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island of\r\nElba. There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral\r\nmessage to a Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from\r\nhim; but this mission was to prepare men’s minds for a return (it is\r\nthe man who says this, sire)—a return which will soon occur.”\r\n\r\n“And where is this man?”\r\n\r\n“In prison, sire.”\r\n\r\n“And the matter seems serious to you?”\r\n\r\n“So serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst\r\nof a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, I left my bride\r\nand friends, postponing everything, that I might hasten to lay at your\r\nmajesty’s feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance of my\r\ndevotion.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Louis XVIII., “was there not a marriage engagement between\r\nyou and Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran?”\r\n\r\n“Daughter of one of your majesty’s most faithful servants.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort.”\r\n\r\n“Sire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy.”\r\n\r\n“A conspiracy in these times,” said Louis XVIII., smiling, “is a thing\r\nvery easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end,\r\ninasmuch as, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors,\r\nwe have our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the\r\nfuture. For the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their\r\nvigilance, in order to watch the shore of the Mediterranean. If\r\nBonaparte landed at Naples, the whole coalition would be on foot before\r\nhe could even reach Piombino; if he land in Tuscany, he will be in an\r\nunfriendly territory; if he land in France, it must be with a handful\r\nof men, and the result of that is easily foretold, execrated as he is\r\nby the population. Take courage, sir; but at the same time rely on our\r\nroyal gratitude.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, here is M. Dandré!” cried de Blacas. At this instant the minister\r\nof police appeared at the door, pale, trembling, and as if ready to\r\nfaint. Villefort was about to retire, but M. de Blacas, taking his\r\nhand, restrained him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 11. The Corsican Ogre\r\n\r\nAt the sight of this agitation Louis XVIII. pushed from him violently\r\nthe table at which he was sitting.\r\n\r\n“What ails you, baron?” he exclaimed. “You appear quite aghast. Has\r\nyour uneasiness anything to do with what M. de Blacas has told me, and\r\nM. de Villefort has just confirmed?” M. de Blacas moved suddenly\r\ntowards the baron, but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the\r\nforbearance of the statesman; and besides, as matters were, it was much\r\nmore to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over\r\nhim than that he should humiliate the prefect.\r\n\r\n“Sire,——” stammered the baron.\r\n\r\n“Well, what is it?” asked Louis XVIII. The minister of police, giving\r\nway to an impulse of despair, was about to throw himself at the feet of\r\nLouis XVIII., who retreated a step and frowned.\r\n\r\n“Will you speak?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sire, what a dreadful misfortune! I am, indeed, to be pitied. I\r\ncan never forgive myself!”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said Louis XVIII., “I command you to speak.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sire, the usurper left Elba on the 26th February, and landed on\r\nthe 1st of March.”\r\n\r\n“And where? In Italy?” asked the king eagerly.\r\n\r\n“In France, sire,—at a small port, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan.”\r\n\r\n“The usurper landed in France, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan, two\r\nhundred and fifty leagues from Paris, on the 1st of March, and you only\r\nacquired this information today, the 3rd of March! Well, sir, what you\r\ntell me is impossible. You must have received a false report, or you\r\nhave gone mad.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, sire, it is but too true!” Louis made a gesture of indescribable\r\nanger and alarm, and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had\r\nstruck him at the same moment in heart and countenance.\r\n\r\n“In France!” he cried, “the usurper in France! Then they did not watch\r\nover this man. Who knows? they were, perhaps, in league with him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sire,” exclaimed the Duc de Blacas, “M. Dandré is not a man to be\r\naccused of treason! Sire, we have all been blind, and the minister of\r\npolice has shared the general blindness, that is all.”\r\n\r\n“But——” said Villefort, and then suddenly checking himself, he was\r\nsilent; then he continued, “Your pardon, sire,” he said, bowing, “my\r\nzeal carried me away. Will your majesty deign to excuse me?”\r\n\r\n“Speak, sir, speak boldly,” replied Louis. “You alone forewarned us of\r\nthe evil; now try and aid us with the remedy.”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “the usurper is detested in the south; and it\r\nseems to me that if he ventured into the south, it would be easy to\r\nraise Languedoc and Provence against him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, assuredly,” replied the minister; “but he is advancing by Gap and\r\nSisteron.”\r\n\r\n“Advancing—he is advancing!” said Louis XVIII. “Is he then advancing on\r\nParis?” The minister of police maintained a silence which was\r\nequivalent to a complete avowal.\r\n\r\n“And Dauphiné, sir?” inquired the king, of Villefort. “Do you think it\r\npossible to rouse that as well as Provence?”\r\n\r\n“Sire, I am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact; but the feeling in\r\nDauphiné is quite the reverse of that in Provence or Languedoc. The\r\nmountaineers are Bonapartists, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” murmured Louis, “he was well informed. And how many men had he\r\nwith him?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know, sire,” answered the minister of police.\r\n\r\n“What, you do not know! Have you neglected to obtain information on\r\nthat point? Of course it is of no consequence,” he added, with a\r\nwithering smile.\r\n\r\n“Sire, it was impossible to learn; the despatch simply stated the fact\r\nof the landing and the route taken by the usurper.”\r\n\r\n“And how did this despatch reach you?” inquired the king. The minister\r\nbowed his head, and while a deep color overspread his cheeks, he\r\nstammered out:\r\n\r\n“By the telegraph, sire.” Louis XVIII. advanced a step, and folded his\r\narms over his chest as Napoleon would have done.\r\n\r\n0141m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“So then,” he exclaimed, turning pale with anger, “seven conjoined and\r\nallied armies overthrew that man. A miracle of heaven replaced me on\r\nthe throne of my fathers after five-and-twenty years of exile. I have,\r\nduring those five-and-twenty years, spared no pains to understand the\r\npeople of France and the interests which were confided to me; and now,\r\nwhen I see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach, the power I\r\nhold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms!”\r\n\r\n“Sire, it is fatality!” murmured the minister, feeling that the\r\npressure of circumstances, however light a thing to destiny, was too\r\nmuch for any human strength to endure.\r\n\r\n“What our enemies say of us is then true. We have learnt nothing,\r\nforgotten nothing! If I were betrayed as he was, I would console\r\nmyself; but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places\r\nof honor, who ought to watch over me more carefully than over\r\nthemselves,—for my fortune is theirs—before me they were nothing—after\r\nme they will be nothing, and perish miserably from\r\nincapacity—ineptitude! Oh, yes, sir, you are right—it is fatality!”\r\n\r\nThe minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm. M. de Blacas\r\nwiped the moisture from his brow. Villefort smiled within himself, for\r\nhe felt his increased importance.\r\n\r\n“To fall,” continued King Louis, who at the first glance had sounded\r\nthe abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended,—“to fall, and learn of\r\nthat fall by telegraph! Oh, I would rather mount the scaffold of my\r\nbrother, Louis XVI., than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries\r\ndriven away by ridicule. Ridicule, sir—why, you know not its power in\r\nFrance, and yet you ought to know it!”\r\n\r\n“Sire, sire,” murmured the minister, “for pity’s——”\r\n\r\n“Approach, M. de Villefort,” resumed the king, addressing the young\r\nman, who, motionless and breathless, was listening to a conversation on\r\nwhich depended the destiny of a kingdom. “Approach, and tell monsieur\r\nthat it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known.”\r\n\r\n“Sire, it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man\r\nconcealed from all the world.”\r\n\r\n“Really impossible! Yes—that is a great word, sir. Unfortunately, there\r\nare great words, as there are great men; I have measured them. Really\r\nimpossible for a minister who has an office, agents, spies, and fifteen\r\nhundred thousand francs for secret service money, to know what is going\r\non at sixty leagues from the coast of France! Well, then, see, here is\r\na gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal—a\r\ngentleman, only a simple magistrate, who learned more than you with all\r\nyour police, and who would have saved my crown, if, like you, he had\r\nthe power of directing a telegraph.” The look of the minister of police\r\nwas turned with concentrated spite on Villefort, who bent his head in\r\nmodest triumph.\r\n\r\n“I do not mean that for you, Blacas,” continued Louis XVIII.; “for if\r\nyou have discovered nothing, at least you have had the good sense to\r\npersevere in your suspicions. Any other than yourself would have\r\nconsidered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant, or else\r\ndictated by venal ambition.” These words were an allusion to the\r\nsentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much\r\nconfidence an hour before.\r\n\r\nVillefort understood the king’s intent. Any other person would,\r\nperhaps, have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise;\r\nbut he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police\r\nminister, although he saw that Dandré was irrevocably lost. In fact,\r\nthe minister, who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to\r\nunearth Napoleon’s secret, might in despair at his own downfall\r\ninterrogate Dantès and so lay bare the motives of Villefort’s plot.\r\nRealizing this, Villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen\r\nminister, instead of aiding to crush him.\r\n\r\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “the suddenness of this event must prove to\r\nyour majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence; what your\r\nmajesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is\r\nsimply owing to chance, and I have profited by that chance, like a good\r\nand devoted servant—that’s all. Do not attribute to me more than I\r\ndeserve, sire, that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the\r\nfirst opinion you have been pleased to form of me.” The minister of\r\npolice thanked the young man by an eloquent look, and Villefort\r\nunderstood that he had succeeded in his design; that is to say, that\r\nwithout forfeiting the gratitude of the king, he had made a friend of\r\none on whom, in case of necessity, he might rely.\r\n\r\n“’Tis well,” resumed the king. “And now, gentlemen,” he continued,\r\nturning towards M. de Blacas and the minister of police, “I have no\r\nfurther occasion for you, and you may retire; what now remains to do is\r\nin the department of the minister of war.”\r\n\r\n“Fortunately, sire,” said M. de Blacas, “we can rely on the army; your\r\nmajesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment.”\r\n\r\n“Do not mention reports, duke, to me, for I know now what confidence to\r\nplace in them. Yet, speaking of reports, baron, what have you learned\r\nwith regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques?”\r\n\r\n“The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques!” exclaimed Villefort, unable to\r\nrepress an exclamation. Then, suddenly pausing, he added, “Your pardon,\r\nsire, but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget, not the\r\nrespect I have, for that is too deeply engraved in my heart, but the\r\nrules of etiquette.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, go on, sir,” replied the king; “you have today earned the right\r\nto make inquiries here.”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” interposed the minister of police, “I came a moment ago to give\r\nyour majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head, when\r\nyour majesty’s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has\r\noccurred in the gulf, and now these facts will cease to interest your\r\nmajesty.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, sir,—on the contrary,” said Louis XVIII., “this\r\naffair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which\r\noccupies our attention, and the death of General Quesnel will, perhaps,\r\nput us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy.” At the name\r\nof General Quesnel, Villefort trembled.\r\n\r\n“Everything points to the conclusion, sire,” said the minister of\r\npolice, “that death was not the result of suicide, as we first\r\nbelieved, but of assassination. General Quesnel, it appears, had just\r\nleft a Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been\r\nwith him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue\r\nSaint-Jacques; unfortunately, the general’s valet, who was dressing his\r\nhair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street\r\nmentioned, but did not catch the number.” As the police minister\r\nrelated this to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life\r\nhung on the speaker’s lips, turned alternately red and pale. The king\r\nlooked towards him.\r\n\r\n“Do you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel, whom\r\nthey believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely\r\ndevoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?”\r\n\r\n“It is probable, sire,” replied Villefort. “But is this all that is\r\nknown?”\r\n\r\n“They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him.”\r\n\r\n“On his track?” said Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the servant has given his description. He is a man of from fifty\r\nto fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy\r\neyebrows, and a thick moustache. He was dressed in a blue frock-coat,\r\nbuttoned up to the chin, and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an\r\nofficer of the Legion of Honor. Yesterday a person exactly\r\ncorresponding with this description was followed, but he was lost sight\r\nof at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-Héron.”\r\nVillefort leaned on the back of an armchair, for as the minister of\r\npolice went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him; but when he\r\nlearned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who\r\nfollowed him, he breathed again.\r\n\r\n“Continue to seek for this man, sir,” said the king to the minister of\r\npolice; “for if, as I am all but convinced, General Quesnel, who would\r\nhave been so useful to us at this moment, has been murdered, his\r\nassassins, Bonapartists or not, shall be cruelly punished.” It required\r\nall Villefort’s coolness not to betray the terror with which this\r\ndeclaration of the king inspired him.\r\n\r\n“How strange,” continued the king, with some asperity; “the police\r\nthink that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say, ‘A\r\nmurder has been committed,’ and especially so when they can add, ‘And\r\nwe are on the track of the guilty persons.’”\r\n\r\n“Sire, your majesty will, I trust, be amply satisfied on this point at\r\nleast.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see. I will no longer detain you, M. de Villefort, for you\r\nmust be fatigued after so long a journey; go and rest. Of course you\r\nstopped at your father’s?” A feeling of faintness came over Villefort.\r\n\r\n0145m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No, sire,” he replied, “I alighted at the Hotel de Madrid, in the Rue\r\nde Tournon.”\r\n\r\n“But you have seen him?”\r\n\r\n“Sire, I went straight to the Duc de Blacas.”\r\n\r\n“But you will see him, then?”\r\n\r\n“I think not, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I forgot,” said Louis, smiling in a manner which proved that all\r\nthese questions were not made without a motive; “I forgot you and M.\r\nNoirtier are not on the best terms possible, and that is another\r\nsacrifice made to the royal cause, and for which you should be\r\nrecompensed.”\r\n\r\n“Sire, the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a\r\nrecompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have\r\nnothing more to ask for.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind, sir, we will not forget you; make your mind easy. In the\r\nmeanwhile” (the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor\r\nwhich he usually wore over his blue coat, near the cross of St. Louis,\r\nabove the order of Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel and St. Lazare, and gave\r\nit to Villefort)—“in the meanwhile take this cross.”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “your majesty mistakes; this is an officer’s\r\ncross.”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_” said Louis XVIII., “take it, such as it is, for I have not\r\nthe time to procure you another. Blacas, let it be your care to see\r\nthat the brevet is made out and sent to M. de Villefort.” Villefort’s\r\neyes were filled with tears of joy and pride; he took the cross and\r\nkissed it.\r\n\r\n“And now,” he said, “may I inquire what are the orders with which your\r\nmajesty deigns to honor me?”\r\n\r\n“Take what rest you require, and remember that if you are not able to\r\nserve me here in Paris, you may be of the greatest service to me at\r\nMarseilles.”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” replied Villefort, bowing, “in an hour I shall have quitted\r\nParis.”\r\n\r\n“Go, sir,” said the king; “and should I forget you (kings’ memories are\r\nshort), do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection. Baron,\r\nsend for the minister of war. Blacas, remain.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir,” said the minister of police to Villefort, as they left the\r\nTuileries, “you entered by luck’s door—your fortune is made.”\r\n\r\n“Will it be long first?” muttered Villefort, saluting the minister,\r\nwhose career was ended, and looking about him for a hackney-coach. One\r\npassed at the moment, which he hailed; he gave his address to the\r\ndriver, and springing in, threw himself on the seat, and gave loose to\r\ndreams of ambition.\r\n\r\nTen minutes afterwards Villefort reached his hotel, ordered horses to\r\nbe ready in two hours, and asked to have his breakfast brought to him.\r\nHe was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp\r\nand loud. The valet opened the door, and Villefort heard someone speak\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\n0147m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Who could know that I was here already?” said the young man. The valet\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Villefort, “what is it?—Who rang?—Who asked for me?”\r\n\r\n“A stranger who will not send in his name.”\r\n\r\n“A stranger who will not send in his name! What can he want with me?”\r\n\r\n“He wishes to speak to you.”\r\n\r\n“To me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Did he mention my name?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of person is he?”\r\n\r\n“Why, sir, a man of about fifty.”\r\n\r\n“Short or tall?”\r\n\r\n“About your own height, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Dark or fair?”\r\n\r\n“Dark,—very dark; with black eyes, black hair, black eyebrows.”\r\n\r\n“And how dressed?” asked Villefort quickly.\r\n\r\n“In a blue frock-coat, buttoned up close, decorated with the Legion of\r\nHonor.”\r\n\r\n“It is he!” said Villefort, turning pale.\r\n\r\n0148m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Eh, _pardieu!_” said the individual whose description we have twice\r\ngiven, entering the door, “what a great deal of ceremony! Is it the\r\ncustom in Marseilles for sons to keep their fathers waiting in their\r\nanterooms?”\r\n\r\n“Father!” cried Villefort, “then I was not deceived; I felt sure it\r\nmust be you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, if you felt so sure,” replied the new-comer, putting his\r\ncane in a corner and his hat on a chair, “allow me to say, my dear\r\nGérard, that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the\r\ndoor.”\r\n\r\n“Leave us, Germain,” said Villefort. The servant quitted the apartment\r\nwith evident signs of astonishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 12. Father and Son\r\n\r\nM. Noirtier—for it was, indeed, he who entered—looked after the servant\r\nuntil the door was closed, and then, fearing, no doubt, that he might\r\nbe overheard in the antechamber, he opened the door again, nor was the\r\nprecaution useless, as appeared from the rapid retreat of Germain, who\r\nproved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first\r\nparents. M. Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the\r\nantechamber door, then that of the bedchamber, and then extended his\r\nhand to Villefort, who had followed all his motions with surprise which\r\nhe could not conceal.\r\n\r\n“Well, now, my dear Gérard,” said he to the young man, with a very\r\nsignificant look, “do you know, you seem as if you were not very glad\r\nto see me?”\r\n\r\n“My dear father,” said Villefort, “I am, on the contrary, delighted;\r\nbut I so little expected your visit, that it has somewhat overcome me.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear fellow,” replied M. Noirtier, seating himself, “I might\r\nsay the same thing to you, when you announce to me your wedding for the\r\n28th of February, and on the 3rd of March you turn up here in Paris.”\r\n\r\n“And if I have come, my dear father,” said Gérard, drawing closer to M.\r\nNoirtier, “do not complain, for it is for you that I came, and my\r\njourney will be your salvation.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed!” said M. Noirtier, stretching himself out at his ease in\r\nthe chair. “Really, pray tell me all about it, for it must be\r\ninteresting.”\r\n\r\n“Father, you have heard speak of a certain Bonapartist club in the Rue\r\nSaint-Jacques?”\r\n\r\n“No. 53; yes, I am vice-president.”\r\n\r\n“Father, your coolness makes me shudder.”\r\n\r\n“Why, my dear boy, when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers,\r\nhas escaped from Paris in a hay-cart, been hunted over the plains of\r\nBordeaux by Robespierre’s bloodhounds, he becomes accustomed to most\r\nthings. But go on, what about the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques?”\r\n\r\n“Why, they induced General Quesnel to go there, and General Quesnel,\r\nwho quitted his own house at nine o’clock in the evening, was found the\r\nnext day in the Seine.”\r\n\r\n0151m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“And who told you this fine story?”\r\n\r\n“The king himself.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, in return for your story,” continued Noirtier, “I will\r\ntell you another.”\r\n\r\n“My dear father, I think I already know what you are about to tell me.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you have heard of the landing of the emperor?”\r\n\r\n“Not so loud, father, I entreat of you—for your own sake as well as\r\nmine. Yes, I heard this news, and knew it even before you could; for\r\nthree days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible\r\nspeed, half-desperate at the enforced delay.”\r\n\r\n“Three days ago? You are crazy. Why, three days ago the emperor had not\r\nlanded.”\r\n\r\n“No matter, I was aware of his intention.”\r\n\r\n“How did you know about it?”\r\n\r\n“By a letter addressed to you from the Island of Elba.”\r\n\r\n“To me?”\r\n\r\n“To you; and which I discovered in the pocket-book of the messenger.\r\nHad that letter fallen into the hands of another, you, my dear father,\r\nwould probably ere this have been shot.” Villefort’s father laughed.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said he, “will the Restoration adopt imperial methods so\r\npromptly? Shot, my dear boy? What an idea! Where is the letter you\r\nspeak of? I know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing\r\nto pass you.”\r\n\r\n“I burnt it, for fear that even a fragment should remain; for that\r\nletter must have led to your condemnation.”\r\n\r\n“And the destruction of your future prospects,” replied Noirtier; “yes,\r\nI can easily comprehend that. But I have nothing to fear while I have\r\nyou to protect me.”\r\n\r\n“I do better than that, sir—I save you.”\r\n\r\n“You do? Why, really, the thing becomes more and more dramatic—explain\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“I must refer again to the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques.”\r\n\r\n“It appears that this club is rather a bore to the police. Why didn’t\r\nthey search more vigilantly? they would have found——”\r\n\r\n“They have not found; but they are on the track.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that the usual phrase; I am quite familiar with it. When the\r\npolice is at fault, it declares that it is on the track; and the\r\ngovernment patiently awaits the day when it comes to say, with a\r\nsneaking air, that the track is lost.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but they have found a corpse; the general has been killed, and in\r\nall countries they call that a murder.”\r\n\r\n“A murder do you call it? why, there is nothing to prove that the\r\ngeneral was murdered. People are found every day in the Seine, having\r\nthrown themselves in, or having been drowned from not knowing how to\r\nswim.”\r\n\r\n“Father, you know very well that the general was not a man to drown\r\nhimself in despair, and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month\r\nof January. No, no, do not be deceived; this was murder in every sense\r\nof the word.”\r\n\r\n“And who thus designated it?”\r\n\r\n“The king himself.”\r\n\r\n“The king! I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was\r\nno murder in politics. In politics, my dear fellow, you know, as well\r\nas I do, there are no men, but ideas—no feelings, but interests; in\r\npolitics we do not kill a man, we only remove an obstacle, that is all.\r\nWould you like to know how matters have progressed? Well, I will tell\r\nyou. It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel; he was\r\nrecommended to us from the Island of Elba; one of us went to him, and\r\ninvited him to the Rue Saint-Jacques, where he would find some friends.\r\nHe came there, and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba, the\r\nprojected landing, etc. When he had heard and comprehended all to the\r\nfullest extent, he replied that he was a royalist. Then all looked at\r\neach other,—he was made to take an oath, and did so, but with such an\r\nill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear thus, and\r\nyet, in spite of that, the general was allowed to depart free—perfectly\r\nfree. Yet he did not return home. What could that mean? why, my dear\r\nfellow, that on leaving us he lost his way, that’s all. A murder?\r\nreally, Villefort, you surprise me. You, a deputy procureur, to found\r\nan accusation on such bad premises! Did I ever say to you, when you\r\nwere fulfilling your character as a royalist, and cut off the head of\r\none of my party, ‘My son, you have committed a murder?’ No, I said,\r\n‘Very well, sir, you have gained the victory; tomorrow, perchance, it\r\nwill be our turn.’”\r\n\r\n“But, father, take care; when our turn comes, our revenge will be\r\nsweeping.”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand you.”\r\n\r\n“You rely on the usurper’s return?”\r\n\r\n“We do.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken; he will not advance two leagues into the interior of\r\nFrance without being followed, tracked, and caught like a wild beast.”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, the emperor is at this moment on the way to Grenoble;\r\non the 10th or 12th he will be at Lyons, and on the 20th or 25th at\r\nParis.”\r\n\r\n“The people will rise.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, to go and meet him.”\r\n\r\n“He has but a handful of men with him, and armies will be despatched\r\nagainst him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, to escort him into the capital. Really, my dear Gérard, you are\r\nbut a child; you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has\r\ntold you, three days after the landing, ‘The usurper has landed at\r\nCannes with several men. He is pursued.’ But where is he? what is he\r\ndoing? You do not know at all, and in this way they will chase him to\r\nParis, without drawing a trigger.”\r\n\r\n“Grenoble and Lyons are faithful cities, and will oppose to him an\r\nimpassable barrier.”\r\n\r\n“Grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasm—all Lyons will\r\nhasten to welcome him. Believe me, we are as well informed as you, and\r\nour police are as good as your own. Would you like a proof of it? well,\r\nyou wished to conceal your journey from me, and yet I knew of your\r\narrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier. You gave your\r\ndirection to no one but your postilion, yet I have your address, and in\r\nproof I am here the very instant you are going to sit at table. Ring,\r\nthen, if you please, for a second knife, fork, and plate, and we will\r\ndine together.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” replied Villefort, looking at his father with astonishment,\r\n“you really do seem very well informed.”\r\n\r\n“Eh? the thing is simple enough. You who are in power have only the\r\nmeans that money produces—we who are in expectation, have those which\r\ndevotion prompts.”\r\n\r\n“Devotion!” said Villefort, with a sneer.\r\n\r\n“Yes, devotion; for that is, I believe, the phrase for hopeful\r\nambition.”\r\n\r\nAnd Villefort’s father extended his hand to the bell-rope, to summon\r\nthe servant whom his son had not called. Villefort caught his arm.\r\n\r\n“Wait, my dear father,” said the young man, “one word more.”\r\n\r\n“Say on.”\r\n\r\n“However stupid the royalist police may be, they do know one terrible\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“The description of the man who, on the morning of the day when General\r\nQuesnel disappeared, presented himself at his house.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the admirable police have found that out, have they? And what may\r\nbe that description?”\r\n\r\n“Dark complexion; hair, eyebrows, and whiskers black; blue frock-coat,\r\nbuttoned up to the chin; rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor\r\nin his button-hole; a hat with wide brim, and a cane.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, ha, that’s it, is it?” said Noirtier; “and why, then, have they\r\nnot laid hands on him?”\r\n\r\n“Because yesterday, or the day before, they lost sight of him at the\r\ncorner of the Rue Coq-Héron.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t I say that your police were good for nothing?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but they may catch him yet.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Noirtier, looking carelessly around him, “true, if this\r\nperson were not on his guard, as he is;” and he added with a smile, “He\r\nwill consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance.” At\r\nthese words he rose, and put off his frock-coat and cravat, went\r\ntowards a table on which lay his son’s toilet articles, lathered his\r\nface, took a razor, and, with a firm hand, cut off the compromising\r\nwhiskers. Villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration.\r\n\r\nHis whiskers cut off, Noirtier gave another turn to his hair; took,\r\ninstead of his black cravat, a colored neckerchief which lay at the top\r\nof an open portmanteau; put on, in lieu of his blue and high-buttoned\r\nfrock-coat, a coat of Villefort’s of dark brown, and cut away in front;\r\ntried on before the glass a narrow-brimmed hat of his son’s, which\r\nappeared to fit him perfectly, and, leaving his cane in the corner\r\nwhere he had deposited it, he took up a small bamboo switch, cut the\r\nair with it once or twice, and walked about with that easy swagger\r\nwhich was one of his principal characteristics.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, turning towards his wondering son, when this disguise\r\nwas completed, “well, do you think your police will recognize me now.”\r\n\r\n“No, father,” stammered Villefort; “at least, I hope not.”\r\n\r\n“And now, my dear boy,” continued Noirtier, “I rely on your prudence to\r\nremove all the things which I leave in your care.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, rely on me,” said Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; and now I believe you are right, and that you have really\r\nsaved my life; be assured I will return the favor hereafter.”\r\n\r\nVillefort shook his head.\r\n\r\n“You are not convinced yet?”\r\n\r\n“I hope at least, that you may be mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“Shall you see the king again?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“Would you pass in his eyes for a prophet?”\r\n\r\n“Prophets of evil are not in favor at the court, father.”\r\n\r\n“True, but some day they do them justice; and supposing a second\r\nrestoration, you would then pass for a great man.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what should I say to the king?”\r\n\r\n“Say this to him: ‘Sire, you are deceived as to the feeling in France,\r\nas to the opinions of the towns, and the prejudices of the army; he\r\nwhom in Paris you call the Corsican ogre, who at Nevers is styled the\r\nusurper, is already saluted as Bonaparte at Lyons, and emperor at\r\nGrenoble. You think he is tracked, pursued, captured; he is advancing\r\nas rapidly as his own eagles. The soldiers you believe to be dying with\r\nhunger, worn out with fatigue, ready to desert, gather like atoms of\r\nsnow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward. Sire, go, leave\r\nFrance to its real master, to him who acquired it, not by purchase, but\r\nby right of conquest; go, sire, not that you incur any risk, for your\r\nadversary is powerful enough to show you mercy, but because it would be\r\nhumiliating for a grandson of Saint Louis to owe his life to the man of\r\nArcola, Marengo, Austerlitz.’ Tell him this, Gérard; or, rather, tell\r\nhim nothing. Keep your journey a secret; do not boast of what you have\r\ncome to Paris to do, or have done; return with all speed; enter\r\nMarseilles at night, and your house by the back-door, and there remain,\r\nquiet, submissive, secret, and, above all, inoffensive; for this time,\r\nI swear to you, we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies.\r\nGo, my son—go, my dear Gérard, and by your obedience to my paternal\r\norders, or, if you prefer it, friendly counsels, we will keep you in\r\nyour place. This will be,” added Noirtier, with a smile, “one means by\r\nwhich you may a second time save me, if the political balance should\r\nsome day take another turn, and cast you aloft while hurling me down.\r\nAdieu, my dear Gérard, and at your next journey alight at my door.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier left the room when he had finished, with the same calmness\r\nthat had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and\r\ntrying conversation. Villefort, pale and agitated, ran to the window,\r\nput aside the curtain, and saw him pass, cool and collected, by two or\r\nthree ill-looking men at the corner of the street, who were there,\r\nperhaps, to arrest a man with black whiskers, and a blue frock-coat,\r\nand hat with broad brim.\r\n\r\nVillefort stood watching, breathless, until his father had disappeared\r\nat the Rue Bussy. Then he turned to the various articles he had left\r\nbehind him, put the black cravat and blue frock-coat at the bottom of\r\nthe portmanteau, threw the hat into a dark closet, broke the cane into\r\nsmall bits and flung it in the fire, put on his travelling-cap, and\r\ncalling his valet, checked with a look the thousand questions he was\r\nready to ask, paid his bill, sprang into his carriage, which was ready,\r\nlearned at Lyons that Bonaparte had entered Grenoble, and in the midst\r\nof the tumult which prevailed along the road, at length reached\r\nMarseilles, a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the\r\nheart of man with ambition and its first successes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 13. The Hundred Days\r\n\r\nM. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\r\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\r\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\r\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\r\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\r\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\r\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\r\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\r\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\r\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\r\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\r\n\r\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\r\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\r\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\r\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\r\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\r\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\r\n\r\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\r\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\r\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\r\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\r\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\r\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\r\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\r\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\r\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\r\n\r\n0159m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\r\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\r\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\r\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\r\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\r\n\r\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\r\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\r\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\r\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\r\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\r\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\r\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\r\n\r\nAnyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\r\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\r\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\r\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\r\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\r\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\r\n\r\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\r\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\r\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\r\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\r\n\r\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\r\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\r\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\r\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\r\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\r\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\r\nhis hat in his hands,\r\n\r\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\r\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\r\ndelighted.”\r\n\r\n“Everything depends on you.”\r\n\r\n“Explain yourself, pray.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said Morrel, recovering his assurance as he proceeded, “do\r\nyou recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the\r\nemperor, I came to intercede for a young man, the mate of my ship, who\r\nwas accused of being concerned in correspondence with the Island of\r\nElba? What was the other day a crime is today a title to favor. You\r\nthen served Louis XVIII., and you did not show any favor—it was your\r\nduty; today you serve Napoleon, and you ought to protect him—it is\r\nequally your duty; I come, therefore, to ask what has become of him?”\r\n\r\n0161m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVillefort by a strong effort sought to control himself. “What is his\r\nname?” said he. “Tell me his name.”\r\n\r\n“Edmond Dantès.”\r\n\r\nVillefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a\r\npistol at five-and-twenty paces than have heard this name spoken; but\r\nhe did not blanch.\r\n\r\n“Dantès,” repeated he, “Edmond Dantès.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur.” Villefort opened a large register, then went to a\r\ntable, from the table turned to his registers, and then, turning to\r\nMorrel,\r\n\r\n“Are you quite sure you are not mistaken, monsieur?” said he, in the\r\nmost natural tone in the world.\r\n\r\nHad Morrel been a more quick-sighted man, or better versed in these\r\nmatters, he would have been surprised at the king’s procureur answering\r\nhim on such a subject, instead of referring him to the governors of the\r\nprison or the prefect of the department. But Morrel, disappointed in\r\nhis expectations of exciting fear, was conscious only of the other’s\r\ncondescension. Villefort had calculated rightly.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Morrel; “I am not mistaken. I have known him for ten years,\r\nthe last four of which he was in my service. Do not you recollect, I\r\ncame about six weeks ago to plead for clemency, as I come today to\r\nplead for justice. You received me very coldly. Oh, the royalists were\r\nvery severe with the Bonapartists in those days.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” returned Villefort, “I was then a royalist, because I\r\nbelieved the Bourbons not only the heirs to the throne, but the chosen\r\nof the nation. The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me, the\r\nlegitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right!” cried Morrel. “I like to hear you speak thus, and I\r\naugur well for Edmond from it.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a moment,” said Villefort, turning over the leaves of a register;\r\n“I have it—a sailor, who was about to marry a young Catalan girl. I\r\nrecollect now; it was a very serious charge.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de\r\nJustice.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I made my report to the authorities at Paris, and a week after he was\r\ncarried off.”\r\n\r\n“Carried off!” said Morrel. “What can they have done with him?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he has been taken to Fenestrelles, to Pignerol, or to the\r\nSainte-Marguérite islands. Some fine morning he will return to take\r\ncommand of your vessel.”\r\n\r\n“Come when he will, it shall be kept for him. But how is it he is not\r\nalready returned? It seems to me the first care of government should be\r\nto set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it.”\r\n\r\n“Do not be too hasty, M. Morrel,” replied Villefort. “The order of\r\nimprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation\r\nmust proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been\r\nreinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Morrel, “is there no way of expediting all these\r\nformalities—of releasing him from arrest?”\r\n\r\n“There has been no arrest.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“It is sometimes essential to government to cause a man’s disappearance\r\nwithout leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may\r\ndefeat their wishes.”\r\n\r\n“It might be so under the Bourbons, but at present——”\r\n\r\n“It has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis XIV.\r\nThe emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis\r\nhimself, and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the\r\nregister is incalculable.” Had Morrel even any suspicions, so much\r\nkindness would have dispelled them.\r\n\r\n“Well, M. de Villefort, how would you advise me to act?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“Petition the minister.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know what that is; the minister receives two hundred petitions\r\nevery day, and does not read three.”\r\n\r\n“That is true; but he will read a petition countersigned and presented\r\nby me.”\r\n\r\n“And will you undertake to deliver it?”\r\n\r\n“With the greatest pleasure. Dantès was then guilty, and now he is\r\ninnocent, and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn\r\nhim.” Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry, which,\r\nhowever improbable it might be, if it did take place would leave him\r\ndefenceless.\r\n\r\n“But how shall I address the minister?”\r\n\r\n“Sit down there,” said Villefort, giving up his place to Morrel, “and\r\nwrite what I dictate.”\r\n\r\n“Will you be so good?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. But lose no time; we have lost too much already.”\r\n\r\n“That is true. Only think what the poor fellow may even now be\r\nsuffering.”\r\n\r\nVillefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone too far to draw\r\nback. Dantès must be crushed to gratify Villefort’s ambition.\r\n\r\nVillefort dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent intention,\r\nno doubt, Dantès’ patriotic services were exaggerated, and he was made\r\nout one of the most active agents of Napoleon’s return. It was evident\r\nthat at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release\r\nhim. The petition finished, Villefort read it aloud.\r\n\r\n“That will do,” said he; “leave the rest to me.”\r\n\r\n“Will the petition go soon?”\r\n\r\n“Today.”\r\n\r\n“Countersigned by you?”\r\n\r\n“The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents\r\nof your petition.” And, sitting down, Villefort wrote the certificate\r\nat the bottom.\r\n\r\n“What more is to be done?”\r\n\r\n“I will do whatever is necessary.” This assurance delighted Morrel, who\r\ntook leave of Villefort, and hastened to announce to old Dantès that he\r\nwould soon see his son.\r\n\r\nAs for Villefort, instead of sending to Paris, he carefully preserved\r\nthe petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès, in the hopes of an\r\nevent that seemed not unlikely,—that is, a second restoration. Dantès\r\nremained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis\r\nXVIII.’s throne, or the still more tragic destruction of the empire.\r\n\r\nTwice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice\r\nhad Villefort soothed him with promises. At last there was Waterloo,\r\nand Morrel came no more; he had done all that was in his power, and any\r\nfresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly.\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII. remounted the throne; Villefort, to whom Marseilles had\r\nbecome filled with remorseful memories, sought and obtained the\r\nsituation of king’s procureur at Toulouse, and a fortnight afterwards\r\nhe married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, whose father now stood higher\r\nat court than ever.\r\n\r\nAnd so Dantès, after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained in\r\nhis dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven.\r\n\r\nDanglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that\r\noverwhelmed Dantès; and, when Napoleon returned to France, he, after\r\nthe manner of mediocre minds, termed the coincidence, _a decree of\r\nProvidence_. But when Napoleon returned to Paris, Danglars’ heart\r\nfailed him, and he lived in constant fear of Dantès’ return on a\r\nmission of vengeance. He therefore informed M. Morrel of his wish to\r\nquit the sea, and obtained a recommendation from him to a Spanish\r\nmerchant, into whose service he entered at the end of March, that is,\r\nten or twelve days after Napoleon’s return. He then left for Madrid,\r\nand was no more heard of.\r\n\r\nFernand understood nothing except that Dantès was absent. What had\r\nbecome of him he cared not to inquire. Only, during the respite the\r\nabsence of his rival afforded him, he reflected, partly on the means of\r\ndeceiving Mercédès as to the cause of his absence, partly on plans of\r\nemigration and abduction, as from time to time he sat sad and\r\nmotionless on the summit of Cape Pharo, at the spot from whence\r\nMarseilles and the Catalans are visible, watching for the apparition of\r\na young and handsome man, who was for him also the messenger of\r\nvengeance. Fernand’s mind was made up; he would shoot Dantès, and then\r\nkill himself. But Fernand was mistaken; a man of his disposition never\r\nkills himself, for he constantly hopes.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the empire made its last conscription, and every man\r\nin France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the\r\nemperor. Fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible\r\nthought that while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and\r\nmarry Mercédès. Had Fernand really meant to kill himself, he would have\r\ndone so when he parted from Mercédès. His devotion, and the compassion\r\nhe showed for her misfortunes, produced the effect they always produce\r\non noble minds—Mercédès had always had a sincere regard for Fernand,\r\nand this was now strengthened by gratitude.\r\n\r\n“My brother,” said she, as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders,\r\n“be careful of yourself, for if you are killed, I shall be alone in the\r\nworld.” These words carried a ray of hope into Fernand’s heart. Should\r\nDantès not return, Mercédès might one day be his.\r\n\r\n0165m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never\r\nseemed so barren, and the sea that had never seemed so vast. Bathed in\r\ntears she wandered about the Catalan village. Sometimes she stood mute\r\nand motionless as a statue, looking towards Marseilles, at other times\r\ngazing on the sea, and debating as to whether it were not better to\r\ncast herself into the abyss of the ocean, and thus end her woes. It was\r\nnot want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into\r\nexecution; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her.\r\n\r\nCaderousse was, like Fernand, enrolled in the army, but, being married\r\nand eight years older, he was merely sent to the frontier. Old Dantès,\r\nwho was only sustained by hope, lost all hope at Napoleon’s downfall.\r\nFive months after he had been separated from his son, and almost at the\r\nhour of his arrest, he breathed his last in Mercédès’ arms. M. Morrel\r\npaid the expenses of his funeral, and a few small debts the poor old\r\nman had contracted.\r\n\r\nThere was more than benevolence in this action; there was courage; the\r\nsouth was aflame, and to assist, even on his death-bed, the father of\r\nso dangerous a Bonapartist as Dantès, was stigmatized as a crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 14. The Two Prisoners\r\n\r\nA year after Louis XVIII.’s restoration, a visit was made by the\r\ninspector-general of prisons. Dantès in his cell heard the noise of\r\npreparation,—sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been\r\ninaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner, who could hear the splash\r\nof the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon.\r\nHe guessed something uncommon was passing among the living; but he had\r\nso long ceased to have any intercourse with the world, that he looked\r\nupon himself as dead.\r\n\r\nThe inspector visited, one after another, the cells and dungeons of\r\nseveral of the prisoners, whose good behavior or stupidity recommended\r\nthem to the clemency of the government. He inquired how they were fed,\r\nand if they had any request to make. The universal response was, that\r\nthe fare was detestable, and that they wanted to be set free.\r\n\r\nThe inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for. They shook\r\ntheir heads. What could they desire beyond their liberty? The inspector\r\nturned smilingly to the governor.\r\n\r\n“I do not know what reason government can assign for these useless\r\nvisits; when you see one prisoner, you see all,—always the same\r\nthing,—ill fed and innocent. Are there any others?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons.”\r\n\r\n“Let us visit them,” said the inspector with an air of fatigue. “We\r\nmust play the farce to the end. Let us see the dungeons.”\r\n\r\n“Let us first send for two soldiers,” said the governor. “The prisoners\r\nsometimes, through mere uneasiness of life, and in order to be\r\nsentenced to death, commit acts of useless violence, and you might fall\r\na victim.”\r\n\r\n“Take all needful precautions,” replied the inspector.\r\n\r\nTwo soldiers were accordingly sent for, and the inspector descended a\r\nstairway, so foul, so humid, so dark, as to be loathsome to sight,\r\nsmell, and respiration.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried the inspector, “who can live here?”\r\n\r\n“A most dangerous conspirator, a man we are ordered to keep the most\r\nstrict watch over, as he is daring and resolute.”\r\n\r\n“He is alone?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“How long has he been there?”\r\n\r\n“Nearly a year.”\r\n\r\n“Was he placed here when he first arrived?”\r\n\r\n“No; not until he attempted to kill the turnkey, who took his food to\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“To kill the turnkey?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the very one who is lighting us. Is it not true, Antoine?” asked\r\nthe governor.\r\n\r\n“True enough; he wanted to kill me!” returned the turnkey.\r\n\r\n“He must be mad,” said the inspector.\r\n\r\n“He is worse than that,—he is a devil!” returned the turnkey.\r\n\r\n“Shall I complain of him?” demanded the inspector.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; it is useless. Besides, he is almost mad now, and in another\r\nyear he will be quite so.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better for him,—he will suffer less,” said the inspector.\r\nHe was, as this remark shows, a man full of philanthropy, and in every\r\nway fit for his office.\r\n\r\n“You are right, sir,” replied the governor; “and this remark proves\r\nthat you have deeply considered the subject. Now we have in a dungeon\r\nabout twenty feet distant, and to which you descend by another stair,\r\nan old abbé, formerly leader of a party in Italy, who has been here\r\nsince 1811, and in 1813 he went mad, and the change is astonishing. He\r\nused to weep, he now laughs; he grew thin, he now grows fat. You had\r\nbetter see him, for his madness is amusing.”\r\n\r\n“I will see them both,” returned the inspector; “I must conscientiously\r\nperform my duty.”\r\n\r\nThis was the inspector’s first visit; he wished to display his\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n“Let us visit this one first,” added he.\r\n\r\n“By all means,” replied the governor, and he signed to the turnkey to\r\nopen the door. At the sound of the key turning in the lock, and the\r\ncreaking of the hinges, Dantès, who was crouched in a corner of the\r\ndungeon, whence he could see the ray of light that came through a\r\nnarrow iron grating above, raised his head. Seeing a stranger, escorted\r\nby two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers, and to\r\nwhom the governor spoke bareheaded, Dantès, who guessed the truth, and\r\nthat the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was\r\ncome, sprang forward with clasped hands.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers interposed their bayonets, for they thought that he was\r\nabout to attack the inspector, and the latter recoiled two or three\r\nsteps. Dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous. Then, infusing\r\nall the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice, he addressed the\r\ninspector, and sought to inspire him with pity.\r\n\r\nThe inspector listened attentively; then, turning to the governor,\r\nobserved, “He will become religious—he is already more gentle; he is\r\nafraid, and retreated before the bayonets—madmen are not afraid of\r\nanything; I made some curious observations on this at Charenton.” Then,\r\nturning to the prisoner, “What is it you want?” said he.\r\n\r\n“I want to know what crime I have committed—to be tried; and if I am\r\nguilty, to be shot; if innocent, to be set at liberty.”\r\n\r\n“Are you well fed?” said the inspector.\r\n\r\n“I believe so; I don’t know; it’s of no consequence. What matters\r\nreally, not only to me, but to officers of justice and the king, is\r\nthat an innocent man should languish in prison, the victim of an\r\ninfamous denunciation, to die here cursing his executioners.”\r\n\r\n“You are very humble today,” remarked the governor; “you are not so\r\nalways; the other day, for instance, when you tried to kill the\r\nturnkey.”\r\n\r\n“It is true, sir, and I beg his pardon, for he has always been very\r\ngood to me, but I was mad.”\r\n\r\n“And you are not so any longer?”\r\n\r\n“No; captivity has subdued me—I have been here so long.”\r\n\r\n“So long?—when were you arrested, then?” asked the inspector.\r\n\r\n“The 28th of February, 1815, at half-past two in the afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“Today is the 30th of July, 1816,—why, it is but seventeen months.”\r\n\r\n“Only seventeen months,” replied Dantès. “Oh, you do not know what is\r\nseventeen months in prison!—seventeen ages rather, especially to a man\r\nwho, like me, had arrived at the summit of his ambition—to a man, who,\r\nlike me, was on the point of marrying a woman he adored, who saw an\r\nhonorable career opened before him, and who loses all in an instant—who\r\nsees his prospects destroyed, and is ignorant of the fate of his\r\naffianced wife, and whether his aged father be still living! Seventeen\r\nmonths’ captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean, is a\r\nworse punishment than human crime ever merited. Have pity on me, then,\r\nand ask for me, not intelligence, but a trial; not pardon, but a\r\nverdict—a trial, sir, I ask only for a trial; that, surely, cannot be\r\ndenied to one who is accused!”\r\n\r\n“We shall see,” said the inspector; then, turning to the governor, “On\r\nmy word, the poor devil touches me. You must show me the proofs against\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; but you will find terrible charges.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” continued Dantès, “I know it is not in your power to\r\nrelease me; but you can plead for me—you can have me tried—and that is\r\nall I ask. Let me know my crime, and the reason why I was condemned.\r\nUncertainty is worse than all.”\r\n\r\n“Go on with the lights,” said the inspector.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” cried Dantès, “I can tell by your voice you are touched\r\nwith pity; tell me at least to hope.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot tell you that,” replied the inspector; “I can only promise to\r\nexamine into your case.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am free—then I am saved!”\r\n\r\n“Who arrested you?”\r\n\r\n“M. Villefort. See him, and hear what he says.”\r\n\r\n“M. Villefort is no longer at Marseilles; he is now at Toulouse.”\r\n\r\n“I am no longer surprised at my detention,” murmured Dantès, “since my\r\nonly protector is removed.”\r\n\r\n“Had M. de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you?”\r\n\r\n“None; on the contrary, he was very kind to me.”\r\n\r\n“I can, then, rely on the notes he has left concerning you?”\r\n\r\n“Entirely.”\r\n\r\n“That is well; wait patiently, then.”\r\n\r\nDantès fell on his knees, and prayed earnestly. The door closed; but\r\nthis time a fresh inmate was left with Dantès—Hope.\r\n\r\n0173m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Will you see the register at once,” asked the governor, “or proceed to\r\nthe other cell?”\r\n\r\n“Let us visit them all,” said the inspector. “If I once went up those\r\nstairs. I should never have the courage to come down again.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, this one is not like the other, and his madness is less affecting\r\nthan this one’s display of reason.”\r\n\r\n“What is his folly?”\r\n\r\n“He fancies he possesses an immense treasure. The first year he offered\r\ngovernment a million of francs for his release; the second, two; the\r\nthird, three; and so on progressively. He is now in his fifth year of\r\ncaptivity; he will ask to speak to you in private, and offer you five\r\nmillions.”\r\n\r\n“How curious!—what is his name?”\r\n\r\n“The Abbé Faria.”\r\n\r\n“No. 27,” said the inspector.\r\n\r\n“It is here; unlock the door, Antoine.”\r\n\r\nThe turnkey obeyed, and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber\r\nof the _mad abbé_, as the prisoner was usually called.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the cell, in a circle traced with a fragment of\r\nplaster detached from the wall, sat a man whose tattered garments\r\nscarcely covered him. He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines,\r\nand seemed as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the\r\nsoldier of Marcellus slew him. He did not move at the sound of the\r\ndoor, and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches\r\nlighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell; then,\r\nraising his head, he perceived with astonishment the number of persons\r\npresent. He hastily seized the coverlet of his bed, and wrapped it\r\nround him.\r\n\r\n“What is it you want?” said the inspector.\r\n\r\n“I, monsieur,” replied the abbé with an air of surprise,—“I want\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\n“You do not understand,” continued the inspector; “I am sent here by\r\ngovernment to visit the prison, and hear the requests of the\r\nprisoners.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that is different,” cried the abbé; “and we shall understand each\r\nother, I hope.”\r\n\r\n“There, now,” whispered the governor, “it is just as I told you.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” continued the prisoner, “I am the Abbé Faria, born at Rome.\r\nI was for twenty years Cardinal Spada’s secretary; I was arrested, why,\r\nI know not, toward the beginning of the year 1811; since then I have\r\ndemanded my liberty from the Italian and French government.”\r\n\r\n“Why from the French government?”\r\n\r\n“Because I was arrested at Piombino, and I presume that, like Milan and\r\nFlorence, Piombino has become the capital of some French department.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the inspector, “you have not the latest news from Italy?”\r\n\r\n“My information dates from the day on which I was arrested,” returned\r\nthe Abbé Faria; “and as the emperor had created the kingdom of Rome for\r\nhis infant son, I presume that he has realized the dream of Machiavelli\r\nand Cæsar Borgia, which was to make Italy a united kingdom.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” returned the inspector, “Providence has changed this\r\ngigantic plan you advocate so warmly.”\r\n\r\n“It is the only means of rendering Italy strong, happy, and\r\nindependent.”\r\n\r\n“Very possibly; only I am not come to discuss politics, but to inquire\r\nif you have anything to ask or to complain of.”\r\n\r\n“The food is the same as in other prisons,—that is, very bad; the\r\nlodging is very unhealthful, but, on the whole, passable for a dungeon;\r\nbut it is not that which I wish to speak of, but a secret I have to\r\nreveal of the greatest importance.”\r\n\r\n“We are coming to the point,” whispered the governor.\r\n\r\n“It is for that reason I am delighted to see you,” continued the abbé,\r\n“although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation, which,\r\nif it succeeded, would possibly change Newton’s system. Could you allow\r\nme a few words in private.”\r\n\r\n“What did I tell you?” said the governor.\r\n\r\n“You knew him,” returned the inspector with a smile.\r\n\r\n“What you ask is impossible, monsieur,” continued he, addressing Faria.\r\n\r\n0175m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“But,” said the abbé, “I would speak to you of a large sum, amounting\r\nto five millions.”\r\n\r\n“The very sum you named,” whispered the inspector in his turn.\r\n\r\n“However,” continued Faria, seeing that the inspector was about to\r\ndepart, “it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone; the\r\ngovernor can be present.”\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately,” said the governor, “I know beforehand what you are\r\nabout to say; it concerns your treasures, does it not?” Faria fixed his\r\neyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of\r\nhis sanity.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said he; “of what else should I speak?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Inspector,” continued the governor, “I can tell you the story as\r\nwell as he, for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five\r\nyears.”\r\n\r\n“That proves,” returned the abbé, “that you are like those of Holy\r\nWrit, who having eyes see not, and having ears hear not.”\r\n\r\n“My dear sir, the government is rich and does not want your treasures,”\r\nreplied the inspector; “keep them until you are liberated.” The abbé’s\r\neyes glistened; he seized the inspector’s hand.\r\n\r\n“But what if I am not liberated,” cried he, “and am detained here until\r\nmy death? this treasure will be lost. Had not government better profit\r\nby it? I will offer six millions, and I will content myself with the\r\nrest, if they will only give me my liberty.”\r\n\r\n“On my word,” said the inspector in a low tone, “had I not been told\r\nbeforehand that this man was mad, I should believe what he says.”\r\n\r\n“I am not mad,” replied Faria, with that acuteness of hearing peculiar\r\nto prisoners. “The treasure I speak of really exists, and I offer to\r\nsign an agreement with you, in which I promise to lead you to the spot\r\nwhere you shall dig; and if I deceive you, bring me here again,—I ask\r\nno more.”\r\n\r\nThe governor laughed. “Is the spot far from here?”\r\n\r\n“A hundred leagues.”\r\n\r\n“It is not ill-planned,” said the governor. “If all the prisoners took\r\nit into their heads to travel a hundred leagues, and their guardians\r\nconsented to accompany them, they would have a capital chance of\r\nescaping.”\r\n\r\n“The scheme is well known,” said the inspector; “and the abbé’s plan\r\nhas not even the merit of originality.”\r\n\r\nThen turning to Faria, “I inquired if you are well fed?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Swear to me,” replied Faria, “to free me if what I tell you prove\r\ntrue, and I will stay here while you go to the spot.”\r\n\r\n“Are you well fed?” repeated the inspector.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so\r\nthere is no chance of my escaping.”\r\n\r\n“You do not reply to my question,” replied the inspector impatiently.\r\n\r\n“Nor you to mine,” cried the abbé. “You will not accept my gold; I will\r\nkeep it for myself. You refuse me my liberty; God will give it me.” And\r\nthe abbé, casting away his coverlet, resumed his place, and continued\r\nhis calculations.\r\n\r\n0177m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What is he doing there?” said the inspector.\r\n\r\n“Counting his treasures,” replied the governor.\r\n\r\nFaria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. They\r\nwent out. The turnkey closed the door behind them.\r\n\r\n“He was wealthy once, perhaps?” said the inspector.\r\n\r\n“Or dreamed he was, and awoke mad.”\r\n\r\n“After all,” said the inspector, “if he had been rich, he would not\r\nhave been here.”\r\n\r\nSo the matter ended for the Abbé Faria. He remained in his cell, and\r\nthis visit only increased the belief in his insanity.\r\n\r\nCaligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the\r\nimpossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his\r\nwealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern\r\ntimes, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither\r\ncourage nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the\r\neye that scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves\r\nsprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are\r\nnot inviolable.\r\n\r\nIt has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer\r\nthe victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition\r\nrarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and\r\ntheir flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its\r\ncell, from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy\r\nhospital, where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the\r\nmutilated being the jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the\r\nAbbé Faria, gone mad in prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity.\r\n\r\nThe inspector kept his word with Dantès; he examined the register, and\r\nfound the following note concerning him:\r\n\r\n_Edmond Dantès:_\r\n\r\nViolent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba.\r\n\r\nThe greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised.\r\n\r\nThis note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it\r\nhad been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend\r\nagainst this accusation; he simply wrote, _Nothing to be done._\r\n\r\nThis visit had infused new vigor into Dantès; he had, till then,\r\nforgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the\r\ndate, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose\r\nhis reckoning again. Days and weeks passed away, then months—Dantès\r\nstill waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This\r\nfortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until\r\nhis return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his\r\ncircuit was finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months\r\npassed away, then six more. Finally ten months and a half had gone by\r\nand no favorable change had taken place, and Dantès began to fancy the\r\ninspector’s visit but a dream, an illusion of the brain.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had\r\nobtained charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his\r\nsubordinates, and amongst them Dantès’ jailer. A new governor arrived;\r\nit would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners;\r\nhe learned their numbers instead. This horrible place contained fifty\r\ncells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell,\r\nand the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantès—he was now\r\nnumber 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 15. Number 34 and Number 27\r\n\r\nDantès passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in\r\nsuspense. He was sustained at first by that pride of conscious\r\ninnocence which is the sequence to hope; then he began to doubt his own\r\ninnocence, which justified in some measure the governor’s belief in his\r\nmental alienation; and then, relaxing his sentiment of pride, he\r\naddressed his supplications, not to God, but to man. God is always the\r\nlast resource. Unfortunates, who ought to begin with God, do not have\r\nany hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\nDantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another, even\r\nif it were darker and deeper, for a change, however disadvantageous,\r\nwas still a change, and would afford him some amusement. He entreated\r\nto be allowed to walk about, to have fresh air, books, and writing\r\nmaterials. His requests were not granted, but he went on asking all the\r\nsame. He accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer, although the\r\nlatter was, if possible, more taciturn than the old one; but still, to\r\nspeak to a man, even though mute, was something. Dantès spoke for the\r\nsake of hearing his own voice; he had tried to speak when alone, but\r\nthe sound of his voice terrified him.\r\n\r\nOften, before his captivity, Dantès’ mind had revolted at the idea of\r\nassemblages of prisoners, made up of thieves, vagabonds, and murderers.\r\nHe now wished to be amongst them, in order to see some other face\r\nbesides that of his jailer; he sighed for the galleys, with the\r\ninfamous costume, the chain, and the brand on the shoulder. The\r\ngalley-slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven, and saw each other.\r\nThey were very happy.\r\n\r\nHe besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion, were it\r\neven the mad abbé. The jailer, though rough and hardened by the\r\nconstant sight of so much suffering, was yet a man. At the bottom of\r\nhis heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man\r\nwho suffered so; and he laid the request of number 34 before the\r\ngovernor; but the latter sapiently imagined that Dantès wished to\r\nconspire or attempt an escape, and refused his request. Dantès had\r\nexhausted all human resources, and he then turned to God.\r\n\r\nAll the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten, returned; he\r\nrecollected the prayers his mother had taught him, and discovered a new\r\nmeaning in every word; for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley\r\nof words, until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first\r\nunderstands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the\r\npity of heaven! He prayed, and prayed aloud, no longer terrified at the\r\nsound of his own voice, for he fell into a sort of ecstasy. He laid\r\nevery action of his life before the Almighty, proposed tasks to\r\naccomplish, and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty\r\noftener addressed to man than to God: “Forgive us our trespasses as we\r\nforgive them that trespass against us.” Yet in spite of his earnest\r\nprayers, Dantès remained a prisoner.\r\n\r\nThen gloom settled heavily upon him. Dantès was a man of great\r\nsimplicity of thought, and without education; he could not, therefore,\r\nin the solitude of his dungeon, traverse in mental vision the history\r\nof the ages, bring to life the nations that had perished, and rebuild\r\nthe ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the\r\nimagination, and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors\r\nin Martin’s Babylonian pictures. He could not do this, he whose past\r\nlife was so short, whose present so melancholy, and his future so\r\ndoubtful. Nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness!\r\nNo distraction could come to his aid; his energetic spirit, that would\r\nhave exalted in thus revisiting the past, was imprisoned like an eagle\r\nin a cage. He clung to one idea—that of his happiness, destroyed,\r\nwithout apparent cause, by an unheard-of fatality; he considered and\r\nreconsidered this idea, devoured it (so to speak), as the implacable\r\nUgolino devours the skull of Archbishop Roger in the Inferno of Dante.\r\n\r\nRage supplanted religious fervor. Dantès uttered blasphemies that made\r\nhis jailer recoil with horror, dashed himself furiously against the\r\nwalls of his prison, wreaked his anger upon everything, and chiefly\r\nupon himself, so that the least thing,—a grain of sand, a straw, or a\r\nbreath of air that annoyed him, led to paroxysms of fury. Then the\r\nletter that Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind, and every\r\nline gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the _mene, mene,\r\ntekel upharsin_ of Belshazzar. He told himself that it was the enmity\r\nof man, and not the vengeance of Heaven, that had thus plunged him into\r\nthe deepest misery. He consigned his unknown persecutors to the most\r\nhorrible tortures he could imagine, and found them all insufficient,\r\nbecause after torture came death, and after death, if not repose, at\r\nleast the boon of unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nBy dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death,\r\nand if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must\r\nbe invented, he began to reflect on suicide. Unhappy he, who, on the\r\nbrink of misfortune, broods over ideas like these!\r\n\r\nBefore him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye;\r\nbut he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself\r\nstruggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition. Once\r\nthus ensnared, unless the protecting hand of God snatch him thence, all\r\nis over, and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction. This\r\nstate of mental anguish is, however, less terrible than the sufferings\r\nthat precede or the punishment that possibly will follow. There is a\r\nsort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss, at the\r\nbottom of which lie darkness and obscurity.\r\n\r\nEdmond found some solace in these ideas. All his sorrows, all his\r\nsufferings, with their train of gloomy spectres, fled from his cell\r\nwhen the angel of death seemed about to enter. Dantès reviewed his past\r\nlife with composure, and, looking forward with terror to his future\r\nexistence, chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes,” said he, “in my voyages, when I was a man and commanded\r\nother men, I have seen the heavens overcast, the sea rage and foam, the\r\nstorm arise, and, like a monstrous bird, beating the two horizons with\r\nits wings. Then I felt that my vessel was a vain refuge, that trembled\r\nand shook before the tempest. Soon the fury of the waves and the sight\r\nof the sharp rocks announced the approach of death, and death then\r\nterrified me, and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a\r\nsailor to struggle against the wrath of God. But I did so because I was\r\nhappy, because I had not courted death, because to be cast upon a bed\r\nof rocks and seaweed seemed terrible, because I was unwilling that I, a\r\ncreature made for the service of God, should serve for food to the\r\ngulls and ravens. But now it is different; I have lost all that bound\r\nme to life, death smiles and invites me to repose; I die after my own\r\nmanner, I die exhausted and broken-spirited, as I fall asleep when I\r\nhave paced three thousand times round my cell,—that is thirty thousand\r\nsteps, or about ten leagues.”\r\n\r\nNo sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more\r\ncomposed, arranged his couch to the best of his power, ate little and\r\nslept less, and found existence almost supportable, because he felt\r\nthat he could throw it off at pleasure, like a worn-out garment. Two\r\nmethods of self-destruction were at his disposal. He could hang himself\r\nwith his handkerchief to the window bars, or refuse food and die of\r\nstarvation. But the first was repugnant to him. Dantès had always\r\nentertained the greatest horror of pirates, who are hung up to the\r\nyard-arm; he would not die by what seemed an infamous death. He\r\nresolved to adopt the second, and began that day to carry out his\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\n0185m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly four years had passed away; at the end of the second he had\r\nceased to mark the lapse of time. Dantès said, “I wish to die,” and had\r\nchosen the manner of his death, and fearful of changing his mind, he\r\nhad taken an oath to die. “When my morning and evening meals are\r\nbrought,” thought he, “I will cast them out of the window, and they\r\nwill think that I have eaten them.”\r\n\r\nHe kept his word; twice a day he cast out, through the barred aperture,\r\nthe provisions his jailer brought him—at first gayly, then with\r\ndeliberation, and at last with regret. Nothing but the recollection of\r\nhis oath gave him strength to proceed. Hunger made viands once\r\nrepugnant, now acceptable; he held the plate in his hand for an hour at\r\na time, and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat, of tainted\r\nfish, of black and mouldy bread. It was the last yearning for life\r\ncontending with the resolution of despair; then his dungeon seemed less\r\nsombre, his prospects less desperate. He was still young—he was only\r\nfour or five-and-twenty—he had nearly fifty years to live. What\r\nunforseen events might not open his prison door, and restore him to\r\nliberty? Then he raised to his lips the repast that, like a voluntary\r\nTantalus, he refused himself; but he thought of his oath, and he would\r\nnot break it. He persisted until, at last, he had not sufficient\r\nstrength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole. The next\r\nmorning he could not see or hear; the jailer feared he was dangerously\r\nill. Edmond hoped he was dying.\r\n\r\nThus the day passed away. Edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over\r\nhim which brought with it a feeling almost of content; the gnawing pain\r\nat his stomach had ceased; his thirst had abated; when he closed his\r\neyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the\r\nwill-o’-the-wisps that play about the marshes. It was the twilight of\r\nthat mysterious country called Death!\r\n\r\nSuddenly, about nine o’clock in the evening, Edmond heard a hollow\r\nsound in the wall against which he was lying.\r\n\r\nSo many loathsome animals inhabited the prison, that their noise did\r\nnot, in general, awake him; but whether abstinence had quickened his\r\nfaculties, or whether the noise was really louder than usual, Edmond\r\nraised his head and listened. It was a continual scratching, as if made\r\nby a huge claw, a powerful tooth, or some iron instrument attacking the\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nAlthough weakened, the young man’s brain instantly responded to the\r\nidea that haunts all prisoners—liberty! It seemed to him that heaven\r\nhad at length taken pity on him, and had sent this noise to warn him on\r\nthe very brink of the abyss. Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had\r\nso often thought of was thinking of him, and striving to diminish the\r\ndistance that separated them.\r\n\r\nNo, no, doubtless he was deceived, and it was but one of those dreams\r\nthat forerun death!\r\n\r\nEdmond still heard the sound. It lasted nearly three hours; he then\r\nheard a noise of something falling, and all was silent.\r\n\r\nSome hours afterwards it began again, nearer and more distinct. Edmond\r\nwas intensely interested. Suddenly the jailer entered.\r\n\r\nFor a week since he had resolved to die, and during the four days that\r\nhe had been carrying out his purpose, Edmond had not spoken to the\r\nattendant, had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter\r\nwith him, and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously\r\nat him; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it,\r\nand so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\nThe jailer brought him his breakfast. Dantès raised himself up and\r\nbegan to talk about everything; about the bad quality of the food,\r\nabout the coldness of his dungeon, grumbling and complaining, in order\r\nto have an excuse for speaking louder, and wearying the patience of his\r\njailer, who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread\r\nfor his prisoner.\r\n\r\nFortunately, he fancied that Dantès was delirious; and placing the food\r\non the rickety table, he withdrew. Edmond listened, and the sound\r\nbecame more and more distinct.\r\n\r\n“There can be no doubt about it,” thought he; “it is some prisoner who\r\nis striving to obtain his freedom. Oh, if I were only there to help\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly another idea took possession of his mind, so used to\r\nmisfortune, that it was scarcely capable of hope—the idea that the\r\nnoise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the\r\nneighboring dungeon.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to ascertain this; but how could he risk the question? It\r\nwas easy to call his jailer’s attention to the noise, and watch his\r\ncountenance as he listened; but might he not by this means destroy\r\nhopes far more important than the short-lived satisfaction of his own\r\ncuriosity? Unfortunately, Edmond’s brain was still so feeble that he\r\ncould not bend his thoughts to anything in particular. He saw but one\r\nmeans of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment. He turned\r\nhis eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought, rose, staggered\r\ntowards it, raised the vessel to his lips, and drank off the contents\r\nwith a feeling of indescribable pleasure.\r\n\r\nHe had the resolution to stop with this. He had often heard that\r\nshipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much\r\nfood. Edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour,\r\nand returned to his couch—he did not wish to die. He soon felt that his\r\nideas became again collected—he could think, and strengthen his\r\nthoughts by reasoning. Then he said to himself:\r\n\r\n“I must put this to the test, but without compromising anybody. If it\r\nis a workman, I need but knock against the wall, and he will cease to\r\nwork, in order to find out who is knocking, and why he does so; but as\r\nhis occupation is sanctioned by the governor, he will soon resume it.\r\nIf, on the contrary, it is a prisoner, the noise I make will alarm him,\r\nhe will cease, and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep.”\r\n\r\nEdmond rose again, but this time his legs did not tremble, and his\r\nsight was clear; he went to a corner of his dungeon, detached a stone,\r\nand with it knocked against the wall where the sound came. He struck\r\nthrice.\r\n\r\nAt the first blow the sound ceased, as if by magic.\r\n\r\nEdmond listened intently; an hour passed, two hours passed, and no\r\nsound was heard from the wall—all was silent there.\r\n\r\nFull of hope, Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water, and,\r\nthanks to the vigor of his constitution, found himself well-nigh\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nThe day passed away in utter silence—night came without recurrence of\r\nthe noise.\r\n\r\n“It is a prisoner,” said Edmond joyfully. His brain was on fire, and\r\nlife and energy returned.\r\n\r\nThe night passed in perfect silence. Edmond did not close his eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions—he had already\r\ndevoured those of the previous day; he ate these listening anxiously\r\nfor the sound, walking round and round his cell, shaking the iron bars\r\nof the loophole, restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise,\r\nand so preparing himself for his future destiny. At intervals he\r\nlistened to learn if the noise had not begun again, and grew impatient\r\nat the prudence of the prisoner, who did not guess he had been\r\ndisturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself.\r\n\r\nThree days passed—seventy-two long tedious hours which he counted off\r\nby minutes!\r\n\r\nAt length one evening, as the jailer was visiting him for the last time\r\nthat night, Dantès, with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall,\r\nfancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones. He\r\nmoved away, walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts, and\r\nthen went back and listened.\r\n\r\nThe matter was no longer doubtful. Something was at work on the other\r\nside of the wall; the prisoner had discovered the danger, and had\r\nsubstituted a lever for a chisel.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this discovery, Edmond determined to assist the\r\nindefatigable laborer. He began by moving his bed, and looked around\r\nfor anything with which he could pierce the wall, penetrate the moist\r\ncement, and displace a stone.\r\n\r\nHe saw nothing, he had no knife or sharp instrument, the window grating\r\nwas of iron, but he had too often assured himself of its solidity. All\r\nhis furniture consisted of a bed, a chair, a table, a pail, and a jug.\r\nThe bed had iron clamps, but they were screwed to the wood, and it\r\nwould have required a screw-driver to take them off. The table and\r\nchair had nothing, the pail had once possessed a handle, but that had\r\nbeen removed.\r\n\r\n0189m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDantès had but one resource, which was to break the jug, and with one\r\nof the sharp fragments attack the wall. He let the jug fall on the\r\nfloor, and it broke in pieces.\r\n\r\nDantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed,\r\nleaving the rest on the floor. The breaking of his jug was too natural\r\nan accident to excite suspicion. Edmond had all the night to work in,\r\nbut in the darkness he could not do much, and he soon felt that he was\r\nworking against something very hard; he pushed back his bed, and waited\r\nfor day.\r\n\r\nAll night he heard the subterranean workman, who continued to mine his\r\nway. Day came, the jailer entered. Dantès told him that the jug had\r\nfallen from his hands while he was drinking, and the jailer went\r\ngrumblingly to fetch another, without giving himself the trouble to\r\nremove the fragments of the broken one. He returned speedily, advised\r\nthe prisoner to be more careful, and departed.\r\n\r\nDantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock; he listened until the\r\nsound of steps died away, and then, hastily displacing his bed, saw by\r\nthe faint light that penetrated into his cell, that he had labored\r\nuselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of\r\nremoving the plaster that surrounded it.\r\n\r\nThe damp had rendered it friable, and Dantès was able to break it\r\noff—in small morsels, it is true, but at the end of half an hour he had\r\nscraped off a handful; a mathematician might have calculated that in\r\ntwo years, supposing that the rock was not encountered, a passage\r\ntwenty feet long and two feet broad, might be formed.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours\r\nhe had passed in vain hopes, prayer, and despondency. During the six\r\nyears that he had been imprisoned, what might he not have accomplished?\r\n\r\nThis idea imparted new energy, and in three days he had succeeded, with\r\nthe utmost precaution, in removing the cement, and exposing the\r\nstone-work. The wall was built of rough stones, among which, to give\r\nstrength to the structure, blocks of hewn stone were at intervals\r\nimbedded. It was one of these he had uncovered, and which he must\r\nremove from its socket.\r\n\r\nDantès strove to do this with his nails, but they were too weak. The\r\nfragments of the jug broke, and after an hour of useless toil, Dantès\r\npaused with anguish on his brow.\r\n\r\nWas he to be thus stopped at the beginning, and was he to wait inactive\r\nuntil his fellow workman had completed his task? Suddenly an idea\r\noccurred to him—he smiled, and the perspiration dried on his forehead.\r\n\r\nThe jailer always brought Dantès’ soup in an iron saucepan; this\r\nsaucepan contained soup for both prisoners, for Dantès had noticed that\r\nit was either quite full, or half empty, according as the turnkey gave\r\nit to him or to his companion first.\r\n\r\nThe handle of this saucepan was of iron; Dantès would have given ten\r\nyears of his life in exchange for it.\r\n\r\n0191m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into\r\nDantès’ plate, and Dantès, after eating his soup with a wooden spoon,\r\nwashed the plate, which thus served for every day. Now when evening\r\ncame Dantès put his plate on the ground near the door; the jailer, as\r\nhe entered, stepped on it and broke it.\r\n\r\nThis time he could not blame Dantès. He was wrong to leave it there,\r\nbut the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him. The jailer,\r\ntherefore, only grumbled. Then he looked about for something to pour\r\nthe soup into; Dantès’ entire dinner service consisted of one\r\nplate—there was no alternative.\r\n\r\n“Leave the saucepan,” said Dantès; “you can take it away when you bring\r\nme my breakfast.”\r\n\r\nThis advice was to the jailer’s taste, as it spared him the necessity\r\nof making another trip. He left the saucepan.\r\n\r\nDantès was beside himself with joy. He rapidly devoured his food, and\r\nafter waiting an hour, lest the jailer should change his mind and\r\nreturn, he removed his bed, took the handle of the saucepan, inserted\r\nthe point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall, and\r\nemployed it as a lever. A slight oscillation showed Dantès that all\r\nwent well. At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the\r\nwall, leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter.\r\n\r\nDantès carefully collected the plaster, carried it into the corner of\r\nhis cell, and covered it with earth. Then, wishing to make the best use\r\nof his time while he had the means of labor, he continued to work\r\nwithout ceasing. At the dawn of day he replaced the stone, pushed his\r\nbed against the wall, and lay down. The breakfast consisted of a piece\r\nof bread; the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table.\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t you intend to bring me another plate?” said Dantès.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the turnkey; “you destroy everything. First you break\r\nyour jug, then you make me break your plate; if all the prisoners\r\nfollowed your example, the government would be ruined. I shall leave\r\nyou the saucepan, and pour your soup into that. So for the future I\r\nhope you will not be so destructive.”\r\n\r\nDantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the\r\ncoverlet. He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of\r\niron than he had ever felt for anything. He had noticed, however, that\r\nthe prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor; no matter, this was\r\na greater reason for proceeding—if his neighbor would not come to him,\r\nhe would go to his neighbor. All day he toiled on untiringly, and by\r\nthe evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and\r\nfragments of stone. When the hour for his jailer’s visit arrived,\r\nDantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could, and\r\nplaced it in its accustomed place. The turnkey poured his ration of\r\nsoup into it, together with the fish—for thrice a week the prisoners\r\nwere deprived of meat. This would have been a method of reckoning time,\r\nhad not Dantès long ceased to do so. Having poured out the soup, the\r\nturnkey retired.\r\n\r\nDantès wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to\r\nwork. He listened—all was silent, as it had been for the last three\r\ndays. Dantès sighed; it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him.\r\nHowever, he toiled on all the night without being discouraged; but\r\nafter two or three hours he encountered an obstacle. The iron made no\r\nimpression, but met with a smooth surface; Dantès touched it, and found\r\nthat it was a beam. This beam crossed, or rather blocked up, the hole\r\nDantès had made; it was necessary, therefore, to dig above or under it.\r\nThe unhappy young man had not thought of this.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my God, my God!” murmured he, “I have so earnestly prayed to you,\r\nthat I hoped my prayers had been heard. After having deprived me of my\r\nliberty, after having deprived me of death, after having recalled me to\r\nexistence, my God, have pity on me, and do not let me die in despair!”\r\n\r\n0193m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Who talks of God and despair at the same time?” said a voice that\r\nseemed to come from beneath the earth, and, deadened by the distance,\r\nsounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man’s ears. Edmond’s hair\r\nstood on end, and he rose to his knees.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said he, “I hear a human voice.” Edmond had not heard anyone\r\nspeak save his jailer for four or five years; and a jailer is no man to\r\na prisoner—he is a living door, a barrier of flesh and blood adding\r\nstrength to restraints of oak and iron.\r\n\r\n“In the name of Heaven,” cried Dantès, “speak again, though the sound\r\nof your voice terrifies me. Who are you?”\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” said the voice.\r\n\r\n“An unhappy prisoner,” replied Dantès, who made no hesitation in\r\nanswering.\r\n\r\n“Of what country?”\r\n\r\n“A Frenchman.”\r\n\r\n“Your name?”\r\n\r\n“Edmond Dantès.”\r\n\r\n“Your profession?”\r\n\r\n“A sailor.”\r\n\r\n“How long have you been here?”\r\n\r\n“Since the 28th of February, 1815.”\r\n\r\n“Your crime?”\r\n\r\n“I am innocent.”\r\n\r\n“But of what are you accused?”\r\n\r\n“Of having conspired to aid the emperor’s return.”\r\n\r\n“What! For the emperor’s return?—the emperor is no longer on the\r\nthrone, then?”\r\n\r\n“He abdicated at Fontainebleau in 1814, and was sent to the Island of\r\nElba. But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all\r\nthis?”\r\n\r\n“Since 1811.”\r\n\r\nDantès shuddered; this man had been four years longer than himself in\r\nprison.\r\n\r\n“Do not dig any more,” said the voice; “only tell me how high up is\r\nyour excavation?”\r\n\r\n“On a level with the floor.”\r\n\r\n“How is it concealed?”\r\n\r\n“Behind my bed.”\r\n\r\n“Has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“What does your chamber open on?”\r\n\r\n“A corridor.”\r\n\r\n“And the corridor?”\r\n\r\n“On a court.”\r\n\r\n“Alas!” murmured the voice.\r\n\r\n“Oh, what is the matter?” cried Dantès.\r\n\r\n“I have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans. I took the wrong\r\nangle, and have come out fifteen feet from where I intended. I took the\r\nwall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress.”\r\n\r\n“But then you would be close to the sea?”\r\n\r\n“That is what I hoped.”\r\n\r\n“And supposing you had succeeded?”\r\n\r\n“I should have thrown myself into the sea, gained one of the islands\r\nnear here—the Isle de Daume or the Isle de Tiboulen—and then I should\r\nhave been safe.”\r\n\r\n“Could you have swum so far?”\r\n\r\n“Heaven would have given me strength; but now all is lost.”\r\n\r\n“All?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; stop up your excavation carefully, do not work any more, and wait\r\nuntil you hear from me.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, at least, who you are?”\r\n\r\n“I am—I am No. 27.”\r\n\r\n“You mistrust me, then,” said Dantès. Edmond fancied he heard a bitter\r\nlaugh resounding from the depths.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am a Christian,” cried Dantès, guessing instinctively that this\r\nman meant to abandon him. “I swear to you by him who died for us that\r\nnaught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers; but I\r\nconjure you do not abandon me. If you do, I swear to you, for I have\r\ngot to the end of my strength, that I will dash my brains out against\r\nthe wall, and you will have my death to reproach yourself with.”\r\n\r\n“How old are you? Your voice is that of a young man.”\r\n\r\n“I do not know my age, for I have not counted the years I have been\r\nhere. All I do know is, that I was just nineteen when I was arrested,\r\nthe 28th of February, 1815.”\r\n\r\n“Not quite twenty-six!” murmured the voice; “at that age he cannot be a\r\ntraitor.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no,” cried Dantès. “I swear to you again, rather than betray\r\nyou, I would allow myself to be hacked in pieces!”\r\n\r\n“You have done well to speak to me, and ask for my assistance, for I\r\nwas about to form another plan, and leave you; but your age reassures\r\nme. I will not forget you. Wait.”\r\n\r\n“How long?”\r\n\r\n“I must calculate our chances; I will give you the signal.”\r\n\r\n“But you will not leave me; you will come to me, or you will let me\r\ncome to you. We will escape, and if we cannot escape we will talk; you\r\nof those whom you love, and I of those whom I love. You must love\r\nsomebody?”\r\n\r\n“No, I am alone in the world.”\r\n\r\n“Then you will love me. If you are young, I will be your comrade; if\r\nyou are old, I will be your son. I have a father who is seventy if he\r\nyet lives; I only love him and a young girl called Mercédès. My father\r\nhas not yet forgotten me, I am sure, but God alone knows if she loves\r\nme still; I shall love you as I loved my father.”\r\n\r\n“It is well,” returned the voice; “tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nThese few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his\r\nsincerity; Dantès rose, dispersed the fragments with the same\r\nprecaution as before, and pushed his bed back against the wall. He then\r\ngave himself up to his happiness. He would no longer be alone. He was,\r\nperhaps, about to regain his liberty; at the worst, he would have a\r\ncompanion, and captivity that is shared is but half captivity. Plaints\r\nmade in common are almost prayers, and prayers where two or three are\r\ngathered together invoke the mercy of heaven.\r\n\r\nAll day Dantès walked up and down his cell. He sat down occasionally on\r\nhis bed, pressing his hand on his heart. At the slightest noise he\r\nbounded towards the door. Once or twice the thought crossed his mind\r\nthat he might be separated from this unknown, whom he loved already;\r\nand then his mind was made up—when the jailer moved his bed and stooped\r\nto examine the opening, he would kill him with his water jug. He would\r\nbe condemned to die, but he was about to die of grief and despair when\r\nthis miraculous noise recalled him to life.\r\n\r\nThe jailer came in the evening. Dantès was on his bed. It seemed to him\r\nthat thus he better guarded the unfinished opening. Doubtless there was\r\na strange expression in his eyes, for the jailer said, “Come, are you\r\ngoing mad again?”\r\n\r\nDantès did not answer; he feared that the emotion of his voice would\r\nbetray him. The jailer went away shaking his head. Night came; Dantès\r\nhoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him, but\r\nhe was mistaken. The next morning, however, just as he removed his bed\r\nfrom the wall, he heard three knocks; he threw himself on his knees.\r\n\r\n“Is it you?” said he; “I am here.”\r\n\r\n“Is your jailer gone?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Dantès; “he will not return until the evening; so that we\r\nhave twelve hours before us.”\r\n\r\n“I can work, then?” said the voice.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, yes; this instant, I entreat you.”\r\n\r\nIn a moment that part of the floor on which Dantès was resting his two\r\nhands, as he knelt with his head in the opening, suddenly gave way; he\r\ndrew back smartly, while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a\r\nhole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed. Then from\r\nthe bottom of this passage, the depth of which it was impossible to\r\nmeasure, he saw appear, first the head, then the shoulders, and lastly\r\nthe body of a man, who sprang lightly into his cell.\r\n\r\n0197m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 16. A Learned Italian\r\n\r\nSeizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired, Dantès\r\nalmost carried him towards the window, in order to obtain a better view\r\nof his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled\r\nthrough the grating.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of small stature, with hair blanched rather by suffering\r\nand sorrow than by age. He had a deep-set, penetrating eye, almost\r\nburied beneath the thick gray eyebrow, and a long (and still black)\r\nbeard reaching down to his breast. His thin face, deeply furrowed by\r\ncare, and the bold outline of his strongly marked features, betokened a\r\nman more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical\r\nstrength. Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow,\r\nwhile the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could\r\nonly guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been\r\nfashioned.\r\n\r\nThe stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty-five years; but a\r\ncertain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it\r\nprobable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time.\r\nHe received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with\r\nevident pleasure, as though his chilled affections were rekindled and\r\ninvigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent. He thanked him\r\nwith grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome, although he must at\r\nthat moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where\r\nhe had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty.\r\n\r\n“Let us first see,” said he, “whether it is possible to remove the\r\ntraces of my entrance here—our future tranquillity depends upon our\r\njailers being entirely ignorant of it.”\r\n\r\nAdvancing to the opening, he stooped and raised the stone easily in\r\nspite of its weight; then, fitting it into its place, he said:\r\n\r\n“You removed this stone very carelessly; but I suppose you had no tools\r\nto aid you.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” exclaimed Dantès, with astonishment, “do you possess any?”\r\n\r\n“I made myself some; and with the exception of a file, I have all that\r\nare necessary,—a chisel, pincers, and lever.”\r\n\r\n0201m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, how I should like to see these products of your industry and\r\npatience.”\r\n\r\n“Well, in the first place, here is my chisel.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he displayed a sharp strong blade, with a handle made of\r\nbeechwood.\r\n\r\n“And with what did you contrive to make that?” inquired Dantès.\r\n\r\n“With one of the clamps of my bedstead; and this very tool has sufficed\r\nme to hollow out the road by which I came hither, a distance of about\r\nfifty feet.”\r\n\r\n“Fifty feet!” responded Dantès, almost terrified.\r\n\r\n“Do not speak so loud, young man—don’t speak so loud. It frequently\r\noccurs in a state prison like this, that persons are stationed outside\r\nthe doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the\r\nprisoners.”\r\n\r\n“But they believe I am shut up alone here.”\r\n\r\n“That makes no difference.”\r\n\r\n“And you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“I do; that is about the distance that separates your chamber from\r\nmine; only, unfortunately, I did not curve aright; for want of the\r\nnecessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion,\r\ninstead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet, I made it fifty. I\r\nexpected, as I told you, to reach the outer wall, pierce through it,\r\nand throw myself into the sea; I have, however, kept along the corridor\r\non which your chamber opens, instead of going beneath it. My labor is\r\nall in vain, for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled\r\nwith soldiers.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true,” said Dantès; “but the corridor you speak of only bounds\r\n_one_ side of my cell; there are three others—do you know anything of\r\ntheir situation?”\r\n\r\n“This one is built against the solid rock, and it would take ten\r\nexperienced miners, duly furnished with the requisite tools, as many\r\nyears to perforate it. This adjoins the lower part of the governor’s\r\napartments, and were we to work our way through, we should only get\r\ninto some lock-up cellars, where we must necessarily be recaptured. The\r\nfourth and last side of your cell faces on—faces on—stop a minute, now\r\nwhere does it face?”\r\n\r\nThe wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole\r\nby which light was admitted to the chamber. This loophole, which\r\ngradually diminished in size as it approached the outside, to an\r\nopening through which a child could not have passed, was, for better\r\nsecurity, furnished with three iron bars, so as to quiet all\r\napprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the\r\npossibility of a prisoner’s escape. As the stranger asked the question,\r\nhe dragged the table beneath the window.\r\n\r\n“Climb up,” said he to Dantès.\r\n\r\nThe young man obeyed, mounted on the table, and, divining the wishes of\r\nhis companion, placed his back securely against the wall and held out\r\nboth hands. The stranger, whom as yet Dantès knew only by the number of\r\nhis cell, sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a\r\nperson of his years, and, light and steady on his feet as a cat or a\r\nlizard, climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of Dantès, and\r\nfrom them to his shoulders; then, bending double, for the ceiling of\r\nthe dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect, he managed to\r\nslip his head between the upper bars of the window, so as to be able to\r\ncommand a perfect view from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nAn instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head, saying, “I thought\r\nso!” and sliding from the shoulders of Dantès as dextrously as he had\r\nascended, he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground.\r\n\r\n“What was it that you thought?” asked the young man anxiously, in his\r\nturn descending from the table.\r\n\r\nThe elder prisoner pondered the matter. “Yes,” said he at length, “it\r\nis so. This side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery,\r\nwhere patrols are continually passing, and sentries keep watch day and\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“Are you quite sure of that?”\r\n\r\n“Certain. I saw the soldier’s shape and the top of his musket; that\r\nmade me draw in my head so quickly, for I was fearful he might also see\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” inquired Dantès.\r\n\r\n“You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your\r\ndungeon?”\r\n\r\n“Then——” pursued the young man eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Then,” answered the elder prisoner, “the will of God be done!” And as\r\nthe old man slowly pronounced those words, an air of profound\r\nresignation spread itself over his careworn countenance. Dantès gazed\r\non the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and\r\nardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, I entreat of you, who and what you are?” said he at length.\r\n“Never have I met with so remarkable a person as yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Willingly,” answered the stranger; “if, indeed, you feel any curiosity\r\nrespecting one, now, alas, powerless to aid you in any way.”\r\n\r\n“Say not so; you can console and support me by the strength of your own\r\npowerful mind. Pray let me know who you really are?”\r\n\r\nThe stranger smiled a melancholy smile. “Then listen,” said he. “I am\r\nthe Abbé Faria, and have been imprisoned as you know in this Château\r\nd’If since the year 1811; previously to which I had been confined for\r\nthree years in the fortress of Fenestrelle. In the year 1811 I was\r\ntransferred to Piedmont in France. It was at this period I learned that\r\nthe destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by Napoleon,\r\nhad bestowed on him a son, named king of Rome even in his cradle. I was\r\nvery far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of;\r\nnamely, that four years afterwards, this colossus of power would be\r\noverthrown. Then who reigns in France at this moment—Napoleon II.?”\r\n\r\n“No, Louis XVIII.”\r\n\r\n“The brother of Louis XVI.! How inscrutable are the ways of\r\nProvidence—for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased Heaven\r\nto abase the man once so elevated, and raise up him who was so abased?”\r\n\r\nDantès’ whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his\r\nown misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” continued he, “’Twill be the same as it was in England.\r\nAfter Charles I., Cromwell; after Cromwell, Charles II., and then James\r\nII., and then some son-in-law or relation, some Prince of Orange, a\r\nstadtholder who becomes a king. Then new concessions to the people,\r\nthen a constitution, then liberty. Ah, my friend!” said the abbé,\r\nturning towards Dantès, and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a\r\nprophet, “you are young, you will see all this come to pass.”\r\n\r\n“Probably, if ever I get out of prison!”\r\n\r\n“True,” replied Faria, “we are prisoners; but I forget this sometimes,\r\nand there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond\r\nthese walls, and I fancy myself at liberty.”\r\n\r\n“But wherefore are you here?”\r\n\r\n“Because in 1807 I dreamed of the very plan Napoleon tried to realize\r\nin 1811; because, like Machiavelli, I desired to alter the political\r\nface of Italy, and instead of allowing it to be split up into a\r\nquantity of petty principalities, each held by some weak or tyrannical\r\nruler, I sought to form one large, compact, and powerful empire; and,\r\nlastly, because I fancied I had found my Cæsar Borgia in a crowned\r\nsimpleton, who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me. It was\r\nthe plan of Alexander VI. and Clement VII., but it will never succeed\r\nnow, for they attempted it fruitlessly, and Napoleon was unable to\r\ncomplete his work. Italy seems fated to misfortune.” And the old man\r\nbowed his head.\r\n\r\nDantès could not understand a man risking his life for such matters.\r\nNapoleon certainly he knew something of, inasmuch as he had seen and\r\nspoken with him; but of Clement VII. and Alexander VI. he knew nothing.\r\n\r\n“Are you not,” he asked, “the priest who here in the Château d’If is\r\ngenerally thought to be—ill?”\r\n\r\n“Mad, you mean, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“I did not like to say so,” answered Dantès, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” resumed Faria with a bitter smile, “let me answer your\r\nquestion in full, by acknowledging that I am the poor mad prisoner of\r\nthe Château d’If, for many years permitted to amuse the different\r\nvisitors with what is said to be my insanity; and, in all probability,\r\nI should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children, if\r\nsuch innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to\r\nsuffering and despair.”\r\n\r\nDantès remained for a short time mute and motionless; at length he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Then you abandon all hope of escape?”\r\n\r\n“I perceive its utter impossibility; and I consider it impious to\r\nattempt that which the Almighty evidently does not approve.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, be not discouraged. Would it not be expecting too much to hope to\r\nsucceed at your first attempt? Why not try to find an opening in\r\nanother direction from that which has so unfortunately failed?”\r\n\r\n“Alas, it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to\r\neffect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated, that you talk of beginning\r\nover again. In the first place, I was four years making the tools I\r\npossess, and have been two years scraping and digging out earth, hard\r\nas granite itself; then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove\r\nhuge stones I should once have deemed impossible to loosen. Whole days\r\nhave I passed in these Titanic efforts, considering my labor well\r\nrepaid if, by night-time I had contrived to carry away a square inch of\r\nthis hard-bound cement, changed by ages into a substance unyielding as\r\nthe stones themselves; then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish I\r\ndug up, I was compelled to break through a staircase, and throw the\r\nfruits of my labor into the hollow part of it; but the well is now so\r\ncompletely choked up, that I scarcely think it would be possible to add\r\nanother handful of dust without leading to discovery. Consider also\r\nthat I fully believed I had accomplished the end and aim of my\r\nundertaking, for which I had so exactly husbanded my strength as to\r\nmake it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise; and now, at\r\nthe moment when I reckoned upon success, my hopes are forever dashed\r\nfrom me. No, I repeat again, that nothing shall induce me to renew\r\nattempts evidently at variance with the Almighty’s pleasure.”\r\n\r\nDantès held down his head, that the other might not see how joy at the\r\nthought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the\r\nfailure of the abbé’s plans.\r\n\r\nThe abbé sank upon Edmond’s bed, while Edmond himself remained\r\nstanding. Escape had never once occurred to him. There are, indeed,\r\nsome things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on\r\nthem for an instant. To undermine the ground for fifty feet—to devote\r\nthree years to a labor which, if successful, would conduct you to a\r\nprecipice overhanging the sea—to plunge into the waves from the height\r\nof fifty, sixty, perhaps a hundred feet, at the risk of being dashed to\r\npieces against the rocks, should you have been fortunate enough to have\r\nescaped the fire of the sentinels; and even, supposing all these perils\r\npast, then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three\r\nmiles ere you could reach the shore—were difficulties so startling and\r\nformidable that Dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme,\r\nresigning himself rather to death.\r\n\r\nBut the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a\r\ncourage, gave a fresh turn to his ideas, and inspired him with new\r\ncourage. Another, older and less strong than he, had attempted what he\r\nhad not had sufficient resolution to undertake, and had failed only\r\nbecause of an error in calculation. This same person, with almost\r\nincredible patience and perseverance, had contrived to provide himself\r\nwith tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt. Another had done\r\nall this; why, then, was it impossible to Dantès? Faria had dug his way\r\nthrough fifty feet, Dantès would dig a hundred; Faria, at the age of\r\nfifty, had devoted three years to the task; he, who was but half as\r\nold, would sacrifice six; Faria, a priest and savant, had not shrunk\r\nfrom the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three\r\nmiles to one of the islands—Daume, Rattonneau, or Lemaire; should a\r\nhardy sailor, an experienced diver, like himself, shrink from a similar\r\ntask; should he, who had so often for mere amusement’s sake plunged to\r\nthe bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch, hesitate to\r\nentertain the same project? He could do it in an hour, and how many\r\ntimes had he, for pure pastime, continued in the water for more than\r\ntwice as long! At once Dantès resolved to follow the brave example of\r\nhis energetic companion, and to remember that what has once been done\r\nmay be done again.\r\n\r\nAfter continuing some time in profound meditation, the young man\r\nsuddenly exclaimed, “I have found what you were in search of!”\r\n\r\nFaria started: “Have you, indeed?” cried he, raising his head with\r\nquick anxiety; “pray, let me know what it is you have discovered?”\r\n\r\n“The corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you\r\noccupy here, extends in the same direction as the outer gallery, does\r\nit not?”\r\n\r\n0207m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It does.”\r\n\r\n“And is not above fifteen feet from it?”\r\n\r\n“About that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I will tell you what we must do. We must pierce through\r\nthe corridor by forming a side opening about the middle, as it were the\r\ntop part of a cross. This time you will lay your plans more accurately;\r\nwe shall get out into the gallery you have described; kill the sentinel\r\nwho guards it, and make our escape. All we require to insure success is\r\ncourage, and that you possess, and strength, which I am not deficient\r\nin; as for patience, you have abundantly proved yours—you shall now see\r\nme prove mine.”\r\n\r\n“One instant, my dear friend,” replied the abbé; “it is clear you do\r\nnot understand the nature of the courage with which I am endowed, and\r\nwhat use I intend making of my strength. As for patience, I consider\r\nthat I have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the\r\ntask of the night before, and every night renewing the task of the day.\r\nBut then, young man (and I pray of you to give me your full attention),\r\nthen I thought I could not be doing anything displeasing to the\r\nAlmighty in trying to set an innocent being at liberty—one who had\r\ncommitted no offence, and merited not condemnation.”\r\n\r\n“And have your notions changed?” asked Dantès with much surprise; “do\r\nyou think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have\r\nencountered me?”\r\n\r\n“No; neither do I wish to incur guilt. Hitherto I have fancied myself\r\nmerely waging war against circumstances, not men. I have thought it no\r\nsin to bore through a wall, or destroy a staircase; but I cannot so\r\neasily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life.”\r\n\r\nA slight movement of surprise escaped Dantès.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible,” said he, “that where your liberty is at stake you can\r\nallow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it?”\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” replied Faria, “what has hindered you from knocking down\r\nyour jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead, dressing\r\nyourself in his clothes, and endeavoring to escape?”\r\n\r\n“Simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me,” answered Dantès.\r\n\r\n“Because,” said the old man, “the natural repugnance to the commission\r\nof such a crime prevented you from thinking of it; and so it ever is\r\nbecause in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us\r\nfrom deviating from the strict line of duty. The tiger, whose nature\r\nteaches him to delight in shedding blood, needs but the sense of smell\r\nto show him when his prey is within his reach, and by following this\r\ninstinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to\r\nspring on his victim; but man, on the contrary, loathes the idea of\r\nblood—it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a\r\nshrinking dread of taking life; his natural construction and\r\nphysiological formation——”\r\n\r\nDantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts\r\nwhich had unconsciously been working in his mind, or rather soul; for\r\nthere are two distinct sorts of ideas, those that proceed from the head\r\nand those that emanate from the heart.\r\n\r\n0209m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Since my imprisonment,” said Faria, “I have thought over all the most\r\ncelebrated cases of escape on record. They have rarely been successful.\r\nThose that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated\r\nupon, and carefully arranged; such, for instance, as the escape of the\r\nDuc de Beaufort from the Château de Vincennes, that of the Abbé\r\nDubuquoi from For l’Evêque; of Latude from the Bastille. Then there are\r\nthose for which chance sometimes affords opportunity, and those are the\r\nbest of all. Let us, therefore, wait patiently for some favorable\r\nmoment, and when it presents itself, profit by it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Dantès, “you might well endure the tedious delay; you were\r\nconstantly employed in the task you set yourself, and when weary with\r\ntoil, you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you.”\r\n\r\n“I assure you,” replied the old man, “I did not turn to that source for\r\nrecreation or support.”\r\n\r\n“What did you do then?”\r\n\r\n“I wrote or studied.”\r\n\r\n“Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” answered the abbé; “I had none but what I made for myself.”\r\n\r\n“You made paper, pens and ink?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nDantès gazed with admiration, but he had some difficulty in believing.\r\nFaria saw this.\r\n\r\n“When you pay me a visit in my cell, my young friend,” said he, “I will\r\nshow you an entire work, the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of\r\nmy whole life; many of them meditated over in the shades of the\r\nColosseum at Rome, at the foot of St. Mark’s column at Venice, and on\r\nthe borders of the Arno at Florence, little imagining at the time that\r\nthey would be arranged in order within the walls of the Château d’If.\r\nThe work I speak of is called _A Treatise on the Possibility of a\r\nGeneral Monarchy in Italy_, and will make one large quarto volume.”\r\n\r\n“And on what have you written all this?”\r\n\r\n“On two of my shirts. I invented a preparation that makes linen as\r\nsmooth and as easy to write on as parchment.”\r\n\r\n“You are, then, a chemist?”\r\n\r\n“Somewhat; I know Lavoisier, and was the intimate friend of Cabanis.”\r\n\r\n“But for such a work you must have needed books—had you any?”\r\n\r\n“I had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome; but after\r\nreading them over many times, I found out that with one hundred and\r\nfifty well-chosen books a man possesses, if not a complete summary of\r\nall human knowledge, at least all that a man need really know. I\r\ndevoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one\r\nhundred and fifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that\r\nsince I have been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled\r\nme to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open\r\nbefore me. I could recite you the whole of Thucydides, Xenophon,\r\nPlutarch, Titus Livius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne,\r\nShakespeare, Spinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet. I name only the most\r\nimportant.”\r\n\r\n“You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to\r\nhave been able to read all these?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I speak five of the modern tongues—that is to say, German,\r\nFrench, Italian, English, and Spanish; by the aid of ancient Greek I\r\nlearned modern Greek—I don’t speak it so well as I could wish, but I am\r\nstill trying to improve myself.”\r\n\r\n“Improve yourself!” repeated Dantès; “why, how can you manage to do\r\nso?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I made a vocabulary of the words I knew; turned, returned, and\r\narranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their\r\nmedium. I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is\r\nabsolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred\r\nthousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I\r\ncertainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes;\r\nand that would be quite as much as I should ever require.”\r\n\r\nStronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do\r\nwith one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some\r\nimperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings,\r\nhe added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage\r\nto write the work you speak of?”\r\n\r\n“I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally\r\npreferred to all others if once known. You are aware what huge whitings\r\nare served to us on _maigre_ days. Well, I selected the cartilages of\r\nthe heads of these fishes, and you can scarcely imagine the delight\r\nwith which I welcomed the arrival of each Wednesday, Friday, and\r\nSaturday, as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens; for\r\nI will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest\r\nsolace and relief. While retracing the past, I forget the present; and\r\ntraversing at will the path of history I cease to remember that I am\r\nmyself a prisoner.”\r\n\r\n“But the ink,” said Dantès; “of what did you make your ink?”\r\n\r\n“There was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon,” replied Faria, “but it\r\nwas closed up long ere I became an occupant of this prison. Still, it\r\nmust have been many years in use, for it was thickly covered with a\r\ncoating of soot; this soot I dissolved in a portion of the wine brought\r\nto me every Sunday, and I assure you a better ink cannot be desired.\r\nFor very important notes, for which closer attention is required, I\r\npricked one of my fingers, and wrote with my own blood.”\r\n\r\n“And when,” asked Dantès, “may I see all this?”\r\n\r\n“Whenever you please,” replied the abbé.\r\n\r\n“Oh, then let it be directly!” exclaimed the young man.\r\n\r\n“Follow me, then,” said the abbé, as he re-entered the subterranean\r\npassage, in which he soon disappeared, followed by Dantès.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber\r\n\r\nAfter having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean\r\npassage, which, however, did not admit of their holding themselves\r\nerect, the two friends reached the further end of the corridor, into\r\nwhich the abbé’s cell opened; from that point the passage became much\r\nnarrower, and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees.\r\nThe floor of the abbé’s cell was paved, and it had been by raising one\r\nof the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to\r\ncommence the laborious task of which Dantès had witnessed the\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the chamber of his friend, Dantès cast around one eager\r\nand searching glance in quest of the expected marvels, but nothing more\r\nthan common met his view.\r\n\r\n“It is well,” said the abbé; “we have some hours before us—it is now\r\njust a quarter past twelve o’clock.” Instinctively Dantès turned round\r\nto observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately\r\nto specify the hour.\r\n\r\n“Look at this ray of light which enters by my window,” said the abbé,\r\n“and then observe the lines traced on the wall. Well, by means of these\r\nlines, which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth, and\r\nthe ellipse it describes round the sun, I am enabled to ascertain the\r\nprecise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a watch; for that\r\nmight be broken or deranged in its movements, while the sun and earth\r\nnever vary in their appointed paths.”\r\n\r\nThis last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès, who had always\r\nimagined, from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in\r\nthe Mediterranean, that it moved, and not the earth. A double movement\r\nof the globe he inhabited, and of which he could feel nothing, appeared\r\nto him perfectly impossible. Each word that fell from his companion’s\r\nlips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science, as worthy of digging\r\nout as the gold and diamonds in the mines of Guzerat and Golconda,\r\nwhich he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in\r\nhis earliest youth.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said he to the abbé, “I am anxious to see your treasures.”\r\n\r\nThe abbé smiled, and, proceeding to the disused fireplace, raised, by\r\nthe help of his chisel, a long stone, which had doubtless been the\r\nhearth, beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth, serving as a\r\nsafe depository of the articles mentioned to Dantès.\r\n\r\n0213m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What do you wish to see first?” asked the abbé.\r\n\r\n“Oh, your great work on the monarchy of Italy!”\r\n\r\nFaria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of\r\nlinen, laid one over the other, like folds of papyrus. These rolls\r\nconsisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long;\r\nthey were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing, so\r\nlegible that Dantès could easily read it, as well as make out the\r\nsense—it being in Italian, a language he, as a Provençal, perfectly\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n“There,” said he, “there is the work complete. I wrote the word _finis_\r\nat the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago. I have torn up\r\ntwo of my shirts, and as many handkerchiefs as I was master of, to\r\ncomplete the precious pages. Should I ever get out of prison and find\r\nin all Italy a printer courageous enough to publish what I have\r\ncomposed, my literary reputation is forever secured.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” answered Dantès. “Now let me behold the curious pens with\r\nwhich you have written your work.”\r\n\r\n“Look!” said Faria, showing to the young man a slender stick about six\r\ninches long, and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine\r\npainting-brush, to the end of which was tied, by a piece of thread, one\r\nof those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to Dantès; it\r\nwas pointed, and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen. Dantès\r\nexamined it with intense admiration, then looked around to see the\r\ninstrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” said Faria; “the penknife. That’s my masterpiece. I made it,\r\nas well as this larger knife, out of an old iron candlestick.” The\r\npenknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the other knife, it\r\nwould serve a double purpose, and with it one could cut and thrust.\r\n\r\nDantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same\r\nattention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools\r\nexhibited in the shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the\r\nSouth Seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\n“As for the ink,” said Faria, “I told you how I managed to obtain\r\nthat—and I only just make it from time to time, as I require it.”\r\n\r\n“One thing still puzzles me,” observed Dantès, “and that is how you\r\nmanaged to do all this by daylight?”\r\n\r\n“I worked at night also,” replied Faria.\r\n\r\n“Night!—why, for Heaven’s sake, are your eyes like cats’, that you can\r\nsee to work in the dark?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed they are not; but God has supplied man with the intelligence\r\nthat enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions. I\r\nfurnished myself with a light.”\r\n\r\n“You did? Pray tell me how.”\r\n\r\n“I separated the fat from the meat served to me, melted it, and so made\r\noil—here is my lamp.” So saying, the abbé exhibited a sort of torch\r\nvery similar to those used in public illuminations.\r\n\r\n“But how do you procure a light?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen.”\r\n\r\n“And matches?”\r\n\r\n“I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin, and asked for a little\r\nsulphur, which was readily supplied.”\r\n\r\nDantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table,\r\nand stood with his head drooping on his breast, as though overwhelmed\r\nby the perseverance and strength of Faria’s mind.\r\n\r\n0215m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You have not seen all yet,” continued Faria, “for I did not think it\r\nwise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding-place. Let us shut\r\nthis one up.” They put the stone back in its place; the abbé sprinkled\r\na little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed,\r\nrubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the\r\nother, and then, going towards his bed, he removed it from the spot it\r\nstood in. Behind the head of the bed, and concealed by a stone fitting\r\nin so closely as to defy all suspicion, was a hollow space, and in this\r\nspace a ladder of cords between twenty-five and thirty feet in length.\r\nDantès closely and eagerly examined it; he found it firm, solid, and\r\ncompact enough to bear any weight.\r\n\r\n“Who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work?”\r\n\r\n“I tore up several of my shirts, and ripped out the seams in the sheets\r\nof my bed, during my three years’ imprisonment at Fenestrelle; and when\r\nI was removed to the Château d’If, I managed to bring the ravellings\r\nwith me, so that I have been able to finish my work here.”\r\n\r\n“And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, for when I had taken out the thread I required, I hemmed the\r\nedges over again.”\r\n\r\n“With what?”\r\n\r\n“With this needle,” said the abbé, as, opening his ragged vestments, he\r\nshowed Dantès a long, sharp fish-bone, with a small perforated eye for\r\nthe thread, a small portion of which still remained in it.\r\n\r\n“I once thought,” continued Faria, “of removing these iron bars, and\r\nletting myself down from the window, which, as you see, is somewhat\r\nwider than yours, although I should have enlarged it still more\r\npreparatory to my flight; however, I discovered that I should merely\r\nhave dropped into a sort of inner court, and I therefore renounced the\r\nproject altogether as too full of risk and danger. Nevertheless, I\r\ncarefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen\r\nopportunities of which I spoke just now, and which sudden chance\r\nfrequently brings about.”\r\n\r\nWhile affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder, the mind\r\nof Dantès was, in fact, busily occupied by the idea that a person so\r\nintelligent, ingenious, and clear-sighted as the abbé might probably be\r\nable to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes, where he himself\r\ncould see nothing.\r\n\r\n“What are you thinking of?” asked the abbé smilingly, imputing the deep\r\nabstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe\r\nand wonder.\r\n\r\n“I was reflecting, in the first place,” replied Dantès, “upon the\r\nenormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to\r\nreach the high perfection to which you have attained. What would you\r\nnot have accomplished if you had been free?”\r\n\r\n“Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a\r\nstate of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune is\r\nneeded to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect.\r\nCompression is needed to explode gunpowder. Captivity has brought my\r\nmental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from the\r\ncollision of clouds electricity is produced—from electricity,\r\nlightning, from lightning, illumination.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Dantès. “I know nothing. Some of your words are to me\r\nquite empty of meaning. You must be blessed indeed to possess the\r\nknowledge you have.”\r\n\r\nThe abbé smiled. “Well,” said he, “but you had another subject for your\r\nthoughts; did you not say so just now?”\r\n\r\n“I did!”\r\n\r\n“You have told me as yet but one of them—let me hear the other.”\r\n\r\n“It was this,—that while you had related to me all the particulars of\r\nyour past life, you were perfectly unacquainted with mine.”\r\n\r\n“Your life, my young friend, has not been of sufficient length to admit\r\nof your having passed through any very important events.”\r\n\r\n“It has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved\r\nmisfortune. I would fain fix the source of it on man that I may no\r\nlonger vent reproaches upon Heaven.”\r\n\r\n“Then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged?”\r\n\r\n“I do, indeed; and this I swear by the two beings most dear to me upon\r\nearth,—my father and Mercédès.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said the abbé, closing his hiding-place, and pushing the bed\r\nback to its original situation, “let me hear your story.”\r\n\r\nDantès obeyed, and commenced what he called his history, but which\r\nconsisted only of the account of a voyage to India, and two or three\r\nvoyages to the Levant, until he arrived at the recital of his last\r\ncruise, with the death of Captain Leclere, and the receipt of a packet\r\nto be delivered by himself to the grand marshal; his interview with\r\nthat personage, and his receiving, in place of the packet brought, a\r\nletter addressed to a Monsieur Noirtier—his arrival at Marseilles, and\r\ninterview with his father—his affection for Mercédès, and their nuptial\r\nfeast—his arrest and subsequent examination, his temporary detention at\r\nthe Palais de Justice, and his final imprisonment in the Château d’If.\r\nFrom this point everything was a blank to Dantès—he knew nothing more,\r\nnot even the length of time he had been imprisoned. His recital\r\nfinished, the abbé reflected long and earnestly.\r\n\r\n“There is,” said he, at the end of his meditations, “a clever maxim,\r\nwhich bears upon what I was saying to you some little while ago, and\r\nthat is, that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved\r\nmind, human nature, in a right and wholesome state, revolts at crime.\r\nStill, from an artificial civilization have originated wants, vices,\r\nand false tastes, which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle\r\nwithin us all good feelings, and ultimately to lead us into guilt and\r\nwickedness. From this view of things, then, comes the axiom that if you\r\nvisit to discover the author of any bad action, seek first to discover\r\nthe person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any\r\nway advantageous. Now, to apply it in your case,—to whom could your\r\ndisappearance have been serviceable?”\r\n\r\n“To no one, by Heaven! I was a very insignificant person.”\r\n\r\n“Do not speak thus, for your reply evinces neither logic nor\r\nphilosophy; everything is relative, my dear young friend, from the king\r\nwho stands in the way of his successor, to the employee who keeps his\r\nrival out of a place. Now, in the event of the king’s death, his\r\nsuccessor inherits a crown,—when the employee dies, the supernumerary\r\nsteps into his shoes, and receives his salary of twelve thousand\r\nlivres. Well, these twelve thousand livres are his civil list, and are\r\nas essential to him as the twelve millions of a king. Everyone, from\r\nthe highest to the lowest degree, has his place on the social ladder,\r\nand is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests, as in\r\nDescartes’ theory of pressure and impulsion. But these forces increase\r\nas we go higher, so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason\r\nrests upon the apex and not on the base. Now let us return to your\r\nparticular world. You say you were on the point of being made captain\r\nof the _Pharaon_?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Now, could anyone have had any interest in preventing the\r\naccomplishment of these two things? But let us first settle the\r\nquestion as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from\r\nbeing captain of the _Pharaon_. What say you?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot believe such was the case. I was generally liked on board,\r\nand had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain\r\nthemselves, I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me.\r\nThere was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of\r\nill-will towards me. I had quarelled with him some time previously, and\r\nhad even challenged him to fight me; but he refused.”\r\n\r\n“Now we are getting on. And what was this man’s name?”\r\n\r\n“Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“What rank did he hold on board?”\r\n\r\n“He was supercargo.”\r\n\r\n“And had you been captain, should you have retained him in his\r\nemployment?”\r\n\r\n“Not if the choice had remained with me, for I had frequently observed\r\ninaccuracies in his accounts.”\r\n\r\n“Good again! Now then, tell me, was any person present during your last\r\nconversation with Captain Leclere?”\r\n\r\n“No; we were quite alone.”\r\n\r\n“Could your conversation have been overheard by anyone?”\r\n\r\n“It might, for the cabin door was open—and—stay; now I\r\nrecollect,—Danglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was\r\ngiving me the packet for the grand marshal.”\r\n\r\n“That’s better,” cried the abbé; “now we are on the right scent. Did\r\nyou take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba?”\r\n\r\n“Nobody.”\r\n\r\n“Somebody there received your packet, and gave you a letter in place of\r\nit, I think?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; the grand marshal did.”\r\n\r\n“And what did you do with that letter?”\r\n\r\n“Put it into my portfolio.”\r\n\r\n“You had your portfolio with you, then? Now, how could a sailor find\r\nroom in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official\r\nletter?”\r\n\r\n“You are right; it was left on board.”\r\n\r\n“Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter\r\nin the portfolio?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“And what did you do with this same letter while returning from\r\nPorto-Ferrajo to the vessel?”\r\n\r\n“I carried it in my hand.”\r\n\r\n“So that when you went on board the _Pharaon_, everybody could see that\r\nyou held a letter in your hand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Danglars, as well as the rest?”\r\n\r\n“Danglars, as well as others.”\r\n\r\n“Now, listen to me, and try to recall every circumstance attending your\r\narrest. Do you recollect the words in which the information against you\r\nwas formulated?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, I read it over three times, and the words sank deeply into my\r\nmemory.”\r\n\r\n“Repeat it to me.”\r\n\r\nDantès paused a moment, then said, “This is it, word for word: ‘The\r\nking’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion,\r\nthat one Edmond Dantès, mate on board the _Pharaon_, this day arrived\r\nfrom Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been\r\nintrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the\r\nusurper, with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris. This proof of\r\nhis guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest, as the letter will\r\nbe found either about his person, at his father’s residence, or in his\r\ncabin on board the _Pharaon_.’”\r\n\r\nThe abbé shrugged his shoulders. “The thing is clear as day,” said he;\r\n“and you must have had a very confiding nature, as well as a good\r\nheart, not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair.”\r\n\r\n“Do you really think so? Ah, that would indeed be infamous.”\r\n\r\n“How did Danglars usually write?”\r\n\r\n“In a handsome, running hand.”\r\n\r\n“And how was the anonymous letter written?”\r\n\r\n“Backhanded.”\r\n\r\nAgain the abbé smiled. “Disguised.”\r\n\r\n“It was very boldly written, if disguised.”\r\n\r\n“Stop a bit,” said the abbé, taking up what he called his pen, and,\r\nafter dipping it into the ink, he wrote on a piece of prepared linen,\r\nwith his left hand, the first two or three words of the accusation.\r\nDantès drew back, and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost\r\namounting to terror.\r\n\r\n“How very astonishing!” cried he at length. “Why your writing exactly\r\nresembles that of the accusation.”\r\n\r\n“Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand;\r\nand I have noticed that——”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand\r\nvaries, that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform.”\r\n\r\n“You have evidently seen and observed everything.”\r\n\r\n“Let us proceed.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, yes!”\r\n\r\n“Now as regards the second question.”\r\n\r\n“I am listening.”\r\n\r\n“Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage\r\nwith Mercédès?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; a young man who loved her.”\r\n\r\n“And his name was——”\r\n\r\n“Fernand.”\r\n\r\n“That is a Spanish name, I think?”\r\n\r\n“He was a Catalan.”\r\n\r\n“You imagine him capable of writing the letter?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife\r\ninto me.”\r\n\r\n“That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character; an\r\nassassination they will unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice,\r\nnever.”\r\n\r\n“Besides,” said Dantès, “the various circumstances mentioned in the\r\nletter were wholly unknown to him.”\r\n\r\n“You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone?”\r\n\r\n“To no one.”\r\n\r\n“Not even to your mistress?”\r\n\r\n“No, not even to my betrothed.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“I feel quite sure of it now.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a little. Pray, was Danglars acquainted with Fernand?”\r\n\r\n“No—yes, he was. Now I recollect——”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“To have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at\r\nPère Pamphile’s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding. They\r\nwere in earnest conversation. Danglars was joking in a friendly way,\r\nbut Fernand looked pale and agitated.”\r\n\r\n“Were they alone?”\r\n\r\n“There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well, and who\r\nhad, in all probability made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named\r\nCaderousse, but he was very drunk. Stay!—stay!—How strange that it\r\nshould not have occurred to me before! Now I remember quite well, that\r\non the table round which they were sitting were pens, ink, and paper.\r\nOh, the heartless, treacherous scoundrels!” exclaimed Dantès, pressing\r\nhis hand to his throbbing brows.\r\n\r\n“Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering, besides the\r\nvillany of your friends?” inquired the abbé with a laugh.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” replied Dantès eagerly; “I would beg of you, who see so\r\ncompletely to the depths of things, and to whom the greatest mystery\r\nseems but an easy riddle, to explain to me how it was that I underwent\r\nno second examination, was never brought to trial, and, above all, was\r\ncondemned without ever having had sentence passed on me?”\r\n\r\n“That is altogether a different and more serious matter,” responded the\r\nabbé. “The ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be\r\neasily penetrated. All we have hitherto done in the matter has been\r\nchild’s play. If you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of\r\nthe business, you must assist me by the most minute information on\r\nevery point.”\r\n\r\n“Pray ask me whatever questions you please; for, in good truth, you see\r\nmore clearly into my life than I do myself.”\r\n\r\n“In the first place, then, who examined you,—the king’s attorney, his\r\ndeputy, or a magistrate?”\r\n\r\n“The deputy.”\r\n\r\n“Was he young or old?”\r\n\r\n“About six or seven-and-twenty years of age, I should say.”\r\n\r\n“So,” answered the abbé. “Old enough to be ambitious, but too young to\r\nbe corrupt. And how did he treat you?”\r\n\r\n“With more of mildness than severity.”\r\n\r\n“Did you tell him your whole story?”\r\n\r\n“I did.”\r\n\r\n“And did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination?”\r\n\r\n“He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought\r\nme into this scrape. He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune.”\r\n\r\n“By your misfortune?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored?”\r\n\r\n“He gave me one great proof of his sympathy, at any rate.”\r\n\r\n“And that?”\r\n\r\n“He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me.”\r\n\r\n“What? the accusation?”\r\n\r\n“No; the letter.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure?”\r\n\r\n“I saw it done.”\r\n\r\n“That alters the case. This man might, after all, be a greater\r\nscoundrel than you have thought possible.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” said Dantès, “you make me shudder. Is the world filled\r\nwith tigers and crocodiles?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more\r\ndangerous than the others.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind; let us go on.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart! You tell me he burned the letter?”\r\n\r\n“He did; saying at the same time, ‘You see I thus destroy the only\r\nproof existing against you.’”\r\n\r\n“This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.”\r\n\r\n“You think so?”\r\n\r\n“I am sure of it. To whom was this letter addressed?”\r\n\r\n“To M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13, Paris.”\r\n\r\n“Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could\r\npossibly have had in the destruction of that letter?”\r\n\r\n“Why, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made me\r\npromise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone, assuring\r\nme he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he\r\ninsisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned\r\nin the address.”\r\n\r\n“Noirtier!” repeated the abbé; “Noirtier!—I knew a person of that name\r\nat the court of the Queen of Etruria,—a Noirtier, who had been a\r\nGirondin during the Revolution! What was your deputy called?”\r\n\r\n“De Villefort!” The abbé burst into a fit of laughter, while Dantès\r\ngazed on him in utter astonishment.\r\n\r\n“What ails you?” said he at length.\r\n\r\n“Do you see that ray of sunlight?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you.\r\nPoor fellow! poor young man! And you tell me this magistrate expressed\r\ngreat sympathy and commiseration for you?”\r\n\r\n“He did.”\r\n\r\n“And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this\r\nNoirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed? This\r\nNoirtier was his father!”\r\n\r\nHad a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dantès, or hell opened its\r\nyawning gulf before him, he could not have been more completely\r\ntransfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected\r\nwords. Starting up, he clasped his hands around his head as though to\r\nprevent his very brain from bursting, and exclaimed, “His father! his\r\nfather!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, his father,” replied the abbé; “his right name was Noirtier de\r\nVillefort.”\r\n\r\nAt this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dantès, and\r\ncleared up all that had been dark and obscure before. The change that\r\nhad come over Villefort during the examination, the destruction of the\r\nletter, the exacted promise, the almost supplicating tones of the\r\nmagistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce\r\npunishment,—all returned with a stunning force to his memory. He cried\r\nout, and staggered against the wall like a drunken man, then he hurried\r\nto the opening that led from the abbé’s cell to his own, and said, “I\r\nmust be alone, to think over all this.”\r\n\r\nWhen he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the\r\nturnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and\r\ncontracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue. During these\r\nhours of profound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he\r\nhad formed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by\r\na solemn oath.\r\n\r\nDantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria,\r\nwho, having also been visited by his jailer, had come to invite his\r\nfellow-sufferer to share his supper. The reputation of being out of his\r\nmind, though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the\r\nabbé unusual privileges. He was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter\r\nquality than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each Sunday with a\r\nsmall quantity of wine. Now this was a Sunday, and the abbé had come to\r\nask his young companion to share the luxuries with him.\r\n\r\nDantès followed him; his features were no longer contracted, and now\r\nwore their usual expression, but there was that in his whole appearance\r\nthat bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve. Faria\r\nbent on him his penetrating eye.\r\n\r\n“I regret now,” said he, “having helped you in your late inquiries, or\r\nhaving given you the information I did.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?” inquired Dantès.\r\n\r\n“Because it has instilled a new passion in your heart—that of\r\nvengeance.”\r\n\r\nDantès smiled. “Let us talk of something else,” said he.\r\n\r\nAgain the abbé looked at him, then mournfully shook his head; but in\r\naccordance with Dantès’ request, he began to speak of other matters.\r\nThe elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation, like\r\nthat of all who have experienced many trials, contained many useful and\r\nimportant hints as well as sound information; but it was never\r\negotistical, for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows.\r\nDantès listened with admiring attention to all he said; some of his\r\nremarks corresponded with what he already knew, or applied to the sort\r\nof knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire. A part of\r\nthe good abbé’s words, however, were wholly incomprehensible to him;\r\nbut, like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes,\r\nopened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener, and gave\r\nfantastic glimpses of new horizons, enabling him justly to estimate the\r\ndelight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly\r\ngifted as Faria along the heights of truth, where he was so much at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n“You must teach me a small part of what you know,” said Dantès, “if\r\nonly to prevent your growing weary of me. I can well believe that so\r\nlearned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being\r\ntormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself.\r\nIf you will only agree to my request, I promise you never to mention\r\nanother word about escaping.”\r\n\r\nThe abbé smiled.\r\n\r\n“Alas, my boy,” said he, “human knowledge is confined within very\r\nnarrow limits; and when I have taught you mathematics, physics,\r\nhistory, and the three or four modern languages with which I am\r\nacquainted, you will know as much as I do myself. Now, it will scarcely\r\nrequire two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I\r\npossess.”\r\n\r\n“Two years!” exclaimed Dantès; “do you really believe I can acquire all\r\nthese things in so short a time?”\r\n\r\n“Not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to\r\nlearn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory\r\nmakes the one, philosophy the other.”\r\n\r\n“But cannot one learn philosophy?”\r\n\r\n“Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to\r\ntruth; it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into\r\nheaven.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Dantès, “What shall you teach me first? I am in a\r\nhurry to begin. I want to learn.”\r\n\r\n“Everything,” said the abbé. And that very evening the prisoners\r\nsketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day.\r\nDantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing\r\nquickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his\r\nmind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally\r\npoetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality\r\nof arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He\r\nalready knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic\r\ndialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two\r\nlanguages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so\r\nthat at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and\r\nGerman.\r\n\r\nIn strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé, Dantès spoke no\r\nmore of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no\r\nroom for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged\r\nhis word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring\r\nin any way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months, passed by\r\nunheeded in one rapid and instructive course. At the end of a year\r\nDantès was a new man. Dantès observed, however, that Faria, in spite of\r\nthe relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed\r\nincessantly to harass and distract his mind. Sometimes he would fall\r\ninto long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise,\r\nand, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon.\r\nOne day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Ah, if there were no sentinel!”\r\n\r\n“There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,” said Dantès,\r\nwho had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though\r\nhis brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n“I have already told you,” answered the abbé, “that I loathe the idea\r\nof shedding blood.”\r\n\r\n“And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a\r\nmeasure of self-preservation.”\r\n\r\n“No matter! I could never agree to it.”\r\n\r\n“Still, you have thought of it?”\r\n\r\n“Incessantly, alas!” cried the abbé.\r\n\r\n“And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you\r\nnot?” asked Dantès eagerly.\r\n\r\n“I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in\r\nthe gallery beyond us.”\r\n\r\n“He shall be both blind and deaf,” replied the young man, with an air\r\nof determination that made his companion shudder.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” cried the abbé; “impossible!”\r\n\r\nDantès endeavored to renew the subject; the abbé shook his head in\r\ntoken of disapproval, and refused to make any further response. Three\r\nmonths passed away.\r\n\r\n“Are you strong?” the abbé asked one day of Dantès. The young man, in\r\nreply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe, and\r\nthen as readily straightened it.\r\n\r\n“And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last\r\nresort?”\r\n\r\n“I promise on my honor.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said the abbé, “we may hope to put our design into execution.”\r\n\r\n“And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?”\r\n\r\n“At least a year.”\r\n\r\n“And shall we begin at once?”\r\n\r\n“At once.”\r\n\r\n“We have lost a year to no purpose!” cried Dantès.\r\n\r\n“Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?” asked the\r\nabbé.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me!” cried Edmond, blushing deeply.\r\n\r\n“Tut, tut!” answered the abbé, “man is but man after all, and you are\r\nabout the best specimen of the genus I have ever known. Come, let me\r\nshow you my plan.”\r\n\r\nThe abbé then showed Dantès the sketch he had made for their escape. It\r\nconsisted of a plan of his own cell and that of Dantès, with the\r\npassage which united them. In this passage he proposed to drive a level\r\nas they do in mines; this level would bring the two prisoners\r\nimmediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch; once\r\nthere, a large excavation would be made, and one of the flag-stones\r\nwith which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the\r\ndesired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier, who,\r\nstunned by his fall, would be immediately bound and gagged by Dantès\r\nbefore he had power to offer any resistance. The prisoners were then to\r\nmake their way through one of the gallery windows, and to let\r\nthemselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbé’s ladder of\r\ncords.\r\n\r\nDantès’ eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands with delight at\r\nthe idea of a plan so simple, yet apparently so certain to succeed.\r\nThat very day the miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity\r\nproportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of\r\nultimate success. Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except\r\nthe necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in\r\nanticipation of the turnkey’s visits. They had learned to distinguish\r\nthe almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards\r\ntheir dungeons, and happily, never failed of being prepared for his\r\ncoming. The fresh earth excavated during their present work, and which\r\nwould have entirely blocked up the old passage, was thrown, by degrees\r\nand with the utmost precaution, out of the window in either Faria’s or\r\nDantès’ cell, the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the\r\nnight wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to\r\nremain.\r\n\r\nMore than a year had been consumed in this undertaking, the only tools\r\nfor which had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; Faria still\r\ncontinuing to instruct Dantès by conversing with him, sometimes in one\r\nlanguage, sometimes in another; at others, relating to him the history\r\nof nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and\r\ntrodden the path of glory. The abbé was a man of the world, and had,\r\nmoreover, mixed in the first society of the day; he wore an air of\r\nmelancholy dignity which Dantès, thanks to the imitative powers\r\nbestowed on him by nature, easily acquired, as well as that outward\r\npolish and politeness he had before been wanting in, and which is\r\nseldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant\r\nintercourse with persons of high birth and breeding.\r\n\r\nAt the end of fifteen months the level was finished, and the excavation\r\ncompleted beneath the gallery, and the two workmen could distinctly\r\nhear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over\r\ntheir heads. Compelled, as they were, to await a night sufficiently\r\ndark to favor their flight, they were obliged to defer their final\r\nattempt till that auspicious moment should arrive; their greatest dread\r\nnow was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall\r\nshould give way before its right time, and this they had in some\r\nmeasure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they\r\nhad discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way.\r\nDantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard\r\nFaria, who had remained in Edmond’s cell for the purpose of cutting a\r\npeg to secure their rope-ladder, call to him in a tone indicative of\r\ngreat suffering. Dantès hastened to his dungeon, where he found him\r\nstanding in the middle of the room, pale as death, his forehead\r\nstreaming with perspiration, and his hands clenched tightly together.\r\n\r\n“Gracious heavens!” exclaimed Dantès, “what is the matter? what has\r\nhappened?”\r\n\r\n“Quick! quick!” returned the abbé, “listen to what I have to say.”\r\n\r\nDantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria,\r\nwhose eyes, already dull and sunken, were surrounded by purple circles,\r\nwhile his lips were white as those of a corpse, and his very hair\r\nseemed to stand on end.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?” cried Dantès, letting his\r\nchisel fall to the floor.\r\n\r\n“Alas,” faltered out the abbé, “all is over with me. I am seized with a\r\nterrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is fast\r\napproaching. I had a similar attack the year previous to my\r\nimprisonment. This malady admits but of one remedy; I will tell you\r\nwhat that is. Go into my cell as quickly as you can; draw out one of\r\nthe feet that support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out\r\nfor the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there\r\nhalf-filled with a red-looking fluid. Bring it to me—or rather—no,\r\nno!—I may be found here, therefore help me back to my room while I have\r\nthe strength to drag myself along. Who knows what may happen, or how\r\nlong the attack may last?”\r\n\r\nIn spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly\r\nfrustrated his hopes, Dantès did not lose his presence of mind, but\r\ndescended into the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with\r\nhim; then, half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the\r\nabbé’s chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed.\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” said the poor abbé, shivering as though his veins were filled\r\nwith ice. “I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it\r\ncomes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though\r\ndead, uttering neither sigh nor groan. On the other hand, the symptoms\r\nmay be much more violent, and cause me to fall into fearful\r\nconvulsions, foam at the mouth, and cry out loudly. Take care my cries\r\nare not heard, for if they are it is more than probable I should be\r\nremoved to another part of the prison, and we be separated forever.\r\nWhen I become quite motionless, cold, and rigid as a corpse, then, and\r\nnot before,—be careful about this,—force open my teeth with the knife,\r\npour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down\r\nmy throat, and I may perhaps revive.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps!” exclaimed Dantès in grief-stricken tones.\r\n\r\n“Help! help!” cried the abbé, “I—I—die—I——”\r\n\r\n0229m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was\r\nunable to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole\r\nframe, his eyes started from their sockets, his mouth was drawn on one\r\nside, his cheeks became purple, he struggled, foamed, dashed himself\r\nabout, and uttered the most dreadful cries, which, however, Dantès\r\nprevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket. The\r\nfit lasted two hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder\r\nand paler than marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled\r\nunder foot, he fell back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became\r\nas rigid as a corpse.\r\n\r\nEdmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then,\r\ntaking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed\r\njaws, carefully administered the appointed number of drops, and\r\nanxiously awaited the result. An hour passed away and the old man gave\r\nno sign of returning animation. Dantès began to fear he had delayed too\r\nlong ere he administered the remedy, and, thrusting his hands into his\r\nhair, continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend. At\r\nlength a slight color tinged the livid cheeks, consciousness returned\r\nto the dull, open eyeballs, a faint sigh issued from the lips, and the\r\nsufferer made a feeble effort to move.\r\n\r\n“He is saved! he is saved!” cried Dantès in a paroxysm of delight.\r\n\r\nThe sick man was not yet able to speak, but he pointed with evident\r\nanxiety towards the door. Dantès listened, and plainly distinguished\r\nthe approaching steps of the jailer. It was therefore near seven\r\no’clock; but Edmond’s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe young man sprang to the entrance, darted through it, carefully\r\ndrawing the stone over the opening, and hurried to his cell. He had\r\nscarcely done so before the door opened, and the jailer saw the\r\nprisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed. Almost before the key\r\nhad turned in the lock, and before the departing steps of the jailer\r\nhad died away in the long corridor he had to traverse, Dantès, whose\r\nrestless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the\r\nfood brought him, hurried back to the abbé’s chamber, and raising the\r\nstone by pressing his head against it, was soon beside the sick man’s\r\ncouch. Faria had now fully regained his consciousness, but he still lay\r\nhelpless and exhausted on his miserable bed.\r\n\r\n“I did not expect to see you again,” said he feebly, to Dantès.\r\n\r\n“And why not?” asked the young man. “Did you fancy yourself dying?”\r\n\r\n“No, I had no such idea; but, knowing that all was ready for flight, I\r\nthought you might have made your escape.”\r\n\r\nThe deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of Dantès.\r\n\r\n“Without you? Did you really think me capable of that?”\r\n\r\n“At least,” said the abbé, “I now see how wrong such an opinion would\r\nhave been. Alas, alas! I am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this\r\nattack.”\r\n\r\n“Be of good cheer,” replied Dantès; “your strength will return.” And as\r\nhe spoke he seated himself near the bed beside Faria, and took his\r\nhands. The abbé shook his head.\r\n\r\n“The last attack I had,” said he, “lasted but half an hour, and after\r\nit I was hungry, and got up without help; now I can move neither my\r\nright arm nor leg, and my head seems uncomfortable, which shows that\r\nthere has been a suffusion of blood on the brain. The third attack will\r\neither carry me off, or leave me paralyzed for life.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” cried Dantès; “you are mistaken—you will not die! And your\r\nthird attack (if, indeed, you should have another) will find you at\r\nliberty. We shall save you another time, as we have done this, only\r\nwith a better chance of success, because we shall be able to command\r\nevery requisite assistance.”\r\n\r\n“My good Edmond,” answered the abbé, “be not deceived. The attack which\r\nhas just passed away, condemns me forever to the walls of a prison.\r\nNone can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we will wait,—a week, a month, two months, if need be,—and\r\nmeanwhile your strength will return. Everything is in readiness for our\r\nflight, and we can select any time we choose. As soon as you feel able\r\nto swim we will go.”\r\n\r\n“I shall never swim again,” replied Faria. “This arm is paralyzed; not\r\nfor a time, but forever. Lift it, and judge if I am mistaken.”\r\n\r\nThe young man raised the arm, which fell back by its own weight,\r\nperfectly inanimate and helpless. A sigh escaped him.\r\n\r\n“You are convinced now, Edmond, are you not?” asked the abbé. “Depend\r\nupon it, I know what I say. Since the first attack I experienced of\r\nthis malady, I have continually reflected on it. Indeed, I expected it,\r\nfor it is a family inheritance; both my father and grandfather died of\r\nit in a third attack. The physician who prepared for me the remedy I\r\nhave twice successfully taken, was no other than the celebrated\r\nCabanis, and he predicted a similar end for me.”\r\n\r\n0233m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“The physician may be mistaken!” exclaimed Dantès. “And as for your\r\npoor arm, what difference will that make? I can take you on my\r\nshoulders, and swim for both of us.”\r\n\r\n“My son,” said the abbé, “you, who are a sailor and a swimmer, must\r\nknow as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done\r\nfifty strokes. Cease, then, to allow yourself to be duped by vain\r\nhopes, that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in. Here I\r\nshall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives, and that, in all\r\nhuman probability, will be the hour of my death. As for you, who are\r\nyoung and active, delay not on my account, but fly—go—I give you back\r\nyour promise.”\r\n\r\n“It is well,” said Dantès. “Then I shall also remain.” Then, rising and\r\nextending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man’s head, he\r\nslowly added, “By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while\r\nyou live.”\r\n\r\nFaria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled\r\nyoung friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the\r\nsincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” murmured the invalid, extending one hand. “I accept. You may\r\none of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion. But\r\nas I cannot, and you will not, quit this place, it becomes necessary to\r\nfill up the excavation beneath the soldier’s gallery; he might, by\r\nchance, hear the hollow sound of his footsteps, and call the attention\r\nof his officer to the circumstance. That would bring about a discovery\r\nwhich would inevitably lead to our being separated. Go, then, and set\r\nabout this work, in which, unhappily, I can offer you no assistance;\r\nkeep at it all night, if necessary, and do not return here tomorrow\r\ntill after the jailer has visited me. I shall have something of the\r\ngreatest importance to communicate to you.”\r\n\r\nDantès took the hand of the abbé in his, and affectionately pressed it.\r\nFaria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his\r\ntask, in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show\r\ntowards his aged friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 18. The Treasure\r\n\r\nWhen Dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in\r\ncaptivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of\r\nlight which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in\r\nhis left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the\r\nuse, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small\r\ncompass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He\r\ndid not speak, but showed the paper to Dantès.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Look at it,” said the abbé with a smile.\r\n\r\n“I have looked at it with all possible attention,” said Dantès, “and I\r\nonly see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters\r\ninscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.”\r\n\r\n“This paper, my friend,” said Faria, “I may now avow to you, since I\r\nhave the proof of your fidelity—this paper is my treasure, of which,\r\nfrom this day forth, one-half belongs to you.”\r\n\r\nThe sweat started forth on Dantès’ brow. Until this day and for how\r\nlong a time!—he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had\r\nbrought upon the abbé the accusation of madness. With his instinctive\r\ndelicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord,\r\nand Faria had been equally silent. He had taken the silence of the old\r\nman for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria,\r\nafter so painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into\r\nmental alienation.\r\n\r\n“Your treasure?” stammered Dantès. Faria smiled.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said he. “You have, indeed, a noble nature, Edmond, and I see by\r\nyour paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this\r\nmoment. No, be assured, I am not mad. This treasure exists, Dantès, and\r\nif I have not been allowed to possess it, you will. Yes—you. No one\r\nwould listen or believe me, because everyone thought me mad; but you,\r\nwho must know that I am not, listen to me, and believe me so afterwards\r\nif you will.”\r\n\r\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond to himself, “this is a terrible relapse! There\r\nwas only this blow wanting.” Then he said aloud, “My dear friend, your\r\nattack has, perhaps, fatigued you; had you not better repose awhile?\r\nTomorrow, if you will, I will hear your narrative; but today I wish to\r\nnurse you carefully. Besides,” he said, “a treasure is not a thing we\r\nneed hurry about.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, it is a matter of the utmost importance, Edmond!”\r\nreplied the old man. “Who knows if tomorrow, or the next day after, the\r\nthird attack may not come on? and then must not all be over? Yes,\r\nindeed, I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches, which\r\nwould make the wealth of a dozen families, will be forever lost to\r\nthose men who persecute me. This idea was one of vengeance to me, and I\r\ntasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my\r\ncaptivity. But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you; now\r\nthat I see you, young and with a promising future,—now that I think of\r\nall that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure, I\r\nshudder at any delay, and tremble lest I should not assure to one as\r\nworthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden\r\nwealth.”\r\n\r\nEdmond turned away his head with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“You persist in your incredulity, Edmond,” continued Faria. “My words\r\nhave not convinced you. I see you require proofs. Well, then, read this\r\npaper, which I have never shown to anyone.”\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow, my dear friend,” said Edmond, desirous of not yielding to\r\nthe old man’s madness. “I thought it was understood that we should not\r\ntalk of that until tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Then we will not talk of it until tomorrow; but read this paper\r\ntoday.”\r\n\r\n“I will not irritate him,” thought Edmond, and taking the paper, of\r\nwhich half was wanting,—having been burnt, no doubt, by some\r\naccident,—he read:\r\n\r\n“this treasure, which may amount to two...\r\n\r\nof Roman crowns in the most distant a...\r\n\r\nof the second opening wh...\r\n\r\ndeclare to belong to him alo...\r\n\r\nheir.\r\n\r\n                    “25th April, 149’”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well!” said Faria, when the young man had finished reading it.\r\n\r\n“Why,” replied Dantès, “I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected\r\nwords, which are rendered illegible by fire.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not for\r\nme, who have grown pale over them by many nights’ study, and have\r\nreconstructed every phrase, completed every thought.”\r\n\r\n“And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?”\r\n\r\n“I am sure I have, and you shall judge for yourself; but first listen\r\nto the history of this paper.”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” exclaimed Dantès. “Steps approach—I go—adieu!”\r\n\r\nAnd Dantès, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be\r\nsure to confirm his belief in his friend’s mental instability, glided\r\nlike a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his\r\nalarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with\r\nhis foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to\r\navoid discovery.\r\n\r\nIt was the governor, who, hearing of Faria’s illness from the jailer,\r\nhad come in person to see him.\r\n\r\nFaria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he\r\nmight conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half\r\nstricken him with death. His fear was lest the governor, touched with\r\npity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus\r\nseparate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the\r\ncase, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for\r\nwhom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a\r\nslight indisposition.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands,\r\ntried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first\r\nacquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so\r\nwonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so\r\nmuch wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria\r\ndeceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?\r\n\r\nDantès remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his\r\nfriend, thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced,\r\nonce for all, that the abbé was mad—such a conviction would be so\r\nterrible!\r\n\r\nBut, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had\r\ngone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get\r\nover the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard\r\nthe painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his\r\nleg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was\r\nobliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to\r\nenter by the small aperture which led to Dantès’ chamber.\r\n\r\n“Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,” he said with a benignant\r\nsmile. “You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain. Listen\r\nto me.”\r\n\r\nEdmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he\r\nseated himself on the stool beside him.\r\n\r\n“You know,” said the abbé, “that I was the secretary and intimate\r\nfriend of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe\r\nto this worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew. He was not rich,\r\nalthough the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb, and I\r\nheard the phrase very often, ‘As rich as a Spada.’ But he, like public\r\nrumor, lived on this reputation for wealth; his palace was my paradise.\r\nI was tutor to his nephews, who are dead; and when he was alone in the\r\nworld, I tried by absolute devotion to his will, to make up to him all\r\nhe had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness. The\r\ncardinal’s house had no secrets for me. I had often seen my noble\r\npatron annotating ancient volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty\r\nfamily manuscripts. One day when I was reproaching him for his\r\nunavailing searches, and deploring the prostration of mind that\r\nfollowed them, he looked at me, and, smiling bitterly, opened a volume\r\nrelating to the History of the City of Rome. There, in the twentieth\r\nchapter of the Life of Pope Alexander VI., were the following lines,\r\nwhich I can never forget:—\r\n\r\n“‘The great wars of Romagna had ended; Cæsar Borgia, who had completed\r\nhis conquest, had need of money to purchase all Italy. The pope had\r\nalso need of money to bring matters to an end with Louis XII. King of\r\nFrance, who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses; and\r\nit was necessary, therefore, to have recourse to some profitable\r\nscheme, which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished\r\ncondition of exhausted Italy. His holiness had an idea. He determined\r\nto make two cardinals.’\r\n\r\n“By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome, especially rich\r\nmen—_this_ was the return the Holy Father looked for. In the first\r\nplace, he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which\r\nthe cardinals already held; and then he had the two hats to sell\r\nbesides. There was a third point in view, which will appear hereafter.\r\n\r\n“The pope and Cæsar Borgia first found the two future cardinals; they\r\nwere Giovanni Rospigliosi, who held four of the highest dignities of\r\nthe Holy See, and Cæsar Spada, one of the noblest and richest of the\r\nRoman nobility; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope.\r\nThey were ambitious, and Cæsar Borgia soon found purchasers for their\r\nappointments. The result was, that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being\r\ncardinals, and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals\r\nheld before their elevation, and thus eight hundred thousand crowns\r\nentered into the coffers of the speculators.\r\n\r\n0239m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation. The\r\npope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada, conferred upon them\r\nthe insignia of the cardinalate, and induced them to arrange their\r\naffairs and take up their residence at Rome. Then the pope and Cæsar\r\nBorgia invited the two cardinals to dinner. This was a matter of\r\ndispute between the Holy Father and his son. Cæsar thought they could\r\nmake use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends,\r\nthat is to say, in the first place, the famous key which was given to\r\ncertain persons with the request that they go and open a designated\r\ncupboard. This key was furnished with a small iron point,—a negligence\r\non the part of the locksmith. When this was pressed to effect the\r\nopening of the cupboard, of which the lock was difficult, the person\r\nwas pricked by this small point, and died next day. Then there was the\r\nring with the lion’s head, which Cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his\r\nfriends with a clasp of the hand. The lion bit the hand thus favored,\r\nand at the end of twenty-four hours, the bite was mortal.\r\n\r\n“Cæsar proposed to his father, that they should either ask the\r\ncardinals to open the cupboard, or shake hands with them; but Alexander\r\nVI. replied: ‘Now as to the worthy cardinals, Spada and Rospigliosi,\r\nlet us ask both of them to dinner, something tells me that we shall get\r\nthat money back. Besides, you forget, Cæsar, an indigestion declares\r\nitself immediately, while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day\r\nor two.’ Cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning, and the cardinals\r\nwere consequently invited to dinner.\r\n\r\n“The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope, near San\r\nPierdarena, a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by\r\nreport. Rospigliosi, quite set up with his new dignities, went with a\r\ngood appetite and his most ingratiating manner. Spada, a prudent man,\r\nand greatly attached to his only nephew, a young captain of the highest\r\npromise, took paper and pen, and made his will. He then sent word to\r\nhis nephew to wait for him near the vineyard; but it appeared the\r\nservant did not find him.\r\n\r\n“Spada knew what these invitations meant; since Christianity, so\r\neminently civilizing, had made progress in Rome, it was no longer a\r\ncenturion who came from the tyrant with a message, ‘Cæsar wills that\r\nyou die.’ but it was a legate _à latere_, who came with a smile on his\r\nlips to say from the pope, ‘His holiness requests you to dine with\r\nhim.’\r\n\r\n“Spada set out about two o’clock to San Pierdarena. The pope awaited\r\nhim. The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his\r\nnephew, in full costume, and Cæsar Borgia paying him most marked\r\nattentions. Spada turned pale, as Cæsar looked at him with an ironical\r\nair, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was\r\nwell spread.\r\n\r\n“They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if\r\nhe had received his message. The nephew replied no; perfectly\r\ncomprehending the meaning of the question. It was too late, for he had\r\nalready drunk a glass of excellent wine, placed for him expressly by\r\nthe pope’s butler. Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach\r\nhim, which he was pressed to taste. An hour afterwards a physician\r\ndeclared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms. Spada died\r\non the threshold of the vineyard; the nephew expired at his own door,\r\nmaking signs which his wife could not comprehend.\r\n\r\n“Then Cæsar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage, under\r\npretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man. But the inheritance\r\nconsisted in this only, a scrap of paper on which Spada had written:—‘I\r\nbequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers, my books, and, amongst\r\nothers, my breviary with the gold corners, which I beg he will preserve\r\nin remembrance of his affectionate uncle.’\r\n\r\n“The heirs sought everywhere, admired the breviary, laid hands on the\r\nfurniture, and were greatly astonished that Spada, the rich man, was\r\nreally the most miserable of uncles—no treasures—unless they were those\r\nof science, contained in the library and laboratories. That was all.\r\nCæsar and his father searched, examined, scrutinized, but found\r\nnothing, or at least very little; not exceeding a few thousand crowns\r\nin plate, and about the same in ready money; but the nephew had time to\r\nsay to his wife before he expired: ‘Look well among my uncle’s papers;\r\nthere is a will.’\r\n\r\n“They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done, but\r\nit was fruitless. There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the\r\nPalatine Hill; but in these days landed property had not much value,\r\nand the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they\r\nwere beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son. Months and years\r\nrolled on. Alexander VI. died, poisoned,—you know by what mistake.\r\nCæsar, poisoned at the same time, escaped by shedding his skin like a\r\nsnake; but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a\r\ntiger’s. Then, compelled to quit Rome, he went and got himself\r\nobscurely killed in a night skirmish, scarcely noticed in history.\r\n\r\n“After the pope’s death and his son’s exile, it was supposed that the\r\nSpada family would resume the splendid position they had held before\r\nthe cardinal’s time; but this was not the case. The Spadas remained in\r\ndoubtful ease, a mystery hung over this dark affair, and the public\r\nrumor was, that Cæsar, a better politician than his father, had carried\r\noff from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals. I say the two,\r\nbecause Cardinal Rospigliosi, who had not taken any precaution, was\r\ncompletely despoiled.\r\n\r\n“Up to this point,” said Faria, interrupting the thread of his\r\nnarrative, “this seems to you very meaningless, no doubt, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my friend,” cried Dantès, “on the contrary, it seems as if I were\r\nreading a most interesting narrative; go on, I beg of you.”\r\n\r\n“I will. The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity. Years\r\nrolled on, and amongst the descendants some were soldiers, others\r\ndiplomatists; some churchmen, some bankers; some grew rich, and some\r\nwere ruined. I come now to the last of the family, whose secretary I\r\nwas—the Count of Spada. I had often heard him complain of the\r\ndisproportion of his rank with his fortune; and I advised him to invest\r\nall he had in an annuity. He did so, and thus doubled his income. The\r\ncelebrated breviary remained in the family, and was in the count’s\r\npossession. It had been handed down from father to son; for the\r\nsingular clause of the only will that had been found, had caused it to\r\nbe regarded as a genuine relic, preserved in the family with\r\nsuperstitious veneration. It was an illuminated book, with beautiful\r\nGothic characters, and so weighty with gold, that a servant always\r\ncarried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity.\r\n\r\n“At the sight of papers of all sorts,—titles, contracts, parchments,\r\nwhich were kept in the archives of the family, all descending from the\r\npoisoned cardinal, I in my turn examined the immense bundles of\r\ndocuments, like twenty servitors, stewards, secretaries before me; but\r\nin spite of the most exhaustive researches, I found—nothing. Yet I had\r\nread, I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family, for\r\nthe sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had\r\noccurred to them on the death of the Cardinal Cæsar Spada; but could\r\nonly trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi,\r\nhis companion in misfortune.\r\n\r\n“I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited\r\nthe Borgias nor the family, but had remained unpossessed like the\r\ntreasures of the Arabian Nights, which slept in the bosom of the earth\r\nunder the eyes of the genie. I searched, ransacked, counted, calculated\r\na thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the\r\nfamily for three hundred years. It was useless. I remained in my\r\nignorance, and the Count of Spada in his poverty.\r\n\r\n“My patron died. He had reserved from his annuity his family papers,\r\nhis library, composed of five thousand volumes, and his famous\r\nbreviary. All these he bequeathed to me, with a thousand Roman crowns,\r\nwhich he had in ready money, on condition that I would have anniversary\r\nmasses said for the repose of his soul, and that I would draw up a\r\ngenealogical tree and history of his house. All this I did\r\nscrupulously. Be easy, my dear Edmond, we are near the conclusion.\r\n\r\n“In 1807, a month before I was arrested, and a fortnight after the\r\ndeath of the Count of Spada, on the 25th of December (you will see\r\npresently how the date became fixed in my memory), I was reading, for\r\nthe thousandth time, the papers I was arranging, for the palace was\r\nsold to a stranger, and I was going to leave Rome and settle at\r\nFlorence, intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed,\r\nmy library, and the famous breviary, when, tired with my constant labor\r\nat the same thing, and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten, my head\r\ndropped on my hands, and I fell asleep about three o’clock in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n0243m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I awoke as the clock was striking six. I raised my head; I was in\r\nutter darkness. I rang for a light, but, as no one came, I determined\r\nto find one for myself. It was indeed but anticipating the simple\r\nmanners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting. I took\r\na wax-candle in one hand, and with the other groped about for a piece\r\nof paper (my match-box being empty), with which I proposed to get a\r\nlight from the small flame still playing on the embers. Fearing,\r\nhowever, to make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a\r\nmoment, then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which\r\nwas on the table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and\r\nwhich had served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request\r\nof the heirs. I felt for it, found it, twisted it up together, and\r\nputting it into the expiring flame, set light to it.\r\n\r\n“But beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire\r\nascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper. I grasped it\r\nin my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper\r\nin the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible\r\nemotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had\r\nbeen traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when\r\nexposed to the fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by\r\nthe flame. It was that paper you read this morning; read it again,\r\nDantès, and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and\r\nunconnected sense.”\r\n\r\nFaria, with an air of triumph, offered the paper to Dantès, who this\r\ntime read the following words, traced with an ink of a reddish color\r\nresembling rust:\r\n\r\n     “This 25th day of April, 1498, be...\r\n\r\n     Alexander VI., and fearing that not...\r\n\r\n     he may desire to become my heir, and re...\r\n\r\n     and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned,...\r\n\r\n     my sole heir, that I have bu...\r\n\r\n     and has visited with me, that is, in...\r\n\r\n     Island of Monte Cristo, all I poss...\r\n\r\n     jewels, diamonds, gems; that I alone...\r\n\r\n     may amount to nearly two mil...\r\n\r\n     will find on raising the twentieth ro...\r\n\r\n     creek to the east in a right line. Two open...\r\n\r\n     in these caves; the treasure is in the furthest a...\r\n\r\n     which treasure I bequeath and leave en...\r\n\r\n     as my sole heir.\r\n\r\n     “25th April, 1498.\r\n\r\n     “Cæs...\r\n\r\n\r\n“And now,” said the abbé, “read this other paper;” and he presented to\r\nDantès a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it, which\r\nEdmond read as follows:\r\n\r\n           “...ing invited to dine by his Holiness\r\n\r\n        ...content with making me pay for my hat,\r\n\r\n   ...serves for me the fate of Cardinals Caprara\r\n\r\n           ...I declare to my nephew, Guido Spada\r\n\r\n                      ...ried in a place he knows\r\n\r\n                        ...the caves of the small\r\n\r\n                 ...essed of ingots, gold, money,\r\n\r\n ...know of the existence of this treasure, which\r\n\r\n           ...lions of Roman crowns, and which he\r\n\r\n                             ...ck from the small\r\n\r\n                           ...ings have been made\r\n\r\n                           ...ngle in the second;\r\n\r\n                                   ...tire to him\r\n\r\n                                    ...ar † Spada.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFaria followed him with an excited look.\r\n\r\n“And now,” he said, when he saw that Dantès had read the last line,\r\n“put the two fragments together, and judge for yourself.” Dantès\r\nobeyed, and the conjointed pieces gave the following:\r\n\r\n0245m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“This 25th day of April, 1498, be...ing invited to dine by his Holiness\r\nAlexander VI., and fearing that not...content with making me pay for my\r\nhat, he may desire to become my heir, and re...serves for me the fate\r\nof Cardinals Caprara and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned,...I declare to\r\nmy nephew, Guido Spada, my sole heir, that I have bu...ried in a place\r\nhe knows and has visited with me, that is, in...the caves of the small\r\nIsland of Monte Cristo, all I poss...essed of ingots, gold, money,\r\njewels, diamonds, gems; that I alone...know of the existence of this\r\ntreasure, which may amount to nearly two mil...lions of Roman crowns,\r\nand which he will find on raising the twentieth ro...ck from the small\r\ncreek to the east in a right line. Two open...ings have been made in\r\nthese caves; the treasure is in the furthest a...ngle in the second;\r\nwhich treasure I bequeath and leave en...tire to him as my sole heir.\r\n“25th April, 1498. “Cæs...ar † Spada.”\r\n\r\n“Well, do you comprehend now?” inquired Faria.\r\n\r\n“It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada, and the will so long sought\r\nfor,” replied Edmond, still incredulous.\r\n\r\n“Yes; a thousand times, yes!”\r\n\r\n“And who completed it as it now is?”\r\n\r\n“I did. Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest; measuring\r\nthe length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden\r\nmeaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a\r\ncavern by the small ray of light above us.”\r\n\r\n“And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?”\r\n\r\n“I resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying\r\nwith me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian\r\nkingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period,\r\nquite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to\r\nhim, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my\r\nhasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having\r\naroused their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was\r\nleaving Piombino.\r\n\r\n“Now,” continued Faria, addressing Dantès with an almost paternal\r\nexpression, “now, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If\r\nwe ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here,\r\nand you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.”\r\n\r\n“But,” inquired Dantès hesitating, “has this treasure no more\r\nlegitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?”\r\n\r\n“No, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last Count\r\nof Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic\r\nbreviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind\r\nsatisfied on that point. If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy\r\nit without remorse.”\r\n\r\n“And you say this treasure amounts to——”\r\n\r\n“Two millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money.”2\r\n\r\n“Impossible!” said Dantès, staggered at the enormous amount.\r\n\r\n“Impossible? and why?” asked the old man. “The Spada family was one of\r\nthe oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in\r\nthose times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such\r\naccumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at\r\nthis day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly\r\na million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they\r\ncannot touch.”\r\n\r\nEdmond thought he was in a dream—he wavered between incredulity and\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n“I have only kept this secret so long from you,” continued Faria, “that\r\nI might test your character, and then surprise you. Had we escaped\r\nbefore my attack of catalepsy, I should have conducted you to Monte\r\nCristo; now,” he added, with a sigh, “it is you who will conduct me\r\nthither. Well, Dantès, you do not thank me?”\r\n\r\n“This treasure belongs to you, my dear friend,” replied Dantès, “and to\r\nyou only. I have no right to it. I am no relation of yours.”\r\n\r\n“You are my son, Dantès,” exclaimed the old man. “You are the child of\r\nmy captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God has sent you\r\nto me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a\r\nfather, and the prisoner who could not get free.”\r\n\r\nAnd Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to\r\nthe young man, who threw himself upon his neck and wept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 19. The Third Attack\r\n\r\nNow that this treasure, which had so long been the object of the abbé’s\r\nmeditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really\r\nloved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he\r\nexpatiated on the amount, explaining to Dantès all the good which, with\r\nthirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days\r\nto his friends; and then Dantès’ countenance became gloomy, for the\r\noath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected\r\nhow much ill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions\r\ncould do to his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dantès knew it,\r\nand had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa,\r\nbetween Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there.\r\nThis island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It\r\nis a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been\r\nthrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean.\r\nDantès drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès\r\nadvice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure. But\r\nDantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man.\r\nIt was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in\r\nwhich he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the\r\nsuspicion of his madness, increased Edmond’s admiration of him; but at\r\nthe same time Dantès could not believe that the deposit, supposing it\r\nhad ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure\r\nas by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.\r\n\r\nHowever, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last\r\nchance, and making them understand that they were condemned to\r\nperpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on\r\nthe sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had\r\nrepaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the\r\nhole Dantès had partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it\r\nwill be remembered, the abbé had made to Edmond, the misfortune would\r\nhave been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been\r\ndetected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a\r\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\r\nrealization of their hopes.\r\n\r\n“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\r\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\r\nwhat you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever\r\nwith you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure\r\nwill be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this\r\nprison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits\r\nme beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our\r\nliving together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is\r\nthe rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages\r\nyou have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with\r\nall their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you\r\nhave made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of\r\nthem, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced\r\nthem—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have\r\nmade me rich and happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better\r\nfor me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as\r\nproblematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the\r\nsea, which we take for _terra firma_, and which evaporate and vanish as\r\nwe draw near to them. To have you as long as possible near me, to hear\r\nyour eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul,\r\nand makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I\r\nshould ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to\r\nwhich I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no\r\nlonger any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical,\r\nbut actual. I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the\r\nsovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive\r\nme of this.”\r\n\r\nThus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed\r\ntogether went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence\r\nas to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied\r\nwould be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left\r\nleg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was\r\ncontinually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion,\r\nand anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might\r\nbe some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart;\r\nand Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed\r\nthe second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would\r\nbe able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed\r\nwhile Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were\r\nto serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and\r\nhour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought,\r\nwhich was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone\r\nunder some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to\r\nendeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed\r\nspot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in\r\nthe second opening.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.\r\nFaria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand\r\nand foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had\r\ngradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\r\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\r\nlearns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually\r\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\r\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\r\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for\r\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\r\nactivities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of\r\nProvidence.\r\n\r\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young\r\nman, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many\r\nstifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when\r\nEdmond returned to his cell.\r\n\r\nOne night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone\r\ncalling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or\r\nrather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached\r\nhim. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.\r\nUndoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.\r\n\r\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\r\n\r\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\r\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the\r\nlight of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken,\r\nDantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.\r\nHis features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he\r\nalready knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them\r\nfor the first time.\r\n\r\n“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand,\r\ndo you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\r\n\r\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed\r\ntowards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\r\n\r\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.\r\n\r\n“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my\r\ndear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your\r\nflight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done\r\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew\r\nwe had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear\r\nEdmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;\r\nsome other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you\r\nwill appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young,\r\nstrong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape,\r\nwhile I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead\r\nbody tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence\r\nhas done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,\r\nand it was time I should die.”\r\n\r\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my\r\nfriend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,\r\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\r\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have\r\nsaved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the\r\nfoot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the\r\nred liquor.\r\n\r\n“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.\r\nQuick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh\r\ninstructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.”\r\n\r\n“There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter;\r\nGod wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so\r\nprofoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to\r\npreserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet\r\nalways so dear.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will save you\r\nyet.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing\r\ntowards my brain. These horrible chills, which make my teeth chatter\r\nand seem to dislocate my bones, begin to pervade my whole frame; in\r\nfive minutes the malady will reach its height, and in a quarter of an\r\nhour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” exclaimed Dantès, his heart wrung with anguish.\r\n\r\n“Do as you did before, only do not wait so long, all the springs of\r\nlife are now exhausted in me, and death,” he continued, looking at his\r\nparalyzed arm and leg, “has but half its work to do. If, after having\r\nmade me swallow twelve drops instead of ten, you see that I do not\r\nrecover, then pour the rest down my throat. Now lift me on my bed, for\r\nI can no longer support myself.”\r\n\r\nEdmond took the old man in his arms, and laid him on the bed.\r\n\r\n“And now, my dear friend,” said Faria, “sole consolation of my wretched\r\nexistence,—you whom Heaven gave me somewhat late, but still gave me, a\r\npriceless gift, and for which I am most grateful,—at the moment of\r\nseparating from you forever, I wish you all the happiness and all the\r\nprosperity you so well deserve. My son, I bless thee!”\r\n\r\nThe young man cast himself on his knees, leaning his head against the\r\nold man’s bed.\r\n\r\n“Listen, now, to what I say in this my dying moment. The treasure of\r\nthe Spadas exists. God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by\r\ntime or space. I see it in the depths of the inner cavern. My eyes\r\npierce the inmost recesses of the earth, and are dazzled at the sight\r\nof so much riches. If you do escape, remember that the poor abbé, whom\r\nall the world called mad, was not so. Hasten to Monte Cristo—avail\r\nyourself of the fortune—for you have indeed suffered long enough.”\r\n\r\nA violent convulsion attacked the old man. Dantès raised his head and\r\nsaw Faria’s eyes injected with blood. It seemed as if a flow of blood\r\nhad ascended from the chest to the head.\r\n\r\n“Adieu, adieu!” murmured the old man, clasping Edmond’s hand\r\nconvulsively—“adieu!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,—no, not yet,” he cried; “do not forsake me! Oh, succor him!\r\nHelp—help—help!”\r\n\r\n“Hush! hush!” murmured the dying man, “that they may not separate us if\r\nyou save me!”\r\n\r\n“You are right. Oh, yes, yes; be assured I shall save you! Besides,\r\nalthough you suffer much, you do not seem to be in such agony as you\r\nwere before.”\r\n\r\n“Do not mistake! I suffer less because there is in me less strength to\r\nendure. At your age we have faith in life; it is the privilege of youth\r\nto believe and hope, but old men see death more clearly. Oh, ’tis\r\nhere—’tis here—’tis over—my sight is gone—my senses fail! Your hand,\r\nDantès! Adieu! adieu!”\r\n\r\nAnd raising himself by a final effort, in which he summoned all his\r\nfaculties, he said,—“Monte Cristo, forget not Monte Cristo!” And he\r\nfell back on the bed.\r\n\r\nThe crisis was terrible, and a rigid form with twisted limbs, swollen\r\neyelids, and lips flecked with bloody foam, lay on the bed of torture,\r\nin place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there.\r\n\r\nDantès took the lamp, placed it on a projecting stone above the bed,\r\nwhence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the\r\ndistorted countenance and motionless, stiffened body. With steady gaze\r\nhe awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative.\r\n\r\nWhen he believed that the right moment had arrived, he took the knife,\r\npried open the teeth, which offered less resistance than before,\r\ncounted one after the other twelve drops, and watched; the phial\r\ncontained, perhaps, twice as much more. He waited ten minutes, a\r\nquarter of an hour, half an hour,—no change took place. Trembling, his\r\nhair erect, his brow bathed with perspiration, he counted the seconds\r\nby the beating of his heart. Then he thought it was time to make the\r\nlast trial, and he put the phial to the purple lips of Faria, and\r\nwithout having occasion to force open his jaws, which had remained\r\nextended, he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat.\r\n\r\n0255m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe draught produced a galvanic effect, a violent trembling pervaded\r\nthe old man’s limbs, his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon\r\nthem, he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek, and then his convulsed\r\nbody returned gradually to its former immobility, the eyes remaining\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour, an hour, an hour and a half elapsed, and during this\r\nperiod of anguish, Edmond leaned over his friend, his hand applied to\r\nhis heart, and felt the body gradually grow cold, and the heart’s\r\npulsation become more and more deep and dull, until at length it\r\nstopped; the last movement of the heart ceased, the face became livid,\r\nthe eyes remained open, but the eyeballs were glazed.\r\n\r\nIt was six o’clock in the morning, the dawn was just breaking, and its\r\nfeeble ray came into the dungeon, and paled the ineffectual light of\r\nthe lamp. Strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man,\r\nand at times gave it the appearance of life. While the struggle between\r\nday and night lasted, Dantès still doubted; but as soon as the daylight\r\ngained the pre-eminence, he saw that he was alone with a corpse. Then\r\nan invincible and extreme terror seized upon him, and he dared not\r\nagain press the hand that hung out of bed, he dared no longer to gaze\r\non those fixed and vacant eyes, which he tried many times to close, but\r\nin vain—they opened again as soon as shut. He extinguished the lamp,\r\ncarefully concealed it, and then went away, closing as well as he could\r\nthe entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended.\r\n\r\nIt was time, for the jailer was coming. On this occasion he began his\r\nrounds at Dantès’ cell, and on leaving him he went on to Faria’s\r\ndungeon, taking thither breakfast and some linen. Nothing betokened\r\nthat the man knew anything of what had occurred. He went on his way.\r\n\r\nDantès was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was\r\ngoing on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend. He therefore\r\nreturned by the subterraneous gallery, and arrived in time to hear the\r\nexclamations of the turnkey, who called out for help. Other turnkeys\r\ncame, and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers. Last of all\r\ncame the governor.\r\n\r\nEdmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse, heard\r\nthe voice of the governor, who asked them to throw water on the dead\r\nman’s face; and seeing that, in spite of this application, the prisoner\r\ndid not recover, they sent for the doctor. The governor then went out,\r\nand words of pity fell on Dantès’ listening ears, mingled with brutal\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said one, “the madman has gone to look after his\r\ntreasure. Good journey to him!”\r\n\r\n“With all his millions, he will not have enough to pay for his shroud!”\r\nsaid another.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” added a third voice, “the shrouds of the Château d’If are not\r\ndear!”\r\n\r\n0257m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said one of the previous speakers, “as he was a churchman,\r\nthey may go to some expense in his behalf.”\r\n\r\n“They may give him the honors of the sack.”\r\n\r\nEdmond did not lose a word, but comprehended very little of what was\r\nsaid. The voices soon ceased, and it seemed to him as if everyone had\r\nleft the cell. Still he dared not to enter, as they might have left\r\nsome turnkey to watch the dead. He remained, therefore, mute and\r\nmotionless, hardly venturing to breathe. At the end of an hour, he\r\nheard a faint noise, which increased. It was the governor who returned,\r\nfollowed by the doctor and other attendants. There was a moment’s\r\nsilence,—it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body.\r\nThe inquiries soon commenced.\r\n\r\nThe doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner\r\nhad succumbed, and declared that he was dead. Questions and answers\r\nfollowed in a nonchalant manner that made Dantès indignant, for he felt\r\nthat all the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect\r\nequal to his own.\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry for what you tell me,” said the governor, replying to\r\nthe assurance of the doctor, “that the old man is really dead; for he\r\nwas a quiet, inoffensive prisoner, happy in his folly, and required no\r\nwatching.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” added the turnkey, “there was no occasion for watching him; he\r\nwould have stayed here fifty years, I’ll answer for it, without any\r\nattempt to escape.”\r\n\r\n“Still,” said the governor, “I believe it will be requisite,\r\nnotwithstanding your certainty, and not that I doubt your science, but\r\nin discharge of my official duty, that we should be perfectly assured\r\nthat the prisoner is dead.”\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of complete silence, during which Dantès, still\r\nlistening, knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time.\r\n\r\n“You may make your mind easy,” said the doctor; “he is dead. I will\r\nanswer for that.”\r\n\r\n“You know, sir,” said the governor, persisting, “that we are not\r\ncontent in such cases as this with such a simple examination. In spite\r\nof all appearances, be so kind, therefore, as to finish your duty by\r\nfulfilling the formalities described by law.”\r\n\r\n“Let the irons be heated,” said the doctor; “but really it is a useless\r\nprecaution.”\r\n\r\nThis order to heat the irons made Dantès shudder. He heard hasty steps,\r\nthe creaking of a door, people going and coming, and some minutes\r\nafterwards a turnkey entered, saying:\r\n\r\n“Here is the brazier, lighted.”\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s silence, and then was heard the crackling of\r\nburning flesh, of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even\r\nbehind the wall where Dantès was listening in horror. The perspiration\r\npoured forth upon the young man’s brow, and he felt as if he should\r\nfaint.\r\n\r\n“You see, sir, he is really dead,” said the doctor; “this burn in the\r\nheel is decisive. The poor fool is cured of his folly, and delivered\r\nfrom his captivity.”\r\n\r\n“Wasn’t his name Faria?” inquired one of the officers who accompanied\r\nthe governor.\r\n\r\n0259m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; and, as he said, it was an ancient name. He was, too, very\r\nlearned, and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his\r\ntreasure; but on that, indeed, he was intractable.”\r\n\r\n“It is the sort of malady which we call monomania,” said the doctor.\r\n\r\n“You had never anything to complain of?” said the governor to the\r\njailer who had charge of the abbé.\r\n\r\n“Never, sir,” replied the jailer, “never; on the contrary, he sometimes\r\namused me very much by telling me stories. One day, too, when my wife\r\nwas ill, he gave me a prescription which cured her.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, ah!” said the doctor, “I did not know that I had a rival; but I\r\nhope, governor, that you will show him all proper respect in\r\nconsequence.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, make your mind easy, he shall be decently interred in the\r\nnewest sack we can find. Will that satisfy you?”\r\n\r\n“Must this last formality take place in your presence, sir?” inquired a\r\nturnkey.\r\n\r\n“Certainly. But make haste—I cannot stay here all day.” Other\r\nfootsteps, going and coming, were now heard, and a moment afterwards\r\nthe noise of rustling canvas reached Dantès’ ears, the bed creaked, and\r\nthe heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor;\r\nthen the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it.\r\n\r\n“This evening,” said the governor.\r\n\r\n“Will there be any mass?” asked one of the attendants.\r\n\r\n“That is impossible,” replied the governor. “The chaplain of the\r\nchâteau came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence, in order to\r\ntake a trip to Hyères for a week. I told him I would attend to the\r\nprisoners in his absence. If the poor abbé had not been in such a\r\nhurry, he might have had his requiem.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh, pooh;” said the doctor, with the impiety usual in persons of his\r\nprofession; “he is a churchman. God will respect his profession, and\r\nnot give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest.” A shout\r\nof laughter followed this brutal jest. Meanwhile the operation of\r\nputting the body in the sack was going on.\r\n\r\n“This evening,” said the governor, when the task was ended.\r\n\r\n“At what hour?” inquired a turnkey.\r\n\r\n“Why, about ten or eleven o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we watch by the corpse?”\r\n\r\n“Of what use would it be? Shut the dungeon as if he were alive—that is\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nThen the steps retreated, and the voices died away in the distance; the\r\nnoise of the door, with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased, and a\r\nsilence more sombre than that of solitude ensued,—the silence of death,\r\nwhich was all-pervasive, and struck its icy chill to the very soul of\r\nDantès.\r\n\r\nThen he raised the flag-stone cautiously with his head, and looked\r\ncarefully around the chamber. It was empty, and Dantès emerged from the\r\ntunnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 20. The Cemetery of the Château d’If\r\n\r\nOn the bed, at full length, and faintly illuminated by the pale light\r\nthat came from the window, lay a sack of canvas, and under its rude\r\nfolds was stretched a long and stiffened form; it was Faria’s last\r\nwinding-sheet,—a winding-sheet which, as the turnkey said, cost so\r\nlittle. Everything was in readiness. A barrier had been placed between\r\nDantès and his old friend. No longer could Edmond look into those\r\nwide-open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of\r\ndeath; no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make\r\nhis existence blessed. Faria, the beneficent and cheerful companion,\r\nwith whom he was accustomed to live so intimately, no longer breathed.\r\nHe seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed, and fell into\r\nmelancholy and gloomy reverie.\r\n\r\nAlone! he was alone again! again condemned to silence—again face to\r\nface with nothingness! Alone!—never again to see the face, never again\r\nto hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth! Was\r\nnot Faria’s fate the better, after all—to solve the problem of life at\r\nits source, even at the risk of horrible suffering?\r\n\r\nThe idea of suicide, which his friend had driven away and kept away by\r\nhis cheerful presence, now hovered like a phantom over the abbé’s dead\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n“If I could die,” he said, “I should go where he goes, and should\r\nassuredly find him again. But how to die? It is very easy,” he went on\r\nwith a smile; “I will remain here, rush on the first person that opens\r\nthe door, strangle him, and then they will guillotine me.”\r\n\r\nBut excessive grief is like a storm at sea, where the frail bark is\r\ntossed from the depths to the top of the wave. Dantès recoiled from the\r\nidea of so infamous a death, and passed suddenly from despair to an\r\nardent desire for life and liberty.\r\n\r\n“Die? oh, no,” he exclaimed—“not die now, after having lived and\r\nsuffered so long and so much! Die? yes, had I died years ago; but now\r\nto die would be, indeed, to give way to the sarcasm of destiny. No, I\r\nwant to live; I shall struggle to the very last; I will yet win back\r\nthe happiness of which I have been deprived. Before I die I must not\r\nforget that I have my executioners to punish, and perhaps, too, who\r\nknows, some friends to reward. Yet they will forget me here, and I\r\nshall die in my dungeon like Faria.”\r\n\r\nAs he said this, he became silent and gazed straight before him like\r\none overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought. Suddenly he arose,\r\nlifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy, paced twice or\r\nthrice round the dungeon, and then paused abruptly by the bed.\r\n\r\n“Just God!” he muttered, “whence comes this thought? Is it from thee?\r\nSince none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon, let me take the\r\nplace of the dead!”\r\n\r\nWithout giving himself time to reconsider his decision, and, indeed,\r\nthat he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his\r\ndesperate resolution, he bent over the appalling shroud, opened it with\r\nthe knife which Faria had made, drew the corpse from the sack, and bore\r\nit along the tunnel to his own chamber, laid it on his couch, tied\r\naround its head the rag he wore at night around his own, covered it\r\nwith his counterpane, once again kissed the ice-cold brow, and tried\r\nvainly to close the resisting eyes, which glared horribly, turned the\r\nhead towards the wall, so that the jailer might, when he brought the\r\nevening meal, believe that he was asleep, as was his frequent custom;\r\nentered the tunnel again, drew the bed against the wall, returned to\r\nthe other cell, took from the hiding-place the needle and thread, flung\r\noff his rags, that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse\r\ncanvas, and getting inside the sack, placed himself in the posture in\r\nwhich the dead body had been laid, and sewed up the mouth of the sack\r\nfrom the inside.\r\n\r\nHe would have been discovered by the beating of his heart, if by any\r\nmischance the jailers had entered at that moment. Dantès might have\r\nwaited until the evening visit was over, but he was afraid that the\r\ngovernor would change his mind, and order the dead body to be removed\r\nearlier. In that case his last hope would have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nNow his plans were fully made, and this is what he intended to do. If\r\nwhile he was being carried out the grave-diggers should discover that\r\nthey were bearing a live instead of a dead body, Dantès did not intend\r\nto give them time to recognize him, but with a sudden cut of the knife,\r\nhe meant to open the sack from top to bottom, and, profiting by their\r\nalarm, escape; if they tried to catch him, he would use his knife to\r\nbetter purpose.\r\n\r\n0263m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave, he would\r\nallow himself to be covered with earth, and then, as it was night, the\r\ngrave-diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would\r\nhave worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped. He hoped\r\nthat the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not\r\novercome it. If he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy,\r\nhe would be stifled, and then—so much the better, all would be over.\r\n\r\nDantès had not eaten since the preceding evening, but he had not\r\nthought of hunger, nor did he think of it now. His situation was too\r\nprecarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one.\r\n\r\nThe first risk that Dantès ran was, that the jailer, when he brought\r\nhim his supper at seven o’clock, might perceive the change that had\r\nbeen made; fortunately, twenty times at least, from misanthropy or\r\nfatigue, Dantès had received his jailer in bed, and then the man placed\r\nhis bread and soup on the table, and went away without saying a word.\r\nThis time the jailer might not be as silent as usual, but speak to\r\nDantès, and seeing that he received no reply, go to the bed, and thus\r\ndiscover all.\r\n\r\nWhen seven o’clock came, Dantès’ agony really began. His hand placed\r\nupon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings, while, with the\r\nother he wiped the perspiration from his temples. From time to time\r\nchills ran through his whole body, and clutched his heart in a grasp of\r\nice. Then he thought he was going to die. Yet the hours passed on\r\nwithout any unusual disturbance, and Dantès knew that he had escaped\r\nthe first peril. It was a good augury.\r\n\r\nAt length, about the hour the governor had appointed, footsteps were\r\nheard on the stairs. Edmond felt that the moment had arrived, summoned\r\nup all his courage, held his breath, and would have been happy if at\r\nthe same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins. The\r\nfootsteps—they were double—paused at the door—and Dantès guessed that\r\nthe two grave-diggers had come to seek him—this idea was soon converted\r\ninto certainty, when he heard the noise they made in putting down the\r\nhand-bier.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and a dim light reached Dantès’ eyes through the\r\ncoarse sack that covered him; he saw two shadows approach his bed, a\r\nthird remaining at the door with a torch in its hand. The two men,\r\napproaching the ends of the bed, took the sack by its extremities.\r\n\r\n“He’s heavy, though, for an old and thin man,” said one, as he raised\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\n“They say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones,”\r\nsaid another, lifting the feet.\r\n\r\n“Have you tied the knot?” inquired the first speaker.\r\n\r\n“What would be the use of carrying so much more weight?” was the reply,\r\n“I can do that when we get there.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you’re right,” replied the companion.\r\n\r\n“What’s the knot for?” thought Dantès.\r\n\r\nThey deposited the supposed corpse on the bier. Edmond stiffened\r\nhimself in order to play the part of a dead man, and then the party,\r\nlighted by the man with the torch, who went first, ascended the stairs.\r\nSuddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air, and Dantès knew that\r\nthe mistral was blowing. It was a sensation in which pleasure and pain\r\nwere strangely mingled.\r\n\r\nThe bearers went on for twenty paces, then stopped, putting the bier\r\ndown on the ground. One of them went away, and Dantès heard his shoes\r\nstriking on the pavement.\r\n\r\n“Where am I?” he asked himself.\r\n\r\n“Really, he is by no means a light load!” said the other bearer,\r\nsitting on the edge of the hand-barrow.\r\n\r\nDantès’ first impulse was to escape, but fortunately he did not attempt\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Give us a light,” said the other bearer, “or I shall never find what I\r\nam looking for.”\r\n\r\nThe man with the torch complied, although not asked in the most polite\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n“What can he be looking for?” thought Edmond. “The spade, perhaps.”\r\n\r\nAn exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave-digger had\r\nfound the object of his search. “Here it is at last,” he said, “not\r\nwithout some trouble, though.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” was the answer, “but it has lost nothing by waiting.”\r\n\r\nAs he said this, the man came towards Edmond, who heard a heavy\r\nmetallic substance laid down beside him, and at the same moment a cord\r\nwas fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence.\r\n\r\n“Well, have you tied the knot?” inquired the grave-digger, who was\r\nlooking on.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and pretty tight too, I can tell you,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“Move on, then.” And the bier was lifted once more, and they proceeded.\r\n\r\nThey advanced fifty paces farther, and then stopped to open a door,\r\nthen went forward again. The noise of the waves dashing against the\r\nrocks on which the château is built, reached Dantès’ ear distinctly as\r\nthey went forward.\r\n\r\n“Bad weather!” observed one of the bearers; “not a pleasant night for a\r\ndip in the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, the abbé runs a chance of being wet,” said the other; and\r\nthen there was a burst of brutal laughter.\r\n\r\nDantès did not comprehend the jest, but his hair stood erect on his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“Well, here we are at last,” said one of them.\r\n\r\n“A little farther—a little farther,” said the other. “You know very\r\nwell that the last was stopped on his way, dashed on the rocks, and the\r\ngovernor told us next day that we were careless fellows.”\r\n\r\nThey ascended five or six more steps, and then Dantès felt that they\r\ntook him, one by the head and the other by the heels, and swung him to\r\nand fro.\r\n\r\n“One!” said the grave-diggers, “two! three!”\r\n\r\nAnd at the same instant Dantès felt himself flung into the air like a\r\nwounded bird, falling, falling, with a rapidity that made his blood\r\ncurdle. Although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his\r\nrapid descent, it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century. At\r\nlast, with a horrible splash, he darted like an arrow into the ice-cold\r\nwater, and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry, stifled in a moment by\r\nhis immersion beneath the waves.\r\n\r\nDantès had been flung into the sea, and was dragged into its depths by\r\na thirty-six-pound shot tied to his feet.\r\n\r\nThe sea is the cemetery of the Château d’If.\r\n\r\n0267m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen\r\n\r\nDantès, although stunned and almost suffocated, had sufficient presence\r\nof mind to hold his breath, and as his right hand (prepared as he was\r\nfor every chance) held his knife open, he rapidly ripped up the sack,\r\nextricated his arm, and then his body; but in spite of all his efforts\r\nto free himself from the shot, he felt it dragging him down still\r\nlower. He then bent his body, and by a desperate effort severed the\r\ncord that bound his legs, at the moment when it seemed as if he were\r\nactually strangled. With a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the\r\nsea, while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so\r\nnearly become his shroud.\r\n\r\nDantès waited only to get breath, and then dived, in order to avoid\r\nbeing seen. When he arose a second time, he was fifty paces from where\r\nhe had first sunk. He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky, across\r\nwhich the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a\r\ntwinkling star to appear; before him was the vast expanse of waters,\r\nsombre and terrible, whose waves foamed and roared as if before the\r\napproach of a storm. Behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the\r\nsky, rose phantom-like the vast stone structure, whose projecting crags\r\nseemed like arms extended to seize their prey, and on the highest rock\r\nwas a torch lighting two figures.\r\n\r\nHe fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea; doubtless\r\nthese strange grave-diggers had heard his cry. Dantès dived again, and\r\nremained a long time beneath the water. This was an easy feat to him,\r\nfor he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the\r\nlighthouse at Marseilles when he swam there, and was unanimously\r\ndeclared to be the best swimmer in the port. When he came up again the\r\nlight had disappeared.\r\n\r\nHe must now get his bearings. Ratonneau and Pomègue are the nearest\r\nislands of all those that surround the Château d’If, but Ratonneau and\r\nPomègue are inhabited, as is also the islet of Daume. Tiboulen and\r\nLemaire were therefore the safest for Dantès’ venture. The islands of\r\nTiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Château d’If; Dantès,\r\nnevertheless, determined to make for them. But how could he find his\r\nway in the darkness of the night?\r\n\r\nAt this moment he saw the light of Planier, gleaming in front of him\r\nlike a star. By leaving this light on the right, he kept the Island of\r\nTiboulen a little on the left; by turning to the left, therefore, he\r\nwould find it. But, as we have said, it was at least a league from the\r\nChâteau d’If to this island. Often in prison Faria had said to him,\r\nwhen he saw him idle and inactive:\r\n\r\n“Dantès, you must not give way to this listlessness; you will be\r\ndrowned if you seek to escape, and your strength has not been properly\r\nexercised and prepared for exertion.”\r\n\r\nThese words rang in Dantès’ ears, even beneath the waves; he hastened\r\nto cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength.\r\nHe found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his\r\npower, and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he\r\nhad so often sported as a boy.\r\n\r\nFear, that relentless pursuer, clogged Dantès’ efforts. He listened for\r\nany sound that might be audible, and every time that he rose to the top\r\nof a wave he scanned the horizon, and strove to penetrate the darkness.\r\nHe fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat, and he\r\nredoubled his exertions, increasing rapidly his distance from the\r\nchâteau, but exhausting his strength. He swam on still, and already the\r\nterrible château had disappeared in the darkness. He could not see it,\r\nbut he _felt_ its presence.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed, during which Dantès, excited by the feeling of freedom,\r\ncontinued to cleave the waves.\r\n\r\n“Let us see,” said he, “I have swum above an hour, but as the wind is\r\nagainst me, that has retarded my speed; however, if I am not mistaken,\r\nI must be close to Tiboulen. But what if I were mistaken?”\r\n\r\nA shudder passed over him. He sought to tread water, in order to rest\r\nhimself; but the sea was too violent, and he felt that he could not\r\nmake use of this means of recuperation.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “I will swim on until I am worn out, or the cramp\r\nseizes me, and then I shall sink;” and he struck out with the energy of\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense,\r\nand heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him; at the same time he\r\nfelt a sharp pain in his knee. He fancied for a moment that he had been\r\nshot, and listened for the report; but he heard nothing. Then he put\r\nout his hand, and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew\r\nthat he had gained the shore.\r\n\r\nBefore him rose a grotesque mass of rocks, that resembled nothing so\r\nmuch as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent\r\ncombustion. It was the Island of Tiboulen. Dantès rose, advanced a few\r\nsteps, and, with a fervent prayer of gratitude, stretched himself on\r\nthe granite, which seemed to him softer than down. Then, in spite of\r\nthe wind and rain, he fell into the deep, sweet sleep of utter\r\nexhaustion. At the expiration of an hour Edmond was awakened by the\r\nroar of thunder. The tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere\r\nwith its mighty wings; from time to time a flash of lightning stretched\r\nacross the heavens like a fiery serpent, lighting up the clouds that\r\nrolled on in vast chaotic waves.\r\n\r\nDantès had not been deceived—he had reached the first of the two\r\nislands, which was, in fact, Tiboulen. He knew that it was barren and\r\nwithout shelter; but when the sea became more calm, he resolved to\r\nplunge into its waves again, and swim to Lemaire, equally arid, but\r\nlarger, and consequently better adapted for concealment.\r\n\r\nAn overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter, and scarcely had\r\nhe availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury.\r\nEdmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay; the waves,\r\ndashing themselves against it, wetted him with their spray. He was\r\nsafely sheltered, and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of\r\nthe elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning. It seemed to\r\nhim that the island trembled to its base, and that it would, like a\r\nvessel at anchor, break moorings, and bear him off into the centre of\r\nthe storm.\r\n\r\nHe then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four-and-twenty\r\nhours. He extended his hands, and drank greedily of the rainwater that\r\nhad lodged in a hollow of the rock.\r\n\r\nAs he rose, a flash of lightning, that seemed to rive the remotest\r\nheights of heaven, illumined the darkness. By its light, between the\r\nIsland of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle, a quarter of a league distant,\r\nDantès saw a fishing-boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the\r\npower of winds and waves. A second after, he saw it again, approaching\r\nwith frightful rapidity. Dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn\r\nthem of their danger, but they saw it themselves. Another flash showed\r\nhim four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging, while a\r\nfifth clung to the broken rudder. The men he beheld saw him\r\nundoubtedly, for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind.\r\nAbove the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving; suddenly\r\nthe ropes that still held it gave way, and it disappeared in the\r\ndarkness of the night like a vast sea-bird.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment a violent crash was heard, and cries of distress.\r\nDantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel, and among the\r\nfragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors. Then all was dark\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nDantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to\r\npieces; he listened, he groped about, but he heard and saw nothing—the\r\ncries had ceased, and the tempest continued to rage. By degrees the\r\nwind abated, vast gray clouds rolled towards the west, and the blue\r\nfirmament appeared studded with bright stars. Soon a red streak became\r\nvisible in the horizon, the waves whitened, a light played over them,\r\nand gilded their foaming crests with gold. It was day.\r\n\r\nDantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle, as if\r\nhe now beheld it for the first time; and indeed since his captivity in\r\nthe Château d’If he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be\r\nwitnessed. He turned towards the fortress, and looked at both sea and\r\nland. The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with\r\nimposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene. It was about five\r\no’clock. The sea continued to get calmer.\r\n\r\n“In two or three hours,” thought Dantès, “the turnkey will enter my\r\nchamber, find the body of my poor friend, recognize it, seek for me in\r\nvain, and give the alarm. Then the tunnel will be discovered; the men\r\nwho cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered,\r\nwill be questioned. Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue\r\nthe wretched fugitive. The cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter\r\nto a man wandering about naked and famished. The police of Marseilles\r\nwill be on the alert by land, whilst the governor pursues me by sea. I\r\nam cold, I am hungry. I have lost even the knife that saved me. Oh, my\r\nGod, I have suffered enough surely! Have pity on me, and do for me what\r\nI am unable to do for myself.”\r\n\r\nAs Dantès (his eyes turned in the direction of the Château d’If)\r\nuttered this prayer, he saw off the farther point of the Island of\r\nPomègue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in\r\nsearch of prey; and with his sailor’s eye he knew it to be a Genoese\r\ntartan. She was coming out of Marseilles harbor, and was standing out\r\nto sea rapidly, her sharp prow cleaving through the waves.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried Edmond, “to think that in half an hour I could join her,\r\ndid I not fear being questioned, detected, and conveyed back to\r\nMarseilles! What can I do? What story can I invent? under pretext of\r\ntrading along the coast, these men, who are in reality smugglers, will\r\nprefer selling me to doing a good action. I must wait. But I cannot—I\r\nam starving. In a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted;\r\nbesides, perhaps I have not been missed at the fortress. I can pass as\r\none of the sailors wrecked last night. My story will be accepted, for\r\nthere is no one left to contradict me.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Dantès looked toward the spot where the fishing-vessel had\r\nbeen wrecked, and started. The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a\r\npoint of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel’s\r\nkeel, floated at the foot of the crag. In an instant Dantès’ plan was\r\nformed. He swam to the cap, placed it on his head, seized one of the\r\ntimbers, and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was\r\ntaking.\r\n\r\n“I am saved!” murmured he. And this conviction restored his strength.\r\n\r\nHe soon saw that the vessel, with the wind dead ahead, was tacking\r\nbetween the Château d’If and the tower of Planier. For an instant he\r\nfeared lest, instead of keeping in shore, she should stand out to sea;\r\nbut he soon saw that she would pass, like most vessels bound for Italy,\r\nbetween the islands of Jaros and Calaseraigne.\r\n\r\nHowever, the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another, and\r\nin one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of\r\nhim. He rose on the waves, making signs of distress; but no one on\r\nboard saw him, and the vessel stood on another tack. Dantès would have\r\nshouted, but he knew that the wind would drown his voice.\r\n\r\nIt was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber, for\r\nwithout it he would have been unable, perhaps, to reach the\r\nvessel—certainly to return to shore, should he be unsuccessful in\r\nattracting attention.\r\n\r\nDantès, though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take, had\r\nyet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him. Then he\r\nadvanced; but before they could meet, the vessel again changed her\r\ncourse. By a violent effort he rose half out of the water, waving his\r\ncap, and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors. This time he was\r\nboth seen and heard, and the tartan instantly steered towards him. At\r\nthe same time, he saw they were about to lower the boat.\r\n\r\nAn instant after, the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards\r\nhim. Dantès let go of the timber, which he now thought to be useless,\r\nand swam vigorously to meet them. But he had reckoned too much upon his\r\nstrength, and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to\r\nhim. His arms became stiff, his legs lost their flexibility, and he was\r\nalmost breathless.\r\n\r\nHe shouted again. The two sailors redoubled their efforts, and one of\r\nthem cried in Italian, “Courage!”\r\n\r\nThe word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength\r\nto surmount passed over his head. He rose again to the surface,\r\nstruggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man, uttered a\r\nthird cry, and felt himself sinking, as if the fatal cannon shot were\r\nagain tied to his feet. The water passed over his head, and the sky\r\nturned gray. A convulsive movement again brought him to the surface. He\r\nfelt himself seized by the hair, then he saw and heard nothing. He had\r\nfainted.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened his eyes Dantès found himself on the deck of the tartan.\r\nHis first care was to see what course they were taking. They were\r\nrapidly leaving the Château d’If behind. Dantès was so exhausted that\r\nthe exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, he was lying on the deck. A sailor was rubbing his\r\nlimbs with a woollen cloth; another, whom he recognized as the one who\r\nhad cried out “Courage!” held a gourd full of rum to his mouth; while\r\nthe third, an old sailor, at once the pilot and captain, looked on with\r\nthat egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped\r\nyesterday, and which may overtake them tomorrow.\r\n\r\nA few drops of the rum restored suspended animation, while the friction\r\nof his limbs restored their elasticity.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” said the pilot in bad French.\r\n\r\n“I am,” replied Dantès, in bad Italian, “a Maltese sailor. We were\r\ncoming from Syracuse laden with grain. The storm of last night overtook\r\nus at Cape Morgiou, and we were wrecked on these rocks.”\r\n\r\n“Where do you come from?”\r\n\r\n“From these rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our\r\ncaptain and the rest of the crew were all lost. I saw your vessel, and\r\nfearful of being left to perish on the desolate island, I swam off on a\r\npiece of wreckage to try and intercept your course. You have saved my\r\nlife, and I thank you,” continued Dantès. “I was lost when one of your\r\nsailors caught hold of my hair.”\r\n\r\n“It was I,” said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance; “and it was\r\ntime, for you were sinking.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned Dantès, holding out his hand, “I thank you again.”\r\n\r\n“I almost hesitated, though,” replied the sailor; “you looked more like\r\na brigand than an honest man, with your beard six inches, and your hair\r\na foot long.”\r\n\r\nDantès recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the\r\ntime he was at the Château d’If.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said he, “I made a vow, to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my\r\nhair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger; but\r\ntoday the vow expires.”\r\n\r\n“Now what are we to do with you?” said the captain.\r\n\r\n“Alas, anything you please. My captain is dead; I have barely escaped;\r\nbut I am a good sailor. Leave me at the first port you make; I shall be\r\nsure to find employment.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know the Mediterranean?”\r\n\r\n“I have sailed over it since my childhood.”\r\n\r\n“You know the best harbors?”\r\n\r\n“There are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage\r\nover my eyes.”\r\n\r\n“I say, captain,” said the sailor who had cried “Courage!” to Dantès,\r\n“if what he says is true, what hinders his staying with us?”\r\n\r\n“If he says true,” said the captain doubtingly. “But in his present\r\ncondition he will promise anything, and take his chance of keeping it\r\nafterwards.”\r\n\r\n“I will do more than I promise,” said Dantès.\r\n\r\n“We shall see,” returned the other, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?” asked Dantès.\r\n\r\n“To Leghorn.”\r\n\r\n“Then why, instead of tacking so frequently, do you not sail nearer the\r\nwind?”\r\n\r\n“Because we should run straight on to the Island of Rion.”\r\n\r\n“You shall pass it by twenty fathoms.”\r\n\r\n“Take the helm, and let us see what you know.”\r\n\r\nThe young man took the helm, felt to see if the vessel answered the\r\nrudder promptly and seeing that, without being a first-rate sailor, she\r\nyet was tolerably obedient.\r\n\r\n“To the sheets,” said he. The four seamen, who composed the crew,\r\nobeyed, while the pilot looked on. “Haul taut.”\r\n\r\nThey obeyed.\r\n\r\n“Belay.” This order was also executed; and the vessel passed, as Dantès\r\nhad predicted, twenty fathoms to windward.\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” said the captain.\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” repeated the sailors. And they all looked with astonishment at\r\nthis man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor\r\nthey had not thought him capable of showing.\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Dantès, quitting the helm, “I shall be of some use to\r\nyou, at least during the voyage. If you do not want me at Leghorn, you\r\ncan leave me there, and I will pay you out of the first wages I get,\r\nfor my food and the clothes you lend me.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the captain, “we can agree very well, if you are\r\nreasonable.”\r\n\r\n“Give me what you give the others, and it will be all right,” returned\r\nDantès.\r\n\r\n“That’s not fair,” said the seaman who had saved Dantès; “for you know\r\nmore than we do.”\r\n\r\n“What is that to you, Jacopo?” returned the Captain. “Everyone is free\r\nto ask what he pleases.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true,” replied Jacopo; “I only make a remark.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of\r\ntrousers, if you have them.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Jacopo; “but I have a shirt and a pair of trousers.”\r\n\r\n“That is all I want,” interrupted Dantès. Jacopo dived into the hold\r\nand soon returned with what Edmond wanted.\r\n\r\n“Now, then, do you wish for anything else?” said the patron.\r\n\r\n“A piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum I tasted, for I\r\nhave not eaten or drunk for a long time.” He had not tasted food for\r\nforty hours. A piece of bread was brought, and Jacopo offered him the\r\ngourd.\r\n\r\n“Larboard your helm,” cried the captain to the steersman. Dantès\r\nglanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with\r\nhand in mid-air.\r\n\r\n“Hollo! what’s the matter at the Château d’If?” said the captain.\r\n\r\nA small white cloud, which had attracted Dantès’ attention, crowned the\r\nsummit of the bastion of the Château d’If. At the same moment the faint\r\nreport of a gun was heard. The sailors looked at one another.\r\n\r\n“What is this?” asked the captain.\r\n\r\n“A prisoner has escaped from the Château d’If, and they are firing the\r\nalarm gun,” replied Dantès. The captain glanced at him, but he had\r\nlifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure,\r\nthat suspicions, if the captain had any, died away.\r\n\r\n0277m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Pretty strong rum!” said Dantès, wiping his brow with his sleeve.\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” murmured he, “if it be, so much the better, for I have\r\nmade a rare acquisition.”\r\n\r\n0279m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder pretence of being fatigued, Dantès asked to take the helm; the\r\nsteersman, glad to be relieved, looked at the captain, and the latter\r\nby a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade. Dantès\r\ncould thus keep his eyes on Marseilles.\r\n\r\n“What is the day of the month?” asked he of Jacopo, who sat down beside\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“The 28th of February.”\r\n\r\n“In what year?”\r\n\r\n“In what year—you ask me in what year?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the young man, “I ask you in what year!”\r\n\r\n“You have forgotten then?”\r\n\r\n“I got such a fright last night,” replied Dantès, smiling, “that I have\r\nalmost lost my memory. I ask you what year is it?”\r\n\r\n“The year 1829,” returned Jacopo.\r\n\r\nIt was fourteen years, day for day, since Dantès’ arrest. He was\r\nnineteen when he entered the Château d’If; he was thirty-three when he\r\nescaped. A sorrowful smile passed over his face; he asked himself what\r\nhad become of Mercédès, who must believe him dead. Then his eyes\r\nlighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused\r\nhim so long and wretched a captivity. He renewed against Danglars,\r\nFernand, and Villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in\r\nhis dungeon.\r\n\r\nThis oath was no longer a vain menace; for the fastest sailor in the\r\nMediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan,\r\nthat with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to\r\nLeghorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 22. The Smugglers\r\n\r\nDantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of\r\nthe men with whom his lot had been cast. Without having been in the\r\nschool of the Abbé Faria, the worthy master of _La Jeune Amélie_ (the\r\nname of the Genoese tartan) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken\r\non the shores of that large lake called the Mediterranean, from the\r\nArabic to the Provençal, and this, while it spared him interpreters,\r\npersons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet, gave him great\r\nfacilities of communication, either with the vessels he met at sea,\r\nwith the small boats sailing along the coast, or with the people\r\nwithout name, country, or occupation, who are always seen on the quays\r\nof seaports, and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must\r\nsuppose to be a direct gift of Providence, as they have no visible\r\nmeans of support. It is fair to assume that Dantès was on board a\r\nsmuggler.\r\n\r\nAt first the captain had received Dantès on board with a certain degree\r\nof distrust. He was very well known to the customs officers of the\r\ncoast; and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual\r\nbattle of wits, he had at first thought that Dantès might be an\r\nemissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties, who\r\nperhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets\r\nof his trade. But the skilful manner in which Dantès had handled the\r\nlugger had entirely reassured him; and then, when he saw the light\r\nplume of smoke floating above the bastion of the Château d’If, and\r\nheard the distant report, he was instantly struck with the idea that he\r\nhad on board his vessel one whose coming and going, like that of kings,\r\nwas accompanied with salutes of artillery. This made him less uneasy,\r\nit must be owned, than if the new-comer had proved to be a customs\r\nofficer; but this supposition also disappeared like the first, when he\r\nbeheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit.\r\n\r\nEdmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without\r\nthe owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew\r\ntried to “pump” him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave\r\naccurate descriptions of Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as\r\nMarseilles, and held stoutly to his first story. Thus the Genoese,\r\nsubtle as he was, was duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild\r\ndemeanor, his nautical skill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded.\r\nMoreover, it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd\r\npersons who know nothing but what they should know, and believe nothing\r\nbut what they should believe.\r\n\r\nIn this state of mutual understanding, they reached Leghorn. Here\r\nEdmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he\r\ncould recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen\r\nyears. He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth\r\nhad been, and was now to find out what the man had become. His comrades\r\nbelieved that his vow was fulfilled. As he had twenty times touched at\r\nLeghorn, he remembered a barber in St. Ferdinand Street; he went there\r\nto have his beard and hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this\r\nman with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head\r\nthe appearance of one of Titian’s portraits. At this period it was not\r\nthe fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber\r\nwould only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should\r\nconsent voluntarily to deprive himself of them. The Leghorn barber said\r\nnothing and went to work.\r\n\r\nWhen the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was\r\ncompletely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked\r\nfor a looking-glass. He was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty\r\nyears of age, and his fourteen years’ imprisonment had produced a great\r\ntransformation in his appearance.\r\n\r\nDantès had entered the Château d’If with the round, open, smiling face\r\nof a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been\r\nsmooth, and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past. This\r\nwas now all changed. The oval face was lengthened, his smiling mouth\r\nhad assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution; his\r\neyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes\r\nwere full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally sparkled\r\ngloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his complexion, so long kept\r\nfrom the sun, had now that pale color which produces, when the features\r\nare encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of\r\nthe north; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused\r\nover his features a refined intellectual expression; and he had also\r\nacquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that vigor which a frame\r\npossesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself.\r\n\r\n0283m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity\r\nof a rounded and muscular figure. As to his voice, prayers, sobs, and\r\nimprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly\r\npenetrating sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse.\r\n\r\nMoreover, from being so long in twilight or darkness, his eyes had\r\nacquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night, common to\r\nthe hyena and the wolf. Edmond smiled when he beheld himself; it was\r\nimpossible that his best friend—if, indeed, he had any friend\r\nleft—could recognize him; he could not recognize himself.\r\n\r\nThe master of _La Jeune Amélie_, who was very desirous of retaining\r\namongst his crew a man of Edmond’s value, had offered to advance him\r\nfunds out of his future profits, which Edmond had accepted. His next\r\ncare on leaving the barber’s who had achieved his first metamorphosis\r\nwas to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor’s suit—a garb, as we all\r\nknow, very simple, and consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt,\r\nand a cap.\r\n\r\nIt was in this costume, and bringing back to Jacopo the shirt and\r\ntrousers he had lent him, that Edmond reappeared before the captain of\r\nthe lugger, who had made him tell his story over and over again before\r\nhe could believe him, or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man\r\nwith thick and matted beard, hair tangled with seaweed, and body\r\nsoaking in seabrine, whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned.\r\nAttracted by his prepossessing appearance, he renewed his offers of an\r\nengagement to Dantès; but Dantès, who had his own projects, would not\r\nagree for a longer time than three months.\r\n\r\n_La Jeune Amélie_ had a very active crew, very obedient to their\r\ncaptain, who lost as little time as possible. He had scarcely been a\r\nweek at Leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed\r\nmuslins, contraband cottons, English powder, and tobacco on which the\r\nexcise had forgotten to put its mark. The master was to get all this\r\nout of Leghorn free of duties, and land it on the shores of Corsica,\r\nwhere certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to France.\r\n\r\nThey sailed; Edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the\r\nfirst horizon of his youth, and which he had so often dreamed of in\r\nprison. He left Gorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his left, and\r\nwent towards the country of Paoli and Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe next morning going on deck, as he always did at an early hour, the\r\npatron found Dantès leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense\r\nearnestness at a pile of granite rocks, which the rising sun tinged\r\nwith rosy light. It was the Island of Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n_La Jeune Amélie_ left it three-quarters of a league to the larboard\r\nand kept on for Corsica. Dantès thought, as they passed so closely to\r\nthe island whose name was so interesting to him, that he had only to\r\nleap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land. But then\r\nwhat could he do without instruments to discover his treasure, without\r\narms to defend himself? Besides, what would the sailors say? What would\r\nthe patron think? He must wait.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Dantès had learned how to wait; he had waited fourteen\r\nyears for his liberty, and now he was free he could wait at least six\r\nmonths or a year for wealth. Would he not have accepted liberty without\r\nriches if it had been offered to him? Besides, were not those riches\r\nchimerical?—offspring of the brain of the poor Abbé Faria, had they not\r\ndied with him? It is true, the letter of the Cardinal Spada was\r\nsingularly circumstantial, and Dantès repeated it to himself, from one\r\nend to the other, for he had not forgotten a word.\r\n\r\n0285m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvening came, and Edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of\r\ntwilight, and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own,\r\nfor he, with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison, continued to\r\nbehold it last of all, for he remained alone upon deck. The next morn\r\nbroke off the coast of Aleria; all day they coasted, and in the evening\r\nsaw fires lighted on land; the position of these was no doubt a signal\r\nfor landing, for a ship’s lantern was hung up at the mast-head instead\r\nof the streamer, and they came to within a gunshot of the shore. Dantès\r\nnoticed that the captain of _La Jeune Amélie_ had, as he neared the\r\nland, mounted two small culverins, which, without making much noise,\r\ncan throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so.\r\n\r\nBut on this occasion the precaution was superfluous, and everything\r\nproceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness. Four shallops came\r\noff with very little noise alongside the lugger, which, no doubt, in\r\nacknowledgement of the compliment, lowered her own shallop into the\r\nsea, and the five boats worked so well that by two o’clock in the\r\nmorning all the cargo was out of _La Jeune Amélie_ and on _terra\r\nfirma_. The same night, such a man of regularity was the patron of _La\r\nJeune Amélie_, the profits were divided, and each man had a hundred\r\nTuscan livres, or about eighty francs.\r\n\r\nBut the voyage was not ended. They turned the bowsprit towards\r\nSardinia, where they intended to take in a cargo, which was to replace\r\nwhat had been discharged. The second operation was as successful as the\r\nfirst, _La Jeune Amélie_ was in luck. This new cargo was destined for\r\nthe coast of the Duchy of Lucca, and consisted almost entirely of\r\nHavana cigars, sherry, and Malaga wines.\r\n\r\nThere they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties; the\r\nexcise was, in truth, the everlasting enemy of the patron of _La Jeune\r\nAmélie_. A customs officer was laid low, and two sailors wounded;\r\nDantès was one of the latter, a ball having touched him in the left\r\nshoulder. Dantès was almost glad of this affray, and almost pleased at\r\nbeing wounded, for they were rude lessons which taught him with what\r\neye he could view danger, and with what endurance he could bear\r\nsuffering. He had contemplated danger with a smile, and when wounded\r\nhad exclaimed with the great philosopher, “Pain, thou art not an evil.”\r\n\r\nHe had, moreover, looked upon the customs officer wounded to death,\r\nand, whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill\r\nof human sentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him.\r\nDantès was on the way he desired to follow, and was moving towards the\r\nend he wished to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in\r\nhis bosom. Jacopo, seeing him fall, had believed him killed, and\r\nrushing towards him raised him up, and then attended to him with all\r\nthe kindness of a devoted comrade.\r\n\r\nThis world was not then so good as Doctor Pangloss believed it, neither\r\nwas it so wicked as Dantès thought it, since this man, who had nothing\r\nto expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the\r\nprize-money, manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall.\r\nFortunately, as we have said, Edmond was only wounded, and with certain\r\nherbs gathered at certain seasons, and sold to the smugglers by the old\r\nSardinian women, the wound soon closed. Edmond then resolved to try\r\nJacopo, and offered him in return for his attention a share of his\r\nprize-money, but Jacopo refused it indignantly.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first\r\nbestowed on Edmond, the latter was moved to a certain degree of\r\naffection. But this sufficed for Jacopo, who instinctively felt that\r\nEdmond had a right to superiority of position—a superiority which\r\nEdmond had concealed from all others. And from this time the kindness\r\nwhich Edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman.\r\n\r\nThen in the long days on board ship, when the vessel, gliding on with\r\nsecurity over the azure sea, required no care but the hand of the\r\nhelmsman, thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails, Edmond,\r\nwith a chart in his hand, became the instructor of Jacopo, as the poor\r\nAbbé Faria had been his tutor. He pointed out to him the bearings of\r\nthe coast, explained to him the variations of the compass, and taught\r\nhim to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call\r\nheaven, and where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds.\r\n\r\nAnd when Jacopo inquired of him, “What is the use of teaching all these\r\nthings to a poor sailor like me?” Edmond replied, “Who knows? You may\r\none day be the captain of a vessel. Your fellow-countryman, Bonaparte,\r\nbecame emperor.” We had forgotten to say that Jacopo was a Corsican.\r\n\r\nTwo months and a half elapsed in these trips, and Edmond had become as\r\nskilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman; he had formed an\r\nacquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast, and learned all the\r\nMasonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other. He had\r\npassed and re-passed his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times, but not\r\nonce had he found an opportunity of landing there.\r\n\r\nHe then formed a resolution. As soon as his engagement with the patron\r\nof _La Jeune Amélie_ ended, he would hire a small vessel on his own\r\naccount—for in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred\r\npiastres—and under some pretext land at the Island of Monte Cristo.\r\nThen he would be free to make his researches, not perhaps entirely at\r\nliberty, for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied\r\nhim. But in this world we must risk something. Prison had made Edmond\r\nprudent, and he was desirous of running no risk whatever. But in vain\r\ndid he rack his imagination; fertile as it was, he could not devise any\r\nplan for reaching the island without companionship.\r\n\r\nDantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes, when the patron,\r\nwho had great confidence in him, and was very desirous of retaining him\r\nin his service, took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern\r\non the Via del’ Oglio, where the leading smugglers of Leghorn used to\r\ncongregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade. Already\r\nDantès had visited this maritime Bourse two or three times, and seeing\r\nall these hardy free-traders, who supplied the whole coast for nearly\r\ntwo hundred leagues in extent, he had asked himself what power might\r\nnot that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all\r\nthese contrary and diverging minds. This time it was a great matter\r\nthat was under discussion, connected with a vessel laden with Turkey\r\ncarpets, stuffs of the Levant, and cashmeres. It was necessary to find\r\nsome neutral ground on which an exchange could be made, and then to try\r\nand land these goods on the coast of France. If the venture was\r\nsuccessful the profit would be enormous, there would be a gain of fifty\r\nor sixty piastres each for the crew.\r\n\r\nThe patron of _La Jeune Amélie_ proposed as a place of landing the\r\nIsland of Monte Cristo, which being completely deserted, and having\r\nneither soldiers nor revenue officers, seemed to have been placed in\r\nthe midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen Olympus by\r\nMercury, the god of merchants and robbers, classes of mankind which we\r\nin modern times have separated if not made distinct, but which\r\nantiquity appears to have included in the same category.\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Monte Cristo Dantès started with joy; he rose to\r\nconceal his emotion, and took a turn around the smoky tavern, where all\r\nthe languages of the known world were jumbled in a _lingua franca_.\r\n\r\nWhen he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the\r\nmatter, it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and\r\nset out on the following night. Edmond, being consulted, was of opinion\r\nthat the island afforded every possible security, and that great\r\nenterprises to be well done should be done quickly.\r\n\r\nNothing then was altered in the plan, and orders were given to get\r\nunder weigh next night, and, wind and weather permitting, to make the\r\nneutral island by the following day.\r\n\r\n0289m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo\r\n\r\nThus, at length, by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which\r\nsometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an\r\nevil destiny, Dantès was about to secure the opportunity he wished for,\r\nby simple and natural means, and land on the island without incurring\r\nany suspicion. One night more and he would be on his way.\r\n\r\nThe night was one of feverish distraction, and in its progress visions,\r\ngood and evil, passed through Dantès’ mind. If he closed his eyes, he\r\nsaw Cardinal Spada’s letter written on the wall in characters of\r\nflame—if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain. He\r\nascended into grottos paved with emeralds, with panels of rubies, and\r\nthe roof glowing with diamond stalactites. Pearls fell drop by drop, as\r\nsubterranean waters filter in their caves. Edmond, amazed,\r\nwonderstruck, filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then\r\nreturned to daylight, when he discovered that his prizes had all\r\nchanged into common pebbles. He then endeavored to re-enter the\r\nmarvellous grottos, but they had suddenly receded, and now the path\r\nbecame a labyrinth, and then the entrance vanished, and in vain did he\r\ntax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the\r\nsplendid caverns of Ali Baba to the Arabian fisherman. All was useless,\r\nthe treasure disappeared, and had again reverted to the genii from whom\r\nfor a moment he had hoped to carry it off.\r\n\r\nThe day came at length, and was almost as feverish as the night had\r\nbeen, but it brought reason to the aid of imagination, and Dantès was\r\nthen enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and\r\nunsettled in his brain. Night came, and with it the preparation for\r\ndeparture, and these preparations served to conceal Dantès’ agitation.\r\nHe had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he\r\nwas almost like a commander on board; and as his orders were always\r\nclear, distinct, and easy of execution, his comrades obeyed him with\r\ncelerity and pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe old patron did not interfere, for he too had recognized the\r\nsuperiority of Dantès over the crew and himself. He saw in the young\r\nman his natural successor, and regretted that he had not a daughter,\r\nthat he might have bound Edmond to him by a more secure alliance. At\r\nseven o’clock in the evening all was ready, and at ten minutes past\r\nseven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled. The\r\nsea was calm, and, with a fresh breeze from the south-east, they sailed\r\nbeneath a bright blue sky, in which God also lighted up in turn his\r\nbeacon lights, each of which is a world. Dantès told them that all\r\nhands might turn in, and he would take the helm. When the Maltese (for\r\nso they called Dantès) had said this, it was sufficient, and all went\r\nto their bunks contentedly.\r\n\r\nThis frequently happened. Dantès, cast from solitude into the world,\r\nfrequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude; and what\r\nsolitude is more complete, or more poetical, than that of a ship\r\nfloating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night, in\r\nthe silence of immensity, and under the eye of Heaven?\r\n\r\nNow this solitude was peopled with his thoughts, the night lighted up\r\nby his illusions, and the silence animated by his anticipations. When\r\nthe patron awoke, the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set, and\r\nevery sail full with the breeze. They were making nearly ten knots an\r\nhour. The Island of Monte Cristo loomed large in the horizon. Edmond\r\nresigned the lugger to the master’s care, and went and lay down in his\r\nhammock; but, in spite of a sleepless night, he could not close his\r\neyes for a moment.\r\n\r\nTwo hours afterwards he came on deck, as the boat was about to double\r\nthe Island of Elba. They were just abreast of Mareciana, and beyond the\r\nflat but verdant Island of La Pianosa. The peak of Monte Cristo\r\nreddened by the burning sun, was seen against the azure sky. Dantès\r\nordered the helmsman to put down his helm, in order to leave La Pianosa\r\nto starboard, as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or\r\nthree knots. About five o’clock in the evening the island was distinct,\r\nand everything on it was plainly perceptible, owing to that clearness\r\nof the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast\r\nat its setting.\r\n\r\nEdmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the\r\nvariety of twilight colors, from the brightest pink to the deepest\r\nblue; and from time to time his cheeks flushed, his brow darkened, and\r\na mist passed over his eyes. Never did a gamester, whose whole fortune\r\nis staked on one cast of the die, experience the anguish which Edmond\r\nfelt in his paroxysms of hope.\r\n\r\nNight came, and at ten o’clock they anchored. _La Jeune Amélie_ was\r\nfirst at the rendezvous. In spite of his usual command over himself,\r\nDantès could not restrain his impetuosity. He was the first to jump on\r\nshore; and had he dared, he would, like Lucius Brutus, have “kissed his\r\nmother earth.” It was dark, but at eleven o’clock the moon rose in the\r\nmidst of the ocean, whose every wave she silvered, and then, “ascending\r\nhigh,” played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second\r\nPelion.\r\n\r\nThe island was familiar to the crew of _La Jeune Amélie_,—it was one of\r\nher regular haunts. As to Dantès, he had passed it on his voyage to and\r\nfrom the Levant, but never touched at it. He questioned Jacopo.\r\n\r\n“Where shall we pass the night?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Why, on board the tartan,” replied the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Should we not do better in the grottos?”\r\n\r\n“What grottos?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the grottos—caves of the island.”\r\n\r\n“I do not know of any grottos,” replied Jacopo.\r\n\r\nThe cold sweat sprang forth on Dantès’ brow.\r\n\r\n“What, are there no grottos at Monte Cristo?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Dantès was speechless; then he remembered that these caves\r\nmight have been filled up by some accident, or even stopped up, for the\r\nsake of greater security, by Cardinal Spada. The point was, then, to\r\ndiscover the hidden entrance. It was useless to search at night, and\r\nDantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning. Besides,\r\na signal made half a league out at sea, and to which _La Jeune Amélie_\r\nreplied by a similar signal, indicated that the moment for business had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThe boat that now arrived, assured by the answering signal that all was\r\nwell, soon came in sight, white and silent as a phantom, and cast\r\nanchor within a cable’s length of shore.\r\n\r\nThen the landing began. Dantès reflected, as he worked, on the shout of\r\njoy which, with a single word, he could evoke from all these men, if he\r\ngave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart;\r\nbut, far from disclosing this precious secret, he almost feared that he\r\nhad already said too much, and by his restlessness and continual\r\nquestions, his minute observations and evident preoccupation, aroused\r\nsuspicions. Fortunately, as regarded this circumstance at least, his\r\npainful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness, and the\r\nglimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but\r\ntransitory.\r\n\r\nNo one had the slightest suspicion; and when next day, taking a\r\nfowling-piece, powder, and shot, Dantès declared his intention to go\r\nand kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to\r\nrock, his wish was construed into a love of sport, or a desire for\r\nsolitude. However, Jacopo insisted on following him, and Dantès did not\r\noppose this, fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust.\r\nScarcely, however, had they gone a quarter of a league when, having\r\nkilled a kid, he begged Jacopo to take it to his comrades, and request\r\nthem to cook it, and when ready to let him know by firing a gun. This\r\nand some dried fruits and a flask of Monte Pulciano, was the bill of\r\nfare.\r\n\r\nDantès went on, looking from time to time behind and around about him.\r\nHaving reached the summit of a rock, he saw, a thousand feet beneath\r\nhim, his companions, whom Jacopo had rejoined, and who were all busy\r\npreparing the repast which Edmond’s skill as a marksman had augmented\r\nwith a capital dish.\r\n\r\nEdmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a\r\nman superior to his fellows.\r\n\r\n“In two hours’ time,” said he, “these persons will depart richer by\r\nfifty piastres each, to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to\r\ngain fifty more; then they will return with a fortune of six hundred\r\nfrancs, and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans\r\nand the insolence of nabobs. At this moment hope makes me despise their\r\nriches, which seem to me contemptible. Yet perchance tomorrow deception\r\nwill so act on me, that I shall, on compulsion, consider such a\r\ncontemptible possession as the utmost happiness. Oh, no!” exclaimed\r\nEdmond, “that will not be. The wise, unerring Faria could not be\r\nmistaken in this one thing. Besides, it were better to die than to\r\ncontinue to lead this low and wretched life.”\r\n\r\nThus Dantès, who but three months before had no desire but liberty had\r\nnow not liberty enough, and panted for wealth. The cause was not in\r\nDantès, but in Providence, who, while limiting the power of man, has\r\nfilled him with boundless desires.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, by a cleft between two walls of rock, following a path worn\r\nby a torrent, and which, in all human probability, human foot had never\r\nbefore trod, Dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos\r\nmust have existed. Keeping along the shore, and examining the smallest\r\nobject with serious attention, he thought he could trace, on certain\r\nrocks, marks made by the hand of man.\r\n\r\nTime, which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle, as\r\nit invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness, seemed to have\r\nrespected these signs, which apparently had been made with some degree\r\nof regularity, and probably with a definite purpose. Occasionally the\r\nmarks were hidden under tufts of myrtle, which spread into large bushes\r\nladen with blossoms, or beneath parasitical lichen. So Edmond had to\r\nseparate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the\r\nguide-marks were. The sight of marks renewed Edmond’s fondest hopes.\r\nMight it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them,\r\nin order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event\r\nof a catastrophe, which he could not foresee would have been so\r\ncomplete. This solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements\r\nof a man desirous of burying treasure. Only, might not these betraying\r\nmarks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made? and\r\nhad the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious\r\nsecret?\r\n\r\n0295m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed, however, to Edmond, who was hidden from his comrades by the\r\ninequalities of the ground, that at sixty paces from the harbor the\r\nmarks ceased; nor did they terminate at any grotto. A large round rock,\r\nplaced solidly on its base, was the only spot to which they seemed to\r\nlead. Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end\r\nof the route he had only explored its beginning, and he therefore\r\nturned round and retraced his steps.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast, had got some water from\r\na spring, spread out the fruit and bread, and cooked the kid. Just at\r\nthe moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit, they\r\nsaw Edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock,\r\nand they fired the signal agreed upon. The sportsman instantly changed\r\nhis direction, and ran quickly towards them. But even while they\r\nwatched his daring progress, Edmond’s foot slipped, and they saw him\r\nstagger on the edge of a rock and disappear. They all rushed towards\r\nhim, for all loved Edmond in spite of his superiority; yet Jacopo\r\nreached him first.\r\n\r\nHe found Edmond lying prone, bleeding, and almost senseless. He had\r\nrolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet. They poured a little\r\nrum down his throat, and this remedy which had before been so\r\nbeneficial to him, produced the same effect as formerly. Edmond opened\r\nhis eyes, complained of great pain in his knee, a feeling of heaviness\r\nin his head, and severe pains in his loins. They wished to carry him to\r\nthe shore; but when they touched him, although under Jacopo’s\r\ndirections, he declared, with heavy groans, that he could not bear to\r\nbe moved.\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that Dantès did not now think of his dinner, but he\r\ninsisted that his comrades, who had not his reasons for fasting, should\r\nhave their meal. As for himself, he declared that he had only need of a\r\nlittle rest, and that when they returned he should be easier. The\r\nsailors did not require much urging. They were hungry, and the smell of\r\nthe roasted kid was very savory, and your tars are not very\r\nceremonious. An hour afterwards they returned. All that Edmond had been\r\nable to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean\r\nagainst a moss-grown rock.\r\n\r\nBut, instead of growing easier, Dantès’ pains appeared to increase in\r\nviolence. The old patron, who was obliged to sail in the morning in\r\norder to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France,\r\nbetween Nice and Fréjus, urged Dantès to try and rise. Edmond made\r\ngreat exertions in order to comply; but at each effort he fell back,\r\nmoaning and turning pale.\r\n\r\n“He has broken his ribs,” said the commander, in a low voice. “No\r\nmatter; he is an excellent fellow, and we must not leave him. We will\r\ntry and carry him on board the tartan.”\r\n\r\nDantès declared, however, that he would rather die where he was than\r\nundergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the patron, “let what may happen, it shall never be said\r\nthat we deserted a good comrade like you. We will not go till evening.”\r\n\r\nThis very much astonished the sailors, although, not one opposed it.\r\nThe patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever\r\nseen him give up an enterprise, or even delay in its execution. Dantès\r\nwould not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules\r\nshould be made in his favor.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” he said to the patron, “I was awkward, and it is just that I\r\npay the penalty of my clumsiness. Leave me a small supply of biscuit, a\r\ngun, powder, and balls, to kill the kids or defend myself at need, and\r\na pickaxe, that I may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“But you’ll die of hunger,” said the patron.\r\n\r\n“I would rather do so,” was Edmond’s reply, “than suffer the\r\ninexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me.”\r\n\r\nThe patron turned towards his vessel, which was rolling on the swell in\r\nthe little harbor, and, with sails partly set, would be ready for sea\r\nwhen her toilet should be completed.\r\n\r\n“What are we to do, Maltese?” asked the captain. “We cannot leave you\r\nhere so, and yet we cannot stay.”\r\n\r\n“Go, go!” exclaimed Dantès.\r\n\r\n“We shall be absent at least a week,” said the patron, “and then we\r\nmust run out of our course to come here and take you up again.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Dantès, “if in two or three days you hail any fishing-boat,\r\ndesire them to come here to me. I will pay twenty-five piastres for my\r\npassage back to Leghorn. If you do not come across one, return for me.”\r\nThe patron shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Listen, Captain Baldi; there’s one way of settling this,” said Jacopo.\r\n“Do you go, and I will stay and take care of the wounded man.”\r\n\r\n“And give up your share of the venture,” said Edmond, “to remain with\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Jacopo, “and without any hesitation.”\r\n\r\n“You are a good fellow and a kind-hearted messmate,” replied Edmond,\r\n“and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions; but I do\r\nnot wish anyone to stay with me. A day or two of rest will set me up,\r\nand I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent\r\nfor bruises.”\r\n\r\nA peculiar smile passed over Dantès’ lips; he squeezed Jacopo’s hand\r\nwarmly, but nothing could shake his determination to remain—and remain\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThe smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set sail, but\r\nnot without turning about several times, and each time making signs of\r\na cordial farewell, to which Edmond replied with his hand only, as if\r\nhe could not move the rest of his body.\r\n\r\nThen, when they had disappeared, he said with a smile,—“’Tis strange\r\nthat it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and\r\ndevotion.” Then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock,\r\nfrom which he had a full view of the sea, and thence he saw the tartan\r\ncomplete her preparations for sailing, weigh anchor, and, balancing\r\nherself as gracefully as a water-fowl ere it takes to the wing, set\r\nsail.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour she was completely out of sight; at least, it was\r\nimpossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot\r\nwhere he was. Then Dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among\r\nthe myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks, took his gun in one hand,\r\nhis pickaxe in the other, and hastened towards the rock on which the\r\nmarks he had noted terminated.\r\n\r\n“And now,” he exclaimed, remembering the tale of the Arabian fisherman,\r\nwhich Faria had related to him, “now, Open Sesame!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 24. The Secret Cave\r\n\r\nThe sun had nearly reached the meridian, and his scorching rays fell\r\nfull on the rocks, which seemed themselves sensible of the heat.\r\nThousands of grasshoppers, hidden in the bushes, chirped with a\r\nmonotonous and dull note; the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees\r\nwaved and rustled in the wind. At every step that Edmond took he\r\ndisturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald; afar off\r\nhe saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag. In a word, the island\r\nwas inhabited, yet Edmond felt himself alone, guided by the hand of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nHe felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread—that dread of\r\nthe daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and\r\nobserved. This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was\r\nabout to begin his labor, he stopped, laid down his pickaxe, seized his\r\ngun, mounted to the summit of the highest rock, and from thence gazed\r\nround in every direction.\r\n\r\nBut it was not upon Corsica, the very houses of which he could\r\ndistinguish; or on Sardinia; or on the Island of Elba, with its\r\nhistorical associations; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to\r\nthe experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of Genoa the\r\nproud, and Leghorn the commercial, that he gazed. It was at the\r\nbrigantine that had left in the morning, and the tartan that had just\r\nset sail, that Edmond fixed his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe first was just disappearing in the straits of Bonifacio; the other,\r\nfollowing an opposite direction, was about to round the Island of\r\nCorsica.\r\n\r\nThis sight reassured him. He then looked at the objects near him. He\r\nsaw that he was on the highest point of the island,—a statue on this\r\nvast pedestal of granite, nothing human appearing in sight, while the\r\nblue ocean beat against the base of the island, and covered it with a\r\nfringe of foam. Then he descended with cautious and slow step, for he\r\ndreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned\r\nshould happen in reality.\r\n\r\nDantès, as we have said, had traced the marks along the rocks, and he\r\nhad noticed that they led to a small creek, which was hidden like the\r\nbath of some ancient nymph. This creek was sufficiently wide at its\r\nmouth, and deep in the centre, to admit of the entrance of a small\r\nvessel of the lugger class, which would be perfectly concealed from\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThen following the clew that, in the hands of the Abbé Faria, had been\r\nso skilfully used to guide him through the Dædalian labyrinth of\r\nprobabilities, he thought that the Cardinal Spada, anxious not to be\r\nwatched, had entered the creek, concealed his little barque, followed\r\nthe line marked by the notches in the rock, and at the end of it had\r\nburied his treasure. It was this idea that had brought Dantès back to\r\nthe circular rock. One thing only perplexed Edmond, and destroyed his\r\ntheory. How could this rock, which weighed several tons, have been\r\nlifted to this spot, without the aid of many men?\r\n\r\nSuddenly an idea flashed across his mind. Instead of raising it,\r\nthought he, they have lowered it. And he sprang from the rock in order\r\nto inspect the base on which it had formerly stood.\r\n\r\nHe soon perceived that a slope had been formed, and the rock had slid\r\nalong this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied. A large stone\r\nhad served as a wedge; flints and pebbles had been inserted around it,\r\nso as to conceal the orifice; this species of masonry had been covered\r\nwith earth, and grass and weeds had grown there, moss had clung to the\r\nstones, myrtle-bushes had taken root, and the old rock seemed fixed to\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n0301m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDantès dug away the earth carefully, and detected, or fancied he\r\ndetected, the ingenious artifice. He attacked this wall, cemented by\r\nthe hand of time, with his pickaxe. After ten minutes’ labor the wall\r\ngave way, and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened.\r\n\r\nDantès went and cut the strongest olive-tree he could find, stripped\r\noff its branches, inserted it in the hole, and used it as a lever. But\r\nthe rock was too heavy, and too firmly wedged, to be moved by anyone\r\nman, were he Hercules himself. Dantès saw that he must attack the\r\nwedge. But how?\r\n\r\nHe cast his eyes around, and saw the horn full of powder which his\r\nfriend Jacopo had left him. He smiled; the infernal invention would\r\nserve him for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of his pickaxe, Dantès, after the manner of a labor-saving\r\npioneer, dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported\r\nit, filled it with powder, then made a match by rolling his\r\nhandkerchief in saltpetre. He lighted it and retired.\r\n\r\nThe explosion soon followed; the upper rock was lifted from its base by\r\nthe terrific force of the powder; the lower one flew into pieces;\r\nthousands of insects escaped from the aperture Dantès had previously\r\nformed, and a huge snake, like the guardian demon of the treasure,\r\nrolled himself along in darkening coils, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nDantès approached the upper rock, which now, without any support,\r\nleaned towards the sea. The intrepid treasure-seeker walked round it,\r\nand, selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to\r\nattack, placed his lever in one of the crevices, and strained every\r\nnerve to move the mass.\r\n\r\nThe rock, already shaken by the explosion, tottered on its base. Dantès\r\nredoubled his efforts; he seemed like one of the ancient Titans, who\r\nuprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods. The rock\r\nyielded, rolled over, bounded from point to point, and finally\r\ndisappeared in the ocean.\r\n\r\nOn the spot it had occupied was a circular space, exposing an iron ring\r\nlet into a square flag-stone.\r\n\r\nDantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise; never had a first attempt\r\nbeen crowned with more perfect success. He would fain have continued,\r\nbut his knees trembled, and his heart beat so violently, and his sight\r\nbecame so dim, that he was forced to pause.\r\n\r\nThis feeling lasted but for a moment. Edmond inserted his lever in the\r\nring and exerted all his strength; the flag-stone yielded, and\r\ndisclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of\r\na subterraneous grotto.\r\n\r\nAnyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy. Dantès turned pale,\r\nhesitated, and reflected.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said he to himself, “be a man. I am accustomed to adversity. I\r\nmust not be cast down by the discovery that I have been deceived. What,\r\nthen, would be the use of all I have suffered? The heart breaks when,\r\nafter having been elated by flattering hopes, it sees all its illusions\r\ndestroyed. Faria has dreamed this; the Cardinal Spada buried no\r\ntreasure here; perhaps he never came here, or if he did, Cæsar Borgia,\r\nthe intrepid adventurer, the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer, has\r\nfollowed him, discovered his traces, pursued them as I have done,\r\nraised the stone, and descending before me, has left me nothing.”\r\n\r\nHe remained motionless and pensive, his eyes fixed on the gloomy\r\naperture that was open at his feet.\r\n\r\n“Now that I expect nothing, now that I no longer entertain the\r\nslightest hopes, the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of\r\ncuriosity.” And he remained again motionless and thoughtful.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of\r\nthat royal bandit. This fabulous event formed but a link in a long\r\nchain of marvels. Yes, Borgia has been here, a torch in one hand, a\r\nsword in the other, and within twenty paces, at the foot of this rock,\r\nperhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea, while their master\r\ndescended, as I am about to descend, dispelling the darkness before his\r\nawe-inspiring progress.”\r\n\r\n0303m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“But what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret?”\r\nasked Dantès of himself.\r\n\r\n“The fate,” replied he, smiling, “of those who buried Alaric, and were\r\ninterred with the corpse.”\r\n\r\n“Yet, had he come,” thought Dantès, “he would have found the treasure,\r\nand Borgia, he who compared Italy to an artichoke, which he could\r\ndevour leaf by leaf, knew too well the value of time to waste it in\r\nreplacing this rock. I will go down.”\r\n\r\nThen he descended, a smile on his lips, and murmuring that last word of\r\nhuman philosophy, “Perhaps!”\r\n\r\nBut instead of the darkness, and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he\r\nhad expected to find, Dantès saw a dim and bluish light, which, as well\r\nas the air, entered, not merely by the aperture he had just formed, but\r\nby the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from\r\nwithout, and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the\r\nwaving branches of the evergreen oaks, and the tendrils of the creepers\r\nthat grew from the rocks.\r\n\r\nAfter having stood a few minutes in the cavern, the atmosphere of which\r\nwas rather warm than damp, Dantès’ eye, habituated as it was to\r\ndarkness, could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern, which\r\nwas of granite that sparkled like diamonds.\r\n\r\n“Alas,” said Edmond, smiling, “these are the treasures the cardinal has\r\nleft; and the good abbé, seeing in a dream these glittering walls, has\r\nindulged in fallacious hopes.”\r\n\r\nBut he called to mind the words of the will, which he knew by heart.\r\n“In the farthest angle of the second opening,” said the cardinal’s\r\nwill. He had only found the first grotto; he had now to seek the\r\nsecond. Dantès continued his search. He reflected that this second\r\ngrotto must penetrate deeper into the island; he examined the stones,\r\nand sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed,\r\nmasked for precaution’s sake.\r\n\r\nThe pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of\r\nDantès’ forehead large drops of perspiration. At last it seemed to him\r\nthat one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo; he\r\neagerly advanced, and with the quickness of perception that no one but\r\na prisoner possesses, saw that there, in all probability, the opening\r\nmust be.\r\n\r\nHowever, he, like Cæsar Borgia, knew the value of time; and, in order\r\nto avoid fruitless toil, he sounded all the other walls with his\r\npickaxe, struck the earth with the butt of his gun, and finding nothing\r\nthat appeared suspicious, returned to that part of the wall whence\r\nissued the consoling sound he had before heard.\r\n\r\nHe again struck it, and with greater force. Then a singular thing\r\noccurred. As he struck the wall, pieces of stucco similar to that used\r\nin the ground work of arabesques broke off, and fell to the ground in\r\nflakes, exposing a large white stone. The aperture of the rock had been\r\nclosed with stones, then this stucco had been applied, and painted to\r\nimitate granite. Dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe, which\r\nentered someway between the interstices.\r\n\r\nIt was there he must dig.\r\n\r\nBut by some strange play of emotion, in proportion as the proofs that\r\nFaria, had not been deceived became stronger, so did his heart give\r\nway, and a feeling of discouragement stole over him. This last proof,\r\ninstead of giving him fresh strength, deprived him of it; the pickaxe\r\ndescended, or rather fell; he placed it on the ground, passed his hand\r\nover his brow, and remounted the stairs, alleging to himself, as an\r\nexcuse, a desire to be assured that no one was watching him, but in\r\nreality because he felt that he was about to faint.\r\n\r\nThe island was deserted, and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery\r\nglance; afar off, a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the\r\nblue ocean.\r\n\r\nDantès had tasted nothing, but he thought not of hunger at such a\r\nmoment; he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum, and again entered the\r\ncavern.\r\n\r\nThe pickaxe that had seemed so heavy, was now like a feather in his\r\ngrasp; he seized it, and attacked the wall. After several blows he\r\nperceived that the stones were not cemented, but had been merely placed\r\none upon the other, and covered with stucco; he inserted the point of\r\nhis pickaxe, and using the handle as a lever, with joy soon saw the\r\nstone turn as if on hinges, and fall at his feet.\r\n\r\nHe had nothing more to do now, but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe\r\nto draw the stones towards him one by one. The aperture was already\r\nsufficiently large for him to enter, but by waiting, he could still\r\ncling to hope, and retard the certainty of deception. At last, after\r\nrenewed hesitation, Dantès entered the second grotto.\r\n\r\nThe second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first; the air\r\nthat could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic\r\nsmell Dantès was surprised not to find in the outer cavern. He waited\r\nin order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere, and then\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\nAt the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle. But to Dantès’\r\neye there was no darkness. He glanced around this second grotto; it\r\nwas, like the first, empty.\r\n\r\nThe treasure, if it existed, was buried in this corner. The time had at\r\nlength arrived; two feet of earth removed, and Dantès’ fate would be\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\nHe advanced towards the angle, and summoning all his resolution,\r\nattacked the ground with the pickaxe. At the fifth or sixth blow the\r\npickaxe struck against an iron substance. Never did funeral knell,\r\nnever did alarm-bell, produce a greater effect on the hearer. Had\r\nDantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale.\r\n\r\nHe again struck his pickaxe into the earth, and encountered the same\r\nresistance, but not the same sound.\r\n\r\n“It is a casket of wood bound with iron,” thought he.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening; Dantès\r\nseized his gun, sprang through the opening, and mounted the stair. A\r\nwild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave, and was feeding at a\r\nlittle distance. This would have been a favorable occasion to secure\r\nhis dinner; but Dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nHe thought a moment, cut a branch of a resinous tree, lighted it at the\r\nfire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast, and descended\r\nwith this torch.\r\n\r\nHe wished to see everything. He approached the hole he had dug, and\r\nnow, with the aid of the torch, saw that his pickaxe had in reality\r\nstruck against iron and wood. He planted his torch in the ground and\r\nresumed his labor.\r\n\r\nIn an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared,\r\nand Dantès could see an oaken coffer, bound with cut steel; in the\r\nmiddle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate, which was still\r\nuntarnished, the arms of the Spada family—viz., a sword, _en pale_, on\r\nan oval shield, like all the Italian armorial bearings, and surmounted\r\nby a cardinal’s hat.\r\n\r\nDantès easily recognized them, Faria had so often drawn them for him.\r\nThere was no longer any doubt: the treasure was there—no one would have\r\nbeen at such pains to conceal an empty casket. In an instant he had\r\ncleared every obstacle away, and he saw successively the lock, placed\r\nbetween two padlocks, and the two handles at each end, all carved as\r\nthings were carved at that epoch, when art rendered the commonest\r\nmetals precious.\r\n\r\nDantès seized the handles, and strove to lift the coffer; it was\r\nimpossible. He sought to open it; lock and padlock were fastened; these\r\nfaithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust. Dantès\r\ninserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid,\r\nand pressing with all his force on the handle, burst open the\r\nfastenings. The hinges yielded in their turn and fell, still holding in\r\ntheir grasp fragments of the wood, and the chest was open.\r\n\r\n0307m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdmond was seized with vertigo; he cocked his gun and laid it beside\r\nhim. He then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see\r\nin the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are\r\nvisible in the firmament; then he re-opened them, and stood motionless\r\nwith amazement.\r\n\r\nThree compartments divided the coffer. In the first, blazed piles of\r\ngolden coin; in the second, were ranged bars of unpolished gold, which\r\npossessed nothing attractive save their value; in the third, Edmond\r\ngrasped handfuls of diamonds, pearls, and rubies, which, as they fell\r\non one another, sounded like hail against glass.\r\n\r\nAfter having touched, felt, examined these treasures, Edmond rushed\r\nthrough the caverns like a man seized with frenzy; he leaped on a rock,\r\nfrom whence he could behold the sea. He was alone—alone with these\r\ncountless, these unheard-of treasures! Was he awake, or was it but a\r\ndream? Was it a transient vision, or was he face to face with reality?\r\n\r\nHe would fain have gazed upon his gold, and yet he had not strength\r\nenough; for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent\r\nhis senses from leaving him, and then rushed madly about the rocks of\r\nMonte Cristo, terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea-fowls with\r\nhis wild cries and gestures; then he returned, and, still unable to\r\nbelieve the evidence of his senses, rushed into the grotto, and found\r\nhimself before this mine of gold and jewels.\r\n\r\nThis time he fell on his knees, and, clasping his hands convulsively,\r\nuttered a prayer intelligible to God alone. He soon became calmer and\r\nmore happy, for only now did he begin to realize his felicity.\r\n\r\nHe then set himself to work to count his fortune. There were a thousand\r\ningots of gold, each weighing from two to three pounds; then he piled\r\nup twenty-five thousand crowns, each worth about eighty francs of our\r\nmoney, and bearing the effigies of Alexander VI. and his predecessors;\r\nand he saw that the complement was not half empty. And he measured ten\r\ndouble handfuls of pearls, diamonds, and other gems, many of which,\r\nmounted by the most famous workmen, were valuable beyond their\r\nintrinsic worth.\r\n\r\nDantès saw the light gradually disappear, and fearing to be surprised\r\nin the cavern, left it, his gun in his hand. A piece of biscuit and a\r\nsmall quantity of rum formed his supper, and he snatched a few hours’\r\nsleep, lying over the mouth of the cave.\r\n\r\nIt was a night of joy and terror, such as this man of stupendous\r\nemotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 25. The Unknown\r\n\r\nDay, for which Dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open\r\neyes, again dawned. With the first light Dantès resumed his search.\r\nAgain he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening,\r\nand strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape; but\r\nit wore the same wild, barren aspect when seen by the rays of the\r\nmorning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of\r\neve.\r\n\r\nDescending into the grotto, he lifted the stone, filled his pockets\r\nwith gems, put the box together as well and securely as he could,\r\nsprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken, and\r\nthen carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform\r\nappearance; then, quitting the grotto, he replaced the stone, heaping\r\non it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite,\r\nfilling the interstices with earth, into which he deftly inserted\r\nrapidly growing plants, such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn,\r\nthen carefully watering these new plantations, he scrupulously effaced\r\nevery trace of footsteps, leaving the approach to the cavern as\r\nsavage-looking and untrodden as he had found it. This done, he\r\nimpatiently awaited the return of his companions. To wait at Monte\r\nCristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost\r\nincalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied\r\nnot the cravings of his heart, which yearned to return to dwell among\r\nmankind, and to assume the rank, power, and influence which are always\r\naccorded to wealth—that first and greatest of all the forces within the\r\ngrasp of man.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day, the smugglers returned. From a distance Dantès\r\nrecognized the rig and handling of _La Jeune Amélie_, and dragging\r\nhimself with affected difficulty towards the landing-place, he met his\r\ncompanions with an assurance that, although considerably better than\r\nwhen they quitted him, he still suffered acutely from his late\r\naccident. He then inquired how they had fared in their trip. To this\r\nquestion the smugglers replied that, although successful in landing\r\ntheir cargo in safety, they had scarcely done so when they received\r\nintelligence that a guard-ship had just quitted the port of Toulon and\r\nwas crowding all sail towards them. This obliged them to make all the\r\nspeed they could to evade the enemy, when they could but lament the\r\nabsence of Dantès, whose superior skill in the management of a vessel\r\nwould have availed them so materially. In fact, the pursuing vessel had\r\nalmost overtaken them when, fortunately, night came on, and enabled\r\nthem to double the Cape of Corsica, and so elude all further pursuit.\r\nUpon the whole, however, the trip had been sufficiently successful to\r\nsatisfy all concerned; while the crew, and particularly Jacopo,\r\nexpressed great regrets that Dantès had not been an equal sharer with\r\nthemselves in the profits, which amounted to no less a sum than fifty\r\npiastres each.\r\n\r\n0311m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdmond preserved the most admirable self-command, not suffering the\r\nfaintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all\r\nthe benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island;\r\nbut as _La Jeune Amélie_ had merely come to Monte Cristo to fetch him\r\naway, he embarked that same evening, and proceeded with the captain to\r\nLeghorn.\r\n\r\nArrived at Leghorn, he repaired to the house of a Jew, a dealer in\r\nprecious stones, to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds\r\nfor five thousand francs each. Dantès half feared that such valuable\r\njewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite\r\nsuspicion; but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions\r\nconcerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least\r\neighty per cent.\r\n\r\nThe following day Dantès presented Jacopo with an entirely new vessel,\r\naccompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres, that he\r\nmight provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his\r\noutfit, upon condition that he would go at once to Marseilles for the\r\npurpose of inquiring after an old man named Louis Dantès, residing in\r\nthe Allées de Meilhan, and also a young woman called Mercédès, an\r\ninhabitant of the Catalan village.\r\n\r\nJacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent\r\npresent, which Dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had\r\nmerely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family, who\r\ndid not allow him as much money as he liked to spend; but that on his\r\narrival at Leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune, left\r\nhim by an uncle, whose sole heir he was. The superior education of\r\nDantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that\r\nit never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe term for which Edmond had engaged to serve on board _La Jeune\r\nAmélie_ having expired, Dantès took leave of the captain, who at first\r\ntried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of\r\nthe crew, but having been told the history of the legacy, he ceased to\r\nimportune him further.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles, with directions\r\nfrom Dantès to join him at the Island of Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\nHaving seen Jacopo fairly out of the harbor, Dantès proceeded to make\r\nhis final adieus on board _La Jeune Amélie_, distributing so liberal a\r\ngratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all,\r\nand expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him. To the\r\ncaptain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his\r\nfuture plans. Then Dantès departed for Genoa.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay;\r\nthis yacht had been built by order of an Englishman, who, having heard\r\nthat the Genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the\r\nMediterranean in the construction of fast-sailing vessels, was desirous\r\nof possessing a specimen of their skill; the price agreed upon between\r\nthe Englishman and the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs.\r\nDantès, struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel,\r\napplied to its owner to transfer it to him, offering sixty thousand\r\nfrancs, upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate\r\npossession. The proposal was too advantageous to be refused, the more\r\nso as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour\r\nthrough Switzerland, and was not expected back in less than three weeks\r\nor a month, by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to\r\ncomplete another. A bargain was therefore struck. Dantès led the owner\r\nof the yacht to the dwelling of a Jew; retired with the latter for a\r\nfew minutes to a small back parlor, and upon their return the Jew\r\ncounted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in\r\nbright gold pieces.\r\n\r\nThe delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable\r\ncrew for the little vessel, but this Dantès declined with many thanks,\r\nsaying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone, and his principal\r\npleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself; the only thing the\r\nbuilder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret\r\ncloset in the cabin at his bed’s head, the closet to contain three\r\ndivisions, so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself. The\r\nbuilder cheerfully undertook the commission, and promised to have these\r\nsecret places completed by the next day, Dantès furnishing the\r\ndimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\n0313m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo hours afterward Dantès sailed from the port of Genoa, under the\r\ninspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the\r\nrich Spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht. But their\r\nwonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with\r\nwhich Dantès handled the helm. The boat, indeed, seemed to be animated\r\nwith almost human intelligence, so promptly did it obey the slightest\r\ntouch; and Dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to\r\nacknowledge that the Genoese had not without reason attained their high\r\nreputation in the art of shipbuilding.\r\n\r\nThe spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it\r\nremained visible; they then turned their conjectures upon her probable\r\ndestination. Some insisted she was making for Corsica, others the\r\nIsland of Elba; bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for\r\nSpain; while Africa was positively reported by many persons as her\r\nintended course; but no one thought of Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\nYet thither it was that Dantès guided his vessel, and at Monte Cristo\r\nhe arrived at the close of the second day; his boat had proved herself\r\na first-class sailor, and had come the distance from Genoa in\r\nthirty-five hours. Dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of\r\nthe shore, and, instead of landing at the usual place, he dropped\r\nanchor in the little creek. The island was utterly deserted, and bore\r\nno evidence of having been visited since he went away; his treasure was\r\njust as he had left it.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches,\r\nand ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited\r\nin the compartments of the secret locker.\r\n\r\nA week passed by. Dantès employed it in manœuvring his yacht round the\r\nisland, studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined\r\nfor some important service, till at the end of that time he was\r\nperfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities. The former Dantès\r\nproposed to augment, the latter to remedy.\r\n\r\nUpon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail\r\napproaching Monte Cristo. As it drew near, he recognized it as the boat\r\nhe had given to Jacopo. He immediately signalled it. His signal was\r\nreturned, and in two hours afterwards the new-comer lay at anchor\r\nbeside the yacht.\r\n\r\nA mournful answer awaited each of Edmond’s eager inquiries as to the\r\ninformation Jacopo had obtained. Old Dantès was dead, and Mercédès had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nDantès listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness; but,\r\nleaping lightly ashore, he signified his desire to be quite alone. In a\r\ncouple of hours he returned. Two of the men from Jacopo’s boat came on\r\nboard the yacht to assist in navigating it, and he gave orders that she\r\nshould be steered direct to Marseilles. For his father’s death he was\r\nin some manner prepared; but he knew not how to account for the\r\nmysterious disappearance of Mercédès.\r\n\r\nWithout divulging his secret, Dantès could not give sufficiently clear\r\ninstructions to an agent. There were, besides, other particulars he was\r\ndesirous of ascertaining, and those were of a nature he alone could\r\ninvestigate in a manner satisfactory to himself. His looking-glass had\r\nassured him, during his stay at Leghorn, that he ran no risk of\r\nrecognition; moreover, he had now the means of adopting any disguise he\r\nthought proper. One fine morning, then, his yacht, followed by the\r\nlittle fishing-boat, boldly entered the port of Marseilles, and\r\nanchored exactly opposite the spot from whence, on the\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten night of his departure for the Château d’If, he\r\nhad been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither.\r\n\r\n0315m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill Dantès could not view without a shudder the approach of a\r\ngendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of\r\nhealth ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the\r\nshore; but with that perfect self-possession he had acquired during his\r\nacquaintance with Faria, Dantès coolly presented an English passport he\r\nhad obtained from Leghorn, and as this gave him a standing which a\r\nFrench passport would not have afforded, he was informed that there\r\nexisted no obstacle to his immediate debarkation.\r\n\r\nThe first person to attract the attention of Dantès, as he landed on\r\nthe Canebière, was one of the crew belonging to the _Pharaon_. Edmond\r\nwelcomed the meeting with this fellow—who had been one of his own\r\nsailors—as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time\r\nhad worked in his own appearance. Going straight towards him, he\r\npropounded a variety of questions on different subjects, carefully\r\nwatching the man’s countenance as he did so; but not a word or look\r\nimplied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the\r\nperson with whom he was then conversing.\r\n\r\nGiving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility, Dantès\r\nproceeded onwards; but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man\r\nloudly calling him to stop.\r\n\r\nDantès instantly turned to meet him.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, sir,” said the honest fellow, in almost breathless\r\nhaste, “but I believe you made a mistake; you intended to give me a\r\ntwo-franc piece, and see, you gave me a double Napoleon.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, my good friend. I see that I have made a trifling mistake,\r\nas you say; but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you another\r\ndouble Napoleon, that you may drink to my health, and be able to ask\r\nyour messmates to join you.”\r\n\r\nSo extreme was the surprise of the sailor, that he was unable even to\r\nthank Edmond, whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in\r\nspeechless astonishment. “Some nabob from India,” was his comment.\r\n\r\nDantès, meanwhile, went on his way. Each step he trod oppressed his\r\nheart with fresh emotion; his first and most indelible recollections\r\nwere there; not a tree, not a street, that he passed but seemed filled\r\nwith dear and cherished memories. And thus he proceeded onwards till he\r\narrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles, from whence a full view of\r\nthe Allées de Meilhan was obtained. At this spot, so pregnant with fond\r\nand filial remembrances, his heart beat almost to bursting, his knees\r\ntottered under him, a mist floated over his sight, and had he not clung\r\nfor support to one of the trees, he would inevitably have fallen to the\r\nground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing\r\nthere. Recovering himself, however, he wiped the perspiration from his\r\nbrows, and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the\r\nhouse in which his father had lived.\r\n\r\nThe nasturtiums and other plants, which his father had delighted to\r\ntrain before his window, had all disappeared from the upper part of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nLeaning against the tree, he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper\r\nstories of the shabby little house. Then he advanced to the door, and\r\nasked whether there were any rooms to be let. Though answered in the\r\nnegative, he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the\r\nfifth floor, that, in despite of the oft-repeated assurance of the\r\n_concierge_ that they were occupied, Dantès succeeded in inducing the\r\nman to go up to the tenants, and ask permission for a gentleman to be\r\nallowed to look at them.\r\n\r\nThe tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been\r\nscarcely married a week; and seeing them, Dantès sighed heavily.\r\nNothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it\r\nhad been in the time of the elder Dantès; the very paper was different,\r\nwhile the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had\r\nbeen filled in Edmond’s time had all disappeared; the four walls alone\r\nremained as he had left them.\r\n\r\nThe bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former\r\nowner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his; and, in spite of\r\nhis efforts to prevent it, the eyes of Edmond were suffused in tears as\r\nhe reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last,\r\nvainly calling for his son.\r\n\r\nThe young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their\r\nvisitor’s emotion, and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing\r\neach other down his otherwise stern and immovable features; but they\r\nfelt the sacredness of his grief, and kindly refrained from questioning\r\nhim as to its cause, while, with instinctive delicacy, they left him to\r\nindulge his sorrow alone.\r\n\r\n0317m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections, they both\r\naccompanied him downstairs, reiterating their hope that he would come\r\nagain whenever he pleased, and assuring him that their poor dwelling\r\nwould ever be open to him.\r\n\r\nAs Edmond passed the door on the fourth floor, he paused to inquire\r\nwhether Caderousse the tailor still dwelt there; but he received for\r\nreply, that the person in question had got into difficulties, and at\r\nthe present time kept a small inn on the route from Bellegarde to\r\nBeaucaire.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the\r\nAllées de Meilhan belonged, Dantès next proceeded thither, and, under\r\nthe name of Lord Wilmore (the name and title inscribed on his\r\npassport), purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty-five\r\nthousand francs, at least ten thousand more than it was worth; but had\r\nits owner asked half a million, it would unhesitatingly have been\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of\r\nthe house, now become the property of Dantès, were duly informed by the\r\nnotary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds, etc., that the\r\nnew landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house,\r\nwithout the least augmentation of rent, upon condition of their giving\r\ninstant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited.\r\n\r\nThis strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the\r\nneighborhood of the Allées de Meilhan, and a multitude of theories were\r\nafloat, none of which was anywhere near the truth. But what raised\r\npublic astonishment to a climax, and set all conjecture at defiance,\r\nwas the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited\r\nthe Allées de Meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the\r\nlittle village of the Catalans, and afterwards observed to enter a poor\r\nfisherman’s hut, and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after\r\npersons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or\r\nsixteen years.\r\n\r\nBut on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had\r\nbeen asked received a handsome present, consisting of an entirely new\r\nfishing-boat, with two seines and a tender.\r\n\r\nThe delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have\r\npoured out their thanks to their generous benefactor, but they had seen\r\nhim, upon quitting the hut, merely give some orders to a sailor, and\r\nthen springing lightly on horseback, leave Marseilles by the Porte\r\nd’Aix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn\r\n\r\nSuch of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of\r\nFrance may perchance have noticed, about midway between the town of\r\nBeaucaire and the village of Bellegarde,—a little nearer to the former\r\nthan to the latter,—a small roadside inn, from the front of which hung,\r\ncreaking and flapping in the wind, a sheet of tin covered with a\r\ngrotesque representation of the Pont du Gard. This modern place of\r\nentertainment stood on the left-hand side of the post road, and backed\r\nupon the Rhône. It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a\r\ngarden, consisting of a small plot of ground, on the side opposite to\r\nthe main entrance reserved for the reception of guests. A few dingy\r\nolives and stunted fig-trees struggled hard for existence, but their\r\nwithered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict.\r\nBetween these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic, tomatoes,\r\nand eschalots; while, lone and solitary, like a forgotten sentinel, a\r\ntall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this\r\nunattractive spot, and displayed its flexible stem and fan-shaped\r\nsummit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub-tropical sun.\r\n\r\nAll these trees, great or small, were turned in the direction to which\r\nthe Mistral blows, one of the three curses of Provence, the others\r\nbeing the Durance and the Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn the surrounding plain, which more resembled a dusty lake than solid\r\nground, were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat, the effect, no\r\ndoubt, of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the\r\ncountry to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those\r\nparched regions was practicable. Each stalk served as a perch for a\r\ngrasshopper, which regaled the passers-by through this Egyptian scene\r\nwith its strident, monotonous note.\r\n\r\nFor about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man\r\nand his wife, with two servants,—a chambermaid named Trinette, and a\r\nhostler called Pecaud. This small staff was quite equal to all the\r\nrequirements, for a canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes had\r\nrevolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and\r\nthe stagecoach. And, as though to add to the daily misery which this\r\nprosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper, whose utter\r\nruin it was fast accomplishing, it was situated between the Rhône from\r\nwhich it had its source and the post-road it had depleted, not a\r\nhundred steps from the inn, of which we have given a brief but faithful\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty-five years of\r\nage, tall, strong, and bony, a perfect specimen of the natives of those\r\nsouthern latitudes; he had dark, sparkling, and deep-set eyes, hooked\r\nnose, and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal; his hair, like\r\nhis beard, which he wore under his chin, was thick and curly, and in\r\nspite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads.\r\nHis naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of\r\nbrown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing\r\nhimself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door, on the\r\nlookout for guests who seldom came, yet there he stood, day after day,\r\nexposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun, with no other\r\nprotection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it,\r\nafter the manner of the Spanish muleteers. This man was our old\r\nacquaintance, Gaspard Caderousse.\r\n\r\nHis wife, on the contrary, whose maiden name had been Madeleine\r\nRadelle, was pale, meagre, and sickly-looking. Born in the neighborhood\r\nof Arles, she had shared in the beauty for which its women are\r\nproverbial; but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the\r\ndevastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by\r\nthe ponds of Aiguemortes and the marshes of Camargue. She remained\r\nnearly always in her second-floor chamber, shivering in her chair, or\r\nstretched languid and feeble on her bed, while her husband kept his\r\ndaily watch at the door—a duty he performed with so much the greater\r\nwillingness, as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless\r\nplaints and murmurs of his helpmate, who never saw him without breaking\r\nout into bitter invectives against fate; to all of which her husband\r\nwould calmly return an unvarying reply, in these philosophic words:\r\n\r\n“Hush, La Carconte. It is God’s pleasure that things should be so.”\r\n\r\nThe sobriquet of La Carconte had been bestowed on Madeleine Radelle\r\nfrom the fact that she had been born in a village, so called, situated\r\nbetween Salon and Lambesc; and as a custom existed among the\r\ninhabitants of that part of France where Caderousse lived of styling\r\nevery person by some particular and distinctive appellation, her\r\nhusband had bestowed on her the name of La Carconte in place of her\r\nsweet and euphonious name of Madeleine, which, in all probability, his\r\nrude guttural language would not have enabled him to pronounce.\r\n\r\nStill, let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to\r\nthe will of Providence, the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under\r\nthe double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers\r\nand his profits, and the daily infliction of his peevish partner’s\r\nmurmurs and lamentations.\r\n\r\n0323m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike other dwellers in the south, he was a man of sober habits and\r\nmoderate desires, but fond of external show, vain, and addicted to\r\ndisplay. During the days of his prosperity, not a festivity took place\r\nwithout himself and wife being among the spectators. He dressed in the\r\npicturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the\r\nsouth of France, bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by\r\nthe Catalans and Andalusians; while La Carconte displayed the charming\r\nfashion prevalent among the women of Arles, a mode of attire borrowed\r\nequally from Greece and Arabia. But, by degrees, watch-chains,\r\nnecklaces, parti-colored scarves, embroidered bodices, velvet vests,\r\nelegantly worked stockings, striped gaiters, and silver buckles for the\r\nshoes, all disappeared; and Gaspard Caderousse, unable to appear abroad\r\nin his pristine splendor, had given up any further participation in the\r\npomps and vanities, both for himself and wife, although a bitter\r\nfeeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and\r\nmerry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable\r\nhostelry to which he still clung, more for the shelter than the profit\r\nit afforded.\r\n\r\nCaderousse, then, was, as usual, at his place of observation before the\r\ndoor, his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven\r\ngrass—on which some fowls were industriously, though fruitlessly,\r\nendeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate—to\r\nthe deserted road, which led away to the north and south, when he was\r\naroused by the shrill voice of his wife, and grumbling to himself as he\r\nwent, he mounted to her chamber, first taking care, however, to set the\r\nentrance door wide open, as an invitation to any chance traveller who\r\nmight be passing.\r\n\r\nAt the moment Caderousse quitted his sentry-like watch before the door,\r\nthe road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely\r\nas a desert at midday. There it lay stretching out into one\r\ninterminable line of dust and sand, with its sides bordered by tall,\r\nmeagre trees, altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance, that\r\nno one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller, at liberty\r\nto regulate his hours for journeying, would choose to expose himself in\r\nsuch a formidable Sahara.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, had Caderousse but retained his post a few minutes\r\nlonger, he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching\r\nfrom the direction of Bellegarde; as the moving object drew nearer,\r\nhe would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse,\r\nbetween whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared\r\nto exist. The horse was of Hungarian breed, and ambled along at an\r\neasy pace. His rider was a priest, dressed in black, and wearing a\r\nthree-cornered hat; and, despite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun,\r\nthe pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived before the Pont du Gard, the horse stopped, but whether\r\nfor his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to\r\nsay. However that might have been, the priest, dismounting, led his\r\nsteed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure\r\nhim. Availing himself of a handle that projected from a half-fallen\r\ndoor, he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton\r\nhandkerchief, from his pocket, wiped away the perspiration that\r\nstreamed from his brow, then, advancing to the door, struck thrice with\r\nthe end of his iron-shod stick.\r\n\r\nAt this unusual sound, a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring\r\nassailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode, snarling and displaying his\r\nsharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved\r\nhow little he was accustomed to society. At that moment a heavy\r\nfootstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the\r\nupper floor, and, with many bows and courteous smiles, the host of the\r\nPont du Gard besought his guest to enter.\r\n\r\n0319m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You are welcome, sir, most welcome!” repeated the astonished\r\nCaderousse. “Now, then, Margotin,” cried he, speaking to the dog, “will\r\nyou be quiet? Pray don’t heed him, sir!—he only barks, he never bites.\r\nI make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this\r\ndreadfully hot day.” Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the\r\ntraveller he had to entertain, Caderousse hastily exclaimed: “A\r\nthousand pardons! I really did not observe whom I had the honor to\r\nreceive under my poor roof. What would the abbé please to have? What\r\nrefreshment can I offer? All I have is at his service.”\r\n\r\nThe priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching\r\ngaze—there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar\r\nscrutiny on the part of the innkeeper; then, observing in the\r\ncountenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at\r\nhis own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded, he\r\ndeemed it as well to terminate this dumb show, and therefore said,\r\nspeaking with a strong Italian accent, “You are, I presume, M.\r\nCaderousse?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” answered the host, even more surprised at the question than\r\nhe had been by the silence which had preceded it; “I am Gaspard\r\nCaderousse, at your service.”\r\n\r\n“Gaspard Caderousse,” rejoined the priest. “Yes,—Christian and surname\r\nare the same. You formerly lived, I believe in the Allées de Meilhan,\r\non the fourth floor?”\r\n\r\n0325m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I did.”\r\n\r\n“And you followed the business of a tailor?”\r\n\r\n“True, I was a tailor, till the trade fell off. It is so hot at\r\nMarseilles, that really I believe that the respectable inhabitants will\r\nin time go without any clothing whatever. But talking of heat, is there\r\nnothing I can offer you by way of refreshment?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; let me have a bottle of your best wine, and then, with your\r\npermission, we will resume our conversation from where we left off.”\r\n\r\n“As you please, sir,” said Caderousse, who, anxious not to lose the\r\npresent opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of\r\nCahors still remaining in his possession, hastily raised a trap-door in\r\nthe floor of the apartment they were in, which served both as parlor\r\nand kitchen.\r\n\r\nUpon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of\r\nfive minutes, he found the abbé seated upon a wooden stool, leaning his\r\nelbow on a table, while Margotin, whose animosity seemed appeased by\r\nthe unusual command of the traveller for refreshments, had crept up to\r\nhim, and had established himself very comfortably between his knees,\r\nhis long, skinny neck resting on his lap, while his dim eye was fixed\r\nearnestly on the traveller’s face.\r\n\r\n“Are you quite alone?” inquired the guest, as Caderousse placed before\r\nhim the bottle of wine and a glass.\r\n\r\n“Quite, quite alone,” replied the man—“or, at least, practically so,\r\nfor my poor wife, who is the only person in the house besides myself,\r\nis laid up with illness, and unable to render me the least assistance,\r\npoor thing!”\r\n\r\n“You are married, then?” said the priest, with a show of interest,\r\nglancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment.\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir,” said Caderousse with a sigh, “it is easy to perceive I am\r\nnot a rich man; but in this world a man does not thrive the better for\r\nbeing honest.” The abbé fixed on him a searching, penetrating glance.\r\n\r\n“Yes, honest—I can certainly say that much for myself,” continued the\r\ninnkeeper, fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé’s gaze; “I can\r\nboast with truth of being an honest man; and,” continued he\r\nsignificantly, with a hand on his breast and shaking his head, “that is\r\nmore than everyone can say nowadays.”\r\n\r\n0327m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“So much the better for you, if what you assert be true,” said the\r\nabbé; “for I am firmly persuaded that, sooner or later, the good will\r\nbe rewarded, and the wicked punished.”\r\n\r\n“Such words as those belong to your profession,” answered Caderousse,\r\n“and you do well to repeat them; but,” added he, with a bitter\r\nexpression of countenance, “one is free to believe them or not, as one\r\npleases.”\r\n\r\n“You are wrong to speak thus,” said the abbé; “and perhaps I may, in my\r\nown person, be able to prove to you how completely you are in error.”\r\n\r\n“What mean you?” inquired Caderousse with a look of surprise.\r\n\r\n“In the first place, I must be satisfied that you are the person I am\r\nin search of.”\r\n\r\n“What proofs do you require?”\r\n\r\n“Did you, in the year 1814 or 1815, know anything of a young sailor\r\nnamed Dantès?”\r\n\r\n“Dantès? Did I know poor dear Edmond? Why, Edmond Dantès and myself\r\nwere intimate friends!” exclaimed Caderousse, whose countenance flushed\r\ndarkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him,\r\nwhile the clear, calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with\r\nfeverish scrutiny.\r\n\r\n“You remind me,” said the priest, “that the young man concerning whom I\r\nasked you was said to bear the name of Edmond.”\r\n\r\n“Said to bear the name!” repeated Caderousse, becoming excited and\r\neager. “Why, he was so called as truly as I myself bore the appellation\r\nof Gaspard Caderousse; but tell me, I pray, what has become of poor\r\nEdmond? Did you know him? Is he alive and at liberty? Is he prosperous\r\nand happy?”\r\n\r\n“He died a more wretched, hopeless, heart-broken prisoner than the\r\nfelons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of Toulon.”\r\n\r\nA deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse,\r\nwho turned away, and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes\r\nwith the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head.\r\n\r\n“Poor fellow, poor fellow!” murmured Caderousse. “Well, there, sir, is\r\nanother proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth, and\r\nthat none but the wicked prosper. Ah,” continued Caderousse, speaking\r\nin the highly colored language of the South, “the world grows worse and\r\nworse. Why does not God, if he really hates the wicked, as he is said\r\nto do, send down brimstone and fire, and consume them altogether?”\r\n\r\n“You speak as though you had loved this young Dantès,” observed the\r\nabbé, without taking any notice of his companion’s vehemence.\r\n\r\n“And so I did,” replied Caderousse; “though once, I confess, I envied\r\nhim his good fortune. But I swear to you, sir, I swear to you, by\r\neverything a man holds dear, I have, since then, deeply and sincerely\r\nlamented his unhappy fate.”\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence, during which the fixed, searching eye of the\r\nabbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the\r\ninnkeeper.\r\n\r\n“You knew the poor lad, then?” continued Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“I was called to see him on his dying bed, that I might administer to\r\nhim the consolations of religion.”\r\n\r\n“And of what did he die?” asked Caderousse in a choking voice.\r\n\r\n“Of what, think you, do young and strong men die in prison, when they\r\nhave scarcely numbered their thirtieth year, unless it be of\r\nimprisonment?” Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration\r\nthat gathered on his brow.\r\n\r\n0329m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“But the strangest part of the story is,” resumed the abbé, “that\r\nDantès, even in his dying moments, swore by his crucified Redeemer,\r\nthat he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention.”\r\n\r\n“And so he was,” murmured Caderousse. “How should he have been\r\notherwise? Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.”\r\n\r\n“And for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he\r\nhad never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any\r\nfoul spot or stain have fallen on it.”\r\n\r\nAnd here the look of the abbé, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to\r\nrest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was\r\nrapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“A rich Englishman,” continued the abbé, “who had been his companion in\r\nmisfortune, but had been released from prison during the second\r\nrestoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he\r\nbestowed on Dantès upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of his\r\ngratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dantès had\r\nnursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement.\r\nInstead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers,\r\nwho might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor,\r\nDantès carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of\r\nprison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a\r\ndiamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune.”\r\n\r\n“Then, I suppose,” asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, “that\r\nit was a stone of immense value?”\r\n\r\n“Why, everything is relative,” answered the abbé. “To one in Edmond’s\r\nposition the diamond certainly was of great value. It was estimated at\r\nfifty thousand francs.”\r\n\r\n“Bless me!” exclaimed Caderousse, “fifty thousand francs! Surely the\r\ndiamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the abbé, “it was not of such a size as that; but you\r\nshall judge for yourself. I have it with me.”\r\n\r\nThe sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the\r\npriest’s garments, as though hoping to discover the location of the\r\ntreasure. Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with\r\nblack shagreen, the abbé opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes\r\nof Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of\r\nadmirable workmanship.\r\n\r\n“And that diamond,” cried Caderousse, almost breathless with eager\r\nadmiration, “you say, is worth fifty thousand francs?”\r\n\r\n“It is, without the setting, which is also valuable,” replied the abbé,\r\nas he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its\r\nbrilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated\r\ninnkeeper.\r\n\r\n“But how comes the diamond in your possession, sir? Did Edmond make you\r\nhis heir?”\r\n\r\n“No, merely his testamentary executor. ‘I once possessed four dear and\r\nfaithful friends, besides the maiden to whom I was betrothed’ he said;\r\n‘and I feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss.\r\nThe name of one of the four friends is Caderousse.’” The innkeeper\r\nshivered.\r\n\r\n“‘Another of the number,’” continued the abbé, without seeming to\r\nnotice the emotion of Caderousse, “‘is called Danglars; and the third,\r\nin spite of being my rival, entertained a very sincere affection for\r\nme.’”\r\n\r\nA fiendish smile played over the features of Caderousse, who was about\r\nto break in upon the abbé’s speech, when the latter, waving his hand,\r\nsaid, “Allow me to finish first, and then if you have any observations\r\nto make, you can do so afterwards. ‘The third of my friends, although\r\nmy rival, was much attached to me,—his name was Fernand; that of my\r\nbetrothed was’—Stay, stay,” continued the abbé, “I have forgotten what\r\nhe called her.”\r\n\r\n“Mercédès,” said Caderousse eagerly.\r\n\r\n“True,” said the abbé, with a stifled sigh, “Mercédès it was.”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” urged Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“Bring me a _carafe_ of water,” said the abbé.\r\n\r\nCaderousse quickly performed the stranger’s bidding; and after pouring\r\nsome into a glass, and slowly swallowing its contents, the abbé,\r\nresuming his usual placidity of manner, said, as he placed his empty\r\nglass on the table:\r\n\r\n“Where did we leave off?”\r\n\r\n“The name of Edmond’s betrothed was Mercédès.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure. ‘You will go to Marseilles,’ said Dantès,—for you\r\nunderstand, I repeat his words just as he uttered them. Do you\r\nunderstand?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly.”\r\n\r\n“‘You will sell this diamond; you will divide the money into five equal\r\nparts, and give an equal portion to these good friends, the only\r\npersons who have loved me upon earth.’”\r\n\r\n“But why into five parts?” asked Caderousse; “you only mentioned four\r\npersons.”\r\n\r\n“Because the fifth is dead, as I hear. The fifth sharer in Edmond’s\r\nbequest, was his own father.”\r\n\r\n“Too true, too true!” ejaculated Caderousse, almost suffocated by the\r\ncontending passions which assailed him, “the poor old man did die.”\r\n\r\n“I learned so much at Marseilles,” replied the abbé, making a strong\r\neffort to appear indifferent; “but from the length of time that has\r\nelapsed since the death of the elder Dantès, I was unable to obtain any\r\nparticulars of his end. Can you enlighten me on that point?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know who could if I could not,” said Caderousse. “Why, I\r\nlived almost on the same floor with the poor old man. Ah, yes, about a\r\nyear after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died.”\r\n\r\n“Of what did he die?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the doctors called his complaint gastro-enteritis, I believe; his\r\nacquaintances say he died of grief; but I, who saw him in his dying\r\nmoments, I say he died of——”\r\n\r\nCaderousse paused.\r\n\r\n“Of what?” asked the priest, anxiously and eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Why, of downright starvation.”\r\n\r\n“Starvation!” exclaimed the abbé, springing from his seat. “Why, the\r\nvilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that. The\r\nvery dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some\r\npitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread; and that a man, a\r\nChristian, should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other\r\nmen who call themselves Christians, is too horrible for belief. Oh, it\r\nis impossible!—utterly impossible!”\r\n\r\n“What I have said, I have said,” answered Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“And you are a fool for having said anything about it,” said a voice\r\nfrom the top of the stairs. “Why should you meddle with what does not\r\nconcern you?”\r\n\r\nThe two men turned quickly, and saw the sickly countenance of La\r\nCarconte peering between the baluster rails; attracted by the sound of\r\nvoices, she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs, and, seated on\r\nthe lower step, head on knees, she had listened to the foregoing\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“Mind your own business, wife,” replied Caderousse sharply. “This\r\ngentleman asks me for information, which common politeness will not\r\npermit me to refuse.”\r\n\r\n“Politeness, you simpleton!” retorted La Carconte. “What have you to do\r\nwith politeness, I should like to know? Better study a little common\r\nprudence. How do you know the motives that person may have for trying\r\nto extract all he can from you?”\r\n\r\n“I pledge you my word, madam,” said the abbé, “that my intentions are\r\ngood; and that your husband can incur no risk, provided he answers me\r\ncandidly.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that’s all very fine,” retorted the woman. “Nothing is easier than\r\nto begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear; but when\r\npoor, silly folks, like my husband there, have been persuaded to tell\r\nall they know, the promises and assurances of safety are quickly\r\nforgotten; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it, behold\r\ntrouble and misery, and all sorts of persecutions, are heaped on the\r\nunfortunate wretches, who cannot even see whence all their afflictions\r\ncome.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, nay, my good woman, make yourself perfectly easy, I beg of you.\r\nWhatever evils may befall you, they will not be occasioned by my\r\ninstrumentality, that I solemnly promise you.”\r\n\r\nLa Carconte muttered a few inarticulate words, then let her head again\r\ndrop upon her knees, and went into a fit of ague, leaving the two\r\nspeakers to resume the conversation, but remaining so as to be able to\r\nhear every word they uttered. Again the abbé had been obliged to\r\nswallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to\r\noverpower him.\r\n\r\nWhen he had sufficiently recovered himself, he said, “It appears, then,\r\nthat the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by\r\neveryone. Surely, had not such been the case, he would not have\r\nperished by so dreadful a death.”\r\n\r\n“Why, he was not altogether forsaken,” continued Caderousse, “for\r\nMercédès the Catalan and Monsieur Morrel were very kind to him; but\r\nsomehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for\r\nFernand—the very person,” added Caderousse with a bitter smile, “that\r\nyou named just now as being one of Dantès’ faithful and attached\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\n“And was he not so?” asked the abbé.\r\n\r\n“Gaspard, Gaspard!” murmured the woman, from her seat on the stairs,\r\n“mind what you are saying!”\r\n\r\nCaderousse made no reply to these words, though evidently irritated and\r\nannoyed by the interruption, but, addressing the abbé, said, “Can a man\r\nbe faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself?\r\nBut Dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature, that he\r\nbelieved everybody’s professions of friendship. Poor Edmond, he was\r\ncruelly deceived; but it was fortunate that he never knew, or he might\r\nhave found it more difficult, when on his deathbed, to pardon his\r\nenemies. And, whatever people may say,” continued Caderousse, in his\r\nnative language, which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry, “I\r\ncannot help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the\r\ndead than the hatred of the living.”\r\n\r\n“Imbecile!” exclaimed La Carconte.\r\n\r\n“Do you, then, know in what manner Fernand injured Dantès?” inquired\r\nthe abbé of Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“Do I? No one better.”\r\n\r\n“Speak out then, say what it was!”\r\n\r\n“Gaspard!” cried La Carconte, “do as you will; you are master—but if\r\nyou take my advice you’ll hold your tongue.”\r\n\r\n“Well, wife,” replied Caderousse, “I don’t know but what you’re right!”\r\n\r\n“So you will say nothing?” asked the abbé.\r\n\r\n“Why, what good would it do?” asked Caderousse. “If the poor lad were\r\nliving, and came to me and begged that I would candidly tell which were\r\nhis true and which his false friends, why, perhaps, I should not\r\nhesitate. But you tell me he is no more, and therefore can have nothing\r\nto do with hatred or revenge, so let all such feeling be buried with\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“You prefer, then,” said the abbé, “that I should bestow on men you say\r\nare false and treacherous, the reward intended for faithful\r\nfriendship?”\r\n\r\n“That is true enough,” returned Caderousse. “You say truly, the gift of\r\npoor Edmond was not meant for such traitors as Fernand and Danglars;\r\nbesides, what would it be to them? no more than a drop of water in the\r\nocean.”\r\n\r\n“Remember,” chimed in La Carconte, “those two could crush you at a\r\nsingle blow!”\r\n\r\n“How so?” inquired the abbé. “Are these persons, then, so rich and\r\npowerful?”\r\n\r\n“Do you not know their history?”\r\n\r\n“I do not. Pray relate it to me!”\r\n\r\nCaderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments, then said, “No, truly,\r\nit would take up too much time.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my good friend,” returned the abbé, in a tone that indicated\r\nutter indifference on his part, “you are at liberty, either to speak or\r\nbe silent, just as you please; for my own part, I respect your scruples\r\nand admire your sentiments; so let the matter end. I shall do my duty\r\nas conscientiously as I can, and fulfil my promise to the dying man. My\r\nfirst business will be to dispose of this diamond.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket, opened\r\nit, and contrived to hold it in such a light, that a bright flash of\r\nbrilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“Wife, wife!” cried he in a hoarse voice, “come here!”\r\n\r\n“Diamond!” exclaimed La Carconte, rising and descending to the chamber\r\nwith a tolerably firm step; “what diamond are you talking about?”\r\n\r\n“Why, did you not hear all we said?” inquired Caderousse. “It is a\r\nbeautiful diamond left by poor Edmond Dantès, to be sold, and the money\r\ndivided between his father, Mercédès, his betrothed bride, Fernand,\r\nDanglars, and myself. The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand\r\nfrancs.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a magnificent jewel!” cried the astonished woman.\r\n\r\n“The fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then, does\r\nit not?” asked Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“It does,” replied the abbé; “with the addition of an equal division of\r\nthat part intended for the elder Dantès, which I believe myself at\r\nliberty to divide equally with the four survivors.”\r\n\r\n“And why among us four?” inquired Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“As being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t call those friends who betray and ruin you,” murmured the wife\r\nin her turn, in a low, muttering voice.\r\n\r\n“Of course not!” rejoined Caderousse quickly; “no more do I, and that\r\nwas what I was observing to this gentleman just now. I said I looked\r\nupon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery, perhaps\r\ncrime.”\r\n\r\n“Remember,” answered the abbé calmly, as he replaced the jewel and its\r\ncase in the pocket of his cassock, “it is your fault, not mine, that I\r\ndo so. You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of\r\nboth Fernand and Danglars, in order that I may execute Edmond’s last\r\nwishes.”\r\n\r\nThe agitation of Caderousse became extreme, and large drops of\r\nperspiration rolled from his heated brow. As he saw the abbé rise from\r\nhis seat and go towards the door, as though to ascertain if his horse\r\nwere sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey, Caderousse and his\r\nwife exchanged looks of deep meaning.\r\n\r\n0335m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“There, you see, wife,” said the former, “this splendid diamond might\r\nall be ours, if we chose!”\r\n\r\n“Do you believe it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied La Carconte, “do as you like. For my part, I wash my\r\nhands of the affair.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber,\r\nher body convulsed with chills, and her teeth rattling in her head, in\r\nspite of the intense heat of the weather. Arrived at the top stair, she\r\nturned round, and called out, in a warning tone, to her husband,\r\n“Gaspard, consider well what you are about to do!”\r\n\r\n“I have both reflected and decided,” answered he.\r\n\r\nLa Carconte then entered her chamber, the flooring of which creaked\r\nbeneath her heavy, uncertain tread, as she proceeded towards her\r\narmchair, into which she fell as though exhausted.\r\n\r\n“Well,” asked the abbé, as he returned to the apartment below, “what\r\nhave you made up your mind to do?”\r\n\r\n“To tell you all I know,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“I certainly think you act wisely in so doing,” said the priest. “Not\r\nbecause I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to\r\nconceal from me, but simply that if, through your assistance, I could\r\ndistribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator, why, so\r\nmuch the better, that is all.”\r\n\r\n“I hope it may be so,” replied Caderousse, his face flushed with\r\ncupidity.\r\n\r\n“I am all attention,” said the abbé.\r\n\r\n“Stop a minute,” answered Caderousse; “we might be interrupted in the\r\nmost interesting part of my story, which would be a pity; and it is as\r\nwell that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he went stealthily to the door, which he closed, and,\r\nby way of still greater precaution, bolted and barred it, as he was\r\naccustomed to do at night.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his\r\nease. He removed his seat into a corner of the room, where he himself\r\nwould be in deep shadow, while the light would be fully thrown on the\r\nnarrator; then, with head bent down and hands clasped, or rather\r\nclenched together, he prepared to give his whole attention to\r\nCaderousse, who seated himself on the little stool, exactly opposite to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Remember, this is no affair of mine,” said the trembling voice of La\r\nCarconte, as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the\r\nscene that was enacting below.\r\n\r\n“Enough, enough!” replied Caderousse; “say no more about it; I will\r\ntake all the consequences upon myself.”\r\n\r\nAnd he began his story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 27. The Story\r\n\r\nFirst, sir,” said Caderousse, “you must make me a promise.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” inquired the abbé.\r\n\r\n“Why, if you ever make use of the details I am about to give you, that\r\nyou will never let anyone know that it was I who supplied them; for the\r\npersons of whom I am about to talk are rich and powerful, and if they\r\nonly laid the tips of their fingers on me, I should break to pieces\r\nlike glass.”\r\n\r\n“Make yourself easy, my friend,” replied the abbé. “I am a priest, and\r\nconfessions die in my breast. Recollect, our only desire is to carry\r\nout, in a fitting manner, the last wishes of our friend. Speak, then,\r\nwithout reserve, as without hatred; tell the truth, the whole truth; I\r\ndo not know, never may know, the persons of whom you are about to\r\nspeak; besides, I am an Italian, and not a Frenchman, and belong to\r\nGod, and not to man, and I shall shortly retire to my convent, which I\r\nhave only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man.”\r\n\r\nThis positive assurance seemed to give Caderousse a little courage.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, under these circumstances,” said Caderousse, “I will, I\r\neven believe I ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor\r\nEdmond thought so sincere and unquestionable.”\r\n\r\n“Begin with his father, if you please.” said the abbé; “Edmond talked\r\nto me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love.”\r\n\r\n“The history is a sad one, sir,” said Caderousse, shaking his head;\r\n“perhaps you know all the earlier part of it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.” answered the abbé; “Edmond related to me everything until the\r\nmoment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to Marseilles.”\r\n\r\n“At La Réserve! Oh, yes; I can see it all before me this moment.”\r\n\r\n“Was it not his betrothal feast?”\r\n\r\n“It was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending;\r\na police commissary, followed by four soldiers, entered, and Dantès was\r\narrested.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and up to this point I know all,” said the priest. “Dantès\r\nhimself only knew that which personally concerned him, for he never\r\nbeheld again the five persons I have named to you, or heard mention of\r\nanyone of them.”\r\n\r\n“Well, when Dantès was arrested, Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the\r\nparticulars, and they were very sad. The old man returned alone to his\r\nhome, folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes, and paced up\r\nand down his chamber the whole day, and would not go to bed at all, for\r\nI was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night; and for\r\nmyself, I assure you I could not sleep either, for the grief of the\r\npoor father gave me great uneasiness, and every step he took went to my\r\nheart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast.\r\n\r\n“The next day Mercédès came to implore the protection of M. de\r\nVillefort; she did not obtain it, however, and went to visit the old\r\nman; when she saw him so miserable and heart-broken, having passed a\r\nsleepless night, and not touched food since the previous day, she\r\nwished him to go with her that she might take care of him; but the old\r\nman would not consent. ‘No,’ was the old man’s reply, ‘I will not leave\r\nthis house, for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the\r\nworld; and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first\r\nthing, and what would he think if I did not wait here for him?’ I heard\r\nall this from the window, for I was anxious that Mercédès should\r\npersuade the old man to accompany her, for his footsteps over my head\r\nnight and day did not leave me a moment’s repose.”\r\n\r\n“But did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man?”\r\nasked the abbé.\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir,” replied Caderousse, “we cannot console those who will not be\r\nconsoled, and he was one of these; besides, I know not why, but he\r\nseemed to dislike seeing me. One night, however, I heard his sobs, and\r\nI could not resist my desire to go up to him, but when I reached his\r\ndoor he was no longer weeping but praying. I cannot now repeat to you,\r\nsir, all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of; it\r\nwas more than piety, it was more than grief, and I, who am no canter,\r\nand hate the Jesuits, said then to myself, ‘It is really well, and I am\r\nvery glad that I have not any children; for if I were a father and felt\r\nsuch excessive grief as the old man does, and did not find in my memory\r\nor heart all he is now saying, I should throw myself into the sea at\r\nonce, for I could not bear it.’”\r\n\r\n“Poor father!” murmured the priest.\r\n\r\n“From day to day he lived on alone, and more and more solitary. M.\r\nMorrel and Mercédès came to see him, but his door was closed; and,\r\nalthough I was certain he was at home, he would not make any answer.\r\nOne day, when, contrary to his custom, he had admitted Mercédès, and\r\nthe poor girl, in spite of her own grief and despair, endeavored to\r\nconsole him, he said to her,—‘Be assured, my dear daughter, he is dead;\r\nand instead of expecting him, it is he who is awaiting us; I am quite\r\nhappy, for I am the oldest, and of course shall see him first.’\r\n\r\n“However well disposed a person may be, why, you see we leave off after\r\na time seeing persons who are in sorrow, they make one melancholy; and\r\nso at last old Dantès was left all to himself, and I only saw from time\r\nto time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle\r\nthey tried to hide; but I guessed what these bundles were, and that he\r\nsold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence. At length the\r\npoor old fellow reached the end of all he had; he owed three quarters’\r\nrent, and they threatened to turn him out; he begged for another week,\r\nwhich was granted to him. I know this, because the landlord came into\r\nmy apartment when he left his.\r\n\r\n“For the first three days I heard him walking about as usual, but, on\r\nthe fourth I heard nothing. I then resolved to go up to him at all\r\nrisks. The door was closed, but I looked through the keyhole, and saw\r\nhim so pale and haggard, that believing him very ill, I went and told\r\nM. Morrel and then ran on to Mercédès. They both came immediately, M.\r\nMorrel bringing a doctor, and the doctor said it was inflammation of\r\nthe bowels, and ordered him a limited diet. I was there, too, and I\r\nnever shall forget the old man’s smile at this prescription.\r\n\r\n“From that time he received all who came; he had an excuse for not\r\neating any more; the doctor had put him on a diet.”\r\n\r\nThe abbé uttered a kind of groan.\r\n\r\n“The story interests you, does it not, sir?” inquired Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the abbé, “it is very affecting.”\r\n\r\n“Mercédès came again, and she found him so altered that she was even\r\nmore anxious than before to have him taken to her own home. This was M.\r\nMorrel’s wish also, who would fain have conveyed the old man against\r\nhis consent; but the old man resisted, and cried so that they were\r\nactually frightened. Mercédès remained, therefore, by his bedside, and\r\nM. Morrel went away, making a sign to the Catalan that he had left his\r\npurse on the chimney-piece; but, availing himself of the doctor’s\r\norder, the old man would not take any sustenance; at length (after nine\r\ndays of despair and fasting), the old man died, cursing those who had\r\ncaused his misery, and saying to Mercédès, ‘If you ever see my Edmond\r\nagain, tell him I die blessing him.’”\r\n\r\nThe abbé rose from his chair, made two turns round the chamber, and\r\npressed his trembling hand against his parched throat.\r\n\r\n“And you believe he died——”\r\n\r\n“Of hunger, sir, of hunger,” said Caderousse. “I am as certain of it as\r\nthat we two are Christians.”\r\n\r\nThe abbé, with a shaking hand, seized a glass of water that was\r\nstanding by him half-full, swallowed it at one gulp, and then resumed\r\nhis seat, with red eyes and pale cheeks.\r\n\r\n“This was, indeed, a horrid event,” said he in a hoarse voice.\r\n\r\n“The more so, sir, as it was men’s and not God’s doing.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me of those men,” said the abbé, “and remember too,” he added in\r\nan almost menacing tone, “you have promised to tell me everything. Tell\r\nme, therefore, who are these men who killed the son with despair, and\r\nthe father with famine?”\r\n\r\n“Two men jealous of him, sir; one from love, and the other from\r\nambition,—Fernand and Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“How was this jealousy manifested? Speak on.”\r\n\r\n“They denounced Edmond as a Bonapartist agent.”\r\n\r\n“Which of the two denounced him? Which was the real delinquent?”\r\n\r\n“Both, sir; one with a letter, and the other put it in the post.”\r\n\r\n“And where was this letter written?”\r\n\r\n“At La Réserve, the day before the betrothal feast.”\r\n\r\n“’Twas so, then—’twas so, then,” murmured the abbé. “Oh, Faria, Faria,\r\nhow well did you judge men and things!”\r\n\r\n“What did you please to say, sir?” asked Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, nothing,” replied the priest; “go on.”\r\n\r\n“It was Danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand, that\r\nhis writing might not be recognized, and Fernand who put it in the\r\npost.”\r\n\r\n“But,” exclaimed the abbé suddenly, “you were there yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I!” said Caderousse, astonished; “who told you I was there?”\r\n\r\nThe abbé saw he had overshot the mark, and he added quickly,—“No one;\r\nbut in order to have known everything so well, you must have been an\r\neye-witness.”\r\n\r\n“True, true!” said Caderousse in a choking voice, “I was there.”\r\n\r\n“And did you not remonstrate against such infamy?” asked the abbé; “if\r\nnot, you were an accomplice.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied Caderousse, “they had made me drink to such an excess\r\nthat I nearly lost all perception. I had only an indistinct\r\nunderstanding of what was passing around me. I said all that a man in\r\nsuch a state could say; but they both assured me that it was a jest\r\nthey were carrying on, and perfectly harmless.”\r\n\r\n“Next day—next day, sir, you must have seen plain enough what they had\r\nbeen doing, yet you said nothing, though you were present when Dantès\r\nwas arrested.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, I was there, and very anxious to speak; but Danglars\r\nrestrained me. ‘If he should really be guilty,’ said he, ‘and did\r\nreally put in to the Island of Elba; if he is really charged with a\r\nletter for the Bonapartist committee at Paris, and if they find this\r\nletter upon him, those who have supported him will pass for his\r\naccomplices.’ I confess I had my fears, in the state in which politics\r\nthen were, and I held my tongue. It was cowardly, I confess, but it was\r\nnot criminal.”\r\n\r\n0341m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I understand—you allowed matters to take their course, that was all.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” answered Caderousse; “and remorse preys on me night and\r\nday. I often ask pardon of God, I swear to you, because this action,\r\nthe only one with which I have seriously to reproach myself in all my\r\nlife, is no doubt the cause of my abject condition. I am expiating a\r\nmoment of selfishness, and so I always say to La Carconte, when she\r\ncomplains, ‘Hold your tongue, woman; it is the will of God.’” And\r\nCaderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” said the abbé, “you have spoken unreservedly; and thus to\r\naccuse yourself is to deserve pardon.”\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately, Edmond is dead, and has not pardoned me.”\r\n\r\n“He did not know,” said the abbé.\r\n\r\n“But he knows it all now,” interrupted Caderousse; “they say the dead\r\nknow everything.”\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence; the abbé rose and paced up and down\r\npensively, and then resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n“You have two or three times mentioned a M. Morrel,” he said; “who was\r\nhe?”\r\n\r\n“The owner of the _Pharaon_ and patron of Dantès.”\r\n\r\n“And what part did he play in this sad drama?” inquired the abbé.\r\n\r\n“The part of an honest man, full of courage and real regard. Twenty\r\ntimes he interceded for Edmond. When the emperor returned, he wrote,\r\nimplored, threatened, and so energetically, that on the second\r\nrestoration he was persecuted as a Bonapartist. Ten times, as I told\r\nyou, he came to see Dantès’ father, and offered to receive him in his\r\nown house; and the night or two before his death, as I have already\r\nsaid, he left his purse on the mantelpiece, with which they paid the\r\nold man’s debts, and buried him decently; and so Edmond’s father died,\r\nas he had lived, without doing harm to anyone. I have the purse still\r\nby me—a large one, made of red silk.”\r\n\r\n“And,” asked the abbé, “is M. Morrel still alive?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“In that case,” replied the abbé, “he should be a man blessed of God,\r\nrich, happy.”\r\n\r\nCaderousse smiled bitterly. “Yes, happy as myself,” said he.\r\n\r\n“What! M. Morrel unhappy?” exclaimed the abbé.\r\n\r\n“He is reduced almost to the last extremity—nay, he is almost at the\r\npoint of dishonor.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” continued Caderousse, “so it is; after five-and-twenty years of\r\nlabor, after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of\r\nMarseilles, M. Morrel is utterly ruined; he has lost five ships in two\r\nyears, has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses, and his\r\nonly hope now is in that very _Pharaon_ which poor Dantès commanded,\r\nand which is expected from the Indies with a cargo of cochineal and\r\nindigo. If this ship founders, like the others, he is a ruined man.”\r\n\r\n“And has the unfortunate man wife or children?” inquired the abbé.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he has a wife, who through everything has behaved like an angel;\r\nhe has a daughter, who was about to marry the man she loved, but whose\r\nfamily now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man; he\r\nhas, besides, a son, a lieutenant in the army; and, as you may suppose,\r\nall this, instead of lessening, only augments his sorrows. If he were\r\nalone in the world he would blow out his brains, and there would be an\r\nend.”\r\n\r\n“Horrible!” ejaculated the priest.\r\n\r\n“And it is thus heaven recompenses virtue, sir,” added Caderousse. “You\r\nsee, I, who never did a bad action but that I have told you of—am in\r\ndestitution, with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes, and\r\nI unable to do anything in the world for her; I shall die of hunger, as\r\nold Dantès did, while Fernand and Danglars are rolling in wealth.”\r\n\r\n“How is that?”\r\n\r\n“Because their deeds have brought them good fortune, while honest men\r\nhave been reduced to misery.”\r\n\r\n“What has become of Danglars, the instigator, and therefore the most\r\nguilty?”\r\n\r\n“What has become of him? Why, he left Marseilles, and was taken, on the\r\nrecommendation of M. Morrel, who did not know his crime, as cashier\r\ninto a Spanish bank. During the war with Spain he was employed in the\r\ncommissariat of the French army, and made a fortune; then with that\r\nmoney he speculated in the funds, and trebled or quadrupled his\r\ncapital; and, having first married his banker’s daughter, who left him\r\na widower, he has married a second time, a widow, a Madame de Nargonne,\r\ndaughter of M. de Servieux, the king’s chamberlain, who is in high\r\nfavor at court. He is a millionaire, and they have made him a baron,\r\nand now he is the Baron Danglars, with a fine residence in the Rue du\r\nMont-Blanc, with ten horses in his stables, six footmen in his\r\nantechamber, and I know not how many millions in his strongbox.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the abbé, in a peculiar tone, “he is happy.”\r\n\r\n“Happy? Who can answer for that? Happiness or unhappiness is the secret\r\nknown but to one’s self and the walls—walls have ears but no tongue;\r\nbut if a large fortune produces happiness, Danglars is happy.”\r\n\r\n“And Fernand?”\r\n\r\n“Fernand? Why, much the same story.”\r\n\r\n“But how could a poor Catalan fisher-boy, without education or\r\nresources, make a fortune? I confess this staggers me.”\r\n\r\n“And it has staggered everybody. There must have been in his life some\r\nstrange secret that no one knows.”\r\n\r\n“But, then, by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or\r\nhigh position?”\r\n\r\n“Both, sir—he has both fortune and position—both.”\r\n\r\n“This must be impossible!”\r\n\r\n“It would seem so; but listen, and you will understand. Some days\r\nbefore the return of the emperor, Fernand was drafted. The Bourbons\r\nleft him quietly enough at the Catalans, but Napoleon returned, a\r\nspecial levy was made, and Fernand was compelled to join. I went too;\r\nbut as I was older than Fernand, and had just married my poor wife, I\r\nwas only sent to the coast. Fernand was enrolled in the active army,\r\nwent to the frontier with his regiment, and was at the battle of Ligny.\r\nThe night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who\r\ncarried on a secret correspondence with the enemy. That same night the\r\ngeneral was to go over to the English. He proposed to Fernand to\r\naccompany him; Fernand agreed to do so, deserted his post, and followed\r\nthe general.\r\n\r\n“Fernand would have been court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on\r\nthe throne, but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons. He returned to\r\nFrance with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of the\r\ngeneral, who is in the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was a\r\ncaptain in 1823, during the Spanish war—that is to say, at the time\r\nwhen Danglars made his early speculations. Fernand was a Spaniard, and\r\nbeing sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen,\r\nfound Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the\r\nsupport of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received\r\npromises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths\r\nknown to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by\r\nthe royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief\r\ncampaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and\r\nreceived the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion\r\nof Honor.”\r\n\r\n“Destiny! destiny!” murmured the abbé.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but listen: this was not all. The war with Spain being ended,\r\nFernand’s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to\r\nendure throughout Europe. Greece only had risen against Turkey, and had\r\nbegun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards Athens—it\r\nwas the fashion to pity and support the Greeks. The French government,\r\nwithout protecting them openly, as you know, gave countenance to\r\nvolunteer assistance. Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve\r\nin Greece, still having his name kept on the army roll.\r\n\r\n0345m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome time after, it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf (this was the\r\nname he bore) had entered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of\r\ninstructor-general. Ali Pasha was killed, as you know, but before he\r\ndied he recompensed the services of Fernand by leaving him a\r\nconsiderable sum, with which he returned to France, when he was\r\ngazetted lieutenant-general.”\r\n\r\n“So that now——?” inquired the abbé.\r\n\r\n“So that now,” continued Caderousse, “he owns a magnificent house—No.\r\n27, Rue du Helder, Paris.”\r\n\r\nThe abbé opened his mouth, hesitated for a moment, then, making an\r\neffort at self-control, he said, “And Mercédès—they tell me that she\r\nhas disappeared?”\r\n\r\n“Disappeared,” said Caderousse, “yes, as the sun disappears, to rise\r\nthe next day with still more splendor.”\r\n\r\n“Has she made a fortune also?” inquired the abbé, with an ironical\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“Mercédès is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris,”\r\nreplied Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said the abbé; “it seems as if I were listening to the story\r\nof a dream. But I have seen things so extraordinary, that what you tell\r\nme seems less astonishing than it otherwise might.”\r\n\r\n“Mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which\r\ndeprived her of Edmond. I have told you of her attempts to propitiate\r\nM. de Villefort, her devotion to the elder Dantès. In the midst of her\r\ndespair, a new affliction overtook her. This was the departure of\r\nFernand—of Fernand, whose crime she did not know, and whom she regarded\r\nas her brother. Fernand went, and Mercédès remained alone.\r\n\r\n“Three months passed and still she wept—no news of Edmond, no news of\r\nFernand, no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with\r\ndespair. One evening, after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of\r\ntwo roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans, she returned to her\r\nhome more depressed than ever. Suddenly she heard a step she knew,\r\nturned anxiously around, the door opened, and Fernand, dressed in the\r\nuniform of a sub-lieutenant, stood before her.\r\n\r\n“It was not the one she wished for most, but it seemed as if a part of\r\nher past life had returned to her.\r\n\r\n“Mercédès seized Fernand’s hands with a transport which he took for\r\nlove, but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world, and\r\nseeing at last a friend, after long hours of solitary sorrow. And then,\r\nit must be confessed, Fernand had never been hated—he was only not\r\nprecisely loved. Another possessed all Mercédès’ heart; that other was\r\nabsent, had disappeared, perhaps was dead. At this last thought\r\nMercédès burst into a flood of tears, and wrung her hands in agony; but\r\nthe thought, which she had always repelled before when it was suggested\r\nto her by another, came now in full force upon her mind; and then, too,\r\nold Dantès incessantly said to her, ‘Our Edmond is dead; if he were\r\nnot, he would return to us.’\r\n\r\n“The old man died, as I have told you; had he lived, Mercédès,\r\nperchance, had not become the wife of another, for he would have been\r\nthere to reproach her infidelity. Fernand saw this, and when he learned\r\nof the old man’s death he returned. He was now a lieutenant. At his\r\nfirst coming he had not said a word of love to Mercédès; at the second\r\nhe reminded her that he loved her.\r\n\r\n“Mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for\r\nEdmond.”\r\n\r\n“So that,” said the abbé, with a bitter smile, “that makes eighteen\r\nmonths in all. What more could the most devoted lover desire?” Then he\r\nmurmured the words of the English poet, “‘Frailty, thy name is woman.’”\r\n\r\n“Six months afterwards,” continued Caderousse, “the marriage took place\r\nin the church of Accoules.”\r\n\r\n“The very church in which she was to have married Edmond,” murmured the\r\npriest; “there was only a change of bridegrooms.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mercédès was married,” proceeded Caderousse; “but although in\r\nthe eyes of the world she appeared calm, she nearly fainted as she\r\npassed La Réserve, where, eighteen months before, the betrothal had\r\nbeen celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved, had\r\nshe looked to the bottom of her heart. Fernand, more happy, but not\r\nmore at his ease—for I saw at this time he was in constant dread of\r\nEdmond’s return—Fernand was very anxious to get his wife away, and to\r\ndepart himself. There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated\r\nwith the Catalans, and eight days after the wedding they left\r\nMarseilles.”\r\n\r\n“Did you ever see Mercédès again?” inquired the priest.\r\n\r\n“Yes, during the Spanish war, at Perpignan, where Fernand had left her;\r\nshe was attending to the education of her son.”\r\n\r\nThe abbé started. “Her son?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Caderousse, “little Albert.”\r\n\r\n“But, then, to be able to instruct her child,” continued the abbé, “she\r\nmust have received an education herself. I understood from Edmond that\r\nshe was the daughter of a simple fisherman, beautiful but uneducated.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” replied Caderousse, “did he know so little of his lovely\r\nbetrothed? Mercédès might have been a queen, sir, if the crown were to\r\nbe placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent. Fernand’s\r\nfortune was already waxing great, and she developed with his growing\r\nfortune. She learned drawing, music—everything. Besides, I believe,\r\nbetween ourselves, she did this in order to distract her mind, that she\r\nmight forget; and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the\r\nweight on her heart. But now her position in life is assured,”\r\ncontinued Caderousse; “no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her;\r\nshe is rich, a countess, and yet——”\r\n\r\nCaderousse paused.\r\n\r\n“And yet what?” asked the abbé.\r\n\r\n“Yet, I am sure, she is not happy,” said Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“What makes you believe this?”\r\n\r\n“Why, when I found myself utterly destitute, I thought my old friends\r\nwould, perhaps, assist me. So I went to Danglars, who would not even\r\nreceive me. I called on Fernand, who sent me a hundred francs by his\r\nvalet-de-chambre.”\r\n\r\n“Then you did not see either of them?”\r\n\r\n“No, but Madame de Morcerf saw me.”\r\n\r\n“How was that?”\r\n\r\n“As I went away a purse fell at my feet—it contained five-and-twenty\r\nlouis; I raised my head quickly, and saw Mercédès, who at once shut the\r\nblind.”\r\n\r\n“And M. de Villefort?” asked the abbé.\r\n\r\n“Oh, he never was a friend of mine, I did not know him, and I had\r\nnothing to ask of him.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not know what became of him, and the share he had in Edmond’s\r\nmisfortunes?”\r\n\r\n“No; I only know that some time after Edmond’s arrest, he married\r\nMademoiselle de Saint-Méran, and soon after left Marseilles; no doubt\r\nhe has been as lucky as the rest; no doubt he is as rich as Danglars,\r\nas high in station as Fernand. I only, as you see, have remained poor,\r\nwretched, and forgotten.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, my friend,” replied the abbé; “God may seem\r\nsometimes to forget for a time, while his justice reposes, but there\r\nalways comes a moment when he remembers—and behold—a proof!”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the abbé took the diamond from his pocket, and giving it\r\nto Caderousse, said, “Here, my friend, take this diamond, it is yours.”\r\n\r\n“What, for me only?” cried Caderousse, “ah, sir, do not jest with me!”\r\n\r\n“This diamond was to have been shared among his friends. Edmond had one\r\nfriend only, and thus it cannot be divided. Take the diamond, then, and\r\nsell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, and I repeat my wish that\r\nthis sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness.”\r\n\r\n0351m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir,” said Caderousse, putting out one hand timidly, and with the\r\nother wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow,—“Oh, sir, do\r\nnot make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man.”\r\n\r\n“I know what happiness and what despair are, and I never make a jest of\r\nsuch feelings. Take it, then, but in exchange——”\r\n\r\nCaderousse, who touched the diamond, withdrew his hand.\r\n\r\nThe abbé smiled.\r\n\r\n“In exchange,” he continued, “give me the red silk purse that M. Morrel\r\nleft on old Dantès’ chimney-piece, and which you tell me is still in\r\nyour hands.”\r\n\r\nCaderousse, more and more astonished, went toward a large oaken\r\ncupboard, opened it, and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk,\r\nround which were two copper runners that had once been gilt. The abbé\r\ntook it, and in return gave Caderousse the diamond.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are a man of God, sir,” cried Caderousse; “for no one knew\r\nthat Edmond had given you this diamond, and you might have kept it.”\r\n\r\n“Which,” said the abbé to himself, “you would have done.” The abbé\r\nrose, took his hat and gloves. “Well,” he said, “all you have told me\r\nis perfectly true, then, and I may believe it in every particular.”\r\n\r\n“See, sir,” replied Caderousse, “in this corner is a crucifix in holy\r\nwood—here on this shelf is my wife’s testament; open this book, and I\r\nwill swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix. I will swear to you by\r\nmy soul’s salvation, my faith as a Christian, I have told everything to\r\nyou as it occurred, and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear\r\nof God at the day of the last judgment!”\r\n\r\n“’Tis well,” said the abbé, convinced by his manner and tone that\r\nCaderousse spoke the truth. “’Tis well, and may this money profit you!\r\nAdieu; I go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other.”\r\n\r\nThe abbé with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of\r\nCaderousse, opened the door himself, got out and mounted his horse,\r\nonce more saluted the innkeeper, who kept uttering his loud farewells,\r\nand then returned by the road he had travelled in coming.\r\n\r\nWhen Caderousse turned around, he saw behind him La Carconte, paler and\r\ntrembling more than ever.\r\n\r\n“Is, then, all that I have heard really true?” she inquired.\r\n\r\n“What? That he has given the diamond to us only?” inquired Caderousse,\r\nhalf bewildered with joy; “yes, nothing more true! See, here it is.”\r\n\r\nThe woman gazed at it a moment, and then said, in a gloomy voice,\r\n“Suppose it’s false?”\r\n\r\nCaderousse started and turned pale.\r\n\r\n“False!” he muttered. “False! Why should that man give me a false\r\ndiamond?”\r\n\r\n0349m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“To get your secret without paying for it, you blockhead!”\r\n\r\nCaderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” he said, taking up his hat, which he placed on the red\r\nhandkerchief tied round his head, “we will soon find out.”\r\n\r\n“In what way?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the fair is on at Beaucaire, there are always jewellers from\r\nParis there, and I will show it to them. Look after the house, wife,\r\nand I shall be back in two hours,” and Caderousse left the house in\r\nhaste, and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the\r\npriest had taken.\r\n\r\n“Fifty thousand francs!” muttered La Carconte when left alone; “it is a\r\nlarge sum of money, but it is not a fortune.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO\r\n\r\n20009m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20011m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20019m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 28. The Prison Register\r\n\r\nThe day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken\r\nplace on the road between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, a man of about\r\nthirty or two-and-thirty, dressed in a bright blue frock coat, nankeen\r\ntrousers, and a white waistcoat, having the appearance and accent of an\r\nEnglishman, presented himself before the mayor of Marseilles.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he, “I am chief clerk of the house of Thomson & French, of\r\nRome. We are, and have been these ten years, connected with the house\r\nof Morrel & Son, of Marseilles. We have a hundred thousand francs or\r\nthereabouts loaned on their securities, and we are a little uneasy at\r\nreports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin. I\r\nhave come, therefore, express from Rome, to ask you for information.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied the mayor. “I know very well that during the last four\r\nor five years misfortune has seemed to pursue M. Morrel. He has lost\r\nfour or five vessels, and suffered by three or four bankruptcies; but\r\nit is not for me, although I am a creditor myself to the amount of ten\r\nthousand francs, to give any information as to the state of his\r\nfinances. Ask of me, as mayor, what is my opinion of M. Morrel, and I\r\nshall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree, and who has up\r\nto this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality.\r\nThis is all I can say, sir; if you wish to learn more, address yourself\r\nto M. de Boville, the inspector of prisons, No. 15, Rue de Nouailles;\r\nhe has, I believe, two hundred thousand francs in Morrel’s hands, and\r\nif there be any grounds for apprehension, as this is a greater amount\r\nthan mine, you will most probably find him better informed than\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\nThe Englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy, made his bow\r\nand went away, proceeding with a characteristic British stride towards\r\nthe street mentioned.\r\n\r\nM. de Boville was in his private room, and the Englishman, on\r\nperceiving him, made a gesture of surprise, which seemed to indicate\r\nthat it was not the first time he had been in his presence. As to M. de\r\nBoville, he was in such a state of despair, that it was evident all the\r\nfaculties of his mind, absorbed in the thought which occupied him at\r\nthe moment, did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray\r\nto the past.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman, with the coolness of his nation, addressed him in terms\r\nnearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of\r\nMarseilles.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir,” exclaimed M. de Boville, “your fears are unfortunately but\r\ntoo well founded, and you see before you a man in despair. I had two\r\nhundred thousand francs placed in the hands of Morrel & Son; these two\r\nhundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter, who was to be\r\nmarried in a fortnight, and these two hundred thousand francs were\r\npayable, half on the 15th of this month, and the other half on the 15th\r\nof next month. I had informed M. Morrel of my desire to have these\r\npayments punctually, and he has been here within the last half-hour to\r\ntell me that if his ship, the _Pharaon_, did not come into port on the\r\n15th, he would be wholly unable to make this payment.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said the Englishman, “this looks very much like a suspension of\r\npayment.”\r\n\r\n“It looks more like bankruptcy!” exclaimed M. de Boville despairingly.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman appeared to reflect a moment, and then said, “From which\r\nit would appear, sir, that this credit inspires you with considerable\r\napprehension?”\r\n\r\n“To tell you the truth, I consider it lost.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I will buy it of you!”\r\n\r\n“You?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I!”\r\n\r\n“But at a tremendous discount, of course?”\r\n\r\n“No, for two hundred thousand francs. Our house,” added the Englishman\r\nwith a laugh, “does not do things in that way.”\r\n\r\n“And you will pay——”\r\n\r\n“Ready money.”\r\n\r\n20023m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the Englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of bank-notes, which\r\nmight have been twice the sum M. de Boville feared to lose. A ray of\r\njoy passed across M. de Boville’s countenance, yet he made an effort at\r\nself-control, and said:\r\n\r\n“Sir, I ought to tell you that, in all probability, you will not\r\nrealize six per cent of this sum.”\r\n\r\n“That’s no affair of mine,” replied the Englishman, “that is the affair\r\nof the house of Thomson & French, in whose name I act. They have,\r\nperhaps, some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm.\r\nBut all I know, sir, is, that I am ready to hand you over this sum in\r\nexchange for your assignment of the debt. I only ask a brokerage.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, that is perfectly just,” cried M. de Boville. “The\r\ncommission is usually one and a half; will you have two—three—five per\r\ncent, or even more? Whatever you say.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied the Englishman, laughing, “I am like my house, and do\r\nnot do such things—no, the commission I ask is quite different.”\r\n\r\n“Name it, sir, I beg.”\r\n\r\n“You are the inspector of prisons?”\r\n\r\n“I have been so these fourteen years.”\r\n\r\n“You keep the registers of entries and departures?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“To these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners?”\r\n\r\n“There are special reports on every prisoner.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, I was educated at Rome by a poor devil of an abbé, who\r\ndisappeared suddenly. I have since learned that he was confined in the\r\nChâteau d’If, and I should like to learn some particulars of his\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\n“What was his name?”\r\n\r\n“The Abbé Faria.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I recollect him perfectly,” cried M. de Boville; “he was crazy.”\r\n\r\n“So they said.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he was, decidedly.”\r\n\r\n“Very possibly; but what sort of madness was it?”\r\n\r\n“He pretended to know of an immense treasure, and offered vast sums to\r\nthe government if they would liberate him.”\r\n\r\n“Poor devil!—and he is dead?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, five or six months ago, last February.”\r\n\r\n“You have a good memory, sir, to recollect dates so well.”\r\n\r\n“I recollect this, because the poor devil’s death was accompanied by a\r\nsingular incident.”\r\n\r\n“May I ask what that was?” said the Englishman with an expression of\r\ncuriosity, which a close observer would have been astonished at\r\ndiscovering in his phlegmatic countenance.\r\n\r\n“Oh dear, yes, sir; the abbé’s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant\r\nfrom that of one of Bonaparte’s emissaries,—one of those who had\r\ncontributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815, a very\r\nresolute and very dangerous man.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” said the Englishman.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied M. de Boville; “I myself had occasion to see this man in\r\n1816 or 1817, and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of\r\nsoldiers. That man made a deep impression on me; I shall never forget\r\nhis countenance!”\r\n\r\n20025m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Englishman smiled imperceptibly.\r\n\r\n“And you say, sir,” he interposed, “that the two dungeons——”\r\n\r\n“Were separated by a distance of fifty feet; but it appears that this\r\nEdmond Dantès——”\r\n\r\n“This dangerous man’s name was——”\r\n\r\n“Edmond Dantès. It appears, sir, that this Edmond Dantès had procured\r\ntools, or made them, for they found a tunnel through which the\r\nprisoners held communication with one another.”\r\n\r\n“This tunnel was dug, no doubt, with an intention of escape?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt; but unfortunately for the prisoners, the Abbé Faria had an\r\nattack of catalepsy, and died.”\r\n\r\n“That must have cut short the projects of escape.”\r\n\r\n“For the dead man, yes,” replied M. de Boville, “but not for the\r\nsurvivor; on the contrary, this Dantès saw a means of accelerating his\r\nescape. He, no doubt, thought that prisoners who died in the Château\r\nd’If were interred in an ordinary burial-ground, and he conveyed the\r\ndead man into his own cell, took his place in the sack in which they\r\nhad sewed up the corpse, and awaited the moment of interment.”\r\n\r\n“It was a bold step, and one that showed some courage,” remarked the\r\nEnglishman.\r\n\r\n“As I have already told you, sir, he was a very dangerous man; and,\r\nfortunately, by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears\r\nit had on his account.”\r\n\r\n“How was that?”\r\n\r\n“How? Do you not comprehend?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“The Château d’If has no cemetery, and they simply throw the dead into\r\nthe sea, after fastening a thirty-six-pound cannon-ball to their feet.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” observed the Englishman as if he were slow of comprehension.\r\n\r\n“Well, they fastened a thirty-six-pound ball to his feet, and threw him\r\ninto the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Really!” exclaimed the Englishman.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” continued the inspector of prisons. “You may imagine the\r\namazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the\r\nrocks! I should like to have seen his face at that moment.”\r\n\r\n“That would have been difficult.”\r\n\r\n“No matter,” replied De Boville, in supreme good-humor at the certainty\r\nof recovering his two hundred thousand francs,—“no matter, I can fancy\r\nit.” And he shouted with laughter.\r\n\r\n“So can I,” said the Englishman, and he laughed too; but he laughed as\r\nthe English do, “at the end of his teeth.”\r\n\r\n“And so,” continued the Englishman who first gained his composure, “he\r\nwas drowned?”\r\n\r\n“Unquestionably.”\r\n\r\n“So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner\r\nat the same time?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely.”\r\n\r\n20027m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“But some official document was drawn up as to this affair, I suppose?”\r\ninquired the Englishman.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, the mortuary deposition. You understand, Dantès’ relations,\r\nif he had any, might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or\r\nalive.”\r\n\r\n“So that now, if there were anything to inherit from him, they may do\r\nso with easy conscience. He is dead, and no mistake about it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; and they may have the fact attested whenever they please.”\r\n\r\n“So be it,” said the Englishman. “But to return to these registers.”\r\n\r\n“True, this story has diverted our attention from them. Excuse me.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse you for what? For the story? By no means; it really seems to me\r\nvery curious.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed. So, sir, you wish to see all relating to the poor abbé,\r\nwho really was gentleness itself.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you will much oblige me.”\r\n\r\n“Go into my study here, and I will show it to you.”\r\n\r\nAnd they both entered M. de Boville’s study. Everything was here\r\narranged in perfect order; each register had its number, each file of\r\npapers its place. The inspector begged the Englishman to seat himself\r\nin an armchair, and placed before him the register and documents\r\nrelative to the Château d’If, giving him all the time he desired for\r\nthe examination, while De Boville seated himself in a corner, and began\r\nto read his newspaper. The Englishman easily found the entries relative\r\nto the Abbé Faria; but it seemed that the history which the inspector\r\nhad related interested him greatly, for after having perused the first\r\ndocuments he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition\r\nrespecting Edmond Dantès. There he found everything arranged in due\r\norder,—the accusation, examination, Morrel’s petition, M. de\r\nVillefort’s marginal notes. He folded up the accusation quietly, and\r\nput it as quietly in his pocket; read the examination, and saw that the\r\nname of Noirtier was not mentioned in it; perused, too, the application\r\ndated 10th April, 1815, in which Morrel, by the deputy procureur’s\r\nadvice, exaggerated with the best intentions (for Napoleon was then on\r\nthe throne) the services Dantès had rendered to the imperial\r\ncause—services which Villefort’s certificates rendered indisputable.\r\nThen he saw through the whole thing. This petition to Napoleon, kept\r\nback by Villefort, had become, under the second restoration, a terrible\r\nweapon against him in the hands of the king’s attorney. He was no\r\nlonger astonished when he searched on to find in the register this\r\nnote, placed in a bracket against his name:\r\n\r\nEdmond Dantès.\r\n\r\nAn inveterate Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from the\r\nIsland of Elba.\r\n\r\nTo be kept in strict solitary confinement, and to be closely watched\r\nand guarded.\r\n\r\nBeneath these lines was written in another hand: “See note\r\nabove—nothing can be done.”\r\n\r\nHe compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the\r\ncertificate placed beneath Morrel’s petition, and discovered that the\r\nnote in the bracket was the same writing as the certificate—that is to\r\nsay, was in Villefort’s handwriting.\r\n\r\n20029m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the note which accompanied this, the Englishman understood that\r\nit might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary\r\ninterest in Dantès’ situation, but who had, from the remarks we have\r\nquoted, found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, the inspector, from discretion, and that he might not\r\ndisturb the Abbé Faria’s pupil in his researches, had seated himself in\r\na corner, and was reading _Le Drapeau Blanc_. He did not see the\r\nEnglishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by\r\nDanglars under the arbor of La Réserve, and which had the postmark,\r\n“Marseilles, 27th February, delivery 6 o’clock, P.M.”\r\n\r\nBut it must be said that if he had seen it, he attached so little\r\nimportance to this scrap of paper, and so much importance to his two\r\nhundred thousand francs, that he would not have opposed whatever the\r\nEnglishman might do, however irregular it might be.\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” said the latter, closing the register with a slam, “I have\r\nall I want; now it is for me to perform my promise. Give me a simple\r\nassignment of your debt; acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash,\r\nand I will hand you over the money.”\r\n\r\nHe rose, gave his seat to M. de Boville, who took it without ceremony,\r\nand quickly drew up the required assignment, while the Englishman\r\ncounted out the bank-notes on the other side of the desk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 29. The House of Morrel & Son\r\n\r\nAnyone who had quitted Marseilles a few years previously, well\r\nacquainted with the interior of Morrel’s warehouse, and had returned at\r\nthis date, would have found a great change. Instead of that air of\r\nlife, of comfort, and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and\r\nprosperous business establishment—instead of merry faces at the\r\nwindows, busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors—instead\r\nof the court filled with bales of goods, re-echoing with the cries and\r\nthe jokes of porters, one would have immediately perceived all aspect\r\nof sadness and gloom. Out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill\r\nthe deserted corridor and the empty office, but two remained. One was a\r\nyoung man of three or four-and-twenty, who was in love with M. Morrel’s\r\ndaughter, and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his\r\nfriends to induce him to withdraw; the other was an old one-eyed\r\ncashier, called “Cocles,” or “Cock-eye,” a nickname given him by the\r\nyoung men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted bee-hive,\r\nand which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not,\r\nin all probability, have replied to anyone who addressed him by it.\r\n\r\nCocles remained in M. Morrel’s service, and a most singular change had\r\ntaken place in his position; he had at the same time risen to the rank\r\nof cashier, and sunk to the rank of a servant. He was, however, the\r\nsame Cocles, good, patient, devoted, but inflexible on the subject of\r\narithmetic, the only point on which he would have stood firm against\r\nthe world, even against M. Morrel; and strong in the\r\nmultiplication-table, which he had at his fingers’ ends, no matter what\r\nscheme or what trap was laid to catch him.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the disasters that befell the house, Cocles was the\r\nonly one unmoved. But this did not arise from a want of affection; on\r\nthe contrary, from a firm conviction. Like the rats that one by one\r\nforsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor, so all\r\nthe numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the\r\nwarehouse. Cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the\r\ncause of their departure. Everything was as we have said, a question of\r\narithmetic to Cocles, and during twenty years he had always seen all\r\npayments made with such exactitude, that it seemed as impossible to him\r\nthat the house should stop payment, as it would to a miller that the\r\nriver that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow.\r\n\r\nNothing had as yet occurred to shake Cocles’ belief; the last month’s\r\npayment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude; Cocles had\r\ndetected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash, and the same\r\nevening he had brought them to M. Morrel, who, with a melancholy smile,\r\nthrew them into an almost empty drawer, saying:\r\n\r\n“Thanks, Cocles; you are the pearl of cashiers.”\r\n\r\nCocles went away perfectly happy, for this eulogium of M. Morrel,\r\nhimself the pearl of the honest men of Marseilles, flattered him more\r\nthan a present of fifty crowns. But since the end of the month M.\r\nMorrel had passed many an anxious hour.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the payments then due; he had collected all his\r\nresources, and, fearing lest the report of his distress should get\r\nbruited abroad at Marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an\r\nextremity, he went to the Beaucaire fair to sell his wife’s and\r\ndaughter’s jewels and a portion of his plate. By this means the end of\r\nthe month was passed, but his resources were now exhausted. Credit,\r\nowing to the reports afloat, was no longer to be had; and to meet the\r\none hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month, and\r\nthe one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to M.\r\nde Boville, M. Morrel had, in reality, no hope but the return of the\r\n_Pharaon_, of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had\r\nweighed anchor at the same time, and which had already arrived in\r\nharbor.\r\n\r\nBut this vessel which, like the _Pharaon_, came from Calcutta, had been\r\nin for a fortnight, while no intelligence had been received of the\r\n_Pharaon_.\r\n\r\n20033m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs when, the day after his interview with M.\r\nde Boville, the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French of\r\nRome, presented himself at M. Morrel’s.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel received him; this young man was alarmed by the appearance of\r\nevery new face, for every new face might be that of a new creditor,\r\ncome in anxiety to question the head of the house. The young man,\r\nwishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview, questioned\r\nthe new-comer; but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to\r\nM. Emmanuel, and that his business was with M. Morrel in person.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel sighed, and summoned Cocles. Cocles appeared, and the young\r\nman bade him conduct the stranger to M. Morrel’s apartment. Cocles went\r\nfirst, and the stranger followed him. On the staircase they met a\r\nbeautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen, who looked with anxiety at the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n“M. Morrel is in his room, is he not, Mademoiselle Julie?” said the\r\ncashier.\r\n\r\n“Yes; I think so, at least,” said the young girl hesitatingly. “Go and\r\nsee, Cocles, and if my father is there, announce this gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“It will be useless to announce me, mademoiselle,” returned the\r\nEnglishman. “M. Morrel does not know my name; this worthy gentleman has\r\nonly to announce the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson &\r\nFrench of Rome, with whom your father does business.”\r\n\r\nThe young girl turned pale and continued to descend, while the stranger\r\nand Cocles continued to mount the staircase. She entered the office\r\nwhere Emmanuel was, while Cocles, by the aid of a key he possessed,\r\nopened a door in the corner of a landing-place on the second staircase,\r\nconducted the stranger into an antechamber, opened a second door, which\r\nhe closed behind him, and after having left the clerk of the house of\r\nThomson & French alone, returned and signed to him that he could enter.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman entered, and found Morrel seated at a table, turning\r\nover the formidable columns of his ledger, which contained the list of\r\nhis liabilities. At the sight of the stranger, M. Morrel closed the\r\nledger, arose, and offered a seat to the stranger; and when he had seen\r\nhim seated, resumed his own chair. Fourteen years had changed the\r\nworthy merchant, who, in his thirty-sixth year at the opening of this\r\nhistory, was now in his fiftieth; his hair had turned white, time and\r\nsorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow, and his look, once so\r\nfirm and penetrating, was now irresolute and wandering, as if he feared\r\nbeing forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity, evidently\r\nmingled with interest. “Monsieur,” said Morrel, whose uneasiness was\r\nincreased by this examination, “you wish to speak to me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur; you are aware from whom I come?”\r\n\r\n“The house of Thomson & French; at least, so my cashier tells me.”\r\n\r\n“He has told you rightly. The house of Thomson & French had 300,000 or\r\n400,000 francs to pay this month in France; and, knowing your strict\r\npunctuality, have collected all the bills bearing your signature, and\r\ncharged me as they became due to present them, and to employ the money\r\notherwise.”\r\n\r\nMorrel sighed deeply, and passed his hand over his forehead, which was\r\ncovered with perspiration.\r\n\r\n“So then, sir,” said Morrel, “you hold bills of mine?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and for a considerable sum.”\r\n\r\n“What is the amount?” asked Morrel with a voice he strove to render\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\n20035m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Here is,” said the Englishman, taking a quantity of papers from his\r\npocket, “an assignment of 200,000 francs to our house by M. de Boville,\r\nthe inspector of prisons, to whom they are due. You acknowledge, of\r\ncourse, that you owe this sum to him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent\r\nnearly five years ago.”\r\n\r\n“When are you to pay?”\r\n\r\n“Half the 15th of this month, half the 15th of next.”\r\n\r\n“Just so; and now here are 32,500 francs payable shortly; they are all\r\nsigned by you, and assigned to our house by the holders.”\r\n\r\n“I recognize them,” said Morrel, whose face was suffused, as he thought\r\nthat, for the first time in his life, he would be unable to honor his\r\nown signature. “Is this all?”\r\n\r\n“No, I have for the end of the month these bills which have been\r\nassigned to us by the house of Pascal, and the house of Wild & Turner\r\nof Marseilles, amounting to nearly 55,000 francs; in all, 287,500\r\nfrancs.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during this\r\nenumeration. “Two hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred\r\nfrancs,” repeated he.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” replied the Englishman. “I will not,” continued he, after a\r\nmoment’s silence, “conceal from you, that while your probity and\r\nexactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged, yet the\r\nreport is current in Marseilles that you are not able to meet your\r\nliabilities.”\r\n\r\nAt this almost brutal speech Morrel turned deathly pale.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he, “up to this time—and it is now more than\r\nfour-and-twenty years since I received the direction of this house from\r\nmy father, who had himself conducted it for five-and-thirty years—never\r\nhas anything bearing the signature of Morrel & Son been dishonored.”\r\n\r\n“I know that,” replied the Englishman. “But as a man of honor should\r\nanswer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same\r\npunctuality?”\r\n\r\nMorrel shuddered, and looked at the man, who spoke with more assurance\r\nthan he had hitherto shown.\r\n\r\n“To questions frankly put,” said he, “a straightforward answer should\r\nbe given. Yes, I shall pay, if, as I hope, my vessel arrives safely;\r\nfor its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous\r\naccidents, of which I have been the victim, have deprived me; but if\r\nthe _Pharaon_ should be lost, and this last resource be gone——”\r\n\r\nThe poor man’s eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the other, “if this last resource fail you?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” returned Morrel, “it is a cruel thing to be forced to say, but,\r\nalready used to misfortune, I must habituate myself to shame. I fear I\r\nshall be forced to suspend payment.”\r\n\r\n“Have you no friends who could assist you?”\r\n\r\nMorrel smiled mournfully.\r\n\r\n“In business, sir,” said he, “one has no friends, only correspondents.”\r\n\r\n“It is true,” murmured the Englishman; “then you have but one hope.”\r\n\r\n“But one.”\r\n\r\n“The last?”\r\n\r\n“The last.”\r\n\r\n“So that if this fail——”\r\n\r\n“I am ruined,—completely ruined!”\r\n\r\n“As I was on my way here, a vessel was coming into port.”\r\n\r\n“I know it, sir; a young man, who still adheres to my fallen fortunes,\r\npasses a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house, in\r\nhopes of being the first to announce good news to me; he has informed\r\nme of the arrival of this ship.”\r\n\r\n“And it is not yours?”\r\n\r\n“No, she is a Bordeaux vessel, _La Gironde_; she comes from India also;\r\nbut she is not mine.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she has spoken to the _Pharaon_, and brings you some tidings\r\nof her?”\r\n\r\n“Shall I tell you plainly one thing, sir? I dread almost as much to\r\nreceive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt. Uncertainty is\r\nstill hope.” Then in a low voice Morrel added,—“This delay is not\r\nnatural. The _Pharaon_ left Calcutta the 5th of February; she ought to\r\nhave been here a month ago.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” said the Englishman. “What is the meaning of that\r\nnoise?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my God!” cried Morrel, turning pale, “what is it?”\r\n\r\nA loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily, and\r\nhalf-stifled sobs. Morrel rose and advanced to the door; but his\r\nstrength failed him and he sank into a chair. The two men remained\r\nopposite one another, Morrel trembling in every limb, the stranger\r\ngazing at him with an air of profound pity. The noise had ceased; but\r\nit seemed that Morrel expected something—something had occasioned the\r\nnoise, and something must follow. The stranger fancied he heard\r\nfootsteps on the stairs; and that the footsteps, which were those of\r\nseveral persons, stopped at the door. A key was inserted in the lock of\r\nthe first door, and the creaking of hinges was audible.\r\n\r\n“There are only two persons who have the key to that door,” murmured\r\nMorrel, “Cocles and Julie.”\r\n\r\nAt this instant the second door opened, and the young girl, her eyes\r\nbathed with tears, appeared. Morrel rose tremblingly, supporting\r\nhimself by the arm of the chair. He would have spoken, but his voice\r\nfailed him.\r\n\r\n“Oh, father!” said she, clasping her hands, “forgive your child for\r\nbeing the bearer of evil tidings.”\r\n\r\nMorrel again changed color. Julie threw herself into his arms.\r\n\r\n“Oh, father, father!” murmured she, “courage!”\r\n\r\n“The _Pharaon_ has gone down, then?” said Morrel in a hoarse voice. The\r\nyoung girl did not speak; but she made an affirmative sign with her\r\nhead as she lay on her father’s breast.\r\n\r\n“And the crew?” asked Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Saved,” said the girl; “saved by the crew of the vessel that has just\r\nentered the harbor.”\r\n\r\nMorrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation\r\nand sublime gratitude.\r\n\r\n“Thanks, my God,” said he, “at least thou strikest but me alone.”\r\n\r\nA tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic Englishman.\r\n\r\n“Come in, come in,” said Morrel, “for I presume you are all at the\r\ndoor.”\r\n\r\nScarcely had he uttered those words when Madame Morrel entered weeping\r\nbitterly. Emmanuel followed her, and in the antechamber were visible\r\nthe rough faces of seven or eight half-naked sailors. At the sight of\r\nthese men the Englishman started and advanced a step; then restrained\r\nhimself, and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the\r\napartment. Madame Morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his\r\nhands in hers, Julie still lay with her head on his shoulder, Emmanuel\r\nstood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between\r\nMorrel’s family and the sailors at the door.\r\n\r\n“How did this happen?” said Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Draw nearer, Penelon,” said the young man, “and tell us all about it.”\r\n\r\nAn old seaman, bronzed by the tropical sun, advanced, twirling the\r\nremains of a hat between his hands.\r\n\r\n“Good-day, M. Morrel,” said he, as if he had just quitted Marseilles\r\nthe previous evening, and had just returned from Aix or Toulon.\r\n\r\n“Good-day, Penelon,” returned Morrel, who could not refrain from\r\nsmiling through his tears, “where is the captain?”\r\n\r\n“The captain, M. Morrel,—he has stayed behind sick at Palma; but please\r\nGod, it won’t be much, and you will see him in a few days all alive and\r\nhearty.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now tell your story, Penelon.”\r\n\r\n20039m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPenelon rolled his quid in his cheek, placed his hand before his mouth,\r\nturned his head, and sent a long jet of tobacco-juice into the\r\nantechamber, advanced his foot, balanced himself, and began.\r\n\r\n“You see, M. Morrel,” said he, “we were somewhere between Cape Blanc\r\nand Cape Boyador, sailing with a fair breeze, south-south-west after a\r\nweek’s calm, when Captain Gaumard comes up to me—I was at the helm I\r\nshould tell you—and says, ‘Penelon, what do you think of those clouds\r\ncoming up over there?’ I was just then looking at them myself. ‘What do\r\nI think, captain? Why I think that they are rising faster than they\r\nhave any business to do, and that they would not be so black if they\r\ndidn’t mean mischief.’—‘That’s my opinion too,’ said the captain, ‘and\r\nI’ll take precautions accordingly. We are carrying too much canvas.\r\nAvast, there, all hands! Take in the studding-sails and stow the flying\r\njib.’ It was time; the squall was on us, and the vessel began to heel.\r\n‘Ah,’ said the captain, ‘we have still too much canvas set; all hands\r\nlower the mainsail!’ Five minutes after, it was down; and we sailed\r\nunder mizzen-topsails and top-gallant sails. ‘Well, Penelon,’ said the\r\ncaptain, ‘what makes you shake your head?’ ‘Why,’ I says, ‘I still\r\nthink you’ve got too much on.’ ‘I think you’re right,’ answered he, ‘we\r\nshall have a gale.’ ‘A gale? More than that, we shall have a tempest,\r\nor I don’t know what’s what.’ You could see the wind coming like the\r\ndust at Montredon; luckily the captain understood his business. ‘Take\r\nin two reefs in the top-sails,’ cried the captain; ‘let go the\r\nbowlin’s, haul the brace, lower the top-gallant sails, haul out the\r\nreef-tackles on the yards.’”\r\n\r\n20041m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“That was not enough for those latitudes,” said the Englishman; “I\r\nshould have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker.”\r\n\r\nHis firm, sonorous, and unexpected voice made everyone start. Penelon\r\nput his hand over his eyes, and then stared at the man who thus\r\ncriticized the manœuvres of his captain.\r\n\r\n“We did better than that, sir,” said the old sailor respectfully; “we\r\nput the helm up to run before the tempest; ten minutes after we struck\r\nour top-sails and scudded under bare poles.”\r\n\r\n“The vessel was very old to risk that,” said the Englishman.\r\n\r\n“Eh, it was that that did the business; after pitching heavily for\r\ntwelve hours we sprung a leak. ‘Penelon,’ said the captain, ‘I think we\r\nare sinking, give me the helm, and go down into the hold.’ I gave him\r\nthe helm, and descended; there was already three feet of water. ‘All\r\nhands to the pumps!’ I shouted; but it was too late, and it seemed the\r\nmore we pumped the more came in. ‘Ah,’ said I, after four hours’ work,\r\n‘since we are sinking, let us sink; we can die but once.’ ‘Is that the\r\nexample you set, Penelon?’ cries the captain; ‘very well, wait a\r\nminute.’ He went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols.\r\n‘I will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump,’ said\r\nhe.”\r\n\r\n“Well done!” said the Englishman.\r\n\r\n20043m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons,” continued\r\nthe sailor; “and during that time the wind had abated, and the sea gone\r\ndown, but the water kept rising; not much, only two inches an hour, but\r\nstill it rose. Two inches an hour does not seem much, but in twelve\r\nhours that makes two feet, and three we had before, that makes five.\r\n‘Come,’ said the captain, ‘we have done all in our power, and M. Morrel\r\nwill have nothing to reproach us with, we have tried to save the ship,\r\nlet us now save ourselves. To the boats, my lads, as quick as you can.’\r\nNow,” continued Penelon, “you see, M. Morrel, a sailor is attached to\r\nhis ship, but still more to his life, so we did not wait to be told\r\ntwice; the more so, that the ship was sinking under us, and seemed to\r\nsay, ‘Get along—save yourselves.’ We soon launched the boat, and all\r\neight of us got into it. The captain descended last, or rather, he did\r\nnot descend, he would not quit the vessel; so I took him round the\r\nwaist, and threw him into the boat, and then I jumped after him. It was\r\ntime, for just as I jumped the deck burst with a noise like the\r\nbroadside of a man-of-war. Ten minutes after she pitched forward, then\r\nthe other way, spun round and round, and then good-bye to the\r\n_Pharaon_. As for us, we were three days without anything to eat or\r\ndrink, so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the\r\nrest, when we saw _La Gironde_; we made signals of distress, she\r\nperceived us, made for us, and took us all on board. There now, M.\r\nMorrel, that’s the whole truth, on the honor of a sailor; is not it\r\ntrue, you fellows there?” A general murmur of approbation showed that\r\nthe narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings.\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said M. Morrel, “I know there was no one in fault but\r\ndestiny. It was the will of God that this should happen, blessed be his\r\nname. What wages are due to you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t let us talk of that, M. Morrel.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but we will talk of it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, three months,” said Penelon.\r\n\r\n“Cocles, pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows,” said\r\nMorrel. “At another time,” added he, “I should have said, Give them,\r\nbesides, two hundred francs over as a present; but times are changed,\r\nand the little money that remains to me is not my own, so do not think\r\nme mean on this account.”\r\n\r\nPenelon turned to his companions, and exchanged a few words with them.\r\n\r\n“As for that, M. Morrel,” said he, again turning his quid, “as for\r\nthat——”\r\n\r\n“As for what?”\r\n\r\n“The money.”\r\n\r\n“Well——”\r\n\r\n“Well, we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present,\r\nand that we will wait for the rest.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, my friends, thanks!” cried Morrel gratefully; “take it—take\r\nit; and if you can find another employer, enter his service; you are\r\nfree to do so.”\r\n\r\nThese last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman. Penelon\r\nnearly swallowed his quid; fortunately he recovered.\r\n\r\n“What, M. Morrel!” said he in a low voice, “you send us away; you are\r\nthen angry with us!”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said M. Morrel, “I am not angry, quite the contrary, and I do\r\nnot send you away; but I have no more ships, and therefore I do not\r\nwant any sailors.”\r\n\r\n“No more ships!” returned Penelon; “well, then, you’ll build some;\r\nwe’ll wait for you.”\r\n\r\n“I have no money to build ships with, Penelon,” said the poor owner\r\nmournfully, “so I cannot accept your kind offer.”\r\n\r\n“No more money? Then you must not pay us; we can scud, like the\r\n_Pharaon_, under bare poles.”\r\n\r\n“Enough, enough!” cried Morrel, almost overpowered; “leave me, I pray\r\nyou; we shall meet again in a happier time. Emmanuel, go with them, and\r\nsee that my orders are executed.”\r\n\r\n“At least, we shall see each other again, M. Morrel?” asked Penelon.\r\n\r\n“Yes; I hope so, at least. Now go.” He made a sign to Cocles, who went\r\nfirst; the seamen followed him and Emmanuel brought up the rear. “Now,”\r\nsaid the owner to his wife and daughter, “leave me; I wish to speak\r\nwith this gentleman.”\r\n\r\n20045m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he glanced towards the clerk of Thomson & French, who had remained\r\nmotionless in the corner during this scene, in which he had taken no\r\npart, except the few words we have mentioned. The two women looked at\r\nthis person whose presence they had entirely forgotten, and retired;\r\nbut, as she left the apartment, Julie gave the stranger a supplicating\r\nglance, to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator\r\nwould have been surprised to see on his stern features. The two men\r\nwere left alone. “Well, sir,” said Morrel, sinking into a chair, “you\r\nhave heard all, and I have nothing further to tell you.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” returned the Englishman, “that a fresh and unmerited\r\nmisfortune has overwhelmed you, and this only increases my desire to\r\nserve you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir!” cried Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Let me see,” continued the stranger, “I am one of your largest\r\ncreditors.”\r\n\r\n“Your bills, at least, are the first that will fall due.”\r\n\r\n“Do you wish for time to pay?”\r\n\r\n“A delay would save my honor, and consequently my life.”\r\n\r\n“How long a delay do you wish for?”\r\n\r\nMorrel reflected. “Two months,” said he.\r\n\r\n“I will give you three,” replied the stranger.\r\n\r\n“But,” asked Morrel, “will the house of Thomson & French consent?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I take everything on myself. Today is the 5th of June.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, renew these bills up to the 5th of September; and on the 5th of\r\nSeptember at eleven o’clock (the hand of the clock pointed to eleven),\r\nI shall come to receive the money.”\r\n\r\n“I shall expect you,” returned Morrel; “and I will pay you—or I shall\r\nbe dead.” These last words were uttered in so low a tone that the\r\nstranger could not hear them. The bills were renewed, the old ones\r\ndestroyed, and the poor ship-owner found himself with three months\r\nbefore him to collect his resources. The Englishman received his thanks\r\nwith the phlegm peculiar to his nation; and Morrel, overwhelming him\r\nwith grateful blessings, conducted him to the staircase. The stranger\r\nmet Julie on the stairs; she pretended to be descending, but in reality\r\nshe was waiting for him. “Oh, sir”—said she, clasping her hands.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” said the stranger, “one day you will receive a letter\r\nsigned ‘Sinbad the Sailor.’ Do exactly what the letter bids you,\r\nhowever strange it may appear.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” returned Julie.\r\n\r\n“Do you promise?”\r\n\r\n“I swear to you I will.”\r\n\r\n“It is well. Adieu, mademoiselle. Continue to be the good, sweet girl\r\nyou are at present, and I have great hopes that Heaven will reward you\r\nby giving you Emmanuel for a husband.”\r\n\r\nJulie uttered a faint cry, blushed like a rose, and leaned against the\r\nbaluster. The stranger waved his hand, and continued to descend. In the\r\ncourt he found Penelon, who, with a rouleau of a hundred francs in\r\neither hand, seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them. “Come\r\nwith me, my friend,” said the Englishman; “I wish to speak to you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 30. The Fifth of September\r\n\r\nThe extension provided for by the agent of Thomson & French, at the\r\nmoment when Morrel expected it least, was to the poor shipowner so\r\ndecided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that\r\nfate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him. The same\r\nday he told his wife, Emmanuel, and his daughter all that had occurred;\r\nand a ray of hope, if not of tranquillity, returned to the family.\r\nUnfortunately, however, Morrel had not only engagements with the house\r\nof Thomson & French, who had shown themselves so considerate towards\r\nhim; and, as he had said, in business he had correspondents, and not\r\nfriends. When he thought the matter over, he could by no means account\r\nfor this generous conduct on the part of Thomson & French towards him;\r\nand could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this: “We\r\nhad better help a man who owes us nearly 300,000 francs, and have those\r\n300,000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin, and get\r\nonly six or eight per cent of our money back again.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, whether through envy or stupidity, all Morrel’s\r\ncorrespondents did not take this view; and some even came to a contrary\r\ndecision. The bills signed by Morrel were presented at his office with\r\nscrupulous exactitude, and, thanks to the delay granted by the\r\nEnglishman, were paid by Cocles with equal punctuality. Cocles thus\r\nremained in his accustomed tranquillity. It was Morrel alone who\r\nremembered with alarm, that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50,000\r\nfrancs of M. de Boville, and on the 30th the 32,500 francs of bills,\r\nfor which, as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons, he had\r\ntime granted, he must be a ruined man.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of all the commercial men was that, under the reverses\r\nwhich had successively weighed down Morrel, it was impossible for him\r\nto remain solvent. Great, therefore, was the astonishment when at the\r\nend of the month, he cancelled all his obligations with his usual\r\npunctuality. Still confidence was not restored to all minds, and the\r\ngeneral opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner\r\nhad been postponed only until the end of the month.\r\n\r\nThe month passed, and Morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all\r\nhis resources. Formerly his paper, at any date, was taken with\r\nconfidence, and was even in request. Morrel now tried to negotiate\r\nbills at ninety days only, and none of the banks would give him credit.\r\nFortunately, Morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely;\r\nand, as they reached him, he found himself in a condition to meet his\r\nengagements when the end of July came.\r\n\r\nThe agent of Thomson & French had not been again seen at Marseilles;\r\nthe day after, or two days after his visit to Morrel, he had\r\ndisappeared; and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the\r\nmayor, the inspector of prisons, and M. Morrel, his departure left no\r\ntrace except in the memories of these three persons. As to the sailors\r\nof the _Pharaon_, they must have found snug berths elsewhere, for they\r\nalso had disappeared.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gaumard, recovered from his illness, had returned from Palma.\r\nHe delayed presenting himself at Morrel’s, but the owner, hearing of\r\nhis arrival, went to see him. The worthy shipowner knew, from Penelon’s\r\nrecital, of the captain’s brave conduct during the storm, and tried to\r\nconsole him. He brought him also the amount of his wages, which Captain\r\nGaumard had not dared to apply for.\r\n\r\nAs he descended the staircase, Morrel met Penelon, who was going up.\r\nPenelon had, it would seem, made good use of his money, for he was\r\nnewly clad. When he saw his employer, the worthy tar seemed much\r\nembarrassed, drew on one side into the corner of the landing-place,\r\npassed his quid from one cheek to the other, stared stupidly with his\r\ngreat eyes, and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which Morrel\r\nas usual gave him by a slight pressure in return. Morrel attributed\r\nPenelon’s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire; it was evident\r\nthe good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account; he\r\nwas, no doubt, engaged on board some other vessel, and thus his\r\nbashfulness arose from the fact of his not having, if we may so express\r\nourselves, worn mourning for the _Pharaon_ longer. Perhaps he had come\r\nto tell Captain Gaumard of his good luck, and to offer him employment\r\nfrom his new master.\r\n\r\n“Worthy fellows!” said Morrel,  as he went away, “may your new master\r\nlove you as I loved you, and be more fortunate than I have been!”\r\n\r\n20049m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of Morrel to renew\r\nhis credit or revive the old. On the 20th of August it was known at\r\nMarseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach, and then it was said\r\nthat the bills would go to protest at the end of the month, and that\r\nMorrel had gone away and left his chief clerk Emmanuel, and his cashier\r\nCocles, to meet the creditors. But, contrary to all expectation, when\r\nthe 31st of August came, the house opened as usual, and Cocles appeared\r\nbehind the grating of the counter, examined all bills presented with\r\nthe usual scrutiny, and, from first to last, paid all with the usual\r\nprecision. There came in, moreover, two drafts which M. Morrel had\r\nfully anticipated, and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills\r\nwhich the shipowner had accepted. All this was incomprehensible, and\r\nthen, with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news, the failure\r\nwas put off until the end of September.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st, Morrel returned; he was awaited by his family with extreme\r\nanxiety, for from this journey to Paris they hoped great things. Morrel\r\nhad thought of Danglars, who was now immensely rich, and had lain under\r\ngreat obligations to Morrel in former days, since to him it was owing\r\nthat Danglars entered the service of the Spanish banker, with whom he\r\nhad laid the foundations of his vast wealth. It was said at this moment\r\nthat Danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs, and had\r\nunlimited credit. Danglars, then, without taking a crown from his\r\npocket, could save Morrel; he had but to pass his word for a loan, and\r\nMorrel was saved. Morrel had long thought of Danglars, but had kept\r\naway from some instinctive motive, and had delayed as long as possible\r\navailing himself of this last resource. And Morrel was right, for he\r\nreturned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal.\r\n\r\nYet, on his arrival, Morrel did not utter a complaint, or say one harsh\r\nword. He embraced his weeping wife and daughter, pressed Emmanuel’s\r\nhand with friendly warmth, and then going to his private room on the\r\nsecond floor had sent for Cocles.\r\n\r\n“Then,” said the two women to Emmanuel, “we are indeed ruined.”\r\n\r\nIt was agreed in a brief council held among them, that Julie should\r\nwrite to her brother, who was in garrison at Nîmes, to come to them as\r\nspeedily as possible. The poor women felt instinctively that they\r\nrequired all their strength to support the blow that impended. Besides,\r\nMaximilian Morrel, though hardly two-and-twenty, had great influence\r\nover his father.\r\n\r\nHe was a strong-minded, upright young man. At the time when he decided\r\non his profession his father had no desire to choose for him, but had\r\nconsulted young Maximilian’s taste. He had at once declared for a\r\nmilitary life, and had in consequence studied hard, passed brilliantly\r\nthrough the Polytechnic School, and left it as sub-lieutenant of the\r\n53rd of the line. For a year he had held this rank, and expected\r\npromotion on the first vacancy. In his regiment Maximilian Morrel was\r\nnoted for his rigid observance, not only of the obligations imposed on\r\na soldier, but also of the duties of a man; and he thus gained the name\r\nof “the stoic.” We need hardly say that many of those who gave him this\r\nepithet repeated it because they had heard it, and did not even know\r\nwhat it meant.\r\n\r\nThis was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid\r\nto sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon\r\nhave to endure. They had not mistaken the gravity of this event, for\r\nthe moment after Morrel had entered his private office with Cocles,\r\nJulie saw the latter leave it pale, trembling, and his features\r\nbetraying the utmost consternation. She would have questioned him as he\r\npassed by her, but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with\r\nunusual precipitation, and only raised his hands to heaven and\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle, what a dreadful misfortune! Who could\r\never have believed it!”\r\n\r\nA moment afterwards Julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three\r\nheavy ledgers, a portfolio, and a bag of money.\r\n\r\nMorrel examined the ledgers, opened the portfolio, and counted the\r\nmoney. All his funds amounted to 6,000 or 8,000 francs, his bills\r\nreceivable up to the 5th to 4,000 or 5,000, which, making the best of\r\neverything, gave him 14,000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287,500\r\nfrancs. He had not even the means for making a possible settlement on\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Morrel went down to his dinner, he appeared very calm.\r\nThis calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest\r\ndejection would have been. After dinner Morrel usually went out and\r\nused to take his coffee at the club of the Phocéens, and read the\r\n_Semaphore_; this day he did not leave the house, but returned to his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nAs to Cocles, he seemed completely bewildered. For part of the day he\r\nwent into the courtyard, seated himself on a stone with his head bare\r\nand exposed to the blazing sun. Emmanuel tried to comfort the women,\r\nbut his eloquence faltered. The young man was too well acquainted with\r\nthe business of the house, not to feel that a great catastrophe hung\r\nover the Morrel family. Night came, the two women had watched, hoping\r\nthat when he left his room Morrel would come to them, but they heard\r\nhim pass before their door, and trying to conceal the noise of his\r\nfootsteps. They listened; he went into his sleeping-room, and fastened\r\nthe door inside. Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed, and half an\r\nhour after Julie had retired, she rose, took off her shoes, and went\r\nstealthily along the passage, to see through the keyhole what her\r\nhusband was doing.\r\n\r\nIn the passage she saw a retreating shadow; it was Julie, who, uneasy\r\nherself, had anticipated her mother. The young lady went towards Madame\r\nMorrel.\r\n\r\n“He is writing,” she said.\r\n\r\nThey had understood each other without speaking. Madame Morrel looked\r\nagain through the keyhole, Morrel was writing; but Madame Morrel\r\nremarked, what her daughter had not observed, that her husband was\r\nwriting on stamped paper. The terrible idea that he was writing his\r\nwill flashed across her; she shuddered, and yet had not strength to\r\nutter a word.\r\n\r\nNext day M. Morrel seemed as calm as ever, went into his office as\r\nusual, came to his breakfast punctually, and then, after dinner, he\r\nplaced his daughter beside him, took her head in his arms, and held her\r\nfor a long time against his bosom. In the evening, Julie told her\r\nmother, that although he was apparently so calm, she had noticed that\r\nher father’s heart beat violently.\r\n\r\nThe next two days passed in much the same way. On the evening of the\r\n4th of September, M. Morrel asked his daughter for the key of his\r\nstudy. Julie trembled at this request, which seemed to her of bad omen.\r\nWhy did her father ask for this key which she always kept, and which\r\nwas only taken from her in childhood as a punishment? The young girl\r\nlooked at Morrel.\r\n\r\n“What have I done wrong, father,” she said, “that you should take this\r\nkey from me?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, my dear,” replied the unhappy man, the tears starting to his\r\neyes at this simple question,—“nothing, only I want it.”\r\n\r\nJulie made a pretence to feel for the key. “I must have left it in my\r\nroom,” she said.\r\n\r\nAnd she went out, but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to\r\nconsult Emmanuel.\r\n\r\n“Do not give this key to your father,” said he, “and tomorrow morning,\r\nif possible, do not quit him for a moment.”\r\n\r\nShe questioned Emmanuel, but he knew nothing, or would not say what he\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, between the 4th and 5th of September, Madame Morrel\r\nremained listening for every sound, and, until three o’clock in the\r\nmorning, she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation. It\r\nwas three o’clock when he threw himself on the bed. The mother and\r\ndaughter passed the night together. They had expected Maximilian since\r\nthe previous evening. At eight o’clock in the morning Morrel entered\r\ntheir chamber. He was calm; but the agitation of the night was legible\r\nin his pale and careworn visage. They did not dare to ask him how he\r\nhad slept. Morrel was kinder to his wife, more affectionate to his\r\ndaughter, than he had ever been. He could not cease gazing at and\r\nkissing the sweet girl. Julie, mindful of Emmanuel’s request, was\r\nfollowing her father when he quitted the room, but he said to her\r\nquickly:\r\n\r\n“Remain with your mother, dearest.” Julie wished to accompany him. “I\r\nwish you to do so,” said he.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken, but he said it in a\r\ntone of paternal kindness, and Julie did not dare to disobey. She\r\nremained at the same spot standing mute and motionless. An instant\r\nafterwards the door opened, she felt two arms encircle her, and a mouth\r\npressed her forehead. She looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy.\r\n\r\n20053m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Maximilian, my dearest brother!” she cried.\r\n\r\nAt these words Madame Morrel rose, and threw herself into her son’s\r\narms.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” said the young man, looking alternately at Madame Morrel and\r\nher daughter, “what has occurred—what has happened? Your letter has\r\nfrightened me, and I have come hither with all speed.”\r\n\r\n“Julie,” said Madame Morrel, making a sign to the young man, “go and\r\ntell your father that Maximilian has just arrived.”\r\n\r\nThe young lady rushed out of the apartment, but on the first step of\r\nthe staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand.\r\n\r\n“Are you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel?” inquired the man, with a\r\nstrong Italian accent.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” replied Julie with hesitation; “what is your pleasure? I do\r\nnot know you.”\r\n\r\n“Read this letter,” he said, handing it to her. Julie hesitated. “It\r\nconcerns the best interests of your father,” said the messenger.\r\n\r\nThe young girl hastily took the letter from him. She opened it quickly\r\nand read:\r\n\r\n“Go this moment to the Allées de Meilhan, enter the house No. 15, ask\r\nthe porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor, enter the\r\napartment, take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in\r\nred silk, and give it to your father. It is important that he should\r\nreceive it before eleven o’clock. You promised to obey me implicitly.\r\nRemember your oath.\r\n\r\n“Sinbad the Sailor.”\r\n\r\nThe young girl uttered a joyful cry, raised her eyes, looked round to\r\nquestion the messenger, but he had disappeared. She cast her eyes again\r\nover the note to peruse it a second time, and saw there was a\r\npostscript. She read:\r\n\r\n“It is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and\r\nalone. If you go accompanied by any other person, or should anyone else\r\ngo in your place, the porter will reply that he does not know anything\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\nThis postscript decreased greatly the young girl’s happiness. Was there\r\nnothing to fear? was there not some snare laid for her? Her innocence\r\nhad kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl\r\nof her age. But there is no need to know danger in order to fear it;\r\nindeed, it may be observed, that it is usually unknown perils that\r\ninspire the greatest terror.\r\n\r\nJulie hesitated, and resolved to take counsel. Yet, through a singular\r\nimpulse, it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied,\r\nbut to Emmanuel. She hastened down and told him what had occurred on\r\nthe day when the agent of Thomson & French had come to her father’s,\r\nrelated the scene on the staircase, repeated the promise she had made,\r\nand showed him the letter.\r\n\r\n“You must go, then, mademoiselle,” said Emmanuel.\r\n\r\n“Go there?” murmured Julie.\r\n\r\n“Yes; I will accompany you.”\r\n\r\n“But did you not read that I must be alone?” said Julie.\r\n\r\n“And you shall be alone,” replied the young man. “I will await you at\r\nthe corner of the Rue du Musée, and if you are so long absent as to\r\nmake me uneasy, I will hasten to rejoin you, and woe to him of whom you\r\nshall have cause to complain to me!”\r\n\r\n“Then, Emmanuel?” said the young girl with hesitation, “it is your\r\nopinion that I should obey this invitation?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Did not the messenger say your father’s safety depended upon it?”\r\n\r\n“But what danger threatens him, then, Emmanuel?” she asked.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel hesitated a moment, but his desire to make Julie decide\r\nimmediately made him reply.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” he said; “today is the 5th of September, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Today, then, at eleven o’clock, your father has nearly three hundred\r\nthousand francs to pay?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we know that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” continued Emmanuel, “we have not fifteen thousand francs\r\nin the house.”\r\n\r\n“What will happen then?”\r\n\r\n“Why, if today before eleven o’clock your father has not found someone\r\nwho will come to his aid, he will be compelled at twelve o’clock to\r\ndeclare himself a bankrupt.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, come, then, come!” cried she, hastening away with the young man.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Madame Morrel had told her son everything. The young\r\nman knew quite well that, after the succession of misfortunes which had\r\nbefallen his father, great changes had taken place in the style of\r\nliving and housekeeping; but he did not know that matters had reached\r\nsuch a point. He was thunderstruck. Then, rushing hastily out of the\r\napartment, he ran upstairs, expecting to find his father in his study,\r\nbut he rapped there in vain.\r\n\r\nWhile he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door\r\nopen, turned, and saw his father. Instead of going direct to his study,\r\nM. Morrel had returned to his bedchamber, which he was only this moment\r\nquitting. Morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son, of\r\nwhose arrival he was ignorant. He remained motionless on the spot,\r\npressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat.\r\nMaximilian sprang down the staircase, and threw his arms round his\r\nfather’s neck; but suddenly he recoiled, and placed his right hand on\r\nMorrel’s breast.\r\n\r\n“Father,” he exclaimed, turning pale as death, “what are you going to\r\ndo with that brace of pistols under your coat?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, this is what I feared!” said Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Father, father, in Heaven’s name,” exclaimed the young man, “what are\r\nthese weapons for?”\r\n\r\n“Maximilian,” replied Morrel, looking fixedly at his son, “you are a\r\nman, and a man of honor. Come, and I will explain to you.”\r\n\r\nAnd with a firm step Morrel went up to his study, while Maximilian\r\nfollowed him, trembling as he went. Morrel opened the door, and closed\r\nit behind his son; then, crossing the anteroom, went to his desk on\r\nwhich he placed the pistols, and pointed with his finger to an open\r\nledger. In this ledger was made out an exact balance-sheet of his\r\naffairs. Morrel had to pay, within half an hour, 287,500 francs. All he\r\npossessed was 15,257 francs.\r\n\r\n“Read!” said Morrel.\r\n\r\nThe young man was overwhelmed as he read. Morrel said not a word. What\r\ncould he say? What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures?\r\n\r\n“And have you done all that is possible, father, to meet this\r\ndisastrous result?” asked the young man, after a moment’s pause.\r\n\r\n“I have,” replied Morrel.\r\n\r\n“You have no money coming in on which you can rely?”\r\n\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\n“You have exhausted every resource?”\r\n\r\n“All.”\r\n\r\n“And in half an hour,” said Maximilian in a gloomy voice, “our name is\r\ndishonored!”\r\n\r\n“Blood washes out dishonor,” said Morrel.\r\n\r\n“You are right, father; I understand you.” Then extending his hand\r\ntowards one of the pistols, he said, “There is one for you and one for\r\nme—thanks!”\r\n\r\nMorrel caught his hand. “Your mother—your sister! Who will support\r\nthem?”\r\n\r\nA shudder ran through the young man’s frame. “Father,” he said, “do you\r\nreflect that you are bidding me to live?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do so bid you,” answered Morrel, “it is your duty. You have a\r\ncalm, strong mind, Maximilian. Maximilian, you are no ordinary man. I\r\nmake no requests or commands; I only ask you to examine my position as\r\nif it were your own, and then judge for yourself.”\r\n\r\nThe young man reflected for a moment, then an expression of sublime\r\nresignation appeared in his eyes, and with a slow and sad gesture he\r\ntook off his two epaulets, the insignia of his rank.\r\n\r\n“Be it so, then, my father,” he said, extending his hand to Morrel,\r\n“die in peace, my father; I will live.”\r\n\r\nMorrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son, but\r\nMaximilian caught him in his arms, and those two noble hearts were\r\npressed against each other for a moment.\r\n\r\n“You know it is not my fault,” said Morrel.\r\n\r\n20057m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaximilian smiled. “I know, father, you are the most honorable man I\r\nhave ever known.”\r\n\r\n“Good, my son. And now there is no more to be said; go and rejoin your\r\nmother and sister.”\r\n\r\n“My father,” said the young man, bending his knee, “bless me!” Morrel\r\ntook the head of his son between his two hands, drew him forward, and\r\nkissing his forehead several times said:\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, yes, I bless you in my own name, and in the name of three\r\ngenerations of irreproachable men, who say through me, ‘The edifice\r\nwhich misfortune has destroyed, Providence may build up again.’ On\r\nseeing me die such a death, the most inexorable will have pity on you.\r\nTo you, perhaps, they will accord the time they have refused to me.\r\nThen do your best to keep our name free from dishonor. Go to work,\r\nlabor, young man, struggle ardently and courageously; live, yourself,\r\nyour mother and sister, with the most rigid economy, so that from day\r\nto day the property of those whom I leave in your hands may augment and\r\nfructify. Reflect how glorious a day it will be, how grand, how solemn,\r\nthat day of complete restoration, on which you will say in this very\r\noffice, ‘My father died because he could not do what I have this day\r\ndone; but he died calmly and peaceably, because in dying he knew what I\r\nshould do.’”\r\n\r\n“My father, my father!” cried the young man, “why should you not live?”\r\n\r\n“If I live, all would be changed; if I live, interest would be\r\nconverted into doubt, pity into hostility; if I live I am only a man\r\nwho has broken his word, failed in his engagements—in fact, only a\r\nbankrupt. If, on the contrary, I die, remember, Maximilian, my corpse\r\nis that of an honest but unfortunate man. Living, my best friends would\r\navoid my house; dead, all Marseilles will follow me in tears to my last\r\nhome. Living, you would feel shame at my name; dead, you may raise your\r\nhead and say, ‘I am the son of him you killed, because, for the first\r\ntime, he has been compelled to break his word.’”\r\n\r\nThe young man uttered a groan, but appeared resigned.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Morrel, “leave me alone, and endeavor to keep your\r\nmother and sister away.”\r\n\r\n“Will you not see my sister once more?” asked Maximilian. A last but\r\nfinal hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this\r\ninterview, and therefore he had suggested it. Morrel shook his head. “I\r\nsaw her this morning, and bade her adieu.”\r\n\r\n“Have you no particular commands to leave with me, my father?” inquired\r\nMaximilian in a faltering voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes; my son, and a sacred command.”\r\n\r\n“Say it, my father.”\r\n\r\n“The house of Thomson & French is the only one who, from humanity, or,\r\nit may be, selfishness—it is not for me to read men’s hearts—has had\r\nany pity for me. Its agent, who will in ten minutes present himself to\r\nreceive the amount of a bill of 287,500 francs, I will not say granted,\r\nbut offered me three months. Let this house be the first repaid, my\r\nson, and respect this man.”\r\n\r\n“Father, I will,” said Maximilian.\r\n\r\n“And now, once more, adieu,” said Morrel. “Go, leave me; I would be\r\nalone. You will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom.”\r\n\r\nThe young man remained standing and motionless, having but the force of\r\nwill and not the power of execution.\r\n\r\n“Hear me, Maximilian,” said his father. “Suppose I were a soldier like\r\nyou, and ordered to carry a certain redoubt, and you knew I must be\r\nkilled in the assault, would you not say to me, as you said just now,\r\n‘Go, father; for you are dishonored by delay, and death is preferable\r\nto shame!’”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” said the young man, “yes;” and once again embracing his\r\nfather with convulsive pressure, he said, “Be it so, my father.”\r\n\r\nAnd he rushed out of the study. When his son had left him, Morrel\r\nremained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door; then\r\nputting forth his arm, he pulled the bell. After a moment’s interval,\r\nCocles appeared.\r\n\r\nIt was no longer the same man—the fearful revelations of the three last\r\ndays had crushed him. This thought—the house of Morrel is about to stop\r\npayment—bent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\n“My worthy Cocles,” said Morrel in a tone impossible to describe, “do\r\nyou remain in the antechamber. When the gentleman who came three months\r\nago—the agent of Thomson & French—arrives, announce his arrival to me.”\r\n\r\nCocles made no reply; he made a sign with his head, went into the\r\nanteroom, and seated himself. Morrel fell back in his chair, his eyes\r\nfixed on the clock; there were seven minutes left, that was all. The\r\nhand moved on with incredible rapidity, he seemed to see its motion.\r\n\r\nWhat passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony\r\ncannot be told in words. He was still comparatively young, he was\r\nsurrounded by the loving care of a devoted family, but he had convinced\r\nhimself by a course of reasoning, illogical perhaps, yet certainly\r\nplausible, that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the\r\nworld, even life itself. To form the slightest idea of his feelings,\r\none must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation\r\nand its tear-moistened eyes raised to heaven. The minute hand moved on.\r\nThe pistols were loaded; he stretched forth his hand, took one up, and\r\nmurmured his daughter’s name. Then he laid it down, seized his pen, and\r\nwrote a few words. It seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient\r\nfarewell of his beloved daughter. Then he turned again to the clock,\r\ncounting time now not by minutes, but by seconds.\r\n\r\nHe took up the deadly weapon again, his lips parted and his eyes fixed\r\non the clock, and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he\r\ncocked the pistol. At this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came\r\nforth upon his brow, a pang stronger than death clutched at his\r\nheart-strings. He heard the door of the staircase creak on its\r\nhinges—the clock gave its warning to strike eleven—the door of his\r\nstudy opened. Morrel did not turn round—he expected these words of\r\nCocles, “The agent of Thomson & French.”\r\n\r\nHe placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth. Suddenly he heard\r\na cry—it was his daughter’s voice. He turned and saw Julie. The pistol\r\nfell from his hands.\r\n\r\n“My father!” cried the young girl, out of breath, and half dead with\r\njoy—“saved, you are saved!” And she threw herself into his arms,\r\nholding in her extended hand a red, netted silk purse.\r\n\r\n20061m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Saved, my child!” said Morrel; “what do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, saved—saved! See, see!” said the young girl.\r\n\r\nMorrel took the purse, and started as he did so, for a vague\r\nremembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself. At one end\r\nwas the receipted bill for the 287,000 francs, and at the other was a\r\ndiamond as large as a hazel-nut, with these words on a small slip of\r\nparchment: _Julie’s Dowry_.\r\n\r\nMorrel passed his hand over his brow; it seemed to him a dream. At this\r\nmoment the clock struck eleven. He felt as if each stroke of the hammer\r\nfell upon his heart.\r\n\r\n“Explain, my child,” he said, “Explain, my child,” he said,\r\n“explain—where did you find this purse?”\r\n\r\n“In a house in the Allées de Meilhan, No. 15, on the corner of a\r\nmantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor.”\r\n\r\n“But,” cried Morrel, “this purse is not yours!” Julie handed to her\r\nfather the letter she had received in the morning.\r\n\r\n“And did you go alone?” asked Morrel, after he had read it.\r\n\r\n“Emmanuel accompanied me, father. He was to have waited for me at the\r\ncorner of the Rue du Musée, but, strange to say, he was not there when\r\nI returned.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Morrel!” exclaimed a voice on the stairs; “Monsieur Morrel!”\r\n\r\n“It is his voice!” said Julie. At this moment Emmanuel entered, his\r\ncountenance full of animation and joy.\r\n\r\n“The _Pharaon_!” he cried; “the _Pharaon_!”\r\n\r\n“What!—what!—the _Pharaon_! Are you mad, Emmanuel? You know the vessel\r\nis lost.”\r\n\r\n“The _Pharaon_, sir—they signal the _Pharaon_! The _Pharaon_ is\r\nentering the harbor!”\r\n\r\nMorrel fell back in his chair, his strength was failing him; his\r\nunderstanding weakened by such events, refused to comprehend such\r\nincredible, unheard-of, fabulous facts. But his son came in.\r\n\r\n“Father,” cried Maximilian, “how could you say the _Pharaon_ was lost?\r\nThe lookout has signalled her, and they say she is now coming into\r\nport.”\r\n\r\n20063m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“My dear friends,” said Morrel, “if this be so, it must be a miracle of\r\nheaven! Impossible, impossible!”\r\n\r\nBut what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his\r\nhand, the acceptance receipted—the splendid diamond.\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir,” exclaimed Cocles, “what can it mean?—the _Pharaon_?”\r\n\r\n“Come, dear ones,” said Morrel, rising from his seat, “let us go and\r\nsee, and Heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence!”\r\n\r\nThey all went out, and on the stairs met Madame Morrel, who had been\r\nafraid to go up into the study. In a moment they were at the Canebière.\r\nThere was a crowd on the pier. All the crowd gave way before Morrel.\r\n“The _Pharaon_! the _Pharaon_!” said every voice.\r\n\r\nAnd, wonderful to see, in front of the tower of Saint-Jean, was a ship\r\nbearing on her stern these words, printed in white letters, “The\r\n_Pharaon_, Morrel & Son, of Marseilles.” She was the exact duplicate of\r\nthe other _Pharaon_, and loaded, as that had been, with cochineal and\r\nindigo. She cast anchor, clued up sails, and on the deck was Captain\r\nGaumard giving orders, and good old Penelon making signals to M.\r\nMorrel. To doubt any longer was impossible; there was the evidence of\r\nthe senses, and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\nAs Morrel and his son embraced on the pier-head, in the presence and\r\namid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event, a man, with\r\nhis face half-covered by a black beard, and who, concealed behind the\r\nsentry-box, watched the scene with delight, uttered these words in a\r\nlow tone:\r\n\r\n“Be happy, noble heart, be blessed for all the good thou hast done and\r\nwilt do hereafter, and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your\r\ngood deeds.”\r\n\r\n20064m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd with a smile expressive of supreme content, he left his\r\nhiding-place, and without being observed, descended one of the flights\r\nof steps provided for debarkation, and hailing three times, shouted\r\n“Jacopo, Jacopo, Jacopo!”\r\n\r\nThen a launch came to shore, took him on board, and conveyed him to a\r\nyacht splendidly fitted up, on whose deck he sprung with the activity\r\nof a sailor; thence he once again looked towards Morrel, who, weeping\r\nwith joy, was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around\r\nhim, and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to\r\nbe seeking in the skies.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said the unknown, “farewell kindness, humanity, and\r\ngratitude! Farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart! I have\r\nbeen Heaven’s substitute to recompense the good—now the god of\r\nvengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked!”\r\n\r\nAt these words he gave a signal, and, as if only awaiting this signal,\r\nthe yacht instantly put out to sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor\r\n\r\nTowards the beginning of the year 1838, two young men belonging to the\r\nfirst society of Paris, the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and the Baron\r\nFranz d’Épinay, were at Florence. They had agreed to see the Carnival\r\nat Rome that year, and that Franz, who for the last three or four years\r\nhad inhabited Italy, should act as _cicerone_ to Albert.\r\n\r\nAs it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the Carnival at Rome,\r\nespecially when you have no great desire to sleep on the Piazza del\r\nPopolo, or the Campo Vaccino, they wrote to Signor Pastrini, the\r\nproprietor of the Hôtel de Londres, Piazza di Spagna, to reserve\r\ncomfortable apartments for them. Signor Pastrini replied that he had\r\nonly two rooms and a parlor on the third floor, which he offered at the\r\nlow charge of a louis per diem. They accepted his offer; but wishing to\r\nmake the best use of the time that was left, Albert started for Naples.\r\nAs for Franz, he remained at Florence, and after having passed a few\r\ndays in exploring the paradise of the Cascine, and spending two or\r\nthree evenings at the houses of the Florentine nobility, he took a\r\nfancy into his head (having already visited Corsica, the cradle of\r\nBonaparte) to visit Elba, the waiting-place of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nOne evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring\r\nthat secured it to the dock at Leghorn, wrapped himself in his coat and\r\nlay down, and said to the crew,—“To the Island of Elba!”\r\n\r\nThe boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz\r\ndisembarked at Porto-Ferrajo. He traversed the island, after having\r\nfollowed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left, and\r\nre-embarked for Marciana.\r\n\r\nTwo hours after he again landed at Pianosa, where he was assured that\r\nred partridges abounded. The sport was bad; Franz only succeeded in\r\nkilling a few partridges, and, like every unsuccessful sportsman, he\r\nreturned to the boat very much out of temper.\r\n\r\n“Ah, if your excellency chose,” said the captain, “you might have\r\ncapital sport.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“Do you see that island?” continued the captain, pointing to a conical\r\npile rising from the indigo sea.\r\n\r\n“Well, what is this island?”\r\n\r\n“The Island of Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\n“But I have no permission to shoot over this island.”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency does not require a permit, for the island is\r\nuninhabited.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed!” said the young man. “A desert island in the midst of the\r\nMediterranean must be a curiosity.”\r\n\r\n“It is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not\r\ncontain an acre of land capable of cultivation.”\r\n\r\n“To whom does this island belong?”\r\n\r\n“To Tuscany.”\r\n\r\n“What game shall I find there!”\r\n\r\n“Thousands of wild goats.”\r\n\r\n“Who live upon the stones, I suppose,” said Franz with an incredulous\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“No, but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices\r\nof the rocks.”\r\n\r\n“Where can I sleep?”\r\n\r\n“On shore in the grottos, or on board in your cloak; besides, if your\r\nexcellency pleases, we can leave as soon as you like—we can sail as\r\nwell by night as by day, and if the wind drops we can use our oars.”\r\n\r\nAs Franz had sufficient time, and his apartments at Rome were not yet\r\navailable, he accepted the proposition. Upon his answer in the\r\naffirmative, the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone.\r\n“Well,” asked he, “what now? Is there any difficulty in the way?”\r\n\r\n“No.” replied the captain, “but we must warn your excellency that the\r\nisland is an infected port.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Monte Cristo although uninhabited, yet serves occasionally as a refuge\r\nfor the smugglers and pirates who come from Corsica, Sardinia, and\r\nAfrica, and if it becomes known that we have been there, we shall have\r\nto perform quarantine for six days on our return to Leghorn.”\r\n\r\n“The deuce! That puts a different face on the matter. Six days! Why,\r\nthat’s as long as the Almighty took to make the world! Too long a\r\nwait—too long.”\r\n\r\n“But who will say your excellency has been to Monte Cristo?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I shall not,” cried Franz.\r\n\r\n“Nor I, nor I,” chorused the sailors.\r\n\r\n“Then steer for Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\nThe captain gave his orders, the helm was put up, and the boat was soon\r\nsailing in the direction of the island. Franz waited until all was in\r\norder, and when the sail was filled, and the four sailors had taken\r\ntheir places—three forward, and one at the helm—he resumed the\r\nconversation. “Gaetano,” said he to the captain, “you tell me Monte\r\nCristo serves as a refuge for pirates, who are, it seems to me, a very\r\ndifferent kind of game from the goats.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your excellency, and it is true.”\r\n\r\n“I knew there were smugglers, but I thought that since the capture of\r\nAlgiers, and the destruction of the regency, pirates existed only in\r\nthe romances of Cooper and Captain Marryat.”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency is mistaken; there are pirates, like the bandits who\r\nwere believed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo XII., and who yet,\r\nevery day, rob travellers at the gates of Rome. Has not your excellency\r\nheard that the French _chargé d’affaires_ was robbed six months ago\r\nwithin five hundred paces of Velletri?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I heard that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, if, like us, your excellency lived at Leghorn, you would\r\nhear, from time to time, that a little merchant vessel, or an English\r\nyacht that was expected at Bastia, at Porto-Ferrajo, or at Civita\r\nVecchia, has not arrived; no one knows what has become of it, but,\r\ndoubtless, it has struck on a rock and foundered. Now this rock it has\r\nmet has been a long and narrow boat, manned by six or eight men, who\r\nhave surprised and plundered it, some dark and stormy night, near some\r\ndesert and gloomy island, as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses\r\nof a forest.”\r\n\r\n“But,” asked Franz, who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the\r\nboat, “why do not those who have been plundered complain to the French,\r\nSardinian, or Tuscan governments?”\r\n\r\n“Why?” said Gaetano with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Yes, why?”\r\n\r\n“Because, in the first place, they transfer from the vessel to their\r\nown boat whatever they think worth taking, then they bind the crew hand\r\nand foot, they attach to everyone’s neck a four-and-twenty-pound ball,\r\na large hole is chopped in the vessel’s bottom, and then they leave\r\nher. At the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and\r\nsettle down. First one gun’l goes under, then the other. Then they lift\r\nand sink again, and both go under at once. All at once there’s a noise\r\nlike a cannon—that’s the air blowing up the deck. Soon the water rushes\r\nout of the scupper-holes like a whale spouting, the vessel gives a last\r\ngroan, spins round and round, and disappears, forming a vast whirlpool\r\nin the ocean, and then all is over, so that in five minutes nothing but\r\nthe eye of God can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the\r\nsea. Do you understand now,” said the captain, “why no complaints are\r\nmade to the government, and why the vessel never reaches port?”\r\n\r\nIt is probable that if Gaetano had related this previous to proposing\r\nthe expedition, Franz would have hesitated, but now that they had\r\nstarted, he thought it would be cowardly to draw back. He was one of\r\nthose men who do not rashly court danger, but if danger presents\r\nitself, combat it with the most unalterable coolness. Calm and\r\nresolute, he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a\r\nduel,—calculated its probable method of approach; retreated, if at all,\r\nas a point of strategy and not from cowardice; was quick to see an\r\nopening for attack, and won victory at a single thrust.\r\n\r\n“Bah!” said he, “I have travelled through Sicily and Calabria—I have\r\nsailed two months in the Archipelago, and yet I never saw even the\r\nshadow of a bandit or a pirate.”\r\n\r\n“I did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project,”\r\nreplied Gaetano, “but you questioned me, and I have answered; that’s\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and your conversation is most interesting; and as I wish to enjoy\r\nit as long as possible, steer for Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\nThe wind blew strongly, the boat made six or seven knots an hour, and\r\nthey were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage. As they drew near\r\nthe island seemed to lift from the sea, and the air was so clear that\r\nthey could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another, like\r\ncannon balls in an arsenal, with green bushes and trees growing in the\r\ncrevices. As for the sailors, although they appeared perfectly tranquil\r\nyet it was evident that they were on the alert, and that they carefully\r\nwatched the glassy surface over which they were sailing, and on which a\r\nfew fishing-boats, with their white sails, were alone visible.\r\n\r\nThey were within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to\r\nset behind Corsica, whose mountains appeared against the sky, showing\r\ntheir rugged peaks in bold relief; this mass of rock, like the giant\r\nAdamastor, rose dead ahead, a formidable barrier, and intercepting the\r\nlight that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in\r\nshadow. Little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive\r\nbefore it the last rays of the expiring day; at last the reflection\r\nrested on the summit of the mountain, where it paused an instant, like\r\nthe fiery crest of a volcano, then gloom gradually covered the summit\r\nas it had covered the base, and the island now only appeared to be a\r\ngray mountain that grew continually darker; half an hour after, the\r\nnight was quite dark.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the mariners were used to these latitudes, and knew every\r\nrock in the Tuscan Archipelago; for in the midst of this obscurity\r\nFranz was not without uneasiness—Corsica had long since disappeared,\r\nand Monte Cristo itself was invisible; but the sailors seemed, like the\r\nlynx, to see in the dark, and the pilot who steered did not evince the\r\nslightest hesitation.\r\n\r\nAn hour had passed since the sun had set, when Franz fancied he saw, at\r\na quarter of a mile to the left, a dark mass, but he could not\r\nprecisely make out what it was, and fearing to excite the mirth of the\r\nsailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land, he remained silent;\r\nsuddenly a great light appeared on the strand; land might resemble a\r\ncloud, but the fire was not a meteor.\r\n\r\n“What is this light?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said the captain; “it is a fire.”\r\n\r\n“But you told me the island was uninhabited?”\r\n\r\n“I said there were no fixed habitations on it, but I said also that it\r\nserved sometimes as a harbor for smugglers.”\r\n\r\n“And for pirates?”\r\n\r\n“And for pirates,” returned Gaetano, repeating Franz’s words. “It is\r\nfor that reason I have given orders to pass the island, for, as you\r\nsee, the fire is behind us.”\r\n\r\n“But this fire?” continued Franz. “It seems to me rather reassuring\r\nthan otherwise; men who did not wish to be seen would not light a\r\nfire.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that goes for nothing,” said Gaetano. “If you can guess the\r\nposition of the island in the darkness, you will see that the fire\r\ncannot be seen from the side or from Pianosa, but only from the sea.”\r\n\r\n“You think, then, this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant\r\nneighbors?”\r\n\r\n“That is what we must find out,” returned Gaetano, fixing his eyes on\r\nthis terrestrial star.\r\n\r\n“How can you find out?”\r\n\r\n“You shall see.”\r\n\r\nGaetano consulted with his companions, and after five minutes’\r\ndiscussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack\r\nabout, they returned the way they had come, and in a few minutes the\r\nfire disappeared, hidden by an elevation of the land. The pilot again\r\nchanged the course of the boat, which rapidly approached the island,\r\nand was soon within fifty paces of it. Gaetano lowered the sail, and\r\nthe boat came to rest. All this was done in silence, and from the\r\nmoment that their course was changed not a word was spoken.\r\n\r\nGaetano, who had proposed the expedition, had taken all the\r\nresponsibility on himself; the four sailors fixed their eyes on him,\r\nwhile they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row\r\naway, which, thanks to the darkness, would not be difficult. As for\r\nFranz, he examined his arms with the utmost coolness; he had two\r\ndouble-barrelled guns and a rifle; he loaded them, looked at the\r\npriming, and waited quietly.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt, and\r\nsecured his trousers round his waist; his feet were naked, so he had no\r\nshoes and stockings to take off; after these preparations he placed his\r\nfinger on his lips, and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea, swam\r\ntowards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear\r\nthe slightest sound; he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line\r\nin his wake. This track soon disappeared; it was evident that he had\r\ntouched the shore.\r\n\r\nEveryone on board remained motionless for half an hour, when the same\r\nluminous track was again observed, and the swimmer was soon on board.\r\n\r\n“Well?” exclaimed Franz and the sailors in unison.\r\n\r\n“They are Spanish smugglers,” said he; “they have with them two\r\nCorsican bandits.”\r\n\r\n“And what are these Corsican bandits doing here with Spanish\r\nsmugglers?”\r\n\r\n“Alas,” returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity,\r\n“we ought always to help one another. Very often the bandits are hard\r\npressed by gendarmes or carbineers; well, they see a vessel, and good\r\nfellows like us on board, they come and demand hospitality of us; you\r\ncan’t refuse help to a poor hunted devil; we receive them, and for\r\ngreater security we stand out to sea. This costs us nothing, and saves\r\nthe life, or at least the liberty, of a fellow-creature, who on the\r\nfirst occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where\r\nwe can land our goods without interruption.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Franz, “then you are a smuggler occasionally, Gaetano?”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency, we must live somehow,” returned the other, smiling\r\nimpenetrably.\r\n\r\n“Then you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, we sailors are like freemasons, and recognize each other by\r\nsigns.”\r\n\r\n“And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing at all; smugglers are not thieves.”\r\n\r\n“But these two Corsican bandits?” said Franz, calculating the chances\r\nof peril.\r\n\r\n“It is not their fault that they are bandits, but that of the\r\nauthorities.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“Because they are pursued for having made a stiff, as if it was not in\r\na Corsican’s nature to revenge himself.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by having made a stiff?—having assassinated a man?”\r\nsaid Franz, continuing his investigation.\r\n\r\n“I mean that they have killed an enemy, which is a very different\r\nthing,” returned the captain.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the young man, “let us demand hospitality of these\r\nsmugglers and bandits. Do you think they will grant it?”\r\n\r\n“Without doubt.”\r\n\r\n“How many are they?”\r\n\r\n“Four, and the two bandits make six.”\r\n\r\n“Just our number, so that if they prove troublesome, we shall be able\r\nto hold them in check; so, for the last time, steer to Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions.”\r\n\r\n“By all means, be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses; I do\r\nmore than permit, I exhort you.”\r\n\r\n“Silence, then!” said Gaetano.\r\n\r\nEveryone obeyed. For a man who, like Franz, viewed his position in its\r\ntrue light, it was a grave one. He was alone in the darkness with\r\nsailors whom he did not know, and who had no reason to be devoted to\r\nhim; who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt, and who\r\nhad often examined his weapons,—which were very beautiful,—if not with\r\nenvy, at least with curiosity. On the other hand, he was about to land,\r\nwithout any other escort than these men, on an island which had,\r\nindeed, a very religious name, but which did not seem to Franz likely\r\nto afford him much hospitality, thanks to the smugglers and bandits.\r\nThe history of the scuttled vessels, which had appeared improbable\r\nduring the day, seemed very probable at night; placed as he was between\r\ntwo possible sources of danger, he kept his eye on the crew, and his\r\ngun in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe sailors had again hoisted sail, and the vessel was once more\r\ncleaving the waves. Through the darkness Franz, whose eyes were now\r\nmore accustomed to it, could see the looming shore along which the boat\r\nwas sailing, and then, as they rounded a rocky point, he saw the fire\r\nmore brilliant than ever, and about it five or six persons seated. The\r\nblaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around. Gaetano skirted the\r\nlight, carefully keeping the boat in the shadow; then, when they were\r\nopposite the fire, he steered to the centre of the circle, singing a\r\nfishing song, of which his companions sung the chorus.\r\n\r\nAt the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and\r\napproached the landing-place, their eyes fixed on the boat, evidently\r\nseeking to know who the new-comers were and what were their intentions.\r\nThey soon appeared satisfied and returned (with the exception of one,\r\nwho remained at the shore) to their fire, at which the carcass of a\r\ngoat was roasting. When the boat was within twenty paces of the shore,\r\nthe man on the beach, who carried a carbine, presented arms after the\r\nmanner of a sentinel, and cried, “Who comes there?” in Sardinian.\r\n\r\nFranz coolly cocked both barrels. Gaetano then exchanged a few words\r\nwith this man which the traveller did not understand, but which\r\nevidently concerned him.\r\n\r\n“Will your excellency give your name, or remain _incognito_?” asked the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n“My name must rest unknown,” replied Franz; “merely say I am a\r\nFrenchman travelling for pleasure.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as Gaetano had transmitted this answer, the sentinel gave an\r\norder to one of the men seated round the fire, who rose and disappeared\r\namong the rocks. Not a word was spoken, everyone seemed occupied, Franz\r\nwith his disembarkment, the sailors with their sails, the smugglers\r\nwith their goat; but in the midst of all this carelessness it was\r\nevident that they mutually observed each other.\r\n\r\nThe man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to\r\nthat by which he had left; he made a sign with his head to the\r\nsentinel, who, turning to the boat, said, “_S’accommodi_.” The Italian\r\n_s’accommodi_ is untranslatable; it means at once, “Come, enter, you\r\nare welcome; make yourself at home; you are the master.” It is like\r\nthat Turkish phrase of Molière’s that so astonished the bourgeois\r\ngentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance.\r\n\r\nThe sailors did not wait for a second invitation; four strokes of the\r\noar brought them to land; Gaetano sprang to shore, exchanged a few\r\nwords with the sentinel, then his comrades disembarked, and lastly came\r\nFranz. One of his guns was swung over his shoulder, Gaetano had the\r\nother, and a sailor held his rifle; his dress, half artist, half dandy,\r\ndid not excite any suspicion, and, consequently, no disquietude. The\r\nboat was moored to the shore, and they advanced a few paces to find a\r\ncomfortable bivouac; but, doubtless, the spot they chose did not suit\r\nthe smuggler who filled the post of sentinel, for he cried out:\r\n\r\n“Not that way, if you please.”\r\n\r\nGaetano faltered an excuse, and advanced to the opposite side, while\r\ntwo sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way.\r\n\r\nThey advanced about thirty paces, and then stopped at a small esplanade\r\nsurrounded with rocks, in which seats had been cut, not unlike\r\nsentry-boxes. Around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks\r\nand thick bushes of myrtles. Franz lowered a torch, and saw by the mass\r\nof cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover\r\nthis retreat, which was, doubtless, one of the halting-places of the\r\nwandering visitors of Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\nAs for his suspicions, once on _terra firma_, once that he had seen the\r\nindifferent, if not friendly, appearance of his hosts, his anxiety had\r\nquite disappeared, or rather, at sight of the goat, had turned to\r\nappetite. He mentioned this to Gaetano, who replied that nothing could\r\nbe more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat,\r\nbread, wine, half a dozen partridges, and a good fire to roast them by.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” added he, “if the smell of their roast meat tempts you, I\r\nwill go and offer them two of our birds for a slice.”\r\n\r\n“You are a born diplomat,” returned Franz; “go and try.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with\r\nwhich they made a fire. Franz waited impatiently, inhaling the aroma of\r\nthe roasted meat, when the captain returned with a mysterious air.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Franz, “anything new?—do they refuse?”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” returned Gaetano, “the chief, who was told you were\r\na young Frenchman, invites you to sup with him.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” observed Franz, “this chief is very polite, and I see no\r\nobjection—the more so as I bring my share of the supper.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is not that; he has plenty, and to spare, for supper; but he\r\nmakes one condition, and rather a peculiar one, before he will receive\r\nyou at his house.”\r\n\r\n“His house? Has he built one here, then?”\r\n\r\n“No, but he has a very comfortable one all the same, so they say.”\r\n\r\n“You know this chief, then?”\r\n\r\n“I have heard talk of him.”\r\n\r\n“Favorably or otherwise?”\r\n\r\n“Both.”\r\n\r\n“The deuce!—and what is this condition?”\r\n\r\n“That you are blindfolded, and do not take off the bandage until he\r\nhimself bids you.”\r\n\r\nFranz looked at Gaetano, to see, if possible, what he thought of this\r\nproposal. “Ah,” replied he, guessing Franz’s thought, “I know this is a\r\nserious matter.”\r\n\r\n“What should you do in my place?”\r\n\r\n“I, who have nothing to lose,—I should go.”\r\n\r\n20075m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You would accept?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, were it only out of curiosity.”\r\n\r\n“There is something very peculiar about this chief, then?”\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said Gaetano, lowering his voice, “I do not know if what they\r\nsay is true”—he stopped to see if anyone was near.\r\n\r\n“What do they say?”\r\n\r\n“That this chief inhabits a cavern to which the Pitti Palace is\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\n“What nonsense!” said Franz, reseating himself.\r\n\r\n“It is no nonsense; it is quite true. Cama, the pilot of the _Saint\r\nFerdinand_, went in once, and he came back amazed, vowing that such\r\ntreasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” observed Franz, “that with such stories you make me\r\nthink of Ali Baba’s enchanted cavern?”\r\n\r\n“I tell you what I have been told.”\r\n\r\n“Then you advise me to accept?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t say that; your excellency will do as you please; I should\r\nbe sorry to advise you in the matter.”\r\n\r\nFranz pondered the matter for a few moments, concluded that a man so\r\nrich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he\r\nhad, and seeing only the prospect of a good supper, accepted. Gaetano\r\ndeparted with the reply. Franz was prudent, and wished to learn all he\r\npossibly could concerning his host. He turned towards the sailor, who,\r\nduring this dialogue, had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the\r\nair of a man proud of his office, and asked him how these men had\r\nlanded, as no vessel of any kind was visible.\r\n\r\n“Never mind that,” returned the sailor, “I know their vessel.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a very beautiful vessel?”\r\n\r\n“I would not wish for a better to sail round the world.”\r\n\r\n“Of what burden is she?”\r\n\r\n“About a hundred tons; but she is built to stand any weather. She is\r\nwhat the English call a yacht.”\r\n\r\n“Where was she built?”\r\n\r\n“I know not; but my own opinion is she is a Genoese.”\r\n\r\n“And how did a leader of smugglers,” continued Franz, “venture to build\r\na vessel designed for such a purpose at Genoa?”\r\n\r\n“I did not say that the owner was a smuggler,” replied the sailor.\r\n\r\n“No; but Gaetano did, I thought.”\r\n\r\n“Gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance, he had not then\r\nspoken to anyone.”\r\n\r\n“And if this person be not a smuggler, who is he?”\r\n\r\n“A wealthy signor, who travels for his pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” thought Franz, “he is still more mysterious, since the two\r\naccounts do not agree.”\r\n\r\n“What is his name?”\r\n\r\n“If you ask him, he says Sinbad the Sailor; but I doubt if it be his\r\nreal name.”\r\n\r\n“Sinbad the Sailor?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And where does he reside?”\r\n\r\n“On the sea.”\r\n\r\n“What country does he come from?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever seen him?”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of a man is he?”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency will judge for yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Where will he receive me?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt in the subterranean palace Gaetano told you of.”\r\n\r\n“Have you never had the curiosity, when you have landed and found this\r\nisland deserted, to seek for this enchanted palace?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, more than once, but always in vain; we examined the grotto\r\nall over, but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening;\r\nthey say that the door is not opened by a key, but a magic word.”\r\n\r\n“Decidedly,” muttered Franz, “this is an Arabian Nights’ adventure.”\r\n\r\n“His excellency waits for you,” said a voice, which he recognized as\r\nthat of the sentinel. He was accompanied by two of the yacht’s crew.\r\n\r\nFranz drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and presented it to the\r\nman who had spoken to him. Without uttering a word, they bandaged his\r\neyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some\r\nindiscretion. Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make\r\nthe least attempt to raise the bandage. He promised.\r\n\r\nThen his two guides took his arms, and he went on, guided by them, and\r\npreceded by the sentinel. After going about thirty paces, he smelt the\r\nappetizing odor of the kid that was roasting, and knew thus that he was\r\npassing the bivouac; they then led him on about fifty paces farther,\r\nevidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not\r\nallow Gaetano to go—a refusal he could now comprehend.\r\n\r\nPresently, by a change in the atmosphere, he knew that they were\r\nentering a cave; after going on for a few seconds more he heard a\r\ncrackling, and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed,\r\nand became balmy and perfumed. At length his feet touched on a thick\r\nand soft carpet, and his guides let go their hold of him. There was a\r\nmoment’s silence, and then a voice, in excellent French, although, with\r\na foreign accent, said:\r\n\r\n“Welcome, sir. I beg you will remove your bandage.”\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed, then, Franz did not wait for a repetition of this\r\npermission, but took off the handkerchief, and found himself in the\r\npresence of a man from thirty-eight to forty years of age, dressed in a\r\nTunisian costume, that is to say, a red cap with a long blue silk\r\ntassel, a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold, pantaloons of deep\r\nred, large and full gaiters of the same color, embroidered with gold\r\nlike the vest, and yellow slippers; he had a splendid cashmere round\r\nhis waist, and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his\r\ngirdle.\r\n\r\nAlthough of a paleness that was almost livid, this man had a remarkably\r\nhandsome face; his eyes were penetrating and sparkling; his nose, quite\r\nstraight, and projecting direct from the brow, was of the pure Greek\r\ntype, while his teeth, as white as pearls, were set off to admiration\r\nby the black moustache that encircled them.\r\n\r\nHis pallor was so peculiar, that it seemed to pertain to one who had\r\nbeen long entombed, and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow\r\nand hue of life. He was not particularly tall, but extremely well made,\r\nand, like the men of the South, had small hands and feet. But what\r\nastonished Franz, who had treated Gaetano’s description as a fable, was\r\nthe splendor of the apartment in which he found himself.\r\n\r\nThe entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade, worked with flowers\r\nof gold. In a recess was a kind of divan, surmounted with a stand of\r\nArabian swords in silver scabbards, and the handles resplendent with\r\ngems; from the ceiling hung a lamp of Venetian glass, of beautiful\r\nshape and color, while the feet rested on a Turkey carpet, in which\r\nthey sunk to the instep; tapestry hung before the door by which Franz\r\nhad entered, and also in front of another door, leading into a second\r\napartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated.\r\n\r\nThe host gave Franz time to recover from his surprise, and, moreover,\r\nreturned look for look, not even taking his eyes off him.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” he said, after a pause, “a thousand excuses for the precaution\r\ntaken in your introduction hither; but as, during the greater portion\r\nof the year, this island is deserted, if the secret of this abode were\r\ndiscovered, I should doubtless, find on my return my temporary\r\nretirement in a state of great disorder, which would be exceedingly\r\nannoying, not for the loss it occasioned me, but because I should not\r\nhave the certainty I now possess of separating myself from all the rest\r\nof mankind at pleasure. Let me now endeavor to make you forget this\r\ntemporary unpleasantness, and offer you what no doubt you did not\r\nexpect to find here—that is to say, a tolerable supper and pretty\r\ncomfortable beds.”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, my dear sir,” replied Franz, “make no apologies. I have\r\nalways observed that they bandage people’s eyes who penetrate enchanted\r\npalaces, for instance, those of Raoul in the _Huguenots_, and really I\r\nhave nothing to complain of, for what I see makes me think of the\r\nwonders of the _Arabian Nights_.”\r\n\r\n20079m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Alas! I may say with Lucullus, if I could have anticipated the honor\r\nof your visit, I would have prepared for it. But such as is my\r\nhermitage, it is at your disposal; such as is my supper, it is yours to\r\nshare, if you will. Ali, is the supper ready?”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the tapestry moved aside, and a Nubian, black as ebony,\r\nand dressed in a plain white tunic, made a sign to his master that all\r\nwas prepared in the dining-room.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the unknown to Franz, “I do not know if you are of my\r\nopinion, but I think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or\r\nthree hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to\r\naddress one another. Pray observe, that I too much respect the laws of\r\nhospitality to ask your name or title. I only request you to give me\r\none by which I may have the pleasure of addressing you. As for myself,\r\nthat I may put you at your ease, I tell you that I am generally called\r\n‘Sinbad the Sailor.’”\r\n\r\n“And I,” replied Franz, “will tell you, as I only require his wonderful\r\nlamp to make me precisely like Aladdin, that I see no reason why at\r\nthis moment I should not be called Aladdin. That will keep us from\r\ngoing away from the East whither I am tempted to think I have been\r\nconveyed by some good genius.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, Signor Aladdin,” replied the singular Amphitryon, “you\r\nheard our repast announced, will you now take the trouble to enter the\r\ndining-room, your humble servant going first to show the way?”\r\n\r\nAt these words, moving aside the tapestry, Sinbad preceded his guest.\r\nFranz now looked upon another scene of enchantment; the table was\r\nsplendidly covered, and once convinced of this important point he cast\r\nhis eyes around him. The dining-room was scarcely less striking than\r\nthe room he had just left; it was entirely of marble, with antique\r\nbas-reliefs of priceless value; and at the four corners of this\r\napartment, which was oblong, were four magnificent statues, having\r\nbaskets in their hands. These baskets contained four pyramids of most\r\nsplendid fruit; there were Sicily pine-apples, pomegranates from\r\nMalaga, oranges from the Balearic Isles, peaches from France, and dates\r\nfrom Tunis.\r\n\r\nThe supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with Corsican\r\nblackbirds; a boar’s ham with jelly, a quarter of a kid with tartar\r\nsauce, a glorious turbot, and a gigantic lobster. Between these large\r\ndishes were smaller ones containing various dainties. The dishes were\r\nof silver, and the plates of Japanese china.\r\n\r\nFranz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a\r\ndream. Ali alone was present to wait at table, and acquitted himself so\r\nadmirably, that the guest complimented his host thereupon.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied he, while he did the honors of the supper with much ease\r\nand grace—“yes, he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me, and does\r\nall he can to prove it. He remembers that I saved his life, and as he\r\nhas a regard for his head, he feels some gratitude towards me for\r\nhaving kept it on his shoulders.”\r\n\r\nAli approached his master, took his hand, and kissed it.\r\n\r\n“Would it be impertinent, Signor Sinbad,” said Franz, “to ask you the\r\nparticulars of this kindness?”\r\n\r\n20081m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, they are simple enough,” replied the host. “It seems the fellow\r\nhad been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the Bey of Tunis than\r\netiquette permits to one of his color, and he was condemned by the Bey\r\nto have his tongue cut out, and his hand and head cut off; the tongue\r\nthe first day, the hand the second, and the head the third. I always\r\nhad a desire to have a mute in my service, so learning the day his\r\ntongue was cut out, I went to the Bey, and proposed to give him for Ali\r\na splendid double-barreled gun, which I knew he was very desirous of\r\nhaving. He hesitated a moment, he was so very desirous to complete the\r\npoor devil’s punishment. But when I added to the gun an English cutlass\r\nwith which I had shivered his highness’s yataghan to pieces, the Bey\r\nyielded, and agreed to forgive the hand and head, but on condition that\r\nthe poor fellow never again set foot in Tunis. This was a useless\r\nclause in the bargain, for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse\r\nof the shores of Africa, he runs down below, and can only be induced to\r\nappear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe.”\r\n\r\nFranz remained a moment silent and pensive, hardly knowing what to\r\nthink of the half-kindness, half-cruelty, with which his host related\r\nthe brief narrative.\r\n\r\n“And like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed,” he said,\r\nby way of changing the conversation, “you pass your life in\r\ntravelling?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I made a vow at a time when I little thought I should ever be\r\nable to accomplish it,” said the unknown with a singular smile; “and I\r\nmade some others also which I hope I may fulfil in due season.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness, his eyes\r\ngave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity.\r\n\r\n“You have suffered a great deal, sir?” said Franz inquiringly.\r\n\r\nSinbad started and looked fixedly at him, as he replied, “What makes\r\nyou suppose so?”\r\n\r\n“Everything,” answered Franz,—“your voice, your look, your pallid\r\ncomplexion, and even the life you lead.”\r\n\r\n“I?—I live the happiest life possible, the real life of a pasha. I am\r\nking of all creation. I am pleased with one place, and stay there; I\r\nget tired of it, and leave it; I am free as a bird and have wings like\r\none; my attendants obey my slightest wish. Sometimes I amuse myself by\r\ndelivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law. Then I\r\nhave my mode of dispensing justice, silent and sure, without respite or\r\nappeal, which condemns or pardons, and which no one sees. Ah, if you\r\nhad tasted my life, you would not desire any other, and would never\r\nreturn to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“Revenge, for instance!” observed Franz.\r\n\r\nThe unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate\r\ninto the depth of the heart and thoughts. “And why revenge?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Because,” replied Franz, “you seem to me like a man who, persecuted by\r\nsociety, has a fearful account to settle with it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” responded Sinbad, laughing with his singular laugh, which\r\ndisplayed his white and sharp teeth. “You have not guessed rightly.\r\nSuch as you see me I am, a sort of philosopher, and one day perhaps I\r\nshall go to Paris to rival Monsieur Appert, and the man in the little\r\nblue cloak.”\r\n\r\n“And will that be the first time you ever took that journey?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it will. I must seem to you by no means curious, but I assure you\r\nthat it is not my fault I have delayed it so long—it will happen one\r\nday or the other.”\r\n\r\n20083m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know; it depends on circumstances which depend on certain\r\narrangements.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to be there at the time you come, and I will endeavor to\r\nrepay you, as far as lies in my power, for your liberal hospitality\r\ndisplayed to me at Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\n“I should avail myself of your offer with pleasure,” replied the host,\r\n“but, unfortunately, if I go there, it will be, in all probability,\r\n_incognito_.”\r\n\r\nThe supper appeared to have been supplied solely for Franz, for the\r\nunknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to\r\nwhich his guest did ample justice. Then Ali brought on the dessert, or\r\nrather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them\r\non the table. Between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with\r\na silver cover. The care with which Ali placed this cup on the table\r\nroused Franz’s curiosity. He raised the cover and saw a kind of\r\ngreenish paste, something like preserved angelica, but which was\r\nperfectly unknown to him. He replaced the lid, as ignorant of what the\r\ncup contained as he was before he had looked at it, and then casting\r\nhis eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment.\r\n\r\n“You cannot guess,” said he, “what there is in that small vase, can\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“No, I really cannot.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia\r\nwhich Hebe served at the table of Jupiter.”\r\n\r\n“But,” replied Franz, “this ambrosia, no doubt, in passing through\r\nmortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human\r\nname; in vulgar phrase, what may you term this composition, for which,\r\nto tell the truth, I do not feel any particular desire?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, thus it is that our material origin is revealed,” cried Sinbad;\r\n“we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing, without\r\nregarding it, or if we do see and regard it, yet without recognizing\r\nit. Are you a man for the substantials, and is gold your god? taste\r\nthis, and the mines of Peru, Guzerat, and Golconda are opened to you.\r\nAre you a man of imagination—a poet? taste this, and the boundaries of\r\npossibility disappear; the fields of infinite space open to you, you\r\nadvance free in heart, free in mind, into the boundless realms of\r\nunfettered reverie. Are you ambitious, and do you seek after the\r\ngreatnesses of the earth? taste this, and in an hour you will be a\r\nking, not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of Europe\r\nlike France, Spain, or England, but king of the world, king of the\r\nuniverse, king of creation; without bowing at the feet of Satan, you\r\nwill be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth. Is it not\r\ntempting what I offer you, and is it not an easy thing, since it is\r\nonly to do thus? look!”\r\n\r\nAt these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance\r\nso lauded, took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat, raised it to his\r\nlips, and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent\r\nbackwards. Franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite\r\nsweetmeat, but when he had finished, he inquired:\r\n\r\n“What, then, is this precious stuff?”\r\n\r\n“Did you ever hear,” he replied, “of the Old Man of the Mountain, who\r\nattempted to assassinate Philippe Auguste?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I have.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the\r\nmountain whence he derived his picturesque name. In this valley were\r\nmagnificent gardens planted by Hassen-ben-Sabah, and in these gardens\r\nisolated pavilions. Into these pavilions he admitted the elect, and\r\nthere, says Marco Polo, gave them to eat a certain herb, which\r\ntransported them to Paradise, in the midst of ever-blooming shrubs,\r\never-ripe fruit, and ever-lovely virgins. What these happy persons took\r\nfor reality was but a dream; but it was a dream so soft, so voluptuous,\r\nso enthralling, that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave\r\nit to them, and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity, struck\r\ndown the designated victim, died in torture without a murmur, believing\r\nthat the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life\r\nof delights of which the holy herb, now before you, had given them a\r\nslight foretaste.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” cried Franz, “it is hashish! I know that—by name at least.”\r\n\r\n“That is it precisely, Signor Aladdin; it is hashish—the purest and\r\nmost unadulterated hashish of Alexandria,—the hashish of Abou-Gor, the\r\ncelebrated maker, the only man, the man to whom there should be built a\r\npalace, inscribed with these words, _A grateful world to the dealer in\r\nhappiness_.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” said Franz, “I have a very great inclination to judge\r\nfor myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies.”\r\n\r\n“Judge for yourself, Signor Aladdin—judge, but do not confine yourself\r\nto one trial. Like everything else, we must habituate the senses to a\r\nfresh impression, gentle or violent, sad or joyous. There is a struggle\r\nin nature against this divine substance,—in nature which is not made\r\nfor joy and clings to pain. Nature subdued must yield in the combat,\r\nthe dream must succeed to reality, and then the dream reigns supreme,\r\nthen the dream becomes life, and life becomes the dream. But what\r\nchanges occur! It is only by comparing the pains of actual being with\r\nthe joys of the assumed existence, that you would desire to live no\r\nlonger, but to dream thus forever. When you return to this mundane\r\nsphere from your visionary world, you would seem to leave a Neapolitan\r\nspring for a Lapland winter—to quit paradise for earth—heaven for hell!\r\nTaste the hashish, guest of mine—taste the hashish.”\r\n\r\nFranz’s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous\r\npreparation, about as much in quantity as his host had eaten, and lift\r\nit to his mouth.\r\n\r\n“_Diable!_” he said, after having swallowed the divine preserve. “I do\r\nnot know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe, but the\r\nthing does not appear to me as palatable as you say.”\r\n\r\n“Because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the\r\nsubstances it flavors. Tell me, the first time you tasted oysters, tea,\r\nporter, truffles, and sundry other dainties which you now adore, did\r\nyou like them? Could you comprehend how the Romans stuffed their\r\npheasants with assafœtida, and the Chinese eat swallows’ nests? Eh? no!\r\nWell, it is the same with hashish; only eat for a week, and nothing in\r\nthe world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor, which\r\nnow appears to you flat and distasteful. Let us now go into the\r\nadjoining chamber, which is your apartment, and Ali will bring us\r\ncoffee and pipes.”\r\n\r\nThey both arose, and while he who called himself Sinbad—and whom we\r\nhave occasionally named so, that we might, like his guest, have some\r\ntitle by which to distinguish him—gave some orders to the servant,\r\nFranz entered still another apartment.\r\n\r\nIt was simply yet richly furnished. It was round, and a large divan\r\ncompletely encircled it. Divan, walls, ceiling, floor, were all covered\r\nwith magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets; there\r\nwere heavy-maned lion-skins from Atlas, striped tiger-skins from\r\nBengal; panther-skins from the Cape, spotted beautifully, like those\r\nthat appeared to Dante; bear-skins from Siberia, fox-skins from Norway,\r\nand so on; and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the\r\nother, so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf, or\r\nreclining on the most luxurious bed.\r\n\r\nBoth laid themselves down on the divan; chibouques with jasmine tubes\r\nand amber mouthpieces were within reach, and all prepared so that there\r\nwas no need to smoke the same pipe twice. Each of them took one, which\r\nAli lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s silence, during which Sinbad gave himself up to\r\nthoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly, even in the midst of\r\nhis conversation; and Franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie,\r\ninto which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco, which seems\r\nto remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind, and to give the\r\nsmoker in exchange all the visions of the soul. Ali brought in the\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n“How do you take it?” inquired the unknown; “in the French or Turkish\r\nstyle, strong or weak, sugar or none, cool or boiling? As you please;\r\nit is ready in all ways.”\r\n\r\n“I will take it in the Turkish style,” replied Franz.\r\n\r\n“And you are right,” said his host; “it shows you have a tendency for\r\nan Oriental life. Ah, those Orientals; they are the only men who know\r\nhow to live. As for me,” he added, with one of those singular smiles\r\nwhich did not escape the young man, “when I have completed my affairs\r\nin Paris, I shall go and die in the East; and should you wish to see me\r\nagain, you must seek me at Cairo, Bagdad, or Ispahan.”\r\n\r\n20087m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_,” said Franz, “it would be the easiest thing in the world;\r\nfor I feel eagle’s wings springing out at my shoulders, and with those\r\nwings I could make a tour of the world in four-and-twenty hours.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, the hashish is beginning its work. Well, unfurl your wings,\r\nand fly into superhuman regions; fear nothing, there is a watch over\r\nyou; and if your wings, like those of Icarus, melt before the sun, we\r\nare here to ease your fall.”\r\n\r\nHe then said something in Arabic to Ali, who made a sign of obedience\r\nand withdrew, but not to any distance.\r\n\r\nAs to Franz a strange transformation had taken place in him. All the\r\nbodily fatigue of the day, all the preoccupation of mind which the\r\nevents of the evening had brought on, disappeared as they do at the\r\nfirst approach of sleep, when we are still sufficiently conscious to be\r\naware of the coming of slumber. His body seemed to acquire an airy\r\nlightness, his perception brightened in a remarkable manner, his senses\r\nseemed to redouble their power, the horizon continued to expand; but it\r\nwas not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms, and which he had seen\r\nbefore he slept, but a blue, transparent, unbounded horizon, with all\r\nthe blue of the ocean, all the spangles of the sun, all the perfumes of\r\nthe summer breeze; then, in the midst of the songs of his\r\nsailors,—songs so clear and sonorous, that they would have made a\r\ndivine harmony had their notes been taken down,—he saw the Island of\r\nMonte Cristo, no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the\r\nwaves, but as an oasis in the desert; then, as his boat drew nearer,\r\nthe songs became louder, for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose\r\nto heaven, as if some Loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither, or\r\nAmphion, the enchanter, intended there to build a city.\r\n\r\nAt length the boat touched the shore, but without effort, without\r\nshock, as lips touch lips; and he entered the grotto amidst continued\r\nstrains of most delicious melody. He descended, or rather seemed to\r\ndescend, several steps, inhaling the fresh and balmy air, like that\r\nwhich may be supposed to reign around the grotto of Circe, formed from\r\nsuch perfumes as set the mind a-dreaming, and such fires as burn the\r\nvery senses; and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep, from\r\nSinbad, his singular host, to Ali, the mute attendant; then all seemed\r\nto fade away and become confused before his eyes, like the last shadows\r\nof the magic lantern before it is extinguished, and he was again in the\r\nchamber of statues, lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps\r\nwhich watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure.\r\n\r\nThey were the same statues, rich in form, in attraction, and poesy,\r\nwith eyes of fascination, smiles of love, and bright and flowing hair.\r\nThey were Phryne, Cleopatra, Messalina, those three celebrated\r\ncourtesans. Then among them glided like a pure ray, like a Christian\r\nangel in the midst of Olympus, one of those chaste figures, those calm\r\nshadows, those soft visions, which seemed to veil its virgin brow\r\nbefore these marble wantons.\r\n\r\nThen the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love, and\r\napproached the couch on which he was reposing, their feet hidden in\r\ntheir long white tunics, their throats bare, hair flowing like waves,\r\nand assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist, but which\r\nsaints withstood, and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which\r\nthe serpent charms the bird; and then he gave way before looks that\r\nheld him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a\r\nvoluptuous kiss.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Franz that he closed his eyes, and in a last look about\r\nhim saw the vision of modesty completely veiled; and then followed a\r\ndream of passion like that promised by the Prophet to the elect. Lips\r\nof stone turned to flame, breasts of ice became like heated lava, so\r\nthat to Franz, yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug,\r\nlove was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture, as burning mouths were\r\npressed to his thirsty lips, and he was held in cool serpent-like\r\nembraces. The more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more\r\nhis senses yielded to its thrall, and at length, weary of a struggle\r\nthat taxed his very soul, he gave way and sank back breathless and\r\nexhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses, and the\r\nenchantment of his marvellous dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 32. The Waking\r\n\r\nWhen Franz returned to himself, he seemed still to be in a dream. He\r\nthought himself in a sepulchre, into which a ray of sunlight in pity\r\nscarcely penetrated. He stretched forth his hand, and touched stone; he\r\nrose to his seat, and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of\r\ndry heather, very soft and odoriferous. The vision had fled; and as if\r\nthe statues had been but shadows from the tomb, they had vanished at\r\nhis waking.\r\n\r\nHe advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came, and\r\nto all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality.\r\nHe found that he was in a grotto, went towards the opening, and through\r\na kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky. The air and water\r\nwere shining in the beams of the morning sun; on the shore the sailors\r\nwere sitting, chatting and laughing; and at ten yards from them the\r\nboat was at anchor, undulating gracefully on the water.\r\n\r\nThere for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his\r\nbrow, and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach, that left\r\nagainst the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver. He was for some\r\ntime without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the\r\nthings of nature, specially after a fantastic dream; then gradually\r\nthis view of the outer world, so calm, so pure, so grand, reminded him\r\nof the illusiveness of his vision, and once more awakened memory. He\r\nrecalled his arrival on the island, his presentation to a smuggler\r\nchief, a subterranean palace full of splendor, an excellent supper, and\r\na spoonful of hashish.\r\n\r\nIt seemed, however, even in the very face of open day, that at least a\r\nyear had elapsed since all these things had passed, so deep was the\r\nimpression made in his mind by the dream, and so strong a hold had it\r\ntaken of his imagination. Thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid\r\nthe sailors, seated on a rock, or undulating in the vessel, one of the\r\nshadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses. Otherwise,\r\nhis head was perfectly clear, and his body refreshed; he was free from\r\nthe slightest headache; on the contrary, he felt a certain degree of\r\nlightness, a faculty for absorbing the pure air, and enjoying the\r\nbright sunshine more vividly than ever.\r\n\r\nHe went gayly up to the sailors, who rose as soon as they perceived\r\nhim; and the patron, accosting him, said:\r\n\r\n“The Signor Sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency, and\r\ndesires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his\r\nleave in person; but he trusts you will excuse him, as very important\r\nbusiness calls him to Malaga.”\r\n\r\n“So, then, Gaetano,” said Franz, “this is, then, all reality; there\r\nexists a man who has received me in this island, entertained me right\r\nroyally, and has departed while I was asleep?”\r\n\r\n“He exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all\r\nher sails spread; and if you will use your glass, you will, in all\r\nprobability, recognize your host in the midst of his crew.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was\r\nmaking sail towards the southern point of Corsica. Franz adjusted his\r\ntelescope, and directed it towards the yacht. Gaetano was not mistaken.\r\nAt the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards\r\nthe shore, and holding a spy-glass in his hand. He was attired as he\r\nhad been on the previous evening, and waved his pocket-handkerchief to\r\nhis guest in token of adieu. Franz returned the salute by shaking his\r\nhandkerchief as an exchange of signals. After a second, a slight cloud\r\nof smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel, which rose gracefully as\r\nit expanded in the air, and then Franz heard a slight report.\r\n\r\n“There, do you hear?” observed Gaetano; “he is bidding you adieu.”\r\n\r\nThe young man took his carbine and fired it in the air, but without any\r\nidea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the\r\nyacht from the shore.\r\n\r\n“What are your excellency’s orders?” inquired Gaetano.\r\n\r\n“In the first place, light me a torch.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, I understand,” replied the patron, “to find the entrance to\r\nthe enchanted apartment. With much pleasure, your excellency, if it\r\nwould amuse you; and I will get you the torch you ask for. But I too\r\nhave had the idea you have, and two or three times the same fancy has\r\ncome over me; but I have always given it up. Giovanni, light a torch,”\r\nhe added, “and give it to his excellency.”\r\n\r\nGiovanni obeyed. Franz took the lamp, and entered the subterranean\r\ngrotto, followed by Gaetano. He recognized the place where he had\r\nawaked by the bed of heather that was there; but it was in vain that he\r\ncarried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto. He saw\r\nnothing, unless that, by traces of smoke, others had before him\r\nattempted the same thing, and, like him, in vain. Yet he did not leave\r\na foot of this granite wall, as impenetrable as futurity, without\r\nstrict scrutiny; he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade\r\nof his hunting sword into it, or a projecting point on which he did not\r\nlean and press in the hopes it would give way. All was vain; and he\r\nlost two hours in his attempts, which were at last utterly useless. At\r\nthe end of this time he gave up his search, and Gaetano smiled.\r\n\r\nWhen Franz appeared again on the shore, the yacht only seemed like a\r\nsmall white speck on the horizon. He looked again through his glass,\r\nbut even then he could not distinguish anything.\r\n\r\nGaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting\r\ngoats, which he had utterly forgotten. He took his fowling-piece, and\r\nbegan to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a\r\nduty, rather than enjoying a pleasure; and at the end of a quarter of\r\nan hour he had killed a goat and two kids. These animals, though wild\r\nand agile as chamois, were too much like domestic goats, and Franz\r\ncould not consider them as game. Moreover, other ideas, much more\r\nenthralling, occupied his mind. Since, the evening before, he had\r\nreally been the hero of one of the tales of the _Thousand and One\r\nNights_, and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto.\r\n\r\nThen, in spite of the failure of his first search, he began a second,\r\nafter having told Gaetano to roast one of the two kids. The second\r\nvisit was a long one, and when he returned the kid was roasted and the\r\nrepast ready. Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the\r\nprevious evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper;\r\nand he saw the little yacht, now like a sea-gull on the wave,\r\ncontinuing her flight towards Corsica.\r\n\r\n“Why,” he remarked to Gaetano, “you told me that Signor Sinbad was\r\ngoing to Malaga, while it seems he is in the direction of\r\nPorto-Vecchio.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you remember,” said the patron, “I told you that among the crew\r\nthere were two Corsican brigands?”\r\n\r\n“True; and he is going to land them,” added Franz.\r\n\r\n“Precisely so,” replied Gaetano. “Ah, he is one who fears neither God\r\nnor Satan, they say, and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his\r\ncourse to do a poor devil a service.”\r\n\r\n20093m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“But such services as these might involve him with the authorities of\r\nthe country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy,” said\r\nFranz.\r\n\r\n“And what cares he for that,” replied Gaetano with a laugh, “or any\r\nauthorities? He smiles at them. Let them try to pursue him! Why, in the\r\nfirst place, his yacht is not a ship, but a bird, and he would beat any\r\nfrigate three knots in every nine; and if he were to throw himself on\r\nthe coast, why, is he not certain of finding friends everywhere?”\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly clear that the Signor Sinbad, Franz’s host, had the\r\nhonor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along\r\nthe whole coast of the Mediterranean, and so enjoyed exceptional\r\nprivileges. As to Franz, he had no longer any inducement to remain at\r\nMonte Cristo. He had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the\r\ngrotto; he consequently despatched his breakfast, and, his boat being\r\nready, he hastened on board, and they were soon under way. At the\r\nmoment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht, as it\r\ndisappeared in the gulf of Porto-Vecchio. With it was effaced the last\r\ntrace of the preceding night; and then supper, Sinbad, hashish,\r\nstatues,—all became a dream for Franz.\r\n\r\nThe boat sailed on all day and all night, and next morning, when the\r\nsun rose, they had lost sight of Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\nWhen Franz had once again set foot on shore, he forgot, for the moment\r\nat least, the events which had just passed, while he finished his\r\naffairs of pleasure at Florence, and then thought of nothing but how he\r\nshould rejoin his companion, who was awaiting him at Rome.\r\n\r\nHe set out, and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la Douane\r\nby the mail-coach. An apartment, as we have said, had been retained\r\nbeforehand, and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrini’s hotel. But\r\nthis was not so easy a matter, for the streets were thronged with\r\npeople, and Rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur\r\nwhich precedes all great events; and at Rome there are four great\r\nevents in every year,—the Carnival, Holy Week, Corpus Christi, and the\r\nFeast of St. Peter.\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy,\r\nbetween life and death, which renders it similar to a kind of station\r\nbetween this world and the next—a sublime spot, a resting-place full of\r\npoetry and character, and at which Franz had already halted five or six\r\ntimes, and at each time found it more marvellous and striking.\r\n\r\nAt last he made his way through the mob, which was continually\r\nincreasing and getting more and more turbulent, and reached the hotel.\r\nOn his first inquiry he was told, with the impertinence peculiar to\r\nhired hackney-coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full, that\r\nthere was no room for him at the Hôtel de Londres. Then he sent his\r\ncard to Signor Pastrini, and asked for Albert de Morcerf. This plan\r\nsucceeded; and Signor Pastrini himself ran to him, excusing himself for\r\nhaving made his excellency wait, scolding the waiters, taking the\r\ncandlestick from the porter, who was ready to pounce on the traveller\r\nand was about to lead him to Albert, when Morcerf himself appeared.\r\n\r\nThe apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor. The two rooms\r\nlooked on to the street—a fact which Signor Pastrini commented upon as\r\nan inappreciable advantage. The rest of the floor was hired by a very\r\nrich gentleman who was supposed to be a Sicilian or Maltese; but the\r\nhost was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\n“Very good, signor Pastrini,” said Franz; “but we must have some supper\r\ninstantly, and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days.”\r\n\r\n“As to supper,” replied the landlord, “you shall be served immediately;\r\nbut as for the carriage——”\r\n\r\n“What as to the carriage?” exclaimed Albert. “Come, come, Signor\r\nPastrini, no joking; we must have a carriage.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied the host, “we will do all in our power to procure you\r\none—this is all I can say.”\r\n\r\n“And when shall we know?” inquired Franz.\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow morning,” answered the innkeeper.\r\n\r\n“Oh, the deuce! then we shall pay the more, that’s all, I see plainly\r\nenough. At Drake’s or Aaron’s one pays twenty-five lire for common\r\ndays, and thirty or thirty-five lire a day more for Sundays and feast\r\ndays; add five lire a day more for extras, that will make forty, and\r\nthere’s an end of it.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a\r\ncarriage.”\r\n\r\n“Then they must put horses to mine. It is a little worse for the\r\njourney, but that’s no matter.”\r\n\r\n“There are no horses.”\r\n\r\nAlbert looked at Franz like a man who hears a reply he does not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n“Do you understand that, my dear Franz—no horses?” he said, “but can’t\r\nwe have post-horses?”\r\n\r\n“They have been all hired this fortnight, and there are none left but\r\nthose absolutely requisite for posting.”\r\n\r\n“What are we to say to this?” asked Franz.\r\n\r\n“I say, that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension, I am\r\naccustomed not to dwell on that thing, but to pass to another. Is\r\nsupper ready, Signor Pastrini?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your excellency.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, let us sup.”\r\n\r\n“But the carriage and horses?” said Franz.\r\n\r\n“Be easy, my dear boy; they will come in due season; it is only a\r\nquestion of how much shall be charged for them.” Morcerf then, with\r\nthat delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to\r\na full purse or well-lined pocketbook, supped, went to bed, slept\r\nsoundly, and dreamed he was racing all over Rome at Carnival time in a\r\ncoach with six horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 33. Roman Bandits\r\n\r\nThe next morning Franz woke first, and instantly rang the bell. The\r\nsound had not yet died away when Signor Pastrini himself entered.\r\n\r\n“Well, excellency,” said the landlord triumphantly, and without waiting\r\nfor Franz to question him, “I feared yesterday, when I would not\r\npromise you anything, that you were too late—there is not a single\r\ncarriage to be had—that is, for the three last days”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned Franz, “for the very three days it is most needed.”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” said Albert, entering; “no carriage to be had?”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” returned Franz, “you have guessed it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, your Eternal City is a nice sort of place.”\r\n\r\n“That is to say, excellency,” replied Pastrini, who was desirous of\r\nkeeping up the dignity of the capital of the Christian world in the\r\neyes of his guest, “that there are no carriages to be had from Sunday\r\nto Tuesday evening, but from now till Sunday you can have fifty if you\r\nplease.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that is something,” said Albert; “today is Thursday, and who knows\r\nwhat may arrive between this and Sunday?”\r\n\r\n“Ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive,” replied Franz, “which\r\nwill make it still more difficult.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Morcerf, “let us enjoy the present without gloomy\r\nforebodings for the future.”\r\n\r\n“At least we can have a window?”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“In the Corso.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, a window!” exclaimed Signor Pastrini,—“utterly impossible; there\r\nwas only one left on the fifth floor of the Doria Palace, and that has\r\nbeen let to a Russian prince for twenty sequins a day.”\r\n\r\nThe two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Franz to Albert, “do you know what is the best thing we\r\ncan do? It is to pass the Carnival at Venice; there we are sure of\r\nobtaining gondolas if we cannot have carriages.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, the devil, no,” cried Albert; “I came to Rome to see the Carnival,\r\nand I will, though I see it on stilts.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo! an excellent idea. We will disguise ourselves as monster\r\npulchinellos or shepherds of the Landes, and we shall have complete\r\nsuccess.”\r\n\r\n“Do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to Sunday\r\nmorning?”\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu!_” said Albert, “do you think we are going to run about on\r\nfoot in the streets of Rome, like lawyers’ clerks?”\r\n\r\n“I hasten to comply with your excellencies’ wishes; only, I tell you\r\nbeforehand, the carriage will cost you six piastres a day.”\r\n\r\n“And, as I am not a millionaire, like the gentleman in the next\r\napartments,” said Franz, “I warn you, that as I have been four times\r\nbefore at Rome, I know the prices of all the carriages; we will give\r\nyou twelve piastres for today, tomorrow, and the day after, and then\r\nyou will make a good profit.”\r\n\r\n“But, excellency”—said Pastrini, still striving to gain his point.\r\n\r\n“Now go,” returned Franz, “or I shall go myself and bargain with your\r\n_affettatore_, who is mine also; he is an old friend of mine, who has\r\nplundered me pretty well already, and, in the hope of making more out\r\nof me, he will take a less price than the one I offer you; you will\r\nlose the preference, and that will be your fault.”\r\n\r\n“Do not give yourselves the trouble, excellency,” returned Signor\r\nPastrini, with the smile peculiar to the Italian speculator when he\r\nconfesses defeat; “I will do all I can, and I hope you will be\r\nsatisfied.”\r\n\r\n“And now we understand each other.”\r\n\r\n“When do you wish the carriage to be here?”\r\n\r\n“In an hour.”\r\n\r\n“In an hour it will be at the door.”\r\n\r\nAn hour after the vehicle was at the door; it was a hack conveyance\r\nwhich was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the\r\noccasion, but, in spite of its humble exterior, the young men would\r\nhave thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three\r\ndays of the Carnival.\r\n\r\n“Excellency,” cried the _cicerone_, seeing Franz approach the window,\r\n“shall I bring the carriage nearer to the palace?”\r\n\r\nAccustomed as Franz was to the Italian phraseology, his first impulse\r\nwas to look round him, but these words were addressed to him. Franz was\r\nthe “excellency,” the vehicle was the “carriage,” and the Hôtel de\r\nLondres was the “palace.” The genius for laudation characteristic of\r\nthe race was in that phrase.\r\n\r\nFranz and Albert descended, the carriage approached the palace; their\r\nexcellencies stretched their legs along the seats; the _cicerone_\r\nsprang into the seat behind.\r\n\r\n“Where do your excellencies wish to go?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“To Saint Peter’s first, and then to the Colosseum,” returned Albert.\r\nBut Albert did not know that it takes a day to see Saint Peter’s, and a\r\nmonth to study it. The day was passed at Saint Peter’s alone.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the daylight began to fade away; Franz took out his watch—it\r\nwas half-past four. They returned to the hotel; at the door Franz\r\nordered the coachman to be ready at eight. He wished to show Albert the\r\nColosseum by moonlight, as he had shown him Saint Peter’s by daylight.\r\nWhen we show a friend a city one has already visited, we feel the same\r\npride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been.\r\n\r\nHe was to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo, skirt the outer wall,\r\nand re-enter by the Porta San Giovanni; thus they would behold the\r\nColosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on\r\nthe Capitol, the Forum, the Arch of Septimus Severus, the Temple of\r\nAntoninus and Faustina, and the Via Sacra.\r\n\r\nThey sat down to dinner. Signor Pastrini had promised them a banquet;\r\nhe gave them a tolerable repast. At the end of the dinner he entered in\r\nperson. Franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised, and\r\nbegan accordingly, but at the first words he was interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Excellency,” said Pastrini, “I am delighted to have your approbation,\r\nbut it was not for that I came.”\r\n\r\n“Did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage?” asked Albert,\r\nlighting his cigar.\r\n\r\n“No; and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any\r\nlonger; at Rome things can or cannot be done; when you are told\r\nanything cannot be done, there is an end of it.”\r\n\r\n“It is much more convenient at Paris,—when anything cannot be done, you\r\npay double, and it is done directly.”\r\n\r\n“That is what all the French say,” returned Signor Pastrini, somewhat\r\npiqued; “for that reason, I do not understand why they travel.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Albert, emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair\r\non its hind legs, “only madmen, or blockheads like us, ever do travel.\r\nMen in their senses do not quit their hotel in the Rue du Helder, their\r\nwalk on the Boulevard de Gand, and the Café de Paris.”\r\n\r\nIt is of course understood that Albert resided in the aforesaid street,\r\nappeared every day on the fashionable walk, and dined frequently at the\r\nonly restaurant where you can really dine, that is, if you are on good\r\nterms with its waiters.\r\n\r\nSignor Pastrini remained silent a short time; it was evident that he\r\nwas musing over this answer, which did not seem very clear.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Franz, in his turn interrupting his host’s meditations,\r\n“you had some motive for coming here, may I beg to know what it was?”\r\n\r\n20099m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes; you have ordered your carriage at eight o’clock precisely?”\r\n\r\n“I have.”\r\n\r\n“You intend visiting _Il Colosseo_.”\r\n\r\n“You mean the Colosseum?”\r\n\r\n“It is the same thing. You have told your coachman to leave the city by\r\nthe Porta del Popolo, to drive round the walls, and re-enter by the\r\nPorta San Giovanni?”\r\n\r\n“These are my words exactly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this route is impossible.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!”\r\n\r\n“Very dangerous, to say the least.”\r\n\r\n“Dangerous!—and why?”\r\n\r\n“On account of the famous Luigi Vampa.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, who may this famous Luigi Vampa be?” inquired Albert; “he may be\r\nvery famous at Rome, but I can assure you he is quite unknown at\r\nParis.”\r\n\r\n“What! do you not know him?”\r\n\r\n“I have not that honor.”\r\n\r\n“You have never heard his name?”\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, he is a bandit, compared to whom the Decesaris and the\r\nGasparones were mere children.”\r\n\r\n“Now then, Albert,” cried Franz, “here is a bandit for you at last.”\r\n\r\n“I forewarn you, Signor Pastrini, that I shall not believe one word of\r\nwhat you are going to tell us; having told you this, begin. ‘Once upon\r\na time——’ Well, go on.”\r\n\r\nSignor Pastrini turned toward Franz, who seemed to him the more\r\nreasonable of the two; we must do him justice,—he had had a great many\r\nFrenchmen in his house, but had never been able to comprehend them.\r\n\r\n“Excellency,” said he gravely, addressing Franz, “if you look upon me\r\nas a liar, it is useless for me to say anything; it was for your\r\ninterest I——”\r\n\r\n“Albert does not say you are a liar, Signor Pastrini,” said Franz, “but\r\nthat he will not believe what you are going to tell us,—but I will\r\nbelieve all you say; so proceed.”\r\n\r\n“But if your excellency doubt my veracity——”\r\n\r\n“Signor Pastrini,” returned Franz, “you are more susceptible than\r\nCassandra, who was a prophetess, and yet no one believed her; while\r\nyou, at least, are sure of the credence of half your audience. Come,\r\nsit down, and tell us all about this Signor Vampa.”\r\n\r\n“I had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had\r\nsince the days of Mastrilla.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what has this bandit to do with the order I have given the\r\ncoachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo, and to re-enter by\r\nthe Porta San Giovanni?”\r\n\r\n20101m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“This,” replied Signor Pastrini, “that you will go out by one, but I\r\nvery much doubt your returning by the other.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Franz.\r\n\r\n“Because, after nightfall, you are not safe fifty yards from the\r\ngates.”\r\n\r\n“On your honor, is that true?” cried Albert.\r\n\r\n“Count,” returned Signor Pastrini, hurt at Albert’s repeated doubts of\r\nthe truth of his assertions, “I do not say this to you, but to your\r\ncompanion, who knows Rome, and knows, too, that these things are not to\r\nbe laughed at.”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” said Albert, turning to Franz, “here is an admirable\r\nadventure; we will fill our carriage with pistols, blunderbusses, and\r\ndouble-barrelled guns. Luigi Vampa comes to take us, and we take him—we\r\nbring him back to Rome, and present him to his holiness the Pope, who\r\nasks how he can repay so great a service; then we merely ask for a\r\ncarriage and a pair of horses, and we see the Carnival in the carriage,\r\nand doubtless the Roman people will crown us at the Capitol, and\r\nproclaim us, like Curtius and Horatius Cocles, the preservers of their\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nWhilst Albert proposed this scheme, Signor Pastrini’s face assumed an\r\nexpression impossible to describe.\r\n\r\n“And pray,” asked Franz, “where are these pistols, blunderbusses, and\r\nother deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage?”\r\n\r\n“Not out of my armory, for at Terracina I was plundered even of my\r\nhunting-knife. And you?”\r\n\r\n“I shared the same fate at Aquapendente.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know, Signor Pastrini,” said Albert, lighting a second cigar at\r\nthe first, “that this practice is very convenient for bandits, and that\r\nit seems to be due to an arrangement of their own.”\r\n\r\nDoubtless Signor Pastrini found this pleasantry compromising, for he\r\nonly answered half the question, and then he spoke to Franz, as the\r\nonly one likely to listen with attention. “Your excellency knows that\r\nit is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Albert, whose courage revolted at the idea of being\r\nplundered tamely, “not make any resistance!”\r\n\r\n“No, for it would be useless. What could you do against a dozen bandits\r\nwho spring out of some pit, ruin, or aqueduct, and level their pieces\r\nat you?”\r\n\r\n“Eh, _parbleu!_—they should kill me.”\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say, “Your\r\nfriend is decidedly mad.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Albert,” returned Franz, “your answer is sublime, and worthy\r\nthe ‘_Let him die_,’ of Corneille, only, when Horace made that answer,\r\nthe safety of Rome was concerned; but, as for us, it is only to gratify\r\na whim, and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a\r\nmotive.”\r\n\r\nAlbert poured himself out a glass of _lacryma Christi_, which he sipped\r\nat intervals, muttering some unintelligible words.\r\n\r\n“Well, Signor Pastrini,” said Franz, “now that my companion is quieted,\r\nand you have seen how peaceful my intentions are, tell me who is this\r\nLuigi Vampa. Is he a shepherd or a nobleman?—young or old?—tall or\r\nshort? Describe him, in order that, if we meet him by chance, like Jean\r\nSbogar or Lara, we may recognize him.”\r\n\r\n“You could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these\r\npoints, for I knew him when he was a child, and one day that I fell\r\ninto his hands, going from Ferentino to Alatri, he, fortunately for me,\r\nrecollected me, and set me free, not only without ransom, but made me a\r\npresent of a very splendid watch, and related his history to me.”\r\n\r\n“Let us see the watch,” said Albert.\r\n\r\nSignor Pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent Bréguet, bearing the\r\nname of its maker, of Parisian manufacture, and a count’s coronet.\r\n\r\n“Here it is,” said he.\r\n\r\n“_Peste!_” returned Albert, “I compliment you on it; I have its\r\nfellow”—he took his watch from his waistcoat pocket—“and it cost me\r\n3,000 francs.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hear the history,” said Franz, motioning Signor Pastrini to\r\nseat himself.\r\n\r\n“Your excellencies permit it?” asked the host.\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_” cried Albert, “you are not a preacher, to remain\r\nstanding!”\r\n\r\nThe host sat down, after having made each of them a respectful bow,\r\nwhich meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know\r\nconcerning Luigi Vampa.\r\n\r\n“You tell me,” said Franz, at the moment Signor Pastrini was about to\r\nopen his mouth, “that you knew Luigi Vampa when he was a child—he is\r\nstill a young man, then?”\r\n\r\n“A young man? he is only two-and-twenty;—he will gain himself a\r\nreputation.”\r\n\r\n“What do you think of that, Albert?—at two-and-twenty to be thus\r\nfamous?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and at his age, Alexander, Cæsar, and Napoleon, who have all made\r\nsome noise in the world, were quite behind him.”\r\n\r\n“So,” continued Franz, “the hero of this history is only\r\ntwo-and-twenty?”\r\n\r\n“Scarcely so much.”\r\n\r\n“Is he tall or short?”\r\n\r\n“Of the middle height—about the same stature as his excellency,”\r\nreturned the host, pointing to Albert.\r\n\r\n“Thanks for the comparison,” said Albert, with a bow.\r\n\r\n“Go on, Signor Pastrini,” continued Franz, smiling at his friend’s\r\nsusceptibility. “To what class of society does he belong?”\r\n\r\n“He was a shepherd-boy attached to the farm of the Count of San-Felice,\r\nsituated between Palestrina and the Lake of Gabri; he was born at\r\nPampinara, and entered the count’s service when he was five years old;\r\nhis father was also a shepherd, who owned a small flock, and lived by\r\nthe wool and the milk, which he sold at Rome. When quite a child, the\r\nlittle Vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity. One day, when he\r\nwas seven years old, he came to the curate of Palestrina, and asked to\r\nbe taught to read; it was somewhat difficult, for he could not quit his\r\nflock; but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little\r\nhamlet too poor to pay a priest and which, having no other name, was\r\ncalled Borgo; he told Luigi that he might meet him on his return, and\r\nthat then he would give him a lesson, warning him that it would be\r\nshort, and that he must profit as much as possible by it. The child\r\naccepted joyfully. Every day Luigi led his flock to graze on the road\r\nthat leads from Palestrina to Borgo; every day, at nine o’clock in the\r\nmorning, the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside, and\r\nthe little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest’s breviary. At\r\nthe end of three months he had learned to read. This was not enough—he\r\nmust now learn to write. The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make\r\nthree alphabets—one large, one middling, and one small; and pointed out\r\nto him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the\r\nletters on a slate, and thus learn to write. The same evening, when the\r\nflock was safe at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at\r\nPalestrina, took a large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a\r\nsort of stylus. The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of\r\nslate and began. At the end of three months he had learned to write.\r\nThe curate, astonished at his quickness and intelligence, made him a\r\npresent of pens, paper, and a penknife. This demanded new effort, but\r\nnothing compared to the first; at the end of a week he wrote as well\r\nwith this pen as with the stylus. The curate related the incident to\r\nthe Count of San-Felice, who sent for the little shepherd, made him\r\nread and write before him, ordered his attendant to let him eat with\r\nthe domestics, and to give him two piastres a month. With this, Luigi\r\npurchased books and pencils. He applied his imitative powers to\r\neverything, and, like Giotto, when young, he drew on his slate sheep,\r\nhouses, and trees. Then, with his knife, he began to carve all sorts of\r\nobjects in wood; it was thus that Pinelli, the famous sculptor, had\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\n20105m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“A girl of six or seven—that is, a little younger than Vampa—tended\r\nsheep on a farm near Palestrina; she was an orphan, born at Valmontone\r\nand was named Teresa. The two children met, sat down near each other,\r\nlet their flocks mingle together, played, laughed, and conversed\r\ntogether; in the evening they separated the Count of San-Felice’s flock\r\nfrom those of Baron Cervetri, and the children returned to their\r\nrespective farms, promising to meet the next morning. The next day they\r\nkept their word, and thus they grew up together. Vampa was twelve, and\r\nTeresa eleven. And yet their natural disposition revealed itself.\r\nBeside his taste for the fine arts, which Luigi had carried as far as\r\nhe could in his solitude, he was given to alternating fits of sadness\r\nand enthusiasm, was often angry and capricious, and always sarcastic.\r\nNone of the lads of Pampinara, Palestrina, or Valmontone had been able\r\nto gain any influence over him or even to become his companion. His\r\ndisposition (always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make\r\nthem) kept him aloof from all friendships. Teresa alone ruled by a\r\nlook, a word, a gesture, this impetuous character, which yielded\r\nbeneath the hand of a woman, and which beneath the hand of a man might\r\nhave broken, but could never have been bended. Teresa was lively and\r\ngay, but coquettish to excess. The two piastres that Luigi received\r\nevery month from the Count of San-Felice’s steward, and the price of\r\nall the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome, were expended in\r\near-rings, necklaces, and gold hairpins. So that, thanks to her\r\nfriend’s generosity, Teresa was the most beautiful and the best-attired\r\npeasant near Rome.\r\n\r\n“The two children grew up together, passing all their time with each\r\nother, and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different\r\ncharacters. Thus, in all their dreams, their wishes, and their\r\nconversations, Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an\r\narmy, or governor of a province. Teresa saw herself rich, superbly\r\nattired, and attended by a train of liveried domestics. Then, when they\r\nhad thus passed the day in building castles in the air, they separated\r\ntheir flocks, and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the\r\nreality of their humble position.\r\n\r\n“One day the young shepherd told the count’s steward that he had seen a\r\nwolf come out of the Sabine mountains, and prowl around his flock. The\r\nsteward gave him a gun; this was what Vampa longed for. This gun had an\r\nexcellent barrel, made at Brescia, and carrying a ball with the\r\nprecision of an English rifle; but one day the count broke the stock,\r\nand had then cast the gun aside. This, however, was nothing to a\r\nsculptor like Vampa; he examined the broken stock, calculated what\r\nchange it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder, and made a\r\nfresh stock, so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen\r\nor twenty piastres, had he chosen to sell it. But nothing could be\r\nfarther from his thoughts.\r\n\r\n“For a long time a gun had been the young man’s greatest ambition. In\r\nevery country where independence has taken the place of liberty, the\r\nfirst desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon, which at once\r\nrenders him capable of defence or attack, and, by rendering its owner\r\nterrible, often makes him feared. From this moment Vampa devoted all\r\nhis leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious\r\nweapon; he purchased powder and ball, and everything served him for a\r\nmark—the trunk of some old and moss-grown olive-tree, that grew on the\r\nSabine mountains; the fox, as he quitted his earth on some marauding\r\nexcursion; the eagle that soared above their heads: and thus he soon\r\nbecame so expert, that Teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at\r\nthe report, and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever\r\nhe pleased, with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand.\r\n\r\n20107m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“One evening a wolf emerged from a pine-wood near which they were\r\nusually stationed, but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he\r\nwas dead. Proud of this exploit, Vampa took the dead animal on his\r\nshoulders, and carried him to the farm. These exploits had gained Luigi\r\nconsiderable reputation. The man of superior abilities always finds\r\nadmirers, go where he will. He was spoken of as the most adroit, the\r\nstrongest, and the most courageous _contadino_ for ten leagues around;\r\nand although Teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful\r\ngirl of the Sabines, no one had ever spoken to her of love, because it\r\nwas known that she was beloved by Vampa. And yet the two young people\r\nhad never declared their affection; they had grown together like two\r\ntrees whose roots are mingled, whose branches intertwined, and whose\r\nintermingled perfume rises to the heavens. Only their wish to see each\r\nother had become a necessity, and they would have preferred death to a\r\nday’s separation.\r\n\r\n“Teresa was sixteen, and Vampa seventeen. About this time, a band of\r\nbrigands that had established itself in the Lepini mountains began to\r\nbe much spoken of. The brigands have never been really extirpated from\r\nthe neighborhood of Rome. Sometimes a chief is wanted, but when a chief\r\npresents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers.\r\n\r\n“The celebrated Cucumetto, pursued in the Abruzzo, driven out of the\r\nkingdom of Naples, where he had carried on a regular war, had crossed\r\nthe Garigliano, like Manfred, and had taken refuge on the banks of the\r\nAmasine between Sonnino and Juperno. He strove to collect a band of\r\nfollowers, and followed the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasparone, whom\r\nhe hoped to surpass. Many young men of Palestrina, Frascati, and\r\nPampinara had disappeared. Their disappearance at first caused much\r\ndisquietude; but it was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto.\r\nAfter some time Cucumetto became the object of universal attention; the\r\nmost extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were\r\nrelated of him.\r\n\r\n“One day he carried off a young girl, the daughter of a surveyor of\r\nFrosinone. The bandit’s laws are positive; a young girl belongs first\r\nto him who carries her off, then the rest draw lots for her, and she is\r\nabandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings. When\r\ntheir parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom, a messenger is\r\nsent to negotiate; the prisoner is hostage for the security of the\r\nmessenger; should the ransom be refused, the prisoner is irrevocably\r\nlost. The young girl’s lover was in Cucumetto’s troop; his name was\r\nCarlini. When she recognized her lover, the poor girl extended her arms\r\nto him, and believed herself safe; but Carlini felt his heart sink, for\r\nhe but too well knew the fate that awaited her. However, as he was a\r\nfavorite with Cucumetto, as he had for three years faithfully served\r\nhim, and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about\r\nto cut him down, he hoped the chief would have pity on him. He took\r\nCucumetto one side, while the young girl, seated at the foot of a huge\r\npine that stood in the centre of the forest, made a veil of her\r\npicturesque head-dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the\r\nbandits. There he told the chief all—his affection for the prisoner,\r\ntheir promises of mutual fidelity, and how every night, since he had\r\nbeen near, they had met in some neighboring ruins.\r\n\r\n20109m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a\r\nvillage, so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting.\r\nCucumetto had been there, however, by accident, as he said, and had\r\ncarried the maiden off. Carlini besought his chief to make an exception\r\nin Rita’s favor, as her father was rich, and could pay a large ransom.\r\nCucumetto seemed to yield to his friend’s entreaties, and bade him find\r\na shepherd to send to Rita’s father at Frosinone.\r\n\r\n“Carlini flew joyfully to Rita, telling her she was saved, and bidding\r\nher write to her father, to inform him what had occurred, and that her\r\nransom was fixed at three hundred piastres. Twelve hours’ delay was all\r\nthat was granted—that is, until nine the next morning. The instant the\r\nletter was written, Carlini seized it, and hastened to the plain to\r\nfind a messenger. He found a young shepherd watching his flock. The\r\nnatural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between\r\nthe city and the mountains, between civilized and savage life. The boy\r\nundertook the commission, promising to be in Frosinone in less than an\r\nhour. Carlini returned, anxious to see his mistress, and announce the\r\njoyful intelligence. He found the troop in the glade, supping off the\r\nprovisions exacted as contributions from the peasants; but his eye\r\nvainly sought Rita and Cucumetto among them.\r\n\r\n“He inquired where they were, and was answered by a burst of laughter.\r\nA cold perspiration burst from every pore, and his hair stood on end.\r\nHe repeated his question. One of the bandits rose, and offered him a\r\nglass filled with Orvietto, saying, ‘To the health of the brave\r\nCucumetto and the fair Rita.’ At this moment Carlini heard a woman’s\r\ncry; he divined the truth, seized the glass, broke it across the face\r\nof him who presented it, and rushed towards the spot whence the cry\r\ncame. After a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket; he\r\nfound Rita senseless in the arms of Cucumetto. At the sight of Carlini,\r\nCucumetto rose, a pistol in each hand. The two brigands looked at each\r\nother for a moment—the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips,\r\nthe other with the pallor of death on his brow. A terrible battle\r\nbetween the two men seemed imminent; but by degrees Carlini’s features\r\nrelaxed, his hand, which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt,\r\nfell to his side. Rita lay between them. The moon lighted the group.\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ said Cucumetto, ‘have you executed your commission?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, captain,’ returned Carlini. ‘At nine o’clock tomorrow Rita’s\r\nfather will be here with the money.’\r\n\r\n“‘It is well; in the meantime, we will have a merry night; this young\r\ngirl is charming, and does credit to your taste. Now, as I am not\r\negotistical, we will return to our comrades and draw lots for her.’\r\n\r\n“‘You have determined, then, to abandon her to the common law?’ said\r\nCarlini.\r\n\r\n“‘Why should an exception be made in her favor?’\r\n\r\n“‘I thought that my entreaties——’\r\n\r\n“‘What right have you, any more than the rest, to ask for an\r\nexception?’\r\n\r\n“‘It is true.’\r\n\r\n“‘But never mind,’ continued Cucumetto, laughing, ‘sooner or later your\r\nturn will come.’ Carlini’s teeth clenched convulsively.\r\n\r\n“‘Now, then,’ said Cucumetto, advancing towards the other bandits, ‘are\r\nyou coming?’\r\n\r\n“‘I follow you.’\r\n\r\n20111m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Cucumetto departed, without losing sight of Carlini, for, doubtless,\r\nhe feared lest he should strike him unawares; but nothing betrayed a\r\nhostile design on Carlini’s part. He was standing, his arms folded,\r\nnear Rita, who was still insensible. Cucumetto fancied for a moment the\r\nyoung man was about to take her in his arms and fly; but this mattered\r\nlittle to him now Rita had been his; and as for the money, three\r\nhundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he\r\ncared little about it. He continued to follow the path to the glade;\r\nbut, to his great surprise, Carlini arrived almost as soon as himself.\r\n\r\n“‘Let us draw lots! let us draw lots!’ cried all the brigands, when\r\nthey saw the chief.\r\n\r\n“Their demand was fair, and the chief inclined his head in sign of\r\nacquiescence. The eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand,\r\nand the red light of the fire made them look like demons. The names of\r\nall, including Carlini, were placed in a hat, and the youngest of the\r\nband drew forth a ticket; the ticket bore the name of Diavolaccio. He\r\nwas the man who had proposed to Carlini the health of their chief, and\r\nto whom Carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face. A large\r\nwound, extending from the temple to the mouth, was bleeding profusely.\r\nDiavolaccio, seeing himself thus favored by fortune, burst into a loud\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n“‘Captain,’ said he, ‘just now Carlini would not drink your health when\r\nI proposed it to him; propose mine to him, and let us see if he will be\r\nmore condescending to you than to me.’\r\n\r\n“Everyone expected an explosion on Carlini’s part; but to their great\r\nsurprise, he took a glass in one hand and a flask in the other, and\r\nfilling it,—\r\n\r\n“‘Your health, Diavolaccio,’ said he calmly, and he drank it off,\r\nwithout his hand trembling in the least. Then sitting down by the fire,\r\n‘My supper,’ said he; ‘my expedition has given me an appetite.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well done, Carlini!’ cried the brigands; ‘that is acting like a good\r\nfellow;’ and they all formed a circle round the fire, while Diavolaccio\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n“Carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened. The bandits looked\r\non with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard\r\nfootsteps. They turned round, and saw Diavolaccio bearing the young\r\ngirl in his arms. Her head hung back, and her long hair swept the\r\nground. As they entered the circle, the bandits could perceive, by the\r\nfirelight, the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of Diavolaccio.\r\nThis apparition was so strange and so solemn, that everyone rose, with\r\nthe exception of Carlini, who remained seated, and ate and drank\r\ncalmly. Diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence, and laid\r\nRita at the captain’s feet. Then everyone could understand the cause of\r\nthe unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit. A knife was\r\nplunged up to the hilt in Rita’s left breast. Everyone looked at\r\nCarlini; the sheath at his belt was empty.\r\n\r\n“‘Ah, ah,’ said the chief, ‘I now understand why Carlini stayed\r\nbehind.’\r\n\r\n“All savage natures appreciate a desperate deed. No other of the\r\nbandits would, perhaps, have done the same; but they all understood\r\nwhat Carlini had done.\r\n\r\n“‘Now, then,’ cried Carlini, rising in his turn, and approaching the\r\ncorpse, his hand on the butt of one of his pistols, ‘does anyone\r\ndispute the possession of this woman with me?’\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ returned the chief, ‘she is thine.’\r\n\r\n“Carlini raised her in his arms, and carried her out of the circle of\r\nfirelight. Cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night, and the\r\nbandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks, and lay down before the\r\nfire. At midnight the sentinel gave the alarm, and in an instant all\r\nwere on the alert. It was Rita’s father, who brought his daughter’s\r\nransom in person.\r\n\r\n“‘Here,’ said he, to Cucumetto, ‘here are three hundred piastres; give\r\nme back my child.\r\n\r\n“But the chief, without taking the money, made a sign to him to follow.\r\nThe old man obeyed. They both advanced beneath the trees, through whose\r\nbranches streamed the moonlight. Cucumetto stopped at last, and pointed\r\nto two persons grouped at the foot of a tree.\r\n\r\n“‘There,’ said he, ‘demand thy child of Carlini; he will tell thee what\r\nhas become of her;’ and he returned to his companions.\r\n\r\n“The old man remained motionless; he felt that some great and\r\nunforeseen misfortune hung over his head. At length he advanced toward\r\nthe group, the meaning of which he could not comprehend. As he\r\napproached, Carlini raised his head, and the forms of two persons\r\nbecame visible to the old man’s eyes. A woman lay on the ground, her\r\nhead resting on the knees of a man, who was seated by her; as he raised\r\nhis head, the woman’s face became visible. The old man recognized his\r\nchild, and Carlini recognized the old man.\r\n\r\n“‘I expected thee,’ said the bandit to Rita’s father.\r\n\r\n“‘Wretch!’ returned the old man, ‘what hast thou done?’ and he gazed\r\nwith terror on Rita, pale and bloody, a knife buried in her bosom. A\r\nray of moonlight poured through the trees, and lighted up the face of\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\n“‘Cucumetto had violated thy daughter,’ said the bandit; ‘I loved her,\r\ntherefore I slew her; for she would have served as the sport of the\r\nwhole band.’ The old man spoke not, and grew pale as death. ‘Now,’\r\ncontinued Carlini, ‘if I have done wrongly, avenge her;’ and\r\nwithdrawing the knife from the wound in Rita’s bosom, he held it out to\r\nthe old man with one hand, while with the other he tore open his vest.\r\n\r\n“‘Thou hast done well!’ returned the old man in a hoarse voice;\r\n‘embrace me, my son.’\r\n\r\n20115m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarlini threw himself, sobbing like a child, into the arms of his\r\nmistress’s father. These were the first tears the man of blood had ever\r\nwept.\r\n\r\n“‘Now,’ said the old man, ‘aid me to bury my child.’ Carlini fetched\r\ntwo pickaxes; and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of\r\na huge oak, beneath which the young girl was to repose. When the grave\r\nwas formed, the father embraced her first, and then the lover;\r\nafterwards, one taking the head, the other the feet, they placed her in\r\nthe grave. Then they knelt on each side of the grave, and said the\r\nprayers of the dead. Then, when they had finished, they cast the earth\r\nover the corpse, until the grave was filled. Then, extending his hand,\r\nthe old man said; ‘I thank you, my son; and now leave me alone.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yet——’ replied Carlini.\r\n\r\n“‘Leave me, I command you.’\r\n\r\n“Carlini obeyed, rejoined his comrades, folded himself in his cloak,\r\nand soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest. It had been resolved\r\nthe night before to change their encampment. An hour before daybreak,\r\nCucumetto aroused his men, and gave the word to march. But Carlini\r\nwould not quit the forest, without knowing what had become of Rita’s\r\nfather. He went toward the place where he had left him. He found the\r\nold man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his\r\ndaughter’s grave. He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the\r\ndead body of the one and the tomb of the other. But he was unable to\r\ncomplete this oath, for two days afterwards, in an encounter with the\r\nRoman carbineers, Carlini was killed. There was some surprise, however,\r\nthat, as he was with his face to the enemy, he should have received a\r\nball between his shoulders. That astonishment ceased when one of the\r\nbrigands remarked to his comrades that Cucumetto was stationed ten\r\npaces in Carlini’s rear when he fell. On the morning of the departure\r\nfrom the forest of Frosinone he had followed Carlini in the darkness,\r\nand heard this oath of vengeance, and, like a wise man, anticipated it.\r\n\r\n“They told ten other stories of this bandit chief, each more singular\r\nthan the other. Thus, from Fondi to Perusia, everyone trembles at the\r\nname of Cucumetto.\r\n\r\n“These narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between\r\nLuigi and Teresa. The young girl trembled very much at hearing the\r\nstories; but Vampa reassured her with a smile, tapping the butt of his\r\ngood fowling-piece, which threw its ball so well; and if that did not\r\nrestore her courage, he pointed to a crow, perched on some dead branch,\r\ntook aim, touched the trigger, and the bird fell dead at the foot of\r\nthe tree. Time passed on, and the two young people had agreed to be\r\nmarried when Vampa should be twenty and Teresa nineteen years of age.\r\nThey were both orphans, and had only their employers’ leave to ask,\r\nwhich had been already sought and obtained. One day when they were\r\ntalking over their plans for the future, they heard two or three\r\nreports of firearms, and then suddenly a man came out of the wood, near\r\nwhich the two young persons used to graze their flocks, and hurried\r\ntowards them. When he came within hearing, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n‘I am pursued; can you conceal me?’\r\n\r\n“They knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit; but there is\r\nan innate sympathy between the Roman brigand and the Roman peasant and\r\nthe latter is always ready to aid the former. Vampa, without saying a\r\nword, hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their\r\ngrotto, drew it away, made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there,\r\nin a retreat unknown to everyone, closed the stone upon him, and then\r\nwent and resumed his seat by Teresa. Instantly afterwards four\r\ncarbineers, on horseback, appeared on the edge of the wood; three of\r\nthem appeared to be looking for the fugitive, while the fourth dragged\r\na brigand prisoner by the neck. The three carbineers looked about\r\ncarefully on every side, saw the young peasants, and galloping up,\r\nbegan to question them. They had seen no one.\r\n\r\n“‘That is very annoying,’ said the brigadier; for the man we are\r\nlooking for is the chief.’\r\n\r\n“‘Cucumetto?’ cried Luigi and Teresa at the same moment.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ replied the brigadier; ‘and as his head is valued at a thousand\r\nRoman crowns, there would have been five hundred for you, if you had\r\nhelped us to catch him.’ The two young persons exchanged looks. The\r\nbrigadier had a moment’s hope. Five hundred Roman crowns are three\r\nthousand lire, and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor\r\norphans who are going to be married.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, it is very annoying,’ said Vampa; ‘but we have not seen him.’\r\n\r\n“Then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions, but\r\nin vain; then, after a time, they disappeared. Vampa then removed the\r\nstone, and Cucumetto came out. Through the crevices in the granite he\r\nhad seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers, and\r\nguessed the subject of their parley. He had read in the countenances of\r\nLuigi and Teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him, and\r\nhe drew from his pocket a purse full of gold, which he offered to them.\r\nBut Vampa raised his head proudly; as to Teresa, her eyes sparkled when\r\nshe thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with\r\nthis purse of gold.\r\n\r\n“Cucumetto was a cunning fiend, and had assumed the form of a brigand\r\ninstead of a serpent, and this look from Teresa showed to him that she\r\nwas a worthy daughter of Eve, and he returned to the forest, pausing\r\nseveral times on his way, under the pretext of saluting his protectors.\r\n\r\n“Several days elapsed, and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumetto. The\r\ntime of the Carnival was at hand. The Count of San-Felice announced a\r\ngrand masked ball, to which all that were distinguished in Rome were\r\ninvited. Teresa had a great desire to see this ball. Luigi asked\r\npermission of his protector, the steward, that she and he might be\r\npresent amongst the servants of the house. This was granted. The ball\r\nwas given by the Count for the particular pleasure of his daughter\r\nCarmela, whom he adored. Carmela was precisely the age and figure of\r\nTeresa, and Teresa was as handsome as Carmela. On the evening of the\r\nball Teresa was attired in her best, her most brilliant ornaments in\r\nher hair, and gayest glass beads,—she was in the costume of the women\r\nof Frascati. Luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the Roman peasant\r\nat holiday time. They both mingled, as they had leave to do, with the\r\nservants and peasants.\r\n\r\n“The _festa_ was magnificent; not only was the villa brilliantly\r\nilluminated, but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the\r\ntrees in the garden; and very soon the palace overflowed to the\r\nterraces, and the terraces to the garden-walks. At each cross-path was\r\nan orchestra, and tables spread with refreshments; the guests stopped,\r\nformed quadrilles, and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased.\r\nCarmela was attired like a woman of Sonnino. Her cap was embroidered\r\nwith pearls, the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds, her girdle\r\nwas of Turkey silk, with large embroidered flowers, her bodice and\r\nskirt were of cashmere, her apron of Indian muslin, and the buttons of\r\nher corset were of jewels. Two of her companions were dressed, the one\r\nas a woman of Nettuno, and the other as a woman of La Riccia. Four\r\nyoung men of the richest and noblest families of Rome accompanied them\r\nwith that Italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other\r\ncountry in the world. They were attired as peasants of Albano,\r\nVelletri, Civita-Castellana, and Sora. We need hardly add that these\r\npeasant costumes, like those of the young women, were brilliant with\r\ngold and jewels.\r\n\r\n“Carmela wished to form a quadrille, but there was one lady wanting.\r\nCarmela looked all around her, but not one of the guests had a costume\r\nsimilar to her own, or those of her companions. The Count of San-Felice\r\npointed out Teresa, who was hanging on Luigi’s arm in a group of\r\npeasants.\r\n\r\n“‘Will you allow me, father?’ said Carmela.\r\n\r\n“‘Certainly,’ replied the count, ‘are we not in Carnival time?’\r\n\r\n“Carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her, and\r\nsaying a few words to him, pointed with her finger to Teresa. The young\r\nman looked, bowed in obedience, and then went to Teresa, and invited\r\nher to dance in a quadrille directed by the count’s daughter. Teresa\r\nfelt a flush pass over her face; she looked at Luigi, who could not\r\nrefuse his assent. Luigi slowly relinquished Teresa’s arm, which he had\r\nheld beneath his own, and Teresa, accompanied by her elegant cavalier,\r\ntook her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic\r\nquadrille. Certainly, in the eyes of an artist, the exact and strict\r\ncostume of Teresa had a very different character from that of Carmela\r\nand her companions; and Teresa was frivolous and coquettish, and thus\r\nthe embroidery and muslins, the cashmere waist-girdles, all dazzled\r\nher, and the reflection of sapphires and diamonds almost turned her\r\ngiddy brain.\r\n\r\n“Luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind. It was\r\nlike an acute pain which gnawed at his heart, and then thrilled through\r\nhis whole body. He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and\r\nher cavalier; when their hands touched, he felt as though he should\r\nswoon; every pulse beat with violence, and it seemed as though a bell\r\nwere ringing in his ears. When they spoke, although Teresa listened\r\ntimidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier, as\r\nLuigi could read in the ardent looks of the good-looking young man that\r\nhis language was that of praise, it seemed as if the whole world was\r\nturning round with him, and all the voices of hell were whispering in\r\nhis ears ideas of murder and assassination. Then fearing that his\r\nparoxysm might get the better of him, he clutched with one hand the\r\nbranch of a tree against which he was leaning, and with the other\r\nconvulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his\r\nbelt, and which, unwittingly, he drew from the scabbard from time to\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“Luigi was jealous!\r\n\r\n“He felt that, influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition,\r\nTeresa might escape him.\r\n\r\n“The young peasant girl, at first timid and scared, soon recovered\r\nherself. We have said that Teresa was handsome, but this is not all;\r\nTeresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more\r\npotent than our affected and studied elegancies. She had almost all the\r\nhonors of the quadrille, and if she were envious of the Count of\r\nSan-Felice’s daughter, we will not undertake to say that Carmela was\r\nnot jealous of her. And with overpowering compliments her handsome\r\ncavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her, and where\r\nLuigi awaited her. Twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had\r\nglanced at Luigi, and each time she saw that he was pale and that his\r\nfeatures were agitated, once even the blade of his knife, half drawn\r\nfrom its sheath, had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare. Thus, it\r\nwas almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover’s arm. The quadrille\r\nhad been most perfect, and it was evident there was a great demand for\r\na repetition, Carmela alone objecting to it, but the Count of\r\nSan-Felice besought his daughter so earnestly, that she acceded.\r\n\r\n“One of the cavaliers then hastened to invite Teresa, without whom it\r\nwas impossible for the quadrille to be formed, but the young girl had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n“The truth was, that Luigi had not felt the strength to support another\r\nsuch trial, and, half by persuasion and half by force, he had removed\r\nTeresa toward another part of the garden. Teresa had yielded in spite\r\nof herself, but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the\r\nyoung man, she understood by his silence and trembling voice that\r\nsomething strange was passing within him. She herself was not exempt\r\nfrom internal emotion, and without having done anything wrong, yet\r\nfully comprehended that Luigi was right in reproaching her. Why, she\r\ndid not know, but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches\r\nwere merited.\r\n\r\n“However, to Teresa’s great astonishment, Luigi remained mute, and not\r\na word escaped his lips the rest of the evening. When the chill of the\r\nnight had driven away the guests from the gardens, and the gates of the\r\nvilla were closed on them for the _festa_ in-doors, he took Teresa\r\nquite away, and as he left her at her home, he said:\r\n\r\n“‘Teresa, what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young\r\nCountess of San-Felice?’\r\n\r\n“‘I thought,’ replied the young girl, with all the frankness of her\r\nnature, ‘that I would give half my life for a costume such as she\r\nwore.’\r\n\r\n“‘And what said your cavalier to you?’\r\n\r\n“‘He said it only depended on myself to have it, and I had only one\r\nword to say.’\r\n\r\n“‘He was right,’ said Luigi. ‘Do you desire it as ardently as you say?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, then, you shall have it!’\r\n\r\n“The young girl, much astonished, raised her head to look at him, but\r\nhis face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips.\r\nAs Luigi spoke thus, he left her. Teresa followed him with her eyes\r\ninto the darkness as long as she could, and when he had quite\r\ndisappeared, she went into the house with a sigh.\r\n\r\n20121m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“That night a memorable event occurred, due, no doubt, to the\r\nimprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights.\r\nThe Villa of San-Felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very\r\napartment of the lovely Carmela. Awakened in the night by the light of\r\nthe flames, she sprang out of bed, wrapped herself in a dressing-gown,\r\nand attempted to escape by the door, but the corridor by which she\r\nhoped to fly was already a prey to the flames. She then returned to her\r\nroom, calling for help as loudly as she could, when suddenly her\r\nwindow, which was twenty feet from the ground, was opened, a young\r\npeasant jumped into the chamber, seized her in his arms, and with\r\nsuperhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the\r\ngrass-plot, where she fainted. When she recovered, her father was by\r\nher side. All the servants surrounded her, offering her assistance. An\r\nentire wing of the villa was burnt down; but what of that, as long as\r\nCarmela was safe and uninjured?\r\n\r\n“Her preserver was everywhere sought for, but he did not appear; he was\r\ninquired after, but no one had seen him. Carmela was greatly troubled\r\nthat she had not recognized him.\r\n\r\n“As the count was immensely rich, excepting the danger Carmela had\r\nrun,—and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped, made that\r\nappear to him rather a favor of Providence than a real misfortune,—the\r\nloss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle.\r\n\r\n“The next day, at the usual hour, the two young peasants were on the\r\nborders of the forest. Luigi arrived first. He came toward Teresa in\r\nhigh spirits, and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the\r\nprevious evening. The young girl was very pensive, but seeing Luigi so\r\ncheerful, she on her part assumed a smiling air, which was natural to\r\nher when she was not excited or in a passion.\r\n\r\n“Luigi took her arm beneath his own, and led her to the door of the\r\ngrotto. Then he paused. The young girl, perceiving that there was\r\nsomething extraordinary, looked at him steadfastly.\r\n\r\n“‘Teresa,’ said Luigi, ‘yesterday evening you told me you would give\r\nall the world to have a costume similar to that of the count’s\r\ndaughter.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ replied Teresa with astonishment; ‘but I was mad to utter such\r\na wish.’\r\n\r\n“‘And I replied, “Very well, you shall have it.”’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ replied the young girl, whose astonishment increased at every\r\nword uttered by Luigi, ‘but of course your reply was only to please\r\nme.’\r\n\r\n“‘I have promised no more than I have given you, Teresa,’ said Luigi\r\nproudly. ‘Go into the grotto and dress yourself.’\r\n\r\n“At these words he drew away the stone, and showed Teresa the grotto,\r\nlighted up by two wax lights, which burnt on each side of a splendid\r\nmirror; on a rustic table, made by Luigi, were spread out the pearl\r\nnecklace and the diamond pins, and on a chair at the side was laid the\r\nrest of the costume.\r\n\r\n“Teresa uttered a cry of joy, and, without inquiring whence this attire\r\ncame, or even thanking Luigi, darted into the grotto, transformed into\r\na dressing-room.\r\n\r\n“Luigi pushed the stone behind her, for on the crest of a small\r\nadjacent hill which cut off the view toward Palestrina, he saw a\r\ntraveller on horseback, stopping a moment, as if uncertain of his road,\r\nand thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is\r\npeculiar to distant objects in southern climes. When he saw Luigi, he\r\nput his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him.\r\n\r\n“Luigi was not mistaken. The traveller, who was going from Palestrina\r\nto Tivoli, had mistaken his way; the young man directed him; but as at\r\na distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three\r\nways, and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his\r\nroute, he begged Luigi to be his guide.\r\n\r\n“Luigi threw his cloak on the ground, placed his carbine on his\r\nshoulder, and freed from his heavy covering, preceded the traveller\r\nwith the rapid step of a mountaineer, which a horse can scarcely keep\r\nup with. In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the\r\ncross-roads. On arriving there, with an air as majestic as that of an\r\nemperor, he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the\r\ntraveller was to follow.\r\n\r\n“‘That is your road, excellency, and now you cannot again mistake.’\r\n\r\n“‘And here is your recompense,’ said the traveller, offering the young\r\nherdsman some small pieces of money.\r\n\r\n“‘Thank you,’ said Luigi, drawing back his hand; ‘I render a service, I\r\ndo not sell it.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ replied the traveller, who seemed used to this difference\r\nbetween the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the\r\nmountaineer, ‘if you refuse wages, you will, perhaps, accept a gift.’\r\n\r\n“‘Ah, yes, that is another thing.’\r\n\r\n“‘Then,’ said the traveller, ‘take these two Venetian sequins and give\r\nthem to your bride, to make herself a pair of earrings.’\r\n\r\n“‘And then do you take this poniard,’ said the young herdsman; ‘you\r\nwill not find one better carved between Albano and Civita-Castellana.’\r\n\r\n“‘I accept it,’ answered the traveller, ‘but then the obligation will\r\nbe on my side, for this poniard is worth more than two sequins.’\r\n\r\n“‘For a dealer perhaps; but for me, who engraved it myself, it is\r\nhardly worth a piastre.’\r\n\r\n“‘What is your name?’ inquired the traveller.\r\n\r\n“‘Luigi Vampa,’ replied the shepherd, with the same air as he would\r\nhave replied, Alexander, King of Macedon. ‘And yours?’\r\n\r\n“‘I,’ said the traveller, ‘am called Sinbad the Sailor.’”\r\n\r\nFranz d’Épinay started with surprise.\r\n\r\n“Sinbad the Sailor?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the narrator; “that was the name which the traveller\r\ngave to Vampa as his own.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and what may you have to say against this name?” inquired\r\nAlbert; “it is a very pretty name, and the adventures of the gentleman\r\nof that name amused me very much in my youth, I must confess.”\r\n\r\nFranz said no more. The name of Sinbad the Sailor, as may well be\r\nsupposed, awakened in him a world of recollections, as had the name of\r\nthe Count of Monte Cristo on the previous evening.\r\n\r\n“Proceed!” said he to the host.\r\n\r\n“Vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket, and slowly\r\nreturned by the way he had gone. As he came within two or three hundred\r\npaces of the grotto, he thought he heard a cry. He listened to know\r\nwhence this sound could proceed. A moment afterwards he thought he\r\nheard his own name pronounced distinctly.\r\n\r\n“The cry proceeded from the grotto. He bounded like a chamois, cocking\r\nhis carbine as he went, and in a moment reached the summit of a hill\r\nopposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller. Three cries\r\nfor help came more distinctly to his ear. He cast his eyes around him\r\nand saw a man carrying off Teresa, as Nessus, the centaur, carried\r\nDeianira.\r\n\r\n“This man, who was hastening towards the wood, was already\r\nthree-quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest.\r\nVampa measured the distance; the man was at least two hundred paces in\r\nadvance of him, and there was not a chance of overtaking him. The young\r\nshepherd stopped, as if his feet had been rooted to the ground; then he\r\nput the butt of his carbine to his shoulder, took aim at the ravisher,\r\nfollowed him for a second in his track, and then fired.\r\n\r\n“The ravisher stopped suddenly, his knees bent under him, and he fell\r\nwith Teresa in his arms. The young girl rose instantly, but the man lay\r\non the earth struggling in the agonies of death. Vampa then rushed\r\ntowards Teresa; for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed\r\nher, and she had dropped on her knees, so that the young man feared\r\nthat the ball that had brought down his enemy, had also wounded his\r\nbetrothed.\r\n\r\n“Fortunately, she was unscathed, and it was fright alone that had\r\novercome Teresa. When Luigi had assured himself that she was safe and\r\nunharmed, he turned towards the wounded man. He had just expired, with\r\nclenched hands, his mouth in a spasm of agony, and his hair on end in\r\nthe sweat of death. His eyes remained open and menacing. Vampa\r\napproached the corpse, and recognized Cucumetto.\r\n\r\n“From the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young\r\npeasants, he had been enamoured of Teresa, and had sworn she should be\r\nhis. From that time he had watched them, and profiting by the moment\r\nwhen her lover had left her alone, had carried her off, and believed he\r\nat length had her in his power, when the ball, directed by the unerring\r\nskill of the young herdsman, had pierced his heart. Vampa gazed on him\r\nfor a moment without betraying the slightest emotion; while, on the\r\ncontrary, Teresa, shuddering in every limb, dared not approach the\r\nslain ruffian but by degrees, and threw a hesitating glance at the dead\r\nbody over the shoulder of her lover. Suddenly Vampa turned toward his\r\nmistress:\r\n\r\n“‘Ah,’ said he—‘good, good! You are dressed; it is now my turn to dress\r\nmyself.’\r\n\r\n20125m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the Count of\r\nSan-Felice’s daughter. Vampa took Cucumetto’s body in his arms and\r\nconveyed it to the grotto, while in her turn Teresa remained outside.\r\nIf a second traveller had passed, he would have seen a strange thing,—a\r\nshepherdess watching her flock, clad in a cashmere grown, with\r\near-rings and necklace of pearls, diamond pins, and buttons of\r\nsapphires, emeralds, and rubies. He would, no doubt, have believed that\r\nhe had returned to the times of Florian, and would have declared, on\r\nreaching Paris, that he had met an Alpine shepherdess seated at the\r\nfoot of the Sabine Hill.\r\n\r\n“At the end of a quarter of an hour Vampa quitted the grotto; his\r\ncostume was no less elegant than that of Teresa. He wore a vest of\r\ngarnet-colored velvet, with buttons of cut gold; a silk waistcoat\r\ncovered with embroidery; a Roman scarf tied round his neck; a\r\ncartridge-box worked with gold, and red and green silk; sky-blue velvet\r\nbreeches, fastened above the knee with diamond buckles; garters of\r\ndeerskin, worked with a thousand arabesques, and a hat whereon hung\r\nribbons of all colors; two watches hung from his girdle, and a splendid\r\nponiard was in his belt.\r\n\r\n“Teresa uttered a cry of admiration. Vampa in this attire resembled a\r\npainting by Léopold Robert or Schnetz. He had assumed the entire\r\ncostume of Cucumetto. The young man saw the effect produced on his\r\nbetrothed, and a smile of pride passed over his lips.\r\n\r\n“‘Now,’ he said to Teresa, ‘are you ready to share my fortune, whatever\r\nit may be?’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, yes!’ exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n“‘And follow me wherever I go?’\r\n\r\n“‘To the world’s end.’\r\n\r\n“‘Then take my arm, and let us on; we have no time to lose.’\r\n\r\n“The young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was\r\nconducting her, for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome,\r\nproud, and powerful as a god. They went towards the forest, and soon\r\nentered it.\r\n\r\n“We need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to\r\nVampa; he therefore went forward without a moment’s hesitation,\r\nalthough there was no beaten track, but he knew his path by looking at\r\nthe trees and bushes, and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an\r\nhour and a half. At the end of this time they had reached the thickest\r\npart of the forest. A torrent, whose bed was dry, led into a deep\r\ngorge. Vampa took this wild road, which, enclosed between two ridges,\r\nand shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines, seemed, but for the\r\ndifficulties of its descent, that path to Avernus of which Virgil\r\nspeaks. Teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the\r\nplain around her, and pressed closely against her guide, not uttering a\r\nsyllable; but as she saw him advance with even step and composed\r\ncountenance, she endeavored to repress her emotion.\r\n\r\n“Suddenly, about ten paces from them, a man advanced from behind a tree\r\nand aimed at Vampa.\r\n\r\n“‘Not another step,’ he said, ‘or you are a dead man.’\r\n\r\n“‘What, then,’ said Vampa, raising his hand with a gesture of disdain,\r\nwhile Teresa, no longer able to restrain her alarm, clung closely to\r\nhim, ‘do wolves rend each other?’\r\n\r\n“‘Who are you?’ inquired the sentinel.\r\n\r\n“‘I am Luigi Vampa, shepherd of the San-Felice farm.’\r\n\r\n“‘What do you want?’\r\n\r\n“‘I would speak with your companions who are in the glade at Rocca\r\nBianca.’\r\n\r\n“‘Follow me, then,’ said the sentinel; ‘or, as you know your way, go\r\nfirst.’\r\n\r\n“Vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the\r\nbandit, went before Teresa, and continued to advance with the same firm\r\nand easy step as before. At the end of ten minutes the bandit made them\r\na sign to stop. The two young persons obeyed. Then the bandit thrice\r\nimitated the cry of a crow; a croak answered this signal.\r\n\r\n“‘Good!’ said the sentry, ‘you may now go on.’\r\n\r\n“Luigi and Teresa again set forward; as they went on Teresa clung\r\ntremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of\r\ncarbines through the trees. The retreat of Rocca Bianca was at the top\r\nof a small mountain, which no doubt in former days had been a\r\nvolcano—an extinct volcano before the days when Remus and Romulus had\r\ndeserted Alba to come and found the city of Rome.\r\n\r\n“Teresa and Luigi reached the summit, and all at once found themselves\r\nin the presence of twenty bandits.\r\n\r\n“‘Here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you,’ said the\r\nsentinel.\r\n\r\n“‘What has he to say?’ inquired the young man who was in command in the\r\nchief’s absence.\r\n\r\n“‘I wish to say that I am tired of a shepherd’s life,’ was Vampa’s\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n“‘Ah, I understand,’ said the lieutenant; ‘and you seek admittance into\r\nour ranks?’\r\n\r\n“‘Welcome!’ cried several bandits from Ferrusino, Pampinara, and\r\nAnagni, who had recognized Luigi Vampa.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, but I came to ask something more than to be your companion.’\r\n\r\n“‘And what may that be?’ inquired the bandits with astonishment.\r\n\r\n“‘I come to ask to be your captain,’ said the young man.\r\n\r\n“The bandits shouted with laughter.\r\n\r\n“‘And what have you done to aspire to this honor?’ demanded the\r\nlieutenant.\r\n\r\n“‘I have killed your chief, Cucumetto, whose dress I now wear; and I\r\nset fire to the villa San-Felice to procure a wedding-dress for my\r\nbetrothed.’\r\n\r\n“An hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain, vice Cucumetto,\r\ndeceased.”\r\n\r\n20129m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear Albert,” said Franz, turning towards his friend; “what\r\nthink you of citizen Luigi Vampa?”\r\n\r\n“I say he is a myth,” replied Albert, “and never had an existence.”\r\n\r\n“And what may a myth be?” inquired Pastrini.\r\n\r\n“The explanation would be too long, my dear landlord,” replied Franz.\r\n\r\n“And you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this moment\r\nin the environs of Rome?”\r\n\r\n“And with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an\r\nexample.”\r\n\r\n“Then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you see, he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the\r\nplains, the fishermen of the Tiber, and the smugglers of the coast.\r\nThey seek for him in the mountains, and he is on the waters; they\r\nfollow him on the waters, and he is on the open sea; then they pursue\r\nhim, and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands, at Giglio,\r\nGiannutri, or Monte Cristo; and when they hunt for him there, he\r\nreappears suddenly at Albano, Tivoli, or La Riccia.”\r\n\r\n“And how does he behave towards travellers?”\r\n\r\n“Alas! his plan is very simple. It depends on the distance he may be\r\nfrom the city, whether he gives eight hours, twelve hours, or a day\r\nwherein to pay their ransom; and when that time has elapsed he allows\r\nanother hour’s grace. At the sixtieth minute of this hour, if the money\r\nis not forthcoming, he blows out the prisoner’s brains with a\r\npistol-shot, or plants his dagger in his heart, and that settles the\r\naccount.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Albert,” inquired Franz of his companion, “are you still\r\ndisposed to go to the Colosseum by the outer wall?”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” said Albert, “if the way be picturesque.”\r\n\r\nThe clock struck nine as the door opened, and a coachman appeared.\r\n\r\n“Excellencies,” said he, “the coach is ready.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Franz, “let us to the Colosseum.”\r\n\r\n“By the Porta del Popolo or by the streets, your excellencies?”\r\n\r\n“By the streets, _morbleu!_ by the streets!” cried Franz.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear fellow,” said Albert, rising, and lighting his third\r\ncigar, “really, I thought you had more courage.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the two young men went down the staircase, and got into the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n20131m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 34. The Colosseum\r\n\r\nFranz had so managed his route, that during the ride to the Colosseum\r\nthey passed not a single ancient ruin, so that no preliminary\r\nimpression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the\r\ngigantic building they came to admire. The road selected was a\r\ncontinuation of the Via Sistina; then by cutting off the right angle of\r\nthe street in which stands Santa Maria Maggiore and proceeding by the\r\nVia Urbana and San Pietro in Vincoli, the travellers would find\r\nthemselves directly opposite the Colosseum.\r\n\r\nThis itinerary possessed another great advantage,—that of leaving Franz\r\nat full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of Signor\r\nPastrini’s story, in which his mysterious host of Monte Cristo was so\r\nstrangely mixed up. Seated with folded arms in a corner of the\r\ncarriage, he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so\r\nlately listened to, and to ask himself an interminable number of\r\nquestions touching its various circumstances without, however, arriving\r\nat a satisfactory reply to any of them.\r\n\r\nOne fact more than the rest brought his friend “Sinbad the Sailor” back\r\nto his recollection, and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that\r\nseemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors; and Pastrini’s\r\naccount of Vampa’s having found refuge on board the vessels of\r\nsmugglers and fishermen, reminded Franz of the two Corsican bandits he\r\nhad found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht, which\r\nhad even deviated from its course and touched at Porto-Vecchio for the\r\nsole purpose of landing them. The very name assumed by his host of\r\nMonte Cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the Hôtel de\r\nLondres, abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing\r\nhis philanthropic part on the shores of Piombino, Civita Vecchia,\r\nOstia, and Gaëta, as on those of Corsica, Tuscany, and Spain; and\r\nfurther, Franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer\r\nspeak both of Tunis and Palermo, proving thereby how largely his circle\r\nof acquaintances extended.\r\n\r\nBut however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these\r\nreflections, they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark\r\nfrowning ruins of the stupendous Colosseum, through the various\r\nopenings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the\r\nunearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead. The carriage\r\nstopped near the Meta Sudans; the door was opened, and the young men,\r\neagerly alighting, found themselves opposite a _cicerone_, who appeared\r\nto have sprung up from the ground, so unexpected was his appearance.\r\n\r\nThe usual guide from the hotel having followed them, they had paid two\r\nconductors, nor is it possible, at Rome, to avoid this abundant supply\r\nof guides; besides the ordinary _cicerone_, who seizes upon you\r\ndirectly you set foot in your hotel, and never quits you while you\r\nremain in the city, there is also a special _cicerone_ belonging to\r\neach monument—nay, almost to each part of a monument. It may,\r\ntherefore, be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the\r\nColosseum, that wonder of all ages, which Martial thus eulogizes:\r\n\r\n“Let Memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids, and\r\nthe wonders of Babylon be talked of no more among us; all must bow to\r\nthe superiority of the gigantic labor of the Cæsars, and the many\r\nvoices of Fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this\r\nincomparable monument.”\r\n\r\nAs for Albert and Franz, they essayed not to escape from their\r\n_ciceronian_ tyrants; and, indeed, it would have been so much the more\r\ndifficult to break their bondage, as the guides alone are permitted to\r\nvisit these monuments with torches in their hands. Thus, then, the\r\nyoung men made no attempt at resistance, but blindly and confidingly\r\nsurrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors.\r\n\r\nFranz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the\r\nColosseum, while his less favored companion trod for the first time in\r\nhis life the classic ground forming the monument of Flavius Vespasian;\r\nand, to his credit be it spoken, his mind, even amid the glib loquacity\r\nof the guides, was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic\r\nadmiration of all he saw; and certainly no adequate notion of these\r\nstupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them, and\r\nmore especially by moonlight, at which time the vast proportions of the\r\nbuilding appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a\r\nsouthern moonlit sky, whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to\r\nlight the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western\r\nclime.\r\n\r\nScarcely, therefore, had the reflective Franz walked a hundred steps\r\nbeneath the interior porticoes of the ruin, when, abandoning Albert to\r\nthe guides (who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of\r\ncarrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down, and as\r\nregularly followed by them, but dragged the unconscious visitor to the\r\nvarious objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal,\r\nbeginning, as a matter of course, with the “Lions’ Den”, the “Hall of\r\nthe Gladiators” and finishing with “Cæsar’s Podium”), to escape a\r\njargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded,\r\nFranz ascended a half-dilapidated staircase, and, leaving them to\r\nfollow their monotonous round, seated himself at the foot of a column,\r\nand immediately opposite a large aperture, which permitted him to enjoy\r\na full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nFranz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by\r\nthe shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a\r\nresting-place, and from whence his eyes followed the motions of Albert\r\nand his guides, who, holding torches in their hands, had emerged from a\r\nvomitorium at the opposite extremity of the Colosseum, and then again\r\ndisappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the\r\nVestal virgins, resembling, as they glided along, some restless shades\r\nfollowing the flickering glare of so many _ignes fatui_. All at once\r\nhis ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the\r\nstaircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended. There was\r\nnothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving\r\nway and falling heavily below; but it seemed to him that the substance\r\nthat fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot, and also that\r\nsomeone, who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps\r\nfrom being heard, was approaching the spot where he sat.\r\n\r\nConjecture soon became certainty, for the figure of a man was\r\ndistinctly visible to Franz, gradually emerging from the staircase\r\nopposite, upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of\r\nsilvery brightness.\r\n\r\nThe stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who, like\r\nFranz, preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the\r\nfrivolous gabble of the guides. And his appearance had nothing\r\nextraordinary in it; but the hesitation with which he proceeded,\r\nstopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took,\r\nconvinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some person.\r\n\r\nBy a sort of instinctive impulse, Franz withdrew as much as possible\r\nbehind his pillar.\r\n\r\nAbout ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were, the roof\r\nhad given way, leaving a large round opening, through which might be\r\nseen the blue vault of heaven, thickly studded with stars.\r\n\r\nAround this opening, which had, possibly, for ages permitted a free\r\nentrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile,\r\ngrew a quantity of creeping plants, whose delicate green branches stood\r\nout in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament, while\r\nlarge masses of thick, strong fibrous shoots forced their way through\r\nthe chasm, and hung floating to and fro, like so many waving strings.\r\n\r\nThe person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of\r\nFranz stood in a kind of half-light, that rendered it impossible to\r\ndistinguish his features, although his dress was easily made out. He\r\nwore a large brown mantle, one fold of which, thrown over his left\r\nshoulder, served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance,\r\nwhile the upper part was completely hidden by his broad-brimmed hat.\r\nThe lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright\r\nrays of the moon, which, entering through the broken ceiling, shed\r\ntheir refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished\r\nleather, over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth.\r\n\r\n20135m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the imperfect means Franz had of judging, he could only come to\r\none conclusion,—that the person whom he was thus watching certainly\r\nbelonged to no inferior station of life.\r\n\r\nSome few minutes had elapsed, and the stranger began to show manifest\r\nsigns of impatience, when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture\r\nin the roof, and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct\r\nthe flood of light that had entered it, and the figure of a man was\r\nclearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath\r\nhim; then, as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle, he grasped a\r\nfloating mass of thickly matted boughs, and glided down by their help\r\nto within three or four feet of the ground, and then leaped lightly on\r\nhis feet. The man who had performed this daring act with so much\r\nindifference wore the Transtevere costume.\r\n\r\n“I beg your excellency’s pardon for keeping you waiting,” said the man,\r\nin the Roman dialect, “but I don’t think I’m many minutes after my\r\ntime, ten o’clock has just struck by the clock of Saint John Lateran.”\r\n\r\n“Say not a word about being late,” replied the stranger in purest\r\nTuscan; “’tis I who am too soon. But even if you had caused me to wait\r\na little while, I should have felt quite sure that the delay was not\r\noccasioned by any fault of yours.”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking,” said the man; “I\r\ncame here direct from the Castle of St. Angelo, and I had an immense\r\ndeal of trouble before I could get a chance to speak to Beppo.”\r\n\r\n“And who is Beppo?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Beppo is employed in the prison, and I give him so much a year to\r\nlet me know what is going on within his holiness’s castle.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed! You are a provident person, I see.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you see, no one knows what may happen. Perhaps some of these days\r\nI may be entrapped, like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have some\r\nlittle nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net, and so help me out\r\nof prison.”\r\n\r\n“Briefly, what did you learn?”\r\n\r\n“That two executions of considerable interest will take place the day\r\nafter tomorrow at two o’clock, as is customary at Rome at the\r\ncommencement of all great festivals. One of the culprits will be\r\n_mazzolato_;3 he is an atrocious villain, who murdered the priest who\r\nbrought him up, and deserves not the smallest pity. The other sufferer\r\nis sentenced to be _decapitato_;4 and he, your excellency, is poor\r\nPeppino.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is, that you have inspired not only the pontifical\r\ngovernment, but also the neighboring states, with such extreme fear,\r\nthat they are glad of all opportunity of making an example.”\r\n\r\n“But Peppino did not even belong to my band; he was merely a poor\r\nshepherd, whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions.”\r\n\r\n“Which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes. But mark\r\nthe distinction with which he is treated; instead of being knocked on\r\nthe head as you would be if once they caught hold of you, he is simply\r\nsentenced to be guillotined, by which means, too, the amusements of the\r\nday are diversified, and there is a spectacle to please every\r\nspectator.”\r\n\r\n“Without reckoning the wholly unexpected one I am preparing to surprise\r\nthem with.”\r\n\r\n“My good friend,” said the man in the cloak, “excuse me for saying that\r\nyou seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant\r\nact.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I am; but one thing I have resolved on, and that is, to stop\r\nat nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty, who has got into this\r\nscrape solely from having served me. I should hate and despise myself\r\nas a coward did I desert the brave fellow in his present extremity.”\r\n\r\n“And what do you mean to do?”\r\n\r\n“To surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men, who, at a signal\r\nfrom me, will rush forward directly Peppino is brought for execution,\r\nand, by the assistance of their stilettos, drive back the guard, and\r\ncarry off the prisoner.”\r\n\r\n“That seems to me as hazardous as uncertain, and convinces me that my\r\nscheme is far better than yours.”\r\n\r\n“And what is your excellency’s project?”\r\n\r\n“Just this. I will so advantageously bestow 2,000 piastres, that the\r\nperson receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for\r\nPeppino; and during that year, another skilfully placed 1,000 piastres\r\nwill afford him the means of escaping from his prison.”\r\n\r\n“And do you feel sure of succeeding?”\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_” exclaimed the man in the cloak, suddenly expressing\r\nhimself in French.\r\n\r\n“What did your excellency say?” inquired the other.\r\n\r\n“I said, my good fellow, that I would do more single-handed by the\r\nmeans of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos,\r\npistols, carbines, and blunderbusses included. Leave me, then, to act,\r\nand have no fears for the result.”\r\n\r\n“At least, there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness,\r\nin case your excellency should fail.”\r\n\r\n“None whatever. Take what precautions you please, if it is any\r\nsatisfaction to you to do so; but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve I\r\nseek.”\r\n\r\n“Remember, the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow, and that\r\nyou have but one day to work in.”\r\n\r\n“And what of that? Is not a day divided into twenty-four hours, each\r\nhour into sixty minutes, and every minute sub-divided into sixty\r\nseconds? Now in 86,400 seconds very many things can be done.”\r\n\r\n“And how shall I know whether your excellency has succeeded or not.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that is very easily arranged. I have engaged the three lower\r\nwindows at the Café Rospoli; should I have obtained the requisite\r\npardon for Peppino, the two outside windows will be hung with yellow\r\ndamasks, and the centre with white, having a large cross in red marked\r\non it.”\r\n\r\n“And whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer\r\ndirecting the execution?”\r\n\r\n“Send one of your men, disguised as a penitent friar, and I will give\r\nit to him. His dress will procure him the means of approaching the\r\nscaffold itself, and he will deliver the official order to the officer,\r\nwho, in his turn, will hand it to the executioner; in the meantime, it\r\nwill be as well to acquaint Peppino with what we have determined on, if\r\nit be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses, because\r\nin either case a very useless expense will have been incurred.”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency,” said the man, “you are fully persuaded of my entire\r\ndevotion to you, are you not?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, I flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it,” replied the\r\ncavalier in the cloak.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, only fulfil your promise of rescuing Peppino, and\r\nhenceforward you shall receive not only devotion, but the most absolute\r\nobedience from myself and those under me that one human being can\r\nrender to another.”\r\n\r\n“Have a care how far you pledge yourself, my good friend, for I may\r\nremind you of your promise at some, perhaps, not very distant period,\r\nwhen I, in my turn, may require your aid and influence.”\r\n\r\n“Let that day come sooner or later, your excellency will find me what I\r\nhave found you in this my heavy trouble; and if from the other end of\r\nthe world you but write me word to do such or such a thing, you may\r\nregard it as done, for done it shall be, on the word and faith of——”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” interrupted the stranger; “I hear a noise.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis some travellers, who are visiting the Colosseum by torchlight.”\r\n\r\n“’Twere better we should not be seen together; those guides are nothing\r\nbut spies, and might possibly recognize you; and, however I may be\r\nhonored by your friendship, my worthy friend, if once the extent of our\r\nintimacy were known, I am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit\r\nwould suffer thereby.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, if you obtain the reprieve?”\r\n\r\n“The middle window at the Café Rospoli will be hung with white damask,\r\nbearing a red cross.”\r\n\r\n“And if you fail?”\r\n\r\n“Then all three windows will have yellow draperies.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“And then, my good fellow, use your daggers in any way you please, and\r\nI further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess.”\r\n\r\n“We understand each other perfectly, then. Adieu, your excellency;\r\ndepend upon me as firmly as I do upon you.”\r\n\r\nSaying these words, the Transteverin disappeared down the staircase,\r\nwhile his companion, muffling his features more closely than before in\r\nthe folds of his mantle, passed almost close to Franz, and descended to\r\nthe arena by an outward flight of steps. The next minute Franz heard\r\nhimself called by Albert, who made the lofty building re-echo with the\r\nsound of his friend’s name. Franz, however, did not obey the summons\r\ntill he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he\r\nhad overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering\r\nthem in his descent. In ten minutes after the strangers had departed,\r\nFranz was on the road to the Piazza di Spagna, listening with studied\r\nindifference to the learned dissertation delivered by Albert, after the\r\nmanner of Pliny and Calpurnius, touching the iron-pointed nets used to\r\nprevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators.\r\n\r\nFranz let him proceed without interruption, and, in fact, did not hear\r\nwhat was said; he longed to be alone, and free to ponder over all that\r\nhad occurred. One of the two men, whose mysterious meeting in the\r\nColosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed, was an entire stranger\r\nto him, but not so the other; and though Franz had been unable to\r\ndistinguish his features, from his being either wrapped in his mantle\r\nor obscured by the shadow, the tones of his voice had made too powerful\r\nan impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever\r\nagain to forget them, hear them when or where he might. It was more\r\nespecially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting, half\r\nbitter, that Franz’s ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous, yet\r\nwell-pitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of Monte\r\nCristo, and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and\r\nruined grandeur of the Colosseum. And the more he thought, the more\r\nentire was his conviction, that the person who wore the mantle was no\r\nother than his former host and entertainer, “Sinbad the Sailor.”\r\n\r\n20139m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder any other circumstances, Franz would have found it impossible to\r\nresist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage,\r\nand with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance; but\r\nin the present instance, the confidential nature of the conversation he\r\nhad overheard made him, with propriety, judge that his appearance at\r\nsuch a time would be anything but agreeable. As we have seen,\r\ntherefore, he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a\r\nrecognition, but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his\r\npresent forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity.\r\n\r\nIn vain did Franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which\r\nassailed him; in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep. Slumber\r\nrefused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish\r\ncontemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the\r\nidentity of the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum with the\r\ninhabitant of the grotto of Monte Cristo; and the more he thought, the\r\nfirmer grew his opinion on the subject.\r\n\r\nWorn out at length, he fell asleep at daybreak, and did not awake till\r\nlate. Like a genuine Frenchman, Albert had employed his time in\r\narranging for the evening’s diversion; he had sent to engage a box at\r\nthe Teatro Argentina; and Franz, having a number of letters to write,\r\nrelinquished the carriage to Albert for the whole of the day.\r\n\r\nAt five o’clock Albert returned, delighted with his day’s work; he had\r\nbeen occupied in leaving his letters of introduction, and had received\r\nin return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible\r\nfor him to accept; besides this, he had seen (as he called it) all the\r\nremarkable sights at Rome. Yes, in a single day he had accomplished\r\nwhat his more serious-minded companion would have taken weeks to\r\neffect. Neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to\r\nbe played that night at the Teatro Argentina, and also what performers\r\nappeared in it. The opera of _Parisina_ was announced for\r\nrepresentation, and the principal actors were Coselli, Moriani, and La\r\nSpecchia.\r\n\r\nThe young men, therefore, had reason to consider themselves fortunate\r\nin having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the\r\ncomposer of _Lucia di Lammermoor_, supported by three of the most\r\nrenowned vocalists of Italy.\r\n\r\nAlbert had never been able to endure the Italian theatres, with their\r\norchestras from which it is impossible to see, and the absence of\r\nbalconies, or open boxes; all these defects pressed hard on a man who\r\nhad had his stall at the Bouffes, and had shared a lower box at the\r\nOpera. Still, in spite of this, Albert displayed his most dazzling and\r\neffective costumes each time he visited the theatres; but, alas, his\r\nelegant toilet was wholly thrown away, and one of the most worthy\r\nrepresentatives of Parisian fashion had to carry with him the\r\nmortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun Italy without meeting\r\nwith a single adventure.\r\n\r\nSometimes Albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success;\r\nbut internally he was deeply wounded, and his self-love immensely\r\npiqued, to think that Albert de Morcerf, the most admired and most\r\nsought after of any young person of his day, should thus be passed\r\nover, and merely have his labor for his pains. And the thing was so\r\nmuch the more annoying, as, according to the characteristic modesty of\r\na Frenchman, Albert had quitted Paris with the full conviction that he\r\nhad only to show himself in Italy to carry all before him, and that\r\nupon his return he should astonish the Parisian world with the recital\r\nof his numerous love-affairs.\r\n\r\nAlas, poor Albert! None of those interesting adventures fell in his\r\nway; the lovely Genoese, Florentines, and Neapolitans were all\r\nfaithful, if not to their husbands, at least to their lovers, and\r\nthought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of Albert de\r\nMorcerf; and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies\r\nof Italy have this advantage over those of France, that they are\r\nfaithful even in their infidelity.\r\n\r\nYet he could not restrain a hope that in Italy, as elsewhere, there\r\nmight be an exception to the general rule.\r\n\r\nAlbert, besides being an elegant, well-looking young man, was also\r\npossessed of considerable talent and ability; moreover, he was a\r\nviscount—a recently created one, certainly, but in the present day it\r\nis not necessary to go as far back as Noah in tracing a descent, and a\r\ngenealogical tree is equally estimated, whether dated from 1399 or\r\nmerely 1815; but to crown all these advantages, Albert de Morcerf\r\ncommanded an income of 50,000 livres, a more than sufficient sum to\r\nrender him a personage of considerable importance in Paris. It was\r\ntherefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the\r\nprincipal cities in Italy without having excited the most trifling\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nAlbert, however, hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and\r\nindifferences during the Carnival, knowing full well that among the\r\ndifferent states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated,\r\nRome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual\r\nrigidity of their lives, and deign to mingle in the follies of this\r\ntime of liberty and relaxation. The Carnival was to commence on the\r\nmorrow; therefore Albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth\r\nthe programme of his hopes, expectations, and claims to notice.\r\n\r\nWith this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of\r\nthe theatre, and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by\r\nthe aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet. The box taken by Albert\r\nwas in the first circle; although each of the three tiers of boxes is\r\ndeemed equally aristocratic, and is, for this reason, generally styled\r\nthe “nobility’s boxes,” and although the box engaged for the two\r\nfriends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons,\r\nit had cost less than would be paid at some of the French theatres for\r\none admitting merely four occupants.\r\n\r\nAnother motive had influenced Albert’s selection of his seat,—who knew\r\nbut that, thus advantageously placed, he might not in truth attract the\r\nnotice of some fair Roman, and an introduction might ensue that would\r\nprocure him the offer of a seat in a carriage, or a place in a princely\r\nbalcony, from which he might behold the gayeties of the Carnival?\r\n\r\nThese united considerations made Albert more lively and anxious to\r\nplease than he had hitherto been. Totally disregarding the business of\r\nthe stage, he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing\r\nthe beauty of each pretty woman, aided by a powerful opera-glass; but,\r\nalas, this attempt to attract notice wholly failed; not even curiosity\r\nhad been excited, and it was but too apparent that the lovely\r\ncreatures, into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing, were all\r\nso much engrossed with themselves, their lovers, or their own thoughts,\r\nthat they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival, with the\r\n“Holy Week” that was to succeed it, so filled every fair breast, as to\r\nprevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the\r\nstage. The actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought\r\nof; at certain conventional moments, the spectators would suddenly\r\ncease their conversation, or rouse themselves from their musings, to\r\nlisten to some brilliant effort of Moriani’s, a well-executed\r\nrecitative by Coselli, or to join in loud applause at the wonderful\r\npowers of La Specchia; but that momentary excitement over, they quickly\r\nrelapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the first act, the door of a box which had been\r\nhitherto vacant was opened; a lady entered to whom Franz had been\r\nintroduced in Paris, where indeed, he had imagined she still was. The\r\nquick eye of Albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend\r\nbeheld the new arrival, and, turning to him, he said hastily:\r\n\r\n“Do you know the woman who has just entered that box?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; what do you think of her?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, she is perfectly lovely—what a complexion! And such magnificent\r\nhair! Is she French?”\r\n\r\n“No; a Venetian.”\r\n\r\n“And her name is——”\r\n\r\n“Countess G——.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I know her by name!” exclaimed Albert; “she is said to possess as\r\nmuch wit and cleverness as beauty. I was to have been presented to her\r\nwhen I met her at Madame Villefort’s ball.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence?” asked Franz.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, are you really on such good terms with her as to\r\nventure to take me to her box?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing\r\nwith her three or four times in my life; but you know that even such an\r\nacquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask.”\r\n\r\nAt that instant, the countess perceived Franz, and graciously waved her\r\nhand to him, to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the\r\nhead. “Upon my word,” said Albert, “you seem to be on excellent terms\r\nwith the beautiful countess.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken in thinking so,” returned Franz calmly; “but you\r\nmerely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen\r\nto commit the most egregious blunders,—I mean that of judging the\r\nhabits and customs of Italy and Spain by our Parisian notions; believe\r\nme, nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree\r\nof intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar\r\nterms they seem upon; there is a similarity of feeling at this instant\r\nbetween ourselves and the countess—nothing more.”\r\n\r\n“Is there, indeed, my good fellow? Pray tell me, is it sympathy of\r\nheart?”\r\n\r\n“No; of taste,” continued Franz gravely.\r\n\r\n“And in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced?”\r\n\r\n“By the countess’s visiting the Colosseum, as we did last night, by\r\nmoonlight, and nearly alone.”\r\n\r\n“You were with her, then?”\r\n\r\n“I was.”\r\n\r\n“And what did you say to her?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is\r\na glorious monument!”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” cried Albert, “you must have been a very entertaining\r\ncompanion alone, or all but alone, with a beautiful woman in such a\r\nplace of sentiment as the Colosseum, and yet to find nothing better to\r\ntalk about than the dead! All I can say is, if ever I should get such a\r\nchance, the living should be my theme.”\r\n\r\n20143m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“And you will probably find your theme ill-chosen.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Albert, breaking in upon his discourse, “never mind the\r\npast; let us only remember the present. Are you not going to keep your\r\npromise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, directly the curtain falls on the stage.”\r\n\r\n“What a confounded long time this first act lasts. I believe, on my\r\nsoul, that they never mean to finish it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, they will; only listen to that charming finale. How\r\nexquisitely Coselli sings his part.”\r\n\r\n“But what an awkward, inelegant fellow he is.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, what do you say to La Specchia? Did you ever see anything\r\nmore perfect than her acting?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you know, my dear fellow, when one has been accustomed to\r\nMalibran and Sontag, such singers as these don’t make the same\r\nimpression on you they perhaps do on others.”\r\n\r\n“At least, you must admire Moriani’s style and execution.”\r\n\r\n“I never fancied men of his dark, ponderous appearance singing with a\r\nvoice like a woman’s.”\r\n\r\n“My good friend,” said Franz, turning to him, while Albert continued to\r\npoint his glass at every box in the theatre, “you seem determined not\r\nto approve; you are really too difficult to please.”\r\n\r\nThe curtain at length fell on the performances, to the infinite\r\nsatisfaction of the Viscount of Morcerf, who seized his hat, rapidly\r\npassed his fingers through his hair, arranged his cravat and\r\nwristbands, and signified to Franz that he was waiting for him to lead\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nFranz, who had mutely interrogated the countess, and received from her\r\na gracious smile in token that he would be welcome, sought not to\r\nretard the gratification of Albert’s eager impatience, but began at\r\nonce the tour of the house, closely followed by Albert, who availed\r\nhimself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the\r\ntheatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar, and to\r\narrange the lappets of his coat. This important task was just completed\r\nas they arrived at the countess’s box.\r\n\r\nAt the knock, the door was immediately opened, and the young man who\r\nwas seated beside the countess, in obedience to the Italian custom,\r\ninstantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers, who, in\r\nturn, would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors.\r\n\r\nFranz presented Albert as one of the most distinguished young men of\r\nthe day, both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary\r\ntalents; nor did he say more than the truth, for in Paris and the\r\ncircle in which the viscount moved, he was looked upon and cited as a\r\nmodel of perfection. Franz added that his companion, deeply grieved at\r\nhaving been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess\r\nduring her sojourn in Paris, was most anxious to make up for it, and\r\nhad requested him (Franz) to remedy the past misfortune by conducting\r\nhim to her box, and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in\r\nhaving taken it upon himself to do so.\r\n\r\nThe countess, in reply, bowed gracefully to Albert, and extended her\r\nhand with cordial kindness to Franz; then, inviting Albert to take the\r\nvacant seat beside her, she recommended Franz to take the next best, if\r\nhe wished to view the ballet, and pointed to the one behind her own\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nAlbert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon Paris and Parisian\r\nmatters, speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew\r\nthere. Franz perceived how completely he was in his element; and,\r\nunwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt, took up\r\nAlbert’s glass, and began in his turn to survey the audience.\r\n\r\nSitting alone, in the front of a box immediately opposite, but situated\r\non the third row, was a woman of exquisite beauty, dressed in a Greek\r\ncostume, which evidently, from the ease and grace with which she wore\r\nit, was her national attire. Behind her, but in deep shadow, was the\r\noutline of a masculine figure; but the features of this latter\r\npersonage it was not possible to distinguish. Franz could not forbear\r\nbreaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing\r\nbetween the countess and Albert, to inquire of the former if she knew\r\nwho was the fair Albanian opposite, since beauty such as hers was well\r\nworthy of being observed by either sex.\r\n\r\n“All I can tell about her,” replied the countess, “is, that she has\r\nbeen at Rome since the beginning of the season; for I saw her where she\r\nnow sits the very first night of the season, and since then she has\r\nnever missed a performance. Sometimes she is accompanied by the person\r\nwho is now with her, and at others she is merely attended by a black\r\nservant.”\r\n\r\n“And what do you think of her personal appearance?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I consider her perfectly lovely—she is just my idea of what Medora\r\nmust have been.”\r\n\r\nFranz and the countess exchanged a smile, and then the latter resumed\r\nher conversation with Albert, while Franz returned to his previous\r\nsurvey of the house and company. The curtain rose on the ballet, which\r\nwas one of those excellent specimens of the Italian school, admirably\r\narranged and put on the stage by Henri, who has established for himself\r\na great reputation throughout Italy for his taste and skill in the\r\nchoreographic art—one of those masterly productions of grace, method,\r\nand elegance in which the whole _corps de ballet_, from the principal\r\ndancers to the humblest supernumerary, are all engaged on the stage at\r\nthe same time; and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting\r\nthe same attitude, or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous\r\nmovement, that would lead you to suppose that but one mind, one act of\r\nvolition, influenced the moving mass.\r\n\r\nThe ballet was called _Poliska_.\r\n\r\nHowever much the ballet might have claimed his attention, Franz was too\r\ndeeply occupied with the beautiful Greek to take any note of it; while\r\nshe seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it,\r\nher eager, animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter\r\nindifference of her companion, who, during the whole time the piece\r\nlasted, never even moved, not even when the furious, crashing din\r\nproduced by the trumpets, cymbals, and Chinese bells sounded their\r\nloudest from the orchestra. Of this he took no heed, but was, as far as\r\nappearances might be trusted, enjoying soft repose and bright celestial\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nThe ballet at length came to a close, and the curtain fell amid the\r\nloud, unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience.\r\n\r\nOwing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera\r\nwith a ballet, the pauses between the performances are very short, the\r\nsingers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their\r\ncostume, when necessary, while the dancers are executing their\r\npirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps.\r\n\r\nThe overture to the second act began; and, at the first sound of the\r\nleader’s bow across his violin, Franz observed the sleeper slowly arise\r\nand approach the Greek girl, who turned around to say a few words to\r\nhim, and then, leaning forward again on the railing of her box, she\r\nbecame as absorbed as before in what was going on.\r\n\r\nThe countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so\r\ncompletely in the shade, that, though Franz tried his utmost, he could\r\nnot distinguish a single feature. The curtain rose, and the attention\r\nof Franz was attracted by the actors; and his eyes turned from the box\r\ncontaining the Greek girl and her strange companion to watch the\r\nbusiness of the stage.\r\n\r\nMost of my readers are aware that the second act of _Parisina_ opens\r\nwith the celebrated and effective duet in which Parisina, while\r\nsleeping, betrays to Azzo the secret of her love for Ugo. The injured\r\nhusband goes through all the emotions of jealousy, until conviction\r\nseizes on his mind, and then, in a frenzy of rage and indignation, he\r\nawakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to\r\nthreaten her with his vengeance.\r\n\r\nThis duet is one of the most beautiful, expressive and terrible\r\nconceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of Donizetti.\r\nFranz now listened to it for the third time; yet its notes, so tenderly\r\nexpressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give\r\nvent to their different griefs and passions, thrilled through the soul\r\nof Franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it.\r\nExcited beyond his usual calm demeanor, Franz rose with the audience,\r\nand was about to join the loud, enthusiastic applause that followed;\r\nbut suddenly his purpose was arrested, his hands fell by his sides, and\r\nthe half-uttered “bravos” expired on his lips.\r\n\r\nThe occupant of the box in which the Greek girl sat appeared to share\r\nthe universal admiration that prevailed; for he left his seat to stand\r\nup in front, so that, his countenance being fully revealed, Franz had\r\nno difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of Monte\r\nCristo, and the very same person he had encountered the preceding\r\nevening in the ruins of the Colosseum, and whose voice and figure had\r\nseemed so familiar to him.\r\n\r\nAll doubt of his identity was now at an end; his singular host\r\nevidently resided at Rome. The surprise and agitation occasioned by\r\nthis full confirmation of Franz’s former suspicion had no doubt\r\nimparted a corresponding expression to his features; for the countess,\r\nafter gazing with a puzzled look at his face, burst into a fit of\r\nlaughter, and begged to know what had happened.\r\n\r\n“Countess,” returned Franz, totally unheeding her raillery, “I asked\r\nyou a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the\r\nAlbanian lady opposite; I must now beseech you to inform me who and\r\nwhat is her husband?”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” answered the countess, “I know no more of him than yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you never before noticed him?”\r\n\r\n“What a question—so truly French! Do you not know that we Italians have\r\neyes only for the man we love?”\r\n\r\n“True,” replied Franz.\r\n\r\n“All I can say is,” continued the countess, taking up the _lorgnette_,\r\nand directing it toward the box in question, “that the gentleman, whose\r\nhistory I am unable to furnish, seems to me as though he had just been\r\ndug up; he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly\r\ngrave-digger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of\r\nours, than anything human. How ghastly pale he is!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he is always as colorless as you now see him,” said Franz.\r\n\r\n“Then you know him?” almost screamed the countess. “Oh, pray do, for\r\nheaven’s sake, tell us all about—is he a vampire, or a resuscitated\r\ncorpse, or what?”\r\n\r\n“I fancy I have seen him before; and I even think he recognizes me.”\r\n\r\n“And I can well understand,” said the countess, shrugging up her\r\nbeautiful shoulders, as though an involuntary shudder passed through\r\nher veins, “that those who have once seen that man will never be likely\r\nto forget him.”\r\n\r\nThe sensation experienced by Franz was evidently not peculiar to\r\nhimself; another, and wholly uninterested person, felt the same\r\nunaccountable awe and misgiving.\r\n\r\n“Well.” inquired Franz, after the countess had a second time directed\r\nher _lorgnette_ at the box, “what do you think of our opposite\r\nneighbor?”\r\n\r\n20147m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Why, that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living form.”\r\n\r\nThis fresh allusion to Byron5 drew a smile to Franz’s countenance;\r\nalthough he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce\r\nbelief in the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of such a\r\nman as the mysterious personage before him.\r\n\r\n“I must positively find out who and what he is,” said Franz, rising\r\nfrom his seat.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” cried the countess; “you must not leave me. I depend upon you\r\nto escort me home. Oh, indeed, I cannot permit you to go.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible,” whispered Franz, “that you entertain any fear?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you,” answered the countess. “Byron had the most perfect\r\nbelief in the existence of vampires, and even assured me that he had\r\nseen them. The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the\r\nfeatures and character of the man before us. Oh, he is the exact\r\npersonification of what I have been led to expect! The coal-black hair,\r\nlarge bright, glittering eyes, in which a wild, unearthly fire seems\r\nburning,—the same ghastly paleness. Then observe, too, that the woman\r\nwith him is altogether unlike all others of her sex. She is a\r\nforeigner—a stranger. Nobody knows who she is, or where she comes from.\r\nNo doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does, and is, like\r\nhimself, a dealer in magical arts. I entreat of you not to go near\r\nhim—at least tonight; and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as\r\ngreat, pursue your researches if you will; but tonight you neither can\r\nnor shall. For that purpose I mean to keep you all to myself.”\r\n\r\nFranz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day,\r\nfor many reasons.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me,” said the countess, “and do not be so very headstrong. I\r\nam going home. I have a party at my house tonight, and therefore cannot\r\npossibly remain till the end of the opera. Now, I cannot for one\r\ninstant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your\r\nescort when she even condescends to ask you for it.”\r\n\r\nThere was nothing else left for Franz to do but to take up his hat,\r\nopen the door of the box, and offer the countess his arm. It was quite\r\nevident, by her manner, that her uneasiness was not feigned; and Franz\r\nhimself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread—so much the\r\nstronger in him, as it arose from a variety of corroborative\r\nrecollections, while the terror of the countess sprang from an\r\ninstinctive belief, originally created in her mind by the wild tales\r\nshe had listened to till she believed them truths. Franz could even\r\nfeel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage. Upon\r\narriving at her hotel, Franz perceived that she had deceived him when\r\nshe spoke of expecting company; on the contrary, her own return before\r\nthe appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants.\r\n\r\n“Excuse my little subterfuge,” said the countess, in reply to her\r\ncompanion’s half-reproachful observation on the subject; “but that\r\nhorrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable, and I longed to be\r\nalone, that I might compose my startled mind.”\r\n\r\nFranz essayed to smile.\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said she, “do not smile; it ill accords with the expression of\r\nyour countenance, and I am sure it does not spring from your heart.\r\nHowever, promise me one thing.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Promise me, I say.”\r\n\r\n“I will do anything you desire, except relinquish my determination of\r\nfinding out who this man is. I have more reasons than you can imagine\r\nfor desiring to know who he is, from whence he came, and whither he is\r\ngoing.”\r\n\r\n“Where he comes from I am ignorant; but I can readily tell you where he\r\nis going to, and that is down below, without the least doubt.”\r\n\r\n“Let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make,” said Franz.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, you must give me your word to return immediately to your\r\nhotel, and make no attempt to follow this man tonight. There are\r\ncertain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet\r\nafterwards. For heaven’s sake, do not serve as a conductor between that\r\nman and me. Pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you\r\nplease; but never bring him near me, if you would not see me die of\r\nterror. And now, good-night; go to your rooms, and try to sleep away\r\nall recollections of this evening. For my own part, I am quite sure I\r\nshall not be able to close my eyes.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the countess quitted Franz, leaving him unable to decide\r\nwhether she were merely amusing herself at his expense, or whether her\r\nfears and agitations were genuine.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to the hotel, Franz found Albert in his dressing-gown\r\nand slippers, listlessly extended on a sofa, smoking a cigar.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow!” cried he, springing up, “is it really you? Why, I did\r\nnot expect to see you before tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Albert,” replied Franz, “I am glad of this opportunity to tell\r\nyou, once and forever, that you entertain a most erroneous notion\r\nconcerning Italian women. I should have thought the continual failures\r\nyou have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you\r\nbetter by this time.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my soul, these women would puzzle the very Devil to read them\r\naright. Why, here—they give you their hand—they press yours in\r\nreturn—they keep up a whispering conversation—permit you to accompany\r\nthem home. Why, if a Parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these\r\nmarks of flattering attention, her reputation would be gone forever.”\r\n\r\n“And the very reason why the women of this fine country, ‘where sounds\r\nthe _si_,’ as Dante writes, put so little restraint on their words and\r\nactions, is because they live so much in public, and have really\r\nnothing to conceal. Besides, you must have perceived that the countess\r\nwas really alarmed.”\r\n\r\n“At what? At the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite\r\nto us in the same box with the lovely Greek girl? Now, for my part, I\r\nmet them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece; and hang me,\r\nif I can guess where you took your notions of the other world from. I\r\ncan assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine-looking\r\nfellow—admirably dressed. Indeed, I feel quite sure, from the cut of\r\nhis clothes, they are made by a first-rate Paris tailor—probably Blin\r\nor Humann. He was rather too pale, certainly; but then, you know,\r\npaleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic\r\ndescent and distinguished breeding.”\r\n\r\nFranz smiled; for he well remembered that Albert particularly prided\r\nhimself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion.\r\n\r\n“Well, that tends to confirm my own ideas,” said Franz, “that the\r\ncountess’s suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason. Did he\r\nspeak in your hearing? and did you catch any of his words?”\r\n\r\n“I did; but they were uttered in the Romaic dialect. I knew that from\r\nthe mixture of Greek words. I don’t know whether I ever told you that\r\nwhen I was at college I was rather—rather strong in Greek.”\r\n\r\n“He spoke the Romaic language, did he?”\r\n\r\n“I think so.”\r\n\r\n“That settles it,” murmured Franz. “’Tis he, past all doubt.”\r\n\r\n“What do you say?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, nothing. But tell me, what were you thinking about when I\r\ncame in?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I was arranging a little surprise for you.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed. Of what nature?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; and I also know that we have done all that human means\r\nafforded to endeavor to get one.”\r\n\r\n“Now, then, in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my\r\nbrain.”\r\n\r\nFranz looked at Albert as though he had not much confidence in the\r\nsuggestions of his imagination.\r\n\r\n“I tell you what, M. Franz,” cried Albert, “you deserve to be called\r\nout for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were\r\npleased to bestow on me just now.”\r\n\r\n“And I promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your\r\nscheme turns out as ingenious as you assert.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, hearken to me.”\r\n\r\n“I listen.”\r\n\r\n“You agree, do you not, that obtaining a carriage is out of the\r\nquestion?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“Neither can we procure horses?”\r\n\r\n“True; we have offered any sum, but have failed.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now, what do you say to a cart? I dare say such a thing might be\r\nhad.”\r\n\r\n“Very possibly.”\r\n\r\n“And a pair of oxen?”\r\n\r\n“As easily found as the cart.”\r\n\r\n“Then you see, my good fellow, with a cart and a couple of oxen our\r\nbusiness can be managed. The cart must be tastefully ornamented; and if\r\nyou and I dress ourselves as Neapolitan reapers, we may get up a\r\nstriking tableau, after the manner of that splendid picture by Léopold\r\nRobert. It would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join\r\nus in the costume of a peasant from Puzzoli or Sorrento. Our group\r\nwould then be quite complete, more especially as the countess is quite\r\nbeautiful enough to represent a Madonna.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Franz, “this time, M. Albert, I am bound to give you\r\ncredit for having hit upon a most capital idea.”\r\n\r\n“And quite a national one, too,” replied Albert with gratified pride.\r\n“A mere masque borrowed from our own festivities. Ha, ha, ye Romans!\r\nyou thought to make us, unhappy strangers, trot at the heels of your\r\nprocessions, like so many lazzaroni, because no carriages or horses are\r\nto be had in your beggarly city. But you don’t know us; when we can’t\r\nhave one thing we invent another.”\r\n\r\n“And have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody?”\r\n\r\n“Only to our host. Upon my return home I sent for him, and I then\r\nexplained to him what I wished to procure. He assured me that nothing\r\nwould be easier than to furnish all I desired. One thing I was sorry\r\nfor; when I bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded, he told me\r\nthere would not be time, as it would require three days to do that; so\r\nyou see we must do without this little superfluity.”\r\n\r\n“And where is he now?”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Our host.”\r\n\r\n“Gone out in search of our equipage, by tomorrow it might be too late.”\r\n\r\n“Then he will be able to give us an answer tonight.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I expect him every minute.”\r\n\r\nAt this instant the door opened, and the head of Signor Pastrini\r\nappeared. “_Permesso_?” inquired he.\r\n\r\n“Certainly—certainly,” cried Franz. “Come in, my host.”\r\n\r\n“Now, then,” asked Albert eagerly, “have you found the desired cart and\r\noxen?”\r\n\r\n“Better than that!” replied Signor Pastrini, with the air of a man\r\nperfectly well satisfied with himself.\r\n\r\n“Take care, my worthy host,” said Albert, “_better_ is a sure enemy to\r\n_well_.”\r\n\r\n“Let your excellencies only leave the matter to me,” returned Signor\r\nPastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self-confidence.\r\n\r\n“But what _have_ you done?” asked Franz. “Speak out, there’s a worthy\r\nfellow.”\r\n\r\n“Your excellencies are aware,” responded the landlord, swelling with\r\nimportance, “that the Count of Monte Cristo is living on the same floor\r\nwith yourselves!”\r\n\r\n“I should think we did know it,” exclaimed Albert, “since it is owing\r\nto that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms, like\r\ntwo poor students in the back streets of Paris.”\r\n\r\n“When, then, the Count of Monte Cristo, hearing of the dilemma in which\r\nyou are placed, has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two\r\nplaces at his windows in the Palazzo Rospoli.” The friends looked at\r\neach other with unutterable surprise.\r\n\r\n“But do you think,” asked Albert, “that we ought to accept such offers\r\nfrom a perfect stranger?”\r\n\r\n“What sort of person is this Count of Monte Cristo?” asked Franz of his\r\nhost.\r\n\r\n“A very great nobleman, but whether Maltese or Sicilian I cannot\r\nexactly say; but this I know, that he is noble as a Borghese and rich\r\nas a gold mine.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Franz, speaking in an undertone to Albert, “that\r\nif this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord, he would\r\nhave conveyed his invitation through another channel, and not permitted\r\nit to be brought to us in this unceremonious way. He would have\r\nwritten—or——”\r\n\r\nAt this instant someone knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” said Franz.\r\n\r\nA servant, wearing a livery of considerable style and richness,\r\nappeared at the threshold, and, placing two cards in the landlord’s\r\nhands, who forthwith presented them to the two young men, he said:\r\n\r\n“Please to deliver these, from the Count of Monte Cristo to Vicomte\r\nAlbert de Morcerf and M. Franz d’Épinay. The Count of Monte Cristo,”\r\ncontinued the servant, “begs these gentlemen’s permission to wait upon\r\nthem as their neighbor, and he will be honored by an intimation of what\r\ntime they will please to receive him.”\r\n\r\n“Faith, Franz,” whispered Albert, “there is not much to find fault with\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“Tell the count,” replied Franz, “that we will do ourselves the\r\npleasure of calling on him.”\r\n\r\nThe servant bowed and retired.\r\n\r\n“That is what I call an elegant mode of attack,” said Albert, “You were\r\nquite correct in what you said, Signor Pastrini. The Count of Monte\r\nCristo is unquestionably a man of first-rate breeding and knowledge of\r\nthe world.”\r\n\r\n“Then you accept his offer?” said the host.\r\n\r\n“Of course we do,” replied Albert. “Still, I must own I am sorry to be\r\nobliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers—it would have\r\nproduced such an effect! And were it not for the windows at the Palazzo\r\nRospoli, by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme, I\r\ndon’t know but what I should have held on by my original plan. What say\r\nyou, Franz?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I agree with you; the windows in the Palazzo Rospoli alone decided\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that the mention of two places in the Palazzo Rospoli\r\nhad recalled to Franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding\r\nevening in the ruins of the Colosseum between the mysterious unknown\r\nand the Transteverin, in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken\r\nto obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal; and if this muffled-up\r\nindividual proved (as Franz felt sure he would) the same as the person\r\nhe had just seen in the Teatro Argentina, then he should be able to\r\nestablish his identity, and also to prosecute his researches respecting\r\nhim with perfect facility and freedom.\r\n\r\nFranz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings\r\nhe had already had with his mysterious tormentor, and in waking\r\nspeculations as to what the morrow would produce. The next day must\r\nclear up every doubt; and unless his near neighbor and would-be friend,\r\nthe Count of Monte Cristo, possessed the ring of Gyges, and by its\r\npower was able to render himself invisible, it was very certain he\r\ncould not escape this time.\r\n\r\nEight o’clock found Franz up and dressed, while Albert, who had not the\r\nsame motives for early rising, was still soundly asleep. The first act\r\nof Franz was to summon his landlord, who presented himself with his\r\naccustomed obsequiousness.\r\n\r\n“Pray, Signor Pastrini,” asked Franz, “is not some execution appointed\r\nto take place today?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your excellency; but if your reason for inquiry is that you may\r\nprocure a window to view it from, you are much too late.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” answered Franz, “I had no such intention; and even if I had\r\nfelt a wish to witness the spectacle, I might have done so from Monte\r\nPincio; could I not?”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed mine host, “I did not think it likely your excellency\r\nwould have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected\r\non that hill, which, indeed, they consider as exclusively belonging to\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\n“Very possibly I may not go,” answered Franz; “but in case I feel\r\ndisposed, give me some particulars of today’s executions.”\r\n\r\n“What particulars would your excellency like to hear?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the number of persons condemned to suffer, their names, and\r\ndescription of the death they are to die.”\r\n\r\n“That happens just lucky, your excellency! Only a few minutes ago they\r\nbrought me the _tavolettas_.”\r\n\r\n“What are they?”\r\n\r\n“Sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening\r\nbefore an execution, on which is pasted up a paper containing the names\r\nof the condemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment. The\r\nreason for so publicly announcing all this is, that all good and\r\nfaithful Catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate\r\nculprits, and, above all, beseech of Heaven to grant them a sincere\r\nrepentance.”\r\n\r\n“And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to\r\nthose of the faithful, are they?” asked Franz somewhat incredulously.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear, no, your excellency! I have not time for anybody’s affairs\r\nbut my own and those of my honorable guests; but I make an agreement\r\nwith the man who pastes up the papers, and he brings them to me as he\r\nwould the playbills, that in case any person staying at my hotel should\r\nlike to witness an execution, he may obtain every requisite information\r\nconcerning the time and place etc.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, that is a most delicate attention on your part, Signor\r\nPastrini,” cried Franz.\r\n\r\n“Why, your excellency,” returned the landlord, chuckling and rubbing\r\nhis hands with infinite complacency, “I think I may take upon myself to\r\nsay I neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble\r\nvisitors to this poor hotel.”\r\n\r\n“I see that plainly enough, my most excellent host, and you may rely\r\nupon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your\r\nguests wherever I go. Meanwhile, oblige me by a sight of one of these\r\n_tavolettas_.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency’s wish,”\r\nsaid the landlord, opening the door of the chamber; “I have caused one\r\nto be placed on the landing, close by your apartment.”\r\n\r\nThen, taking the tablet from the wall, he handed it to Franz, who read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“‘The public is informed that on Wednesday, February 23rd, being the\r\nfirst day of the Carnival, executions will take place in the Piazza del\r\nPopolo, by order of the Tribunal of the Rota, of two persons, named\r\nAndrea Rondolo, and Peppino, otherwise called Rocca Priori; the former\r\nfound guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest, named\r\nDon César Torlini, canon of the church of St. John Lateran; and the\r\nlatter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary\r\nbandit, Luigi Vampa, and his band. The first-named malefactor will be\r\n_mazzolato_, the second culprit _decapitato_.\r\n\r\n“‘The prayers of all good Christians are entreated for these\r\nunfortunate men, that it may please God to awaken them to a sense of\r\ntheir guilt, and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for\r\ntheir crimes.’”\r\n\r\nThis was precisely what Franz had heard the evening before in the ruins\r\nof the Colosseum. No part of the programme differed,—the names of the\r\ncondemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment, all agreed\r\nwith his previous information. In all probability, therefore, the\r\nTransteverin was no other than the bandit Luigi Vampa himself, and the\r\nman shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as “Sinbad the\r\nSailor,” but who, no doubt, was still pursuing his philanthropic\r\nexpedition in Rome, as he had already done at Porto-Vecchio and Tunis.\r\n\r\nTime was getting on, however, and Franz deemed it advisable to awaken\r\nAlbert; but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber, his\r\nfriend entered the room in perfect costume for the day. The anticipated\r\ndelights of the Carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave\r\nhis pillow long before his usual hour.\r\n\r\n“Now, my excellent Signor Pastrini,” said Franz, addressing his\r\nlandlord, “since we are both ready, do you think we may proceed at once\r\nto visit the Count of Monte Cristo?”\r\n\r\n“Most assuredly,” replied he. “The Count of Monte Cristo is always an\r\nearly riser; and I can answer for his having been up these two hours.”\r\n\r\n“Then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our\r\nrespects to him directly?”\r\n\r\n20155m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am quite sure. I will take all the blame on myself if you find I\r\nhave led you into an error.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, if it be so, are you ready, Albert?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, let us do so.”\r\n\r\nThe landlord preceded the friends across the landing, which was all\r\nthat separated them from the apartments of the count, rang at the bell,\r\nand, upon the door being opened by a servant, said:\r\n\r\n“_I signori Francesi_.”\r\n\r\nThe domestic bowed respectfully, and invited them to enter. They passed\r\nthrough two rooms, furnished in a luxurious manner they had not\r\nexpected to see under the roof of Signor Pastrini, and were shown into\r\nan elegantly fitted-up drawing-room. The richest Turkey carpets covered\r\nthe floor, and the softest and most inviting couches, easy-chairs, and\r\nsofas, offered their high-piled and yielding cushions to such as\r\ndesired repose or refreshment. Splendid paintings by the first masters\r\nwere ranged against the walls, intermingled with magnificent trophies\r\nof war, while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before\r\nthe different doors of the room.\r\n\r\n“If your excellencies will please to be seated,” said the man, “I will\r\nlet the count know that you are here.”\r\n\r\nAnd with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried\r\n_portières_. As the door opened, the sound of a _guzla_ reached the\r\nears of the young men, but was almost immediately lost, for the rapid\r\nclosing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter.\r\nFranz and Albert looked inquiringly at each other, then at the gorgeous\r\nfurnishings of the apartment. Everything seemed more magnificent at a\r\nsecond view than it had done at their first rapid survey.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Franz to his friend, “what think you of all this?”\r\n\r\n“Why, upon my soul, my dear fellow, it strikes me that our elegant and\r\nattentive neighbor must either be some successful stock-jobber who has\r\nspeculated in the fall of the Spanish funds, or some prince travelling\r\n_incog_.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, hush!” replied Franz; “we shall ascertain who and what he is—he\r\ncomes!”\r\n\r\nAs Franz spoke, he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges, and\r\nalmost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside, and the\r\nowner of all these riches stood before the two young men. Albert\r\ninstantly rose to meet him, but Franz remained, in a manner, spellbound\r\non his chair; for in the person of him who had just entered he\r\nrecognized not only the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum, and the\r\noccupant of the box at the Teatro Argentina, but also his extraordinary\r\nhost of Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n20157m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 35. La Mazzolata\r\n\r\nGentlemen,” said the Count of Monte Cristo as he entered, “I pray you\r\nexcuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated; but I feared to\r\ndisturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments; besides,\r\nyou sent me word that you would come to me, and I have held myself at\r\nyour disposal.”\r\n\r\n“Franz and I have to thank you a thousand times, count,” returned\r\nAlbert; “you extricated us from a great dilemma, and we were on the\r\npoint of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly\r\ninvitation reached us.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” returned the count, motioning the two young men to sit down.\r\n“It was the fault of that blockhead Pastrini, that I did not sooner\r\nassist you in your distress. He did not mention a syllable of your\r\nembarrassment to me, when he knows that, alone and isolated as I am, I\r\nseek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors. As\r\nsoon as I learned I could in any way assist you, I most eagerly seized\r\nthe opportunity of offering my services.”\r\n\r\nThe two young men bowed. Franz had, as yet, found nothing to say; he\r\nhad come to no determination, and as nothing in the count’s manner\r\nmanifested the wish that he should recognize him, he did not know\r\nwhether to make any allusion to the past, or wait until he had more\r\nproof; besides, although sure it was he who had been in the box the\r\nprevious evening, he could not be equally positive that this was the\r\nman he had seen at the Colosseum. He resolved, therefore, to let things\r\ntake their course without making any direct overture to the count.\r\nMoreover, he had this advantage, he was master of the count’s secret,\r\nwhile the count had no hold on Franz, who had nothing to conceal.\r\nHowever, he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might\r\npossibly clear up his doubts.\r\n\r\n“Count,” said he, “you have offered us places in your carriage, and at\r\nyour windows in the Rospoli Palace. Can you tell us where we can obtain\r\na sight of the Piazza del Popolo?”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the count negligently, looking attentively at Morcerf, “is\r\nthere not something like an execution upon the Piazza del Popolo?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned Franz, finding that the count was coming to the point\r\nhe wished.\r\n\r\n“Stay, I think I told my steward yesterday to attend to this; perhaps I\r\ncan render you this slight service also.”\r\n\r\nHe extended his hand, and rang the bell thrice.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever occupy yourself,” said he to Franz, “with the employment\r\nof time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants? I\r\nhave. When I ring once, it is for my valet; twice, for my majordomo;\r\nthrice, for my steward,—thus I do not waste a minute or a word. Here he\r\nis.”\r\n\r\nA man of about forty-five or fifty entered, exactly resembling the\r\nsmuggler who had introduced Franz into the cavern; but he did not\r\nappear to recognize him. It was evident he had his orders.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Bertuccio,” said the count, “you have procured me windows\r\nlooking on the Piazza del Popolo, as I ordered you yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, excellency,” returned the steward; “but it was very late.”\r\n\r\n“Did I not tell you I wished for one?” replied the count, frowning.\r\n\r\n“And your excellency has one, which was let to Prince Lobanieff; but I\r\nwas obliged to pay a hundred——”\r\n\r\n“That will do—that will do, Monsieur Bertuccio; spare these gentlemen\r\nall such domestic arrangements. You have the window, that is\r\nsufficient. Give orders to the coachman; and be in readiness on the\r\nstairs to conduct us to it.”\r\n\r\nThe steward bowed, and was about to quit the room.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” continued the count, “be good enough to ask Pastrini if he has\r\nreceived the _tavoletta_, and if he can send us an account of the\r\nexecution.”\r\n\r\n“There is no need to do that,” said Franz, taking out his tablets; “for\r\nI saw the account, and copied it down.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, you can retire, M. Bertuccio; I need you no longer. Let us\r\nknow when breakfast is ready. These gentlemen,” added he, turning to\r\nthe two friends, “will, I trust, do me the honor to breakfast with me?”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear count,” said Albert, “we shall abuse your kindness.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all; on the contrary, you will give me great pleasure. You\r\nwill, one or other of you, perhaps both, return it to me at Paris. M.\r\nBertuccio, lay covers for three.”\r\n\r\nHe then took Franz’s tablets out of his hand. “‘We announce,’ he read,\r\nin the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper, ‘that\r\ntoday, the 23rd of February, will be executed Andrea Rondolo, guilty of\r\nmurder on the person of the respected and venerated Don César Torlini,\r\ncanon of the church of St. John Lateran, and Peppino, called Rocca\r\nPriori, convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit Luigi Vampa,\r\nand the men of his band.’\r\n\r\n“Hum! ‘The first will be _mazzolato_, the second _decapitato_.’ Yes,”\r\ncontinued the count, “it was at first arranged in this way; but I think\r\nsince yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the\r\nceremony.”\r\n\r\n“Really?” said Franz.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I passed the evening at the Cardinal Rospigliosi’s, and there\r\nmention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men.”\r\n\r\n“For Andrea Rondolo?” asked Franz.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the count, carelessly; “for the other (he glanced at the\r\ntablets as if to recall the name), for Peppino, called Rocca Priori.\r\nYou are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined; but the _mazzolata_\r\nstill remains, which is a very curious punishment when seen for the\r\nfirst time, and even the second, while the other, as you must know, is\r\nvery simple. The _mandaïa_6 never fails, never trembles, never strikes\r\nthirty times ineffectually, like the soldier who beheaded the Count of\r\nChalais, and to whose tender mercy Richelieu had doubtless recommended\r\nthe sufferer. Ah,” added the count, in a contemptuous tone, “do not\r\ntell me of European punishments, they are in the infancy, or rather the\r\nold age, of cruelty.”\r\n\r\n“Really, count,” replied Franz, “one would think that you had studied\r\nthe different tortures of all the nations of the world.”\r\n\r\n“There are, at least, few that I have not seen,” said the count coldly.\r\n\r\n“And you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles?”\r\n\r\n“My first sentiment was horror, the second indifference, the third\r\ncuriosity.”\r\n\r\n“Curiosity—that is a terrible word.”\r\n\r\n“Why so? In life, our greatest preoccupation is death; is it not then,\r\ncurious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can\r\npart; and how, according to their different characters, temperaments,\r\nand even the different customs of their countries, different persons\r\nbear the transition from life to death, from existence to annihilation?\r\nAs for myself, I can assure you of one thing,—the more men you see die,\r\nthe easier it becomes to die yourself; and in my opinion, death may be\r\na torture, but it is not an expiation.”\r\n\r\n“I do not quite understand you,” replied Franz; “pray explain your\r\nmeaning, for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch.”\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said the count, and deep hatred mounted to his face, as the\r\nblood would to the face of any other. “If a man had by unheard-of and\r\nexcruciating tortures destroyed your father, your mother, your\r\nbetrothed,—a being who, when torn from you, left a desolation, a wound\r\nthat never closes, in your breast,—do you think the reparation that\r\nsociety gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the\r\nguillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of\r\nthe murderer, and allows him who has caused us years of moral\r\nsufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” said Franz, “that human justice is insufficient to\r\nconsole us; she can give blood in return for blood, that is all; but\r\nyou must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant.”\r\n\r\n“I will put another case to you,” continued the count; “that where\r\nsociety, attacked by the death of a person, avenges death by death. But\r\nare there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer\r\nwithout society taking the least cognizance of them, or offering him\r\neven the insufficient means of vengeance, of which we have just spoken?\r\nAre there not crimes for which the impalement of the Turks, the augers\r\nof the Persians, the stake and the brand of the Iroquois Indians, are\r\ninadequate tortures, and which are unpunished by society? Answer me, do\r\nnot these crimes exist?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Franz; “and it is to punish them that duelling is\r\ntolerated.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, duelling,” cried the count; “a pleasant manner, upon my soul, of\r\narriving at your end when that end is vengeance! A man has carried off\r\nyour mistress, a man has seduced your wife, a man has dishonored your\r\ndaughter; he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to\r\nexpect from Heaven that portion of happiness God has promised to\r\neveryone of his creatures, an existence of misery and infamy; and you\r\nthink you are avenged because you send a ball through the head, or pass\r\na sword through the breast, of that man who has planted madness in your\r\nbrain, and despair in your heart. And remember, moreover, that it is\r\noften he who comes off victorious from the strife, absolved of all\r\ncrime in the eyes of the world. No, no,” continued the count, “had I to\r\navenge myself, it is not thus I would take revenge.”\r\n\r\n“Then you disapprove of duelling? You would not fight a duel?” asked\r\nAlbert in his turn, astonished at this strange theory.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” replied the count; “understand me, I would fight a duel for\r\na trifle, for an insult, for a blow; and the more so that, thanks to my\r\nskill in all bodily exercises, and the indifference to danger I have\r\ngradually acquired, I should be almost certain to kill my man. Oh, I\r\nwould fight for such a cause; but in return for a slow, profound,\r\neternal torture, I would give back the same, were it possible; an eye\r\nfor an eye, a tooth for a tooth, as the Orientalists say,—our masters\r\nin everything,—those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a\r\nlife of dreams and a paradise of realities.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Franz to the count, “with this theory, which renders you at\r\nonce judge and executioner of your own cause, it would be difficult to\r\nadopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power\r\nof the law. Hatred is blind, rage carries you away; and he who pours\r\nout vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if he be poor and inexperienced, not if he be rich and skilful;\r\nbesides, the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of\r\nwhich we have already spoken, and which the philanthropic French\r\nRevolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken\r\non the wheel. What matters this punishment, as long as he is avenged?\r\nOn my word, I almost regret that in all probability this miserable\r\nPeppino will not be beheaded, as you might have had an opportunity then\r\nof seeing how short a time the punishment lasts, and whether it is\r\nworth even mentioning; but, really this is a most singular conversation\r\nfor the Carnival, gentlemen; how did it arise? Ah, I recollect, you\r\nasked for a place at my window; you shall have it; but let us first sit\r\ndown to table, for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast\r\nis ready.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n“_Al suo commodo!_”\r\n\r\nThe two young men arose and entered the breakfast-room.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal, which was excellent, and admirably served, Franz\r\nlooked repeatedly at Albert, in order to observe the impressions which\r\nhe doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer;\r\nbut whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little\r\nattention to him, whether the explanation of the Count of Monte Cristo\r\nwith regard to duelling had satisfied him, or whether the events which\r\nFranz knew of had had their effect on him alone, he remarked that his\r\ncompanion did not pay the least regard to them, but on the contrary ate\r\nlike a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to\r\npartake of Italian cookery—that is, the worst in the world.\r\n\r\nAs for the count, he just touched the dishes; he seemed to fulfil the\r\nduties of a host by sitting down with his guests, and awaited their\r\ndeparture to be served with some strange or more delicate food. This\r\nbrought back to Franz, in spite of himself, the recollection of the\r\nterror with which the count had inspired the Countess G——, and her firm\r\nconviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the breakfast Franz took out his watch.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the count, “what are you doing?”\r\n\r\n“You must excuse us, count,” returned Franz, “but we have still much to\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\n“What may that be?”\r\n\r\n“We have no masks, and it is absolutely necessary to procure them.”\r\n\r\n“Do not concern yourself about that; we have, I think, a private room\r\nin the Piazza del Popolo; I will have whatever costumes you choose\r\nbrought to us, and you can dress there.”\r\n\r\n“After the execution?” cried Franz.\r\n\r\n“Before or after, whichever you please.”\r\n\r\n“Opposite the scaffold?”\r\n\r\n“The scaffold forms part of the _fête_.”\r\n\r\n“Count, I have reflected on the matter,” said Franz, “I thank you for\r\nyour courtesy, but I shall content myself with accepting a place in\r\nyour carriage and at your window at the Rospoli Palace, and I leave you\r\nat liberty to dispose of my place at the Piazza del Popolo.”\r\n\r\n“But I warn you, you will lose a very curious sight,” returned the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n“You will describe it to me,” replied Franz, “and the recital from your\r\nlips will make as great an impression on me as if I had witnessed it. I\r\nhave more than once intended witnessing an execution, but I have never\r\nbeen able to make up my mind; and you, Albert?”\r\n\r\n“I,” replied the viscount,—“I saw Castaing executed, but I think I was\r\nrather intoxicated that day, for I had quitted college the same\r\nmorning, and we had passed the previous night at a tavern.”\r\n\r\n“Besides, it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at\r\nParis, that you should not see one anywhere else; when you travel, it\r\nis to see everything. Think what a figure you will make when you are\r\nasked, ‘How do they execute at Rome?’ and you reply, ‘I do not know!’\r\nAnd, besides, they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel, who\r\nkilled with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like\r\nhis own son. _Diable!_ when a churchman is killed, it should be with a\r\ndifferent weapon than a log, especially when he has behaved like a\r\nfather. If you went to Spain, would you not see the bull-fights? Well,\r\nsuppose it is a bull-fight you are going to see? Recollect the ancient\r\nRomans of the Circus, and the sports where they killed three hundred\r\nlions and a hundred men. Think of the eighty thousand applauding\r\nspectators, the sage matrons who took their daughters, and the charming\r\nVestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign\r\nthat said, ‘Come, despatch the dying.’”\r\n\r\n“Shall you go, then, Albert?” asked Franz.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, yes; like you, I hesitated, but the count’s eloquence\r\ndecides me.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go, then,” said Franz, “since you wish it; but on our way to\r\nthe Piazza del Popolo, I wish to pass through the Corso. Is this\r\npossible, count?”\r\n\r\n“On foot, yes, in a carriage, no.”\r\n\r\n“I will go on foot, then.”\r\n\r\n“Is it important that you should go that way?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there is something I wish to see.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we will go by the Corso. We will send the carriage to wait for\r\nus on the Piazza del Popolo, by the Via del Babuino, for I shall be\r\nglad to pass, myself, through the Corso, to see if some orders I have\r\ngiven have been executed.”\r\n\r\n“Excellency,” said a servant, opening the door, “a man in the dress of\r\na penitent wishes to speak to you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! yes,” returned the count, “I know who he is, gentlemen; will you\r\nreturn to the salon? you will find good cigars on the centre table. I\r\nwill be with you directly.”\r\n\r\nThe young men rose and returned into the salon, while the count, again\r\napologizing, left by another door. Albert, who was a great smoker, and\r\nwho had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars\r\nof the Café de Paris, approached the table, and uttered a cry of joy at\r\nperceiving some veritable _puros_.\r\n\r\n“Well,” asked Franz, “what think you of the Count of Monte Cristo?”\r\n\r\n“What do I think?” said Albert, evidently surprised at such a question\r\nfrom his companion; “I think he is a delightful fellow, who does the\r\nhonors of his table admirably; who has travelled much, read much, is,\r\nlike Brutus, of the Stoic school, and moreover,” added he, sending a\r\nvolume of smoke up towards the ceiling, “that he has excellent cigars.”\r\n\r\nSuch was Albert’s opinion of the count, and as Franz well knew that\r\nAlbert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection,\r\nhe made no attempt to change it.\r\n\r\n“But,” said he, “did you observe one very singular thing?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“How attentively he looked at you.”\r\n\r\n“At me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nAlbert reflected. “Ah,” replied he, sighing, “that is not very\r\nsurprising; I have been more than a year absent from Paris, and my\r\nclothes are of a most antiquated cut; the count takes me for a\r\nprovincial. The first opportunity you have, undeceive him, I beg, and\r\ntell him I am nothing of the kind.”\r\n\r\nFranz smiled; an instant after the count entered.\r\n\r\n“I am now quite at your service, gentlemen,” said he. “The carriage is\r\ngoing one way to the Piazza del Popolo, and we will go another; and, if\r\nyou please, by the Corso. Take some more of these cigars, M. de\r\nMorcerf.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart,” returned Albert; “Italian cigars are horrible.\r\nWhen you come to Paris, I will return all this.”\r\n\r\n“I will not refuse; I intend going there soon, and since you allow me,\r\nI will pay you a visit. Come, we have not any time to lose, it is\r\nhalf-past twelve—let us set off.”\r\n\r\nAll three descended; the coachman received his master’s orders, and\r\ndrove down the Via del Babuino. While the three gentlemen walked along\r\nthe Piazza di Spagna and the Via Frattina, which led directly between\r\nthe Fiano and Rospoli palaces, Franz’s attention was directed towards\r\nthe windows of that last palace, for he had not forgotten the signal\r\nagreed upon between the man in the mantle and the Transtevere peasant.\r\n\r\n“Which are your windows?” asked he of the count, with as much\r\nindifference as he could assume.\r\n\r\n“The three last,” returned he, with a negligence evidently unaffected,\r\nfor he could not imagine with what intention the question was put.\r\n\r\nFranz glanced rapidly towards the three windows. The side windows were\r\nhung with yellow damask, and the centre one with white damask and a red\r\ncross. The man in the mantle had kept his promise to the Transteverin,\r\nand there could now be no doubt that he was the count.\r\n\r\nThe three windows were still untenanted. Preparations were making on\r\nevery side; chairs were placed, scaffolds were raised, and windows were\r\nhung with flags. The masks could not appear; the carriages could not\r\nmove about; but the masks were visible behind the windows, the\r\ncarriages, and the doors.\r\n\r\nFranz, Albert, and the count continued to descend the Corso. As they\r\napproached the Piazza del Popolo, the crowd became more dense, and\r\nabove the heads of the multitude two objects were visible: the obelisk,\r\nsurmounted by a cross, which marks the centre of the square, and in\r\nfront of the obelisk, at the point where the three streets, del\r\nBabuino, del Corso, and di Ripetta, meet, the two uprights of the\r\nscaffold, between which glittered the curved knife of the _mandaïa_.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the street they met the count’s steward, who was\r\nawaiting his master. The window, let at an exorbitant price, which the\r\ncount had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests, was on the\r\nsecond floor of the great palace, situated between the Via del Babuino\r\nand the Monte Pincio. It consisted, as we have said, of a small\r\ndressing-room, opening into a bedroom, and, when the door of\r\ncommunication was shut, the inmates were quite alone. On chairs were\r\nlaid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin.\r\n\r\n20167m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“As you left the choice of your costumes to me,” said the count to the\r\ntwo friends, “I have had these brought, as they will be the most worn\r\nthis year; and they are most suitable, on account of the _confetti_\r\n(sweetmeats), as they do not show the flour.”\r\n\r\nFranz heard the words of the count but imperfectly, and he perhaps did\r\nnot fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes; for he was\r\nwholly absorbed by the spectacle that the Piazza del Popolo presented,\r\nand by the terrible instrument that was in the centre.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time Franz had ever seen a guillotine,—we say\r\nguillotine, because the Roman _mandaïa_ is formed on almost the same\r\nmodel as the French instrument.7 The knife, which is shaped like a\r\ncrescent, that cuts with the convex side, falls from a less height, and\r\nthat is all the difference.\r\n\r\nTwo men, seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid, were\r\neating their breakfasts, while waiting for the criminal. Their repast\r\nconsisted apparently of bread and sausages. One of them lifted the\r\nplank, took out a flask of wine, drank some, and then passed it to his\r\ncompanion. These two men were the executioner’s assistants.\r\n\r\nAt this sight Franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners, transported the previous evening from the Carceri Nuove\r\nto the little church of Santa Maria del Popolo, had passed the night,\r\neach accompanied by two priests, in a chapel closed by a grating,\r\nbefore which were two sentinels, who were relieved at intervals. A\r\ndouble line of carbineers, placed on each side of the door of the\r\nchurch, reached to the scaffold, and formed a circle around it, leaving\r\na path about ten feet wide, and around the guillotine a space of nearly\r\na hundred feet.\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the square was paved with heads. Many women held their\r\ninfants on their shoulders, and thus the children had the best view.\r\nThe Monte Pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators; the\r\nbalconies of the two churches at the corner of the Via del Babuino and\r\nthe Via di Ripetta were crammed; the steps even seemed a parti-colored\r\nsea, that was impelled towards the portico; every niche in the wall\r\nheld its living statue. What the count said was true—the most curious\r\nspectacle in life is that of death.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the\r\noccasion, laughter and jests arose from the crowd. It was evident that\r\nthe execution was, in the eyes of the people, only the commencement of\r\nthe Carnival.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the tumult ceased, as if by magic, and the doors of the church\r\nopened. A brotherhood of penitents, clothed from head to foot in robes\r\nof gray sackcloth, with holes for the eyes, and holding in their hands\r\nlighted tapers, appeared first; the chief marched at the head.\r\n\r\n20169m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBehind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions. He was\r\nnaked, with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which\r\nhung a large knife in a sheath, and he bore on his right shoulder a\r\nheavy iron sledge-hammer.\r\n\r\nThis man was the executioner.\r\n\r\nHe had, moreover, sandals bound on his feet by cords.\r\n\r\nBehind the executioner came, in the order in which they were to die,\r\nfirst Peppino and then Andrea. Each was accompanied by two priests.\r\nNeither had his eyes bandaged.\r\n\r\nPeppino walked with a firm step, doubtless aware of what awaited him.\r\nAndrea was supported by two priests. Each of them, from time to time,\r\nkissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them.\r\n\r\nAt this sight alone Franz felt his legs tremble under him. He looked at\r\nAlbert—he was as white as his shirt, and mechanically cast away his\r\ncigar, although he had not half smoked it. The count alone seemed\r\nunmoved—nay, more, a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale\r\ncheeks. His nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its\r\nprey, and his lips, half opened, disclosed his white teeth, small and\r\nsharp like those of a jackal. And yet his features wore an expression\r\nof smiling tenderness, such as Franz had never before witnessed in\r\nthem; his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity.\r\n\r\nHowever, the two culprits advanced, and as they approached their faces\r\nbecame visible. Peppino was a handsome young man of four or\r\nfive-and-twenty, bronzed by the sun; he carried his head erect, and\r\nseemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear.\r\nAndrea was short and fat; his visage, marked with brutal cruelty, did\r\nnot indicate age; he might be thirty. In prison he had suffered his\r\nbeard to grow; his head fell on his shoulder, his legs bent beneath\r\nhim, and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious.\r\n\r\n“I thought,” said Franz to the count, “that you told me there would be\r\nbut one execution.”\r\n\r\n“I told you true,” replied he coldly.\r\n\r\n“And yet here are two culprits.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but only one of these two is about to die; the other has many\r\nyears to live.”\r\n\r\n“If the pardon is to come, there is no time to lose.”\r\n\r\n“And see, here it is,” said the count. At the moment when Peppino\r\nreached the foot of the _mandaïa_, a priest arrived in some haste,\r\nforced his way through the soldiers, and, advancing to the chief of the\r\nbrotherhood, gave him a folded paper. The piercing eye of Peppino had\r\nnoticed all. The chief took the paper, unfolded it, and, raising his\r\nhand, “Heaven be praised, and his Holiness also,” said he in a loud\r\nvoice; “here is a pardon for one of the prisoners!”\r\n\r\n“A pardon!” cried the people with one voice; “a pardon!”\r\n\r\nAt this cry Andrea raised his head.\r\n\r\n“Pardon for whom?” cried he.\r\n\r\nPeppino remained breathless.\r\n\r\n“A pardon for Peppino, called Rocca Priori,” said the principal friar.\r\nAnd he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers, who\r\nread and returned it to him.\r\n\r\n“For Peppino!” cried Andrea, who seemed roused from the torpor in which\r\nhe had been plunged. “Why for him and not for me? We ought to die\r\ntogether. I was promised he should die with me. You have no right to\r\nput me to death alone. I will not die alone—I will not!”\r\n\r\nAnd he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast,\r\nand striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands. The\r\nexecutioner made a sign, and his two assistants leaped from the\r\nscaffold and seized him.\r\n\r\n“What is going on?” asked Franz of the count; for, as all the talk was\r\nin the Roman dialect, he had not perfectly understood it.\r\n\r\n“Do you not see?” returned the count, “that this human creature who is\r\nabout to die is furious that his fellow-sufferer does not perish with\r\nhim? and, were he able, he would rather tear him to pieces with his\r\nteeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be\r\ndeprived of. Oh, man, man—race of crocodiles,” cried the count,\r\nextending his clenched hands towards the crowd, “how well do I\r\nrecognize you there, and that at all times you are worthy of\r\nyourselves!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the\r\nground, and he kept exclaiming, “He ought to die!—he shall die!—I will\r\nnot die alone!”\r\n\r\n“Look, look,” cried the count, seizing the young men’s hands; “look,\r\nfor on my soul it is curious. Here is a man who had resigned himself to\r\nhis fate, who was going to the scaffold to die—like a coward, it is\r\ntrue, but he was about to die without resistance. Do you know what gave\r\nhim strength? do you know what consoled him? It was, that another\r\npartook of his punishment—that another partook of his anguish—that\r\nanother was to die before him! Lead two sheep to the butcher’s, two\r\noxen to the slaughterhouse, and make one of them understand that his\r\ncompanion will not die; the sheep will bleat for pleasure, the ox will\r\nbellow with joy. But man—man, whom God created in his own image—man,\r\nupon whom God has laid his first, his sole commandment, to love his\r\nneighbor—man, to whom God has given a voice to express his\r\nthoughts—what is his first cry when he hears his fellow-man is saved? A\r\nblasphemy. Honor to man, this masterpiece of nature, this king of the\r\ncreation!”\r\n\r\nAnd the count burst into a laugh; a terrible laugh, that showed he must\r\nhave suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh.\r\n\r\nHowever, the struggle still continued, and it was dreadful to witness.\r\nThe two assistants carried Andrea up to the scaffold; the people all\r\ntook part against Andrea, and twenty thousand voices cried, “Put him to\r\ndeath! put him to death!”\r\n\r\nFranz sprang back, but the count seized his arm, and held him before\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?” said he. “Do you pity him? If you heard the cry\r\nof ‘Mad dog!’ you would take your gun—you would unhesitatingly shoot\r\nthe poor beast, who, after all, was only guilty of having been bitten\r\nby another dog. And yet you pity a man who, without being bitten by one\r\nof his race, has yet murdered his benefactor; and who, now unable to\r\nkill anyone, because his hands are bound, wishes to see his companion\r\nin captivity perish. No, no—look, look!”\r\n\r\n20172m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recommendation was needless. Franz was fascinated by the horrible\r\nspectacle.\r\n\r\nThe two assistants had borne Andrea to the scaffold, and there, in\r\nspite of his struggles, his bites, and his cries, had forced him to his\r\nknees. During this time the executioner had raised his mace, and signed\r\nto them to get out of the way; the criminal strove to rise, but, ere he\r\nhad time, the mace fell on his left temple. A dull and heavy sound was\r\nheard, and the man dropped like an ox on his face, and then turned over\r\non his back.\r\n\r\nThe executioner let fall his mace, drew his knife, and with one stroke\r\nopened his throat, and mounting on his stomach, stamped violently on it\r\nwith his feet. At every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound.\r\n\r\nThis time Franz could contain himself no longer, but sank, half\r\nfainting, into a seat.\r\n\r\nAlbert, with his eyes closed, was standing grasping the\r\nwindow-curtains.\r\n\r\nThe count was erect and triumphant, like the Avenging Angel!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 36. The Carnival at Rome\r\n\r\nWhen Franz recovered his senses, he saw Albert drinking a glass of\r\nwater, of which, to judge from his pallor, he stood in great need; and\r\nthe count, who was assuming his masquerade costume. He glanced\r\nmechanically towards the piazza—the scene was wholly changed; scaffold,\r\nexecutioners, victims, all had disappeared; only the people remained,\r\nfull of noise and excitement. The bell of Monte Citorio, which only\r\nsounds on the pope’s decease and the opening of the Carnival, was\r\nringing a joyous peal.\r\n\r\n“Well,” asked he of the count, “what has, then, happened?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” replied the count; “only, as you see, the Carnival has\r\ncommenced. Make haste and dress yourself.”\r\n\r\n“In fact,” said Franz, “this horrible scene has passed away like a\r\ndream.”\r\n\r\n“It is but a dream, a nightmare, that has disturbed you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that I have suffered; but the culprit?”\r\n\r\n“That is a dream also; only he has remained asleep, while you have\r\nawakened; and who knows which of you is the most fortunate?”\r\n\r\n“But Peppino—what has become of him?”\r\n\r\n“Peppino is a lad of sense, who, unlike most men, who are happy in\r\nproportion as they are noticed, was delighted to see that the general\r\nattention was directed towards his companion. He profited by this\r\ndistraction to slip away among the crowd, without even thanking the\r\nworthy priests who accompanied him. Decidedly man is an ungrateful and\r\negotistical animal. But dress yourself; see, M. de Morcerf sets you the\r\nexample.”\r\n\r\nAlbert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and\r\nvarnished boots.\r\n\r\n“Well, Albert,” said Franz, “do you feel much inclined to join the\r\nrevels? Come, answer frankly.”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, no,” returned Albert. “But I am really glad to have seen\r\nsuch a sight; and I understand what the count said—that when you have\r\nonce habituated yourself to a similar spectacle, it is the only one\r\nthat causes you any emotion.”\r\n\r\n20175m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study\r\ncharacter,” said the count; “on the steps of the scaffold death tears\r\noff the mask that has been worn through life, and the real visage is\r\ndisclosed. It must be allowed that Andrea was not very handsome, the\r\nhideous scoundrel! Come, dress yourselves, gentlemen, dress\r\nyourselves.”\r\n\r\nFranz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions’\r\nexample. He assumed his costume, and fastened on the mask that scarcely\r\nequalled the pallor of his own face. Their toilet finished, they\r\ndescended; the carriage awaited them at the door, filled with\r\nsweetmeats and bouquets. They fell into the line of carriages.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken\r\nplace. Instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death, the Piazza\r\ndel Popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry. A\r\ncrowd of masks flowed in from all sides, emerging from the doors,\r\ndescending from the windows. From every street and every corner drove\r\ncarriages filled with clowns, harlequins, dominoes, mummers,\r\npantomimists, Transteverins, knights, and peasants, screaming,\r\nfighting, gesticulating, throwing eggs filled with flour, confetti,\r\nnosegays, attacking, with their sarcasms and their missiles, friends\r\nand foes, companions and strangers, indiscriminately, and no one took\r\noffence, or did anything but laugh.\r\n\r\nFranz and Albert were like men who, to drive away a violent sorrow,\r\nhave recourse to wine, and who, as they drink and become intoxicated,\r\nfeel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present. They saw, or\r\nrather continued to see, the image of what they had witnessed; but\r\nlittle by little the general vertigo seized them, and they felt\r\nthemselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion.\r\n\r\nA handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage, and which,\r\nwhile it covered Morcerf and his two companions with dust, pricked his\r\nneck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred\r\npins, incited him to join in the general combat, in which all the masks\r\naround him were engaged. He rose in his turn, and seizing handfuls of\r\nconfetti and sweetmeats, with which the carriage was filled, cast them\r\nwith all the force and skill he was master of.\r\n\r\n20177m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strife had fairly begun, and the recollection of what they had seen\r\nhalf an hour before was gradually effaced from the young men’s minds,\r\nso much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they\r\nnow beheld.\r\n\r\nAs for the Count of Monte Cristo, he had never for an instant shown any\r\nappearance of having been moved. Imagine the large and splendid Corso,\r\nbordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces, with their\r\nbalconies hung with carpets, and their windows with flags. At these\r\nbalconies are three hundred thousand spectators—Romans, Italians,\r\nstrangers from all parts of the world, the united aristocracy of birth,\r\nwealth, and genius. Lovely women, yielding to the influence of the\r\nscene, bend over their balconies, or lean from their windows, and\r\nshower down confetti, which are returned by bouquets; the air seems\r\ndarkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers. In the streets\r\nthe lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes—gigantic\r\ncabbages walk gravely about, buffaloes’ heads bellow from men’s\r\nshoulders, dogs walk on their hind legs; in the midst of all this a\r\nmask is lifted, and, as in Callot’s Temptation of St. Anthony, a lovely\r\nface is exhibited, which we would fain follow, but from which we are\r\nseparated by troops of fiends. This will give a faint idea of the\r\nCarnival at Rome.\r\n\r\nAt the second turn, the count stopped the carriage, and requested\r\npermission to withdraw, leaving the vehicle at their disposal. Franz\r\nlooked up—they were opposite the Rospoli Palace. At the centre window,\r\nthe one hung with white damask with a red cross, was a blue domino,\r\nbeneath which Franz’s imagination easily pictured the beautiful Greek\r\nof the Argentina.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said the count, springing out, “when you are tired of\r\nbeing actors, and wish to become spectators of this scene, you know you\r\nhave places at my windows. In the meantime, dispose of my coachman, my\r\ncarriage, and my servants.”\r\n\r\nWe have forgotten to mention, that the count’s coachman was attired in\r\na bear-skin, exactly resembling Odry’s in _The Bear and the Pasha_; and\r\nthe two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys, with spring\r\nmasks, with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed.\r\n\r\nFranz thanked the count for his attention. As for Albert, he was busily\r\noccupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of Roman peasants that\r\nwas passing near him. Unfortunately for him, the line of carriages\r\nmoved on again, and while he descended the Piazza del Popolo, the other\r\nascended towards the Palazzo di Venezia.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear fellow,” said he to Franz; “you did not see?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“There,—that calash filled with Roman peasants.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I am convinced they are all charming women.”\r\n\r\n“How unfortunate that you were masked, Albert,” said Franz; “here was\r\nan opportunity of making up for past disappointments.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” replied he, half laughing, half serious; “I hope the Carnival\r\nwill not pass without some amends in one shape or the other.”\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of Albert’s hope, the day passed unmarked by any\r\nincident, excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of\r\nRoman peasants. At one of these encounters, accidentally or purposely,\r\nAlbert’s mask fell off. He instantly rose and cast the remainder of the\r\nbouquets into the carriage. Doubtless one of the charming females\r\nAlbert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by\r\nhis gallantry; for, as the carriage of the two friends passed her, she\r\nthrew a bunch of violets. Albert seized it, and as Franz had no reason\r\nto suppose it was meant for him, he suffered Albert to retain it.\r\nAlbert placed it in his button-hole, and the carriage went triumphantly\r\non.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Franz to him; “there is the beginning of an adventure.”\r\n\r\n“Laugh if you please—I really think so. So I will not abandon this\r\nbouquet.”\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu_,” returned Franz, laughing, “in token of your ingratitude.”\r\n\r\nThe jest, however, soon appeared to become earnest; for when Albert and\r\nFranz again encountered the carriage with the _contadini_, the one who\r\nhad thrown the violets to Albert, clapped her hands when she beheld\r\nthem in his button-hole.\r\n\r\n“Bravo, bravo,” said Franz; “things go wonderfully. Shall I leave you?\r\nPerhaps you would prefer being alone?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied he; “I will not be caught like a fool at a first\r\ndisclosure by a rendezvous under the clock, as they say at the\r\nopera-balls. If the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further,\r\nwe shall find her, or rather, she will find us tomorrow; then she will\r\ngive me some sign or other, and I shall know what I have to do.”\r\n\r\n“On my word,” said Franz, “you are as wise as Nestor and prudent as\r\nUlysses, and your fair Circe must be very skilful or very powerful if\r\nshe succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind.”\r\n\r\nAlbert was right; the fair unknown had resolved, doubtless, to carry\r\nthe intrigue no farther; for although the young men made several more\r\nturns, they did not again see the calash, which had turned up one of\r\nthe neighboring streets. Then they returned to the Rospoli Palace; but\r\nthe count and the blue domino had also disappeared; the two windows,\r\nhung with yellow damask, were still occupied by the persons whom the\r\ncount had invited.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the\r\nmascherata sounded the retreat. The file on the Corso broke the line,\r\nand in a second all the carriages had disappeared. Franz and Albert\r\nwere opposite the Via delle Muratte; the coachman, without saying a\r\nword, drove up it, passed along the Piazza di Spagna and the Rospoli\r\nPalace and stopped at the door of the hotel. Signor Pastrini came to\r\nthe door to receive his guests.\r\n\r\nFranz hastened to inquire after the count, and to express regret that\r\nhe had not returned in sufficient time; but Pastrini reassured him by\r\nsaying that the Count of Monte Cristo had ordered a second carriage for\r\nhimself, and that it had gone at four o’clock to fetch him from the\r\nRospoli Palace.\r\n\r\nThe count had, moreover, charged him to offer the two friends the key\r\nof his box at the Argentina. Franz questioned Albert as to his\r\nintentions; but Albert had great projects to put into execution before\r\ngoing to the theatre; and instead of making any answer, he inquired if\r\nSignor Pastrini could procure him a tailor.\r\n\r\n“A tailor,” said the host; “and for what?”\r\n\r\n“To make us between now and tomorrow two Roman peasant costumes,”\r\nreturned Albert.\r\n\r\nThe host shook his head.\r\n\r\n“To make you two costumes between now and tomorrow? I ask your\r\nexcellencies’ pardon, but this is quite a French demand; for the next\r\nweek you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six\r\nbuttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each\r\nbutton.”\r\n\r\n“Then I must give up the idea?”\r\n\r\n“No; we have them ready-made. Leave all to me; and tomorrow, when you\r\nawake, you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be\r\nsatisfied.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Albert,” said Franz, “leave all to our host; he has already\r\nproved himself full of resources; let us dine quietly, and afterwards\r\ngo and see _l’Italienne à Alger!_\r\n\r\n“Agreed,” returned Albert; “but remember, Signor Pastrini, that both my\r\nfriend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the\r\ncostumes we have asked for.”\r\n\r\nThe host again assured them they might rely on him, and that their\r\nwishes should be attended to; upon which Franz and Albert mounted to\r\ntheir apartments, and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their\r\ncostumes. Albert, as he took off his dress, carefully preserved the\r\nbunch of violets; it was his token reserved for the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe two friends sat down to table; but they could not refrain from\r\nremarking the difference between the Count of Monte Cristo’s table and\r\nthat of Signor Pastrini. Truth compelled Franz, in spite of the dislike\r\nhe seemed to have taken to the count, to confess that the advantage was\r\nnot on Pastrini’s side. During dessert, the servant inquired at what\r\ntime they wished for the carriage. Albert and Franz looked at each\r\nother, fearing really to abuse the count’s kindness. The servant\r\nunderstood them.\r\n\r\n“His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo had,” he said, “given\r\npositive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships’\r\norders all day, and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of\r\nindiscretion.”\r\n\r\nThey resolved to profit by the count’s courtesy, and ordered the horses\r\nto be harnessed, while they substituted evening dress for that which\r\nthey had on, and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats\r\nthey had sustained.\r\n\r\n20181m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis precaution taken, they went to the theatre, and installed\r\nthemselves in the count’s box. During the first act, the Countess G——\r\nentered. Her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the\r\nprevious evening, so that she perceived Franz and Albert in the place\r\nof the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an\r\nopinion to Franz. Her opera-glass was so fixedly directed towards them,\r\nthat Franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity; and,\r\navailing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the\r\nItalian theatres, who use their boxes to hold receptions, the two\r\nfriends went to pay their respects to the countess. Scarcely had they\r\nentered, when she motioned to Franz to assume the seat of honor.\r\nAlbert, in his turn, sat behind.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said she, hardly giving Franz time to sit down, “it seems you\r\nhave nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new\r\nLord Ruthven, and you are already the best friends in the world.”\r\n\r\n“Without being so far advanced as that, my dear countess,” returned\r\nFranz, “I cannot deny that we have abused his good nature all day.”\r\n\r\n“All day?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; this morning we breakfasted with him; we rode in his carriage all\r\nday, and now we have taken possession of his box.”\r\n\r\n“You know him, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and no.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“It is a long story.”\r\n\r\n“Tell it to me.”\r\n\r\n“It would frighten you too much.”\r\n\r\n“So much the more reason.”\r\n\r\n“At least wait until the story has a conclusion.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; I prefer complete histories; but tell me how you made his\r\nacquaintance? Did anyone introduce you to him?”\r\n\r\n“No; it was he who introduced himself to us.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“Last night, after we left you.”\r\n\r\n“Through what medium?”\r\n\r\n“The very prosaic one of our landlord.”\r\n\r\n“He is staying, then, at the Hôtel de Londres with you?”\r\n\r\n“Not only in the same hotel, but on the same floor.”\r\n\r\n“What is his name; for, of course, you know?”\r\n\r\n“The Count of Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\n“That is not a family name?”\r\n\r\n“No, it is the name of the island he has purchased.”\r\n\r\n“And he is a count?”\r\n\r\n“A Tuscan count.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we must put up with that,” said the countess, who was herself\r\nfrom one of the oldest Venetian families. “What sort of a man is he?”\r\n\r\n“Ask the Vicomte de Morcerf.”\r\n\r\n“You hear, M. de Morcerf, I am referred to you,” said the countess.\r\n\r\n“We should be very hard to please, madam,” returned Albert, “did we not\r\nthink him delightful. A friend of ten years’ standing could not have\r\ndone more for us, or with a more perfect courtesy.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” observed the countess, smiling, “I see my vampire is only some\r\nmillionaire, who has taken the appearance of Lara in order to avoid\r\nbeing confounded with M. de Rothschild; and you have seen her?”\r\n\r\n“Her?”\r\n\r\n20183m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“The beautiful Greek of yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“No; we heard, I think, the sound of her _guzla_, but she remained\r\nperfectly invisible.”\r\n\r\n“When you say invisible,” interrupted Albert, “it is only to keep up\r\nthe mystery; for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with\r\nthe white curtains?”\r\n\r\n“Where was this window with white hangings?” asked the countess.\r\n\r\n“At the Rospoli Palace.”\r\n\r\n“The count had three windows at the Rospoli Palace?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Did you pass through the Corso?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask, and one with\r\nwhite damask with a red cross? Those were the count’s windows.”\r\n\r\n“Why, he must be a nabob. Do you know what those three windows were\r\nworth?”\r\n\r\n“Two or three hundred Roman crowns?”\r\n\r\n“Two or three thousand.”\r\n\r\n“The deuce!”\r\n\r\n“Does his island produce him such a revenue?”\r\n\r\n“It does not bring him a bajocco.”\r\n\r\n“Then why did he purchase it?”\r\n\r\n“For a whim.”\r\n\r\n“He is an original, then?”\r\n\r\n“In reality,” observed Albert, “he seemed to me somewhat eccentric;\r\nwere he at Paris, and a frequenter of the theatres, I should say he was\r\na poor devil literally mad. This morning he made two or three exits\r\nworthy of Didier or Anthony.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment a fresh visitor entered, and, according to custom, Franz\r\ngave up his seat to him. This circumstance had, moreover, the effect of\r\nchanging the conversation; an hour afterwards the two friends returned\r\nto their hotel.\r\n\r\nSignor Pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the\r\nmorrow; and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied. The\r\nnext morning, at nine o’clock, he entered Franz’s room, followed by a\r\ntailor, who had eight or ten Roman peasant costumes on his arm; they\r\nselected two exactly alike, and charged the tailor to sew on each of\r\ntheir hats about twenty yards of ribbon, and to procure them two of the\r\nlong silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders\r\ndecorate themselves on fête days.\r\n\r\nAlbert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress—a jacket and\r\nbreeches of blue velvet, silk stockings with clocks, shoes with\r\nbuckles, and a silk waistcoat. This picturesque attire set him off to\r\ngreat advantage; and when he had bound the scarf around his waist, and\r\nwhen his hat, placed coquettishly on one side, let fall on his shoulder\r\na stream of ribbons, Franz was forced to confess that costume has much\r\nto do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations. The\r\nTurks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes, but\r\nare they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the\r\nchin, and their red caps, which make them look like a bottle of wine\r\nwith a red seal? Franz complimented Albert, who looked at himself in\r\nthe glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction. They were thus\r\nengaged when the Count of Monte Cristo entered.\r\n\r\n20185m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said he, “although a companion is agreeable, perfect\r\nfreedom is sometimes still more agreeable. I come to say that today,\r\nand for the remainder of the Carnival, I leave the carriage entirely at\r\nyour disposal. The host will tell you I have three or four more, so\r\nthat you will not inconvenience me in any way. Make use of it, I pray\r\nyou, for your pleasure or your business.”\r\n\r\nThe young men wished to decline, but they could find no good reason for\r\nrefusing an offer which was so agreeable to them. The Count of Monte\r\nCristo remained a quarter of an hour with them, conversing on all\r\nsubjects with the greatest ease. He was, as we have already said,\r\nperfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries. A\r\nglance at the walls of his salon proved to Franz and Albert that he was\r\na connoisseur of pictures. A few words he let fall showed them that he\r\nwas no stranger to the sciences, and he seemed much occupied with\r\nchemistry. The two friends did not venture to return the count the\r\nbreakfast he had given them; it would have been too absurd to offer him\r\nin exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of Signor\r\nPastrini. They told him so frankly, and he received their excuses with\r\nthe air of a man who appreciated their delicacy. Albert was charmed\r\nwith the count’s manners, and he was only prevented from recognizing\r\nhim for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above\r\nall, for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the\r\npreceding evening, and Albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing\r\nwith them. At half-past one they descended, the coachman and footman\r\nhad put on their livery over their disguises, which gave them a more\r\nridiculous appearance than ever, and which gained them the applause of\r\nFranz and Albert. Albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his\r\nbutton-hole. At the first sound of the bell they hastened into the\r\nCorso by the Via Vittoria.\r\n\r\nAt the second turn, a bunch of fresh violets, thrown from a carriage\r\nfilled with harlequins, indicated to Albert that, like himself and his\r\nfriend, the peasants had changed their costume also; and whether it was\r\nthe result of chance, or whether a similar feeling had possessed them\r\nboth, while he had donned their costume, they had assumed his.\r\n\r\nAlbert placed the fresh bouquet in his button-hole, but he kept the\r\nfaded one in his hand; and when he again met the calash, he raised it\r\nto his lips, an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair\r\nlady who had thrown it, but her joyous companions also. The day was as\r\ngay as the preceding one, perhaps even more animated and noisy; the\r\ncount appeared for an instant at his window, but when they again passed\r\nhe had disappeared. It is almost needless to say that the flirtation\r\nbetween Albert and the fair peasant continued all day.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, on his return, Franz found a letter from the embassy,\r\ninforming him that he would have the honor of being received by his\r\nholiness the next day. At each previous visit he had made to Rome, he\r\nhad solicited and obtained the same favor; and incited as much by a\r\nreligious feeling as by gratitude, he was unwilling to quit the capital\r\nof the Christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet\r\nof one of St. Peter’s successors who has set the rare example of all\r\nthe virtues. He did not then think of the Carnival, for in spite of his\r\ncondescension and touching kindness, one cannot incline one’s self\r\nwithout awe before the venerable and noble old man called Gregory XVI.\r\n\r\nOn his return from the Vatican, Franz carefully avoided the Corso; he\r\nbrought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts, to which the mad\r\ngayety of the maskers would have been profanation.\r\n\r\nAt ten minutes past five Albert entered overjoyed. The harlequin had\r\nreassumed her peasant’s costume, and as she passed she raised her mask.\r\nShe was charming. Franz congratulated Albert, who received his\r\ncongratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited.\r\nHe had recognized by certain unmistakable signs, that his fair\r\n_incognita_ belonged to the aristocracy. He had made up his mind to\r\nwrite to her the next day.\r\n\r\nFranz remarked, while he gave these details, that Albert seemed to have\r\nsomething to ask of him, but that he was unwilling to ask it. He\r\ninsisted upon it, declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any\r\nsacrifice the other wished.\r\n\r\nAlbert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required, and\r\nthen avowed to Franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him\r\nto occupy the carriage alone the next day. Albert attributed to Franz’s\r\nabsence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask.\r\nFranz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop Albert in the middle of\r\nan adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and\r\nso flattering to his vanity. He felt assured that the perfect\r\nindiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened;\r\nand as, during three years that he had travelled all over Italy, a\r\nsimilar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share, Franz was\r\nby no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion. He therefore\r\npromised Albert that he would content himself the morrow with\r\nwitnessing the Carnival from the windows of the Rospoli Palace.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he saw Albert pass and repass, holding an enormous\r\nbouquet, which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous\r\nepistle. This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the\r\nbouquet (conspicuous by a circle of white camellias) in the hand of a\r\ncharming harlequin dressed in rose-colored satin.\r\n\r\nThe evening was no longer joy, but delirium. Albert nothing doubted but\r\nthat the fair unknown would reply in the same manner. Franz anticipated\r\nhis wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him, and that he should\r\npass the next day in writing and looking over his journal. Albert was\r\nnot deceived, for the next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantly\r\nshaking a folded paper which he held by one corner.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “was I mistaken?”\r\n\r\n“She has answered you!” cried Franz.\r\n\r\n“Read.”\r\n\r\nThis word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe. Franz took\r\nthe letter, and read:\r\n\r\n“Tuesday evening, at seven o’clock, descend from your carriage opposite\r\nthe Via dei Pontefici, and follow the Roman peasant who snatches your\r\ntorch from you. When you arrive at the first step of the church of San\r\nGiacomo, be sure to fasten a knot of rose-colored ribbons to the\r\nshoulder of your harlequin costume, in order that you may be\r\nrecognized. Until then you will not see me. —Constancy and Discretion.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” asked he, when Franz had finished, “what do you think of that?”\r\n\r\n“I think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance.”\r\n\r\n“I think so, also,” replied Albert; “and I very much fear you will go\r\nalone to the Duke of Bracciano’s ball.”\r\n\r\nFranz and Albert had received that morning an invitation from the\r\ncelebrated Roman banker.\r\n\r\n“Take care, Albert,” said Franz. “All the nobility of Rome will be\r\npresent, and if your fair _incognita_ belong to the higher class of\r\nsociety, she must go there.”\r\n\r\n“Whether she goes there or not, my opinion is still the same,” returned\r\nAlbert. “You have read the letter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You know how imperfectly the women of the _mezzo cito_ are educated in\r\nItaly?” (This is the name of the lower class.)\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, read the letter again. Look at the writing, and find if you can,\r\nany blemish in the language or orthography.” The writing was, in\r\nreality, charming, and the orthography irreproachable.\r\n\r\n“You are born to good fortune,” said Franz, as he returned the letter.\r\n\r\n“Laugh as much as you will,” replied Albert, “I am in love.”\r\n\r\n“You alarm me,” cried Franz. “I see that I shall not only go alone to\r\nthe Duke of Bracciano’s, but also return to Florence alone.”\r\n\r\n“If my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful,” said Albert, “I\r\nshall fix myself at Rome for six weeks, at least. I adore Rome, and I\r\nhave always had a great taste for archæology.”\r\n\r\n20189m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Come, two or three more such adventures, and I do not despair of\r\nseeing you a member of the Academy.”\r\n\r\nDoubtless Albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the\r\nacademic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready. Albert’s\r\nlove had not taken away his appetite. He hastened with Franz to seat\r\nhimself, free to recommence the discussion after dinner. After dinner,\r\nthe Count of Monte Cristo was announced. They had not seen him for two\r\ndays. Signor Pastrini informed them that business had called him to\r\nCivita Vecchia. He had started the previous evening, and had only\r\nreturned an hour since. He was charming. Whether he kept a watch over\r\nhimself, or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords\r\nthat in other circumstances had been touched, he was tonight like\r\neverybody else.\r\n\r\nThe man was an enigma to Franz. The count must feel sure that Franz\r\nrecognized him; and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating\r\nany previous acquaintance between them. On his side, however great\r\nFranz’s desire was to allude to their former interview, the fear of\r\nbeing disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with\r\nkindness prevented him from mentioning it.\r\n\r\nThe count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at\r\nthe Argentina Theatre, and were told they were all let. In consequence,\r\nhe brought them the key of his own—at least such was the apparent\r\nmotive of his visit. Franz and Albert made some difficulty, alleging\r\ntheir fear of depriving him of it; but the count replied that, as he\r\nwas going to the Palli Theatre, the box at the Argentina Theatre would\r\nbe lost if they did not profit by it. This assurance determined the two\r\nfriends to accept it.\r\n\r\nFranz had by degrees become accustomed to the count’s pallor, which had\r\nso forcibly struck him at their first meeting. He could not refrain\r\nfrom admiring the severe beauty of his features, the only defect, or\r\nrather the principal quality of which was the pallor. Truly, a Byronic\r\nhero! Franz could not, we will not say see him, but even think of him\r\nwithout imagining his stern head upon Manfred’s shoulders, or beneath\r\nLara’s helmet. His forehead was marked with the line that indicates the\r\nconstant presence of bitter thoughts; he had the fiery eyes that seem\r\nto penetrate to the very soul, and the haughty and disdainful upper lip\r\nthat gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses\r\nthem on the minds of those to whom they are addressed.\r\n\r\nThe count was no longer young. He was at least forty; and yet it was\r\neasy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom\r\nhe associated at present. And, to complete his resemblance with the\r\nfantastic heroes of the English poet, the count seemed to have the\r\npower of fascination. Albert was constantly expatiating on their good\r\nfortune in meeting such a man. Franz was less enthusiastic; but the\r\ncount exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always\r\nacquires over a mind less domineering. He thought several times of the\r\nproject the count had of visiting Paris; and he had no doubt but that,\r\nwith his eccentric character, his characteristic face, and his colossal\r\nfortune, he would produce a great effect there. And yet he did not wish\r\nto be at Paris when the count was there.\r\n\r\nThe evening passed as evenings mostly pass at Italian theatres; that\r\nis, not in listening to the music, but in paying visits and conversing.\r\nThe Countess G—— wished to revive the subject of the count, but Franz\r\nannounced he had something far newer to tell her, and, in spite of\r\nAlbert’s demonstrations of false modesty, he informed the countess of\r\nthe great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days. As\r\nsimilar intrigues are not uncommon in Italy, if we may credit\r\ntravellers, the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity, but\r\ncongratulated Albert on his success. They promised, upon separating, to\r\nmeet at the Duke of Bracciano’s ball, to which all Rome was invited.\r\n\r\nThe heroine of the bouquet kept her word; she gave Albert no sign of\r\nher existence the morrow or the day after.\r\n\r\nAt length Tuesday came, the last and most tumultuous day of the\r\nCarnival. On Tuesday, the theatres open at ten o’clock in the morning,\r\nas Lent begins after eight at night. On Tuesday, all those who through\r\nwant of money, time, or enthusiasm, have not been to see the Carnival\r\nbefore, mingle in the gayety, and contribute to the noise and\r\nexcitement. From two o’clock till five Franz and Albert followed in the\r\n_fête_, exchanging handfuls of _confetti_ with the other carriages and\r\nthe pedestrians, who crowded amongst the horses’ feet and the carriage\r\nwheels without a single accident, a single dispute, or a single fight.\r\n\r\nThe _fêtes_ are veritable pleasure days to the Italians. The author of\r\nthis history, who has resided five or six years in Italy, does not\r\nrecollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those\r\nevents so common in other countries. Albert was triumphant in his\r\nharlequin costume. A knot of rose-colored ribbons fell from his\r\nshoulder almost to the ground. In order that there might be no\r\nconfusion, Franz wore his peasant’s costume.\r\n\r\nAs the day advanced, the tumult became greater. There was not on the\r\npavement, in the carriages, at the windows, a single tongue that was\r\nsilent, a single arm that did not move. It was a human storm, made up\r\nof a thunder of cries, and a hail of sweetmeats, flowers, eggs,\r\noranges, and nosegays.\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock the sound of fireworks, let off on the Piazza del\r\nPopolo and the Piazza di Venezia (heard with difficulty amid the din\r\nand confusion) announced that the races were about to begin.\r\n\r\nThe races, like the _moccoli_, are one of the episodes peculiar to the\r\nlast days of the Carnival. At the sound of the fireworks the carriages\r\ninstantly broke ranks, and retired by the adjacent streets. All these\r\nevolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous\r\nrapidity, without the police interfering in the matter. The pedestrians\r\nranged themselves against the walls; then the trampling of horses and\r\nthe clashing of steel were heard. A detachment of carbineers, fifteen\r\nabreast, galloped up the Corso in order to clear it for the _barberi_.\r\nWhen the detachment arrived at the Piazza di Venezia, a second volley\r\nof fireworks was discharged, to announce that the street was clear.\r\n\r\nAlmost instantly, in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry,\r\nseven or eight horses, excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand\r\nspectators, passed by like lightning. Then the Castle of Saint Angelo\r\nfired three cannon to indicate that number three had won.\r\n\r\nImmediately, without any other signal, the carriages moved on, flowing\r\non towards the Corso, down all the streets, like torrents pent up for a\r\nwhile, which again flow into the parent river; and the immense stream\r\nagain continued its course between its two granite banks.\r\n\r\nA new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd. The sellers\r\nof _moccoletti_ entered on the scene. The _moccoli_, or _moccoletti_,\r\nare candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight,\r\nand which give to each actor in the great final scene of the Carnival\r\ntwo very serious problems to grapple with,—first, how to keep his own\r\n_moccoletto_ alight; and secondly, how to extinguish the _moccoletti_\r\nof others. The _moccoletto_ is like life: man has found but one means\r\nof transmitting it, and that one comes from God. But he has discovered\r\na thousand means of taking it away, and the devil has somewhat aided\r\nhim. The _moccoletto_ is kindled by approaching it to a light. But who\r\ncan describe the thousand means of extinguishing the _moccoletto_?—the\r\ngigantic bellows, the monstrous extinguishers, the superhuman fans.\r\nEveryone hastened to purchase _moccoletti_—Franz and Albert among the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThe night was rapidly approaching; and already, at the cry of\r\n“_Moccoletti_!” repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors,\r\ntwo or three stars began to burn among the crowd. It was a signal. At\r\nthe end of ten minutes fifty thousand lights glittered, descending from\r\nthe Palazzo di Venezia to the Piazza del Popolo, and mounting from the\r\nPiazza del Popolo to the Palazzo di Venezia. It seemed like the _fête_\r\nof Jack-o’-lanterns.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it. Suppose\r\nthat all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild\r\ndance on the face of the earth; the whole accompanied by cries that\r\nwere never heard in any other part of the world. The _facchino_ follows\r\nthe prince, the Transteverin the citizen, everyone blowing,\r\nextinguishing, relighting. Had old Æolus appeared at this moment, he\r\nwould have been proclaimed king of the _moccoli_, and Aquilo the\r\nheir-presumptive to the throne.\r\n\r\nThis battle of folly and flame continued for two hours; the Corso was\r\nlight as day; the features of the spectators on the third and fourth\r\nstories were visible.\r\n\r\nEvery five minutes Albert took out his watch; at length it pointed to\r\nseven. The two friends were in the Via dei Pontefici. Albert sprang\r\nout, bearing his _moccoletto_ in his hand. Two or three masks strove to\r\nknock his _moccoletto_ out of his hand; but Albert, a first-rate\r\npugilist, sent them rolling in the street, one after the other, and\r\ncontinued his course towards the church of San Giacomo.\r\n\r\nThe steps were crowded with masks, who strove to snatch each other’s\r\ntorches. Franz followed Albert with his eyes, and saw him mount the\r\nfirst step.\r\n\r\nInstantly a mask, wearing the well-known costume of a peasant woman,\r\nsnatched his _moccoletto_ from him without his offering any resistance.\r\nFranz was too far off to hear what they said; but, without doubt,\r\nnothing hostile passed, for he saw Albert disappear arm-in-arm with the\r\npeasant girl. He watched them pass through the crowd for some time, but\r\nat length he lost sight of them in the Via Macello.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the Carnival\r\nsounded, and at the same instant all the _moccoletti_ were extinguished\r\nas if by enchantment. It seemed as though one immense blast of the wind\r\nhad extinguished everyone.\r\n\r\nFranz found himself in utter darkness. No sound was audible save that\r\nof the carriages that were carrying the maskers home; nothing was\r\nvisible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows.\r\n\r\nThe Carnival was over.\r\n\r\n20193m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian\r\n\r\nIn his whole life, perhaps, Franz had never before experienced so\r\nsudden an impression, so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness, as\r\nin this moment. It seemed as though Rome, under the magic breath of\r\nsome demon of the night, had suddenly changed into a vast tomb. By a\r\nchance, which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness, the\r\nmoon, which was on the wane, did not rise until eleven o’clock, and the\r\nstreets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\nThe distance was short, and at the end of ten minutes his carriage, or\r\nrather the count’s, stopped before the Hôtel de Londres.\r\n\r\nDinner was waiting, but as Albert had told him that he should not\r\nreturn so soon, Franz sat down without him. Signor Pastrini, who had\r\nbeen accustomed to see them dine together, inquired into the cause of\r\nhis absence, but Franz merely replied that Albert had received on the\r\nprevious evening an invitation which he had accepted.\r\n\r\nThe sudden extinction of the _moccoletti_, the darkness which had\r\nreplaced the light, and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil,\r\nhad left in Franz’s mind a certain depression which was not free from\r\nuneasiness. He therefore dined very silently, in spite of the officious\r\nattention of his host, who presented himself two or three times to\r\ninquire if he wanted anything.\r\n\r\nFranz resolved to wait for Albert as late as possible. He ordered the\r\ncarriage, therefore, for eleven o’clock, desiring Signor Pastrini to\r\ninform him the moment that Albert returned to the hotel.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o’clock Albert had not come back. Franz dressed himself, and\r\nwent out, telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the\r\nDuke of Bracciano’s. The house of the Duke of Bracciano is one of the\r\nmost delightful in Rome, the duchess, one of the last heiresses of the\r\nColonnas, does its honors with the most consummate grace, and thus\r\ntheir _fêtes_ have a European celebrity.\r\n\r\nFranz and Albert had brought to Rome letters of introduction to them,\r\nand their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts\r\nof his travelling companion. Franz replied that he had left him at the\r\nmoment they were about to extinguish the _moccoli_, and that he had\r\nlost sight of him in the Via Macello.\r\n\r\n“Then he has not returned?” said the duke.\r\n\r\n“I waited for him until this hour,” replied Franz.\r\n\r\n“And do you know whither he went?”\r\n\r\n“No, not precisely; however, I think it was something very like a\r\nrendezvous.”\r\n\r\n“_Diavolo!_” said the duke, “this is a bad day, or rather a bad night,\r\nto be out late; is it not, countess?”\r\n\r\nThese words were addressed to the Countess G——, who had just arrived,\r\nand was leaning on the arm of Signor Torlonia, the duke’s brother.\r\n\r\n“I think, on the contrary, that it is a charming night,” replied the\r\ncountess, “and those who are here will complain of but one thing, that\r\nof its too rapid flight.”\r\n\r\n“I am not speaking,” said the duke with a smile, “of the persons who\r\nare here; the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with\r\nyou, and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely;\r\nI meant persons who were out in the streets of Rome.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” asked the countess, “who is out in the streets of Rome at this\r\nhour, unless it be to go to a ball?”\r\n\r\n“Our friend, Albert de Morcerf, countess, whom I left in pursuit of his\r\nunknown about seven o’clock this evening,” said Franz, “and whom I have\r\nnot seen since.”\r\n\r\n“And don’t you know where he is?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all.”\r\n\r\n“Is he armed?”\r\n\r\n“He is in masquerade.”\r\n\r\n“You should not have allowed him to go,” said the duke to Franz; “you,\r\nwho know Rome better than he does.”\r\n\r\n“You might as well have tried to stop number three of the _barberi_,\r\nwho gained the prize in the race today,” replied Franz; “and then\r\nmoreover, what could happen to him?”\r\n\r\n“Who can tell? The night is gloomy, and the Tiber is very near the Via\r\nMacello.” Franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that\r\nthe feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his\r\nown personal disquietude.\r\n\r\n“I informed them at the hotel that I had the honor of passing the night\r\nhere, duke,” said Franz, “and desired them to come and inform me of his\r\nreturn.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” replied the duke, “here I think, is one of my servants who is\r\nseeking you.”\r\n\r\nThe duke was not mistaken; when he saw Franz, the servant came up to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Your excellency,” he said, “the master of the Hôtel de Londres has\r\nsent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from\r\nthe Viscount of Morcerf.”\r\n\r\n“A letter from the viscount!” exclaimed Franz.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And who is the man?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“Why did he not bring it to me here?”\r\n\r\n“The messenger did not say.”\r\n\r\n“And where is the messenger?”\r\n\r\n“He went away directly he saw me enter the ball-room to find you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said the countess to Franz, “go with all speed—poor young man!\r\nPerhaps some accident has happened to him.”\r\n\r\n“I will hasten,” replied Franz.\r\n\r\n“Shall we see you again to give us any information?” inquired the\r\ncountess.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if it is not any serious affair, otherwise I cannot answer as to\r\nwhat I may do myself.”\r\n\r\n“Be prudent, in any event,” said the countess.\r\n\r\n“Oh! pray be assured of that.”\r\n\r\nFranz took his hat and went away in haste. He had sent away his\r\ncarriage with orders for it to fetch him at two o’clock; fortunately\r\nthe Palazzo Bracciano, which is on one side in the Corso, and on the\r\nother in the Square of the Holy Apostles, is hardly ten minutes’ walk\r\nfrom the Hôtel de Londres.\r\n\r\nAs he came near the hotel, Franz saw a man in the middle of the street.\r\nHe had no doubt that it was the messenger from Albert. The man was\r\nwrapped up in a large cloak. He went up to him, but, to his extreme\r\nastonishment, the stranger first addressed him.\r\n\r\n“What wants your excellency of me?” inquired the man, retreating a step\r\nor two, as if to keep on his guard.\r\n\r\n“Are not you the person who brought me a letter,” inquired Franz, “from\r\nthe Viscount of Morcerf?”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency lodges at Pastrini’s hotel?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount?”\r\n\r\n“I am.”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency’s name——”\r\n\r\n“Is the Baron Franz d’Épinay.”\r\n\r\n20199m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed.”\r\n\r\n“Is there any answer?” inquired Franz, taking the letter from him.\r\n\r\n“Yes—your friend at least hopes so.”\r\n\r\n“Come upstairs with me, and I will give it to you.”\r\n\r\n“I prefer waiting here,” said the messenger, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“And why?”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency will know when you have read the letter.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I find you here, then?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\nFranz entered the hotel. On the staircase he met Signor Pastrini.\r\n“Well?” said the landlord.\r\n\r\n“Well—what?” responded Franz.\r\n\r\n“You have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend?”\r\nhe asked of Franz.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have seen him,” he replied, “and he has handed this letter to\r\nme. Light the candles in my apartment, if you please.”\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before Franz with a light.\r\nThe young man had found Signor Pastrini looking very much alarmed, and\r\nthis had only made him the more anxious to read Albert’s letter; and so\r\nhe went instantly towards the waxlight, and unfolded it. It was written\r\nand signed by Albert. Franz read it twice before he could comprehend\r\nwhat it contained. It was thus worded:\r\n\r\n“My dear Fellow,\r\n\r\n“The moment you have received this, have the kindness to take the\r\nletter of credit from my pocket-book, which you will find in the square\r\ndrawer of the _secrétaire_; add your own to it, if it be not\r\nsufficient. Run to Torlonia, draw from him instantly four thousand\r\npiastres, and give them to the bearer. It is urgent that I should have\r\nthis money without delay. I do not say more, relying on you as you may\r\nrely on me.\r\n\r\n“Your friend,\r\n\r\n“Albert de Morcerf.\r\n\r\n“P.S.—I now believe in Italian _banditti_.”\r\n\r\nBelow these lines were written, in a strange hand, the following in\r\nItalian:\r\n\r\n“_Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie\r\nmani, alla sette il Conte Alberto avrà cessato di vivere_.\r\n\r\n“Luigi Vampa.”\r\n\r\n“_If by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my\r\nhands, by seven o’clock the Count Albert will have ceased to live_.”\r\n\r\nThis second signature explained everything to Franz, who now understood\r\nthe objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment; the\r\nstreet was safer for him. Albert, then, had fallen into the hands of\r\nthe famous bandit chief, in whose existence he had for so long a time\r\nrefused to believe.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to lose. He hastened to open the _secrétaire_, and\r\nfound the pocket-book in the drawer, and in it the letter of credit.\r\nThere were in all six thousand piastres, but of these six thousand\r\nAlbert had already expended three thousand.\r\n\r\nAs to Franz, he had no letter of credit, as he lived at Florence, and\r\nhad only come to Rome to pass seven or eight days; he had brought but a\r\nhundred louis, and of these he had not more than fifty left. Thus seven\r\nor eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum\r\nthat Albert required. True, he might in such a case rely on the\r\nkindness of Signor Torlonia. He was, therefore, about to return to the\r\nPalazzo Bracciano without loss of time, when suddenly a luminous idea\r\ncrossed his mind.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the Count of Monte Cristo. Franz was about to ring for\r\nSignor Pastrini, when that worthy presented himself.\r\n\r\n“My dear sir,” he said, hastily, “do you know if the count is within?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your excellency; he has this moment returned.”\r\n\r\n“Is he in bed?”\r\n\r\n“I should say no.”\r\n\r\n“Then ring at his door, if you please, and request him to be so kind as\r\nto give me an audience.”\r\n\r\nSignor Pastrini did as he was desired, and returning five minutes\r\nafter, he said:\r\n\r\n“The count awaits your excellency.”\r\n\r\nFranz went along the corridor, and a servant introduced him to the\r\ncount. He was in a small room which Franz had not yet seen, and which\r\nwas surrounded with divans. The count came towards him.\r\n\r\n“Well, what good wind blows you hither at this hour?” said he; “have\r\nyou come to sup with me? It would be very kind of you.”\r\n\r\n“No; I have come to speak to you of a very serious matter.”\r\n\r\n“A serious matter,” said the count, looking at Franz with the\r\nearnestness usual to him; “and what may it be?”\r\n\r\n“Are we alone?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the count, going to the door, and returning. Franz gave\r\nhim Albert’s letter.\r\n\r\n“Read that,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe count read it.\r\n\r\n“Well, well!” said he.\r\n\r\n“Did you see the postscript?”\r\n\r\n“I did, indeed.\r\n\r\n“_‘Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle\r\nmie mani, alla sette il conte Alberto avrà cessato di vivere. _\r\n\r\n“‘Luigi Vampa.’”\r\n\r\n“What think you of that?” inquired Franz.\r\n\r\n“Have you the money he demands?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, all but eight hundred piastres.”\r\n\r\nThe count went to his _secrétaire_, opened it, and pulling out a drawer\r\nfilled with gold, said to Franz, “I hope you will not offend me by\r\napplying to anyone but myself.”\r\n\r\n“You see, on the contrary, I come to you first and instantly,” replied\r\nFranz.\r\n\r\n“And I thank you; have what you will;” and he made a sign to Franz to\r\ntake what he pleased.\r\n\r\n“Is it absolutely necessary, then, to send the money to Luigi Vampa?”\r\nasked the young man, looking fixedly in his turn at the count.\r\n\r\n“Judge for yourself,” replied he. “The postscript is explicit.”\r\n\r\n“I think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting, you could\r\nfind a way of simplifying the negotiation,” said Franz.\r\n\r\n“How so?” returned the count, with surprise.\r\n\r\n“If we were to go together to Luigi Vampa, I am sure he would not\r\nrefuse you Albert’s freedom.”\r\n\r\n“What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?”\r\n\r\n“Have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten?”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“Have you not saved Peppino’s life?”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said the count, “who told you that?”\r\n\r\n“No matter; I know it.” The count knit his brows, and remained silent\r\nan instant.\r\n\r\n“And if I went to seek Vampa, would you accompany me?”\r\n\r\n“If my society would not be disagreeable.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so. It is a lovely night, and a walk without Rome will do us\r\nboth good.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I take any arms?”\r\n\r\n“For what purpose?”\r\n\r\n“Any money?”\r\n\r\n“It is useless. Where is the man who brought the letter?”\r\n\r\n“In the street.”\r\n\r\n“He awaits the answer?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I must learn where we are going. I will summon him hither.”\r\n\r\n“It is useless; he would not come up.”\r\n\r\n“To your apartments, perhaps; but he will not make any difficulty at\r\nentering mine.”\r\n\r\nThe count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the\r\nstreet, and whistled in a peculiar manner. The man in the mantle\r\nquitted the wall, and advanced into the middle of the street.\r\n“_Salite!_” said the count, in the same tone in which he would have\r\ngiven an order to his servant. The messenger obeyed without the least\r\nhesitation, but rather with alacrity, and, mounting the steps at a\r\nbound, entered the hotel; five seconds afterwards he was at the door of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n“Ah, it is you, Peppino,” said the count. But Peppino, instead of\r\nanswering, threw himself on his knees, seized the count’s hand, and\r\ncovered it with kisses. “Ah,” said the count, “you have, then, not\r\nforgotten that I saved your life; that is strange, for it is a week\r\nago.”\r\n\r\n20203m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No, excellency; and never shall I forget it,” returned Peppino, with\r\nan accent of profound gratitude.\r\n\r\n“Never? That is a long time; but it is something that you believe so.\r\nRise and answer.”\r\n\r\nPeppino glanced anxiously at Franz.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you may speak before his excellency,” said he; “he is one of my\r\nfriends. You allow me to give you this title?” continued the count in\r\nFrench, “it is necessary to excite this man’s confidence.”\r\n\r\n“You can speak before me,” said Franz; “I am a friend of the count’s.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” returned Peppino. “I am ready to answer any questions your\r\nexcellency may address to me.”\r\n\r\n“How did the Viscount Albert fall into Luigi’s hands?”\r\n\r\n“Excellency, the Frenchman’s carriage passed several times the one in\r\nwhich was Teresa.”\r\n\r\n“The chief’s mistress?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. The Frenchman threw her a bouquet; Teresa returned it—all this\r\nwith the consent of the chief, who was in the carriage.”\r\n\r\n“What?” cried Franz, “was Luigi Vampa in the carriage with the Roman\r\npeasants?”\r\n\r\n“It was he who drove, disguised as the coachman,” replied Peppino.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said the count.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, the Frenchman took off his mask; Teresa, with the chief’s\r\nconsent, did the same. The Frenchman asked for a rendezvous; Teresa\r\ngave him one—only, instead of Teresa, it was Beppo who was on the steps\r\nof the church of San Giacomo.”\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed Franz, “the peasant girl who snatched his _mocoletto_\r\nfrom him——”\r\n\r\n“Was a lad of fifteen,” replied Peppino. “But it was no disgrace to\r\nyour friend to have been deceived; Beppo has taken in plenty of\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\n“And Beppo led him outside the walls?” said the count.\r\n\r\n“Exactly so; a carriage was waiting at the end of the Via Macello.\r\nBeppo got in, inviting the Frenchman to follow him, and he did not wait\r\nto be asked twice. He gallantly offered the right-hand seat to Beppo,\r\nand sat by him. Beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a\r\nleague from Rome; the Frenchman assured him he would follow him to the\r\nend of the world. The coachman went up the Via di Ripetta and the Porta\r\nSan Paolo; and when they were two hundred yards outside, as the\r\nFrenchman became somewhat too forward, Beppo put a brace of pistols to\r\nhis head, the coachman pulled up and did the same. At the same time,\r\nfour of the band, who were concealed on the banks of the Almo,\r\nsurrounded the carriage. The Frenchman made some resistance, and nearly\r\nstrangled Beppo; but he could not resist five armed men, and was forced\r\nto yield. They made him get out, walk along the banks of the river, and\r\nthen brought him to Teresa and Luigi, who were waiting for him in the\r\ncatacombs of St. Sebastian.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the count, turning towards Franz, “it seems to me that\r\nthis is a very likely story. What do you say to it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, that I should think it very amusing,” replied Franz, “if it had\r\nhappened to anyone but poor Albert.”\r\n\r\n“And, in truth, if you had not found me here,” said the count, “it\r\nmight have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend\r\ndear; but now, be assured, his alarm will be the only serious\r\nconsequence.”\r\n\r\n“And shall we go and find him?” inquired Franz.\r\n\r\n“Oh, decidedly, sir. He is in a very picturesque place—do you know the\r\ncatacombs of St. Sebastian?”\r\n\r\n“I was never in them; but I have often resolved to visit them.”\r\n\r\n“Well, here is an opportunity made to your hand, and it would be\r\ndifficult to contrive a better. Have you a carriage?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“That is of no consequence; I always have one ready, day and night.”\r\n\r\n“Always ready?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I am a very capricious being, and I should tell you that\r\nsometimes when I rise, or after my dinner, or in the middle of the\r\nnight, I resolve on starting for some particular point, and away I go.”\r\n\r\nThe count rang, and a footman appeared.\r\n\r\n“Order out the carriage,” he said, “and remove the pistols which are in\r\nthe holsters. You need not awaken the coachman; Ali will drive.”\r\n\r\nIn a very short time the noise of wheels was heard, and the carriage\r\nstopped at the door. The count took out his watch.\r\n\r\n“Half-past twelve,” he said. “We might start at five o’clock and be in\r\ntime, but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night, and\r\ntherefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the\r\nhands of the infidels. Are you still resolved to accompany me?”\r\n\r\n“More determined than ever.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, come along.”\r\n\r\nFranz and the count went downstairs, accompanied by Peppino. At the\r\ndoor they found the carriage. Ali was on the box, in whom Franz\r\nrecognized the dumb slave of the grotto of Monte Cristo. Franz and the\r\ncount got into the carriage. Peppino placed himself beside Ali, and\r\nthey set off at a rapid pace. Ali had received his instructions, and\r\nwent down the Corso, crossed the Campo Vaccino, went up the Strada San\r\nGregorio, and reached the gates of St. Sebastian. Then the porter\r\nraised some difficulties, but the Count of Monte Cristo produced a\r\npermit from the governor of Rome, allowing him to leave or enter the\r\ncity at any hour of the day or night; the portcullis was therefore\r\nraised, the porter had a louis for his trouble, and they went on their\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient Appian Way,\r\nand bordered with tombs. From time to time, by the light of the moon,\r\nwhich began to rise, Franz imagined that he saw something like a\r\nsentinel appear at various points among the ruins, and suddenly retreat\r\ninto the darkness on a signal from Peppino.\r\n\r\nA short time before they reached the Baths of Caracalla the carriage\r\nstopped, Peppino opened the door, and the count and Franz alighted.\r\n\r\n“In ten minutes,” said the count to his companion, “we shall be there.”\r\n\r\nHe then took Peppino aside, gave him an order in a low voice, and\r\nPeppino went away, taking with him a torch, brought with them in the\r\ncarriage. Five minutes elapsed, during which Franz saw the shepherd\r\ngoing along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken\r\nsurface of the Campagna; and finally he disappeared in the midst of the\r\ntall red herbage, which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous\r\nlion.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the count, “let us follow him.”\r\n\r\nFranz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path,\r\nwhich, at the distance of a hundred paces, led them over a declivity to\r\nthe bottom of a small valley. They then perceived two men conversing in\r\nthe obscurity.\r\n\r\n“Ought we to go on?” asked Franz of the count; “or should we pause?”\r\n\r\n“Let us go on; Peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming.”\r\n\r\nOne of the two men was Peppino, and the other a bandit on the lookout.\r\nFranz and the count advanced, and the bandit saluted them.\r\n\r\n“Your excellency,” said Peppino, addressing the count, “if you will\r\nfollow me, the opening of the catacombs is close at hand.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, then,” replied the count. They came to an opening behind a\r\nclump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks, by which a man\r\ncould scarcely pass. Peppino glided first into this crevice; after they\r\ngot along a few paces the passage widened. Peppino passed, lighted his\r\ntorch, and turned to see if they came after him. The count first\r\nreached an open space and Franz followed him closely. The passageway\r\nsloped in a gentle descent, enlarging as they proceeded; still Franz\r\nand the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture, and were\r\nscarcely able to proceed abreast of one another. They went on a hundred\r\nand fifty paces in this way, and then were stopped by, “Who comes\r\nthere?” At the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a\r\ncarbine barrel.\r\n\r\n“A friend!” responded Peppino; and, advancing alone towards the sentry,\r\nhe said a few words to him in a low tone; and then he, like the first,\r\nsaluted the nocturnal visitors, making a sign that they might proceed.\r\n\r\nBehind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps. Franz and the\r\ncount descended these, and found themselves in a mortuary chamber. Five\r\ncorridors diverged like the rays of a star, and the walls, dug into\r\nniches, which were arranged one above the other in the shape of\r\ncoffins, showed that they were at last in the catacombs. Down one of\r\nthe corridors, whose extent it was impossible to determine, rays of\r\nlight were visible. The count laid his hand on Franz’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Exceedingly,” replied Franz.\r\n\r\n“Come with me, then. Peppino, put out the torch.” Peppino obeyed, and\r\nFranz and the count were in utter darkness, except that fifty paces in\r\nadvance of them a reddish glare, more evident since Peppino had put out\r\nhis torch, was visible along the wall.\r\n\r\nThey advanced silently, the count guiding Franz as if he had the\r\nsingular faculty of seeing in the dark. Franz himself, however, saw his\r\nway more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light, which\r\nserved in some manner as a guide. Three arcades were before them, and\r\nthe middle one was used as a door. These arcades opened on one side\r\ninto the corridor where the count and Franz were, and on the other into\r\na large square chamber, entirely surrounded by niches similar to those\r\nof which we have spoken.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this chamber were four stones, which had formerly\r\nserved as an altar, as was evident from the cross which still\r\nsurmounted them. A lamp, placed at the base of a pillar, lighted up\r\nwith its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented\r\nitself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow.\r\n\r\nA man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column, and was reading\r\nwith his back turned to the arcades, through the openings of which the\r\nnew-comers contemplated him. This was the chief of the band, Luigi\r\nVampa. Around him, and in groups, according to their fancy, lying in\r\ntheir mantles, or with their backs against a sort of stone bench, which\r\nwent all round the columbarium, were to be seen twenty brigands or\r\nmore, each having his carbine within reach. At the other end, silent,\r\nscarcely visible, and like a shadow, was a sentinel, who was walking up\r\nand down before a grotto, which was only distinguishable because in\r\nthat spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhen the count thought Franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque\r\ntableau, he raised his finger to his lips, to warn him to be silent,\r\nand, ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the\r\ncolumbarium, entered the chamber by the middle arcade, and advanced\r\ntowards Vampa, who was so intent on the book before him that he did not\r\nhear the noise of his footsteps.\r\n\r\n“Who comes there?” cried the sentinel, who was less abstracted, and who\r\nsaw by the lamp-light a shadow approaching his chief. At this\r\nchallenge, Vampa rose quickly, drawing at the same moment a pistol from\r\nhis girdle. In a moment all the bandits were on their feet, and twenty\r\ncarbines were levelled at the count.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he in a voice perfectly calm, and no muscle of his\r\ncountenance disturbed, “well, my dear Vampa, it appears to me that you\r\nreceive a friend with a great deal of ceremony.”\r\n\r\n20207m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ground arms,” exclaimed the chief, with an imperative sign of the\r\nhand, while with the other he took off his hat respectfully; then,\r\nturning to the singular personage who had caused this scene, he said,\r\n“Your pardon, your excellency, but I was so far from expecting the\r\nhonor of a visit, that I did not really recognize you.”\r\n\r\n“It seems that your memory is equally short in everything, Vampa,” said\r\nthe count, “and that not only do you forget people’s faces, but also\r\nthe conditions you make with them.”\r\n\r\n“What conditions have I forgotten, your excellency?” inquired the\r\nbandit, with the air of a man who, having committed an error, is\r\nanxious to repair it.\r\n\r\n“Was it not agreed,” asked the count, “that not only my person, but\r\nalso that of my friends, should be respected by you?”\r\n\r\n“And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?”\r\n\r\n“You have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the Viscount\r\nAlbert de Morcerf. Well,” continued the count, in a tone that made\r\nFranz shudder, “this young gentleman is one of _my friends_—this young\r\ngentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself—this young gentleman has\r\nbeen up and down the Corso for eight hours in my private carriage, and\r\nyet, I repeat to you, you have carried him off, and conveyed him\r\nhither, and,” added the count, taking the letter from his pocket, “you\r\nhave set a ransom on him, as if he were an utter stranger.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you not tell me all this—you?” inquired the brigand chief,\r\nturning towards his men, who all retreated before his look. “Why have\r\nyou caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the\r\ncount, who has all our lives in his hands? By heavens! if I thought one\r\nof you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency,\r\nI would blow his brains out with my own hand!”\r\n\r\n20211m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the count, turning towards Franz, “I told you there was\r\nsome mistake in this.”\r\n\r\n“Are you not alone?” asked Vampa with uneasiness.\r\n\r\n“I am with the person to whom this letter was addressed, and to whom I\r\ndesired to prove that Luigi Vampa was a man of his word. Come, your\r\nexcellency,” the count added, turning to Franz, “here is Luigi Vampa,\r\nwho will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has\r\ncommitted.”\r\n\r\nFranz approached, the chief advancing several steps to meet him.\r\n\r\n“Welcome among us, your excellency,” he said to him; “you heard what\r\nthe count just said, and also my reply; let me add that I would not for\r\nthe four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friend’s ransom,\r\nthat this had happened.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Franz, looking round him uneasily, “where is the\r\nviscount?—I do not see him.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing has happened to him, I hope,” said the count frowningly.\r\n\r\n“The prisoner is there,” replied Vampa, pointing to the hollow space in\r\nfront of which the bandit was on guard, “and I will go myself and tell\r\nhim he is free.”\r\n\r\nThe chief went towards the place he had pointed out as Albert’s prison,\r\nand Franz and the count followed him.\r\n\r\n“What is the prisoner doing?” inquired Vampa of the sentinel.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, captain,” replied the sentry, “I do not know; for the last\r\nhour I have not heard him stir.”\r\n\r\n“Come in, your excellency,” said Vampa. The count and Franz ascended\r\nseven or eight steps after the chief, who drew back a bolt and opened a\r\ndoor. Then, by the gleam of a lamp, similar to that which lighted the\r\ncolumbarium, Albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of\r\nthe bandits had lent him, lying in a corner in profound slumber.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said the count, smiling with his own peculiar smile, “not so\r\nbad for a man who is to be shot at seven o’clock tomorrow morning.”\r\n\r\nVampa looked at Albert with a kind of admiration; he was not insensible\r\nto such a proof of courage.\r\n\r\n“You are right, your excellency,” he said; “this must be one of your\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\nThen going to Albert, he touched him on the shoulder, saying, “Will\r\nyour excellency please to awaken?”\r\n\r\nAlbert stretched out his arms, rubbed his eyelids, and opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said he, “is it you, captain? You should have allowed me to\r\nsleep. I had such a delightful dream. I was dancing the galop at\r\nTorlonia’s with the Countess G——.” Then he drew his watch from his\r\npocket, that he might see how time sped.\r\n\r\n“Half-past one only?” said he. “Why the devil do you rouse me at this\r\nhour?”\r\n\r\n“To tell you that you are free, your excellency.”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” replied Albert, with perfect ease of mind, “remember,\r\nfor the future, Napoleon’s maxim, ‘Never awaken me but for bad news;’\r\nif you had let me sleep on, I should have finished my galop, and have\r\nbeen grateful to you all my life. So, then, they have paid my ransom?”\r\n\r\n“No, your excellency.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, how am I free?”\r\n\r\n“A person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand you.”\r\n\r\n“Come hither?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, hither.”\r\n\r\n“Really? Then that person is a most amiable person.”\r\n\r\nAlbert looked around and perceived Franz. “What,” said he, “is it you,\r\nmy dear Franz, whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed?”\r\n\r\n“No, not I,” replied Franz, “but our neighbor, the Count of Monte\r\nCristo.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear count,” said Albert gayly, arranging his cravat and\r\nwristbands, “you are really most kind, and I hope you will consider me\r\nas under eternal obligations to you, in the first place for the\r\ncarriage, and in the next for this visit,” and he put out his hand to\r\nthe count, who shuddered as he gave his own, but who nevertheless did\r\ngive it.\r\n\r\nThe bandit gazed on this scene with amazement; he was evidently\r\naccustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him, and yet here was\r\none whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered; as for Franz,\r\nhe was enchanted at the way in which Albert had sustained the national\r\nhonor in the presence of the bandit.\r\n\r\n“My dear Albert,” he said, “if you will make haste, we shall yet have\r\ntime to finish the night at Torlonia’s. You may conclude your\r\ninterrupted galop, so that you will owe no ill-will to Signor Luigi,\r\nwho has, indeed, throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“You are decidedly right, and we may reach the Palazzo by two o’clock.\r\nSignor Luigi,” continued Albert, “is there any formality to fulfil\r\nbefore I take leave of your excellency?”\r\n\r\n“None, sir,” replied the bandit, “you are as free as air.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, a happy and merry life to you. Come, gentlemen, come.”\r\n\r\nAnd Albert, followed by Franz and the count, descended the staircase,\r\ncrossed the square chamber, where stood all the bandits, hat in hand.\r\n\r\n“Peppino,” said the brigand chief, “give me the torch.”\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do?” inquired the count.\r\n\r\n“I will show you the way back myself,” said the captain; “that is the\r\nleast honor that I can render to your excellency.”\r\n\r\nAnd taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman, he\r\npreceded his guests, not as a servant who performs an act of civility,\r\nbut like a king who precedes ambassadors. On reaching the door, he\r\nbowed.\r\n\r\n“And now, your excellency,” added he, “allow me to repeat my apologies,\r\nand I hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred.”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear Vampa,” replied the count; “besides, you compensate for\r\nyour mistakes in so gentlemanly a way, that one almost feels obliged to\r\nyou for having committed them.”\r\n\r\n20214m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” added the chief, turning towards the young men, “perhaps\r\nthe offer may not appear very tempting to you; but if you should ever\r\nfeel inclined to pay me a second visit, wherever I may be, you shall be\r\nwelcome.”\r\n\r\nFranz and Albert bowed. The count went out first, then Albert. Franz\r\npaused for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Has your excellency anything to ask me?” said Vampa with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have,” replied Franz; “I am curious to know what work you were\r\nperusing with so much attention as we entered.”\r\n\r\n“Cæsar’s _Commentaries_,” said the bandit, “it is my favorite work.”\r\n\r\n“Well, are you coming?” asked Albert.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Franz, “here I am,” and he, in his turn, left the caves.\r\nThey advanced to the plain.\r\n\r\n“Ah, your pardon,” said Albert, turning round; “will you allow me,\r\ncaptain?”\r\n\r\nAnd he lighted his cigar at Vampa’s torch.\r\n\r\n“Now, my dear count,” he said, “let us on with all the speed we may. I\r\nam enormously anxious to finish my night at the Duke of Bracciano’s.”\r\n\r\nThey found the carriage where they had left it. The count said a word\r\nin Arabic to Ali, and the horses went on at great speed.\r\n\r\nIt was just two o’clock by Albert’s watch when the two friends entered\r\ninto the dancing-room. Their return was quite an event, but as they\r\nentered together, all uneasiness on Albert’s account ceased instantly.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said the Viscount of Morcerf, advancing towards the countess,\r\n“yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop; I am\r\nrather late in claiming this gracious promise, but here is my friend,\r\nwhose character for veracity you well know, and he will assure you the\r\ndelay arose from no fault of mine.”\r\n\r\nAnd as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz,\r\nAlbert put his arm round the waist of the countess, and disappeared\r\nwith her in the whirl of dancers.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Franz was considering the singular shudder that had\r\npassed over the Count of Monte Cristo at the moment when he had been,\r\nin some sort, forced to give his hand to Albert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 38. The Rendezvous\r\n\r\nThe first words that Albert uttered to his friend, on the following\r\nmorning, contained a request that Franz would accompany him on a visit\r\nto the count; true, the young man had warmly and energetically thanked\r\nthe count on the previous evening; but services such as he had rendered\r\ncould never be too often acknowledged. Franz, who seemed attracted by\r\nsome invisible influence towards the count, in which terror was\r\nstrangely mingled, felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to\r\nbe exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious\r\npersonage seemed to exercise over him, and therefore made no objection\r\nto Albert’s request, but at once accompanied him to the desired spot,\r\nand, after a short delay, the count joined them in the salon.\r\n\r\n“My dear count,” said Albert, advancing to meet him, “permit me to\r\nrepeat the poor thanks I offered last night, and to assure you that the\r\nremembrance of all I owe to you will never be effaced from my memory;\r\nbelieve me, as long as I live, I shall never cease to dwell with\r\ngrateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered\r\nme; and also to remember that to you I am indebted even for my life.”\r\n\r\n“My very good friend and excellent neighbor,” replied the count, with a\r\nsmile, “you really exaggerate my trifling exertions. You owe me nothing\r\nbut some trifle of 20,000 francs, which you have been saved out of your\r\ntravelling expenses, so that there is not much of a score between\r\nus;—but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and\r\nunconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate, and the\r\nperfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” said Albert, “I deserve no credit for what I could not\r\nhelp, namely, a determination to take everything as I found it, and to\r\nlet those bandits see, that although men get into troublesome scrapes\r\nall over the world, there is no nation but the French that can smile\r\neven in the face of grim Death himself. All that, however, has nothing\r\nto do with my obligations to you, and I now come to ask you whether, in\r\nmy own person, my family, or connections, I can in any way serve you?\r\nMy father, the Comte de Morcerf, although of Spanish origin, possesses\r\nconsiderable influence, both at the court of France and Madrid, and I\r\nunhesitatingly place the best services of myself, and all to whom my\r\nlife is dear, at your disposal.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur de Morcerf,” replied the count, “your offer, far from\r\nsurprising me, is precisely what I expected from you, and I accept it\r\nin the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made;—nay, I\r\nwill go still further, and say that I had previously made up my mind to\r\nask a great favor at your hands.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, pray name it.”\r\n\r\n“I am wholly a stranger to Paris—it is a city I have never yet seen.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible,” exclaimed Albert, “that you have reached your present\r\nage without visiting the finest capital in the world? I can scarcely\r\ncredit it.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, it is quite true; still, I agree with you in thinking\r\nthat my present ignorance of the first city in Europe is a reproach to\r\nme in every way, and calls for immediate correction; but, in all\r\nprobability, I should have performed so important, so necessary a duty,\r\nas that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of\r\nyour justly celebrated capital, had I known any person who would have\r\nintroduced me into the fashionable world, but unfortunately I possessed\r\nno acquaintance there, and, of necessity, was compelled to abandon the\r\nidea.”\r\n\r\n“So distinguished an individual as yourself,” cried Albert, “could\r\nscarcely have required an introduction.”\r\n\r\n“You are most kind; but as regards myself, I can find no merit I\r\npossess, save that, as a millionaire, I might have become a partner in\r\nthe speculations of M. Aguado and M. Rothschild; but as my motive in\r\ntravelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of\r\ndabbling in stocks, I stayed away till some favorable chance should\r\npresent itself of carrying my wish into execution. Your offer, however,\r\nsmooths all difficulties, and I have only to ask you, my dear M. de\r\nMorcerf” (these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile),\r\n“whether you undertake, upon my arrival in France, to open to me the\r\ndoors of that fashionable world of which I know no more than a Huron or\r\na native of Cochin-China?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that I do, and with infinite pleasure,” answered Albert; “and so\r\nmuch the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father\r\nsummons me to Paris, in consequence of a treaty of marriage (my dear\r\nFranz, do not smile, I beg of you) with a family of high standing, and\r\nconnected with the very cream of Parisian society.”\r\n\r\n“Connected by marriage, you mean,” said Franz, laughingly.\r\n\r\n“Well, never mind how it is,” answered Albert, “it comes to the same\r\nthing in the end. Perhaps by the time you return to Paris, I shall be\r\nquite a sober, staid father of a family! A most edifying representative\r\nI shall make of all the domestic virtues—don’t you think so? But as\r\nregards your wish to visit our fine city, my dear count, I can only say\r\nthat you may command me and mine to any extent you please.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is settled,” said the count, “and I give you my solemn\r\nassurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realize\r\nplans that I have long meditated.”\r\n\r\nFranz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the\r\ncount had dropped a few words in the grotto of Monte Cristo, and while\r\nthe count was speaking the young man watched him closely, hoping to\r\nread something of his purpose in his face, but his countenance was\r\ninscrutable especially when, as in the present case, it was veiled in a\r\nsphinx-like smile.\r\n\r\n“But tell me now, count,” exclaimed Albert, delighted at the idea of\r\nhaving to chaperon so distinguished a person as Monte Cristo; “tell me\r\ntruly whether you are in earnest, or if this project of visiting Paris\r\nis merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we\r\nmake so many in the course of our lives, but which, like a house built\r\non the sand, is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind?”\r\n\r\n“I pledge you my honor,” returned the count, “that I mean to do as I\r\nhave said; both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit\r\nParis.”\r\n\r\n“When do you propose going thither?”\r\n\r\n“Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I have; in a fortnight or three weeks’ time, that is to say,\r\nas fast as I can get there!”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said the Count; “I will give you three months ere I join you;\r\nyou see I make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties.\r\n\r\n“And in three months’ time,” said Albert, “you will be at my house?”\r\n\r\n“Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour?”\r\ninquired the count; “only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my\r\npunctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements.”\r\n\r\n“Day for day, hour for hour,” said Albert; “that will suit me to a\r\ndot.”\r\n\r\n“So be it, then,” replied the count, and extending his hand towards a\r\ncalendar, suspended near the chimney-piece, he said, “today is the 21st\r\nof February;” and drawing out his watch, added, “it is exactly\r\nhalf-past ten o’clock. Now promise me to remember this, and expect me\r\nthe 21st of May at the same hour in the forenoon.”\r\n\r\n“Capital!” exclaimed Albert; “your breakfast shall be waiting.”\r\n\r\n“Where do you live?”\r\n\r\n“No. 27, Rue du Helder.”\r\n\r\n“Have you bachelor’s apartments there? I hope my coming will not put\r\nyou to any inconvenience.”\r\n\r\n“I reside in my father’s house, but occupy a pavilion at the farther\r\nside of the courtyard, entirely separated from the main building.”\r\n\r\n“Quite sufficient,” replied the count, as, taking out his tablets, he\r\nwrote down “No. 27, Rue du Helder, 21st May, half-past ten in the\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\n“Now then,” said the count, returning his tablets to his pocket, “make\r\nyourself perfectly easy; the hand of your time-piece will not be more\r\naccurate in marking the time than myself.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I see you again ere my departure?” asked Albert.\r\n\r\n“That depends; when do you leave?”\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow evening, at five o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“In that case I must say adieu to you, as I am compelled to go to\r\nNaples, and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday\r\nmorning. And you, baron,” pursued the count, addressing Franz, “do you\r\nalso depart tomorrow?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“For France?”\r\n\r\n“No, for Venice; I shall remain in Italy for another year or two.”\r\n\r\n“Then we shall not meet in Paris?”\r\n\r\n“I fear I shall not have that honor.”\r\n\r\n“Well, since we must part,” said the count, holding out a hand to each\r\nof the young men, “allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant\r\njourney.”\r\n\r\nIt was the first time the hand of Franz had come in contact with that\r\nof the mysterious individual before him, and unconsciously he shuddered\r\nat its touch, for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse.\r\n\r\n20219m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Let us understand each other,” said Albert; “it is agreed—is it\r\nnot?—that you are to be at No. 27, in the Rue du Helder, on the 21st of\r\nMay, at half-past ten in the morning, and your word of honor passed for\r\nyour punctuality?”\r\n\r\n“The 21st of May, at half-past ten in the morning, Rue du Helder, No.\r\n27,” replied the count.\r\n\r\nThe young men then rose, and bowing to the count, quitted the room.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” asked Albert of Franz, when they had returned to\r\ntheir own apartments; “you seem more than commonly thoughtful.”\r\n\r\n“I will confess to you, Albert,” replied Franz, “the count is a very\r\nsingular person, and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris\r\nfills me with a thousand apprehensions.”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” exclaimed Albert, “what can there possibly be in that\r\nto excite uneasiness? Why, you must have lost your senses.”\r\n\r\n“Whether I am in my senses or not,” answered Franz, “that is the way I\r\nfeel.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, Franz,” said Albert; “I am glad that the occasion has\r\npresented itself for saying this to you, for I have noticed how cold\r\nyou are in your bearing towards the count, while he, on the other hand,\r\nhas always been courtesy itself to us. Have you anything particular\r\nagainst him?”\r\n\r\n“Possibly.”\r\n\r\n“Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?”\r\n\r\n“I have.”\r\n\r\n“And where?”\r\n\r\n“Will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what I am about to\r\ntell you?”\r\n\r\n“I promise.”\r\n\r\n“Upon your honor?”\r\n\r\n“Upon my honor.”\r\n\r\n“Then listen to me.”\r\n\r\nFranz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the\r\nIsland of Monte Cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there,\r\nand the two Corsican bandits with them. He dwelt with considerable\r\nforce and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from\r\nthe count, and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of\r\nthe _Thousand and One Nights_.\r\n\r\nHe recounted, with circumstantial exactitude, all the particulars of\r\nthe supper, the hashish, the statues, the dream, and how, at his\r\nawakening, there remained no proof or trace of all these events, save\r\nthe small yacht, seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail\r\ntoward Porto-Vecchio.\r\n\r\nThen he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the Colosseum,\r\nbetween the count and Vampa, in which the count had promised to obtain\r\nthe release of the bandit Peppino,—an engagement which, as our readers\r\nare aware, he most faithfully fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAt last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night, and the\r\nembarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient\r\ncash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required, and\r\nfinally of his application to the count and the picturesque and\r\nsatisfactory result that followed. Albert listened with the most\r\nprofound attention.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, when Franz had concluded, “what do you find to object\r\nto in all you have related? The count is fond of travelling, and, being\r\nrich, possesses a vessel of his own. Go but to Portsmouth or\r\nSouthampton, and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts\r\nbelonging to such of the English as can afford the expense, and have\r\nthe same liking for this amusement. Now, by way of having a\r\nresting-place during his excursions, avoiding the wretched\r\ncookery—which has been trying its best to poison me during the last\r\nfour months, while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many\r\nyears,—and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber, Monte\r\nCristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first\r\nfound him; but, to prevent the possibility of the Tuscan government\r\ntaking a fancy to his enchanted palace, and thereby depriving him of\r\nthe advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital,\r\nhe has wisely enough purchased the island, and taken its name. Just ask\r\nyourself, my good fellow, whether there are not many persons of our\r\nacquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never in\r\ntheir lives were masters of?”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Franz, “the Corsican bandits that were among the crew of\r\nhis vessel?”\r\n\r\n“Why, really the thing seems to me simple enough. Nobody knows better\r\nthan yourself that the bandits of Corsica are not rogues or thieves,\r\nbut purely and simply fugitives, driven by some sinister motive from\r\ntheir native town or village, and that their fellowship involves no\r\ndisgrace or stigma; for my own part, I protest that, should I ever go\r\nto Corsica, my first visit, ere even I presented myself to the mayor or\r\nprefect, should be to the bandits of Colomba, if I could only manage to\r\nfind them; for, on my conscience, they are a race of men I admire\r\ngreatly.”\r\n\r\n“Still,” persisted Franz, “I suppose you will allow that such men as\r\nVampa and his band are regular villains, who have no other motive than\r\nplunder when they seize your person. How do you explain the influence\r\nthe count evidently possessed over those ruffians?”\r\n\r\n“My good friend, as in all probability I own my present safety to that\r\ninfluence, it would ill become me to search too closely into its\r\nsource; therefore, instead of condemning him for his intimacy with\r\noutlaws, you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there\r\nmay be in such a connection; not altogether for preserving my life, for\r\nmy own idea was that it never was in much danger, but certainly for\r\nsaving me 4,000 piastres, which, being translated, means neither more\r\nnor less than 24,000 livres of our money—a sum at which, most\r\nassuredly, I should never have been estimated in France, proving most\r\nindisputably,” added Albert with a laugh, “that no prophet is honored\r\nin his own country.”\r\n\r\n“Talking of countries,” replied Franz, “of what country is the count,\r\nwhat is his native tongue, whence does he derive his immense fortune,\r\nand what were those events of his early life—a life as marvellous as\r\nunknown—that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and\r\ngloomy a misanthropy? Certainly these are questions that, in your\r\nplace, I should like to have answered.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Franz,” replied Albert, “when, upon receipt of my letter, you\r\nfound the necessity of asking the count’s assistance, you promptly went\r\nto him, saying, ‘My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger; help me to\r\ndeliver him.’ Was not that nearly what you said?”\r\n\r\n20222m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It was.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, did he ask you, ‘Who is M. Albert de Morcerf? how does he\r\ncome by his name—his fortune? what are his means of existence? what is\r\nhis birthplace? of what country is he a native?’ Tell me, did he put\r\nall these questions to you?”\r\n\r\n“I confess he asked me none.”\r\n\r\n“No; he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa, where,\r\nI can assure you, in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and\r\nunconcern, I did not very particularly care to remain. Now, then,\r\nFranz, when, for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered, he\r\nbut asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any Russian\r\nprince or Italian nobleman who may pass through Paris—merely to\r\nintroduce him into society—would you have me refuse? My good fellow,\r\nyou must have lost your senses to think it possible I could act with\r\nsuch cold-blooded policy.”\r\n\r\nAnd this time it must be confessed that, contrary to the usual state of\r\naffairs in discussions between the young men, the effective arguments\r\nwere all on Albert’s side.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Franz with a sigh, “do as you please my dear viscount, for\r\nyour arguments are beyond my powers of refutation. Still, in spite of\r\nall, you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular\r\npersonage.”\r\n\r\n“He is a philanthropist,” answered the other; “and no doubt his motive\r\nin visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize, given, as you\r\nare aware, to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced\r\nthe interests of virtue and humanity. If my vote and interest can\r\nobtain it for him, I will readily give him the one and promise the\r\nother. And now, my dear Franz, let us talk of something else. Come,\r\nshall we take our luncheon, and then pay a last visit to St. Peter’s?”\r\n\r\nFranz silently assented; and the following afternoon, at half-past five\r\no’clock, the young men parted. Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris,\r\nand Franz d’Épinay to pass a fortnight at Venice.\r\n\r\nBut, ere he entered his travelling carriage, Albert, fearing that his\r\nexpected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into, placed\r\nin the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the\r\nCount of Monte Cristo, on which, beneath the name of Viscount Albert de\r\nMorcerf, he had written in pencil:\r\n\r\n“27, _Rue du Helder, on the_ 21_st May, half-past ten_ A.M.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 39. The Guests\r\n\r\nIn the house in the Rue du Helder, where Albert had invited the Count\r\nof Monte Cristo, everything was being prepared on the morning of the\r\n21st of May to do honor to the occasion. Albert de Morcerf inhabited a\r\npavilion situated at the corner of a large court, and directly opposite\r\nanother building, in which were the servants’ apartments. Two windows\r\nonly of the pavilion faced the street; three other windows looked into\r\nthe court, and two at the back into the garden.\r\n\r\nBetween the court and the garden, built in the heavy style of the\r\nimperial architecture, was the large and fashionable dwelling of the\r\nCount and Countess of Morcerf.\r\n\r\nA high wall surrounded the whole of the property, surmounted at\r\nintervals by vases filled with flowers, and broken in the centre by a\r\nlarge gate of gilded iron, which served as the carriage entrance. A\r\nsmall door, close to the lodge of the _concierge_, gave ingress and\r\negress to the servants and masters when they were on foot.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother, unwilling\r\nto part from her son, and yet aware that a young man of the viscount’s\r\nage required the full exercise of his liberty, had chosen this\r\nhabitation for Albert. There were not lacking, however, evidences of\r\nwhat we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with\r\nthe indolent, careless life of an only son, and who lives as it were in\r\na gilded cage. By means of the two windows looking into the street,\r\nAlbert could see all that passed; the sight of what is going on is\r\nnecessary to young men, who always want to see the world traverse their\r\nhorizon, even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare. Then,\r\nshould anything appear to merit a more minute examination, Albert de\r\nMorcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate,\r\nsimilar to that close to the _concierge’s_ door, and which merits a\r\nparticular description.\r\n\r\nIt was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since\r\nthe house was built, so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt; but\r\nthe well-oiled hinges and locks told quite another story. This door was\r\na mockery to the _concierge_, from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it\r\nwas free, and, like that famous portal in the _Arabian Nights_, opening\r\nat the “_Sesame_” of Ali Baba, it was wont to swing backward at a\r\ncabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest\r\nvoices or whitest fingers in the world.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a long corridor, with which the door communicated, and\r\nwhich formed the antechamber, was, on the right, Albert’s\r\nbreakfast-room, looking into the court, and on the left the salon,\r\nlooking into the garden. Shrubs and creeping plants covered the\r\nwindows, and hid from the garden and court these two apartments, the\r\nonly rooms into which, as they were on the ground floor, the prying\r\neyes of the curious could penetrate.\r\n\r\nOn the floor above were similar rooms, with the addition of a third,\r\nformed out of the antechamber; these three rooms were a salon, a\r\nboudoir, and a bedroom. The salon downstairs was only an Algerian\r\ndivan, for the use of smokers. The boudoir upstairs communicated with\r\nthe bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase; it was evident\r\nthat every precaution had been taken. Above this floor was a large\r\n_atelier_, which had been increased in size by pulling down the\r\npartitions—a pandemonium, in which the artist and the dandy strove for\r\npre-eminence.\r\n\r\nThere were collected and piled up all Albert’s successive caprices,\r\nhunting-horns, bass-viols, flutes—a whole orchestra, for Albert had had\r\nnot a taste but a fancy for music; easels, palettes, brushes,\r\npencils—for music had been succeeded by painting; foils, boxing-gloves,\r\nbroadswords, and single-sticks—for, following the example of the\r\nfashionable young men of the time, Albert de Morcerf cultivated, with\r\nfar more perseverance than music and drawing, the three arts that\r\ncomplete a dandy’s education, i.e., fencing, boxing, and single-stick;\r\nand it was here that he received Grisier, Cooks, and Charles Leboucher.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old\r\ncabinets, filled with Chinese porcelain and Japanese vases, Lucca della\r\nRobbia _faïences_, and Palissy platters; of old armchairs, in which\r\nperhaps had sat Henry IV. or Sully, Louis XIII. or Richelieu—for two of\r\nthese armchairs, adorned with a carved shield, on which were engraved\r\nthe fleur-de-lis of France on an azure field, evidently came from the\r\nLouvre, or, at least, some royal residence.\r\n\r\nOver these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs, dyed\r\nbeneath Persia’s sun, or woven by the fingers of the women of Calcutta\r\nor of Chandernagor. What these stuffs did there, it was impossible to\r\nsay; they awaited, while gratifying the eyes, a destination unknown to\r\ntheir owner himself; in the meantime they filled the place with their\r\ngolden and silky reflections.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the room was a Roller and Blanchet “baby grand” piano\r\nin rosewood, but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its\r\nnarrow and sonorous cavity, and groaning beneath the weight of the\r\n_chefs-d’œuvre_ of Beethoven, Weber, Mozart, Haydn, Grétry, and\r\nPorpora.\r\n\r\nOn the walls, over the doors, on the ceiling, were swords, daggers,\r\nMalay creeses, maces, battle-axes; gilded, damasked, and inlaid suits\r\nof armor; dried plants, minerals, and stuffed birds, their\r\nflame-colored wings outspread in motionless flight, and their beaks\r\nforever open. This was Albert’s favorite lounging place.\r\n\r\nHowever, the morning of the appointment, the young man had established\r\nhimself in the small salon downstairs. There, on a table, surrounded at\r\nsome distance by a large and luxurious divan, every species of tobacco\r\nknown,—from the yellow tobacco of Petersburg to the black of Sinai, and\r\nso on along the scale from Maryland and Porto Rico, to Latakia,—was\r\nexposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the Dutch are so fond;\r\nbeside them, in boxes of fragrant wood, were ranged, according to their\r\nsize and quality, puros, regalias, havanas, and manillas; and, in an\r\nopen cabinet, a collection of German pipes, of chibouques, with their\r\namber mouth-pieces ornamented with coral, and of narghiles, with their\r\nlong tubes of morocco, awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the\r\nsmokers.\r\n\r\nAlbert had himself presided at the arrangement, or, rather, the\r\nsymmetrical derangement, which, after coffee, the guests at a breakfast\r\nof modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from\r\ntheir mouths, and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter to ten, a valet entered; he composed, with a little groom\r\nnamed John, and who only spoke English, all Albert’s establishment,\r\nalthough the cook of the hotel was always at his service, and on great\r\noccasions the count’s _chasseur_ also. This valet, whose name was\r\nGermain, and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master,\r\nheld in one hand a number of papers, and in the other a packet of\r\nletters, which he gave to Albert. Albert glanced carelessly at the\r\ndifferent missives, selected two written in a small and delicate hand,\r\nand enclosed in scented envelopes, opened them and perused their\r\ncontents with some attention.\r\n\r\n“How did these letters come?” said he.\r\n\r\n“One by the post, Madame Danglars’ footman left the other.”\r\n\r\n“Let Madame Danglars know that I accept the place she offers me in her\r\nbox. Wait; then, during the day, tell Rosa that when I leave the Opera\r\nI will sup with her as she wishes. Take her six bottles of different\r\nwine—Cyprus, sherry, and Malaga, and a barrel of Ostend oysters; get\r\nthem at Borel’s, and be sure you say they are for me.”\r\n\r\n“At what o’clock, sir, do you breakfast?”\r\n\r\n20227m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What time is it now?”\r\n\r\n“A quarter to ten.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, at half past ten. Debray will, perhaps, be obliged to go to\r\nthe minister—and besides” (Albert looked at his tablets), “it is the\r\nhour I told the count, 21st May, at half past ten; and though I do not\r\nmuch rely upon his promise, I wish to be punctual. Is the countess up\r\nyet?”\r\n\r\n“If you wish, I will inquire.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, ask her for one of her _liqueur_ cellarets, mine is incomplete;\r\nand tell her I shall have the honor of seeing her about three o’clock,\r\nand that I request permission to introduce someone to her.”\r\n\r\nThe valet left the room. Albert threw himself on the divan, tore off\r\nthe cover of two or three of the papers, looked at the theatre\r\nannouncements, made a face seeing they gave an opera, and not a ballet;\r\nhunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth-powder of\r\nwhich he had heard, and threw down, one after the other, the three\r\nleading papers of Paris, muttering,\r\n\r\n“These papers become more and more stupid every day.”\r\n\r\nA moment after, a carriage stopped before the door, and the servant\r\nannounced M. Lucien Debray. A tall young man, with light hair, clear\r\ngray eyes, and thin and compressed lips, dressed in a blue coat with\r\nbeautifully carved gold buttons, a white neckcloth, and a tortoiseshell\r\neye-glass suspended by a silken thread, and which, by an effort of the\r\nsuperciliary and zygomatic muscles, he fixed in his eye, entered, with\r\na half-official air, without smiling or speaking.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, Lucien, good-morning,” said Albert; “your punctuality\r\nreally alarms me. What do I say? punctuality! You, whom I expected\r\nlast, you arrive at five minutes to ten, when the time fixed was\r\nhalf-past! Has the ministry resigned?”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear fellow,” returned the young man, seating himself on the\r\ndivan; “reassure yourself; we are tottering always, but we never fall,\r\nand I begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility,\r\nand then the affairs of the Peninsula will completely consolidate us.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, true; you drive Don Carlos out of Spain.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans. We take him to the\r\nother side of the French frontier, and offer him hospitality at\r\nBourges.”\r\n\r\n“At Bourges?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he has not much to complain of; Bourges is the capital of Charles\r\nVII. Do you not know that all Paris knew it yesterday, and the day\r\nbefore it had already transpired on the Bourse, and M. Danglars (I do\r\nnot know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as\r\nsoon as we do) made a million!”\r\n\r\n“And you another order, for I see you have a blue ribbon at your\r\nbutton-hole.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; they sent me the order of Charles III.,” returned Debray\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\n“Come, do not affect indifference, but confess you were pleased to have\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is very well as a finish to the toilet. It looks very neat on a\r\nblack coat buttoned up.”\r\n\r\n“And makes you resemble the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Reichstadt.”\r\n\r\n“It is for that reason you see me so early.”\r\n\r\n“Because you have the order of Charles III., and you wish to announce\r\nthe good news to me?”\r\n\r\n“No, because I passed the night writing letters,—five-and-twenty\r\ndespatches. I returned home at daybreak, and strove to sleep; but my\r\nhead ached and I got up to have a ride for an hour. At the Bois de\r\nBoulogne, _ennui_ and hunger attacked me at once,—two enemies who\r\nrarely accompany each other, and who are yet leagued against me, a sort\r\nof Carlo-republican alliance. I then recollected you gave a breakfast\r\nthis morning, and here I am. I am hungry, feed me; I am bored, amuse\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“It is my duty as your host,” returned Albert, ringing the bell, while\r\nLucien turned over, with his gold-mounted cane, the papers that lay on\r\nthe table. “Germain, a glass of sherry and a biscuit. In the meantime,\r\nmy dear Lucien, here are cigars—contraband, of course—try them, and\r\npersuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with\r\ncabbage leaves.”\r\n\r\n“_Peste!_ I will do nothing of the kind; the moment they come from\r\ngovernment you would find them execrable. Besides, that does not\r\nconcern the home but the financial department. Address yourself to M.\r\nHumann, section of the indirect contributions, corridor A., No. 26.”\r\n\r\n“On my word,” said Albert, “you astonish me by the extent of your\r\nknowledge. Take a cigar.”\r\n\r\n“Really, my dear Albert,” replied Lucien, lighting a manilla at a\r\nrose-colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled stand—“how\r\nhappy you are to have nothing to do. You do not know your own good\r\nfortune!”\r\n\r\n“And what would you do, my dear diplomatist,” replied Morcerf, with a\r\nslight degree of irony in his voice, “if you did nothing? What? private\r\nsecretary to a minister, plunged at once into European cabals and\r\nParisian intrigues; having kings, and, better still, queens, to\r\nprotect, parties to unite, elections to direct; making more use of your\r\ncabinet with your pen and your telegraph than Napoleon did of his\r\nbattle-fields with his sword and his victories; possessing\r\nfive-and-twenty thousand francs a year, besides your place; a horse,\r\nfor which Château-Renaud offered you four hundred louis, and which you\r\nwould not part with; a tailor who never disappoints you; with the\r\nopera, the jockey-club, and other diversions, can you not amuse\r\nyourself? Well, I will amuse you.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“By introducing to you a new acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n“A man or a woman?”\r\n\r\n“A man.”\r\n\r\n“I know so many men already.”\r\n\r\n“But you do not know this man.”\r\n\r\n“Where does he come from—the end of the world?”\r\n\r\n“Farther still, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“The deuce! I hope he does not bring our breakfast with him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; our breakfast comes from my father’s kitchen. Are you hungry?”\r\n\r\n“Humiliating as such a confession is, I am. But I dined at M. de\r\nVillefort’s, and lawyers always give you very bad dinners. You would\r\nthink they felt some remorse; did you ever remark that?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, depreciate other persons’ dinners; you ministers give such\r\nsplendid ones.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but we do not invite people of fashion. If we were not forced to\r\nentertain a parcel of country boobies because they think and vote with\r\nus, we should never dream of dining at home, I assure you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, take another glass of sherry and another biscuit.”\r\n\r\n“Willingly. Your Spanish wine is excellent. You see we were quite right\r\nto pacify that country.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but Don Carlos?”\r\n\r\n“Well, Don Carlos will drink Bordeaux, and in ten years we will marry\r\nhis son to the little queen.”\r\n\r\n“You will then obtain the Golden Fleece, if you are still in the\r\nministry.”\r\n\r\n“I think, Albert, you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke\r\nthis morning.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach; but I hear\r\nBeauchamp in the next room; you can dispute together, and that will\r\npass away the time.”\r\n\r\n“About what?”\r\n\r\n“About the papers.”\r\n\r\n“My dear friend,” said Lucien with an air of sovereign contempt, “do I\r\never read the papers?”\r\n\r\n“Then you will dispute the more.”\r\n\r\n“M. Beauchamp,” announced the servant. “Come in, come in,” said Albert,\r\nrising and advancing to meet the young man. “Here is Debray, who\r\ndetests you without reading you, so he says.”\r\n\r\n“He is quite right,” returned Beauchamp; “for I criticise him without\r\nknowing what he does. Good-day, commander!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you know that already,” said the private secretary, smiling and\r\nshaking hands with him.\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_”\r\n\r\n“And what do they say of it in the world?”\r\n\r\n“In which world? we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838.”\r\n\r\n“In the entire political world, of which you are one of the leaders.”\r\n\r\n“They say that it is quite fair, and that sowing so much red, you ought\r\nto reap a little blue.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, that is not bad!” said Lucien. “Why do you not join our\r\nparty, my dear Beauchamp? With your talents you would make your fortune\r\nin three or four years.”\r\n\r\n“I only await one thing before following your advice; that is, a\r\nminister who will hold office for six months. My dear Albert, one word,\r\nfor I must give poor Lucien a respite. Do we breakfast or dine? I must\r\ngo to the Chamber, for our life is not an idle one.”\r\n\r\n“You only breakfast; I await two persons, and the instant they arrive\r\nwe shall sit down to table.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 40. The Breakfast\r\n\r\nAnd what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast?” said Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“A gentleman, and a diplomatist.”\r\n\r\n“Then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman, and three for\r\nthe diplomatist. I shall come back to dessert; keep me some\r\nstrawberries, coffee, and cigars. I shall take a cutlet on my way to\r\nthe Chamber.”\r\n\r\n“Do not do anything of the sort; for were the gentleman a Montmorency,\r\nand the diplomatist a Metternich, we will breakfast at eleven; in the\r\nmeantime, follow Debray’s example, and take a glass of sherry and a\r\nbiscuit.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so; I will stay; I must do something to distract my thoughts.”\r\n\r\n“You are like Debray, and yet it seems to me that when the minister is\r\nout of spirits, the opposition ought to be joyous.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you do not know with what I am threatened. I shall hear this\r\nmorning that M. Danglars make a speech at the Chamber of Deputies, and\r\nat his wife’s this evening I shall hear the tragedy of a peer of\r\nFrance. The devil take the constitutional government, and since we had\r\nour choice, as they say, at least, how could we choose that?”\r\n\r\n“I understand; you must lay in a stock of hilarity.”\r\n\r\n“Do not run down M. Danglars’ speeches,” said Debray; “he votes for\r\nyou, for he belongs to the opposition.”\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu_, that is exactly the worst of all. I am waiting until you\r\nsend him to speak at the Luxembourg, to laugh at my ease.”\r\n\r\n“My dear friend,” said Albert to Beauchamp, “it is plain that the\r\naffairs of Spain are settled, for you are most desperately out of humor\r\nthis morning. Recollect that Parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage\r\nbetween myself and Mlle. Eugénie Danglars; I cannot in conscience,\r\ntherefore, let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say\r\nto me, ‘Vicomte, you know I give my daughter two millions.’”\r\n\r\n“Ah, this marriage will never take place,” said Beauchamp. “The king\r\nhas made him a baron, and can make him a peer, but he cannot make him a\r\ngentleman, and the Count of Morcerf is too aristocratic to consent, for\r\nthe paltry sum of two million francs, to a _mésalliance_. The Viscount\r\nof Morcerf can only wed a marchioness.”\r\n\r\n“But two million francs make a nice little sum,” replied Morcerf.\r\n\r\n“It is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard, or a railroad\r\nfrom the Jardin des Plantes to La Râpée.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind what he says, Morcerf,” said Debray, “do you marry her. You\r\nmarry a money-bag label, it is true; well, but what does that matter?\r\nIt is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it. You have\r\nseven martlets on your arms; give three to your wife, and you will\r\nstill have four; that is one more than M. de Guise had, who so nearly\r\nbecame King of France, and whose cousin was Emperor of Germany.”\r\n\r\n“On my word, I think you are right, Lucien,” said Albert absently.\r\n\r\n“To be sure; besides, every millionaire is as noble as a bastard—that\r\nis, he can be.”\r\n\r\n“Do not say that, Debray,” returned Beauchamp, laughing, “for here is\r\nChâteau-Renaud, who, to cure you of your mania for paradoxes, will pass\r\nthe sword of Renaud de Montauban, his ancestor, through your body.”\r\n\r\n“He will sully it then,” returned Lucien; “for I am low—very low.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, heavens,” cried Beauchamp, “the minister quotes Béranger, what\r\nshall we come to next?”\r\n\r\n“M. de Château-Renaud—M. Maximilian Morrel,” said the servant,\r\nannouncing two fresh guests.\r\n\r\n“Now, then, to breakfast,” said Beauchamp; “for, if I remember, you\r\ntold me you only expected two persons, Albert.”\r\n\r\n“Morrel,” muttered Albert—“Morrel—who is he?”\r\n\r\nBut before he had finished, M. de Château-Renaud, a handsome young man\r\nof thirty, gentleman all over,—that is, with the figure of a Guiche and\r\nthe wit of a Mortemart,—took Albert’s hand.\r\n\r\n“My dear Albert,” said he, “let me introduce to you M. Maximilian\r\nMorrel, captain of Spahis, my friend; and what is more—however the man\r\nspeaks for himself—my preserver. Salute my hero, viscount.”\r\n\r\nAnd he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and\r\ndignified bearing, with large and open brow, piercing eyes, and black\r\nmoustache, whom our readers have already seen at Marseilles, under\r\ncircumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten. A rich\r\nuniform, half French, half Oriental, set off his graceful and stalwart\r\nfigure, and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the Legion\r\nof Honor. The young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said Albert with affectionate courtesy, “the count of\r\nChâteau-Renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me;\r\nyou are his friend, be ours also.”\r\n\r\n“Well said,” interrupted Château-Renaud; “and pray that, if you should\r\never be in a similar predicament, he may do as much for you as he did\r\nfor me.”\r\n\r\n“What has he done?” asked Albert.\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing worth speaking of,” said Morrel; “M. de Château-Renaud\r\nexaggerates.”\r\n\r\n“Not worth speaking of?” cried Château-Renaud; “life is not worth\r\nspeaking of!—that is rather too philosophical, on my word, Morrel. It\r\nis very well for you, who risk your life every day, but for me, who\r\nonly did so once——”\r\n\r\n“We gather from all this, baron, that Captain Morrel saved your life.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so.”\r\n\r\n“On what occasion?” asked Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Beauchamp, my good fellow, you know I am starving,” said Debray: “do\r\nnot set him off on some long story.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I do not prevent your sitting down to table,” replied Beauchamp,\r\n“Château-Renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast.”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Morcerf, “it is only a quarter past ten, and I expect\r\nsomeone else.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, true, a diplomatist!” observed Debray.\r\n\r\n“Diplomat or not, I don’t know; I only know that he charged himself on\r\nmy account with a mission, which he terminated so entirely to my\r\nsatisfaction, that had I been king, I should have instantly created him\r\nknight of all my orders, even had I been able to offer him the Golden\r\nFleece and the Garter.”\r\n\r\n“Well, since we are not to sit down to table,” said Debray, “take a\r\nglass of sherry, and tell us all about it.”\r\n\r\n“You all know that I had the fancy of going to Africa.”\r\n\r\n“It is a road your ancestors have traced for you,” said Albert\r\ngallantly.\r\n\r\n“Yes? but I doubt that your object was like theirs—to rescue the Holy\r\nSepulchre.”\r\n\r\n“You are quite right, Beauchamp,” observed the young aristocrat. “It\r\nwas only to fight as an amateur. I cannot bear duelling ever since two\r\nseconds, whom I had chosen to arrange an affair, forced me to break the\r\narm of one of my best friends, one whom you all know—poor Franz\r\nd’Épinay.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, true,” said Debray, “you did fight some time ago; about what?”\r\n\r\n20235m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“The devil take me, if I remember,” returned Château-Renaud. “But I\r\nrecollect perfectly one thing, that, being unwilling to let such\r\ntalents as mine sleep, I wished to try upon the Arabs the new pistols\r\nthat had been given to me. In consequence I embarked for Oran, and went\r\nfrom thence to Constantine, where I arrived just in time to witness the\r\nraising of the siege. I retreated with the rest, for eight-and-forty\r\nhours. I endured the rain during the day, and the cold during the night\r\ntolerably well, but the third morning my horse died of cold. Poor\r\nbrute—accustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable,\r\nthe Arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in\r\nArabia.”\r\n\r\n“That’s why you want to purchase my English horse,” said Debray, “you\r\nthink he will bear the cold better.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, for I have made a vow never to return to Africa.”\r\n\r\n“You were very much frightened, then?” asked Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, and I had good reason to be so,” replied Château-Renaud. “I\r\nwas retreating on foot, for my horse was dead. Six Arabs came up, full\r\ngallop, to cut off my head. I shot two with my double-barrelled gun,\r\nand two more with my pistols, but I was then disarmed, and two were\r\nstill left; one seized me by the hair (that is why I now wear it so\r\nshort, for no one knows what may happen), the other swung a yataghan,\r\nand I already felt the cold steel on my neck, when this gentleman whom\r\nyou see here charged them, shot the one who held me by the hair, and\r\ncleft the skull of the other with his sabre. He had assigned himself\r\nthe task of saving a man’s life that day; chance caused that man to be\r\nmyself. When I am rich I will order a statue of Chance from Klagmann or\r\nMarochetti.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Morrel, smiling, “it was the 5th of September, the\r\nanniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved;\r\ntherefore, as far as it lies in my power, I endeavor to celebrate it by\r\nsome——”\r\n\r\n20237m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Heroic action,” interrupted Château-Renaud. “I was chosen. But that is\r\nnot all—after rescuing me from the sword, he rescued me from the cold,\r\nnot by sharing his cloak with me, like St. Martin, but by giving me the\r\nwhole; then from hunger by sharing with me—guess what?”\r\n\r\n“A Strasbourg pie?” asked Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“No, his horse; of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty\r\nappetite. It was very hard.”\r\n\r\n“The horse?” said Morcerf, laughing.\r\n\r\n“No, the sacrifice,” returned Château-Renaud; “ask Debray if he would\r\nsacrifice his English steed for a stranger?”\r\n\r\n“Not for a stranger,” said Debray, “but for a friend I might, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“I divined that you would become mine, count,” replied Morrel;\r\n“besides, as I had the honor to tell you, heroism or not, sacrifice or\r\nnot, that day I owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the\r\nfavors good fortune had on other days granted to us.”\r\n\r\n“The history to which M. Morrel alludes,” continued Château-Renaud, “is\r\nan admirable one, which he will tell you some day when you are better\r\nacquainted with him; today let us fill our stomachs, and not our\r\nmemories. What time do you breakfast, Albert?”\r\n\r\n“At half-past ten.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely?” asked Debray, taking out his watch.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you will give me five minutes’ grace,” replied Morcerf, “for I\r\nalso expect a preserver.”\r\n\r\n“Of whom?”\r\n\r\n“Of myself,” cried Morcerf; “_parbleu!_ do you think I cannot be saved\r\nas well as anyone else, and that there are only Arabs who cut off\r\nheads? Our breakfast is a philanthropic one, and we shall have at\r\ntable—at least, I hope so—two benefactors of humanity.”\r\n\r\n“What shall we do?” said Debray; “we have only one Monthyon prize.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it,”\r\nsaid Beauchamp; “that is the way the Academy mostly escapes from the\r\ndilemma.”\r\n\r\n“And where does he come from?” asked Debray. “You have already answered\r\nthe question once, but so vaguely that I venture to put it a second\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“Really,” said Albert, “I do not know; when I invited him three months\r\nago, he was then at Rome, but since that time who knows where he may\r\nhave gone?”\r\n\r\n“And you think him capable of being exact?” demanded Debray.\r\n\r\n“I think him capable of everything.”\r\n\r\n“Well, with the five minutes’ grace, we have only ten left.”\r\n\r\n“I will profit by them to tell you something about my guest.”\r\n\r\n“I beg pardon,” interrupted Beauchamp; “are there any materials for an\r\narticle in what you are going to tell us?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and for a most curious one.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, then, for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning,\r\nand I must make up for it.”\r\n\r\n“I was at Rome during the last Carnival.”\r\n\r\n“We know that,” said Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but what you do not know is that I was carried off by bandits.”\r\n\r\n“There are no bandits,” cried Debray.\r\n\r\n“Yes there are, and most hideous, or rather most admirable ones, for I\r\nfound them ugly enough to frighten me.”\r\n\r\n“Come, my dear Albert,” said Debray, “confess that your cook is\r\nbehindhand, that the oysters have not arrived from Ostend or Marennes,\r\nand that, like Madame de Maintenon, you are going to replace the dish\r\nby a story. Say so at once; we are sufficiently well-bred to excuse\r\nyou, and to listen to your history, fabulous as it promises to be.”\r\n\r\n“And I say to you, fabulous as it may seem, I tell it as a true one\r\nfrom beginning to end. The brigands had carried me off, and conducted\r\nme to a gloomy spot, called the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian.”\r\n\r\n“I know it,” said Château-Renaud; “I narrowly escaped catching a fever\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“And I did more than that,” replied Morcerf, “for I caught one. I was\r\ninformed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of 4,000 Roman\r\ncrowns—about 24,000 francs. Unfortunately, I had not above 1,500. I was\r\nat the end of my journey and of my credit. I wrote to Franz—and were he\r\nhere he would confirm every word—I wrote then to Franz that if he did\r\nnot come with the four thousand crowns before six, at ten minutes past\r\nI should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in\r\nwhose company I had the honor of being; and Signor Luigi Vampa, such\r\nwas the name of the chief of these bandits, would have scrupulously\r\nkept his word.”\r\n\r\n“But Franz did come with the four thousand crowns,” said\r\nChâteau-Renaud. “A man whose name is Franz d’Épinay or Albert de\r\nMorcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them.”\r\n\r\n“No, he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to present\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus, a Perseus freeing\r\nAndromeda.”\r\n\r\n“No, he is a man about my own size.”\r\n\r\n“Armed to the teeth?”\r\n\r\n“He had not even a knitting-needle.”\r\n\r\n“But he paid your ransom?”\r\n\r\n“He said two words to the chief and I was free.”\r\n\r\n“And they apologized to him for having carried you off?” said\r\nBeauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Just so.”\r\n\r\n“Why, he is a second Ariosto.”\r\n\r\n“No, his name is the Count of Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\n“There is no Count of Monte Cristo” said Debray.\r\n\r\n“I do not think so,” added Château-Renaud, with the air of a man who\r\nknows the whole of the European nobility perfectly.\r\n\r\n“Does anyone know anything of a Count of Monte Cristo?”\r\n\r\n“He comes possibly from the Holy Land, and one of his ancestors\r\npossessed Calvary, as the Mortemarts did the Dead Sea.”\r\n\r\n“I think I can assist your researches,” said Maximilian. “Monte Cristo\r\nis a little island I have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my\r\nfather employed—a grain of sand in the centre of the Mediterranean, an\r\natom in the infinite.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely!” cried Albert. “Well, he of whom I speak is the lord and\r\nmaster of this grain of sand, of this atom; he has purchased the title\r\nof count somewhere in Tuscany.”\r\n\r\n“He is rich, then?”\r\n\r\n“I believe so.”\r\n\r\n“But that ought to be visible.”\r\n\r\n“That is what deceives you, Debray.”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand you.”\r\n\r\n“Have you read the _Arabian Nights_?”\r\n\r\n“What a question!”\r\n\r\n“Well, do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor, if\r\ntheir sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds? They seem like poor\r\nfishermen, and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with\r\nthe wealth of the Indies.”\r\n\r\n“Which means?”\r\n\r\n“Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those fishermen.\r\nHe has even a name taken from the book, since he calls himself Sinbad\r\nthe Sailor, and has a cave filled with gold.”\r\n\r\n“And you have seen this cavern, Morcerf?” asked Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“No, but Franz has; for heaven’s sake, not a word of this before him.\r\nFranz went in with his eyes blindfolded, and was waited on by mutes and\r\nby women to whom Cleopatra was a painted strumpet. Only he is not quite\r\nsure about the women, for they did not come in until after he had taken\r\nhashish, so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of\r\nstatues.”\r\n\r\nThe two young men looked at Morcerf as if to say,—“Are you mad, or are\r\nyou laughing at us?”\r\n\r\n“And I also,” said Morrel thoughtfully, “have heard something like this\r\nfrom an old sailor named Penelon.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” cried Albert, “it is very lucky that M. Morrel comes to aid me;\r\nyou are vexed, are you not, that he thus gives a clew to the\r\nlabyrinth?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Albert,” said Debray, “what you tell us is so extraordinary.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of\r\nthem—they have no time. They are too much taken up with interfering in\r\nthe affairs of their countrymen who travel.”\r\n\r\n“Now you get angry, and attack our poor agents. How will you have them\r\nprotect you? The Chamber cuts down their salaries every day, so that\r\nnow they have scarcely any. Will you be ambassador, Albert? I will send\r\nyou to Constantinople.”\r\n\r\n“No, lest on the first demonstration I make in favor of Mehemet Ali,\r\nthe Sultan send me the bowstring, and make my secretaries strangle me.”\r\n\r\n“You say very true,” responded Debray.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Albert, “but this has nothing to do with the existence of\r\nthe Count of Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_ everyone exists.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, but not in the same way; everyone has not black slaves, a\r\nprincely retinue, an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an\r\nArabian fortress, horses that cost six thousand francs apiece, and\r\nGreek mistresses.”\r\n\r\n“Have you seen the Greek mistress?”\r\n\r\n“I have both seen and heard her. I saw her at the theatre, and heard\r\nher one morning when I breakfasted with the count.”\r\n\r\n“He eats, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but so little, it can hardly be called eating.”\r\n\r\n“He must be a vampire.”\r\n\r\n“Laugh, if you will; the Countess G——, who knew Lord Ruthven, declared\r\nthat the count was a vampire.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, capital,” said Beauchamp. “For a man not connected with\r\nnewspapers, here is the pendant to the famous sea-serpent of the\r\n_Constitutionnel_.”\r\n\r\n“Wild eyes, the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure,” said\r\nDebray; “facial angle strongly developed, magnificent forehead, livid\r\ncomplexion, black beard, sharp and white teeth, politeness\r\nunexceptionable.”\r\n\r\n“Just so, Lucien,” returned Morcerf; “you have described him feature\r\nfor feature. Yes, keen and cutting politeness. This man has often made\r\nme shudder; and one day when we were viewing an execution, I thought I\r\nshould faint, more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he\r\nspoke of every description of torture, than from the sight of the\r\nexecutioner and the culprit.”\r\n\r\n“Did he not conduct you to the ruins of the Colosseum and suck your\r\nblood?” asked Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Or, having delivered you, make you sign a flaming parchment,\r\nsurrendering your soul to him as Esau did his birth-right?”\r\n\r\n“Rail on, rail on at your ease, gentlemen,” said Morcerf, somewhat\r\npiqued. “When I look at you Parisians, idlers on the Boulevard de Gand\r\nor the Bois de Boulogne, and think of this man, it seems to me we are\r\nnot of the same race.”\r\n\r\n“I am highly flattered,” returned Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“At the same time,” added Château-Renaud, “your Count of Monte Cristo\r\nis a very fine fellow, always excepting his little arrangements with\r\nthe Italian banditti.”\r\n\r\n“There are no Italian banditti,” said Debray.\r\n\r\n“No vampire,” cried Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“No Count of Monte Cristo” added Debray. “There is half-past ten\r\nstriking, Albert.”\r\n\r\n20243m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Confess you have dreamed this, and let us sit down to breakfast,”\r\ncontinued Beauchamp.\r\n\r\nBut the sound of the clock had not died away when Germain announced,\r\n“His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo.” The involuntary start\r\neveryone gave proved how much Morcerf’s narrative had impressed them,\r\nand Albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden\r\nemotion. He had not heard a carriage stop in the street, or steps in\r\nthe antechamber; the door had itself opened noiselessly. The count\r\nappeared, dressed with the greatest simplicity, but the most fastidious\r\ndandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet. Every article\r\nof dress—hat, coat, gloves, and boots—was from the first makers. He\r\nseemed scarcely five-and-thirty. But what struck everybody was his\r\nextreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had drawn. The count\r\nadvanced, smiling, into the centre of the room, and approached Albert,\r\nwho hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner.\r\n\r\n“Punctuality,” said Monte Cristo, “is the politeness of kings,\r\naccording to one of your sovereigns, I think; but it is not the same\r\nwith travellers. However, I hope you will excuse the two or three\r\nseconds I am behindhand; five hundred leagues are not to be\r\naccomplished without some trouble, and especially in France, where, it\r\nseems, it is forbidden to beat the postilions.”\r\n\r\n“My dear count,” replied Albert, “I was announcing your visit to some\r\nof my friends, whom I had invited in consequence of the promise you did\r\nme the honor to make, and whom I now present to you. They are the Count\r\nof Château-Renaud, whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers, and\r\nwhose ancestors had a place at the Round Table; M. Lucien Debray,\r\nprivate secretary to the minister of the interior; M. Beauchamp, an\r\neditor of a paper, and the terror of the French government, but of\r\nwhom, in spite of his national celebrity, you perhaps have not heard in\r\nItaly, since his paper is prohibited there; and M. Maximilian Morrel,\r\ncaptain of Spahis.”\r\n\r\nAt this name the count, who had hitherto saluted everyone with\r\ncourtesy, but at the same time with coldness and formality, stepped a\r\npace forward, and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks.\r\n\r\n“You wear the uniform of the new French conquerors, monsieur,” said he;\r\n“it is a handsome uniform.”\r\n\r\nNo one could have said what caused the count’s voice to vibrate so\r\ndeeply, and what made his eye flash, which was in general so clear,\r\nlustrous, and limpid when he pleased.\r\n\r\n“You have never seen our Africans, count?” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“Never,” replied the count, who was by this time perfectly master of\r\nhimself again.\r\n\r\n“Well, beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts\r\nin the whole army.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, M. de Morcerf,” interrupted Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Let me go on, captain. And we have just heard,” continued Albert, “of\r\na new deed of his, and so heroic a one, that, although I have seen him\r\ntoday for the first time, I request you to allow me to introduce him as\r\nmy friend.”\r\n\r\nAt these words it was still possible to observe in Monte Cristo the\r\nconcentrated look, changing color, and slight trembling of the eyelid\r\nthat show emotion.\r\n\r\n“Ah, you have a noble heart,” said the count; “so much the better.”\r\n\r\nThis exclamation, which corresponded to the count’s own thought rather\r\nthan to what Albert was saying, surprised everybody, and especially\r\nMorrel, who looked at Monte Cristo with wonder. But, at the same time,\r\nthe intonation was so soft that, however strange the speech might seem,\r\nit was impossible to be offended at it.\r\n\r\n20245m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Why should he doubt it?” said Beauchamp to Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“In reality,” replied the latter, who, with his aristocratic glance and\r\nhis knowledge of the world, had penetrated at once all that was\r\npenetrable in Monte Cristo, “Albert has not deceived us, for the count\r\nis a most singular being. What say you, Morrel!”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, he has an open look about him that pleases me, in spite of\r\nthe singular remark he has made about me.”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Albert, “Germain informs me that breakfast is ready.\r\nMy dear count, allow me to show you the way.” They passed silently into\r\nthe breakfast-room, and everyone took his place.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said the count, seating himself, “permit me to make a\r\nconfession which must form my excuse for any improprieties I may\r\ncommit. I am a stranger, and a stranger to such a degree, that this is\r\nthe first time I have ever been at Paris. The French way of living is\r\nutterly unknown to me, and up to the present time I have followed the\r\nEastern customs, which are entirely in contrast to the Parisian. I beg\r\nyou, therefore, to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish, too\r\nItalian, or too Arabian. Now, then, let us breakfast.”\r\n\r\n“With what an air he says all this,” muttered Beauchamp; “decidedly he\r\nis a great man.”\r\n\r\n“A great man in his own country,” added Debray.\r\n\r\n“A great man in every country, M. Debray,” said Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\nThe count was, it may be remembered, a most temperate guest. Albert\r\nremarked this, expressing his fears lest, at the outset, the Parisian\r\nmode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n“My dear count,” said he, “I fear one thing, and that is, that the fare\r\nof the Rue du Helder is not so much to your taste as that of the Piazza\r\ndi Spagna. I ought to have consulted you on the point, and have had\r\nsome dishes prepared expressly.”\r\n\r\n“Did you know me better,” returned the count, smiling, “you would not\r\ngive one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself, who has\r\nsuccessively lived on macaroni at Naples, polenta at Milan, olla\r\npodrida at Valencia, pilau at Constantinople, curry in India, and\r\nswallows’ nests in China. I eat everywhere, and of everything, only I\r\neat but little; and today, that you reproach me with my want of\r\nappetite, is my day of appetite, for I have not eaten since yesterday\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\n“What,” cried all the guests, “you have not eaten for four-and-twenty\r\nhours?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the count; “I was forced to go out of my road to obtain\r\nsome information near Nîmes, so that I was somewhat late, and therefore\r\nI did not choose to stop.”\r\n\r\n“And you ate in your carriage?” asked Morcerf.\r\n\r\n“No, I slept, as I generally do when I am weary without having the\r\ncourage to amuse myself, or when I am hungry without feeling inclined\r\nto eat.”\r\n\r\n“But you can sleep when you please, monsieur?” said Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You have a recipe for it?”\r\n\r\n“An infallible one.”\r\n\r\n“That would be invaluable to us in Africa, who have not always any food\r\nto eat, and rarely anything to drink.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Monte Cristo; “but, unfortunately, a recipe excellent for a\r\nman like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army, which might\r\nnot awake when it was needed.”\r\n\r\n“May we inquire what is this recipe?” asked Debray.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” returned Monte Cristo; “I make no secret of it. It is a\r\nmixture of excellent opium, which I fetched myself from Canton in order\r\nto have it pure, and the best hashish which grows in the East—that is,\r\nbetween the Tigris and the Euphrates. These two ingredients are mixed\r\nin equal proportions, and formed into pills. Ten minutes after one is\r\ntaken, the effect is produced. Ask Baron Franz d’Épinay; I think he\r\ntasted them one day.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Morcerf, “he said something about it to me.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Beauchamp, who, as became a journalist, was very\r\nincredulous, “you always carry this drug about you?”\r\n\r\n“Always.”\r\n\r\n“Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?”\r\ncontinued Beauchamp, hoping to take him at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur,” returned the count; and he drew from his pocket a\r\nmarvellous casket, formed out of a single emerald and closed by a\r\ngolden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored\r\npellet about the size of a pea. This ball had an acrid and penetrating\r\nodor. There were four or five more in the emerald, which would contain\r\nabout a dozen. The casket passed around the table, but it was more to\r\nexamine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from\r\nhand to hand.\r\n\r\n“And is it your cook who prepares these pills?” asked Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, monsieur,” replied Monte Cristo; “I do not thus betray my\r\nenjoyments to the vulgar. I am a tolerable chemist, and prepare my\r\npills myself.”\r\n\r\n“This is a magnificent emerald, and the largest I have ever seen,” said\r\nChâteau-Renaud, “although my mother has some remarkable family jewels.”\r\n\r\n“I had three similar ones,” returned Monte Cristo. “I gave one to the\r\nSultan, who mounted it in his sabre; another to our holy father the\r\nPope, who had it set in his tiara, opposite to one nearly as large,\r\nthough not so fine, given by the Emperor Napoleon to his predecessor,\r\nPius VII. I kept the third for myself, and I had it hollowed out, which\r\nreduced its value, but rendered it more commodious for the purpose I\r\nintended.”\r\n\r\nEveryone looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment; he spoke with so\r\nmuch simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth, or that he was\r\nmad. However, the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to\r\nthe former belief.\r\n\r\n“And what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these\r\nmagnificent presents?” asked Debray.\r\n\r\n“The Sultan, the liberty of a woman,” replied the Count; “the Pope, the\r\nlife of a man; so that once in my life I have been as powerful as if\r\nheaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne.”\r\n\r\n“And it was Peppino you saved, was it not?” cried Morcerf; “it was for\r\nhim that you obtained pardon?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” returned the count, smiling.\r\n\r\n“My dear count, you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you\r\nspeak thus,” said Morcerf. “I had announced you beforehand to my\r\nfriends as an enchanter of the _Arabian Nights_, a wizard of the Middle\r\nAges; but the Parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake\r\nfor caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths, when\r\nthese truths do not form a part of their daily existence. For example,\r\nhere is Debray who reads, and Beauchamp who prints, every day, ‘A\r\nmember of the Jockey Club has been stopped and robbed on the\r\nBoulevard;’ ‘four persons have been assassinated in the Rue St. Denis’\r\nor ‘the Faubourg St. Germain;’ ‘ten, fifteen, or twenty thieves, have\r\nbeen arrested in a _café_ on the Boulevard du Temple, or in the Thermes\r\nde Julien,’—and yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in\r\nthe Maremma, the Campagna di Romana, or the Pontine Marshes. Tell them\r\nyourself that I was taken by bandits, and that without your generous\r\nintercession I should now have been sleeping in the Catacombs of St.\r\nSebastian, instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the Rue du\r\nHelder.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Monte Cristo “you promised me never to mention that\r\ncircumstance.”\r\n\r\n“It was not I who made that promise,” cried Morcerf; “it must have been\r\nsomeone else whom you have rescued in the same manner, and whom you\r\nhave forgotten. Pray speak of it, for I shall not only, I trust, relate\r\nthe little I do know, but also a great deal I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” returned the count, smiling, “that you played a\r\nsufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened.”\r\n\r\n20249m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, you promise me, if I tell all I know, to relate, in your turn,\r\nall that I do not know?”\r\n\r\n“That is but fair,” replied Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Morcerf, “for three days I believed myself the object of\r\nthe attentions of a masque, whom I took for a descendant of Tullia or\r\nPoppæa, while I was simply the object of the attentions of a\r\n_contadina_, and I say _contadina_ to avoid saying peasant girl. What I\r\nknow is, that, like a fool, a greater fool than he of whom I spoke just\r\nnow, I mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or\r\nsixteen, with a beardless chin and slim waist, and who, just as I was\r\nabout to imprint a chaste salute on his lips, placed a pistol to my\r\nhead, and, aided by seven or eight others, led, or rather dragged me,\r\nto the Catacombs of St. Sebastian, where I found a highly educated\r\nbrigand chief perusing Cæsar’s _Commentaries_, and who deigned to leave\r\noff reading to inform me, that unless the next morning, before six\r\no’clock, four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his\r\nbanker’s, at a quarter past six I should have ceased to exist. The\r\nletter is still to be seen, for it is in Franz d’Épinay’s possession,\r\nsigned by me, and with a postscript of M. Luigi Vampa. This is all I\r\nknow, but I know not, count, how you contrived to inspire so much\r\nrespect in the bandits of Rome who ordinarily have so little respect\r\nfor anything. I assure you, Franz and I were lost in admiration.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing more simple,” returned the count. “I had known the famous\r\nVampa for more than ten years. When he was quite a child, and only a\r\nshepherd, I gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way, and he,\r\nin order to repay me, gave me a poniard, the hilt of which he had\r\ncarved with his own hand, and which you may have seen in my collection\r\nof arms. In after years, whether he had forgotten this interchange of\r\npresents, which ought to have cemented our friendship, or whether he\r\ndid not recollect me, he sought to take me, but, on the contrary, it\r\nwas I who captured him and a dozen of his band. I might have handed him\r\nover to Roman justice, which is somewhat expeditious, and which would\r\nhave been particularly so with him; but I did nothing of the sort—I\r\nsuffered him and his band to depart.”\r\n\r\n“With the condition that they should sin no more,” said Beauchamp,\r\nlaughing. “I see they kept their promise.”\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur,” returned Monte Cristo “upon the simple condition that\r\nthey should respect myself and my friends. Perhaps what I am about to\r\nsay may seem strange to you, who are socialists, and vaunt humanity and\r\nyour duty to your neighbor, but I never seek to protect a society which\r\ndoes not protect me, and which I will even say, generally occupies\r\nitself about me only to injure me; and thus by giving them a low place\r\nin my esteem, and preserving a neutrality towards them, it is society\r\nand my neighbor who are indebted to me.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo,” cried Château-Renaud; “you are the first man I ever met\r\nsufficiently courageous to preach egotism. Bravo, count, bravo!”\r\n\r\n“It is frank, at least,” said Morrel. “But I am sure that the count\r\ndoes not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so\r\nboldly avowed.”\r\n\r\n“How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?” asked Monte\r\nCristo, who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity,\r\nthat two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that\r\nclear and piercing glance.\r\n\r\n“Why, it seems to me,” replied Morrel, “that in delivering M. de\r\nMorcerf, whom you did not know, you did good to your neighbor and to\r\nsociety.”\r\n\r\n“Of which he is the brightest ornament,” said Beauchamp, drinking off a\r\nglass of champagne.\r\n\r\n“My dear count,” cried Morcerf, “you are at fault—you, one of the most\r\nformidable logicians I know—and you must see it clearly proved that\r\ninstead of being an egotist, you are a philanthropist. Ah, you call\r\nyourself Oriental, a Levantine, Maltese, Indian, Chinese; your family\r\nname is Monte Cristo; Sinbad the Sailor is your baptismal appellation,\r\nand yet the first day you set foot in Paris you instinctively display\r\nthe greatest virtue, or rather the chief defect, of us eccentric\r\nParisians,—that is, you assume the vices you have not, and conceal the\r\nvirtues you possess.”\r\n\r\n“My dear vicomte,” returned Monte Cristo, “I do not see, in all I have\r\ndone, anything that merits, either from you or these gentlemen, the\r\npretended eulogies I have received. You were no stranger to me, for I\r\nknew you from the time I gave up two rooms to you, invited you to\r\nbreakfast with me, lent you one of my carriages, witnessed the Carnival\r\nin your company, and saw with you from a window in the Piazza del\r\nPopolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted.\r\nI will appeal to any of these gentlemen, could I leave my guest in the\r\nhands of a hideous bandit, as you term him? Besides, you know, I had\r\nthe idea that you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when\r\nI came to France. You might some time ago have looked upon this\r\nresolution as a vague project, but today you see it was a reality, and\r\nyou must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word.”\r\n\r\n“I will keep it,” returned Morcerf; “but I fear that you will be much\r\ndisappointed, accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic\r\nhorizons. Amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with\r\nwhich your adventurous existence has so familiarized you; our\r\nChimborazo is Mortmartre, our Himalaya is Mount Valérien, our Great\r\nDesert is the plain of Grenelle, where they are now boring an artesian\r\nwell to water the caravans. We have plenty of thieves, though not so\r\nmany as is said; but these thieves stand in far more dread of a\r\npoliceman than a lord. France is so prosaic, and Paris so civilized a\r\ncity, that you will not find in its eighty-five departments—I say\r\neighty-five, because I do not include Corsica—you will not find, then,\r\nin these eighty-five departments a single hill on which there is not a\r\ntelegraph, or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up\r\na gaslamp. There is but one service I can render you, and for that I\r\nplace myself entirely at your orders, that is, to present, or make my\r\nfriends present, you everywhere; besides, you have no need of anyone to\r\nintroduce you—with your name, and your fortune, and your talent” (Monte\r\nCristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile) “you can present yourself\r\neverywhere, and be well received. I can be useful in one way only—if\r\nknowledge of Parisian habits, of the means of rendering yourself\r\ncomfortable, or of the bazaars, can assist, you may depend upon me to\r\nfind you a fitting dwelling here. I do not dare offer to share my\r\napartments with you, as I shared yours at Rome—I, who do not profess\r\negotism, but am yet egotist _par excellence_; for, except myself, these\r\nrooms would not hold a shadow more, unless that shadow were feminine.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the count, “that is a most conjugal reservation; I recollect\r\nthat at Rome you said something of a projected marriage. May I\r\ncongratulate you?”\r\n\r\n“The affair is still in projection.”\r\n\r\n“And he who says in ‘projection,’ means already decided,” said Debray.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Morcerf, “my father is most anxious about it; and I hope,\r\nere long, to introduce you, if not to my wife, at least to my\r\nbetrothed—Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“Eugénie Danglars,” said Monte Cristo; “tell me, is not her father\r\nBaron Danglars?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned Morcerf, “a baron of a new creation.”\r\n\r\n“What matter,” said Monte Cristo “if he has rendered the State services\r\nwhich merit this distinction?”\r\n\r\n“Enormous ones,” answered Beauchamp. “Although in reality a Liberal, he\r\nnegotiated a loan of six millions for Charles X., in 1829, who made him\r\na baron and chevalier of the Legion of Honor; so that he wears the\r\nribbon, not, as you would think, in his waistcoat-pocket, but at his\r\nbutton-hole.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” interrupted Morcerf, laughing, “Beauchamp, Beauchamp, keep that\r\nfor the _Corsaire_ or the _Charivari_, but spare my future\r\nfather-in-law before me.” Then, turning to Monte Cristo, “You just now\r\nspoke his name as if you knew the baron?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know him,” returned Monte Cristo; “but I shall probably soon\r\nmake his acquaintance, for I have a credit opened with him by the house\r\nof Richard & Blount, of London, Arstein & Eskeles of Vienna, and\r\nThomson & French at Rome.” As he pronounced the two last names, the\r\ncount glanced at Maximilian Morrel. If the stranger expected to produce\r\nan effect on Morrel, he was not mistaken—Maximilian started as if he\r\nhad been electrified.\r\n\r\n“Thomson & French,” said he; “do you know this house, monsieur?”\r\n\r\n20253m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“They are my bankers in the capital of the Christian world,” returned\r\nthe count quietly. “Can my influence with them be of any service to\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, count, you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been,\r\nup to the present, fruitless. This house, in past years, did ours a\r\ngreat service, and has, I know not for what reason, always denied\r\nhaving rendered us this service.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be at your orders,” said Monte Cristo bowing.\r\n\r\n“But,” continued Morcerf, “_à propos_ of Danglars,—we have strangely\r\nwandered from the subject. We were speaking of a suitable habitation\r\nfor the Count of Monte Cristo. Come, gentlemen, let us all propose some\r\nplace. Where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital?”\r\n\r\n“Faubourg Saint-Germain,” said Château-Renaud. “The count will find\r\nthere a charming hotel, with a court and garden.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! Château-Renaud,” returned Debray, “you only know your dull and\r\ngloomy Faubourg Saint-Germain; do not pay any attention to him,\r\ncount—live in the Chaussée d’Antin, that’s the real centre of Paris.”\r\n\r\n“Boulevard de l’Opéra,” said Beauchamp; “the second floor—a house with\r\na balcony. The count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought\r\nthere, and as he smokes his chibouque, see all Paris pass before him.”\r\n\r\n“You have no idea, then, Morrel?” asked Château-Renaud; “you do not\r\npropose anything.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” returned the young man, smiling; “on the contrary, I have\r\none, but I expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant\r\nproposals made him, yet as he has not replied to any of them, I will\r\nventure to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel, in the\r\nPompadour style, that my sister has inhabited for a year, in the Rue\r\nMeslay.”\r\n\r\n“You have a sister?” asked the count.\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur, a most excellent sister.”\r\n\r\n“Married?”\r\n\r\n“Nearly nine years.”\r\n\r\n“Happy?” asked the count again.\r\n\r\n“As happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be,” replied\r\nMaximilian. “She married the man she loved, who remained faithful to us\r\nin our fallen fortunes—Emmanuel Herbaut.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo smiled imperceptibly.\r\n\r\n“I live there during my leave of absence,” continued Maximilian; “and I\r\nshall be, together with my brother-in-law Emmanuel, at the disposition\r\nof the Count, whenever he thinks fit to honor us.”\r\n\r\n“One minute,” cried Albert, without giving Monte Cristo the time to\r\nreply. “Take care, you are going to immure a traveller, Sinbad the\r\nSailor, a man who comes to see Paris; you are going to make a patriarch\r\nof him.”\r\n\r\n20255m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” said Morrel; “my sister is five-and-twenty, my brother-in-law\r\nis thirty, they are gay, young, and happy. Besides, the count will be\r\nin his own house, and only see them when he thinks fit to do so.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, monsieur,” said Monte Cristo; “I shall content myself with\r\nbeing presented to your sister and her husband, if you will do me the\r\nhonor to introduce me; but I cannot accept the offer of anyone of these\r\ngentlemen, since my habitation is already prepared.”\r\n\r\n“What,” cried Morcerf; “you are, then, going to a hotel—that will be\r\nvery dull for you.”\r\n\r\n“Was I so badly lodged at Rome?” said Monte Cristo smiling.\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu!_ at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing\r\nyour apartments, but I presume that you are not disposed to spend a\r\nsimilar sum every day.”\r\n\r\n“It is not that which deterred me,” replied Monte Cristo; “but as I\r\ndetermined to have a house to myself, I sent on my valet de chambre,\r\nand he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it.”\r\n\r\n“But you have, then, a valet de chambre who knows Paris?” said\r\nBeauchamp.\r\n\r\n“It is the first time he has ever been in Paris. He is black, and\r\ncannot speak,” returned Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“It is Ali!” cried Albert, in the midst of the general surprise.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Ali himself, my Nubian mute, whom you saw, I think, at Rome.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Morcerf; “I recollect him perfectly. But how could\r\nyou charge a Nubian to purchase a house, and a mute to furnish it?—he\r\nwill do everything wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Undeceive yourself, monsieur,” replied Monte Cristo; “I am quite sure,\r\nthat, on the contrary, he will choose everything as I wish. He knows my\r\ntastes, my caprices, my wants. He has been here a week, with the\r\ninstinct of a hound, hunting by himself. He will arrange everything for\r\nme. He knew, that I should arrive today at ten o’clock; he was waiting\r\nfor me at nine at the Barrière de Fontainebleau. He gave me this paper;\r\nit contains the number of my new abode; read it yourself,” and Monte\r\nCristo passed a paper to Albert.\r\n\r\n“Ah, that is really original,” said Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“And very princely,” added Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“What, do you not know your house?” asked Debray.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Monte Cristo; “I told you I did not wish to be behind my\r\ntime; I dressed myself in the carriage, and descended at the viscount’s\r\ndoor.” The young men looked at each other; they did not know if it was\r\na comedy Monte Cristo was playing, but every word he uttered had such\r\nan air of simplicity, that it was impossible to suppose what he said\r\nwas false—besides, why should he tell a falsehood?\r\n\r\n“We must content ourselves, then,” said Beauchamp, “with rendering the\r\ncount all the little services in our power. I, in my quality of\r\njournalist, open all the theatres to him.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, monsieur,” returned Monte Cristo, “my steward has orders to\r\ntake a box at each theatre.”\r\n\r\n“Is your steward also a Nubian?” asked Debray.\r\n\r\n“No, he is a countryman of yours, if a Corsican is a countryman of\r\nanyone’s. But you know him, M. de Morcerf.”\r\n\r\n“Is it that excellent M. Bertuccio, who understands hiring windows so\r\nwell?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you; he has been\r\na soldier, a smuggler—in fact, everything. I would not be quite sure\r\nthat he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle—a stab\r\nwith a knife, for instance.”\r\n\r\n“And you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward,” said\r\nDebray. “Of how much does he rob you every year?”\r\n\r\n“On my word,” replied the count, “not more than another. I am sure he\r\nanswers my purpose, knows no impossibility, and so I keep him.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” continued Château-Renaud, “since you have an establishment, a\r\nsteward, and a hotel in the Champs-Élysées, you only want a mistress.”\r\nAlbert smiled. He thought of the fair Greek he had seen in the count’s\r\nbox at the Argentina and Valle theatres.\r\n\r\n“I have something better than that,” said Monte Cristo; “I have a\r\nslave. You procure your mistresses from the opera, the Vaudeville, or\r\nthe Variétés; I purchased mine at Constantinople; it cost me more, but\r\nI have nothing to fear.”\r\n\r\n“But you forget,” replied Debray, laughing, “that we are Franks by name\r\nand franks by nature, as King Charles said, and that the moment she\r\nputs her foot in France your slave becomes free.”\r\n\r\n“Who will tell her?”\r\n\r\n“The first person who sees her.”\r\n\r\n“She only speaks Romaic.”\r\n\r\n“That is different.”\r\n\r\n“But at least we shall see her,” said Beauchamp, “or do you keep\r\neunuchs as well as mutes?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” replied Monte Cristo; “I do not carry brutalism so far.\r\nEveryone who surrounds me is free to quit me, and when they leave me\r\nwill no longer have any need of me or anyone else; it is for that\r\nreason, perhaps, that they do not quit me.”\r\n\r\nThey had long since passed to dessert and cigars.\r\n\r\n“My dear Albert,” said Debray, rising, “it is half-past two. Your guest\r\nis charming, but you leave the best company to go into the worst\r\nsometimes. I must return to the minister’s. I will tell him of the\r\ncount, and we shall soon know who he is.”\r\n\r\n“Take care,” returned Albert; “no one has been able to accomplish\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we have three millions for our police; it is true they are almost\r\nalways spent beforehand, but, no matter, we shall still have fifty\r\nthousand francs to spend for this purpose.”\r\n\r\n“And when you know, will you tell me?”\r\n\r\n“I promise you. _Au revoir_, Albert. Gentlemen, good morning.”\r\n\r\nAs he left the room, Debray called out loudly, “My carriage.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo,” said Beauchamp to Albert; “I shall not go to the Chamber, but\r\nI have something better to offer my readers than a speech of M.\r\nDanglars.”\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake, Beauchamp,” returned Morcerf, “do not deprive me of\r\nthe merit of introducing him everywhere. Is he not peculiar?”\r\n\r\n“He is more than that,” replied Château-Renaud; “he is one of the most\r\nextraordinary men I ever saw in my life. Are you coming, Morrel?”\r\n\r\n“Directly I have given my card to the count, who has promised to pay us\r\na visit at Rue Meslay, No. 14.”\r\n\r\n“Be sure I shall not fail to do so,” returned the count, bowing.\r\n\r\nAnd Maximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de Château-Renaud,\r\nleaving Monte Cristo alone with Morcerf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 41. The Presentation\r\n\r\nWhen Albert found himself alone with Monte Cristo, “My dear count,”\r\nsaid he, “allow me to commence my services as _cicerone_ by showing you\r\na specimen of a bachelor’s apartment. You, who are accustomed to the\r\npalaces of Italy, can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square\r\nfeet a young man who is not the worst lodged in Paris can live. As we\r\npass from one room to another, I will open the windows to let you\r\nbreathe.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo had already seen the breakfast-room and the salon on the\r\nground floor. Albert led him first to his _atelier_, which was, as we\r\nhave said, his favorite apartment. Monte Cristo quickly appreciated all\r\nthat Albert had collected here—old cabinets, Japanese porcelain,\r\nOriental stuffs, Venetian glass, arms from all parts of the\r\nworld—everything was familiar to him; and at the first glance he\r\nrecognized their date, their country, and their origin.\r\n\r\nMorcerf had expected he should be the guide; on the contrary, it was he\r\nwho, under the count’s guidance, followed a course of archæology,\r\nmineralogy, and natural history.\r\n\r\nThey descended to the first floor; Albert led his guest into the salon.\r\nThe salon was filled with the works of modern artists; there were\r\nlandscapes by Dupré, with their long reeds and tall trees, their lowing\r\noxen and marvellous skies; Delacroix’s Arabian cavaliers, with their\r\nlong white burnouses, their shining belts, their damasked arms, their\r\nhorses, who tore each other with their teeth while their riders\r\ncontended fiercely with their maces; _aquarelles_ of Boulanger,\r\nrepresenting Notre Dame de Paris with that vigor that makes the artist\r\nthe rival of the poet; there were paintings by Diaz, who makes his\r\nflowers more beautiful than flowers, his suns more brilliant than the\r\nsun; designs by Decamp, as vividly colored as those of Salvator Rosa,\r\nbut more poetic; _pastels_ by Giraud and Müller, representing children\r\nlike angels and women with the features of a virgin; sketches torn from\r\nthe album of Dauzats’ “Travels in the East,” that had been made in a\r\nfew seconds on the saddle of a camel, or beneath the dome of a\r\nmosque—in a word, all that modern art can give in exchange and as\r\nrecompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past.\r\n\r\nAlbert expected to have something new this time to show to the\r\ntraveller, but, to his great surprise, the latter, without seeking for\r\nthe signatures, many of which, indeed, were only initials, named\r\ninstantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy\r\nto see that each name was not only known to him, but that each style\r\nassociated with it had been appreciated and studied by him. From the\r\nsalon they passed into the bedchamber; it was a model of taste and\r\nsimple elegance. A single portrait, signed by Léopold Robert, shone in\r\nits carved and gilded frame. This portrait attracted the Count of Monte\r\nCristo’s attention, for he made three rapid steps in the chamber, and\r\nstopped suddenly before it.\r\n\r\nIt was the portrait of a young woman of five or six-and-twenty, with a\r\ndark complexion, and light and lustrous eyes, veiled beneath long\r\nlashes. She wore the picturesque costume of the Catalan fisherwomen, a\r\nred and black bodice, and golden pins in her hair. She was looking at\r\nthe sea, and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky. The light\r\nwas so faint in the room that Albert did not perceive the pallor that\r\nspread itself over the count’s visage, or the nervous heaving of his\r\nchest and shoulders. Silence prevailed for an instant, during which\r\nMonte Cristo gazed intently on the picture.\r\n\r\n“You have there a most charming mistress, viscount,” said the count in\r\na perfectly calm tone; “and this costume—a ball costume,\r\ndoubtless—becomes her admirably.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, monsieur,” returned Albert, “I would never forgive you this\r\nmistake if you had seen another picture beside this. You do not know my\r\nmother; she it is whom you see here. She had her portrait painted thus\r\nsix or eight years ago. This costume is a fancy one, it appears, and\r\nthe resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same\r\nas she was in 1830. The countess had this portrait painted during the\r\ncount’s absence. She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable\r\nsurprise; but, strange to say, this portrait seemed to displease my\r\nfather, and the value of the picture, which is, as you see, one of the\r\nbest works of Léopold Robert, could not overcome his dislike to it. It\r\nis true, between ourselves, that M. de Morcerf is one of the most\r\nassiduous peers at the Luxembourg, a general renowned for theory, but a\r\nmost mediocre amateur of art. It is different with my mother, who\r\npaints exceedingly well, and who, unwilling to part with so valuable a\r\npicture, gave it to me to put here, where it would be less likely to\r\ndisplease M. de Morcerf, whose portrait, by Gros, I will also show you.\r\nExcuse my talking of family matters, but as I shall have the honor of\r\nintroducing you to the count, I tell you this to prevent you making any\r\nallusions to this picture. The picture seems to have a malign\r\ninfluence, for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it, and\r\nstill more rarely does she look at it without weeping. This\r\ndisagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the\r\ncount and countess, who are still as much united, although married more\r\nthan twenty years, as on the first day of their wedding.”\r\n\r\n20261m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo glanced rapidly at Albert, as if to seek a hidden meaning\r\nin his words, but it was evident the young man uttered them in the\r\nsimplicity of his heart.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Albert, “that you have seen all my treasures, allow me to\r\noffer them to you, unworthy as they are. Consider yourself as in your\r\nown house, and to put yourself still more at your ease, pray accompany\r\nme to the apartments of M. de Morcerf, he whom I wrote from Rome an\r\naccount of the services you rendered me, and to whom I announced your\r\npromised visit, and I may say that both the count and countess\r\nanxiously desire to thank you in person. You are somewhat _blasé_ I\r\nknow, and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor, who\r\nhas seen so many others. However, accept what I propose to you as an\r\ninitiation into Parisian life—a life of politeness, visiting, and\r\nintroductions.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo bowed without making any answer; he accepted the offer\r\nwithout enthusiasm and without regret, as one of those conventions of\r\nsociety which every gentleman looks upon as a duty. Albert summoned his\r\nservant, and ordered him to acquaint M. and Madame de Morcerf of the\r\narrival of the Count of Monte Cristo. Albert followed him with the\r\ncount. When they arrived at the antechamber, above the door was visible\r\na shield, which, by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of\r\nthe furniture, indicated the importance the owner attached to this\r\nblazon. Monte Cristo stopped and examined it attentively.\r\n\r\n“Azure seven merlets, or, placed bender,” said he. “These are,\r\ndoubtless, your family arms? Except the knowledge of blazons, that\r\nenables me to decipher them, I am very ignorant of heraldry—I, a count\r\nof a fresh creation, fabricated in Tuscany by the aid of a commandery\r\nof St. Stephen, and who would not have taken the trouble had I not been\r\ntold that when you travel much it is necessary. Besides, you must have\r\nsomething on the panels of your carriage, to escape being searched by\r\nthe custom-house officers. Excuse my putting such a question to you.”\r\n\r\n“It is not indiscreet,” returned Morcerf, with the simplicity of\r\nconviction. “You have guessed rightly. These are our arms, that is,\r\nthose of my father, but they are, as you see, joined to another shield,\r\nwhich has gules, a silver tower, which are my mother’s. By her side I\r\nam Spanish, but the family of Morcerf is French, and, I have heard, one\r\nof the oldest of the south of France.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Monte Cristo “these blazons prove that. Almost all the\r\narmed pilgrims that went to the Holy Land took for their arms either a\r\ncross, in honor of their mission, or birds of passage, in sign of the\r\nlong voyage they were about to undertake, and which they hoped to\r\naccomplish on the wings of faith. One of your ancestors had joined the\r\nCrusades, and supposing it to be only that of St. Louis, that makes you\r\nmount to the thirteenth century, which is tolerably ancient.”\r\n\r\n“It is possible,” said Morcerf; “my father has in his study a\r\ngenealogical tree which will tell you all that, and on which I made\r\ncommentaries that would have greatly edified d’Hozier and Jaucourt. At\r\npresent I no longer think of it, and yet I must tell you that we are\r\nbeginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our\r\npopular government.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, your government would do well to choose from the past\r\nsomething better than the things that I have noticed on your monuments,\r\nand which have no heraldic meaning whatever. As for you, viscount,”\r\ncontinued Monte Cristo to Morcerf, “you are more fortunate than the\r\ngovernment, for your arms are really beautiful, and speak to the\r\nimagination. Yes, you are at once from Provence and Spain; that\r\nexplains, if the portrait you showed me be like, the dark hue I so much\r\nadmired on the visage of the noble Catalan.”\r\n\r\nIt would have required the penetration of Œdipus or the Sphinx to have\r\ndivined the irony the count concealed beneath these words, apparently\r\nuttered with the greatest politeness. Morcerf thanked him with a smile,\r\nand pushed open the door above which were his arms, and which, as we\r\nhave said, opened into the salon. In the most conspicuous part of the\r\nsalon was another portrait. It was that of a man, from five to\r\neight-and-thirty, in the uniform of a general officer, wearing the\r\ndouble epaulet of heavy bullion, that indicates superior rank, the\r\nribbon of the Legion of Honor around his neck, which showed he was a\r\ncommander, and on the right breast, the star of a grand officer of the\r\norder of the Saviour, and on the left that of the grand cross of\r\nCharles III., which proved that the person represented by the picture\r\nhad served in the wars of Greece and Spain, or, what was just the same\r\nthing as regarded decorations, had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in\r\nthe two countries.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care\r\nthan he had bestowed upon the other, when another door opened, and he\r\nfound himself opposite to the Count of Morcerf in person.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of forty to forty-five years, but he seemed at least\r\nfifty, and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with\r\nhis almost white hair, which was cut short, in the military fashion. He\r\nwas dressed in plain clothes, and wore at his button-hole the ribbons\r\nof the different orders to which he belonged.\r\n\r\nHe entered with a tolerably dignified step, and some little haste.\r\nMonte Cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step.\r\nIt seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground, and his eyes on the\r\nCount of Morcerf.\r\n\r\n“Father,” said the young man, “I have the honor of presenting to you\r\nthe Count of Monte Cristo, the generous friend whom I had the good\r\nfortune to meet in the critical situation of which I have told you.”\r\n\r\n“You are most welcome, monsieur,” said the Count of Morcerf, saluting\r\nMonte Cristo with a smile, “and monsieur has rendered our house, in\r\npreserving its only heir, a service which insures him our eternal\r\ngratitude.”\r\n\r\nAs he said these words, the count of Morcerf pointed to a chair, while\r\nhe seated himself in another opposite the window.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo, in taking the seat Morcerf offered him, placed himself in\r\nsuch a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet\r\ncurtains, and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a\r\nwhole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“The countess,” said Morcerf, “was at her toilet when she was informed\r\nof the visit she was about to receive. She will, however, be in the\r\nsalon in ten minutes.”\r\n\r\n“It is a great honor to me,” returned Monte Cristo, “to be thus, on the\r\nfirst day of my arrival in Paris, brought in contact with a man whose\r\nmerit equals his reputation, and to whom fortune has for once been\r\nequitable, but has she not still on the plains of Mitidja, or in the\r\nmountains of Atlas, a marshal’s staff to offer you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” replied Morcerf, reddening slightly, “I have left the service,\r\nmonsieur. Made a peer at the Restoration, I served through the first\r\ncampaign under the orders of Marshal Bourmont. I could, therefore,\r\nexpect a higher rank, and who knows what might have happened had the\r\nelder branch remained on the throne? But the Revolution of July was, it\r\nseems, sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful, and it\r\nwas so for all services that did not date from the imperial period. I\r\ntendered my resignation, for when you have gained your epaulets on the\r\nbattle-field, you do not know how to manœuvre on the slippery grounds\r\nof the salons. I have hung up my sword, and cast myself into politics.\r\nI have devoted myself to industry; I study the useful arts. During the\r\ntwenty years I served, I often wished to do so, but I had not the\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“These are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other,”\r\nreturned Monte Cristo. “A gentleman of high birth, possessor of an\r\nample fortune, you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure\r\nsoldier, step by step—this is uncommon; then become general, peer of\r\nFrance, commander of the Legion of Honor, you consent to again commence\r\na second apprenticeship, without any other hope or any other desire\r\nthan that of one day becoming useful to your fellow-creatures; this,\r\nindeed, is praiseworthy,—nay, more, it is sublime.”\r\n\r\n20265m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbert looked on and listened with astonishment; he was not used to see\r\nMonte Cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“Alas,” continued the stranger, doubtless to dispel the slight cloud\r\nthat covered Morcerf’s brow, “we do not act thus in Italy; we grow\r\naccording to our race and our species, and we pursue the same lines,\r\nand often the same uselessness, all our lives.”\r\n\r\n“But, monsieur,” said the Count of Morcerf, “for a man of your merit,\r\nItaly is not a country, and France opens her arms to receive you;\r\nrespond to her call. France will not, perhaps, be always ungrateful.\r\nShe treats her children ill, but she always welcomes strangers.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, father,” said Albert with a smile, “it is evident you do not know\r\nthe Count of Monte Cristo; he despises all honors, and contents himself\r\nwith those written on his passport.”\r\n\r\n“That is the most just remark,” replied the stranger, “I ever heard\r\nmade concerning myself.”\r\n\r\n“You have been free to choose your career,” observed the Count of\r\nMorcerf, with a sigh; “and you have chosen the path strewed with\r\nflowers.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely, monsieur,” replied Monte Cristo with one of those smiles\r\nthat a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze.\r\n\r\n“If I did not fear to fatigue you,” said the general, evidently charmed\r\nwith the count’s manners, “I would have taken you to the Chamber; there\r\nis a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern\r\nsenators.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be most grateful, monsieur, if you will, at some future time,\r\nrenew your offer, but I have been flattered with the hope of being\r\nintroduced to the countess, and I will therefore wait.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, here is my mother,” cried the viscount.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo, turned round hastily, and saw Madame de Morcerf at the\r\nentrance of the salon, at the door opposite to that by which her\r\nhusband had entered, pale and motionless; when Monte Cristo turned\r\nround, she let fall her arm, which for some unknown reason had been\r\nresting on the gilded door-post. She had been there some moments, and\r\nhad heard the last words of the visitor. The latter rose and bowed to\r\nthe countess, who inclined herself without speaking.\r\n\r\n“Ah! good heavens, madame,” said the count, “are you ill, or is it the\r\nheat of the room that affects you?”\r\n\r\n“Are you ill, mother?” cried the viscount, springing towards her.\r\n\r\nShe thanked them both with a smile.\r\n\r\n“No,” returned she, “but I feel some emotion on seeing, for the first\r\ntime, the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears\r\nand desolation. Monsieur,” continued the countess, advancing with the\r\nmajesty of a queen, “I owe to you the life of my son, and for this I\r\nbless you. Now, I thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus\r\naffording me the opportunity of thanking you as I have blessed you,\r\nfrom the bottom of my heart.”\r\n\r\nThe count bowed again, but lower than before; he was even paler than\r\nMercédès.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said he, “the count and yourself recompense too generously a\r\nsimple action. To save a man, to spare a father’s feelings, or a\r\nmother’s sensibility, is not to do a good action, but a simple deed of\r\nhumanity.”\r\n\r\nAt these words, uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and\r\npoliteness, Madame de Morcerf replied:\r\n\r\n“It is very fortunate for my son, monsieur, that he found such a\r\nfriend, and I thank God that things are thus.”\r\n\r\nAnd Mercédès raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an\r\nexpression of gratitude, that the count fancied he saw tears in them.\r\nM. de Morcerf approached her.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said he. “I have already made my excuses to the count for\r\nquitting him, and I pray you to do so also. The sitting commences at\r\ntwo; it is now three, and I am to speak.”\r\n\r\n“Go, then, and monsieur and I will strive our best to forget your\r\nabsence,” replied the countess, with the same tone of deep feeling.\r\n“Monsieur,” continued she, turning to Monte Cristo, “will you do us the\r\nhonor of passing the rest of the day with us?”\r\n\r\n“Believe me, madame, I feel most grateful for your kindness, but I got\r\nout of my travelling carriage at your door this morning, and I am\r\nignorant how I am installed in Paris, which I scarcely know; this is\r\nbut a trifling inquietude, I know, but one that may be appreciated.”\r\n\r\n“We shall have the pleasure another time,” said the countess; “you\r\npromise that?”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo inclined himself without answering, but the gesture might\r\npass for assent.\r\n\r\n“I will not detain you, monsieur,” continued the countess; “I would not\r\nhave our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Count,” said Albert, “I will endeavor to return your\r\npoliteness at Rome, and place my coupé at your disposal until your own\r\nbe ready.”\r\n\r\n“A thousand thanks for your kindness, viscount,” returned the Count of\r\nMonte Cristo “but I suppose that M. Bertuccio has suitably employed the\r\nfour hours and a half I have given him, and that I shall find a\r\ncarriage of some sort ready at the door.”\r\n\r\nAlbert was used to the count’s manner of proceeding; he knew that, like\r\nNero, he was in search of the impossible, and nothing astonished him,\r\nbut wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the count’s orders had\r\nbeen executed, he accompanied him to the door of the house. Monte\r\nCristo was not deceived. As soon as he appeared in the Count of\r\nMorcerf’s antechamber, a footman, the same who at Rome had brought the\r\ncount’s card to the two young men, and announced his visit, sprang into\r\nthe vestibule, and when he arrived at the door the illustrious\r\ntraveller found his carriage awaiting him. It was a _coupé_ of Koller’s\r\nbuilding, and with horses and harness for which Drake had, to the\r\nknowledge of all the lions of Paris, refused on the previous day seven\r\nhundred guineas.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the count to Albert, “I do not ask you to accompany me\r\nto my house, as I can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry,\r\nand I have, as you know, a reputation to keep up as regards not being\r\ntaken by surprise. Give me, therefore, one more day before I invite\r\nyou; I shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality.”\r\n\r\n“If you ask me for a day, count, I know what to anticipate; it will not\r\nbe a house I shall see, but a palace. You have decidedly some genius at\r\nyour control.”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, spread that idea,” replied the Count of Monte Cristo,\r\nputting his foot on the velvet-lined steps of his splendid carriage,\r\n“and that will be worth something to me among the ladies.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he sprang into the vehicle, the door was closed, but not\r\nso rapidly that Monte Cristo failed to perceive the almost\r\nimperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in\r\nwhich he had left Madame de Morcerf.\r\n\r\nWhen Albert returned to his mother, he found her in the boudoir\r\nreclining in a large velvet armchair, the whole room so obscure that\r\nonly the shining spangle, fastened here and there to the drapery, and\r\nthe angles of the gilded frames of the pictures, showed with some\r\ndegree of brightness in the gloom. Albert could not see the face of the\r\ncountess, as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head,\r\nand which fell over her features in misty folds, but it seemed to him\r\nas though her voice had altered. He could distinguish amid the perfumes\r\nof the roses and heliotropes in the flower-stands, the sharp and\r\nfragrant odor of volatile salts, and he noticed in one of the chased\r\ncups on the mantle-piece the countess’s smelling-bottle, taken from its\r\nshagreen case, and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness, as he entered:\r\n\r\n“My dear mother, have you been ill during my absence?”\r\n\r\n“No, no, Albert, but you know these roses, tuberoses, and\r\norange-flowers throw out at first, before one is used to them, such\r\nviolent perfumes.”\r\n\r\n“Then, my dear mother,” said Albert, putting his hand to the bell,\r\n“they must be taken into the antechamber. You are really ill, and just\r\nnow were so pale as you came into the room——”\r\n\r\n“Was I pale, Albert?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; a pallor that suits you admirably, mother, but which did not the\r\nless alarm my father and myself.”\r\n\r\n“Did your father speak of it?” inquired Mercédès eagerly.\r\n\r\n“No, madame; but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you?”\r\n\r\n20269m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do remember,” replied the countess.\r\n\r\nA servant entered, summoned by Albert’s ring of the bell.\r\n\r\n“Take these flowers into the anteroom or dressing-room,” said the\r\nviscount; “they make the countess ill.”\r\n\r\nThe footman obeyed his orders. A long pause ensued, which lasted until\r\nall the flowers were removed.\r\n\r\n“What is this name of Monte Cristo?” inquired the countess, when the\r\nservant had taken away the last vase of flowers, “is it a family name,\r\nor the name of the estate, or a simple title?”\r\n\r\n“I believe, mother, it is merely a title. The count purchased an island\r\nin the Tuscan archipelago, and, as he told you today, has founded a\r\ncommandery. You know the same thing was done for Saint Stephen of\r\nFlorence, Saint George Constantinian of Parma, and even for the Order\r\nof Malta. Except this, he has no pretension to nobility, and calls\r\nhimself a chance count, although the general opinion at Rome is that\r\nthe count is a man of very high distinction.”\r\n\r\n“His manners are admirable,” said the countess, “at least, as far as I\r\ncould judge in the few minutes he remained here.”\r\n\r\n“They are perfect mother, so perfect, that they surpass by far all I\r\nhave known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities\r\nof Europe—the English, the Spanish, and the German.”\r\n\r\nThe countess paused a moment; then, after a slight hesitation, she\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\n“You have seen, my dear Albert—I ask the question as a mother—you have\r\nseen M. de Monte Cristo in his house, you are quicksighted, have much\r\nknowledge of the world, more tact than is usual at your age, do you\r\nthink the count is really what he appears to be?”\r\n\r\n“What does he appear to be?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you have just said,—a man of high distinction.”\r\n\r\n“I told you, my dear mother, he was esteemed such.”\r\n\r\n“But what is your own opinion, Albert?”\r\n\r\n“I must tell you that I have not come to any decided opinion respecting\r\nhim, but I think him a Maltese.”\r\n\r\n“I do not ask you of his origin but what he is.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! what he is; that is quite another thing. I have seen so many\r\nremarkable things in him, that if you would have me really say what I\r\nthink, I shall reply that I really do look upon him as one of Byron’s\r\nheroes, whom misery has marked with a fatal brand; some Manfred, some\r\nLara, some Werner, one of those wrecks, as it were, of some ancient\r\nfamily, who, disinherited of their patrimony, have achieved one by the\r\nforce of their adventurous genius, which has placed them above the laws\r\nof society.”\r\n\r\n“You say——”\r\n\r\n“I say that Monte Cristo is an island in the midst of the\r\nMediterranean, without inhabitants or garrison, the resort of smugglers\r\nof all nations, and pirates of every flag. Who knows whether or not\r\nthese industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues\r\nfor his protection?”\r\n\r\n“That is possible,” said the countess, reflecting.\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” continued the young man, “smuggler or not, you must\r\nagree, mother dear, as you have seen him, that the Count of Monte\r\nCristo is a remarkable man, who will have the greatest success in the\r\nsalons of Paris. Why, this very morning, in my rooms, he made his\r\n_entrée_ amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement, not\r\neven excepting Château-Renaud.”\r\n\r\n“And what do you suppose is the count’s age?” inquired Mercédès,\r\nevidently attaching great importance to this question.\r\n\r\n“Thirty-five or thirty-six, mother.”\r\n\r\n“So young,—it is impossible,” said Mercédès, replying at the same time\r\nto what Albert said as well as to her own private reflection.\r\n\r\n“It is the truth, however. Three or four times he has said to me, and\r\ncertainly without the slightest premeditation, ‘at such a period I was\r\nfive years old, at another ten years old, at another twelve,’ and I,\r\ninduced by curiosity, which kept me alive to these details, have\r\ncompared the dates, and never found him inaccurate. The age of this\r\nsingular man, who is of no age, is then, I am certain, thirty-five.\r\nBesides, mother, remark how vivid his eye, how raven-black his hair,\r\nand his brow, though so pale, is free from wrinkles,—he is not only\r\nvigorous, but also young.”\r\n\r\nThe countess bent her head, as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n“And has this man displayed a friendship for you, Albert?” she asked\r\nwith a nervous shudder.\r\n\r\n“I am inclined to think so.”\r\n\r\n“And—do—you—like—him?”\r\n\r\n“Why, he pleases me in spite of Franz d’Épinay, who tries to convince\r\nme that he is a being returned from the other world.”\r\n\r\nThe countess shuddered.\r\n\r\n“Albert,” she said, in a voice which was altered by emotion, “I have\r\nalways put you on your guard against new acquaintances. Now you are a\r\nman, and are able to give me advice; yet I repeat to you, Albert, be\r\nprudent.”\r\n\r\n“Why, my dear mother, it is necessary, in order to make your advice\r\nturn to account, that I should know beforehand what I have to distrust.\r\nThe count never plays, he only drinks pure water tinged with a little\r\nsherry, and is so rich that he cannot, without intending to laugh at\r\nme, try to borrow money. What, then, have I to fear from him?”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said the countess, “and my fears are weakness,\r\nespecially when directed against a man who has saved your life. How did\r\nyour father receive him, Albert? It is necessary that we should be more\r\nthan complaisant to the count. M. de Morcerf is sometimes occupied, his\r\nbusiness makes him reflective, and he might, without intending it——”\r\n\r\n“Nothing could be in better taste than my father’s demeanor, madame,”\r\nsaid Albert; “nay, more, he seemed greatly flattered at two or three\r\ncompliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with\r\nas much ease as if he had known him these thirty years. Each of these\r\nlittle tickling arrows must have pleased my father,” added Albert with\r\na laugh. “And thus they parted the best possible friends, and M. de\r\nMorcerf even wished to take him to the Chamber to hear the speakers.”\r\n\r\nThe countess made no reply. She fell into so deep a reverie that her\r\neyes gradually closed. The young man, standing up before her, gazed\r\nupon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing\r\nwith children whose mothers are still young and handsome. Then, after\r\nseeing her eyes closed, and hearing her breathe gently, he believed she\r\nhad dropped asleep, and left the apartment on tiptoe, closing the door\r\nafter him with the utmost precaution.\r\n\r\n“This devil of a fellow,” he muttered, shaking his head; “I said at the\r\ntime he would create a sensation here, and I measure his effect by an\r\ninfallible thermometer. My mother has noticed him, and he must\r\ntherefore, perforce, be remarkable.”\r\n\r\nHe went down to the stables, not without some slight annoyance, when he\r\nremembered that the Count of Monte Cristo had laid his hands on a\r\n“turnout” which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of\r\nconnoisseurs.\r\n\r\n“Most decidedly,” said he, “men are not equal, and I must beg my father\r\nto develop this theorem in the Chamber of Peers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 42. Monsieur Bertuccio\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the count had arrived at his house; it had taken him six\r\nminutes to perform the distance, but these six minutes were sufficient\r\nto induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had\r\nbeen unable to purchase themselves, to put their horses in a gallop in\r\norder to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20,000 francs\r\napiece for his horses.\r\n\r\nThe house Ali had chosen, and which was to serve as a town residence to\r\nMonte Cristo, was situated on the right hand as you ascend the\r\nChamps-Élysées. A thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre,\r\nand masked a portion of the front; around this shrubbery two alleys,\r\nlike two arms, extended right and left, and formed a carriage-drive\r\nfrom the iron gates to a double portico, on every step of which stood a\r\nporcelain vase, filled with flowers. This house, isolated from the\r\nrest, had, besides the main entrance, another in the Rue de Ponthieu.\r\nEven before the coachman had hailed the _concierge_, the massy gates\r\nrolled on their hinges—they had seen the Count coming, and at Paris, as\r\neverywhere else, he was served with the rapidity of lightning. The\r\ncoachman entered and traversed the half-circle without slackening his\r\nspeed, and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on\r\nthe gravel. The carriage stopped at the left side of the portico, two\r\nmen presented themselves at the carriage-window; the one was Ali, who,\r\nsmiling with an expression of the most sincere joy, seemed amply repaid\r\nby a mere look from Monte Cristo. The other bowed respectfully, and\r\noffered his arm to assist the count in descending.\r\n\r\n“Thanks, M. Bertuccio,” said the count, springing lightly up the three\r\nsteps of the portico; “and the notary?”\r\n\r\n“He is in the small salon, excellency,” returned Bertuccio.\r\n\r\n“And the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number\r\nof the house?”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency, it is done already. I have been myself to the best\r\nengraver of the Palais Royal, who did the plate in my presence. The\r\nfirst card struck off was taken, according to your orders, to the Baron\r\nDanglars, Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin, No. 7; the others are on the\r\nmantle-piece of your excellency’s bedroom.”\r\n\r\n“Good; what o’clock is it?”\r\n\r\n“Four o’clock.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo gave his hat, cane, and gloves to the same French footman\r\nwho had called his carriage at the Count of Morcerf’s, and then he\r\npassed into the small salon, preceded by Bertuccio, who showed him the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n“These are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber,” said Monte\r\nCristo. “I trust all this will soon be taken away.”\r\n\r\nBertuccio bowed. As the steward had said, the notary awaited him in the\r\nsmall salon. He was a simple-looking lawyer’s clerk, elevated to the\r\nextraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener.\r\n\r\n“You are the notary empowered to sell the country house that I wish to\r\npurchase, monsieur?” asked Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Yes, count,” returned the notary.\r\n\r\n“Is the deed of sale ready?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, count.”\r\n\r\n“Have you brought it?”\r\n\r\n“Here it is.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; and where is this house that I purchase?” asked the count\r\ncarelessly, addressing himself half to Bertuccio, half to the notary.\r\nThe steward made a gesture that signified, “I do not know.” The notary\r\nlooked at the count with astonishment.\r\n\r\n“What!” said he, “does not the count know where the house he purchases\r\nis situated?”\r\n\r\n“No,” returned the count.\r\n\r\n“The count does not know?”\r\n\r\n“How should I know? I have arrived from Cadiz this morning. I have\r\nnever before been at Paris, and it is the first time I have ever even\r\nset my foot in France.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that is different; the house you purchase is at Auteuil.”\r\n\r\nAt these words Bertuccio turned pale.\r\n\r\n“And where is Auteuil?” asked the count.\r\n\r\n“Close by here, monsieur,” replied the notary—“a little beyond Passy; a\r\ncharming situation, in the heart of the Bois de Boulogne.”\r\n\r\n“So near as that?” said the Count; “but that is not in the country.\r\nWhat made you choose a house at the gates of Paris, M. Bertuccio?”\r\n\r\n“I,” cried the steward with a strange expression. “His excellency did\r\nnot charge me to purchase this house. If his excellency will\r\nrecollect—if he will think——”\r\n\r\n“Ah, true,” observed Monte Cristo; “I recollect now. I read the\r\nadvertisement in one of the papers, and was tempted by the false title,\r\n‘a country house.’”\r\n\r\n“It is not yet too late,” cried Bertuccio, eagerly; “and if your\r\nexcellency will intrust me with the commission, I will find you a\r\nbetter at Enghien, at Fontenay-aux-Roses, or at Bellevue.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” returned Monte Cristo negligently; “since I have this, I will\r\nkeep it.”\r\n\r\n“And you are quite right,” said the notary, who feared to lose his fee.\r\n“It is a charming place, well supplied with spring-water and fine\r\ntrees; a comfortable habitation, although abandoned for a long time,\r\nwithout reckoning the furniture, which, although old, is yet valuable,\r\nnow that old things are so much sought after. I suppose the count has\r\nthe tastes of the day?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” returned Monte Cristo; “it is very convenient, then?”\r\n\r\n“It is more—it is magnificent.”\r\n\r\n“_Peste!_ let us not lose such an opportunity,” returned Monte Cristo.\r\n“The deed, if you please, Mr. Notary.”\r\n\r\nAnd he signed it rapidly, after having first run his eye over that part\r\nof the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the\r\nnames of the proprietors.\r\n\r\n“Bertuccio,” said he, “give fifty-five thousand francs to monsieur.”\r\n\r\nThe steward left the room with a faltering step, and returned with a\r\nbundle of bank-notes, which the notary counted like a man who never\r\ngives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there.\r\n\r\n“And now,” demanded the count, “are all the forms complied with?”\r\n\r\n“All, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Have you the keys?”\r\n\r\n“They are in the hands of the concierge, who takes care of the house,\r\nbut here is the order I have given him to install the count in his new\r\npossessions.”\r\n\r\n“Very well;” and Monte Cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary,\r\nwhich said, “I have no further need of you; you may go.”\r\n\r\n“But,” observed the honest notary, “the count is, I think, mistaken; it\r\nis only fifty thousand francs, everything included.”\r\n\r\n“And your fee?”\r\n\r\n“Is included in this sum.”\r\n\r\n“But have you not come from Auteuil here?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of\r\ntime and trouble,” said the count; and he made a gesture of polite\r\ndismissal.\r\n\r\nThe notary left the room backwards, and bowing down to the ground; it\r\nwas the first time he had ever met a similar client.\r\n\r\n“See this gentleman out,” said the count to Bertuccio. And the steward\r\nfollowed the notary out of the room.\r\n\r\nScarcely was the count alone, when he drew from his pocket a book\r\nclosed with a lock, and opened it with a key which he wore round his\r\nneck, and which never left him. After having sought for a few minutes,\r\nhe stopped at a leaf which had several notes, and compared them with\r\nthe deed of sale, which lay on the table, and recalling his\r\n_souvenirs_—\r\n\r\n“‘Auteuil, Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28;’ it is indeed the same,” said\r\nhe; “and now, am I to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or\r\nphysical terror? However, in an hour I shall know all. Bertuccio!”\r\ncried he, striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong.\r\n“Bertuccio!”\r\n\r\nThe steward appeared at the door.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Bertuccio,” said the count, “did you never tell me that you\r\nhad travelled in France?”\r\n\r\n“In some parts of France—yes, excellency.”\r\n\r\n“You know the environs of Paris, then?”\r\n\r\n“No, excellency, no,” returned the steward, with a sort of nervous\r\ntrembling, which Monte Cristo, a connoisseur in all emotions, rightly\r\nattributed to great disquietude.\r\n\r\n“It is unfortunate,” returned he, “that you have never visited the\r\nenvirons, for I wish to see my new property this evening, and had you\r\ngone with me, you could have given me some useful information.”\r\n\r\n“To Auteuil!” cried Bertuccio, whose copper complexion became livid—“I\r\ngo to Auteuil?”\r\n\r\n“Well, what is there surprising in that? When I live at Auteuil, you\r\nmust come there, as you belong to my service.”\r\n\r\nBertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master,\r\nand remained motionless, without making any answer.\r\n\r\n“Why, what has happened to you?—are you going to make me ring a second\r\ntime for the carriage?” asked Monte Cristo, in the same tone that Louis\r\nXIV. pronounced the famous, “I have been almost obliged to wait.”\r\nBertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber, and cried in a hoarse\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n“His excellency’s horses!”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo wrote two or three notes, and, as he sealed the last, the\r\nsteward appeared.\r\n\r\n“Your excellency’s carriage is at the door,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Well, take your hat and gloves,” returned Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Am I to accompany you, your excellency?” cried Bertuccio.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, you must give the orders, for I intend residing at the\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\n20277m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was unexampled for a servant of the count’s to dare to dispute an\r\norder of his, so the steward, without saying a word, followed his\r\nmaster, who got into the carriage, and signed to him to follow, which\r\nhe did, taking his place respectfully on the front seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 43. The House at Auteuil\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo noticed, as they descended the staircase, that Bertuccio\r\nsigned himself in the Corsican manner; that is, had formed the sign of\r\nthe cross in the air with his thumb, and as he seated himself in the\r\ncarriage, muttered a short prayer. Anyone but a man of exhaustless\r\nthirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward’s\r\nextraordinary repugnance for the count’s projected drive without the\r\nwalls; but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this\r\nlittle journey. In twenty minutes they were at Auteuil; the steward’s\r\nemotion had continued to augment as they entered the village.\r\nBertuccio, crouched in the corner of the carriage, began to examine\r\nwith a feverish anxiety every house they passed.\r\n\r\n“Tell them to stop at Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28,” said the count,\r\nfixing his eyes on the steward, to whom he gave this order.\r\n\r\nBertuccio’s forehead was covered with perspiration; however, he obeyed,\r\nand, leaning out of the window, he cried to the coachman,—“Rue de la\r\nFontaine, No. 28.” No. 28 was situated at the extremity of the village;\r\nduring the drive night had set in, and darkness gave the surroundings\r\nthe artificial appearance of a scene on the stage. The carriage\r\nstopped, the footman sprang off the box and opened the door.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the count, “you do not get out, M. Bertuccio—you are going\r\nto stay in the carriage, then? What are you thinking of this evening?”\r\n\r\nBertuccio sprang out, and offered his shoulder to the count, who, this\r\ntime, leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage.\r\n\r\n“Knock,” said the count, “and announce me.”\r\n\r\nBertuccio knocked, the door opened, and the concierge appeared.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“It is your new master, my good fellow,” said the footman. And he held\r\nout to the concierge the notary’s order.\r\n\r\n“The house is sold, then?” demanded the concierge; “and this gentleman\r\nis coming to live here?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend,” returned the count; “and I will endeavor to give you\r\nno cause to regret your old master.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, monsieur,” said the concierge, “I shall not have much cause to\r\nregret him, for he came here but seldom; it is five years since he was\r\nhere last, and he did well to sell the house, for it did not bring him\r\nin anything at all.”\r\n\r\n“What was the name of your old master?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“The Marquis of Saint-Méran. Ah, I am sure he has not sold the house\r\nfor what he gave for it.”\r\n\r\n“The Marquis of Saint-Méran!” returned the count. “The name is not\r\nunknown to me; the Marquis of Saint-Méran!” and he appeared to\r\nmeditate.\r\n\r\n“An old gentleman,” continued the concierge, “a staunch follower of the\r\nBourbons; he had an only daughter, who married M. de Villefort, who had\r\nbeen the king’s attorney at Nîmes, and afterwards at Versailles.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo glanced at Bertuccio, who became whiter than the wall\r\nagainst which he leaned to prevent himself from falling.\r\n\r\n“And is not this daughter dead?” demanded Monte Cristo; “I fancy I have\r\nheard so.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur, one-and-twenty years ago; and since then we have not\r\nseen the poor marquis three times.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, thanks,” said Monte Cristo, judging from the steward’s utter\r\nprostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger\r\nof breaking it. “Give me a light.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I accompany you, monsieur?”\r\n\r\n“No, it is unnecessary; Bertuccio will show me a light.”\r\n\r\nAnd Monte Cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold\r\npieces, which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the\r\nconcierge.\r\n\r\n“Ah, monsieur,” said he, after having vainly searched on the\r\nmantle-piece and the shelves, “I have not got any candles.”\r\n\r\n“Take one of the carriage-lamps, Bertuccio,” said the count, “and show\r\nme the apartments.”\r\n\r\nThe steward obeyed in silence, but it was easy to see, from the manner\r\nin which the hand that held the light trembled, how much it cost him to\r\nobey. They went over a tolerably large ground floor; a first floor\r\nconsisted of a salon, a bathroom, and two bedrooms; near one of the\r\nbedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden.\r\n\r\n“Ah, here is a private staircase,” said the count; “that is convenient.\r\nLight me, M. Bertuccio, and go first; we will see where it leads to.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” replied Bertuccio, “it leads to the garden.”\r\n\r\n“And, pray, how do you know that?”\r\n\r\n“It ought to do so, at least.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let us be sure of that.”\r\n\r\nBertuccio sighed, and went on first; the stairs did, indeed, lead to\r\nthe garden. At the outer door the steward paused.\r\n\r\n“Go on, Monsieur Bertuccio,” said the count.\r\n\r\nBut he who was addressed stood there, stupefied, bewildered, stunned;\r\nhis haggard eyes glanced around, as if in search of the traces of some\r\nterrible event, and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut\r\nout horrible recollections.\r\n\r\n“Well!” insisted the Count.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” cried Bertuccio, setting down the lantern at the angle of the\r\ninterior wall. “No, monsieur, it is impossible; I can go no farther.”\r\n\r\n“What does this mean?” demanded the irresistible voice of Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Why, you must see, your excellency,” cried the steward, “that this is\r\nnot natural; that, having a house to purchase, you purchase it exactly\r\nat Auteuil, and that, purchasing it at Auteuil, this house should be\r\nNo. 28, Rue de la Fontaine. Oh, why did I not tell you all? I am sure\r\nyou would not have forced me to come. I hoped your house would have\r\nbeen some other one than this; as if there was not another house at\r\nAuteuil than that of the assassination!”\r\n\r\n“What, what!” cried Monte Cristo, stopping suddenly, “what words do you\r\nutter? Devil of a man, Corsican that you are—always mysteries or\r\nsuperstitions. Come, take the lantern, and let us visit the garden; you\r\nare not afraid of ghosts with me, I hope?”\r\n\r\nBertuccio raised the lantern, and obeyed. The door, as it opened,\r\ndisclosed a gloomy sky, in which the moon strove vainly to struggle\r\nthrough a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which\r\nshe illumined for an instant, only to sink into obscurity. The steward\r\nwished to turn to the left.\r\n\r\n“No, no, monsieur,” said Monte Cristo. “What is the use of following\r\nthe alleys? Here is a beautiful lawn; let us go on straight forwards.”\r\n\r\nBertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow, but obeyed; however, he\r\ncontinued to take the left hand. Monte Cristo, on the contrary, took\r\nthe right hand; arrived near a clump of trees, he stopped. The steward\r\ncould not restrain himself.\r\n\r\n“Move, monsieur—move away, I entreat you; you are exactly in the spot!”\r\n\r\n“What spot?”\r\n\r\n“Where he fell.”\r\n\r\n20281m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“My dear Monsieur Bertuccio,” said Monte Cristo, laughing, “control\r\nyourself; we are not at Sartène or at Corte. This is not a Corsican\r\n_maquis_ but an English garden; badly kept, I own, but still you must\r\nnot calumniate it for that.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, I implore you do not stay there!”\r\n\r\n“I think you are going mad, Bertuccio,” said the count coldly. “If that\r\nis the case, I warn you, I shall have you put in a lunatic asylum.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! excellency,” returned Bertuccio, joining his hands, and shaking\r\nhis head in a manner that would have excited the count’s laughter, had\r\nnot thoughts of a superior interest occupied him, and rendered him\r\nattentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience. “Alas!\r\nexcellency, the evil has arrived!”\r\n\r\n“M. Bertuccio,” said the count, “I am very glad to tell you, that while\r\nyou gesticulate, you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man\r\npossessed by a devil who will not leave him; and I have always\r\nobserved, that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret. I\r\nknew you were a Corsican. I knew you were gloomy, and always brooding\r\nover some old history of the vendetta; and I overlooked that in Italy,\r\nbecause in Italy those things are thought nothing of. But in France\r\nthey are considered in very bad taste; there are gendarmes who occupy\r\nthemselves with such affairs, judges who condemn, and scaffolds which\r\navenge.”\r\n\r\nBertuccio clasped his hands, and as, in all these evolutions, he did\r\nnot let fall the lantern, the light showed his pale and altered\r\ncountenance. Monte Cristo examined him with the same look that, at\r\nRome, he had bent upon the execution of Andrea, and then, in a tone\r\nthat made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward—\r\n\r\n“The Abbé Busoni, then told me an untruth,” said he, “when, after his\r\njourney in France, in 1829, he sent you to me, with a letter of\r\nrecommendation, in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities.\r\nWell, I shall write to the abbé; I shall hold him responsible for his\r\n_protégé’s_ misconduct, and I shall soon know all about this\r\nassassination. Only I warn you, that when I reside in a country, I\r\nconform to all its code, and I have no wish to put myself within the\r\ncompass of the French laws for your sake.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, do not do that, excellency; I have always served you faithfully,”\r\ncried Bertuccio, in despair. “I have always been an honest man, and, as\r\nfar as lay in my power, I have done good.”\r\n\r\n“I do not deny it,” returned the count; “but why are you thus agitated.\r\nIt is a bad sign; a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in\r\nthe cheeks, and such fever in the hands of a man.”\r\n\r\n“But, your excellency,” replied Bertuccio hesitatingly, “did not the\r\nAbbé Busoni, who heard my confession in the prison at Nîmes, tell you\r\nthat I had a heavy burden upon my conscience?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but as he said you would make an excellent steward, I concluded\r\nyou had stolen—that was all.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, your excellency!” returned Bertuccio in deep contempt.\r\n\r\n“Or, as you are a Corsican, that you had been unable to resist the\r\ndesire of making a ‘stiff,’ as you call it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my good master,” cried Bertuccio, casting himself at the count’s\r\nfeet, “it was simply vengeance—nothing else.”\r\n\r\n“I understand that, but I do not understand what it is that galvanizes\r\nyou in this manner.”\r\n\r\n“But, monsieur, it is very natural,” returned Bertuccio, “since it was\r\nin this house that my vengeance was accomplished.”\r\n\r\n“What! my house?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, your excellency, it was not yours, then.”\r\n\r\n“Whose, then? The Marquis de Saint-Méran, I think, the concierge said.\r\nWhat had you to revenge on the Marquis de Saint-Méran?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it was not on him, monsieur; it was on another.”\r\n\r\n“This is strange,” returned Monte Cristo, seeming to yield to his\r\nreflections, “that you should find yourself without any preparation in\r\na house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the steward, “it is fatality, I am sure. First, you\r\npurchase a house at Auteuil—this house is the one where I have\r\ncommitted an assassination; you descend to the garden by the same\r\nstaircase by which he descended; you stop at the spot where he received\r\nthe blow; and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just\r\nburied his child. This is not chance, for chance, in this case, is too\r\nmuch like Providence.”\r\n\r\n“Well, amiable Corsican, let us suppose it is Providence. I always\r\nsuppose anything people please, and, besides, you must concede\r\nsomething to diseased minds. Come, collect yourself, and tell me all.”\r\n\r\n“I have related it but once, and that was to the Abbé Busoni. Such\r\nthings,” continued Bertuccio, shaking his head, “are only related under\r\nthe seal of confession.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said the count, “I refer you to your confessor. Turn Chartreux\r\nor Trappist, and relate your secrets, but, as for me, I do not like\r\nanyone who is alarmed by such phantasms, and I do not choose that my\r\nservants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening. I\r\nconfess I am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of\r\npolice, for, in Italy, justice is only paid when silent—in France she\r\nis paid only when she speaks. _Peste!_ I thought you somewhat Corsican,\r\na great deal smuggler, and an excellent steward; but I see you have\r\nother strings to your bow. You are no longer in my service, Monsieur\r\nBertuccio.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, your excellency, your excellency!” cried the steward, struck with\r\nterror at this threat, “if that is the only reason I cannot remain in\r\nyour service, I will tell all, for if I quit you, it will only be to go\r\nto the scaffold.”\r\n\r\n“That is different,” replied Monte Cristo; “but if you intend to tell\r\nan untruth, reflect it were better not to speak at all.”\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur, I swear to you, by my hopes of salvation, I will tell\r\nyou all, for the Abbé Busoni himself only knew a part of my secret;\r\nbut, I pray you, go away from that plane-tree. The moon is just\r\nbursting through the clouds, and there, standing where you do, and\r\nwrapped in that cloak that conceals your figure, you remind me of M. de\r\nVillefort.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Monte Cristo, “it was M. de Villefort?”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency knows him?”\r\n\r\n“The former royal attorney at Nîmes?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Who married the Marquis of Saint-Méran’s daughter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe, the most upright,\r\nthe most rigid magistrate on the bench?”\r\n\r\n“Well, monsieur,” said Bertuccio, “this man with this spotless\r\nreputation——”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Was a villain.”\r\n\r\n“Bah,” replied Monte Cristo, “impossible!”\r\n\r\n“It is as I tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, really,” said Monte Cristo. “Have you proof of this?”\r\n\r\n“I had it.”\r\n\r\n“And you have lost it; how stupid!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but by careful search it might be recovered.”\r\n\r\n“Really,” returned the count, “relate it to me, for it begins to\r\ninterest me.”\r\n\r\nAnd the count, humming an air from _Lucia_, went to sit down on a\r\nbench, while Bertuccio followed him, collecting his thoughts. Bertuccio\r\nremained standing before him.\r\n\r\n20285m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 44. The Vendetta\r\n\r\nAt what point shall I begin my story, your excellency?” asked\r\nBertuccio.\r\n\r\n“Where you please,” returned Monte Cristo, “since I know nothing at all\r\nof it.”\r\n\r\n“I thought the Abbé Busoni had told your excellency.”\r\n\r\n“Some particulars, doubtless, but that is seven or eight years ago, and\r\nI have forgotten them.”\r\n\r\n“Then I can speak without fear of tiring your excellency.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, M. Bertuccio; you will supply the want of the evening papers.”\r\n\r\n“The story begins in 1815.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Monte Cristo, “1815 is not yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur, and yet I recollect all things as clearly as if they had\r\nhappened but then. I had a brother, an elder brother, who was in the\r\nservice of the emperor; he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed\r\nentirely of Corsicans. This brother was my only friend; we became\r\norphans—I at five, he at eighteen. He brought me up as if I had been\r\nhis son, and in 1814 he married. When the emperor returned from the\r\nIsland of Elba, my brother instantly joined the army, was slightly\r\nwounded at Waterloo, and retired with the army beyond the Loire.”\r\n\r\n“But that is the history of the Hundred Days, M. Bertuccio,” said the\r\ncount; “unless I am mistaken, it has been already written.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, excellency, but these details are necessary, and you\r\npromised to be patient.”\r\n\r\n“Go on; I will keep my word.”\r\n\r\n“One day we received a letter. I should tell you that we lived in the\r\nlittle village of Rogliano, at the extremity of Cap Corse. This letter\r\nwas from my brother. He told us that the army was disbanded, and that\r\nhe should return by Châteauroux, Clermont-Ferrand, Le Puy, and Nîmes;\r\nand, if I had any money, he prayed me to leave it for him at Nîmes,\r\nwith an innkeeper with whom I had dealings.”\r\n\r\n“In the smuggling line?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Eh, your excellency? Everyone must live.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; go on.”\r\n\r\n“I loved my brother tenderly, as I told your excellency, and I resolved\r\nnot to send the money, but to take it to him myself. I possessed a\r\nthousand francs. I left five hundred with Assunta, my sister-in-law,\r\nand with the other five hundred I set off for Nîmes. It was easy to do\r\nso, and as I had my boat and a lading to take in at sea, everything\r\nfavored my project. But, after we had taken in our cargo, the wind\r\nbecame contrary, so that we were four or five days without being able\r\nto enter the Rhône. At last, however, we succeeded, and worked up to\r\nArles. I left the boat between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, and took the\r\nroad to Nîmes.”\r\n\r\n“We are getting to the story now?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your excellency; excuse me, but, as you will see, I only tell you\r\nwhat is absolutely necessary. Just at this time the famous massacres\r\ntook place in the south of France. Three brigands, called Trestaillon,\r\nTruphemy, and Graffan, publicly assassinated everybody whom they\r\nsuspected of Bonapartism. You have doubtless heard of these massacres,\r\nyour excellency?”\r\n\r\n“Vaguely; I was far from France at that period. Go on.”\r\n\r\n“As I entered Nîmes, I literally waded in blood; at every step you\r\nencountered dead bodies and bands of murderers, who killed, plundered,\r\nand burned. At the sight of this slaughter and devastation I became\r\nterrified, not for myself—for I, a simple Corsican fisherman, had\r\nnothing to fear; on the contrary, that time was most favorable for us\r\nsmugglers—but for my brother, a soldier of the empire, returning from\r\nthe army of the Loire, with his uniform and his epaulets, there was\r\neverything to apprehend. I hastened to the innkeeper. My misgivings had\r\nbeen but too true. My brother had arrived the previous evening at\r\nNîmes, and, at the very door of the house where he was about to demand\r\nhospitality, he had been assassinated. I did all in my power to\r\ndiscover the murderers, but no one durst tell me their names, so much\r\nwere they dreaded. I then thought of that French justice of which I had\r\nheard so much, and which feared nothing, and I went to the king’s\r\nattorney.”\r\n\r\n“And this king’s attorney was named Villefort?” asked Monte Cristo\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, your excellency; he came from Marseilles, where he had been\r\ndeputy procureur. His zeal had procured him advancement, and he was\r\nsaid to be one of the first who had informed the government of the\r\ndeparture from the Island of Elba.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Monte Cristo “you went to him?”\r\n\r\n“‘Monsieur,’ I said, ‘my brother was assassinated yesterday in the\r\nstreets of Nîmes, I know not by whom, but it is your duty to find out.\r\nYou are the representative of justice here, and it is for justice to\r\navenge those she has been unable to protect.’\r\n\r\n“‘Who was your brother?’ asked he.\r\n\r\n“‘A lieutenant in the Corsican battalion.’\r\n\r\n“‘A soldier of the usurper, then?’\r\n\r\n“‘A soldier of the French army.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ replied he, ‘he has smitten with the sword, and he has\r\nperished by the sword.’\r\n\r\n“‘You are mistaken, monsieur,’ I replied; ‘he has perished by the\r\nponiard.’\r\n\r\n“‘What do you want me to do?’ asked the magistrate.\r\n\r\n“‘I have already told you—avenge him.’\r\n\r\n“‘On whom?’\r\n\r\n“‘On his murderers.’\r\n\r\n“‘How should I know who they are?’\r\n\r\n“‘Order them to be sought for.’\r\n\r\n“‘Why, your brother has been involved in a quarrel, and killed in a\r\nduel. All these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in\r\nthe time of the emperor, but which are not suffered now, for the people\r\nhere do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct.’\r\n\r\n“‘Monsieur,’ I replied, ‘it is not for myself that I entreat your\r\ninterference—I should grieve for him or avenge him, but my poor brother\r\nhad a wife, and were anything to happen to me, the poor creature would\r\nperish from want, for my brother’s pay alone kept her. Pray, try and\r\nobtain a small government pension for her.’\r\n\r\n“‘Every revolution has its catastrophes,’ returned M. de Villefort;\r\n‘your brother has been the victim of this. It is a misfortune, and\r\ngovernment owes nothing to his family. If we are to judge by all the\r\nvengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans\r\nof the king, when, in their turn, they were in power, your brother\r\nwould be today, in all probability, condemned to death. What has\r\nhappened is quite natural, and in conformity with the law of\r\nreprisals.’\r\n\r\n“‘What,’ cried I, ‘do you, a magistrate, speak thus to me?’\r\n\r\n“‘All these Corsicans are mad, on my honor,’ replied M. de Villefort;\r\n‘they fancy that their countryman is still emperor. You have mistaken\r\nthe time, you should have told me this two months ago, it is too late\r\nnow. Go now, at once, or I shall have you put out.’\r\n\r\n“I looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from\r\nfurther entreaty. But he was a man of stone. I approached him, and said\r\nin a low voice, ‘Well, since you know the Corsicans so well, you know\r\nthat they always keep their word. You think that it was a good deed to\r\nkill my brother, who was a Bonapartist, because you are a royalist.\r\nWell, I, who am a Bonapartist also, declare one thing to you, which is,\r\nthat I will kill you. From this moment I declare the vendetta against\r\nyou, so protect yourself as well as you can, for the next time we meet\r\nyour last hour has come.’ And before he had recovered from his\r\nsurprise, I opened the door and left the room.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said Monte Cristo, “such an innocent looking person as\r\nyou are to do those things, M. Bertuccio, and to a king’s attorney at\r\nthat! But did he know what was meant by the terrible word ‘vendetta’?”\r\n\r\n“He knew so well, that from that moment he shut himself in his house,\r\nand never went out unattended, seeking me high and low. Fortunately, I\r\nwas so well concealed that he could not find me. Then he became\r\nalarmed, and dared not stay any longer at Nîmes, so he solicited a\r\nchange of residence, and, as he was in reality very influential, he was\r\nnominated to Versailles. But, as you know, a Corsican who has sworn to\r\navenge himself cares not for distance, so his carriage, fast as it\r\nwent, was never above half a day’s journey before me, who followed him\r\non foot. The most important thing was, not to kill him only—for I had\r\nan opportunity of doing so a hundred times—but to kill him without\r\nbeing discovered—at least, without being arrested. I no longer belonged\r\nto myself, for I had my sister-in-law to protect and provide for.\r\n\r\n“For three months I watched M. de Villefort, for three months he took\r\nnot a step out-of-doors without my following him. At length I\r\ndiscovered that he went mysteriously to Auteuil. I followed him\r\nthither, and I saw him enter the house where we now are, only, instead\r\nof entering by the great door that looks into the street, he came on\r\nhorseback, or in his carriage, left the one or the other at the little\r\ninn, and entered by the gate you see there.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in\r\nthe darkness the door to which Bertuccio alluded.\r\n\r\n“As I had nothing more to do at Versailles, I went to Auteuil, and\r\ngained all the information I could. If I wished to surprise him, it was\r\nevident this was the spot to lie in wait for him. The house belonged,\r\nas the concierge informed your excellency, to M. de Saint-Méran,\r\nVillefort’s father-in-law. M. de Saint-Méran lived at Marseilles, so\r\nthat this country house was useless to him, and it was reported to be\r\nlet to a young widow, known only by the name of ‘the Baroness.’\r\n\r\n“One evening, as I was looking over the wall, I saw a young and\r\nhandsome woman who was walking alone in that garden, which was not\r\noverlooked by any windows, and I guessed that she was awaiting M. de\r\nVillefort. When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her\r\nfeatures, I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen, tall and very fair.\r\nAs she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure,\r\nI saw she would ere long become a mother. A few moments after, the\r\nlittle door was opened and a man entered. The young woman hastened to\r\nmeet him. They threw themselves into each other’s arms, embraced\r\ntenderly, and returned together to the house. The man was M. de\r\nVillefort; I fully believed that when he went out in the night he would\r\nbe forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone.”\r\n\r\n20291m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“And,” asked the count, “did you ever know the name of this woman?”\r\n\r\n“No, excellency,” returned Bertuccio; “you will see that I had no time\r\nto learn it.”\r\n\r\n“Go on.”\r\n\r\n“That evening,” continued Bertuccio, “I could have killed the\r\nprocureur, but as I was not sufficiently acquainted with the\r\nneighborhood, I was fearful of not killing him on the spot, and that if\r\nhis cries were overheard I might be taken; so I put it off until the\r\nnext occasion, and in order that nothing should escape me, I took a\r\nchamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden.\r\nThree days after, about seven o’clock in the evening, I saw a servant\r\non horseback leave the house at full gallop, and take the road to\r\nSèvres. I concluded that he was going to Versailles, and I was not\r\ndeceived. Three hours later, the man returned covered with dust, his\r\nerrand was performed, and two minutes after, another man on foot,\r\nmuffled in a mantle, opened the little door of the garden, which he\r\nclosed after him. I descended rapidly; although I had not seen\r\nVillefort’s face, I recognized him by the beating of my heart. I\r\ncrossed the street, and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the\r\nwall, and by means of which I had once before looked into the garden.\r\n\r\n“This time I did not content myself with looking, but I took my knife\r\nout of my pocket, felt that the point was sharp, and sprang over the\r\nwall. My first care was to run to the door; he had left the key in it,\r\ntaking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock. Nothing,\r\nthen, preventing my escape by this means, I examined the grounds. The\r\ngarden was long and narrow; a stretch of smooth turf extended down the\r\nmiddle, and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy\r\nfoliage, that made a background for the shrubs and flowers. In order to\r\ngo from the door to the house, or from the house to the door, M. de\r\nVillefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees.\r\n\r\n20293m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It was the end of September; the wind blew violently. The faint\r\nglimpses of the pale moon, hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds\r\nthat were sweeping across the sky, whitened the gravel walks that led\r\nto the house, but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick\r\nshrubberies, in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of\r\ndiscovery. I hid myself in the one nearest to the path Villefort must\r\ntake, and scarcely was I there when, amidst the gusts of wind, I\r\nfancied I heard groans; but you know, or rather you do not know, your\r\nexcellency, that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies\r\nthat he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears. Two hours\r\npassed thus, during which I imagined I heard moans repeatedly. Midnight\r\nstruck. As the last stroke died away, I saw a faint light shine through\r\nthe windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended.\r\nThe door opened, and the man in the mantle reappeared.\r\n\r\n“The terrible moment had come, but I had so long been prepared for it\r\nthat my heart did not fail in the least. I drew my knife from my pocket\r\nagain, opened it, and made ready to strike. The man in the mantle\r\nadvanced towards me, but as he drew near I saw that he had a weapon in\r\nhis hand. I was afraid, not of a struggle, but of a failure. When he\r\nwas only a few paces from me, I saw that what I had taken for a weapon\r\nwas only a spade. I was still unable to divine for what reason M. de\r\nVillefort had this spade in his hands, when he stopped close to the\r\nthicket where I was, glanced round, and began to dig a hole in the\r\nearth. I then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle,\r\nwhich he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely. Then, I\r\nconfess, curiosity mingled with hatred; I wished to see what Villefort\r\nwas going to do there, and I remained motionless, holding my breath.\r\nThen an idea crossed my mind, which was confirmed when I saw the\r\nprocureur lift from under his mantle a box, two feet long, and six or\r\neight inches deep. I let him place the box in the hole he had made,\r\nthen, while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his\r\noccupation, I rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast,\r\nexclaiming:\r\n\r\n“‘I am Giovanni Bertuccio; thy death for my brother’s; thy treasure for\r\nhis widow; thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than I had\r\nhoped.’\r\n\r\n“I know not if he heard these words; I think he did not, for he fell\r\nwithout a cry. I felt his blood gush over my face, but I was\r\nintoxicated, I was delirious, and the blood refreshed, instead of\r\nburning me. In a second I had disinterred the box; then, that it might\r\nnot be known I had done so, I filled up the hole, threw the spade over\r\nthe wall, and rushed through the door, which I double-locked, carrying\r\noff the key.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Monte Cristo “it seems to me this was nothing but murder and\r\nrobbery.”\r\n\r\n“No, your excellency,” returned Bertuccio; “it was a vendetta followed\r\nby restitution.”\r\n\r\n“And was the sum a large one?”\r\n\r\n“It was not money.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I recollect,” replied the count; “did you not say something of an\r\ninfant?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, excellency; I hastened to the river, sat down on the bank, and\r\nwith my knife forced open the lock of the box. In a fine linen cloth\r\nwas wrapped a new-born child. Its purple visage, and its violet-colored\r\nhands showed that it had perished from suffocation, but as it was not\r\nyet cold, I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet.\r\nAfter a moment I fancied that I felt a slight pulsation of the heart,\r\nand as I had been assistant at the hospital at Bastia, I did what a\r\ndoctor would have done—I inflated the lungs by blowing air into them,\r\nand at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it began to breathe, and\r\ncried feebly. In my turn I uttered a cry, but a cry of joy.\r\n\r\n“‘God has not cursed me then,’ I cried, ‘since he permits me to save\r\nthe life of a human creature, in exchange for the life I have taken\r\naway.’”\r\n\r\n20295m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“And what did you do with the child?” asked Monte Cristo. “It was an\r\nembarrassing load for a man seeking to escape.”\r\n\r\n“I had not for a moment the idea of keeping it, but I knew that at\r\nParis there was an asylum where they receive such creatures. As I\r\npassed the city gates I declared that I had found the child on the\r\nroad, and I inquired where the asylum was; the box confirmed my\r\nstatement, the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy\r\nparents, the blood with which I was covered might have proceeded from\r\nthe child as well as from anyone else. No objection was raised, but\r\nthey pointed out the asylum, which was situated at the upper end of the\r\nRue d’Enfer, and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen\r\nin two pieces, so that one of the two letters which marked it was on\r\nthe piece wrapped around the child, while the other remained in my\r\npossession, I rang the bell, and fled with all speed. A fortnight after\r\nI was at Rogliano, and I said to Assunta:\r\n\r\n“‘Console thyself, sister; Israel is dead, but he is avenged.’\r\n\r\n“She demanded what I meant, and when I had told her all,—‘Giovanni,’\r\nsaid she, ‘you should have brought this child with you; we would have\r\nreplaced the parents it has lost, have called it Benedetto, and then,\r\nin consequence of this good action, God would have blessed us.’ In\r\nreply I gave her the half of the linen I had kept in order to reclaim\r\nhim if we became rich.”\r\n\r\n“What letters were marked on the linen?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“An H and an N, surmounted by a baron’s coronet.”\r\n\r\n“By heaven, M. Bertuccio, you make use of heraldic terms; where did you\r\nstudy heraldry?”\r\n\r\n“In your service, excellency, where everything is learned.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, I am curious to know two things.”\r\n\r\n“What are they, your excellency?”\r\n\r\n“What became of this little boy? for I think you told me it was a boy,\r\nM. Bertuccio.”\r\n\r\n“No excellency, I do not recollect telling you that.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you did; I must have been mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“No, you were not, for it was in reality a little boy. But your\r\nexcellency wished to know two things; what was the second?”\r\n\r\n“The second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for\r\na confessor, and the Abbé Busoni came to visit you at your request in\r\nthe prison at Nîmes.”\r\n\r\n“The story will be very long, excellency.”\r\n\r\n“What matter? you know I take but little sleep, and I do not suppose\r\nyou are very much inclined for it either.” Bertuccio bowed, and resumed\r\nhis story.\r\n\r\n“Partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me, partly\r\nto supply the wants of the poor widow, I eagerly returned to my trade\r\nof smuggler, which had become more easy since that relaxation of the\r\nlaws which always follows a revolution. The southern districts were\r\nill-watched in particular, in consequence of the disturbances that were\r\nperpetually breaking out in Avignon, Nîmes, or Uzès. We profited by\r\nthis respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere.\r\nSince my brother’s assassination in the streets of Nîmes, I had never\r\nentered the town; the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were\r\nconnected, seeing that we would no longer come to him, was forced to\r\ncome to us, and had established a branch to his inn, on the road from\r\nBellegarde to Beaucaire, at the sign of the Pont du Gard. We had thus,\r\nat Aigues-Mortes, Martigues, or Bouc, a dozen places where we left our\r\ngoods, and where, in case of necessity, we concealed ourselves from the\r\ngendarmes and custom-house officers. Smuggling is a profitable trade,\r\nwhen a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed; as for\r\nmyself, brought up in the mountains, I had a double motive for fearing\r\nthe gendarmes and custom-house officers, as my appearance before the\r\njudges would cause an inquiry, and an inquiry always looks back into\r\nthe past. And in my past life they might find something far more grave\r\nthan the selling of smuggled cigars, or barrels of brandy without a\r\npermit. So, preferring death to capture, I accomplished the most\r\nastonishing deeds, and which, more than once, showed me that the too\r\ngreat care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of\r\nthose projects which require rapid decision, and vigorous and\r\ndetermined execution. In reality, when you have once devoted your life\r\nto your enterprises, you are no longer the equal of other men, or,\r\nrather, other men are no longer your equals, and whosoever has taken\r\nthis resolution, feels his strength and resources doubled.”\r\n\r\n“Philosophy, M. Bertuccio,” interrupted the count; “you have done a\r\nlittle of everything in your life.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, excellency!”\r\n\r\n“No, no; but philosophy at half-past ten at night is somewhat late; yet\r\nI have no other observation to make, for what you say is correct, which\r\nis more than can be said for all philosophy.”\r\n\r\n“My journeys became more and more extensive and more productive.\r\nAssunta took care of all, and our little fortune increased. One day as\r\nI was setting off on an expedition, ‘Go,’ said she; ‘at your return I\r\nwill give you a surprise.’ I questioned her, but in vain; she would\r\ntell me nothing, and I departed. Our expedition lasted nearly six\r\nweeks; we had been to Lucca to take in oil, to Leghorn for English\r\ncottons, and we ran our cargo without opposition, and returned home\r\nfull of joy. When I entered the house, the first thing I beheld in the\r\nmiddle of Assunta’s chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous\r\ncompared with the rest of the furniture, and in it a baby seven or\r\neight months old. I uttered a cry of joy; the only moments of sadness I\r\nhad known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the\r\nrecollection that I had abandoned this child. For the assassination\r\nitself I had never felt any remorse. Poor Assunta had guessed all. She\r\nhad profited by my absence, and furnished with the half of the linen,\r\nand having written down the day and hour at which I had deposited the\r\nchild at the asylum, had set off for Paris, and had reclaimed it. No\r\nobjection was raised, and the infant was given up to her. Ah, I\r\nconfess, your excellency, when I saw this poor creature sleeping\r\npeacefully in its cradle, I felt my eyes filled with tears. ‘Ah,\r\nAssunta,’ cried I, ‘you are an excellent woman, and Heaven will bless\r\nyou.’”\r\n\r\n“This,” said Monte Cristo, “is less correct than your philosophy,—it is\r\nonly faith.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, your excellency is right,” replied Bertuccio, “and God made this\r\ninfant the instrument of our punishment. Never did a perverse nature\r\ndeclare itself more prematurely, and yet it was not owing to any fault\r\nin his bringing up. He was a most lovely child, with large blue eyes,\r\nof that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion;\r\nonly his hair, which was too light, gave his face a most singular\r\nexpression, and added to the vivacity of his look, and the malice of\r\nhis smile.\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately, there is a proverb which says that ‘red is either\r\naltogether good or altogether bad.’ The proverb was but too correct as\r\nregarded Benedetto, and even in his infancy he manifested the worst\r\ndisposition. It is true that the indulgence of his foster-mother\r\nencouraged him. This child, for whom my poor sister would go to the\r\ntown, five or six leagues off, to purchase the earliest fruits and the\r\nmost tempting sweetmeats, preferred to Palma grapes or Genoese\r\npreserves, the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor’s orchard, or the dried\r\napples in his loft, when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples\r\nthat grew in my garden.\r\n\r\n“One day, when Benedetto was about five or six, our neighbor Wasilio,\r\nwho, according to the custom of the country, never locked up his purse\r\nor his valuables—for, as your excellency knows, there are no thieves in\r\nCorsica—complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse; we\r\nthought he must have made a mistake in counting his money, but he\r\npersisted in the accuracy of his statement. One day, Benedetto, who had\r\nbeen gone from the house since morning, to our great anxiety, did not\r\nreturn until late in the evening, dragging a monkey after him, which he\r\nsaid he had found chained to the foot of a tree. For more than a month\r\npast, the mischievous child, who knew not what to wish for, had taken\r\nit into his head to have a monkey. A boatman, who had passed by\r\nRogliano, and who had several of these animals, whose tricks had\r\ngreatly diverted him, had, doubtless, suggested this idea to him.\r\n‘Monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees,’ said I; ‘confess\r\nhow you obtained this animal.’ Benedetto maintained the truth of what\r\nhe had said, and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his\r\nimagination than to his veracity. I became angry; he began to laugh, I\r\nthreatened to strike him, and he made two steps backwards. ‘You cannot\r\nbeat me,’ said he; ‘you have no right, for you are not my father.’\r\n\r\n20299m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“We never knew who had revealed this fatal secret, which we had so\r\ncarefully concealed from him; however, it was this answer, in which the\r\nchild’s whole character revealed itself, that almost terrified me, and\r\nmy arm fell without touching him.\r\n\r\n“The boy triumphed, and this victory rendered him so audacious, that\r\nall the money of Assunta, whose affection for him seemed to increase as\r\nhe became more unworthy of it, was spent in caprices she knew not how\r\nto contend against, and follies she had not the courage to prevent.\r\nWhen I was at Rogliano everything went on properly, but no sooner was\r\nmy back turned than Benedetto became master, and everything went ill.\r\nWhen he was only eleven, he chose his companions from among the young\r\nmen of eighteen or twenty, the worst characters in Bastia, or, indeed,\r\nin Corsica, and they had already, for some mischievous pranks, been\r\nseveral times threatened with a prosecution. I became alarmed, as any\r\nprosecution might be attended with serious consequences. I was\r\ncompelled, at this period, to leave Corsica on an important expedition;\r\nI reflected for a long time, and with the hope of averting some\r\nimpending misfortune, I resolved that Benedetto should accompany me.\r\n\r\n“I hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler, with the\r\nsevere discipline on board, would have a salutary effect on his\r\ncharacter, which was now well-nigh, if not quite, corrupt. I spoke to\r\nBenedetto alone, and proposed to him to accompany me, endeavoring to\r\ntempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of\r\na child of twelve. He heard me patiently, and when I had finished,\r\nburst out laughing.\r\n\r\n“‘Are you mad, uncle?’ (he called me by this name when he was in good\r\nhumor); ‘do you think I am going to change the life I lead for your\r\nmode of existence—my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious\r\ntoil you impose on yourself, exposed to the bitter frost at night, and\r\nthe scorching heat by day, compelled to conceal yourself, and when you\r\nare perceived, receive a volley of bullets, all to earn a paltry sum?\r\nWhy, I have as much money as I want; mother Assunta always furnishes me\r\nwhen I ask for it! You see that I should be a fool to accept your\r\noffer.’\r\n\r\n“The arguments, and his audacity, perfectly stupefied me. Benedetto\r\nrejoined his associates, and I saw him from a distance point me out to\r\nthem as a fool.”\r\n\r\n“Sweet child,” murmured Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Oh, had he been my own son,” replied Bertuccio, “or even my nephew, I\r\nwould have brought him back to the right road, for the knowledge that\r\nyou are doing your duty gives you strength, but the idea that I was\r\nstriking a child whose father I had killed, made it impossible for me\r\nto punish him. I gave my sister, who constantly defended the\r\nunfortunate boy, good advice, and as she confessed that she had several\r\ntimes missed money to a considerable amount, I showed her a safe place\r\nin which to conceal our little treasure for the future. My mind was\r\nalready made up. Benedetto could read, write, and cipher perfectly, for\r\nwhen the fit seized him, he learned more in a day than others in a\r\nweek. My intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship, and\r\nwithout letting him know anything of my plan, to convey him some\r\nmorning on board; by this means his future treatment would depend upon\r\nhis own conduct. I set off for France, after having fixed upon the\r\nplan. Our cargo was to be landed in the Gulf of Lyons, and this was a\r\ndifficult thing to do because it was then the year 1829. The most\r\nperfect tranquillity was restored, and the vigilance of the\r\ncustom-house officers was redoubled, and their strictness was increased\r\nat this time, in consequence of the fair at Beaucaire.\r\n\r\n20301m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Our expedition made a favorable beginning. We anchored our\r\nvessel—which had a double hold, where our goods were concealed—amidst a\r\nnumber of other vessels that bordered the banks of the Rhône from\r\nBeaucaire to Arles. On our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in\r\nthe night, and to convey it into the town, by the help of the innkeeper\r\nwith whom we were connected.\r\n\r\n“Whether success rendered us imprudent, or whether we were betrayed, I\r\nknow not; but one evening, about five o’clock, our little cabin-boy\r\ncame breathlessly, to inform us that he had seen a detachment of\r\ncustom-house officers advancing in our direction. It was not their\r\nproximity that alarmed us, for detachments were constantly patrolling\r\nalong the banks of the Rhône, but the care, according to the boy’s\r\naccount, that they took to avoid being seen. In an instant we were on\r\nthe alert, but it was too late; our vessel was surrounded, and amongst\r\nthe custom-house officers I observed several gendarmes, and, as\r\nterrified at the sight of their uniforms as I was brave at the sight of\r\nany other, I sprang into the hold, opened a port, and dropped into the\r\nriver, dived, and only rose at intervals to breathe, until I reached a\r\nditch that had recently been made from the Rhône to the canal that runs\r\nfrom Beaucaire to Aigues-Mortes. I was now safe, for I could swim along\r\nthe ditch without being seen, and I reached the canal in safety. I had\r\ndesignedly taken this direction. I have already told your excellency of\r\nan innkeeper from Nîmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from\r\nBellegarde to Beaucaire.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Monte Cristo “I perfectly recollect him; I think he was\r\nyour colleague.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely,” answered Bertuccio; “but he had, seven or eight years\r\nbefore this period, sold his establishment to a tailor at Marseilles,\r\nwho, having almost ruined himself in his old trade, wished to make his\r\nfortune in another. Of course, we made the same arrangements with the\r\nnew landlord that we had with the old; and it was of this man that I\r\nintended to ask shelter.”\r\n\r\n“What was his name?” inquired the count, who seemed to become somewhat\r\ninterested in Bertuccio’s story.\r\n\r\n“Gaspard Caderousse; he had married a woman from the village of\r\nCarconte, and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her\r\nvillage. She was suffering from malarial fever, and seemed dying by\r\ninches. As for her husband, he was a strapping fellow of forty, or\r\nfive-and-forty, who had more than once, in time of danger, given ample\r\nproof of his presence of mind and courage.”\r\n\r\n“And you say,” interrupted Monte Cristo “that this took place towards\r\nthe year——”\r\n\r\n“1829, your excellency.”\r\n\r\n“In what month?”\r\n\r\n“June.”\r\n\r\n“The beginning or the end?”\r\n\r\n“The evening of the 3rd.”\r\n\r\n20303m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Monte Cristo “the evening of the 3rd of June, 1829. Go on.”\r\n\r\n“It was from Caderousse that I intended demanding shelter, and, as we\r\nnever entered by the door that opened onto the road, I resolved not to\r\nbreak through the rule, so climbing over the garden-hedge, I crept\r\namongst the olive and wild fig trees, and fearing that Caderousse might\r\nhave some guest, I entered a kind of shed in which I had often passed\r\nthe night, and which was only separated from the inn by a partition, in\r\nwhich holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity\r\nof announcing our presence.\r\n\r\n“My intention was, if Caderousse was alone, to acquaint him with my\r\npresence, finish the meal the custom-house officers had interrupted,\r\nand profit by the threatened storm to return to the Rhône, and\r\nascertain the state of our vessel and its crew. I stepped into the\r\nshed, and it was fortunate I did so, for at that moment Caderousse\r\nentered with a stranger.\r\n\r\n“I waited patiently, not to overhear what they said, but because I\r\ncould do nothing else; besides, the same thing had occurred often\r\nbefore. The man who was with Caderousse was evidently a stranger to the\r\nSouth of France; he was one of those merchants who come to sell\r\njewellery at the Beaucaire fair, and who during the month the fair\r\nlasts, and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and\r\ncustomers from all parts of Europe, often have dealings to the amount\r\nof 100,000 to 150,000 francs. Caderousse entered hastily. Then, seeing\r\nthat the room was, as usual, empty, and only guarded by the dog, he\r\ncalled to his wife, ‘Hello, Carconte,’ said he, ‘the worthy priest has\r\nnot deceived us; the diamond is real.’\r\n\r\n“An exclamation of joy was heard, and the staircase creaked beneath a\r\nfeeble step. ‘What do you say?’ asked his wife, pale as death.\r\n\r\n“‘I say that the diamond is real, and that this gentleman, one of the\r\nfirst jewellers of Paris, will give us 50,000 francs for it. Only, in\r\norder to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us, he wishes you to\r\nrelate to him, as I have done already, the miraculous manner in which\r\nthe diamond came into our possession. In the meantime please to sit\r\ndown, monsieur, and I will fetch you some refreshment.’\r\n\r\n“The jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the\r\napparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond\r\nthat seemed to have come from the casket of a prince.\r\n\r\n“‘Relate your story, madame,’ said he, wishing, no doubt, to profit by\r\nthe absence of the husband, so that the latter could not influence the\r\nwife’s story, to see if the two recitals tallied.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh,’ returned she, ‘it was a gift of heaven. My husband was a great\r\nfriend, in 1814 or 1815, of a sailor named Edmond Dantès. This poor\r\nfellow, whom Caderousse had forgotten, had not forgotten him, and at\r\nhis death he bequeathed this diamond to him.’\r\n\r\n“‘But how did he obtain it?’ asked the jeweller; ‘had he it before he\r\nwas imprisoned?’\r\n\r\n“‘No, monsieur; but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance\r\nof a rich Englishman, and as in prison he fell sick, and Dantès took\r\nthe same care of him as if he had been his brother, the Englishman,\r\nwhen he was set free, gave this stone to Dantès, who, less fortunate,\r\ndied, and, in his turn, left it to us, and charged the excellent abbé,\r\nwho was here this morning, to deliver it.’\r\n\r\n“‘The same story,’ muttered the jeweller; ‘and improbable as it seemed\r\nat first, it may be true. There’s only the price we are not agreed\r\nabout.’\r\n\r\n“‘How not agreed about?’ said Caderousse. ‘I thought we agreed for the\r\nprice I asked.’\r\n\r\n“‘That is,’ replied the jeweller, ‘I offered 40,000 francs.’\r\n\r\n‘Forty thousand,’ cried La Carconte; ‘we will not part with it for that\r\nsum. The abbé told us it was worth 50,000 without the setting.’\r\n\r\n“‘What was the abbé’s name?’ asked the indefatigable questioner.\r\n\r\n“‘The Abbé Busoni,’ said La Carconte.\r\n\r\n“‘He was a foreigner?’\r\n\r\n“‘An Italian from the neighborhood of Mantua, I believe.’\r\n\r\n“‘Let me see this diamond again,’ replied the jeweller; ‘the first time\r\nyou are often mistaken as to the value of a stone.’\r\n\r\n“Caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen,\r\nopened, and gave it to the jeweller. At the sight of the diamond, which\r\nwas as large as a hazel-nut, La Carconte’s eyes sparkled with\r\ncupidity.”\r\n\r\n“And what did you think of this fine story, eavesdropper?” said Monte\r\nCristo; “did you credit it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your excellency. I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man, and I\r\nthought him incapable of committing a crime, or even a theft.”\r\n\r\n“That did more honor to your heart than to your experience, M.\r\nBertuccio. Had you known this Edmond Dantès, of whom they spoke?”\r\n\r\n“No, your excellency, I had never heard of him before, and never but\r\nonce afterwards, and that was from the Abbé Busoni himself, when I saw\r\nhim in the prison at Nîmes.”\r\n\r\n“Go on.”\r\n\r\n“The jeweller took the ring, and drawing from his pocket a pair of\r\nsteel pliers and a small set of copper scales, he took the stone out of\r\nits setting, and weighed it carefully.\r\n\r\n“‘I will give you 45,000,’ said he, ‘but not a sou more; besides, as\r\nthat is the exact value of the stone, I brought just that sum with me.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, that’s no matter,’ replied Caderousse, ‘I will go back with you\r\nto fetch the other 5,000 francs.’\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ returned the jeweller, giving back the diamond and the ring to\r\nCaderousse, ‘no, it is worth no more, and I am sorry I offered so much,\r\nfor the stone has a flaw in it, which I had not seen. However, I will\r\nnot go back on my word, and I will give 45,000.’\r\n\r\n“‘At least, replace the diamond in the ring,’ said La Carconte sharply.\r\n\r\n“‘Ah, true,’ replied the jeweller, and he reset the stone.\r\n\r\n“‘No matter,’ observed Caderousse, replacing the box in his pocket,\r\n‘someone else will purchase it.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ continued the jeweller; ‘but someone else will not be so easy\r\nas I am, or content himself with the same story. It is not natural that\r\na man like you should possess such a diamond. He will inform against\r\nyou. You will have to find the Abbé Busoni; and abbés who give diamonds\r\nworth two thousand louis are rare. The law would seize it, and put you\r\nin prison; if at the end of three or four months you are set at\r\nliberty, the ring will be lost, or a false stone, worth three francs,\r\nwill be given you, instead of a diamond worth 50,000 or perhaps 55,000\r\nfrancs; from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in\r\npurchasing.’\r\n\r\n“Caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other.\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ said Caderousse, ‘we are not rich enough to lose 5,000 francs.’\r\n\r\n“‘As you please, my dear sir,’ said the jeweller; ‘I had, however, as\r\nyou see, brought you the money in bright coin.’ And he drew from his\r\npocket a handful of gold, and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes\r\nof the innkeeper, and in the other hand he held a packet of bank-notes.\r\n\r\n“There was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of Caderousse; it\r\nwas plain that the small shagreen case, which he turned over and over\r\nin his hand, did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous\r\nsum which fascinated his gaze. He turned towards his wife.\r\n\r\n“‘What do you think of this?’ he asked in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“‘Let him have it—let him have it,’ she said. ‘If he returns to\r\nBeaucaire without the diamond, he will inform against us, and, as he\r\nsays, who knows if we shall ever again see the Abbé Busoni?—in all\r\nprobability we shall never see him.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, then, so I will!’ said Caderousse; ‘so you may have the diamond\r\nfor 45,000 francs. But my wife wants a gold chain, and I want a pair of\r\nsilver buckles.’\r\n\r\n“The jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box, which contained\r\nseveral samples of the articles demanded. ‘Here,’ he said, ‘I am very\r\nstraightforward in my dealings—take your choice.’\r\n\r\n“The woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis, and the\r\nhusband a pair of buckles, worth perhaps fifteen francs.\r\n\r\n“‘I hope you will not complain now?’ said the jeweller.\r\n\r\n“‘The abbé told me it was worth 50,000 francs,’ muttered Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“‘Come, come—give it to me! What a strange fellow you are,’ said the\r\njeweller, taking the diamond from his hand. ‘I give you 45,000\r\nfrancs—that is, 2,500 livres of income,—a fortune such as I wish I had\r\nmyself, and you are not satisfied!’\r\n\r\n“‘And the five-and-forty thousand francs,’ inquired Caderousse in a\r\nhoarse voice, ‘where are they? Come—let us see them.’\r\n\r\n“‘Here they are,’ replied the jeweller, and he counted out upon the\r\ntable 15,000 francs in gold, and 30,000 francs in bank-notes.\r\n\r\n“‘Wait whilst I light the lamp,’ said La Carconte; ‘it is growing dark,\r\nand there may be some mistake.’ In fact, night had come on during this\r\nconversation, and with night the storm which had been threatening for\r\nthe last half-hour. The thunder growled in the distance; but it was\r\napparently not heard by the jeweller, Caderousse, or La Carconte,\r\nabsorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain. I myself felt\r\na strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all\r\nthese bank-notes; it seemed to me that I was in a dream, and, as it\r\nalways happens in a dream, I felt myself riveted to the spot.\r\nCaderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes, then\r\nhanded them to his wife, who counted and counted them again in her\r\nturn. During this time, the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle\r\nin the lamplight, and the gem threw out jets of light which made him\r\nunmindful of those which—precursors of the storm—began to play in at\r\nthe windows.\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ inquired the jeweller, ‘is the cash all right?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ said Caderousse. ‘Give me the pocket-book, La Carconte, and\r\nfind a bag somewhere.’\r\n\r\n“La Carconte went to a cupboard, and returned with an old leathern\r\npocket-book and a bag. From the former she took some greasy letters,\r\nand put in their place the bank-notes, and from the bag took two or\r\nthree crowns of six livres each, which, in all probability, formed the\r\nentire fortune of the miserable couple.\r\n\r\n“‘There,’ said Caderousse; ‘and now, although you have wronged us of\r\nperhaps 10,000 francs, will you have your supper with us? I invite you\r\nwith good-will.’\r\n\r\n“‘Thank you,’ replied the jeweller, ‘it must be getting late, and I\r\nmust return to Beaucaire—my wife will be getting uneasy.’ He drew out\r\nhis watch, and exclaimed, ‘_Morbleu!_ nearly nine o’clock—why, I shall\r\nnot get back to Beaucaire before midnight! Good-night, my friends. If\r\nthe Abbé Busoni should by any accident return, think of me.’\r\n\r\n“‘In another week you will have left Beaucaire,’ remarked Caderousse,\r\n‘for the fair ends in a few days.’\r\n\r\n“‘True, but that makes no difference. Write to me at Paris, to M.\r\nJoannes, in the Palais Royal, arcade Pierre, No. 45. I will make the\r\njourney on purpose to see him, if it is worth while.’\r\n\r\n“At this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder, accompanied by\r\na flash of lightning so vivid, that it quite eclipsed the light of the\r\nlamp.\r\n\r\n20307m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘See here,’ exclaimed Caderousse. ‘You cannot think of going out in\r\nsuch weather as this.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, I am not afraid of thunder,’ said the jeweller.\r\n\r\n“‘And then there are robbers,’ said La Carconte. ‘The road is never\r\nvery safe during fair time.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, as to the robbers,’ said Joannes, ‘here is something for them,’\r\nand he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols, loaded to the\r\nmuzzle. ‘Here,’ said he, ‘are dogs who bark and bite at the same time,\r\nthey are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond,\r\nFriend Caderousse.’\r\n\r\n“Caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look. It seemed\r\nas though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible\r\nthought. ‘Well, then, a good journey to you,’ said Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“‘Thanks,’ replied the jeweller. He then took his cane, which he had\r\nplaced against an old cupboard, and went out. At the moment when he\r\nopened the door, such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly\r\nextinguished. ‘Oh,’ said he, ‘this is very nice weather, and two\r\nleagues to go in such a storm.’\r\n\r\n“‘Remain,’ said Caderousse. ‘You can sleep here.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes; do stay,’ added La Carconte in a tremulous voice; ‘we will take\r\nevery care of you.’\r\n\r\n“‘No; I must sleep at Beaucaire. So, once more, good-night.’ Caderousse\r\nfollowed him slowly to the threshold. ‘I can see neither heaven nor\r\nearth,’ said the jeweller, who was outside the door. ‘Do I turn to the\r\nright, or to the left hand?’\r\n\r\n“‘To the right,’ said Caderousse. ‘You cannot go wrong—the road is\r\nbordered by trees on both sides.’\r\n\r\n“‘Good—all right,’ said a voice almost lost in the distance.\r\n\r\n“‘Close the door,’ said La Carconte; ‘I do not like open doors when it\r\nthunders.’\r\n\r\n“‘Particularly when there is money in the house, eh?’ answered\r\nCaderousse, double-locking the door.\r\n\r\n20311m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“He came into the room, went to the cupboard, took out the bag and\r\npocket-book, and both began, for the third time, to count their gold\r\nand bank-notes. I never saw such an expression of cupidity as the\r\nflickering lamp revealed in those two countenances. The woman,\r\nespecially, was hideous; her usual feverish tremulousness was\r\nintensified, her countenance had become livid, and her eyes resembled\r\nburning coals.\r\n\r\n“‘Why,’ she inquired in a hoarse voice, ‘did you invite him to sleep\r\nhere tonight?’\r\n\r\n“‘Why?’ said Caderousse with a shudder; ‘why, that he might not have\r\nthe trouble of returning to Beaucaire.’\r\n\r\n“‘Ah,’ responded the woman, with an expression impossible to describe;\r\n‘I thought it was for something else.’\r\n\r\n“‘Woman, woman—why do you have such ideas?’ cried Caderousse; ‘or, if\r\nyou have them, why don’t you keep them to yourself?’\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ said La Carconte, after a moment’s pause, ‘you are not a man.’\r\n\r\n“‘What do you mean?’ added Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“‘If you had been a man, you would not have let him go from here.’\r\n\r\n“‘Woman!’\r\n\r\n“‘Or else he should not have reached Beaucaire.’\r\n\r\n“‘Woman!’\r\n\r\n“‘The road takes a turn—he is obliged to follow it—while alongside of\r\nthe canal there is a shorter road.’\r\n\r\n“‘Woman!—you offend the good God. There—listen!’\r\n\r\nAnd at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder, while the\r\nlivid lightning illumined the room, and the thunder, rolling away in\r\nthe distance, seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode.\r\n‘Mercy!’ said Caderousse, crossing himself.\r\n\r\n20312m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“At the same moment, and in the midst of the terrifying silence which\r\nusually follows a clap of thunder, they heard a knocking at the door.\r\nCaderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other.\r\n\r\n“‘Who’s there?’ cried Caderousse, rising, and drawing up in a heap the\r\ngold and notes scattered over the table, and which he covered with his\r\ntwo hands.\r\n\r\n“‘It is I,’ shouted a voice.\r\n\r\n“‘And who are you?’\r\n\r\n“‘Eh, _pardieu!_ Joannes, the jeweller.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, and you said I offended the good God,’ said La Carconte with a\r\nhorrid smile. ‘Why, the good God sends him back again.’ Caderousse sank\r\npale and breathless into his chair.\r\n\r\n“La Carconte, on the contrary, rose, and going with a firm step towards\r\nthe door, opened it, saying, as she did so:\r\n\r\n“‘Come in, dear M. Joannes.’\r\n\r\n“‘_Ma foi_,’ said the jeweller, drenched with rain, ‘I am not destined\r\nto return to Beaucaire tonight. The shortest follies are best, my dear\r\nCaderousse. You offered me hospitality, and I accept it, and have\r\nreturned to sleep beneath your friendly roof.’\r\n\r\n“Caderousse stammered out something, while he wiped away the sweat that\r\nstarted to his brow. La Carconte double-locked the door behind the\r\njeweller.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 45. The Rain of Blood\r\n\r\nAs the jeweller returned to the apartment, he cast around him a\r\nscrutinizing glance—but there was nothing to excite suspicion, if it\r\ndid not exist, or to confirm it, if it were already awakened.\r\nCaderousse’s hands still grasped the gold and bank-notes, and La\r\nCarconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance\r\nof their guest.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, well,’ said the jeweller, ‘you seem, my good friends, to have\r\nhad some fears respecting the accuracy of your money, by counting it\r\nover so carefully directly I was gone.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, no,’ answered Caderousse, ‘that was not my reason, I can assure\r\nyou; but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this\r\nwealth are so unexpected, as to make us scarcely credit our good\r\nfortune, and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches\r\nbefore our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is\r\nnot a dream.’\r\n\r\n“The jeweller smiled. ‘Have you any other guests in your house?’\r\ninquired he.\r\n\r\n“‘Nobody but ourselves,’ replied Caderousse; ‘the fact is, we do not\r\nlodge travellers—indeed, our tavern is so near the town, that nobody\r\nwould think of stopping here.’\r\n\r\n“‘Then I am afraid I shall very much inconvenience you.’\r\n\r\n“‘Inconvenience us? Not at all, my dear sir,’ said La Carconte in her\r\nmost gracious manner. ‘Not at all, I assure you.’\r\n\r\n“‘But where will you manage to stow me?’\r\n\r\n“‘In the chamber overhead.’\r\n\r\n“‘Surely that is where you yourselves sleep?’\r\n\r\n“‘Never mind that; we have a second bed in the adjoining room.’\r\n\r\n“Caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment.\r\n\r\n“The jeweller, meanwhile, was humming a song as he stood warming his\r\nback at the fire La Carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her\r\nguest; and this done, she next occupied herself in arranging his\r\nsupper, by spreading a napkin at the end of the table, and placing on\r\nit the slender remains of their dinner, to which she added three or\r\nfour fresh-laid eggs. Caderousse had once more parted with his\r\ntreasure—the banknotes were replaced in the pocket-book, the gold put\r\nback into the bag, and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard. He\r\nthen began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air, glancing from\r\ntime to time at the jeweller, who stood reeking with the steam from his\r\nwet clothes, and merely changing his place on the warm hearth, to\r\nenable the whole of his garments to be dried.\r\n\r\n“‘There,’ said La Carconte, as she placed a bottle of wine on the\r\ntable, ‘supper is ready whenever you are.’\r\n\r\n“‘And you?’ asked Joannes.\r\n\r\n“‘I don’t want any supper,’ said Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“‘We dined so very late,’ hastily interposed La Carconte.\r\n\r\n“‘Then it seems I am to eat alone,’ remarked the jeweller.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you,’ answered La\r\nCarconte, with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest\r\neven to guests who paid for what they took.\r\n\r\n“From time to time Caderousse darted on his wife keen, searching\r\nglances, but rapid as the lightning flash. The storm still continued.\r\n\r\n“‘There, there,’ said La Carconte; ‘do you hear that? upon my word, you\r\ndid well to come back.’\r\n\r\n“‘Nevertheless,’ replied the jeweller, ‘if by the time I have finished\r\nmy supper the tempest has at all abated, I shall make another start.’\r\n\r\n“‘It’s the mistral,’ said Caderousse, ‘and it will be sure to last till\r\ntomorrow morning.’ He sighed heavily.\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ said the jeweller, as he placed himself at table, ‘all I can\r\nsay is, so much the worse for those who are abroad.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ chimed in La Carconte, ‘they will have a wretched night of it.’\r\n\r\n“The jeweller began eating his supper, and the woman, who was\r\nordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her, was\r\nsuddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess. Had\r\nthe unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously\r\nacquainted with her, so sudden an alteration might well have excited\r\nsuspicion in his mind, or at least have greatly astonished him.\r\nCaderousse, meanwhile, continued to pace the room in gloomy silence,\r\nsedulously avoiding the sight of his guest; but as soon as the stranger\r\nhad completed his repast, the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the\r\ndoor and opened it.\r\n\r\n“‘I believe the storm is over,’ said he.\r\n\r\n“But as if to contradict his statement, at that instant a violent clap\r\nof thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation, while a\r\nsudden gust of wind, mingled with rain, extinguished the lamp he held\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\n“Trembling and awe-struck, Caderousse hastily shut the door and\r\nreturned to his guest, while La Carconte lighted a candle by the\r\nsmouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth.\r\n\r\n“‘You must be tired,’ said she to the jeweller; ‘I have spread a pair\r\nof white sheets on your bed; go up when you are ready, and sleep well.’\r\n\r\n“Joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in\r\nits fury, but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that,\r\ninstead of diminishing, the violence of the rain and thunder\r\nmomentarily increased; resigning himself, therefore, to what seemed\r\ninevitable, he bade his host good-night, and mounted the stairs. He\r\npassed over my head and I heard the flooring creak beneath his\r\nfootsteps. The quick, eager glance of La Carconte followed him as he\r\nascended, while Caderousse, on the contrary, turned his back, and\r\nseemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him.\r\n\r\n“All these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as\r\nthey have since done; in fact, all that had happened (with the\r\nexception of the story of the diamond, which certainly did wear an air\r\nof improbability), appeared natural enough, and called for neither\r\napprehension nor mistrust; but, worn out as I was with fatigue, and\r\nfully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated, I\r\ndetermined to obtain a few hours’ sleep. Overhead I could accurately\r\ndistinguish every movement of the jeweller, who, after making the best\r\narrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night, threw\r\nhimself on his bed, and I could hear it creak and groan beneath his\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n“Insensibly my eyelids grew heavy, deep sleep stole over me, and having\r\nno suspicion of anything wrong, I sought not to shake it off. I looked\r\ninto the kitchen once more and saw Caderousse sitting by the side of a\r\nlong table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places\r\nare frequently used instead of chairs; his back was turned towards me,\r\nso that I could not see the expression of his countenance—neither\r\nshould I have been able to do so had he been placed differently, as his\r\nhead was buried between his two hands. La Carconte continued to gaze on\r\nhim for some time, then shrugging her shoulders, she took her seat\r\nimmediately opposite to him.\r\n\r\n“At this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the\r\nkindling of a piece of wood that lay near, and a bright light flashed\r\nover the room. La Carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband,\r\nbut as he made no sign of changing his position, she extended her hard,\r\nbony hand, and touched him on the forehead.\r\n\r\n20317m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Caderousse shuddered. The woman’s lips seemed to move, as though she\r\nwere talking; but because she merely spoke in an undertone, or my\r\nsenses were dulled by sleep, I did not catch a word she uttered.\r\nConfused sights and sounds seemed to float before me, and gradually I\r\nfell into a deep, heavy slumber. How long I had been in this\r\nunconscious state I know not, when I was suddenly aroused by the report\r\nof a pistol, followed by a fearful cry. Weak and tottering footsteps\r\nresounded across the chamber above me, and the next instant a dull,\r\nheavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase. I had not yet\r\nfully recovered consciousness, when again I heard groans, mingled with\r\nhalf-stifled cries, as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle. A\r\ncry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans\r\neffectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy. Hastily raising myself\r\non one arm, I looked around, but all was dark; and it seemed to me as\r\nif the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room\r\nabove, for some kind of moisture appeared to fall, drop by drop, upon\r\nmy forehead, and when I passed my hand across my brow, I felt that it\r\nwas wet and clammy.\r\n\r\n“To the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most\r\nperfect silence—unbroken, save by the footsteps of a man walking about\r\nin the chamber above. The staircase creaked, he descended into the room\r\nbelow, approached the fire and lit a candle.\r\n\r\n“The man was Caderousse—he was pale and his shirt was all bloody.\r\nHaving obtained the light, he hurried upstairs again, and once more I\r\nheard his rapid and uneasy footsteps.\r\n\r\n“A moment later he came down again, holding in his hand the small\r\nshagreen case, which he opened, to assure himself it contained the\r\ndiamond,—seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in,\r\nthen, as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket, he\r\ndeposited it in his red handkerchief, which he carefully rolled round\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n“After this he took from his cupboard the bank-notes and gold he had\r\nput there, thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers, and the\r\nother into that of his waistcoat, hastily tied up a small bundle of\r\nlinen, and rushing towards the door, disappeared in the darkness of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n“Then all became clear and manifest to me, and I reproached myself with\r\nwhat had happened, as though I myself had done the guilty deed. I\r\nfancied that I still heard faint moans, and imagining that the\r\nunfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead, I determined to go to his\r\nrelief, by way of atoning in some slight degree, not for the crime I\r\nhad committed, but for that which I had not endeavored to prevent. For\r\nthis purpose I applied all the strength I possessed to force an\r\nentrance from the cramped spot in which I lay to the adjoining room.\r\nThe poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my\r\nefforts, and I found myself in the house. Hastily snatching up the\r\nlighted candle, I hurried to the staircase; about midway a body was\r\nlying quite across the stairs. It was that of La Carconte. The pistol I\r\nhad heard had doubtless been fired at her. The shot had frightfully\r\nlacerated her throat, leaving two gaping wounds from which, as well as\r\nthe mouth, the blood was pouring in floods. She was stone dead. I\r\nstrode past her, and ascended to the sleeping chamber, which presented\r\nan appearance of the wildest disorder. The furniture had been knocked\r\nover in the deadly struggle that had taken place there, and the sheets,\r\nto which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung, were dragged\r\nacross the room. The murdered man lay on the floor, his head leaning\r\nagainst the wall, and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth\r\nfrom three large wounds in his breast; there was a fourth gash, in\r\nwhich a long table knife was plunged up to the handle.\r\n\r\n“I stumbled over some object; I stooped to examine—it was the second\r\npistol, which had not gone off, probably from the powder being wet. I\r\napproached the jeweller, who was not quite dead, and at the sound of my\r\nfootsteps and the creaking of the floor, he opened his eyes, fixed them\r\non me with an anxious and inquiring gaze, moved his lips as though\r\ntrying to speak, then, overcome by the effort, fell back and expired.\r\n\r\n“This appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses, and finding that I\r\ncould no longer be of service to anyone in the house, my only desire\r\nwas to fly. I rushed towards the staircase, clutching my hair, and\r\nuttering a groan of horror.\r\n\r\n“Upon reaching the room below, I found five or six custom-house\r\nofficers, and two or three gendarmes—all heavily armed. They threw\r\nthemselves upon me. I made no resistance; I was no longer master of my\r\nsenses. When I strove to speak, a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped\r\nmy lips.\r\n\r\n“As I noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed\r\nto my blood-stained garments, I involuntarily surveyed myself, and then\r\nI discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as I lay\r\nbeneath the staircase must have been the blood of La Carconte. I\r\npointed to the spot where I had concealed myself.\r\n\r\n“‘What does he mean?’ asked a gendarme.\r\n\r\n“One of the officers went to the place I directed.\r\n\r\n“‘He means,’ replied the man upon his return, ‘that he got in that\r\nway;’ and he showed the hole I had made when I broke through.\r\n\r\n“Then I saw that they took me for the assassin. I recovered force and\r\nenergy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me, while\r\nI managed to stammer forth:\r\n\r\n“‘I did not do it! Indeed, indeed I did not!’\r\n\r\n“A couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n“‘Stir but a step,’ said they, ‘and you are a dead man.’\r\n\r\n“‘Why should you threaten me with death,’ cried I, ‘when I have already\r\ndeclared my innocence?’\r\n\r\n“‘Tush, tush,’ cried the men; ‘keep your innocent stories to tell to\r\nthe judge at Nîmes. Meanwhile, come along with us; and the best advice\r\nwe can give you is to do so unresistingly.’\r\n\r\n“Alas, resistance was far from my thoughts. I was utterly overpowered\r\nby surprise and terror; and without a word I suffered myself to be\r\nhandcuffed and tied to a horse’s tail, and thus they took me to Nîmes.\r\n\r\n“I had been tracked by a customs-officer, who had lost sight of me near\r\nthe tavern; feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there, he\r\nhad returned to summon his comrades, who just arrived in time to hear\r\nthe report of the pistol, and to take me in the midst of such\r\ncircumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my\r\ninnocence utterly futile. One only chance was left me, that of\r\nbeseeching the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every\r\ninquiry to be made for the Abbé Busoni, who had stopped at the inn of\r\nthe Pont du Gard on that morning.\r\n\r\n“If Caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond, and\r\nthere existed no such person as the Abbé Busoni, then, indeed, I was\r\nlost past redemption, or, at least, my life hung upon the feeble chance\r\nof Caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth.\r\n\r\n“Two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part, while I\r\nmust do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to\r\nobtain information of the person I declared could exculpate me if he\r\nwould. Caderousse still evaded all pursuit, and I had resigned myself\r\nto what seemed my inevitable fate. My trial was to come on at the\r\napproaching assizes; when, on the 8th of September—that is to say,\r\nprecisely three months and five days after the events which had\r\nperilled my life—the Abbé Busoni, whom I never ventured to believe I\r\nshould see, presented himself at the prison doors, saying he understood\r\none of the prisoners wished to speak to him; he added, that having\r\nlearned at Marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment, he hastened\r\nto comply with my desire.\r\n\r\n“You may easily imagine with what eagerness I welcomed him, and how\r\nminutely I related the whole of what I had seen and heard. I felt some\r\ndegree of nervousness as I entered upon the history of the diamond,\r\nbut, to my inexpressible astonishment, he confirmed it in every\r\nparticular, and to my equal surprise, he seemed to place entire belief\r\nin all I said.\r\n\r\n“And then it was that, won by his mild charity, seeing that he was\r\nacquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country, and\r\nconsidering also that pardon for the only crime of which I was really\r\nguilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind,\r\nI besought him to receive my confession, under the seal of which I\r\nrecounted the Auteuil affair in all its details, as well as every other\r\ntransaction of my life. That which I had done by the impulse of my best\r\nfeelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of\r\ncalculation. My voluntary confession of the assassination at Auteuil\r\nproved to him that I had not committed that of which I stood accused.\r\nWhen he quitted me, he bade me be of good courage, and to rely upon his\r\ndoing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence.\r\n\r\n“I had speedy proofs that the excellent abbé was engaged in my behalf,\r\nfor the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling\r\nthough acceptable indulgences, and I was told that my trial was to be\r\npostponed to the assizes following those now being held.\r\n\r\n“In the interim it pleased Providence to cause the apprehension of\r\nCaderousse, who was discovered in some distant country, and brought\r\nback to France, where he made a full confession, refusing to make the\r\nfact of his wife’s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse\r\nfor his own guilt. The wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for\r\nlife, and I was immediately set at liberty.”\r\n\r\n“And then it was, I presume,” said Monte Cristo “that you came to me as\r\nthe bearer of a letter from the Abbé Busoni?”\r\n\r\n“It was, your excellency; the benevolent abbé took an evident interest\r\nin all that concerned me.\r\n\r\n“‘Your mode of life as a smuggler,’ said he to me one day, ‘will be the\r\nruin of you; if you get out, don’t take it up again.’\r\n\r\n“‘But how,’ inquired I, ‘am I to maintain myself and my poor sister?’\r\n\r\n“‘A person, whose confessor I am,’ replied he, ‘and who entertains a\r\nhigh regard for me, applied to me a short time since to procure him a\r\nconfidential servant. Would you like such a post? If so, I will give\r\nyou a letter of introduction to him.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, father,’ I exclaimed, ‘you are very good.’\r\n\r\n“‘But you must swear solemnly that I shall never have reason to repent\r\nmy recommendation.’\r\n\r\n“I extended my hand, and was about to pledge myself by any promise he\r\nwould dictate, but he stopped me.\r\n\r\n“‘It is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow,’ said he; ‘I\r\nknow and admire the Corsican nature too well to fear you. Here, take\r\nthis,’ continued he, after rapidly writing the few lines I brought to\r\nyour excellency, and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me\r\ninto your service, and proudly I ask whether your excellency has ever\r\nhad cause to repent having done so?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the count; “I take pleasure in saying that you have\r\nserved me faithfully, Bertuccio; but you might have shown more\r\nconfidence in me.”\r\n\r\n“I, your excellency?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; you. How comes it, that having both a sister and an adopted son,\r\nyou have never spoken to me of either?”\r\n\r\n20323m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Alas, I have still to recount the most distressing period of my life.\r\nAnxious as you may suppose I was to behold and comfort my dear sister,\r\nI lost no time in hastening to Corsica, but when I arrived at Rogliano\r\nI found a house of mourning, the consequences of a scene so horrible\r\nthat the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day. Acting by my\r\nadvice, my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable\r\ndemands of Benedetto, who was continually tormenting her for money, as\r\nlong as he believed there was a sou left in her possession. One morning\r\nhe threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply\r\nhim with what he desired, and disappeared and remained away all day,\r\nleaving the kind-hearted Assunta, who loved him as if he were her own\r\nchild, to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence. Evening came,\r\nand still, with all the patient solicitude of a mother, she watched for\r\nhis return.\r\n\r\n“As the eleventh hour struck, he entered with a swaggering air,\r\nattended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon\r\ncompanions. She stretched out her arms to him, but they seized hold of\r\nher, and one of the three—none other than the accursed Benedetto\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n“‘Put her to torture and she’ll soon tell us where her money is.’\r\n\r\n“It unfortunately happened that our neighbor, Wasilio, was at Bastia,\r\nleaving no person in his house but his wife; no human creature beside\r\ncould hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling. Two\r\nheld poor Assunta, who, unable to conceive that any harm was intended\r\nto her, smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her\r\nexecutioners. The third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows,\r\nthen returned, and the three united in stifling the cries of terror\r\nincited by the sight of these preparations, and then dragged Assunta\r\nfeet foremost towards the brazier, expecting to wring from her an\r\navowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted. In the struggle her\r\nclothes caught fire, and they were obliged to let go their hold in\r\norder to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate. Covered with\r\nflames, Assunta rushed wildly to the door, but it was fastened; she\r\nflew to the windows, but they were also secured; then the neighbors\r\nheard frightful shrieks; it was Assunta calling for help. The cries\r\ndied away in groans, and next morning, as soon as Wasilio’s wife could\r\nmuster up courage to venture abroad, she caused the door of our\r\ndwelling to be opened by the public authorities, when Assunta, although\r\ndreadfully burnt, was found still breathing; every drawer and closet in\r\nthe house had been forced open, and the money stolen. Benedetto never\r\nagain appeared at Rogliano, neither have I since that day either seen\r\nor heard anything concerning him.\r\n\r\n“It was subsequently to these dreadful events that I waited on your\r\nexcellency, to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned\r\nBenedetto, since all trace of him seemed entirely lost; or of my\r\nsister, since she was dead.”\r\n\r\n“And in what light did you view the occurrence?” inquired Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“As a punishment for the crime I had committed,” answered Bertuccio.\r\n“Oh, those Villeforts are an accursed race!”\r\n\r\n“Truly they are,” murmured the count in a lugubrious tone.\r\n\r\n“And now,” resumed Bertuccio, “your excellency may, perhaps, be able to\r\ncomprehend that this place, which I revisit for the first time—this\r\ngarden, the actual scene of my crime—must have given rise to\r\nreflections of no very agreeable nature, and produced that gloom and\r\ndepression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency, who\r\nwas pleased to express a desire to know the cause. At this instant a\r\nshudder passes over me as I reflect that possibly I am now standing on\r\nthe very grave in which lies M. de Villefort, by whose hand the ground\r\nwas dug to receive the corpse of his child.”\r\n\r\n“Everything is possible,” said Monte Cristo, rising from the bench on\r\nwhich he had been sitting; “even,” he added in an inaudible voice,\r\n“even that the procureur be not dead. The Abbé Busoni did right to send\r\nyou to me,” he went on in his ordinary tone, “and you have done well in\r\nrelating to me the whole of your history, as it will prevent my forming\r\nany erroneous opinions concerning you in future. As for that Benedetto,\r\nwho so grossly belied his name, have you never made any effort to trace\r\nout whither he has gone, or what has become of him?”\r\n\r\n“No; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself, I should\r\nshun the possibility of meeting him as I would a wild beast. Thank God,\r\nI have never heard his name mentioned by any person, and I hope and\r\nbelieve he is dead.”\r\n\r\n“Do not think so, Bertuccio,” replied the count; “for the wicked are\r\nnot so easily disposed of, for God seems to have them under his special\r\nwatch-care to make of them instruments of his vengeance.”\r\n\r\n“So be it,” responded Bertuccio, “all I ask of heaven is that I may\r\nnever see him again. And now, your excellency,” he added, bowing his\r\nhead, “you know everything—you are my judge on earth, as the Almighty\r\nis in heaven; have you for me no words of consolation?”\r\n\r\n“My good friend, I can only repeat the words addressed to you by the\r\nAbbé Busoni. Villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you,\r\nand, perhaps, to others. Benedetto, if still living, will become the\r\ninstrument of divine retribution in some way or other, and then be duly\r\npunished in his turn. As far as you yourself are concerned, I see but\r\none point in which you are really guilty. Ask yourself, wherefore,\r\nafter rescuing the infant from its living grave, you did not restore it\r\nto its mother? There was the crime, Bertuccio—that was where you became\r\nreally culpable.”\r\n\r\n“True, excellency, that was the crime, the real crime, for in that I\r\nacted like a coward. My first duty, directly I had succeeded in\r\nrecalling the babe to life, was to restore it to its mother; but, in\r\norder to do so, I must have made close and careful inquiry, which\r\nwould, in all probability, have led to my own apprehension; and I clung\r\nto life, partly on my sister’s account, and partly from that feeling of\r\npride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and\r\nvictorious in the execution of our vengeance. Perhaps, too, the natural\r\nand instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own.\r\nAnd then, again, I am not as brave and courageous as was my poor\r\nbrother.”\r\n\r\nBertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words, while\r\nMonte Cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning. After a brief\r\nsilence, rendered still more solemn by the time and place, the count\r\nsaid, in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner:\r\n\r\n“In order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination (the last\r\nwe shall ever hold upon this subject), I will repeat to you some words\r\nI have heard from the lips of the Abbé Busoni. For all evils there are\r\ntwo remedies—time and silence. And now leave me, Monsieur Bertuccio, to\r\nwalk alone here in the garden. The very circumstances which inflict on\r\nyou, as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here, such painful\r\nemotions, are to me, on the contrary, a source of something like\r\ncontentment, and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my\r\nestimation. The chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of\r\ntheir umbrageous boughs, while fancy pictures a moving multitude of\r\nshapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade. Here I have a\r\ngarden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the\r\nimagination, and furnished with thickly grown trees, beneath whose\r\nleafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will.\r\nThis to me, who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a\r\nstraight wall, is, I assure you, a most agreeable surprise. I have no\r\nfear of ghosts, and I have never heard it said that so much harm had\r\nbeen done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the\r\nliving in a single day. Retire within, Bertuccio, and tranquillize your\r\nmind. Should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying\r\nmoments than you found the Abbé Busoni, send for me, if I am still on\r\nearth, and I will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually\r\ncalm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the\r\nocean called eternity.”\r\n\r\nBertuccio bowed respectfully, and turned away, sighing heavily. Monte\r\nCristo, left alone, took three or four steps onwards, and murmured:\r\n\r\n“Here, beneath this plane-tree, must have been where the infant’s grave\r\nwas dug. There is the little door opening into the garden. At this\r\ncorner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping\r\napartment. There will be no necessity for me to make a note of these\r\nparticulars, for there, before my eyes, beneath my feet, all around me,\r\nI have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth.”\r\n\r\nAfter making the tour of the garden a second time, the count re-entered\r\nhis carriage, while Bertuccio, who perceived the thoughtful expression\r\nof his master’s features, took his seat beside the driver without\r\nuttering a word. The carriage proceeded rapidly towards Paris.\r\n\r\nThat same evening, upon reaching his abode in the Champs-Élysées, the\r\nCount of Monte Cristo went over the whole building with the air of one\r\nlong acquainted with each nook or corner. Nor, although preceding the\r\nparty, did he once mistake one door for another, or commit the smallest\r\nerror when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him\r\nto a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit. Ali was his principal\r\nattendant during this nocturnal survey. Having given various orders to\r\nBertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to\r\nmake in the house, the Count, drawing out his watch, said to the\r\nattentive Nubian:\r\n\r\n“It is half-past eleven o’clock; Haydée will soon be here. Have the\r\nFrench attendants been summoned to await her coming?”\r\n\r\nAli extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair\r\nGreek, which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried\r\nentrance, that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined\r\ntheir existence. Ali, having pointed to the apartments, held up three\r\nfingers of his right hand, and then, placing it beneath his head, shut\r\nhis eyes, and feigned to sleep.\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said Monte Cristo, well acquainted with Ali’s\r\npantomime; “you mean to tell me that three female attendants await\r\ntheir new mistress in her sleeping-chamber.”\r\n\r\nAli, with considerable animation, made a sign in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n“Madame will be tired tonight,” continued Monte Cristo, “and will, no\r\ndoubt, wish to rest. Desire the French attendants not to weary her with\r\nquestions, but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire. You will\r\nalso see that the Greek servants hold no communication with those of\r\nthis country.”\r\n\r\nHe bowed. Just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge.\r\nThe gate opened, a carriage rolled down the avenue, and stopped at the\r\nsteps. The count hastily descended, presented himself at the already\r\nopened carriage door, and held out his hand to a young woman,\r\ncompletely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with\r\ngold. She raised the hand extended towards her to her lips, and kissed\r\nit with a mixture of love and respect. Some few words passed between\r\nthem in that sonorous language in which Homer makes his gods converse.\r\nThe young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness, while the\r\ncount replied with an air of gentle gravity.\r\n\r\nPreceded by Ali, who carried a rose-colored flambeau in his hand, the\r\nyoung lady, who was no other than the lovely Greek who had been Monte\r\nCristo’s companion in Italy, was conducted to her apartments, while the\r\ncount retired to the pavilion reserved for himself. In another hour\r\nevery light in the house was extinguished, and it might have been\r\nthought that all its inmates slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit\r\n\r\nAbout two o’clock the following day a calash, drawn by a pair of\r\nmagnificent English horses, stopped at the door of Monte Cristo and a\r\nperson, dressed in a blue coat, with buttons of a similar color, a\r\nwhite waistcoat, over which was displayed a massive gold chain, brown\r\ntrousers, and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his\r\neyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so\r\nlittle did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles\r\nstamped on his features—a person, in a word, who, although evidently\r\npast fifty, desired to be taken for not more than forty, bent forwards\r\nfrom the carriage door, on the panels of which were emblazoned the\r\narmorial bearings of a baron, and directed his groom to inquire at the\r\nporter’s lodge whether the Count of Monte Cristo resided there, and if\r\nhe were within.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting, the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house, the\r\ngarden as far as he could distinguish it, and the livery of servants\r\nwho passed to and fro, with an attention so close as to be somewhat\r\nimpertinent. His glance was keen but showed cunning rather than\r\nintelligence; his lips were straight, and so thin that, as they closed,\r\nthey were drawn in over the teeth; his cheek-bones were broad and\r\nprojecting, a never-failing proof of audacity and craftiness; while the\r\nflatness of his forehead, and the enlargement of the back of his skull,\r\nwhich rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears,\r\ncombined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing, save in the\r\neyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage\r\nmust needs be all that was admirable and enviable, more especially when\r\nthey gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt, and the\r\nred ribbon that depended from his button-hole.\r\n\r\nThe groom, in obedience to his orders, tapped at the window of the\r\nporter’s lodge, saying:\r\n\r\n“Pray, does not the Count of Monte Cristo live here?”\r\n\r\n“His excellency does reside here,” replied the concierge; “but——” added\r\nhe, glancing an inquiring look at Ali. Ali returned a sign in the\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\n“But what?” asked the groom.\r\n\r\n“His excellency does not receive visitors today.”\r\n\r\n“Then here is my master’s card, the Baron Danglars. You will take it to\r\nthe count, and say that, although in haste to attend the Chamber, my\r\nmaster came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him.”\r\n\r\n“I never speak to his excellency,” replied the concierge; “the valet de\r\nchambre will carry your message.”\r\n\r\nThe groom returned to the carriage.\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Danglars.\r\n\r\nThe man, somewhat crest-fallen by the rebuke he had received, repeated\r\nwhat the concierge had said.\r\n\r\n“Bless me,” murmured Baron Danglars, “this must surely be a prince\r\ninstead of a count by their styling him ‘excellency,’ and only\r\nventuring to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre.\r\nHowever, it does not signify; he has a letter of credit on me, so I\r\nmust see him when he requires his money.”\r\n\r\nThen, throwing himself back in his carriage, Danglars called out to his\r\ncoachman, in a voice that might be heard across the road, “To the\r\nChamber of Deputies.”\r\n\r\nApprised in time of the visit paid him, Monte Cristo had, from behind\r\nthe blinds of his pavilion, as minutely observed the baron, by means of\r\nan excellent lorgnette, as Danglars himself had scrutinized the house,\r\ngarden, and servants.\r\n\r\n“That fellow has a decidedly bad countenance,” said the count in a tone\r\nof disgust, as he shut up his glass into its ivory case. “How comes it\r\nthat all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat, receding,\r\nserpent-like forehead, round, vulture-shaped head, and sharp-hooked\r\nnose, like the beak of a buzzard? Ali,” cried he, striking at the same\r\ntime on the brazen gong. Ali appeared. “Summon Bertuccio,” said the\r\ncount. Almost immediately Bertuccio entered the apartment.\r\n\r\n“Did your excellency desire to see me?” inquired he.\r\n\r\n“I did,” replied the count. “You no doubt observed the horses standing\r\na few minutes since at the door?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, your excellency. I noticed them for their remarkable\r\nbeauty.”\r\n\r\n“Then how comes it,” said Monte Cristo with a frown, “that, when I\r\ndesired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in\r\nParis, there is another pair, fully as fine as mine, not in my\r\nstables?”\r\n\r\nAt the look of displeasure, added to the angry tone in which the count\r\nspoke, Ali turned pale and held down his head.\r\n\r\n“It is not your fault, my good Ali,” said the count in the Arabic\r\nlanguage, and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of\r\nshowing, either in voice or face—“it is not your fault. You do not\r\nunderstand the points of English horses.”\r\n\r\nThe countenance of poor Ali recovered its serenity.\r\n\r\n“Permit me to assure your excellency,” said Bertuccio, “that the horses\r\nyou speak of were not to be sold when I purchased yours.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo shrugged his shoulders. “It seems, sir steward,” said he,\r\n“that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as\r\ncare to pay the price.”\r\n\r\n“His excellency is not, perhaps, aware that M. Danglars gave 16,000\r\nfrancs for his horses?”\r\n\r\n“Very well. Then offer him double that sum; a banker never loses an\r\nopportunity of doubling his capital.”\r\n\r\n“Is your excellency really in earnest?” inquired the steward.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words\r\nwith the look of one equally surprised and displeased.\r\n\r\n“I have to pay a visit this evening,” replied he. “I desire that these\r\nhorses, with completely new harness, may be at the door with my\r\ncarriage.”\r\n\r\nBertuccio bowed, and was about to retire; but when he reached the door,\r\nhe paused, and then said, “At what o’clock does your excellency wish\r\nthe carriage and horses to be ready?”\r\n\r\n“At five o’clock,” replied the count.\r\n\r\n“I beg your excellency’s pardon,” interposed the steward in a\r\ndeprecating manner, “for venturing to observe that it is already two\r\no’clock.”\r\n\r\n“I am perfectly aware of that fact,” answered Monte Cristo calmly.\r\nThen, turning towards Ali, he said, “Let all the horses in my stables\r\nbe led before the windows of your young lady, that she may select those\r\nshe prefers for her carriage. Request her also to oblige me by saying\r\nwhether it is her pleasure to dine with me; if so, let dinner be served\r\nin her apartments. Now, leave me, and desire my valet de chambre to\r\ncome hither.”\r\n\r\nScarcely had Ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Baptistin,” said the count, “you have been in my service one\r\nyear, the time I generally give myself to judge of the merits or\r\ndemerits of those about me. You suit me very well.”\r\n\r\nBaptistin bowed low.\r\n\r\n“It only remains for me to know whether I also suit you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, your excellency!” exclaimed Baptistin eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Listen, if you please, till I have finished speaking,” replied Monte\r\nCristo. “You receive 1,500 francs per annum for your services here—more\r\nthan many a brave subaltern, who continually risks his life for his\r\ncountry, obtains. You live in a manner far superior to many clerks who\r\nwork ten times harder than you do for their money. Then, though\r\nyourself a servant, you have other servants to wait upon you, take care\r\nof your clothes, and see that your linen is duly prepared for you.\r\nAgain, you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet,\r\namounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, indeed, your excellency.”\r\n\r\n“I am not condemning you for this, Monsieur Baptistin; but let your\r\nprofits end here. It would be long indeed ere you would find so\r\nlucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill. I\r\nneither ill-use nor ill-treat my servants by word or action. An error I\r\nreadily forgive, but wilful negligence or forgetfulness, never. My\r\ncommands are ordinarily short, clear, and precise; and I would rather\r\nbe obliged to repeat my words twice, or even three times, than they\r\nshould be misunderstood. I am rich enough to know whatever I desire to\r\nknow, and I can promise you I am not wanting in curiosity. If, then, I\r\nshould learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone\r\nfavorably or unfavorably, to comment on my actions, or watch my\r\nconduct, that very instant you would quit my service. You may now\r\nretire. I never caution my servants a second time—remember that.”\r\n\r\nBaptistin bowed, and was proceeding towards the door.\r\n\r\n“I forgot to mention to you,” said the count, “that I lay yearly aside\r\na certain sum for each servant in my establishment; those whom I am\r\ncompelled to dismiss lose (as a matter of course) all participation in\r\nthis money, while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those\r\ndomestics who remain with me, and among whom it will be divided at my\r\ndeath. You have been in my service a year, your fund has already begun\r\nto accumulate—let it continue to do so.”\r\n\r\nThis address, delivered in the presence of Ali, who, not understanding\r\none word of the language in which it was spoken, stood wholly unmoved,\r\nproduced an effect on M. Baptistin only to be conceived by such as have\r\noccasion to study the character and disposition of French domestics.\r\n\r\n“I assure your excellency,” said he, “that at least it shall be my\r\nstudy to merit your approbation in all things, and I will take M. Ali\r\nas my model.”\r\n\r\n“By no means,” replied the count in the most frigid tones; “Ali has\r\nmany faults mixed with most excellent qualities. He cannot possibly\r\nserve you as a pattern for your conduct, not being, as you are, a paid\r\nservant, but a mere slave—a dog, who, should he fail in his duty\r\ntowards me, I should not discharge from my service, but kill.”\r\n\r\nBaptistin opened his eyes with astonishment.\r\n\r\n“You seem incredulous,” said Monte Cristo, who repeated to Ali in the\r\nArabic language what he had just been saying to Baptistin in French.\r\n\r\nThe Nubian smiled assentingly to his master’s words, then, kneeling on\r\none knee, respectfully kissed the hand of the count. This corroboration\r\nof the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the\r\nwonder and stupefaction of M. Baptistin. The count then motioned the\r\nvalet de chambre to retire, and to Ali to follow to his study, where\r\nthey conversed long and earnestly together. As the hand of the clock\r\npointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong. When Ali was\r\nwanted one stroke was given, two summoned Baptistin, and three\r\nBertuccio. The steward entered.\r\n\r\n“My horses,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“They are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency\r\ndesired. Does your excellency wish me to accompany him?”\r\n\r\n“No, the coachman, Ali, and Baptistin will go.”\r\n\r\nThe count descended to the door of his mansion, and beheld his carriage\r\ndrawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning\r\nas the property of Danglars. As he passed them he said:\r\n\r\n“They are extremely handsome certainly, and you have done well to\r\npurchase them, although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured\r\nthem sooner.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, your excellency, I had very considerable difficulty in\r\nobtaining them, and, as it is, they have cost an enormous price.”\r\n\r\n“Does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful,”\r\ninquired the count, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Nay, if your excellency is satisfied, it is all that I could wish.\r\nWhither does your excellency desire to be driven?”\r\n\r\n“To the residence of Baron Danglars, Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin.”\r\n\r\nThis conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace, from which\r\na flight of stone steps led to the carriage-drive. As Bertuccio, with a\r\nrespectful bow, was moving away, the count called him back.\r\n\r\n“I have another commission for you, M. Bertuccio,” said he; “I am\r\ndesirous of having an estate by the seaside in Normandy—for instance,\r\nbetween Le Havre and Boulogne. You see I give you a wide range. It will\r\nbe absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small\r\nharbor, creek, or bay, into which my corvette can enter and remain at\r\nanchor. She draws only fifteen feet. She must be kept in constant\r\nreadiness to sail immediately I think proper to give the signal. Make\r\nthe requisite inquiries for a place of this description, and when you\r\nhave met with an eligible spot, visit it, and if it possess the\r\nadvantages desired, purchase it at once in your own name. The corvette\r\nmust now, I think, be on her way to Fécamp, must she not?”\r\n\r\n20333m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Certainly, your excellency; I saw her put to sea the same evening we\r\nquitted Marseilles.”\r\n\r\n“And the yacht.”\r\n\r\n“Was ordered to remain at Martigues.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis well. I wish you to write from time to time to the captains in\r\ncharge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert.”\r\n\r\n“And the steamboat?”\r\n\r\n“She is at Châlons?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“The same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels.”\r\n\r\n“Very good.”\r\n\r\n“When you have purchased the estate I desire, I want constant relays of\r\nhorses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road.”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency may depend upon me.”\r\n\r\nThe Count made a gesture of satisfaction, descended the terrace steps,\r\nand sprang into his carriage, which was whirled along swiftly to the\r\nbanker’s house.\r\n\r\nDanglars was engaged at that moment, presiding over a railroad\r\ncommittee. But the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his\r\nvisitor was announced. As the count’s title sounded on his ear he rose,\r\nand addressing his colleagues, who were members of one or the other\r\nChamber, he said:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, pardon me for leaving you so abruptly; but a most\r\nridiculous circumstance has occurred, which is this,—Thomson & French,\r\nthe Roman bankers, have sent to me a certain person calling himself the\r\nCount of Monte Cristo, and have given him an unlimited credit with me.\r\nI confess this is the drollest thing I have ever met with in the course\r\nof my extensive foreign transactions, and you may readily suppose it\r\nhas greatly roused my curiosity. I took the trouble this morning to\r\ncall on the pretended count—if he were a real count he wouldn’t be so\r\nrich. But, would you believe it, ‘He was not receiving.’ So the master\r\nof Monte Cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a\r\ncapricious beauty. I made inquiries, and found that the house in the\r\nChamps-Élysées is his own property, and certainly it was very decently\r\nkept up. But,” pursued Danglars with one of his sinister smiles, “an\r\norder for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part\r\nof the banker to whom that order is given. I am very anxious to see\r\nthis man. I suspect a hoax is intended, but the instigators of it\r\nlittle knew whom they had to deal with. ‘They laugh best who laugh\r\nlast!’”\r\n\r\nHaving delivered himself of this pompous address, uttered with a degree\r\nof energy that left the baron almost out of breath, he bowed to the\r\nassembled party and withdrew to his drawing-room, whose sumptuous\r\nfurnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the\r\nChaussée d’Antin. It was to this apartment he had desired his guest to\r\nbe shown, with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much\r\nluxury. He found the count standing before some copies of Albano and\r\nFattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals; but which,\r\nmere copies as they were, seemed to feel their degradation in being\r\nbrought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\nThe count turned round as he heard the entrance of Danglars into the\r\nroom. With a slight inclination of the head, Danglars signed to the\r\ncount to be seated, pointing significantly to a gilded armchair,\r\ncovered with white satin embroidered with gold. The count sat down.\r\n\r\n20335m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I have the honor, I presume, of addressing M. de Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\nThe count bowed.\r\n\r\n“And I of speaking to Baron Danglars, chevalier of the Legion of Honor,\r\nand member of the Chamber of Deputies?”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron’s card.\r\n\r\nDanglars felt the irony and compressed his lips.\r\n\r\n“You will, I trust, excuse me, monsieur, for not calling you by your\r\ntitle when I first addressed you,” he said, “but you are aware that we\r\nare living under a popular form of government, and that I am myself a\r\nrepresentative of the liberties of the people.”\r\n\r\n“So much so,” replied Monte Cristo, “that while you call yourself baron\r\nyou are not willing to call anybody else count.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, monsieur,” said Danglars with affected carelessness, “I\r\nattach no sort of value to such empty distinctions; but the fact is, I\r\nwas made baron, and also chevalier of the Legion of Honor, in return\r\nfor services rendered, but——”\r\n\r\n“But you have discarded your titles after the example set you by\r\nMessrs. de Montmorency and Lafayette? That was a noble example to\r\nfollow, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” replied Danglars, “not entirely so; with the servants,—you\r\nunderstand.”\r\n\r\n“I see; to your domestics you are ‘my lord,’ the journalists style you\r\n‘monsieur,’ while your constituents call you ‘citizen.’ These are\r\ndistinctions very suitable under a constitutional government. I\r\nunderstand perfectly.”\r\n\r\nAgain Danglars bit his lips; he saw that he was no match for Monte\r\nCristo in an argument of this sort, and he therefore hastened to turn\r\nto subjects more congenial.\r\n\r\n“Permit me to inform you, Count,” said he, bowing, “that I have\r\nreceived a letter of advice from Thomson & French, of Rome.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear it, baron,—for I must claim the privilege of\r\naddressing you after the manner of your servants. I have acquired the\r\nbad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country\r\nwhere barons are still barons by right of birth. But as regards the\r\nletter of advice, I am charmed to find that it has reached you; that\r\nwill spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you\r\nfor money myself. You have received a regular letter of advice?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Danglars, “but I confess I didn’t quite comprehend its\r\nmeaning.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\n“And for that reason I did myself the honor of calling upon you, in\r\norder to beg for an explanation.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, monsieur. Here I am, ready to give you any explanation you\r\ndesire.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Danglars, “in the letter—I believe I have it about me”—here\r\nhe felt in his breast-pocket—“yes, here it is. Well, this letter gives\r\nthe Count of Monte Cristo unlimited credit on our house.”\r\n\r\n“Well, baron, what is there difficult to understand about that?”\r\n\r\n“Merely the term _unlimited_—nothing else, certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Is not that word known in France? The people who wrote are\r\nAnglo-Germans, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, as for the composition of the letter, there is nothing to be said;\r\nbut as regards the competency of the document, I certainly have\r\ndoubts.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible?” asked the count, assuming all air and tone of the\r\nutmost simplicity and candor. “Is it possible that Thomson & French are\r\nnot looked upon as safe and solvent bankers? Pray tell me what you\r\nthink, baron, for I feel uneasy, I can assure you, having some\r\nconsiderable property in their hands.”\r\n\r\n“Thomson & French are perfectly solvent,” replied Danglars, with an\r\nalmost mocking smile; “but the word _unlimited_, in financial affairs,\r\nis so extremely vague.”\r\n\r\n“Is, in fact, unlimited,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Precisely what I was about to say,” cried Danglars. “Now what is vague\r\nis doubtful; and it was a wise man who said, ‘when in doubt, keep\r\nout.’”\r\n\r\n“Meaning to say,” rejoined Monte Cristo, “that however Thomson & French\r\nmay be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly, the Baron\r\nDanglars is not disposed to follow their example.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all.”\r\n\r\n“Plainly enough; Messrs. Thomson & French set no bounds to their\r\nengagements while those of M. Danglars have their limits; he is a wise\r\nman, according to his own showing.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” replied the banker, drawing himself up with a haughty air,\r\n“the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned.”\r\n\r\n“It seems, then, reserved for me,” said Monte Cristo coldly, “to be the\r\nfirst to do so.”\r\n\r\n“By what right, sir?”\r\n\r\n“By right of the objections you have raised, and the explanations you\r\nhave demanded, which certainly must have some motive.”\r\n\r\nOnce more Danglars bit his lips. It was the second time he had been\r\nworsted, and this time on his own ground. His forced politeness sat\r\nawkwardly upon him, and approached almost to impertinence. Monte Cristo\r\non the contrary, preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor, aided by a\r\ncertain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure, and thus\r\npossessed the advantage.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” resumed Danglars, after a brief silence, “I will endeavor\r\nto make myself understood, by requesting you to inform me for what sum\r\nyou propose to draw upon me?”\r\n\r\n“Why, truly,” replied Monte Cristo, determined not to lose an inch of\r\nthe ground he had gained, “my reason for desiring an ‘unlimited’ credit\r\nwas precisely because I did not know how much money I might need.”\r\n\r\nThe banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand. So\r\nthrowing himself back in his armchair, he said, with an arrogant and\r\npurse-proud air:\r\n\r\n“Let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes; you will then\r\nbe convinced that the resources of the house of Danglars, however\r\nlimited, are still equal to meeting the largest demands; and were you\r\neven to require a million——”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” interposed Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“I said a million,” replied Danglars, with the confidence of ignorance.\r\n\r\n“But could I do with a million?” retorted the count. “My dear sir, if a\r\ntrifle like that could suffice me, I should never have given myself the\r\ntrouble of opening an account. A million? Excuse my smiling when you\r\nspeak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my pocket-book or\r\ndressing-case.”\r\n\r\nAnd with these words Monte Cristo took from his pocket a small case\r\ncontaining his visiting-cards, and drew forth two orders on the\r\ntreasury for 500,000 francs each, payable at sight to the bearer. A man\r\nlike Danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of\r\ncorrection. The effect of the present revelation was stunning; he\r\ntrembled and was on the verge of apoplexy. The pupils of his eyes, as\r\nhe gazed at Monte Cristo dilated horribly.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said Monte Cristo, “confess honestly that you have not\r\nperfect confidence in Thomson & French. I understand, and foreseeing\r\nthat such might be the case, I took, in spite of my ignorance of\r\naffairs, certain precautions. See, here are two similar letters to that\r\nyou have yourself received; one from the house of Arstein & Eskeles of\r\nVienna, to Baron Rothschild, the other drawn by Baring of London, upon\r\nM. Lafitte. Now, sir, you have but to say the word, and I will spare\r\nyou all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of\r\nthese two firms.”\r\n\r\nThe blow had struck home, and Danglars was entirely vanquished; with a\r\ntrembling hand he took the two letters from the count, who held them\r\ncarelessly between finger and thumb, and proceeded to scrutinize the\r\nsignatures, with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as\r\ninsulting, had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir,” said Danglars, after he had convinced himself of the\r\nauthenticity of the documents he held, and rising as if to salute the\r\npower of gold personified in the man before him,—“three letters of\r\nunlimited credit! I can be no longer mistrustful, but you must pardon\r\nme, my dear count, for confessing to some degree of astonishment.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” answered Monte Cristo, with the most gentlemanly air, “’tis not\r\nfor such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be\r\nincommoded. Then, you can let me have some money, can you not?”\r\n\r\n“Whatever you say, my dear count; I am at your orders.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” replied Monte Cristo, “since we mutually understand each\r\nother—for such I presume is the case?” Danglars bowed assentingly. “You\r\nare quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your\r\nmind?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear count,” exclaimed Danglars, “I never for an instant\r\nentertained such a feeling towards you.”\r\n\r\n“No, you merely wished to be convinced, nothing more; but now that we\r\nhave come to so clear an understanding, and that all distrust and\r\nsuspicion are laid at rest, we may as well fix a sum as the probable\r\nexpenditure of the first year, suppose we say six millions to——”\r\n\r\n“Six millions!” gasped Danglars—“so be it.”\r\n\r\n“Then, if I should require more,” continued Monte Cristo in a careless\r\nmanner, “why, of course, I should draw upon you; but my present\r\nintention is not to remain in France more than a year, and during that\r\nperiod I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I mentioned. However, we\r\nshall see. Be kind enough, then, to send me 500,000 francs tomorrow. I\r\nshall be at home till midday, or if not, I will leave a receipt with my\r\nsteward.”\r\n\r\n“The money you desire shall be at your house by ten o’clock tomorrow\r\nmorning, my dear count,” replied Danglars. “How would you like to have\r\nit? in gold, silver, or notes?”\r\n\r\n“Half in gold, and the other half in bank-notes, if you please,” said\r\nthe count, rising from his seat.\r\n\r\n“I must confess to you, count,” said Danglars, “that I have hitherto\r\nimagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of\r\nEurope, and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me.\r\nMay I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it?”\r\n\r\n“It has been in the family a very long while,” returned Monte Cristo,\r\n“a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain\r\nperiod of years, during which the accumulated interest has doubled the\r\ncapital. The period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these\r\nriches occurred only a short time ago, and they have only been employed\r\nby me within the last few years. Your ignorance on the subject,\r\ntherefore, is easily accounted for. However, you will be better\r\ninformed as to me and my possessions ere long.”\r\n\r\nAnd the count, while pronouncing these latter words, accompanied them\r\nwith one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor\r\nFranz d’Épinay.\r\n\r\n“With your tastes, and means of gratifying them,” continued Danglars,\r\n“you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor\r\nmiserable millionaires quite in the shade. If I mistake not you are an\r\nadmirer of paintings, at least I judged so from the attention you\r\nappeared to be bestowing on mine when I entered the room. If you will\r\npermit me, I shall be happy to show you my picture gallery, composed\r\nentirely of works by the ancient masters—warranted as such. Not a\r\nmodern picture among them. I cannot endure the modern school of\r\npainting.”\r\n\r\n“You are perfectly right in objecting to them, for this one great\r\nfault—that they have not yet had time to become old.”\r\n\r\n“Or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by Thorwaldsen,\r\nBartoloni, and Canova?—all foreign artists, for, as you may perceive, I\r\nthink but very indifferently of our French sculptors.”\r\n\r\n“You have a right to be unjust to them, monsieur; they are your\r\ncompatriots.”\r\n\r\n“But all this may come later, when we shall be better known to each\r\nother. For the present, I will confine myself (if perfectly agreeable\r\nto you) to introducing you to the Baroness Danglars—excuse my\r\nimpatience, my dear count, but a client like you is almost like a\r\nmember of the family.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo bowed, in sign that he accepted the proffered honor;\r\nDanglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery.\r\n\r\n“Is the baroness at home?” inquired Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord,” answered the man.\r\n\r\n“And alone?”\r\n\r\n“No, my lord, madame has visitors.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame, or\r\ndo you desire to preserve a strict _incognito_?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed,” replied Monte Cristo with a smile, “I do not arrogate to\r\nmyself the right of so doing.”\r\n\r\n“And who is with madame?—M. Debray?” inquired Danglars, with an air of\r\nindulgence and good-nature that made Monte Cristo smile, acquainted as\r\nhe was with the secrets of the banker’s domestic life.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord,” replied the servant, “M. Debray is with madame.”\r\n\r\nDanglars nodded his head; then, turning to Monte Cristo, said, “M.\r\nLucien Debray is an old friend of ours, and private secretary to the\r\nMinister of the Interior. As for my wife, I must tell you, she lowered\r\nherself by marrying me, for she belongs to one of the most ancient\r\nfamilies in France. Her maiden name was De Servières, and her first\r\nhusband was Colonel the Marquis of Nargonne.”\r\n\r\n“I have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars; but I have already\r\nmet M. Lucien Debray.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed?” said Danglars; “and where was that?”\r\n\r\n“At the house of M. de Morcerf.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you are acquainted with the young viscount, are you?”\r\n\r\n“We were together a good deal during the Carnival at Rome.”\r\n\r\n“True, true,” cried Danglars. “Let me see; have I not heard talk of\r\nsome strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins, and of his\r\nhaving had a miraculous escape? I forget how, but I know he used to\r\namuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return\r\nfrom Italy.”\r\n\r\n“Her ladyship is waiting to receive you, gentlemen,” said the servant,\r\nwho had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress.\r\n\r\n“With your permission,” said Danglars, bowing, “I will precede you, to\r\nshow you the way.”\r\n\r\n“By all means,” replied Monte Cristo; “I follow you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays\r\n\r\nThe baron, followed by the count, traversed a long series of\r\napartments, in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy\r\nmagnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth, until he reached\r\nthe boudoir of Madame Danglars—a small octagonal-shaped room, hung with\r\npink satin, covered with white Indian muslin. The chairs were of\r\nancient workmanship and materials; over the doors were painted sketches\r\nof shepherds and shepherdesses, after the style and manner of Boucher;\r\nand at each side pretty medallions in crayons, harmonizing well with\r\nthe furnishings of this charming apartment, the only one throughout the\r\ngreat mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed. The truth was,\r\nit had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out\r\nby M. Danglars and his architect, who had been selected to aid the\r\nbaron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most\r\nfashionable and celebrated decorator of the day. The decorations of the\r\nboudoir had then been left entirely to Madame Danglars and Lucien\r\nDebray. M. Danglars, however, while possessing a great admiration for\r\nthe antique, as it was understood during the time of the Directory,\r\nentertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his\r\nwife’s favorite sitting-room, where, by the way, he was never permitted\r\nto intrude, unless, indeed, he excused his own appearance by ushering\r\nin some more agreeable visitor than himself; and even then he had\r\nrather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced, than\r\nthat of being the presenter of another, his reception being cordial or\r\nfrigid, in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to\r\nplease or displease the baroness.\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars (who, although past the first bloom of youth, was still\r\nstrikingly handsome) was now seated at the piano, a most elaborate\r\npiece of cabinet and inlaid work, while Lucien Debray, standing before\r\na small work-table, was turning over the pages of an album.\r\n\r\nLucien had found time, preparatory to the count’s arrival, to relate\r\nmany particulars respecting him to Madame Danglars. It will be\r\nremembered that Monte Cristo had made a lively impression on the minds\r\nof all the party assembled at the breakfast given by Albert de Morcerf;\r\nand although Debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings,\r\nhe had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in\r\nhis mind by the impressive look and manner of the count, consequently\r\nthe description given by Lucien to the baroness bore the highly-colored\r\ntinge of his own heated imagination. Already excited by the wonderful\r\nstories related of the count by de Morcerf, it is no wonder that Madame\r\nDanglars eagerly listened to, and fully credited, all the additional\r\ncircumstances detailed by Debray. This posing at the piano and over the\r\nalbum was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution. A most\r\ngracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on M. Danglars; the\r\ncount, in return for his gentlemanly bow, received a formal though\r\ngraceful courtesy, while Lucien exchanged with the count a sort of\r\ndistant recognition, and with Danglars a free and easy nod.\r\n\r\n“Baroness,” said Danglars, “give me leave to present to you the Count\r\nof Monte Cristo, who has been most warmly recommended to me by my\r\ncorrespondents at Rome. I need but mention one fact to make all the\r\nladies in Paris court his notice, and that is, that he has come to take\r\nup his abode in Paris for a year, during which brief period he proposes\r\nto spend six millions of money. That means balls, dinners, and lawn\r\nparties without end, in all of which I trust the count will remember\r\nus, as he may depend upon it we shall him, in our own humble\r\nentertainments.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address, Madame\r\nDanglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man\r\ncapable of expending six millions in twelve months, and who had\r\nselected Paris for the scene of his princely extravagance.\r\n\r\n“And when did you arrive here?” inquired she.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday morning, madame.”\r\n\r\n“Coming, as usual, I presume, from the extreme end of the globe? Pardon\r\nme—at least, such I have heard is your custom.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, madame. This time I have merely come from Cadiz.”\r\n\r\n“You have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit.\r\nParis is a horrible place in summer. Balls, parties, and _fêtes_ are\r\nover; the Italian opera is in London; the French opera everywhere\r\nexcept in Paris. As for the Théatre Français, you know, of course, that\r\nit is nowhere. The only amusements left us are the indifferent races at\r\nthe Champ-de-Mars and Satory. Do you propose entering any horses at\r\neither of these races, count?”\r\n\r\n“I shall do whatever they do at Paris, madame, if I have the good\r\nfortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas\r\nof amusement.”\r\n\r\n“Are you fond of horses, count?”\r\n\r\n“I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East, madame, and\r\nyou are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two things—the\r\nfine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, count,” said the baroness, “it would have been somewhat more\r\ngallant to have placed the ladies first.”\r\n\r\n“You see, madame, how rightly I spoke when I said I required a\r\npreceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here.”\r\n\r\nAt this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the\r\nboudoir; approaching her mistress, she spoke some words in an\r\nundertone. Madame Danglars turned very pale, then exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“I cannot believe it; the thing is impossible.”\r\n\r\n“I assure you, madame,” replied the woman, “it is as I have said.”\r\n\r\nTurning impatiently towards her husband, Madame Danglars demanded, “Is\r\nthis true?”\r\n\r\n“Is what true, madame?” inquired Danglars, visibly agitated.\r\n\r\n“What my maid tells me.”\r\n\r\n“But what does she tell you?”\r\n\r\n“That when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage,\r\nhe discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his\r\nknowledge. I desire to know what is the meaning of this?”\r\n\r\n“Be kind enough, madame, to listen to me,” said Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; I will listen, monsieur, for I am most curious to hear what\r\nexplanation you will give. These two gentlemen shall decide between us;\r\nbut, first, I will state the case to them. Gentlemen,” continued the\r\nbaroness, “among the ten horses in the stables of Baron Danglars, are\r\ntwo that belong exclusively to me—a pair of the handsomest and most\r\nspirited creatures to be found in Paris. But to you, at least, M.\r\nDebray, I need not give a further description, because to you my\r\nbeautiful pair of dappled grays were well known. Well, I had promised\r\nMadame de Villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the\r\nBois; but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables\r\nthey are gone—positively gone. No doubt M. Danglars has sacrificed them\r\nto the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry\r\nfrancs. Oh, what a detestable crew they are, these mercenary\r\nspeculators!”\r\n\r\n“Madame,” replied Danglars, “the horses were not sufficiently quiet for\r\nyou; they were scarcely four years old, and they made me extremely\r\nuneasy on your account.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” retorted the baroness; “you could not have entertained any\r\nalarm on the subject, because you are perfectly well aware that I have\r\nhad for a month in my service the very best coachman in Paris. But,\r\nperhaps, you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses?”\r\n\r\n“My dear love, pray do not say any more about them, and I promise you\r\nanother pair exactly like them in appearance, only more quiet and\r\nsteady.”\r\n\r\nThe baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt,\r\nwhile her husband, affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture,\r\nturned towards Monte Cristo and said,—“Upon my word, count, I am quite\r\nsorry not to have met you sooner. You are setting up an establishment,\r\nof course?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” replied the count.\r\n\r\n“I should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses. I have\r\nalmost given them away, as it is; but, as I before said, I was anxious\r\nto get rid of them upon any terms. They were only fit for a young man.”\r\n\r\n“I am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me,” said Monte\r\nCristo; “but this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of\r\ncarriage-horses, and I do not think they were dear. There they are.\r\nCome, M. Debray, you are a connoisseur, I believe, let me have your\r\nopinion upon them.”\r\n\r\nAs Debray walked towards the window, Danglars approached his wife.\r\n\r\n“I could not tell you before others,” said he in a low tone, “the\r\nreason of my parting with the horses; but a most enormous price was\r\noffered me this morning for them. Some madman or fool, bent upon\r\nruining himself as fast as he can, actually sent his steward to me to\r\npurchase them at any cost; and the fact is, I have gained 16,000 francs\r\nby the sale of them. Come, don’t look so angry, and you shall have\r\n4,000 francs of the money to do what you like with, and Eugénie shall\r\nhave 2,000. There, what do you think now of the affair? Wasn’t I right\r\nto part with the horses?”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt.\r\n\r\n“Great heavens?” suddenly exclaimed Debray.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked the baroness.\r\n\r\n“I cannot be mistaken; there are your horses! The very animals we were\r\nspeaking of, harnessed to the count’s carriage!”\r\n\r\n“My dappled grays?” demanded the baroness, springing to the window.\r\n“’Tis indeed they!” said she.\r\n\r\nDanglars looked absolutely stupefied.\r\n\r\n“How very singular,” cried Monte Cristo with well-feigned astonishment.\r\n\r\n“I cannot believe it,” murmured the banker. Madame Danglars whispered a\r\nfew words in the ear of Debray, who approached Monte Cristo, saying,\r\n“The baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses.”\r\n\r\n“I scarcely know,” replied the count; “it was a little surprise\r\nprepared for me by my steward, and cost me—well, somewhere about 30,000\r\nfrancs.”\r\n\r\nDebray conveyed the count’s reply to the baroness. Poor Danglars looked\r\nso crest-fallen and discomfited that Monte Cristo assumed a pitying air\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n“See,” said the count, “how very ungrateful women are. Your kind\r\nattention, in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of\r\nthe horses, does not seem to have made the least impression on her. But\r\nso it is; a woman will often, from mere wilfulness, prefer that which\r\nis dangerous to that which is safe. Therefore, in my opinion, my dear\r\nbaron, the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies, and\r\nallow them to act as they please, and then, if any mischief follows,\r\nwhy, at least, they have no one to blame but themselves.”\r\n\r\nDanglars made no reply; he was occupied in anticipations of the coming\r\nscene between himself and the baroness, whose frowning brow, like that\r\nof Olympic Jove, predicted a storm. Debray, who perceived the gathering\r\nclouds, and felt no desire to witness the explosion of Madame Danglars’\r\nrage, suddenly recollected an appointment, which compelled him to take\r\nhis leave; while Monte Cristo, unwilling by prolonging his stay to\r\ndestroy the advantages he hoped to obtain, made a farewell bow and\r\ndeparted, leaving Danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife.\r\n\r\n20347m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Excellent,” murmured Monte Cristo to himself, as he came away. “All\r\nhas gone according to my wishes. The domestic peace of this family is\r\nhenceforth in my hands. Now, then, to play another master-stroke, by\r\nwhich I shall gain the heart of both husband and wife—delightful!\r\nStill,” added he, “amid all this, I have not yet been presented to\r\nMademoiselle Eugénie Danglars, whose acquaintance I should have been\r\nglad to make. But,” he went on with his peculiar smile, “I am here in\r\nParis, and have plenty of time before me—by and by will do for that.”\r\n\r\nWith these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home. Two\r\nhours afterwards, Madame Danglars received a most flattering epistle\r\nfrom the count, in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite\r\n“dappled grays,” protesting that he could not endure the idea of making\r\nhis entry into the Parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that\r\nhis splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely\r\nwoman’s regrets. The horses were sent back wearing the same harness she\r\nhad seen on them in the morning; only, by the count’s orders, in the\r\ncentre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads, had\r\nbeen fastened a large diamond.\r\n\r\nTo Danglars Monte Cristo also wrote, requesting him to excuse the\r\nwhimsical gift of a capricious millionaire, and to beg the baroness to\r\npardon the Eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening, Monte Cristo quitted Paris for Auteuil, accompanied\r\nby Ali. The following day, about three o’clock, a single blow struck on\r\nthe gong summoned Ali to the presence of the count.\r\n\r\n“Ali,” observed his master, as the Nubian entered the chamber, “you\r\nhave frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are\r\nin throwing the lasso, have you not?”\r\n\r\nAli drew himself up proudly, and then returned a sign in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n“I thought I did not mistake. With your lasso you could stop an ox?”\r\n\r\nAgain Ali repeated his affirmative gesture.\r\n\r\n“Or a tiger?”\r\n\r\nAli bowed his head in token of assent.\r\n\r\n“A lion even?”\r\n\r\nAli sprung forwards, imitating the action of one throwing the lasso,\r\nthen of a strangled lion.\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said Monte Cristo; “you wish to tell me you have hunted\r\nthe lion?”\r\n\r\nAli smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed\r\nboth chased and captured many lions.\r\n\r\n“But do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing\r\nforwards with ungovernable fury?”\r\n\r\nThe Nubian smiled.\r\n\r\n“It is well,” said Monte Cristo. “Then listen to me. Ere long a\r\ncarriage will dash past here, drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses\r\nyou saw me with yesterday; now, at the risk of your own life, you must\r\nmanage to stop those horses before my door.”\r\n\r\nAli descended to the street, and marked a straight line on the pavement\r\nimmediately at the entrance of the house, and then pointed out the line\r\nhe had traced to the count, who was watching him. The count patted him\r\ngently on the shoulder, his usual mode of praising Ali, who, pleased\r\nand gratified with the commission assigned him, walked calmly towards a\r\nprojecting stone forming the angle of the street and house, and,\r\nseating himself thereon, began to smoke his chibouque, while Monte\r\nCristo re-entered his dwelling, perfectly assured of the success of his\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nStill, as five o’clock approached, and the carriage was momentarily\r\nexpected by the count, the indication of more than common impatience\r\nand uneasiness might be observed in his manner. He stationed himself in\r\na room commanding a view of the street, pacing the chamber with\r\nrestless steps, stopping merely to listen from time to time for the\r\nsound of approaching wheels, then to cast an anxious glance on Ali; but\r\nthe regularity with which the Nubian puffed forth the smoke of his\r\nchibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment\r\nof his favorite occupation.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard, and\r\nalmost immediately a carriage appeared, drawn by a pair of wild,\r\nungovernable horses, while the terrified coachman strove in vain to\r\nrestrain their furious speed.\r\n\r\nIn the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight\r\nclasped in each other’s arms. Terror seemed to have deprived them even\r\nof the power of uttering a cry. The carriage creaked and rattled as it\r\nflew over the rough stones, and the slightest obstacle under the wheels\r\nwould have caused disaster; but it kept on in the middle of the road,\r\nand those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror.\r\n\r\nAli suddenly cast aside his chibouque, drew the lasso from his pocket,\r\nthrew it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its\r\ntriple fold, and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by\r\nthe violence of the shock, then the animal fell over on the pole, which\r\nsnapped, and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way.\r\nGladly availing himself of this opportunity, the coachman leaped from\r\nhis box; but Ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse,\r\nand held them in his iron grasp, till the beast, snorting with pain,\r\nsunk beside his companion.\r\n\r\nAll this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the\r\nrecital. The brief space had, however, been sufficient for a man,\r\nfollowed by a number of servants, to rush from the house before which\r\nthe accident had occurred, and, as the coachman opened the door of the\r\ncarriage, to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the\r\ncushions with one hand, while with the other she pressed to her bosom\r\nthe young boy, who had lost consciousness. Monte Cristo carried them\r\nboth to the salon, and deposited them on a sofa.\r\n\r\n“Compose yourself, madame,” said he; “all danger is over.” The woman\r\nlooked up at these words, and, with a glance far more expressive than\r\nany entreaties could have been, pointed to her child, who still\r\ncontinued insensible. “I understand the nature of your alarms, madame,”\r\nsaid the count, carefully examining the child, “but I assure you there\r\nis not the slightest occasion for uneasiness; your little charge has\r\nnot received the least injury; his insensibility is merely the effects\r\nof terror, and will soon pass.”\r\n\r\n“Are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears? See how\r\ndeadly pale he is! My child, my darling Edward; speak to your\r\nmother—open your dear eyes and look on me once again! Oh, sir, in pity\r\nsend for a physician; my whole fortune shall not be thought too much\r\nfor the recovery of my boy.”\r\n\r\nWith a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand, Monte Cristo signed to\r\nthe distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions; then, opening a\r\ncasket that stood near, he drew forth a phial of Bohemian glass\r\nincrusted with gold, containing a liquid of the color of blood, of\r\nwhich he let fall a single drop on the child’s lips. Scarcely had it\r\nreached them, ere the boy, though still pale as marble, opened his\r\neyes, and eagerly gazed around him. At this, the delight of the mother\r\nwas almost frantic.\r\n\r\n“Where am I?” exclaimed she; “and to whom am I indebted for so happy a\r\ntermination to my late dreadful alarm?”\r\n\r\n“Madame,” answered the count, “you are under the roof of one who\r\nesteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a\r\nfurther continuance of your sufferings.”\r\n\r\n“My wretched curiosity has brought all this about,” pursued the lady.\r\n“All Paris rung with the praises of Madame Danglars’ beautiful horses,\r\nand I had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the\r\nhigh praise given to them.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible,” exclaimed the count with well-feigned astonishment,\r\n“that these horses belong to the baroness?”\r\n\r\n“They do, indeed. May I inquire if you are acquainted with Madame\r\nDanglars?”\r\n\r\n20351m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I have that honor; and my happiness at your escape from the danger\r\nthat threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that I have been\r\nthe unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have\r\nincurred. I yesterday purchased these horses of the baron; but as the\r\nbaroness evidently regretted parting with them, I ventured to send them\r\nback to her, with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them\r\nfrom my hands.”\r\n\r\n“You are, then, doubtless, the Count of Monte Cristo, of whom Hermine\r\nhas talked to me so much?”\r\n\r\n“You have rightly guessed, madame,” replied the count.\r\n\r\n“And I am Madame Héloïse de Villefort.”\r\n\r\nThe count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“How grateful will M. de Villefort be for all your goodness; how\r\nthankfully will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence\r\nof his wife and child! Most certainly, but for the prompt assistance of\r\nyour intrepid servant, this dear child and myself must both have\r\nperished.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in.”\r\n\r\n“I trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your\r\nman.”\r\n\r\n“I beseech you, madame,” replied Monte Cristo “not to spoil Ali, either\r\nby too great praise or rewards. I cannot allow him to acquire the habit\r\nof expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may\r\nrender. Ali is my slave, and in saving your life he was but discharging\r\nhis duty to me.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” interposed Madame de Villefort, on whom the authoritative style\r\nadopted by the count made a deep impression, “nay, but consider that to\r\npreserve my life he has risked his own.”\r\n\r\n“His life, madame, belongs not to him; it is mine, in return for my\r\nhaving myself saved him from death.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort made no further reply; her mind was utterly\r\nabsorbed in the contemplation of the person who, from the first instant\r\nshe saw him, had made so powerful an impression on her.\r\n\r\nDuring the evident preoccupation of Madame de Villefort, Monte Cristo\r\nscrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in\r\nher arms, lavishing on him the most tender endearments. The child was\r\nsmall for his age, and unnaturally pale. A mass of straight black hair,\r\ndefying all attempts to train or curl it, fell over his projecting\r\nforehead, and hung down to his shoulders, giving increased vivacity to\r\neyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness\r\nfor every forbidden enjoyment. His mouth was large, and the lips, which\r\nhad not yet regained their color, were particularly thin; in fact, the\r\ndeep and crafty look, giving a predominant expression to the child’s\r\nface, belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so\r\nyoung. His first movement was to free himself by a violent push from\r\nthe encircling arms of his mother, and to rush forward to the casket\r\nfrom whence the count had taken the phial of elixir; then, without\r\nasking permission of anyone, he proceeded, in all the wilfulness of a\r\nspoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices, to\r\npull the corks out of all the bottles.\r\n\r\n“Touch nothing, my little friend,” cried the count eagerly; “some of\r\nthose liquids are not only dangerous to taste, but even to inhale.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort became very pale, and, seizing her son’s arm, drew\r\nhim anxiously toward her; but, once satisfied of his safety, she also\r\ncast a brief but expressive glance on the casket, which was not lost\r\nupon the count. At this moment Ali entered. At sight of him Madame de\r\nVillefort uttered an expression of pleasure, and, holding the child\r\nstill closer towards her, she said:\r\n\r\n“Edward, dearest, do you see that good man? He has shown very great\r\ncourage and resolution, for he exposed his own life to stop the horses\r\nthat were running away with us, and would certainly have dashed the\r\ncarriage to pieces. Thank him, then, my child, in your very best\r\nmanner; for, had he not come to our aid, neither you nor I would have\r\nbeen alive to speak our thanks.”\r\n\r\nThe child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful\r\nmanner, saying, “He’s too ugly.”\r\n\r\n20353m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes, while\r\nMadame de Villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and\r\nmoderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having\r\nbeen committed.\r\n\r\n“This lady,” said the Count, speaking to Ali in the Arabic language,\r\n“is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives;\r\nbut the boy refuses, saying you are too ugly.”\r\n\r\nAli turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy, on whom he\r\ngazed without any apparent emotion; but the spasmodic working of the\r\nnostrils showed to the practiced eye of Monte Cristo that the Arab had\r\nbeen wounded to the heart.\r\n\r\n“Will you permit me to inquire,” said Madame de Villefort, as she arose\r\nto take her leave, “whether you usually reside here?”\r\n\r\n“No, I do not,” replied Monte Cristo; “it is a small place I have\r\npurchased quite lately. My place of abode is No. 30, Avenue des\r\nChamps-Élysées; but I see you have quite recovered from your fright,\r\nand are, no doubt, desirous of returning home. Anticipating your\r\nwishes, I have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one\r\nof my carriages, and Ali, he whom you think so very ugly,” continued\r\nhe, addressing the boy with a smiling air, “will have the honor of\r\ndriving you home, while your coachman remains here to attend to the\r\nnecessary repairs of your calash. As soon as that important business is\r\nconcluded, I will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it\r\ndirect to Madame Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“I dare not return with those dreadful horses,” said Madame de\r\nVillefort.\r\n\r\n“You will see,” replied Monte Cristo, “that they will be as different\r\nas possible in the hands of Ali. With him they will be gentle and\r\ndocile as lambs.”\r\n\r\nAli had, indeed, given proof of this; for, approaching the animals, who\r\nhad been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty, he rubbed\r\ntheir foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar,\r\nand wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths. Then,\r\ncommencing a loud whistling noise, he rubbed them well all over their\r\nbodies for several minutes; then, undisturbed by the noisy crowd\r\ncollected round the broken carriage, Ali quietly harnessed the pacified\r\nanimals to the count’s chariot, took the reins in his hands, and\r\nmounted the box, when to the utter astonishment of those who had\r\nwitnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same\r\nhorses, he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle\r\nmanner before he could induce them to start; and even then all that\r\ncould be obtained from the celebrated “dappled grays,” now changed into\r\na couple of dull, sluggish, stupid brutes, was a slow, pottering pace,\r\nkept up with so much difficulty that Madame de Villefort was more than\r\ntwo hours returning to her residence in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.\r\n\r\n20355m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been\r\ngone through when she wrote the following letter to Madame Danglars:—\r\n\r\n“Dear Hermine,—I have just had a wonderful escape from the most\r\nimminent danger, and I owe my safety to the very Count of Monte Cristo\r\nwe were talking about yesterday, but whom I little expected to see\r\ntoday. I remember how unmercifully I laughed at what I considered your\r\neulogistic and exaggerated praises of him; but I have now ample cause\r\nto admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell\r\nfar short of his merits. Your horses got as far as Ranelagh, when they\r\ndarted forward like mad things, and galloped away at so fearful a rate,\r\nthat there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor Edward but\r\nthat of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded\r\ntheir progress, when a strange-looking man,—an Arab, a negro, or a\r\nNubian, at least a black of some nation or other—at a signal from the\r\ncount, whose domestic he is, suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated\r\nanimals, even at the risk of being trampled to death himself; and\r\ncertainly he must have had a most wonderful escape. The count then\r\nhastened to us, and took us into his house, where he speedily recalled\r\nmy poor Edward to life. He sent us home in his own carriage. Yours will\r\nbe returned to you tomorrow. You will find your horses in bad\r\ncondition, from the results of this accident; they seem thoroughly\r\nstupefied, as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man. The\r\ncount, however, has commissioned me to assure you that two or three\r\ndays’ rest, with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time,\r\nwill bring them back to as fine, that is as terrifying, a condition as\r\nthey were in yesterday.\r\n\r\n20356m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdieu! I cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday; but,\r\nafter all, I ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses,\r\nmore especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to\r\nthe Count of Monte Cristo,—and certainly that illustrious personage,\r\napart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of,\r\nseemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems I, for one,\r\ndelight in solving at any risk, even if it were to necessitate another\r\ndrive to the Bois behind your horses.\r\n\r\nEdward endured the accident with miraculous courage—he did not utter a\r\nsingle cry, but fell lifeless into my arms; nor did a tear fall from\r\nhis eyes after it was over. I doubt not you will consider these praises\r\nthe result of blind maternal affection, but there is a soul of iron in\r\nthat delicate, fragile body. Valentine sends many affectionate\r\nremembrances to your dear Eugénie. I embrace you with all my heart.\r\n\r\nHéloïse de Villefort.\r\n\r\nP.S.—Do pray contrive some means for me to meet the Count of Monte\r\nCristo at your house. I must and will see him again. I have just made\r\nM. de Villefort promise to call on him, and I hope the visit will be\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nThat night the adventure at Auteuil was talked of everywhere. Albert\r\nrelated it to his mother; Château-Renaud recounted it at the Jockey\r\nClub, and Debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister;\r\neven Beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of\r\nthe count’s courage and gallantry, thereby celebrating him as the\r\ngreatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nVast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their\r\nnames at the residence of Madame de Villefort, with the design of\r\nrenewing their visit at the right moment, of hearing from her lips all\r\nthe interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure.\r\n\r\nAs for M. de Villefort, he fulfilled the predictions of Héloïse to the\r\nletter,—donned his dress suit, drew on a pair of white gloves, ordered\r\nthe servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery, and\r\ndrove that same night to No. 30 in the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME THREE\r\n\r\n30009m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30011m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 48. Ideology\r\n\r\nIf the Count of Monte Cristo had been for a long time familiar with the\r\nways of Parisian society, he would have appreciated better the\r\nsignificance of the step which M. de Villefort had taken. Standing well\r\nat court, whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch,\r\nwhether the government was doctrinaire liberal, or conservative; looked\r\nupon by all as a man of talent, since those who have never experienced\r\na political check are generally so regarded; hated by many, but warmly\r\nsupported by others, without being really liked by anybody, M. de\r\nVillefort held a high position in the magistracy, and maintained his\r\neminence like a Harlay or a Molé. His drawing-room, under the\r\nregenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first\r\nmarriage, scarcely eighteen, was still one of the well-regulated Paris\r\nsalons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of\r\nrigid etiquette were carefully maintained. A freezing politeness, a\r\nstrict fidelity to government principles, a profound contempt for\r\ntheories and theorists, a deep-seated hatred of ideality,—these were\r\nthe elements of private and public life displayed by M. de Villefort.\r\n\r\n30023m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort was not only a magistrate, he was almost a diplomatist.\r\nHis relations with the former court, of which he always spoke with\r\ndignity and respect, made him respected by the new one, and he knew so\r\nmany things, that not only was he always carefully considered, but\r\nsometimes consulted. Perhaps this would not have been so had it been\r\npossible to get rid of M. de Villefort; but, like the feudal barons who\r\nrebelled against their sovereign, he dwelt in an impregnable fortress.\r\nThis fortress was his post as king’s attorney, all the advantages of\r\nwhich he exploited with marvellous skill, and which he would not have\r\nresigned but to be made deputy, and thus to replace neutrality by\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily M. de Villefort made and returned very few visits. His wife\r\nvisited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where\r\nthe weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were\r\naccepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride, a\r\nmanifestation of professed superiority—in fact, the application of the\r\naxiom, _Pretend to think well of yourself, and the world will think\r\nwell of you_, an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays\r\nthan that of the Greeks, “Know thyself,” a knowledge for which, in our\r\ndays, we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous\r\nscience of _knowing others_.\r\n\r\nTo his friends M. de Villefort was a powerful protector; to his\r\nenemies, he was a silent, but bitter opponent; for those who were\r\nneither the one nor the other, he was a statue of the law-made man. He\r\nhad a haughty bearing, a look either steady and impenetrable or\r\ninsolently piercing and inquisitorial. Four successive revolutions had\r\nbuilt and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based.\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the\r\nleast wearisome man in France. He gave a ball every year, at which he\r\nappeared for a quarter of an hour only,—that is to say, five-and-forty\r\nminutes less than the king is visible at his balls. He was never seen\r\nat the theatres, at concerts, or in any place of public resort.\r\nOccasionally, but seldom, he played at whist, and then care was taken\r\nto select partners worthy of him—sometimes they were ambassadors,\r\nsometimes archbishops, or sometimes a prince, or a president, or some\r\ndowager duchess.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the Count\r\nof Monte Cristo’s door. The valet de chambre announced M. de Villefort\r\nat the moment when the count, leaning over a large table, was tracing\r\non a map the route from St. Petersburg to China.\r\n\r\nThe procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would\r\nhave employed in entering a court of justice. He was the same man, or\r\nrather the development of the same man, whom we have heretofore seen as\r\nassistant attorney at Marseilles. Nature, according to her way, had\r\nmade no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself. From being\r\nslender he had now become meagre; once pale, he was now yellow; his\r\ndeep-set eyes were hollow, and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes\r\nseemed to be an integral portion of his face. He dressed entirely in\r\nblack, with the exception of his white tie, and his funeral appearance\r\nwas only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost\r\nimperceptibly through his button-hole, and appeared like a streak of\r\nblood traced with a delicate brush.\r\n\r\nAlthough master of himself, Monte Cristo, scrutinized with\r\nirrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned, and\r\nwho, distrustful by habit, and especially incredulous as to social\r\nprodigies, was much more despised to look upon “the noble stranger,” as\r\nMonte Cristo was already called, as an adventurer in search of new\r\nfields, or an escaped criminal, rather than as a prince of the Holy\r\nSee, or a sultan of the _Thousand and One Nights_.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Villefort, in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in\r\ntheir oratorical periods, and of which they cannot, or will not, divest\r\nthemselves in society, “sir, the signal service which you yesterday\r\nrendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my\r\nthanks. I have come, therefore, to discharge this duty, and to express\r\nto you my overwhelming gratitude.”\r\n\r\nAnd as he said this, the “eye severe” of the magistrate had lost\r\nnothing of its habitual arrogance. He spoke in a voice of the\r\nprocureur-general, with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders\r\nwhich caused his flatterers to say (as we have before observed) that he\r\nwas the living statue of the law.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” replied the count, with a chilling air, “I am very happy to\r\nhave been the means of preserving a son to his mother, for they say\r\nthat the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all; and the good\r\nfortune which occurred to me, monsieur, might have enabled you to\r\ndispense with a duty which, in its discharge, confers an undoubtedly\r\ngreat honor; for I am aware that M. de Villefort is not usually lavish\r\nof the favor which he now bestows on me,—a favor which, however\r\nestimable, is unequal to the satisfaction which I have in my own\r\nconsciousness.”\r\n\r\nVillefort, astonished at this reply, which he by no means expected,\r\nstarted like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the\r\narmor he wears, and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from\r\nthat moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the Count of\r\nMonte Cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman.\r\n\r\nHe glanced around, in order to seize on something on which the\r\nconversation might turn, and seemed to fall easily on a topic. He saw\r\nthe map which Monte Cristo had been examining when he entered, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“You seem geographically engaged, sir? It is a rich study for you, who,\r\nas I learn, have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” replied the count; “I have sought to make of the human\r\nrace, taken in the mass, what you practice every day on individuals—a\r\nphysiological study. I have believed it was much easier to descend from\r\nthe whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole. It is an\r\nalgebraic axiom, which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown\r\nquantity, and not from an unknown to a known; but sit down, sir, I beg\r\nof you.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo pointed to a chair, which the procureur was obliged to\r\ntake the trouble to move forwards himself, while the count merely fell\r\nback into his own, on which he had been kneeling when M. Villefort\r\nentered. Thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor, having\r\nhis back towards the window, his elbow resting on the geographical\r\nchart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment,—a\r\nconversation which assumed, as in the case of the interviews with\r\nDanglars and Morcerf, a turn analogous to the persons, if not to the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n“Ah, you philosophize,” replied Villefort, after a moment’s silence,\r\nduring which, like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent, he\r\ntook breath; “well, sir, really, if, like you, I had nothing else to\r\ndo, I should seek a more amusing occupation.”\r\n\r\n“Why, in truth, sir,” was Monte Cristo’s reply, “man is but an ugly\r\ncaterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope; but you\r\nsaid, I think, that I had nothing else to do. Now, really, let me ask,\r\nsir, have you?—do you believe you have anything to do? or to speak in\r\nplain terms, do you really think that what you do deserves being called\r\nanything?”\r\n\r\nVillefort’s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly\r\nmade by his strange adversary. It was a long time since the magistrate\r\nhad heard a paradox so strong, or rather, to say the truth more\r\nexactly, it was the first time he had ever heard of it. The procureur\r\nexerted himself to reply.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” he responded, “you are a stranger, and I believe you say\r\nyourself that a portion of your life has been spent in Oriental\r\ncountries, so you are not aware how human justice, so expeditious in\r\nbarbarous countries, takes with us a prudent and well-studied course.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes—yes, I do, sir; it is the _pede claudo_ of the ancients. I\r\nknow all that, for it is with the justice of all countries especially\r\nthat I have occupied myself—it is with the criminal procedure of all\r\nnations that I have compared natural justice, and I must say, sir, that\r\nit is the law of primitive nations, that is, the law of retaliation,\r\nthat I have most frequently found to be according to the law of God.”\r\n\r\n“If this law were adopted, sir,” said the procureur, “it would greatly\r\nsimplify our legal codes, and in that case the magistrates would not\r\n(as you just observed) have much to do.”\r\n\r\n“It may, perhaps, come to this in time,” observed Monte Cristo; “you\r\nknow that human inventions march from the complex to the simple, and\r\nsimplicity is always perfection.”\r\n\r\n“In the meanwhile,” continued the magistrate, “our codes are in full\r\nforce, with all their contradictory enactments derived from Gallic\r\ncustoms, Roman laws, and Frank usages; the knowledge of all which, you\r\nwill agree, is not to be acquired without extended labor; it needs\r\ntedious study to acquire this knowledge, and, when acquired, a strong\r\npower of brain to retain it.”\r\n\r\n“I agree with you entirely, sir; but all that even you know with\r\nrespect to the French code, I know, not only in reference to that code,\r\nbut as regards the codes of all nations. The English, Turkish,\r\nJapanese, Hindu laws, are as familiar to me as the French laws, and\r\nthus I was right, when I said to you, that relatively (you know that\r\neverything is relative, sir)—that relatively to what I have done, you\r\nhave very little to do; but that relatively to all I have learned, you\r\nhave yet a great deal to learn.”\r\n\r\n“But with what motive have you learned all this?” inquired Villefort,\r\nin astonishment.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo smiled.\r\n\r\n“Really, sir,” he observed, “I see that in spite of the reputation\r\nwhich you have acquired as a superior man, you look at everything from\r\nthe material and vulgar view of society, beginning with man, and ending\r\nwith man—that is to say, in the most restricted, most narrow view which\r\nit is possible for human understanding to embrace.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, sir, explain yourself,” said Villefort, more and more\r\nastonished, “I really do—not—understand you—perfectly.”\r\n\r\n“I say, sir, that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of\r\nnations, you see only the springs of the machine, and lose sight of the\r\nsublime workman who makes them act; I say that you do not recognize\r\nbefore you and around you any but those office-holders whose\r\ncommissions have been signed by a minister or king; and that the men\r\nwhom God has put above those office-holders, ministers, and kings, by\r\ngiving them a mission to follow out, instead of a post to fill—I say\r\nthat they escape your narrow, limited field of observation. It is thus\r\nthat human weakness fails, from its debilitated and imperfect organs.\r\nTobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young\r\nman. The nations took Attila, who was doomed to destroy them, for a\r\nconqueror similar to other conquerors, and it was necessary for both to\r\nreveal their missions, that they might be known and acknowledged; one\r\nwas compelled to say, ‘I am the angel of the Lord’; and the other, ‘I\r\nam the hammer of God,’ in order that the divine essence in both might\r\nbe revealed.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Villefort, more and more amazed, and really supposing he\r\nwas speaking to a mystic or a madman, “you consider yourself as one of\r\nthose extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned?”\r\n\r\n“And why not?” said Monte Cristo coldly.\r\n\r\n“Your pardon, sir,” replied Villefort, quite astounded, “but you will\r\nexcuse me if, when I presented myself to you, I was unaware that I\r\nshould meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far\r\nsurpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men. It is not usual\r\nwith us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like\r\nyourself, possessors, as you are, of immense fortune—at least, so it is\r\nsaid—and I beg you to observe that I do not inquire, I merely\r\nrepeat;—it is not usual, I say, for such privileged and wealthy beings\r\nto waste their time in speculations on the state of society, in\r\nphilosophical reveries, intended at best to console those whom fate has\r\ndisinherited from the goods of this world.”\r\n\r\n“Really, sir,” retorted the count, “have you attained the eminent\r\nsituation in which you are, without having admitted, or even without\r\nhaving met with exceptions? and do you never use your eyes, which must\r\nhave acquired so much _finesse_ and certainty, to divine, at a glance,\r\nthe kind of man by whom you are confronted? Should not a magistrate be\r\nnot merely the best administrator of the law, but the most crafty\r\nexpounder of the chicanery of his profession, a steel probe to search\r\nhearts, a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with\r\nmore or less of alloy?”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Villefort, “upon my word, you overcome me. I really never\r\nheard a person speak as you do.”\r\n\r\n“Because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general\r\nconditions, and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper\r\nspheres which God has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings.”\r\n\r\n“And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and\r\ninvisible beings mingle amongst us?”\r\n\r\n“Why should they not? Can you see the air you breathe, and yet without\r\nwhich you could not for a moment exist?”\r\n\r\n“Then we do not see those beings to whom you allude?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we do; you see them whenever God pleases to allow them to assume\r\na material form. You touch them, come in contact with them, speak to\r\nthem, and they reply to you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Villefort, smiling, “I confess I should like to be warned\r\nwhen one of these beings is in contact with me.”\r\n\r\n“You have been served as you desire, monsieur, for you were warned just\r\nnow, and I now again warn you.”\r\n\r\n“Then you yourself are one of these marked beings?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur, I believe so; for until now, no man has found himself\r\nin a position similar to mine. The dominions of kings are limited\r\neither by mountains or rivers, or a change of manners, or an alteration\r\nof language. My kingdom is bounded only by the world, for I am not an\r\nItalian, or a Frenchman, or a Hindu, or an American, or a Spaniard—I am\r\na cosmopolite. No country can say it saw my birth. God alone knows what\r\ncountry will see me die. I adopt all customs, speak all languages. You\r\nbelieve me to be a Frenchman, for I speak French with the same facility\r\nand purity as yourself. Well, Ali, my Nubian, believes me to be an\r\nArab; Bertuccio, my steward, takes me for a Roman; Haydée, my slave,\r\nthinks me a Greek. You may, therefore, comprehend, that being of no\r\ncountry, asking no protection from any government, acknowledging no man\r\nas my brother, not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful, or the\r\nobstacles which paralyze the weak, paralyzes or arrests me. I have only\r\ntwo adversaries—I will not say two conquerors, for with perseverance I\r\nsubdue even them,—they are time and distance. There is a third, and the\r\nmost terrible—that is my condition as a mortal being. This alone can\r\nstop me in my onward career, before I have attained the goal at which I\r\naim, for all the rest I have reduced to mathematical terms. What men\r\ncall the chances of fate—namely, ruin, change, circumstances—I have\r\nfully anticipated, and if any of these should overtake me, yet it will\r\nnot overwhelm me. Unless I die, I shall always be what I am, and\r\ntherefore it is that I utter the things you have never heard, even from\r\nthe mouths of kings—for kings have need, and other persons have fear of\r\nyou. For who is there who does not say to himself, in a society as\r\nincongruously organized as ours, ‘Perhaps some day I shall have to do\r\nwith the king’s attorney’?”\r\n\r\n“But can you not say that, sir? The moment you become an inhabitant of\r\nFrance, you are naturally subjected to the French law.”\r\n\r\n“I know it sir,” replied Monte Cristo; “but when I visit a country I\r\nbegin to study, by all the means which are available, the men from whom\r\nI may have anything to hope or to fear, till I know them as well as,\r\nperhaps better than, they know themselves. It follows from this, that\r\nthe king’s attorney, be he who he may, with whom I should have to deal,\r\nwould assuredly be more embarrassed than I should.”\r\n\r\n“That is to say,” replied Villefort with hesitation, “that human nature\r\nbeing weak, every man, according to your creed, has committed faults.”\r\n\r\n“Faults or crimes,” responded Monte Cristo with a negligent air.\r\n\r\n“And that you alone, amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your\r\nbrothers—for you have said so,” observed Villefort in a tone that\r\nfaltered somewhat—“you alone are perfect.”\r\n\r\n“No, not perfect,” was the count’s reply; “only impenetrable, that’s\r\nall. But let us leave off this strain, sir, if the tone of it is\r\ndispleasing to you; I am no more disturbed by your justice than are you\r\nby my second-sight.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,—by no means,” said Villefort, who was afraid of seeming to\r\nabandon his ground. “No; by your brilliant and almost sublime\r\nconversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level; we no\r\nlonger talk, we rise to dissertation. But you know how the theologians\r\nin their collegiate chairs, and philosophers in their controversies,\r\noccasionally say cruel truths; let us suppose for the moment that we\r\nare theologizing in a social way, or even philosophically, and I will\r\nsay to you, rude as it may seem, ‘My brother, you sacrifice greatly to\r\npride; you may be above others, but above you there is God.’”\r\n\r\n30029m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Above us all, sir,” was Monte Cristo’s response, in a tone and with an\r\nemphasis so deep that Villefort involuntarily shuddered. “I have my\r\npride for men—serpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass\r\nwithout crushing them under foot. But I lay aside that pride before\r\nGod, who has taken me from nothing to make me what I am.”\r\n\r\n“Then, count, I admire you,” said Villefort, who, for the first time in\r\nthis strange conversation, used the aristocratic form to the unknown\r\npersonage, whom, until now, he had only called monsieur. “Yes, and I\r\nsay to you, if you are really strong, really superior, really pious, or\r\nimpenetrable, which you were right in saying amounts to the same\r\nthing—then be proud, sir, for that is the characteristic of\r\npredominance. Yet you have unquestionably some ambition.”\r\n\r\n“I have, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And what may it be?”\r\n\r\n“I too, as happens to every man once in his life, have been taken by\r\nSatan into the highest mountain in the earth, and when there he showed\r\nme all the kingdoms of the world, and as he said before, so said he to\r\nme, ‘Child of earth, what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me?’ I\r\nreflected long, for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me, and\r\nthen I replied, ‘Listen,—I have always heard of Providence, and yet I\r\nhave never seen him, or anything that resembles him, or which can make\r\nme believe that he exists. I wish to be Providence myself, for I feel\r\nthat the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is\r\nto recompense and punish.’ Satan bowed his head, and groaned. ‘You\r\nmistake,’ he said, ‘Providence does exist, only you have never seen\r\nhim, because the child of God is as invisible as the parent. You have\r\nseen nothing that resembles him, because he works by secret springs,\r\nand moves by hidden ways. All I can do for you is to make you one of\r\nthe agents of that Providence.’ The bargain was concluded. I may\r\nsacrifice my soul, but what matters it?” added Monte Cristo. “If the\r\nthing were to do again, I would again do it.”\r\n\r\nVillefort looked at Monte Cristo with extreme amazement.\r\n\r\n“Count,” he inquired, “have you any relations?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, I am alone in the world.”\r\n\r\n“So much the worse.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down\r\nyour pride. You say you fear nothing but death?”\r\n\r\n“I did not say that I feared it; I only said that death alone could\r\ncheck the execution of my plans.”\r\n\r\n“And old age?”\r\n\r\n“My end will be achieved before I grow old.”\r\n\r\n“And madness?”\r\n\r\n“I have been nearly mad; and you know the axiom,—_non bis in idem_. It\r\nis an axiom of criminal law, and, consequently, you understand its full\r\napplication.”\r\n\r\n30031m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sir,” continued Villefort, “there is something to fear besides death,\r\nold age, and madness. For instance, there is apoplexy—that\r\nlightning-stroke which strikes but does not destroy you, and yet which\r\nbrings everything to an end. You are still yourself as now, and yet you\r\nare yourself no longer; you who, like Ariel, verge on the angelic, are\r\nbut an inert mass, which, like Caliban, verges on the brutal; and this\r\nis called in human tongues, as I tell you, neither more nor less than\r\napoplexy. Come, if so you will, count, and continue this conversation\r\nat my house, any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of\r\nunderstanding and anxious to refute you, and I will show you my father,\r\nM. Noirtier de Villefort, one of the most fiery Jacobins of the French\r\nRevolution; that is to say, he had the most remarkable audacity,\r\nseconded by a most powerful organization—a man who has not, perhaps,\r\nlike yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth, but who has helped to\r\noverturn one of the greatest; in fact, a man who believed himself, like\r\nyou, one of the envoys, not of God, but of a supreme being; not of\r\nProvidence, but of fate. Well, sir, the rupture of a blood-vessel on\r\nthe lobe of the brain has destroyed all this, not in a day, not in an\r\nhour, but in a second. M. Noirtier, who, on the previous night, was the\r\nold Jacobin, the old senator, the old Carbonaro, laughing at the\r\nguillotine, the cannon, and the dagger—M. Noirtier, playing with\r\nrevolutions—M. Noirtier, for whom France was a vast chess-board, from\r\nwhich pawns, rooks, knights, and queens were to disappear, so that the\r\nking was checkmated—M. Noirtier, the redoubtable, was the next morning\r\n_poor M. Noirtier_, the helpless old man, at the tender mercies of the\r\nweakest creature in the household, that is, his grandchild, Valentine;\r\na dumb and frozen carcass, in fact, living painlessly on, that time may\r\nbe given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its\r\ndecay.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, sir,” said Monte Cristo “this spectacle is neither strange to my\r\neye nor my thought. I am something of a physician, and have, like my\r\nfellows, sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead\r\nmatter; yet, like Providence, it has remained invisible to my eyes,\r\nalthough present to my heart. A hundred writers since Socrates, Seneca,\r\nSt. Augustine, and Gall, have made, in verse and prose, the comparison\r\nyou have made, and yet I can well understand that a father’s sufferings\r\nmay effect great changes in the mind of a son. I will call on you, sir,\r\nsince you bid me contemplate, for the advantage of my pride, this\r\nterrible spectacle, which must have been so great a source of sorrow to\r\nyour family.”\r\n\r\n“It would have been so unquestionably, had not God given me so large a\r\ncompensation. In contrast with the old man, who is dragging his way to\r\nthe tomb, are two children just entering into life—Valentine, the\r\ndaughter by my first wife—Mademoiselle Renée de Saint-Méran—and Edward,\r\nthe boy whose life you have this day saved.”\r\n\r\n“And what is your deduction from this compensation, sir?” inquired\r\nMonte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“My deduction is,” replied Villefort, “that my father, led away by his\r\npassions, has committed some fault unknown to human justice, but marked\r\nby the justice of God. That God, desirous in his mercy to punish but\r\none person, has visited this justice on him alone.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo with a smile on his lips, uttered in the depths of his\r\nsoul a groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard it.\r\n\r\n“Adieu, sir,” said the magistrate, who had risen from his seat; “I\r\nleave you, bearing a remembrance of you—a remembrance of esteem, which\r\nI hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better; for I\r\nam not a man to bore my friends, as you will learn. Besides, you have\r\nmade an eternal friend of Madame de Villefort.”\r\n\r\nThe count bowed, and contented himself with seeing Villefort to the\r\ndoor of his cabinet, the procureur being escorted to his carriage by\r\ntwo footmen, who, on a signal from their master, followed him with\r\nevery mark of attention. When he had gone, Monte Cristo breathed a\r\nprofound sigh, and said:\r\n\r\n“Enough of this poison, let me now seek the antidote.”\r\n\r\nThen sounding his bell, he said to Ali, who entered:\r\n\r\n“I am going to madame’s chamber—have the carriage ready at one\r\no’clock.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 49. Haydée\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that the new, or rather old, acquaintances of\r\nthe Count of Monte Cristo, residing in the Rue Meslay, were no other\r\nthan Maximilian, Julie, and Emmanuel.\r\n\r\nThe very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming\r\nvisits—the bright, pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over\r\nthe almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged,\r\nillumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and\r\ncalmness, as, immediately after Villefort’s departure, his thoughts\r\nflew back to the cheering prospect before him, of tasting, at least, a\r\nbrief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind. Even\r\nAli, who had hastened to obey the Count’s summons, went forth from his\r\nmaster’s presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and\r\npleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold; while, as\r\nthough dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his\r\npatron’s meditations, whatever they were, the faithful Nubian walked on\r\ntiptoe towards the door, holding his breath, lest its faintest sound\r\nshould dissipate his master’s happy reverie.\r\n\r\nIt was noon, and Monte Cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in\r\nthe apartments of Haydée, as though his oppressed spirit could not all\r\nat once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy, but required a\r\ngradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to\r\nreceive full and perfect happiness, in the same manner as ordinary\r\nnatures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or\r\nviolent sensations.\r\n\r\nThe young Greek, as we have already said, occupied apartments wholly\r\nunconnected with those of the count. The rooms had been fitted up in\r\nstrict accordance with Oriental ideas; the floors were covered with the\r\nrichest carpets Turkey could produce; the walls hung with brocaded silk\r\nof the most magnificent designs and texture; while around each chamber\r\nluxurious divans were placed, with piles of soft and yielding cushions,\r\nthat needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such\r\nas sought repose.\r\n\r\nHaydée had three French maids, and one who was a Greek. The first three\r\nremained constantly in a small waiting-room, ready to obey the summons\r\nof a small golden bell, or to receive the orders of the Romaic slave,\r\nwho knew just enough French to be able to transmit her mistress’s\r\nwishes to the three other waiting-women; the latter had received most\r\nperemptory instructions from Monte Cristo to treat Haydée with all the\r\ndeference they would observe to a queen.\r\n\r\nThe young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the\r\nfarther end of her apartments. This was a sort of boudoir, circular,\r\nand lighted only from the roof, which consisted of rose-colored glass.\r\nHaydée was reclining upon soft downy cushions, covered with blue satin\r\nspotted with silver; her head, supported by one of her exquisitely\r\nmoulded arms, rested on the divan immediately behind her, while the\r\nother was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich\r\nnarghile, through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by\r\nits passage through perfumed water. Her attitude, though perfectly\r\nnatural for an Eastern woman would, in a European, have been deemed too\r\nfull of coquettish straining after effect.\r\n\r\nHer dress, which was that of the women of Epirus, consisted of a pair\r\nof white satin trousers, embroidered with pink roses, displaying feet\r\nso exquisitely formed and so delicately fair, that they might well have\r\nbeen taken for Parian marble, had not the eye been undeceived by their\r\nmovements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little\r\nslippers with upturned toes, beautifully ornamented with gold and\r\npearls. She wore a blue and white-striped vest, with long open sleeves,\r\ntrimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls, and a sort of bodice,\r\nwhich, closing only from the centre to the waist, exhibited the whole\r\nof the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom; it was fastened with\r\nthree magnificent diamond clasps. The junction of the bodice and\r\ndrawers was entirely concealed by one of the many-colored scarves,\r\nwhose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so\r\nprecious in the eyes of Parisian belles.\r\n\r\nTilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold-colored\r\nsilk, embroidered with pearls; while on the other a purple rose mingled\r\nits glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair, of which the\r\nblackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue.\r\n\r\nThe extreme beauty of the countenance, that shone forth in loveliness\r\nthat mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it, was peculiarly\r\nand purely Grecian; there were the large, dark, melting eyes, the\r\nfinely formed nose, the coral lips, and pearly teeth, that belonged to\r\nher race and country.\r\n\r\nAnd, to complete the whole, Haydée was in the very springtide and\r\nfulness of youthful charms—she had not yet numbered more than nineteen\r\nor twenty summers.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo summoned the Greek attendant, and bade her inquire whether\r\nit would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit. Haydée’s\r\nonly reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the\r\ntapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir, the\r\nframework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the\r\ngraceful tableau presented by the young girl’s picturesque attitude and\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nAs Monte Cristo approached, she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that\r\nheld the narghile, and extending to him her other hand, said, with a\r\nsmile of captivating sweetness, in the sonorous language spoken by the\r\nwomen of Athens and Sparta:\r\n\r\n“Why demand permission ere you enter? Are you no longer my master, or\r\nhave I ceased to be your slave?”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo returned her smile.\r\n\r\n“Haydée,” said he, “you well know.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you address me so coldly—so distantly?” asked the young Greek.\r\n“Have I by any means displeased you? Oh, if so, punish me as you will;\r\nbut do not—do not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and\r\nconstrained.”\r\n\r\n“Haydée,” replied the count, “you know that you are now in France, and\r\nare free.”\r\n\r\n“Free to do what?” asked the young girl.\r\n\r\n“Free to leave me.”\r\n\r\n“Leave you? Why should I leave you?”\r\n\r\n“That is not for me to say; but we are now about to mix in society—to\r\nvisit and be visited.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t wish to see anybody but you.”\r\n\r\n“And should you see one whom you could prefer, I would not be so\r\nunjust——”\r\n\r\n“I have never seen anyone I preferred to you, and I have never loved\r\nanyone but you and my father.”\r\n\r\n“My poor child,” replied Monte Cristo, “that is merely because your\r\nfather and myself are the only men who have ever talked to you.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want anybody else to talk to me. My father said I was his\r\n‘joy’—you style me your ‘love,’—and both of you have called me ‘my\r\nchild.’”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember your father, Haydée?”\r\n\r\nThe young Greek smiled.\r\n\r\n“He is here, and here,” said she, touching her eyes and her heart.\r\n\r\n“And where am I?” inquired Monte Cristo laughingly.\r\n\r\n“You?” cried she, with tones of thrilling tenderness, “you are\r\neverywhere!” Monte Cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in\r\nhis, and was about to raise it to his lips, when the simple child of\r\nnature hastily withdrew it, and presented her cheek.\r\n\r\n“You now understand, Haydée,” said the count, “that from this moment\r\nyou are absolutely free; that here you exercise unlimited sway, and are\r\nat liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country, as it\r\nmay suit your inclination. Within this mansion you are absolute\r\nmistress of your actions, and may go abroad or remain in your\r\napartments as may seem most agreeable to you. A carriage waits your\r\norders, and Ali and Myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire\r\nto go. There is but one favor I would entreat of you.”\r\n\r\n“Speak.”\r\n\r\n“Guard carefully the secret of your birth. Make no allusion to the\r\npast; nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your\r\nillustrious father or ill-fated mother.”\r\n\r\n“I have already told you, my lord, that I shall see no one.”\r\n\r\n“It is possible, Haydée, that so perfect a seclusion, though\r\nconformable with the habits and customs of the East, may not be\r\npracticable in Paris. Endeavor, then, to accustom yourself to our\r\nmanner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of Rome,\r\nFlorence, Milan, and Madrid; it may be useful to you one of these days,\r\nwhether you remain here or return to the East.”\r\n\r\nThe young girl raised her tearful eyes towards Monte Cristo as she said\r\nwith touching earnestness, “Whether _we_ return to the East, you mean\r\nto say, my lord, do you not?”\r\n\r\n“My child,” returned Monte Cristo “you know full well that whenever we\r\npart, it will be no fault or wish of mine; the tree forsakes not the\r\nflower—the flower falls from the tree.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” replied Haydée, “I never will leave you, for I am sure I\r\ncould not exist without you.”\r\n\r\n“My poor girl, in ten years I shall be old, and you will be still\r\nyoung.”\r\n\r\n“My father had a long white beard, but I loved him; he was sixty years\r\nold, but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths I saw.”\r\n\r\n“Then tell me, Haydée, do you believe you shall be able to accustom\r\nyourself to our present mode of life?”\r\n\r\n“Shall I see you?”\r\n\r\n“Every day.”\r\n\r\n“Then what do you fear, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“You might find it dull.”\r\n\r\n“No, my lord. In the morning, I shall rejoice in the prospect of your\r\ncoming, and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness I have\r\nenjoyed in your presence; then too, when alone, I can call forth mighty\r\npictures of the past, see vast horizons bounded only by the towering\r\nmountains of Pindus and Olympus. Oh, believe me, that when three great\r\npassions, such as sorrow, love, and gratitude fill the heart, _ennui_\r\ncan find no place.”\r\n\r\n“You are a worthy daughter of Epirus, Haydée, and your charming and\r\npoetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who\r\nclaim your country as their birthplace. Depend on my care to see that\r\nyour youth is not blighted, or suffered to pass away in ungenial\r\nsolitude; and of this be well assured, that if you love me as a father,\r\nI love you as a child.”\r\n\r\n“You are wrong, my lord. The love I have for you is very different from\r\nthe love I had for my father. My father died, but I did not die. If you\r\nwere to die, I should die too.”\r\n\r\nThe count, with a smile of profound tenderness, extended his hand, and\r\nshe carried it to her lips.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo, thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with\r\nMorrel and his family, departed, murmuring as he went these lines of\r\nPindar, “Youth is a flower of which love is the fruit; happy is he who,\r\nafter having watched its silent growth, is permitted to gather and call\r\nit his own.” The carriage was prepared according to orders, and\r\nstepping lightly into it, the count drove off at his usual rapid pace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 50. The Morrel Family\r\n\r\nIn a very few minutes the count reached No. 7 in the Rue Meslay. The\r\nhouse was of white stone, and in a small court before it were two small\r\nbeds full of beautiful flowers. In the concierge that opened the gate\r\nthe count recognized Cocles; but as he had but one eye, and that eye\r\nhad become somewhat dim in the course of nine years, Cocles did not\r\nrecognize the count.\r\n\r\nThe carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn, to\r\navoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork,—an ornament that\r\nhad excited the jealousy of the whole quarter, and had gained for the\r\nplace the appellation of _The Little Versailles_. It is needless to add\r\nthat there were gold and silver fish in the basin. The house, with\r\nkitchens and cellars below, had above the ground floor, two stories and\r\nattics. The whole of the property, consisting of an immense workshop,\r\ntwo pavilions at the bottom of the garden, and the garden itself, had\r\nbeen purchased by Emmanuel, who had seen at a glance that he could make\r\nof it a profitable speculation. He had reserved the house and half the\r\ngarden, and building a wall between the garden and the workshops, had\r\nlet them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden. So\r\nthat for a trifling sum he was as well lodged, and as perfectly shut\r\nout from observation, as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the\r\nFaubourg St. Germain.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast-room was finished in oak; the salon in mahogany, and the\r\nfurnishings were of blue velvet; the bedroom was in citronwood and\r\ngreen damask. There was a study for Emmanuel, who never studied, and a\r\nmusic-room for Julie, who never played. The whole of the second story\r\nwas set apart for Maximilian; it was precisely similar to his sister’s\r\napartments, except that for the breakfast-parlor he had a\r\nbilliard-room, where he received his friends. He was superintending the\r\ngrooming of his horse, and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the\r\ngarden, when the count’s carriage stopped at the gate.\r\n\r\nCocles opened the gate, and Baptistin, springing from the box, inquired\r\nwhether Monsieur and Madame Herbault and Monsieur Maximilian Morrel\r\nwould see his excellency the Count of Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“The Count of Monte Cristo?” cried Morrel, throwing away his cigar and\r\nhastening to the carriage; “I should think we would see him. Ah, a\r\nthousand thanks, count, for not having forgotten your promise.”\r\n\r\nAnd the young officer shook the count’s hand so warmly, that Monte\r\nCristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy, and he saw\r\nthat he had been expected with impatience, and was received with\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said Maximilian, “I will serve as your guide; such a man\r\nas you are ought not to be introduced by a servant. My sister is in the\r\ngarden plucking the dead roses; my brother is reading his two papers,\r\n_la Presse_ and _les Débats_, within six steps of her; for wherever you\r\nsee Madame Herbault, you have only to look within a circle of four\r\nyards and you will find M. Emmanuel, and ‘reciprocally,’ as they say at\r\nthe Polytechnic School.”\r\n\r\nAt the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to five-and-twenty,\r\ndressed in a silk morning gown, and busily engaged in plucking the dead\r\nleaves off a noisette rose-tree, raised her head. This was Julie, who\r\nhad become, as the clerk of the house of Thomson & French had\r\npredicted, Madame Emmanuel Herbault. She uttered a cry of surprise at\r\nthe sight of a stranger, and Maximilian began to laugh.\r\n\r\n“Don’t disturb yourself, Julie,” said he. “The count has only been two\r\nor three days in Paris, but he already knows what a fashionable woman\r\nof the Marais is, and if he does not, you will show him.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, monsieur,” returned Julie, “it is treason in my brother to bring\r\nyou thus, but he never has any regard for his poor sister. Penelon,\r\nPenelon!”\r\n\r\nAn old man, who was digging busily at one of the beds, stuck his spade\r\nin the earth, and approached, cap in hand, striving to conceal a quid\r\nof tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek. A few locks of gray\r\nmingled with his hair, which was still thick and matted, while his\r\nbronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who\r\nhad braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics.\r\n\r\n“I think you hailed me, Mademoiselle Julie?” said he.\r\n\r\nPenelon had still preserved the habit of calling his master’s daughter\r\n“Mademoiselle Julie,” and had never been able to change the name to\r\nMadame Herbault.\r\n\r\n“Penelon,” replied Julie, “go and inform M. Emmanuel of this\r\ngentleman’s visit, and Maximilian will conduct him to the salon.”\r\n\r\nThen, turning to Monte Cristo,—“I hope you will permit me to leave you\r\nfor a few minutes,” continued she; and without awaiting any reply,\r\ndisappeared behind a clump of trees, and escaped to the house by a\r\nlateral alley.\r\n\r\n30041m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to see,” observed Monte Cristo to Morrel, “that I cause no\r\nsmall disturbance in your house.”\r\n\r\n“Look there,” said Maximilian, laughing; “there is her husband changing\r\nhis jacket for a coat. I assure you, you are well known in the Rue\r\nMeslay.”\r\n\r\n“Your family appears to be a very happy one,” said the count, as if\r\nspeaking to himself.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I assure you, count, they want nothing that can render them\r\nhappy; they are young and cheerful, they are tenderly attached to each\r\nother, and with twenty-five thousand francs a year they fancy\r\nthemselves as rich as Rothschild.”\r\n\r\n“Five-and-twenty thousand francs is not a large sum, however,” replied\r\nMonte Cristo, with a tone so sweet and gentle, that it went to\r\nMaximilian’s heart like the voice of a father; “but they will not be\r\ncontent with that. Your brother-in-law is a barrister? a doctor?”\r\n\r\n“He was a merchant, monsieur, and had succeeded to the business of my\r\npoor father. M. Morrel, at his death, left 500,000 francs, which were\r\ndivided between my sister and myself, for we were his only children.\r\nHer husband, who, when he married her, had no other patrimony than his\r\nnoble probity, his first-rate ability, and his spotless reputation,\r\nwished to possess as much as his wife. He labored and toiled until he\r\nhad amassed 250,000 francs; six years sufficed to achieve this object.\r\nOh, I assure you, sir, it was a touching spectacle to see these young\r\ncreatures, destined by their talents for higher stations, toiling\r\ntogether, and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs\r\nof their paternal house, taking six years to accomplish what less\r\nscrupulous people would have effected in two or three. Marseilles\r\nresounded with their well-earned praises. At last, one day, Emmanuel\r\ncame to his wife, who had just finished making up the accounts.\r\n\r\n“‘Julie,’ said he to her, ‘Cocles has just given me the last rouleau of\r\na hundred francs; that completes the 250,000 francs we had fixed as the\r\nlimits of our gains. Can you content yourself with the small fortune\r\nwhich we shall possess for the future? Listen to me. Our house\r\ntransacts business to the amount of a million a year, from which we\r\nderive an income of 40,000 francs. We can dispose of the business, if\r\nwe please, in an hour, for I have received a letter from M. Delaunay,\r\nin which he offers to purchase the good-will of the house, to unite\r\nwith his own, for 300,000 francs. Advise me what I had better do.’\r\n\r\n“‘Emmanuel,’ returned my sister, ‘the house of Morrel can only be\r\ncarried on by a Morrel. Is it not worth 300,000 francs to save our\r\nfather’s name from the chances of evil fortune and failure?’\r\n\r\n“‘I thought so,’ replied Emmanuel; ‘but I wished to have your advice.’\r\n\r\n“‘This is my counsel:—Our accounts are made up and our bills paid; all\r\nwe have to do is to stop the issue of any more, and close our office.’\r\n\r\n“This was done instantly. It was three o’clock; at a quarter past, a\r\nmerchant presented himself to insure two ships; it was a clear profit\r\nof 15,000 francs.\r\n\r\n“‘Monsieur,’ said Emmanuel, ‘have the goodness to address yourself to\r\nM. Delaunay. We have quitted business.’\r\n\r\n“‘How long?’ inquired the astonished merchant.\r\n\r\n30043m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘A quarter of an hour,’ was the reply.\r\n\r\n“And this is the reason, monsieur,” continued Maximilian, “of my sister\r\nand brother-in-law having only 25,000 francs a year.”\r\n\r\nMaximilian had scarcely finished his story, during which the count’s\r\nheart had swelled within him, when Emmanuel entered wearing a hat and\r\ncoat. He saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the\r\nrank of his guest; then, after having led Monte Cristo around the\r\nlittle garden, he returned to the house.\r\n\r\nA large vase of Japan porcelain, filled with flowers that loaded the\r\nair with their perfume, stood in the salon. Julie, suitably dressed,\r\nand her hair arranged (she had accomplished this feat in less than ten\r\nminutes), received the count on his entrance. The songs of the birds\r\nwere heard in an aviary hard by, and the branches of laburnums and rose\r\nacacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains.\r\nEverything in this charming retreat, from the warble of the birds to\r\nthe smile of the mistress, breathed tranquillity and repose.\r\n\r\nThe count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he\r\nentered the house, and he remained silent and pensive, forgetting that\r\nhe was expected to renew the conversation, which had ceased after the\r\nfirst salutations had been exchanged. The silence became almost painful\r\nwhen, by a violent effort, tearing himself from his pleasing reverie:\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said he at length, “I pray you to excuse my emotion, which\r\nmust astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness I meet here;\r\nbut contentment is so new a sight to me, that I could never be weary of\r\nlooking at yourself and your husband.”\r\n\r\n“We are very happy, monsieur,” replied Julie; “but we have also known\r\nunhappiness, and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\nThe count’s features displayed an expression of the most intense\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n“Oh, all this is a family history, as Château-Renaud told you the other\r\nday,” observed Maximilian. “This humble picture would have but little\r\ninterest for you, accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the\r\nmisfortunes of the wealthy and industrious; but such as we are, we have\r\nexperienced bitter sorrows.”\r\n\r\n“And God has poured balm into your wounds, as he does into those of all\r\nwho are in affliction?” said Monte Cristo inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, count,” returned Julie, “we may indeed say he has, for he has\r\ndone for us what he grants only to his chosen; he sent us one of his\r\nangels.”\r\n\r\nThe count’s cheeks became scarlet, and he coughed, in order to have an\r\nexcuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Those born to wealth, and who have the means of gratifying every\r\nwish,” said Emmanuel, “know not what is the real happiness of life,\r\njust as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on\r\na few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo rose, and without making any answer (for the tremulousness\r\nof his voice would have betrayed his emotion) walked up and down the\r\napartment with a slow step.\r\n\r\n“Our magnificence makes you smile, count,” said Maximilian, who had\r\nfollowed him with his eyes.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” returned Monte Cristo, pale as death, pressing one hand on\r\nhis heart to still its throbbings, while with the other he pointed to a\r\ncrystal cover, beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet\r\ncushion. “I was wondering what could be the significance of this purse,\r\nwith the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other.”\r\n\r\n“Count,” replied Maximilian, with an air of gravity, “those are our\r\nmost precious family treasures.”\r\n\r\n“The stone seems very brilliant,” answered the count.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my brother does not allude to its value, although it has been\r\nestimated at 100,000 francs; he means, that the articles contained in\r\nthis purse are the relics of the angel I spoke of just now.”\r\n\r\n“This I do not comprehend; and yet I may not ask for an explanation,\r\nmadame,” replied Monte Cristo bowing. “Pardon me, I had no intention of\r\ncommitting an indiscretion.”\r\n\r\n“Indiscretion,—oh, you make us happy by giving us an excuse for\r\nexpatiating on this subject. If we wanted to conceal the noble action\r\nthis purse commemorates, we should not expose it thus to view. Oh,\r\nwould we could relate it everywhere, and to everyone, so that the\r\nemotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, really,” said Monte Cristo in a half-stifled voice.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” returned Maximilian, raising the glass cover, and\r\nrespectfully kissing the silken purse, “this has touched the hand of a\r\nman who saved my father from suicide, us from ruin, and our name from\r\nshame and disgrace,—a man by whose matchless benevolence we poor\r\nchildren, doomed to want and wretchedness, can at present hear everyone\r\nenvying our happy lot. This letter” (as he spoke, Maximilian drew a\r\nletter from the purse and gave it to the count)—“this letter was\r\nwritten by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution,\r\nand this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her\r\ndowry.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo opened the letter, and read it with an indescribable\r\nfeeling of delight. It was the letter written (as our readers know) to\r\nJulie, and signed “Sinbad the Sailor.”\r\n\r\n“Unknown you say, is the man who rendered you this service—unknown to\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand,” continued\r\nMaximilian. “We have supplicated Heaven in vain to grant us this favor,\r\nbut the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we cannot\r\ncomprehend—we have been guided by an invisible hand,—a hand as powerful\r\nas that of an enchanter.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried Julie, “I have not lost all hope of some day kissing that\r\nhand, as I now kiss the purse which he has touched. Four years ago,\r\nPenelon was at Trieste—Penelon, count, is the old sailor you saw in the\r\ngarden, and who, from quartermaster, has become gardener—Penelon, when\r\nhe was at Trieste, saw on the quay an Englishman, who was on the point\r\nof embarking on board a yacht, and he recognized him as the person who\r\ncalled on my father the fifth of June, 1829, and who wrote me this\r\nletter on the fifth of September. He felt convinced of his identity,\r\nbut he did not venture to address him.”\r\n\r\n“An Englishman,” said Monte Cristo, who grew uneasy at the attention\r\nwith which Julie looked at him. “An Englishman you say?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Maximilian, “an Englishman, who represented himself as\r\nthe confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French, at Rome. It\r\nwas this that made me start when you said the other day, at M. de\r\nMorcerf’s, that Messrs. Thomson & French were your bankers. That\r\nhappened, as I told you, in 1829. For God’s sake, tell me, did you know\r\nthis Englishman?”\r\n\r\n“But you tell me, also, that the house of Thomson & French have\r\nconstantly denied having rendered you this service?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be someone who,\r\ngrateful for a kindness your father had shown him, and which he himself\r\nhad forgotten, has taken this method of requiting the obligation?”\r\n\r\n“Everything is possible in this affair, even a miracle.”\r\n\r\n“What was his name?” asked Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“He gave no other name,” answered Julie, looking earnestly at the\r\ncount, “than that at the end of his letter—‘Sinbad the Sailor.’”\r\n\r\n“Which is evidently not his real name, but a fictitious one.”\r\n\r\nThen, noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice:\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” continued he, “was he not about my height, perhaps a little\r\ntaller, with his chin imprisoned, as it were, in a high cravat; his\r\ncoat closely buttoned up, and constantly taking out his pencil?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, do you then know him?” cried Julie, whose eyes sparkled with joy.\r\n\r\n“No,” returned Monte Cristo “I only guessed. I knew a Lord Wilmore, who\r\nwas constantly doing actions of this kind.”\r\n\r\n“Without revealing himself?”\r\n\r\n“He was an eccentric being, and did not believe in the existence of\r\ngratitude.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Heaven,” exclaimed Julie, clasping her hands, “in what did he\r\nbelieve, then?”\r\n\r\n30047m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“He did not credit it at the period which I knew him,” said Monte\r\nCristo, touched to the heart by the accents of Julie’s voice; “but,\r\nperhaps, since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist.”\r\n\r\n“And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?” inquired Emmanuel.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you do know him,” cried Julie, “can you tell us where he\r\nis—where we can find him? Maximilian—Emmanuel—if we do but discover\r\nhim, he must believe in the gratitude of the heart!”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo felt tears start into his eyes, and he again walked\r\nhastily up and down the room.\r\n\r\n“In the name of Heaven,” said Maximilian, “if you know anything of him,\r\ntell us what it is.”\r\n\r\n“Alas,” cried Monte Cristo, striving to repress his emotion, “if Lord\r\nWilmore was your unknown benefactor, I fear you will never see him\r\nagain. I parted from him two years ago at Palermo, and he was then on\r\nthe point of setting out for the most remote regions; so that I fear he\r\nwill never return.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, monsieur, this is cruel of you,” said Julie, much affected; and\r\nthe young lady’s eyes swam with tears.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” replied Monte Cristo gravely, and gazing earnestly on the two\r\nliquid pearls that trickled down Julie’s cheeks, “had Lord Wilmore seen\r\nwhat I now see, he would become attached to life, for the tears you\r\nshed would reconcile him to mankind;” and he held out his hand to\r\nJulie, who gave him hers, carried away by the look and accent of the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n“But,” continued she, “Lord Wilmore had a family or friends, he must\r\nhave known someone, can we not——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is useless to inquire,” returned the count; “perhaps, after\r\nall, he was not the man you seek for. He was my friend: he had no\r\nsecrets from me, and if this had been so he would have confided in me.”\r\n\r\n“And he told you nothing?”\r\n\r\n“Not a word.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing that would lead you to suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“And yet you spoke of him at once.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, in such a case one supposes——”\r\n\r\n“Sister, sister,” said Maximilian, coming to the count’s aid, “monsieur\r\nis quite right. Recollect what our excellent father so often told us,\r\n‘It was no Englishman that thus saved us.’”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo started. “What did your father tell you, M. Morrel?” said\r\nhe eagerly.\r\n\r\n“My father thought that this action had been miraculously performed—he\r\nbelieved that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us. Oh, it\r\nwas a touching superstition, monsieur, and although I did not myself\r\nbelieve it, I would not for the world have destroyed my father’s faith.\r\nHow often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend—a\r\nfriend lost to him forever; and on his death-bed, when the near\r\napproach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with\r\nsupernatural light, this thought, which had until then been but a\r\ndoubt, became a conviction, and his last words were, ‘Maximilian, it\r\nwas Edmond Dantès!’”\r\n\r\nAt these words the count’s paleness, which had for some time been\r\nincreasing, became alarming; he could not speak; he looked at his watch\r\nlike a man who has forgotten the hour, said a few hurried words to\r\nMadame Herbault, and pressing the hands of Emmanuel and\r\nMaximilian,—“Madame,” said he, “I trust you will allow me to visit you\r\noccasionally; I value your friendship, and feel grateful to you for\r\nyour welcome, for this is the first time for many years that I have\r\nthus yielded to my feelings;” and he hastily quitted the apartment.\r\n\r\n“This Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man,” said Emmanuel.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Maximilian, “but I feel sure he has an excellent heart,\r\nand that he likes us.”\r\n\r\n“His voice went to my heart,” observed Julie; “and two or three times I\r\nfancied that I had heard it before.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe\r\n\r\nAbout two-thirds of the way along the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and in the\r\nrear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood,\r\nwhere the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and\r\nmagnificence of construction, extended a large garden, where the\r\nwide-spreading chestnut-trees raised their heads high above the walls\r\nin a solid rampart, and with the coming of every spring scattered a\r\nshower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases\r\nthat stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron\r\ngate, that dated from the time of Louis XIII.\r\n\r\nThis noble entrance, however, in spite of its striking appearance and\r\nthe graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases, as they\r\nwaved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with\r\ntheir scarlet bloom, had fallen into utter disuse. The proprietors of\r\nthe mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves\r\nto the possession of the house itself, with its thickly planted\r\ncourtyard, opening into the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and to the garden\r\nshut in by this gate, which formerly communicated with a fine\r\nkitchen-garden of about an acre. For the demon of speculation drew a\r\nline, or in other words projected a street, at the farther side of the\r\nkitchen-garden. The street was laid out, a name was chosen and posted\r\nup on an iron plate, but before construction was begun, it occurred to\r\nthe possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for\r\nthe ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables, by building along the\r\nline of the proposed street, and so making it a branch of communication\r\nwith the Faubourg Saint-Honoré itself, one of the most important\r\nthoroughfares in the city of Paris.\r\n\r\nIn matters of speculation, however, though “man proposes,” yet “money\r\ndisposes.” From some such difficulty the newly named street died almost\r\nin birth, and the purchaser of the kitchen-garden, having paid a high\r\nprice for it, and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his\r\nbargain off his hands without a considerable loss, yet still clinging\r\nto the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it\r\nthat would repay him, not only for his past outlay, but also the\r\ninterest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition, contented\r\nhimself with letting the ground temporarily to some market-gardeners,\r\nat a yearly rental of 500 francs.\r\n\r\nAnd so, as we have said, the iron gate leading into the kitchen-garden\r\nhad been closed up and left to the rust, which bade fair before long to\r\neat off its hinges, while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers\r\nand delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic\r\nenclosure belonging to the mansion, the gate had been boarded up to a\r\nheight of six feet. True, the planks were not so closely adjusted but\r\nthat a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices; but the\r\nstrict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left\r\nno grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nHorticulture seemed, however, to have been abandoned in the deserted\r\nkitchen-garden; and where cabbages, carrots, radishes, peas, and melons\r\nhad once flourished, a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its\r\nbeing deemed worthy of cultivation. A small, low door gave egress from\r\nthe walled space we have been describing into the projected street, the\r\nground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters,\r\nand had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not\r\neven the one-half per cent it had originally paid. Towards the house\r\nthe chestnut-trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall,\r\nwithout in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and\r\nflowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces, as\r\nthough asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air. At one\r\ncorner, where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day, a\r\nlarge stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered\r\nspot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant\r\nof the house, which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of\r\nverdure that partially concealed it, though situated but a hundred\r\npaces off.\r\n\r\nWhoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the\r\nboundary of a walk, or as a place for meditation, was abundantly\r\njustified in the choice by the absence of all glare, the cool,\r\nrefreshing shade, the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the\r\nsun, that found no entrance there even during the burning days of\r\nhottest summer, the incessant and melodious warbling of birds, and the\r\nentire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the\r\nmansion. On the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet\r\nbestowed on the inhabitants of Paris, might be seen negligently thrown\r\nupon the stone bench, a book, a parasol, and a work-basket, from which\r\nhung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief, while at a little\r\ndistance from these articles was a young woman, standing close to the\r\niron gate, endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means\r\nof the openings in the planks,—the earnestness of her attitude and the\r\nfixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes,\r\nproving how much her feelings were interested in the matter.\r\n\r\nAt that instant the little side-gate leading from the waste ground to\r\nthe street was noiselessly opened, and a tall, powerful young man\r\nappeared. He was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap, but\r\nhis carefully arranged hair, beard and moustache, all of the richest\r\nand glossiest black, ill accorded with his plebeian attire. After\r\ncasting a rapid glance around him, in order to assure himself that he\r\nwas unobserved, he entered by the small gate, and, carefully closing\r\nand securing it after him, proceeded with a hurried step towards the\r\nbarrier.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of him she expected, though probably not in such a\r\ncostume, the young woman started in terror, and was about to make a\r\nhasty retreat. But the eye of love had already seen, even through the\r\nnarrow chinks of the wooden palisades, the movement of the white robe,\r\nand observed the fluttering of the blue sash. Pressing his lips close\r\nto the planks, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Don’t be alarmed, Valentine—it is I!”\r\n\r\nAgain the timid girl found courage to return to the gate, saying, as\r\nshe did so:\r\n\r\n“And why do you come so late today? It is almost dinner-time, and I had\r\nto use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful stepmother, my\r\ntoo-devoted maid, and my troublesome brother, who is always teasing me\r\nabout coming to work at my embroidery, which I am in a fair way never\r\nto get done. So pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made\r\nme wait, and, after that, tell me why I see you in a dress so singular\r\nthat at first I did not recognize you.”\r\n\r\n“Dearest Valentine,” said the young man, “the difference between our\r\nrespective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love,\r\nbut yet I cannot find myself in your presence without longing to pour\r\nforth my soul, and tell you how fondly I adore you. If it be but to\r\ncarry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments, I could even\r\nthank you for chiding me, for it leaves me a gleam of hope, that if you\r\ndid not expect me (and that indeed would be worse than vanity to\r\nsuppose), at least I was in your thoughts. You asked me the cause of my\r\nbeing late, and why I come disguised. I will candidly explain the\r\nreason of both, and I trust to your goodness to pardon me. I have\r\nchosen a trade.”\r\n\r\n“A trade? Oh, Maximilian, how can you jest at a time when we have such\r\ndeep cause for uneasiness?”\r\n\r\n“Heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than\r\nlife itself! But listen to me, Valentine, and I will tell you all about\r\nit. I became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls, and seriously\r\nalarmed at the idea suggested by you, that if caught hovering about\r\nhere your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief.\r\nThat would compromise the honor of the French army, to say nothing of\r\nthe fact that the continual presence of a captain of Spahis in a place\r\nwhere no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might\r\nwell create surprise; so I have become a gardener, and, consequently,\r\nadopted the costume of my calling.”\r\n\r\n“What excessive nonsense you talk, Maximilian!”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense? Pray do not call what I consider the wisest action of my\r\nlife by such a name. Consider, by becoming a gardener I effectually\r\nscreen our meetings from all suspicion or danger.”\r\n\r\n30053m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I beseech of you, Maximilian, to cease trifling, and tell me what you\r\nreally mean.”\r\n\r\n“Simply, that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which I\r\nstand was to let, I made application for it, was readily accepted by\r\nthe proprietor, and am now master of this fine crop of lucern. Think of\r\nthat, Valentine! There is nothing now to prevent my building myself a\r\nlittle hut on my plantation, and residing not twenty yards from you.\r\nOnly imagine what happiness that would afford me. I can scarcely\r\ncontain myself at the bare idea. Such felicity seems above all price—as\r\na thing impossible and unattainable. But would you believe that I\r\npurchase all this delight, joy, and happiness, for which I would\r\ncheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life, at the small cost of\r\n500 francs per annum, paid quarterly? Henceforth we have nothing to\r\nfear. I am on my own ground, and have an undoubted right to place a\r\nladder against the wall, and to look over when I please, without having\r\nany apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious\r\ncharacter. I may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of\r\nmy fond, faithful, and unalterable affection, whenever you visit your\r\nfavorite bower, unless, indeed, it offends your pride to listen to\r\nprofessions of love from the lips of a poor workingman, clad in a\r\nblouse and cap.”\r\n\r\nA faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of\r\nValentine, who almost instantly said, in a saddened tone, as though\r\nsome envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart:\r\n\r\n“Alas, no, Maximilian, this must not be, for many reasons. We should\r\npresume too much on our own strength, and, like others, perhaps, be led\r\nastray by our blind confidence in each other’s prudence.”\r\n\r\n“How can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought, dear\r\nValentine? Have I not, from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance,\r\nschooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas? And you\r\nhave, I am sure, the fullest confidence in my honor. When you spoke to\r\nme of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger, I\r\nplaced myself blindly and devotedly at your service, asking no other\r\nreward than the pleasure of being useful to you; and have I ever since,\r\nby word or look, given you cause of regret for having selected me from\r\nthe numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you?\r\nYou told me, my dear Valentine, that you were engaged to M. d’Épinay,\r\nand that your father was resolved upon completing the match, and that\r\nfrom his will there was no appeal, as M. de Villefort was never known\r\nto change a determination once formed. I kept in the background, as you\r\nwished, and waited, not for the decision of your heart or my own, but\r\nhoping that Providence would graciously interpose in our behalf, and\r\norder events in our favor. But what cared I for delays or difficulties,\r\nValentine, as long as you confessed that you loved me, and took pity on\r\nme? If you will only repeat that avowal now and then, I can endure\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Maximilian, that is the very thing that makes you so bold, and\r\nwhich renders me at once so happy and unhappy, that I frequently ask\r\nmyself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my\r\nstepmother, and her blind preference for her own child, or to be, as I\r\nnow am, insensible to any pleasure save such as I find in these\r\nmeetings, so fraught with danger to both.”\r\n\r\n“I will not admit that word,” returned the young man; “it is at once\r\ncruel and unjust. Is it possible to find a more submissive slave than\r\nmyself? You have permitted me to converse with you from time to time,\r\nValentine, but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or\r\nelsewhere—have I not obeyed? And since I found means to enter this\r\nenclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gate—to be\r\nclose to you without really seeing you—have I ever asked so much as to\r\ntouch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a\r\ntrifle to one of my youth and strength? Never has a complaint or a\r\nmurmur escaped me. I have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any\r\nknight of olden times. Come, come, dearest Valentine, confess that what\r\nI say is true, lest I be tempted to call you unjust.”\r\n\r\n30055m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is true,” said Valentine, as she passed the end of her slender\r\nfingers through a small opening in the planks, and permitted Maximilian\r\nto press his lips to them, “and you are a true and faithful friend; but\r\nstill you acted from motives of self-interest, my dear Maximilian, for\r\nyou well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an\r\nopposite spirit all would have been ended between us. You promised to\r\nbestow on me the friendly affection of a brother. For I have no friend\r\nbut yourself upon earth, who am neglected and forgotten by my father,\r\nharassed and persecuted by my stepmother, and left to the sole\r\ncompanionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man, whose withered\r\nhand can no longer press mine, and who can speak to me with the eye\r\nalone, although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness\r\nfor his poor grandchild. Oh, how bitter a fate is mine, to serve either\r\nas a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself, while my\r\nonly friend and supporter is a living corpse! Indeed, indeed,\r\nMaximilian, I am very miserable, and if you love me it must be out of\r\npity.”\r\n\r\n“Valentine,” replied the young man, deeply affected, “I will not say\r\nyou are all I love in the world, for I dearly prize my sister and\r\nbrother-in-law; but my affection for them is calm and tranquil, in no\r\nmanner resembling what I feel for you. When I think of you my heart\r\nbeats fast, the blood burns in my veins, and I can hardly breathe; but\r\nI solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor, this fervor and\r\nintensity of feeling, until you yourself shall require me to render\r\nthem available in serving or assisting you. M. Franz is not expected to\r\nreturn home for a year to come, I am told; in that time many favorable\r\nand unforeseen chances may befriend us. Let us, then, hope for the\r\nbest; hope is so sweet a comforter. Meanwhile, Valentine, while\r\nreproaching me with selfishness, think a little what you have been to\r\nme—the beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble Venus. What promise\r\nof future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience\r\nI have evinced?—none whatever. What granted me?—scarcely more. You tell\r\nme of M. Franz d’Épinay, your betrothed lover, and you shrink from the\r\nidea of being his wife; but tell me, Valentine, is there no other\r\nsorrow in your heart? You see me devoted to you, body and soul, my life\r\nand each warm drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your\r\nservice; you know full well that my existence is bound up in yours—that\r\nwere I to lose you I would not outlive the hour of such crushing\r\nmisery; yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the\r\nwife of another! Oh, Valentine, were I in your place, and did I feel\r\nconscious, as you do, of being worshipped, adored, with such a love as\r\nmine, a hundred times at least should I have passed my hand between\r\nthese iron bars, and said, ‘Take this hand, dearest Maximilian, and\r\nbelieve that, living or dead, I am yours—yours only, and forever!’”\r\n\r\nThe poor girl made no reply, but her lover could plainly hear her sobs\r\nand tears. A rapid change took place in the young man’s feelings.\r\n\r\n“Dearest, dearest Valentine,” exclaimed he, “forgive me if I have\r\noffended you, and forget the words I spoke if they have unwittingly\r\ncaused you pain.”\r\n\r\n“No, Maximilian, I am not offended,” answered she, “but do you not see\r\nwhat a poor, helpless being I am, almost a stranger and an outcast in\r\nmy father’s house, where even he is seldom seen; whose will has been\r\nthwarted, and spirits broken, from the age of ten years, beneath the\r\niron rod so sternly held over me; oppressed, mortified, and persecuted,\r\nday by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, no person has cared for,\r\neven observed my sufferings, nor have I ever breathed one word on the\r\nsubject save to yourself. Outwardly and in the eyes of the world, I am\r\nsurrounded by kindness and affection; but the reverse is the case. The\r\ngeneral remark is, ‘Oh, it cannot be expected that one of so stern a\r\ncharacter as M. Villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do\r\non their daughters. What though she has lost her own mother at a tender\r\nage, she has had the happiness to find a second mother in Madame de\r\nVillefort.’ The world, however, is mistaken; my father abandons me from\r\nutter indifference, while my stepmother detests me with a hatred so\r\nmuch the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile.”\r\n\r\n“Hate you, sweet Valentine,” exclaimed the young man; “how is it\r\npossible for anyone to do that?”\r\n\r\n“Alas,” replied the weeping girl, “I am obliged to own that my\r\nstepmother’s aversion to me arises from a very natural source—her\r\noverweening love for her own child, my brother Edward.”\r\n\r\n“But why should it?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know; but, though unwilling to introduce money matters into\r\nour present conversation, I will just say this much—that her extreme\r\ndislike to me has its origin there; and I much fear she envies me the\r\nfortune I enjoy in right of my mother, and which will be more than\r\ndoubled at the death of M. and Mme. de Saint-Méran, whose sole heiress\r\nI am. Madame de Villefort has nothing of her own, and hates me for\r\nbeing so richly endowed. Alas, how gladly would I exchange the half of\r\nthis wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father’s love. God\r\nknows, I would prefer sacrificing the whole, so that it would obtain me\r\na happy and affectionate home.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Valentine!”\r\n\r\n“I seem to myself as though living a life of bondage, yet at the same\r\ntime am so conscious of my own weakness that I fear to break the\r\nrestraint in which I am held, lest I fall utterly helpless. Then, too,\r\nmy father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity;\r\nprotected as he is by his high position and firmly established\r\nreputation for talent and unswerving integrity, no one could oppose\r\nhim; he is all-powerful even with the king; he would crush you at a\r\nword. Dear Maximilian, believe me when I assure you that if I do not\r\nattempt to resist my father’s commands it is more on your account than\r\nmy own.”\r\n\r\n“But why, Valentine, do you persist in anticipating the worst,—why\r\npicture so gloomy a future?”\r\n\r\n“Because I judge it from the past.”\r\n\r\n“Still, consider that although I may not be, strictly speaking, what is\r\ntermed an illustrious match for you, I am, for many reasons, not\r\naltogether so much beneath your alliance. The days when such\r\ndistinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in\r\nFrance, and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with\r\nthose of the empire. The aristocracy of the lance has allied itself\r\nwith the nobility of the cannon. Now I belong to this last-named class;\r\nand certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging\r\nas well as certain. My fortune, though small, is free and unfettered,\r\nand the memory of my late father is respected in our country,\r\nValentine, as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the\r\ncity; I say our country, because you were born not far from\r\nMarseilles.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t speak of Marseilles, I beg of you, Maximilian; that one word\r\nbrings back my mother to my recollection—my angel mother, who died too\r\nsoon for myself and all who knew her; but who, after watching over her\r\nchild during the brief period allotted to her in this world, now, I\r\nfondly hope, watches from her home in heaven. Oh, if my mother were\r\nstill living, there would be nothing to fear, Maximilian, for I would\r\ntell her that I loved you, and she would protect us.”\r\n\r\n“I fear, Valentine,” replied the lover, “that were she living I should\r\nnever have had the happiness of knowing you; you would then have been\r\ntoo happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Now it is you who are unjust, Maximilian,” cried Valentine; “but there\r\nis one thing I wish to know.”\r\n\r\n“And what is that?” inquired the young man, perceiving that Valentine\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n“Tell me truly, Maximilian, whether in former days, when our fathers\r\ndwelt at Marseilles, there was ever any misunderstanding between them?”\r\n\r\n“Not that I am aware of,” replied the young man, “unless, indeed, any\r\nill-feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties—your\r\nfather was, as you know, a zealous partisan of the Bourbons, while mine\r\nwas wholly devoted to the emperor; there could not possibly be any\r\nother difference between them. But why do you ask?”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you,” replied the young girl, “for it is but right you\r\nshould know. Well, on the day when your appointment as an officer of\r\nthe Legion of Honor was announced in the papers, we were all sitting\r\nwith my grandfather, M. Noirtier; M. Danglars was there also—you\r\nrecollect M. Danglars, do you not, Maximilian, the banker, whose horses\r\nran away with my stepmother and little brother, and very nearly killed\r\nthem? While the rest of the company were discussing the approaching\r\nmarriage of Mademoiselle Danglars, I was reading the paper to my\r\ngrandfather; but when I came to the paragraph about you, although I had\r\ndone nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning (you know\r\nyou had told me all about it the previous evening), I felt so happy,\r\nand yet so nervous, at the idea of speaking your name aloud, and before\r\nso many people, that I really think I should have passed it over, but\r\nfor the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause\r\nof my silence; so I summoned up all my courage, and read it as firmly\r\nand as steadily as I could.”\r\n\r\n30059m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Dear Valentine!”\r\n\r\n“Well, would you believe it? directly my father caught the sound of\r\nyour name he turned round quite hastily, and, like a poor silly thing,\r\nI was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by\r\nthe utterance of your name, that I was not surprised to see my father\r\nstart, and almost tremble; but I even thought (though that surely must\r\nhave been a mistake) that M. Danglars trembled too.”\r\n\r\n“‘Morrel, Morrel,’ cried my father, ‘stop a bit;’ then knitting his\r\nbrows into a deep frown, he added, ‘surely this cannot be one of the\r\nMorrel family who lived at Marseilles, and gave us so much trouble from\r\ntheir violent Bonapartism—I mean about the year 1815.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ replied M. Danglars, ‘I believe he is the son of the old\r\nshipowner.’”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” answered Maximilian; “and what did your father say then,\r\nValentine?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, such a dreadful thing, that I don’t dare to tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Always tell me everything,” said Maximilian with a smile.\r\n\r\n“‘Ah,’ continued my father, still frowning, ‘their idolized emperor\r\ntreated these madmen as they deserved; he called them ‘food for\r\ncannon,’ which was precisely all they were good for; and I am delighted\r\nto see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle\r\nwith all its pristine vigor; if Algiers were good for nothing but to\r\nfurnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice, it\r\nwould be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain. Though it\r\ncertainly does cost France somewhat dear to assert her rights in that\r\nuncivilized country.’”\r\n\r\n“Brutal politics, I must confess.” said Maximilian; “but don’t attach\r\nany serious importance, dear, to what your father said. My father was\r\nnot a bit behind yours in that sort of talk. ‘Why,’ said he, ‘does not\r\nthe emperor, who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of\r\nimproving the art of war, organize a regiment of lawyers, judges and\r\nlegal practitioners, sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could\r\nmaintain, and using them to save better men?’ You see, my dear, that\r\nfor picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much\r\nto choose between the language of either party. But what did M.\r\nDanglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he laughed, and in that singular manner so peculiar to\r\nhimself—half-malicious, half-ferocious; he almost immediately got up\r\nand took his leave; then, for the first time, I observed the agitation\r\nof my grandfather, and I must tell you, Maximilian, that I am the only\r\nperson capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame. And I\r\nsuspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his\r\npresence (for they always say and do what they like before the dear old\r\nman, without the smallest regard for his feelings) had made a strong\r\nimpression on his mind; for, naturally enough, it must have pained him\r\nto hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that\r\ndepreciating manner.”\r\n\r\n“The name of M. Noirtier,” interposed Maximilian, “is celebrated\r\nthroughout Europe; he was a statesman of high standing, and you may or\r\nmay not know, Valentine, that he took a leading part in every\r\nBonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the\r\nBourbons.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most\r\nstrange—the father a Bonapartist, the son a Royalist; what can have\r\nbeen the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics?\r\nBut to resume my story; I turned towards my grandfather, as though to\r\nquestion him as to the cause of his emotion; he looked expressively at\r\nthe newspaper I had been reading. ‘What is the matter, dear\r\ngrandfather?’ said I, ‘are you pleased?’ He gave me a sign in the\r\naffirmative. ‘With what my father said just now?’ He returned a sign in\r\nthe negative. ‘Perhaps you liked what M. Danglars said?’ Another sign\r\nin the negative. ‘Oh, then, you were glad to hear that M. Morrel (I\r\ndidn’t dare to say Maximilian) had been made an officer of the Legion\r\nof Honor?’ He signified assent; only think of the poor old man’s being\r\nso pleased to think that you, who were a perfect stranger to him, had\r\nbeen made an officer of the Legion of Honor! Perhaps it was a mere whim\r\non his part, for he is falling, they say, into second childhood, but I\r\nlove him for showing so much interest in you.”\r\n\r\n“How singular,” murmured Maximilian; “your father hates me, while your\r\ngrandfather, on the contrary—What strange feelings are aroused by\r\npolitics.”\r\n\r\n“Hush,” cried Valentine, suddenly; “someone is coming!” Maximilian\r\nleaped at one bound into his crop of lucern, which he began to pull up\r\nin the most ruthless way, under the pretext of being occupied in\r\nweeding it.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle, mademoiselle!” exclaimed a voice from behind the trees.\r\n“Madame is searching for you everywhere; there is a visitor in the\r\ndrawing-room.”\r\n\r\n“A visitor?” inquired Valentine, much agitated; “who is it?”\r\n\r\n“Some grand personage—a prince I believe they said—the Count of Monte\r\nCristo.”\r\n\r\n“I will come directly,” cried Valentine aloud.\r\n\r\nThe name of Monte Cristo sent an electric shock through the young man\r\non the other side of the iron gate, to whom Valentine’s _“I am coming”_\r\nwas the customary signal of farewell.\r\n\r\n“Now, then,” said Maximilian, leaning on the handle of his spade, “I\r\nwould give a good deal to know how it comes about that the Count of\r\nMonte Cristo is acquainted with M. de Villefort.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 52. Toxicology\r\n\r\nIt was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame\r\nde Villefort’s for the purpose of returning the procureur’s visit, and\r\nat his name, as may be easily imagined, the whole house was in\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort, who was alone in her drawing-room when the count\r\nwas announced, desired that her son might be brought thither instantly\r\nto renew his thanks to the count; and Edward, who heard this great\r\npersonage talked of for two whole days, made all possible haste to come\r\nto him, not from obedience to his mother, or out of any feeling of\r\ngratitude to the count, but from sheer curiosity, and that some chance\r\nremark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent\r\nspeeches which made his mother say:\r\n\r\n“Oh, that naughty child! But I can’t be severe with him, he is really\r\n_so_ bright.”\r\n\r\nAfter the usual civilities, the count inquired after M. de Villefort.\r\n\r\n“My husband dines with the chancellor,” replied the young lady; “he has\r\njust gone, and I am sure he’ll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the\r\npleasure of seeing you before he went.”\r\n\r\nTwo visitors who were there when the count arrived, having gazed at him\r\nwith all their eyes, retired after that reasonable delay which\r\npoliteness admits and curiosity requires.\r\n\r\n“What is your sister Valentine doing?” inquired Madame de Villefort of\r\nEdward; “tell someone to bid her come here, that I may have the honor\r\nof introducing her to the count.”\r\n\r\n“You have a daughter, then, madame?” inquired the count; “very young, I\r\npresume?”\r\n\r\n“The daughter of M. de Villefort by his first marriage,” replied the\r\nyoung wife, “a fine well-grown girl.”\r\n\r\n“But melancholy,” interrupted Master Edward, snatching the feathers out\r\nof the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded\r\nperch, in order to make a plume for his hat.\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort merely cried, “Be still, Edward!” She then added,\r\n“This young madcap is, however, very nearly right, and merely re-echoes\r\nwhat he has heard me say with pain a hundred times; for Mademoiselle de\r\nVillefort is, in spite of all we can do to rouse her, of a melancholy\r\ndisposition and taciturn habit, which frequently injure the effect of\r\nher beauty. But what detains her? Go, Edward, and see.”\r\n\r\n“Because they are looking for her where she is not to be found.”\r\n\r\n“And where are they looking for her?”\r\n\r\n“With grandpapa Noirtier.”\r\n\r\n“And do you think she is not there?”\r\n\r\n“No, no, no, no, no, she is not there,” replied Edward, singing his\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n“And where is she, then? If you know, why don’t you tell?”\r\n\r\n“She is under the big chestnut-tree,” replied the spoiled brat, as he\r\ngave, in spite of his mother’s commands, live flies to the parrot,\r\nwhich seemed keenly to relish such fare.\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort stretched out her hand to ring, intending to direct\r\nher waiting-maid to the spot where she would find Valentine, when the\r\nyoung lady herself entered the apartment. She appeared much dejected;\r\nand any person who considered her attentively might have observed the\r\ntraces of recent tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\nValentine, whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented\r\nto our readers without formally introducing her, was a tall and\r\ngraceful girl of nineteen, with bright chestnut hair, deep blue eyes,\r\nand that reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her\r\nmother. Her white and slender fingers, her pearly neck, her cheeks\r\ntinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely Englishwomen who\r\nhave been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of\r\na swan.\r\n\r\nShe entered the apartment, and seeing near her stepmother the stranger\r\nof whom she had already heard so much, saluted him without any girlish\r\nawkwardness, or even lowering her eyes, and with an elegance that\r\nredoubled the count’s attention.\r\n\r\nHe rose to return the salutation.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle de Villefort, my step-daughter,” said Madame de Villefort\r\nto Monte Cristo, leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards\r\nValentine with her hand.\r\n\r\n“And M. de Monte Cristo, King of China, Emperor of Cochin-China,” said\r\nthe young imp, looking slyly towards his sister.\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort at this really did turn pale, and was very nearly\r\nangry with this household plague, who answered to the name of Edward;\r\nbut the count, on the contrary, smiled, and appeared to look at the boy\r\ncomplacently, which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy\r\nand enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“But, madame,” replied the count, continuing the conversation, and\r\nlooking by turns at Madame de Villefort and Valentine, “have I not\r\nalready had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before? I\r\ncould not help thinking so just now; the idea came over my mind, and as\r\nmademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light\r\nthrown on a confused remembrance; excuse the remark.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think it likely, sir; Mademoiselle de Villefort is not very\r\nfond of society, and we very seldom go out,” said the young lady.\r\n\r\n“Then it was not in society that I met with mademoiselle or yourself,\r\nmadame, or this charming little merry boy. Besides, the Parisian world\r\nis entirely unknown to me, for, as I believe I told you, I have been in\r\nParis but very few days. No,—but, perhaps, you will permit me to call\r\nto mind—stay!”\r\n\r\nThe Count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts.\r\n\r\n“No—it was somewhere—away from here—it was—I do not know—but it appears\r\nthat this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some\r\nreligious _fête_; mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand, the\r\ninteresting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden, and you,\r\nmadame, were under the trellis of some arbor. Pray come to my aid,\r\nmadame; do not these circumstances appeal to your memory?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed,” replied Madame de Villefort; “and yet it appears to me,\r\nsir, that if I had met you anywhere, the recollection of you must have\r\nbeen imprinted on my memory.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the count saw us in Italy,” said Valentine timidly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, in Italy; it was in Italy most probably,” replied Monte Cristo;\r\n“you have travelled then in Italy, mademoiselle?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; madame and I were there two years ago. The doctors, anxious for\r\nmy lungs, had prescribed the air of Naples. We went by Bologna,\r\nPerugia, and Rome.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes—true, mademoiselle,” exclaimed Monte Cristo as if this simple\r\nexplanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought. “It\r\nwas at Perugia on Corpus Christi Day, in the garden of the Hôtel des\r\nPostes, when chance brought us together; you, Madame de Villefort, and\r\nher son; I now remember having had the honor of meeting you.”\r\n\r\n“I perfectly well remember Perugia, sir, and the Hôtel des Postes, and\r\nthe festival of which you speak,” said Madame de Villefort, “but in\r\nvain do I tax my memory, of whose treachery I am ashamed, for I really\r\ndo not recall to mind that I ever had the pleasure of seeing you\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\n“It is strange, but neither do I recollect meeting with you,” observed\r\nValentine, raising her beautiful eyes to the count.\r\n\r\n30065m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“But I remember it perfectly,” interposed the darling Edward.\r\n\r\n“I will assist your memory, madame,” continued the count; “the day had\r\nbeen burning hot; you were waiting for horses, which were delayed in\r\nconsequence of the festival. Mademoiselle was walking in the shade of\r\nthe garden, and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock.”\r\n\r\n“And I caught it, mamma, don’t you remember?” interposed Edward, “and I\r\npulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail.”\r\n\r\n“You, madame, remained under the arbor; do you not remember, that while\r\nyou were seated on a stone bench, and while, as I told you,\r\nMademoiselle de Villefort and your young son were absent, you conversed\r\nfor a considerable time with somebody?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, in truth, yes,” answered the young lady, turning very red, “I do\r\nremember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle; he\r\nwas a medical man, I think.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely so, madame; this man was myself; for a fortnight I had been\r\nat that hotel, during which period I had cured my valet de chambre of a\r\nfever, and my landlord of the jaundice, so that I really acquired a\r\nreputation as a skilful physician. We discoursed a long time, madame,\r\non different subjects; of Perugino, of Raphael, of manners, customs, of\r\nthe famous _aqua Tofana_, of which they had told you, I think you said,\r\nthat certain individuals in Perugia had preserved the secret.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, true,” replied Madame de Villefort, somewhat uneasily, “I\r\nremember now.”\r\n\r\n“I do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we\r\ndiscoursed, madame,” continued the count with perfect calmness; “but I\r\nperfectly remember that, falling into the error which others had\r\nentertained respecting me, you consulted me as to the health of\r\nMademoiselle de Villefort.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, really, sir, you were in fact a medical man,” said Madame de\r\nVillefort, “since you had cured the sick.”\r\n\r\n“Molière or Beaumarchais would reply to you, madame, that it was\r\nprecisely because I was not, that I had cured my patients; for myself,\r\nI am content to say to you that I have studied chemistry and the\r\nnatural sciences somewhat deeply, but still only as an amateur, you\r\nunderstand.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the clock struck six.\r\n\r\n“It is six o’clock,” said Madame de Villefort, evidently agitated.\r\n“Valentine, will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his\r\ndinner?”\r\n\r\nValentine rose, and saluting the count, left the apartment without\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n“Oh, madame,” said the count, when Valentine had left the room, “was it\r\non my account that you sent Mademoiselle de Villefort away?”\r\n\r\n“By no means,” replied the young lady quickly; “but this is the hour\r\nwhen we usually give M. Noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his\r\npitiful existence. You are aware, sir, of the deplorable condition of\r\nmy husband’s father?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame, M. de Villefort spoke of it to me—a paralysis, I think.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, yes; the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless; the mind alone\r\nis still active in this human machine, and that is faint and\r\nflickering, like the light of a lamp about to expire. But excuse me,\r\nsir, for talking of our domestic misfortunes; I interrupted you at the\r\nmoment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist.”\r\n\r\n“No, madame, I did not say as much as that,” replied the count with a\r\nsmile; “quite the contrary. I have studied chemistry because, having\r\ndetermined to live in eastern climates I have been desirous of\r\nfollowing the example of King Mithridates.”\r\n\r\n“_Mithridates, rex Ponticus_,” said the young scamp, as he tore some\r\nbeautiful portraits out of a splendid album, “the individual who took\r\ncream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast.”\r\n\r\n“Edward, you naughty boy,” exclaimed Madame de Villefort, snatching the\r\nmutilated book from the urchin’s grasp, “you are positively past\r\nbearing; you really disturb the conversation; go, leave us, and join\r\nyour sister Valentine in dear grandpapa Noirtier’s room.”\r\n\r\n“The album,” said Edward sulkily.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?—the album!”\r\n\r\n“I want the album.”\r\n\r\n“How dare you tear out the drawings?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it amuses me.”\r\n\r\n“Go—go at once.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t go unless you give me the album,” said the boy, seating\r\nhimself doggedly in an armchair, according to his habit of never giving\r\nway.\r\n\r\n“Take it, then, and pray disturb us no longer,” said Madame de\r\nVillefort, giving the album to Edward, who then went towards the door,\r\nled by his mother. The count followed her with his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Let us see if she shuts the door after him,” he muttered.\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort closed the door carefully after the child, the\r\ncount appearing not to notice her; then casting a scrutinizing glance\r\naround the chamber, the young wife returned to her chair, in which she\r\nseated herself.\r\n\r\n“Allow me to observe, madame,” said the count, with that kind tone he\r\ncould assume so well, “you are really very severe with that dear clever\r\nchild.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sometimes severity is quite necessary,” replied Madame de\r\nVillefort, with all a mother’s real firmness.\r\n\r\n“It was his Cornelius Nepos that Master Edward was repeating when he\r\nreferred to King Mithridates,” continued the count, “and you\r\ninterrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no\r\nmeans neglected him, for your son is really advanced for his years.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is, count,” answered the mother, agreeably flattered, “he has\r\ngreat aptitude, and learns all that is set before him. He has but one\r\nfault, he is somewhat wilful; but really, on referring for the moment\r\nto what he said, do you truly believe that Mithridates used these\r\nprecautions, and that these precautions were efficacious?”\r\n\r\n“I think so, madame, because I myself have made use of them, that I\r\nmight not be poisoned at Naples, at Palermo, and at Smyrna—that is to\r\nsay, on three several occasions when, but for these precautions, I must\r\nhave lost my life.”\r\n\r\n“And your precautions were successful?”\r\n\r\n“Completely so.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I remember now your mentioning to me at Perugia something of this\r\nsort.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said the count with an air of surprise, remarkably well\r\ncounterfeited; “I really did not remember.”\r\n\r\n“I inquired of you if poisons acted equally, and with the same effect,\r\non men of the North as on men of the South; and you answered me that\r\nthe cold and sluggish habits of the North did not present the same\r\naptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the\r\nSouth.”\r\n\r\n“And that is the case,” observed Monte Cristo. “I have seen Russians\r\ndevour, without being visibly inconvenienced, vegetable substances\r\nwhich would infallibly have killed a Neapolitan or an Arab.”\r\n\r\n“And you really believe the result would be still more sure with us\r\nthan in the East, and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would\r\nhabituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this\r\nprogressive absorption of poison?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; it being at the same time perfectly understood that he\r\nshould have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not\r\nbeen accustomed.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I understand that; and how would you habituate yourself, for\r\ninstance, or rather, how did you habituate yourself to it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, very easily. Suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be\r\nmade use of against you; suppose the poison was, for instance,\r\nbrucine——”\r\n\r\n“Brucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not?” inquired\r\nMadame de Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Precisely, madame,” replied Monte Cristo; “but I perceive I have not\r\nmuch to teach you. Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge; such\r\nlearning is very rare among ladies.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am aware of that,” said Madame de Villefort; “but I have a\r\npassion for the occult sciences, which speak to the imagination like\r\npoetry, and are reducible to figures, like an algebraic equation; but\r\ngo on, I beg of you; what you say interests me to the greatest degree.”\r\n\r\n30069m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Monte Cristo “suppose, then, that this poison was\r\nbrucine, and you were to take a milligramme the first day, two\r\nmilligrammes the second day, and so on. Well, at the end of ten days\r\nyou would have taken a centigramme, at the end of twenty days,\r\nincreasing another milligramme, you would have taken three hundred\r\ncentigrammes; that is to say, a dose which you would support without\r\ninconvenience, and which would be very dangerous for any other person\r\nwho had not taken the same precautions as yourself. Well, then, at the\r\nend of a month, when drinking water from the same carafe, you would\r\nkill the person who drank with you, without your perceiving, otherwise\r\nthan from slight inconvenience, that there was any poisonous substance\r\nmingled with this water.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know any other counter-poisons?”\r\n\r\n“I do not.”\r\n\r\n“I have often read, and read again, the history of Mithridates,” said\r\nMadame de Villefort in a tone of reflection, “and had always considered\r\nit a fable.”\r\n\r\n“No, madame, contrary to most history, it is true; but what you tell\r\nme, madame, what you inquire of me, is not the result of a chance\r\nquery, for two years ago you asked me the same questions, and said\r\nthen, that for a very long time this history of Mithridates had\r\noccupied your mind.”\r\n\r\n“True, sir. The two favorite studies of my youth were botany and\r\nmineralogy, and subsequently, when I learned that the use of simples\r\nfrequently explained the whole history of a people, and the entire life\r\nof individuals in the East, as flowers betoken and symbolize a love\r\naffair, I have regretted that I was not a man, that I might have been a\r\nFlamel, a Fontana, or a Cabanis.”\r\n\r\n“And the more, madame,” said Monte Cristo, “as the Orientals do not\r\nconfine themselves, as did Mithridates, to make a cuirass of his\r\npoisons, but they also made them a dagger. Science becomes, in their\r\nhands, not only a defensive weapon, but still more frequently an\r\noffensive one; the one serves against all their physical sufferings,\r\nthe other against all their enemies. With opium, belladonna, brucea,\r\nsnake-wood, and the cherry-laurel, they put to sleep all who stand in\r\ntheir way. There is not one of those women, Egyptian, Turkish, or\r\nGreek, whom here you call ‘good women,’ who do not know how, by means\r\nof chemistry, to stupefy a doctor, and in psychology to amaze a\r\nconfessor.”\r\n\r\n“Really,” said Madame de Villefort, whose eyes sparkled with strange\r\nfire at this conversation.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, indeed, madame,” continued Monte Cristo, “the secret dramas\r\nof the East begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion—begin\r\nwith paradise and end with—hell. There are as many elixirs of every\r\nkind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral\r\nnature of humanity; and I will say further—the art of these chemists is\r\ncapable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the\r\nremedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance.”\r\n\r\n“But, sir,” remarked the young woman, “these Eastern societies, in the\r\nmidst of which you have passed a portion of your existence, are as\r\nfantastic as the tales that come from their strange land. A man can\r\neasily be put out of the way there, then; it is, indeed, the Bagdad and\r\nBassora of the _Thousand and One Nights_. The sultans and viziers who\r\nrule over society there, and who constitute what in France we call the\r\ngovernment, are really Haroun-al-Raschids and Giaffars, who not only\r\npardon a poisoner, but even make him a prime minister, if his crime has\r\nbeen an ingenious one, and who, under such circumstances, have the\r\nwhole story written in letters of gold, to divert their hours of\r\nidleness and _ennui_.”\r\n\r\n“By no means, madame; the fanciful exists no longer in the East. There,\r\ndisguised under other names, and concealed under other costumes, are\r\npolice agents, magistrates, attorneys-general, and bailiffs. They hang,\r\nbehead, and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible\r\nmanner; but some of these, like clever rogues, have contrived to escape\r\nhuman justice, and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning\r\nstratagems. Amongst us a simpleton, possessed by the demon of hate or\r\ncupidity, who has an enemy to destroy, or some near relation to dispose\r\nof, goes straight to the grocer’s or druggist’s, gives a false name,\r\nwhich leads more easily to his detection than his real one, and under\r\nthe pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping, purchases five or\r\nsix grammes of arsenic—if he is really a cunning fellow, he goes to\r\nfive or six different druggists or grocers, and thereby becomes only\r\nfive or six times more easily traced;—then, when he has acquired his\r\nspecific, he administers duly to his enemy, or near kinsman, a dose of\r\narsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst, and which,\r\nwithout rhyme or reason, makes his victim utter groans which alarm the\r\nentire neighborhood. Then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables.\r\nThey fetch a doctor, who opens the dead body, and collects from the\r\nentrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon. Next day a\r\nhundred newspapers relate the fact, with the names of the victim and\r\nthe murderer. The same evening the grocer or grocers, druggist or\r\ndruggists, come and say, ‘It was I who sold the arsenic to the\r\ngentleman;’ and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser, they\r\nwill recognize twenty. Then the foolish criminal is taken, imprisoned,\r\ninterrogated, confronted, confounded, condemned, and cut off by hemp or\r\nsteel; or if she be a woman of any consideration, they lock her up for\r\nlife. This is the way in which you Northerns understand chemistry,\r\nmadame. Desrues was, however, I must confess, more skilful.”\r\n\r\n“What would you have, sir?” said the lady, laughing; “we do what we\r\ncan. All the world has not the secret of the Medicis or the Borgias.”\r\n\r\n“Now,” replied the count, shrugging his shoulders, “shall I tell you\r\nthe cause of all these stupidities? It is because, at your theatres, by\r\nwhat at least I could judge by reading the pieces they play, they see\r\npersons swallow the contents of a phial, or suck the button of a ring,\r\nand fall dead instantly. Five minutes afterwards the curtain falls, and\r\nthe spectators depart. They are ignorant of the consequences of the\r\nmurder; they see neither the police commissary with his badge of\r\noffice, nor the corporal with his four men; and so the poor fools\r\nbelieve that the whole thing is as easy as lying. But go a little way\r\nfrom France—go either to Aleppo or Cairo, or only to Naples or Rome,\r\nand you will see people passing by you in the streets—people erect,\r\nsmiling, and fresh-colored, of whom Asmodeus, if you were holding on by\r\nthe skirt of his mantle, would say, ‘That man was poisoned three weeks\r\nago; he will be a dead man in a month.’”\r\n\r\n“Then,” remarked Madame de Villefort, “they have again discovered the\r\nsecret of the famous _aqua Tofana_ that they said was lost at Perugia.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but madame, does mankind ever lose anything? The arts change about\r\nand make a tour of the world; things take a different name, and the\r\nvulgar do not follow them—that is all; but there is always the same\r\nresult. Poisons act particularly on some organ or another—one on the\r\nstomach, another on the brain, another on the intestines. Well, the\r\npoison brings on a cough, the cough an inflammation of the lungs, or\r\nsome other complaint catalogued in the book of science, which, however,\r\nby no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal; and if it were\r\nnot, would be sure to become so, thanks to the remedies applied by\r\nfoolish doctors, who are generally bad chemists, and which will act in\r\nfavor of or against the malady, as you please; and then there is a\r\nhuman being killed according to all the rules of art and skill, and of\r\nwhom justice learns nothing, as was said by a terrible chemist of my\r\nacquaintance, the worthy Abbé Adelmonte of Taormina, in Sicily, who has\r\nstudied these national phenomena very profoundly.”\r\n\r\n“It is quite frightful, but deeply interesting,” said the young lady,\r\nmotionless with attention. “I thought, I must confess, that these\r\ntales, were inventions of the Middle Ages.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, no doubt, but improved upon by ours. What is the use of time,\r\nrewards of merit, medals, crosses, Monthyon prizes, if they do not lead\r\nsociety towards more complete perfection? Yet man will never be perfect\r\nuntil he learns to create and destroy; he does know how to destroy, and\r\nthat is half the battle.”\r\n\r\n“So,” added Madame de Villefort, constantly returning to her object,\r\n“the poisons of the Borgias, the Medicis, the Renées, the Ruggieris,\r\nand later, probably, that of Baron de Trenck, whose story has been so\r\nmisused by modern drama and romance——”\r\n\r\n“Were objects of art, madame, and nothing more,” replied the count. “Do\r\nyou suppose that the real _savant_ addresses himself stupidly to the\r\nmere individual? By no means. Science loves eccentricities, leaps and\r\nbounds, trials of strength, fancies, if I may be allowed so to term\r\nthem. Thus, for instance, the excellent Abbé Adelmonte, of whom I spoke\r\njust now, made in this way some marvellous experiments.”\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I will mention one to you. He had a remarkably fine garden, full\r\nof vegetables, flowers, and fruit. From amongst these vegetables he\r\nselected the most simple—a cabbage, for instance. For three days he\r\nwatered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic; on the third, the\r\ncabbage began to droop and turn yellow. At that moment he cut it. In\r\nthe eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table, and preserved its\r\nwholesome appearance. It was only poisoned to the Abbé Adelmonte. He\r\nthen took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbits—for the Abbé\r\nAdelmonte had a collection of rabbits, cats, and guinea-pigs, fully as\r\nfine as his collection of vegetables, flowers, and fruit. Well, the\r\nAbbé Adelmonte took a rabbit, and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage.\r\nThe rabbit died. What magistrate would find, or even venture to\r\ninsinuate, anything against this? What procureur has ever ventured to\r\ndraw up an accusation against M. Magendie or M. Flourens, in\r\nconsequence of the rabbits, cats, and guinea-pigs they have killed?—not\r\none. So, then, the rabbit dies, and justice takes no notice. This\r\nrabbit dead, the Abbé Adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook\r\nand thrown on the dunghill; on this dunghill is a hen, who, pecking\r\nthese intestines, is in her turn taken ill, and dies next day. At the\r\nmoment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death, a vulture is\r\nflying by (there are a good many vultures in Adelmonte’s country); this\r\nbird darts on the dead fowl, and carries it away to a rock, where it\r\ndines off its prey. Three days afterwards, this poor vulture, which has\r\nbeen very much indisposed since that dinner, suddenly feels very giddy\r\nwhile flying aloft in the clouds, and falls heavily into a fish-pond.\r\nThe pike, eels, and carp eat greedily always, as everybody knows—well,\r\nthey feast on the vulture. Now suppose that next day, one of these\r\neels, or pike, or carp, poisoned at the fourth remove, is served up at\r\nyour table. Well, then, your guest will be poisoned at the fifth\r\nremove, and die, at the end of eight or ten days, of pains in the\r\nintestines, sickness, or abscess of the pylorus. The doctors open the\r\nbody and say with an air of profound learning, ‘The subject has died of\r\na tumor on the liver, or of typhoid fever!’”\r\n\r\n“But,” remarked Madame de Villefort, “all these circumstances which you\r\nlink thus to one another may be broken by the least accident; the\r\nvulture may not see the fowl, or may fall a hundred yards from the\r\nfish-pond.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that is where the art comes in. To be a great chemist in the East,\r\none must direct chance; and this is to be achieved.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort was in deep thought, yet listened attentively.\r\n\r\n“But,” she exclaimed, suddenly, “arsenic is indelible, indestructible;\r\nin whatsoever way it is absorbed, it will be found again in the body of\r\nthe victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient\r\nquantity to cause death.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely so,” cried Monte Cristo—“precisely so; and this is what I\r\nsaid to my worthy Adelmonte. He reflected, smiled, and replied to me by\r\na Sicilian proverb, which I believe is also a French proverb, ‘My son,\r\nthe world was not made in a day—but in seven. Return on Sunday.’ On the\r\nSunday following I did return to him. Instead of having watered his\r\ncabbage with arsenic, he had watered it this time with a solution of\r\nsalts, having their basis in strychnine, _strychnos colubrina_, as the\r\nlearned term it. Now, the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of\r\ndisease in the world, and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust;\r\nyet, five minutes afterwards, the rabbit was dead. The fowl pecked at\r\nthe rabbit, and the next day was a dead hen. This time we were the\r\nvultures; so we opened the bird, and this time all special symptoms had\r\ndisappeared, there were only general symptoms. There was no peculiar\r\nindication in any organ—an excitement of the nervous system—that was\r\nit; a case of cerebral congestion—nothing more. The fowl had not been\r\npoisoned—she had died of apoplexy. Apoplexy is a rare disease among\r\nfowls, I believe, but very common among men.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort appeared more and more thoughtful.\r\n\r\n“It is very fortunate,” she observed, “that such substances could only\r\nbe prepared by chemists; otherwise, all the world would be poisoning\r\neach other.”\r\n\r\n“By chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry,” said Monte\r\nCristo carelessly.\r\n\r\n“And then,” said Madame de Villefort, endeavoring by a struggle, and\r\nwith effort, to get away from her thoughts, “however skilfully it is\r\nprepared, crime is always crime, and if it avoid human scrutiny, it\r\ndoes not escape the eye of God. The Orientals are stronger than we are\r\nin cases of conscience, and, very prudently, have no hell—that is the\r\npoint.”\r\n\r\n30075m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Really, madame, this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure\r\nmind like yours, but which would easily yield before sound reasoning.\r\nThe bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of\r\nJean Jacques Rousseau,—you remember,—the mandarin who is killed five\r\nhundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger. Man’s whole life\r\npasses in doing these things, and his intellect is exhausted by\r\nreflecting on them. You will find very few persons who will go and\r\nbrutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow-creature, or will\r\nadminister to him, in order to remove him from the surface of the globe\r\non which we move with life and animation, that quantity of arsenic of\r\nwhich we just now talked. Such a thing is really out of rule—eccentric\r\nor stupid. To attain such a point, the blood must be heated to\r\nthirty-six degrees, the pulse be, at least, at ninety, and the feelings\r\nexcited beyond the ordinary limit. But suppose one pass, as is\r\npermissible in philology, from the word itself to its softened synonym,\r\nthen, instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an\r\n‘elimination;’ you merely and simply remove from your path the\r\nindividual who is in your way, and that without shock or violence,\r\nwithout the display of the sufferings which, in the case of becoming a\r\npunishment, make a martyr of the victim, and a butcher, in every sense\r\nof the word, of him who inflicts them. Then there will be no blood, no\r\ngroans, no convulsions, and above all, no consciousness of that horrid\r\nand compromising moment of accomplishing the act,—then one escapes the\r\nclutch of the human law, which says, ‘Do not disturb society!’ This is\r\nthe mode in which they manage these things, and succeed in Eastern\r\nclimes, where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very\r\nlittle for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance.”\r\n\r\n“Yet conscience remains,” remarked Madame de Villefort in an agitated\r\nvoice, and with a stifled sigh.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Monte Cristo “happily, yes, conscience does remain; and\r\nif it did not, how wretched we should be! After every action requiring\r\nexertion, it is conscience that saves us, for it supplies us with a\r\nthousand good excuses, of which we alone are judges; and these reasons,\r\nhowsoever excellent in producing sleep, would avail us but very little\r\nbefore a tribunal, when we were tried for our lives. Thus Richard III.,\r\nfor instance, was marvellously served by his conscience after the\r\nputting away of the two children of Edward IV.; in fact, he could say,\r\n‘These two children of a cruel and persecuting king, who have inherited\r\nthe vices of their father, which I alone could perceive in their\r\njuvenile propensities—these two children are impediments in my way of\r\npromoting the happiness of the English people, whose unhappiness they\r\n(the children) would infallibly have caused.’ Thus was Lady Macbeth\r\nserved by her conscience, when she sought to give her son, and not her\r\nhusband (whatever Shakespeare may say), a throne. Ah, maternal love is\r\na great virtue, a powerful motive—so powerful that it excuses a\r\nmultitude of things, even if, after Duncan’s death, Lady Macbeth had\r\nbeen at all pricked by her conscience.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and\r\nhorrible paradoxes, delivered by the count with that ironical\r\nsimplicity which was peculiar to him.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment’s silence, the lady inquired:\r\n\r\n“Do you know, my dear count,” she said, “that you are a very terrible\r\nreasoner, and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered\r\nmedium? Have you really measured the world by scrutinies, or through\r\nalembics and crucibles? For you must indeed be a great chemist, and the\r\nelixir you administered to my son, which recalled him to life almost\r\ninstantaneously——”\r\n\r\n30077m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, do not place any reliance on that, madame; _one_ drop of that\r\nelixir sufficed to recall life to a dying child, but three drops would\r\nhave impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have\r\nproduced most violent palpitations; six would have suspended his\r\nrespiration, and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was;\r\nten would have destroyed him. You know, madame, how suddenly I snatched\r\nhim from those phials which he so imprudently touched?”\r\n\r\n“Is it then so terrible a poison?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! In the first place, let us agree that the word poison does not\r\nexist, because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons,\r\nwhich become, according as they are employed, most salutary remedies.”\r\n\r\n“What, then, is it?”\r\n\r\n“A skilful preparation of my friend’s the worthy Abbé Adelmonte, who\r\ntaught me the use of it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” observed Madame de Villefort, “it must be an admirable\r\nanti-spasmodic.”\r\n\r\n“Perfect, madame, as you have seen,” replied the count; “and I\r\nfrequently make use of it—with all possible prudence though, be it\r\nobserved,” he added with a smile of intelligence.\r\n\r\n“Most assuredly,” responded Madame de Villefort in the same tone. “As\r\nfor me, so nervous, and so subject to fainting fits, I should require a\r\nDoctor Adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and\r\ntranquillizing my mind, in the fear I have of dying some fine day of\r\nsuffocation. In the meanwhile, as the thing is difficult to find in\r\nFrance, and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to\r\nParis on my account, I must continue to use Monsieur Planche’s\r\nanti-spasmodics; and mint and Hoffman’s drops are among my favorite\r\nremedies. Here are some lozenges which I have made up on purpose; they\r\nare compounded doubly strong.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo opened the tortoise-shell box, which the lady presented to\r\nhim, and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur\r\nwho thoroughly appreciated their composition.\r\n\r\n“They are indeed exquisite,” he said; “but as they are necessarily\r\nsubmitted to the process of deglutition—a function which it is\r\nfrequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish—I prefer my\r\nown specific.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly, and so should I prefer it, after the effects I have seen\r\nproduced; but of course it is a secret, and I am not so indiscreet as\r\nto ask it of you.”\r\n\r\n“But I,” said Monte Cristo, rising as he spoke—“I am gallant enough to\r\noffer it you.”\r\n\r\n30079m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“How kind you are.”\r\n\r\n“Only remember one thing—a small dose is a remedy, a large one is\r\npoison. One drop will restore life, as you have seen; five or six will\r\ninevitably kill, and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as, poured\r\ninto a glass of wine, it would not in the slightest degree affect its\r\nflavor. But I say no more, madame; it is really as if I were\r\nprescribing for you.”\r\n\r\nThe clock struck half-past six, and a lady was announced, a friend of\r\nMadame de Villefort, who came to dine with her.\r\n\r\n“If I had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time,\r\ncount, instead of only for the second,” said Madame de Villefort; “if I\r\nhad had the honor of being your friend, instead of only having the\r\nhappiness of being under an obligation to you, I should insist on\r\ndetaining you to dinner, and not allow myself to be daunted by a first\r\nrefusal.”\r\n\r\n“A thousand thanks, madame,” replied Monte Cristo “but I have an\r\nengagement which I cannot break. I have promised to escort to the\r\nAcadémie a Greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your\r\ngrand opera, and who relies on me to conduct her thither.”\r\n\r\n“Adieu, then, sir, and do not forget the prescription.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, in truth, madame, to do that I must forget the hour’s conversation\r\nI have had with you, which is indeed impossible.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo bowed, and left the house. Madame de Villefort remained\r\nimmersed in thought.\r\n\r\n“He is a very strange man,” she said, “and in my opinion is himself the\r\nAdelmonte he talks about.”\r\n\r\nAs to Monte Cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations.\r\n\r\n“Good,” said he, as he went away; “this is a fruitful soil, and I feel\r\ncertain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground.”\r\n\r\nNext morning, faithful to his promise, he sent the prescription\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 53. Robert le Diable\r\n\r\nThe pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible, as\r\nthere chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction\r\nat the Académie Royale. Levasseur, who had been suffering under severe\r\nillness, made his reappearance in the character of _Bertram_, and, as\r\nusual, the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite\r\ncomposer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience.\r\nMorcerf, like most other young men of rank and fortune, had his\r\norchestra stall, with the certainty of always finding a seat in at\r\nleast a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his\r\nacquaintance; he had, moreover, his right of entry into the omnibus\r\nbox. Château-Renaud rented a stall beside his own, while Beauchamp, as\r\na journalist, had unlimited range all over the theatre. It happened\r\nthat on this particular night the minister’s box was placed at the\r\ndisposal of Lucien Debray, who offered it to the Comte de Morcerf, who\r\nagain, upon his rejection of it by Mercédès, sent it to Danglars, with\r\nan intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining\r\nthe baroness and her daughter during the evening, in the event of their\r\naccepting the box in question. The ladies received the offer with too\r\nmuch pleasure to dream of a refusal. To no class of persons is the\r\npresentation of a gratuitous opera-box more acceptable than to the\r\nwealthy millionaire, who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying\r\na king’s ransom in his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\nDanglars had, however, protested against showing himself in a\r\nministerial box, declaring that his political principles, and his\r\nparliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not\r\npermit him so to commit himself; the baroness had, therefore,\r\ndespatched a note to Lucien Debray, bidding him call for them, it being\r\nwholly impossible for her to go alone with Eugénie to the opera.\r\n\r\nThere is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction\r\nwould have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone\r\nwithout escort, while the addition of a third, in the person of her\r\nmother’s admitted lover, enabled Mademoiselle Danglars to defy malice\r\nand ill-nature. One must take the world as one finds it.\r\n\r\n30083m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curtain rose, as usual, to an almost empty house, it being one of\r\nthe absurdities of Parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until\r\nafter the beginning of the performance, so that the first act is\r\ngenerally played without the slightest attention being paid to it, that\r\npart of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in\r\nobserving the fresh arrivals, while nothing is heard but the noise of\r\nopening and shutting doors, and the buzz of conversation.\r\n\r\n“Surely,” said Albert, as the door of a box on the first circle opened,\r\n“that must be the Countess G——.”\r\n\r\n“And who is the Countess G——?” inquired Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“What a question! Now, do you know, baron, I have a great mind to pick\r\na quarrel with you for asking it; as if all the world did not know who\r\nthe Countess G—— was.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, to be sure,” replied Château-Renaud; “the lovely Venetian, is it\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“Herself.” At this moment the countess perceived Albert, and returned\r\nhis salutation with a smile.\r\n\r\n“You know her, it seems?” said Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“Franz introduced me to her at Rome,” replied Albert.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for you\r\nin Rome?”\r\n\r\n“With pleasure.”\r\n\r\nThere was a cry of “Shut up!” from the audience. This manifestation on\r\nthe part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the\r\nmusic, produced not the slightest effect on the two young men, who\r\ncontinued their conversation.\r\n\r\n“The countess was present at the races in the Champ-de-Mars,” said\r\nChâteau-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“Today?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Bless me, I quite forgot the races. Did you bet?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, merely a paltry fifty louis.”\r\n\r\n“And who was the winner?”\r\n\r\n“Nautilus. I staked on him.”\r\n\r\n“But there were three races, were there not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; there was the prize given by the Jockey Club—a gold cup, you\r\nknow—and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race.”\r\n\r\n“What was it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, shut up!” again interposed some of the audience.\r\n\r\n“Why, it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course.”\r\n\r\n“Is that possible?”\r\n\r\n“True as day. The fact was, nobody had observed a horse entered by the\r\nname of Vampa, or that of a jockey styled Job, when, at the last\r\nmoment, a splendid roan, mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist,\r\npresented themselves at the starting-post. They were obliged to stuff\r\nat least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider’s pockets, to\r\nmake him weight; but with all that he outstripped Ariel and Barbare,\r\nagainst whom he ran, by at least three whole lengths.”\r\n\r\n“And was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey\r\nbelonged?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“You say that the horse was entered under the name of Vampa?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly; that was the title.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” answered Albert, “I am better informed than you are, and know\r\nwho the owner of that horse was.”\r\n\r\n“Shut up, there!” cried the pit in chorus. And this time the tone and\r\nmanner in which the command was given, betokened such growing hostility\r\nthat the two young men perceived, for the first time, that the mandate\r\nwas addressed to them. Leisurely turning round, they calmly scrutinized\r\nthe various countenances around them, as though demanding some one\r\nperson who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they\r\ndeemed excessive impertinence; but as no one responded to the\r\nchallenge, the friends turned again to the front of the theatre, and\r\naffected to busy themselves with the stage. At this moment the door of\r\nthe minister’s box opened, and Madame Danglars, accompanied by her\r\ndaughter, entered, escorted by Lucien Debray, who assiduously conducted\r\nthem to their seats.\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha,” said Château-Renaud, “here come some friends of yours,\r\nviscount! What are you looking at there? don’t you see they are trying\r\nto catch your eye?”\r\n\r\nAlbert turned round, just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan\r\nfrom the baroness; as for Mademoiselle Eugénie, she scarcely vouchsafed\r\nto waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of\r\nthe stage.\r\n\r\n“I tell you what, my dear fellow,” said Château-Renaud, “I cannot\r\nimagine what objection you can possibly have to Mademoiselle\r\nDanglars—that is, setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat\r\ninferior rank, which by the way I don’t think you care very much about.\r\nNow, barring all that, I mean to say she is a deuced fine girl!”\r\n\r\n“Handsome, certainly,” replied Albert, “but not to my taste, which I\r\nconfess, inclines to something softer, gentler, and more feminine.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, well,” exclaimed Château-Renaud, who because he had seen his\r\nthirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of\r\npaternal air with his more youthful friend, “you young people are never\r\nsatisfied; why, what would you have more? your parents have chosen you\r\na bride built on the model of Diana, the huntress, and yet you are not\r\ncontent.”\r\n\r\n“No, for that very resemblance affrights me; I should have liked\r\nsomething more in the manner of the Venus of Milo or Capua; but this\r\nchase-loving Diana, continually surrounded by her nymphs, gives me a\r\nsort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of Actæon.”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, it required but one glance at Mademoiselle Danglars to\r\ncomprehend the justness of Morcerf’s remark. She was beautiful, but her\r\nbeauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious\r\ntaste; her hair was raven black, but its natural waves seemed somewhat\r\nrebellious; her eyes, of the same color as her hair, were surmounted by\r\nwell-arched brows, whose great defect, however, consisted in an almost\r\nhabitual frown, while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of\r\nfirmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler\r\nattributes of her sex—her nose was precisely what a sculptor would have\r\nchosen for a chiselled Juno. Her mouth, which might have been found\r\nfault with as too large, displayed teeth of pearly whiteness, rendered\r\nstill more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips,\r\ncontrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion. But that which\r\ncompleted the almost masculine look Morcerf found so little to his\r\ntaste, was a dark mole, of much larger dimensions than these freaks of\r\nnature generally are, placed just at the corner of her mouth; and the\r\neffect tended to increase the expression of self-dependence that\r\ncharacterized her countenance.\r\n\r\nThe rest of Mademoiselle Eugénie’s person was in perfect keeping with\r\nthe head just described; she, indeed, reminded one of Diana, as\r\nChâteau-Renaud observed, but her bearing was more haughty and resolute.\r\n\r\nAs regarded her attainments, the only fault to be found with them was\r\nthe same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her\r\nbeauty, that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young\r\na person. She was a perfect linguist, a first-rate artist, wrote\r\npoetry, and composed music; to the study of the latter she professed to\r\nbe entirely devoted, following it with an indefatigable perseverance,\r\nassisted by a schoolfellow,—a young woman without fortune whose talent\r\npromised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer. It was rumored\r\nthat she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the\r\nprincipal composers of the day, who excited her to spare no pains in\r\nthe cultivation of her voice, which might hereafter prove a source of\r\nwealth and independence. But this counsel effectually decided\r\nMademoiselle Danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public\r\nwith one destined for a theatrical life; and acting upon this\r\nprinciple, the banker’s daughter, though perfectly willing to allow\r\nMademoiselle Louise d’Armilly (that was the name of the young virtuosa)\r\nto practice with her through the day, took especial care not to be seen\r\nin her company. Still, though not actually received at the Hôtel\r\nDanglars in the light of an acknowledged friend, Louise was treated\r\nwith far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a\r\ngoverness.\r\n\r\nThe curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of Madame\r\nDanglars into her box, the band quitted the orchestra for the\r\naccustomed half-hour’s interval allowed between the acts, and the\r\naudience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies, or to\r\npay and receive visits in their respective boxes.\r\n\r\nMorcerf and Château-Renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves\r\nof this permission. For an instant the idea struck Madame Danglars that\r\nthis eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his\r\nimpatience to join her party, and she whispered her expectations to her\r\ndaughter, that Albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them.\r\nMademoiselle Eugénie, however, merely returned a dissenting movement of\r\nthe head, while, with a cold smile, she directed the attention of her\r\nmother to an opposite box on the first circle, in which sat the\r\nCountess G——, and where Morcerf had just made his appearance.\r\n\r\n30087m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“So we meet again, my travelling friend, do we?” cried the countess,\r\nextending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old\r\nacquaintance; “it was really very good of you to recognize me so\r\nquickly, and still more so to bestow your first visit on me.”\r\n\r\n“Be assured,” replied Albert, “that if I had been aware of your arrival\r\nin Paris, and had known your address, I should have paid my respects to\r\nyou before this. Allow me to introduce my friend, Baron de\r\nChâteau-Renaud, one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in\r\nFrance, and from whom I have just learned that you were a spectator of\r\nthe races in the Champ-de-Mars, yesterday.”\r\n\r\nChâteau-Renaud bowed to the countess.\r\n\r\n“So you were at the races, baron?” inquired the countess eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” pursued Madame G—— with considerable animation, “you can\r\nprobably tell me who won the Jockey Club stakes?”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to say I cannot,” replied the baron; “and I was just asking\r\nthe same question of Albert.”\r\n\r\n“Are you very anxious to know, countess?” asked Albert.\r\n\r\n“To know what?”\r\n\r\n“The name of the owner of the winning horse?”\r\n\r\n“Excessively; only imagine—but do tell me, viscount, whether you really\r\nare acquainted with it or no?”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, madame, but you were about to relate some story,\r\nwere you not? You said, ‘only imagine,’—and then paused. Pray\r\ncontinue.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, listen. You must know I felt so interested in the splendid\r\nroan horse, with his elegant little rider, so tastefully dressed in a\r\npink satin jacket and cap, that I could not help praying for their\r\nsuccess with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were\r\nat stake; and when I saw them outstrip all the others, and come to the\r\nwinning-post in such gallant style, I actually clapped my hands with\r\njoy. Imagine my surprise, when, upon returning home, the first object I\r\nmet on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket! I\r\nconcluded that, by some singular chance, the owner of the winning horse\r\nmust live in the same hotel as myself; but, as I entered my apartments,\r\nI beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and\r\nrider. Inside the cup was a small piece of paper, on which were written\r\nthese words—‘From Lord Ruthven to Countess G——.’”\r\n\r\n“Precisely; I was sure of it,” said Morcerf.\r\n\r\n“Sure of what?”\r\n\r\n“That the owner of the horse was Lord Ruthven himself.”\r\n\r\n“What Lord Ruthven do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Why, our Lord Ruthven—the Vampire of the Salle Argentina!”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible?” exclaimed the countess; “is he here in Paris?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure,—why not?”\r\n\r\n“And you visit him?—meet him at your own house and elsewhere?”\r\n\r\n“I assure you he is my most intimate friend, and M. de Château-Renaud\r\nhas also the honor of his acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n“But why are you so sure of his being the winner of the Jockey Club\r\nprize?”\r\n\r\n“Was not the winning horse entered by the name of Vampa?”\r\n\r\n“What of that?”\r\n\r\n“Why, do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom I\r\nwas made prisoner?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes.”\r\n\r\n“And from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a\r\nmanner?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure, I remember it all now.”\r\n\r\n“He called himself Vampa. You see, it’s evident where the count got the\r\nname.”\r\n\r\n“But what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me?”\r\n\r\n“In the first place, because I had spoken much of you to him, as you\r\nmay believe; and in the second, because he delighted to see a\r\ncountrywoman take so lively an interest in his success.”\r\n\r\n“I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish\r\nremarks we used to make about him?”\r\n\r\n“I should not like to affirm upon oath that I have not. Besides, his\r\npresenting you the cup under the name of Lord Ruthven——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but that is dreadful! Why, the man must owe me a fearful grudge.”\r\n\r\n“Does his action appear like that of an enemy?”\r\n\r\n“No; certainly not.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then——”\r\n\r\n“And so he is in Paris?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And what effect does he produce?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Albert, “he was talked about for a week; then the\r\ncoronation of the queen of England took place, followed by the theft of\r\nMademoiselle Mars’s diamonds; and so people talked of something else.”\r\n\r\n“My good fellow,” said Château-Renaud, “the count is your friend and\r\nyou treat him accordingly. Do not believe what Albert is telling you,\r\ncountess; so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian circles by\r\nthe appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having abated, I take upon\r\nmyself to declare that it is as strong as ever. His first astounding\r\nact upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses, worth\r\n32,000 francs, to Madame Danglars; his second, the almost miraculous\r\npreservation of Madame de Villefort’s life; now it seems that he has\r\ncarried off the prize awarded by the Jockey Club. I therefore maintain,\r\nin spite of Morcerf, that not only is the count the object of interest\r\nat this present moment, but also that he will continue to be so for a\r\nmonth longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which,\r\nafter all, may be his ordinary mode of existence.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right,” said Morcerf; “meanwhile, who is in the\r\nRussian ambassador’s box?”\r\n\r\n“Which box do you mean?” asked the countess.\r\n\r\n“The one between the pillars on the first tier—it seems to have been\r\nfitted up entirely afresh.”\r\n\r\n“Did you observe anyone during the first act?” asked Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“In that box.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the countess, “it was certainly empty during the first\r\nact;” then, resuming the subject of their previous conversation, she\r\nsaid, “And so you really believe it was your mysterious Count of Monte\r\nCristo that gained the prize?”\r\n\r\n“I am sure of it.”\r\n\r\n“And who afterwards sent the cup to me?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t know him,” said the countess; “I have a great mind to\r\nreturn it.”\r\n\r\n“Do no such thing, I beg of you; he would only send you another, formed\r\nof a magnificent sapphire, or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby. It is\r\nhis way, and you must take him as you find him.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain\r\nfor the second act. Albert rose to return to his place.\r\n\r\n“Shall I see you again?” asked the countess.\r\n\r\n“At the end of the next act, with your permission, I will come and\r\ninquire whether there is anything I can do for you in Paris?”\r\n\r\n“Pray take notice,” said the countess, “that my present residence is 22\r\nRue de Rivoli, and that I am at home to my friends every Saturday\r\nevening. So now, you are both forewarned.”\r\n\r\nThe young men bowed, and quitted the box. Upon reaching their stalls,\r\nthey found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and\r\ndirecting their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the Russian\r\nambassador. A man of from thirty-five to forty years of age, dressed in\r\ndeep black, had just entered, accompanied by a young woman dressed\r\nafter the Eastern style. The lady was surpassingly beautiful, while the\r\nrich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her.\r\n\r\n“Hullo,” said Albert; “it is Monte Cristo and his Greek!”\r\n\r\nThe strangers were, indeed, no other than the count and Haydée. In a\r\nfew moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole\r\nhouse, and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize\r\nher magnificent diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe second act passed away during one continued buzz of voices—one deep\r\nwhisper—intimating that some great and universally interesting event\r\nhad occurred; all eyes, all thoughts, were occupied with the young and\r\nbeautiful woman, whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most\r\nextraordinary spectacle.\r\n\r\nUpon this occasion an unmistakable sign from Madame Danglars intimated\r\nher desire to see Albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the\r\nsecond act, and neither the politeness nor good taste of Morcerf would\r\npermit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given. At the\r\nclose of the act he therefore went to the baroness.\r\n\r\nHaving bowed to the two ladies, he extended his hand to Debray. By the\r\nbaroness he was most graciously welcomed, while Eugénie received him\r\nwith her accustomed coldness.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” said Debray, “you have come in the nick of time.\r\nThere is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count;\r\nshe insists upon it that I can tell her his birth, education, and\r\nparentage, where he came from, and whither he is going. Being no\r\ndisciple of Cagliostro, I was wholly unable to do this; so, by way of\r\ngetting out of the scrape, I said, ‘Ask Morcerf; he has got the whole\r\nhistory of his beloved Monte Cristo at his fingers’ ends;’ whereupon\r\nthe baroness signified her desire to see you.”\r\n\r\n“Is it not almost incredible,” said Madame Danglars, “that a person\r\nhaving at least half a million of secret-service money at his command,\r\nshould possess so little information?”\r\n\r\n“Let me assure you, madame,” said Lucien, “that had I really the sum\r\nyou mention at my disposal, I would employ it more profitably than in\r\ntroubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the Count of Monte\r\nCristo, whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich\r\nas a nabob. However, I have turned the business over to Morcerf, so\r\npray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you; for my own\r\npart, I care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings.”\r\n\r\n30093m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth\r\n32,000 francs, wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5,000\r\nfrancs each.”\r\n\r\n“He seems to have a mania for diamonds,” said Morcerf, smiling, “and I\r\nverily believe that, like Potemkin, he keeps his pockets filled, for\r\nthe sake of strewing them along the road, as Tom Thumb did his flint\r\nstones.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he has discovered some mine,” said Madame Danglars. “I suppose\r\nyou know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron’s banking\r\nestablishment?”\r\n\r\n“I was not aware of it,” replied Albert, “but I can readily believe\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“And, further, that he stated to M. Danglars his intention of only\r\nstaying a year in Paris, during which time he proposed to spend six\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\n“He must be the Shah of Persia, travelling _incog_.”\r\n\r\n“Have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman, M. Lucien?”\r\ninquired Eugénie.\r\n\r\n“I really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms\r\nof another as yourself,” responded Lucien, raising his lorgnette to his\r\neye. “A most lovely creature, upon my soul!” was his verdict.\r\n\r\n“Who is this young person, M. de Morcerf?” inquired Eugénie; “does\r\nanybody know?”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” said Albert, replying to this direct appeal, “I can\r\ngive you very exact information on that subject, as well as on most\r\npoints relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now\r\nconversing—the young woman is a Greek.”\r\n\r\n“So I should suppose by her dress; if you know no more than that,\r\neveryone here is as well-informed as yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a _cicerone_,” replied\r\nMorcerf, “but I am reluctantly obliged to confess, I have nothing\r\nfurther to communicate—yes, stay, I do know one thing more, namely,\r\nthat she is a musician, for one day when I chanced to be breakfasting\r\nwith the count, I heard the sound of a guzla—it is impossible that it\r\ncould have been touched by any other finger than her own.”\r\n\r\n“Then your count entertains visitors, does he?” asked Madame Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Indeed he does, and in a most lavish manner, I can assure you.”\r\n\r\n“I must try and persuade M. Danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner,\r\nor something of the sort, that he may be compelled to ask us in\r\nreturn.”\r\n\r\n“What,” said Debray, laughing; “do you really mean you would go to his\r\nhouse?”\r\n\r\n“Why not? my husband could accompany me.”\r\n\r\n“But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?”\r\n\r\n“You have ample proof to the contrary, if you look opposite,” said the\r\nbaroness, as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful Greek.\r\n\r\n“No, no!” exclaimed Debray; “that girl is not his wife: he told us\r\nhimself she was his slave. Do you not recollect, Morcerf, his telling\r\nus so at your breakfast?”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said the baroness, “if slave she be, she has all the air\r\nand manner of a princess.”\r\n\r\n“Of the ‘Arabian Nights’.”\r\n\r\n“If you like; but tell me, my dear Lucien, what it is that constitutes\r\na princess. Why, diamonds—and she is covered with them.”\r\n\r\n“To me she seems overloaded,” observed Eugénie; “she would look far\r\nbetter if she wore fewer, and we should then be able to see her finely\r\nformed throat and wrists.”\r\n\r\n“See how the artist peeps out!” exclaimed Madame Danglars. “My poor\r\nEugénie, you must conceal your passion for the fine arts.”\r\n\r\n“I admire all that is beautiful,” returned the young lady.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of the count?” inquired Debray; “he is not much\r\namiss, according to my ideas of good looks.”\r\n\r\n“The count,” repeated Eugénie, as though it had not occurred to her to\r\nobserve him sooner; “the count?—oh, he is so dreadfully pale.”\r\n\r\n“I quite agree with you,” said Morcerf; “and the secret of that very\r\npallor is what we want to find out. The Countess G—— insists upon it\r\nthat he is a vampire.”\r\n\r\n“Then the Countess G—— has returned to Paris, has she?” inquired the\r\nbaroness.\r\n\r\n“Is that she, mamma?” asked Eugénie; “almost opposite to us, with that\r\nprofusion of beautiful light hair?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Madame Danglars, “that is she. Shall I tell you what you\r\nought to do, Morcerf?”\r\n\r\n“Command me, madame.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, you should go and bring your Count of Monte Cristo to us.”\r\n\r\n“What for?” asked Eugénie.\r\n\r\n“What for? Why, to converse with him, of course. Have you really no\r\ndesire to meet him?”\r\n\r\n“None whatever,” replied Eugénie.\r\n\r\n“Strange child,” murmured the baroness.\r\n\r\n“He will very probably come of his own accord,” said Morcerf. “There;\r\ndo you see, madame, he recognizes you, and bows.”\r\n\r\nThe baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Morcerf, “I may as well be magnanimous, and tear myself\r\naway to forward your wishes. Adieu; I will go and try if there are any\r\nmeans of speaking to him.”\r\n\r\n“Go straight to his box; that will be the simplest plan.”\r\n\r\n“But I have never been presented.”\r\n\r\n“Presented to whom?”\r\n\r\n“To the beautiful Greek.”\r\n\r\n“You say she is only a slave?”\r\n\r\n“While you assert that she is a queen, or at least a princess. No; I\r\nhope that when he sees me leave you, he will come out.”\r\n\r\n“That is possible—go.”\r\n\r\n“I am going,” said Albert, as he made his parting bow.\r\n\r\nJust as he was passing the count’s box, the door opened, and Monte\r\nCristo came forth. After giving some directions to Ali, who stood in\r\nthe lobby, the count took Albert’s arm. Carefully closing the box door,\r\nAli placed himself before it, while a crowd of spectators assembled\r\nround the Nubian.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” said Monte Cristo, “Paris is a strange city, and the\r\nParisians a very singular people. See that cluster of persons collected\r\naround poor Ali, who is as much astonished as themselves; really one\r\nmight suppose he was the only Nubian they had ever beheld. Now I can\r\npromise you, that a Frenchman might show himself in public, either in\r\nTunis, Constantinople, Bagdad, or Cairo, without being treated in that\r\nway.”\r\n\r\n“That shows that the Eastern nations have too much good sense to waste\r\ntheir time and attention on objects undeserving of either. However, as\r\nfar as Ali is concerned, I can assure you, the interest he excites is\r\nmerely from the circumstance of his being your attendant—you, who are\r\nat this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in Paris.”\r\n\r\n“Really? and what has procured me so flattering a distinction?”\r\n\r\n“What? why, yourself, to be sure! You give away horses worth a thousand\r\nlouis; you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty; under the\r\nname of Major Black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not\r\nlarger than marmots; then, when you have carried off the golden trophy\r\nof victory, instead of setting any value on it, you give it to the\r\nfirst handsome woman you think of!”\r\n\r\n“And who has filled your head with all this nonsense?”\r\n\r\n“Why, in the first place, I heard it from Madame Danglars, who, by the\r\nby, is dying to see you in her box, or to have you seen there by\r\nothers; secondly, I learned it from Beauchamp’s journal; and thirdly,\r\nfrom my own imagination. Why, if you sought concealment, did you call\r\nyour horse Vampa?”\r\n\r\n“That was an oversight, certainly,” replied the count; “but tell me,\r\ndoes the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera? I have been looking\r\nfor him, but without success.”\r\n\r\n“He will be here tonight.”\r\n\r\n“In what part of the house?”\r\n\r\n“In the baroness’s box, I believe.”\r\n\r\n“That charming young woman with her is her daughter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I congratulate you.”\r\n\r\nMorcerf smiled.\r\n\r\n“We will discuss that subject at length some future time,” said he.\r\n“But what do you think of the music?”\r\n\r\n“What music?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the music you have been listening to.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is well enough as the production of a human composer, sung by\r\nfeatherless bipeds, to quote the late Diogenes.”\r\n\r\n“From which it would seem, my dear count, that you can at pleasure\r\nenjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of\r\nparadise?”\r\n\r\n30097m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You are right, in some degree; when I wish to listen to sounds more\r\nexquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to, I\r\ngo to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“Then sleep here, my dear count. The conditions are favorable; what\r\nelse was opera invented for?”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you. Your orchestra is too noisy. To sleep after the manner\r\nI speak of, absolute calm and silence are necessary, and then a certain\r\npreparation——”\r\n\r\n“I know—the famous hashish!”\r\n\r\n“Precisely. So, my dear viscount, whenever you wish to be regaled with\r\nmusic come and sup with me.”\r\n\r\n“I have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you,” said\r\nMorcerf.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean at Rome?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, then, I suppose you heard Haydée’s guzla; the poor exile\r\nfrequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her\r\nnative land.”\r\n\r\nMorcerf did not pursue the subject, and Monte Cristo himself fell into\r\na silent reverie.\r\n\r\nThe bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain.\r\n\r\n“You will excuse my leaving you,” said the count, turning in the\r\ndirection of his box.\r\n\r\n“What? Are you going?”\r\n\r\n“Pray, say everything that is kind to Countess G—— on the part of her\r\nfriend the vampire.”\r\n\r\n“And what message shall I convey to the baroness!”\r\n\r\n“That, with her permission, I shall do myself the honor of paying my\r\nrespects in the course of the evening.”\r\n\r\nThe third act had begun; and during its progress the Count of Morcerf,\r\naccording to his promise, made his appearance in the box of Madame\r\nDanglars. The Count of Morcerf was not a person to excite either\r\ninterest or curiosity in a place of public amusement; his presence,\r\ntherefore, was wholly unnoticed, save by the occupants of the box in\r\nwhich he had just seated himself.\r\n\r\nThe quick eye of Monte Cristo however, marked his coming; and a slight\r\nthough meaning smile passed over his lips. Haydée, whose soul seemed\r\ncentred in the business of the stage, like all unsophisticated natures,\r\ndelighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear.\r\n\r\n30099m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third act passed off as usual. Mesdemoiselles Noblet, Julia, and\r\nLeroux executed the customary pirouettes; Robert duly challenged the\r\nPrince of Granada; and the royal father of the princess Isabella,\r\ntaking his daughter by the hand, swept round the stage with majestic\r\nstrides, the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and\r\nmantle. After which the curtain again fell, and the spectators poured\r\nforth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon.\r\n\r\nThe count left his box, and a moment later was saluting the Baronne\r\nDanglars, who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n“You are welcome, count!” she exclaimed, as he entered. “I have been\r\nmost anxious to see you, that I might repeat orally the thanks writing\r\ncan so ill express.”\r\n\r\n“Surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your\r\nremembrance. Believe me, madame, I had entirely forgotten it.”\r\n\r\n“But it is not so easy to forget, monsieur, that the very next day\r\nafter your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend, Madame\r\nde Villefort, which was endangered by the very animals your generosity\r\nrestored to me.”\r\n\r\n30101m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“This time, at least, I do not deserve your thanks. It was Ali, my\r\nNubian slave, who rendered this service to Madame de Villefort.”\r\n\r\n“Was it Ali,” asked the Count of Morcerf, “who rescued my son from the\r\nhands of bandits?”\r\n\r\n“No, count,” replied Monte Cristo taking the hand held out to him by\r\nthe general; “in this instance I may fairly and freely accept your\r\nthanks; but you have already tendered them, and fully discharged your\r\ndebt—if indeed there existed one—and I feel almost mortified to find\r\nyou still reverting to the subject. May I beg of you, baroness, to\r\nhonor me with an introduction to your daughter?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are no stranger—at least not by name,” replied Madame\r\nDanglars, “and the last two or three days we have really talked of\r\nnothing but you. Eugénie,” continued the baroness, turning towards her\r\ndaughter, “this is the Count of Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\nThe count bowed, while Mademoiselle Danglars bent her head slightly.\r\n\r\n“You have a charming young person with you tonight, count,” said\r\nEugénie. “Is she your daughter?”\r\n\r\n“No, mademoiselle,” said Monte Cristo, astonished at the coolness and\r\nfreedom of the question. “She is a poor unfortunate Greek left under my\r\ncare.”\r\n\r\n“And what is her name?”\r\n\r\n“Haydée,” replied Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“A Greek?” murmured the Count of Morcerf.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, count,” said Madame Danglars; “and tell me, did you ever\r\nsee at the court of Ali Tepelini, whom you so gloriously and valiantly\r\nserved, a more exquisite beauty or richer costume?”\r\n\r\n“Did I hear rightly, monsieur,” said Monte Cristo “that you served at\r\nYanina?”\r\n\r\n“I was inspector-general of the pasha’s troops,” replied Morcerf; “and\r\nit is no secret that I owe my fortune, such as it is, to the liberality\r\nof the illustrious Albanese chief.”\r\n\r\n“But look!” exclaimed Madame Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Where?” stammered Morcerf.\r\n\r\n“There,” said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count, and\r\nleaning with him over the front of the box, just as Haydée, whose eyes\r\nwere occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian,\r\nperceived his pale features close to Morcerf’s face. It was as if the\r\nyoung girl beheld the head of Medusa. She bent forwards as though to\r\nassure herself of the reality of what she saw, then, uttering a faint\r\ncry, threw herself back in her seat. The sound was heard by the people\r\nabout Ali, who instantly opened the box-door.\r\n\r\n“Why, count,” exclaimed Eugénie, “what has happened to your ward? she\r\nseems to have been taken suddenly ill.\r\n\r\n“Very probably,” answered the count. “But do not be alarmed on her\r\naccount. Haydée’s nervous system is delicately organized, and she is\r\npeculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers—nay, there are some\r\nwhich cause her to faint if brought into her presence. However,”\r\ncontinued Monte Cristo, drawing a small phial from his pocket, “I have\r\nan infallible remedy.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he bowed to the baroness and her daughter, exchanged a\r\nparting shake of the hand with Debray and the count, and left Madame\r\nDanglars’ box. Upon his return to Haydée he found her still very pale.\r\nAs soon as she saw him she seized his hand; her own hands were moist\r\nand icy cold.\r\n\r\n“Who was it you were talking with over there?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“With the Count of Morcerf,” answered Monte Cristo. “He tells me he\r\nserved your illustrious father, and that he owes his fortune to him.”\r\n\r\n“Wretch!” exclaimed Haydée, her eyes flashing with rage; “he sold my\r\nfather to the Turks, and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his\r\ntreachery! Did not you know that, my dear lord?”\r\n\r\n“Something of this I heard in Epirus,” said Monte Cristo; “but the\r\nparticulars are still unknown to me. You shall relate them to me, my\r\nchild. They are, no doubt, both curious and interesting.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; but let us go. I feel as though it would kill me to remain\r\nlong near that dreadful man.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Haydée arose, and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white\r\ncashmere embroidered with pearls and coral, she hastily quitted the box\r\nat the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act.\r\n\r\n“Do you observe,” said the Countess G—— to Albert, who had returned to\r\nher side, “that man does nothing like other people; he listens most\r\ndevoutly to the third act of _Robert le Diable_, and when the fourth\r\nbegins, takes his departure.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 54. A Flurry in Stocks\r\n\r\nSome days after this meeting, Albert de Morcerf visited the Count of\r\nMonte Cristo at his house in the Champs-Élysées, which had already\r\nassumed that palace-like appearance which the count’s princely fortune\r\nenabled him to give even to his most temporary residences. He came to\r\nrenew the thanks of Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to\r\nthe count through the medium of a letter, signed “Baronne Danglars,\r\n_née_ Hermine de Servieux.”\r\n\r\nAlbert was accompanied by Lucien Debray, who, joining in his friend’s\r\nconversation, added some passing compliments, the source of which the\r\ncount’s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess. He was\r\nconvinced that Lucien’s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity,\r\nthe larger half of which sentiment emanated from the Rue de la Chaussée\r\nd’Antin. In short, Madame Danglars, not being able personally to\r\nexamine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a\r\nman who gave away horses worth 30,000 francs and who went to the opera\r\nwith a Greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of\r\nmoney, had deputed those eyes, by which she was accustomed to see, to\r\ngive her a faithful account of the mode of life of this\r\nincomprehensible person. But the count did not appear to suspect that\r\nthere could be the slightest connection between Lucien’s visit and the\r\ncuriosity of the baroness.\r\n\r\n“You are in constant communication with the Baron Danglars?” the count\r\ninquired of Albert de Morcerf.\r\n\r\n“Yes, count, you know what I told you?”\r\n\r\n“All remains the same, then, in that quarter?”\r\n\r\n“It is more than ever a settled thing,” said Lucien,—and, considering\r\nthat this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make,\r\nhe adjusted the glass to his eye, and biting the top of his gold headed\r\ncane, began to make the tour of the apartment, examining the arms and\r\nthe pictures.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Monte Cristo “I did not expect that the affair would be so\r\npromptly concluded.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, things take their course without our assistance. While we are\r\nforgetting them, they are falling into their appointed order; and when,\r\nagain, our attention is directed to them, we are surprised at the\r\nprogress they have made towards the proposed end. My father and M.\r\nDanglars served together in Spain, my father in the army and M.\r\nDanglars in the commissariat department. It was there that my father,\r\nruined by the revolution, and M. Danglars, who never had possessed any\r\npatrimony, both laid the foundations of their different fortunes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Monte Cristo “I think M. Danglars mentioned that in a visit\r\nwhich I paid him; and,” continued he, casting a side-glance at Lucien,\r\nwho was turning over the leaves of an album, “Mademoiselle Eugénie is\r\npretty—I think I remember that to be her name.”\r\n\r\n“Very pretty, or rather, very beautiful,” replied Albert, “but of that\r\nstyle of beauty which I do not appreciate; I am an ungrateful fellow.”\r\n\r\n“You speak as if you were already her husband.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” returned Albert, in his turn looking around to see what Lucien\r\nwas doing.\r\n\r\n“Really,” said Monte Cristo, lowering his voice, “you do not appear to\r\nme to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me,” replied Morcerf, “and that\r\nfrightens me.”\r\n\r\n“Bah,” exclaimed Monte Cristo, “that’s a fine reason to give. Are you\r\nnot rich yourself?”\r\n\r\n“My father’s income is about 50,000 francs per annum; and he will give\r\nme, perhaps, ten or twelve thousand when I marry.”\r\n\r\n“That, perhaps, might not be considered a large sum, in Paris\r\nespecially,” said the count; “but everything does not depend on wealth,\r\nand it is a fine thing to have a good name, and to occupy a high\r\nstation in society. Your name is celebrated, your position magnificent;\r\nand then the Comte de Morcerf is a soldier, and it is pleasing to see\r\nthe integrity of a Bayard united to the poverty of a Duguesclin;\r\ndisinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can\r\nshine. As for me, I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a\r\nmost suitable one; she will enrich you, and you will ennoble her.”\r\n\r\nAlbert shook his head, and looked thoughtful.\r\n\r\n“There is still something else,” said he.\r\n\r\n“I confess,” observed Monte Cristo, “that I have some difficulty in\r\ncomprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and\r\nbeautiful.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Morcerf, “this repugnance, if repugnance it may be called,\r\nis not all on my side.”\r\n\r\n“Whence can it arise, then? for you told me your father desired the\r\nmarriage.”\r\n\r\n“It is my mother who dissents; she has a clear and penetrating\r\njudgment, and does not smile on the proposed union. I cannot account\r\nfor it, but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the\r\nDanglars.”\r\n\r\n30107m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the count, in a somewhat forced tone, “that may be easily\r\nexplained; the Comtesse de Morcerf, who is aristocracy and refinement\r\nitself, does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with\r\none of ignoble birth; that is natural enough.”\r\n\r\n“I do not know if that is her reason,” said Albert, “but one thing I do\r\nknow, that if this marriage be consummated, it will render her quite\r\nmiserable. There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to\r\ntalk over and settle the affair; but I had such a sudden attack of\r\nindisposition——”\r\n\r\n“Real?” interrupted the count, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Oh, real enough, from anxiety doubtless,—at any rate they postponed\r\nthe matter for two months. There is no hurry, you know. I am not yet\r\ntwenty-one, and Eugénie is only seventeen; but the two months expire\r\nnext week. It must be done. My dear count, you cannot imagine how my\r\nmind is harassed. How happy you are in being exempt from all this!”\r\n\r\n“Well, and why should not you be free, too? What prevents you from\r\nbeing so?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it will be too great a disappointment to my father if I do not\r\nmarry Mademoiselle Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“Marry her then,” said the count, with a significant shrug of the\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Morcerf, “but that will plunge my mother into positive\r\ngrief.”\r\n\r\n“Then do not marry her,” said the count.\r\n\r\n“Well, I shall see. I will try and think over what is the best thing to\r\nbe done; you will give me your advice, will you not, and if possible\r\nextricate me from my unpleasant position? I think, rather than give\r\npain to my dear mother, I would run the risk of offending the count.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo turned away; he seemed moved by this last remark.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said he to Debray, who had thrown himself into an easy-chair at\r\nthe farthest extremity of the salon, and who held a pencil in his right\r\nhand and an account book in his left, “what are you doing there? Are\r\nyou making a sketch after Poussin?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” was the tranquil response; “I am too fond of art to attempt\r\nanything of that sort. I am doing a little sum in arithmetic.”\r\n\r\n“In arithmetic?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I am calculating—by the way, Morcerf, that indirectly concerns\r\nyou—I am calculating what the house of Danglars must have gained by the\r\nlast rise in Haiti bonds; from 206 they have risen to 409 in three\r\ndays, and the prudent banker had purchased at 206; therefore he must\r\nhave made 300,000 livres.”\r\n\r\n“That is not his biggest scoop,” said Morcerf; “did he not make a\r\nmillion in Spaniards this last year?”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” said Lucien, “here is the Count of Monte Cristo, who\r\nwill say to you, as the Italians do,—\r\n\r\n      “‘Denaro e santità,\r\n\r\n      Metà della metà.’9\r\n\r\n\r\n“When they tell me such things, I only shrug my shoulders and say\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\n“But you were speaking of Haitians?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Haitians,—that is quite another thing! Haitians are the _écarté_\r\nof French stock-jobbing. We may like bouillotte, delight in whist, be\r\nenraptured with boston, and yet grow tired of them all; but we always\r\ncome back to _écarté_—it is not only a game, it is a _hors-d’œuvre_! M.\r\nDanglars sold yesterday at 405, and pockets 300,000 francs. Had he but\r\nwaited till today, the price would have fallen to 205, and instead of\r\ngaining 300,000 francs, he would have lost 20 or 25,000.”\r\n\r\n“And what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206?” asked Monte\r\nCristo. “I am profoundly ignorant of all these stock-jobbing\r\nintrigues.”\r\n\r\n“Because,” said Albert, laughing, “one piece of news follows another,\r\nand there is often great dissimilarity between them.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the count, “I see that M. Danglars is accustomed to play at\r\ngaining or losing 300,000 francs in a day; he must be enormously rich.”\r\n\r\n“It is not he who plays!” exclaimed Lucien; “it is Madame Danglars; she\r\nis indeed daring.”\r\n\r\n“But you who are a reasonable being, Lucien, and who knows how little\r\ndependence is to be placed on the news, since you are at the\r\nfountain-head, surely you ought to prevent it,” said Morcerf, with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“How can I, if her husband fails in controlling her?” asked Lucien;\r\n“you know the character of the baroness—no one has any influence with\r\nher, and she does precisely what she pleases.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, if I were in your place——” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I would reform her; it would be rendering a service to her future\r\nson-in-law.”\r\n\r\n“How would you set about it?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that would be easy enough—I would give her a lesson.”\r\n\r\n“A lesson?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority\r\ngreat on the subject of political news; you never open your mouth but\r\nthe stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words. Cause her to lose a\r\nhundred thousand francs, and that would teach her prudence.”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand,” stammered Lucien.\r\n\r\n“It is very clear, notwithstanding,” replied the young man, with an\r\nartlessness wholly free from affectation; “tell her some fine morning\r\nan unheard-of piece of intelligence—some telegraphic despatch, of which\r\nyou alone are in possession; for instance, that Henri IV. was seen\r\nyesterday at Gabrielle’s. That would boom the market; she will buy\r\nheavily, and she will certainly lose when Beauchamp announces the\r\nfollowing day, in his gazette, ‘The report circulated by some usually\r\nwell-informed persons that the king was seen yesterday at Gabrielle’s\r\nhouse, is totally without foundation. We can positively assert that his\r\nmajesty did not quit the Pont-Neuf.’”\r\n\r\nLucien half smiled. Monte Cristo, although apparently indifferent, had\r\nnot lost one word of this conversation, and his penetrating eye had\r\neven read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary.\r\nThis embarrassment had completely escaped Albert, but it caused Lucien\r\nto shorten his visit; he was evidently ill at ease. The count, in\r\ntaking leave of him, said something in a low voice, to which he\r\nanswered, “Willingly, count; I accept.” The count returned to young\r\nMorcerf.\r\n\r\n“Do you not think, on reflection,” said he to him, “that you have done\r\nwrong in thus speaking of your mother-in-law in the presence of M.\r\nDebray?”\r\n\r\n“My dear count,” said Morcerf, “I beg of you not to apply that title so\r\nprematurely.”\r\n\r\n“Now, speaking without any exaggeration, is your mother really so very\r\nmuch averse to this marriage?”\r\n\r\n“So much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house, and my\r\nmother, has not, I think, visited Madame Danglars twice in her whole\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said the count, “I am emboldened to speak openly to you. M.\r\nDanglars is my banker; M. de Villefort has overwhelmed me with\r\npoliteness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune\r\nenabled me to render him. I predict from all this an avalanche of\r\ndinners and routs. Now, in order not to presume on this, and also to be\r\nbeforehand with them, I have, if agreeable to you, thought of inviting\r\nM. and Madame Danglars, and M. and Madame de Villefort, to my\r\ncountry-house at Auteuil. If I were to invite you and the Count and\r\nCountess of Morcerf to this dinner, I should give it the appearance of\r\nbeing a matrimonial meeting, or at least Madame de Morcerf would look\r\nupon the affair in that light, especially if Baron Danglars did me the\r\nhonor to bring his daughter. In that case your mother would hold me in\r\naversion, and I do not at all wish that; on the contrary, I desire to\r\nstand high in her esteem.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, count,” said Morcerf, “I thank you sincerely for having used\r\nso much candor towards me, and I gratefully accept the exclusion which\r\nyou propose. You say you desire my mother’s good opinion; I assure you\r\nit is already yours to a very unusual extent.”\r\n\r\n30111m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?” said Monte Cristo, with interest.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am sure of it; we talked of you an hour after you left us the\r\nother day. But to return to what we were saying. If my mother could\r\nknow of this attention on your part—and I will venture to tell her—I am\r\nsure that she will be most grateful to you; it is true that my father\r\nwill be equally angry.” The count laughed.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he to Morcerf, “but I think your father will not be the\r\nonly angry one; M. and Madame Danglars will think me a very\r\nill-mannered person. They know that I am intimate with you—that you\r\nare, in fact; one of the oldest of my Parisian acquaintances—and they\r\nwill not find you at my house; they will certainly ask me why I did not\r\ninvite you. Be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement\r\nwhich shall have a semblance of probability, and communicate the fact\r\nto me by a line in writing. You know that with bankers nothing but a\r\nwritten document will be valid.”\r\n\r\n“I will do better than that,” said Albert; “my mother is wishing to go\r\nto the sea-side—what day is fixed for your dinner?”\r\n\r\n“Saturday.”\r\n\r\n“This is Tuesday—well, tomorrow evening we leave, and the day after we\r\nshall be at Tréport. Really, count, you have a delightful way of\r\nsetting people at their ease.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, you give me more credit than I deserve; I only wish to do what\r\nwill be agreeable to you, that is all.”\r\n\r\n“When shall you send your invitations?”\r\n\r\n“This very day.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will immediately call on M. Danglars, and tell him that my\r\nmother and myself must leave Paris tomorrow. I have not seen you,\r\nconsequently I know nothing of your dinner.”\r\n\r\n“How foolish you are! Have you forgotten that M. Debray has just seen\r\nyou at my house?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, true.”\r\n\r\n“Fix it this way. I have seen you, and invited you without any\r\nceremony, when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for\r\nyou to accept, as you were going to Tréport.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, that is settled; but you will come and call on my mother\r\nbefore tomorrow?”\r\n\r\n“Before tomorrow?—that will be a difficult matter to arrange, besides,\r\nI shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you can do better. You were only a charming man before, but, if\r\nyou accede to my proposal, you will be adorable.”\r\n\r\n“What must I do to attain such sublimity?”\r\n\r\n“You are today free as air—come and dine with me; we shall be a small\r\nparty—only yourself, my mother, and I. You have scarcely seen my\r\nmother; you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely.\r\nShe is a remarkable woman, and I only regret that there does not exist\r\nanother like her, about twenty years younger; in that case, I assure\r\nyou, there would very soon be a Countess and Viscountess of Morcerf. As\r\nto my father, you will not see him; he is officially engaged, and dines\r\nwith the chief referendary. We will talk over our travels; and you, who\r\nhave seen the whole world, will relate your adventures—you shall tell\r\nus the history of the beautiful Greek who was with you the other night\r\nat the Opera, and whom you call your slave, and yet treat like a\r\nprincess. We will talk Italian and Spanish. Come, accept my invitation,\r\nand my mother will thank you.”\r\n\r\n“A thousand thanks,” said the count, “your invitation is most gracious,\r\nand I regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it. I am\r\nnot so much at liberty as you suppose; on the contrary, I have a most\r\nimportant engagement.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, take care, you were teaching me just now how, in case of an\r\ninvitation to dinner, one might creditably make an excuse. I require\r\nthe proof of a pre-engagement. I am not a banker, like M. Danglars, but\r\nI am quite as incredulous as he is.”\r\n\r\n“I am going to give you a proof,” replied the count, and he rang the\r\nbell.\r\n\r\n“Humph,” said Morcerf, “this is the second time you have refused to\r\ndine with my mother; it is evident that you wish to avoid her.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo started. “Oh, you do not mean that,” said he; “besides,\r\nhere comes the confirmation of my assertion.”\r\n\r\nBaptistin entered, and remained standing at the door.\r\n\r\n“I had no previous knowledge of your visit, had I?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, you are such an extraordinary person, that I would not answer\r\nfor it.”\r\n\r\n“At all events, I could not guess that you would invite me to dinner.”\r\n\r\n“Probably not.”\r\n\r\n“Well, listen, Baptistin, what did I tell you this morning when I\r\ncalled you into my laboratory?”\r\n\r\n“To close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five,”\r\nreplied the valet.\r\n\r\n“What then?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear count,” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“No, no, I wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you\r\nhave given me, my dear viscount; it is tiresome to be always acting\r\nManfred. I wish my life to be free and open. Go on, Baptistin.”\r\n\r\n“Then to admit no one except Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and his son.”\r\n\r\n“You hear—Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti—a man who ranks amongst the most\r\nancient nobility of Italy, whose name Dante has celebrated in the tenth\r\ncanto of _The Inferno_, you remember it, do you not? Then there is his\r\nson, Andrea, a charming young man, about your own age, viscount,\r\nbearing the same title as yourself, and who is making his entry into\r\nthe Parisian world, aided by his father’s millions. The major will\r\nbring his son with him this evening, the _contino_, as we say in Italy;\r\nhe confides him to my care. If he proves himself worthy of it, I will\r\ndo what I can to advance his interests. You will assist me in the work,\r\nwill you not?”\r\n\r\n“Most undoubtedly. This Major Cavalcanti is an old friend of yours,\r\nthen?”\r\n\r\n“By no means. He is a perfect nobleman, very polite, modest, and\r\nagreeable, such as may be found constantly in Italy, descendants of\r\nvery ancient families. I have met him several times at Florence,\r\nBologna and Lucca, and he has now communicated to me the fact of his\r\narrival in Paris. The acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort\r\nof claim on one; they everywhere expect to receive the same attention\r\nwhich you once paid them by chance, as though the civilities of a\r\npassing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the\r\nman in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your\r\njourney. This good Major Cavalcanti is come to take a second view of\r\nParis, which he only saw in passing through in the time of the Empire,\r\nwhen he was on his way to Moscow. I shall give him a good dinner, he\r\nwill confide his son to my care, I will promise to watch over him, I\r\nshall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him, and then\r\nI shall have done my part.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; I see you are a model Mentor,” said Albert “Good-bye, we\r\nshall return on Sunday. By the way, I have received news of Franz.”\r\n\r\n“Have you? Is he still amusing himself in Italy?”\r\n\r\n“I believe so; however, he regrets your absence extremely. He says you\r\nwere the sun of Rome, and that without you all appears dark and cloudy;\r\nI do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains.”\r\n\r\n“His opinion of me is altered for the better, then?”\r\n\r\n“No, he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible\r\nand mysterious of beings.”\r\n\r\n“He is a charming young man,” said Monte Cristo “and I felt a lively\r\ninterest in him the very first evening of my introduction, when I met\r\nhim in search of a supper, and prevailed upon him to accept a portion\r\nof mine. He is, I think, the son of General d’Épinay?”\r\n\r\n“He is.”\r\n\r\n“The same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815?”\r\n\r\n“By the Bonapartists.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Really I like him extremely; is there not also a matrimonial\r\nengagement contemplated for him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he is to marry Mademoiselle de Villefort.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\n30115m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“And you know I am to marry Mademoiselle Danglars,” said Albert,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n“You smile.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you do so?”\r\n\r\n“I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination\r\nfor the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my\r\nown. But really, my dear count, we are talking as much of women as they\r\ndo of us; it is unpardonable.”\r\n\r\nAlbert rose.\r\n\r\n“Are you going?”\r\n\r\n“Really, that is a good idea!—two hours have I been boring you to death\r\nwith my company, and then you, with the greatest politeness, ask me if\r\nI am going. Indeed, count, you are the most polished man in the world.\r\nAnd your servants, too, how very well behaved they are; there is quite\r\na style about them. Monsieur Baptistin especially; I could never get\r\nsuch a man as that. My servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see\r\nin a play, who, because they have only a word or two to say, aquit\r\nthemselves in the most awkward manner possible. Therefore, if you part\r\nwith M. Baptistin, give me the refusal of him.”\r\n\r\n“By all means.”\r\n\r\n“That is not all; give my compliments to your illustrious Luccanese,\r\nCavalcante of the Cavalcanti; and if by any chance he should be wishing\r\nto establish his son, find him a wife very rich, very noble on her\r\nmother’s side at least, and a baroness in right of her father, I will\r\nhelp you in the search.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, ha; you will do as much as that, will you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, really, nothing is certain in this world.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, count, what a service you might render me! I should like you a\r\nhundred times better if, by your intervention, I could manage to remain\r\na bachelor, even were it only for ten years.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is impossible,” gravely replied Monte Cristo; and taking leave\r\nof Albert, he returned into the house, and struck the gong three times.\r\nBertuccio appeared.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Bertuccio, you understand that I intend entertaining company\r\non Saturday at Auteuil.” Bertuccio slightly started. “I shall require\r\nyour services to see that all be properly arranged. It is a beautiful\r\nhouse, or at all events may be made so.”\r\n\r\n“There must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title, your\r\nexcellency, for the tapestried hangings are very old.”\r\n\r\n“Let them all be taken away and changed, then, with the exception of\r\nthe sleeping-chamber which is hung with red damask; you will leave that\r\nexactly as it is.” Bertuccio bowed. “You will not touch the garden\r\neither; as to the yard, you may do what you please with it; I should\r\nprefer that being altered beyond all recognition.”\r\n\r\n“I will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes, your\r\nexcellency. I should be glad, however, to receive your excellency’s\r\ncommands concerning the dinner.”\r\n\r\n“Really, my dear M. Bertuccio,” said the count, “since you have been in\r\nParis, you have become quite nervous, and apparently out of your\r\nelement; you no longer seem to understand me.”\r\n\r\n“But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you\r\nare expecting to receive?”\r\n\r\n“I do not yet know myself, neither is it necessary that you should do\r\nso. ‘Lucullus dines with Lucullus,’ that is quite sufficient.”\r\n\r\nBertuccio bowed, and left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 55. Major Cavalcanti\r\n\r\nBoth the count and Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to\r\nMorcerf the proposed visit of the major, which had served Monte Cristo\r\nas a pretext for declining Albert’s invitation. Seven o’clock had just\r\nstruck, and M. Bertuccio, according to the command which had been given\r\nhim, had two hours before left for Auteuil, when a cab stopped at the\r\ndoor, and after depositing its occupant at the gate, immediately\r\nhurried away, as if ashamed of its employment. The visitor was about\r\nfifty-two years of age, dressed in one of the green surtouts,\r\nornamented with black frogs, which have so long maintained their\r\npopularity all over Europe. He wore trousers of blue cloth, boots\r\ntolerably clean, but not of the brightest polish, and a little too\r\nthick in the soles, buckskin gloves, a hat somewhat resembling in shape\r\nthose usually worn by the gendarmes, and a black cravat striped with\r\nwhite, which, if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will,\r\nmight have passed for a halter, so much did it resemble one. Such was\r\nthe picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate, and\r\ndemanded if it was not at No. 30 in the Avenue des Champs-Élysées that\r\nthe Count of Monte Cristo lived, and who, being answered by the porter\r\nin the affirmative, entered, closed the gate after him, and began to\r\nascend the steps.\r\n\r\nThe small and angular head of this man, his white hair and thick gray\r\nmoustaches, caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin, who had\r\nreceived an exact description of the expected visitor, and who was\r\nawaiting him in the hall. Therefore, scarcely had the stranger time to\r\npronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival. He was\r\nushered into a simple and elegant drawing-room, and the count rose to\r\nmeet him with a smiling air.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear sir, you are most welcome; I was expecting you.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said the Italian, “was your excellency then aware of my\r\nvisit?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I had been told that I should see you today at seven o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Then you have received full information concerning my arrival?”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, so much the better, I feared this little precaution might have\r\nbeen forgotten.”\r\n\r\n30119m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What precaution?”\r\n\r\n“That of informing you beforehand of my coming.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, it has not.”\r\n\r\n“But you are sure you are not mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“Very sure.”\r\n\r\n“It really was I whom your excellency expected at seven o’clock this\r\nevening?”\r\n\r\n“I will prove it to you beyond a doubt.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, never mind that,” said the Italian; “it is not worth the\r\ntrouble.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” said Monte Cristo. His visitor appeared slightly uneasy.\r\n“Let me see,” said the count; “are you not the Marquis Bartolomeo\r\nCavalcanti?”\r\n\r\n“Bartolomeo Cavalcanti,” joyfully replied the Italian; “yes, I am\r\nreally he.”\r\n\r\n“Ex-major in the Austrian service?”\r\n\r\n“Was I a major?” timidly asked the old soldier.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Monte Cristo “you were a major; that is the title the\r\nFrench give to the post which you filled in Italy.”\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said the major, “I do not demand more, you understand——”\r\n\r\n“Your visit here today is not of your own suggestion, is it?” said\r\nMonte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“No, certainly not.”\r\n\r\n“You were sent by some other person?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“By the excellent Abbé Busoni?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so,” said the delighted major.\r\n\r\n“And you have a letter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there it is.”\r\n\r\n“Give it to me, then.” And Monte Cristo took the letter, which he\r\nopened and read. The major looked at the count with his large staring\r\neyes, and then took a survey of the apartment, but his gaze almost\r\nimmediately reverted to the proprietor of the room.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I see. ‘Major Cavalcanti, a worthy patrician of Lucca, a\r\ndescendant of the Cavalcanti of Florence,’” continued Monte Cristo,\r\nreading aloud, “‘possessing an income of half a million.’”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo raised his eyes from the paper, and bowed.\r\n\r\n“Half a million,” said he, “magnificent!”\r\n\r\n“Half a million, is it?” said the major.\r\n\r\n“Yes, in so many words; and it must be so, for the abbé knows correctly\r\nthe amount of all the largest fortunes in Europe.”\r\n\r\n“Be it half a million, then; but on my word of honor, I had no idea\r\nthat it was so much.”\r\n\r\n“Because you are robbed by your steward. You must make some reformation\r\nin that quarter.”\r\n\r\n“You have opened my eyes,” said the Italian gravely; “I will show the\r\ngentlemen the door.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo resumed the perusal of the letter:\r\n\r\n“‘And who only needs one thing more to make him happy.’”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed but one!” said the major with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“‘Which is to recover a lost and adored son.’”\r\n\r\n“A lost and adored son!”\r\n\r\n“‘Stolen away in his infancy, either by an enemy of his noble family or\r\nby the gypsies.’”\r\n\r\n“At the age of five years!” said the major with a deep sigh, and\r\nraising his eye to heaven.\r\n\r\n“Unhappy father,” said Monte Cristo. The count continued:\r\n\r\n“‘I have given him renewed life and hope, in the assurance that you\r\nhave the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for\r\nfifteen years.’”\r\n\r\nThe major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n“I have the power of so doing,” said Monte Cristo. The major recovered\r\nhis self-possession.\r\n\r\n“So, then,” said he, “the letter was true to the end?”\r\n\r\n“Did you doubt it, my dear Monsieur Bartolomeo?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed; certainly not; a good man, a man holding religious office,\r\nas does the Abbé Busoni, could not condescend to deceive or play off a\r\njoke; but your excellency has not read all.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, true,” said Monte Cristo “there is a postscript.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” repeated the major, “yes—there—is—a—postscript.”\r\n\r\n“‘In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his\r\nbanker, I send him a draft for 2,000 francs to defray his travelling\r\nexpenses, and credit on you for the further sum of 48,000 francs, which\r\nyou still owe me.’”\r\n\r\nThe major awaited the conclusion of the postscript, apparently with\r\ngreat anxiety.\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said the count.\r\n\r\n“He said ‘very good,’” muttered the major, “then—sir——” replied he.\r\n\r\n“Then what?” asked Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Then the postscript——”\r\n\r\n“Well; what of the postscript?”\r\n\r\n“Then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the\r\nletter?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; the Abbé Busoni and myself have a small account open\r\nbetween us. I do not remember if it is exactly 48,000 francs, which I\r\nam still owing him, but I dare say we shall not dispute the difference.\r\nYou attached great importance, then, to this postscript, my dear\r\nMonsieur Cavalcanti?”\r\n\r\n“I must explain to you,” said the major, “that, fully confiding in the\r\nsignature of the Abbé Busoni, I had not provided myself with any other\r\nfunds; so that if this resource had failed me, I should have found\r\nmyself very unpleasantly situated in Paris.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed\r\nanywhere?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Why, really I know no one,” said the major.\r\n\r\n“But then you yourself are known to others?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am known, so that——”\r\n\r\n“Proceed, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti.”\r\n\r\n“So that you will remit to me these 48,000 francs?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, at your first request.” The major’s eyes dilated with\r\npleasing astonishment. “But sit down,” said Monte Cristo; “really I do\r\nnot know what I have been thinking of—I have positively kept you\r\nstanding for the last quarter of an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t mention it.” The major drew an armchair towards him, and\r\nproceeded to seat himself.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the count, “what will you take—a glass of sherry, port, or\r\nAlicante?”\r\n\r\n“Alicante, if you please; it is my favorite wine.”\r\n\r\n“I have some that is very good. You will take a biscuit with it, will\r\nyou not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will take a biscuit, as you are so obliging.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo rang; Baptistin appeared. The count advanced to meet him.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said he in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“The young man is here,” said the valet de chambre in the same tone.\r\n\r\n“Into what room did you take him?”\r\n\r\n“Into the blue drawing-room, according to your excellency’s orders.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right; now bring the Alicante and some biscuits.”\r\n\r\nBaptistin left the room.\r\n\r\n“Really,” said the major, “I am quite ashamed of the trouble I am\r\ngiving you.”\r\n\r\n“Pray don’t mention such a thing,” said the count. Baptistin re-entered\r\nwith glasses, wine, and biscuits. The count filled one glass, but in\r\nthe other he only poured a few drops of the ruby-colored liquid. The\r\nbottle was covered with spiders’ webs, and all the other signs which\r\nindicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a man’s face.\r\nThe major made a wise choice; he took the full glass and a biscuit. The\r\ncount told Baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest, who\r\nbegan by sipping the Alicante with an expression of great satisfaction,\r\nand then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine.\r\n\r\n30123m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“So, sir, you lived at Lucca, did you? You were rich, noble, held in\r\ngreat esteem—had all that could render a man happy?”\r\n\r\n“All,” said the major, hastily swallowing his biscuit, “positively\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your\r\nhappiness?”\r\n\r\n“Only one thing,” said the Italian.\r\n\r\n“And that one thing, your lost child.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the major, taking a second biscuit, “that consummation of my\r\nhappiness was indeed wanting.” The worthy major raised his eyes to\r\nheaven and sighed.\r\n\r\n“Let me hear, then,” said the count, “who this deeply regretted son\r\nwas; for I always understood you were a bachelor.”\r\n\r\n“That was the general opinion, sir,” said the major, “and I——”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the count, “and you confirmed the report. A youthful\r\nindiscretion, I suppose, which you were anxious to conceal from the\r\nworld at large?”\r\n\r\nThe major recovered himself, and resumed his usual calm manner, at the\r\nsame time casting his eyes down, either to give himself time to compose\r\nhis countenance, or to assist his imagination, all the while giving an\r\nunder-look at the count, the protracted smile on whose lips still\r\nannounced the same polite curiosity.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the major, “I did wish this fault to be hidden from every\r\neye.”\r\n\r\n“Not on your own account, surely,” replied Monte Cristo; “for a man is\r\nabove that sort of thing?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, certainly not on my own account,” said the major with a smile\r\nand a shake of the head.\r\n\r\n“But for the sake of the mother?” said the count.\r\n\r\n“Yes, for the mother’s sake—his poor mother!” cried the major, taking a\r\nthird biscuit.\r\n\r\n“Take some more wine, my dear Cavalcanti,” said the count, pouring out\r\nfor him a second glass of Alicante; “your emotion has quite overcome\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“His poor mother,” murmured the major, trying to get the lachrymal\r\ngland in operation, so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false\r\ntear.\r\n\r\n“She belonged to one of the first families in Italy, I think, did she\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“She was of a noble family of Fiesole, count.”\r\n\r\n“And her name was——”\r\n\r\n“Do you desire to know her name——?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Monte Cristo “it would be quite superfluous for you to tell\r\nme, for I already know it.”\r\n\r\n“The count knows everything,” said the Italian, bowing.\r\n\r\n“Oliva Corsinari, was it not?”\r\n\r\n“Oliva Corsinari!”\r\n\r\n“A marchioness?”\r\n\r\n“A marchioness!”\r\n\r\n“And you married her at last, notwithstanding the opposition of her\r\nfamily?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that was the way it ended.”\r\n\r\n“And you have doubtless brought all your papers with you?” said Monte\r\nCristo.\r\n\r\n“What papers?”\r\n\r\n“The certificate of your marriage with Oliva Corsinari, and the\r\nregister of your child’s birth.”\r\n\r\n“The register of my child’s birth?”\r\n\r\n“The register of the birth of Andrea Cavalcanti—of your son; is not his\r\nname Andrea?”\r\n\r\n“I believe so,” said the major.\r\n\r\n“What? You believe so?”\r\n\r\n“I dare not positively assert it, as he has been lost for so long a\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Monte Cristo “you have all the documents with you?”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency, I regret to say that, not knowing it was necessary to\r\ncome provided with these papers, I neglected to bring them.”\r\n\r\n“That is unfortunate,” returned Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Were they, then, so necessary?”\r\n\r\n“They were indispensable.”\r\n\r\nThe major passed his hand across his brow. “Ah, _perbacco_,\r\nindispensable, were they?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly they were; supposing there were to be doubts raised as to\r\nthe validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child?”\r\n\r\n“True,” said the major, “there might be doubts raised.”\r\n\r\n“In that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated.”\r\n\r\n“It would be fatal to his interests.”\r\n\r\n“It might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance.”\r\n\r\n“_O peccato!_”\r\n\r\n“You must know that in France they are very particular on these points;\r\nit is not sufficient, as in Italy, to go to the priest and say, ‘We\r\nlove each other, and want you to marry us.’ Marriage is a civil affair\r\nin France, and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have\r\npapers which undeniably establish your identity.”\r\n\r\n“That is the misfortune! You see I have not these necessary papers.”\r\n\r\n“Fortunately, I have them, though,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“You?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You have them?”\r\n\r\n“I have them.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed?” said the major, who, seeing the object of his journey\r\nfrustrated by the absence of the papers, feared also that his\r\nforgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48,000\r\nfrancs—“ah, indeed, that is a fortunate circumstance; yes, that really\r\nis lucky, for it never occurred to me to bring them.”\r\n\r\n“I do not at all wonder at it—one cannot think of everything; but,\r\nhappily, the Abbé Busoni thought for you.”\r\n\r\n“He is an excellent person.”\r\n\r\n“He is extremely prudent and thoughtful.”\r\n\r\n“He is an admirable man,” said the major; “and he sent them to you?”\r\n\r\n“Here they are.”\r\n\r\nThe major clasped his hands in token of admiration.\r\n\r\n“You married Oliva Corsinari in the church of San Paolo del\r\nMonte-Cattini; here is the priest’s certificate.”\r\n\r\n“Yes indeed, there it is truly,” said the Italian, looking on with\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n“And here is Andrea Cavalcanti’s baptismal register, given by the curé\r\nof Saravezza.”\r\n\r\n“All quite correct.”\r\n\r\n“Take these documents, then; they do not concern me. You will give them\r\nto your son, who will, of course, take great care of them.”\r\n\r\n“I should think so, indeed! If he were to lose them——”\r\n\r\n“Well, and if he were to lose them?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“In that case,” replied the major, “it would be necessary to write to\r\nthe curé for duplicates, and it would be some time before they could be\r\nobtained.”\r\n\r\n“It would be a difficult matter to arrange,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Almost an impossibility,” replied the major.\r\n\r\n“I am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers.”\r\n\r\n“I regard them as invaluable.”\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Monte Cristo “as to the mother of the young man——”\r\n\r\n“As to the mother of the young man——” repeated the Italian, with\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n“As regards the Marchesa Corsinari——”\r\n\r\n“Really,” said the major, “difficulties seem to thicken upon us; will\r\nshe be wanted in any way?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” replied Monte Cristo; “besides, has she not——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” said the major, “she has——”\r\n\r\n30127m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Paid the last debt of nature?”\r\n\r\n“Alas, yes,” returned the Italian.\r\n\r\n“I knew that,” said Monte Cristo; “she has been dead these ten years.”\r\n\r\n“And I am still mourning her loss,” exclaimed the major, drawing from\r\nhis pocket a checked handkerchief, and alternately wiping first the\r\nleft and then the right eye.\r\n\r\n“What would you have?” said Monte Cristo; “we are all mortal. Now, you\r\nunderstand, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti, that it is useless for you to\r\ntell people in France that you have been separated from your son for\r\nfifteen years. Stories of gypsies, who steal children, are not at all\r\nin vogue in this part of the world, and would not be believed. You sent\r\nhim for his education to a college in one of the provinces, and now you\r\nwish him to complete his education in the Parisian world. That is the\r\nreason which has induced you to leave Via Reggio, where you have lived\r\nsince the death of your wife. That will be sufficient.”\r\n\r\n“You think so?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then.”\r\n\r\n“If they should hear of the separation——”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes; what could I say?”\r\n\r\n“That an unfaithful tutor, bought over by the enemies of your family——”\r\n\r\n“By the Corsinari?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely. Had stolen away this child, in order that your name might\r\nbecome extinct.”\r\n\r\n“That is reasonable, since he is an only son.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now that all is arranged, do not let these newly awakened\r\nremembrances be forgotten. You have, doubtless, already guessed that I\r\nwas preparing a surprise for you?”\r\n\r\n“An agreeable one?” asked the Italian.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his\r\nheart.”\r\n\r\n“Hum!” said the major.\r\n\r\n“Someone has told you the secret; or, perhaps, you guessed that he was\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“That who was here?”\r\n\r\n“Your child—your son—your Andrea!”\r\n\r\n“I did guess it,” replied the major with the greatest possible\r\ncoolness. “Then he is here?”\r\n\r\n“He is,” said Monte Cristo; “when the valet de chambre came in just\r\nnow, he told me of his arrival.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, very well, very well,” said the major, clutching the buttons of\r\nhis coat at each exclamation.\r\n\r\n“My dear sir,” said Monte Cristo, “I understand your emotion; you must\r\nhave time to recover yourself. I will, in the meantime, go and prepare\r\nthe young man for this much-desired interview, for I presume that he is\r\nnot less impatient for it than yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I should quite imagine that to be the case,” said Cavalcanti.\r\n\r\n“Well, in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you.”\r\n\r\n“You will bring him, then? You carry your goodness so far as even to\r\npresent him to me yourself?”\r\n\r\n“No; I do not wish to come between a father and son. Your interview\r\nwill be private. But do not be uneasy; even if the powerful voice of\r\nnature should be silent, you cannot well mistake him; he will enter by\r\nthis door. He is a fine young man, of fair complexion—a little too\r\nfair, perhaps—pleasing in manners; but you will see and judge for\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“By the way,” said the major, “you know I have only the 2,000 francs\r\nwhich the Abbé Busoni sent me; this sum I have expended upon travelling\r\nexpenses, and——”\r\n\r\n“And you want money; that is a matter of course, my dear M. Cavalcanti.\r\nWell, here are 8,000 francs on account.”\r\n\r\nThe major’s eyes sparkled brilliantly.\r\n\r\n“It is 40,000 francs which I now owe you,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Does your excellency wish for a receipt?” said the major, at the same\r\ntime slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat.\r\n\r\n“For what?” said the count.\r\n\r\n“I thought you might want it to show the Abbé Busoni.”\r\n\r\n“Well, when you receive the remaining 40,000, you shall give me a\r\nreceipt in full. Between honest men such excessive precaution is, I\r\nthink, quite unnecessary.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, so it is, between perfectly upright people.”\r\n\r\n“One word more,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Say on.”\r\n\r\n“You will permit me to make one remark?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; pray do so.”\r\n\r\n“Then I should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said the major, regarding himself with an air of complete\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n“Yes. It may be worn at Via Reggio; but that costume, however elegant\r\nin itself, has long been out of fashion in Paris.”\r\n\r\n“That’s unfortunate.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you really are attached to your old mode of dress; you can\r\neasily resume it when you leave Paris.”\r\n\r\n“But what shall I wear?”\r\n\r\n“What you find in your trunks.”\r\n\r\n“In my trunks? I have but one portmanteau.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say you have nothing else with you. What is the use of boring\r\none’s self with so many things? Besides an old soldier always likes to\r\nmarch with as little baggage as possible.”\r\n\r\n“That is just the case—precisely so.”\r\n\r\n“But you are a man of foresight and prudence, therefore you sent your\r\nluggage on before you. It has arrived at the Hôtel des Princes, Rue de\r\nRichelieu. It is there you are to take up your quarters.”\r\n\r\n“Then, in these trunks——”\r\n\r\n“I presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all\r\nyou are likely to need,—your plain clothes and your uniform. On grand\r\noccasions you must wear your uniform; that will look very well. Do not\r\nforget your crosses. They still laugh at them in France, and yet always\r\nwear them, for all that.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, very well,” said the major, who was in ecstasy at the\r\nattention paid him by the count.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Monte Cristo, “that you have fortified yourself against all\r\npainful excitement, prepare yourself, my dear M. Cavalcanti, to meet\r\nyour lost Andrea.”\r\n\r\nSaying which Monte Cristo bowed, and disappeared behind the tapestry,\r\nleaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful\r\nreception which he had received at the hands of the count.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 56. Andrea Cavalcanti\r\n\r\nThe Count of Monte Cristo entered the adjoining room, which Baptistin\r\nhad designated as the drawing-room, and found there a young man, of\r\ngraceful demeanor and elegant appearance, who had arrived in a cab\r\nabout half an hour previously. Baptistin had not found any difficulty\r\nin recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for\r\nadmittance. He was certainly the tall young man with light hair, red\r\nbeard, black eyes, and brilliant complexion, whom his master had so\r\nparticularly described to him. When the count entered the room the\r\nyoung man was carelessly stretched on a sofa, tapping his boot with the\r\ngold-headed cane which he held in his hand. On perceiving the count he\r\nrose quickly.\r\n\r\n“The Count of Monte Cristo, I believe?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, and I think I have the honor of addressing Count Andrea\r\nCavalcanti?”\r\n\r\n“Count Andrea Cavalcanti,” repeated the young man, accompanying his\r\nwords with a bow.\r\n\r\n“You are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me, are you\r\nnot?” said the count.\r\n\r\n“I did not mention that, because the signature seemed to me so\r\nstrange.”\r\n\r\n“The letter signed ‘Sinbad the Sailor,’ is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so. Now, as I have never known any Sinbad, with the exception\r\nof the one celebrated in the _Thousand and One Nights_——”\r\n\r\n“Well, it is one of his descendants, and a great friend of mine; he is\r\na very rich Englishman, eccentric almost to insanity, and his real name\r\nis Lord Wilmore.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed? Then that explains everything that is extraordinary,” said\r\nAndrea. “He is, then, the same Englishman whom I met—at—ah—yes, indeed.\r\nWell, monsieur, I am at your service.”\r\n\r\n“If what you say be true,” replied the count, smiling, “perhaps you\r\nwill be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your\r\nfamily?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, I will do so,” said the young man, with a quickness which\r\ngave proof of his ready invention. “I am (as you have said) the Count\r\nAndrea Cavalcanti, son of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, a descendant of\r\nthe Cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at\r\nFlorence. Our family, although still rich (for my father’s income\r\namounts to half a million), has experienced many misfortunes, and I\r\nmyself was, at the age of five years, taken away by the treachery of my\r\ntutor, so that for fifteen years I have not seen the author of my\r\nexistence. Since I have arrived at years of discretion and become my\r\nown master, I have been constantly seeking him, but all in vain. At\r\nlength I received this letter from your friend, which states that my\r\nfather is in Paris, and authorizes me to address myself to you for\r\ninformation respecting him.”\r\n\r\n“Really, all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting,” said\r\nMonte Cristo, observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction; “and\r\nyou have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend\r\nSinbad; for your father is indeed here, and is seeking you.”\r\n\r\nThe count from the moment of first entering the drawing-room, had not\r\nonce lost sight of the expression of the young man’s countenance; he\r\nhad admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice;\r\nbut at these words, so natural in themselves, “Your father is indeed\r\nhere, and is seeking you,” young Andrea started, and exclaimed, “My\r\nfather? Is my father here?”\r\n\r\n“Most undoubtedly,” replied Monte Cristo; “your father, Major\r\nBartolomeo Cavalcanti.” The expression of terror which, for the moment,\r\nhad overspread the features of the young man, had now disappeared.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, that is the name, certainly. Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti. And\r\nyou really mean to say; monsieur, that my dear father is here?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; and I can even add that I have only just left his company.\r\nThe history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the\r\nquick; indeed, his griefs, hopes, and fears on that subject might\r\nfurnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem. At length, he\r\none day received a letter, stating that the abductors of his son now\r\noffered to restore him, or at least to give notice where he might be\r\nfound, on condition of receiving a large sum of money, by way of\r\nransom. Your father did not hesitate an instant, and the sum was sent\r\nto the frontier of Piedmont, with a passport signed for Italy. You were\r\nin the south of France, I think?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Andrea, with an embarrassed air, “I was in the south of\r\nFrance.”\r\n\r\n“A carriage was to await you at Nice?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely so; and it conveyed me from Nice to Genoa, from Genoa to\r\nTurin, from Turin to Chambéry, from Chambéry to Pont-de-Beauvoisin, and\r\nfrom Pont-de-Beauvoisin to Paris.”\r\n\r\n30133m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Indeed? Then your father ought to have met with you on the road, for\r\nit is exactly the same route which he himself took, and that is how we\r\nhave been able to trace your journey to this place.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Andrea, “if my father had met me, I doubt if he would have\r\nrecognized me; I must be somewhat altered since he last saw me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the voice of nature,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“True,” interrupted the young man, “I had not looked upon it in that\r\nlight.”\r\n\r\n“Now,” replied Monte Cristo “there is only one source of uneasiness\r\nleft in your father’s mind, which is this—he is anxious to know how you\r\nhave been employed during your long absence from him, how you have been\r\ntreated by your persecutors, and if they have conducted themselves\r\ntowards you with all the deference due to your rank. Finally, he is\r\nanxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad\r\nmoral influence to which you have been exposed, and which is infinitely\r\nmore to be dreaded than any physical suffering; he wishes to discover\r\nif the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been\r\nweakened by want of culture; and, in short, whether you consider\r\nyourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high\r\nposition to which your rank entitles you.”\r\n\r\n“Sir!” exclaimed the young man, quite astounded, “I hope no false\r\nreport——”\r\n\r\n“As for myself, I first heard you spoken of by my friend Wilmore, the\r\nphilanthropist. I believe he found you in some unpleasant position, but\r\ndo not know of what nature, for I did not ask, not being inquisitive.\r\nYour misfortunes engaged his sympathies, so you see you must have been\r\ninteresting. He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the\r\nposition which you had lost, and that he would seek your father until\r\nhe found him. He did seek, and has found him, apparently, since he is\r\nhere now; and, finally, my friend apprised me of your coming, and gave\r\nme a few other instructions relative to your future fortune. I am quite\r\naware that my friend Wilmore is peculiar, but he is sincere, and as\r\nrich as a gold mine, consequently, he may indulge his eccentricities\r\nwithout any fear of their ruining him, and I have promised to adhere to\r\nhis instructions. Now, sir, pray do not be offended at the question I\r\nam about to put to you, as it comes in the way of my duty as your\r\npatron. I would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to\r\nyou—misfortunes entirely beyond your control, and which in no degree\r\ndiminish my regard for you—I would wish to know if they have not, in\r\nsome measure, contributed to render you a stranger to the world in\r\nwhich your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous\r\nfigure?”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” returned the young man, with a reassurance of manner, “make your\r\nmind easy on this score. Those who took me from my father, and who\r\nalways intended, sooner or later, to sell me again to my original\r\nproprietor, as they have now done, calculated that, in order to make\r\nthe most of their bargain, it would be politic to leave me in\r\npossession of all my personal and hereditary worth, and even to\r\nincrease the value, if possible. I have, therefore, received a very\r\ngood education, and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as\r\nthe slaves were treated in Asia Minor, whose masters made them\r\ngrammarians, doctors, and philosophers, in order that they might fetch\r\na higher price in the Roman market.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo smiled with satisfaction; it appeared as if he had not\r\nexpected so much from M. Andrea Cavalcanti.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” continued the young man, “if there did appear some defect in\r\neducation, or offence against the established forms of etiquette, I\r\nsuppose it would be excused, in consideration of the misfortunes which\r\naccompanied my birth, and followed me through my youth.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Monte Cristo in an indifferent tone, “you will do as you\r\nplease, count, for you are the master of your own actions, and are the\r\nperson most concerned in the matter, but if I were you, I would not\r\ndivulge a word of these adventures. Your history is quite a romance,\r\nand the world, which delights in romances in yellow covers, strangely\r\nmistrusts those which are bound in living parchment, even though they\r\nbe gilded like yourself. This is the kind of difficulty which I wished\r\nto represent to you, my dear count. You would hardly have recited your\r\ntouching history before it would go forth to the world, and be deemed\r\nunlikely and unnatural. You would be no longer a lost child found, but\r\nyou would be looked upon as an upstart, who had sprung up like a\r\nmushroom in the night. You might excite a little curiosity, but it is\r\nnot everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the\r\nsubject of unpleasant remark.”\r\n\r\n“I agree with you, monsieur,” said the young man, turning pale, and, in\r\nspite of himself, trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his\r\ncompanion, “such consequences would be extremely unpleasant.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, you must not exaggerate the evil,” said Monte Cristo,\r\n“for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another. You\r\nmust resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct, and for a man\r\nof your intelligence, this plan is as easy as it is necessary; you must\r\nform honorable friendships, and by that means counteract the prejudice\r\nwhich may attach to the obscurity of your former life.”\r\n\r\nAndrea visibly changed countenance.\r\n\r\n“I would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser,” said Monte\r\nCristo, “did I not possess a moral distrust of my best friends, and a\r\nsort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too; therefore, in\r\ndeparting from this rule, I should (as the actors say) be playing a\r\npart quite out of my line, and should, therefore, run the risk of being\r\nhissed, which would be an act of folly.”\r\n\r\n“However, your excellency,” said Andrea, “in consideration of Lord\r\nWilmore, by whom I was recommended to you——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly,” interrupted Monte Cristo; “but Lord Wilmore did not\r\nomit to inform me, my dear M. Andrea, that the season of your youth was\r\nrather a stormy one. Ah,” said the count, watching Andrea’s\r\ncountenance, “I do not demand any confession from you; it is precisely\r\nto avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from Lucca. You\r\nshall soon see him. He is a little stiff and pompous in his manner, and\r\nhe is disfigured by his uniform; but when it becomes known that he has\r\nbeen for eighteen years in the Austrian service, all that will be\r\npardoned. We are not generally very severe with the Austrians. In\r\nshort, you will find your father a very presentable person, I assure\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir, you have given me confidence; it is so long since we were\r\nseparated, that I have not the least remembrance of him, and, besides,\r\nyou know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all\r\ndefects.”\r\n\r\n“He is a millionaire—his income is 500,000 francs.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said the young man, with anxiety, “I shall be sure to be placed\r\nin an agreeable position.”\r\n\r\n“One of the most agreeable possible, my dear sir; he will allow you an\r\nincome of 50,000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in\r\nParis.”\r\n\r\n“Then in that case I shall always choose to remain there.”\r\n\r\n“You cannot control circumstances, my dear sir; ‘man proposes, and God\r\ndisposes.’” Andrea sighed.\r\n\r\n“But,” said he, “so long as I do remain in Paris, and nothing forces me\r\nto quit it, do you mean to tell me that I may rely on receiving the sum\r\nyou just now mentioned to me?”\r\n\r\n“You may.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I receive it from my father?” asked Andrea, with some\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you will receive it from your father personally, but Lord Wilmore\r\nwill be the security for the money. He has, at the request of your\r\nfather, opened an account of 5,000 francs a month at M. Danglars’,\r\nwhich is one of the safest banks in Paris.”\r\n\r\n“And does my father mean to remain long in Paris?” asked Andrea.\r\n\r\n“Only a few days,” replied Monte Cristo. “His service does not allow\r\nhim to absent himself more than two or three weeks together.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear father!” exclaimed Andrea, evidently charmed with the idea\r\nof his speedy departure.\r\n\r\n“Therefore,” said Monte Cristo feigning to mistake his\r\nmeaning—“therefore I will not, for another instant, retard the pleasure\r\nof your meeting. Are you prepared to embrace your worthy father?”\r\n\r\n“I hope you do not doubt it.”\r\n\r\n30137m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Go, then, into the drawing-room, my young friend, where you will find\r\nyour father awaiting you.”\r\n\r\nAndrea made a low bow to the count, and entered the adjoining room.\r\nMonte Cristo watched him till he disappeared, and then touched a spring\r\nin a panel made to look like a picture, which, in sliding partly from\r\nthe frame, discovered to view a small opening, so cleverly contrived\r\nthat it revealed all that was passing in the drawing-room now occupied\r\nby Cavalcanti and Andrea. The young man closed the door behind him, and\r\nadvanced towards the major, who had risen when he heard steps\r\napproaching him.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear father!” said Andrea in a loud voice, in order that the\r\ncount might hear him in the next room, “is it really you?”\r\n\r\n“How do you do, my dear son?” said the major gravely.\r\n\r\n“After so many years of painful separation,” said Andrea, in the same\r\ntone of voice, and glancing towards the door, “what a happiness it is\r\nto meet again!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed it is, after so long a separation.”\r\n\r\n“Will you not embrace me, sir?” said Andrea.\r\n\r\n30139m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“If you wish it, my son,” said the major; and the two men embraced each\r\nother after the fashion of actors on the stage; that is to say, each\r\nrested his head on the other’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Then we are once more reunited?” said Andrea.\r\n\r\n“Once more,” replied the major.\r\n\r\n“Never more to be separated?”\r\n\r\n“Why, as to that—I think, my dear son, you must be by this time so\r\naccustomed to France as to look upon it almost as a second country.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” said the young man, “that I should be exceedingly\r\ngrieved to leave it.”\r\n\r\n“As for me, you must know I cannot possibly live out of Lucca;\r\ntherefore I shall return to Italy as soon as I can.”\r\n\r\n“But before you leave France, my dear father, I hope you will put me in\r\npossession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my\r\ndescent.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; I am come expressly on that account; it has cost me much\r\ntrouble to find you, but I had resolved on giving them into your hands,\r\nand if I had to recommence my search, it would occupy all the few\r\nremaining years of my life.”\r\n\r\n“Where are these papers, then?”\r\n\r\n“Here they are.”\r\n\r\nAndrea seized the certificate of his father’s marriage and his own\r\nbaptismal register, and after having opened them with all the eagerness\r\nwhich might be expected under the circumstances, he read them with a\r\nfacility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents, and\r\nwith an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the\r\ncontents. When he had perused the documents, an indefinable expression\r\nof pleasure lighted up his countenance, and looking at the major with a\r\nmost peculiar smile, he said, in very excellent Tuscan:\r\n\r\n“Then there is no longer any such thing, in Italy as being condemned to\r\nthe galleys?”\r\n\r\nThe major drew himself up to his full height.\r\n\r\n“Why?—what do you mean by that question?”\r\n\r\n“I mean that if there were, it would be impossible to draw up with\r\nimpunity two such deeds as these. In France, my dear sir, half such a\r\npiece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to\r\nToulon for five years, for change of air.”\r\n\r\n“Will you be good enough to explain your meaning?” said the major,\r\nendeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest\r\nmajesty.\r\n\r\n“My dear M. Cavalcanti,” said Andrea, taking the major by the arm in a\r\nconfidential manner, “how much are you paid for being my father?”\r\n\r\nThe major was about to speak, when Andrea continued, in a low voice:\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, I am going to set you an example of confidence, they give me\r\n50,000 francs a year to be your son; consequently, you can understand\r\nthat it is not at all likely I shall ever deny my parent.”\r\n\r\nThe major looked anxiously around him.\r\n\r\n“Make yourself easy, we are quite alone,” said Andrea; “besides, we are\r\nconversing in Italian.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” replied the major, “they paid me 50,000 francs down.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Cavalcanti,” said Andrea, “do you believe in fairy tales?”\r\n\r\n“I used not to do so, but I really feel now almost obliged to have\r\nfaith in them.”\r\n\r\n“You have, then, been induced to alter your opinion; you have had some\r\nproofs of their truth?” The major drew from his pocket a handful of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n“Most palpable proofs,” said he, “as you may perceive.”\r\n\r\n“You think, then, that I may rely on the count’s promises?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I do.”\r\n\r\n“You are sure he will keep his word with me?”\r\n\r\n“To the letter, but at the same time, remember, we must continue to\r\nplay our respective parts. I, as a tender father——”\r\n\r\n“And I as a dutiful son, as they choose that I shall be descended from\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Whom do you mean by they?”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, I can hardly tell, but I was alluding to those who wrote the\r\nletter; you received one, did you not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“From whom?”\r\n\r\n“From a certain Abbé Busoni.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any knowledge of him?”\r\n\r\n“No, I have never seen him.”\r\n\r\n“What did he say in the letter?”\r\n\r\n“You will promise not to betray me?”\r\n\r\n“Rest assured of that; you well know that our interests are the same.”\r\n\r\n“Then read for yourself;” and the major gave a letter into the young\r\nman’s hand. Andrea read in a low voice:\r\n\r\n“‘You are poor; a miserable old age awaits you. Would you like to\r\nbecome rich, or at least independent? Set out immediately for Paris,\r\nand demand of the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des Champs-Élysées, No.\r\n30, the son whom you had by the Marchesa Corsinari, and who was taken\r\nfrom you at five years of age. This son is named Andrea Cavalcanti. In\r\norder that you may not doubt the kind intention of the writer of this\r\nletter, you will find enclosed an order for 2,400 francs, payable in\r\nFlorence, at Signor Gozzi’s; also a letter of introduction to the Count\r\nof Monte Cristo, on whom I give you a draft of 48,000 francs. Remember\r\nto go to the count on the 26th May at seven o’clock in the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n“(Signed) ‘Abbé Busoni.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is the same.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” said the major.\r\n\r\n“I was going to say that I received a letter almost to the same\r\neffect.”\r\n\r\n“You?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“From the Abbé Busoni?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“From whom, then?”\r\n\r\n“From an Englishman, called Lord Wilmore, who takes the name of Sinbad\r\nthe Sailor.”\r\n\r\n“And of whom you have no more knowledge than I of the Abbé Busoni?”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken; there I am ahead of you.”\r\n\r\n“You have seen him, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, once.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that is just what I cannot tell you; if I did, I should make you\r\nas wise as myself, which it is not my intention to do.”\r\n\r\n“And what did the letter contain?”\r\n\r\n“Read it.”\r\n\r\n“‘You are poor, and your future prospects are dark and gloomy. Do you\r\nwish for a name? should you like to be rich, and your own master?’”\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu!_” said the young man; “was it possible there could be two\r\nanswers to such a question?”\r\n\r\n“‘Take the post-chaise which you will find waiting at the Porte de\r\nGênes, as you enter Nice; pass through Turin, Chambéry, and\r\nPont-de-Beauvoisin. Go to the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des\r\nChamps-Élysées, on the 26th of May, at seven o’clock in the evening,\r\nand demand of him your father. You are the son of the Marchese\r\nCavalcanti and the Marchesa Oliva Corsinari. The marquis will give you\r\nsome papers which will certify this fact, and authorize you to appear\r\nunder that name in the Parisian world. As to your rank, an annual\r\nincome of 50,000 livres will enable you to support it admirably. I\r\nenclose a draft for 5,000 livres, payable on M. Ferrea, banker at Nice,\r\nand also a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo, whom I\r\nhave directed to supply all your wants.\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘Sinbad the Sailor.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Humph,” said the major; “very good. You have seen the count, you say?”\r\n\r\n“I have only just left him.”\r\n\r\n“And has he conformed to all that the letter specified?”\r\n\r\n“He has.”\r\n\r\n“Do you understand it?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least.”\r\n\r\n“There is a dupe somewhere.”\r\n\r\n“At all events, it is neither you nor I.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then——”\r\n\r\n“Why, it does not much concern us, do you think it does?”\r\n\r\n“No; I agree with you there. We must play the game to the end, and\r\nconsent to be blindfolded.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you shall see; I promise you I will sustain my part to\r\nadmiration.”\r\n\r\n“I never once doubted your doing so.” Monte Cristo chose this moment\r\nfor re-entering the drawing-room. On hearing the sound of his\r\nfootsteps, the two men threw themselves in each other’s arms, and while\r\nthey were in the midst of this embrace, the count entered.\r\n\r\n“Well, marquis,” said Monte Cristo, “you appear to be in no way\r\ndisappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, your excellency, I am overwhelmed with delight.”\r\n\r\n“And what are your feelings?” said Monte Cristo, turning to the young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n“As for me, my heart is overflowing with happiness.”\r\n\r\n“Happy father, happy son!” said the count.\r\n\r\n“There is only one thing which grieves me,” observed the major, “and\r\nthat is the necessity for my leaving Paris so soon.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear M. Cavalcanti, I trust you will not leave before I have\r\nhad the honor of presenting you to some of my friends.”\r\n\r\n“I am at your service, sir,” replied the major.\r\n\r\n“Now, sir,” said Monte Cristo, addressing Andrea, “make your\r\nconfession.”\r\n\r\n“To whom?”\r\n\r\n“Tell M. Cavalcanti something of the state of your finances.”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_ monsieur, you have touched upon a tender chord.”\r\n\r\n“Do you hear what he says, major?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I do.”\r\n\r\n“But do you understand?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“Your son says he requires money.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what would you have me do?” said the major.\r\n\r\n“You should furnish him with some of course,” replied Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you,” said the count, at the same time advancing towards Andrea,\r\nand slipping a packet of bank-notes into the young man’s hand.\r\n\r\n“What is this?”\r\n\r\n“It is from your father.”\r\n\r\n“From my father?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; did you not tell him just now that you wanted money? Well, then,\r\nhe deputes me to give you this.”\r\n\r\n“Am I to consider this as part of my income on account?”\r\n\r\n“No, it is for the first expenses of your settling in Paris.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, how good my dear father is!”\r\n\r\n“Silence,” said Monte Cristo; “he does not wish you to know that it\r\ncomes from him.”\r\n\r\n“I fully appreciate his delicacy,” said Andrea, cramming the notes\r\nhastily into his pocket.\r\n\r\n“And now, gentlemen, I wish you good-morning,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again, your\r\nexcellency?” asked Cavalcanti.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Andrea, “when may we hope for that pleasure?”\r\n\r\n“On Saturday, if you will—Yes.—Let me see—Saturday—I am to dine at my\r\ncountry house, at Auteuil, on that day, Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28.\r\nSeveral persons are invited, and among others, M. Danglars, your\r\nbanker. I will introduce you to him, for it will be necessary he should\r\nknow you, as he is to pay your money.”\r\n\r\n“Full dress?” said the major, half aloud.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, certainly,” said the count; “uniform, cross, knee-breeches.”\r\n\r\n“And how shall I be dressed?” demanded Andrea.\r\n\r\n30145m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, very simply; black trousers, patent leather boots, white\r\nwaistcoat, either a black or blue coat, and a long cravat. Go to Blin\r\nor Véronique for your clothes. Baptistin will tell you where, if you do\r\nnot know their address. The less pretension there is in your attire,\r\nthe better will be the effect, as you are a rich man. If you mean to\r\nbuy any horses, get them of Devedeux, and if you purchase a phaeton, go\r\nto Baptiste for it.”\r\n\r\n“At what hour shall we come?” asked the young man.\r\n\r\n“About half-past six.”\r\n\r\n“We will be with you at that time,” said the major. The two Cavalcanti\r\nbowed to the count, and left the house. Monte Cristo went to the\r\nwindow, and saw them crossing the street, arm in arm.\r\n\r\n“There go two miscreants;” said he, “it is a pity they are not really\r\nrelated!” Then, after an instant of gloomy reflection, “Come, I will go\r\nto see the Morrels,” said he; “I think that disgust is even more\r\nsickening than hatred.”\r\n\r\n30147m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 57. In the Lucern Patch\r\n\r\nOur readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure\r\nsurrounding M. de Villefort’s house, and, behind the gate, half\r\nscreened from view by the large chestnut-trees, which on all sides\r\nspread their luxuriant branches, we shall find some people of our\r\nacquaintance. This time Maximilian was the first to arrive. He was\r\nintently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees, and awaiting\r\nwith anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk.\r\n\r\nAt length, the long-desired sound was heard, and instead of one figure,\r\nas he had expected, he perceived that two were approaching him. The\r\ndelay had been occasioned by a visit from Madame Danglars and Eugénie,\r\nwhich had been prolonged beyond the time at which Valentine was\r\nexpected. That she might not appear to fail in her promise to\r\nMaximilian, she proposed to Mademoiselle Danglars that they should take\r\na walk in the garden, being anxious to show that the delay, which was\r\ndoubtless a cause of vexation to him, was not occasioned by any neglect\r\non her part. The young man, with the intuitive perception of a lover,\r\nquickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily\r\nplaced, and he was comforted. Besides, although she avoided coming\r\nwithin speaking distance, Valentine arranged so that Maximilian could\r\nsee her pass and repass, and each time she went by, she managed,\r\nunperceived by her companion, to cast an expressive look at the young\r\nman, which seemed to say, “Have patience! You see it is not my fault.”\r\n\r\nAnd Maximilian was patient, and employed himself in mentally\r\ncontrasting the two girls,—one fair, with soft languishing eyes, a\r\nfigure gracefully bending like a weeping willow; the other a brunette,\r\nwith a fierce and haughty expression, and as straight as a poplar. It\r\nis unnecessary to state that, in the eyes of the young man, Valentine\r\ndid not suffer by the contrast. In about half an hour the girls went\r\naway, and Maximilian understood that Mademoiselle Danglars’ visit had\r\nat last come to an end. In a few minutes Valentine re-entered the\r\ngarden alone. For fear that anyone should be observing her return, she\r\nwalked slowly; and instead of immediately directing her steps towards\r\nthe gate, she seated herself on a bench, and, carefully casting her\r\neyes around, to convince herself that she was not watched, she\r\npresently arose, and proceeded quickly to join Maximilian.\r\n\r\n“Good-evening, Valentine,” said a well-known voice.\r\n\r\n“Good-evening, Maximilian; I know I have kept you waiting, but you saw\r\nthe cause of my delay.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I recognized Mademoiselle Danglars. I was not aware that you were\r\nso intimate with her.”\r\n\r\n“Who told you we were intimate, Maximilian?”\r\n\r\n“No one, but you appeared to be so. From the manner in which you walked\r\nand talked together, one would have thought you were two school-girls\r\ntelling your secrets to each other.”\r\n\r\n“We were having a confidential conversation,” returned Valentine; “she\r\nwas owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with M. de Morcerf; and\r\nI, on the other hand, was confessing to her how wretched it made me to\r\nthink of marrying M. d’Épinay.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Valentine!”\r\n\r\n“That will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed\r\nbetween me and Eugénie, as in speaking of the man whom I could not\r\nlove, my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections\r\nwere fixed.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, how good you are to say so, Valentine! You possess a quality which\r\ncan never belong to Mademoiselle Danglars. It is that indefinable charm\r\nwhich is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the\r\nfruit, for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek.”\r\n\r\n“It is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light.”\r\n\r\n“No, Valentine, I assure you such is not the case. I was observing you\r\nboth when you were walking in the garden, and, on my honor, without at\r\nall wishing to depreciate the beauty of Mademoiselle Danglars, I cannot\r\nunderstand how any man can really love her.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is, Maximilian, that I was there, and my presence had the\r\neffect of rendering you unjust in your comparison.”\r\n\r\n“No; but tell me—it is a question of simple curiosity, and which was\r\nsuggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to Mademoiselle\r\nDanglars——”\r\n\r\n“I dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say. It\r\nonly proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex,”\r\ninterrupted Valentine.\r\n\r\n“You cannot, at least, deny that you are very harsh judges of each\r\nother.”\r\n\r\n“If we are so, it is because we generally judge under the influence of\r\nexcitement. But return to your question.”\r\n\r\n30151m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Does Mademoiselle Danglars object to this marriage with M. de Morcerf\r\non account of loving another?”\r\n\r\n“I told you I was not on terms of strict intimacy with Eugénie.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly\r\nintimate; own, now, that you did question her on the subject. Ah, I see\r\nyou are smiling.”\r\n\r\n“If you are already aware of the conversation that passed, the wooden\r\npartition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight\r\nsecurity.”\r\n\r\n“Come, what did she say?”\r\n\r\n“She told me that she loved no one,” said Valentine; “that she disliked\r\nthe idea of being married; that she would infinitely prefer leading an\r\nindependent and unfettered life; and that she almost wished her father\r\nmight lose his fortune, that she might become an artist, like her\r\nfriend, Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you see——”\r\n\r\n“Well, what does that prove?” asked Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” replied Maximilian.\r\n\r\n“Then why did you smile?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself,\r\nValentine.”\r\n\r\n“Do you want me to go away?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, no, no. But do not let us lose time; you are the subject on which\r\nI wish to speak.”\r\n\r\n“True, we must be quick, for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_” said Maximilian, in consternation.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you are right; I am but a poor friend to you. What a life I cause\r\nyou to lead, poor Maximilian, you who are formed for happiness! I\r\nbitterly reproach myself, I assure you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what does it signify, Valentine, so long as I am satisfied, and\r\nfeel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five\r\nminutes of your society, or two words from your lips? And I have also a\r\ndeep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts,\r\nharmonizing as ours do, and almost miraculously brought us together, to\r\nseparate us at last.”\r\n\r\n“Those are kind and cheering words. You must hope for us both,\r\nMaximilian; that will make me at least partly happy.”\r\n\r\n“But why must you leave me so soon?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know particulars. I can only tell you that Madame de\r\nVillefort sent to request my presence, as she had a communication to\r\nmake on which a part of my fortune depended. Let them take my fortune,\r\nI am already too rich; and, perhaps, when they have taken it, they will\r\nleave me in peace and quietness. You would love me as much if I were\r\npoor, would you not, Maximilian?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I shall always love you. What should I care for either riches or\r\npoverty, if my Valentine was near me, and I felt certain that no one\r\ncould deprive me of her? But do you not fear that this communication\r\nmay relate to your marriage?”\r\n\r\n“I do not think that is the case.”\r\n\r\n“However it may be, Valentine, you must not be alarmed. I assure you\r\nthat, as long as I live, I shall never love anyone else!”\r\n\r\n“Do you think to reassure me when you say that, Maximilian?”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, you are right. I am a brute. But I was going to tell you\r\nthat I met M. de Morcerf the other day.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Franz is his friend, you know.”\r\n\r\n“What then?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur de Morcerf has received a letter from Franz, announcing his\r\nimmediate return.” Valentine turned pale, and leaned her hand against\r\nthe gate.\r\n\r\n“Ah heavens, if it were that! But no, the communication would not come\r\nthrough Madame de Villefort.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because—I scarcely know why—but it has appeared as if Madame de\r\nVillefort secretly objected to the marriage, although she did not\r\nchoose openly to oppose it.”\r\n\r\n“Is it so? Then I feel as if I could adore Madame de Villefort.”\r\n\r\n“Do not be in such a hurry to do that,” said Valentine, with a sad\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“If she objects to your marrying M. d’Épinay, she would be all the more\r\nlikely to listen to any other proposition.”\r\n\r\n“No, Maximilian, it is not suitors to which Madame de Villefort\r\nobjects, it is marriage itself.”\r\n\r\n“Marriage? If she dislikes that so much, why did she ever marry\r\nherself?”\r\n\r\n“You do not understand me, Maximilian. About a year ago, I talked of\r\nretiring to a convent. Madame de Villefort, in spite of all the remarks\r\nwhich she considered it her duty to make, secretly approved of the\r\nproposition, my father consented to it at her instigation, and it was\r\nonly on account of my poor grandfather that I finally abandoned the\r\nproject. You can form no idea of the expression of that old man’s eye\r\nwhen he looks at me, the only person in the world whom he loves, and, I\r\nhad almost said, by whom he is beloved in return. When he learned my\r\nresolution, I shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on\r\nme, and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his\r\nlifeless cheeks. Ah, Maximilian, I experienced, at that moment, such\r\nremorse for my intention, that, throwing myself at his feet, I\r\nexclaimed,—‘Forgive me, pray forgive me, my dear grandfather; they may\r\ndo what they will with me, I will never leave you.’ When I had ceased\r\nspeaking, he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven, but without uttering\r\na word. Ah, Maximilian, I may have much to suffer, but I feel as if my\r\ngrandfather’s look at that moment would more than compensate for all.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Valentine, you are a perfect angel, and I am sure I do not know\r\nwhat I—sabring right and left among the Bedouins—can have done to merit\r\nyour being revealed to me, unless, indeed, Heaven took into\r\nconsideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels. But\r\ntell me what interest Madame de Villefort can have in your remaining\r\nunmarried?”\r\n\r\n“Did I not tell you just now that I was rich, Maximilian—too rich? I\r\npossess nearly 50,000 livres in right of my mother; my grandfather and\r\nmy grandmother, the Marquis and Marquise de Saint-Méran, will leave me\r\nas much, and M. Noirtier evidently intends making me his heir. My\r\nbrother Edward, who inherits nothing from his mother, will, therefore,\r\nbe poor in comparison with me. Now, if I had taken the veil, all this\r\nfortune would have descended to my father, and, in reversion, to his\r\nson.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should\r\nbe so avaricious.”\r\n\r\n“It is not for herself that she is so, but for her son, and what you\r\nregard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of\r\nmaternal love.”\r\n\r\n“But could you not compromise matters, and give up a portion of your\r\nfortune to her son?”\r\n\r\n“How could I make such a proposition, especially to a woman who always\r\nprofesses to be so entirely disinterested?”\r\n\r\n“Valentine, I have always regarded our love in the light of something\r\nsacred; consequently, I have covered it with the veil of respect, and\r\nhid it in the innermost recesses of my soul. No human being, not even\r\nmy sister, is aware of its existence. Valentine, will you permit me to\r\nmake a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you?”\r\n\r\nValentine started. “A friend, Maximilian; and who is this friend? I\r\ntremble to give my permission.”\r\n\r\n“Listen, Valentine. Have you never experienced for anyone that sudden\r\nand irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it\r\nhad been your old and familiar friend, though, in reality, it was the\r\nfirst time you had ever met? Nay, further, have you never endeavored to\r\nrecall the time, place, and circumstances of your former intercourse,\r\nand failing in this attempt, have almost believed that your spirits\r\nmust have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior\r\nto the present, and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of\r\nthe past?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that is precisely the feeling which I experienced when I first\r\nsaw that extraordinary man.”\r\n\r\n“Extraordinary, did you say?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You have known him for some time, then?”\r\n\r\n“Scarcely longer than eight or ten days.”\r\n\r\n“And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight\r\nor ten days? Ah, Maximilian, I had hoped you set a higher value on the\r\ntitle of friend.”\r\n\r\n“Your logic is most powerful, Valentine, but say what you will, I can\r\nnever renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession\r\nof my mind. I feel as if it were ordained that this man should be\r\nassociated with all the good which the future may have in store for me,\r\nand sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to\r\ncome, and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according\r\nto his own will.”\r\n\r\n“He must be a prophet, then,” said Valentine, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said Maximilian, “I have often been almost tempted to\r\nattribute to him the gift of prophecy; at all events, he has a\r\nwonderful power of foretelling any future good.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Valentine in a mournful tone, “do let me see this man,\r\nMaximilian; he may tell me whether I shall ever be loved sufficiently\r\nto make amends for all I have suffered.”\r\n\r\n“My poor girl, you know him already.”\r\n\r\n“I know him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it was he who saved the life of your step-mother and her son.”\r\n\r\n“The Count of Monte Cristo?”\r\n\r\n“The same.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” cried Valentine, “he is too much the friend of Madame de\r\nVillefort ever to be mine.”\r\n\r\n“The friend of Madame de Villefort! It cannot be; surely, Valentine,\r\nyou are mistaken?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed, I am not; for I assure you, his power over our household\r\nis almost unlimited. Courted by my step-mother, who regards him as the\r\nepitome of human wisdom; admired by my father, who says he has never\r\nbefore heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed; idolized by\r\nEdward, who, notwithstanding his fear of the count’s large black eyes,\r\nruns to meet him the moment he arrives, and opens his hand, in which he\r\nis sure to find some delightful present,—M. de Monte Cristo appears to\r\nexert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the\r\nmembers of our family.”\r\n\r\n“If such be the case, my dear Valentine, you must yourself have felt,\r\nor at all events will soon feel, the effects of his presence. He meets\r\nAlbert de Morcerf in Italy—it is to rescue him from the hands of the\r\nbanditti; he introduces himself to Madame Danglars—it is that he may\r\ngive her a royal present; your step-mother and her son pass before his\r\ndoor—it is that his Nubian may save them from destruction. This man\r\nevidently possesses the power of influencing events, both as regards\r\nmen and things. I never saw more simple tastes united to greater\r\nmagnificence. His smile is so sweet when he addresses me, that I forget\r\nit ever can be bitter to others. Ah, Valentine, tell me, if he ever\r\nlooked on you with one of those sweet smiles? if so, depend on it, you\r\nwill be happy.”\r\n\r\n“Me?” said the young girl, “he never even glances at me; on the\r\ncontrary, if I accidentally cross his path, he appears rather to avoid\r\nme. Ah, he is not generous, neither does he possess that supernatural\r\npenetration which you attribute to him, for if he did, he would have\r\nperceived that I was unhappy; and if he had been generous, seeing me\r\nsad and solitary, he would have used his influence to my advantage, and\r\nsince, as you say, he resembles the sun, he would have warmed my heart\r\nwith one of his life-giving rays. You say he loves you, Maximilian; how\r\ndo you know that he does? All would pay deference to an officer like\r\nyou, with a fierce moustache and a long sabre, but they think they may\r\ncrush a poor weeping girl with impunity.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Valentine, I assure you you are mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“If it were otherwise—if he treated me diplomatically—that is to say,\r\nlike a man who wishes, by some means or other, to obtain a footing in\r\nthe house, so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its\r\noccupants—he would, if it had been but once, have honored me with the\r\nsmile which you extol so loudly; but no, he saw that I was unhappy, he\r\nunderstood that I could be of no use to him, and therefore paid no\r\nattention to me whatever. Who knows but that, in order to please Madame\r\nde Villefort and my father, he may not persecute me by every means in\r\nhis power? It is not just that he should despise me so, without any\r\nreason. Ah, forgive me,” said Valentine, perceiving the effect which\r\nher words were producing on Maximilian: “I have done wrong, for I have\r\ngiven utterance to thoughts concerning that man which I did not even\r\nknow existed in my heart. I do not deny the influence of which you\r\nspeak, or that I have not myself experienced it, but with me it has\r\nbeen productive of evil rather than good.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Valentine,” said Morrel with a sigh, “we will not discuss the\r\nmatter further. I will not make a confidant of him.”\r\n\r\n“Alas!” said Valentine, “I see that I have given you pain. I can only\r\nsay how sincerely I ask pardon for having grieved you. But, indeed, I\r\nam not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction. Tell me what this\r\nCount of Monte Cristo has done for you.”\r\n\r\n30157m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I own that your question embarrasses me, Valentine, for I cannot say\r\nthat the count has rendered me any ostensible service. Still, as I have\r\nalready told you, I have an instinctive affection for him, the source\r\nof which I cannot explain to you. Has the sun done anything for me? No;\r\nhe warms me with his rays, and it is by his light that I see\r\nyou—nothing more. Has such and such a perfume done anything for me? No;\r\nits odor charms one of my senses—that is all I can say when I am asked\r\nwhy I praise it. My friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable\r\nas his for me. A secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be\r\nsomething more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of\r\nfriendship. In his most simple actions, as well as in his most secret\r\nthoughts, I find a relation to my own. You will perhaps smile at me\r\nwhen I tell you that, ever since I have known this man, I have\r\ninvoluntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has\r\nbefallen me originated from him. However, I have managed to live thirty\r\nyears without this protection, you will say; but I will endeavor a\r\nlittle to illustrate my meaning. He invited me to dine with him on\r\nSaturday, which was a very natural thing for him to do. Well, what have\r\nI learned since? That your mother and M. de Villefort are both coming\r\nto this dinner. I shall meet them there, and who knows what future\r\nadvantages may result from the interview? This may appear to you to be\r\nno unusual combination of circumstances; nevertheless, I perceive some\r\nhidden plot in the arrangement—something, in fact, more than is\r\napparent on a casual view of the subject. I believe that this singular\r\nman, who appears to fathom the motives of everyone, has purposely\r\narranged for me to meet M. and Madame de Villefort, and sometimes, I\r\nconfess, I have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he\r\nwas in possession of the secret of our love.”\r\n\r\n“My good friend,” said Valentine, “I should take you for a visionary,\r\nand should tremble for your reason, if I were always to hear you talk\r\nin a strain similar to this. Is it possible that you can see anything\r\nmore than the merest chance in this meeting? Pray reflect a little. My\r\nfather, who never goes out, has several times been on the point of\r\nrefusing this invitation; Madame de Villefort, on the contrary, is\r\nburning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own\r\nhouse, therefore, she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father\r\nto accompany her. No, no; it is as I have said, Maximilian,—there is no\r\none in the world of whom I can ask help but yourself and my\r\ngrandfather, who is little better than a corpse—no support to cling to\r\nbut my mother in heaven!”\r\n\r\n“I see that you are right, logically speaking,” said Maximilian; “but\r\nthe gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince\r\nme today.”\r\n\r\n“I feel the same as regards yourself.” said Valentine; “and I own that,\r\nif you have no stronger proof to give me——”\r\n\r\n“I have another,” replied Maximilian; “but I fear you will deem it even\r\nmore absurd than the first.”\r\n\r\n“So much the worse,” said Valentine, smiling.\r\n\r\n“It is, nevertheless, conclusive to my mind. My ten years of service\r\nhave also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations, for\r\nI have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which\r\ndirected me to move at once either to the right or to the left, in\r\norder to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side,\r\nwhile it left me unharmed.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Maximilian, why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers\r\nfor your safety? When you are away, I no longer pray for myself, but\r\nfor you.”\r\n\r\n30159m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes, since you have known me,” said Morrel, smiling; “but that cannot\r\napply to the time previous to our acquaintance, Valentine.”\r\n\r\n“You are very provoking, and will not give me credit for anything; but\r\nlet me hear this second proof, which you yourself own to be absurd.”\r\n\r\n“Well, look through this opening, and you will see the beautiful new\r\nhorse which I rode here.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! what a beautiful creature!” cried Valentine; “why did you not\r\nbring him close to the gate, so that I could talk to him and pat him?”\r\n\r\n“He is, as you see, a very valuable animal,” said Maximilian. “You know\r\nthat my means are limited, and that I am what would be designated a man\r\nof moderate pretensions. Well, I went to a horse dealer’s, where I saw\r\nthis magnificent horse, which I have named Médéah. I asked the price;\r\nthey told me it was 4,500 francs. I was, therefore, obliged to give it\r\nup, as you may imagine, but I own I went away with rather a heavy\r\nheart, for the horse had looked at me affectionately, had rubbed his\r\nhead against me and, when I mounted him, had pranced in the most\r\ndelightful way imaginable, so that I was altogether fascinated with\r\nhim. The same evening some friends of mine visited me,—M. de\r\nChâteau-Renaud, M. Debray, and five or six other choice spirits, whom\r\nyou do not know, even by name. They proposed a game of _bouillotte_. I\r\nnever play, for I am not rich enough to afford to lose, or sufficiently\r\npoor to desire to gain. But I was at my own house, you understand, so\r\nthere was nothing to be done but to send for the cards, which I did.\r\n\r\n“Just as they were sitting down to table, M. de Monte Cristo arrived.\r\nHe took his seat amongst them; they played, and I won. I am almost\r\nashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5,000 francs. We separated at\r\nmidnight. I could not defer my pleasure, so I took a cabriolet and\r\ndrove to the horse dealer’s. Feverish and excited, I rang at the door.\r\nThe person who opened it must have taken me for a madman, for I rushed\r\nat once to the stable. Médéah was standing at the rack, eating his hay.\r\nI immediately put on the saddle and bridle, to which operation he lent\r\nhimself with the best grace possible; then, putting the 4,500 francs\r\ninto the hands of the astonished dealer, I proceeded to fulfil my\r\nintention of passing the night in riding in the Champs-Élysées. As I\r\nrode by the count’s house I perceived a light in one of the windows,\r\nand fancied I saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain.\r\nNow, Valentine, I firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess\r\nthis horse, and that he lost expressly to give me the means of\r\nprocuring him.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Maximilian, you are really too fanciful; you will not love\r\neven me long. A man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of\r\npoetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common,\r\nevery-day sort of attachment such as ours. But they are calling me. Do\r\nyou hear?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Valentine,” said Maximilian, “give me but one finger through this\r\nopening in the grating, one finger, the littlest finger of all, that I\r\nmay have the happiness of kissing it.”\r\n\r\n“Maximilian, we said we would be to each other as two voices, two\r\nshadows.”\r\n\r\n“As you will, Valentine.”\r\n\r\n“Shall you be happy if I do what you wish?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes!”\r\n\r\nValentine mounted on a bench, and passed not only her finger but her\r\nwhole hand through the opening. Maximilian uttered a cry of delight,\r\nand, springing forwards, seized the hand extended towards him, and\r\nimprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss. The little hand was\r\nthen immediately withdrawn, and the young man saw Valentine hurrying\r\ntowards the house, as though she were almost terrified at her own\r\nsensations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 58. M. Noirtier de Villefort\r\n\r\nWe will now relate what was passing in the house of the king’s attorney\r\nafter the departure of Madame Danglars and her daughter, and during the\r\ntime of the conversation between Maximilian and Valentine, which we\r\nhave just detailed.\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort entered his father’s room, followed by Madame de\r\nVillefort. Both of the visitors, after saluting the old man and\r\nspeaking to Barrois, a faithful servant, who had been twenty-five years\r\nin his service, took their places on either side of the paralytic.\r\n\r\nM. Noirtier was sitting in an armchair, which moved upon casters, in\r\nwhich he was wheeled into the room in the morning, and in the same way\r\ndrawn out again at night. He was placed before a large glass, which\r\nreflected the whole apartment, and so, without any attempt to move,\r\nwhich would have been impossible, he could see all who entered the room\r\nand everything which was going on around him. M. Noirtier, although\r\nalmost as immovable as a corpse, looked at the new-comers with a quick\r\nand intelligent expression, perceiving at once, by their ceremonious\r\ncourtesy, that they were come on business of an unexpected and official\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nSight and hearing were the only senses remaining, and they, like two\r\nsolitary sparks, remained to animate the miserable body which seemed\r\nfit for nothing but the grave; it was only, however, by means of one of\r\nthese senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still\r\noccupied his mind, and the look by which he gave expression to his\r\ninner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller\r\nsees by night across some desert place, and knows that a living being\r\ndwells beyond the silence and obscurity.\r\n\r\nNoirtier’s hair was long and white, and flowed over his shoulders;\r\nwhile in his eyes, shaded by thick black lashes, was concentrated, as\r\nit often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the\r\nothers, all the activity, address, force, and intelligence which were\r\nformerly diffused over his whole body; and so although the movement of\r\nthe arm, the sound of the voice, and the agility of the body, were\r\nwanting, the speaking eye sufficed for all. He commanded with it; it\r\nwas the medium through which his thanks were conveyed. In short, his\r\nwhole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with\r\nliving eyes, and nothing could be more startling than to observe the\r\nexpression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs, while the\r\nrest of the rigid and marble-like features were utterly deprived of the\r\npower of participation. Three persons only could understand this\r\nlanguage of the poor paralytic; these were Villefort, Valentine, and\r\nthe old servant of whom we have already spoken. But as Villefort saw\r\nhis father but seldom, and then only when absolutely obliged, and as he\r\nnever took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there, all\r\nthe old man’s happiness was centred in his granddaughter. Valentine, by\r\nmeans of her love, her patience, and her devotion, had learned to read\r\nin Noirtier’s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his\r\nmind. To this dumb language, which was so unintelligible to others, she\r\nanswered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her\r\ncountenance, and in this manner were the conversations sustained\r\nbetween the blooming girl and the helpless invalid, whose body could\r\nscarcely be called a living one, but who, nevertheless, possessed a\r\nfund of knowledge and penetration, united with a will as powerful as\r\never although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying\r\nits impulses.\r\n\r\nValentine had solved the problem, and was able easily to understand his\r\nthoughts, and to convey her own in return, and, through her untiring\r\nand devoted assiduity, it was seldom that, in the ordinary transactions\r\nof every-day life, she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living,\r\nthinking mind, or the wants of the almost inanimate body.\r\n\r\nAs to the servant, he had, as we have said, been with his master for\r\nfive-and-twenty years, therefore he knew all his habits, and it was\r\nseldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything, so prompt\r\nwas he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid.\r\n\r\nVillefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in\r\norder to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was\r\nabout to begin. As we have said, he perfectly understood the old man’s\r\nvocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it was only\r\nindifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so doing. He\r\ntherefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden, sent away Barrois,\r\nand after having seated himself at his father’s right hand, while\r\nMadame de Villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus:\r\n\r\n“I trust you will not be displeased, sir, that Valentine has not come\r\nwith us, or that I dismissed Barrois, for our conference will be one\r\nwhich could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either.\r\nMadame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier’s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble,\r\nwhile, on the contrary, Villefort’s eye was endeavoring to penetrate\r\ninto the inmost recesses of the old man’s heart.\r\n\r\n“This communication,” continued the procureur, in that cold and\r\ndecisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, “will,\r\nwe are sure, meet with your approbation.”\r\n\r\nThe eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which\r\nprevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which\r\nwere passing in his mind; he listened, nothing more.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” resumed Villefort, “we are thinking of marrying Valentine.” Had\r\nthe old man’s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less\r\nemotion at this news than was now to be traced there. “The marriage\r\nwill take place in less than three months,” said Villefort.\r\n\r\nNoirtier’s eye still retained its inanimate expression.\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and added:\r\n\r\n“We thought this news would possess an interest for you, sir, who have\r\nalways entertained a great affection for Valentine; it therefore only\r\nnow remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she\r\nis destined. It is one of the most desirable connections which could\r\npossibly be formed; he possesses fortune, a high rank in society, and\r\nevery personal qualification likely to render Valentine supremely\r\nhappy,—his name, moreover, cannot be wholly unknown to you. It is M.\r\nFranz de Quesnel, Baron d’Épinay.”\r\n\r\nWhile his wife was speaking, Villefort had narrowly watched the old\r\nman’s countenance. When Madame de Villefort pronounced the name of\r\nFranz, the pupil of M. Noirtier’s eye began to dilate, and his eyelids\r\ntrembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an\r\nindividual about to speak, and he darted a lightning glance at Madame\r\nde Villefort and his son. The procureur, who knew the political hatred\r\nwhich had formerly existed between M. Noirtier and the elder d’Épinay,\r\nwell understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had\r\nproduced; but, feigning not to perceive either, he immediately resumed\r\nthe narrative begun by his wife.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he, “you are aware that Valentine is about to enter her\r\nnineteenth year, which renders it important that she should lose no\r\ntime in forming a suitable alliance. Nevertheless, you have not been\r\nforgotten in our plans, and we have fully ascertained beforehand that\r\nValentine’s future husband will consent, not to live in this house, for\r\nthat might not be pleasant for the young people, but that you should\r\nlive with them; so that you and Valentine, who are so attached to each\r\nother, would not be separated, and you would be able to pursue exactly\r\nthe same course of life which you have hitherto done, and thus, instead\r\nof losing, you will be a gainer by the change, as it will secure to you\r\ntwo children instead of one, to watch over and comfort you.”\r\n\r\n30165m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNoirtier’s look was furious; it was very evident that something\r\ndesperate was passing in the old man’s mind, for a cry of anger and\r\ngrief rose in his throat, and not being able to find vent in utterance,\r\nappeared almost to choke him, for his face and lips turned quite purple\r\nwith the struggle. Villefort quietly opened a window, saying, “It is\r\nvery warm, and the heat affects M. Noirtier.” He then returned to his\r\nplace, but did not sit down.\r\n\r\n“This marriage,” added Madame de Villefort, “is quite agreeable to the\r\nwishes of M. d’Épinay and his family; besides, he had no relations\r\nnearer than an uncle and aunt, his mother having died at his birth, and\r\nhis father having been assassinated in 1815, that is to say, when he\r\nwas but two years old; it naturally followed that the child was\r\npermitted to choose his own pursuits, and he has, therefore, seldom\r\nacknowledged any other authority but that of his own will.”\r\n\r\n“That assassination was a mysterious affair,” said Villefort, “and the\r\nperpetrators have hitherto escaped detection, although suspicion has\r\nfallen on the head of more than one person.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile.\r\n\r\n“Now,” continued Villefort, “those to whom the guilt really belongs, by\r\nwhom the crime was committed, on whose heads the justice of man may\r\nprobably descend here, and the certain judgment of God hereafter, would\r\nrejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a\r\npeace-offering as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so\r\nruthlessly destroyed.” Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion\r\nmore than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and\r\nshattered frame.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I understand,” was the reply contained in his look; and this look\r\nexpressed a feeling of strong indignation, mixed with profound\r\ncontempt. Villefort fully understood his father’s meaning, and answered\r\nby a slight shrug of his shoulders. He then motioned to his wife to\r\ntake leave.\r\n\r\n“Now sir,” said Madame de Villefort, “I must bid you farewell. Would\r\nyou like me to send Edward to you for a short time?”\r\n\r\nIt had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by\r\nclosing his eyes, his refusal by winking them several times, and if he\r\nhad some desire or feeling to express, he raised them to heaven. If he\r\nwanted Valentine, he closed his right eye only, and if Barrois, the\r\nleft. At Madame de Villefort’s proposition he instantly winked his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nProvoked by a complete refusal, she bit her lip and said, “Then shall I\r\nsend Valentine to you?” The old man closed his eyes eagerly, thereby\r\nintimating that such was his wish.\r\n\r\nM. and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room, giving orders that\r\nValentine should be summoned to her grandfather’s presence, and feeling\r\nsure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the\r\nperturbed spirit of the invalid. Valentine, with a color still\r\nheightened by emotion, entered the room just after her parents had\r\nquitted it. One look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather\r\nwas suffering, and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing\r\nto communicate to her.\r\n\r\n“Dear grandpapa,” cried she, “what has happened? They have vexed you,\r\nand you are angry?”\r\n\r\nThe paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent.\r\n\r\n“Who has displeased you? Is it my father?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Madame de Villefort?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Me?” The former sign was repeated.\r\n\r\n“Are you displeased with me?” cried Valentine in astonishment. M.\r\nNoirtier again closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n“And what have I done, dear grandpapa, that you should be angry with\r\nme?” cried Valentine.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, and she continued:\r\n\r\n“I have not seen you all day. Has anyone been speaking to you against\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the old man’s look, with eagerness.\r\n\r\n“Let me think a moment. I do assure you, grandpapa—Ah—M. and Madame de\r\nVillefort have just left this room, have they not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And it was they who told you something which made you angry? What was\r\nit then? May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of\r\nmaking my peace with you?”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Noirtier’s look.\r\n\r\n“Ah, you frighten me. What can they have said?” and she again tried to\r\nthink what it could be.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I know,” said she, lowering her voice and going close to the old\r\nman. “They have been speaking of my marriage,—have they not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the angry look.\r\n\r\n“I understand; you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on\r\nthe subject. The reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping\r\nthe matter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it. They\r\ndid not even acquaint me with their intentions, and I only discovered\r\nthem by chance, that is why I have been so reserved with you, dear\r\ngrandpapa. Pray forgive me.”\r\n\r\nBut there was no look calculated to reassure her; all it seemed to say\r\nwas, “It is not only your reserve which afflicts me.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, then?” asked the young girl. “Perhaps you think I shall\r\nabandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am\r\nmarried?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“They told you, then, that M. d’Épinay consented to our all living\r\ntogether?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then why are you still vexed and grieved?” The old man’s eyes beamed\r\nwith an expression of gentle affection.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I understand,” said Valentine; “it is because you love me.” The\r\nold man assented.\r\n\r\n“And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You do not like M. Franz?” The eyes repeated several times, “No, no,\r\nno.”\r\n\r\n“Then you are vexed with the engagement?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, listen,” said Valentine, throwing herself on her knees, and\r\nputting her arm round her grandfather’s neck, “I am vexed, too, for I\r\ndo not love M. Franz d’Épinay.”\r\n\r\nAn expression of intense joy illumined the old man’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“When I wished to retire into a convent, you remember how angry you\r\nwere with me?” A tear trembled in the eye of the invalid. “Well,”\r\ncontinued Valentine, “the reason of my proposing it was that I might\r\nescape this hateful marriage, which drives me to despair.” Noirtier’s\r\nbreathing came thick and short.\r\n\r\n“Then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too? Ah, if you\r\ncould but help me—if we could both together defeat their plan! But you\r\nare unable to oppose them,—you, whose mind is so quick, and whose will\r\nis so firm are nevertheless, as weak and unequal to the contest as I am\r\nmyself. Alas, you, who would have been such a powerful protector to me\r\nin the days of your health and strength, can now only sympathize in my\r\njoys and sorrows, without being able to take any active part in them.\r\nHowever, this is much, and calls for gratitude and Heaven has not taken\r\naway all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness.”\r\n\r\nAt these words there appeared in Noirtier’s eye an expression of such\r\ndeep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words\r\nthere: “You are mistaken; I can still do much for you.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?” said Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Yes.” Noirtier raised his eyes, it was the sign agreed on between him\r\nand Valentine when he wanted anything.\r\n\r\n“What is it you want, dear grandpapa?” said Valentine, and she\r\nendeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to\r\nneed; and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind, she repeated\r\nthem aloud, then,—finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a\r\nconstant _“No,”_—she said, “Come, since this plan does not answer, I\r\nwill have recourse to another.”\r\n\r\nShe then recited all the letters of the alphabet from A down to N. When\r\nshe arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she\r\nhad spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Valentine, “the thing you desire begins with the letter N;\r\nit is with N that we have to do, then. Well, let me see, what can you\r\nwant that begins with N? Na—Ne—Ni—No——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, yes,” said the old man’s eye.\r\n\r\n“Ah, it is No, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nValentine fetched a dictionary, which she placed on a desk before\r\nNoirtier; she opened it, and, seeing that the old man’s eye was\r\nthoroughly fixed on its pages, she ran her finger quickly up and down\r\nthe columns. During the six years which had passed since Noirtier first\r\nfell into this sad state, Valentine’s powers of invention had been too\r\noften put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients\r\nfor gaining a knowledge of his wishes, and the constant practice had so\r\nperfected her in the art that she guessed the old man’s meaning as\r\nquickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted. At\r\nthe word _Notary_, Noirtier made a sign to her to stop.\r\n\r\n30169m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Notary,” said she, “do you want a notary, dear grandpapa?” The old man\r\nagain signified that it was a notary he desired.\r\n\r\n“You would wish a notary to be sent for then?” said Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Shall my father be informed of your wish?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then they shall go for him directly, dear grandpapa. Is that all you\r\nwant?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.” Valentine rang the bell, and ordered the servant to tell\r\nMonsieur or Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to M.\r\nNoirtier’s room.\r\n\r\n“Are you satisfied now?” inquired Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure you are; it is not very difficult to discover that.” And the\r\nyoung girl smiled on her grandfather, as if he had been a child. M. de\r\nVillefort entered, followed by Barrois.\r\n\r\n“What do you want me for, sir?” demanded he of the paralytic.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Valentine, “my grandfather wishes for a notary.” At this\r\nstrange and unexpected demand M. de Villefort and his father exchanged\r\nlooks.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” motioned the latter, with a firmness which seemed to declare\r\nthat with the help of Valentine and his old servant, who both knew what\r\nhis wishes were, he was quite prepared to maintain the contest.\r\n\r\n“Do you wish for a notary?” asked Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What to do?”\r\n\r\nNoirtier made no answer.\r\n\r\n“What do you want with a notary?” again repeated Villefort. The\r\ninvalid’s eye remained fixed, by which expression he intended to\r\nintimate that his resolution was unalterable.\r\n\r\n“Is it to do us some ill turn? Do you think it is worth while?” said\r\nVillefort.\r\n\r\n“Still,” said Barrois, with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant,\r\n“if M. Noirtier asks for a notary, I suppose he really wishes for a\r\nnotary; therefore I shall go at once and fetch one.” Barrois\r\nacknowledged no master but Noirtier, and never allowed his desires in\r\nany way to be contradicted.\r\n\r\n30171m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do want a notary,” motioned the old man, shutting his eyes with\r\na look of defiance, which seemed to say, “and I should like to see the\r\nperson who dares to refuse my request.”\r\n\r\n“You shall have a notary, as you absolutely wish for one, sir,” said\r\nVillefort; “but I shall explain to him your state of health, and make\r\nexcuses for you, for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous\r\none.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind that,” said Barrois; “I shall go and fetch a notary,\r\nnevertheless.” And the old servant departed triumphantly on his\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 59. The Will\r\n\r\nAs soon as Barrois had left the room, Noirtier looked at Valentine with\r\na malicious expression that said many things. The young girl perfectly\r\nunderstood the look, and so did Villefort, for his countenance became\r\nclouded, and he knitted his eyebrows angrily. He took a seat, and\r\nquietly awaited the arrival of the notary. Noirtier saw him seat\r\nhimself with an appearance of perfect indifference, at the same time\r\ngiving a side look at Valentine, which made her understand that she\r\nalso was to remain in the room. Three-quarters of an hour after,\r\nBarrois returned, bringing the notary with him.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Villefort, after the first salutations were over, “you were\r\nsent for by M. Noirtier, whom you see here. All his limbs have become\r\ncompletely paralysed, he has lost his voice also, and we ourselves find\r\nmuch trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier cast an appealing look on Valentine, which look was at once so\r\nearnest and imperative, that she answered immediately.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said she, “I perfectly understand my grandfather’s meaning at\r\nall times.”\r\n\r\n“That is quite true,” said Barrois; “and that is what I told the\r\ngentleman as we walked along.”\r\n\r\n“Permit me,” said the notary, turning first to Villefort and then to\r\nValentine—“permit me to state that the case in question is just one of\r\nthose in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act\r\nwithout thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility. The first thing\r\nnecessary to render an act valid is, that the notary should be\r\nthoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and\r\nwishes of the person dictating the act. Now I cannot be sure of the\r\napprobation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak, and as the\r\nobject of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me,\r\non account of his want of speech, my services here would be quite\r\nuseless, and cannot be legally exercised.”\r\n\r\nThe notary then prepared to retire. An imperceptible smile of triumph\r\nwas expressed on the lips of the procureur. Noirtier looked at\r\nValentine with an expression so full of grief, that she arrested the\r\ndeparture of the notary.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said she, “the language which I speak with my grandfather may be\r\neasily learnt, and I can teach you in a few minutes, to understand it\r\nalmost as well as I can myself. Will you tell me what you require, in\r\norder to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject?”\r\n\r\n“In order to render an act valid, I must be certain of the approbation\r\nor disapprobation of my client. Illness of body would not affect the\r\nvalidity of the deed, but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, by the help of two signs, with which I will acquaint you\r\npresently, you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather\r\nis still in the full possession of all his mental faculties. M.\r\nNoirtier, being deprived of voice and motion, is accustomed to convey\r\nhis meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify ‘yes,’ and to\r\nwink when he means ‘no.’ You now know quite enough to enable you to\r\nconverse with M. Noirtier;—try.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier gave Valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it\r\nwas comprehended even by the notary himself.\r\n\r\n“You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying,\r\nsir, have you?” asked the notary. Noirtier closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n“And you approve of what she said—that is to say, you declare that the\r\nsigns which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are\r\naccustomed to convey your thoughts?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“It was you who sent for me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“To make your will?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original\r\nintentions?” The old man winked violently.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” said the young girl, “do you understand now, and is your\r\nconscience perfectly at rest on the subject?”\r\n\r\nBut before the notary could answer, Villefort had drawn him aside.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he, “do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a\r\nphysical shock, such as M. Noirtier has received, without any detriment\r\nto his mental faculties?”\r\n\r\n“It is not exactly that, sir,” said the notary, “which makes me uneasy,\r\nbut the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions, so\r\nas to be able to get his answers.”\r\n\r\n“You must see that to be an utter impossibility,” said Villefort.\r\nValentine and the old man heard this conversation, and Noirtier fixed\r\nhis eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said she, “that need not make you uneasy, however difficult it\r\nmay at first sight appear to be. I can discover and explain to you my\r\ngrandfather’s thoughts, so as to put an end to all your doubts and\r\nfears on the subject. I have now been six years with M. Noirtier, and\r\nlet him tell you if ever once, during that time, he has entertained a\r\nthought which he was unable to make me understand.”\r\n\r\n“No,” signed the old man.\r\n\r\n“Let us try what we can do, then,” said the notary. “You accept this\r\nyoung lady as your interpreter, M. Noirtier?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, what do you require of me, and what document is it that you\r\nwish to be drawn up?”\r\n\r\nValentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to W. At\r\nthis letter the eloquent eye of Noirtier gave her notice that she was\r\nto stop.\r\n\r\n“It is very evident that it is the letter W which M. Noirtier wants,”\r\nsaid the notary.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” said Valentine; and, turning to her grandfather, she repeated,\r\n“Wa—We—Wi——” The old man stopped her at the last syllable. Valentine\r\nthen took the dictionary, and the notary watched her while she turned\r\nover the pages.\r\n\r\nShe passed her finger slowly down the columns, and when she came to the\r\nword “Will,” M. Noirtier’s eye bade her stop.\r\n\r\n“Will,” said the notary; “it is very evident that M. Noirtier is\r\ndesirous of making his will.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, yes,” motioned the invalid.\r\n\r\n“Really, sir, you must allow that this is most extraordinary,” said the\r\nastonished notary, turning to M. de Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the procureur, “and I think the will promises to be yet\r\nmore extraordinary, for I cannot see how it is to be drawn up without\r\nthe intervention of Valentine, and she may, perhaps, be considered as\r\ntoo much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable\r\ninterpreter of the obscure and ill-defined wishes of her grandfather.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, no,” replied the eye of the paralytic.\r\n\r\n“What?” said Villefort, “do you mean to say that Valentine is not\r\ninterested in your will?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the notary, whose interest had been greatly excited, and\r\nwho had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this\r\nextraordinary and picturesque scene, “what appeared so impossible to me\r\nan hour ago, has now become quite easy and practicable, and this may be\r\na perfectly valid will, provided it be read in the presence of seven\r\nwitnesses, approved by the testator, and sealed by the notary in the\r\npresence of the witnesses. As to the time, it will not require very\r\nmuch more than the generality of wills. There are certain forms\r\nnecessary to be gone through, and which are always the same. As to the\r\ndetails, the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in\r\nwhich we find the affairs of the testator, and by yourself, who, having\r\nhad the management of them, can doubtless give full information on the\r\nsubject. But besides all this, in order that the instrument may not be\r\ncontested, I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity,\r\ntherefore, one of my colleagues will help me, and, contrary to custom,\r\nwill assist in the dictation of the testament. Are you satisfied, sir?”\r\ncontinued the notary, addressing the old man.\r\n\r\n30175m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes,” looked the invalid, his eye beaming with delight at the ready\r\ninterpretation of his meaning.\r\n\r\n“What is he going to do?” thought Villefort, whose position demanded\r\nmuch reserve, but who was longing to know what his father’s intentions\r\nwere. He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent,\r\nbut Barrois, who had heard all that passed, had guessed his master’s\r\nwishes, and had already gone to fetch one. The procureur then told his\r\nwife to come up. In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had\r\nassembled in the chamber of the paralytic; the second notary had also\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nA few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two\r\nofficers of the law. They read to Noirtier the formal copy of a will,\r\nin order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are\r\ngenerally couched; then, in order to test the capacity of the testator,\r\nthe first notary said, turning towards him:\r\n\r\n“When an individual makes his will, it is generally in favor or in\r\nprejudice of some person.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation; you\r\nwill stop me when I reach the one representing the amount of your own\r\npossessions?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThere was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation. Never had the\r\nstruggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now, and if it\r\nwas not a sublime, it was, at least, a curious spectacle. They had\r\nformed a circle round the invalid; the second notary was sitting at a\r\ntable, prepared for writing, and his colleague was standing before the\r\ntestator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we\r\nhave alluded.\r\n\r\n“Your fortune exceeds 300,000 francs, does it not?” asked he. Noirtier\r\nmade a sign that it did.\r\n\r\n“Do you possess 400,000 francs?” inquired the notary. Noirtier’s eye\r\nremained immovable.\r\n\r\n“500,000?” The same expression continued.\r\n\r\n“600,000—700,000—800,000—900,000?”\r\n\r\nNoirtier stopped him at the last-named sum.\r\n\r\n“You are then in possession of 900,000 francs?” asked the notary.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“In landed property?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“In stock?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“The stock is in your own hands?”\r\n\r\nThe look which M. Noirtier cast on Barrois showed that there was\r\nsomething wanting which he knew where to find. The old servant left the\r\nroom, and presently returned, bringing with him a small casket.\r\n\r\n“Do you permit us to open this casket?” asked the notary. Noirtier gave\r\nhis assent.\r\n\r\nThey opened it, and found 900,000 francs in bank scrip. The first\r\nnotary handed over each note, as he examined it, to his colleague.\r\n\r\nThe total amount was found to be as M. Noirtier had stated.\r\n\r\n“It is all as he has said; it is very evident that the mind still\r\nretains its full force and vigor.” Then, turning towards the paralytic,\r\nhe said, “You possess, then, 900,000 francs of capital, which,\r\naccording to the manner in which you have invested it, ought to bring\r\nin an income of about 40,000 livres?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“To whom do you desire to leave this fortune?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Madame de Villefort, “there is not much doubt on that\r\nsubject. M. Noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter, Mademoiselle de\r\nVillefort; it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years, and\r\nhas, by her devoted attention, fully secured the affection, I had\r\nalmost said the gratitude, of her grandfather, and it is but just that\r\nshe should reap the fruit of her devotion.”\r\n\r\nThe eye of Noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not\r\ndeceived by the false assent given by Madame de Villefort’s words and\r\nmanner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain.\r\n\r\n“Is it, then, to Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort that you leave\r\nthese 900,000 francs?” demanded the notary, thinking he had only to\r\ninsert this clause, but waiting first for the assent of Noirtier, which\r\nit was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this\r\nsingular scene.\r\n\r\nValentine, when her name was made the subject of discussion, had\r\nstepped back, to escape unpleasant observation; her eyes were cast\r\ndown, and she was crying. The old man looked at her for an instant with\r\nan expression of the deepest tenderness, then, turning towards the\r\nnotary, he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent.\r\n\r\n“What,” said the notary, “do you not intend making Mademoiselle\r\nValentine de Villefort your residuary legatee?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“You are not making any mistake, are you?” said the notary; “you really\r\nmean to declare that such is not your intention?”\r\n\r\n“No,” repeated Noirtier; “No.”\r\n\r\nValentine raised her head, struck dumb with astonishment. It was not so\r\nmuch the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief,\r\nbut her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked\r\nher grandfather to such an act. But Noirtier looked at her with so much\r\naffectionate tenderness that she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Oh, grandpapa, I see now that it is only your fortune of which you\r\ndeprive me; you still leave me the love which I have always enjoyed.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, most assuredly,” said the eyes of the paralytic, for he\r\nclosed them with an expression which Valentine could not mistake.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, thank you,” murmured she. The old man’s declaration that\r\nValentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the\r\nhopes of Madame de Villefort; she gradually approached the invalid, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Then, doubtless, dear M. Noirtier, you intend leaving your fortune to\r\nyour grandson, Edward de Villefort?”\r\n\r\nThe winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and\r\nterrible, and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred.\r\n\r\n“No?” said the notary; “then, perhaps, it is to your son, M. de\r\nVillefort?”\r\n\r\n“No.” The two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and\r\ninquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator. Villefort\r\nand his wife both grew red, one from shame, the other from anger.\r\n\r\n“What have we all done, then, dear grandpapa?” said Valentine; “you no\r\nlonger seem to love any of us?”\r\n\r\nThe old man’s eyes passed rapidly from Villefort and his wife, and\r\nrested on Valentine with a look of unutterable fondness.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said she; “if you love me, grandpapa, try and bring that love\r\nto bear upon your actions at this present moment. You know me well\r\nenough to be quite sure that I have never thought of your fortune;\r\nbesides, they say I am already rich in right of my mother—too rich,\r\neven. Explain yourself, then.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on Valentine’s hand.\r\n\r\n“My hand?” said she.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Her hand!” exclaimed everyone.\r\n\r\n“Oh, gentlemen, you see it is all useless, and that my father’s mind is\r\nreally impaired,” said Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” cried Valentine suddenly, “I understand. It is my marriage you\r\nmean, is it not, dear grandpapa?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, yes,” signed the paralytic, casting on Valentine a look of\r\njoyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning.\r\n\r\n30179m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You are angry with us all on account of this marriage, are you not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Really, this is too absurd,” said Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, sir,” replied the notary; “on the contrary, the meaning of\r\nM. Noirtier is quite evident to me, and I can quite easily connect the\r\ntrain of ideas passing in his mind.”\r\n\r\n“You do not wish me to marry M. Franz d’Épinay?” observed Valentine.\r\n\r\n“I do not wish it,” said the eye of her grandfather.\r\n\r\n“And you disinherit your granddaughter,” continued the notary, “because\r\nshe has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“So that, but for this marriage, she would have been your heir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThere was a profound silence. The two notaries were holding a\r\nconsultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair.\r\nValentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense\r\ngratitude, and Villefort was biting his lips with vexation, while\r\nMadame de Villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling\r\nof joy, which, in spite of herself, appeared in her whole countenance.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Villefort, who was the first to break the silence, “I\r\nconsider that I am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in\r\nquestion. I am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my\r\ndaughter’s hand. It is my wish that she should marry M. Franz\r\nd’Épinay—and she shall marry him.”\r\n\r\nValentine sank weeping into a chair.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the notary, “how do you intend disposing of your fortune in\r\ncase Mademoiselle de Villefort still determines on marrying M. Franz?”\r\nThe old man gave no answer.\r\n\r\n“You will, of course, dispose of it in some way or other?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“In favor of some member of your family?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes, then?” pursued the\r\nnotary.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said the notary, “you are aware that the law does not allow a\r\nson to be entirely deprived of his patrimony?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You only intend, then, to dispose of that part of your fortune which\r\nthe law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son?”\r\nNoirtier made no answer.\r\n\r\n“Do you still wish to dispose of all?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But they will contest the will after your death?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“My father knows me,” replied Villefort; “he is quite sure that his\r\nwishes will be held sacred by me; besides, he understands that in my\r\nposition I cannot plead against the poor.” The eye of Noirtier beamed\r\nwith triumph.\r\n\r\n“What do you decide on, sir?” asked the notary of Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, sir; it is a resolution which my father has taken and I know\r\nhe never alters his mind. I am quite resigned. These 900,000 francs\r\nwill go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital; but it is\r\nridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man, and I shall,\r\ntherefore, act according to my conscience.”\r\n\r\nHaving said this, Villefort quitted the room with his wife, leaving his\r\nfather at liberty to do as he pleased. The same day the will was made,\r\nthe witnesses were brought, it was approved by the old man, sealed in\r\nthe presence of all and given in charge to M. Deschamps, the family\r\nnotary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 60. The Telegraph\r\n\r\nM. and Madame de Villefort found on their return that the Count of\r\nMonte Cristo, who had come to visit them in their absence, had been\r\nushered into the drawing-room, and was still awaiting them there.\r\nMadame de Villefort, who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her\r\nlate emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately,\r\nretired to her bedroom, while the procureur, who could better depend\r\nupon himself, proceeded at once to the salon.\r\n\r\nAlthough M. de Villefort flattered himself that, to all outward view,\r\nhe had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind,\r\nhe did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow, so much\r\nso that the count, whose smile was radiant, immediately noticed his\r\nsombre and thoughtful air.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_” said Monte Cristo, after the first compliments were over,\r\n“what is the matter with you, M. de Villefort? Have I arrived at the\r\nmoment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime?”\r\n\r\nVillefort tried to smile.\r\n\r\n“No, count,” he replied, “I am the only victim in this case. It is I\r\nwho lose my cause, and it is ill-luck, obstinacy, and folly which have\r\ncaused it to be decided against me.”\r\n\r\n“To what do you refer?” said Monte Cristo with well-feigned interest.\r\n“Have you really met with some great misfortune?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, monsieur,” said Villefort with a bitter smile; “it is only a\r\nloss of money which I have sustained—nothing worth mentioning, I assure\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Monte Cristo, “the loss of a sum of money becomes almost\r\nimmaterial with a fortune such as you possess, and to one of your\r\nphilosophic spirit.”\r\n\r\n“It is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me,” said\r\nVillefort, “though, after all, 900,000 francs are worth regretting; but\r\nI am the more annoyed with this fate, chance, or whatever you please to\r\ncall the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune, and may\r\nblast the prospects of my child also, as it is all occasioned by an old\r\nman relapsed into second childhood.”\r\n\r\n30183m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What do you say?” said the count; “900,000 francs? It is indeed a sum\r\nwhich might be regretted even by a philosopher. And who is the cause of\r\nall this annoyance?”\r\n\r\n“My father, as I told you.”\r\n\r\n“M. Noirtier? But I thought you told me he had become entirely\r\nparalyzed, and that all his faculties were completely destroyed?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, his bodily faculties, for he can neither move nor speak,\r\nnevertheless he thinks, acts, and wills in the manner I have described.\r\nI left him about five minutes ago, and he is now occupied in dictating\r\nhis will to two notaries.”\r\n\r\n“But to do this he must have spoken?”\r\n\r\n“He has done better than that—he has made himself understood.”\r\n\r\n“How was such a thing possible?”\r\n\r\n“By the help of his eyes, which are still full of life, and, as you\r\nperceive, possess the power of inflicting mortal injury.”\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said Madame de Villefort, who had just entered the room,\r\n“perhaps you exaggerate the evil.”\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, madame,” said the count, bowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most\r\ngracious smiles.\r\n\r\n“What is this that M. de Villefort has been telling me?” demanded Monte\r\nCristo “and what incomprehensible misfortune——”\r\n\r\n“Incomprehensible is the word!” interrupted the procureur, shrugging\r\nhis shoulders. “It is an old man’s caprice!”\r\n\r\n“And is there no means of making him revoke his decision?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Madame de Villefort; “and it is still entirely in the power\r\nof my husband to cause the will, which is now in prejudice of\r\nValentine, to be altered in her favor.”\r\n\r\nThe count, who perceived that M. and Madame de Villefort were beginning\r\nto speak in parables, appeared to pay no attention to the conversation,\r\nand feigned to be busily engaged in watching Edward, who was\r\nmischievously pouring some ink into the bird’s water-glass.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said Villefort, in answer to his wife, “you know I have\r\nnever been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family, nor have I\r\never considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my\r\nnod. Nevertheless, it is necessary that my will should be respected in\r\nmy family, and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child\r\nshould not be allowed to overturn a project which I have entertained\r\nfor so many years. The Baron d’Épinay was my friend, as you know, and\r\nan alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly\r\nbe arranged.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think,” said Madame de Villefort, “that Valentine is in league\r\nwith him? She has always been opposed to this marriage, and I should\r\nnot be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing\r\nbut the execution of a plan concerted between them.”\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said Villefort, “believe me, a fortune of 900,000 francs is\r\nnot so easily renounced.”\r\n\r\n“She could, nevertheless, make up her mind to renounce the world, sir,\r\nsince it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a\r\nconvent.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” replied Villefort; “I say that this marriage _shall_ be\r\nconsummated.”\r\n\r\n“Notwithstanding your father’s wishes to the contrary?” said Madame de\r\nVillefort, selecting a new point of attack. “That is a serious thing.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo, who pretended not to be listening, heard however, every\r\nword that was said.\r\n\r\n30185m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Madame,” replied Villefort “I can truly say that I have always\r\nentertained a high respect for my father, because, to the natural\r\nfeeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral\r\nsuperiority. The name of father is sacred in two senses; he should be\r\nreverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to\r\nobey. But, under the present circumstances, I am justified in doubting\r\nthe wisdom of an old man who, because he hated the father, vents his\r\nanger on the son. It would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct\r\nby such caprices. I shall still continue to preserve the same respect\r\ntoward M. Noirtier; I will suffer, without complaint, the pecuniary\r\ndeprivation to which he has subjected me; but I shall remain firm in my\r\ndetermination, and the world shall see which party has reason on his\r\nside. Consequently I shall marry my daughter to the Baron Franz\r\nd’Épinay, because I consider it would be a proper and eligible match\r\nfor her to make, and, in short, because I choose to bestow my\r\ndaughter’s hand on whomever I please.”\r\n\r\n“What?” said the count, the approbation of whose eye Villefort had\r\nfrequently solicited during this speech. “What? Do you say that M.\r\nNoirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to\r\nmarry M. le Baron Franz d’Épinay?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, that is the reason,” said Villefort, shrugging his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n“The apparent reason, at least,” said Madame de Villefort.\r\n\r\n“The _real_ reason, madame, I can assure you; I know my father.”\r\n\r\n“But I want to know in what way M. d’Épinay can have displeased your\r\nfather more than any other person?”\r\n\r\n“I believe I know M. Franz d’Épinay,” said the count; “is he not the\r\nson of General de Quesnel, who was created Baron d’Épinay by Charles\r\nX.?”\r\n\r\n“The same,” said Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Well, but he is a charming young man, according to my ideas.”\r\n\r\n“He is, which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of M. Noirtier\r\nto prevent his granddaughter marrying; old men are always so selfish in\r\ntheir affection,” said Madame de Villefort.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Monte Cristo “do you not know any cause for this hatred?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, _ma foi!_ who is to know?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it is some political difference?”\r\n\r\n“My father and the Baron d’Épinay lived in the stormy times of which I\r\nonly saw the ending,” said Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Was not your father a Bonapartist?” asked Monte Cristo; “I think I\r\nremember that you told me something of that kind.”\r\n\r\n“My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else,” said Villefort,\r\ncarried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence; “and the\r\nsenator’s robe, which Napoleon cast on his shoulders, only served to\r\ndisguise the old man without in any degree changing him. When my father\r\nconspired, it was not for the emperor, it was against the Bourbons; for\r\nM. Noirtier possessed this peculiarity, he never projected any Utopian\r\nschemes which could never be realized, but strove for possibilities,\r\nand he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible\r\ntheories of The Mountain,—theories that never shrank from any means\r\nthat were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Monte Cristo, “it is just as I thought; it was politics\r\nwhich brought Noirtier and M. d’Épinay into personal contact. Although\r\nGeneral d’Épinay served under Napoleon, did he not still retain\r\nroyalist sentiments? And was he not the person who was assassinated one\r\nevening on leaving a Bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited\r\non the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor?”\r\n\r\nVillefort looked at the count almost with terror.\r\n\r\n“Am I mistaken, then?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“No, sir, the facts were precisely what you have stated,” said Madame\r\nde Villefort; “and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that M.\r\nde Villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the\r\ntwo children of these inveterate enemies.”\r\n\r\n“It was a sublime and charitable thought,” said Monte Cristo, “and the\r\nwhole world should applaud it. It would be noble to see Mademoiselle\r\nNoirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz d’Épinay.”\r\n\r\nVillefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read\r\nin his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he\r\nhad just uttered. But the count completely baffled the procureur, and\r\nprevented him from discovering anything beneath the never-varying smile\r\nhe was so constantly in the habit of assuming.\r\n\r\n“Although,” said Villefort, “it will be a serious thing for Valentine\r\nto lose her grandfather’s fortune, I do not think that M. d’Épinay will\r\nbe frightened at this pecuniary loss. He will, perhaps, hold me in\r\ngreater esteem than the money itself, seeing that I sacrifice\r\neverything in order to keep my word with him. Besides, he knows that\r\nValentine is rich in right of her mother, and that she will, in all\r\nprobability, inherit the fortune of M. and Madame de Saint-Méran, her\r\nmother’s parents, who both love her tenderly.”\r\n\r\n“And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as M. Noirtier,”\r\nsaid Madame de Villefort; “besides, they are to come to Paris in about\r\na month, and Valentine, after the affront she has received, need not\r\nconsider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut\r\nup with M. Noirtier.”\r\n\r\nThe count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self-love\r\nand defeated ambition.\r\n\r\n“But it seems to me,” said Monte Cristo, “and I must begin by asking\r\nyour pardon for what I am about to say, that if M. Noirtier disinherits\r\nMademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose\r\nfather he detested, he cannot have the same cause of complaint against\r\nthis dear Edward.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Madame de Villefort, with an intonation of voice which it\r\nis impossible to describe; “is it not unjust—shamefully unjust? Poor\r\nEdward is as much M. Noirtier’s grandchild as Valentine, and yet, if\r\nshe had not been going to marry M. Franz, M. Noirtier would have left\r\nher all his money; and supposing Valentine to be disinherited by her\r\ngrandfather, she will still be three times richer than he.”\r\n\r\nThe count listened and said no more.\r\n\r\n“Count,” said Villefort, “we will not entertain you any longer with our\r\nfamily misfortunes. It is true that my patrimony will go to endow\r\ncharitable institutions, and my father will have deprived me of my\r\nlawful inheritance without any reason for doing so, but I shall have\r\nthe satisfaction of knowing that I have acted like a man of sense and\r\nfeeling. M. d’Épinay, to whom I had promised the interest of this sum,\r\nshall receive it, even if I endure the most cruel privations.”\r\n\r\n“However,” said Madame de Villefort, returning to the one idea which\r\nincessantly occupied her mind, “perhaps it would be better to explain\r\nthis unlucky affair to M. d’Épinay, in order to give him the\r\nopportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of Mademoiselle\r\nde Villefort.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that would be a great pity,” said Villefort.\r\n\r\n“A great pity,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” said Villefort, moderating the tones of his voice, “a\r\nmarriage once concerted and then broken off, throws a sort of discredit\r\non a young lady; then again, the old reports, which I was so anxious to\r\nput an end to, will instantly gain ground. No, it will all go well; M.\r\nd’Épinay, if he is an honorable man, will consider himself more than\r\never pledged to Mademoiselle de Villefort, unless he were actuated by a\r\ndecided feeling of avarice, but that is impossible.”\r\n\r\n“I agree with M. de Villefort,” said Monte Cristo, fixing his eyes on\r\nMadame de Villefort; “and if I were sufficiently intimate with him to\r\nallow of giving my advice, I would persuade him, since I have been told\r\nM. d’Épinay is coming back, to settle this affair at once beyond all\r\npossibility of revocation. I will answer for the success of a project\r\nwhich will reflect so much honor on M. de Villefort.”\r\n\r\nThe procureur arose, delighted with the proposition, but his wife\r\nslightly changed color.\r\n\r\n“Well, that is all that I wanted, and I will be guided by a counsellor\r\nsuch as you are,” said he, extending his hand to Monte Cristo.\r\n“Therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it\r\nhad not happened, and as though we had never thought of such a thing as\r\na change in our original plans.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the count, “the world, unjust as it is, will be pleased\r\nwith your resolution; your friends will be proud of you, and M.\r\nd’Épinay, even if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any dowry,\r\nwhich he will not do, would be delighted with the idea of entering a\r\nfamily which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and\r\nfulfil a duty.”\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of these words, the count rose to depart.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to leave us, count?” said Madame de Villefort.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to say I must do so, madame, I only came to remind you of\r\nyour promise for Saturday.”\r\n\r\n“Did you fear that we should forget it?”\r\n\r\n“You are very good, madame, but M. de Villefort has so many important\r\nand urgent occupations.”\r\n\r\n“My husband has given me his word, sir,” said Madame de Villefort; “you\r\nhave just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose,\r\nand surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has\r\neverything to gain.”\r\n\r\n“And,” said Villefort, “is it at your house in the Champs-Élysées that\r\nyou receive your visitors?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Monte Cristo, “which is precisely the reason which renders\r\nyour kindness more meritorious,—it is in the country.”\r\n\r\n“In the country?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Where is it, then? Near Paris, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Very near, only half a league from the Barriers,—it is at Auteuil.”\r\n\r\n“At Auteuil?” said Villefort; “true, Madame de Villefort told me you\r\nlived at Auteuil, since it was to your house that she was taken. And in\r\nwhat part of Auteuil do you reside?”\r\n\r\n“Rue de la Fontaine.”\r\n\r\n“Rue de la Fontaine!” exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone; “at what\r\nnumber?”\r\n\r\n“No. 28.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” cried Villefort, “was it you who bought M. de Saint-Méran’s\r\nhouse!”\r\n\r\n“Did it belong to M. de Saint-Méran?” demanded Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Madame de Villefort; “and, would you believe it,\r\ncount——”\r\n\r\n“Believe what?”\r\n\r\n“You think this house pretty, do you not?”\r\n\r\n“I think it charming.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my husband would never live in it.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” returned Monte Cristo, “that is a prejudice on your part, M.\r\nde Villefort, for which I am quite at a loss to account.”\r\n\r\n“I do not like Auteuil, sir,” said the procureur, making an evident\r\neffort to appear calm.\r\n\r\n“But I hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me\r\nof the pleasure of your company, sir,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“No, count,—I hope—I assure you I shall do my best,” stammered\r\nVillefort.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Monte Cristo, “I allow of no excuse. On Saturday, at six\r\no’clock. I shall be expecting you, and if you fail to come, I shall\r\nthink—for how do I know to the contrary?—that this house, which has\r\nremained uninhabited for twenty years, must have some gloomy tradition\r\nor dreadful legend connected with it.”\r\n\r\n“I will come, count,—I will be sure to come,” said Villefort eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Monte Cristo; “now you must permit me to take my\r\nleave of you.”\r\n\r\n“You said before that you were obliged to leave us, monsieur,” said\r\nMadame de Villefort, “and you were about to tell us why when your\r\nattention was called to some other subject.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed madame,” said Monte Cristo: “I scarcely know if I dare tell you\r\nwhere I am going.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense; say on.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, it is to see a thing on which I have sometimes mused for\r\nhours together.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“A telegraph. So now I have told my secret.”\r\n\r\n“A telegraph?” repeated Madame de Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Yes, a telegraph. I had often seen one placed at the end of a road on\r\na hillock, and in the light of the sun its black arms, bending in every\r\ndirection, always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle, and I\r\nassure you it was never without emotion that I gazed on it, for I could\r\nnot help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should\r\nbe made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the\r\ndistance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting\r\nat a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at\r\nthe opposite extremity, and all this effected by a simple act of\r\nvolition on the part of the sender of the message. I began to think of\r\ngenii, sylphs, gnomes, in short, of all the ministers of the occult\r\nsciences, until I laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination.\r\nNow, it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these\r\nlarge insects, with their long black claws, for I always feared to find\r\nunder their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with\r\ncabals, factions, and government intrigues. But one fine day I learned\r\nthat the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch, hired for\r\ntwelve hundred francs a year, and employed all day, not in studying the\r\nheavens like an astronomer, or in gazing on the water like an angler,\r\nor even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him,\r\nbut all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white-bellied,\r\nblack-clawed fellow insect, four or five leagues distant from him. At\r\nlength I felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely, and\r\nto endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insect-actors\r\nwhen they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of\r\nstring.”\r\n\r\n30191m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“And are you going there?”\r\n\r\n“I am.”\r\n\r\n“What telegraph do you intend visiting? that of the home department, or\r\nof the observatory?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; I should find there people who would force me to understand\r\nthings of which I would prefer to remain ignorant, and who would try to\r\nexplain to me, in spite of myself, a mystery which even they do not\r\nunderstand. _Ma foi!_ I should wish to keep my illusions concerning\r\ninsects unimpaired; it is quite enough to have those dissipated which I\r\nhad formed of my fellow-creatures. I shall, therefore, not visit either\r\nof these telegraphs, but one in the open country where I shall find a\r\ngood-natured simpleton, who knows no more than the machine he is\r\nemployed to work.”\r\n\r\n“You are a singular man,” said Villefort.\r\n\r\n“What line would you advise me to study?”\r\n\r\n“The one that is most in use just at this time.”\r\n\r\n“The Spanish one, you mean, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain\r\nto you——”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Monte Cristo; “since, as I told you before, I do not wish to\r\ncomprehend it. The moment I understand it there will no longer exist a\r\ntelegraph for me; it will be nothing more than a sign from M. Duchâtel,\r\nor from M. Montalivet, transmitted to the prefect of Bayonne, mystified\r\nby two Greek words, _têle_, _graphein_. It is the insect with black\r\nclaws, and the awful word which I wish to retain in my imagination in\r\nall its purity and all its importance.”\r\n\r\n“Go then; for in the course of two hours it will be dark, and you will\r\nnot be able to see anything.”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_ you frighten me. Which is the nearest way? Bayonne?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; the road to Bayonne.”\r\n\r\n“And afterwards the road to Châtillon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“By the tower of Montlhéry, you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. Good-bye. On Saturday I will tell you my impressions\r\nconcerning the telegraph.”\r\n\r\nAt the door the count was met by the two notaries, who had just\r\ncompleted the act which was to disinherit Valentine, and who were\r\nleaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not\r\nfail of redounding considerably to their credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 61. How a Gardener May Get Rid of the Dormice that Eat His\r\n Peaches\r\n\r\nNot on the same night as he had stated, but the next morning, the Count\r\nof Monte Cristo went out by the Barrière d’Enfer, taking the road to\r\nOrléans. Leaving the village of Linas, without stopping at the\r\ntelegraph, which flourished its great bony arms as he passed, the count\r\nreached the tower of Montlhéry, situated, as everyone knows, upon the\r\nhighest point of the plain of that name. At the foot of the hill the\r\ncount dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path, about\r\neighteen inches wide; when he reached the summit he found himself\r\nstopped by a hedge, upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and\r\nwhite flowers.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure, and was not long\r\nin finding a little wooden gate, working on willow hinges, and fastened\r\nwith a nail and string. The count soon mastered the mechanism, the gate\r\nopened, and he then found himself in a little garden, about twenty feet\r\nlong by twelve wide, bounded on one side by part of the hedge, which\r\ncontained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate, and on the\r\nother by the old tower, covered with ivy and studded with wall-flowers.\r\n\r\nNo one would have thought in looking at this old, weather-beaten,\r\nfloral-decked tower (which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed\r\nup to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast) that it would have\r\nbeen capable of telling strange things, if,—in addition to the menacing\r\nears which the proverb says all walls are provided with,—it had also a\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nThe garden was crossed by a path of red gravel, edged by a border of\r\nthick box, of many years’ growth, and of a tone and color that would\r\nhave delighted the heart of Delacroix, our modern Rubens. This path was\r\nformed in the shape of the figure of 8, thus, in its windings, making a\r\nwalk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty.\r\n\r\nNever had Flora, the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners, been\r\nhonored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was\r\npaid to her in this little enclosure. In fact, of the twenty rose-trees\r\nwhich formed the _parterre_, not one bore the mark of the slug, nor\r\nwere there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so\r\ndestructive to plants growing in a damp soil. And yet it was not\r\nbecause the damp had been excluded from the garden; the earth, black as\r\nsoot, the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence; besides,\r\nhad natural humidity been wanting, it could have been immediately\r\nsupplied by artificial means, thanks to a tank of water, sunk in one of\r\nthe corners of the garden, and upon which were stationed a frog and a\r\ntoad, who, from antipathy, no doubt, always remained on the two\r\nopposite sides of the basin. There was not a blade of grass to be seen\r\nin the paths, or a weed in the flower-beds; no fine lady ever trained\r\nand watered her geraniums, her cacti, and her rhododendrons, in her\r\nporcelain _jardinière_ with more pains than this hitherto unseen\r\ngardener bestowed upon his little enclosure.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the\r\nstring to the nail, and cast a look around.\r\n\r\n“The man at the telegraph,” said he, “must either engage a gardener or\r\ndevote himself passionately to agriculture.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow\r\nfilled with leaves; the something rose, uttering an exclamation of\r\nastonishment, and Monte Cristo found himself facing a man about fifty\r\nyears old, who was plucking strawberries, which he was placing upon\r\ngrape leaves. He had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries,\r\nwhich, on rising suddenly, he let fall from his hand.\r\n\r\n“You are gathering your crop, sir?” said Monte Cristo, smiling.\r\n\r\n30193m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, sir,” replied the man, raising his hand to his cap; “I am\r\nnot up there, I know, but I have only just come down.”\r\n\r\n“Do not let me interfere with you in anything, my friend,” said the\r\ncount; “gather your strawberries, if, indeed, there are any left.”\r\n\r\n“I have ten left,” said the man, “for here are eleven, and I had\r\ntwenty-one, five more than last year. But I am not surprised; the\r\nspring has been warm this year, and strawberries require heat, sir.\r\nThis is the reason that, instead of the sixteen I had last year, I have\r\nthis year, you see, eleven, already plucked—twelve, thirteen, fourteen,\r\nfifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. Ah, I miss three, they were here\r\nlast night, sir—I am sure they were here—I counted them. It must be the\r\nson of Mère Simon who has stolen them; I saw him strolling about here\r\nthis morning. Ah, the young rascal—stealing in a garden—he does not\r\nknow where that may lead him to.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, it is wrong,” said Monte Cristo, “but you should take into\r\nconsideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said the gardener, “but that does not make it the less\r\nunpleasant. But, sir, once more I beg pardon; perhaps you are an\r\nofficer that I am detaining here.” And he glanced timidly at the\r\ncount’s blue coat.\r\n\r\n30197m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Calm yourself, my friend,” said the count, with the smile which he\r\nmade at will either terrible or benevolent, and which now expressed\r\nonly the kindliest feeling; “I am not an inspector, but a traveller,\r\nbrought here by a curiosity he half repents of, since he causes you to\r\nlose your time.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my time is not valuable,” replied the man with a melancholy smile.\r\n“Still it belongs to government, and I ought not to waste it; but,\r\nhaving received the signal that I might rest for an hour” (here he\r\nglanced at the sun-dial, for there was everything in the enclosure of\r\nMontlhéry, even a sun-dial), “and having ten minutes before me, and my\r\nstrawberries being ripe, when a day longer—by-the-by, sir, do you think\r\ndormice eat them?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I should think not,” replied Monte Cristo; “dormice are bad\r\nneighbors for us who do not eat them preserved, as the Romans did.”\r\n\r\n“What? Did the Romans eat them?” said the gardener—“ate dormice?”\r\n\r\n“I have read so in Petronius,” said the count.\r\n\r\n“Really? They can’t be nice, though they do say ‘as fat as a dormouse.’\r\nIt is not a wonder they are fat, sleeping all day, and only waking to\r\neat all night. Listen. Last year I had four apricots—they stole one, I\r\nhad one nectarine, only one—well, sir, they ate half of it on the wall;\r\na splendid nectarine—I never ate a better.”\r\n\r\n“You ate it?”\r\n\r\n“That is to say, the half that was left—you understand; it was\r\nexquisite, sir. Ah, those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels;\r\nlike Mère Simon’s son, who has not chosen the worst strawberries. But\r\nthis year,” continued the horticulturist, “I’ll take care it shall not\r\nhappen, even if I should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch\r\nwhen the strawberries are ripe.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo had seen enough. Every man has a devouring passion in his\r\nheart, as every fruit has its worm; that of the telegraph man was\r\nhorticulture. He began gathering the grape-leaves which screened the\r\nsun from the grapes, and won the heart of the gardener.\r\n\r\n“Did you come here, sir, to see the telegraph?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if it isn’t contrary to the rules.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” said the gardener; “not in the least, since there is no\r\ndanger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying.”\r\n\r\n“I have been told,” said the count, “that you do not always yourselves\r\nunderstand the signals you repeat.”\r\n\r\n“That is true, sir, and that is what I like best,” said the man,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n“Why do you like that best?”\r\n\r\n“Because then I have no responsibility. I am a machine then, and\r\nnothing else, and so long as I work, nothing more is required of me.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible,” said Monte Cristo to himself, “that I can have met\r\nwith a man that has no ambition? That would spoil my plans.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the gardener, glancing at the sun-dial, “the ten minutes\r\nare almost up; I must return to my post. Will you go up with me?”\r\n\r\n“I follow you.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo entered the tower, which was divided into three stories.\r\nThe tower contained implements, such as spades, rakes, watering-pots,\r\nhung against the wall; this was all the furniture. The second was the\r\nman’s conventional abode, or rather sleeping-place; it contained a few\r\npoor articles of household furniture—a bed, a table, two chairs, a\r\nstone pitcher—and some dry herbs, hung up to the ceiling, which the\r\ncount recognized as sweet peas, and of which the good man was\r\npreserving the seeds; he had labelled them with as much care as if he\r\nhad been master botanist in the Jardin des Plantes.\r\n\r\n“Does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing?” asked\r\nMonte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“The study does not take long; it was acting as a supernumerary that\r\nwas so tedious.”\r\n\r\n“And what is the pay?”\r\n\r\n“A thousand francs, sir.”\r\n\r\n“It is nothing.”\r\n\r\n“No; but then we are lodged, as you perceive.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo looked at the room. They passed to the third story; it was\r\nthe telegraph room. Monte Cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles\r\nby which the machine was worked. “It is very interesting,” he said,\r\n“but it must be very tedious for a lifetime.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. At first my neck was cramped with looking at it, but at the end\r\nof a year I became used to it; and then we have our hours of\r\nrecreation, and our holidays.”\r\n\r\n“Holidays?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“When we have a fog.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, to be sure.”\r\n\r\n“Those are indeed holidays to me; I go into the garden, I plant, I\r\nprune, I trim, I kill the insects all day long.”\r\n\r\n“How long have you been here?”\r\n\r\n“Ten years, and five as a supernumerary make fifteen.”\r\n\r\n“You are——”\r\n\r\n“Fifty-five years old.”\r\n\r\n“How long must you have served to claim the pension?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir, twenty-five years.”\r\n\r\n“And how much is the pension?”\r\n\r\n“A hundred crowns.”\r\n\r\n“Poor humanity!” murmured Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“What did you say, sir?” asked the man.\r\n\r\n“I was saying it was very interesting.”\r\n\r\n“What was?”\r\n\r\n“All you were showing me. And you really understand none of these\r\nsignals?”\r\n\r\n“None at all.”\r\n\r\n“And have you never tried to understand them?”\r\n\r\n“Never. Why should I?”\r\n\r\n“But still there are some signals only addressed to you.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“And do you understand them?”\r\n\r\n“They are always the same.”\r\n\r\n“And they mean——”\r\n\r\n“‘_Nothing new; You have an hour;_’ or ‘_Tomorrow_.’”\r\n\r\n“This is simple enough,” said the count; “but look, is not your\r\ncorrespondent putting itself in motion?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes; thank you, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And what is it saying—anything you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it asks if I am ready.”\r\n\r\n“And you reply?”\r\n\r\n“By the same sign, which, at the same time, tells my right-hand\r\ncorrespondent that I am ready, while it gives notice to my left-hand\r\ncorrespondent to prepare in his turn.”\r\n\r\n“It is very ingenious,” said the count.\r\n\r\n“You will see,” said the man proudly; “in five minutes he will speak.”\r\n\r\n“I have, then, five minutes,” said Monte Cristo to himself; “it is more\r\ntime than I require. My dear sir, will you allow me to ask you a\r\nquestion?”\r\n\r\n“What is it, sir?”\r\n\r\n“You are fond of gardening?”\r\n\r\n“Passionately.”\r\n\r\n“And you would be pleased to have, instead of this terrace of twenty\r\nfeet, an enclosure of two acres?”\r\n\r\n“Sir, I should make a terrestrial paradise of it.”\r\n\r\n“You live badly on your thousand francs?”\r\n\r\n“Badly enough; but yet I do live.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but you have a wretchedly small garden.”\r\n\r\n“True, the garden is not large.”\r\n\r\n“And, then, such as it is, it is filled with dormice, who eat\r\neverything.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, they are my scourges.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your\r\nright-hand correspondent was telegraphing——”\r\n\r\n“I should not see him.”\r\n\r\n“Then what would happen?”\r\n\r\n“I could not repeat the signals.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“Not having repeated them, through negligence, I should be fined.”\r\n\r\n“How much?”\r\n\r\n“A hundred francs.”\r\n\r\n“The tenth of your income—that would be fine work.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the man.\r\n\r\n“Has it ever happened to you?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Once, sir, when I was grafting a rose-tree.”\r\n\r\n“Well, suppose you were to alter a signal, and substitute another?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that is another case; I should be turned off, and lose my\r\npension.”\r\n\r\n“Three hundred francs?”\r\n\r\n“A hundred crowns, yes, sir; so you see that I am not likely to do any\r\nof these things.”\r\n\r\n“Not even for fifteen years’ wages? Come, it is worth thinking about?”\r\n\r\n“For fifteen thousand francs?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, you alarm me.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, you are tempting me?”\r\n\r\n“Just so; fifteen thousand francs, do you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Sir, let me see my right-hand correspondent.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, do not look at him, but at this.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“What? Do you not know these bits of paper?”\r\n\r\n“Bank-notes!”\r\n\r\n“Exactly; there are fifteen of them.”\r\n\r\n“And whose are they?”\r\n\r\n“Yours, if you like.”\r\n\r\n“Mine?” exclaimed the man, half-suffocated.\r\n\r\n“Yes; yours—your own property.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, my right-hand correspondent is signalling.”\r\n\r\n“Let him signal.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, you have distracted me; I shall be fined.”\r\n\r\n“That will cost you a hundred francs; you see it is your interest to\r\ntake my bank-notes.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, my right-hand correspondent redoubles his signals; he is\r\nimpatient.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind—take these;” and the count placed the packet in the man’s\r\nhands. “Now this is not all,” he said; “you cannot live upon your\r\nfifteen thousand francs.”\r\n\r\n“I shall still have my place.”\r\n\r\n“No, you will lose it, for you are going to alter your correspondent’s\r\nmessage.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir, what are you proposing?”\r\n\r\n“A jest.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, unless you force me——”\r\n\r\n“I think I can effectually force you;” and Monte Cristo drew another\r\npacket from his pocket. “Here are ten thousand more francs,” he said,\r\n“with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket, they will make\r\ntwenty-five thousand. With five thousand you can buy a pretty little\r\nhouse with two acres of land; the remaining twenty thousand will bring\r\nyou in a thousand francs a year.”\r\n\r\n“A garden with two acres of land!”\r\n\r\n“And a thousand francs a year.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, heavens!”\r\n\r\n“Come, take them,” and Monte Cristo forced the bank-notes into his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“What am I to do?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing very difficult.”\r\n\r\n“But what is it?”\r\n\r\n“To repeat these signs.” Monte Cristo took a paper from his pocket,\r\nupon which were drawn three signs, with numbers to indicate the order\r\nin which they were to be worked.\r\n\r\n“There, you see it will not take long.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but——”\r\n\r\n“Do this, and you will have nectarines and all the rest.”\r\n\r\nThe shot told; red with fever, while the large drops fell from his\r\nbrow, the man executed, one after the other, the three signs given by\r\nthe count, in spite of the frightful contortions of the right-hand\r\ncorrespondent, who, not understanding the change, began to think the\r\ngardener had gone mad. As to the left-hand one, he conscientiously\r\nrepeated the same signals, which were finally transmitted to the\r\nMinister of the Interior.\r\n\r\n“Now you are rich,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the man, “but at what a price!”\r\n\r\n“Listen, friend,” said Monte Cristo. “I do not wish to cause you any\r\nremorse; believe me, then, when I swear to you that you have wronged no\r\nman, but on the contrary have benefited mankind.”\r\n\r\nThe man looked at the bank-notes, felt them, counted them, turned pale,\r\nthen red, then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water, but he\r\nhad no time to reach the water-jug, and fainted in the midst of his\r\ndried herbs. Five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister,\r\nDebray had the horses put to his carriage, and drove to Danglars’\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n“Has your husband any Spanish bonds?” he asked of the baroness.\r\n\r\n“I think so, indeed! He has six millions’ worth.”\r\n\r\n“He must sell them at whatever price.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because Don Carlos has fled from Bourges, and has returned to Spain.”\r\n\r\n30203m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“How do you know?” Debray shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“The idea of asking how I hear the news,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe baroness did not wait for a repetition; she ran to her husband, who\r\nimmediately hastened to his agent, and ordered him to sell at any\r\nprice. When it was seen that Danglars sold, the Spanish funds fell\r\ndirectly. Danglars lost five hundred thousand francs; but he rid\r\nhimself of all his Spanish shares. The same evening the following was\r\nread in _Le Messager_:\r\n\r\n“[By telegraph.] The king, Don Carlos, has escaped the vigilance of his\r\nguardians at Bourges, and has returned to Spain by the Catalonian\r\nfrontier. Barcelona has risen in his favor.”\r\n\r\nAll that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of Danglars,\r\nwho had sold his shares, and of the luck of the stock-jobber, who only\r\nlost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow. Those who had kept\r\ntheir shares, or bought those of Danglars, looked upon themselves as\r\nruined, and passed a very bad night. Next morning _Le Moniteur_\r\ncontained the following:\r\n\r\n“It was without any foundation that _Le Messager_ yesterday announced\r\nthe flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of Barcelona. The king (Don\r\nCarlos) has not left Bourges, and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of\r\nprofound peace. A telegraphic signal, improperly interpreted, owing to\r\nthe fog, was the cause of this error.”\r\n\r\nThe funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen. This,\r\nreckoning his loss, and what he had missed gaining, made the difference\r\nof a million to Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Good,” said Monte Cristo to Morrel, who was at his house when the news\r\narrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which Danglars had been\r\nthe victim, “I have just made a discovery for twenty-five thousand\r\nfrancs, for which I would have paid a hundred thousand.”\r\n\r\n“What have you discovered?” asked Morrel.\r\n\r\n“I have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that\r\neat his peaches.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 62. Ghosts\r\n\r\nAt first sight, the exterior of the house at Auteuil gave no\r\nindications of splendor, nothing one would expect from the destined\r\nresidence of the magnificent Count of Monte Cristo; but this simplicity\r\nwas according to the will of its master, who positively ordered nothing\r\nto be altered outside. The splendor was within. Indeed, almost before\r\nthe door opened, the scene changed.\r\n\r\nM. Bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing,\r\nand in the rapidity with which it was executed. It is told that the Duc\r\nd’Antin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed\r\nLouis XIV.; in three days M. Bertuccio planted an entirely bare court\r\nwith poplars, large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of\r\nthe house, and in the foreground, instead of the usual paving-stones,\r\nhalf hidden by the grass, there extended a lawn but that morning laid\r\ndown, and upon which the water was yet glistening. For the rest, the\r\norders had been issued by the count; he himself had given a plan to\r\nBertuccio, marking the spot where each tree was to be planted, and the\r\nshape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the\r\npaving-stones.\r\n\r\nThus the house had become unrecognizable, and Bertuccio himself\r\ndeclared that he scarcely knew it, encircled as it was by a framework\r\nof trees. The overseer would not have objected, while he was about it,\r\nto have made some improvements in the garden, but the count had\r\npositively forbidden it to be touched. Bertuccio made amends, however,\r\nby loading the antechambers, staircases, and mantle-pieces with\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nWhat, above all, manifested the shrewdness of the steward, and the\r\nprofound science of the master, the one in carrying out the ideas of\r\nthe other, was that this house which appeared only the night before so\r\nsad and gloomy, impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy\r\nto be the smell of time, had in a single day acquired the aspect of\r\nlife, was scented with its master’s favorite perfumes, and had the very\r\nlight regulated according to his wish. When the count arrived, he had\r\nunder his touch his books and arms, his eyes rested upon his favorite\r\npictures; his dogs, whose caresses he loved, welcomed him in the\r\nantechamber; the birds, whose songs delighted him, cheered him with\r\ntheir music; and the house, awakened from its long sleep, like the\r\nsleeping beauty in the wood, lived, sang, and bloomed like the houses\r\nwe have long cherished, and in which, when we are forced to leave them,\r\nwe leave a part of our souls.\r\n\r\nThe servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard; some, belonging to\r\nthe kitchens, gliding down the stairs, restored but the previous day,\r\nas if they had always inhabited the house; others filling the\r\ncoach-houses, where the equipages, encased and numbered, appeared to\r\nhave been installed for the last fifty years; and in the stables the\r\nhorses replied with neighs to the grooms, who spoke to them with much\r\nmore respect than many servants pay their masters.\r\n\r\nThe library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall, and\r\ncontained upwards of two thousand volumes; one division was entirely\r\ndevoted to novels, and even the volume which had been published but the\r\nday before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red\r\nand gold binding.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the house, to match with the library, was the\r\nconservatory, ornamented with rare flowers, that bloomed in china jars;\r\nand in the midst of the greenhouse, marvellous alike to sight and\r\nsmell, was a billiard-table which looked as if it had been abandoned\r\nduring the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth.\r\n\r\nOne chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent Bertuccio.\r\nBefore this room, to which you could ascend by the grand, and go out by\r\nthe back staircase, the servants passed with curiosity, and Bertuccio\r\nwith terror.\r\n\r\nAt five o’clock precisely, the count arrived before the house at\r\nAuteuil, followed by Ali. Bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with\r\nimpatience, mingled with uneasiness; he hoped for some compliments,\r\nwhile, at the same time, he feared to have frowns. Monte Cristo\r\ndescended into the courtyard, walked all over the house, without giving\r\nany sign of approbation or pleasure, until he entered his bedroom,\r\nsituated on the opposite side to the closed room; then he approached a\r\nlittle piece of furniture, made of rosewood, which he had noticed at a\r\nprevious visit.\r\n\r\n“That can only be to hold gloves,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Will your excellency deign to open it?” said the delighted Bertuccio,\r\n“and you will find gloves in it.”\r\n\r\nElsewhere the count found everything he required—smelling-bottles,\r\ncigars, knick-knacks.\r\n\r\n30207m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Good,” he said; and M. Bertuccio left enraptured, so great, so\r\npowerful, and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who\r\nsurrounded him.\r\n\r\nAt precisely six o’clock the clatter of horses’ hoofs was heard at the\r\nentrance door; it was our captain of Spahis, who had arrived on Médéah.\r\n“I am sure I am the first,” cried Morrel; “I did it on purpose to have\r\nyou a minute to myself, before everyone came. Julie and Emmanuel have a\r\nthousand things to tell you. Ah, really this is magnificent! But tell\r\nme, count, will your people take care of my horse?”\r\n\r\n“Do not alarm yourself, my dear Maximilian—they understand.”\r\n\r\n“I mean, because he wants petting. If you had seen at what a pace he\r\ncame—like the wind!”\r\n\r\n“I should think so,—a horse that cost 5,000 francs!” said Monte Cristo,\r\nin the tone which a father would use towards a son.\r\n\r\n“Do you regret them?” asked Morrel, with his open laugh.\r\n\r\n“I? Certainly not,” replied the count. “No; I should only regret if the\r\nhorse had not proved good.”\r\n\r\n“It is so good, that I have distanced M. de Château-Renaud, one of the\r\nbest riders in France, and M. Debray, who both mount the minister’s\r\nArabians; and close on their heels are the horses of Madame Danglars,\r\nwho always go at six leagues an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Then they follow you?” asked Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“See, they are here.” And at the same minute a carriage with smoking\r\nhorses, accompanied by two mounted gentlemen, arrived at the gate,\r\nwhich opened before them. The carriage drove round, and stopped at the\r\nsteps, followed by the horsemen.\r\n\r\nThe instant Debray had touched the ground, he was at the carriage-door.\r\nHe offered his hand to the baroness, who, descending, took it with a\r\npeculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but Monte Cristo. But\r\nnothing escaped the count’s notice, and he observed a little note,\r\npassed with the facility that indicates frequent practice, from the\r\nhand of Madame Danglars to that of the minister’s secretary.\r\n\r\nAfter his wife the banker descended, as pale as though he had issued\r\nfrom his tomb instead of his carriage.\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be\r\ninterpreted by Monte Cristo, around the courtyard, over the peristyle,\r\nand across the front of the house, then, repressing a slight emotion,\r\nwhich must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her\r\ncolor, she ascended the steps, saying to Morrel:\r\n\r\n“Sir, if you were a friend of mine, I should ask you if you would sell\r\nyour horse.”\r\n\r\nMorrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace, and then turned\r\nround to Monte Cristo, as if to ask him to extricate him from his\r\nembarrassment. The count understood him.\r\n\r\n“Ah, madame,” he said, “why did you not make that request of me?”\r\n\r\n“With you, sir,” replied the baroness, “one can wish for nothing, one\r\nis so sure to obtain it. If it were so with M. Morrel——”\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately,” replied the count, “I am witness that M. Morrel cannot\r\ngive up his horse, his honor being engaged in keeping it.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“He laid a wager he would tame Médéah in the space of six months. You\r\nunderstand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time\r\nnamed, he would not only lose his bet, but people would say he was\r\nafraid; and a brave captain of Spahis cannot risk this, even to gratify\r\na pretty woman, which is, in my opinion, one of the most sacred\r\nobligations in the world.”\r\n\r\n“You see my position, madame,” said Morrel, bestowing a grateful smile\r\non Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Danglars, in his coarse tone, ill-concealed by a\r\nforced smile, “that you have already got horses enough.”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed,\r\nbut, to the surprise of the young people, she pretended not to hear it,\r\nand said nothing. Monte Cristo smiled at her unusual humility, and\r\nshowed her two immense porcelain jars, over which wound marine plants,\r\nof a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce. The baroness\r\nwas astonished.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said she, “you could plant one of the chestnut-trees in the\r\nTuileries inside! How can such enormous jars have been manufactured?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! madame,” replied Monte Cristo, “you must not ask of us, the\r\nmanufacturers of fine porcelain, such a question. It is the work of\r\nanother age, constructed by the genii of earth and water.”\r\n\r\n“How so?—at what period can that have been?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know; I have only heard that an emperor of China had an oven\r\nbuilt expressly, and that in this oven twelve jars like this were\r\nsuccessively baked. Two broke, from the heat of the fire; the other ten\r\nwere sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea. The sea, knowing\r\nwhat was required of her, threw over them her weeds, encircled them\r\nwith coral, and encrusted them with shells; the whole was cemented by\r\ntwo hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths, for a\r\nrevolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial, and\r\nonly left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their\r\ndescent into the sea. At the end of two hundred years the documents\r\nwere found, and they thought of bringing up the jars. Divers descended\r\nin machines, made expressly on the discovery, into the bay where they\r\nwere thrown; but of ten three only remained, the rest having been\r\nbroken by the waves. I am fond of these jars, upon which, perhaps,\r\nmisshapen, frightful monsters have fixed their cold, dull eyes, and in\r\nwhich myriads of small fish have slept, seeking a refuge from the\r\npursuit of their enemies.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Danglars, who had cared little for curiosities, was\r\nmechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange-tree, one\r\nafter another. When he had finished with the orange-tree, he began at\r\nthe cactus; but this, not being so easily plucked as the orange-tree,\r\npricked him dreadfully. He shuddered, and rubbed his eyes as though\r\nawaking from a dream.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Monte Cristo to him, “I do not recommend my pictures to\r\nyou, who possess such splendid paintings; but, nevertheless, here are\r\ntwo by Hobbema, a Paul Potter, a Mieris, two by Gerard Douw, a Raphael,\r\na Van Dyck, a Zurbaran, and two or three by Murillo, worth looking at.”\r\n\r\n“Stay,” said Debray; “I recognize this Hobbema.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it was proposed for the Museum.”\r\n\r\n“Which, I believe, does not contain one?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“No; and yet they refused to buy it.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” said Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“You pretend not to know,—because government was not rich enough.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, pardon me,” said Château-Renaud; “I have heard of these things\r\nevery day during the last eight years, and I cannot understand them\r\nyet.”\r\n\r\n“You will, by and by,” said Debray.\r\n\r\n“I think not,” replied Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and Count Andrea Cavalcanti,” announced\r\nBaptistin.\r\n\r\nA black satin stock, fresh from the maker’s hands, gray moustaches, a\r\nbold eye, a major’s uniform, ornamented with three medals and five\r\ncrosses—in fact, the thorough bearing of an old soldier—such was the\r\nappearance of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, that tender father with whom\r\nwe are already acquainted. Close to him, dressed in entirely new\r\nclothes, advanced smilingly Count Andrea Cavalcanti, the dutiful son,\r\nwhom we also know. The three young people were talking together. On the\r\nentrance of the new-comers, their eyes glanced from father to son, and\r\nthen, naturally enough, rested on the latter, whom they began\r\ncriticising.\r\n\r\n“Cavalcanti!” said Debray.\r\n\r\n“A fine name,” said Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Château-Renaud, “these Italians are well named and badly\r\ndressed.”\r\n\r\n“You are fastidious, Château-Renaud,” replied Debray; “those clothes\r\nare well cut and quite new.”\r\n\r\n“That is just what I find fault with. That gentleman appears to be well\r\ndressed for the first time in his life.”\r\n\r\n“Who are those gentlemen?” asked Danglars of Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“You heard—Cavalcanti.”\r\n\r\n“That tells me their name, and nothing else.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! true. You do not know the Italian nobility; the Cavalcanti are all\r\ndescended from princes.”\r\n\r\n“Have they any fortune?”\r\n\r\n“An enormous one.”\r\n\r\n“What do they do?”\r\n\r\n“Try to spend it all. They have some business with you, I think, from\r\nwhat they told me the day before yesterday. I, indeed, invited them\r\nhere today on your account. I will introduce you to them.”\r\n\r\n“But they appear to speak French with a very pure accent,” said\r\nDanglars.\r\n\r\n“The son has been educated in a college in the south; I believe near\r\nMarseilles. You will find him quite enthusiastic.”\r\n\r\n“Upon what subject?” asked Madame Danglars.\r\n\r\n“The French ladies, madame. He has made up his mind to take a wife from\r\nParis.”\r\n\r\n“A fine idea that of his,” said Danglars, shrugging his shoulders.\r\nMadame Danglars looked at her husband with an expression which, at any\r\nother time, would have indicated a storm, but for the second time she\r\ncontrolled herself.\r\n\r\n“The baron appears thoughtful today,” said Monte Cristo to her; “are\r\nthey going to put him in the ministry?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet, I think. More likely he has been speculating on the Bourse,\r\nand has lost money.”\r\n\r\n“M. and Madame de Villefort,” cried Baptistin.\r\n\r\nThey entered. M. de Villefort, notwithstanding his self-control, was\r\nvisibly affected, and when Monte Cristo touched his hand, he felt it\r\ntremble.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, women alone know how to dissimulate,” said Monte Cristo to\r\nhimself, glancing at Madame Danglars, who was smiling on the procureur,\r\nand embracing his wife.\r\n\r\nAfter a short time, the count saw Bertuccio, who, until then, had been\r\noccupied on the other side of the house, glide into an adjoining room.\r\nHe went to him.\r\n\r\n“What do you want, M. Bertuccio?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Your excellency has not stated the number of guests.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, true.”\r\n\r\n“How many covers?”\r\n\r\n“Count for yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Is everyone here, your excellency?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nBertuccio glanced through the door, which was ajar. The count watched\r\nhim. “Good heavens!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” said the count.\r\n\r\n“That woman—that woman!”\r\n\r\n“Which?”\r\n\r\n“The one with a white dress and so many diamonds—the fair one.”\r\n\r\n“Madame Danglars?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know her name; but it is she, sir, it is she!”\r\n\r\n“Whom do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“The woman of the garden!—she that was _enceinte_—she who was walking\r\nwhile she waited for——”\r\n\r\nBertuccio stood at the open door, with his eyes starting and his hair\r\non end.\r\n\r\n“Waiting for whom?” Bertuccio, without answering, pointed to Villefort\r\nwith something of the gesture Macbeth uses to point out Banquo.\r\n\r\n“Oh, oh!” he at length muttered, “do you see?”\r\n\r\n“What? Who?”\r\n\r\n“Him!”\r\n\r\n“Him!—M. de Villefort, the king’s attorney? Certainly I see him.”\r\n\r\n“Then I did not kill him?”\r\n\r\n“Really, I think you are going mad, good Bertuccio,” said the count.\r\n\r\n“Then he is not dead?”\r\n\r\n30213m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No; you see plainly he is not dead. Instead of striking between the\r\nsixth and seventh left ribs, as your countrymen do, you must have\r\nstruck higher or lower, and life is very tenacious in these lawyers, or\r\nrather there is no truth in anything you have told me—it was a fright\r\nof the imagination, a dream of your fancy. You went to sleep full of\r\nthoughts of vengeance; they weighed heavily upon your stomach; you had\r\nthe nightmare—that’s all. Come, calm yourself, and reckon them up—M.\r\nand Madame de Villefort, two; M. and Madame Danglars, four; M. de\r\nChâteau-Renaud, M. Debray, M. Morrel, seven; Major Bartolomeo\r\nCavalcanti, eight.”\r\n\r\n“Eight!” repeated Bertuccio.\r\n\r\n“Stop! You are in a shocking hurry to be off—you forget one of my\r\nguests. Lean a little to the left. Stay! look at M. Andrea Cavalcanti,\r\nthe young man in a black coat, looking at Murillo’s ‘Madonna’; now he\r\nis turning.”\r\n\r\nThis time Bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation, had not a look\r\nfrom Monte Cristo silenced him.\r\n\r\n“Benedetto?” he muttered; “fatality!”\r\n\r\n“Half-past six o’clock has just struck, M. Bertuccio,” said the count\r\nseverely; “I ordered dinner at that hour, and I do not like to wait;”\r\nand he returned to his guests, while Bertuccio, leaning against the\r\nwall, succeeded in reaching the dining-room. Five minutes afterwards\r\nthe doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, and Bertuccio appearing\r\nsaid, with a violent effort, “The dinner waits.”\r\n\r\nThe Count of Monte Cristo offered his arm to Madame de Villefort. “M.\r\nde Villefort,” he said, “will you conduct the Baroness Danglars?”\r\n\r\nVillefort complied, and they passed on to the dining-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 63. The Dinner\r\n\r\nIt was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering\r\nthe dining-room. Each one asked what strange influence had brought them\r\nto this house, and yet astonished, even uneasy though they were, they\r\nstill felt that they would not like to be absent. The recent events,\r\nthe solitary and eccentric position of the count, his enormous, nay,\r\nalmost incredible fortune, should have made men cautious, and have\r\naltogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of\r\ntheir own sex to receive them; and yet curiosity had been enough to\r\nlead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum.\r\n\r\nAnd all present, even including Cavalcanti and his son, notwithstanding\r\nthe stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other, were\r\nthoughtful, on finding themselves assembled at the house of this\r\nincomprehensible man. Madame Danglars had started when Villefort, on\r\nthe count’s invitation, offered his arm; and Villefort felt that his\r\nglance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles, when he felt the arm of\r\nthe baroness press upon his own. None of this had escaped the count,\r\nand even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already\r\nacquired considerable interest for an observer.\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort had on the right hand Madame Danglars, on his left\r\nMorrel. The count was seated between Madame de Villefort and Danglars;\r\nthe other seats were filled by Debray, who was placed between the two\r\nCavalcanti, and by Château-Renaud, seated between Madame de Villefort\r\nand Morrel.\r\n\r\nThe repast was magnificent; Monte Cristo had endeavored completely to\r\noverturn the Parisian ideas, and to feed the curiosity as much as the\r\nappetite of his guests. It was an Oriental feast that he offered to\r\nthem, but of such a kind as the Arabian fairies might be supposed to\r\nprepare. Every delicious fruit that the four quarters of the globe\r\ncould provide was heaped in vases from China and jars from Japan. Rare\r\nbirds, retaining their most brilliant plumage, enormous fish, spread\r\nupon massive silver dishes, together with every wine produced in the\r\nArchipelago, Asia Minor, or the Cape, sparkling in bottles, whose\r\ngrotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught,—all\r\nthese, like one of the displays with which Apicius of old gratified his\r\nguests, passed in review before the eyes of the astonished Parisians,\r\nwho understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a\r\ndinner for ten persons, but only on the condition of eating pearls,\r\nlike Cleopatra, or drinking refined gold, like Lorenzo de’ Medici.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo noticed the general astonishment, and began laughing and\r\njoking about it.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said, “you will admit that, when arrived at a certain\r\ndegree of fortune, the superfluities of life are all that can be\r\ndesired; and the ladies will allow that, after having risen to a\r\ncertain eminence of position, the ideal alone can be more exalted. Now,\r\nto follow out this reasoning, what is the marvellous?—that which we do\r\nnot understand. What is it that we really desire?—that which we cannot\r\nobtain. Now, to see things which I cannot understand, to procure\r\nimpossibilities, these are the study of my life. I gratify my wishes by\r\ntwo means—my will and my money. I take as much interest in the pursuit\r\nof some whim as you do, M. Danglars, in promoting a new railway line;\r\nyou, M. de Villefort, in condemning a culprit to death; you, M. Debray,\r\nin pacifying a kingdom; you, M. de Château-Renaud, in pleasing a woman;\r\nand you, Morrel, in breaking a horse that no one can ride. For example,\r\nyou see these two fish; one brought from fifty leagues beyond St.\r\nPetersburg, the other five leagues from Naples. Is it not amusing to\r\nsee them both on the same table?”\r\n\r\n“What are the two fish?” asked Danglars.\r\n\r\n“M. Château-Renaud, who has lived in Russia, will tell you the name of\r\none, and Major Cavalcanti, who is an Italian, will tell you the name of\r\nthe other.”\r\n\r\n“This one is, I think, a sterlet,” said Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“And that one, if I mistake not, a lamprey.”\r\n\r\n“Just so. Now, M. Danglars, ask these gentlemen where they are caught.”\r\n\r\n“Sterlets,” said Château-Renaud, “are only found in the Volga.”\r\n\r\n“And,” said Cavalcanti, “I know that Lake Fusaro alone supplies\r\nlampreys of that size.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly; one comes from the Volga, and the other from Lake Fusaro.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!” cried all the guests simultaneously.\r\n\r\n“Well, this is just what amuses me,” said Monte Cristo. “I am like\r\nNero—_cupitor impossibilium_; and that is what is amusing you at this\r\nmoment. This fish, which seems so exquisite to you, is very likely no\r\nbetter than perch or salmon; but it seemed impossible to procure it,\r\nand here it is.”\r\n\r\n“But how could you have these fish brought to France?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing more easy. Each fish was brought over in a cask—one filled\r\nwith river herbs and weeds, the other with rushes and lake plants; they\r\nwere placed in a wagon built on purpose, and thus the sterlet lived\r\ntwelve days, the lamprey eight, and both were alive when my cook seized\r\nthem, killing one with milk and the other with wine. You do not believe\r\nme, M. Danglars!”\r\n\r\n“I cannot help doubting,” answered Danglars with his stupid smile.\r\n\r\n“Baptistin,” said the count, “have the other fish brought in—the\r\nsterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks, and which are\r\nyet alive.”\r\n\r\nDanglars opened his bewildered eyes; the company clapped their hands.\r\nFour servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants, and in\r\neach of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table.\r\n\r\n“But why have two of each sort?” asked Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Merely because one might have died,” carelessly answered Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“You are certainly an extraordinary man,” said Danglars; “and\r\nphilosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich.”\r\n\r\n“And to have ideas,” added Madame Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Oh, do not give me credit for this, madame; it was done by the Romans,\r\nwho much esteemed them, and Pliny relates that they sent slaves from\r\nOstia to Rome, who carried on their heads fish which he calls the\r\n_mulus_, and which, from the description, must probably be the\r\ngoldfish. It was also considered a luxury to have them alive, it being\r\nan amusing sight to see them die, for, when dying, they change color\r\nthree or four times, and like the rainbow when it disappears, pass\r\nthrough all the prismatic shades, after which they were sent to the\r\nkitchen. Their agony formed part of their merit—if they were not seen\r\nalive, they were despised when dead.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Debray, “but then Ostia is only a few leagues from Rome.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Monte Cristo; “but what would be the use of living\r\neighteen hundred years after Lucullus, if we can do no better than he\r\ncould?”\r\n\r\nThe two Cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes, but had the good sense\r\nnot to say anything.\r\n\r\n“All this is very extraordinary,” said Château-Renaud; “still, what I\r\nadmire the most, I confess, is the marvellous promptitude with which\r\nyour orders are executed. Is it not true that you only bought this\r\nhouse five or six days ago?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not longer.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I am sure it is quite transformed since last week. If I remember\r\nrightly, it had another entrance, and the courtyard was paved and\r\nempty; while today we have a splendid lawn, bordered by trees which\r\nappear to be a hundred years old.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? I am fond of grass and shade,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Madame de Villefort, “the door was towards the road before,\r\nand on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house\r\nfrom the road, I remember.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame,” said Monte Cristo; “but I preferred having an entrance\r\nwhich would allow me to see the Bois de Boulogne over my gate.”\r\n\r\n“In four days,” said Morrel; “it is extraordinary!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said Château-Renaud, “it seems quite miraculous to make a new\r\nhouse out of an old one; for it was very old, and dull too. I recollect\r\ncoming for my mother to look at it when M. de Saint-Méran advertised it\r\nfor sale two or three years ago.”\r\n\r\n“M. de Saint-Méran?” said Madame de Villefort; “then this house\r\nbelonged to M. de Saint-Méran before you bought it?”\r\n\r\n“It appears so,” replied Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it?”\r\n\r\n“Quite so; my steward transacts all this business for me.”\r\n\r\n“It is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied,” said\r\nChâteau-Renaud, “and it was quite melancholy to look at it, with the\r\nblinds closed, the doors locked, and the weeds in the court. Really, if\r\nthe house had not belonged to the father-in-law of the procureur, one\r\nmight have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had\r\nbeen committed.”\r\n\r\nVillefort, who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of\r\nrare wine which were placed before him, here took one, and drank it\r\noff. Monte Cristo allowed a short time to elapse, and then said:\r\n\r\n“It is singular, baron, but the same idea came across me the first time\r\nI came here; it looked so gloomy I should never have bought it if my\r\nsteward had not taken the matter into his own hands. Perhaps the fellow\r\nhad been bribed by the notary.”\r\n\r\n“It is probable,” stammered out Villefort, trying to smile; “but I can\r\nassure you that I had nothing to do with any such proceeding. This\r\nhouse is part of Valentine’s marriage-portion, and M. de Saint-Méran\r\nwished to sell it; for if it had remained another year or two\r\nuninhabited it would have fallen to ruin.”\r\n\r\nIt was Morrel’s turn to become pale.\r\n\r\n“There was, above all, one room,” continued Monte Cristo, “very plain\r\nin appearance, hung with red damask, which, I know not why, appeared to\r\nme quite dramatic.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?” said Danglars; “why dramatic?”\r\n\r\n“Can we account for instinct?” said Monte Cristo. “Are there not some\r\nplaces where we seem to breathe sadness?—why, we cannot tell. It is a\r\nchain of recollections—an idea which carries you back to other times,\r\nto other places—which, very likely, have no connection with the present\r\ntime and place. And there is something in this room which reminds me\r\nforcibly of the chamber of the Marquise de Ganges10 or Desdemona. Stay,\r\nsince we have finished dinner, I will show it to you, and then we will\r\ntake coffee in the garden. After dinner, the play.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo looked inquiringly at his guests. Madame de Villefort\r\nrose, Monte Cristo did the same, and the rest followed their example.\r\nVillefort and Madame Danglars remained for a moment, as if rooted to\r\ntheir seats; they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances.\r\n\r\n“Did you hear?” said Madame Danglars.\r\n\r\n“We must go,” replied Villefort, offering his arm.\r\n\r\nThe others, attracted by curiosity, were already scattered in different\r\nparts of the house; for they thought the visit would not be limited to\r\nthe one room, and that, at the same time, they would obtain a view of\r\nthe rest of the building, of which Monte Cristo had created a palace.\r\nEach one went out by the open doors. Monte Cristo waited for the two\r\nwho remained; then, when they had passed, he brought up the rear, and\r\non his face was a smile, which, if they could have understood it, would\r\nhave alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to\r\nenter. They began by walking through the apartments, many of which were\r\nfitted up in the Eastern style, with cushions and divans instead of\r\nbeds, and pipes instead of furniture. The drawing-rooms were decorated\r\nwith the rarest pictures by the old masters, the boudoirs hung with\r\ndraperies from China, of fanciful colors, fantastic design, and\r\nwonderful texture. At length they arrived at the famous room. There was\r\nnothing particular about it, excepting that, although daylight had\r\ndisappeared, it was not lighted, and everything in it was\r\nold-fashioned, while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated. These\r\ntwo causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect.\r\n\r\n“Oh.” cried Madame de Villefort, “it is really frightful.”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars tried to utter a few words, but was not heard. Many\r\nobservations were made, the import of which was a unanimous opinion\r\nthat there was something sinister about the room.\r\n\r\n30221m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Is it not so?” asked Monte Cristo. “Look at that large clumsy bed,\r\nhung with such gloomy, blood-colored drapery! And those two crayon\r\nportraits, that have faded from the dampness; do they not seem to say,\r\nwith their pale lips and staring eyes, ‘We have seen’?”\r\n\r\nVillefort became livid; Madame Danglars fell into a long seat placed\r\nnear the chimney.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Madame de Villefort, smiling, “are you courageous enough to\r\nsit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was\r\ncommitted?”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars rose suddenly.\r\n\r\n“And then,” said Monte Cristo, “this is not all.”\r\n\r\n“What is there more?” said Debray, who had not failed to notice the\r\nagitation of Madame Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Ah, what else is there?” said Danglars; “for, at present, I cannot say\r\nthat I have seen anything extraordinary. What do you say, M.\r\nCavalcanti?”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said he, “we have at Pisa, Ugolino’s tower; at Ferrara, Tasso’s\r\nprison; at Rimini, the room of Francesca and Paolo.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but you have not this little staircase,” said Monte Cristo,\r\nopening a door concealed by the drapery. “Look at it, and tell me what\r\nyou think of it.”\r\n\r\n“What a wicked-looking, crooked staircase,” said Château-Renaud with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“I do not know whether the wine of Chios produces melancholy, but\r\ncertainly everything appears to me black in this house,” said Debray.\r\n\r\nEver since Valentine’s dowry had been mentioned, Morrel had been silent\r\nand sad.\r\n\r\n“Can you imagine,” said Monte Cristo, “some Othello or Abbé de Ganges,\r\none stormy, dark night, descending these stairs step by step, carrying\r\na load, which he wishes to hide from the sight of man, if not from\r\nGod?”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars half fainted on the arm of Villefort, who was obliged\r\nto support himself against the wall.\r\n\r\n“Ah, madame,” cried Debray, “what is the matter with you? how pale you\r\nlook!”\r\n\r\n“It is very evident what is the matter with her,” said Madame de\r\nVillefort; “M. de Monte Cristo is relating horrible stories to us,\r\ndoubtless intending to frighten us to death.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Villefort, “really, count, you frighten the ladies.”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” asked Debray, in a whisper, of Madame Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” she replied with a violent effort. “I want air, that is\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“Will you come into the garden?” said Debray, advancing towards the\r\nback staircase.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” she answered, “I would rather remain here.”\r\n\r\n“Are you really frightened, madame?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, sir,” said Madame Danglars; “but you suppose scenes in a\r\nmanner which gives them the appearance of reality.”\r\n\r\n30223m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” said Monte Cristo smiling; “it is all a matter of\r\nimagination. Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest\r\nmother? And this bed with red hangings, a bed visited by the goddess\r\nLucina? And that mysterious staircase, the passage through which, not\r\nto disturb their sleep, the doctor and nurse pass, or even the father\r\ncarrying the sleeping child?”\r\n\r\nHere Madame Danglars, instead of being calmed by the soft picture,\r\nuttered a groan and fainted.\r\n\r\n“Madame Danglars is ill,” said Villefort; “it would be better to take\r\nher to her carriage.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _mon Dieu!_” said Monte Cristo, “and I have forgotten my\r\nsmelling-bottle!”\r\n\r\n“I have mine,” said Madame de Villefort; and she passed over to Monte\r\nCristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good\r\nproperties the count had tested on Edward.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Monte Cristo, taking it from her hand.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said, “at your advice I have made the trial.”\r\n\r\n“And have you succeeded?”\r\n\r\n“I think so.”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room; Monte Cristo\r\ndropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips; she\r\nreturned to consciousness.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” she cried, “what a frightful dream!”\r\n\r\nVillefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream. They\r\nlooked for M. Danglars, but, as he was not especially interested in\r\npoetical ideas, he had gone into the garden, and was talking with Major\r\nCavalcanti on the projected railway from Leghorn to Florence. Monte\r\nCristo seemed in despair. He took the arm of Madame Danglars, and\r\nconducted her into the garden, where they found Danglars taking coffee\r\nbetween the Cavalcanti.\r\n\r\n“Really, madame,” he said, “did I alarm you much?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, sir,” she answered; “but you know, things impress us\r\ndifferently, according to the mood of our minds.” Villefort forced a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n“And then, you know,” he said, “an idea, a supposition, is sufficient.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Monte Cristo, “you may believe me if you like, but it is\r\nmy opinion that a crime has been committed in this house.”\r\n\r\n“Take care,” said Madame de Villefort, “the king’s attorney is here.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” replied Monte Cristo, “since that is the case, I will take\r\nadvantage of his presence to make my declaration.”\r\n\r\n“Your declaration?” said Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Yes, before witnesses.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, this is very interesting,” said Debray; “if there really has been\r\na crime, we will investigate it.”\r\n\r\n“There has been a crime,” said Monte Cristo. “Come this way, gentlemen;\r\ncome, M. Villefort, for a declaration to be available, should be made\r\nbefore the competent authorities.”\r\n\r\nHe then took Villefort’s arm, and, at the same time, holding that of\r\nMadame Danglars under his own, he dragged the procureur to the\r\nplantain-tree, where the shade was thickest. All the other guests\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n“Stay,” said Monte Cristo, “here, in this very spot” (and he stamped\r\nupon the ground), “I had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in, to\r\nrefresh these old trees; well, my man, digging, found a box, or rather,\r\nthe iron-work of a box, in the midst of which was the skeleton of a\r\nnewly born infant.”\r\n\r\n30225m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo felt the arm of Madame Danglars stiffen, while that of\r\nVillefort trembled.\r\n\r\n“A newly born infant,” repeated Debray; “this affair becomes serious!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Château-Renaud, “I was not wrong just now then, when I\r\nsaid that houses had souls and faces like men, and that their exteriors\r\ncarried the impress of their characters. This house was gloomy because\r\nit was remorseful: it was remorseful because it concealed a crime.”\r\n\r\n“Who said it was a crime?” asked Villefort, with a last effort.\r\n\r\n“How? is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden?” cried\r\nMonte Cristo. “And pray what do you call such an action?”\r\n\r\n“But who said it was buried alive?”\r\n\r\n“Why bury it there if it were dead? This garden has never been a\r\ncemetery.”\r\n\r\n“What is done to infanticides in this country?” asked Major Cavalcanti\r\ninnocently.\r\n\r\n“Oh, their heads are soon cut off,” said Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed?” said Cavalcanti.\r\n\r\n“I think so; am I not right, M. de Villefort?” asked Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Yes, count,” replied Villefort, in a voice now scarcely human.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo, seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this\r\nscene could scarcely endure it, and not wishing to carry it too far,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Come, gentlemen,—some coffee, we seem to have forgotten it,” and he\r\nconducted the guests back to the table on the lawn.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, count,” said Madame Danglars, “I am ashamed to own it, but all\r\nyour frightful stories have so upset me, that I must beg you to let me\r\nsit down;” and she fell into a chair.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo bowed, and went to Madame de Villefort.\r\n\r\n“I think Madame Danglars again requires your bottle,” he said. But\r\nbefore Madame de Villefort could reach her friend, the procureur had\r\nfound time to whisper to Madame Danglars, “I must speak to you.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“In my office, or in the court, if you like,—that is the surest place.”\r\n\r\n“I will be there.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Madame de Villefort approached.\r\n\r\n“Thanks, my dear friend,” said Madame Danglars, trying to smile; “it is\r\nover now, and I am much better.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 64. The Beggar\r\n\r\nThe evening passed on; Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return\r\nto Paris, which Madame Danglars had not dared to do, notwithstanding\r\nthe uneasiness she experienced. On his wife’s request, M. de Villefort\r\nwas the first to give the signal of departure. He offered a seat in his\r\nlandau to Madame Danglars, that she might be under the care of his\r\nwife. As for M. Danglars, absorbed in an interesting conversation with\r\nM. Cavalcanti, he paid no attention to anything that was passing. While\r\nMonte Cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of Madame de Villefort, he\r\nhad noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars, and he soon\r\nguessed all that had passed between them, though the words had been\r\nuttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars.\r\nWithout opposing their arrangements, he allowed Morrel, Château-Renaud,\r\nand Debray to leave on horseback, and the ladies in M. de Villefort’s\r\ncarriage. Danglars, more and more delighted with Major Cavalcanti, had\r\noffered him a seat in his carriage. Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury\r\nwaiting at the door; the groom, in every respect a caricature of the\r\nEnglish fashion, was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron-gray\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nAndrea had spoken very little during dinner; he was an intelligent lad,\r\nand he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people,\r\namongst whom, with dilating eyes, he saw the king’s attorney. Then he\r\nhad been seized upon by Danglars, who, with a rapid glance at the\r\nstiff-necked old major and his modest son, and taking into\r\nconsideration the hospitality of the count, made up his mind that he\r\nwas in the society of some nabob come to Paris to finish the worldly\r\neducation of his heir. He contemplated with unspeakable delight the\r\nlarge diamond which shone on the major’s little finger; for the major,\r\nlike a prudent man, in case of any accident happening to his\r\nbank-notes, had immediately converted them into an available asset.\r\nThen, after dinner, on the pretext of business, he questioned the\r\nfather and son upon their mode of living; and the father and son,\r\npreviously informed that it was through Danglars the one was to receive\r\nhis 48,000 francs and the other 50,000 livres annually, were so full of\r\naffability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker’s\r\nservants, so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nOne thing above all the rest heightened the respect, nay almost the\r\nveneration, of Danglars for Cavalcanti. The latter, faithful to the\r\nprinciple of Horace, _nil admirari_, had contented himself with showing\r\nhis knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught.\r\nThen he had eaten some without saying a word more; Danglars, therefore,\r\nconcluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the\r\nillustrious descendant of the Cavalcanti, who most likely in Lucca fed\r\nupon trout brought from Switzerland, and lobsters sent from England, by\r\nthe same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from Lake\r\nFusaro, and the sterlet from the Volga. Thus it was with much\r\npoliteness of manner that he heard Cavalcanti pronounce these words:\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow, sir, I shall have the honor of waiting upon you on\r\nbusiness.”\r\n\r\n“And I, sir,” said Danglars, “shall be most happy to receive you.”\r\n\r\nUpon which he offered to take Cavalcanti in his carriage to the Hôtel\r\ndes Princes, if it would not be depriving him of the company of his\r\nson. To this Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his\r\nson had lived independently of him, that he had his own horses and\r\ncarriages, and that not having come together, it would not be difficult\r\nfor them to leave separately. The major seated himself, therefore, by\r\nthe side of Danglars, who was more and more charmed with the ideas of\r\norder and economy which ruled this man, and yet who, being able to\r\nallow his son 60,000 francs a year, might be supposed to possess a\r\nfortune of 500,000 or 600,000 livres.\r\n\r\nAs for Andrea, he began, by way of showing off, to scold his groom,\r\nwho, instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house, had\r\ntaken it to the outer door, thus giving him the trouble of walking\r\nthirty steps to reach it. The groom heard him with humility, took the\r\nbit of the impatient animal with his left hand, and with the right held\r\nout the reins to Andrea, who, taking them from him, rested his polished\r\nboot lightly on the step.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a hand touched his shoulder. The young man turned round,\r\nthinking that Danglars or Monte Cristo had forgotten something they\r\nwished to tell him, and had returned just as they were starting. But\r\ninstead of either of these, he saw nothing but a strange face,\r\nsunburnt, and encircled by a beard, with eyes brilliant as carbuncles,\r\nand a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white\r\nteeth, pointed and sharp as the wolf’s or jackal’s. A red handkerchief\r\nencircled his gray head; torn and filthy garments covered his large\r\nbony limbs, which seemed as though, like those of a skeleton, they\r\nwould rattle as he walked; and the hand with which he leaned upon the\r\nyoung man’s shoulder, and which was the first thing Andrea saw, seemed\r\nof gigantic size.\r\n\r\n30229m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in\r\nhis tilbury, or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of\r\nhis interrogator? We cannot say; but only relate the fact that he\r\nshuddered and stepped back suddenly.\r\n\r\n“What do you want of me?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, my friend, if I disturb you,” said the man with the red\r\nhandkerchief, “but I want to speak to you.”\r\n\r\n“You have no right to beg at night,” said the groom, endeavoring to rid\r\nhis master of the troublesome intruder.\r\n\r\n“I am not begging, my fine fellow,” said the unknown to the servant,\r\nwith so ironical an expression of the eye, and so frightful a smile,\r\nthat he withdrew; “I only wish to say two or three words to your\r\nmaster, who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Andrea, with sufficient nerve for his servant not to\r\nperceive his agitation, “what do you want? Speak quickly, friend.”\r\n\r\nThe man said, in a low voice: “I wish—I wish you to spare me the walk\r\nback to Paris. I am very tired, and as I have not eaten so good a\r\ndinner as you, I can scarcely stand.”\r\n\r\nThe young man shuddered at this strange familiarity.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” he said—“tell me what you want?”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I want you to take me up in your fine carriage, and carry\r\nme back.” Andrea turned pale, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the man, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and looking\r\nimpudently at the youth; “I have taken the whim into my head; do you\r\nunderstand, Master Benedetto?”\r\n\r\nAt this name, no doubt, the young man reflected a little, for he went\r\ntowards his groom, saying:\r\n\r\n“This man is right; I did indeed charge him with a commission, the\r\nresult of which he must tell me; walk to the barrier, there take a cab,\r\nthat you may not be too late.”\r\n\r\nThe surprised groom retired.\r\n\r\n“Let me at least reach a shady spot,” said Andrea.\r\n\r\n“Oh, as for that, I’ll take you to a splendid place,” said the man with\r\nthe handkerchief; and taking the horse’s bit he led the tilbury where\r\nit was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that Andrea\r\nconferred upon him.\r\n\r\n“Don’t think I want the glory of riding in your fine carriage,” said\r\nhe; “oh, no, it’s only because I am tired, and also because I have a\r\nlittle business to talk over with you.”\r\n\r\n“Come, step in,” said the young man. It was a pity this scene had not\r\noccurred in daylight, for it was curious to see this rascal throwing\r\nhimself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver\r\nof the tilbury. Andrea drove past the last house in the village without\r\nsaying a word to his companion, who smiled complacently, as though\r\nwell-pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle.\r\nOnce out of Auteuil, Andrea looked around, in order to assure himself\r\nthat he could neither be seen nor heard, and then, stopping the horse\r\nand crossing his arms before the man, he asked:\r\n\r\n“Now, tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity?”\r\n\r\n“Let me ask you why you deceived me?”\r\n\r\n“How have I deceived you?”\r\n\r\n“‘How,’ do you ask? When we parted at the Pont du Var, you told me you\r\nwere going to travel through Piedmont and Tuscany; but instead of that,\r\nyou come to Paris.”\r\n\r\n“How does that annoy you?”\r\n\r\n“It does not; on the contrary, I think it will answer my purpose.”\r\n\r\n“So,” said Andrea, “you are speculating upon me?”\r\n\r\n“What fine words he uses!”\r\n\r\n“I warn you, Master Caderousse, that you are mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, don’t be angry, my boy; you know well enough what it is to\r\nbe unfortunate; and misfortunes make us jealous. I thought you were\r\nearning a living in Tuscany or Piedmont by acting as _facchino_ or\r\n_cicerone_, and I pitied you sincerely, as I would a child of my own.\r\nYou know I always did call you my child.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, what then?”\r\n\r\n“Patience—patience!”\r\n\r\n“I am patient, but go on.”\r\n\r\n“All at once I see you pass through the barrier with a groom, a\r\ntilbury, and fine new clothes. You must have discovered a mine, or else\r\nbecome a stockbroker.”\r\n\r\n“So that, as you confess, you are jealous?”\r\n\r\n“No, I am pleased—so pleased that I wished to congratulate you; but as\r\nI am not quite properly dressed, I chose my opportunity, that I might\r\nnot compromise you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and a fine opportunity you have chosen!” exclaimed Andrea; “you\r\nspeak to me before my servant.”\r\n\r\n“How can I help that, my boy? I speak to you when I can catch you. You\r\nhave a quick horse, a light tilbury, you are naturally as slippery as\r\nan eel; if I had missed you tonight, I might not have had another\r\nchance.”\r\n\r\n“You see, I do not conceal myself.”\r\n\r\n“You are lucky; I wish I could say as much, for I do conceal myself;\r\nand then I was afraid you would not recognize me, but you did,” added\r\nCaderousse with his unpleasant smile. “It was very polite of you.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Andrea, “what do you want?”\r\n\r\n“You do not speak affectionately to me, Benedetto, my old friend, that\r\nis not right—take care, or I may become troublesome.”\r\n\r\nThis menace smothered the young man’s passion. He urged the horse again\r\ninto a trot.\r\n\r\n“You should not speak so to an old friend like me, Caderousse, as you\r\nsaid just now; you are a native of Marseilles, I am——”\r\n\r\n“Do you know then now what you are?”\r\n\r\n“No, but I was brought up in Corsica; you are old and obstinate, I am\r\nyoung and wilful. Between people like us threats are out of place,\r\neverything should be amicably arranged. Is it my fault if fortune,\r\nwhich has frowned on you, has been kind to me?”\r\n\r\n“Fortune has been kind to you, then? Your tilbury, your groom, your\r\nclothes, are not then hired? Good, so much the better,” said\r\nCaderousse, his eyes sparkling with avarice.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you knew that well enough before speaking to me,” said Andrea,\r\nbecoming more and more excited. “If I had been wearing a handkerchief\r\nlike yours on my head, rags on my back, and worn-out shoes on my feet,\r\nyou would not have known me.”\r\n\r\n“You wrong me, my boy; now I have found you, nothing prevents my being\r\nas well-dressed as anyone, knowing, as I do, the goodness of your\r\nheart. If you have two coats you will give me one of them. I used to\r\ndivide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Andrea.\r\n\r\n“What an appetite you used to have! Is it as good now?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” replied Andrea, laughing.\r\n\r\n“How did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have\r\njust left?”\r\n\r\n“He is not a prince; simply a count.”\r\n\r\n“A count, and a rich one too, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but you had better not have anything to say to him, for he is not\r\na very good-tempered gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, be easy! I have no design upon your count, and you shall have him\r\nall to yourself. But,” said Caderousse, again smiling with the\r\ndisagreeable expression he had before assumed, “you must pay for it—you\r\nunderstand?”\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you want?”\r\n\r\n“I think that with a hundred francs a month——”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I could live——”\r\n\r\n“Upon a hundred francs!”\r\n\r\n“Come—you understand me; but that with——”\r\n\r\n“With?”\r\n\r\n“With a hundred and fifty francs I should be quite happy.”\r\n\r\n“Here are two hundred,” said Andrea; and he placed ten gold louis in\r\nthe hand of Caderousse.\r\n\r\n30233m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Good!” said Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“Apply to the steward on the first day of every month, and you will\r\nreceive the same sum.”\r\n\r\n“There now, again you degrade me.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“By making me apply to the servants, when I want to transact business\r\nwith you alone.”\r\n\r\n“Well, be it so, then. Take it from me then, and so long at least as I\r\nreceive my income, you shall be paid yours.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come; I always said you were a fine fellow, and it is a blessing\r\nwhen good fortune happens to such as you. But tell me all about it?”\r\n\r\n“Why do you wish to know?” asked Cavalcanti.\r\n\r\n“What? do you again defy me?”\r\n\r\n“No; the fact is, I have found my father.”\r\n\r\n“What? a real father?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, so long as he pays me——”\r\n\r\n“You’ll honor and believe him—that’s right. What is his name?”\r\n\r\n“Major Cavalcanti.”\r\n\r\n“Is he pleased with you?”\r\n\r\n“So far I have appeared to answer his purpose.”\r\n\r\n“And who found this father for you?”\r\n\r\n“The Count of Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\n“The man whose house you have just left?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather,\r\nsince he holds the money-chest!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will mention you to him. Meanwhile, what are you going to do?”\r\n\r\n“I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you.”\r\n\r\n“It is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me.”\r\n\r\n“Since you interest yourself in my affairs, I think it is now my turn\r\nto ask you some questions.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, true. Well; I shall rent a room in some respectable house, wear a\r\ndecent coat, shave every day, and go and read the papers in a café.\r\nThen, in the evening, I shall go to the theatre; I shall look like some\r\nretired baker. That is what I want.”\r\n\r\n“Come, if you will only put this scheme into execution, and be steady,\r\nnothing could be better.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so, M. Bossuet? And you—what will you become? A peer of\r\nFrance?”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Andrea, “who knows?”\r\n\r\n“Major Cavalcanti is already one, perhaps; but then, hereditary rank is\r\nabolished.”\r\n\r\n“No politics, Caderousse. And now that you have all you want, and that\r\nwe understand each other, jump down from the tilbury and disappear.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, my good friend.”\r\n\r\n“How? Not at all?”\r\n\r\n“Why, just think for a moment; with this red handkerchief on my head,\r\nwith scarcely any shoes, no papers, and ten gold napoleons in my\r\npocket, without reckoning what was there before—making in all about two\r\nhundred francs,—why, I should certainly be arrested at the barriers.\r\nThen, to justify myself, I should say that you gave me the money; this\r\nwould cause inquiries, it would be found that I left Toulon without\r\ngiving due notice, and I should then be escorted back to the shores of\r\nthe Mediterranean. Then I should become simply No. 106, and good-bye to\r\nmy dream of resembling the retired baker! No, no, my boy; I prefer\r\nremaining honorably in the capital.”\r\n\r\nAndrea scowled. Certainly, as he had himself owned, the reputed son of\r\nMajor Cavalcanti was a wilful fellow. He drew up for a minute, threw a\r\nrapid glance around him, and then his hand fell instantly into his\r\npocket, where it began playing with a pistol. But, meanwhile,\r\nCaderousse, who had never taken his eyes off his companion, passed his\r\nhand behind his back, and opened a long Spanish knife, which he always\r\ncarried with him, to be ready in case of need. The two friends, as we\r\nsee, were worthy of and understood one another. Andrea’s hand left his\r\npocket inoffensively, and was carried up to the red moustache, which it\r\nplayed with for some time.\r\n\r\n“Good Caderousse,” he said, “how happy you will be.”\r\n\r\n“I will do my best,” said the innkeeper of the Pont du Gard, shutting\r\nup his knife.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, we will go into Paris. But how will you pass through the\r\nbarrier without exciting suspicion? It seems to me that you are in more\r\ndanger riding than on foot.”\r\n\r\n“Wait,” said Caderousse, “we shall see.” He then took the greatcoat\r\nwith the large collar, which the groom had left behind in the tilbury,\r\nand put it on his back; then he took off Cavalcanti’s hat, which he\r\nplaced upon his own head, and finally he assumed the careless attitude\r\nof a servant whose master drives himself.\r\n\r\n“But, tell me,” said Andrea, “am I to remain bareheaded?”\r\n\r\n“Pooh,” said Caderousse; “it is so windy that your hat can easily\r\nappear to have blown off.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come; enough of this,” said Cavalcanti.\r\n\r\n“What are you waiting for?” said Caderousse. “I hope I am not the\r\ncause.”\r\n\r\n“Hush,” said Andrea. They passed the barrier without accident. At the\r\nfirst cross street Andrea stopped his horse, and Caderousse leaped out.\r\n\r\n“Well!” said Andrea,—“my servant’s coat and my hat?”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Caderousse, “you would not like me to risk taking cold?”\r\n\r\n“But what am I to do?”\r\n\r\n“You? Oh, you are young while I am beginning to get old. _Au revoir_,\r\nBenedetto;” and running into a court, he disappeared.\r\n\r\n“Alas,” said Andrea, sighing, “one cannot be completely happy in this\r\nworld!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 65. A Conjugal Scene\r\n\r\nAt the Place Louis XV. the three young people separated—that is to say,\r\nMorrel went to the Boulevards, Château-Renaud to the Pont de la\r\nRévolution, and Debray to the Quai. Most probably Morrel and\r\nChâteau-Renaud returned to their “domestic hearths,” as they say in the\r\ngallery of the Chamber in well-turned speeches, and in the theatre of\r\nthe Rue Richelieu in well-written pieces; but it was not the case with\r\nDebray. When he reached the wicket of the Louvre, he turned to the\r\nleft, galloped across the Carrousel, passed through the Rue Saint-Roch,\r\nand, issuing from the Rue de la Michodière, he arrived at M. Danglars’\r\ndoor just at the same time that Villefort’s landau, after having\r\ndeposited him and his wife at the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, stopped to\r\nleave the baroness at her own house.\r\n\r\nDebray, with the air of a man familiar with the house, entered first\r\ninto the court, threw his bridle into the hands of a footman, and\r\nreturned to the door to receive Madame Danglars, to whom he offered his\r\narm, to conduct her to her apartments. The gate once closed, and Debray\r\nand the baroness alone in the court, he asked:\r\n\r\n“What was the matter with you, Hermine? and why were you so affected at\r\nthat story, or rather fable, which the count related?”\r\n\r\n“Because I have been in such shocking spirits all the evening, my\r\nfriend,” said the baroness.\r\n\r\n“No, Hermine,” replied Debray; “you cannot make me believe that; on the\r\ncontrary, you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the\r\ncount’s. M. Danglars was disagreeable, certainly, but I know how much\r\nyou care for his ill-humor. Someone has vexed you; I will allow no one\r\nto annoy you.”\r\n\r\n“You are deceived, Lucien, I assure you,” replied Madame Danglars; “and\r\nwhat I have told you is really the case, added to the ill-humor you\r\nremarked, but which I did not think it worth while to allude to.”\r\n\r\nIt was evident that Madame Danglars was suffering from that nervous\r\nirritability which women frequently cannot account for even to\r\nthemselves; or that, as Debray had guessed, she had experienced some\r\nsecret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone. Being a man\r\nwho knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent\r\npenalties of womanhood, he did not then press his inquiries, but waited\r\nfor a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate\r\nher, or receive an avowal _proprio motu_.\r\n\r\nAt the door of her apartment the baroness met Mademoiselle Cornélie,\r\nher confidential maid.\r\n\r\n“What is my daughter doing?” asked Madame Danglars.\r\n\r\n“She practiced all the evening, and then went to bed,” replied\r\nMademoiselle Cornélie.\r\n\r\n“Yet I think I hear her piano.”\r\n\r\n“It is Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly, who is playing while Mademoiselle\r\nDanglars is in bed.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Madame Danglars, “come and undress me.”\r\n\r\nThey entered the bedroom. Debray stretched himself upon a large couch,\r\nand Madame Danglars passed into her dressing-room with Mademoiselle\r\nCornélie.\r\n\r\n“My dear M. Lucien,” said Madame Danglars through the door, “you are\r\nalways complaining that Eugénie will not address a word to you.”\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said Lucien, playing with a little dog, who, recognizing him\r\nas a friend of the house, expected to be caressed, “I am not the only\r\none who makes similar complaints, I think I heard Morcerf say that he\r\ncould not extract a word from his betrothed.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Madame Danglars; “yet I think this will all pass off, and\r\nthat you will one day see her enter your study.”\r\n\r\n“My study?”\r\n\r\n“At least that of the minister.”\r\n\r\n“Why so!”\r\n\r\n“To ask for an engagement at the Opera. Really, I never saw such an\r\ninfatuation for music; it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of\r\nfashion.”\r\n\r\nDebray smiled. “Well,” said he, “let her come, with your consent and\r\nthat of the baron, and we will try and give her an engagement, though\r\nwe are very poor to pay such talent as hers.”\r\n\r\n“Go, Cornélie,” said Madame Danglars, “I do not require you any\r\nlonger.”\r\n\r\nCornélie obeyed, and the next minute Madame Danglars left her room in a\r\ncharming loose dress, and came and sat down close to Debray. Then she\r\nbegan thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel. Lucien looked at her\r\nfor a moment in silence.\r\n\r\n“Come, Hermine,” he said, after a short time, “answer\r\ncandidly,—something vexes you—is it not so?”\r\n\r\n30239m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” answered the baroness.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as she could scarcely breathe, she rose and went towards a\r\nlooking-glass. “I am frightful tonight,” she said. Debray rose,\r\nsmiling, and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter\r\npoint, when the door opened suddenly. M. Danglars appeared; Debray\r\nreseated himself. At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned\r\nround, and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no\r\ntrouble to conceal.\r\n\r\n“Good-evening, madame,” said the banker; “good-evening, M. Debray.”\r\n\r\nProbably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire\r\nto make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day. Assuming\r\na dignified air, she turned round to Debray, without answering her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n“Read me something, M. Debray,” she said. Debray, who was slightly\r\ndisturbed at this visit, recovered himself when he saw the calmness of\r\nthe baroness, and took up a book marked by a mother-of-pearl knife\r\ninlaid with gold.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” said the banker, “but you will tire yourself, baroness, by\r\nsuch late hours, and M. Debray lives some distance from here.”\r\n\r\nDebray was petrified, not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and\r\npolitely, but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness\r\nthere really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his\r\nwife might wish to do. The baroness was also surprised, and showed her\r\nastonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon\r\nher husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper, where\r\nhe was looking to see the closing stock quotations. The result was,\r\nthat the proud look entirely failed of its purpose.\r\n\r\n“M. Lucien,” said the baroness, “I assure you I have no desire to\r\nsleep, and that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening,\r\nwhich you must listen to, even though you slept while hearing me.”\r\n\r\n“I am at your service, madame,” replied Lucien coldly.\r\n\r\n“My dear M. Debray,” said the banker, “do not kill yourself tonight\r\nlistening to the follies of Madame Danglars, for you can hear them as\r\nwell tomorrow; but I claim tonight and will devote it, if you will\r\nallow me, to talk over some serious matters with my wife.”\r\n\r\nThis time the blow was so well aimed, and hit so directly, that Lucien\r\nand the baroness were staggered, and they interrogated each other with\r\ntheir eyes, as if to seek help against this aggression, but the\r\nirresistible will of the master of the house prevailed, and the husband\r\nwas victorious.\r\n\r\n“Do not think I wish to turn you out, my dear Debray,” continued\r\nDanglars; “oh, no, not at all. An unexpected occurrence forces me to\r\nask my wife to have a little conversation with me; it is so rarely I\r\nmake such a request, I am sure you cannot grudge it to me.”\r\n\r\nDebray muttered something, bowed and went out, knocking himself against\r\nthe edge of the door, like Nathan in _Athalie_.\r\n\r\n“It is extraordinary,” he said, when the door was closed behind him,\r\n“how easily these husbands, whom we ridicule, gain an advantage over\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n30241m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLucien having left, Danglars took his place on the sofa, closed the\r\nopen book, and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude, he\r\nbegan playing with the dog; but the animal, not liking him as well as\r\nDebray, and attempting to bite him, Danglars seized him by the skin of\r\nhis neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room. The\r\nanimal uttered a cry during the transit, but, arrived at its\r\ndestination, it crouched behind the cushions, and stupefied at such\r\nunusual treatment remained silent and motionless.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, sir,” asked the baroness, “that you are improving?\r\nGenerally you are only rude, but tonight you are brutal.”\r\n\r\n“It is because I am in a worse humor than usual,” replied Danglars.\r\nHermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain. These glances\r\nfrequently exasperated the pride of Danglars, but this evening he took\r\nno notice of them.\r\n\r\n“And what have I to do with your ill-humor?” said the baroness,\r\nirritated at the impassibility of her husband; “do these things concern\r\nme? Keep your ill-humor at home in your money boxes, or, since you have\r\nclerks whom you pay, vent it upon them.”\r\n\r\n“Not so,” replied Danglars; “your advice is wrong, so I shall not\r\nfollow it. My money boxes are my Pactolus, as, I think, M. Demoustier\r\nsays, and I will not retard its course, or disturb its calm. My clerks\r\nare honest men, who earn my fortune, whom I pay much below their\r\ndeserts, if I may value them according to what they bring in; therefore\r\nI shall not get into a passion with them; those with whom I will be in\r\na passion are those who eat my dinners, mount my horses, and exhaust my\r\nfortune.”\r\n\r\n“And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune? Explain\r\nyourself more clearly, I beg, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, make yourself easy!—I am not speaking riddles, and you will soon\r\nknow what I mean. The people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw\r\nout 700,000 francs in the course of an hour.”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand you, sir,” said the baroness, trying to disguise\r\nthe agitation of her voice and the flush of her face.\r\n\r\n“You understand me perfectly, on the contrary,” said Danglars: “but, if\r\nyou will persist, I will tell you that I have just lost 700,000 francs\r\nupon the Spanish loan.”\r\n\r\n“And pray,” asked the baroness, “am I responsible for this loss?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Is it my fault you have lost 700,000 francs?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly it is not mine.”\r\n\r\n“Once for all, sir,” replied the baroness sharply, “I tell you I will\r\nnot hear cash named; it is a style of language I never heard in the\r\nhouse of my parents or in that of my first husband.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I can well believe that, for neither of them was worth a penny.”\r\n\r\n“The better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the\r\nbank, which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night; that\r\nnoise of jingling crowns, which are constantly being counted and\r\nre-counted, is odious to me. I only know one thing I dislike more,\r\nwhich is the sound of your voice.”\r\n\r\n“Really?” said Danglars. “Well, this surprises me, for I thought you\r\ntook the liveliest interest in all my affairs!”\r\n\r\n30243m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I? What could put such an idea into your head?”\r\n\r\n“Yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Ah?—what next?”\r\n\r\n“Most assuredly.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to know upon what occasion?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _mon Dieu!_ that is very easily done. Last February you were the\r\nfirst who told me of the Haitian funds. You had dreamed that a ship had\r\nentered the harbor at Le Havre, that this ship brought news that a\r\npayment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made. I know how\r\nclear-sighted your dreams are; I therefore purchased immediately as\r\nmany shares as I could of the Haitian debt, and I gained 400,000 francs\r\nby it, of which 100,000 have been honestly paid to you. You spent it as\r\nyou pleased; that was your business. In March there was a question\r\nabout a grant to a railway. Three companies presented themselves, each\r\noffering equal securities. You told me that your instinct,—and although\r\nyou pretend to know nothing about speculations, I think on the\r\ncontrary, that your comprehension is very clear upon certain\r\naffairs,—well, you told me that your instinct led you to believe the\r\ngrant would be given to the company called the Southern. I bought two\r\nthirds of the shares of that company; as you had foreseen, the shares\r\ntrebled in value, and I picked up a million, from which 250,000 francs\r\nwere paid to you for pin-money. How have you spent this 250,000\r\nfrancs?—it is no business of mine.”\r\n\r\n“When are you coming to the point?” cried the baroness, shivering with\r\nanger and impatience.\r\n\r\n“Patience, madame, I am coming to it.”\r\n\r\n“That’s fortunate.”\r\n\r\n“In April you went to dine at the minister’s. You heard a private\r\nconversation respecting Spanish affairs—on the expulsion of Don Carlos.\r\nI bought some Spanish shares. The expulsion took place and I pocketed\r\n600,000 francs the day Charles V. repassed the Bidassoa. Of these\r\n600,000 francs you took 50,000 crowns. They were yours, you disposed of\r\nthem according to your fancy, and I asked no questions; but it is not\r\nthe less true that you have this year received 500,000 livres.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, and what then?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, it was just after this that you spoiled everything.”\r\n\r\n“Really, your manner of speaking——”\r\n\r\n“It expresses my meaning, and that is all I want. Well, three days\r\nafter that you talked politics with M. Debray, and you fancied from his\r\nwords that Don Carlos had returned to Spain. Well, I sold my shares,\r\nthe news got out, and I no longer sold—I gave them away, next day I\r\nfind the news was false, and by this false report I have lost 700,000\r\nfrancs.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Well, since I gave you a fourth of my gains, I think you owe me a\r\nfourth of my losses; the fourth of 700,000 francs is 175,000 francs.”\r\n\r\n“What you say is absurd, and I cannot see why M. Debray’s name is mixed\r\nup in this affair.”\r\n\r\n“Because if you do not possess the 175,000 francs I reclaim, you must\r\nhave lent them to your friends, and M. Debray is one of your friends.”\r\n\r\n30245m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“For shame!” exclaimed the baroness.\r\n\r\n“Oh, let us have no gestures, no screams, no modern drama, or you will\r\noblige me to tell you that I see Debray leave here, pocketing the whole\r\nof the 500,000 livres you have handed over to him this year, while he\r\nsmiles to himself, saying that he has found what the most skilful\r\nplayers have never discovered—that is, a roulette where he wins without\r\nplaying, and is no loser when he loses.”\r\n\r\nThe baroness became enraged.\r\n\r\n“Wretch!” she cried, “will you dare to tell me you did not know what\r\nyou now reproach me with?”\r\n\r\n“I do not say that I did know it, and I do not say that I did not know\r\nit. I merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four\r\nyears that we have ceased to be husband and wife, and see whether it\r\nhas not always been consistent. Some time after our rupture, you wished\r\nto study music, under the celebrated baritone who made such a\r\nsuccessful appearance at the Théâtre Italien; at the same time I felt\r\ninclined to learn dancing of the _danseuse_ who acquired such a\r\nreputation in London. This cost me, on your account and mine, 100,000\r\nfrancs. I said nothing, for we must have peace in the house; and\r\n100,000 francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in\r\nmusic and dancing are not too much. Well, you soon become tired of\r\nsinging, and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the minister’s\r\nsecretary. You understand, it signifies nothing to me so long as you\r\npay for your lessons out of your own cash box. But today I find you are\r\ndrawing on mine, and that your apprenticeship may cost me 700,000\r\nfrancs per month. Stop there, madame, for this cannot last. Either the\r\ndiplomatist must give his lessons gratis, and I will tolerate him, or\r\nhe must never set his foot again in my house;—do you understand,\r\nmadame?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, this is too much,” cried Hermine, choking, “you are worse than\r\ndespicable.”\r\n\r\n“But,” continued Danglars, “I find you did not even pause there——”\r\n\r\n“Insults!”\r\n\r\n“You are right; let us leave these facts alone, and reason coolly. I\r\nhave never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good; treat me\r\nin the same way. You say you have nothing to do with my cash box. Be it\r\nso. Do as you like with your own, but do not fill or empty mine.\r\nBesides, how do I know that this was not a political trick, that the\r\nminister enraged at seeing me in the opposition, and jealous of the\r\npopular sympathy I excite, has not concerted with M. Debray to ruin\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“A probable thing!”\r\n\r\n“Why not? Who ever heard of such an occurrence as this?—a false\r\ntelegraphic despatch—it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be\r\nmade as they were in the last two telegrams. It was done on purpose for\r\nme—I am sure of it.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the baroness humbly, “are you not aware that the man\r\nemployed there was dismissed, that they talked of going to law with\r\nhim, that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would\r\nhave been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight, which\r\nproves that he was either mad or guilty? It was a mistake.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, which made fools laugh, which caused the minister to have a\r\nsleepless night, which has caused the minister’s secretaries to blacken\r\nseveral sheets of paper, but which has cost me 700,000 francs.”\r\n\r\n“But, sir,” said Hermine suddenly, “if all this is, as you say, caused\r\nby M. Debray, why, instead of going direct to him, do you come and tell\r\nme of it? Why, to accuse the man, do you address the woman?”\r\n\r\n“Do I know M. Debray?—do I wish to know him?—do I wish to know that he\r\ngives advice?—do I wish to follow it?—do I speculate? No; you do all\r\nthis, not I.”\r\n\r\n“Still it seems to me, that as you profit by it——”\r\n\r\nDanglars shrugged his shoulders. “Foolish creature,” he exclaimed.\r\n“Women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three\r\nintrigues without being the talk of Paris! But know that if you had\r\neven hidden your irregularities from your husband, who has but the\r\ncommencement of the art—for generally husbands _will_ not see—you would\r\nthen have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the\r\nwomen of the world. But it has not been so with me,—I see, and always\r\nhave seen, during the last sixteen years. You may, perhaps, have hidden\r\na thought; but not a step, not an action, not a fault, has escaped me,\r\nwhile you flattered yourself upon your address, and firmly believed you\r\nhad deceived me. What has been the result?—that, thanks to my pretended\r\nignorance, there is none of your friends, from M. de Villefort to M.\r\nDebray, who has not trembled before me. There is not one who has not\r\ntreated me as the master of the house,—the only title I desire with\r\nrespect to you; there is not one, in fact, who would have dared to\r\nspeak of me as I have spoken of them this day. I will allow you to make\r\nme hateful, but I will prevent your rendering me ridiculous, and, above\r\nall, I forbid you to ruin me.”\r\n\r\nThe baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of Villefort\r\nhad been pronounced; but then she became pale, and, rising, as if\r\ntouched by a spring, she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an\r\napparition; she then took two or three steps towards her husband, as\r\nthough to tear the secret from him, of which he was ignorant, or which\r\nhe withheld from some odious calculation,—odious, as all his\r\ncalculations were.\r\n\r\n“M. de Villefort!—What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I mean that M. de Nargonne, your first husband, being neither a\r\nphilosopher nor a banker, or perhaps being both, and seeing there was\r\nnothing to be got out of a king’s attorney, died of grief or anger at\r\nfinding, after an absence of nine months, that you had been _enceinte_\r\nsix. I am brutal,—I not only allow it, but boast of it; it is one of\r\nthe reasons of my success in commercial business. Why did he kill\r\nhimself instead of you? Because he had no cash to save. My life belongs\r\nto my cash. M. Debray has made me lose 700,000 francs; let him bear his\r\nshare of the loss, and we will go on as before; if not, let him become\r\nbankrupt for the 250,000 livres, and do as all bankrupts do—disappear.\r\nHe is a charming fellow, I allow, when his news is correct; but when it\r\nis not, there are fifty others in the world who would do better than\r\nhe.”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars was rooted to the spot; she made a violent effort to\r\nreply to this last attack, but she fell upon a chair thinking of\r\nVillefort, of the dinner scene, of the strange series of misfortunes\r\nwhich had taken place in her house during the last few days, and\r\nchanged the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\nDanglars did not even look at her, though she did her best to faint. He\r\nshut the bedroom door after him, without adding another word, and\r\nreturned to his apartments; and when Madame Danglars recovered from her\r\nhalf-fainting condition, she could almost believe that she had had a\r\ndisagreeable dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 66. Matrimonial Projects\r\n\r\nThe day following this scene, at the hour Debray usually chose to pay a\r\nvisit to Madame Danglars on his way to his office, his _coupé_ did not\r\nappear. At this time, that is, about half-past twelve, Madame Danglars\r\nordered her carriage, and went out. Danglars, hidden behind a curtain,\r\nwatched the departure he had been waiting for. He gave orders that he\r\nshould be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared; but at two\r\no’clock she had not returned. He then called for his horses, drove to\r\nthe Chamber, and inscribed his name to speak against the budget. From\r\ntwelve to two o’clock Danglars had remained in his study, unsealing his\r\ndispatches, and becoming more and more sad every minute, heaping figure\r\nupon figure, and receiving, among other visits, one from Major\r\nCavalcanti, who, as stiff and exact as ever, presented himself\r\nprecisely at the hour named the night before, to terminate his business\r\nwith the banker.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Chamber, Danglars, who had shown violent marks of\r\nagitation during the sitting, and been more bitter than ever against\r\nthe ministry, re-entered his carriage, and told the coachman to drive\r\nto the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, No. 30.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo was at home; only he was engaged with someone and begged\r\nDanglars to wait for a moment in the drawing-room. While the banker was\r\nwaiting in the anteroom, the door opened, and a man dressed as an abbé\r\nand doubtless more familiar with the house than he was, came in and\r\ninstead of waiting, merely bowed, passed on to the farther apartments,\r\nand disappeared.\r\n\r\nA minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened, and\r\nMonte Cristo appeared.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” said he, “my dear baron, but one of my friends, the Abbé\r\nBusoni, whom you perhaps saw pass by, has just arrived in Paris; not\r\nhaving seen him for a long time, I could not make up my mind to leave\r\nhim sooner, so I hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made\r\nyou wait.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Danglars, “it is my fault; I have chosen my visit at a\r\nwrong time, and will retire.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all; on the contrary, be seated; but what is the matter with\r\nyou? You look careworn; really, you alarm me. Melancholy in a\r\ncapitalist, like the appearance of a comet, presages some misfortune to\r\nthe world.”\r\n\r\n“I have been in ill-luck for several days,” said Danglars, “and I have\r\nheard nothing but bad news.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed?” said Monte Cristo. “Have you had another fall at the\r\nBourse?”\r\n\r\n“No; I am safe for a few days at least. I am only annoyed about a\r\nbankrupt of Trieste.”\r\n\r\n“Really? Does it happen to be Jacopo Manfredi?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so. Imagine a man who has transacted business with me for I\r\ndon’t know how long, to the amount of 800,000 or 900,000 francs during\r\nthe year. Never a mistake or delay—a fellow who paid like a prince.\r\nWell, I was a million in advance with him, and now my fine Jacopo\r\nManfredi suspends payment!”\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n\r\n“It is an unheard-of fatality. I draw upon him for 600,000 francs, my\r\nbills are returned unpaid, and, more than that, I hold bills of\r\nexchange signed by him to the value of 400,000 francs, payable at his\r\ncorrespondent’s in Paris at the end of this month. Today is the 30th. I\r\npresent them; but my correspondent has disappeared. This, with my\r\nSpanish affairs, made a pretty end to the month.”\r\n\r\n“Then you really lost by that affair in Spain?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; only 700,000 francs out of my cash box—nothing more!”\r\n\r\n“Why, how could you make such a mistake—such an old stager?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is all my wife’s fault. She dreamed Don Carlos had returned to\r\nSpain; she believes in dreams. It is magnetism, she says, and when she\r\ndreams a thing it is sure to happen, she assures me. On this conviction\r\nI allow her to speculate, she having her bank and her stockbroker; she\r\nspeculated and lost. It is true she speculates with her own money, not\r\nmine; nevertheless, you can understand that when 700,000 francs leave\r\nthe wife’s pocket, the husband always finds it out. But do you mean to\r\nsay you have not heard of this? Why, the thing has made a tremendous\r\nnoise.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I heard it spoken of, but I did not know the details, and then no\r\none can be more ignorant than I am of the affairs in the Bourse.”\r\n\r\n30251m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Then you do not speculate?”\r\n\r\n“I?—How could I speculate when I already have so much trouble in\r\nregulating my income? I should be obliged, besides my steward, to keep\r\na clerk and a boy. But touching these Spanish affairs, I think that the\r\nbaroness did not dream the whole of the Don Carlos matter. The papers\r\nsaid something about it, did they not?”\r\n\r\n“Then you believe the papers?”\r\n\r\n“I?—not the least in the world; only I fancied that the honest\r\n_Messager_ was an exception to the rule, and that it only announced\r\ntelegraphic despatches.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s what puzzles me,” replied Danglars; “the news of the\r\nreturn of Don Carlos was brought by telegraph.”\r\n\r\n“So that,” said Monte Cristo, “you have lost nearly 1,700,000 francs\r\nthis month.”\r\n\r\n“Not nearly, indeed; that is exactly my loss.”\r\n\r\n“_Diable!_” said Monte Cristo compassionately, “it is a hard blow for a\r\nthird-rate fortune.”\r\n\r\n“Third-rate,” said Danglars, rather humble, “what do you mean by that?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” continued Monte Cristo, “I make three assortments in\r\nfortune—first-rate, second-rate, and third-rate fortunes. I call those\r\nfirst-rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under one’s\r\nhand, such as mines, lands, and funded property, in such states as\r\nFrance, Austria, and England, provided these treasures and property\r\nform a total of about a hundred millions; I call those second-rate\r\nfortunes, that are gained by manufacturing enterprises, joint-stock\r\ncompanies, viceroyalties, and principalities, not drawing more than\r\n1,500,000 francs, the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions;\r\nfinally, I call those third-rate fortunes, which are composed of a\r\nfluctuating capital, dependent upon the will of others, or upon chances\r\nwhich a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes, such as banks,\r\nspeculations of the day—in fact, all operations under the influence of\r\ngreater or less mischances, the whole bringing in a real or fictitious\r\ncapital of about fifteen millions. I think this is about your position,\r\nis it not?”\r\n\r\n“Confound it, yes!” replied Danglars.\r\n\r\n“The result, then, of six more such months as this would be to reduce\r\nthe third-rate house to despair.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Danglars, becoming very pale, how you are running on!”\r\n\r\n“Let us imagine seven such months,” continued Monte Cristo, in the same\r\ntone. “Tell me, have you ever thought that seven times 1,700,000 francs\r\nmake nearly twelve millions? No, you have not;—well, you are right, for\r\nif you indulged in such reflections, you would never risk your\r\nprincipal, which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized\r\nman. We have our clothes, some more splendid than others,—this is our\r\ncredit; but when a man dies he has only his skin; in the same way, on\r\nretiring from business, you have nothing but your real principal of\r\nabout five or six millions, at the most; for third-rate fortunes are\r\nnever more than a fourth of what they appear to be, like the locomotive\r\non a railway, the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam\r\nsurrounding it. Well, out of the five or six millions which form your\r\nreal capital, you have just lost nearly two millions, which must, of\r\ncourse, in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune;\r\nto follow out my simile, your skin has been opened by bleeding, and\r\nthis if repeated three or four times will cause death—so pay attention\r\nto it, my dear Monsieur Danglars. Do you want money? Do you wish me to\r\nlend you some?”\r\n\r\n30253m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What a bad calculator you are!” exclaimed Danglars, calling to his\r\nassistance all his philosophy and dissimulation. “I have made money at\r\nthe same time by speculations which have succeeded. I have made up the\r\nloss of blood by nutrition. I lost a battle in Spain, I have been\r\ndefeated in Trieste, but my naval army in India will have taken some\r\ngalleons, and my Mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, very good! But the wound remains and will reopen at the\r\nfirst loss.”\r\n\r\n“No, for I am only embarked in certainties,” replied Danglars, with the\r\nair of a mountebank sounding his own praises; “to involve me, three\r\ngovernments must crumble to dust.”\r\n\r\n“Well, such things have been.”\r\n\r\n“That there should be a famine!”\r\n\r\n“Recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine.”\r\n\r\n“Or, that the sea should become dry, as in the days of Pharaoh, and\r\neven then my vessels would become caravans.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better. I congratulate you, my dear M. Danglars,” said\r\nMonte Cristo; “I see I was deceived, and that you belong to the class\r\nof second-rate fortunes.”\r\n\r\n“I think I may aspire to that honor,” said Danglars with a smile, which\r\nreminded Monte Cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond\r\nof daubing into their pictures of ruins. “But, while we are speaking of\r\nbusiness,” Danglars added, pleased to find an opportunity of changing\r\nthe subject, “tell me what I am to do for M. Cavalcanti.”\r\n\r\n“Give him money, if he is recommended to you, and the recommendation\r\nseems good.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent; he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40,000\r\nfrancs, payable at sight, on you, signed by Busoni, and returned by you\r\nto me, with your endorsement—of course, I immediately counted him over\r\nthe forty bank-notes.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo nodded his head in token of assent.\r\n\r\n“But that is not all,” continued Danglars; “he has opened an account\r\nwith my house for his son.”\r\n\r\n“May I ask how much he allows the young man?”\r\n\r\n“Five thousand francs per month.”\r\n\r\n“Sixty thousand francs per year. I thought I was right in believing\r\nthat Cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow. How can a young man live upon\r\n5,000 francs a month?”\r\n\r\n“But you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands\r\nmore——”\r\n\r\n“Do not advance it; the father will never repay it. You do not know\r\nthese ultramontane millionaires; they are regular misers. And by whom\r\nwere they recommended to you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, by the house of Fenzi, one of the best in Florence.”\r\n\r\n“I do not mean to say you will lose, but, nevertheless, mind you hold\r\nto the terms of the agreement.”\r\n\r\n“Would you not trust the Cavalcanti?”\r\n\r\n“I? oh, I would advance ten millions on his signature. I was only\r\nspeaking in reference to the second-rate fortunes we were mentioning\r\njust now.”\r\n\r\n“And with all this, how unassuming he is! I should never have taken him\r\nfor anything more than a mere major.”\r\n\r\n“And you would have flattered him, for certainly, as you say, he has no\r\nmanner. The first time I saw him he appeared to me like an old\r\nlieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets. But all the\r\nItalians are the same; they are like old Jews when they are not\r\nglittering in Oriental splendor.”\r\n\r\n“The young man is better,” said Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Yes; a little nervous, perhaps, but, upon the whole, he appeared\r\ntolerable. I was uneasy about him.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because you met him at my house, just after his introduction into the\r\nworld, as they told me. He has been travelling with a very severe\r\ntutor, and had never been to Paris before.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I believe noblemen marry amongst themselves, do they not?” asked\r\nDanglars carelessly; “they like to unite their fortunes.”\r\n\r\n“It is usual, certainly; but Cavalcanti is an original who does nothing\r\nlike other people. I cannot help thinking that he has brought his son\r\nto France to choose a wife.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?”\r\n\r\n“I am sure of it.”\r\n\r\n“And you have heard his fortune mentioned?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing else was talked of; only some said he was worth millions, and\r\nothers that he did not possess a farthing.”\r\n\r\n“And what is your opinion?”\r\n\r\n“I ought not to influence you, because it is only my own personal\r\nimpression.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and it is that——”\r\n\r\n“My opinion is, that all these old _podestàs_, these ancient\r\n_condottieri_,—for the Cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed\r\nprovinces,—my opinion, I say, is, that they have buried their millions\r\nin corners, the secret of which they have transmitted only to their\r\neldest sons, who have done the same from generation to generation; and\r\nthe proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance, like the\r\nflorins of the republic, which, from being constantly gazed upon, have\r\nbecome reflected in them.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Danglars, “and this is further supported by the fact\r\nof their not possessing an inch of land.”\r\n\r\n“Very little, at least; I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses,\r\nexcepting his palace in Lucca.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, he has a palace?” said Danglars, laughing; “come, that is\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and more than that, he lets it to the Minister of Finance while\r\nhe lives in a simple house. Oh, as I told you before, I think the old\r\nfellow is very close.”\r\n\r\n“Come, you do not flatter him.”\r\n\r\n“I scarcely know him; I think I have seen him three times in my life;\r\nall I know relating to him is through Busoni and himself. He was\r\ntelling me this morning that, tired of letting his property lie dormant\r\nin Italy, which is a dead nation, he wished to find a method, either in\r\nFrance or England, of multiplying his millions, but remember, that\r\nthough I place great confidence in Busoni, I am not responsible for\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me. It is a\r\nfine name to inscribe on my ledgers, and my cashier was quite proud of\r\nit when I explained to him who the Cavalcanti were. By the way, this is\r\nmerely a simple question, when this sort of people marry their sons, do\r\nthey give them any fortune?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that depends upon circumstances. I know an Italian prince, rich as\r\na gold mine, one of the noblest families in Tuscany, who, when his sons\r\nmarried according to his wish, gave them millions; and when they\r\nmarried against his consent, merely allowed them thirty crowns a month.\r\nShould Andrea marry according to his father’s views, he will, perhaps,\r\ngive him one, two, or three millions. For example, supposing it were\r\nthe daughter of a banker, he might take an interest in the house of the\r\nfather-in-law of his son; then again, if he disliked his choice, the\r\nmajor takes the key, double-locks his coffer, and Master Andrea would\r\nbe obliged to live like the sons of a Parisian family, by shuffling\r\ncards or rattling the dice.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that boy will find out some Bavarian or Peruvian princess; he will\r\nwant a crown, an El Dorado, and Potosí.”\r\n\r\n“No; these grand lords on the other side of the Alps frequently marry\r\ninto plain families; like Jupiter, they like to cross the race. But do\r\nyou wish to marry Andrea, my dear M. Danglars, that you are asking so\r\nmany questions?”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_,” said Danglars, “it would not be a bad speculation, I fancy,\r\nand you know I am a speculator.”\r\n\r\n“You are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars, I hope; you would not\r\nlike poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert?”\r\n\r\n“Albert,” repeated Danglars, shrugging his shoulders; “ah, well; he\r\nwould care very little about it, I think.”\r\n\r\n“But he is betrothed to your daughter, I believe?”\r\n\r\n“Well, M. de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage, but Madame\r\nde Morcerf and Albert——”\r\n\r\n“You do not mean to say that it would not be a good match?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M. de\r\nMorcerf.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle Danglars’ fortune will be great, no doubt, especially if\r\nthe telegraph should not make any more mistakes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I do not mean her fortune only; but tell me——”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Why did you not invite M. and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner?”\r\n\r\n“I did so, but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being\r\nobliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea air.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” said Danglars, laughing, “it would do her a great deal of\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?”\r\n\r\n“Because it is the air she always breathed in her youth.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo took no notice of this ill-natured remark.\r\n\r\n“But still, if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars,” said\r\nthe count, “you must allow that he has a fine name?”\r\n\r\n“So he has; but I like mine as well.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; your name is popular, and does honor to the title they have\r\nadorned it with; but you are too intelligent not to know that according\r\nto a prejudice, too firmly rooted to be exterminated, a nobility which\r\ndates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon\r\ntwenty years.”\r\n\r\n“And for this very reason,” said Danglars with a smile, which he tried\r\nto make sardonic, “I prefer M. Andrea Cavalcanti to M. Albert de\r\nMorcerf.”\r\n\r\n“Still, I should not think the Morcerfs would yield to the Cavalcanti?”\r\n\r\n“The Morcerfs!—Stay, my dear count,” said Danglars; “you are a man of\r\nthe world, are you not?”\r\n\r\n“I think so.”\r\n\r\n“And you understand heraldry?”\r\n\r\n“A little.”\r\n\r\n“Well, look at my coat-of-arms, it is worth more than Morcerf’s.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?”\r\n\r\n“Because, though I am not a baron by birth, my real name is, at least,\r\nDanglars.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what then?”\r\n\r\n“While his name is not Morcerf.”\r\n\r\n“How?—not Morcerf?”\r\n\r\n“Not the least in the world.”\r\n\r\n“Go on.”\r\n\r\n“I have been made a baron, so that I actually am one; he made himself a\r\ncount, so that he is not one at all.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!”\r\n\r\n“Listen my dear count; M. de Morcerf has been my friend, or rather my\r\nacquaintance, during the last thirty years. You know I have made the\r\nmost of my arms, though I never forgot my origin.”\r\n\r\n“A proof of great humility or great pride,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Well, when I was a clerk, Morcerf was a mere fisherman.”\r\n\r\n“And then he was called——”\r\n\r\n“Fernand.”\r\n\r\n“Only Fernand?”\r\n\r\n“Fernand Mondego.”\r\n\r\n“You are sure?”\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_ I have bought enough fish of him to know his name.”\r\n\r\n“Then, why did you think of giving your daughter to him?”\r\n\r\n“Because Fernand and Danglars, being both parvenus, both having become\r\nnoble, both rich, are about equal in worth, excepting that there have\r\nbeen certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes; what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of\r\nFernand Mondego. I have heard that name in Greece.”\r\n\r\n“In conjunction with the affairs of Ali Pasha?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so.”\r\n\r\n“This is the mystery,” said Danglars. “I acknowledge I would have given\r\nanything to find it out.”\r\n\r\n“It would be very easy if you much wished it?”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“Probably you have some correspondent in Greece?”\r\n\r\n“I should think so.”\r\n\r\n“At Yanina?”\r\n\r\n“Everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“Well, write to your correspondent in Yanina, and ask him what part was\r\nplayed by a Frenchman named Fernand Mondego in the catastrophe of Ali\r\nTepelini.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” exclaimed Danglars, rising quickly, “I will write\r\ntoday.”\r\n\r\n“Do so.”\r\n\r\n“I will.”\r\n\r\n30259m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“And if you should hear of anything very scandalous——”\r\n\r\n“I will communicate it to you.”\r\n\r\n“You will oblige me.”\r\n\r\nDanglars rushed out of the room, and made but one leap into his\r\n_coupé_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 67. The Office of the King’s Attorney\r\n\r\nLet us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed, and\r\nfollow Madame Danglars in her morning excursion. We have said that at\r\nhalf-past twelve o’clock Madame Danglars had ordered her horses, and\r\nhad left home in the carriage. She directed her course towards the\r\nFaubourg Saint Germain, went down the Rue Mazarine, and stopped at the\r\nPassage du Pont-Neuf. She descended, and went through the passage. She\r\nwas very plainly dressed, as would be the case with a woman of taste\r\nwalking in the morning. At the Rue Guénégaud she called a cab, and\r\ndirected the driver to go to the Rue de Harlay. As soon as she was\r\nseated in the vehicle, she drew from her pocket a very thick black\r\nveil, which she tied on to her straw bonnet. She then replaced the\r\nbonnet, and saw with pleasure, in a little pocket-mirror, that her\r\nwhite complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible. The cab crossed\r\nthe Pont-Neuf and entered the Rue de Harlay by the Place Dauphine; the\r\ndriver was paid as the door opened, and stepping lightly up the stairs\r\nMadame Danglars soon reached the Salle des Pas-Perdus.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal going on that morning, and many business-like\r\npersons at the Palais; business-like persons pay very little attention\r\nto women, and Madame Danglars crossed the hall without exciting any\r\nmore attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer.\r\n\r\nThere was a great press of people in M. de Villefort’s antechamber, but\r\nMadame Danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name. The instant\r\nshe appeared the door-keeper rose, came to her, and asked her whether\r\nshe was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment;\r\nand on her affirmative answer being given, he conducted her by a\r\nprivate passage to M. de Villefort’s office.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate was seated in an armchair, writing, with his back\r\ntowards the door; he did not move as he heard it open, and the\r\ndoor-keeper pronounce the words, “Walk in, madame,” and then reclose\r\nit; but no sooner had the man’s footsteps ceased, than he started up,\r\ndrew the bolts, closed the curtains, and examined every corner of the\r\nroom. Then, when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen\r\nnor heard, and was consequently relieved of doubts, he said:\r\n\r\n“Thanks, madame,—thanks for your punctuality;” and he offered a chair\r\nto Madame Danglars, which she accepted, for her heart beat so violently\r\nthat she felt nearly suffocated.\r\n\r\n30261m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is a long time, madame,” said the procureur, describing a\r\nhalf-circle with his chair, so as to place himself exactly opposite to\r\nMadame Danglars,—“it is a long time since I had the pleasure of\r\nspeaking alone with you, and I regret that we have only now met to\r\nenter upon a painful conversation.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, sir, you see I have answered your first appeal, although\r\ncertainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for\r\nyou.” Villefort smiled bitterly.\r\n\r\n“It is true, then,” he said, rather uttering his thoughts aloud than\r\naddressing his companion,—“it is true, then, that all our actions leave\r\ntheir traces—some sad, others bright—on our paths; it is true that\r\nevery step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the\r\nsands;—it leaves its track! Alas, to many the path is traced by tears.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Madame Danglars, “you can feel for my emotion, can you not?\r\nSpare me, then, I beseech you. When I look at this room,—whence so many\r\nguilty creatures have departed, trembling and ashamed, when I look at\r\nthat chair before which I now sit trembling and ashamed,—oh, it\r\nrequires all my reason to convince me that I am not a very guilty woman\r\nand you a menacing judge.”\r\n\r\nVillefort dropped his head and sighed.\r\n\r\n“And I,” he said, “I feel that my place is not in the judge’s seat, but\r\non the prisoner’s bench.”\r\n\r\n30263m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You?” said Madame Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I.”\r\n\r\n“I think, sir, you exaggerate your situation,” said Madame Danglars,\r\nwhose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment. “The paths of which you\r\nwere just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent\r\nimaginations. Besides the pleasure, there is always remorse from the\r\nindulgence of our passions, and, after all, what have you men to fear\r\nfrom all this? the world excuses, and notoriety ennobles you.”\r\n\r\n“Madame,” replied Villefort, “you know that I am no hypocrite, or, at\r\nleast, that I never deceive without a reason. If my brow be severe, it\r\nis because many misfortunes have clouded it; if my heart be petrified,\r\nit is that it might sustain the blows it has received. I was not so in\r\nmy youth, I was not so on the night of the betrothal, when we were all\r\nseated around a table in the Rue du Cours at Marseilles. But since then\r\neverything has changed in and about me; I am accustomed to brave\r\ndifficulties, and, in the conflict to crush those who, by their own\r\nfree will, or by chance, voluntarily or involuntarily, interfere with\r\nme in my career. It is generally the case that what we most ardently\r\ndesire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it,\r\nor from whom we attempt to snatch it. Thus, the greater number of a\r\nman’s errors come before him disguised under the specious form of\r\nnecessity; then, after error has been committed in a moment of\r\nexcitement, of delirium, or of fear, we see that we might have avoided\r\nand escaped it. The means we might have used, which we in our blindness\r\ncould not see, then seem simple and easy, and we say, ‘Why did I not do\r\nthis, instead of that?’ Women, on the contrary, are rarely tormented\r\nwith remorse; for the decision does not come from you,—your misfortunes\r\nare generally imposed upon you, and your faults the results of others’\r\ncrimes.”\r\n\r\n“In any case, sir, you will allow,” replied Madame Danglars, “that,\r\neven if the fault were alone mine, I last night received a severe\r\npunishment for it.”\r\n\r\n“Poor thing,” said Villefort, pressing her hand, “it was too severe for\r\nyour strength, for you were twice overwhelmed, and yet——”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I must tell you. Collect all your courage, for you have not yet\r\nheard all.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” exclaimed Madame Danglars, alarmed, “what is there more to hear?”\r\n\r\n“You only look back to the past, and it is, indeed, bad enough. Well,\r\npicture to yourself a future more gloomy still—certainly frightful,\r\nperhaps sanguinary!”\r\n\r\nThe baroness knew how calm Villefort naturally was, and his present\r\nexcitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream,\r\nbut the sound died in her throat.\r\n\r\n“How has this terrible past been recalled?” cried Villefort; “how is it\r\nthat it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our\r\nhearts, where it was buried, to visit us now, like a phantom, whitening\r\nour cheeks and flushing our brows with shame?”\r\n\r\n“Alas,” said Hermine, “doubtless it is chance.”\r\n\r\n“Chance?” replied Villefort; “No, no, madame, there is no such thing as\r\nchance.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; has not a fatal chance revealed all this? Was it not by\r\nchance the Count of Monte Cristo bought that house? Was it not by\r\nchance he caused the earth to be dug up? Is it not by chance that the\r\nunfortunate child was disinterred under the trees?—that poor innocent\r\noffspring of mine, which I never even kissed, but for whom I wept many,\r\nmany tears. Ah, my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear\r\nspoil found beneath the flowers.”\r\n\r\n“Well, no, madame,—this is the terrible news I have to tell you,” said\r\nVillefort in a hollow voice—“no, nothing was found beneath the flowers;\r\nthere was no child disinterred—no. You must not weep, no, you must not\r\ngroan, you must tremble!”\r\n\r\n“What can you mean?” asked Madame Danglars, shuddering.\r\n\r\n“I mean that M. de Monte Cristo, digging underneath these trees, found\r\nneither skeleton nor chest, because neither of them was there!”\r\n\r\n“Neither of them there?” repeated Madame Danglars, her staring,\r\nwide-open eyes expressing her alarm. “Neither of them there!” she again\r\nsaid, as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the\r\nwords which escaped her.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Villefort, burying his face in his hands, “no, a hundred\r\ntimes no!”\r\n\r\n“Then you did not bury the poor child there, sir? Why did you deceive\r\nme? Where did you place it? tell me—where?”\r\n\r\n“There! But listen to me—listen—and you will pity me who has for twenty\r\nyears alone borne the heavy burden of grief I am about to reveal,\r\nwithout casting the least portion upon you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you frighten me! But speak; I will listen.”\r\n\r\n“You recollect that sad night, when you were half-expiring on that bed\r\nin the red damask room, while I, scarcely less agitated than you,\r\nawaited your delivery. The child was born, was given to me—motionless,\r\nbreathless, voiceless; we thought it dead.”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars moved rapidly, as though she would spring from her\r\nchair, but Villefort stopped, and clasped his hands as if to implore\r\nher attention.\r\n\r\n“We thought it dead,” he repeated; “I placed it in the chest, which was\r\nto take the place of a coffin; I descended to the garden, I dug a hole,\r\nand then flung it down in haste. Scarcely had I covered it with earth,\r\nwhen the arm of the Corsican was stretched towards me; I saw a shadow\r\nrise, and, at the same time, a flash of light. I felt pain; I wished to\r\ncry out, but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice; I\r\nfell lifeless, and fancied myself killed. Never shall I forget your\r\nsublime courage, when, having returned to consciousness, I dragged\r\nmyself to the foot of the stairs, and you, almost dying yourself, came\r\nto meet me. We were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful\r\ncatastrophe. You had the fortitude to regain the house, assisted by\r\nyour nurse. A duel was the pretext for my wound. Though we scarcely\r\nexpected it, our secret remained in our own keeping alone. I was taken\r\nto Versailles; for three months I struggled with death; at last, as I\r\nseemed to cling to life, I was ordered to the South. Four men carried\r\nme from Paris to Châlons, walking six leagues a day; Madame de\r\nVillefort followed the litter in her carriage. At Châlons I was put\r\nupon the Saône, thence I passed on to the Rhône, whence I descended,\r\nmerely with the current, to Arles; at Arles I was again placed on my\r\nlitter, and continued my journey to Marseilles. My recovery lasted six\r\nmonths. I never heard you mentioned, and I did not dare inquire for\r\nyou. When I returned to Paris, I learned that you, the widow of M. de\r\nNargonne, had married M. Danglars.\r\n\r\n“What was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness\r\nreturned to me? Always the same—always the child’s corpse, coming every\r\nnight in my dreams, rising from the earth, and hovering over the grave\r\nwith menacing look and gesture. I inquired immediately on my return to\r\nParis; the house had not been inhabited since we left it, but it had\r\njust been let for nine years. I found the tenant. I pretended that I\r\ndisliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife’s father and mother\r\nshould pass into the hands of strangers. I offered to pay them for\r\ncancelling the lease; they demanded 6,000 francs. I would have given\r\n10,000—I would have given 20,000. I had the money with me; I made the\r\ntenant sign the deed of resilition, and when I had obtained what I so\r\nmuch wanted, I galloped to Auteuil. No one had entered the house since\r\nI had left it.\r\n\r\n“It was five o’clock in the afternoon; I ascended into the red room,\r\nand waited for night. There all the thoughts which had disturbed me\r\nduring my year of constant agony came back with double force. The\r\nCorsican, who had declared the vendetta against me, who had followed me\r\nfrom Nîmes to Paris, who had hid himself in the garden, who had struck\r\nme, had seen me dig the grave, had seen me inter the child,—he might\r\nbecome acquainted with your person,—nay, he might even then have known\r\nit. Would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret?\r\nWould it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that I had not\r\ndied from the blow of his dagger? It was therefore necessary, before\r\neverything else, and at all risks, that I should cause all traces of\r\nthe past to disappear—that I should destroy every material vestige; too\r\nmuch reality would always remain in my recollection. It was for this I\r\nhad annulled the lease—it was for this I had come—it was for this I was\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\n“Night arrived; I allowed it to become quite dark. I was without a\r\nlight in that room; when the wind shook all the doors, behind which I\r\ncontinually expected to see some spy concealed, I trembled. I seemed\r\neverywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed, and I dared not\r\nturn around. My heart beat so violently that I feared my wound would\r\nopen. At length, one by one, all the noises in the neighborhood ceased.\r\nI understood that I had nothing to fear, that I should neither be seen\r\nnor heard, so I decided upon descending to the garden.\r\n\r\n“Listen, Hermine; I consider myself as brave as most men, but when I\r\ndrew from my breast the little key of the staircase, which I had found\r\nin my coat—that little key we both used to cherish so much, which you\r\nwished to have fastened to a golden ring—when I opened the door, and\r\nsaw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral\r\nstaircase like a spectre, I leaned against the wall, and nearly\r\nshrieked. I seemed to be going mad. At last I mastered my agitation. I\r\ndescended the staircase step by step; the only thing I could not\r\nconquer was a strange trembling in my knees. I grasped the railings; if\r\nI had relaxed my hold for a moment, I should have fallen. I reached the\r\nlower door. Outside this door a spade was placed against the wall; I\r\ntook it, and advanced towards the thicket. I had provided myself with a\r\ndark lantern. In the middle of the lawn I stopped to light it, then I\r\ncontinued my path.\r\n\r\n“It was the end of November, all the verdure of the garden had\r\ndisappeared, the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long\r\nbony arms, and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet. My\r\nterror overcame me to such a degree as I approached the thicket, that I\r\ntook a pistol from my pocket and armed myself. I fancied continually\r\nthat I saw the figure of the Corsican between the branches. I examined\r\nthe thicket with my dark lantern; it was empty. I looked carefully\r\naround; I was indeed alone,—no noise disturbed the silence but the owl,\r\nwhose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night. I\r\ntied my lantern to a forked branch I had noticed a year before at the\r\nprecise spot where I stopped to dig the hole.\r\n\r\n“The grass had grown very thickly there during the summer, and when\r\nautumn arrived no one had been there to mow it. Still one place where\r\nthe grass was thin attracted my attention; it evidently was there I had\r\nturned up the ground. I went to work. The hour, then, for which I had\r\nbeen waiting during the last year had at length arrived. How I worked,\r\nhow I hoped, how I struck every piece of turf, thinking to find some\r\nresistance to my spade! But no, I found nothing, though I had made a\r\nhole twice as large as the first. I thought I had been deceived—had\r\nmistaken the spot. I turned around, I looked at the trees, I tried to\r\nrecall the details which had struck me at the time. A cold, sharp wind\r\nwhistled through the leafless branches, and yet the drops fell from my\r\nforehead. I recollected that I was stabbed just as I was trampling the\r\nground to fill up the hole; while doing so I had leaned against a\r\nlaburnum; behind me was an artificial rockery, intended to serve as a\r\nresting-place for persons walking in the garden; in falling, my hand,\r\nrelaxing its hold of the laburnum, felt the coldness of the stone. On\r\nmy right I saw the tree, behind me the rock. I stood in the same\r\nattitude, and threw myself down. I rose, and again began digging and\r\nenlarging the hole; still I found nothing, nothing—the chest was no\r\nlonger there!”\r\n\r\n30269m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“The chest no longer there?” murmured Madame Danglars, choking with\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n“Think not I contented myself with this one effort,” continued\r\nVillefort. “No; I searched the whole thicket. I thought the assassin,\r\nhaving discovered the chest, and supposing it to be a treasure, had\r\nintended carrying it off, but, perceiving his error, had dug another\r\nhole, and deposited it there; but I could find nothing. Then the idea\r\nstruck me that he had not taken these precautions, and had simply\r\nthrown it in a corner. In the last case I must wait for daylight to\r\nrenew my search. I remained in the room and waited.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Heaven!”\r\n\r\n30271m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen daylight dawned I went down again. My first visit was to the\r\nthicket. I hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the\r\ndarkness. I had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty\r\nfeet square, and a depth of two feet. A laborer would not have done in\r\na day what occupied me an hour. But I could find nothing—absolutely\r\nnothing. Then I renewed the search. Supposing it had been thrown aside,\r\nit would probably be on the path which led to the little gate; but this\r\nexamination was as useless as the first, and with a bursting heart I\r\nreturned to the thicket, which now contained no hope for me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried Madame Danglars, “it was enough to drive you mad!”\r\n\r\n“I hoped for a moment that it might,” said Villefort; “but that\r\nhappiness was denied me. However, recovering my strength and my ideas,\r\n‘Why,’ said I, ‘should that man have carried away the corpse?’”\r\n\r\n“But you said,” replied Madame Danglars, “he would require it as a\r\nproof.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, no, madame, that could not be. Dead bodies are not kept a year;\r\nthey are shown to a magistrate, and the evidence is taken. Now, nothing\r\nof the kind has happened.”\r\n\r\n“What then?” asked Hermine, trembling violently.\r\n\r\n“Something more terrible, more fatal, more alarming for us—the child\r\nwas, perhaps, alive, and the assassin may have saved it!”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars uttered a piercing cry, and, seizing Villefort’s hands,\r\nexclaimed, “My child was alive?” said she; “you buried my child alive?\r\nYou were not certain my child was dead, and you buried it? Ah——”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars had risen, and stood before the procureur, whose hands\r\nshe wrung in her feeble grasp.\r\n\r\n“I know not; I merely suppose so, as I might suppose anything else,”\r\nreplied Villefort with a look so fixed, it indicated that his powerful\r\nmind was on the verge of despair and madness.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my child, my poor child!” cried the baroness, falling on her\r\nchair, and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief. Villefort, becoming\r\nsomewhat reassured, perceived that to avert the maternal storm\r\ngathering over his head, he must inspire Madame Danglars with the\r\nterror he felt.\r\n\r\n“You understand, then, that if it were so,” said he, rising in his\r\nturn, and approaching the baroness, to speak to her in a lower tone,\r\n“we are lost. This child lives, and someone knows it lives—someone is\r\nin possession of our secret; and since Monte Cristo speaks before us of\r\na child disinterred, when that child could not be found, it is he who\r\nis in possession of our secret.”\r\n\r\n“Just God, avenging God!” murmured Madame Danglars.\r\n\r\nVillefort’s only answer was a stifled groan.\r\n\r\n“But the child—the child, sir?” repeated the agitated mother.\r\n\r\n“How I have searched for him,” replied Villefort, wringing his hands;\r\n“how I have called him in my long sleepless nights; how I have longed\r\nfor royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of\r\nmen, and to find mine among them! At last, one day, when for the\r\nhundredth time I took up my spade, I asked myself again and again what\r\nthe Corsican could have done with the child. A child encumbers a\r\nfugitive; perhaps, on perceiving it was still alive, he had thrown it\r\ninto the river.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!” cried Madame Danglars: “a man may murder another out of\r\nrevenge, but he would not deliberately drown a child.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” continued Villefort, “he had put it in the foundling\r\nhospital.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, yes,” cried the baroness; “my child is there!”\r\n\r\n“I ran to the hospital, and learned that the same night—the night of\r\nthe 20th of September—a child had been brought there, wrapped in part\r\nof a fine linen napkin, purposely torn in half. This portion of the\r\nnapkin was marked with half a baron’s crown, and the letter H.”\r\n\r\n“Truly, truly,” said Madame Danglars, “all my linen is marked thus;\r\nMonsieur de Nargonne was a baron, and my name is Hermine. Thank God, my\r\nchild was not then dead!”\r\n\r\n“No, it was not dead.”\r\n\r\n“And you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy? Where is\r\nthe child?”\r\n\r\nVillefort shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Do I know?” said he; “and do you believe that if I knew I would relate\r\nto you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a\r\nnovel writer? Alas, no, I know not. A woman, about six months after,\r\ncame to claim it with the other half of the napkin. This woman gave all\r\nthe requisite particulars, and it was intrusted to her.”\r\n\r\n“But you should have inquired for the woman; you should have traced\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“And what do you think I did? I feigned a criminal process, and\r\nemployed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of\r\nher. They traced her to Châlons, and there they lost her.”\r\n\r\n“They lost her?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, forever.”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh, a tear, or a\r\nshriek for every detail. “And this is all?” said she; “and you stopped\r\nthere?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” said Villefort; “I never ceased to search and to inquire.\r\nHowever, the last two or three years I had allowed myself some respite.\r\nBut now I will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever, since\r\nfear urges me, not my conscience.”\r\n\r\n“But,” replied Madame Danglars, “the Count of Monte Cristo can know\r\nnothing, or he would not seek our society as he does.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the wickedness of man is very great,” said Villefort, “since it\r\nsurpasses the goodness of God. Did you observe that man’s eyes while he\r\nwas speaking to us?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“But have you ever watched him carefully?”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless he is capricious, but that is all; one thing alone struck\r\nme,—of all the exquisite things he placed before us, he touched\r\nnothing. I might have suspected he was poisoning us.”\r\n\r\n“And you see you would have been deceived.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, doubtless.”\r\n\r\n“But believe me, that man has other projects. For that reason I wished\r\nto see you, to speak to you, to warn you against everyone, but\r\nespecially against him. Tell me,” cried Villefort, fixing his eyes more\r\nsteadfastly on her than he had ever done before, “did you ever reveal\r\nto anyone our connection?”\r\n\r\n“Never, to anyone.”\r\n\r\n“You understand me,” replied Villefort, affectionately; “when I say\r\nanyone,—pardon my urgency,—to anyone living I mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I understand very well,” ejaculated the baroness; “never, I\r\nswear to you.”\r\n\r\n“Were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had\r\ntranspired in the morning? Do you keep a journal?”\r\n\r\n“No, my life has been passed in frivolity; I wish to forget it myself.”\r\n\r\n“Do you talk in your sleep?”\r\n\r\n30275m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I sleep soundly, like a child; do you not remember?”\r\n\r\nThe color mounted to the baroness’s face, and Villefort turned awfully\r\npale.\r\n\r\n“It is true,” said he, in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said the baroness.\r\n\r\n“Well, I understand what I now have to do,” replied Villefort. “In less\r\nthan one week from this time I will ascertain who this M. de Monte\r\nCristo is, whence he comes, where he goes, and why he speaks in our\r\npresence of children that have been disinterred in a garden.”\r\n\r\nVillefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made\r\nthe count shudder had he heard him. Then he pressed the hand the\r\nbaroness reluctantly gave him, and led her respectfully back to the\r\ndoor. Madame Danglars returned in another cab to the passage, on the\r\nother side of which she found her carriage, and her coachman sleeping\r\npeacefully on his box while waiting for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 68. A Summer Ball\r\n\r\nThe same day during the interview between Madame Danglars and the\r\nprocureur, a travelling-carriage entered the Rue du Helder, passed\r\nthrough the gateway of No. 27, and stopped in the yard. In a moment the\r\ndoor was opened, and Madame de Morcerf alighted, leaning on her son’s\r\narm. Albert soon left her, ordered his horses, and having arranged his\r\ntoilet, drove to the Champs-Élysées, to the house of Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\nThe count received him with his habitual smile. It was a strange thing\r\nthat no one ever appeared to advance a step in that man’s favor. Those\r\nwho would, as it were, force a passage to his heart, found an\r\nimpassable barrier. Morcerf, who ran towards him with open arms, was\r\nchilled as he drew near, in spite of the friendly smile, and simply\r\nheld out his hand. Monte Cristo shook it coldly, according to his\r\ninvariable practice.\r\n\r\n“Here I am, dear count.”\r\n\r\n“Welcome home again.”\r\n\r\n“I arrived an hour since.”\r\n\r\n“From Dieppe?”\r\n\r\n“No, from Tréport.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\n“And I have come at once to see you.”\r\n\r\n“That is extremely kind of you,” said Monte Cristo with a tone of\r\nperfect indifference.\r\n\r\n“And what is the news?”\r\n\r\n“You should not ask a stranger, a foreigner, for news.”\r\n\r\n“I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything for\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Had you commissioned me?” said Monte Cristo, feigning uneasiness.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said Albert, “do not assume so much indifference. It is\r\nsaid, sympathy travels rapidly, and when at Tréport, I felt the\r\nelectric shock; you have either been working for me or thinking of me.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly,” said Monte Cristo, “I have indeed thought of you, but the\r\nmagnetic wire I was guiding acted, indeed, without my knowledge.”\r\n\r\n30277m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Indeed! Pray tell me how it happened.”\r\n\r\n“Willingly. M. Danglars dined with me.”\r\n\r\n“I know it; to avoid meeting him, my mother and I left town.”\r\n\r\n“But he met here M. Andrea Cavalcanti.”\r\n\r\n“Your Italian prince?”\r\n\r\n“Not so fast; M. Andrea only calls himself count.”\r\n\r\n“Calls himself, do you say?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, calls himself.”\r\n\r\n“Is he not a count?”\r\n\r\n“What can I know of him? He calls himself so. I, of course, give him\r\nthe same title, and everyone else does likewise.”\r\n\r\n“What a strange man you are! What next? You say M. Danglars dined\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, with Count Cavalcanti, the marquis his father, Madame Danglars,\r\nM. and Madame de Villefort,—charming people,—M. Debray, Maximilian\r\nMorrel, and M. de Château-Renaud.”\r\n\r\n“Did they speak of me?”\r\n\r\n“Not a word.”\r\n\r\n“So much the worse.”\r\n\r\n“Why so? I thought you wished them to forget you?”\r\n\r\n“If they did not speak of me, I am sure they thought about me, and I am\r\nin despair.”\r\n\r\n“How will that affect you, since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among\r\nthe number here who thought of you? Truly, she might have thought of\r\nyou at home.”\r\n\r\n“I have no fear of that; or, if she did, it was only in the same way in\r\nwhich I think of her.”\r\n\r\n“Touching sympathy! So you hate each other?” said the count.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said Morcerf—“if Mademoiselle Danglars were disposed to take\r\npity on my supposed martyrdom on her account, and would dispense with\r\nall matrimonial formalities between our two families, I am ready to\r\nagree to the arrangement. In a word, Mademoiselle Danglars would make a\r\ncharming mistress—but a wife—_diable!_”\r\n\r\n“And this,” said Monte Cristo, “is your opinion of your intended\r\nspouse?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it is rather unkind, I acknowledge, but it is true. But as this\r\ndream cannot be realized, since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my\r\nlawful wife, live perpetually with me, sing to me, compose verses and\r\nmusic within ten paces of me, and that for my whole life, it frightens\r\nme. One may forsake a mistress, but a wife,—good heavens! There she\r\nmust always be; and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be awful.”\r\n\r\n“You are difficult to please, viscount.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for I often wish for what is impossible.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“To find such a wife as my father found.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo turned pale, and looked at Albert, while playing with some\r\nmagnificent pistols.\r\n\r\n“Your father was fortunate, then?” said he.\r\n\r\n“You know my opinion of my mother, count; look at her,—still beautiful,\r\nwitty, more charming than ever. For any other son to have stayed with\r\nhis mother for four days at Tréport, it would have been a condescension\r\nor a martyrdom, while I return, more contented, more peaceful—shall I\r\nsay more poetic!—than if I had taken Queen Mab or Titania as my\r\ncompanion.”\r\n\r\n30279m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“That is an overwhelming demonstration, and you would make everyone vow\r\nto live a single life.”\r\n\r\n“Such are my reasons for not liking to marry Mademoiselle Danglars.\r\nHave you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we\r\nobtain possession of it? The diamond which glittered in the window at\r\nMarlé’s or Fossin’s shines with more splendor when it is our own; but\r\nif we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another, and\r\nstill must retain the one that is inferior, do you not know what we\r\nhave to endure?”\r\n\r\n“Worldling,” murmured the count.\r\n\r\n“Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eugénie perceives I am but a\r\npitiful atom, with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has\r\nmillions.” Monte Cristo smiled. “One plan occurred to me,” continued\r\nAlbert; “Franz likes all that is eccentric; I tried to make him fall in\r\nlove with Mademoiselle Danglars; but in spite of four letters, written\r\nin the most alluring style, he invariably answered: ‘My eccentricity\r\nmay be great, but it will not make me break my promise.’”\r\n\r\n“That is what I call devoted friendship, to recommend to another one\r\nwhom you would not marry yourself.” Albert smiled.\r\n\r\n“Apropos,” continued he, “Franz is coming soon, but it will not\r\ninterest you; you dislike him, I think?”\r\n\r\n“I?” said Monte Cristo; “my dear viscount, how have you discovered that\r\nI did not like M. Franz! I like everyone.”\r\n\r\n“And you include me in the expression everyone—many thanks!”\r\n\r\n“Let us not mistake,” said Monte Cristo; “I love everyone as God\r\ncommands us to love our neighbor, as Christians; but I thoroughly hate\r\nbut a few. Let us return to M. Franz d’Épinay. Did you say he was\r\ncoming?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; summoned by M. de Villefort, who is apparently as anxious to get\r\nMademoiselle Valentine married as M. Danglars is to see Mademoiselle\r\nEugénie settled. It must be a very irksome office to be the father of a\r\ngrown-up daughter; it seems to make one feverish, and to raise one’s\r\npulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done.”\r\n\r\n“But M. d’Épinay, unlike you, bears his misfortune patiently.”\r\n\r\n“Still more, he talks seriously about the matter, puts on a white tie,\r\nand speaks of his family. He entertains a very high opinion of M. and\r\nMadame de Villefort.”\r\n\r\n“Which they deserve, do they not?”\r\n\r\n“I believe they do. M. de Villefort has always passed for a severe but\r\na just man.”\r\n\r\n“There is, then, one,” said Monte Cristo, “whom you do not condemn like\r\npoor Danglars?”\r\n\r\n“Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps,” replied\r\nAlbert, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, my dear sir,” said Monte Cristo, “you are revoltingly\r\nfoppish.”\r\n\r\n“I foppish? how do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; pray take a cigar, and cease to defend yourself, and to struggle\r\nto escape marrying Mademoiselle Danglars. Let things take their course;\r\nperhaps you may not have to retract.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” said Albert, staring.\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, my dear viscount, you will not be taken by force; and\r\nseriously, do you wish to break off your engagement?”\r\n\r\n“I would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so.”\r\n\r\n“Then make yourself quite easy. M. Danglars would give double that sum\r\nto attain the same end.”\r\n\r\n“Am I, indeed, so happy?” said Albert, who still could not prevent an\r\nalmost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow. “But, my dear\r\ncount, has M. Danglars any reason?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! there is your proud and selfish nature. You would expose the\r\nself-love of another with a hatchet, but you shrink if your own is\r\nattacked with a needle.”\r\n\r\n“But yet, M. Danglars appeared——”\r\n\r\n“Delighted with you, was he not? Well, he is a man of bad taste, and is\r\nstill more enchanted with another. I know not whom; look and judge for\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, I understand. But my mother—no, not my mother; I mistake—my\r\nfather intends giving a ball.”\r\n\r\n“A ball at this season?”\r\n\r\n“Summer balls are fashionable.”\r\n\r\n“If they were not, the countess has only to wish it, and they would\r\nbecome so.”\r\n\r\n“You are right; You know they are select affairs; those who remain in\r\nParis in July must be true Parisians. Will you take charge of our\r\ninvitation to Messieurs Cavalcanti?”\r\n\r\n“When will it take place?”\r\n\r\n“On Saturday.”\r\n\r\n“M. Cavalcanti’s father will be gone.”\r\n\r\n“But the son will be here; will you invite young M. Cavalcanti?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know him, viscount.”\r\n\r\n“You do not know him?”\r\n\r\n“No, I never saw him until a few days since, and am not responsible for\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“But you receive him at your house?”\r\n\r\n“That is another thing: he was recommended to me by a good abbé, who\r\nmay be deceived. Give him a direct invitation, but do not ask me to\r\npresent him. If he were afterwards to marry Mademoiselle Danglars, you\r\nwould accuse me of intrigue, and would be challenging me,—besides, I\r\nmay not be there myself.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“At your ball.”\r\n\r\n“Why should you not be there?”\r\n\r\n“Because you have not yet invited me.”\r\n\r\n“But I come expressly for that purpose.”\r\n\r\n“You are very kind, but I may be prevented.”\r\n\r\n“If I tell you one thing, you will be so amiable as to set aside all\r\nimpediments.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me what it is.”\r\n\r\n“My mother begs you to come.”\r\n\r\n“The Comtesse de Morcerf?” said Monte Cristo, starting.\r\n\r\n“Ah, count,” said Albert, “I assure you Madame de Morcerf speaks freely\r\nto me, and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which I\r\nspoke just now thrill within you, you must be entirely devoid of them,\r\nfor during the last four days we have spoken of no one else.”\r\n\r\n“You have talked of me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is the penalty of being a living puzzle!”\r\n\r\n“Then I am also a puzzle to your mother? I should have thought her too\r\nreasonable to be led by imagination.”\r\n\r\n“A problem, my dear count, for everyone—for my mother as well as\r\nothers; much studied, but not solved, you still remain an enigma, do\r\nnot fear. My mother is only astonished that you remain so long\r\nunsolved. I believe, while the Countess G—— takes you for Lord Ruthven,\r\nmy mother imagines you to be Cagliostro or the Count Saint-Germain. The\r\nfirst opportunity you have, confirm her in her opinion; it will be easy\r\nfor you, as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the\r\nother.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you for the warning,” said the count; “I shall endeavor to be\r\nprepared for all suppositions.”\r\n\r\n“You will, then, come on Saturday?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, since Madame de Morcerf invites me.”\r\n\r\n“You are very kind.”\r\n\r\n“Will M. Danglars be there?”\r\n\r\n“He has already been invited by my father. We shall try to persuade the\r\ngreat d’Aguesseau,11 M. de Villefort, to come, but have not much hope\r\nof seeing him.”\r\n\r\n“‘Never despair of anything,’ says the proverb.”\r\n\r\n“Do you dance, count?”\r\n\r\n“I dance?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you; it would not be astonishing.”\r\n\r\n“That is very well before one is over forty. No, I do not dance, but I\r\nlike to see others do so. Does Madame de Morcerf dance?”\r\n\r\n“Never; you can talk to her, she so delights in your conversation.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\n30283m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes, truly; and I assure you. You are the only man of whom I have\r\nheard her speak with interest.” Albert rose and took his hat; the count\r\nconducted him to the door.\r\n\r\n“I have one thing to reproach myself with,” said he, stopping Albert on\r\nthe steps. “What is it?”\r\n\r\n“I have spoken to you indiscreetly about Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, speak to me always in the same strain about him.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to be reassured on that point. Apropos, when do you aspect\r\nM. d’Épinay?”\r\n\r\n“Five or six days hence at the latest.”\r\n\r\n“And when is he to be married?”\r\n\r\n“Immediately on the arrival of M. and Madame de Saint-Méran.”\r\n\r\n“Bring him to see me. Although you say I do not like him, I assure you\r\nI shall be happy to see him.”\r\n\r\n“I will obey your orders, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“Until Saturday, when I may expect you, may I not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I promised you.” The Count watched Albert, waving his hand to\r\nhim. When he had mounted his phaeton, Monte Cristo turned, and seeing\r\nBertuccio, “What news?” said he.\r\n\r\n“She went to the Palais,” replied the steward.\r\n\r\n“Did she stay long there?”\r\n\r\n“An hour and a half.”\r\n\r\n“Did she return home?”\r\n\r\n“Directly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear Bertuccio,” said the count, “I now advise you to go in\r\nquest of the little estate I spoke to you of in Normandy.”\r\n\r\nBertuccio bowed, and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the\r\norder he had received, he started the same evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 69. The Inquiry\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort kept the promise he had made to Madame Danglars, to\r\nendeavor to find out how the Count of Monte Cristo had discovered the\r\nhistory of the house at Auteuil. He wrote the same day for the required\r\ninformation to M. de Boville, who, from having been an inspector of\r\nprisons, was promoted to a high office in the police; and the latter\r\nbegged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely\r\nto give him full particulars. At the end of the second day M. de\r\nVillefort received the following note:\r\n\r\n“The person called the Count of Monte Cristo is an intimate\r\nacquaintance of Lord Wilmore, a rich foreigner, who is sometimes seen\r\nin Paris and who is there at this moment; he is also known to the Abbé\r\nBusoni, a Sicilian priest, of high repute in the East, where he has\r\ndone much good.”\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made\r\nrespecting these two persons; his orders were executed, and the\r\nfollowing evening he received these details:\r\n\r\n“The abbé, who was in Paris only for a month, inhabited a small\r\ntwo-storied house behind Saint-Sulpice; there were two rooms on each\r\nfloor and he was the only tenant. The two lower rooms consisted of a\r\ndining-room, with a table, chairs, and side-board of walnut, and a\r\nwainscoted parlor, without ornaments, carpet, or timepiece. It was\r\nevident that the abbé limited himself to objects of strict necessity.\r\nHe preferred to use the sitting-room upstairs, which was more library\r\nthan parlor, and was furnished with theological books and parchments,\r\nin which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time, according\r\nto his valet de chambre. His valet looked at the visitors through a\r\nsort of wicket; and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased\r\nhim, he replied that the abbé was not in Paris, an answer which\r\nsatisfied most persons, because the abbé was known to be a great\r\ntraveller. Besides, whether at home or not, whether in Paris or Cairo,\r\nthe abbé always left something to give away, which the valet\r\ndistributed through this wicket in his master’s name. The other room\r\nnear the library was a bedroom. A bed without curtains, four armchairs,\r\nand a couch, covered with yellow Utrecht velvet, composed, with a\r\n_prie-Dieu_, all its furniture.\r\n\r\n“Lord Wilmore resided in Rue Fontaine-Saint-Georges. He was one of\r\nthose English tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling. He\r\nhired the apartment in which he lived furnished, passed only a few\r\nhours in the day there, and rarely slept there. One of his\r\npeculiarities was never to speak a word of French, which he however\r\nwrote with great facility.”\r\n\r\nThe day after this important information had been given to the king’s\r\nattorney, a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the Rue\r\nFérou, and rapping at an olive-green door, asked if the Abbé Busoni\r\nwere within.\r\n\r\n“No, he went out early this morning,” replied the valet.\r\n\r\n“I might not always be content with that answer,” replied the visitor,\r\n“for I come from one to whom everyone must be at home. But have the\r\nkindness to give the Abbé Busoni——”\r\n\r\n“I told you he was not at home,” repeated the valet.\r\n\r\n“Then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper. Will he\r\nbe at home at eight o’clock this evening?”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, unless he is at work, which is the same as if he were out.”\r\n\r\n“I will come again at that time,” replied the visitor, who then\r\nretired.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage,\r\nwhich, instead of stopping this time at the end of the Rue Férou, drove\r\nup to the green door. He knocked, and it opened immediately to admit\r\nhim. From the signs of respect the valet paid him, he saw that his note\r\nhad produced a good effect.\r\n\r\n“Is the abbé at home?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“Yes; he is at work in his library, but he expects you, sir,” replied\r\nthe valet. The stranger ascended a rough staircase, and before a table,\r\nillumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while\r\nthe rest of the apartment was in partial darkness, he perceived the\r\nabbé in a monk’s dress, with a cowl on his head such as was used by\r\nlearned men of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n“Have I the honor of addressing the Abbé Busoni?” asked the visitor.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” replied the abbé; “and you are the person whom M. de\r\nBoville, formerly an inspector of prisons, sends to me from the prefect\r\nof police?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly, sir.”\r\n\r\n“One of the agents appointed to secure the safety of Paris?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir” replied the stranger with a slight hesitation, and blushing.\r\n\r\nThe abbé replaced the large spectacles, which covered not only his eyes\r\nbut his temples, and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the\r\nsame. “I am at your service, sir,” said the abbé, with a marked Italian\r\naccent.\r\n\r\n“The mission with which I am charged, sir,” replied the visitor,\r\nspeaking with hesitation, “is a confidential one on the part of him who\r\nfulfils it, and him by whom he is employed.” The abbé bowed. “Your\r\nprobity,” replied the stranger, “is so well known to the prefect that\r\nhe wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars\r\nconnected with the public safety, to ascertain which I am deputed to\r\nsee you. It is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration\r\nwill induce you to conceal the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Provided, sir, the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my\r\nscruples or my conscience. I am a priest, sir, and the secrets of\r\nconfession, for instance, must remain between me and God, and not\r\nbetween me and human justice.”\r\n\r\n“Do not alarm yourself, monsieur, we will duly respect your\r\nconscience.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so\r\nraised it on the other, throwing a bright light on the stranger’s face,\r\nwhile his own remained obscured.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, abbé,” said the envoy of the prefect of the police, “but\r\nthe light tries my eyes very much.” The abbé lowered the shade.\r\n\r\n“Now, sir, I am listening—go on.”\r\n\r\n“I will come at once to the point. Do you know the Count of Monte\r\nCristo?”\r\n\r\n“You mean Monsieur Zaccone, I presume?”\r\n\r\n“Zaccone?—is not his name Monte Cristo?”\r\n\r\n“Monte Cristo is the name of an estate, or, rather, of a rock, and not\r\na family name.”\r\n\r\n“Well, be it so—let us not dispute about words; and since M. de Monte\r\nCristo and M. Zaccone are the same——”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely the same.”\r\n\r\n“Let us speak of M. Zaccone.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed.”\r\n\r\n“I asked you if you knew him?”\r\n\r\n“Extremely well.”\r\n\r\n“Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“The son of a rich shipbuilder in Malta.”\r\n\r\n“I know that is the report; but, as you are aware, the police does not\r\ncontent itself with vague reports.”\r\n\r\n“However,” replied the abbé, with an affable smile, “when that report\r\nis in accordance with the truth, everybody must believe it, the police\r\nas well as all the rest.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure of what you assert?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by that question?”\r\n\r\n“Understand, sir, I do not in the least suspect your veracity; I ask if\r\nyou are certain of it?”\r\n\r\n“I knew his father, M. Zaccone.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed?”\r\n\r\n“And when a child I often played with the son in the timber-yards.”\r\n\r\n“But whence does he derive the title of count?”\r\n\r\n“You are aware that may be bought.”\r\n\r\n“In Italy?”\r\n\r\n“Everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“And his immense riches, whence does he procure them?”\r\n\r\n“They may not be so very great.”\r\n\r\n“How much do you suppose he possesses?”\r\n\r\n“From one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum.”\r\n\r\n“That is reasonable,” said the visitor; “I have heard he had three or\r\nfour millions.”\r\n\r\n“Two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital.”\r\n\r\n“But I was told he had four millions per annum.”\r\n\r\n“That is not probable.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know this Island of Monte Cristo?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, everyone who has come from Palermo, Naples, or Rome to\r\nFrance by sea must know it, since he has passed close to it and must\r\nhave seen it.”\r\n\r\n“I am told it is a delightful place?”\r\n\r\n“It is a rock.”\r\n\r\n“And why has the count bought a rock?”\r\n\r\n“For the sake of being a count. In Italy one must have territorial\r\npossessions to be a count.”\r\n\r\n“You have, doubtless, heard the adventures of M. Zaccone’s youth?”\r\n\r\n“The father’s?”\r\n\r\n“No, the son’s.”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing certain; at that period of his life, I lost sight of my\r\nyoung comrade.”\r\n\r\n“Was he in the wars?”\r\n\r\n“I think he entered the service.”\r\n\r\n“In what branch?”\r\n\r\n“In the navy.”\r\n\r\n“Are you not his confessor?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; I believe he is a Lutheran.”\r\n\r\n“A Lutheran?”\r\n\r\n“I say, I believe such is the case, I do not affirm it; besides,\r\nliberty of conscience is established in France.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, and we are not now inquiring into his creed, but his\r\nactions; in the name of the prefect of police, I ask you what you know\r\nof him.\r\n\r\n“He passes for a very charitable man. Our holy father, the pope, has\r\nmade him a knight of Jesus Christ for the services he rendered to the\r\nChristians in the East; he has five or six rings as testimonials from\r\nEastern monarchs of his services.”\r\n\r\n“Does he wear them?”\r\n\r\n“No, but he is proud of them; he is better pleased with rewards given\r\nto the benefactors of man than to his destroyers.”\r\n\r\n“He is a Quaker then?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly, he is a Quaker, with the exception of the peculiar dress.”\r\n\r\n“Has he any friends?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, everyone who knows him is his friend.”\r\n\r\n“But has he any enemies?”\r\n\r\n“One only.”\r\n\r\n“What is his name?”\r\n\r\n“Lord Wilmore.”\r\n\r\n“Where is he?”\r\n\r\n“He is in Paris just now.”\r\n\r\n“Can he give me any particulars?”\r\n\r\n“Important ones; he was in India with Zaccone.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know his abode?”\r\n\r\n“It’s somewhere in the Chaussée d’Antin; but I know neither the street\r\nnor the number.”\r\n\r\n30289m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Are you at variance with the Englishman?”\r\n\r\n“I love Zaccone, and he hates him; we are consequently not friends.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think the Count of Monte Cristo had ever been in France before\r\nhe made this visit to Paris?”\r\n\r\n“To that question I can answer positively; no, sir, he had not, because\r\nhe applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required, and as\r\nI did not know when I might again come to Paris, I recommended M.\r\nCavalcanti to him.”\r\n\r\n“Andrea?”\r\n\r\n“No, Bartolomeo, his father.”\r\n\r\n“Now, sir, I have but one question more to ask, and I charge you, in\r\nthe name of honor, of humanity, and of religion, to answer me\r\ncandidly.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Do you know with what design M. de Monte Cristo purchased a house at\r\nAuteuil?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, for he told me.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, sir?”\r\n\r\n“To make a lunatic asylum of it, similar to that founded by the Count\r\nof Pisani at Palermo. Do you know about that institution?”\r\n\r\n“I have heard of it.”\r\n\r\n“It is a magnificent charity.” Having said this, the abbé bowed to\r\nimply he wished to pursue his studies.\r\n\r\nThe visitor either understood the abbé’s meaning, or had no more\r\nquestions to ask; he arose, and the abbé accompanied him to the door.\r\n\r\n“You are a great almsgiver,” said the visitor, “and although you are\r\nsaid to be rich, I will venture to offer you something for your poor\r\npeople; will you accept my offering?”\r\n\r\n“I thank you, sir; I am only jealous in one thing, and that is that the\r\nrelief I give should be entirely from my own resources.”\r\n\r\n“However——”\r\n\r\n“My resolution, sir, is unchangeable, but you have only to search for\r\nyourself and you will find, alas, but too many objects upon whom to\r\nexercise your benevolence.”\r\n\r\nThe abbé once more bowed as he opened the door, the stranger bowed and\r\ntook his leave, and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of\r\nM. de Villefort. An hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered, and\r\nthis time it went to the Rue Fontaine-Saint-Georges, and stopped at No.\r\n5, where Lord Wilmore lived. The stranger had written to Lord Wilmore,\r\nrequesting an interview, which the latter had fixed for ten o’clock. As\r\nthe envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten, he\r\nwas told that Lord Wilmore, who was precision and punctuality\r\npersonified, was not yet come in, but that he would be sure to return\r\nas the clock struck.\r\n\r\nThe visitor was introduced into the drawing-room, which was like all\r\nother furnished drawing-rooms. A mantle-piece, with two modern Sèvres\r\nvases, a timepiece representing Cupid with his bent bow, a mirror with\r\nan engraving on each side—one representing Homer carrying his guide,\r\nthe other, Belisarius begging—a grayish paper; red and black\r\ntapestry—such was the appearance of Lord Wilmore’s drawing-room.\r\n\r\nIt was illuminated by lamps with ground-glass shades which gave only a\r\nfeeble light, as if out of consideration for the envoy’s weak sight.\r\nAfter ten minutes’ expectation the clock struck ten; at the fifth\r\nstroke the door opened and Lord Wilmore appeared. He was rather above\r\nthe middle height, with thin reddish whiskers, light complexion and\r\nlight hair, turning rather gray. He was dressed with all the English\r\npeculiarity, namely, in a blue coat, with gilt buttons and high collar,\r\nin the fashion of 1811, a white kerseymere waistcoat, and nankeen\r\npantaloons, three inches too short, but which were prevented by straps\r\nfrom slipping up to the knee. His first remark on entering was:\r\n\r\n“You know, sir, I do not speak French?”\r\n\r\n“I know you do not like to converse in our language,” replied the\r\nenvoy.\r\n\r\n“But you may use it,” replied Lord Wilmore; “I understand it.”\r\n\r\n“And I,” replied the visitor, changing his idiom, “know enough of\r\nEnglish to keep up the conversation. Do not put yourself to the\r\nslightest inconvenience.”\r\n\r\n“Aw?” said Lord Wilmore, with that tone which is only known to natives\r\nof Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe envoy presented his letter of introduction, which the latter read\r\nwith English coolness, and having finished:\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said he, “perfectly.”\r\n\r\n30293m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen began the questions, which were similar to those which had been\r\naddressed to the Abbé Busoni. But as Lord Wilmore, in the character of\r\nthe count’s enemy, was less restrained in his answers, they were more\r\nnumerous; he described the youth of Monte Cristo, who he said, at ten\r\nyears of age, entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of\r\nIndia who make war on the English. It was there Wilmore had first met\r\nhim and fought against him; and in that war Zaccone had been taken\r\nprisoner, sent to England, and consigned to the hulks, whence he had\r\nescaped by swimming. Then began his travels, his duels, his caprices;\r\nthen the insurrection in Greece broke out, and he had served in the\r\nGrecian ranks. While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in\r\nthe mountains of Thessaly, but he had been careful to conceal it from\r\neveryone. After the battle of Navarino, when the Greek government was\r\nconsolidated, he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district,\r\nwhich was given him. Hence that immense fortune, which, in Lord\r\nWilmore’s opinion, possibly amounted to one or two millions per\r\nannum,—a precarious fortune, which might be momentarily lost by the\r\nfailure of the mine.\r\n\r\n“But,” asked the visitor, “do you know why he came to France?”\r\n\r\n“He is speculating in railways,” said Lord Wilmore, “and as he is an\r\nexpert chemist and physicist, he has invented a new system of\r\ntelegraphy, which he is seeking to bring to perfection.”\r\n\r\n“How much does he spend yearly?” asked the prefect.\r\n\r\n“Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs,” said Lord Wilmore;\r\n“he is a miser.” Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman, who, knowing\r\nno other reproach to bring on the count, accused him of avarice.\r\n\r\n“Do you know his house at Auteuil?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“What do you know respecting it?”\r\n\r\n“Do you wish to know why he bought it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“The count is a speculator, who will certainly ruin himself in\r\nexperiments. He supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he\r\nhas bought a mineral spring equal to those at Bagnères, Luchon, and\r\nCauterets. He is going to turn his house into a _Badhaus_, as the\r\nGermans term it. He has already dug up all the garden two or three\r\ntimes to find the famous spring, and, being unsuccessful, he will soon\r\npurchase all the contiguous houses. Now, as I dislike him, and hope his\r\nrailway, his electric telegraph, or his search for baths, will ruin\r\nhim, I am watching for his discomfiture, which must soon take place.”\r\n\r\n“What was the cause of your quarrel?”\r\n\r\n“When he was in England he seduced the wife of one of my friends.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you not seek revenge?”\r\n\r\n“I have already fought three duels with him,” said the Englishman, “the\r\nfirst with the pistol, the second with the sword, and the third with\r\nthe sabre.”\r\n\r\n“And what was the result of those duels?”\r\n\r\n“The first time, he broke my arm; the second, he wounded me in the\r\nbreast; and the third time, made this large wound.” The Englishman\r\nturned down his shirt-collar, and showed a scar, whose redness proved\r\nit to be a recent one. “So that, you see, there is a deadly feud\r\nbetween us.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said the envoy, “you do not go about it in the right way to kill\r\nhim, if I understand you correctly.”\r\n\r\n“Aw?” said the Englishman, “I practice shooting every day, and every\r\nother day Grisier comes to my house.”\r\n\r\nThis was all the visitor wished to ascertain, or, rather, all the\r\nEnglishman appeared to know. The agent arose, and having bowed to Lord\r\nWilmore, who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the\r\nEnglish, he retired. Lord Wilmore, having heard the door close after\r\nhim, returned to his bedroom, where with one hand he pulled off his\r\nlight hair, his red whiskers, his false jaw, and his wound, to resume\r\nthe black hair, dark complexion, and pearly teeth of the Count of Monte\r\nCristo.\r\n\r\nIt was M. de Villefort, and not the prefect, who returned to the house\r\nof M. de Villefort. The procureur felt more at ease, although he had\r\nlearned nothing really satisfactory, and, for the first time since the\r\ndinner-party at Auteuil, he slept soundly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 70. The Ball\r\n\r\nIt was in the warmest days of July, when in due course of time the\r\nSaturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at M. de\r\nMorcerf’s. It was ten o’clock at night; the branches of the great trees\r\nin the garden of the count’s house stood out boldly against the azure\r\ncanopy of heaven, which was studded with golden stars, but where the\r\nlast fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered.\r\n\r\nFrom the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of\r\nmusic, with the whirl of the waltz and galop, while brilliant streams\r\nof light shone through the openings of the Venetian blinds. At this\r\nmoment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants, who had just\r\nreceived orders from their mistress to prepare the supper, the serenity\r\nof the weather continuing to increase. Until now, it had been undecided\r\nwhether the supper should take place in the dining-room, or under a\r\nlong tent erected on the lawn, but the beautiful blue sky, studded with\r\nstars, had settled the question in favor of the lawn.\r\n\r\nThe gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns, according to the\r\nItalian custom, and, as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the\r\ntable—the rarest of all luxuries in their complete form—are well\r\nunderstood, the supper-table was loaded with wax-lights and flowers.\r\n\r\n30297m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time the Countess of Morcerf returned to the rooms, after giving\r\nher orders, many guests were arriving, more attracted by the charming\r\nhospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the\r\ncount; for, owing to the good taste of Mercédès, one was sure of\r\nfinding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing, or even\r\ncopying in case of need.\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars, in whom the events we have related had caused deep\r\nanxiety, had hesitated about going to Madame de Morcerf’s, when during\r\nthe morning her carriage happened to meet that of Villefort. The latter\r\nmade a sign, and when the carriages had drawn close together, said:\r\n\r\n“You are going to Madame de Morcerf’s, are you not?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Madame Danglars, “I am too ill.”\r\n\r\n“You are wrong,” replied Villefort, significantly; “it is important\r\nthat you should be seen there.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?” asked the baroness.\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“In that case I will go.”\r\n\r\nAnd the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations.\r\nMadame Danglars therefore came, not only beautiful in person, but\r\nradiant with splendor; she entered by one door at the time when\r\nMercédès appeared at the door. The countess took Albert to meet Madame\r\nDanglars. He approached, paid her some well merited compliments on her\r\ntoilet, and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat. Albert looked\r\naround him.\r\n\r\n“You are looking for my daughter?” said the baroness, smiling.\r\n\r\n“I confess it,” replied Albert. “Could you have been so cruel as not to\r\nbring her?”\r\n\r\n“Calm yourself. She has met Mademoiselle de Villefort, and has taken\r\nher arm; see, they are following us, both in white dresses, one with a\r\nbouquet of camellias, the other with one of myosotis. But tell me——”\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you wish to know?”\r\n\r\n“Will not the Count of Monte Cristo be here tonight?”\r\n\r\n“Seventeen!” replied Albert.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I only mean that the count seems the rage,” replied the viscount,\r\nsmiling, “and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the\r\nsame question. The count is in fashion; I congratulate him upon it.”\r\n\r\n“And have you replied to everyone as you have to me?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, to be sure, I have not answered you; be satisfied, we shall have\r\nthis ‘lion’; we are among the privileged ones.”\r\n\r\n“Were you at the Opera yesterday?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“He was there.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed? And did the eccentric person commit any new originality?”\r\n\r\n“Can he be seen without doing so? Elssler was dancing in _Le Diable\r\nboiteux_; the Greek princess was in ecstasies. After the cachucha he\r\nplaced a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet, and threw it to the\r\ncharming danseuse, who, in the third act, to do honor to the gift,\r\nreappeared with it on her finger. And the Greek princess,—will she be\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“No, you will be deprived of that pleasure; her position in the count’s\r\nestablishment is not sufficiently understood.”\r\n\r\n“Wait; leave me here, and go and speak to Madame de Villefort, who is\r\ntrying to attract your attention.”\r\n\r\nAlbert bowed to Madame Danglars, and advanced towards Madame de\r\nVillefort, whose lips opened as he approached.\r\n\r\n“I wager anything,” said Albert, interrupting her, “that I know what\r\nyou were about to say.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what is it?”\r\n\r\n“If I guess rightly, will you confess it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“On your honor?”\r\n\r\n“On my honor.”\r\n\r\n“You were going to ask me if the Count of Monte Cristo had arrived, or\r\nwas expected.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. It is not of him that I am now thinking. I was going to\r\nask you if you had received any news of Monsieur Franz.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,—yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“What did he tell you?”\r\n\r\n“That he was leaving at the same time as his letter.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now then, the count?”\r\n\r\n“The count will come, of that you may be satisfied.”\r\n\r\n“You know that he has another name besides Monte Cristo?”\r\n\r\n“No, I did not know it.”\r\n\r\n“Monte Cristo is the name of an island, and he has a family name.”\r\n\r\n“I never heard it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I am better informed than you; his name is Zaccone.”\r\n\r\n“It is possible.”\r\n\r\n“He is a Maltese.”\r\n\r\n“That is also possible.\r\n\r\n“The son of a shipowner.”\r\n\r\n“Really, you should relate all this aloud, you would have the greatest\r\nsuccess.”\r\n\r\n“He served in India, discovered a mine in Thessaly, and comes to Paris\r\nto establish a mineral water-cure at Auteuil.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m sure,” said Morcerf, “this is indeed news! Am I allowed to\r\nrepeat it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but cautiously, tell one thing at a time, and do not say I told\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?”\r\n\r\n“Because it is a secret just discovered.”\r\n\r\n“By whom?”\r\n\r\n“The police.”\r\n\r\n“Then the news originated——”\r\n\r\n“At the prefect’s last night. Paris, you can understand, is astonished\r\nat the sight of such unusual splendor, and the police have made\r\ninquiries.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well! Nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a\r\nvagabond, on the pretext of his being too rich.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not\r\nbeen so favorable.”\r\n\r\n“Poor count! And is he aware of the danger he has been in?”\r\n\r\n“I think not.”\r\n\r\n“Then it will be but charitable to inform him. When he arrives, I will\r\nnot fail to do so.”\r\n\r\nJust then, a handsome young man, with bright eyes, black hair, and\r\nglossy moustache, respectfully bowed to Madame de Villefort. Albert\r\nextended his hand.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said Albert, “allow me to present to you M. Maximilian\r\nMorrel, captain of Spahis, one of our best, and, above all, of our\r\nbravest officers.”\r\n\r\n“I have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at Auteuil,\r\nat the house of the Count of Monte Cristo,” replied Madame de\r\nVillefort, turning away with marked coldness of manner.\r\n\r\nThis answer, and especially the tone in which it was uttered, chilled\r\nthe heart of poor Morrel. But a recompense was in store for him;\r\nturning around, he saw near the door a beautiful fair face, whose large\r\nblue eyes were, without any marked expression, fixed upon him, while\r\nthe bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips.\r\n\r\nThe salutation was so well understood that Morrel, with the same\r\nexpression in his eyes, placed his handkerchief to his mouth; and these\r\ntwo living statues, whose hearts beat so violently under their marble\r\naspect, separated from each other by the whole length of the room,\r\nforgot themselves for a moment, or rather forgot the world in their\r\nmutual contemplation. They might have remained much longer lost in one\r\nanother, without anyone noticing their abstraction. The Count of Monte\r\nCristo had just entered.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that there was something in the count which\r\nattracted universal attention wherever he appeared. It was not the\r\ncoat, unexceptional in its cut, though simple and unornamented; it was\r\nnot the plain white waistcoat; it was not the trousers, that displayed\r\nthe foot so perfectly formed—it was none of these things that attracted\r\nthe attention,—it was his pale complexion, his waving black hair, his\r\ncalm and serene expression, his dark and melancholy eye, his mouth,\r\nchiselled with such marvellous delicacy, which so easily expressed such\r\nhigh disdain,—these were what fixed the attention of all upon him.\r\n\r\nMany men might have been handsomer, but certainly there could be none\r\nwhose appearance was more _significant_, if the expression may be used.\r\nEverything about the count seemed to have its meaning, for the constant\r\nhabit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to\r\nthe expression of his face, and even to the most trifling gesture,\r\nscarcely to be understood. Yet the Parisian world is so strange, that\r\neven all this might not have won attention had there not been connected\r\nwith it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune.\r\n\r\n30301m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery\r\nof curious glances towards Madame de Morcerf, who, standing before a\r\nmantle-piece ornamented with flowers, had seen his entrance in a\r\nlooking-glass placed opposite the door, and was prepared to receive\r\nhim. She turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he\r\nwas bowing to her. No doubt she fancied the count would speak to her,\r\nwhile on his side the count thought she was about to address him; but\r\nboth remained silent, and after a mere bow, Monte Cristo directed his\r\nsteps to Albert, who received him cordially.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen my mother?” asked Albert.\r\n\r\n“I have just had the pleasure,” replied the count; “but I have not seen\r\nyour father.”\r\n\r\n“See, he is down there, talking politics with that little group of\r\ngreat geniuses.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo; “and so those gentlemen down there are men\r\nof great talent. I should not have guessed it. And for what kind of\r\ntalent are they celebrated? You know there are different sorts.”\r\n\r\n“That tall, harsh-looking man is very learned, he discovered, in the\r\nneighborhood of Rome, a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than\r\nlizards usually have, and he immediately laid his discovery before the\r\nInstitute. The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided\r\nin his favor. I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the\r\nlearned world, and the gentleman, who was only a knight of the Legion\r\nof Honor, was made an officer.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Monte Cristo, “this cross seems to me to be wisely\r\nawarded. I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they\r\nwould have made him a commander.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely,” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap\r\nhimself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republic’s, which deputed\r\nDavid12 to devise a uniform for the Academicians.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo; “so this gentleman is an Academician?”\r\n\r\n“Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.”\r\n\r\n“And what is his especial talent?”\r\n\r\n“His talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he\r\nmakes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with\r\nwhalebone.”\r\n\r\n“And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?”\r\n\r\n“No; of the French Academy.”\r\n\r\n“But what has the French Academy to do with all this?”\r\n\r\n“I was going to tell you. It seems——”\r\n\r\n“That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of\r\nscience, doubtless?”\r\n\r\n“No; that his style of writing is very good.”\r\n\r\n“This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose\r\nheads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red, and\r\nto the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?”\r\n\r\nAlbert laughed.\r\n\r\n“And the other one?” demanded the count.\r\n\r\n“That one?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the third.”\r\n\r\n“The one in the dark blue coat?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“He is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents\r\nto the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He was\r\nvery successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal\r\npapers, but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now\r\ngetting him into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an\r\nambassador.”\r\n\r\n30303m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“And what are his claims to the peerage?”\r\n\r\n“He has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five\r\narticles in the _Siècle_, and voted five or six years on the\r\nministerial side.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo, viscount,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “you are a delightful\r\n_cicerone_. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish\r\nit, you will warn me.” Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He\r\nturned round; it was Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Ah! is it you, baron?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Why do you call me baron?” said Danglars; “you know that I care\r\nnothing for my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like your title,\r\ndo you not?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied Albert, “seeing that without my title I should be\r\nnothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the\r\nmillionaire.”\r\n\r\n“Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,” replied\r\nDanglars.\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately,” said Monte Cristo, “one’s title to a millionaire does\r\nnot last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or academician;\r\nfor example, the millionaires Franck & Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have\r\njust become bankrupts.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Danglars, becoming pale.\r\n\r\n“Yes; I received the news this evening by a courier. I had about a\r\nmillion in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month\r\nago.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, _mon Dieu!_” exclaimed Danglars, “they have drawn on me for\r\n200,000 francs!”\r\n\r\n“Well, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per\r\ncent.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but it is too late,” said Danglars, “I have honored their bills.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Monte Cristo, “here are 200,000 francs gone after——”\r\n\r\n“Hush, do not mention these things,” said Danglars; then, approaching\r\nMonte Cristo, he added, “especially before young M. Cavalcanti;” after\r\nwhich he smiled, and turned towards the young man in question.\r\n\r\nAlbert had left the count to speak to his mother, Danglars to converse\r\nwith young Cavalcanti; Monte Cristo was for an instant alone. Meanwhile\r\nthe heat became excessive. The footmen were hastening through the rooms\r\nwith waiters loaded with ices. Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from\r\nhis forehead, but drew back when the waiter was presented to him; he\r\ntook no refreshment. Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte\r\nCristo; she saw that he took nothing, and even noticed his gesture of\r\nrefusal.\r\n\r\n“Albert,” she asked, “did you notice that?”\r\n\r\n“What, mother?”\r\n\r\n“That the count has never been willing to partake of food under the\r\nroof of M. de Morcerf.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but then he breakfasted with me—indeed, he made his first\r\nappearance in the world on that occasion.”\r\n\r\n“But your house is not M. de Morcerf’s,” murmured Mercédès; “and since\r\nhe has been here I have watched him.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Well, he has taken nothing yet.”\r\n\r\n“The count is very temperate.”\r\n\r\nMercédès smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n“Approach him,” said she, “and when the next waiter passes, insist upon\r\nhis taking something.”\r\n\r\n“But why, mother?”\r\n\r\n“Just to please me, Albert,” said Mercédès. Albert kissed his mother’s\r\nhand, and drew near the count. Another salver passed, loaded like the\r\npreceding ones; she saw Albert attempt to persuade the count, but he\r\nobstinately refused. Albert rejoined his mother; she was very pale.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said she, “you see he refuses?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but why need this annoy you?”\r\n\r\n“You know, Albert, women are singular creatures. I should like to have\r\nseen the count take something in my house, if only an ice. Perhaps he\r\ncannot reconcile himself to the French style of living, and might\r\nprefer something else.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; I have seen him eat of everything in Italy; no doubt he does\r\nnot feel inclined this evening.”\r\n\r\n“And besides,” said the countess, “accustomed as he is to burning\r\nclimates, possibly he does not feel the heat as we do.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think that, for he has complained of feeling almost\r\nsuffocated, and asked why the Venetian blinds were not opened as well\r\nas the windows.”\r\n\r\n“In a word,” said Mercédès, “it was a way of assuring me that his\r\nabstinence was intended.”\r\n\r\nAnd she left the room.\r\n\r\nA minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open, and through the\r\njessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the\r\ngarden ornamented with lanterns, and the supper laid under the tent.\r\nDancers, players, talkers, all uttered an exclamation of joy—everyone\r\ninhaled with delight the breeze that floated in. At the same time\r\nMercédès reappeared, paler than before, but with that imperturbable\r\nexpression of countenance which she sometimes wore. She went straight\r\nto the group of which her husband formed the centre.\r\n\r\n“Do not detain those gentlemen here, count,” she said; “they would\r\nprefer, I should think, to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate\r\nhere, since they are not playing.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said a gallant old general, who, in 1809, had sung _Partant pour\r\nla Syrie_,—“we will not go alone to the garden.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Mercédès, “I will lead the way.”\r\n\r\nTurning towards Monte Cristo, she added, “count, will you oblige me\r\nwith your arm?”\r\n\r\nThe count almost staggered at these simple words; then he fixed his\r\neyes on Mercédès. It was only a momentary glance, but it seemed to the\r\ncountess to have lasted for a century, so much was expressed in that\r\none look. He offered his arm to the countess; she took it, or rather\r\njust touched it with her little hand, and they together descended the\r\nsteps, lined with rhododendrons and camellias. Behind them, by another\r\noutlet, a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with\r\nloud exclamations of delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 71. Bread and Salt\r\n\r\nMadame de Morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion. It\r\nled through a grove of lindens to a conservatory.\r\n\r\n“It was too warm in the room, was it not, count?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame; and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors\r\nand the blinds.” As he ceased speaking, the count felt the hand of\r\nMercédès tremble. “But you,” he said, “with that light dress, and\r\nwithout anything to cover you but that gauze scarf, perhaps you feel\r\ncold?”\r\n\r\n“Do you know where I am leading you?” said the countess, without\r\nreplying to the question.\r\n\r\n“No, madame,” replied Monte Cristo; “but you see I make no resistance.”\r\n\r\n“We are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the\r\ngrove.”\r\n\r\nThe count looked at Mercédès as if to interrogate her, but she\r\ncontinued to walk on in silence, and he refrained from speaking. They\r\nreached the building, ornamented with magnificent fruits, which ripen\r\nat the beginning of July in the artificial temperature which takes the\r\nplace of the sun, so frequently absent in our climate. The countess\r\nleft the arm of Monte Cristo, and gathered a bunch of Muscatel grapes.\r\n\r\n“See, count,” she said, with a smile so sad in its expression that one\r\ncould almost detect the tears on her eyelids—“see, our French grapes\r\nare not to be compared, I know, with yours of Sicily and Cyprus, but\r\nyou will make allowance for our northern sun.” The count bowed, but\r\nstepped back.\r\n\r\n“Do you refuse?” said Mercédès, in a tremulous voice.\r\n\r\n“Pray excuse me, madame,” replied Monte Cristo, “but I never eat\r\nMuscatel grapes.”\r\n\r\nMercédès let them fall, and sighed. A magnificent peach was hanging\r\nagainst an adjoining wall, ripened by the same artificial heat.\r\nMercédès drew near, and plucked the fruit.\r\n\r\n“Take this peach, then,” she said. The count again refused. “What,\r\nagain?” she exclaimed, in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to\r\nstifle a sob; “really, you pain me.”\r\n\r\nA long silence followed; the peach, like the grapes, fell to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n“Count,” added Mercédès with a supplicating glance, “there is a\r\nbeautiful Arabian custom, which makes eternal friends of those who have\r\ntogether eaten bread and salt under the same roof.”\r\n\r\n“I know it, madame,” replied the count; “but we are in France, and not\r\nin Arabia, and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom\r\nof dividing bread and salt with one another.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said the countess, breathlessly, with her eyes fixed on Monte\r\nCristo, whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands, “we are\r\nfriends, are we not?”\r\n\r\nThe count became pale as death, the blood rushed to his heart, and then\r\nagain rising, dyed his cheeks with crimson; his eyes swam like those of\r\na man suddenly dazzled.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, we are friends,” he replied; “why should we not be?”\r\n\r\nThe answer was so little like the one Mercédès desired, that she turned\r\naway to give vent to a sigh, which sounded more like a groan. “Thank\r\nyou,” she said. And they walked on again. They went the whole length of\r\nthe garden without uttering a word.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” suddenly exclaimed the countess, after their walk had continued\r\nten minutes in silence, “is it true that you have seen so much,\r\ntravelled so far, and suffered so deeply?”\r\n\r\n“I have suffered deeply, madame,” answered Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“But now you are happy?”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless,” replied the count, “since no one hears me complain.”\r\n\r\n“And your present happiness, has it softened your heart?”\r\n\r\n“My present happiness equals my past misery,” said the count.\r\n\r\n“Are you not married?” asked the countess.\r\n\r\n“I, married?” exclaimed Monte Cristo, shuddering; “who could have told\r\nyou so?”\r\n\r\n“No one told me you were, but you have frequently been seen at the\r\nOpera with a young and lovely woman.”\r\n\r\n“She is a slave whom I bought at Constantinople, madame, the daughter\r\nof a prince. I have adopted her as my daughter, having no one else to\r\nlove in the world.”\r\n\r\n“You live alone, then?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“You have no sister—no son—no father?”\r\n\r\n“I have no one.”\r\n\r\n“How can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life?”\r\n\r\n“It is not my fault, madame. At Malta, I loved a young girl, was on the\r\npoint of marrying her, when war came and carried me away. I thought she\r\nloved me well enough to wait for me, and even to remain faithful to my\r\nmemory. When I returned she was married. This is the history of most\r\nmen who have passed twenty years of age. Perhaps my heart was weaker\r\nthan the hearts of most men, and I suffered more than they would have\r\ndone in my place; that is all.”\r\n\r\nThe countess stopped for a moment, as if gasping for breath. “Yes,” she\r\nsaid, “and you have still preserved this love in your heart—one can\r\nonly love once—and did you ever see her again?”\r\n\r\n30309m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“Never?”\r\n\r\n“I never returned to the country where she lived.”\r\n\r\n“To Malta?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; Malta.”\r\n\r\n“She is, then, now at Malta?”\r\n\r\n“I think so.”\r\n\r\n“And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?”\r\n\r\n“Her,—yes.”\r\n\r\n“But only her; do you then still hate those who separated you?”\r\n\r\n“I hate them? Not at all; why should I?” The countess placed herself\r\nbefore Monte Cristo, still holding in her hand a portion of the\r\nperfumed grapes.\r\n\r\n“Take some,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Madame, I never eat Muscatel grapes,” replied Monte Cristo, as if the\r\nsubject had not been mentioned before. The countess dashed the grapes\r\ninto the nearest thicket, with a gesture of despair.\r\n\r\n“Inflexible man!” she murmured. Monte Cristo remained as unmoved as if\r\nthe reproach had not been addressed to him.\r\n\r\nAlbert at this moment ran in. “Oh, mother,” he exclaimed, “such a\r\nmisfortune has happened!”\r\n\r\n“What? What has happened?” asked the countess, as though awakening from\r\na sleep to the realities of life; “did you say a misfortune? Indeed, I\r\nshould expect misfortunes.”\r\n\r\n“M. de Villefort is here.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“He comes to fetch his wife and daughter.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?”\r\n\r\n“Because Madame de Saint-Méran is just arrived in Paris, bringing the\r\nnews of M. de Saint-Méran’s death, which took place on the first stage\r\nafter he left Marseilles. Madame de Villefort, who was in very good\r\nspirits, would neither believe nor think of the misfortune, but\r\nMademoiselle Valentine, at the first words, guessed the whole truth,\r\nnotwithstanding all the precautions of her father; the blow struck her\r\nlike a thunderbolt, and she fell senseless.”\r\n\r\n“And how was M. de Saint-Méran related to Mademoiselle de Villefort?”\r\nsaid the count.\r\n\r\n“He was her grandfather on the mother’s side. He was coming here to\r\nhasten her marriage with Franz.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed!”\r\n\r\n“So Franz must wait. Why was not M. de Saint-Méran also grandfather to\r\nMademoiselle Danglars?”\r\n\r\n“Albert, Albert,” said Madame de Morcerf, in a tone of mild reproof,\r\n“what are you saying? Ah, count, he esteems you so highly, tell him\r\nthat he has spoken amiss.”\r\n\r\nAnd she took two or three steps forward. Monte Cristo watched her with\r\nan air so thoughtful, and so full of affectionate admiration, that she\r\nturned back and grasped his hand; at the same time she seized that of\r\nher son, and joined them together.\r\n\r\n“We are friends; are we not?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, madame, I do not presume to call myself your friend, but at all\r\ntimes I am your most respectful servant.” The countess left with an\r\nindescribable pang in her heart, and before she had taken ten steps the\r\ncount saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Do not my mother and you agree?” asked Albert, astonished.\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” replied the count, “did you not hear her declare\r\nthat we were friends?”\r\n\r\nThey re-entered the drawing-room, which Valentine and Madame de\r\nVillefort had just quitted. It is perhaps needless to add that Morrel\r\ndeparted almost at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 72. Madame de Saint-Méran\r\n\r\nA gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of M. de Villefort.\r\nAfter the ladies had departed for the ball, whither all the entreaties\r\nof Madame de Villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them,\r\nthe procureur had shut himself up in his study, according to his\r\ncustom, with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else, but\r\nwhich generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires.\r\n\r\nBut this time the papers were a mere matter of form. Villefort had\r\nsecluded himself, not to study, but to reflect; and with the door\r\nlocked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for\r\nimportant business, he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder\r\nover the events, the remembrance of which had during the last eight\r\ndays filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter\r\nrecollections.\r\n\r\nThen, instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him,\r\nhe opened the drawer of his desk, touched a spring, and drew out a\r\nparcel of cherished memoranda, amongst which he had carefully arranged,\r\nin characters only known to himself, the names of all those who, either\r\nin his political career, in money matters, at the bar, or in his\r\nmysterious love affairs, had become his enemies.\r\n\r\nTheir number was formidable, now that he had begun to fear, and yet\r\nthese names, powerful though they were, had often caused him to smile\r\nwith the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from\r\nthe summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences, the\r\nalmost impassable paths, and the fearful chasms, through which he has\r\nso perilously climbed. When he had run over all these names in his\r\nmemory, again read and studied them, commenting meanwhile upon his\r\nlists, he shook his head.\r\n\r\n“No,” he murmured, “none of my enemies would have waited so patiently\r\nand laboriously for so long a space of time, that they might now come\r\nand crush me with this secret. Sometimes, as Hamlet says:\r\n\r\n‘Foul deeds will rise,\r\n\r\nThough all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes;’\r\n\r\n\r\nbut, like a phosphoric light, they rise but to mislead. The story has\r\nbeen told by the Corsican to some priest, who in his turn has repeated\r\nit. M. de Monte Cristo may have heard it, and to enlighten himself——\r\n\r\n“But why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject?” asked\r\nVillefort, after a moment’s reflection, “what interest can this M. de\r\nMonte Cristo or M. Zaccone,—son of a shipowner of Malta, discoverer of\r\na mine in Thessaly, now visiting Paris for the first time,—what\r\ninterest, I say, can he take in discovering a gloomy, mysterious, and\r\nuseless fact like this? However, among all the incoherent details given\r\nto me by the Abbé Busoni and by Lord Wilmore, by that friend and that\r\nenemy, one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion—that in no\r\nperiod, in no case, in no circumstance, could there have been any\r\ncontact between him and me.”\r\n\r\nBut Villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe. He\r\ndreaded not so much the revelation, for he could reply to or deny its\r\ntruth;—he cared little for that _mene, mene, tekel upharsin_, which\r\nappeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall;—but what he was\r\nreally anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them. While he\r\nwas endeavoring to calm his fears,—and instead of dwelling upon the\r\npolitical future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious\r\ndreams, was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home, in\r\nfear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept,—the noise of a\r\ncarriage sounded in the yard, then he heard the steps of an aged person\r\nascending the stairs, followed by tears and lamentations, such as\r\nservants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in\r\ntheir master’s grief.\r\n\r\nHe drew back the bolt of his door, and almost directly an old lady\r\nentered, unannounced, carrying her shawl on her arm, and her bonnet in\r\nher hand. The white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead, and\r\nher eyes, already sunken by the furrows of age, now almost disappeared\r\nbeneath the eyelids swollen with grief.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir,” she said; “oh, sir, what a misfortune! I shall die of it;\r\noh, yes, I shall certainly die of it!”\r\n\r\nAnd then, falling upon the chair nearest the door, she burst into a\r\nparoxysm of sobs. The servants, standing in the doorway, not daring to\r\napproach nearer, were looking at Noirtier’s old servant, who had heard\r\nthe noise from his master’s room, and run there also, remaining behind\r\nthe others. Villefort rose, and ran towards his mother-in-law, for it\r\nwas she.\r\n\r\n“Why, what can have happened?” he exclaimed, “what has thus disturbed\r\nyou? Is M. de Saint-Méran with you?”\r\n\r\n“M. de Saint-Méran is dead,” answered the old marchioness, without\r\npreface and without expression; she appeared to be stupefied. Villefort\r\ndrew back, and clasping his hands together, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Dead!—so suddenly?”\r\n\r\n“A week ago,” continued Madame de Saint-Méran, “we went out together in\r\nthe carriage after dinner. M. de Saint-Méran had been unwell for some\r\ndays; still, the idea of seeing our dear Valentine again inspired him\r\nwith courage, and notwithstanding his illness he would leave. At six\r\nleagues from Marseilles, after having eaten some of the lozenges he is\r\naccustomed to take, he fell into such a deep sleep, that it appeared to\r\nme unnatural; still I hesitated to wake him, although I fancied that\r\nhis face was flushed, and that the veins of his temples throbbed more\r\nviolently than usual. However, as it became dark, and I could no longer\r\nsee, I fell asleep; I was soon aroused by a piercing shriek, as from a\r\nperson suffering in his dreams, and he suddenly threw his head back\r\nviolently. I called the valet, I stopped the postilion, I spoke to M.\r\nde Saint-Méran, I applied my smelling-salts; but all was over, and I\r\narrived at Aix by the side of a corpse.”\r\n\r\nVillefort stood with his mouth half open, quite stupefied.\r\n\r\n“Of course you sent for a doctor?”\r\n\r\n“Immediately; but, as I have told you, it was too late.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had\r\ndied.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, sir, he told me; it appears to have been an apoplectic\r\nstroke.”\r\n\r\n“And what did you do then?”\r\n\r\n“M. de Saint-Méran had always expressed a desire, in case his death\r\nhappened during his absence from Paris, that his body might be brought\r\nto the family vault. I had him put into a leaden coffin, and I am\r\npreceding him by a few days.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! my poor mother!” said Villefort, “to have such duties to perform\r\nat your age after such a blow!”\r\n\r\n“God has supported me through all; and then, my dear marquis, he would\r\ncertainly have done everything for me that I performed for him. It is\r\ntrue that since I left him, I seem to have lost my senses. I cannot\r\ncry; at my age they say that we have no more tears,—still I think that\r\nwhen one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping. Where is\r\nValentine, sir? It is on her account I am here; I wish to see\r\nValentine.”\r\n\r\n30315m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVillefort thought it would be terrible to reply that Valentine was at a\r\nball; so he only said that she had gone out with her step-mother, and\r\nthat she should be fetched. “This instant, sir—this instant, I beseech\r\nyou!” said the old lady. Villefort placed the arm of Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran within his own, and conducted her to his apartment.\r\n\r\n“Rest yourself, mother,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe marchioness raised her head at this word, and beholding the man who\r\nso forcibly reminded her of her deeply-regretted child, who still lived\r\nfor her in Valentine, she felt touched at the name of mother, and\r\nbursting into tears, she fell on her knees before an armchair, where\r\nshe buried her venerable head. Villefort left her to the care of the\r\nwomen, while old Barrois ran, half-scared, to his master; for nothing\r\nfrightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over\r\nthem for a moment in order to strike some other old person. Then, while\r\nMadame de Saint-Méran remained on her knees, praying fervently,\r\nVillefort sent for a cab, and went himself to fetch his wife and\r\ndaughter from Madame de Morcerf’s. He was so pale when he appeared at\r\nthe door of the ball-room, that Valentine ran to him, saying:\r\n\r\n“Oh, father, some misfortune has happened!”\r\n\r\n“Your grandmamma has just arrived, Valentine,” said M. de Villefort.\r\n\r\n“And grandpapa?” inquired the young girl, trembling with apprehension.\r\nM. de Villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter. It\r\nwas just in time, for Valentine’s head swam, and she staggered; Madame\r\nde Villefort instantly hastened to her assistance, and aided her\r\nhusband in dragging her to the carriage, saying:\r\n\r\n“What a singular event! Who could have thought it? Ah, yes, it is\r\nindeed strange!”\r\n\r\nAnd the wretched family departed, leaving a cloud of sadness hanging\r\nover the rest of the evening. At the foot of the stairs, Valentine\r\nfound Barrois awaiting her.\r\n\r\n“M. Noirtier wishes to see you tonight, he said, in an undertone.\r\n\r\n“Tell him I will come when I leave my dear grandmamma,” she replied,\r\nfeeling, with true delicacy, that the person to whom she could be of\r\nthe most service just then was Madame de Saint-Méran.\r\n\r\nValentine found her grandmother in bed; silent caresses, heartwrung\r\nsobs, broken sighs, burning tears, were all that passed in this sad\r\ninterview, while Madame de Villefort, leaning on her husband’s arm,\r\nmaintained all outward forms of respect, at least towards the poor\r\nwidow. She soon whispered to her husband:\r\n\r\n“I think it would be better for me to retire, with your permission, for\r\nthe sight of me appears still to afflict your mother-in-law.” Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran heard her.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” she said softly to Valentine, “let her leave; but do you\r\nstay.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort left, and Valentine remained alone beside the bed,\r\nfor the procureur, overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death,\r\nhad followed his wife. Meanwhile, Barrois had returned for the first\r\ntime to old Noirtier, who having heard the noise in the house, had, as\r\nwe have said, sent his old servant to inquire the cause; on his return,\r\nhis quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger.\r\n\r\n“Alas, sir,” exclaimed Barrois, “a great misfortune has happened.\r\nMadame de Saint-Méran has arrived, and her husband is dead!”\r\n\r\nM. de Saint-Méran and Noirtier had never been on strict terms of\r\nfriendship; still, the death of one old man always considerably affects\r\nanother. Noirtier let his head fall upon his chest, apparently\r\noverwhelmed and thoughtful; then he closed one eye, in token of\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nBarrois asked, “Mademoiselle Valentine?”\r\n\r\nNoirtier nodded his head.\r\n\r\n“She is at the ball, as you know, since she came to say good-bye to you\r\nin full dress.” Noirtier again closed his left eye.\r\n\r\n“Do you wish to see her?” Noirtier again made an affirmative sign.\r\n\r\n“Well, they have gone to fetch her, no doubt, from Madame de Morcerf’s;\r\nI will await her return, and beg her to come up here. Is that what you\r\nwish for?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the invalid.\r\n\r\nBarrois, therefore, as we have seen, watched for Valentine, and\r\ninformed her of her grandfather’s wish. Consequently, Valentine came up\r\nto Noirtier, on leaving Madame de Saint-Méran, who in the midst of her\r\ngrief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep.\r\nWithin reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a\r\nbottle of orangeade, her usual beverage, and a glass. Then, as we have\r\nsaid, the young girl left the bedside to see M. Noirtier.\r\n\r\nValentine kissed the old man, who looked at her with such tenderness\r\nthat her eyes again filled with tears, whose sources he thought must be\r\nexhausted. The old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” said Valentine, “you mean that I have yet a kind\r\ngrandfather left, do you not.” The old man intimated that such was his\r\nmeaning. “Ah, yes, happily I have,” replied Valentine. “Without that,\r\nwhat would become of me?”\r\n\r\nIt was one o’clock in the morning. Barrois, who wished to go to bed\r\nhimself, observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of\r\nrest. Noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see\r\nhis child, but wished her good-night, for grief and fatigue had made\r\nher appear quite ill.\r\n\r\nThe next morning she found her grandmother in bed; the fever had not\r\nabated, on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be\r\nsuffering from violent nervous irritability.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear grandmamma, are you worse?” exclaimed Valentine, perceiving\r\nall these signs of agitation.\r\n\r\n“No, my child, no,” said Madame de Saint-Méran; “but I was impatiently\r\nwaiting for your arrival, that I might send for your father.”\r\n\r\n“My father?” inquired Valentine, uneasily.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I wish to speak to him.”\r\n\r\nValentine durst not oppose her grandmother’s wish, the cause of which\r\nshe did not know, and an instant afterwards Villefort entered.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Madame de Saint-Méran, without using any circumlocution,\r\nand as if fearing she had no time to lose, “you wrote to me concerning\r\nthe marriage of this child?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame,” replied Villefort, “it is not only projected but\r\narranged.”\r\n\r\n“Your intended son-in-law is named M. Franz d’Épinay?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame.”\r\n\r\n“Is he not the son of General d’Épinay who was on our side, and who was\r\nassassinated some days before the usurper returned from the Island of\r\nElba?”\r\n\r\n“The same.”\r\n\r\n“Does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a\r\nJacobin?”\r\n\r\n“Our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished, mother,” said\r\nVillefort; “M. d’Épinay was quite a child when his father died, he\r\nknows very little of M. Noirtier, and will meet him, if not with\r\npleasure, at least with indifference.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a suitable match?”\r\n\r\n“In every respect.”\r\n\r\n“And the young man?”\r\n\r\n“Is regarded with universal esteem.”\r\n\r\n“You approve of him?”\r\n\r\n“He is one of the most well-bred young men I know.”\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this conversation Valentine had remained silent.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” said Madame de Saint-Méran, after a few minutes’\r\nreflection, “I must hasten the marriage, for I have but a short time to\r\nlive.”\r\n\r\n“You, madame?” “You, dear mamma?” exclaimed M. de Villefort and\r\nValentine at the same time.\r\n\r\n“I know what I am saying,” continued the marchioness; “I must hurry\r\nyou, so that, as she has no mother, she may at least have a grandmother\r\nto bless her marriage. I am all that is left to her belonging to my\r\npoor Renée, whom you have so soon forgotten, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, madame,” said Villefort, “you forget that I was obliged to give a\r\nmother to my child.”\r\n\r\n“A stepmother is never a mother, sir. But this is not to the\r\npurpose,—our business concerns Valentine, let us leave the dead in\r\npeace.”\r\n\r\nAll this was said with such exceeding rapidity, that there was\r\nsomething in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of\r\ndelirium.\r\n\r\n“It shall be as you wish, madame,” said Villefort; “more especially\r\nsince your wishes coincide with mine, and as soon as M. d’Épinay\r\narrives in Paris——”\r\n\r\n30319m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“My dear grandmother,” interrupted Valentine, “consider decorum—the\r\nrecent death. You would not have me marry under such sad auspices?”\r\n\r\n“My child,” exclaimed the old lady sharply, “let us hear none of the\r\nconventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the\r\nfuture. I also was married at the death-bed of my mother, and certainly\r\nI have not been less happy on that account.”\r\n\r\n“Still that idea of death, madame,” said Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Still?—Always! I tell you I am going to die—do you understand? Well,\r\nbefore dying, I wish to see my son-in-law. I wish to tell him to make\r\nmy child happy; I wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey\r\nme;—in fact, I will know him—I will!” continued the old lady, with a\r\nfearful expression, “that I may rise from the depths of my grave to\r\nfind him, if he should not fulfil his duty!”\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said Villefort, “you must lay aside these exalted ideas,\r\nwhich almost assume the appearance of madness. The dead, once buried in\r\ntheir graves, rise no more.”\r\n\r\n“And I tell you, sir, that you are mistaken. This night I have had a\r\nfearful sleep. It seemed as though my soul were already hovering over\r\nmy body, my eyes, which I tried to open, closed against my will, and\r\nwhat will appear impossible above all to you, sir, I saw, with my eyes\r\nshut, in the spot where you are now standing, issuing from that corner\r\nwhere there is a door leading into Madame Villefort’s dressing-room—I\r\nsaw, I tell you, silently enter, a white figure.”\r\n\r\nValentine screamed.\r\n\r\n“It was the fever that disturbed you, madame,” said Villefort.\r\n\r\n30321m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Doubt, if you please, but I am sure of what I say. I saw a white\r\nfigure, and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one\r\nof my senses, I heard my glass removed—the same which is there now on\r\nthe table.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear mother, it was a dream.”\r\n\r\n“So little was it a dream, that I stretched my hand towards the bell;\r\nbut when I did so, the shade disappeared; my maid then entered with a\r\nlight.”\r\n\r\n“But she saw no one?”\r\n\r\n“Phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them. It was the\r\nsoul of my husband!—Well, if my husband’s soul can come to me, why\r\nshould not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter? the tie is even\r\nmore direct, it seems to me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, madame,” said Villefort, deeply affected, in spite of himself, “do\r\nnot yield to those gloomy thoughts; you will long live with us, happy,\r\nloved, and honored, and we will make you forget——”\r\n\r\n“Never, never, never,” said the marchioness. “When does M. d’Épinay\r\nreturn?”\r\n\r\n“We expect him every moment.”\r\n\r\n“It is well. As soon as he arrives inform me. We must be expeditious.\r\nAnd then I also wish to see a notary, that I may be assured that all\r\nour property returns to Valentine.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, grandmamma,” murmured Valentine, pressing her lips on the burning\r\nbrow, “do you wish to kill me? Oh, how feverish you are; we must not\r\nsend for a notary, but for a doctor!”\r\n\r\n“A doctor?” said she, shrugging her shoulders, “I am not ill; I am\r\nthirsty—that is all.”\r\n\r\n30323m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What are you drinking, dear grandmamma?”\r\n\r\n“The same as usual, my dear, my glass is there on the table—give it to\r\nme, Valentine.” Valentine poured the orangeade into a glass and gave it\r\nto her grandmother with a certain degree of dread, for it was the same\r\nglass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre.\r\n\r\nThe marchioness drained the glass at a single draught, and then turned\r\non her pillow, repeating,\r\n\r\n“The notary, the notary!”\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort left the room, and Valentine seated herself at the\r\nbedside of her grandmother. The poor child appeared herself to require\r\nthe doctor she had recommended to her aged relative. A bright spot\r\nburned in either cheek, her respiration was short and difficult, and\r\nher pulse beat with feverish excitement. She was thinking of the\r\ndespair of Maximilian, when he should be informed that Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran, instead of being an ally, was unconsciously acting as his\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nMore than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother, and she\r\nwould not have hesitated a moment, if Maximilian Morrel had been named\r\nAlbert de Morcerf or Raoul de Château-Renaud; but Morrel was of\r\nplebeian extraction, and Valentine knew how the haughty Marquise de\r\nSaint-Méran despised all who were not noble. Her secret had each time\r\nbeen repressed when she was about to reveal it, by the sad conviction\r\nthat it would be useless to do so; for, were it once discovered by her\r\nfather and mother, all would be lost.\r\n\r\nTwo hours passed thus; Madame de Saint-Méran was in a feverish sleep,\r\nand the notary had arrived. Though his coming was announced in a very\r\nlow tone, Madame de Saint-Méran arose from her pillow.\r\n\r\n“The notary!” she exclaimed, “let him come in.”\r\n\r\nThe notary, who was at the door, immediately entered. “Go, Valentine,”\r\nsaid Madame de Saint-Méran, “and leave me with this gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“But, grandmamma——”\r\n\r\n“Leave me—go!”\r\n\r\nThe young girl kissed her grandmother, and left with her handkerchief\r\nto her eyes; at the door she found the valet de chambre, who told her\r\nthat the doctor was waiting in the dining-room. Valentine instantly ran\r\ndown. The doctor was a friend of the family, and at the same time one\r\nof the cleverest men of the day, and very fond of Valentine, whose\r\nbirth he had witnessed. He had himself a daughter about her age, but\r\nwhose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her\r\nmother having been consumptive.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Valentine, “we have been waiting for you with such\r\nimpatience, dear M. d’Avrigny. But, first of all, how are Madeleine and\r\nAntoinette?”\r\n\r\nMadeleine was the daughter of M. d’Avrigny, and Antoinette his niece.\r\nM. d’Avrigny smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n“Antoinette is very well,” he said, “and Madeleine tolerably so. But\r\nyou sent for me, my dear child. It is not your father or Madame de\r\nVillefort who is ill. As for you, although we doctors cannot divest our\r\npatients of nerves, I fancy you have no further need of me than to\r\nrecommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field.”\r\n\r\nValentine colored. M. d’Avrigny carried the science of divination\r\nalmost to a miraculous extent, for he was one of the physicians who\r\nalways work upon the body through the mind.\r\n\r\n30325m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No,” she replied, “it is for my poor grandmother. You know the\r\ncalamity that has happened to us, do you not?”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing.” said M. d’Avrigny.\r\n\r\n“Alas,” said Valentine, restraining her tears, “my grandfather is\r\ndead.”\r\n\r\n“M. de Saint-Méran?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Suddenly?”\r\n\r\n“From an apoplectic stroke.”\r\n\r\n“An apoplectic stroke?” repeated the doctor.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband, whom she never\r\nleft, has called her, and that she must go and join him. Oh, M.\r\nd’Avrigny, I beseech you, do something for her!”\r\n\r\n“Where is she?”\r\n\r\n“In her room with the notary.”\r\n\r\n“And M. Noirtier?”\r\n\r\n“Just as he was, his mind perfectly clear, but the same incapability of\r\nmoving or speaking.”\r\n\r\n“And the same love for you—eh, my dear child?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Valentine, “he was very fond of me.”\r\n\r\n“Who does not love you?” Valentine smiled sadly. “What are your\r\ngrandmother’s symptoms?”\r\n\r\n“An extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep; she\r\nfancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her\r\nbody, which she at the same time watched. It must have been delirium;\r\nshe fancies, too, that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even\r\nheard the noise it made on touching her glass.”\r\n\r\n“It is singular,” said the doctor; “I was not aware that Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran was subject to such hallucinations.”\r\n\r\n“It is the first time I ever saw her in this condition,” said\r\nValentine; “and this morning she frightened me so that I thought her\r\nmad; and my father, who you know is a strong-minded man, himself\r\nappeared deeply impressed.”\r\n\r\n“We will go and see,” said the doctor; “what you tell me seems very\r\nstrange.” The notary here descended, and Valentine was informed that\r\nher grandmother was alone.\r\n\r\n“Go upstairs,” she said to the doctor.\r\n\r\n“And you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I dare not—she forbade my sending for you; and, as you say, I am\r\nmyself agitated, feverish and out of sorts. I will go and take a turn\r\nin the garden to recover myself.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor pressed Valentine’s hand, and while he visited her\r\ngrandmother, she descended the steps. We need not say which portion of\r\nthe garden was her favorite walk. After remaining for a short time in\r\nthe parterre surrounding the house, and gathering a rose to place in\r\nher waist or hair, she turned into the dark avenue which led to the\r\nbench; then from the bench she went to the gate. As usual, Valentine\r\nstrolled for a short time among her flowers, but without gathering\r\nthem. The mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple\r\nornament, though she had not yet had time to put on the outward\r\nsemblance of woe.\r\n\r\n30327m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe then turned towards the avenue. As she advanced she fancied she\r\nheard a voice speaking her name. She stopped astonished, then the voice\r\nreached her ear more distinctly, and she recognized it to be that of\r\nMaximilian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 73. The Promise\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Maximilian Morrel, who had passed a wretched existence\r\nsince the previous day. With the instinct peculiar to lovers he had\r\nanticipated after the return of Madame de Saint-Méran and the death of\r\nthe marquis, that something would occur at M. de Villefort’s in\r\nconnection with his attachment for Valentine. His presentiments were\r\nrealized, as we shall see, and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him\r\npale and trembling to the gate under the chestnut-trees.\r\n\r\nValentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety, and as\r\nit was not his accustomed hour for visiting her, she had gone to the\r\nspot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy. Morrel called her,\r\nand she ran to the gate.\r\n\r\n“You here at this hour?” said she.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my poor girl,” replied Morrel; “I come to bring and to hear bad\r\ntidings.”\r\n\r\n“This is, indeed, a house of mourning,” said Valentine; “speak,\r\nMaximilian, although the cup of sorrow seems already full.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Valentine,” said Morrel, endeavoring to conceal his own emotion,\r\n“listen, I entreat you; what I am about to say is very serious. When\r\nare you to be married?”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you all,” said Valentine; “from you I have nothing to\r\nconceal. This morning the subject was introduced, and my dear\r\ngrandmother, on whom I depended as my only support, not only declared\r\nherself favorable to it, but is so anxious for it, that they only await\r\nthe arrival of M. d’Épinay, and the following day the contract will be\r\nsigned.”\r\n\r\nA deep sigh escaped the young man, who gazed long and mournfully at her\r\nhe loved.\r\n\r\n“Alas,” replied he, “it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from\r\nyour own lips. The sentence is passed, and, in a few hours, will be\r\nexecuted; it must be so, and I will not endeavor to prevent it. But,\r\nsince you say nothing remains but for M. d’Épinay to arrive that the\r\ncontract may be signed, and the following day you will be his, tomorrow\r\nyou will be engaged to M. d’Épinay, for he came this morning to Paris.”\r\nValentine uttered a cry.\r\n\r\n“I was at the house of Monte Cristo an hour since,” said Morrel; “we\r\nwere speaking, he of the sorrow your family had experienced, and I of\r\nyour grief, when a carriage rolled into the courtyard. Never, till\r\nthen, had I placed any confidence in presentiments, but now I cannot\r\nhelp believing them, Valentine. At the sound of that carriage I\r\nshuddered; soon I heard steps on the staircase, which terrified me as\r\nmuch as the footsteps of the commander did Don Juan. The door at last\r\nopened; Albert de Morcerf entered first, and I began to hope my fears\r\nwere vain, when, after him, another young man advanced, and the count\r\nexclaimed: ‘Ah, here is the Baron Franz d’Épinay!’ I summoned all my\r\nstrength and courage to my support. Perhaps I turned pale and trembled,\r\nbut certainly I smiled; and five minutes after I left, without having\r\nheard one word that had passed.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Maximilian!” murmured Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Valentine, the time has arrived when you must answer me. And remember\r\nmy life depends on your answer. What do you intend doing?” Valentine\r\nheld down her head; she was overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said Morrel; “it is not the first time you have contemplated\r\nour present position, which is a serious and urgent one; I do not think\r\nit is a moment to give way to useless sorrow; leave that for those who\r\nlike to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret.\r\nThere are such in the world, and God will doubtless reward them in\r\nheaven for their resignation on earth, but those who mean to contend\r\nmust not lose one precious moment, but must return immediately the blow\r\nwhich fortune strikes. Do you intend to struggle against our\r\nill-fortune? Tell me, Valentine for it is that I came to know.”\r\n\r\nValentine trembled, and looked at him with amazement. The idea of\r\nresisting her father, her grandmother, and all the family, had never\r\noccurred to her.\r\n\r\n“What do you say, Maximilian?” asked Valentine. “What do you mean by a\r\nstruggle? Oh, it would be a sacrilege. What? I resist my father’s\r\norder, and my dying grandmother’s wish? Impossible!”\r\n\r\nMorrel started.\r\n\r\n“You are too noble not to understand me, and you understand me so well\r\nthat you already yield, dear Maximilian. No, no; I shall need all my\r\nstrength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret, as you\r\nsay. But to grieve my father—to disturb my grandmother’s last\r\nmoments—never!”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said Morrel, calmly.\r\n\r\n“In what a tone you speak!” cried Valentine.\r\n\r\n“I speak as one who admires you, mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” cried Valentine; “mademoiselle! Oh, selfish man! he\r\nsees me in despair, and pretends he cannot understand me!”\r\n\r\n“You mistake—I understand you perfectly. You will not oppose M.\r\nVillefort, you will not displease the marchioness, and tomorrow you\r\nwill sign the contract which will bind you to your husband.”\r\n\r\n“But, _mon Dieu!_ tell me, how can I do otherwise?”\r\n\r\n“Do not appeal to me, mademoiselle; I shall be a bad judge in such a\r\ncase; my selfishness will blind me,” replied Morrel, whose low voice\r\nand clenched hands announced his growing desperation.\r\n\r\n“What would you have proposed, Maximilian, had you found me willing to\r\naccede?”\r\n\r\n“It is not for me to say.”\r\n\r\n“You are wrong; you must advise me what to do.”\r\n\r\n“Do you seriously ask my advice, Valentine?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, dear Maximilian, for if it is good, I will follow it; you\r\nknow my devotion to you.”\r\n\r\n“Valentine,” said Morrel pushing aside a loose plank, “give me your\r\nhand in token of forgiveness of my anger; my senses are confused, and\r\nduring the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through\r\nmy brain. Oh, if you refuse my advice——”\r\n\r\n“What do you advise?” said Valentine, raising her eyes to heaven and\r\nsighing.\r\n\r\n“I am free,” replied Maximilian, “and rich enough to support you. I\r\nswear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have\r\napproached your forehead.”\r\n\r\n“You make me tremble!” said the young girl.\r\n\r\n“Follow me,” said Morrel; “I will take you to my sister, who is worthy\r\nalso to be yours. We will embark for Algiers, for England, for America,\r\nor, if you prefer it, retire to the country and only return to Paris\r\nwhen our friends have reconciled your family.”\r\n\r\nValentine shook her head.\r\n\r\n“I feared it, Maximilian,” said she; “it is the counsel of a madman,\r\nand I should be more mad than you, did I not stop you at once with the\r\nword ‘Impossible, Morrel, impossible!’”\r\n\r\n“You will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even\r\nattempting to contend with it?” said Morrel sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n“Yes,—if I die!”\r\n\r\n“Well, Valentine,” resumed Maximilian, “I can only say again that you\r\nare right. Truly, it is I who am mad, and you prove to me that passion\r\nblinds the most well-meaning. I appreciate your calm reasoning. It is\r\nthen understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to M.\r\nFranz d’Épinay, not only by that theatrical formality invented to\r\nheighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract,\r\nbut your own will?”\r\n\r\n“Again you drive me to despair, Maximilian,” said Valentine, “again you\r\nplunge the dagger into the wound! What would you do, tell me, if your\r\nsister listened to such a proposition?”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” replied Morrel with a bitter smile, “I am selfish—you\r\nhave already said so—and as a selfish man I think not of what others\r\nwould do in my situation, but of what I intend doing myself. I think\r\nonly that I have known you not a whole year. From the day I first saw\r\nyou, all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection.\r\nOne day you acknowledged that you loved me, and since that day my hope\r\nof future happiness has rested on obtaining you, for to gain you would\r\nbe life to me. Now, I think no more; I say only that fortune has turned\r\nagainst me—I had thought to gain heaven, and now I have lost it. It is\r\nan every-day occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he\r\npossesses but also what he has not.”\r\n\r\nMorrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness; Valentine looked\r\nat him a moment with her large, scrutinizing eyes, endeavoring not to\r\nlet Morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart.\r\n\r\n“But, in a word, what are you going to do?” asked she.\r\n\r\n“I am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you, mademoiselle,\r\nsolemnly assuring you that I wish your life may be so calm, so happy,\r\nand so fully occupied, that there may be no place for me even in your\r\nmemory.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” murmured Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Adieu, Valentine, adieu!” said Morrel, bowing.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?” cried the young girl, extending her hand through\r\nthe opening, and seizing Maximilian by his coat, for she understood\r\nfrom her own agitated feelings that her lover’s calmness could not be\r\nreal; “where are you going?”\r\n\r\n“I am going, that I may not bring fresh trouble into your family: and\r\nto set an example which every honest and devoted man, situated as I am,\r\nmay follow.”\r\n\r\n“Before you leave me, tell me what you are going to do, Maximilian.”\r\nThe young man smiled sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n“Speak, speak!” said Valentine; “I entreat you.”\r\n\r\n“Has your resolution changed, Valentine?”\r\n\r\n“It cannot change, unhappy man; you know it must not!” cried the young\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n“Then adieu, Valentine!”\r\n\r\nValentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have\r\nbeen supposed to be possessed, as Morrel was going away, and passing\r\nboth her hands through the opening, she clasped and wrung them. “I must\r\nknow what you mean to do!” said she. “Where are you going?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, fear not,” said Maximilian, stopping at a short distance, “I do\r\nnot intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate\r\nreserved for me. Another might threaten to seek M. Franz, to provoke\r\nhim, and to fight with him; all that would be folly. What has M. Franz\r\nto do with it? He saw me this morning for the first time, and has\r\nalready forgotten he has seen me. He did not even know I existed when\r\nit was arranged by your two families that you should be united. I have\r\nno enmity against M. Franz, and promise you the punishment shall not\r\nfall on him.”\r\n\r\n“On whom, then!—on me?”\r\n\r\n“On you? Valentine! Oh, Heaven forbid! Woman is sacred; the woman one\r\nloves is holy.”\r\n\r\n“On yourself, then, unhappy man; on yourself?”\r\n\r\n“I am the only guilty person, am I not?” said Maximilian.\r\n\r\n“Maximilian!” said Valentine, “Maximilian, come back, I entreat you!”\r\n\r\nHe drew near with his sweet smile, and but for his paleness one might\r\nhave thought him in his usual happy mood.\r\n\r\n“Listen, my dear, my adored Valentine,” said he in his melodious and\r\ngrave tone; “those who, like us, have never had a thought for which we\r\nneed blush before the world, such may read each other’s hearts. I never\r\nwas romantic, and am no melancholy hero. I imitate neither Manfred nor\r\nAnthony; but without words, protestations, or vows, my life has\r\nentwined itself with yours; you leave me, and you are right in doing\r\nso,—I repeat it, you are right; but in losing you, I lose my life. The\r\nmoment you leave me, Valentine, I am alone in the world. My sister is\r\nhappily married; her husband is only my brother-in-law, that is, a man\r\nwhom the ties of social life alone attach to me; no one then longer\r\nneeds my useless life. This is what I shall do; I will wait until the\r\nvery moment you are married, for I will not lose the shadow of one of\r\nthose unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us, since M.\r\nFranz may, after all, die before that time, a thunderbolt may fall even\r\non the altar as you approach it,—nothing appears impossible to one\r\ncondemned to die, and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape\r\nfrom death is concerned. I will, then, wait until the last moment, and\r\nwhen my misery is certain, irremediable, hopeless, I will write a\r\nconfidential letter to my brother-in-law, another to the prefect of\r\npolice, to acquaint them with my intention, and at the corner of some\r\nwood, on the brink of some abyss, on the bank of some river, I will put\r\nan end to my existence, as certainly as I am the son of the most honest\r\nman who ever lived in France.”\r\n\r\n30333m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nValentine trembled convulsively; she loosened her hold of the gate, her\r\narms fell by her side, and two large tears rolled down her cheeks. The\r\nyoung man stood before her, sorrowful and resolute.\r\n\r\n“Oh, for pity’s sake,” said she, “you will live, will you not?”\r\n\r\n“No, on my honor,” said Maximilian; “but that will not affect you. You\r\nhave done your duty, and your conscience will be at rest.”\r\n\r\nValentine fell on her knees, and pressed her almost bursting heart.\r\n“Maximilian,” said she, “Maximilian, my friend, my brother on earth, my\r\ntrue husband in heaven, I entreat you, do as I do, live in suffering;\r\nperhaps we may one day be united.”\r\n\r\n“Adieu, Valentine,” repeated Morrel.\r\n\r\n“My God,” said Valentine, raising both her hands to heaven with a\r\nsublime expression, “I have done my utmost to remain a submissive\r\ndaughter; I have begged, entreated, implored; he has regarded neither\r\nmy prayers, my entreaties, nor my tears. It is done,” cried she, wiping\r\naway her tears, and resuming her firmness, “I am resolved not to die of\r\nremorse, but rather of shame. Live, Maximilian, and I will be yours.\r\nSay when shall it be? Speak, command, I will obey.”\r\n\r\nMorrel, who had already gone some few steps away, again returned, and\r\npale with joy extended both hands towards Valentine through the\r\nopening.\r\n\r\n“Valentine,” said he, “dear Valentine, you must not speak thus—rather\r\nlet me die. Why should I obtain you by violence, if our love is mutual?\r\nIs it from mere humanity you bid me live? I would then rather die.”\r\n\r\n“Truly,” murmured Valentine, “who on this earth cares for me, if he\r\ndoes not? Who has consoled me in my sorrow but he? On whom do my hopes\r\nrest? On whom does my bleeding heart repose? On him, on him, always on\r\nhim! Yes, you are right, Maximilian, I will follow you. I will leave\r\nthe paternal home, I will give up all. Oh, ungrateful girl that I am,”\r\ncried Valentine, sobbing, “I will give up all, even my dear old\r\ngrandfather, whom I had nearly forgotten.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Maximilian, “you shall not leave him. M. Noirtier has\r\nevinced, you say, a kind feeling towards me. Well, before you leave,\r\ntell him all; his consent would be your justification in God’s sight.\r\nAs soon as we are married, he shall come and live with us, instead of\r\none child, he shall have two. You have told me how you talk to him and\r\nhow he answers you; I shall very soon learn that language by signs,\r\nValentine, and I promise you solemnly, that instead of despair, it is\r\nhappiness that awaits us.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, see, Maximilian, see the power you have over me, you almost make\r\nme believe you; and yet, what you tell me is madness, for my father\r\nwill curse me—he is inflexible—he will never pardon me. Now listen to\r\nme, Maximilian; if by artifice, by entreaty, by accident—in short, if\r\nby any means I can delay this marriage, will you wait?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I promise you, as faithfully as you have promised me that this\r\nhorrible marriage shall not take place, and that if you are dragged\r\nbefore a magistrate or a priest, you will refuse.”\r\n\r\n“I promise you by all that is most sacred to me in the world, namely,\r\nby my mother.”\r\n\r\n“We will wait, then,” said Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we will wait,” replied Valentine, who revived at these words;\r\n“there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we\r\nare.”\r\n\r\n“I rely on you, Valentine,” said Morrel; “all you do will be well done;\r\nonly if they disregard your prayers, if your father and Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran insist that M. d’Épinay should be called tomorrow to sign\r\nthe contract——”\r\n\r\n“Then you have my promise, Maximilian.”\r\n\r\n“Instead of signing——”\r\n\r\n“I will go to you, and we will fly; but from this moment until then,\r\nlet us not tempt Providence, let us not see each other. It is a\r\nmiracle, it is a providence that we have not been discovered. If we\r\nwere surprised, if it were known that we met thus, we should have no\r\nfurther resource.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, Valentine; but how shall I ascertain?”\r\n\r\n“From the notary, M. Deschamps.”\r\n\r\n“I know him.”\r\n\r\n“And for myself—I will write to you, depend on me. I dread this\r\nmarriage, Maximilian, as much as you.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, my adored Valentine, thank you; that is enough. When once I\r\nknow the hour, I will hasten to this spot, you can easily get over this\r\nfence with my assistance, a carriage will await us at the gate, in\r\nwhich you will accompany me to my sister’s; there living, retired or\r\nmingling in society, as you wish, we shall be enabled to use our power\r\nto resist oppression, and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like\r\nsheep, which only defend themselves by sighs.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Valentine, “I will now acknowledge you are right,\r\nMaximilian; and now are you satisfied with your betrothal?” said the\r\nyoung girl sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n“My adored Valentine, words cannot express one half of my\r\nsatisfaction.”\r\n\r\nValentine had approached, or rather, had placed her lips so near the\r\nfence, that they nearly touched those of Morrel, which were pressed\r\nagainst the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier.\r\n\r\n“Adieu, then, till we meet again,” said Valentine, tearing herself\r\naway. “I shall hear from you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, thanks, dear love, adieu!”\r\n\r\nThe sound of a kiss was heard, and Valentine fled through the avenue.\r\nMorrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the\r\nbranches, and of her footstep on the gravel, then raised his eyes with\r\nan ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be\r\nthus loved, and then also disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next\r\nday without getting any message. It was only on the following day, at\r\nabout ten o’clock in the morning, as he was starting to call on M.\r\nDeschamps, the notary, that he received from the postman a small\r\nbillet, which he knew to be from Valentine, although he had not before\r\nseen her writing. It was to this effect:\r\n\r\n“Tears, entreaties, prayers, have availed me nothing. Yesterday, for\r\ntwo hours, I was at the church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule, and for two\r\nhours I prayed most fervently. Heaven is as inflexible as man, and the\r\nsignature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o’clock. I\r\nhave but one promise and but one heart to give; that promise is pledged\r\nto you, that heart is also yours. This evening, then, at a quarter to\r\nnine at the gate.\r\n\r\n“Your betrothed,\r\n\r\n“Valentine de Villefort.”\r\n\r\n“P.S.—My poor grandmother gets worse and worse; yesterday her fever\r\namounted to delirium; today her delirium is almost madness. You will be\r\nvery kind to me, will you not, Morrel, to make me forget my sorrow in\r\nleaving her thus? I think it is kept a secret from grandpapa Noirtier,\r\nthat the contract is to be signed this evening.”\r\n\r\nMorrel went also to the notary, who confirmed the news that the\r\ncontract was to be signed that evening. Then he went to call on Monte\r\nCristo and heard still more. Franz had been to announce the ceremony,\r\nand Madame de Villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her\r\nnot inviting him; the death of M. de Saint-Méran and the dangerous\r\nillness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she\r\nwould regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nThe day before Franz had been presented to Madame de Saint-Méran, who\r\nhad left her bed to receive him, but had been obliged to return to it\r\nimmediately after.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to suppose that Morrel’s agitation would not escape the\r\ncount’s penetrating eye. Monte Cristo was more affectionate than\r\never,—indeed, his manner was so kind that several times Morrel was on\r\nthe point of telling him all. But he recalled the promise he had made\r\nto Valentine, and kept his secret.\r\n\r\nThe young man read Valentine’s letter twenty times in the course of the\r\nday. It was her first, and on what an occasion! Each time he read it he\r\nrenewed his vow to make her happy. How great is the power of a woman\r\nwho has made so courageous a resolution! What devotion does she deserve\r\nfrom him for whom she has sacrificed everything! How ought she really\r\nto be supremely loved! She becomes at once a queen and a wife, and it\r\nis impossible to thank and love her sufficiently.\r\n\r\nMorrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear Valentine\r\nsay, “Here I am, Maximilian; come and help me.” He had arranged\r\neverything for her escape; two ladders were hidden in the clover-field;\r\na cabriolet was ordered for Maximilian alone, without a servant,\r\nwithout lights; at the turning of the first street they would light the\r\nlamps, as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by\r\ntoo many precautions. Occasionally he shuddered; he thought of the\r\nmoment when, from the top of that wall, he should protect the descent\r\nof his dear Valentine, pressing in his arms for the first time her of\r\nwhom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand.\r\n\r\nWhen the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near,\r\nhe wished for solitude, his agitation was extreme; a simple question\r\nfrom a friend would have irritated him. He shut himself in his room,\r\nand tried to read, but his eye glanced over the page without\r\nunderstanding a word, and he threw away the book, and for the second\r\ntime sat down to sketch his plan, the ladders and the fence.\r\n\r\nAt length the hour drew near. Never did a man deeply in love allow the\r\nclocks to go on peacefully. Morrel tormented his so effectually that\r\nthey struck eight at half-past six. He then said, “It is time to start;\r\nthe signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o’clock, but\r\nperhaps Valentine will not wait for that.” Consequently, Morrel, having\r\nleft the Rue Meslay at half-past eight by his timepiece, entered the\r\nclover-field while the clock of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule was striking\r\neight. The horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin,\r\nwhere Morrel had often waited.\r\n\r\nThe night gradually drew on, and the foliage in the garden assumed a\r\ndeeper hue. Then Morrel came out from his hiding-place with a beating\r\nheart, and looked through the small opening in the gate; there was yet\r\nno one to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe clock struck half-past eight, and still another half-hour was\r\npassed in waiting, while Morrel walked to and fro, and gazed more and\r\nmore frequently through the opening. The garden became darker still,\r\nbut in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress, and in the\r\nsilence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps. The house, which\r\nwas discernible through the trees, remained in darkness, and gave no\r\nindication that so important an event as the signature of a\r\nmarriage-contract was going on. Morrel looked at his watch, which\r\nwanted a quarter to ten; but soon the same clock he had already heard\r\nstrike two or three times rectified the error by striking half-past\r\nnine.\r\n\r\nThis was already half an hour past the time Valentine had fixed. It was\r\na terrible moment for the young man. The slightest rustling of the\r\nfoliage, the least whistling of the wind, attracted his attention, and\r\ndrew the perspiration to his brow; then he tremblingly fixed his\r\nladder, and, not to lose a moment, placed his foot on the first step.\r\nAmidst all these alternations of hope and fear, the clock struck ten.\r\n“It is impossible,” said Maximilian, “that the signing of a contract\r\nshould occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions. I have\r\nweighed all the chances, calculated the time required for all the\r\nforms; something must have happened.”\r\n\r\nAnd then he walked rapidly to and fro, and pressed his burning forehead\r\nagainst the fence. Had Valentine fainted? or had she been discovered\r\nand stopped in her flight? These were the only obstacles which appeared\r\npossible to the young man.\r\n\r\nThe idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape, and\r\nthat she had fainted in one of the paths, was the one that most\r\nimpressed itself upon his mind. “In that case,” said he, “I should lose\r\nher, and by my own fault.” He dwelt on this idea for a moment, then it\r\nappeared reality. He even thought he could perceive something on the\r\nground at a distance; he ventured to call, and it seemed to him that\r\nthe wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh.\r\n\r\nAt last the half-hour struck. It was impossible to wait longer, his\r\ntemples throbbed violently, his eyes were growing dim; he passed one\r\nleg over the wall, and in a moment leaped down on the other side. He\r\nwas on Villefort’s premises—had arrived there by scaling the wall. What\r\nmight be the consequences? However, he had not ventured thus far to\r\ndraw back. He followed a short distance close under the wall, then\r\ncrossed a path, hid entered a clump of trees. In a moment he had passed\r\nthrough them, and could see the house distinctly.\r\n\r\n30341m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was\r\nnot illuminated. Instead of lights at every window, as is customary on\r\ndays of ceremony, he saw only a gray mass, which was veiled also by a\r\ncloud, which at that moment obscured the moon’s feeble light. A light\r\nmoved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor.\r\nThese three windows were in Madame de Saint-Méran’s room. Another\r\nremained motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de\r\nVillefort’s bedroom. Morrel guessed all this. So many times, in order\r\nto follow Valentine in thought at every hour in the day, had he made\r\nher describe the whole house, that without having seen it he knew it\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThis darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentine’s\r\nabsence had done. Almost mad with grief, and determined to venture\r\neverything in order to see Valentine once more, and be certain of the\r\nmisfortune he feared, Morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees, and\r\nwas going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower-garden,\r\nwhen the sound of a voice, still at some distance, but which was borne\r\nupon the wind, reached him. At this sound, as he was already partially\r\nexposed to view, he stepped back and concealed himself completely,\r\nremaining perfectly motionless.\r\n\r\nHe had formed his resolution. If it was Valentine alone, he would speak\r\nas she passed; if she was accompanied, and he could not speak, still he\r\nshould see her, and know that she was safe; if they were strangers, he\r\nwould listen to their conversation, and might understand something of\r\nthis hitherto incomprehensible mystery.\r\n\r\nThe moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had\r\nconcealed it, and Morrel saw Villefort come out upon the steps,\r\nfollowed by a gentleman in black. They descended, and advanced towards\r\nthe clump of trees, and Morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as\r\nDoctor d’Avrigny.\r\n\r\n30339m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young man, seeing them approach, drew back mechanically, until he\r\nfound himself stopped by a sycamore-tree in the centre of the clump;\r\nthere he was compelled to remain. Soon the two gentlemen stopped also.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear doctor,” said the procureur, “Heaven declares itself\r\nagainst my house! What a dreadful death—what a blow! Seek not to\r\nconsole me; alas, nothing can alleviate so great a sorrow—the wound is\r\ntoo deep and too fresh! Dead, dead!”\r\n\r\nThe cold sweat sprang to the young man’s brow, and his teeth chattered.\r\nWho could be dead in that house, which Villefort himself had called\r\naccursed?\r\n\r\n“My dear M. de Villefort,” replied the doctor, with a tone which\r\nredoubled the terror of the young man, “I have not led you here to\r\nconsole you; on the contrary——”\r\n\r\n“What can you mean?” asked the procureur, alarmed.\r\n\r\n“I mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you,\r\nthere is another, perhaps, still greater.”\r\n\r\n“Can it be possible?” murmured Villefort, clasping his hands. “What are\r\nyou going to tell me?”\r\n\r\n“Are we quite alone, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, quite; but why all these precautions?”\r\n\r\n“Because I have a terrible secret to communicate to you,” said the\r\ndoctor. “Let us sit down.”\r\n\r\nVillefort fell, rather than seated himself. The doctor stood before\r\nhim, with one hand placed on his shoulder. Morrel, horrified, supported\r\nhis head with one hand, and with the other pressed his heart, lest its\r\nbeatings should be heard. “Dead, dead!” repeated he within himself; and\r\nhe felt as if he were also dying.\r\n\r\n“Speak, doctor—I am listening,” said Villefort; “strike—I am prepared\r\nfor everything!”\r\n\r\n“Madame de Saint-Méran was, doubtless, advancing in years, but she\r\nenjoyed excellent health.” Morrel began again to breathe freely, which\r\nhe had not done during the last ten minutes.\r\n\r\n“Grief has consumed her,” said Villefort—“yes, grief, doctor! After\r\nliving forty years with the marquis——”\r\n\r\n“It is not grief, my dear Villefort,” said the doctor; “grief may kill,\r\nalthough it rarely does, and never in a day, never in an hour, never in\r\nten minutes.” Villefort answered nothing, he simply raised his head,\r\nwhich had been cast down before, and looked at the doctor with\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n“Were you present during the last struggle?” asked M. d’Avrigny.\r\n\r\n“I was,” replied the procureur; “you begged me not to leave.”\r\n\r\n“Did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran has fallen a victim?”\r\n\r\n“I did. Madame de Saint-Méran had three successive attacks, at\r\nintervals of some minutes, each one more serious than the former. When\r\nyou arrived, Madame de Saint-Méran had already been panting for breath\r\nsome minutes; she then had a fit, which I took to be simply a nervous\r\nattack, and it was only when I saw her raise herself in the bed, and\r\nher limbs and neck appear stiffened, that I became really alarmed. Then\r\nI understood from your countenance there was more to fear than I had\r\nthought. This crisis past, I endeavored to catch your eye, but could\r\nnot. You held her hand—you were feeling her pulse—and the second fit\r\ncame on before you had turned towards me. This was more terrible than\r\nthe first; the same nervous movements were repeated, and the mouth\r\ncontracted and turned purple.”\r\n\r\n“And at the third she expired.”\r\n\r\n“At the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of tetanus; you\r\nconfirmed my opinion.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, before others,” replied the doctor; “but now we are alone——”\r\n\r\n“What are you going to say? Oh, spare me!”\r\n\r\n“That the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are\r\nthe same.”\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort started from his seat, then in a moment fell down\r\nagain, silent and motionless. Morrel knew not if he were dreaming or\r\nawake.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said the doctor; “I know the full importance of the statement\r\nI have just made, and the disposition of the man to whom I have made\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend?” asked Villefort.\r\n\r\n“As a friend, and only as a friend, at this moment. The similarity in\r\nthe symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so\r\ngreat, that were I obliged to affirm by oath what I have now stated, I\r\nshould hesitate; I therefore repeat to you, I speak not to a\r\nmagistrate, but to a friend. And to that friend I say, ‘During the\r\nthree-quarters of an hour that the struggle continued, I watched the\r\nconvulsions and the death of Madame de Saint-Méran, and am thoroughly\r\nconvinced that not only did her death proceed from poison, but I could\r\nalso specify the poison.’”\r\n\r\n“Can it be possible?”\r\n\r\n“The symptoms are marked, do you see?—sleep broken by nervous spasms,\r\nexcitation of the brain, torpor of the nerve centres. Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine,\r\nwhich by some mistake, perhaps, has been given to her.”\r\n\r\nVillefort seized the doctor’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is impossible,” said he, “I must be dreaming! It is frightful\r\nto hear such things from such a man as you! Tell me, I entreat you, my\r\ndear doctor, that you may be deceived.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless I may, but——”\r\n\r\n“But?”\r\n\r\n30345m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“But I do not think so.”\r\n\r\n“Have pity on me doctor! So many dreadful things have happened to me\r\nlately that I am on the verge of madness.”\r\n\r\n“Has anyone besides me seen Madame de Saint-Méran?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Has anything been sent for from a chemist’s that I have not examined?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Had Madame de Saint-Méran any enemies?”\r\n\r\n“Not to my knowledge.”\r\n\r\n“Would her death affect anyone’s interest?”\r\n\r\n“It could not indeed, my daughter is her only heiress—Valentine alone.\r\nOh, if such a thought could present itself, I would stab myself to\r\npunish my heart for having for one instant harbored it.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, my dear friend,” said M. d’Avrigny, “I would not accuse\r\nanyone; I speak only of an accident, you understand,—of a mistake,—but\r\nwhether accident or mistake, the fact is there; it is on my conscience\r\nand compels me to speak aloud to you. Make inquiry.”\r\n\r\n“Of whom?—how?—of what?”\r\n\r\n“May not Barrois, the old servant, have made a mistake, and have given\r\nMadame de Saint-Méran a dose prepared for his master?”\r\n\r\n“For my father?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But how could a dose prepared for M. Noirtier poison Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is more simple. You know poisons become remedies in certain\r\ndiseases, of which paralysis is one. For instance, having tried every\r\nother remedy to restore movement and speech to M. Noirtier, I resolved\r\nto try one last means, and for three months I have been giving him\r\nbrucine; so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six\r\ngrains. This quantity, which is perfectly safe to administer to the\r\nparalyzed frame of M. Noirtier, which has become gradually accustomed\r\nto it, would be sufficient to kill another person.”\r\n\r\n“My dear doctor, there is no communication between M. Noirtier’s\r\napartment and that of Madame de Saint-Méran, and Barrois never entered\r\nmy mother-in-law’s room. In short, doctor although I know you to be the\r\nmost conscientious man in the world, and although I place the utmost\r\nreliance in you, I want, notwithstanding my conviction, to believe this\r\naxiom, _errare humanum est_.”\r\n\r\n“Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with\r\nmyself?”\r\n\r\n“Why do you ask me that?—what do you wish?”\r\n\r\n“Send for him; I will tell him what I have seen, and we will consult\r\ntogether, and examine the body.”\r\n\r\n“And you will find traces of poison?”\r\n\r\n“No, I did not say of poison, but we can prove what was the state of\r\nthe body; we shall discover the cause of her sudden death, and we shall\r\nsay, ‘Dear Villefort, if this thing has been caused by negligence,\r\nwatch over your servants; if from hatred, watch your enemies.’”\r\n\r\n“What do you propose to me, d’Avrigny?” said Villefort in despair; “so\r\nsoon as another is admitted into our secret, an inquest will become\r\nnecessary; and an inquest in my house—impossible! Still,” continued the\r\nprocureur, looking at the doctor with uneasiness, “if you wish it—if\r\nyou demand it, why then it shall be done. But, doctor, you see me\r\nalready so grieved—how can I introduce into my house so much scandal,\r\nafter so much sorrow? My wife and my daughter would die of it! And I,\r\ndoctor—you know a man does not arrive at the post I occupy—one has not\r\nbeen king’s attorney twenty-five years without having amassed a\r\ntolerable number of enemies; mine are numerous. Let this affair be\r\ntalked of, it will be a triumph for them, which will make them rejoice,\r\nand cover me with shame. Pardon me, doctor, these worldly ideas; were\r\nyou a priest I should not dare tell you that, but you are a man, and\r\nyou know mankind. Doctor, pray recall your words; you have said\r\nnothing, have you?”\r\n\r\n“My dear M. de Villefort,” replied the doctor, “my first duty is to\r\nhumanity. I would have saved Madame de Saint-Méran, if science could\r\nhave done it; but she is dead and my duty regards the living. Let us\r\nbury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts; I am\r\nwilling, if anyone should suspect this, that my silence on the subject\r\nshould be imputed to my ignorance. Meanwhile, sir, watch always—watch\r\ncarefully, for perhaps the evil may not stop here. And when you have\r\nfound the culprit, if you find him, I will say to you, ‘You are a\r\nmagistrate, do as you will!’”\r\n\r\n“I thank you, doctor,” said Villefort with indescribable joy; “I never\r\nhad a better friend than you.” And, as if he feared Doctor d’Avrigny\r\nwould recall his promise, he hurried him towards the house.\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone, Morrel ventured out from under the trees, and the\r\nmoon shone upon his face, which was so pale it might have been taken\r\nfor that of a ghost.\r\n\r\n“I am manifestly protected in a most wonderful, but most terrible\r\nmanner,” said he; “but Valentine, poor girl, how will she bear so much\r\nsorrow?”\r\n\r\nAs he thought thus, he looked alternately at the window with red\r\ncurtains and the three windows with white curtains. The light had\r\nalmost disappeared from the former; doubtless Madame de Villefort had\r\njust put out her lamp, and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light\r\non the window. At the extremity of the building, on the contrary, he\r\nsaw one of the three windows open. A wax-light placed on the\r\nmantle-piece threw some of its pale rays without, and a shadow was seen\r\nfor one moment on the balcony. Morrel shuddered; he thought he heard a\r\nsob.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be wondered at that his mind, generally so courageous, but\r\nnow disturbed by the two strongest human passions, love and fear, was\r\nweakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts. Although it\r\nwas impossible that Valentine should see him, hidden as he was, he\r\nthought he heard the shadow at the window call him; his disturbed mind\r\ntold him so. This double error became an irresistible reality, and by\r\none of the incomprehensible transports of youth, he bounded from his\r\nhiding-place, and with two strides, at the risk of being seen, at the\r\nrisk of alarming Valentine, at the risk of being discovered by some\r\nexclamation which might escape the young girl, he crossed the\r\nflower-garden, which by the light of the moon resembled a large white\r\nlake, and having passed the rows of orange-trees which extended in\r\nfront of the house, he reached the step, ran quickly up and pushed the\r\ndoor, which opened without offering any resistance.\r\n\r\nValentine had not seen him. Her eyes, raised towards heaven, were\r\nwatching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure, its form that of a\r\nshadow mounting towards heaven. Her poetic and excited mind pictured it\r\nas the soul of her grandmother.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase,\r\nwhich, being carpeted, prevented his approach being heard, and he had\r\nregained that degree of confidence that the presence of M. de Villefort\r\neven would not have alarmed him. He was quite prepared for any such\r\nencounter. He would at once approach Valentine’s father and acknowledge\r\nall, begging Villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two\r\nfond and loving hearts. Morrel was mad.\r\n\r\nHappily he did not meet anyone. Now, especially, did he find the\r\ndescription Valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to\r\nhim; he arrived safely at the top of the staircase, and while he was\r\nfeeling his way, a sob indicated the direction he was to take. He\r\nturned back, a door partly open enabled him to see his road, and to\r\nhear the voice of one in sorrow. He pushed the door open and entered.\r\nAt the other end of the room, under a white sheet which covered it, lay\r\nthe corpse, still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so\r\nunexpectedly overheard. By its side, on her knees, and with her head\r\nburied in the cushion of an easy-chair, was Valentine, trembling and\r\nsobbing, her hands extended above her head, clasped and stiff. She had\r\nturned from the window, which remained open, and was praying in accents\r\nthat would have affected the most unfeeling; her words were rapid,\r\nincoherent, unintelligible, for the burning weight of grief almost\r\nstopped her utterance.\r\n\r\nThe moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn\r\npaler, and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene. Morrel could not\r\nresist this; he was not exemplary for piety, he was not easily\r\nimpressed, but Valentine suffering, weeping, wringing her hands before\r\nhim, was more than he could bear in silence. He sighed, and whispered a\r\nname, and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of\r\nthe chair—a head like that of a Magdalen by Correggio—was raised and\r\nturned towards him. Valentine perceived him without betraying the least\r\nsurprise. A heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to\r\nminor emotions. Morrel held out his hand to her. Valentine, as her only\r\napology for not having met him, pointed to the corpse under the sheet,\r\nand began to sob again.\r\n\r\nNeither dared for some time to speak in that room. They hesitated to\r\nbreak the silence which death seemed to impose; at length Valentine\r\nventured.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said she, “how came you here? Alas, I would say you are\r\nwelcome, had not death opened the way for you into this house.”\r\n\r\n“Valentine,” said Morrel with a trembling voice, “I had waited since\r\nhalf-past eight, and did not see you come; I became uneasy, leaped the\r\nwall, found my way through the garden, when voices conversing about the\r\nfatal event——”\r\n\r\n“What voices?” asked Valentine. Morrel shuddered as he thought of the\r\nconversation of the doctor and M. de Villefort, and he thought he could\r\nsee through the sheet the extended hands, the stiff neck, and the\r\npurple lips.\r\n\r\n“Your servants,” said he, “who were repeating the whole of the\r\nsorrowful story; from them I learned it all.”\r\n\r\n“But it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here, love.”\r\n\r\n“Forgive me,” replied Morrel; “I will go away.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Valentine, “you might meet someone; stay.”\r\n\r\n“But if anyone should come here——”\r\n\r\nThe young girl shook her head. “No one will come,” said she; “do not\r\nfear, there is our safeguard,” pointing to the bed.\r\n\r\n“But what has become of M. d’Épinay?” replied Morrel.\r\n\r\n30349m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“M. Franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was\r\ndying.”\r\n\r\n“Alas,” said Morrel with a feeling of selfish joy; for he thought this\r\ndeath would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely.\r\n\r\n“But what redoubles my sorrow,” continued the young girl, as if this\r\nfeeling was to receive its immediate punishment, “is that the poor old\r\nlady, on her death-bed, requested that the marriage might take place as\r\nsoon as possible; she also, thinking to protect me, was acting against\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Hark!” said Morrel. They both listened; steps were distinctly heard in\r\nthe corridor and on the stairs.\r\n\r\n“It is my father, who has just left his study.”\r\n\r\n“To accompany the doctor to the door,” added Morrel.\r\n\r\n“How do you know it is the doctor?” asked Valentine, astonished.\r\n\r\n“I imagined it must be,” said Morrel.\r\n\r\nValentine looked at the young man; they heard the street door close,\r\nthen M. de Villefort locked the garden door, and returned upstairs. He\r\nstopped a moment in the anteroom, as if hesitating whether to turn to\r\nhis own apartment or into Madame de Saint-Méran’s; Morrel concealed\r\nhimself behind a door; Valentine remained motionless, grief seeming to\r\ndeprive her of all fear. M. de Villefort passed on to his own room.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Valentine, “you can neither go out by the front door nor by\r\nthe garden.”\r\n\r\nMorrel looked at her with astonishment.\r\n\r\n“There is but one way left you that is safe,” said she; “it is through\r\nmy grandfather’s room.” She rose. “Come,” she added.\r\n\r\n“Where?” asked Maximilian.\r\n\r\n“To my grandfather’s room.”\r\n\r\n“I in M. Noirtier’s apartment?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Can you mean it, Valentine?”\r\n\r\n“I have long wished it; he is my only remaining friend and we both need\r\nhis help,—come.”\r\n\r\n“Be careful, Valentine,” said Morrel, hesitating to comply with the\r\nyoung girl’s wishes; “I now see my error—I acted like a madman in\r\ncoming in here. Are you sure you are more reasonable?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Valentine; “and I have but one scruple,—that of leaving my\r\ndear grandmother’s remains, which I had undertaken to watch.”\r\n\r\n“Valentine,” said Morrel, “death is in itself sacred.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Valentine; “besides, it will not be for long.”\r\n\r\nShe then crossed the corridor, and led the way down a narrow staircase\r\nto M. Noirtier’s room; Morrel followed her on tiptoe; at the door they\r\nfound the old servant.\r\n\r\n“Barrois,” said Valentine, “shut the door, and let no one come in.”\r\n\r\nShe passed first.\r\n\r\nNoirtier, seated in his chair, and listening to every sound, was\r\nwatching the door; he saw Valentine, and his eye brightened. There was\r\nsomething grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which\r\nstruck the old man, and immediately his bright eye began to\r\ninterrogate.\r\n\r\n“Dear grandfather.” said she hurriedly, “you know poor grandmamma died\r\nan hour since, and now I have no friend in the world but you.”\r\n\r\nHis expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness.\r\n\r\n“To you alone, then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?”\r\n\r\nThe paralytic motioned “Yes.”\r\n\r\nValentine took Maximilian’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Look attentively, then, at this gentleman.”\r\n\r\nThe old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on\r\nMorrel.\r\n\r\n“It is M. Maximilian Morrel,” said she; “the son of that good merchant\r\nof Marseilles, whom you doubtless recollect.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the old man.\r\n\r\n“He brings an irreproachable name, which Maximilian is likely to render\r\nglorious, since at thirty years of age he is a captain, an officer of\r\nthe Legion of Honor.”\r\n\r\nThe old man signified that he recollected him.\r\n\r\n“Well, grandpapa,” said Valentine, kneeling before him, and pointing to\r\nMaximilian, “I love him, and will be only his; were I compelled to\r\nmarry another, I would destroy myself.”\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts.\r\n\r\n“You like M. Maximilian Morrel, do you not, grandpapa?” asked\r\nValentine.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And you will protect us, who are your children, against the will of my\r\nfather?”\r\n\r\nNoirtier cast an intelligent glance at Morrel, as if to say, “perhaps I\r\nmay.”\r\n\r\nMaximilian understood him.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” said he, “you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your\r\ndeceased grandmother’s room, will you allow me the honor of a few\r\nminutes’ conversation with M. Noirtier?”\r\n\r\n“That is it,” said the old man’s eye. Then he looked anxiously at\r\nValentine.\r\n\r\n“Do you fear he will not understand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we have so often spoken of you, that he knows exactly how I talk\r\nto you.” Then turning to Maximilian, with an adorable smile; although\r\nshaded by sorrow,—“He knows everything I know,” said she.\r\n\r\nValentine arose, placed a chair for Morrel, requested Barrois not to\r\nadmit anyone, and having tenderly embraced her grandfather, and\r\nsorrowfully taken leave of Morrel, she went away. To prove to Noirtier\r\nthat he was in Valentine’s confidence and knew all their secrets,\r\nMorrel took the dictionary, a pen, and some paper, and placed them all\r\non a table where there was a light.\r\n\r\n“But first,” said Morrel, “allow me, sir, to tell you who I am, how\r\nmuch I love Mademoiselle Valentine, and what are my designs respecting\r\nher.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier made a sign that he would listen.\r\n\r\nIt was an imposing sight to witness this old man, apparently a mere\r\nuseless burden, becoming the sole protector, support, and adviser of\r\nthe lovers who were both young, beautiful, and strong. His remarkably\r\nnoble and austere expression struck Morrel, who began his story with\r\ntrembling. He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with\r\nValentine, and how he had loved her, and that Valentine, in her\r\nsolitude and her misfortune, had accepted the offer of his devotion. He\r\ntold him his birth, his position, his fortune, and more than once, when\r\nhe consulted the look of the paralytic, that look answered, “That is\r\ngood, proceed.”\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Morrel, when he had finished the first part of his\r\nrecital, “now I have told you of my love and my hopes, may I inform you\r\nof my intentions?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” signified the old man.\r\n\r\n“This was our resolution; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate, in\r\nwhich I intended to carry off Valentine to my sister’s house, to marry\r\nher, and to wait respectfully M. de Villefort’s pardon.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Noirtier.\r\n\r\n“We must not do so?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“You do not sanction our project?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“There is another way,” said Morrel. The old man’s interrogative eye\r\nsaid, “Which?”\r\n\r\n“I will go,” continued Maximilian, “I will seek M. Franz d’Épinay—I am\r\nhappy to be able to mention this in Mademoiselle de Villefort’s\r\nabsence—and will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to\r\nchallenge me.” Noirtier’s look continued to interrogate.\r\n\r\n“You wish to know what I will do?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I will find him, as I told you. I will tell him the ties which bind me\r\nto Mademoiselle Valentine; if he be a sensible man, he will prove it by\r\nrenouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed, and will secure\r\nmy friendship, and love until death; if he refuse, either through\r\ninterest or ridiculous pride, after I have proved to him that he would\r\nbe forcing my wife from me, that Valentine loves me, and will have no\r\nother, I will fight with him, give him every advantage, and I shall\r\nkill him, or he will kill me; if I am victorious, he will not marry\r\nValentine, and if I die, I am very sure Valentine will not marry him.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier watched, with indescribable pleasure, this noble and sincere\r\ncountenance, on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted,\r\nadding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to\r\na sound and faithful drawing.\r\n\r\nStill, when Morrel had finished, he shut his eyes several times, which\r\nwas his manner of saying “No.”\r\n\r\n“No?” said Morrel; “you disapprove of this second project, as you did\r\nof the first?”\r\n\r\n“I do,” signified the old man.\r\n\r\n“But what then must be done?” asked Morrel. “Madame de Saint-Méran’s\r\nlast request was, that the marriage might not be delayed; must I let\r\nthings take their course?” Noirtier did not move. “I understand,” said\r\nMorrel; “I am to wait.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But delay may ruin our plan, sir,” replied the young man. “Alone,\r\nValentine has no power; she will be compelled to submit. I am here\r\nalmost miraculously, and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity\r\nto occur again. Believe me, there are only the two plans I have\r\nproposed to you; forgive my vanity, and tell me which you prefer. Do\r\nyou authorize Mademoiselle Valentine to intrust herself to my honor?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Do you prefer I should seek M. d’Épinay?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Whence then will come the help we need—from chance?” resumed Morrel.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“From you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You thoroughly understand me, sir? Pardon my eagerness, for my life\r\ndepends on your answer. Will our help come from you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You are sure of it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.” There was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer,\r\nno one could, at any rate, doubt his will, if they did his power.\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you a thousand times! But how, unless a miracle should\r\nrestore your speech, your gesture, your movement, how can you, chained\r\nto that armchair, dumb and motionless, oppose this marriage?” A smile\r\nlit up the old man’s face, a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Then I must wait?” asked the young man.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But the contract?” The same smile returned. “Will you assure me it\r\nshall not be signed?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Noirtier.\r\n\r\n“The contract shall not be signed!” cried Morrel. “Oh, pardon me, sir;\r\nI can scarcely realize so great a happiness. Will they not sign it?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the paralytic. Notwithstanding that assurance, Morrel still\r\nhesitated. This promise of an impotent old man was so strange that,\r\ninstead of being the result of the power of his will, it might emanate\r\nfrom enfeebled organs. Is it not natural that the madman, ignorant of\r\nhis folly, should attempt things beyond his power? The weak man talks\r\nof burdens he can raise, the timid of giants he can confront, the poor\r\nof treasures he spends, the most humble peasant, in the height of his\r\npride, calls himself Jupiter. Whether Noirtier understood the young\r\nman’s indecision, or whether he had not full confidence in his\r\ndocility, he looked uneasily at him.\r\n\r\n“What do you wish, sir?” asked Morrel; “that I should renew my promise\r\nof remaining tranquil?” Noirtier’s eye remained fixed and firm, as if\r\nto imply that a promise did not suffice; then it passed from his face\r\nto his hands.\r\n\r\n“Shall I swear to you, sir?” asked Maximilian.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the paralytic with the same solemnity. Morrel understood\r\nthat the old man attached great importance to an oath. He extended his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“I swear to you, on my honor,” said he, “to await your decision\r\nrespecting the course I am to pursue with M. d’Épinay.”\r\n\r\n“That is right,” said the old man.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Morrel, “do you wish me to retire?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Without seeing Mademoiselle Valentine?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nMorrel made a sign that he was ready to obey. “But,” said he, “first\r\nallow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now.” Noirtier’s\r\nexpression could not be understood. The young man pressed his lips on\r\nthe same spot, on the old man’s forehead, where Valentine’s had been.\r\nThen he bowed a second time and retired.\r\n\r\nHe found outside the door the old servant, to whom Valentine had given\r\ndirections. Morrel was conducted along a dark passage, which led to a\r\nlittle door opening on the garden, soon found the spot where he had\r\nentered, with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall,\r\nand by his ladder was in an instant in the clover-field where his\r\ncabriolet was still waiting for him. He got in it, and thoroughly\r\nwearied by so many emotions, arrived about midnight in the Rue Meslay,\r\nthrew himself on his bed and slept soundly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME FOUR\r\n\r\n40010m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40012m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40020m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 74. The Villefort Family Vault\r\n\r\nTwo days after, a considerable crowd was assembled, towards ten o’clock\r\nin the morning, around the door of M. de Villefort’s house, and a long\r\nfile of mourning-coaches and private carriages extended along the\r\nFaubourg Saint-Honoré and the Rue de la Pépinière. Among them was one\r\nof a very singular form, which appeared to have come from a distance.\r\nIt was a kind of covered wagon, painted black, and was one of the first\r\nto arrive. Inquiry was made, and it was ascertained that, by a strange\r\ncoincidence, this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de\r\nSaint-Méran, and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral\r\nwould follow two. Their number was great. The Marquis de Saint-Méran,\r\none of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of Louis XVIII. and\r\nKing Charles X., had preserved a great number of friends, and these,\r\nadded to the personages whom the usages of society gave Villefort a\r\nclaim on, formed a considerable body.\r\n\r\nDue information was given to the authorities, and permission obtained\r\nthat the two funerals should take place at the same time. A second\r\nhearse, decked with the same funereal pomp, was brought to M. de\r\nVillefort’s door, and the coffin removed into it from the post-wagon.\r\nThe two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise,\r\nwhere M. de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the\r\nreception of his family. The remains of poor Renée were already\r\ndeposited there, and now, after ten years of separation, her father and\r\nmother were to be reunited with her.\r\n\r\nThe Parisians, always curious, always affected by funereal display,\r\nlooked on with religious silence while the splendid procession\r\naccompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old\r\naristocracy—the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to\r\ntheir principles.\r\n\r\nIn one of the mourning-coaches Beauchamp, Debray, and Château-Renaud\r\nwere talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness.\r\n\r\n“I saw Madame de Saint-Méran only last year at Marseilles, when I was\r\ncoming back from Algiers,” said Château-Renaud; “she looked like a\r\nwoman destined to live to be a hundred years old, from her apparent\r\nsound health and great activity of mind and body. How old was she?”\r\n\r\n“Franz assured me,” replied Albert, “that she was sixty-six years old.\r\nBut she has not died of old age, but of grief; it appears that since\r\nthe death of the marquis, which affected her very deeply, she has not\r\ncompletely recovered her reason.”\r\n\r\n“But of what disease, then, did she die?” asked Debray.\r\n\r\n“It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which\r\nis the same thing, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Nearly.”\r\n\r\n“It is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy,” said Beauchamp.\r\n“Madame de Saint-Méran, whom I once saw, was short, of slender form,\r\nand of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament; grief could\r\nhardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said Albert, “whatever disease or doctor may have killed\r\nher, M. de Villefort, or rather, Mademoiselle Valentine,—or, still\r\nrather, our friend Franz, inherits a magnificent fortune, amounting, I\r\nbelieve, to 80,000 livres per annum.”\r\n\r\n“And this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old Jacobin,\r\nNoirtier.”\r\n\r\n“That is a tenacious old grandfather,” said Beauchamp. “_Tenacem\r\npropositi virum_. I think he must have made an agreement with death to\r\noutlive all his heirs, and he appears likely to succeed. He resembles\r\nthe old Conventionalist of ’93, who said to Napoleon, in 1814, ‘You\r\nbend because your empire is a young stem, weakened by rapid growth.\r\nTake the Republic for a tutor; let us return with renewed strength to\r\nthe battle-field, and I promise you 500,000 soldiers, another Marengo,\r\nand a second Austerlitz. Ideas do not become extinct, sire; they\r\nslumber sometimes, but only revive the stronger before they sleep\r\nentirely.’”\r\n\r\n“Ideas and men appeared the same to him,” said Albert. “One thing only\r\npuzzles me, namely, how Franz d’Épinay will like a grandfather who\r\ncannot be separated from his wife. But where is Franz?”\r\n\r\n“In the first carriage, with M. de Villefort, who considers him already\r\nas one of the family.”\r\n\r\n40024m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the conversation in almost all the carriages; these two sudden\r\ndeaths, so quickly following each other, astonished everyone, but no\r\none suspected the terrible secret which M. d’Avrigny had communicated,\r\nin his nocturnal walk to M. de Villefort. They arrived in about an hour\r\nat the cemetery; the weather was mild, but dull, and in harmony with\r\nthe funeral ceremony. Among the groups which flocked towards the family\r\nvault, Château-Renaud recognized Morrel, who had come alone in a\r\ncabriolet, and walked silently along the path bordered with yew-trees.\r\n\r\n“You here?” said Château-Renaud, passing his arms through the young\r\ncaptain’s; “are you a friend of Villefort’s? How is it that I have\r\nnever met you at his house?”\r\n\r\n“I am no acquaintance of M. de Villefort’s,” answered Morrel, “but I\r\nwas of Madame de Saint-Méran.” Albert came up to them at this moment\r\nwith Franz.\r\n\r\n“The time and place are but ill-suited for an introduction.” said\r\nAlbert; “but we are not superstitious. M. Morrel, allow me to present\r\nto you M. Franz d’Épinay, a delightful travelling companion, with whom\r\nI made the tour of Italy. My dear Franz, M. Maximilian Morrel, an\r\nexcellent friend I have acquired in your absence, and whose name you\r\nwill hear me mention every time I make any allusion to affection, wit,\r\nor amiability.”\r\n\r\nMorrel hesitated for a moment; he feared it would be hypocritical to\r\naccost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing, but\r\nhis oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory;\r\nhe struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to Franz.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle de Villefort is in deep sorrow, is she not?” said Debray\r\nto Franz.\r\n\r\n“Extremely,” replied he; “she looked so pale this morning, I scarcely\r\nknew her.”\r\n\r\nThese apparently simple words pierced Morrel to the heart. This man had\r\nseen Valentine, and spoken to her! The young and high-spirited officer\r\nrequired all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath. He took\r\nthe arm of Château-Renaud, and turned towards the vault, where the\r\nattendants had already placed the two coffins.\r\n\r\n“This is a magnificent habitation,” said Beauchamp, looking towards the\r\nmausoleum; “a summer and winter palace. You will, in turn, enter it, my\r\ndear d’Épinay, for you will soon be numbered as one of the family. I,\r\nas a philosopher, should like a little country-house, a cottage down\r\nthere under the trees, without so many free-stones over my poor body.\r\nIn dying, I will say to those around me what Voltaire wrote to Piron:\r\n‘_Eo rus_, and all will be over.’ But come, Franz, take courage, your\r\nwife is an heiress.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, Beauchamp, you are unbearable. Politics has made you laugh at\r\neverything, and political men have made you disbelieve everything. But\r\nwhen you have the honor of associating with ordinary men, and the\r\npleasure of leaving politics for a moment, try to find your\r\naffectionate heart, which you leave with your stick when you go to the\r\nChamber.”\r\n\r\n“But tell me,” said Beauchamp, “what is life? Is it not a halt in\r\nDeath’s anteroom?”\r\n\r\n40026m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I am prejudiced against Beauchamp,” said Albert, drawing Franz away,\r\nand leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with\r\nDebray.\r\n\r\nThe Villefort vault formed a square of white stones, about twenty feet\r\nhigh; an interior partition separated the two families, and each\r\napartment had its entrance door. Here were not, as in other tombs,\r\nignoble drawers, one above another, where thrift bestows its dead and\r\nlabels them like specimens in a museum; all that was visible within the\r\nbronze gates was a gloomy-looking room, separated by a wall from the\r\nvault itself. The two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this\r\nwall, and enclosed the Villefort and Saint-Méran coffins. There grief\r\nmight freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling\r\nloungers who came from a picnic party to visit Père-Lachaise, or by\r\nlovers who make it their rendezvous.\r\n\r\nThe two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their\r\nreception in the right-hand crypt belonging to the Saint-Méran family.\r\nVillefort, Franz, and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary.\r\n\r\nAs the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door, and\r\nthere was no address given, the party all separated; Château-Renaud,\r\nAlbert, and Morrel, went one way, and Debray and Beauchamp the other.\r\nFranz remained with M. de Villefort; at the gate of the cemetery Morrel\r\nmade an excuse to wait; he saw Franz and M. de Villefort get into the\r\nsame mourning-coach, and thought this meeting forboded evil. He then\r\nreturned to Paris, and although in the same carriage with\r\nChâteau-Renaud and Albert, he did not hear one word of their\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nAs Franz was about to take leave of M. de Villefort, “When shall I see\r\nyou again?” said the latter.\r\n\r\n“At what time you please, sir,” replied Franz.\r\n\r\n“As soon as possible.”\r\n\r\n“I am at your command, sir; shall we return together?”\r\n\r\n“If not unpleasant to you.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, I shall feel much pleasure.”\r\n\r\nThus, the future father and son-in-law stepped into the same carriage,\r\nand Morrel, seeing them pass, became uneasy. Villefort and Franz\r\nreturned to the Faubourg Saint-Honoré. The procureur, without going to\r\nsee either his wife or his daughter, went at once to his study, and,\r\noffering the young man a chair:\r\n\r\n“M. d’Épinay,” said he, “allow me to remind you at this moment,—which\r\nis perhaps not so ill-chosen as at first sight may appear, for\r\nobedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which\r\nshould be made at their tomb,—allow me then to remind you of the wish\r\nexpressed by Madame de Saint-Méran on her death-bed, that Valentine’s\r\nwedding might not be deferred. You know the affairs of the deceased are\r\nin perfect order, and her will bequeaths to Valentine the entire\r\nproperty of the Saint-Méran family; the notary showed me the documents\r\nyesterday, which will enable us to draw up the contract immediately.\r\nYou may call on the notary, M. Deschamps, Place Beauveau, Faubourg\r\nSaint-Honoré, and you have my authority to inspect those deeds.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied M. d’Épinay, “it is not, perhaps, the moment for\r\nMademoiselle Valentine, who is in deep distress, to think of a husband;\r\nindeed, I fear——”\r\n\r\n40028m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her\r\ngrandmother’s last injunctions; there will be no obstacle from that\r\nquarter, I assure you.”\r\n\r\n“In that case,” replied Franz, “as I shall raise none, you may make\r\narrangements when you please; I have pledged my word, and shall feel\r\npleasure and happiness in adhering to it.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Villefort, “nothing further is required. The contract was\r\nto have been signed three days since; we shall find it all ready, and\r\ncan sign it today.”\r\n\r\n“But the mourning?” said Franz, hesitating.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be uneasy on that score,” replied Villefort; “no ceremony will\r\nbe neglected in my house. Mademoiselle de Villefort may retire during\r\nthe prescribed three months to her estate of Saint-Méran; I say hers,\r\nfor she inherits it today. There, after a few days, if you like, the\r\ncivil marriage shall be celebrated without pomp or ceremony. Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran wished her daughter should be married there. When that is\r\nover, you, sir, can return to Paris, while your wife passes the time of\r\nher mourning with her mother-in-law.”\r\n\r\n“As you please, sir,” said Franz.\r\n\r\n“Then,” replied M. de Villefort, “have the kindness to wait half an\r\nhour; Valentine shall come down into the drawing-room. I will send for\r\nM. Deschamps; we will read and sign the contract before we separate,\r\nand this evening Madame de Villefort shall accompany Valentine to her\r\nestate, where we will rejoin them in a week.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Franz, “I have one request to make.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“I wish Albert de Morcerf and Raoul de Château-Renaud to be present at\r\nthis signature; you know they are my witnesses.”\r\n\r\n“Half an hour will suffice to apprise them; will you go for them\r\nyourself, or shall you send?”\r\n\r\n“I prefer going, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I shall expect you, then, in half an hour, baron, and Valentine will\r\nbe ready.”\r\n\r\nFranz bowed and left the room. Scarcely had the door closed, when M. de\r\nVillefort sent to tell Valentine to be ready in the drawing-room in\r\nhalf an hour, as he expected the notary and M. d’Épinay and his\r\nwitnesses. The news caused a great sensation throughout the house;\r\nMadame de Villefort would not believe it, and Valentine was\r\nthunderstruck. She looked around for help, and would have gone down to\r\nher grandfather’s room, but on the stairs she met M. de Villefort, who\r\ntook her arm and led her into the drawing-room. In the anteroom,\r\nValentine met Barrois, and looked despairingly at the old servant. A\r\nmoment later, Madame de Villefort entered the drawing-room with her\r\nlittle Edward. It was evident that she had shared the grief of the\r\nfamily, for she was pale and looked fatigued. She sat down, took Edward\r\non her knees, and from time to time pressed this child, on whom her\r\naffections appeared centred, almost convulsively to her bosom.\r\n\r\nTwo carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard. One was the\r\nnotary’s; the other, that of Franz and his friends. In a moment the\r\nwhole party was assembled. Valentine was so pale one might trace the\r\nblue veins from her temples, round her eyes and down her cheeks. Franz\r\nwas deeply affected. Château-Renaud and Albert looked at each other\r\nwith amazement; the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared\r\nmore sorrowful than did that which was about to begin. Madame de\r\nVillefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain, and\r\nas she constantly bent over her child, it was difficult to read the\r\nexpression of her face. M. de Villefort was, as usual, unmoved.\r\n\r\nThe notary, after having, according to the customary method, arranged\r\nthe papers on the table, taken his place in an armchair, and raised his\r\nspectacles, turned towards Franz:\r\n\r\n“Are you M. Franz de Quesnel, baron d’Épinay?” asked he, although he\r\nknew it perfectly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” replied Franz. The notary bowed.\r\n\r\n“I have, then, to inform you, sir, at the request of M. de Villefort,\r\nthat your projected marriage with Mademoiselle de Villefort has changed\r\nthe feeling of M. Noirtier towards his grandchild, and that he\r\ndisinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her. Let me\r\nhasten to add,” continued he, “that the testator, having only the right\r\nto alienate a part of his fortune, and having alienated it all, the\r\nwill will not bear scrutiny, and is declared null and void.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.” said Villefort; “but I warn M. d’Épinay, that during my\r\nlife-time my father’s will shall never be questioned, my position\r\nforbidding any doubt to be entertained.”\r\n\r\n40032m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Franz, “I regret much that such a question has been raised\r\nin the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine; I have never inquired the\r\namount of her fortune, which, however limited it may be, exceeds mine.\r\nMy family has sought consideration in this alliance with M. de\r\nVillefort; all I seek is happiness.”\r\n\r\nValentine imperceptibly thanked him, while two silent tears rolled down\r\nher cheeks.\r\n\r\n“Besides, sir,” said Villefort, addressing himself to his future\r\nson-in-law, “excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes, this\r\nunexpected will need not personally wound you; M. Noirtier’s weakness\r\nof mind sufficiently explains it. It is not because Mademoiselle\r\nValentine is going to marry you that he is angry, but because she will\r\nmarry, a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow.\r\nOld age is selfish, sir, and Mademoiselle de Villefort has been a\r\nfaithful companion to M. Noirtier, which she cannot be when she becomes\r\nthe Baroness d’Épinay. My father’s melancholy state prevents our\r\nspeaking to him on any subjects, which the weakness of his mind would\r\nincapacitate him from understanding, and I am perfectly convinced that\r\nat the present time, although, he knows that his granddaughter is going\r\nto be married, M. Noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended\r\ngrandson.” M. de Villefort had scarcely said this, when the door\r\nopened, and Barrois appeared.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said he, in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking\r\nto his masters under such solemn circumstances,—“gentlemen, M. Noirtier\r\nde Villefort wishes to speak immediately to M. Franz de Quesnel, baron\r\nd’Épinay.” He, as well as the notary, that there might be no mistake in\r\nthe person, gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect.\r\n\r\nVillefort started, Madame de Villefort let her son slip from her knees,\r\nValentine rose, pale and dumb as a statue. Albert and Château-Renaud\r\nexchanged a second look, more full of amazement than the first. The\r\nnotary looked at Villefort.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible,” said the procureur. “M. d’Épinay cannot leave the\r\ndrawing-room at present.”\r\n\r\n“It is at this moment,” replied Barrois with the same firmness, “that\r\nM. Noirtier, my master, wishes to speak on important subjects to M.\r\nFranz d’Épinay.”\r\n\r\n“Grandpapa Noirtier can speak now, then,” said Edward, with his\r\nhabitual quickness. However, his remark did not make Madame de\r\nVillefort even smile, so much was every mind engaged, and so solemn was\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\n“Tell M. Nortier,” resumed Villefort, “that what he demands is\r\nimpossible.”\r\n\r\n“Then, M. Nortier gives notice to these gentlemen,” replied Barrois,\r\n“that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing-room.”\r\n\r\nAstonishment was at its height. Something like a smile was perceptible\r\non Madame de Villefort’s countenance. Valentine instinctively raised\r\nher eyes, as if to thank heaven.\r\n\r\n“Pray go, Valentine,” said; M. de Villefort, “and see what this new\r\nfancy of your grandfather’s is.” Valentine rose quickly, and was\r\nhastening joyfully towards the door, when M. de Villefort altered his\r\nintention.\r\n\r\n“Stop,” said he; “I will go with you.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, sir,” said Franz, “since M. Noirtier sent for me, I am\r\nready to attend to his wish; besides, I shall be happy to pay my\r\nrespects to him, not having yet had the honor of doing so.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, sir,” said Villefort with marked uneasiness, “do not disturb\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n40032m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, sir,” said Franz in a resolute tone. “I would not lose\r\nthis opportunity of proving to M. Noirtier how wrong it would be of him\r\nto encourage feelings of dislike to me, which I am determined to\r\nconquer, whatever they may be, by my devotion.”\r\n\r\nAnd without listening to Villefort he arose, and followed Valentine,\r\nwho was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who\r\nfinds a rock to cling to. M. de Villefort followed them. Château-Renaud\r\nand Morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 75. A Signed Statement\r\n\r\nNoirtier was prepared to receive them, dressed in black, and installed\r\nin his armchair. When the three persons he expected had entered, he\r\nlooked at the door, which his valet immediately closed.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” whispered Villefort to Valentine, who could not conceal her\r\njoy; “if M. Noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay\r\nyour marriage, I forbid you to understand him.”\r\n\r\nValentine blushed, but did not answer. Villefort, approached Noirtier.\r\n\r\n“Here is M. Franz d’Épinay,” said he; “you requested to see him. We\r\nhave all wished for this interview, and I trust it will convince you\r\nhow ill-formed are your objections to Valentine’s marriage.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier answered only by a look which made Villefort’s blood run cold.\r\nHe motioned to Valentine to approach. In a moment, thanks to her habit\r\nof conversing with her grandfather, she understood that he asked for a\r\nkey. Then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the\r\nwindows. She opened the drawer, and found a key; and, understanding\r\nthat was what he wanted, again watched his eyes, which turned toward an\r\nold secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed\r\nto contain nothing but useless documents.\r\n\r\n“Shall I open the secretaire?” asked Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the old man.\r\n\r\n“And the drawers?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Those at the side?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“The middle one?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nValentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers. “Is that what you\r\nwish for?” asked she.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nShe took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was\r\nempty. “But there are no more,” said she. Noirtier’s eye was fixed on\r\nthe dictionary.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I understand, grandfather,” said the young girl.\r\n\r\n40036m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe pointed to each letter of the alphabet. At the letter S the old man\r\nstopped her. She opened, and found the word “secret.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! is there a secret spring?” said Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Noirtier.\r\n\r\n“And who knows it?” Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had\r\ngone out.\r\n\r\n“Barrois?” said she.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I call him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nValentine went to the door, and called Barrois. Villefort’s impatience\r\nduring this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead, and\r\nFranz was stupefied. The old servant came.\r\n\r\n“Barrois,” said Valentine, “my grandfather has told me to open that\r\ndrawer in the secretaire, but there is a secret spring in it, which you\r\nknow—will you open it?”\r\n\r\nBarrois looked at the old man. “Obey,” said Noirtier’s intelligent eye.\r\nBarrois touched a spring, the false bottom came out, and they saw a\r\nbundle of papers tied with a black string.\r\n\r\n“Is that what you wish for?” said Barrois.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I give these papers to M. de Villefort?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“To Mademoiselle Valentine?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“To M. Franz d’Épinay?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nFranz, astonished, advanced a step. “To me, sir?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nFranz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at the cover, read:\r\n\r\n“‘To be given, after my death, to General Durand, who shall bequeath\r\nthe packet to his son, with an injunction to preserve it as containing\r\nan important document.’\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” asked Franz, “what do you wish me to do with this paper?”\r\n\r\n“To preserve it, sealed up as it is, doubtless,” said the procureur.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Noirtier eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Do you wish him to read it?” said Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the old man.\r\n\r\n“You understand, baron, my grandfather wishes you to read this paper,”\r\nsaid Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Then let us sit down,” said Villefort impatiently, “for it will take\r\nsome time.”\r\n\r\n“Sit down,” said the old man. Villefort took a chair, but Valentine\r\nremained standing by her father’s side, and Franz before him, holding\r\nthe mysterious paper in his hand. “Read,” said the old man. Franz\r\nuntied it, and in the midst of the most profound silence read:\r\n\r\n40038m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘_Extract of the report of a meeting of the Bonapartist Club in the\r\nRue Saint-Jacques, held February 5th, 1815_.’”\r\n\r\nFranz stopped. “February 5th, 1815!” said he; “it is the day my father\r\nwas murdered.” Valentine and Villefort were dumb; the eye of the old\r\nman alone seemed to say clearly, “Go on.”\r\n\r\n“But it was on leaving this club,” said he, “my father disappeared.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier’s eye continued to say, “Read.” He resumed:—\r\n\r\n“‘The undersigned Louis-Jacques Beaurepaire, lieutenant-colonel of\r\nartillery, Étienne Duchampy, general of brigade, and Claude Lecharpal,\r\nkeeper of woods and forests, declare, that on the 4th of February, a\r\nletter arrived from the Island of Elba, recommending to the kindness\r\nand the confidence of the Bonapartist Club, General Flavien de Quesnel,\r\nwho having served the emperor from 1804 to 1814 was supposed to be\r\ndevoted to the interests of the Napoleon dynasty, notwithstanding the\r\ntitle of baron which Louis XVIII. had just granted to him with his\r\nestate of Épinay.\r\n\r\n400340m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘A note was in consequence addressed to General de Quesnel, begging\r\nhim to be present at the meeting next day, the 5th. The note indicated\r\nneither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to\r\nbe held; it bore no signature, but it announced to the general that\r\nsomeone would call for him if he would be ready at nine o’clock. The\r\nmeetings were always held from that time till midnight. At nine o’clock\r\nthe president of the club presented himself; the general was ready, the\r\npresident informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction\r\nwas that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting, and\r\nthat he would allow his eyes to be bandaged, swearing that he would not\r\nendeavor to take off the bandage. General de Quesnel accepted the\r\ncondition, and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road\r\nthey took. The general’s carriage was ready, but the president told him\r\nit was impossible for him to use it, since it was useless to blindfold\r\nthe master if the coachman knew through what streets he went. “What\r\nmust be done then?” asked the general.—“I have my carriage here,” said\r\nthe president.\r\n\r\n“‘“Have you, then, so much confidence in your servant that you can\r\nintrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know?”\r\n\r\n“‘“Our coachman is a member of the club,” said the president; “we shall\r\nbe driven by a State-Councillor.”\r\n\r\n“‘“Then we run another risk,” said the general, laughing, “that of\r\nbeing upset.” We insert this joke to prove that the general was not in\r\nthe least compelled to attend the meeting, but that he came willingly.\r\nWhen they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the\r\ngeneral of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged, to which he\r\nmade no opposition. On the road the president thought he saw the\r\ngeneral make an attempt to remove the handkerchief, and reminded him of\r\nhis oath. “Sure enough,” said the general. The carriage stopped at an\r\nalley leading out of the Rue Saint-Jacques. The general alighted,\r\nleaning on the arm of the president, of whose dignity he was not aware,\r\nconsidering him simply as a member of the club; they went through the\r\nalley, mounted a flight of stairs, and entered the assembly-room.\r\n\r\n“‘The deliberations had already begun. The members, apprised of the\r\nsort of presentation which was to be made that evening, were all in\r\nattendance. When in the middle of the room the general was invited to\r\nremove his bandage, he did so immediately, and was surprised to see so\r\nmany well-known faces in a society of whose existence he had till then\r\nbeen ignorant. They questioned him as to his sentiments, but he\r\ncontented himself with answering, that the letters from the Island of\r\nElba ought to have informed them——’”\r\n\r\nFranz interrupted himself by saying, “My father was a royalist; they\r\nneed not have asked his sentiments, which were well known.”\r\n\r\n“And hence,” said Villefort, “arose my affection for your father, my\r\ndear M. Franz. Opinions held in common are a ready bond of union.”\r\n\r\n“Read again,” said the old man.\r\n\r\nFranz continued:\r\n\r\n“‘The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly, but M.\r\nde Quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with\r\nhim. He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island\r\nof Elba, in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be\r\nlikely to advance the interests of their party. One paragraph spoke of\r\nthe return of Bonaparte and promised another letter and further\r\ndetails, on the arrival of the _Pharaon_ belonging to the shipbuilder\r\nMorrel, of Marseilles, whose captain was entirely devoted to the\r\nemperor. During all this time, the general, on whom they thought to\r\nhave relied as on a brother, manifested evidently signs of discontent\r\nand repugnance. When the reading was finished, he remained silent, with\r\nknitted brows.\r\n\r\n“‘“Well,” asked the president, “what do you say to this letter,\r\ngeneral?”\r\n\r\n“‘“I say that it is too soon after declaring myself for Louis XVIII. to\r\nbreak my vow in behalf of the ex-emperor.” This answer was too clear to\r\npermit of any mistake as to his sentiments. “General,” said the\r\npresident, “we acknowledge no King Louis XVIII., or an ex-emperor, but\r\nhis majesty the emperor and king, driven from France, which is his\r\nkingdom, by violence and treason.”\r\n\r\n“‘“Excuse me, gentlemen,” said the general; “you may not acknowledge\r\nLouis XVIII., but I do, as he has made me a baron and a field-marshal,\r\nand I shall never forget that for these two titles I am indebted to his\r\nhappy return to France.”\r\n\r\n“‘“Sir,” said the president, rising with gravity, “be careful what you\r\nsay; your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you\r\nin the Island of Elba, and have deceived us! The communication has been\r\nmade to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you, and which\r\ndoes you honor. Now we discover our error; a title and promotion attach\r\nyou to the government we wish to overturn. We will not constrain you to\r\nhelp us; we enroll no one against his conscience, but we will compel\r\nyou to act generously, even if you are not disposed to do so.”\r\n\r\n“‘“You would call acting generously, knowing your conspiracy and not\r\ninforming against you, that is what I should call becoming your\r\naccomplice. You see I am more candid than you.”’”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my father!” said Franz, interrupting himself. “I understand now\r\nwhy they murdered him.” Valentine could not help casting one glance\r\ntowards the young man, whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to\r\nbehold. Villefort walked to and fro behind them. Noirtier watched the\r\nexpression of each one, and preserved his dignified and commanding\r\nattitude. Franz returned to the manuscript, and continued:\r\n\r\n“‘“Sir,” said the president, “you have been invited to join this\r\nassembly—you were not forced here; it was proposed to you to come\r\nblindfolded—you accepted. When you complied with this twofold request\r\nyou well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of Louis XVIII., or\r\nwe should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police.\r\nIt would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you\r\nin the discovery of our secret, and then to remove it that you may ruin\r\nthose who have confided in you. No, no, you must first say if you\r\ndeclare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns, or for his\r\nmajesty the emperor.”\r\n\r\n“‘“I am a royalist,” replied the general; “I have taken the oath of\r\nallegiance to Louis XVIII., and I will adhere to it.” These words were\r\nfollowed by a general murmur, and it was evident that several of the\r\nmembers were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of\r\nhis rashness.\r\n\r\n“‘The president again arose, and having imposed silence, said,—“Sir,\r\nyou are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the\r\nconsequences of our present situation, and your candor has already\r\ndictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you.” The\r\ngeneral, putting his hand on his sword, exclaimed,—“If you talk of\r\nhonor, do not begin by disavowing its laws, and impose nothing by\r\nviolence.”\r\n\r\n“‘“And you, sir,” continued the president, with a calmness still more\r\nterrible than the general’s anger, “I advise you not to touch your\r\nsword.” The general looked around him with slight uneasiness; however\r\nhe did not yield, but calling up all his fortitude, said,—“I will not\r\nswear.”\r\n\r\n“‘“Then you must die,” replied the president calmly. M. d’Épinay became\r\nvery pale; he looked round him a second time, several members of the\r\nclub were whispering, and getting their arms from under their cloaks.\r\n“General,” said the president, “do not alarm yourself; you are among\r\nmen of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting\r\nto the last extremity, but as you have said, you are among\r\nconspirators, you are in possession of our secret, and you must restore\r\nit to us.” A significant silence followed these words, and as the\r\ngeneral did not reply,—“Close the doors,” said the president to the\r\ndoor-keeper.\r\n\r\n40042m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘The same deadly silence succeeded these words. Then the general\r\nadvanced, and making a violent effort to control his feelings,—“I have\r\na son,” said he, “and I ought to think of him, finding myself among\r\nassassins.”\r\n\r\n“‘“General,” said the chief of the assembly, “one man may insult\r\nfifty—it is the privilege of weakness. But he does wrong to use his\r\nprivilege. Follow my advice, swear, and do not insult.” The general,\r\nagain daunted by the superiority of the chief, hesitated a moment; then\r\nadvancing to the president’s desk,—“What is the form, said he.\r\n\r\n“‘“It is this:—‘I swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what I have\r\nseen and heard on the 5th of February, 1815, between nine and ten\r\no’clock in the evening; and I plead guilty of death should I ever\r\nviolate this oath.’” The general appeared to be affected by a nervous\r\ntremor, which prevented his answering for some moments; then,\r\novercoming his manifest repugnance, he pronounced the required oath,\r\nbut in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the\r\nmembers, who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly, which\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\n“‘“Now am I at liberty to retire?” said the general. The president\r\nrose, appointed three members to accompany him, and got into the\r\ncarriage with the general after bandaging his eyes. One of those three\r\nmembers was the coachman who had driven them there. The other members\r\nsilently dispersed. “Where do you wish to be taken?” asked the\r\npresident.—“Anywhere out of your presence,” replied M. d’Épinay.\r\n“Beware, sir,” replied the president, “you are no longer in the\r\nassembly, and have only to do with individuals; do not insult them\r\nunless you wish to be held responsible.” But instead of listening, M.\r\nd’Épinay went on,—“You are still as brave in your carriage as in your\r\nassembly because you are still four against one.” The president stopped\r\nthe coach. They were at that part of the Quai des Ormes where the steps\r\nlead down to the river. “Why do you stop here?” asked d’Épinay.\r\n\r\n“‘“Because, sir,” said the president, “you have insulted a man, and\r\nthat man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable\r\nreparation.”\r\n\r\n“‘“Another method of assassination?” said the general, shrugging his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n“‘“Make no noise, sir, unless you wish me to consider you as one of the\r\nmen of whom you spoke just now as cowards, who take their weakness for\r\na shield. You are alone, one alone shall answer you; you have a sword\r\nby your side, I have one in my cane; you have no witness, one of these\r\ngentlemen will serve you. Now, if you please, remove your bandage.” The\r\ngeneral tore the handkerchief from his eyes. “At last,” said he, “I\r\nshall know with whom I have to do.” They opened the door and the four\r\nmen alighted.’”\r\n\r\nFranz again interrupted himself, and wiped the cold drops from his\r\nbrow; there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in\r\ntrembling pallor these details of his father’s death, which had\r\nhitherto been a mystery. Valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer.\r\nNoirtier looked at Villefort with an almost sublime expression of\r\ncontempt and pride.\r\n\r\nFranz continued:\r\n\r\n“‘It was, as we said, the fifth of February. For three days the mercury\r\nhad been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered\r\nwith ice. The general was stout and tall, the president offered him the\r\nside of the railing to assist him in getting down. The two witnesses\r\nfollowed. It was a dark night. The ground from the steps to the river\r\nwas covered with snow and hoarfrost, the water of the river looked\r\nblack and deep. One of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal-barge\r\nnear, and by its light they examined the weapons. The president’s\r\nsword, which was simply, as he had said, one he carried in his cane,\r\nwas five inches shorter than the general’s, and had no guard. The\r\ngeneral proposed to cast lots for the swords, but the president said it\r\nwas he who had given the provocation, and when he had given it he had\r\nsupposed each would use his own arms. The witnesses endeavored to\r\ninsist, but the president bade them be silent. The lantern was placed\r\non the ground, the two adversaries took their stations, and the duel\r\nbegan. The light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning;\r\nas for the men, they were scarcely perceptible, the darkness was so\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n40044m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘General d’Épinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army,\r\nbut he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and\r\nfell. The witnesses thought he was dead, but his adversary, who knew he\r\nhad not struck him, offered him the assistance of his hand to rise. The\r\ncircumstance irritated instead of calming the general, and he rushed on\r\nhis adversary. But his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken.\r\nHe received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on\r\nfinding himself too closely engaged, and then returned to the charge.\r\nAt the third he fell again. They thought he slipped, as at first, and\r\nthe witnesses, seeing he did not move, approached and endeavored to\r\nraise him, but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was\r\nmoistened with blood. The general, who had almost fainted, revived.\r\n“Ah,” said he, “they have sent some fencing-master to fight with me.”\r\nThe president, without answering, approached the witness who held the\r\nlantern, and raising his sleeve, showed him two wounds he had received\r\nin his arm; then opening his coat, and unbuttoning his waistcoat,\r\ndisplayed his side, pierced with a third wound. Still he had not even\r\nuttered a sigh. General d’Épinay died five minutes after.’”\r\n\r\nFranz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly\r\naudible, and then stopped, passing his hand over his eyes as if to\r\ndispel a cloud; but after a moment’s silence, he continued:\r\n\r\n“‘The president went up the steps, after pushing his sword into his\r\ncane; a track of blood on the snow marked his course. He had scarcely\r\narrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the water—it was the\r\ngeneral’s body, which the witnesses had just thrown into the river\r\nafter ascertaining that he was dead. The general fell, then, in a loyal\r\nduel, and not in ambush as it might have been reported. In proof of\r\nthis we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts,\r\nlest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this\r\nterrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of\r\ninfringement of the laws of honor.\r\n\r\n“‘Signed, Beaurepaire, Duchampy, and Lecharpal.’”\r\n\r\nWhen Franz had finished reading this account, so dreadful for a son;\r\nwhen Valentine, pale with emotion, had wiped away a tear; when\r\nVillefort, trembling, and crouched in a corner, had endeavored to\r\nlessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man,—\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said d’Épinay to Noirtier, “since you are well acquainted with\r\nall these details, which are attested by honorable signatures,—since\r\nyou appear to take some interest in me, although you have only\r\nmanifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow, refuse me not one final\r\nsatisfaction—tell me the name of the president of the club, that I may\r\nat least know who killed my father.”\r\n\r\nVillefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door; Valentine, who\r\nunderstood sooner than anyone her grandfather’s answer, and who had\r\noften seen two scars upon his right arm, drew back a few steps.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” said Franz, turning towards Valentine, “unite your\r\nefforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan\r\nat two years of age.” Valentine remained dumb and motionless.\r\n\r\n“Hold, sir,” said Villefort, “do not prolong this dreadful scene. The\r\nnames have been purposely concealed; my father himself does not know\r\nwho this president was, and if he knows, he cannot tell you; proper\r\nnames are not in the dictionary.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, misery,” cried Franz: “the only hope which sustained me and\r\nenabled me to read to the end was that of knowing, at least, the name\r\nof him who killed my father! Sir, sir,” cried he, turning to Noirtier,\r\n“do what you can—make me understand in some way!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Noirtier.\r\n\r\n“Oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle!” cried Franz, “your grandfather says\r\nhe can indicate the person. Help me,—lend me your assistance!”\r\n\r\nNoirtier looked at the dictionary. Franz took it with a nervous\r\ntrembling, and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively, until\r\nhe came to M. At that letter the old man signified “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“M,” repeated Franz. The young man’s finger, glided over the words, but\r\nat each one Noirtier answered by a negative sign. Valentine hid her\r\nhead between her hands. At length, Franz arrived at the word MYSELF.\r\n\r\n40046m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes!”\r\n\r\n“You!” cried Franz, whose hair stood on end; “you, M. Noirtier—you\r\nkilled my father?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” replied Noirtier, fixing a majestic look on the young man. Franz\r\nfell powerless on a chair; Villefort opened the door and escaped, for\r\nthe idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in\r\nthe heart of this terrible old man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 76. Progress of Cavalcanti the Younger\r\n\r\nMeanwhile M. Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service, not in\r\nthe army of his majesty the Emperor of Austria, but at the gaming-table\r\nof the baths of Lucca, of which he was one of the most assiduous\r\ncourtiers. He had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his\r\njourney as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had\r\nmaintained his assumed character of father.\r\n\r\nM. Andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that\r\nhe had indeed the honor of being the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and\r\nthe Marchioness Oliva Corsinari. He was now fairly launched in that\r\nParisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners, and\r\ntreats them, not as they really are, but as they wish to be considered.\r\nBesides, what is required of a young man in Paris? To speak its\r\nlanguage tolerably, to make a good appearance, to be a good gamester,\r\nand to pay in cash. They are certainly less particular with a foreigner\r\nthan with a Frenchman. Andrea had, then, in a fortnight, attained a\r\nvery fair position. He was called count, he was said to possess 50,000\r\nlivres per annum; and his father’s immense riches, buried in the\r\nquarries of Saravezza, were a constant theme. A learned man, before\r\nwhom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact, declared he had\r\nseen the quarries in question, which gave great weight to assertions\r\nhitherto somewhat doubtful, but which now assumed the garb of reality.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of society in Paris at the period we bring before\r\nour readers, when Monte Cristo went one evening to pay M. Danglars a\r\nvisit. M. Danglars was out, but the count was asked to go and see the\r\nbaroness, and he accepted the invitation. It was never without a\r\nnervous shudder, since the dinner at Auteuil, and the events which\r\nfollowed it, that Madame Danglars heard Monte Cristo’s name announced.\r\nIf he did not come, the painful sensation became most intense; if, on\r\nthe contrary, he appeared, his noble countenance, his brilliant eyes,\r\nhis amiability, his polite attention even towards Madame Danglars, soon\r\ndispelled every impression of fear. It appeared impossible to the\r\nbaroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should\r\nentertain evil designs against her; besides, the most corrupt minds\r\nonly suspect evil when it would answer some interested end—useless\r\ninjury is repugnant to every mind.\r\n\r\n40048m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Monte Cristo entered the boudoir, to which we have already once\r\nintroduced our readers, and where the baroness was examining some\r\ndrawings, which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them\r\nwith M. Cavalcanti, his presence soon produced its usual effect, and it\r\nwas with smiles that the baroness received the count, although she had\r\nbeen a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name. The latter\r\ntook in the whole scene at a glance.\r\n\r\nThe baroness was partially reclining on a sofa, Eugénie sat near her,\r\nand Cavalcanti was standing. Cavalcanti, dressed in black, like one of\r\nGoethe’s heroes, with varnished shoes and white silk open-worked\r\nstockings, passed a white and tolerably nice-looking hand through his\r\nlight hair, and so displayed a sparkling diamond, that in spite of\r\nMonte Cristo’s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist\r\nputting on his little finger. This movement was accompanied by killing\r\nglances at Mademoiselle Danglars, and by sighs launched in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Danglars was still the same—cold, beautiful, and\r\nsatirical. Not one of these glances, nor one sigh, was lost on her;\r\nthey might have been said to fall on the shield of Minerva, which some\r\nphilosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of Sappho. Eugénie\r\nbowed coldly to the count, and availed herself of the first moment when\r\nthe conversation became earnest to escape to her study, whence very\r\nsoon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with\r\noccasional notes of the piano assured Monte Cristo that Mademoiselle\r\nDanglars preferred to his society and to that of M. Cavalcanti the\r\ncompany of Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly, her singing teacher.\r\n\r\nIt was then, especially while conversing with Madame Danglars, and\r\napparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation, that the count\r\nnoticed M. Andrea Cavalcanti’s solicitude, his manner of listening to\r\nthe music at the door he dared not pass, and of manifesting his\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nThe banker soon returned. His first look was certainly directed towards\r\nMonte Cristo, but the second was for Andrea. As for his wife, he bowed\r\nto her, as some husbands do to their wives, but in a way that bachelors\r\nwill never comprehend, until a very extensive code is published on\r\nconjugal life.\r\n\r\n“Have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano?” said\r\nDanglars to Andrea.\r\n\r\n“Alas, no, sir,” replied Andrea with a sigh, still more remarkable than\r\nthe former ones. Danglars immediately advanced towards the door and\r\nopened it.\r\n\r\n40050m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair, at the piano,\r\naccompanying themselves, each with one hand, a fancy to which they had\r\naccustomed themselves, and performed admirably. Mademoiselle d’Armilly,\r\nwhom they then perceived through the open doorway, formed with Eugénie\r\none of the _tableaux vivants_ of which the Germans are so fond. She was\r\nsomewhat beautiful, and exquisitely formed—a little fairy-like figure,\r\nwith large curls falling on her neck, which was rather too long, as\r\nPerugino sometimes makes his Virgins, and her eyes dull from fatigue.\r\nShe was said to have a weak chest, and like Antonia in the _Cremona\r\nViolin_, she would die one day while singing.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum; it\r\nwas the first time he had ever seen Mademoiselle d’Armilly, of whom he\r\nhad heard much.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the banker to his daughter, “are we then all to be\r\nexcluded?”\r\n\r\nHe then led the young man into the study, and either by chance or\r\nmanœuvre the door was partially closed after Andrea, so that from the\r\nplace where they sat neither the Count nor the baroness could see\r\nanything; but as the banker had accompanied Andrea, Madame Danglars\r\nappeared to take no notice of it.\r\n\r\nThe count soon heard Andrea’s voice, singing a Corsican song,\r\naccompanied by the piano. While the count smiled at hearing this song,\r\nwhich made him lose sight of Andrea in the recollection of Benedetto,\r\nMadame Danglars was boasting to Monte Cristo of her husband’s strength\r\nof mind, who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand\r\nfrancs by a failure at Milan. The praise was well deserved, for had not\r\nthe count heard it from the baroness, or by one of those means by which\r\nhe knew everything, the baron’s countenance would not have led him to\r\nsuspect it.\r\n\r\n“Hem,” thought Monte Cristo, “he begins to conceal his losses; a month\r\nsince he boasted of them.”\r\n\r\nThen aloud,—“Oh, madame, M. Danglars is so skilful, he will soon regain\r\nat the Bourse what he loses elsewhere.”\r\n\r\n“I see that you participate in a prevalent error,” said Madame\r\nDanglars.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“That M. Danglars speculates, whereas he never does.”\r\n\r\n“Truly, madame, I recollect M. Debray told me——apropos, what has become\r\nof him? I have seen nothing of him the last three or four days.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I,” said Madame Danglars; “but you began a sentence, sir, and did\r\nnot finish.”\r\n\r\n“Which?”\r\n\r\n“M. Debray had told you——”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes; he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of\r\nspeculation.”\r\n\r\n“I was once very fond of it, but I do not indulge now.”\r\n\r\n“Then you are wrong, madame. Fortune is precarious; and if I were a\r\nwoman and fate had made me a banker’s wife, whatever might be my\r\nconfidence in my husband’s good fortune, still in speculation you know\r\nthere is great risk. Well, I would secure for myself a fortune\r\nindependent of him, even if I acquired it by placing my interests in\r\nhands unknown to him.” Madame Danglars blushed, in spite of all her\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n“Stay,” said Monte Cristo, as though he had not observed her confusion,\r\n“I have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the Neapolitan\r\nbonds.”\r\n\r\n“I have none—nor have I ever possessed any; but really we have talked\r\nlong enough of money, count, we are like two stockbrokers; have you\r\nheard how fate is persecuting the poor Villeforts?”\r\n\r\n“What has happened?” said the count, simulating total ignorance.\r\n\r\n“You know the Marquis of Saint-Méran died a few days after he had set\r\nout on his journey to Paris, and the marchioness a few days after her\r\narrival?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Monte Cristo, “I have heard that; but, as Claudius said to\r\nHamlet, ‘it is a law of nature; their fathers died before them, and\r\nthey mourned their loss; they will die before their children, who will,\r\nin their turn, grieve for them.’”\r\n\r\n“But that is not all.”\r\n\r\n“Not all!”\r\n\r\n“No; they were going to marry their daughter——”\r\n\r\n“To M. Franz d’Épinay. Is it broken off?”\r\n\r\n“Yesterday morning, it appears, Franz declined the honor.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? And is the reason known?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“How extraordinary! And how does M. de Villefort bear it?”\r\n\r\n“As usual. Like a philosopher.”\r\n\r\nDanglars returned at this moment alone.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the baroness, “do you leave M. Cavalcanti with your\r\ndaughter?”\r\n\r\n“And Mademoiselle d’Armilly,” said the banker; “do you consider her no\r\none?” Then, turning to Monte Cristo, he said, “Prince Cavalcanti is a\r\ncharming young man, is he not? But is he really a prince?”\r\n\r\n“I will not answer for it,” said Monte Cristo. “His father was\r\nintroduced to me as a marquis, so he ought to be a count; but I do not\r\nthink he has much claim to that title.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” said the banker. “If he is a prince, he is wrong not to maintain\r\nhis rank; I do not like anyone to deny his origin.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are a thorough democrat,” said Monte Cristo, smiling.\r\n\r\n“But do you see to what you are exposing yourself?” said the baroness.\r\n“If, perchance, M. de Morcerf came, he would find M. Cavalcanti in that\r\nroom, where he, the betrothed of Eugénie, has never been admitted.”\r\n\r\n“You may well say, perchance,” replied the banker; “for he comes so\r\nseldom, it would seem only chance that brings him.”\r\n\r\n“But should he come and find that young man with your daughter, he\r\nmight be displeased.”\r\n\r\n“He? You are mistaken. M. Albert would not do us the honor to be\r\njealous; he does not like Eugénie sufficiently. Besides, I care not for\r\nhis displeasure.”\r\n\r\n“Still, situated as we are——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, do you know how we are situated? At his mother’s ball he danced\r\nonce with Eugénie, and M. Cavalcanti three times, and he took no notice\r\nof it.”\r\n\r\nThe valet announced the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf. The baroness rose\r\nhastily, and was going into the study, when Danglars stopped her.\r\n\r\n“Let her alone,” said he.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him in amazement. Monte Cristo appeared to be unconscious\r\nof what passed. Albert entered, looking very handsome and in high\r\nspirits. He bowed politely to the baroness, familiarly to Danglars, and\r\naffectionately to Monte Cristo. Then turning to the baroness: “May I\r\nask how Mademoiselle Danglars is?” said he.\r\n\r\n“She is quite well,” replied Danglars quickly; “she is at the piano\r\nwith M. Cavalcanti.”\r\n\r\nAlbert retained his calm and indifferent manner; he might feel perhaps\r\nannoyed, but he knew Monte Cristo’s eye was on him. “M. Cavalcanti has\r\na fine tenor voice,” said he, “and Mademoiselle Eugénie a splendid\r\nsoprano, and then she plays the piano like Thalberg. The concert must\r\nbe a delightful one.”\r\n\r\n“They suit each other remarkably well,” said Danglars. Albert appeared\r\nnot to notice this remark, which was, however, so rude that Madame\r\nDanglars blushed.\r\n\r\n“I, too,” said the young man, “am a musician—at least, my masters used\r\nto tell me so; but it is strange that my voice never would suit any\r\nother, and a soprano less than any.”\r\n\r\nDanglars smiled, and seemed to say, “It is of no consequence.” Then,\r\nhoping doubtless to effect his purpose, he said,—“The prince and my\r\ndaughter were universally admired yesterday. You were not of the party,\r\nM. de Morcerf?”\r\n\r\n“What prince?” asked Albert.\r\n\r\n“Prince Cavalcanti,” said Danglars, who persisted in giving the young\r\nman that title.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” said Albert, “I was not aware that he was a prince. And\r\nPrince Cavalcanti sang with Mademoiselle Eugénie yesterday? It must\r\nhave been charming, indeed. I regret not having heard them. But I was\r\nunable to accept your invitation, having promised to accompany my\r\nmother to a German concert given by the Baroness of Château-Renaud.”\r\n\r\nThis was followed by rather an awkward silence.\r\n\r\n“May I also be allowed,” said Morcerf, “to pay my respects to\r\nMademoiselle Danglars?”\r\n\r\n“Wait a moment,” said the banker, stopping the young man; “do you hear\r\nthat delightful cavatina? Ta, ta, ta, ti, ta, ti, ta, ta; it is\r\ncharming, let them finish—one moment. Bravo, bravi, brava!” The banker\r\nwas enthusiastic in his applause.\r\n\r\n40054m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said Albert, “it is exquisite; it is impossible to understand\r\nthe music of his country better than Prince Cavalcanti does. You said\r\nprince, did you not? But he can easily become one, if he is not\r\nalready; it is no uncommon thing in Italy. But to return to the\r\ncharming musicians—you should give us a treat, Danglars, without\r\ntelling them there is a stranger. Ask them to sing one more song; it is\r\nso delightful to hear music in the distance, when the musicians are\r\nunrestrained by observation.”\r\n\r\nDanglars was quite annoyed by the young man’s indifference. He took\r\nMonte Cristo aside.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of our lover?” said he.\r\n\r\n“He appears cool. But, then your word is given.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, doubtless I have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves\r\nher, but not to one who does not. See him there, cold as marble and\r\nproud like his father. If he were rich, if he had Cavalcanti’s fortune,\r\nthat might be pardoned. _Ma foi_, I haven’t consulted my daughter; but\r\nif she has good taste——”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Monte Cristo, “my fondness may blind me, but I assure you I\r\nconsider Morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter\r\nhappy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction,\r\nand his father’s position is good.”\r\n\r\n“Hem,” said Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Why do you doubt?”\r\n\r\n“The past—that obscurity on the past.”\r\n\r\n“But that does not affect the son.”\r\n\r\n“Very true.”\r\n\r\n“Now, I beg of you, don’t go off your head. It’s a month now that you\r\nhave been thinking of this marriage, and you must see that it throws\r\nsome responsibility on me, for it was at my house you met this young\r\nCavalcanti, whom I do not really know at all.”\r\n\r\n“But I do.”\r\n\r\n“Have you made inquiry?”\r\n\r\n“Is there any need of that! Does not his appearance speak for him? And\r\nhe is very rich.”\r\n\r\n“I am not so sure of that.”\r\n\r\n“And yet you said he had money.”\r\n\r\n“Fifty thousand livres—a mere trifle.”\r\n\r\n“He is well educated.”\r\n\r\n“Hem,” said Monte Cristo in his turn.\r\n\r\n“He is a musician.”\r\n\r\n“So are all Italians.”\r\n\r\n“Come, count, you do not do that young man justice.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I acknowledge it annoys me, knowing your connection with the\r\nMorcerf family, to see him throw himself in the way.” Danglars burst\r\nout laughing.\r\n\r\n“What a Puritan you are!” said he; “that happens every day.”\r\n\r\n“But you cannot break it off in this way; the Morcerfs are depending on\r\nthis union.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed.”\r\n\r\n“Positively.”\r\n\r\n“Then let them explain themselves; you should give the father a hint,\r\nyou are so intimate with the family.”\r\n\r\n“I?—where the devil did you find out that?”\r\n\r\n“At their ball; it was apparent enough. Why, did not the countess, the\r\nproud Mercédès, the disdainful Catalane, who will scarcely open her\r\nlips to her oldest acquaintances, take your arm, lead you into the\r\ngarden, into the private walks, and remain there for half an hour?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, baron, baron,” said Albert, “you are not listening—what barbarism\r\nin a megalomaniac like you!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t worry about me, Sir Mocker,” said Danglars; then turning to\r\nMonte Cristo he said:\r\n\r\n“But will you undertake to speak to the father?”\r\n\r\n“Willingly, if you wish it.”\r\n\r\n“But let it be done explicitly and positively. If he demands my\r\ndaughter let him fix the day—declare his conditions; in short, let us\r\neither understand each other, or quarrel. You understand—no more\r\ndelay.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, I will give my attention to the subject.”\r\n\r\n“I do not say that I await with pleasure his decision, but I do await\r\nit. A banker must, you know, be a slave to his promise.” And Danglars\r\nsighed as M. Cavalcanti had done half an hour before.\r\n\r\n“Bravi! bravo! brava!” cried Morcerf, parodying the banker, as the\r\nselection came to an end. Danglars began to look suspiciously at\r\nMorcerf, when someone came and whispered a few words to him.\r\n\r\n“I shall soon return,” said the banker to Monte Cristo; “wait for me. I\r\nshall, perhaps, have something to say to you.” And he went out.\r\n\r\nThe baroness took advantage of her husband’s absence to push open the\r\ndoor of her daughter’s study, and M. Andrea, who was sitting before the\r\npiano with Mademoiselle Eugénie, started up like a jack-in-the-box.\r\nAlbert bowed with a smile to Mademoiselle Danglars, who did not appear\r\nin the least disturbed, and returned his bow with her usual coolness.\r\nCavalcanti was evidently embarrassed; he bowed to Morcerf, who replied\r\nwith the most impertinent look possible. Then Albert launched out in\r\npraise of Mademoiselle Danglars’ voice, and on his regret, after what\r\nhe had just heard, that he had been unable to be present the previous\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nCavalcanti, being left alone, turned to Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Madame Danglars, “leave music and compliments, and let us\r\ngo and take tea.”\r\n\r\n“Come, Louise,” said Mademoiselle Danglars to her friend.\r\n\r\nThey passed into the next drawing-room, where tea was prepared. Just as\r\nthey were beginning, in the English fashion, to leave the spoons in\r\ntheir cups, the door again opened and Danglars entered, visibly\r\nagitated. Monte Cristo observed it particularly, and by a look asked\r\nthe banker for an explanation.\r\n\r\n“I have just received my courier from Greece,” said Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” said the count; “that was the reason of your running away\r\nfrom us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“How is King Otho getting on?” asked Albert in the most sprightly tone.\r\n\r\nDanglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering,\r\nand Monte Cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which\r\npassed over his features, but which was gone in a moment.\r\n\r\n“We shall go together, shall we not?” said Albert to the count.\r\n\r\n“If you like,” replied the latter.\r\n\r\nAlbert could not understand the banker’s look, and turning to Monte\r\nCristo, who understood it perfectly,—“Did you see,” said he, “how he\r\nlooked at me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the count; “but did you think there was anything particular\r\nin his look?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I did; and what does he mean by his news from Greece?”\r\n\r\n“How can I tell you?”\r\n\r\n“Because I imagine you have correspondents in that country.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo smiled significantly.\r\n\r\n“Stop,” said Albert, “here he comes. I shall compliment Mademoiselle\r\nDanglars on her cameo, while the father talks to you.”\r\n\r\n“If you compliment her at all, let it be on her voice, at least,” said\r\nMonte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“No, everyone would do that.”\r\n\r\n“My dear viscount, you are dreadfully impertinent.”\r\n\r\nAlbert advanced towards Eugénie, smiling.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Danglars, stooping to Monte Cristo’s ear, “Your advice was\r\nexcellent,” said he; “there is a whole history connected with the names\r\nFernand and Yanina.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will tell you all; but take away the young man; I cannot endure\r\nhis presence.”\r\n\r\n“He is going with me. Shall I send the father to you?”\r\n\r\n“Immediately.”\r\n\r\n“Very well.” The count made a sign to Albert and they bowed to the\r\nladies, and took their leave, Albert perfectly indifferent to\r\nMademoiselle Danglars’ contempt, Monte Cristo reiterating his advice to\r\nMadame Danglars on the prudence a banker’s wife should exercise in\r\nproviding for the future.\r\n\r\nM. Cavalcanti remained master of the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 77. Haydée\r\n\r\nScarcely had the count’s horses cleared the angle of the boulevard,\r\nwhen Albert, turning towards the count, burst into a loud fit of\r\nlaughter—much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather\r\nforced and unnatural.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “I will ask you the same question which Charles IX.\r\nput to Catherine de’ Medici, after the massacre of Saint Bartholomew:\r\n‘How have I played my little part?’”\r\n\r\n“To what do you allude?” asked Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“To the installation of my rival at M. Danglars’.”\r\n\r\n“What rival?”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_ what rival? Why, your protégé, M. Andrea Cavalcanti!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, no joking, viscount, if you please; I do not patronize M.\r\nAndrea—at least, not as concerns M. Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“And you would be to blame for not assisting him, if the young man\r\nreally needed your help in that quarter, but, happily for me, he can\r\ndispense with it.”\r\n\r\n“What, do you think he is paying his addresses?”\r\n\r\n“I am certain of it; his languishing looks and modulated tones when\r\naddressing Mademoiselle Danglars fully proclaim his intentions. He\r\naspires to the hand of the proud Eugénie.”\r\n\r\n“What does that signify, so long as they favor your suit?”\r\n\r\n“But it is not the case, my dear count: on the contrary. I am repulsed\r\non all sides.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“It is so indeed; Mademoiselle Eugénie scarcely answers me, and\r\nMademoiselle d’Armilly, her confidant, does not speak to me at all.”\r\n\r\n“But the father has the greatest regard possible for you,” said Monte\r\nCristo.\r\n\r\n“He? Oh, no, he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart,\r\ntragedy-weapons, I own, which instead of wounding sheathe their points\r\nin their own handles, but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be\r\nreal and deadly.”\r\n\r\n“Jealousy indicates affection.”\r\n\r\n“True; but I am not jealous.”\r\n\r\n“He is.”\r\n\r\n“Of whom?—of Debray?”\r\n\r\n“No, of you.”\r\n\r\n“Of me? I will engage to say that before a week is past the door will\r\nbe closed against me.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, my dear viscount.”\r\n\r\n“Prove it to me.”\r\n\r\n“Do you wish me to do so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the\r\nComte de Morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron.”\r\n\r\n“By whom are you charged?”\r\n\r\n“By the baron himself.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable. “You\r\nsurely will not do that, my dear count?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I shall, Albert, as I have promised to do it.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Albert, with a sigh, “it seems you are determined to marry\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“I am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody, at all\r\nevents,” said Monte Cristo. “But apropos of Debray, how is it that I\r\nhave not seen him lately at the baron’s house?”\r\n\r\n“There has been a misunderstanding.”\r\n\r\n“What, with the baroness?”\r\n\r\n“No, with the baron.”\r\n\r\n“Has he perceived anything?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that is a good joke!”\r\n\r\n“Do you think he suspects?” said Monte Cristo with charming\r\nartlessness.\r\n\r\n“Where have you come from, my dear count?” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“From Congo, if you will.”\r\n\r\n“It must be farther off than even that.”\r\n\r\n“But what do I know of your Parisian husbands?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear count, husbands are pretty much the same everywhere; an\r\nindividual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the\r\nwhole race.”\r\n\r\n“But then, what can have led to the quarrel between Danglars and\r\nDebray? They seemed to understand each other so well,” said Monte\r\nCristo with renewed energy.\r\n\r\n“Ah, now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of Isis, in\r\nwhich I am not initiated. When M. Andrea Cavalcanti has become one of\r\nthe family, you can ask him that question.”\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped.\r\n\r\n“Here we are,” said Monte Cristo; “it is only half-past ten o’clock,\r\ncome in.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, I will.”\r\n\r\n“My carriage shall take you back.”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you; I gave orders for my _coupé_ to follow me.”\r\n\r\n“There it is, then,” said Monte Cristo, as he stepped out of the\r\ncarriage. They both went into the house; the drawing-room was lighted\r\nup—they went in there. “You will make tea for us, Baptistin,” said the\r\ncount. Baptistin left the room without waiting to answer, and in two\r\nseconds reappeared, bringing on a tray, all that his master had\r\nordered, ready prepared, and appearing to have sprung from the ground,\r\nlike the repasts which we read of in fairy tales.\r\n\r\n“Really, my dear count,” said Morcerf, “what I admire in you is, not so\r\nmuch your riches, for perhaps there are people even wealthier than\r\nyourself, nor is it only your wit, for Beaumarchais might have\r\npossessed as much,—but it is your manner of being served, without any\r\nquestions, in a moment, in a second; it is as if they guessed what you\r\nwanted by your manner of ringing, and made a point of keeping\r\neverything you can possibly desire in constant readiness.”\r\n\r\n“What you say is perhaps true; they know my habits. For instance, you\r\nshall see; how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea-time?”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, I should like to smoke.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo took the gong and struck it once. In about the space of a\r\nsecond a private door opened, and Ali appeared, bringing two chibouques\r\nfilled with excellent latakia.\r\n\r\n“It is quite wonderful,” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“Oh no, it is as simple as possible,” replied Monte Cristo. “Ali knows\r\nI generally smoke while I am taking my tea or coffee; he has heard that\r\nI ordered tea, and he also knows that I brought you home with me; when\r\nI summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so, and as\r\nhe comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested\r\nthrough the medium of smoking, he naturally concludes that we shall\r\nsmoke in company, and therefore brings two chibouques instead of\r\none—and now the mystery is solved.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation, but it\r\nis not the less true that you——Ah, but what do I hear?” and Morcerf\r\ninclined his head towards the door, through which sounds seemed to\r\nissue resembling those of a guitar.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, my dear viscount, you are fated to hear music this evening;\r\nyou have only escaped from Mademoiselle Danglars’ piano, to be attacked\r\nby Haydée’s guzla.”\r\n\r\n“Haydée—what an adorable name! Are there, then, really women who bear\r\nthe name of Haydée anywhere but in Byron’s poems?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly there are. Haydée is a very uncommon name in France, but is\r\ncommon enough in Albania and Epirus; it is as if you said, for example,\r\nChastity, Modesty, Innocence,—it is a kind of baptismal name, as you\r\nParisians call it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that is charming,” said Albert, “how I should like to hear my\r\ncountrywomen called Mademoiselle Goodness, Mademoiselle Silence,\r\nMademoiselle Christian Charity! Only think, then, if Mademoiselle\r\nDanglars, instead of being called Claire-Marie-Eugénie, had been named\r\nMademoiselle Chastity-Modesty-Innocence Danglars; what a fine effect\r\nthat would have produced on the announcement of her marriage!”\r\n\r\n“Hush,” said the count, “do not joke in so loud a tone; Haydée may hear\r\nyou, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“And you think she would be angry?”\r\n\r\n“No, certainly not,” said the count with a haughty expression.\r\n\r\n“She is very amiable, then, is she not?” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“It is not to be called amiability, it is her duty; a slave does not\r\ndictate to a master.”\r\n\r\n“Come; you are joking yourself now. Are there any more slaves to be had\r\nwho bear this beautiful name?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly.”\r\n\r\n“Really, count, you do nothing, and have nothing like other people. The\r\nslave of the Count of Monte Cristo! Why, it is a rank of itself in\r\nFrance, and from the way in which you lavish money, it is a place that\r\nmust be worth a hundred thousand francs a year.”\r\n\r\n“A hundred thousand francs! The poor girl originally possessed much\r\nmore than that; she was born to treasures in comparison with which\r\nthose recorded in the _Thousand and One Nights_ would seem but\r\npoverty.”\r\n\r\n“She must be a princess then.”\r\n\r\n“You are right; and she is one of the greatest in her country too.”\r\n\r\n“I thought so. But how did it happen that such a great princess became\r\na slave?”\r\n\r\n“How was it that Dionysius the Tyrant became a schoolmaster? The\r\nfortune of war, my dear viscount,—the caprice of fortune; that is the\r\nway in which these things are to be accounted for.”\r\n\r\n“And is her name a secret?”\r\n\r\n“As regards the generality of mankind it is; but not for you, my dear\r\nviscount, who are one of my most intimate friends, and on whose silence\r\nI feel I may rely, if I consider it necessary to enjoin it—may I not do\r\nso?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; on my word of honor.”\r\n\r\n“You know the history of the Pasha of Yanina, do you not?”\r\n\r\n“Of Ali Tepelini?13 Oh, yes; it was in his service that my father made\r\nhis fortune.”\r\n\r\n“True, I had forgotten that.”\r\n\r\n40062m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, what is Haydée to Ali Tepelini?”\r\n\r\n“Merely his daughter.”\r\n\r\n“What? the daughter of Ali Pasha?”\r\n\r\n“Of Ali Pasha and the beautiful Vasiliki.”\r\n\r\n“And your slave?”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, yes.”\r\n\r\n“But how did she become so?”\r\n\r\n“Why, simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day, as\r\nI was passing through the market at Constantinople.”\r\n\r\n“Wonderful! Really, my dear count, you seem to throw a sort of magic\r\ninfluence over all in which you are concerned; when I listen to you,\r\nexistence no longer seems reality, but a waking dream. Now, I am\r\nperhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request, but——”\r\n\r\n“Say on.”\r\n\r\n“But, since you go out with Haydée, and sometimes even take her to the\r\nOpera——”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I think I may venture to ask you this favor.”\r\n\r\n“You may venture to ask me anything.”\r\n\r\n“Well then, my dear count, present me to your princess.”\r\n\r\n“I will do so; but on two conditions.”\r\n\r\n“I accept them at once.”\r\n\r\n“The first is, that you will never tell anyone that I have granted the\r\ninterview.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Albert, extending his hand; “I swear I will not.”\r\n\r\n“The second is, that you will not tell her that your father ever served\r\nhers.”\r\n\r\n“I give you my oath that I will not.”\r\n\r\n“Enough, viscount; you will remember those two vows, will you not? But\r\nI know you to be a man of honor.”\r\n\r\nThe count again struck the gong. Ali reappeared. “Tell Haydée,” said\r\nhe, “that I will take coffee with her, and give her to understand that\r\nI desire permission to present one of my friends to her.”\r\n\r\nAli bowed and left the room.\r\n\r\n“Now, understand me,” said the count, “no direct questions, my dear\r\nMorcerf; if you wish to know anything, tell me, and I will ask her.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed.”\r\n\r\nAli reappeared for the third time, and drew back the tapestried hanging\r\nwhich concealed the door, to signify to his master and Albert that they\r\nwere at liberty to pass on.\r\n\r\n“Let us go in,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\nAlbert passed his hand through his hair, and curled his moustache,\r\nthen, having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance, followed\r\nthe count into the room, the latter having previously resumed his hat\r\nand gloves. Ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard, and the door\r\nwas kept by the three French attendants, commanded by Myrtho.\r\n\r\nHaydée was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments,\r\nwhich was the drawing-room. Her large eyes were dilated with surprise\r\nand expectation, for it was the first time that any man, except Monte\r\nCristo, had been accorded an entrance into her presence. She was\r\nsitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room, with her legs crossed\r\nunder her in the Eastern fashion, and seemed to have made for herself,\r\nas it were, a kind of nest in the rich Indian silks which enveloped\r\nher. Near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing; it\r\nwas elegantly fashioned, and worthy of its mistress. On perceiving\r\nMonte Cristo, she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to\r\nherself, expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of\r\nthe deepest love. Monte Cristo advanced towards her and extended his\r\nhand, which she as usual raised to her lips.\r\n\r\n40064m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbert had proceeded no farther than the door, where he remained rooted\r\nto the spot, being completely fascinated by the sight of such\r\nsurpassing beauty, beheld as it was for the first time, and of which an\r\ninhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea.\r\n\r\n“Whom do you bring?” asked the young girl in Romaic, of Monte Cristo;\r\n“is it a friend, a brother, a simple acquaintance, or an enemy.”\r\n\r\n“A friend,” said Monte Cristo in the same language.\r\n\r\n“What is his name?”\r\n\r\n“Count Albert; it is the same man whom I rescued from the hands of the\r\nbanditti at Rome.”\r\n\r\n“In what language would you like me to converse with him?”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo turned to Albert. “Do you know modern Greek,” asked he.\r\n\r\n“Alas! no,” said Albert; “nor even ancient Greek, my dear count; never\r\nhad Homer or Plato a more unworthy scholar than myself.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Haydée, proving by her remark that she had quite\r\nunderstood Monte Cristo’s question and Albert’s answer, “then I will\r\nspeak either in French or Italian, if my lord so wills it.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo reflected one instant. “You will speak in Italian,” said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nThen, turning towards Albert,—“It is a pity you do not understand\r\neither ancient or modern Greek, both of which Haydée speaks so\r\nfluently; the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in Italian,\r\nwhich will give you but a very false idea of her powers of\r\nconversation.”\r\n\r\nThe count made a sign to Haydée to address his visitor. “Sir,” she said\r\nto Morcerf, “you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master.”\r\nThis was said in excellent Tuscan, and with that soft Roman accent\r\nwhich makes the language of Dante as sonorous as that of Homer. Then,\r\nturning to Ali, she directed him to bring coffee and pipes, and when he\r\nhad left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she\r\nbeckoned Albert to approach nearer to her. Monte Cristo and Morcerf\r\ndrew their seats towards a small table, on which were arranged music,\r\ndrawings, and vases of flowers. Ali then entered bringing coffee and\r\nchibouques; as to M. Baptistin, this portion of the building was\r\ninterdicted to him. Albert refused the pipe which the Nubian offered\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Oh, take it—take it,” said the count; “Haydée is almost as civilized\r\nas a Parisian; the smell of a Havana is disagreeable to her, but the\r\ntobacco of the East is a most delicious perfume, you know.”\r\n\r\nAli left the room. The cups of coffee were all prepared, with the\r\naddition of sugar, which had been brought for Albert. Monte Cristo and\r\nHaydée took the beverage in the original Arabian manner, that is to\r\nsay, without sugar. Haydée took the porcelain cup in her little slender\r\nfingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness\r\nof a child when eating or drinking something which it likes. At this\r\nmoment two women entered, bringing salvers filled with ices and\r\nsherbet, which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n“My dear host, and you, signora,” said Albert, in Italian, “excuse my\r\napparent stupidity. I am quite bewildered, and it is natural that it\r\nshould be so. Here I am in the heart of Paris; but a moment ago I heard\r\nthe rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the\r\nlemonade-sellers, and now I feel as if I were suddenly transported to\r\nthe East; not such as I have seen it, but such as my dreams have\r\npainted it. Oh, signora, if I could but speak Greek, your conversation,\r\nadded to the fairy-scene which surrounds me, would furnish an evening\r\nof such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget.”\r\n\r\n“I speak sufficient Italian to enable me to converse with you, sir,”\r\nsaid Haydée quietly; “and if you like what is Eastern, I will do my\r\nbest to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here.”\r\n\r\n“On what subject shall I converse with her?” said Albert, in a low tone\r\nto Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Just what you please; you may speak of her country and of her youthful\r\nreminiscences, or if you like it better you can talk of Rome, Naples,\r\nor Florence.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Albert, “it is of no use to be in the company of a Greek if\r\none converses just in the same style as with a Parisian; let me speak\r\nto her of the East.”\r\n\r\n“Do so then, for of all themes which you could choose that will be the\r\nmost agreeable to her taste.”\r\n\r\nAlbert turned towards Haydée. “At what age did you leave Greece,\r\nsignora?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“I left it when I was but five years old,” replied Haydée.\r\n\r\n“And have you any recollection of your country?”\r\n\r\n“When I shut my eyes and think, I seem to see it all again. The mind\r\ncan see as well as the body. The body forgets sometimes; but the mind\r\nalways remembers.”\r\n\r\n“And how far back into the past do your recollections extend?”\r\n\r\n“I could scarcely walk when my mother, who was called Vasiliki, which\r\nmeans royal,” said the young girl, tossing her head proudly, “took me\r\nby the hand, and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed,\r\nwe went out, both covered with veils, to solicit alms for the\r\nprisoners, saying, ‘He who giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord.’\r\nThen when our purse was full we returned to the palace, and without\r\nsaying a word to my father, we sent it to the convent, where it was\r\ndivided amongst the prisoners.”\r\n\r\n“And how old were you at that time?”\r\n\r\n“I was three years old,” said Haydée.\r\n\r\n“Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when\r\nyou were three years old?” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“Everything.”\r\n\r\n“Count,” said Albert, in a low tone to Monte Cristo, “do allow the\r\nsignora to tell me something of her history. You prohibited my\r\nmentioning my father’s name to her, but perhaps she will allude to him\r\nof her own accord in the course of the recital, and you have no idea\r\nhow delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful\r\nlips.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo turned to Haydée, and with an expression of countenance\r\nwhich commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words, he\r\nsaid in Greek, “Πατρὸς μὲν ἄτην μήζε τὸ ὄνομα προδότου καὶ προδοσίαν\r\nεἰπὲ ἡμῖν,”—that is, “Tell us the fate of your father; but neither the\r\nname of the traitor nor the treason.” Haydée sighed deeply, and a shade\r\nof sadness clouded her beautiful brow.\r\n\r\n“What are you saying to her?” said Morcerf in an undertone.\r\n\r\n“I again reminded her that you were a friend, and that she need not\r\nconceal anything from you.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Albert, “this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners\r\nwas your first remembrance; what is the next?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, then I remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the\r\nshade of some sycamore-trees, on the borders of a lake, in the waters\r\nof which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror. Under the\r\noldest and thickest of these trees, reclining on cushions, sat my\r\nfather; my mother was at his feet, and I, childlike, amused myself by\r\nplaying with his long white beard which descended to his girdle, or\r\nwith the diamond-hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle. Then from\r\ntime to time there came to him an Albanian who said something to which\r\nI paid no attention, but which he always answered in the same tone of\r\nvoice, either ‘Kill,’ or ‘Pardon.’”\r\n\r\n“It is very strange,” said Albert, “to hear such words proceed from the\r\nmouth of anyone but an actress on the stage, and one needs constantly\r\nto be saying to one’s self, ‘This is no fiction, it is all reality,’ in\r\norder to believe it. And how does France appear in your eyes,\r\naccustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes?”\r\n\r\n“I think it is a fine country,” said Haydée, “but I see France as it\r\nreally is, because I look on it with the eyes of a woman; whereas my\r\nown country, which I can only judge of from the impression produced on\r\nmy childish mind, always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere, which\r\nis luminous or otherwise, according as my remembrances of it are sad or\r\njoyous.”\r\n\r\n“So young,” said Albert, forgetting at the moment the Count’s command\r\nthat he should ask no questions of the slave herself, “is it possible\r\nthat you can have known what suffering is except by name?”\r\n\r\nHaydée turned her eyes towards Monte Cristo, who, making at the same\r\ntime some imperceptible sign, murmured:\r\n\r\n“Εἰπέ—speak.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our\r\nearly childhood, and with the exception of the two scenes I have just\r\ndescribed to you, all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with\r\ndeepest sadness.”\r\n\r\n40068m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Speak, speak, signora,” said Albert, “I am listening with the most\r\nintense delight and interest to all you say.”\r\n\r\nHaydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile. “You wish me, then,\r\nto relate the history of my past sorrows?” said she.\r\n\r\n“I beg you to do so,” replied Albert.\r\n\r\n“Well, I was but four years old when one night I was suddenly awakened\r\nby my mother. We were in the palace of Yanina; she snatched me from the\r\ncushions on which I was sleeping, and on opening my eyes I saw hers\r\nfilled with tears. She took me away without speaking. When I saw her\r\nweeping I began to cry too. ‘Hush, child!’ said she. At other times in\r\nspite of maternal endearments or threats, I had with a child’s caprice\r\nbeen accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as\r\nmuch as I felt inclined; but on this occasion there was an intonation\r\nof such extreme terror in my mother’s voice when she enjoined me to\r\nsilence, that I ceased crying as soon as her command was given. She\r\nbore me rapidly away.\r\n\r\n“I saw then that we were descending a large staircase; around us were\r\nall my mother’s servants carrying trunks, bags, ornaments, jewels,\r\npurses of gold, with which they were hurrying away in the greatest\r\ndistraction.\r\n\r\n“Behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and\r\npistols, and dressed in the costume which the Greeks have assumed since\r\nthey have again become a nation. You may imagine there was something\r\nstartling and ominous,” said Haydée, shaking her head and turning pale\r\nat the mere remembrance of the scene, “in this long file of slaves and\r\nwomen only half-aroused from sleep, or at least so they appeared to me,\r\nwho was myself scarcely awake. Here and there on the walls of the\r\nstaircase, were reflected gigantic shadows, which trembled in the\r\nflickering light of the pine-torches till they seemed to reach to the\r\nvaulted roof above.\r\n\r\n“‘Quick!’ said a voice at the end of the gallery. This voice made\r\neveryone bow before it, resembling in its effect the wind passing over\r\na field of wheat, by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield\r\nobeisance. As for me, it made me tremble. This voice was that of my\r\nfather. He came last, clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his\r\nhand the carbine which your emperor presented him. He was leaning on\r\nthe shoulder of his favorite Selim, and he drove us all before him, as\r\na shepherd would his straggling flock. My father,” said Haydée, raising\r\nher head, “was that illustrious man known in Europe under the name of\r\nAli Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and before whom Turkey trembled.”\r\n\r\nAlbert, without knowing why, started on hearing these words pronounced\r\nwith such a haughty and dignified accent; it appeared to him as if\r\nthere was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the\r\nexpression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of Haydée at this\r\nmoment; she appeared like a Pythoness evoking a spectre, as she\r\nrecalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man,\r\nto the news of which all Europe had listened with horror.\r\n\r\n“Soon,” said Haydée, “we halted on our march, and found ourselves on\r\nthe borders of a lake. My mother pressed me to her throbbing heart, and\r\nat the distance of a few paces I saw my father, who was glancing\r\nanxiously around. Four marble steps led down to the water’s edge, and\r\nbelow them was a boat floating on the tide.\r\n\r\n40070m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“From where we stood I could see in the middle of the lake a large\r\nblank mass; it was the kiosk to which we were going. This kiosk\r\nappeared to me to be at a considerable distance, perhaps on account of\r\nthe darkness of the night, which prevented any object from being more\r\nthan partially discerned. We stepped into the boat. I remember well\r\nthat the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water, and when I\r\nleaned over to ascertain the cause I saw that they were muffled with\r\nthe sashes of our Palikares.14 Besides the rowers, the boat contained\r\nonly the women, my father, mother, Selim, and myself. The Palikares had\r\nremained on the shore of the lake, ready to cover our retreat; they\r\nwere kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps, and in that manner\r\nintended making a rampart of the three others, in case of pursuit. Our\r\nbark flew before the wind. ‘Why does the boat go so fast?’ asked I of\r\nmy mother.\r\n\r\n“‘Silence, child! Hush, we are flying!’ I did not understand. Why\r\nshould my father fly?—he, the all-powerful—he, before whom others were\r\naccustomed to fly—he, who had taken for his device,\r\n\r\n‘They hate me; then they fear me!’\r\n\r\n\r\n“It was, indeed, a flight which my father was trying to effect. I have\r\nbeen told since that the garrison of the castle of Yanina, fatigued\r\nwith long service——”\r\n\r\nHere Haydée cast a significant glance at Monte Cristo, whose eyes had\r\nbeen riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her\r\nnarrative. The young girl then continued, speaking slowly, like a\r\nperson who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the\r\nhistory which he is relating.\r\n\r\n“You were saying, signora,” said Albert, who was paying the most\r\nimplicit attention to the recital, “that the garrison of Yanina,\r\nfatigued with long service——”\r\n\r\n“Had treated with the Seraskier15 Kourchid, who had been sent by the\r\nsultan to gain possession of the person of my father; it was then that\r\nAli Tepelini—after having sent to the sultan a French officer in whom\r\nhe reposed great confidence—resolved to retire to the asylum which he\r\nhad long before prepared for himself, and which he called\r\n_kataphygion_, or the refuge.”\r\n\r\n“And this officer,” asked Albert, “do you remember his name, signora?”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl, which was\r\nquite unperceived by Albert.\r\n\r\n“No,” said she, “I do not remember it just at this moment; but if it\r\nshould occur to me presently, I will tell you.”\r\n\r\nAlbert was on the point of pronouncing his father’s name, when Monte\r\nCristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach; the young man\r\nrecollected his promise, and was silent.\r\n\r\n“It was towards this kiosk that we were rowing. A ground floor,\r\nornamented with arabesques, bathing its terraces in the water, and\r\nanother floor, looking on the lake, was all which was visible to the\r\neye. But beneath the ground floor, stretching out into the island, was\r\na large subterranean cavern, to which my mother, myself, and the women\r\nwere conducted. In this place were together 60,000 pouches and 200\r\nbarrels; the pouches contained 25,000,000 of money in gold, and the\r\nbarrels were filled with 30,000 pounds of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n“Near the barrels stood Selim, my father’s favorite, whom I mentioned\r\nto you just now. He stood watch day and night with a lance provided\r\nwith a lighted slowmatch in his hand, and he had orders to blow up\r\neverything—kiosk, guards, women, gold, and Ali Tepelini himself—at the\r\nfirst signal given by my father. I remember well that the slaves,\r\nconvinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives,\r\npassed whole days and nights in praying, crying, and groaning. As for\r\nme, I can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young\r\nsoldier, and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world, I\r\nam quite sure I shall recognize Selim. I cannot tell you how long we\r\nremained in this state; at that period I did not even know what time\r\nmeant. Sometimes, but very rarely, my father summoned me and my mother\r\nto the terrace of the palace; these were hours of recreation for me, as\r\nI never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances\r\nof the slaves and Selim’s fiery lance. My father was endeavoring to\r\npierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon,\r\nexamining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake,\r\nwhile my mother, reclining by his side, rested her head on his\r\nshoulder, and I played at his feet, admiring everything I saw with that\r\nunsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round\r\nobjects insignificant in themselves, but which in its eyes are invested\r\nwith the greatest importance. The heights of Pindus towered above us;\r\nthe castle of Yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the\r\nlake, and the immense masses of black vegetation which, viewed in the\r\ndistance, gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks, were in\r\nreality gigantic fir-trees and myrtles.\r\n\r\n“One morning my father sent for us; my mother had been crying all the\r\nnight, and was very wretched; we found the pasha calm, but paler than\r\nusual. ‘Take courage, Vasiliki,’ said he; ‘today arrives the firman of\r\nthe master, and my fate will be decided. If my pardon be complete, we\r\nshall return triumphant to Yanina; if the news be inauspicious, we must\r\nfly this night.’—‘But supposing our enemy should not allow us to do\r\nso?’ said my mother. ‘Oh, make yourself easy on that head,’ said Ali,\r\nsmiling; ‘Selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter. They\r\nwould be glad to see me dead, but they would not like themselves to die\r\nwith me.’\r\n\r\n“My mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did\r\nnot come from my father’s heart. She prepared the iced water which he\r\nwas in the habit of constantly drinking,—for since his sojourn at the\r\nkiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever,—after which she\r\nanointed his white beard with perfumed oil, and lighted his chibouque,\r\nwhich he sometimes smoked for hours together, quietly watching the\r\nwreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted\r\naway in the surrounding atmosphere. Presently he made such a sudden\r\nmovement that I was paralyzed with fear. Then, without taking his eyes\r\nfrom the object which had first attracted his attention, he asked for\r\nhis telescope. My mother gave it him, and as she did so, looked whiter\r\nthan the marble against which she leaned. I saw my father’s hand\r\ntremble. ‘A boat!—two!—three!’ murmured my, father;—‘four!’ He then\r\narose, seizing his arms and priming his pistols. ‘Vasiliki,’ said he to\r\nmy mother, trembling perceptibly, ‘the instant approaches which will\r\ndecide everything. In the space of half an hour we shall know the\r\nemperor’s answer. Go into the cavern with Haydée.’—‘I will not quit\r\nyou,’ said Vasiliki; ‘if you die, my lord, I will die with you.’—‘Go to\r\nSelim!’ cried my father. ‘Adieu, my lord,’ murmured my mother,\r\ndetermining quietly to await the approach of death. ‘Take away\r\nVasiliki!’ said my father to his Palikares.\r\n\r\n“As for me, I had been forgotten in the general confusion; I ran toward\r\nAli Tepelini; he saw me hold out my arms to him, and he stooped down\r\nand pressed my forehead with his lips. Oh, how distinctly I remember\r\nthat kiss!—it was the last he ever gave me, and I feel as if it were\r\nstill warm on my forehead. On descending, we saw through the\r\nlattice-work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct\r\nto our view. At first they appeared like black specks, and now they\r\nlooked like birds skimming the surface of the waves. During this time,\r\nin the kiosk at my father’s feet, were seated twenty Palikares,\r\nconcealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager\r\neyes the arrival of the boats. They were armed with their long guns\r\ninlaid with mother-of-pearl and silver, and cartridges in great numbers\r\nwere lying scattered on the floor. My father looked at his watch, and\r\npaced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest\r\nanguish. This was the scene which presented itself to my view as I\r\nquitted my father after that last kiss.\r\n\r\n“My mother and I traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern.\r\nSelim was still at his post, and smiled sadly on us as we entered. We\r\nfetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern, and sat down by\r\nSelim. In great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other; and,\r\nyoung as I was, I quite understood that some imminent danger was\r\nhanging over our heads.”\r\n\r\nAlbert had often heard—not from his father, for he never spoke on the\r\nsubject, but from strangers—the description of the last moments of the\r\nvizier of Yanina; he had read different accounts of his death, but the\r\nstory seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of\r\nthe young girl, and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy\r\nexpression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him.\r\n\r\nAs to Haydée, these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered\r\nher for a moment, for she ceased speaking, her head leaning on her hand\r\nlike a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm; and\r\nher eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally\r\ncontemplating the green summit of the Pindus and the blue waters of the\r\nlake of Yanina, which, like a magic mirror, seemed to reflect the\r\nsombre picture which she sketched. Monte Cristo looked at her with an\r\nindescribable expression of interest and pity.\r\n\r\n“Go on, my child,” said the count in the Romaic language.\r\n\r\n40074m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaydée looked up abruptly, as if the sonorous tones of Monte Cristo’s\r\nvoice had awakened her from a dream; and she resumed her narrative.\r\n\r\n“It was about four o’clock in the afternoon, and although the day was\r\nbrilliant out-of-doors, we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the\r\ncavern. One single, solitary light was burning there, and it appeared\r\nlike a star set in a heaven of blackness; it was Selim’s flaming lance.\r\nMy mother was a Christian, and she prayed. Selim repeated from time to\r\ntime the sacred words: ‘God is great!’ However, my mother had still\r\nsome hope. As she was coming down, she thought she recognized the\r\nFrench officer who had been sent to Constantinople, and in whom my\r\nfather placed so much confidence; for he knew that all the soldiers of\r\nthe French emperor were naturally noble and generous. She advanced some\r\nsteps towards the staircase, and listened. ‘They are approaching,’ said\r\nshe; ‘perhaps they bring us peace and liberty!’\r\n\r\n“‘What do you fear, Vasiliki?’ said Selim, in a voice at once so gentle\r\nand yet so proud. ‘If they do not bring us peace, we will give them\r\nwar; if they do not bring life, we will give them death.’ And he\r\nrenewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of\r\nDionysus of old Crete.16 But I, being only a little child, was\r\nterrified by this undaunted courage, which appeared to me both\r\nferocious and senseless, and I recoiled with horror from the idea of\r\nthe frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us.\r\n\r\n“My mother experienced the same sensations, for I felt her tremble.\r\n‘Mamma, mamma,’ said I, ‘are we really to be killed?’ And at the sound\r\nof my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and\r\nlamentations. ‘My child,’ said Vasiliki, ‘may God preserve you from\r\never wishing for that death which today you so much dread!’ Then,\r\nwhispering to Selim, she asked what were her master’s orders. ‘If he\r\nsend me his poniard, it will signify that the emperor’s intentions are\r\nnot favorable, and I am to set fire to the powder; if, on the contrary,\r\nhe send me his ring, it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him,\r\nand I am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched.’—‘My\r\nfriend,’ said my mother, ‘when your master’s orders arrive, if it is\r\nthe poniard which he sends, instead of despatching us by that horrible\r\ndeath which we both so much dread, you will mercifully kill us with\r\nthis same poniard, will you not?’—‘Yes, Vasiliki,’ replied Selim\r\ntranquilly.\r\n\r\n“Suddenly we heard loud cries; and, listening, discerned that they were\r\ncries of joy. The name of the French officer who had been sent to\r\nConstantinople resounded on all sides amongst our Palikares; it was\r\nevident that he brought the answer of the emperor, and that it was\r\nfavorable.”\r\n\r\n“And do you not remember the Frenchman’s name?” said Morcerf, quite\r\nready to aid the memory of the narrator. Monte Cristo made a sign to\r\nhim to be silent.\r\n\r\n“I do not recollect it,” said Haydée.\r\n\r\n“The noise increased; steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer;\r\nthey were descending the steps leading to the cavern. Selim made ready\r\nhis lance. Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance\r\nof the cave, formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which\r\nhad found their way into this gloomy retreat. ‘Who are you?’ cried\r\nSelim. ‘But whoever you may be, I charge you not to advance another\r\nstep.’—‘Long live the emperor!’ said the figure. ‘He grants a full\r\npardon to the Vizier Ali, and not only gives him his life, but restores\r\nto him his fortune and his possessions.’ My mother uttered a cry of\r\njoy, and clasped me to her bosom. ‘Stop,’ said Selim, seeing that she\r\nwas about to go out; ‘you see I have not yet received the\r\nring,’—‘True,’ said my mother. And she fell on her knees, at the same\r\ntime holding me up towards heaven, as if she desired, while praying to\r\nGod in my behalf, to raise me actually to his presence.”\r\n\r\nAnd for the second time Haydée stopped, overcome by such violent\r\nemotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow, and her stifled\r\nvoice seemed hardly able to find utterance, so parched and dry were her\r\nthroat and lips.\r\n\r\n40076m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo poured a little iced water into a glass, and presented it\r\nto her, saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of\r\ncommand,—“Courage.”\r\n\r\nHaydée dried her eyes, and continued:\r\n\r\n“By this time our eyes, habituated to the darkness, had recognized the\r\nmessenger of the pasha,—it was a friend. Selim had also recognized him,\r\nbut the brave young man only acknowledged one duty, which was to obey.\r\n‘In whose name do you come?’ said he to him. ‘I come in the name of our\r\nmaster, Ali Tepelini.’—‘If you come from Ali himself,’ said Selim, ‘you\r\nknow what you were charged to remit to me?’—‘Yes,’ said the messenger,\r\n‘and I bring you his ring.’ At these words he raised his hand above his\r\nhead, to show the token; but it was too far off, and there was not\r\nlight enough to enable Selim, where he was standing, to distinguish and\r\nrecognize the object presented to his view. ‘I do not see what you have\r\nin your hand,’ said Selim. ‘Approach then,’ said the messenger, ‘or I\r\nwill come nearer to you, if you prefer it.’—‘I will agree to neither\r\none nor the other,’ replied the young soldier; ‘place the object which\r\nI desire to see in the ray of light which shines there, and retire\r\nwhile I examine it.’—‘Be it so,’ said the envoy; and he retired, after\r\nhaving first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to\r\nhim by Selim.\r\n\r\n“Oh, how our hearts palpitated; for it did, indeed, seem to be a ring\r\nwhich was placed there. But was it my father’s ring? that was the\r\nquestion. Selim, still holding in his hand the lighted match, walked\r\ntowards the opening in the cavern, and, aided by the faint light which\r\nstreamed in through the mouth of the cave, picked up the token.\r\n\r\n“‘It is well,’ said he, kissing it; ‘it is my master’s ring!’ And\r\nthrowing the match on the ground, he trampled on it and extinguished\r\nit. The messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands. At this\r\nsignal four soldiers of the Seraskier Kourchid suddenly appeared, and\r\nSelim fell, pierced by five blows. Each man had stabbed him separately,\r\nand, intoxicated by their crime, though still pale with fear, they\r\nsought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire,\r\nafter which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold. At\r\nthis moment my mother seized me in her arms, and hurrying noiselessly\r\nalong numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves, she\r\narrived at a private staircase of the kiosk, where was a scene of\r\nfrightful tumult and confusion. The lower rooms were entirely filled\r\nwith Kourchid’s troops; that is to say, with our enemies. Just as my\r\nmother was on the point of pushing open a small door, we heard the\r\nvoice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone. My mother\r\napplied her eye to the crack between the boards; I luckily found a\r\nsmall opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was\r\npassing within. ‘What do you want?’ said my father to some people who\r\nwere holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold. ‘What we want,’\r\nreplied one, ‘is to communicate to you the will of his highness. Do you\r\nsee this firman?’—‘I do,’ said my father. ‘Well, read it; he demands\r\nyour head.’\r\n\r\n40078m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“My father answered with a loud laugh, which was more frightful than\r\neven threats would have been, and he had not ceased when two reports of\r\na pistol were heard; he had fired them himself, and had killed two men.\r\nThe Palikares, who were prostrated at my father’s feet, now sprang up\r\nand fired, and the room was filled with fire and smoke. At the same\r\ninstant the firing began on the other side, and the balls penetrated\r\nthe boards all round us. Oh, how noble did the grand vizier my father\r\nlook at that moment, in the midst of the flying bullets, his scimitar\r\nin his hand, and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies! and\r\nhow he terrified them, even then, and made them fly before him! ‘Selim,\r\nSelim!’ cried he, ‘guardian of the fire, do your duty!’—‘Selim is\r\ndead,’ replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the\r\nearth, ‘and you are lost, Ali!’ At the same moment an explosion was\r\nheard, and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was\r\nsuddenly torn up and shivered to atoms—the troops were firing from\r\nunderneath. Three or four Palikares fell with their bodies literally\r\nploughed with wounds.\r\n\r\n“My father howled aloud, plunged his fingers into the holes which the\r\nballs had made, and tore up one of the planks entire. But immediately\r\nthrough this opening twenty more shots were fired, and the flame,\r\nrushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano, soon reached the\r\ntapestry, which it quickly devoured. In the midst of all this frightful\r\ntumult and these terrific cries, two reports, fearfully distinct,\r\nfollowed by two shrieks more heartrending than all, froze me with\r\nterror. These two shots had mortally wounded my father, and it was he\r\nwho had given utterance to these frightful cries. However, he remained\r\nstanding, clinging to a window. My mother tried to force the door, that\r\nshe might go and die with him, but it was fastened on the inside. All\r\naround him were lying the Palikares, writhing in convulsive agonies,\r\nwhile two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape\r\nby springing from the windows. At this crisis the whole flooring\r\nsuddenly gave way, my father fell on one knee, and at the same moment\r\ntwenty hands were thrust forth, armed with sabres, pistols, and\r\nponiards—twenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man,\r\nand my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by\r\nthese demons, and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his\r\nfeet. I felt myself fall to the ground, my mother had fainted.”\r\n\r\nHaydée’s arms fell by her side, and she uttered a deep groan, at the\r\nsame time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied\r\nwith her obedience to his commands.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo arose and approached her, took her hand, and said to her\r\nin Romaic:\r\n\r\n“Calm yourself, my dear child, and take courage in remembering that\r\nthere is a God who will punish traitors.”\r\n\r\n“It is a frightful story, count,” said Albert, terrified at the\r\npaleness of Haydée’s countenance, “and I reproach myself now for having\r\nbeen so cruel and thoughtless in my request.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is nothing,” said Monte Cristo. Then, patting the young girl on\r\nthe head, he continued, “Haydée is very courageous, and she sometimes\r\neven finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes.”\r\n\r\n“Because, my lord,” said Haydée eagerly, “my miseries recall to me the\r\nremembrance of your goodness.”\r\n\r\nAlbert looked at her with curiosity, for she had not yet related what\r\nhe most desired to know,—how she had become the slave of the count.\r\nHaydée saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances\r\nof her two auditors; she continued:\r\n\r\n“When my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier.\r\n‘Kill,’ said she, ‘but spare the honor of the widow of Ali.’—‘It is not\r\nto me to whom you must address yourself,’ said Kourchid.\r\n\r\n“‘To whom, then?’—‘To your new master.’\r\n\r\n“‘Who and where is he?’—‘He is here.’\r\n\r\n“And Kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the\r\ndeath of my father,” said Haydée, in a tone of chastened anger.\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Albert, “you became the property of this man?”\r\n\r\n40080m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Haydée, “he did not dare to keep us, so we were sold to\r\nsome slave-merchants who were going to Constantinople. We traversed\r\nGreece, and arrived half dead at the imperial gates. They were\r\nsurrounded by a crowd of people, who opened a way for us to pass, when\r\nsuddenly my mother, having looked closely at an object which was\r\nattracting their attention, uttered a piercing cry and fell to the\r\nground, pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the\r\ngates, and beneath which were inscribed these words:\r\n\r\n‘_This is the head of Ali Tepelini, Pasha of Yanina._’\r\n\r\n“I cried bitterly, and tried to raise my mother from the earth, but she\r\nwas dead! I was taken to the slave-market, and was purchased by a rich\r\nArmenian. He caused me to be instructed, gave me masters, and when I\r\nwas thirteen years of age he sold me to the Sultan Mahmoud.”\r\n\r\n“Of whom I bought her,” said Monte Cristo, “as I told you, Albert, with\r\nthe emerald which formed a match to the one I had made into a box for\r\nthe purpose of holding my hashish pills.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are good, you are great, my lord!” said Haydée, kissing the\r\ncount’s hand, “and I am very fortunate in belonging to such a master!”\r\n\r\nAlbert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard.\r\n\r\n“Come, finish your cup of coffee,” said Monte Cristo; “the history is\r\nended.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 78. We hear From Yanina\r\n\r\nIf Valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated\r\ncountenance of Franz when he quitted the chamber of M. Noirtier, even\r\nshe would have been constrained to pity him. Villefort had only just\r\ngiven utterance to a few incoherent sentences, and then retired to his\r\nstudy, where he received about two hours afterwards the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n“After all the disclosures which were made this morning, M. Noirtier de\r\nVillefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed\r\nbetween his family and that of M. Franz d’Épinay. M. d’Épinay must say\r\nthat he is shocked and astonished that M. de Villefort, who appeared to\r\nbe aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning, should not\r\nhave anticipated him in this announcement.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one who had seen the magistrate at this moment, so thoroughly\r\nunnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances, would\r\nhave supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance;\r\nalthough it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would\r\ncarry candor, or rather rudeness, so far as to relate such a history.\r\nAnd in justice to Villefort, it must be understood that M. Noirtier,\r\nwho never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject, had always\r\nomitted to explain the affair to Villefort, so that he had all his life\r\nentertained the belief that General de Quesnel, or the Baron d’Épinay,\r\nas he was alternately styled, according as the speaker wished to\r\nidentify him by his own family name, or by the title which had been\r\nconferred on him, fell the victim of assassination, and not that he was\r\nkilled fairly in a duel. This harsh letter, coming as it did from a man\r\ngenerally so polite and respectful, struck a mortal blow at the pride\r\nof Villefort.\r\n\r\nHardly had he read the letter, when his wife entered. The sudden\r\ndeparture of Franz, after being summoned by M. Noirtier, had so much\r\nastonished everyone, that the position of Madame de Villefort, left\r\nalone with the notary and the witnesses, became every moment more\r\nembarrassing. Determined to bear it no longer, she arose and left the\r\nroom; saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his\r\nsudden disappearance.\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort’s communications on the subject were very limited and\r\nconcise; he told her, in fact, that an explanation had taken place\r\nbetween M. Noirtier, M. d’Épinay, and himself, and that the marriage of\r\nValentine and Franz would consequently be broken off. This was an\r\nawkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were\r\nwaiting. She therefore contented herself with saying that M. Noirtier\r\nhaving at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of\r\napoplectic fit, the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days\r\nlonger. This news, false as it was following so singularly in the train\r\nof the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred,\r\nevidently astonished the auditors, and they retired without a word.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Valentine, at once terrified and happy, after having\r\nembraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single\r\nblow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as\r\nirrefragable, asked leave to retire to her own room, in order to\r\nrecover her composure. Noirtier looked the permission which she\r\nsolicited. But instead of going to her own room, Valentine, having once\r\ngained her liberty, entered the gallery, and, opening a small door at\r\nthe end of it, found herself at once in the garden.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the\r\nother, an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of\r\nValentine’s mind. She expected every moment that she should see Morrel\r\nappear, pale and trembling, to forbid the signing of the contract, like\r\nthe Laird of Ravenswood in _The Bride of Lammermoor_.\r\n\r\nIt was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate, for\r\nMaximilian had long awaited her coming. He had half guessed what was\r\ngoing on when he saw Franz quit the cemetery with M. de Villefort. He\r\nfollowed M. d’Épinay, saw him enter, afterwards go out, and then\r\nre-enter with Albert and Château-Renaud. He had no longer any doubts as\r\nto the nature of the conference; he therefore quickly went to the gate\r\nin the clover-patch, prepared to hear the result of the proceedings,\r\nand very certain that Valentine would hasten to him the first moment\r\nshe should be set at liberty. He was not mistaken; peering through the\r\ncrevices of the wooden partition, he soon discovered the young girl,\r\nwho cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the\r\nbarrier. The first glance which Maximilian directed towards her\r\nentirely reassured him, and the first words she spoke made his heart\r\nbound with delight.\r\n\r\n“We are saved!” said Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Saved?” repeated Morrel, not being able to conceive such intense\r\nhappiness; “by whom?”\r\n\r\n“By my grandfather. Oh, Morrel, pray love him for all his goodness to\r\nus!”\r\n\r\nMorrel swore to love him with all his soul; and at that moment he could\r\nsafely promise to do so, for he felt as though it were not enough to\r\nlove him merely as a friend or even as a father, he worshiped him as a\r\ngod.\r\n\r\n“But tell me, Valentine, how has it all been effected? What strange\r\nmeans has he used to compass this blessed end?”\r\n\r\nValentine was on the point of relating all that had passed, but she\r\nsuddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret\r\nwhich concerned others as well as her grandfather, and she said:\r\n\r\n“At some future time I will tell you all about it.”\r\n\r\n“But when will that be?”\r\n\r\n“When I am your wife.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to Morrel,\r\nthat he was ready to accede to anything that Valentine thought fit to\r\npropose, and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he\r\njust heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day.\r\nHowever, he would not leave without the promise of seeing Valentine\r\nagain the next night. Valentine promised all that Morrel required of\r\nher, and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that\r\nshe should marry Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself\r\nthat she should not marry Franz.\r\n\r\nDuring the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed, Madame\r\nde Villefort had gone to visit M. Noirtier. The old man looked at her\r\nwith that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed\r\nto receive her.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said she, “it is superfluous for me to tell you that Valentine’s\r\nmarriage is broken off, since it was here that the affair was\r\nconcluded.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier’s countenance remained immovable.\r\n\r\n“But one thing I can tell you, of which I do not think you are aware;\r\nthat is, that I have always been opposed to this marriage, and that the\r\ncontract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier regarded his daughter-in-law with the look of a man desiring\r\nan explanation.\r\n\r\n“Now that this marriage, which I know you so much disliked, is done\r\naway with, I come to you on an errand which neither M. de Villefort nor\r\nValentine could consistently undertake.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier’s eyes demanded the nature of her mission.\r\n\r\n“I come to entreat you, sir,” continued Madame de Villefort, “as the\r\nonly one who has the right of doing so, inasmuch as I am the only one\r\nwho will receive no personal benefit from the transaction,—I come to\r\nentreat you to restore, not your love, for that she has always\r\npossessed, but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter.”\r\n\r\nThere was a doubtful expression in Noirtier’s eyes; he was evidently\r\ntrying to discover the motive of this proceeding, and he could not\r\nsucceed in doing so.\r\n\r\n“May I hope, sir,” said Madame de Villefort, “that your intentions\r\naccord with my request?”\r\n\r\nNoirtier made a sign that they did.\r\n\r\n“In that case, sir,” rejoined Madame de Villefort, “I will leave you\r\noverwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to\r\nmy wishes.” She then bowed to M. Noirtier and retired.\r\n\r\nThe next day M. Noirtier sent for the notary; the first will was torn\r\nup and a second made, in which he left the whole of his fortune to\r\nValentine, on condition that she should never be separated from him. It\r\nwas then generally reported that Mademoiselle de Villefort, the heiress\r\nof the marquis and marchioness of Saint-Méran, had regained the good\r\ngraces of her grandfather, and that she would ultimately be in\r\npossession of an income of 300,000 livres.\r\n\r\nWhile all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the\r\nmarriage-contract were being carried on at the house of M. de\r\nVillefort, Monte Cristo had paid his visit to the Count of Morcerf,\r\nwho, in order to lose no time in responding to M. Danglars’ wishes, and\r\nat the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society,\r\ndonned his uniform of lieutenant-general, which he ornamented with all\r\nhis crosses, and thus attired, ordered his finest horses and drove to\r\nthe Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin.\r\n\r\nDanglars was balancing his monthly accounts, and it was perhaps not the\r\nmost favorable moment for finding him in his best humor. At the first\r\nsight of his old friend, Danglars assumed his majestic air, and settled\r\nhimself in his easy-chair.\r\n\r\nMorcerf, usually so stiff and formal, accosted the banker in an affable\r\nand smiling manner, and, feeling sure that the overture he was about to\r\nmake would be well received, he did not consider it necessary to adopt\r\nany manœuvres in order to gain his end, but went at once straight to\r\nthe point.\r\n\r\n40086m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, baron,” said he, “here I am at last; some time has elapsed since\r\nour plans were formed, and they are not yet executed.”\r\n\r\nMorcerf paused at these words, quietly waiting till the cloud should\r\nhave dispersed which had gathered on the brow of Danglars, and which he\r\nattributed to his silence; but, on the contrary, to his great surprise,\r\nit grew darker and darker.\r\n\r\n“To what do you allude, monsieur?” said Danglars; as if he were trying\r\nin vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general’s words.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Morcerf, “I see you are a stickler for forms, my dear sir,\r\nand you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be\r\nomitted. _Ma foi_, I beg your pardon, but as I have but one son, and it\r\nis the first time I have ever thought of marrying him, I am still\r\nserving my apprenticeship, you know; come, I will reform.”\r\n\r\nAnd Morcerf with a forced smile arose, and, making a low bow to M.\r\nDanglars, said:\r\n\r\n“Baron, I have the honor of asking of you the hand of Mademoiselle\r\nEugénie Danglars for my son, the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf.”\r\n\r\nBut Danglars, instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner\r\nwhich Morcerf had expected, knit his brow, and without inviting the\r\ncount, who was still standing, to take a seat, he said:\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, it will be necessary to reflect before I give you an\r\nanswer.”\r\n\r\n“To reflect?” said Morcerf, more and more astonished; “have you not had\r\nenough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed\r\nsince this marriage was first discussed between us?”\r\n\r\n“Count,” said the banker, “things are constantly occurring in the world\r\nto induce us to lay aside our most established opinions, or at all\r\nevents to cause us to remodel them according to the change of\r\ncircumstances, which may have placed affairs in a totally different\r\nlight to that in which we at first viewed them.”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand you, baron,” said Morcerf.\r\n\r\n“What I mean to say is this, sir,—that during the last fortnight\r\nunforeseen circumstances have occurred——”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” said Morcerf, “but is it a play we are acting?”\r\n\r\n“A play?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for it is like one; pray let us come more to the point, and\r\nendeavor thoroughly to understand each other.”\r\n\r\n“That is quite my desire.”\r\n\r\n“You have seen M. de Monte Cristo have you not?”\r\n\r\n“I see him very often,” said Danglars, drawing himself up; “he is a\r\nparticular friend of mine.”\r\n\r\n“Well, in one of your late conversations with him, you said that I\r\nappeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage, did\r\nyou not?”\r\n\r\n“I did say so.”\r\n\r\n“Well, here I am, proving at once that I am really neither the one nor\r\nthe other, by entreating you to keep your promise on that score.”\r\n\r\nDanglars did not answer.\r\n\r\n“Have you so soon changed your mind,” added Morcerf, “or have you only\r\nprovoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me\r\nhumbled?”\r\n\r\nDanglars, seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone\r\nin which he had begun it, the whole thing might turn out to his own\r\ndisadvantage, turned to Morcerf, and said:\r\n\r\n“Count, you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve, and I assure you\r\nit costs me much to act in such a manner towards you; but, believe me\r\nwhen I say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“These are all so many empty words, my dear sir,” said Morcerf: “they\r\nmight satisfy a new acquaintance, but the Comte de Morcerf does not\r\nrank in that list; and when a man like him comes to another, recalls to\r\nhim his plighted word, and this man fails to redeem the pledge, he has\r\nat least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing.”\r\n\r\nDanglars was a coward, but did not wish to appear so; he was piqued at\r\nthe tone which Morcerf had just assumed.\r\n\r\n“I am not without a good reason for my conduct,” replied the banker.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean to say?”\r\n\r\n“I mean to say that I have a good reason, but that it is difficult to\r\nexplain.”\r\n\r\n“You must be aware, at all events, that it is impossible for me to\r\nunderstand motives before they are explained to me; but one thing at\r\nleast is clear, which is, that you decline allying yourself with my\r\nfamily.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” said Danglars; “I merely suspend my decision, that is all.”\r\n\r\n“And do you really flatter yourself that I shall yield to all your\r\ncaprices, and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received\r\ninto your good graces?”\r\n\r\n“Then, count, if you will not wait, we must look upon these projects as\r\nif they had never been entertained.”\r\n\r\nThe count bit his lips till the blood almost started, to prevent the\r\nebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely\r\nallowed him to restrain; understanding, however, that in the present\r\nstate of things the laugh would decidedly be against him, he turned\r\nfrom the door, towards which he had been directing his steps, and again\r\nconfronted the banker. A cloud settled on his brow, evincing decided\r\nanxiety and uneasiness, instead of the expression of offended pride\r\nwhich had lately reigned there.\r\n\r\n“My dear Danglars,” said Morcerf, “we have been acquainted for many\r\nyears, and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each\r\nother’s failings. You owe me an explanation, and really it is but fair\r\nthat I should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of\r\nyour favor.”\r\n\r\n“It is from no personal ill-feeling towards the viscount, that is all I\r\ncan say, sir,” replied Danglars, who resumed his insolent manner as\r\nsoon as he perceived that Morcerf was a little softened and calmed\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n“And towards whom do you bear this personal ill-feeling, then?” said\r\nMorcerf, turning pale with anger. The expression of the count’s face\r\nhad not remained unperceived by the banker; he fixed on him a look of\r\ngreater assurance than before, and said:\r\n\r\n“You may, perhaps, be better satisfied that I should not go farther\r\ninto particulars.”\r\n\r\nA tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count, and\r\nmaking a violent effort over himself, he said: “I have a right to\r\ninsist on your giving me an explanation. Is it Madame de Morcerf who\r\nhas displeased you? Is it my fortune which you find insufficient? Is it\r\nbecause my opinions differ from yours?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing of the kind, sir,” replied Danglars: “if such had been the\r\ncase, I only should have been to blame, inasmuch as I was aware of all\r\nthese things when I made the engagement. No, do not seek any longer to\r\ndiscover the reason. I really am quite ashamed to have been the cause\r\nof your undergoing such severe self-examination; let us drop the\r\nsubject, and adopt the middle course of delay, which implies neither a\r\nrupture nor an engagement. _Ma foi_, there is no hurry. My daughter is\r\nonly seventeen years old, and your son twenty-one. While we wait, time\r\nwill be progressing, events will succeed each other; things which in\r\nthe evening look dark and obscure, appear but too clearly in the light\r\nof morning, and sometimes the utterance of one word, or the lapse of a\r\nsingle day, will reveal the most cruel calumnies.”\r\n\r\n“Calumnies, did you say, sir?” cried Morcerf, turning livid with rage.\r\n“Does anyone dare to slander me?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, I told you that I considered it best to avoid all\r\nexplanation.”\r\n\r\n“Then, sir, I am patiently to submit to your refusal?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, although I assure you the refusal is as painful for me to\r\ngive as it is for you to receive, for I had reckoned on the honor of\r\nyour alliance, and the breaking off of a marriage contract always\r\ninjures the lady more than the gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“Enough, sir,” said Morcerf, “we will speak no more on the subject.”\r\n\r\nAnd clutching his gloves in anger, he left the apartment. Danglars\r\nobserved that during the whole conversation Morcerf had never once\r\ndared to ask if it was on his own account that Danglars recalled his\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThat evening he had a long conference with several friends; and M.\r\nCavalcanti, who had remained in the drawing-room with the ladies, was\r\nthe last to leave the banker’s house.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as soon as he awoke, Danglars asked for the\r\nnewspapers; they were brought to him; he laid aside three or four, and\r\nat last fixed on _l’Impartial_, the paper of which Beauchamp was the\r\nchief editor. He hastily tore off the cover, opened the journal with\r\nnervous precipitation, passed contemptuously over the Paris jottings,\r\nand arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence, stopped with a\r\nmalicious smile, at a paragraph headed\r\n\r\n_We hear from Yanina._\r\n\r\n\r\n“Very good,” observed Danglars, after having read the paragraph; “here\r\nis a little article on Colonel Fernand, which, if I am not mistaken,\r\nwould render the explanation which the Comte de Morcerf required of me\r\nperfectly unnecessary.”\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, that is, at nine o’clock in the morning, Albert de\r\nMorcerf, dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin, might have\r\nbeen seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of\r\nMonte Cristo’s house in the Champs-Élysées. When he presented himself\r\nat the gate the porter informed him that the Count had gone out about\r\nhalf an hour previously.\r\n\r\n“Did he take Baptistin with him?”\r\n\r\n“No, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Call him, then; I wish to speak to him.”\r\n\r\nThe concierge went to seek the valet de chambre, and returned with him\r\nin an instant.\r\n\r\n“My good friend,” said Albert, “I beg pardon for my intrusion, but I\r\nwas anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out\r\nor not.”\r\n\r\n“He is really out, sir,” replied Baptistin.\r\n\r\n“Out, even to me?”\r\n\r\n“I know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte,” said\r\nBaptistin; “and I should therefore never think of including him in any\r\ngeneral order.”\r\n\r\n“You are right; and now I wish to see him on an affair of great\r\nimportance. Do you think it will be long before he comes in?”\r\n\r\n“No, I think not, for he ordered his breakfast at ten o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will go and take a turn in the Champs-Élysées, and at ten\r\no’clock I will return here; meanwhile, if the count should come in,\r\nwill you beg him not to go out again without seeing me?”\r\n\r\n“You may depend on my doing so, sir,” said Baptistin.\r\n\r\nAlbert left the cab in which he had come at the count’s door, intending\r\nto take a turn on foot. As he was passing the Allée des Veuves, he\r\nthought he saw the count’s horses standing at Gosset’s\r\nshooting-gallery; he approached, and soon recognized the coachman.\r\n\r\n“Is the count shooting in the gallery?” said Morcerf.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” replied the coachman. While he was speaking, Albert had\r\nheard the report of two or three pistol-shots. He entered, and on his\r\nway met the waiter.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, my lord,” said the lad; “but will you have the kindness to\r\nwait a moment?”\r\n\r\n“What for, Philip?” asked Albert, who, being a constant visitor there,\r\ndid not understand this opposition to his entrance.\r\n\r\n“Because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone, and\r\nnever practices in the presence of anyone.”\r\n\r\n“Not even before you, Philip? Then who loads his pistol?”\r\n\r\n“His servant.”\r\n\r\n“A Nubian?”\r\n\r\n“A negro.”\r\n\r\n“It is he, then.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know this gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and I am come to look for him; he is a friend of mine.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that is quite another thing, then. I will go immediately and\r\ninform him of your arrival.”\r\n\r\nAnd Philip, urged by his own curiosity, entered the gallery; a second\r\nafterwards, Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold.\r\n\r\n“I ask your pardon, my dear count,” said Albert, “for following you\r\nhere, and I must first tell you that it was not the fault of your\r\nservants that I did so; I alone am to blame for the indiscretion. I\r\nwent to your house, and they told me you were out, but that they\r\nexpected you home at ten o’clock to breakfast. I was walking about in\r\norder to pass away the time till ten o’clock, when I caught sight of\r\nyour carriage and horses.”\r\n\r\n“What you have just said induces me to hope that you intend\r\nbreakfasting with me.”\r\n\r\n40092m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No, thank you, I am thinking of other things besides breakfast just\r\nnow; perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse\r\ncompany.”\r\n\r\n“What on earth are you talking of?”\r\n\r\n“I am to fight today.”\r\n\r\n“For what?”\r\n\r\n“For the sake of fighting!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I understand that, but what is the quarrel? People fight for all\r\nsorts of reasons, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I fight in the cause of honor.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that is something serious.”\r\n\r\n“So serious, that I come to beg you to render me a service.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“To be my second.”\r\n\r\n“That is a serious matter, and we will not discuss it here; let us\r\nspeak of nothing till we get home. Ali, bring me some water.”\r\n\r\nThe count turned up his sleeves, and passed into the little vestibule\r\nwhere the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting.\r\n\r\n“Come in, my lord,” said Philip in a low tone, “and I will show you\r\nsomething droll.” Morcerf entered, and in place of the usual target, he\r\nsaw some playing-cards fixed against the wall. At a distance Albert\r\nthought it was a complete suit, for he counted from the ace to the ten.\r\n\r\n“Ah, ha,” said Albert, “I see you were preparing for a game of cards.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the count, “I was making a suit.”\r\n\r\n“How?” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“Those are really aces and twos which you see, but my shots have turned\r\nthem into threes, fives, sevens, eights, nines, and tens.”\r\n\r\nAlbert approached. In fact, the bullets had actually pierced the cards\r\nin the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have\r\noccupied, the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they\r\nhad been ruled with pencil. In going up to the target Morcerf picked up\r\ntwo or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the\r\nrange of the count’s pistol.\r\n\r\n“_Diable!_” said Morcerf.\r\n\r\n“What would you have, my dear viscount?” said Monte Cristo, wiping his\r\nhands on the towel which Ali had brought him; “I must occupy my leisure\r\nmoments in some way or other. But come, I am waiting for you.”\r\n\r\nBoth men entered Monte Cristo’s carriage, which in the course of a few\r\nminutes deposited them safely at No. 30. Monte Cristo took Albert into\r\nhis study, and pointing to a seat, placed another for himself. “Now let\r\nus talk the matter over quietly,” said the count.\r\n\r\n“You see I am perfectly composed,” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“With whom are you going to fight?”\r\n\r\n“With Beauchamp.”\r\n\r\n“One of your friends!”\r\n\r\n“Of course; it is always with friends that one fights.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you have some cause of quarrel?”\r\n\r\n“I have.”\r\n\r\n40094m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What has he done to you?”\r\n\r\n“There appeared in his journal last night—but wait, and read for\r\nyourself.” And Albert handed over the paper to the count, who read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“A correspondent at Yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we\r\nhad remained in ignorance. The castle which formed the protection of\r\nthe town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand,\r\nin whom the grand vizier, Ali Tepelini, had reposed the greatest\r\nconfidence.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Monte Cristo, “what do you see in that to annoy you?”\r\n\r\n“What do I see in it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; what does it signify to you if the castle of Yanina was given up\r\nby a French officer?”\r\n\r\n“It signifies to my father, the Count of Morcerf, whose Christian name\r\nis Fernand!”\r\n\r\n“Did your father serve under Ali Pasha?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; that is to say, he fought for the independence of the Greeks, and\r\nhence arises the calumny.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear viscount, do talk reason!”\r\n\r\n“I do not desire to do otherwise.”\r\n\r\n“Now, just tell me who the devil should know in France that the officer\r\nFernand and the Count of Morcerf are one and the same person? and who\r\ncares now about Yanina, which was taken as long ago as the year 1822 or\r\n1823?”\r\n\r\n“That just shows the meanness of this slander. They have allowed all\r\nthis time to elapse, and then all of a sudden rake up events which have\r\nbeen forgotten to furnish materials for scandal, in order to tarnish\r\nthe lustre of our high position. I inherit my father’s name, and I do\r\nnot choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it. I am going to\r\nBeauchamp, in whose journal this paragraph appears, and I shall insist\r\non his retracting the assertion before two witnesses.”\r\n\r\n“Beauchamp will never retract.”\r\n\r\n“Then we must fight.”\r\n\r\n“No you will not, for he will tell you, what is very true, that perhaps\r\nthere were fifty officers in the Greek army bearing the same name.”\r\n\r\n“We will fight, nevertheless. I will efface that blot on my father’s\r\ncharacter. My father, who was such a brave soldier, whose career was so\r\nbrilliant——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, he will add, ‘We are warranted in believing that this\r\nFernand is not the illustrious Count of Morcerf, who also bears the\r\nsame Christian name.’”\r\n\r\n“I am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire\r\nretractation.”\r\n\r\n“And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses, do\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You do wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Which means, I suppose, that you refuse the service which I asked of\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“You know my theory regarding duels; I told you my opinion on that\r\nsubject, if you remember, when we were at Rome.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, my dear count, I found you this morning engaged in an\r\noccupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to\r\nentertain.”\r\n\r\n“Because, my dear fellow, you understand one must never be eccentric.\r\nIf one’s lot is cast among fools, it is necessary to study folly. I\r\nshall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp,\r\nwho has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with\r\nBeauchamp; he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other, he\r\nwill bring his witnesses, or will insult me in some public place, and I\r\nam expected to kill him for all that.”\r\n\r\n“You admit that you would fight, then? Well, if so, why do you object\r\nto my doing so?”\r\n\r\n“I do not say that you ought not to fight, I only say that a duel is a\r\nserious thing, and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection.”\r\n\r\n“Did he reflect before he insulted my father?”\r\n\r\n“If he spoke hastily, and owns that he did so, you ought to be\r\nsatisfied.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear count, you are far too indulgent.”\r\n\r\n“And you are far too exacting. Supposing, for instance, and do not be\r\nangry at what I am going to say——”\r\n\r\n“Well.”\r\n\r\n“Supposing the assertion to be really true?”\r\n\r\n“A son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father’s honor.”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_ we live in times when there is much to which we must\r\nsubmit.”\r\n\r\n“That is precisely the fault of the age.”\r\n\r\n“And do you undertake to reform it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, as far as I am personally concerned.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you are indeed exacting, my dear fellow!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I own it.”\r\n\r\n“Are you quite impervious to good advice?”\r\n\r\n“Not when it comes from a friend.”\r\n\r\n“And do you account me that title?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I do.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, before going to Beauchamp with your witnesses, seek\r\nfurther information on the subject.”\r\n\r\n“From whom?”\r\n\r\n“From Haydée.”\r\n\r\n“Why, what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair?—what can\r\nshe do in it?”\r\n\r\n“She can declare to you, for example, that your father had no hand\r\nwhatever in the defeat and death of the vizier; or if by chance he had,\r\nindeed, the misfortune to——”\r\n\r\n“I have told you, my dear count, that I would not for one moment admit\r\nof such a proposition.”\r\n\r\n“You reject this means of information, then?”\r\n\r\n“I do—most decidedly.”\r\n\r\n“Then let me offer one more word of advice.”\r\n\r\n“Do so, then, but let it be the last.”\r\n\r\n“You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, I request it.”\r\n\r\n“Do not take any witnesses with you when you go to Beauchamp—visit him\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\n“That would be contrary to all custom.”\r\n\r\n“Your case is not an ordinary one.”\r\n\r\n“And what is your reason for advising me to go alone?”\r\n\r\n“Because then the affair will rest between you and Beauchamp.”\r\n\r\n“Explain yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I will do so. If Beauchamp be disposed to retract, you ought at least\r\nto give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will,—the\r\nsatisfaction to you will be the same. If, on the contrary, he refuses\r\nto do so, it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into\r\nyour secret.”\r\n\r\n“They will not be strangers, they will be friends.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow; Beauchamp,\r\nfor instance.”\r\n\r\n“So you recommend——”\r\n\r\n“I recommend you to be prudent.”\r\n\r\n“Then you advise me to go alone to Beauchamp?”\r\n\r\n“I do, and I will tell you why. When you wish to obtain some concession\r\nfrom a man’s self-love, you must avoid even the appearance of wishing\r\nto wound it.”\r\n\r\n“I believe you are right.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad of it.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will go alone.”\r\n\r\n“Go; but you would do better still by not going at all.”\r\n\r\n“That is impossible.”\r\n\r\n“Do so, then; it will be a wiser plan than the first which you\r\nproposed.”\r\n\r\n“But if, in spite of all my precautions, I am at last obliged to fight,\r\nwill you not be my second?”\r\n\r\n“My dear viscount,” said Monte Cristo gravely, “you must have seen\r\nbefore today that at all times and in all places I have been at your\r\ndisposal, but the service which you have just demanded of me is one\r\nwhich it is out of my power to render you.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you may know at some future period, and in the mean time I\r\nrequest you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my\r\nreasons.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will have Franz and Château-Renaud; they will be the very men\r\nfor it.”\r\n\r\n“Do so, then.”\r\n\r\n“But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or\r\ntwo in shooting and fencing?”\r\n\r\n“That, too, is impossible.”\r\n\r\n“What a singular being you are!—you will not interfere in anything.”\r\n\r\n“You are right—that is the principle on which I wish to act.”\r\n\r\n“We will say no more about it, then. Good-bye, count.”\r\n\r\nMorcerf took his hat, and left the room. He found his carriage at the\r\ndoor, and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to\r\nfind Beauchamp, who was in his office. It was a gloomy, dusty-looking\r\napartment, such as journalists’ offices have always been from time\r\nimmemorial. The servant announced M. Albert de Morcerf. Beauchamp\r\nrepeated the name to himself, as though he could scarcely believe that\r\nhe had heard aright, and then gave orders for him to be admitted.\r\nAlbert entered.\r\n\r\nBeauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap\r\nover and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n“This way, this way, my dear Albert!” said he, holding out his hand to\r\nthe young man. “Are you out of your senses, or do you come peaceably to\r\ntake breakfast with me? Try and find a seat—there is one by that\r\ngeranium, which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there\r\nare other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper.”\r\n\r\n“Beauchamp,” said Albert, “it is of your journal that I come to speak.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? What do you wish to say about it?”\r\n\r\n“I desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified.”\r\n\r\n“To what do you refer? But pray sit down.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Albert, with a cold and formal bow.\r\n\r\n“Will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement\r\nwhich has displeased you?”\r\n\r\n“An announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member\r\nof my family.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” said Beauchamp, much surprised; “surely you must be\r\nmistaken.”\r\n\r\n“The story sent you from Yanina.”\r\n\r\n“Yanina?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which\r\nbrings me here.”\r\n\r\n“Such is really the case, I assure you, upon my honor! Baptiste, give\r\nme yesterday’s paper,” cried Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Here, I have brought mine with me,” replied Albert.\r\n\r\nBeauchamp took the paper, and read the article to which Albert pointed\r\nin an undertone.\r\n\r\n“You see it is a serious annoyance,” said Morcerf, when Beauchamp had\r\nfinished the perusal of the paragraph.\r\n\r\n“Is the officer referred to a relation of yours, then?” demanded the\r\njournalist.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Albert, blushing.\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you wish me to do for you?” said Beauchamp mildly.\r\n\r\n“My dear Beauchamp, I wish you to contradict this statement.” Beauchamp\r\nlooked at Albert with a benevolent expression.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said he, “this matter will want a good deal of talking over; a\r\nretractation is always a serious thing, you know. Sit down, and I will\r\nread it again.”\r\n\r\nAlbert resumed his seat, and Beauchamp read, with more attention than\r\nat first, the lines denounced by his friend.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Albert in a determined tone, “you see that your paper has\r\ninsulted a member of my family, and I insist on a retractation being\r\nmade.”\r\n\r\n“You insist?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I insist.”\r\n\r\n“Permit me to remind you that you are not in the Chamber, my dear\r\nviscount.”\r\n\r\n“Nor do I wish to be there,” replied the young man, rising. “I repeat\r\nthat I am determined to have the announcement of yesterday\r\ncontradicted. You have known me long enough,” continued Albert, biting\r\nhis lips convulsively, for he saw that Beauchamp’s anger was beginning\r\nto rise,—“you have been my friend, and therefore sufficiently intimate\r\nwith me to be aware that I am likely to maintain my resolution on this\r\npoint.”\r\n\r\n“If I have been your friend, Morcerf, your present manner of speaking\r\nwould almost lead me to forget that I ever bore that title. But wait a\r\nmoment, do not let us get angry, or at least not yet. You are irritated\r\nand vexed—tell me how this Fernand is related to you?”\r\n\r\n“He is merely my father,” said Albert—“M. Fernand Mondego, Count of\r\nMorcerf, an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose\r\nhonorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace.”\r\n\r\n“Is it your father?” said Beauchamp; “that is quite another thing. Then\r\nI can well understand your indignation, my dear Albert. I will look at\r\nit again;” and he read the paragraph for the third time, laying a\r\nstress on each word as he proceeded. “But the paper nowhere identifies\r\nthis Fernand with your father.”\r\n\r\n40100m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No; but the connection will be seen by others, and therefore I will\r\nhave the article contradicted.”\r\n\r\nAt the words _I will_, Beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to Albert’s\r\ncountenance, and then as gradually lowering them, he remained\r\nthoughtful for a few moments.\r\n\r\n“You will retract this assertion, will you not, Beauchamp?” said Albert\r\nwith increased though stifled anger.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Immediately?” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“When I am convinced that the statement is false.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“The thing is worth looking into, and I will take pains to investigate\r\nthe matter thoroughly.”\r\n\r\n“But what is there to investigate, sir?” said Albert, enraged beyond\r\nmeasure at Beauchamp’s last remark. “If you do not believe that it is\r\nmy father, say so immediately; and if, on the contrary, you believe it\r\nto be him, state your reasons for doing so.”\r\n\r\nBeauchamp looked at Albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him,\r\nand which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied\r\nemotion of his mind.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied he, “if you came to me with the idea of demanding\r\nsatisfaction, you should have gone at once to the point, and not have\r\nentertained me with the idle conversation to which I have been\r\npatiently listening for the last half hour. Am I to put this\r\nconstruction on your visit?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a moment—no threats, if you please, M. Fernand Mondego, Vicomte\r\nde Morcerf; I never allow them from my enemies, and therefore shall not\r\nput up with them from my friends. You insist on my contradicting the\r\narticle relating to General Fernand, an article with which, I assure\r\nyou on my word of honor, I had nothing whatever to do?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I insist on it,” said Albert, whose mind was beginning to get\r\nbewildered with the excitement of his feelings.\r\n\r\n“And if I refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?” said Beauchamp\r\nin a calm tone.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Albert, raising his voice.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Beauchamp, “here is my answer, my dear sir. The article\r\nwas not inserted by me—I was not even aware of it; but you have, by the\r\nstep you have taken, called my attention to the paragraph in question,\r\nand it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed\r\nby someone who has a right to do so.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Albert, rising, “I will do myself the honor of sending my\r\nseconds to you, and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the\r\nplace of meeting and the weapons.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, my dear sir.”\r\n\r\n“And this evening, if you please, or tomorrow at the latest, we will\r\nmeet.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, I will be on the ground at the proper time; but in my opinion\r\n(and I have a right to dictate the preliminaries, as it is I who have\r\nreceived the provocation)—in my opinion the time ought not to be yet. I\r\nknow you to be well skilled in the management of the sword, while I am\r\nonly moderately so; I know, too, that you are a good marksman—there we\r\nare about equal. I know that a duel between us two would be a serious\r\naffair, because you are brave, and I am brave also. I do not therefore\r\nwish either to kill you, or to be killed myself without a cause. Now, I\r\nam going to put a question to you, and one very much to the purpose\r\ntoo. Do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if I do\r\nnot make it, although I have repeated more than once, and affirmed on\r\nmy honor, that I was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me,\r\nand although I still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you\r\nto recognize the Count of Morcerf under the name of Fernand?”\r\n\r\n“I maintain my original resolution.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, my dear sir; then I consent to cut throats with you. But I\r\nrequire three weeks’ preparation; at the end of that time I shall come\r\nand say to you, ‘The assertion is false, and I retract it,’ or ‘The\r\nassertion is true,’ when I shall immediately draw the sword from its\r\nsheath, or the pistols from the case, whichever you please.”\r\n\r\n“Three weeks!” cried Albert; “they will pass as slowly as three\r\ncenturies when I am all the time suffering dishonor.”\r\n\r\n“Had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me, I should have\r\nsaid, ‘Patience, my friend;’ but you have constituted yourself my\r\nenemy, therefore I say, ‘What does that signify to me, sir?’”\r\n\r\n“Well, let it be three weeks then,” said Morcerf; “but remember, at the\r\nexpiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in——”\r\n\r\n“M. Albert de Morcerf,” said Beauchamp, rising in his turn, “I cannot\r\nthrow you out of window for three weeks—that is to say, for twenty-four\r\ndays to come—nor have you any right to split my skull open till that\r\ntime has elapsed. Today is the 29th of August; the 21st of September\r\nwill, therefore, be the conclusion of the term agreed on, and till that\r\ntime arrives—and it is the advice of a gentleman which I am about to\r\ngive you—till then we will refrain from growling and barking like two\r\ndogs chained within sight of each other.”\r\n\r\nWhen he had concluded his speech, Beauchamp bowed coldly to Albert,\r\nturned his back upon him, and went to the press-room. Albert vented his\r\nanger on a pile of newspapers, which he sent flying all over the office\r\nby switching them violently with his stick; after which ebullition he\r\ndeparted—not, however, without walking several times to the door of the\r\npress-room, as if he had half a mind to enter.\r\n\r\n40104m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner\r\nthat he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his\r\ndiscomfiture, as he was crossing the barrier he perceived Morrel, who\r\nwas walking with a quick step and a bright eye. He was passing the\r\nChinese Baths, and appeared to have come from the direction of the\r\nPorte Saint-Martin, and to be going towards the Madeleine.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Morcerf, “there goes a happy man!” And it so happened Albert\r\nwas not mistaken in his opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 79. The Lemonade\r\n\r\nMorrel was, in fact, very happy. M. Noirtier had just sent for him, and\r\nhe was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not\r\nstopped to take a cab, placing infinitely more dependence on his own\r\ntwo legs than on the four legs of a cab-horse. He had therefore set off\r\nat a furious rate from the Rue Meslay, and was hastening with rapid\r\nstrides in the direction of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.\r\n\r\nMorrel advanced with a firm, manly tread, and poor Barrois followed him\r\nas he best might. Morrel was only thirty-one, Barrois was sixty years\r\nof age; Morrel was deeply in love, and Barrois was dying with heat and\r\nexertion. These two men, thus opposed in age and interests, resembled\r\ntwo parts of a triangle, presenting the extremes of separation, yet\r\nnevertheless possessing their point of union. This point of union was\r\nNoirtier, and it was he who had just sent for Morrel, with the request\r\nthat the latter would lose no time in coming to him—a command which\r\nMorrel obeyed to the letter, to the great discomfiture of Barrois. On\r\narriving at the house, Morrel was not even out of breath, for love\r\nlends wings to our desires; but Barrois, who had long forgotten what it\r\nwas to love, was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been\r\nconstrained to use.\r\n\r\nThe old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance, closed the\r\ndoor of the study, and soon the rustling of a dress announced the\r\narrival of Valentine. She looked marvellously beautiful in her deep\r\nmourning dress, and Morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing\r\nupon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the\r\nconversation of her grandfather.\r\n\r\nBut the easy-chair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor,\r\nand he soon made his appearance in the room. Noirtier acknowledged by a\r\nlook of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which Morrel\r\nlavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of Valentine and\r\nhimself—an intervention which had saved them from despair. Morrel then\r\ncast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he\r\ndesigned to bestow on him. Valentine was sitting at a little distance\r\nfrom them, timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to\r\nspeak. Noirtier fixed his eyes on her.\r\n\r\n“Am I to say what you told me?” asked Valentine. Noirtier made a sign\r\nthat she was to do so.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Morrel,” said Valentine to the young man, who was regarding\r\nher with the most intense interest, “my grandfather, M. Noirtier, had a\r\nthousand things to say, which he told me three days ago; and now, he\r\nhas sent for you, that I may repeat them to you. I will repeat them,\r\nthen; and since he has chosen me as his interpreter, I will be faithful\r\nto the trust, and will not alter a word of his intentions.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am listening with the greatest impatience,” replied the young\r\nman; “speak, I beg of you.”\r\n\r\nValentine cast down her eyes; this was a good omen for Morrel, for he\r\nknew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming\r\nValentine.\r\n\r\n“My grandfather intends leaving this house,” said she, “and Barrois is\r\nlooking out for suitable apartments for him in another.”\r\n\r\n“But you, Mademoiselle de Villefort,—you, who are necessary to M.\r\nNoirtier’s happiness——”\r\n\r\n“I?” interrupted Valentine; “I shall not leave my grandfather,—that is\r\nan understood thing between us. My apartment will be close to his. Now,\r\nM. de Villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his\r\nrefusal; in the first case, I shall leave directly, and in the second,\r\nI shall wait till I am of age, which will be in about ten months. Then\r\nI shall be free, I shall have an independent fortune, and”—\r\n\r\n“And what?” demanded Morrel.\r\n\r\n“And with my grandfather’s consent I shall fulfil the promise which I\r\nhave made you.”\r\n\r\nValentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone, that\r\nnothing but Morrel’s intense interest in what she was saying could have\r\nenabled him to hear them.\r\n\r\n“Have I not explained your wishes, grandpapa?” said Valentine,\r\naddressing Noirtier.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” looked the old man.\r\n\r\n“Once under my grandfather’s roof, M. Morrel can visit me in the\r\npresence of my good and worthy protector, if we still feel that the\r\nunion we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and\r\nhappiness; in that case I shall expect M. Morrel to come and claim me\r\nat my own hands. But, alas, I have heard it said that hearts inflamed\r\nby obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security; I trust we\r\nshall never find it so in our experience!”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried Morrel, almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before\r\nNoirtier and Valentine, and to adore them as two superior beings, “what\r\nhave I ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness?”\r\n\r\n“Until that time,” continued the young girl in a calm and\r\nself-possessed tone of voice, “we will conform to circumstances, and be\r\nguided by the wishes of our friends, so long as those wishes do not\r\ntend finally to separate us; in a word, and I repeat it, because it\r\nexpresses all I wish to convey,—we will wait.”\r\n\r\n“And I swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes, sir,”\r\nsaid Morrel, “not only with resignation, but with cheerfulness.”\r\n\r\n“Therefore,” continued Valentine, looking playfully at Maximilian, “no\r\nmore inconsiderate actions—no more rash projects; for you surely would\r\nnot wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as\r\ndestined, honorably and happily, to bear your name?”\r\n\r\nMorrel looked obedience to her commands. Noirtier regarded the lovers\r\nwith a look of ineffable tenderness, while Barrois, who had remained in\r\nthe room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that\r\npassed, smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from\r\nhis bald forehead.\r\n\r\n“How hot you look, my good Barrois,” said Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I have been running very fast, mademoiselle, but I must do M.\r\nMorrel the justice to say that he ran still faster.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier directed their attention to a waiter, on which was placed a\r\ndecanter containing lemonade and a glass. The decanter was nearly full,\r\nwith the exception of a little, which had been already drunk by M.\r\nNoirtier.\r\n\r\n“Come, Barrois,” said the young girl, “take some of this lemonade; I\r\nsee you are coveting a good draught of it.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is, mademoiselle,” said Barrois, “I am dying with thirst, and\r\nsince you are so kind as to offer it me, I cannot say I should at all\r\nobject to drinking your health in a glass of it.”\r\n\r\n“Take some, then, and come back immediately.”\r\n\r\nBarrois took away the waiter, and hardly was he outside the door, which\r\nin his haste he forgot to shut, than they saw him throw back his head\r\nand empty to the very dregs the glass which Valentine had filled.\r\nValentine and Morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of\r\nNoirtier when a ring was heard at the door-bell. It was the signal of a\r\nvisit. Valentine looked at her watch.\r\n\r\n“It is past noon,” said she, “and today is Saturday; I dare say it is\r\nthe doctor, grandpapa.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition.\r\n\r\n“He will come in here, and M. Morrel had better go,—do you not think\r\nso, grandpapa?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” signed the old man.\r\n\r\n“Barrois,” cried Valentine, “Barrois!”\r\n\r\n“I am coming, mademoiselle,” replied he.\r\n\r\n“Barrois will open the door for you,” said Valentine, addressing\r\nMorrel. “And now remember one thing, Monsieur Officer, that my\r\ngrandfather commands you not to take any rash or ill-advised step which\r\nwould be likely to compromise our happiness.”\r\n\r\n40108m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I promised him to wait,” replied Morrel; “and I will wait.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Barrois entered. “Who rang?” asked Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Doctor d’Avrigny,” said Barrois, staggering as if he would fall.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, Barrois?” said Valentine. The old man did not\r\nanswer, but looked at his master with wild staring eyes, while with his\r\ncramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand\r\nupright.\r\n\r\n“He is going to fall!” cried Morrel.\r\n\r\nThe rigors which had attacked Barrois gradually increased, the features\r\nof the face became quite altered, and the convulsive movement of the\r\nmuscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous\r\ndisorder. Noirtier, seeing Barrois in this pitiable condition, showed\r\nby his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can\r\nanimate the heart of man. Barrois made some steps towards his master.\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir,” said he, “tell me what is the matter with me. I am\r\nsuffering—I cannot see. A thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain.\r\nAh, don’t touch me, pray don’t.”\r\n\r\nBy this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to\r\nstart from their sockets; his head fell back, and the lower extremities\r\nof the body began to stiffen. Valentine uttered a cry of horror; Morrel\r\ntook her in his arms, as if to defend her from some unknown danger.\r\n\r\n“M. d’Avrigny, M. d’Avrigny,” cried she, in a stifled voice. “Help,\r\nhelp!”\r\n\r\nBarrois turned round and with a great effort stumbled a few steps, then\r\nfell at the feet of Noirtier, and resting his hand on the knee of the\r\ninvalid, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“My master, my good master!”\r\n\r\nAt this moment M. de Villefort, attracted by the noise, appeared on the\r\nthreshold. Morrel relaxed his hold of Valentine, and retreating to a\r\ndistant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain. Pale\r\nas if he had been gazing on a serpent, he fixed his terrified eye on\r\nthe agonized sufferer.\r\n\r\nNoirtier, burning with impatience and terror, was in despair at his\r\nutter inability to help his old domestic, whom he regarded more in the\r\nlight of a friend than a servant. One might by the fearful swelling of\r\nthe veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the\r\neye, trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living\r\nenergetic mind and the inanimate and helpless body.\r\n\r\nBarrois, his features convulsed, his eyes suffused with blood, and his\r\nhead thrown back, was lying at full length, beating the floor with his\r\nhands, while his legs had become so stiff, that they looked as if they\r\nwould break rather than bend. A slight appearance of foam was visible\r\naround the mouth, and he breathed painfully, and with extreme\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nVillefort seemed stupefied with astonishment, and remained gazing\r\nintently on the scene before him without uttering a word. He had not\r\nseen Morrel. After a moment of dumb contemplation, during which his\r\nface became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end, he sprang towards\r\nthe door, crying out:\r\n\r\n“Doctor, doctor! come instantly, pray come!”\r\n\r\n“Madame, madame!” cried Valentine, calling her step-mother, and running\r\nupstairs to meet her; “come quick, quick!—and bring your bottle of\r\nsmelling-salts with you.”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” said Madame de Villefort in a harsh and\r\nconstrained tone.\r\n\r\n“Oh! come! come!”\r\n\r\n“But where is the doctor?” exclaimed Villefort; “where is he?”\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort now deliberately descended the staircase. In one\r\nhand she held her handkerchief, with which she appeared to be wiping\r\nher face, and in the other a bottle of English smelling-salts. Her\r\nfirst look on entering the room was at Noirtier, whose face,\r\nindependent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of\r\nproducing, proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health; her\r\nsecond glance was at the dying man. She turned pale, and her eye passed\r\nquickly from the servant and rested on the master.\r\n\r\n“In the name of heaven, madame,” said Villefort, “where is the doctor?\r\nHe was with you just now. You see this is a fit of apoplexy, and he\r\nmight be saved if he could but be bled!”\r\n\r\n“Has he eaten anything lately?” asked Madame de Villefort, eluding her\r\nhusband’s question.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” replied Valentine, “he has not even breakfasted. He has been\r\nrunning very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him,\r\nand when he returned, took nothing but a glass of lemonade.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Madame de Villefort, “why did he not take wine? Lemonade was\r\na very bad thing for him.”\r\n\r\n“Grandpapa’s bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side; poor\r\nBarrois was very thirsty, and was thankful to drink anything he could\r\nfind.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort started. Noirtier looked at her with a glance of\r\nthe most profound scrutiny.\r\n\r\n“He has such a short neck,” said she.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said Villefort, “I ask where is M. d’Avrigny? In God’s name\r\nanswer me!”\r\n\r\n“He is with Edward, who is not quite well,” replied Madame de\r\nVillefort, no longer being able to avoid answering.\r\n\r\nVillefort rushed upstairs to fetch him.\r\n\r\n“Take this,” said Madame de Villefort, giving her smelling-bottle to\r\nValentine. “They will, no doubt, bleed him; therefore I will retire,\r\nfor I cannot endure the sight of blood;” and she followed her husband\r\nupstairs. Morrel now emerged from his hiding-place, where he had\r\nremained quite unperceived, so great had been the general confusion.\r\n\r\n“Go away as quick as you can, Maximilian,” said Valentine, “and stay\r\ntill I send for you. Go.”\r\n\r\nMorrel looked towards Noirtier for permission to retire. The old man,\r\nwho had preserved all his usual coolness, made a sign to him to do so.\r\nThe young man pressed Valentine’s hand to his lips, and then left the\r\nhouse by a back staircase.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment that he quitted the room, Villefort and the doctor\r\nentered by an opposite door. Barrois was now showing signs of returning\r\nconsciousness. The crisis seemed past, a low moaning was heard, and he\r\nraised himself on one knee. D’Avrigny and Villefort laid him on a\r\ncouch.\r\n\r\n“What do you prescribe, doctor?” demanded Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Give me some water and ether. You have some in the house, have you\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic.”\r\n\r\nVillefort immediately despatched a messenger. “And now let everyone\r\nretire.”\r\n\r\n“Must I go too?” asked Valentine timidly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, mademoiselle, you especially,” replied the doctor abruptly.\r\n\r\nValentine looked at M. d’Avrigny with astonishment, kissed her\r\ngrandfather on the forehead, and left the room. The doctor closed the\r\ndoor after her with a gloomy air.\r\n\r\n“Look, look, doctor,” said Villefort, “he is quite coming round again;\r\nI really do not think, after all, it is anything of consequence.”\r\n\r\nM. d’Avrigny answered by a melancholy smile.\r\n\r\n“How do you feel, Barrois?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“A little better, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Will you drink some of this ether and water?”\r\n\r\n“I will try; but don’t touch me.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because I feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your\r\nfinger the fit would return.”\r\n\r\n“Drink.”\r\n\r\nBarrois took the glass, and, raising it to his purple lips, took about\r\nhalf of the liquid offered him.\r\n\r\n“Where do you suffer?” asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n“Everywhere. I feel cramps over my whole body.”\r\n\r\n“Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Any noise in the ears?”\r\n\r\n“Frightful.”\r\n\r\n40112m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“When did you first feel that?”\r\n\r\n“Just now.”\r\n\r\n“Suddenly?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, like a clap of thunder.”\r\n\r\n“Did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“No drowsiness?”\r\n\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\n“What have you eaten today?”\r\n\r\n“I have eaten nothing; I only drank a glass of my master’s\r\nlemonade—that’s all.” And Barrois turned towards Noirtier, who,\r\nimmovably fixed in his armchair, was contemplating this terrible scene\r\nwithout allowing a word or a movement to escape him.\r\n\r\n“Where is this lemonade?” asked the doctor eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Downstairs in the decanter.”\r\n\r\n“Whereabouts downstairs?”\r\n\r\n“In the kitchen.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I go and fetch it, doctor?” inquired Villefort.\r\n\r\n“No, stay here and try to make Barrois drink the rest of this glass of\r\nether and water. I will go myself and fetch the lemonade.”\r\n\r\nD’Avrigny bounded towards the door, flew down the back staircase, and\r\nalmost knocked down Madame de Villefort, in his haste, who was herself\r\ngoing down to the kitchen. She cried out, but d’Avrigny paid no\r\nattention to her; possessed with but one idea, he cleared the last four\r\nsteps with a bound, and rushed into the kitchen, where he saw the\r\ndecanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter, where it\r\nhad been left. He darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey.\r\nPanting with loss of breath, he returned to the room he had just left.\r\nMadame de Villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“Is this the decanter you spoke of?” asked d’Avrigny.\r\n\r\n“Yes, doctor.”\r\n\r\n“Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?”\r\n\r\n“I believe so.”\r\n\r\n“What did it taste like?”\r\n\r\n“It had a bitter taste.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand,\r\nput his lips to it, and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does\r\nwhen he is tasting wine, he spat the liquor into the fireplace.\r\n\r\n“It is no doubt the same,” said he. “Did you drink some too, M.\r\nNoirtier?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And did you also discover a bitter taste?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, doctor,” cried Barrois, “the fit is coming on again. Oh, do\r\nsomething for me.” The doctor flew to his patient.\r\n\r\n“That emetic, Villefort—see if it is coming.”\r\n\r\nVillefort sprang into the passage, exclaiming, “The emetic! the\r\nemetic!—is it come yet?” No one answered. The most profound terror\r\nreigned throughout the house.\r\n\r\n“If I had anything by means of which I could inflate the lungs,” said\r\nd’Avrigny, looking around him, “perhaps I might prevent suffocation.\r\nBut there is nothing which would do!—nothing!”\r\n\r\n40114m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir,” cried Barrois, “are you going to let me die without help?\r\nOh, I am dying! Oh, save me!”\r\n\r\n“A pen, a pen!” said the doctor. There was one lying on the table; he\r\nendeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient, who, in the\r\nmidst of his convulsions, was making vain attempts to vomit; but the\r\njaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them. This second\r\nattack was much more violent than the first, and he had slipped from\r\nthe couch to the ground, where he was writhing in agony. The doctor\r\nleft him in this paroxysm, knowing that he could do nothing to\r\nalleviate it, and, going up to Noirtier, said abruptly:\r\n\r\n“How do you find yourself?—well?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any weight on the chest; or does your stomach feel light and\r\ncomfortable—eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the\r\ndose which I am accustomed to give you every Sunday?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Did Barrois make your lemonade?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Was it you who asked him to drink some of it?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Was it M. de Villefort?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Madame?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“It was your granddaughter, then, was it not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nA groan from Barrois, accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack the\r\nvery jawbones, attracted the attention of M. d’Avrigny; he left M.\r\nNoirtier, and returned to the sick man.\r\n\r\n“Barrois,” said the doctor, “can you speak?” Barrois muttered a few\r\nunintelligible words. “Try and make an effort to do so, my good man.”\r\nsaid d’Avrigny. Barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes.\r\n\r\n“Who made the lemonade?”\r\n\r\n“I did.”\r\n\r\n“Did you bring it to your master directly it was made?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“You left it somewhere, then, in the meantime?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I left it in the pantry, because I was called away.”\r\n\r\n“Who brought it into this room, then?”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle Valentine.” D’Avrigny struck his forehead with his hand.\r\n\r\n“Gracious heaven,” exclaimed he.\r\n\r\n“Doctor, doctor!” cried Barrois, who felt another fit coming.\r\n\r\n“Will they never bring that emetic?” asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n“Here is a glass with one already prepared,” said Villefort, entering\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n“Who prepared it?”\r\n\r\n“The chemist who came here with me.”\r\n\r\n40116m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Drink it,” said the doctor to Barrois.\r\n\r\n“Impossible, doctor; it is too late; my throat is closing up. I am\r\nchoking! Oh, my heart! Ah, my head!—Oh, what agony!—Shall I suffer like\r\nthis long?”\r\n\r\n“No, no, friend,” replied the doctor, “you will soon cease to suffer.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I understand you,” said the unhappy man. “My God, have mercy upon\r\nme!” and, uttering a fearful cry, Barrois fell back as if he had been\r\nstruck by lightning. D’Avrigny put his hand to his heart, and placed a\r\nglass before his lips.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets.”\r\n\r\nVillefort went immediately.\r\n\r\n“Do not be alarmed, M. Noirtier,” said d’Avrigny; “I am going to take\r\nmy patient into the next room to bleed him; this sort of attack is very\r\nfrightful to witness.”\r\n\r\nAnd taking Barrois under the arms, he dragged him into an adjoining\r\nroom; but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade.\r\nNoirtier closed his right eye.\r\n\r\n“You want Valentine, do you not? I will tell them to send her to you.”\r\n\r\nVillefort returned, and d’Avrigny met him in the passage.\r\n\r\n“Well, how is he now?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“Come in here,” said d’Avrigny, and he took him into the chamber where\r\nthe sick man lay.\r\n\r\n“Is he still in a fit?” said the procureur.\r\n\r\n“He is dead.”\r\n\r\nVillefort drew back a few steps, and, clasping his hands, exclaimed,\r\nwith real amazement and sympathy, “Dead?—and so soon too!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is very soon,” said the doctor, looking at the corpse before\r\nhim; “but that ought not to astonish you; Monsieur and Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran died as soon. People die very suddenly in your house, M. de\r\nVillefort.”\r\n\r\n“What?” cried the magistrate, with an accent of horror and\r\nconsternation, “are you still harping on that terrible idea?”\r\n\r\n“Still, sir; and I shall always do so,” replied d’Avrigny, “for it has\r\nnever for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind; and that\r\nyou may be quite sure I am not mistaken this time, listen well to what\r\nI am going to say, M. de Villefort.”\r\n\r\nThe magistrate trembled convulsively.\r\n\r\n“There is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any\r\nperceptible traces. I know it well; I have studied it in all its forms\r\nand in the effects which it produces. I recognized the presence of this\r\npoison in the case of poor Barrois as well as in that of Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran. There is a way of detecting its presence. It restores the\r\nblue color of litmus-paper reddened by an acid, and it turns syrup of\r\nviolets green. We have no litmus-paper, but, see, here they come with\r\nthe syrup of violets.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor was right; steps were heard in the passage. M. d’Avrigny\r\nopened the door, and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which\r\ncontained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup, he then carefully closed\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n“Look,” said he to the procureur, whose heart beat so loudly that it\r\nmight almost be heard, “here is in this cup some syrup of violets, and\r\nthis decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which M.\r\nNoirtier and Barrois partook. If the lemonade be pure and inoffensive,\r\nthe syrup will retain its color; if, on the contrary, the lemonade be\r\ndrugged with poison, the syrup will become green. Look closely!”\r\n\r\nThe doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the\r\ndecanter into the cup, and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began\r\nto form at the bottom of the cup; this sediment first took a blue\r\nshade, then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal, and\r\nfrom opal to emerald. Arrived at this last hue, it changed no more. The\r\nresult of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind.\r\n\r\n“The unfortunate Barrois has been poisoned,” said d’Avrigny, “and I\r\nwill maintain this assertion before God and man.”\r\n\r\nVillefort said nothing, but he clasped his hands, opened his haggard\r\neyes, and, overcome with his emotion, sank into a chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 80. The Accusation\r\n\r\nM. d’Avrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness, who had\r\nlooked like a second corpse in that chamber of death.\r\n\r\n“Oh, death is in my house!” cried Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Say, rather, crime!” replied the doctor.\r\n\r\n“M. d’Avrigny,” cried Villefort, “I cannot tell you all I feel at this\r\nmoment,—terror, grief, madness.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said M. d’Avrigny, with an imposing calmness, “but I think it is\r\nnow time to act. I think it is time to stop this torrent of mortality.\r\nI can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the\r\nhope of seeing the victims and society generally revenged.”\r\n\r\nVillefort cast a gloomy look around him. “In my house,” murmured he,\r\n“in my house!”\r\n\r\n“Come, magistrate,” said M. d’Avrigny, “show yourself a man; as an\r\ninterpreter of the law, do honor to your profession by sacrificing your\r\nselfish interests to it.”\r\n\r\n“You make me shudder, doctor. Do you talk of a sacrifice?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“Do you then suspect anyone?”\r\n\r\n“I suspect no one; death raps at your door—it enters—it goes, not\r\nblindfolded, but circumspectly, from room to room. Well, I follow its\r\ncourse, I track its passage; I adopt the wisdom of the ancients, and\r\nfeel my way, for my friendship for your family and my respect for you\r\nare as a twofold bandage over my eyes; well——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, speak, speak, doctor; I shall have courage.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, you have in your establishment, or in your family, perhaps,\r\none of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only\r\none. Locusta and Agrippina, living at the same time, were an exception,\r\nand proved the determination of Providence to effect the entire ruin of\r\nthe Roman empire, sullied by so many crimes. Brunhilda and Fredegund\r\nwere the results of the painful struggle of civilization in its\r\ninfancy, when man was learning to control mind, were it even by an\r\nemissary from the realms of darkness. All these women had been, or\r\nwere, beautiful. The same flower of innocence had flourished, or was\r\nstill flourishing, on their brow, that is seen on the brow of the\r\nculprit in your house.”\r\n\r\n40120m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVillefort shrieked, clasped his hands, and looked at the doctor with a\r\nsupplicating air. But the latter went on without pity:\r\n\r\n“‘Seek whom the crime will profit,’ says an axiom of jurisprudence.”\r\n\r\n“Doctor,” cried Villefort, “alas, doctor, how often has man’s justice\r\nbeen deceived by those fatal words. I know not why, but I feel that\r\nthis crime——”\r\n\r\n“You acknowledge, then, the existence of the crime?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I see too plainly that it does exist. But it seems that it is\r\nintended to affect me personally. I fear an attack myself, after all\r\nthese disasters.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, man!” murmured d’Avrigny, “the most selfish of all animals, the\r\nmost personal of all creatures, who believes the earth turns, the sun\r\nshines, and death strikes for him alone,—an ant cursing God from the\r\ntop of a blade of grass! And have those who have lost their lives lost\r\nnothing?—M. de Saint-Méran, Madame de Saint-Méran, M. Noirtier——”\r\n\r\n“How? M. Noirtier?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; think you it was the poor servant’s life was coveted? No, no;\r\nlike Shakespeare’s Polonius, he died for another. It was Noirtier the\r\nlemonade was intended for—it is Noirtier, logically speaking, who drank\r\nit. The other drank it only by accident, and, although Barrois is dead,\r\nit was Noirtier whose death was wished for.”\r\n\r\n“But why did it not kill my father?”\r\n\r\n“I told you one evening in the garden after Madame de Saint-Méran’s\r\ndeath—because his system is accustomed to that very poison, and the\r\ndose was trifling to him, which would be fatal to another; because no\r\none knows, not even the assassin, that, for the last twelve months, I\r\nhave given M. Noirtier brucine for his paralytic affection, while the\r\nassassin is not ignorant, for he has proved that brucine is a violent\r\npoison.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, have pity—have pity!” murmured Villefort, wringing his hands.\r\n\r\n“Follow the culprit’s steps; he first kills M. de Saint-Méran——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, doctor!”\r\n\r\n“I would swear to it; what I heard of his symptoms agrees too well with\r\nwhat I have seen in the other cases.” Villefort ceased to contend; he\r\nonly groaned. “He first kills M. de Saint-Méran,” repeated the doctor,\r\n“then Madame de Saint-Méran,—a double fortune to inherit.” Villefort\r\nwiped the perspiration from his forehead. “Listen attentively.”\r\n\r\n“Alas,” stammered Villefort, “I do not lose a single word.”\r\n\r\n“M. Noirtier,” resumed M. d’Avrigny in the same pitiless tone,—“M.\r\nNoirtier had once made a will against you—against your family—in favor\r\nof the poor, in fact; M. Noirtier is spared, because nothing is\r\nexpected from him. But he has no sooner destroyed his first will and\r\nmade a second, than, for fear he should make a third, he is struck\r\ndown. The will was made the day before yesterday, I believe; you see\r\nthere has been no time lost.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, mercy, M. d’Avrigny!”\r\n\r\n“No mercy, sir! The physician has a sacred mission on earth; and to\r\nfulfil it he begins at the source of life, and goes down to the\r\nmysterious darkness of the tomb. When crime has been committed, and\r\nGod, doubtless in anger, turns away his face, it is for the physician\r\nto bring the culprit to justice.”\r\n\r\n40122m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Have mercy on my child, sir,” murmured Villefort.\r\n\r\n“You see it is yourself who have first named her—you, her father.”\r\n\r\n“Have pity on Valentine! Listen, it is impossible. I would as willingly\r\naccuse myself! Valentine, whose heart is pure as a diamond or a lily!”\r\n\r\n“No pity, procureur; the crime is fragrant. Mademoiselle herself packed\r\nall the medicines which were sent to M. de Saint-Méran; and M. de\r\nSaint-Méran is dead. Mademoiselle de Villefort prepared all the cooling\r\ndraughts which Madame de Saint-Méran took, and Madame de Saint-Méran is\r\ndead. Mademoiselle de Villefort took from the hands of Barrois, who was\r\nsent out, the lemonade which M. Noirtier had every morning, and he has\r\nescaped by a miracle. Mademoiselle de Villefort is the culprit—she is\r\nthe poisoner! To you, as the king’s attorney, I denounce Mademoiselle\r\nde Villefort, do your duty.”\r\n\r\n“Doctor, I resist no longer—I can no longer defend myself—I believe\r\nyou; but, for pity’s sake, spare my life, my honor!”\r\n\r\n“M. de Villefort,” replied the doctor, with increased vehemence, “there\r\nare occasions when I dispense with all foolish human circumspection. If\r\nyour daughter had committed only one crime, and I saw her meditating\r\nanother, I would say ‘Warn her, punish her, let her pass the remainder\r\nof her life in a convent, weeping and praying.’ If she had committed\r\ntwo crimes, I would say, ‘Here, M. de Villefort, is a poison that the\r\nprisoner is not acquainted with,—one that has no known antidote, quick\r\nas thought, rapid as lightning, mortal as the thunderbolt; give her\r\nthat poison, recommending her soul to God, and save your honor and your\r\nlife, for it is yours she aims at; and I can picture her approaching\r\nyour pillow with her hypocritical smiles and her sweet exhortations.\r\nWoe to you, M. de Villefort, if you do not strike first!’ This is what\r\nI would say had she only killed two persons but she has seen three\r\ndeaths,—has contemplated three murdered persons,—has knelt by three\r\ncorpses! To the scaffold with the poisoner—to the scaffold! Do you talk\r\nof your honor? Do what I tell you, and immortality awaits you!”\r\n\r\nVillefort fell on his knees.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said he; “I have not the strength of mind you have, or rather\r\nthat which you would not have, if instead of my daughter Valentine your\r\ndaughter Madeleine were concerned.” The doctor turned pale. “Doctor,\r\nevery son of woman is born to suffer and to die; I am content to suffer\r\nand to await death.”\r\n\r\n“Beware,” said M. d’Avrigny, “it may come slowly; you will see it\r\napproach after having struck your father, your wife, perhaps your son.”\r\n\r\nVillefort, suffocating, pressed the doctor’s arm.\r\n\r\n40124m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Listen,” cried he; “pity me—help me! No, my daughter is not guilty. If\r\nyou drag us both before a tribunal I will still say, ‘No, my daughter\r\nis not guilty;—there is no crime in my house. I will not acknowledge a\r\ncrime in my house; for when crime enters a dwelling, it is like\r\ndeath—it does not come alone.’ Listen. What does it signify to you if I\r\nam murdered? Are you my friend? Are you a man? Have you a heart? No,\r\nyou are a physician! Well, I tell you I will not drag my daughter\r\nbefore a tribunal, and give her up to the executioner! The bare idea\r\nwould kill me—would drive me like a madman to dig my heart out with my\r\nfinger-nails! And if you were mistaken, doctor—if it were not my\r\ndaughter—if I should come one day, pale as a spectre, and say to you,\r\n‘Assassin, you have killed my child!’—hold—if that should happen,\r\nalthough I am a Christian, M. d’Avrigny, I should kill myself.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the doctor, after a moment’s silence, “I will wait.”\r\n\r\nVillefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words.\r\n\r\n“Only,” continued M. d’Avrigny, with a slow and solemn tone, “if anyone\r\nfalls ill in your house, if you feel yourself attacked, do not send for\r\nme, for I will come no more. I will consent to share this dreadful\r\nsecret with you, but I will not allow shame and remorse to grow and\r\nincrease in my conscience, as crime and misery will in your house.”\r\n\r\n“Then you abandon me, doctor?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for I can follow you no farther, and I only stop at the foot of\r\nthe scaffold. Some further discovery will be made, which will bring\r\nthis dreadful tragedy to a close. Adieu.”\r\n\r\n“I entreat you, doctor!”\r\n\r\n“All the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and\r\nfatal. Adieu, sir.”\r\n\r\n“One word—one single word more, doctor! You go, leaving me in all the\r\nhorror of my situation, after increasing it by what you have revealed\r\nto me. But what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old\r\nservant?”\r\n\r\n“True,” said M. d’Avrigny; “we will return.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor went out first, followed by M. de Villefort. The terrified\r\nservants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would\r\npass.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said d’Avrigny to Villefort, so loud that all might hear, “poor\r\nBarrois has led too sedentary a life of late; accustomed formerly to\r\nride on horseback, or in the carriage, to the four corners of Europe,\r\nthe monotonous walk around that armchair has killed him—his blood has\r\nthickened. He was stout, had a short, thick neck; he was attacked with\r\napoplexy, and I was called in too late. By the way,” added he in a low\r\ntone, “take care to throw away that cup of syrup of violets in the\r\nashes.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor, without shaking hands with Villefort, without adding a word\r\nto what he had said, went out, amid the tears and lamentations of the\r\nwhole household. The same evening all Villefort’s servants, who had\r\nassembled in the kitchen, and had a long consultation, came to tell\r\nMadame de Villefort that they wished to leave. No entreaty, no\r\nproposition of increased wages, could induce them to remain; to every\r\nargument they replied, “We must go, for death is in this house.”\r\n\r\nThey all left, in spite of prayers and entreaties, testifying their\r\nregret at leaving so good a master and mistress, and especially\r\nMademoiselle Valentine, so good, so kind, and so gentle.\r\n\r\nVillefort looked at Valentine as they said this. She was in tears, and,\r\nstrange as it was, in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of\r\nthese tears, he looked also at Madame de Villefort, and it appeared to\r\nhim as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips, like a\r\nmeteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 81. The Room of the Retired Baker\r\n\r\nThe evening of the day on which the Count of Morcerf had left Danglars’\r\nhouse with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the\r\nprojected alliance, M. Andrea Cavalcanti, with curled hair, moustaches\r\nin perfect order, and white gloves which fitted admirably, had entered\r\nthe courtyard of the banker’s house in Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin. He\r\nhad not been more than ten minutes in the drawing-room before he drew\r\nDanglars aside into the recess of a bow-window, and, after an ingenious\r\npreamble, related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble\r\nfather’s departure. He acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been\r\nshown him by the banker’s family, in which he had been received as a\r\nson, and where, besides, his warmest affections had found an object on\r\nwhich to centre in Mademoiselle Danglars.\r\n\r\nDanglars listened with the most profound attention; he had expected\r\nthis declaration for the last two or three days, and when at last it\r\ncame his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to\r\nMorcerf. He would not, however, yield immediately to the young man’s\r\nrequest, but made a few conscientious objections.\r\n\r\n“Are you not rather young, M. Andrea, to think of marrying?”\r\n\r\n“I think not, sir,” replied M. Cavalcanti; “in Italy the nobility\r\ngenerally marry young. Life is so uncertain, that we ought to secure\r\nhappiness while it is within our reach.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” said Danglars, “in case your proposals, which do me honor,\r\nare accepted by my wife and daughter, by whom shall the preliminary\r\narrangements be settled? So important a negotiation should, I think, be\r\nconducted by the respective fathers of the young people.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, my father is a man of great foresight and prudence. Thinking that\r\nI might wish to settle in France, he left me at his departure, together\r\nwith the papers establishing my identity, a letter promising, if he\r\napproved of my choice, 150,000 livres per annum from the day I was\r\nmarried. So far as I can judge, I suppose this to be a quarter of my\r\nfather’s revenue.”\r\n\r\n“I,” said Danglars, “have always intended giving my daughter 500,000\r\nfrancs as her dowry; she is, besides, my sole heiress.”\r\n\r\n“All would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are\r\nwilling. We should command an annuity of 175,000 livres. Supposing,\r\nalso, I should persuade the marquis to give me my capital, which is not\r\nlikely, but still is possible, we would place these two or three\r\nmillions in your hands, whose talent might make it realize ten per\r\ncent.”\r\n\r\n“I never give more than four per cent, and generally only three and a\r\nhalf; but to my son-in-law I would give five, and we would share the\r\nprofits.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, father-in-law,” said Cavalcanti, yielding to his low-born\r\nnature, which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss\r\nwith which he sought to conceal it. Correcting himself immediately, he\r\nsaid, “Excuse me, sir; hope alone makes me almost mad,—what will not\r\nreality do?”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Danglars, who, on his part, did not perceive how soon the\r\nconversation, which was at first disinterested, was turning to a\r\nbusiness transaction, “there is, doubtless, a part of your fortune your\r\nfather could not refuse you?”\r\n\r\n“Which?” asked the young man.\r\n\r\n“That you inherit from your mother.”\r\n\r\n“Truly, from my mother, Leonora Corsinari.”\r\n\r\n“How much may it amount to?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir,” said Andrea, “I assure you I have never given the\r\nsubject a thought, but I suppose it must have been at least two\r\nmillions.”\r\n\r\nDanglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost\r\ntreasure, or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid\r\nground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” said Andrea, bowing to the banker respectfully, “may I\r\nhope?”\r\n\r\n“You may not only hope,” said Danglars, “but consider it a settled\r\nthing, if no obstacle arises on your part.”\r\n\r\n“I am, indeed, rejoiced,” said Andrea.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Danglars thoughtfully, “how is it that your patron, M. de\r\nMonte Cristo, did not make his proposal for you?”\r\n\r\nAndrea blushed imperceptibly.\r\n\r\n“I have just left the count, sir,” said he; “he is, doubtless, a\r\ndelightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas. He esteems me\r\nhighly. He even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father\r\nwould give me the capital instead of the interest of my property. He\r\nhas promised to use his influence to obtain it for me; but he also\r\ndeclared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of\r\nmaking proposals for another, and he never would. I must, however, do\r\nhim the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the\r\nrepugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion, because he\r\nthought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one. Besides,\r\nif he will do nothing officially, he will answer any questions you\r\npropose to him. And now,” continued he, with one of his most charming\r\nsmiles, “having finished talking to the father-in-law, I must address\r\nmyself to the banker.”\r\n\r\n“And what may you have to say to him?” said Danglars, laughing in his\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n“That the day after tomorrow I shall have to draw upon you for about\r\nfour thousand francs; but the count, expecting my bachelor’s revenue\r\ncould not suffice for the coming month’s outlay, has offered me a draft\r\nfor twenty thousand francs. It bears his signature, as you see, which\r\nis all-sufficient.”\r\n\r\n“Bring me a million such as that,” said Danglars, “I shall be well\r\npleased,” putting the draft in his pocket. “Fix your own hour for\r\ntomorrow, and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty\r\nthousand francs.”\r\n\r\n“At ten o’clock then, if you please; I should like it early, as I am\r\ngoing into the country tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, at ten o’clock; you are still at the Hôtel des Princes?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThe following morning, with the banker’s usual punctuality, the eighty\r\nthousand francs were placed in the young man’s hands, as he was on the\r\npoint of starting, after having left two hundred francs for Caderousse.\r\nHe went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy, and returned as late\r\nas possible in the evening.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him\r\nwith a parcel in his hand.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he, “that man has been here.”\r\n\r\n“What man?” said Andrea carelessly, apparently forgetting him whom he\r\nbut too well recollected.\r\n\r\n“Him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Andrea, “my father’s old servant. Well, you gave him the two\r\nhundred francs I had left for him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your excellency.” Andrea had expressed a wish to be thus\r\naddressed. “But,” continued the porter, “he would not take them.”\r\n\r\nAndrea turned pale, but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible.\r\n“What? he would not take them?” said he with slight emotion.\r\n\r\n40130m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No, he wished to speak to your excellency; I told him you were gone\r\nout, and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter,\r\nwhich he had brought with him already sealed.”\r\n\r\n“Give it me,” said Andrea, and he read by the light of his\r\ncarriage-lamp:\r\n\r\n“‘You know where I live; I expect you tomorrow morning at nine\r\no’clock.’”\r\n\r\nAndrea examined it carefully, to ascertain if the letter had been\r\nopened, or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents; but it was so\r\ncarefully folded, that no one could have read it, and the seal was\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said he. “Poor man, he is a worthy creature.” He left the\r\nporter to ponder on these words, not knowing which most to admire, the\r\nmaster or the servant.\r\n\r\n“Take out the horses quickly, and come up to me,” said Andrea to his\r\ngroom. In two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt\r\nCaderousse’s letter. The servant entered just as he had finished.\r\n\r\n“You are about my height, Pierre,” said he.\r\n\r\n“I have that honor, your excellency.”\r\n\r\n“You had a new livery yesterday?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening, and\r\ndo not wish to be known; lend me your livery till tomorrow. I may\r\nsleep, perhaps, at an inn.”\r\n\r\nPierre obeyed. Five minutes after, Andrea left the hotel, completely\r\ndisguised, took a cabriolet, and ordered the driver to take him to the\r\nCheval Rouge, at Picpus. The next morning he left that inn as he had\r\nleft the Hôtel des Princes, without being noticed, walked down the\r\nFaubourg Saint-Antoine, along the boulevard to Rue Ménilmontant, and\r\nstopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone\r\nof whom to make inquiry in the porter’s absence.\r\n\r\n“For whom are you looking, my fine fellow?” asked the fruiteress on the\r\nopposite side.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Pailletin, if you please, my good woman,” replied Andrea.\r\n\r\n“A retired baker?” asked the fruiteress.\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\n“He lives at the end of the yard, on the left, on the third story.”\r\n\r\n40132m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrea went as she directed him, and on the third floor he found a\r\nhare’s paw, which, by the hasty ringing of the bell, it was evident he\r\npulled with considerable ill-temper. A moment after Caderousse’s face\r\nappeared at the grating in the door.\r\n\r\n“Ah! you are punctual,” said he, as he drew back the door.\r\n\r\n“Confound you and your punctuality!” said Andrea, throwing himself into\r\na chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at\r\nthe head of his host.\r\n\r\n“Come, come, my little fellow, don’t be angry. See, I have thought\r\nabout you—look at the good breakfast we are going to have; nothing but\r\nwhat you are fond of.”\r\n\r\nAndrea, indeed, inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not\r\nunwelcome to him, hungry as he was; it was that mixture of fat and\r\ngarlic peculiar to Provençal kitchens of an inferior order, added to\r\nthat of dried fish, and above all, the pungent smell of musk and\r\ncloves. These odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and\r\nplaced on a stove, and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot. In\r\nan adjoining room Andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for\r\ntwo, two bottles of wine sealed, the one with green, the other with\r\nyellow, a supply of brandy in a decanter, and a measure of fruit in a\r\ncabbage-leaf, cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of it, my little fellow?” said Caderousse. “Ay, that\r\nsmells good! You know I used to be a good cook; do you recollect how\r\nyou used to lick your fingers? You were among the first who tasted any\r\nof my dishes, and I think you relished them tolerably.” While speaking,\r\nCaderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Andrea, ill-temperedly, “by my faith, if it was only to\r\nbreakfast with you, that you disturbed me, I wish the devil had taken\r\nyou!”\r\n\r\n“My boy,” said Caderousse sententiously, “one can talk while eating.\r\nAnd then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old\r\nfriend? I am weeping with joy.”\r\n\r\nHe was truly crying, but it would have been difficult to say whether\r\njoy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands\r\nof the old innkeeper of the Pont-du-Gard.\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue, hypocrite,” said Andrea; “you love me!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do, or may the devil take me. I know it is a weakness,” said\r\nCaderousse, “but it overpowers me.”\r\n\r\n“And yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some\r\ntrick.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Caderousse, wiping his large knife on his apron, “if I did\r\nnot like you, do you think I should endure the wretched life you lead\r\nme? Think for a moment. You have your servant’s clothes on—you\r\ntherefore keep a servant; I have none, and am obliged to prepare my own\r\nmeals. You abuse my cookery because you dine at the table d’hôte of the\r\nHôtel des Princes, or the Café de Paris. Well, I too could keep a\r\nservant; I too could have a tilbury; I too could dine where I like; but\r\nwhy do I not? Because I would not annoy my little Benedetto. Come, just\r\nacknowledge that I could, eh?”\r\n\r\nThis address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult\r\nto understand.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Andrea, “admitting your love, why do you want me to\r\nbreakfast with you?”\r\n\r\n“That I may have the pleasure of seeing you, my little fellow.”\r\n\r\n“What is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements?”\r\n\r\n“Eh, dear friend,” said Caderousse, “are wills ever made without\r\ncodicils? But you first came to breakfast, did you not? Well, sit down,\r\nand let us begin with these pilchards, and this fresh butter; which I\r\nhave put on some vine-leaves to please you, wicked one. Ah, yes; you\r\nlook at my room, my four straw chairs, my images, three francs each.\r\nBut what do you expect? This is not the Hôtel des Princes.”\r\n\r\n“Come, you are growing discontented, you are no longer happy; you, who\r\nonly wish to live like a retired baker.”\r\n\r\nCaderousse sighed.\r\n\r\n“Well, what have you to say? you have seen your dream realized.”\r\n\r\n“I can still say it is a dream; a retired baker, my poor Benedetto, is\r\nrich—he has an annuity.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you have an annuity.”\r\n\r\n“I have?”\r\n\r\n40134m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes, since I bring you your two hundred francs.”\r\n\r\nCaderousse shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“It is humiliating,” said he, “thus to receive money given\r\ngrudgingly,—an uncertain supply which may soon fail. You see I am\r\nobliged to economize, in case your prosperity should cease. Well, my\r\nfriend, fortune is inconstant, as the chaplain of the regiment said. I\r\nknow your prosperity is great, you rascal; you are to marry the\r\ndaughter of Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“What? of Danglars?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, to be sure; must I say Baron Danglars? I might as well say Count\r\nBenedetto. He was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a\r\nmemory he ought to invite me to your wedding, seeing he came to mine.\r\nYes, yes, to mine; gad, he was not so proud then,—he was an under-clerk\r\nto the good M. Morrel. I have dined many times with him and the Count\r\nof Morcerf, so you see I have some high connections and were I to\r\ncultivate them a little, we might meet in the same drawing-rooms.”\r\n\r\n“Come, your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light.”\r\n\r\n“That is all very fine, Benedetto mio, but I know what I am saying.\r\nPerhaps I may one day put on my best coat, and presenting myself at the\r\ngreat gate, introduce myself. Meanwhile let us sit down and eat.”\r\n\r\nCaderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good\r\nappetite, praising each dish he set before his visitor. The latter\r\nseemed to have resigned himself; he drew the corks, and partook largely\r\nof the fish with the garlic and fat.\r\n\r\n“Ah, mate,” said Caderousse, “you are getting on better terms with your\r\nold landlord!”\r\n\r\n“Faith, yes,” replied Andrea, whose hunger prevailed over every other\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n“So you like it, you rogue?”\r\n\r\n“So much that I wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard\r\nliving.”\r\n\r\n“Do you see,” said Caderousse, “all my happiness is marred by one\r\nthought?”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“That I am dependent on another, I who have always gained my own\r\nlivelihood honestly.”\r\n\r\n“Do not let that disturb you, I have enough for two.”\r\n\r\n“No, truly; you may believe me if you will; at the end of every month I\r\nam tormented by remorse.”\r\n\r\n“Good Caderousse!”\r\n\r\n“So much so, that yesterday I would not take the two hundred francs.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you wished to speak to me; but was it indeed remorse, tell me?”\r\n\r\n“True remorse; and, besides, an idea had struck me.”\r\n\r\nAndrea shuddered; he always did so at Caderousse’s ideas.\r\n\r\n“It is miserable—do you see?—always to wait till the end of the month.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Andrea philosophically, determined to watch his companion\r\nnarrowly, “does not life pass in waiting? Do I, for instance, fare\r\nbetter? Well, I wait patiently, do I not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs, you\r\nexpect five or six thousand, perhaps ten, perhaps even twelve, for you\r\ntake care not to let anyone know the utmost. Down there, you always had\r\nlittle presents and Christmas-boxes, which you tried to hide from your\r\npoor friend Caderousse. Fortunately he is a cunning fellow, that friend\r\nCaderousse.”\r\n\r\n“There you are beginning again to ramble, to talk again and again of\r\nthe past! But what is the use of teasing me with going all over that\r\nagain?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you are only one-and-twenty, and can forget the past; I am fifty,\r\nand am obliged to recollect it. But let us return to business.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I was going to say, if I were in your place——”\r\n\r\n“Well.”\r\n\r\n“I would realize——”\r\n\r\n“How would you realize?”\r\n\r\n“I would ask for six months’ in advance, under pretence of being able\r\nto purchase a farm, then with my six months I would decamp.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said Andrea, “that isn’t a bad idea.”\r\n\r\n“My dear friend,” said Caderousse, “eat of my bread, and take my\r\nadvice; you will be none the worse off, physically or morally.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Andrea, “why do you not act on the advice you gave me? Why\r\ndo you not realize a six months’, a year’s advance even, and retire to\r\nBrussels? Instead of living the retired baker, you might live as a\r\nbankrupt, using his privileges; that would be very good.”\r\n\r\n“But how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Caderousse,” said Andrea, “how covetous you are! Two months ago\r\nyou were dying with hunger.”\r\n\r\n“The appetite grows by what it feeds on,” said Caderousse, grinning and\r\nshowing his teeth, like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling. “And,”\r\nadded he, biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of\r\nbread, “I have formed a plan.”\r\n\r\nCaderousse’s plans alarmed Andrea still more than his ideas; ideas were\r\nbut the germ, the plan was reality.\r\n\r\n“Let me see your plan; I dare say it is a pretty one.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? Who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of\r\nM——! eh? was it not I? and it was no bad one I believe, since here we\r\nare!”\r\n\r\n“I do not say,” replied Andrea, “that you never make a good one; but\r\nlet us see your plan.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” pursued Caderousse, “can you without expending one sou, put me\r\nin the way of getting fifteen thousand francs? No, fifteen thousand are\r\nnot enough,—I cannot again become an honest man with less than thirty\r\nthousand francs.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Andrea, dryly, “no, I cannot.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think you understand me,” replied Caderousse, calmly; “I said\r\nwithout your laying out a sou.”\r\n\r\n“Do you want me to commit a robbery, to spoil all my good fortune—and\r\nyours with mine—and both of us to be dragged down there again?”\r\n\r\n“It would make very little difference to me,” said Caderousse, “if I\r\nwere retaken, I am a poor creature to live alone, and sometimes pine\r\nfor my old comrades; not like you, heartless creature, who would be\r\nglad never to see them again.”\r\n\r\nAndrea did more than tremble this time, he turned pale.\r\n\r\n“Come, Caderousse, no nonsense!” said he.\r\n\r\n“Don’t alarm yourself, my little Benedetto, but just point out to me\r\nsome means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your\r\nassistance, and I will contrive it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll see—I’ll try to contrive some way,” said Andrea.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs,\r\nmy little fellow? I have a fancy, and mean to get a housekeeper.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you shall have your five hundred francs,” said Andrea; “but it\r\nis very hard for me, my poor Caderousse—you take advantage——”\r\n\r\n“Bah,” said Caderousse, “when you have access to countless stores.”\r\n\r\nOne would have said Andrea anticipated his companion’s words, so did\r\nhis eye flash like lightning, but it was but for a moment.\r\n\r\n“True,” he replied, “and my protector is very kind.”\r\n\r\n“That dear protector,” said Caderousse; “and how much does he give you\r\nmonthly?”\r\n\r\n“Five thousand francs.”\r\n\r\n“As many thousands as you give me hundreds! Truly, it is only bastards\r\nwho are thus fortunate. Five thousand francs per month! What the devil\r\ncan you do with all that?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is no trouble to spend that; and I am like you, I want\r\ncapital.”\r\n\r\n“Capital?—yes—I understand—everyone would like capital.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and I shall get it.”\r\n\r\n“Who will give it to you—your prince?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my prince. But unfortunately I must wait.”\r\n\r\n40138m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You must wait for what?” asked Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“For his death.”\r\n\r\n“The death of your prince?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“Because he has made his will in my favor.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\n“On my honor.”\r\n\r\n“For how much?”\r\n\r\n“For five hundred thousand.”\r\n\r\n“Only that? It’s little enough.”\r\n\r\n“But so it is.”\r\n\r\n“No, it cannot be!”\r\n\r\n“Are you my friend, Caderousse?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, in life or death.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will tell you a secret.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“But remember——”\r\n\r\n“Ah! _pardieu!_ mute as a carp.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I think——”\r\n\r\nAndrea stopped and looked around.\r\n\r\n“You think? Do not fear; _pardieu!_ we are alone.”\r\n\r\n“I think I have discovered my father.”\r\n\r\n“Your true father?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Not old Cavalcanti?”\r\n\r\n“No, for he has gone again; the true one, as you say.”\r\n\r\n“And that father is——”\r\n\r\n“Well, Caderousse, it is Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you understand, that explains all. He cannot acknowledge me\r\nopenly, it appears, but he does it through M. Cavalcanti, and gives him\r\nfifty thousand francs for it.”\r\n\r\n“Fifty thousand francs for being your father? I would have done it for\r\nhalf that, for twenty thousand, for fifteen thousand; why did you not\r\nthink of me, ungrateful man?”\r\n\r\n“Did I know anything about it, when it was all done when I was down\r\nthere?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, truly? And you say that by his will——”\r\n\r\n“He leaves me five hundred thousand livres.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure of it?”\r\n\r\n“He showed it me; but that is not all—there is a codicil, as I said\r\njust now.”\r\n\r\n“Probably.”\r\n\r\n“And in that codicil he acknowledges me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the good father, the brave father, the very honest father!” said\r\nCaderousse, twirling a plate in the air between his two hands.\r\n\r\n“Now, say if I conceal anything from you?”\r\n\r\n“No, and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion; and your\r\nprincely father, is he rich, very rich?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he is that; he does not himself know the amount of his fortune.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible?”\r\n\r\n“It is evident enough to me, who am always at his house. The other day\r\na banker’s clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about\r\nthe size of your plate; yesterday his banker brought him a hundred\r\nthousand francs in gold.”\r\n\r\nCaderousse was filled with wonder; the young man’s words sounded to him\r\nlike metal, and he thought he could hear the rushing of cascades of\r\nlouis.\r\n\r\n“And you go into that house?” cried he briskly.\r\n\r\n“When I like.”\r\n\r\nCaderousse was thoughtful for a moment. It was easy to perceive he was\r\nrevolving some unfortunate idea in his mind. Then suddenly,—\r\n\r\n“How I should like to see all that,” cried he; “how beautiful it must\r\nbe!”\r\n\r\n“It is, in fact, magnificent,” said Andrea.\r\n\r\n“And does he not live in the Champs-Élysées?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, No. 30.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Caderousse, “No. 30.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a fine house standing alone, between a courtyard and a\r\ngarden,—you must know it.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly; but it is not the exterior I care for, it is the interior.\r\nWhat beautiful furniture there must be in it!”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever seen the Tuileries?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it surpasses that.”\r\n\r\n“It must be worth one’s while to stoop, Andrea, when that good M. Monte\r\nCristo lets fall his purse.”\r\n\r\n“It is not worthwhile to wait for that,” said Andrea; “money is as\r\nplentiful in that house as fruit in an orchard.”\r\n\r\n“But you should take me there one day with you.”\r\n\r\n“How can I? On what plea?”\r\n\r\n“You are right; but you have made my mouth water. I must absolutely see\r\nit; I shall find a way.”\r\n\r\n“No nonsense, Caderousse!”\r\n\r\n“I will offer myself as floor-polisher.”\r\n\r\n“The rooms are all carpeted.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I must be contented to imagine it.”\r\n\r\n“That is the best plan, believe me.”\r\n\r\n“Try, at least, to give me an idea of what it is.”\r\n\r\n“How can I?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is easier. Is it large?”\r\n\r\n“Middling.”\r\n\r\n“How is it arranged?”\r\n\r\n“Faith, I should require pen, ink, and paper to make a plan.”\r\n\r\n“They are all here,” said Caderousse, briskly. He fetched from an old\r\nsecretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink. “Here,” said\r\nCaderousse, “draw me all that on the paper, my boy.”\r\n\r\nAndrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began.\r\n\r\n“The house, as I said, is between the court and the garden; in this\r\nway, do you see?” Andrea drew the garden, the court and the house.\r\n\r\n40142m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“High walls?”\r\n\r\n“Not more than eight or ten feet.”\r\n\r\n“That is not prudent,” said Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“In the court are orange-trees in pots, turf, and clumps of flowers.”\r\n\r\n“And no steel-traps?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“The stables?”\r\n\r\n“Are on either side of the gate, which you see there.” And Andrea\r\ncontinued his plan.\r\n\r\n“Let us see the ground floor,” said Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“On the ground floor, dining-room, two drawing-rooms, billiard-room,\r\nstaircase in the hall, and a little back staircase.”\r\n\r\n“Windows?”\r\n\r\n“Magnificent windows, so beautiful, so large, that I believe a man of\r\nyour size should pass through each frame.”\r\n\r\n“Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows?”\r\n\r\n“Luxury has everything.”\r\n\r\n“But shutters?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but they are never used. That Count of Monte Cristo is an\r\noriginal, who loves to look at the sky even at night.”\r\n\r\n“And where do the servants sleep?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, they have a house to themselves. Picture to yourself a pretty\r\ncoach-house at the right-hand side where the ladders are kept. Well,\r\nover that coach-house are the servants’ rooms, with bells corresponding\r\nwith the different apartments.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, _diable!_ bells did you say?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing! I only say they cost a load of money to hang, and what is\r\nthe use of them, I should like to know?”\r\n\r\n“There used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night, but it has been\r\ntaken to the house at Auteuil, to that you went to, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I was saying to him only yesterday, ‘You are imprudent, Monsieur\r\nCount; for when you go to Auteuil and take your servants the house is\r\nleft unprotected.’ ‘Well,’ said he, ‘what next?’ ‘Well, next, some day\r\nyou will be robbed.’”\r\n\r\n“What did he answer?”\r\n\r\n“He quietly said, ‘What do I care if I am?’”\r\n\r\n“Andrea, he has some secretaire with a spring.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune. I was told\r\nthere were such at the last exhibition.”\r\n\r\n“He has simply a mahogany secretaire, in which the key is always kept.”\r\n\r\n“And he is not robbed?”\r\n\r\n“No; his servants are all devoted to him.”\r\n\r\n“There ought to be some money in that secretaire?”\r\n\r\n“There may be. No one knows what there is.”\r\n\r\n“And where is it?”\r\n\r\n“On the first floor.”\r\n\r\n“Sketch me the plan of that floor, as you have done of the ground\r\nfloor, my boy.”\r\n\r\n“That is very simple.” Andrea took the pen. “On the first story, do you\r\nsee, there is the anteroom and the drawing-room; to the right of the\r\ndrawing-room, a library and a study; to the left, a bedroom and a\r\ndressing-room. The famous secretaire is in the dressing-room.”\r\n\r\n“Is there a window in the dressing-room?”\r\n\r\n“Two,—one here and one there.” Andrea sketched two windows in the room,\r\nwhich formed an angle on the plan, and appeared as a small square added\r\nto the rectangle of the bedroom. Caderousse became thoughtful.\r\n\r\n“Does he often go to Auteuil?” added he.\r\n\r\n“Two or three times a week. Tomorrow, for instance, he is going to\r\nspend the day and night there.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure of it?”\r\n\r\n“He has invited me to dine there.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a life for you,” said Caderousse; “a town house and a country\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\n“That is what it is to be rich.”\r\n\r\n“And shall you dine there?”\r\n\r\n“Probably.”\r\n\r\n“When you dine there, do you sleep there?”\r\n\r\n“If I like; I am at home there.”\r\n\r\nCaderousse looked at the young man, as if to get at the truth from the\r\nbottom of his heart. But Andrea drew a cigar-case from his pocket, took\r\na Havana, quietly lit it, and began smoking.\r\n\r\n“When do you want your twelve hundred francs?” said he to Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“Now, if you have them.” Andrea took five-and-twenty louis from his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n“Yellow boys?” said Caderousse; “no, I thank you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you despise them.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, I esteem them, but will not have them.”\r\n\r\n“You can change them, idiot; gold is worth five sous.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly; and he who changes them will follow friend Caderousse, lay\r\nhands on him, and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold. No\r\nnonsense, my good fellow; silver simply, round coins with the head of\r\nsome monarch or other on them. Anybody may possess a five-franc piece.”\r\n\r\n“But do you suppose I carry five hundred francs about with me? I should\r\nwant a porter.”\r\n\r\n“Well, leave them with your porter; he is to be trusted. I will call\r\nfor them.”\r\n\r\n“Today?”\r\n\r\n“No, tomorrow; I shall not have time today.”\r\n\r\n“Well, tomorrow I will leave them when I go to Auteuil.”\r\n\r\n“May I depend on it?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Because I shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it.”\r\n\r\n“Now see here, will that be all? Eh? And will you not torment me any\r\nmore?”\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\nCaderousse had become so gloomy that Andrea feared he should be obliged\r\nto notice the change. He redoubled his gayety and carelessness.\r\n\r\n“How sprightly you are,” said Caderousse; “One would say you were\r\nalready in possession of your property.”\r\n\r\n“No, unfortunately; but when I do obtain it——”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I shall remember old friends, I can tell you that.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, since you have such a good memory.”\r\n\r\n“What do you want? It looks as if you were trying to fleece me?”\r\n\r\n“I? What an idea! I, who am going to give you another piece of good\r\nadvice.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“To leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger. We shall both\r\nget into trouble. You will ruin both yourself and me by your folly.”\r\n\r\n“How so?” said Andrea.\r\n\r\n“How? You put on a livery, you disguise yourself as a servant, and yet\r\nkeep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs.”\r\n\r\n“You guess well.”\r\n\r\n“I know something of diamonds; I have had some.”\r\n\r\n“You do well to boast of it,” said Andrea, who, without becoming angry,\r\nas Caderousse feared, at this new extortion, quietly resigned the ring.\r\nCaderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was\r\nexamining to see if all the edges were perfect.\r\n\r\n“It is a false diamond,” said Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“You are joking now,” replied Andrea.\r\n\r\n“Do not be angry, we can try it.” Caderousse went to the window,\r\ntouched the glass with it, and found it would cut.\r\n\r\n“_Confiteor!_” said Caderousse, putting the diamond on his little\r\nfinger; “I was mistaken; but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well\r\nthat it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller’s shop—it is another\r\nbranch of industry paralyzed.”\r\n\r\n“Have you finished?” said Andrea,—“do you want anything more?—will you\r\nhave my waistcoat or my hat? Make free, now you have begun.”\r\n\r\n“No; you are, after all, a good companion; I will not detain you, and\r\nwill try to cure myself of my ambition.”\r\n\r\n“But take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the\r\ndiamond you feared with the gold.”\r\n\r\n“I shall not sell it—do not fear.”\r\n\r\n“Not at least till the day after tomorrow,” thought the young man.\r\n\r\n“Happy rogue,” said Caderousse; “you are going to find your servants,\r\nyour horses, your carriage, and your betrothed!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Andrea.\r\n\r\n“Well, I hope you will make a handsome wedding-present the day you\r\nmarry Mademoiselle Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head.”\r\n\r\n“What fortune has she?”\r\n\r\n“But I tell you——”\r\n\r\n“A million?”\r\n\r\nAndrea shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Let it be a million,” said Caderousse; “you can never have so much as\r\nI wish you.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said the young man.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I wish it you with all my heart!” added Caderousse with his hoarse\r\nlaugh. “Stop, let me show you the way.”\r\n\r\n“It is not worthwhile.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because there is a little secret, a precaution I thought it desirable\r\nto take, one of Huret & Fichet’s locks, revised and improved by Gaspard\r\nCaderousse; I will manufacture you a similar one when you are a\r\ncapitalist.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Andrea; “I will let you know a week beforehand.”\r\n\r\nThey parted. Caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only\r\nseen Andrea go down the three stories, but also cross the court. Then\r\nhe returned hastily, shut his door carefully, and began to study, like\r\na clever architect, the plan Andrea had left him.\r\n\r\n“Dear Benedetto,” said he, “I think he will not be sorry to inherit his\r\nfortune, and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred\r\nthousand will not be his worst friend.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 82. The Burglary\r\n\r\nThe day following that on which the conversation we have related took\r\nplace, the Count of Monte Cristo set out for Auteuil, accompanied by\r\nAli and several attendants, and also taking with him some horses whose\r\nqualities he was desirous of ascertaining. He was induced to undertake\r\nthis journey, of which the day before he had not even thought and which\r\nhad not occurred to Andrea either, by the arrival of Bertuccio from\r\nNormandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop. The house\r\nwas ready, and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor\r\nin a small creek with her crew of six men, who had observed all the\r\nrequisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea.\r\n\r\nThe count praised Bertuccio’s zeal, and ordered him to prepare for a\r\nspeedy departure, as his stay in France would not be prolonged more\r\nthan a month.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said he, “I may require to go in one night from Paris to\r\nTréport; let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road, which will\r\nenable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours.”\r\n\r\n“Your highness had already expressed that wish,” said Bertuccio, “and\r\nthe horses are ready. I have bought them, and stationed them myself at\r\nthe most desirable posts, that is, in villages, where no one generally\r\nstops.”\r\n\r\n“That’s well,” said Monte Cristo; “I remain here a day or two—arrange\r\naccordingly.”\r\n\r\nAs Bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders,\r\nBaptistin opened the door: he held a letter on a silver waiter.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here?” asked the count, seeing him covered with\r\ndust; “I did not send for you, I think?”\r\n\r\nBaptistin, without answering, approached the count, and presented the\r\nletter. “Important and urgent,” said he.\r\n\r\nThe count opened the letter, and read:\r\n\r\n“‘M. de Monte Cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his\r\nhouse in the Champs-Élysées with the intention of carrying off some\r\npapers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressing-room. The\r\ncount’s well-known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the\r\npolice, whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this\r\nadvice. The count, by any opening from the bedroom, or by concealing\r\nhimself in the dressing-room, would be able to defend his property\r\nhimself. Many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the\r\nvillain from the attempt, and M. de Monte Cristo would lose the\r\nopportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who\r\nnow sends this warning to the count,—a warning he might not be able to\r\nsend another time, if this first attempt should fail and another be\r\nmade.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe count’s first idea was that this was an artifice—a gross deception,\r\nto draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a\r\ngreater. He was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of\r\npolice, notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend, or perhaps\r\nbecause of that advice, when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it\r\nmight be some personal enemy, whom he alone should recognize and over\r\nwhom, if such were the case, he alone would gain any advantage, as\r\nFiesco17 had done over the Moor who would have killed him. We know the\r\ncount’s vigorous and daring mind, denying anything to be impossible,\r\nwith that energy which marks the great man.\r\n\r\nFrom his past life, from his resolution to shrink from nothing, the\r\ncount had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he\r\nhad engaged, sometimes against nature, that is to say, against God, and\r\nsometimes against the world, that is, against the devil.\r\n\r\n“They do not want my papers,” said Monte Cristo, “they want to kill me;\r\nthey are no robbers, but assassins. I will not allow the prefect of\r\npolice to interfere with my private affairs. I am rich enough,\r\nforsooth, to distribute his authority on this occasion.”\r\n\r\nThe count recalled Baptistin, who had left the room after delivering\r\nthe letter.\r\n\r\n“Return to Paris,” said he; “assemble the servants who remain there. I\r\nwant all my household at Auteuil.”\r\n\r\n“But will no one remain in the house, my lord?” asked Baptistin.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the porter.”\r\n\r\n“My lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“The house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise.”\r\n\r\n“By whom?”\r\n\r\n“By thieves.”\r\n\r\n“You are a fool, M. Baptistin. Thieves might strip the house—it would\r\nannoy me less than to be disobeyed.” Baptistin bowed.\r\n\r\n40150m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You understand me?” said the count. “Bring your comrades here, one and\r\nall; but let everything remain as usual, only close the shutters of the\r\nground floor.”\r\n\r\n“And those of the first floor?”\r\n\r\n“You know they are never closed. Go!”\r\n\r\nThe count signified his intention of dining alone, and that no one but\r\nAli should attend him. Having dined with his usual tranquillity and\r\nmoderation, the count, making a signal to Ali to follow him, went out\r\nby the side-gate and on reaching the Bois de Boulogne turned,\r\napparently without design towards Paris and at twilight; found himself\r\nopposite his house in the Champs-Élysées. All was dark; one solitary,\r\nfeeble light was burning in the porter’s lodge, about forty paces\r\ndistant from the house, as Baptistin had said.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo leaned against a tree, and with that scrutinizing glance\r\nwhich was so rarely deceived, looked up and down the avenue, examined\r\nthe passers-by, and carefully looked down the neighboring streets, to\r\nsee that no one was concealed. Ten minutes passed thus, and he was\r\nconvinced that no one was watching him. He hastened to the side-door\r\nwith Ali, entered hurriedly, and by the servants’ staircase, of which\r\nhe had the key, gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a\r\nsingle curtain, without even the porter having the slightest suspicion\r\nthat the house, which he supposed empty, contained its chief occupant.\r\n\r\nArrived in his bedroom, the count motioned to Ali to stop; then he\r\npassed into the dressing-room, which he examined. Everything appeared\r\nas usual—the precious secretaire in its place, and the key in the\r\nsecretaire. He double locked it, took the key, returned to the bedroom\r\ndoor, removed the double staple of the bolt, and went in. Meanwhile Ali\r\nhad procured the arms the count required—namely, a short carbine and a\r\npair of double-barrelled pistols, with which as sure an aim might be\r\ntaken as with a single-barrelled one. Thus armed, the count held the\r\nlives of five men in his hands. It was about half-past nine.\r\n\r\nThe count and Ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of\r\nSpanish wine; then Monte Cristo slipped aside one of the movable\r\npanels, which enabled him to see into the adjoining room. He had within\r\nhis reach his pistols and carbine, and Ali, standing near him, held one\r\nof the small Arabian hatchets, whose form has not varied since the\r\nCrusades. Through one of the windows of the bedroom, on a line with\r\nthat in the dressing-room, the count could see into the street.\r\n\r\nTwo hours passed thus. It was intensely dark; still Ali, thanks to his\r\nwild nature, and the count, thanks doubtless to his long confinement,\r\ncould distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees.\r\nThe little light in the lodge had long been extinct. It might be\r\nexpected that the attack, if indeed an attack was projected, would be\r\nmade from the staircase of the ground floor, and not from a window; in\r\nMonte Cristo’s opinion, the villains sought his life, not his money. It\r\nwould be his bedroom they would attack, and they must reach it by the\r\nback staircase, or by the window in the dressing-room.\r\n\r\nThe clock of the Invalides struck a quarter to twelve; the west wind\r\nbore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes.\r\n\r\n40152m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the last stroke died away, the count thought he heard a slight noise\r\nin the dressing-room; this first sound, or rather this first grinding,\r\nwas followed by a second, then a third; at the fourth, the count knew\r\nwhat to expect. A firm and well-practised hand was engaged in cutting\r\nthe four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond. The count felt his\r\nheart beat more rapidly.\r\n\r\nInured as men may be to danger, forewarned as they may be of peril,\r\nthey understand, by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of\r\nthe frame, the enormous difference between a dream and a reality,\r\nbetween the project and the execution. However, Monte Cristo only made\r\na sign to apprise Ali, who, understanding that danger was approaching\r\nfrom the other side, drew nearer to his master. Monte Cristo was eager\r\nto ascertain the strength and number of his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which\r\nthe count could see into the dressing-room. He fixed his eyes on that\r\nwindow—he distinguished a shadow in the darkness; then one of the panes\r\nbecame quite opaque, as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside,\r\nthen the square cracked without falling. Through the opening an arm was\r\npassed to find the fastening, then a second; the window turned on its\r\nhinges, and a man entered. He was alone.\r\n\r\n“That’s a daring rascal,” whispered the count.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Ali touched him slightly on the shoulder. He turned; Ali\r\npointed to the window of the room in which they were, facing the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n“I see!” said he, “there are two of them; one does the work while the\r\nother stands guard.” He made a sign to Ali not to lose sight of the man\r\nin the street, and turned to the one in the dressing-room.\r\n\r\nThe glass-cutter had entered, and was feeling his way, his arms\r\nstretched out before him. At last he appeared to have made himself\r\nfamiliar with his surroundings. There were two doors; he bolted them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nWhen he drew near to the bedroom door, Monte Cristo expected that he\r\nwas coming in, and raised one of his pistols; but he simply heard the\r\nsound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings. It was only a\r\nprecaution. The nocturnal visitor, ignorant of the fact that the count\r\nhad removed the staples, might now think himself at home, and pursue\r\nhis purpose with full security. Alone and free to act as he wished, the\r\nman then drew from his pocket something which the count could not\r\ndiscern, placed it on a stand, then went straight to the secretaire,\r\nfelt the lock, and contrary to his expectation found that the key was\r\nmissing. But the glass-cutter was a prudent man who had provided for\r\nall emergencies. The count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of\r\nskeleton keys, such as the locksmith brings when called to force a\r\nlock, and which thieves call nightingales, doubtless from the music of\r\ntheir nightly song when they grind against the bolt.\r\n\r\n“Ah, ha,” whispered Monte Cristo with a smile of disappointment, “he is\r\nonly a thief.”\r\n\r\nBut the man in the dark could not find the right key. He reached the\r\ninstrument he had placed on the stand, touched a spring, and\r\nimmediately a pale light, just bright enough to render objects\r\ndistinct, was reflected on his hands and countenance.\r\n\r\n“By heavens,” exclaimed Monte Cristo, starting back, “it is——”\r\n\r\nAli raised his hatchet.\r\n\r\n“Don’t stir,” whispered Monte Cristo, “and put down your hatchet; we\r\nshall require no arms.”\r\n\r\n40154m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he added some words in a low tone, for the exclamation which\r\nsurprise had drawn from the count, faint as it had been, had startled\r\nthe man who remained in the pose of the old knife-grinder.\r\n\r\nIt was an order the count had just given, for immediately Ali went\r\nnoiselessly, and returned, bearing a black dress and a three-cornered\r\nhat. Meanwhile Monte Cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat,\r\nwaistcoat, and shirt, and one might distinguish by the glimmering\r\nthrough the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail, of\r\nwhich the last in France, where daggers are no longer dreaded, was worn\r\nby King Louis XVI., who feared the dagger at his breast, and whose head\r\nwas cleft with a hatchet. The tunic soon disappeared under a long\r\ncassock, as did his hair under a priest’s wig; the three-cornered hat\r\nover this effectually transformed the count into an abbé.\r\n\r\nThe man, hearing nothing more, stood erect, and while Monte Cristo was\r\ncompleting his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire, whose\r\nlock was beginning to crack under his nightingale.\r\n\r\n“Try again,” whispered the count, who depended on the secret spring,\r\nwhich was unknown to the picklock, clever as he might be—“try again,\r\nyou have a few minutes’ work there.”\r\n\r\nAnd he advanced to the window. The man whom he had seen seated on a\r\nfence had got down, and was still pacing the street; but, strange as it\r\nappeared, he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the\r\nChamps-Élysées or by the Faubourg Saint-Honoré; his attention was\r\nengrossed with what was passing at the count’s, and his only aim\r\nappeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing-room.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile\r\npassed over his lips; then drawing near to Ali, he whispered:\r\n\r\n“Remain here, concealed in the dark, and whatever noise you hear,\r\nwhatever passes, only come in or show yourself if I call you.”\r\n\r\nAli bowed in token of strict obedience. Monte Cristo then drew a\r\nlighted taper from a closet, and when the thief was deeply engaged with\r\nhis lock, silently opened the door, taking care that the light should\r\nshine directly on his face. The door opened so quietly that the thief\r\nheard no sound; but, to his astonishment, the room was suddenly\r\nilluminated. He turned.\r\n\r\n“Ah, good-evening, my dear M. Caderousse,” said Monte Cristo; “what are\r\nyou doing here, at such an hour?”\r\n\r\n40156m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Abbé Busoni!” exclaimed Caderousse; and, not knowing how this\r\nstrange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors, he\r\nlet fall his bunch of keys, and remained motionless and stupefied. The\r\ncount placed himself between Caderousse and the window, thus cutting\r\noff from the thief his only chance of retreat.\r\n\r\n“The Abbé Busoni!” repeated Caderousse, fixing his haggard gaze on the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n“Yes, undoubtedly, the Abbé Busoni himself,” replied Monte Cristo. “And\r\nI am very glad you recognize me, dear M. Caderousse; it proves you have\r\na good memory, for it must be about ten years since we last met.”\r\n\r\nThis calmness of Busoni, combined with his irony and boldness,\r\nstaggered Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“The abbé, the abbé!” murmured he, clenching his fists, and his teeth\r\nchattering.\r\n\r\n“So you would rob the Count of Monte Cristo?” continued the false abbé.\r\n\r\n“Reverend sir,” murmured Caderousse, seeking to regain the window,\r\nwhich the count pitilessly blocked—“reverend sir, I don’t know—believe\r\nme—I take my oath——”\r\n\r\n“A pane of glass out,” continued the count, “a dark lantern, a bunch of\r\nfalse keys, a secretaire half forced—it is tolerably evident——”\r\n\r\nCaderousse was choking; he looked around for some corner to hide in,\r\nsome way of escape.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” continued the count, “I see you are still the same,—an\r\nassassin.”\r\n\r\n“Reverend sir, since you know everything, you know it was not I—it was\r\nLa Carconte; that was proved at the trial, since I was only condemned\r\nto the galleys.”\r\n\r\n“Is your time, then, expired, since I find you in a fair way to return\r\nthere?”\r\n\r\n“No, reverend sir; I have been liberated by someone.”\r\n\r\n“That someone has done society a great kindness.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Caderousse, “I had promised——”\r\n\r\n“And you are breaking your promise!” interrupted Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Alas, yes!” said Caderousse very uneasily.\r\n\r\n“A bad relapse, that will lead you, if I mistake not, to the Place de\r\nGrève. So much the worse, so much the worse—_diavolo!_ as they say in\r\nmy country.”\r\n\r\n“Reverend sir, I am impelled——”\r\n\r\n“Every criminal says the same thing.”\r\n\r\n“Poverty——”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw!” said Busoni disdainfully; “poverty may make a man beg, steal a\r\nloaf of bread at a baker’s door, but not cause him to open a secretaire\r\nin a house supposed to be inhabited. And when the jeweller Johannes had\r\njust paid you 45,000 francs for the diamond I had given you, and you\r\nkilled him to get the diamond and the money both, was that also\r\npoverty?”\r\n\r\n“Pardon, reverend sir,” said Caderousse; “you have saved my life once,\r\nsave me again!”\r\n\r\n“That is but poor encouragement.”\r\n\r\n“Are you alone, reverend sir, or have you there soldiers ready to seize\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“I am alone,” said the abbé, “and I will again have pity on you, and\r\nwill let you escape, at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may\r\nlead to, if you tell me the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, reverend sir,” cried Caderousse, clasping his hands, and drawing\r\nnearer to Monte Cristo, “I may indeed say you are my deliverer!”\r\n\r\n“You mean to say you have been freed from confinement?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is true, reverend sir.”\r\n\r\n“Who was your liberator?”\r\n\r\n“An Englishman.”\r\n\r\n“What was his name?”\r\n\r\n“Lord Wilmore.”\r\n\r\n“I know him; I shall know if you lie.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, reverend sir, I tell you the simple truth.”\r\n\r\n“Was this Englishman protecting you?”\r\n\r\n“No, not me, but a young Corsican, my companion.”\r\n\r\n“What was this young Corsican’s name?”\r\n\r\n“Benedetto.”\r\n\r\n“Is that his Christian name?”\r\n\r\n“He had no other; he was a foundling.”\r\n\r\n“Then this young man escaped with you?”\r\n\r\n“He did.”\r\n\r\n“In what way?”\r\n\r\n“We were working at Saint-Mandrier, near Toulon. Do you know\r\nSaint-Mandrier?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“In the hour of rest, between noon and one o’clock——”\r\n\r\n“Galley-slaves having a nap after dinner! We may well pity the poor\r\nfellows!” said the abbé.\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Caderousse, “one can’t always work—one is not a dog.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better for the dogs,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“While the rest slept, then, we went away a short distance; we severed\r\nour fetters with a file the Englishman had given us, and swam away.”\r\n\r\n“And what is become of this Benedetto?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“You ought to know.”\r\n\r\n“No, in truth; we parted at Hyères.” And, to give more weight to his\r\nprotestation, Caderousse advanced another step towards the abbé, who\r\nremained motionless in his place, as calm as ever, and pursuing his\r\ninterrogation.\r\n\r\n“You lie,” said the Abbé Busoni, with a tone of irresistible authority.\r\n\r\n“Reverend sir!”\r\n\r\n“You lie! This man is still your friend, and you, perhaps, make use of\r\nhim as your accomplice.”\r\n\r\n40160m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, reverend sir!”\r\n\r\n“Since you left Toulon what have you lived on? Answer me!”\r\n\r\n“On what I could get.”\r\n\r\n“You lie,” repeated the abbé a third time, with a still more imperative\r\ntone. Caderousse, terrified, looked at the count. “You have lived on\r\nthe money he has given you.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Caderousse; “Benedetto has become the son of a great\r\nlord.”\r\n\r\n“How can he be the son of a great lord?”\r\n\r\n“A natural son.”\r\n\r\n“And what is that great lord’s name?”\r\n\r\n“The Count of Monte Cristo, the very same in whose house we are.”\r\n\r\n“Benedetto the count’s son?” replied Monte Cristo, astonished in his\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n“Well, I should think so, since the count has found him a false\r\nfather—since the count gives him four thousand francs a month, and\r\nleaves him 500,000 francs in his will.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” said the factitious abbé, who began to understand; “and what\r\nname does the young man bear meanwhile?”\r\n\r\n“Andrea Cavalcanti.”\r\n\r\n“Is it, then, that young man whom my friend the Count of Monte Cristo\r\nhas received into his house, and who is going to marry Mademoiselle\r\nDanglars?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\n“And you suffer that, you wretch!—you, who know his life and his\r\ncrime?”\r\n\r\n“Why should I stand in a comrade’s way?” said Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“You are right; it is not you who should apprise M. Danglars, it is I.”\r\n\r\n“Do not do so, reverend sir.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because you would bring us to ruin.”\r\n\r\n“And you think that to save such villains as you I will become an\r\nabettor of their plot, an accomplice in their crimes?”\r\n\r\n“Reverend sir,” said Caderousse, drawing still nearer.\r\n\r\n“I will expose all.”\r\n\r\n“To whom?”\r\n\r\n“To M. Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“By Heaven!” cried Caderousse, drawing from his waistcoat an open\r\nknife, and striking the count in the breast, “you shall disclose\r\nnothing, reverend sir!”\r\n\r\nTo Caderousse’s great astonishment, the knife, instead of piercing the\r\ncount’s breast, flew back blunted. At the same moment the count seized\r\nwith his left hand the assassin’s wrist, and wrung it with such\r\nstrength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers, and Caderousse\r\nuttered a cry of pain. But the count, disregarding his cry, continued\r\nto wring the bandit’s wrist, until, his arm being dislocated, he fell\r\nfirst on his knees, then flat on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe count then placed his foot on his head, saying, “I know not what\r\nrestrains me from crushing thy skull, rascal.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, mercy—mercy!” cried Caderousse.\r\n\r\nThe count withdrew his foot.\r\n\r\n40162m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Rise!” said he. Caderousse rose.\r\n\r\n“What a wrist you have, reverend sir!” said Caderousse, stroking his\r\narm, all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it; “what a\r\nwrist!”\r\n\r\n“Silence! God gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you; in\r\nthe name of that God I act,—remember that, wretch,—and to spare thee at\r\nthis moment is still serving him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Caderousse, groaning with pain.\r\n\r\n“Take this pen and paper, and write what I dictate.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how to write, reverend sir.”\r\n\r\n“You lie! Take this pen, and write!”\r\n\r\nCaderousse, awed by the superior power of the abbé, sat down and wrote:\r\n\r\n“Sir,—The man whom you are receiving at your house, and to whom you\r\nintend to marry your daughter, is a felon who escaped with me from\r\nconfinement at Toulon. He was No. 59, and I No. 58. He was called\r\nBenedetto, but he is ignorant of his real name, having never known his\r\nparents.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sign it!” continued the count.\r\n\r\n“But would you ruin me?”\r\n\r\n“If I sought your ruin, fool, I should drag you to the first\r\nguard-house; besides, when that note is delivered, in all probability\r\nyou will have no more to fear. Sign it, then!”\r\n\r\nCaderousse signed it.\r\n\r\n“The address, ‘To monsieur the Baron Danglars, banker, Rue de la\r\nChaussée d’Antin.’”\r\n\r\nCaderousse wrote the address. The abbé took the note.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said he, “that suffices—begone!”\r\n\r\n“Which way?”\r\n\r\n“The way you came.”\r\n\r\n“You wish me to get out at that window?”\r\n\r\n“You got in very well.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you have some design against me, reverend sir.”\r\n\r\n“Idiot! what design can I have?”\r\n\r\n“Why, then, not let me out by the door?”\r\n\r\n“What would be the advantage of waking the porter?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, reverend sir, tell me, do you wish me dead?”\r\n\r\n“I wish what God wills.”\r\n\r\n“But swear that you will not strike me as I go down.”\r\n\r\n“Cowardly fool!”\r\n\r\n“What do you intend doing with me?”\r\n\r\n“I ask you what can I do? I have tried to make you a happy man, and you\r\nhave turned out a murderer.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, monsieur,” said Caderousse, “make one more attempt—try me once\r\nmore!”\r\n\r\n“I will,” said the count. “Listen—you know if I may be relied on.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“If you arrive safely at home——”\r\n\r\n“What have I to fear, except from you?”\r\n\r\n“If you reach your home safely, leave Paris, leave France, and wherever\r\nyou may be, so long as you conduct yourself well, I will send you a\r\nsmall annuity; for, if you return home safely, then——”\r\n\r\n“Then?” asked Caderousse, shuddering.\r\n\r\n40164m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Then I shall believe God has forgiven you, and I will forgive you\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“As true as I am a Christian,” stammered Caderousse, “you will make me\r\ndie of fright!”\r\n\r\n“Now begone,” said the count, pointing to the window.\r\n\r\nCaderousse, scarcely yet relying on this promise, put his legs out of\r\nthe window and stood on the ladder.\r\n\r\n“Now go down,” said the abbé, folding his arms. Understanding he had\r\nnothing more to fear from him, Caderousse began to go down. Then the\r\ncount brought the taper to the window, that it might be seen in the\r\nChamps-Élysées that a man was getting out of the window while another\r\nheld a light.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing, reverend sir? Suppose a watchman should pass?” And\r\nhe blew out the light. He then descended, but it was only when he felt\r\nhis foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo returned to his bedroom, and, glancing rapidly from the\r\ngarden to the street, he saw first Caderousse, who after walking to the\r\nend of the garden, fixed his ladder against the wall at a different\r\npart from where he came in. The count then looking over into the\r\nstreet, saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same\r\ndirection, and place himself against the angle of the wall where\r\nCaderousse would come over. Caderousse climbed the ladder slowly, and\r\nlooked over the coping to see if the street was quiet. No one could be\r\nseen or heard. The clock of the Invalides struck one. Then Caderousse\r\nsat astride the coping, and drawing up his ladder passed it over the\r\nwall; then he began to descend, or rather to slide down by the two\r\nstanchions, which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he\r\nwas to the exercise. But, once started, he could not stop. In vain did\r\nhe see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down—in vain did\r\nhe see an arm raised as he touched the ground.\r\n\r\nBefore he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the\r\nback that he let go the ladder, crying, “Help!” A second blow struck\r\nhim almost immediately in the side, and he fell, calling, “Help,\r\nmurder!” Then, as he rolled on the ground, his adversary seized him by\r\nthe hair, and struck him a third blow in the chest.\r\n\r\nThis time Caderousse endeavored to call again, but he could only utter\r\na groan, and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds.\r\nThe assassin, finding that he no longer cried out, lifted his head up\r\nby the hair; his eyes were closed, and the mouth was distorted. The\r\nmurderer, supposing him dead, let fall his head and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThen Caderousse, feeling that he was leaving him, raised himself on his\r\nelbow, and with a dying voice cried with great effort:\r\n\r\n“Murder! I am dying! Help, reverend sir,—help!”\r\n\r\nThis mournful appeal pierced the darkness. The door of the\r\nback-staircase opened, then the side-gate of the garden, and Ali and\r\nhis master were on the spot with lights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 83. The Hand of God\r\n\r\nCaderousse continued to call piteously, “Help, reverend sir, help!”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” asked Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Help,” cried Caderousse; “I am murdered!”\r\n\r\n“We are here;—take courage.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, it’s all over! You are come too late—you are come to see me die.\r\nWhat blows, what blood!”\r\n\r\nHe fainted. Ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room.\r\nMonte Cristo motioned to Ali to undress him, and he then examined his\r\ndreadful wounds.\r\n\r\n“My God!” he exclaimed, “thy vengeance is sometimes delayed, but only\r\nthat it may fall the more effectually.” Ali looked at his master for\r\nfurther instructions. “Bring here immediately the king’s attorney, M.\r\nde Villefort, who lives in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré. As you pass the\r\nlodge, wake the porter, and send him for a surgeon.”\r\n\r\nAli obeyed, leaving the abbé alone with Caderousse, who had not yet\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\nWhen the wretched man again opened his eyes, the count looked at him\r\nwith a mournful expression of pity, and his lips moved as if in prayer.\r\n“A surgeon, reverend sir—a surgeon!” said Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“I have sent for one,” replied the abbé.\r\n\r\n“I know he cannot save my life, but he may strengthen me to give my\r\nevidence.”\r\n\r\n“Against whom?”\r\n\r\n“Against my murderer.”\r\n\r\n“Did you recognize him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it was Benedetto.”\r\n\r\n“The young Corsican?”\r\n\r\n“Himself.”\r\n\r\n“Your comrade?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. After giving me the plan of this house, doubtless hoping I should\r\nkill the count and he thus become his heir, or that the count would\r\nkill me and I should be out of his way, he waylaid me, and has murdered\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“I have also sent for the procureur.”\r\n\r\n“He will not come in time; I feel my life fast ebbing.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a moment,” said Monte Cristo. He left the room, and returned in\r\nfive minutes with a phial. The dying man’s eyes were all the time\r\nriveted on the door, through which he hoped succor would arrive.\r\n\r\n“Hasten, reverend sir, hasten! I shall faint again!” Monte Cristo\r\napproached, and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the\r\ncontents of the phial. Caderousse drew a deep breath. “Oh,” said he,\r\n“that is life to me; more, more!”\r\n\r\n“Two drops more would kill you,” replied the abbé.\r\n\r\n“Oh, send for someone to whom I can denounce the wretch!”\r\n\r\n“Shall I write your deposition? You can sign it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” said Caderousse; and his eyes glistened at the thought of\r\nthis posthumous revenge. Monte Cristo wrote:\r\n\r\n“I die, murdered by the Corsican Benedetto, my comrade in the galleys\r\nat Toulon, No. 59.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Quick, quick!” said Caderousse, “or I shall be unable to sign it.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo gave the pen to Caderousse, who collected all his\r\nstrength, signed it, and fell back on his bed, saying:\r\n\r\n“You will relate all the rest, reverend sir; you will say he calls\r\nhimself Andrea Cavalcanti. He lodges at the Hôtel des Princes. Oh, I am\r\ndying!” He again fainted. The abbé made him smell the contents of the\r\nphial, and he again opened his eyes. His desire for revenge had not\r\nforsaken him.\r\n\r\n“Ah, you will tell all I have said, will you not, reverend sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and much more.”\r\n\r\n“What more will you say?”\r\n\r\n“I will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house, in the\r\nhope the count would kill you. I will say, likewise, he had apprised\r\nthe count, by a note, of your intention, and, the count being absent, I\r\nread the note and sat up to await you.”\r\n\r\n“And he will be guillotined, will he not?” said Caderousse. “Promise me\r\nthat, and I will die with that hope.”\r\n\r\n“I will say,” continued the count, “that he followed and watched you\r\nthe whole time, and when he saw you leave the house, ran to the angle\r\nof the wall to conceal himself.”\r\n\r\n“Did you see all that?”\r\n\r\n“Remember my words: ‘If you return home safely, I shall believe God has\r\nforgiven you, and I will forgive you also.’”\r\n\r\n“And you did not warn me!” cried Caderousse, raising himself on his\r\nelbows. “You knew I should be killed on leaving this house, and did not\r\nwarn me!”\r\n\r\n40168m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No; for I saw God’s justice placed in the hands of Benedetto, and\r\nshould have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of Providence.”\r\n\r\n“God’s justice! Speak not of it, reverend sir. If God were just, you\r\nknow how many would be punished who now escape.”\r\n\r\n“Patience,” said the abbé, in a tone which made the dying man shudder;\r\n“have patience!”\r\n\r\nCaderousse looked at him with amazement.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” said the abbé, “God is merciful to all, as he has been to\r\nyou; he is first a father, then a judge.”\r\n\r\n“Do you then believe in God?” said Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“Had I been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now,” said Monte\r\nCristo, “I must believe on seeing you.”\r\n\r\nCaderousse raised his clenched hands towards heaven.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said the abbé, extending his hand over the wounded man, as if\r\nto command him to believe; “this is what the God in whom, on your\r\ndeath-bed, you refuse to believe, has done for you—he gave you health,\r\nstrength, regular employment, even friends—a life, in fact, which a man\r\nmight enjoy with a calm conscience. Instead of improving these gifts,\r\nrarely granted so abundantly, this has been your course—you have given\r\nyourself up to sloth and drunkenness, and in a fit of intoxication have\r\nruined your best friend.”\r\n\r\n“Help!” cried Caderousse; “I require a surgeon, not a priest; perhaps I\r\nam not mortally wounded—I may not die; perhaps they can yet save my\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“Your wounds are so far mortal that, without the three drops I gave\r\nyou, you would now be dead. Listen, then.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” murmured Caderousse, “what a strange priest you are; you drive\r\nthe dying to despair, instead of consoling them.”\r\n\r\n“Listen,” continued the abbé. “When you had betrayed your friend, God\r\nbegan not to strike, but to warn you. Poverty overtook you. You had\r\nalready passed half your life in coveting that which you might have\r\nhonorably acquired; and already you contemplated crime under the excuse\r\nof want, when God worked a miracle in your behalf, sending you, by my\r\nhands, a fortune—brilliant, indeed, for you, who had never possessed\r\nany. But this unexpected, unhoped-for, unheard-of fortune sufficed you\r\nno longer when you once possessed it; you wished to double it, and\r\nhow?—by a murder! You succeeded, and then God snatched it from you, and\r\nbrought you to justice.”\r\n\r\n“It was not I who wished to kill the Jew,” said Caderousse; “it was La\r\nCarconte.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Monte Cristo, “and God,—I cannot say in justice, for his\r\njustice would have slain you,—but God, in his mercy, spared your life.”\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_ to transport me for life, how merciful!”\r\n\r\n“You thought it a mercy then, miserable wretch! The coward who feared\r\ndeath rejoiced at perpetual disgrace; for like all galley-slaves, you\r\nsaid, ‘I may escape from prison, I cannot from the grave.’ And you said\r\ntruly; the way was opened for you unexpectedly. An Englishman visited\r\nToulon, who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy, and his choice\r\nfell on you and your companion. You received a second fortune, money\r\nand tranquillity were restored to you, and you, who had been condemned\r\nto a felon’s life, might live as other men. Then, wretched creature,\r\nthen you tempted God a third time. ‘I have not enough,’ you said, when\r\nyou had more than you before possessed, and you committed a third\r\ncrime, without reason, without excuse. God is wearied; he has punished\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nCaderousse was fast sinking. “Give me drink,” said he: “I thirst—I\r\nburn!” Monte Cristo gave him a glass of water. “And yet that villain,\r\nBenedetto, will escape!”\r\n\r\n“No one, I tell you, will escape; Benedetto will be punished.”\r\n\r\n“Then, you, too, will be punished, for you did not do your duty as a\r\npriest—you should have prevented Benedetto from killing me.”\r\n\r\n“I?” said the count, with a smile which petrified the dying man, “when\r\nyou had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected\r\nmy breast! Yet perhaps if I had found you humble and penitent, I might\r\nhave prevented Benedetto from killing you; but I found you proud and\r\nblood-thirsty, and I left you in the hands of God.”\r\n\r\n“I do not believe there is a God,” howled Caderousse; “you do not\r\nbelieve it; you lie—you lie!”\r\n\r\n“Silence,” said the abbé; “you will force the last drop of blood from\r\nyour veins. What! you do not believe in God when he is striking you\r\ndead? you will not believe in him, who requires but a prayer, a word, a\r\ntear, and he will forgive? God, who might have directed the assassin’s\r\ndagger so as to end your career in a moment, has given you this quarter\r\nof an hour for repentance. Reflect, then, wretched man, and repent.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Caderousse, “no; I will not repent. There is no God; there\r\nis no Providence—all comes by chance.”\r\n\r\n“There is a Providence; there is a God,” said Monte Cristo, “of whom\r\nyou are a striking proof, as you lie in utter despair, denying him,\r\nwhile I stand before you, rich, happy, safe and entreating that God in\r\nwhom you endeavor not to believe, while in your heart you still believe\r\nin him.”\r\n\r\n“But who are you, then?” asked Caderousse, fixing his dying eyes on the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n“Look well at me!” said Monte Cristo, putting the light near his face.\r\n\r\n“Well, the abbé—the Abbé Busoni.” Monte Cristo took off the wig which\r\ndisfigured him, and let fall his black hair, which added so much to the\r\nbeauty of his pallid features.\r\n\r\n“Oh?” said Caderousse, thunderstruck, “but for that black hair, I\r\nshould say you were the Englishman, Lord Wilmore.”\r\n\r\n“I am neither the Abbé Busoni nor Lord Wilmore,” said Monte Cristo;\r\n“think again,—do you not recollect me?”\r\n\r\nThere was a magic effect in the count’s words, which once more revived\r\nthe exhausted powers of the miserable man.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” said he; “I think I have seen you and known you\r\nformerly.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Caderousse, you have seen me; you knew me once.”\r\n\r\n“Who, then, are you? and why, if you knew me, do you let me die?”\r\n\r\n“Because nothing can save you; your wounds are mortal. Had it been\r\npossible to save you, I should have considered it another proof of\r\nGod’s mercy, and I would again have endeavored to restore you, I swear\r\nby my father’s tomb.”\r\n\r\n“By your father’s tomb!” said Caderousse, supported by a supernatural\r\npower, and half-raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had\r\njust taken the oath which all men hold sacred; “who, then, are you?”\r\n\r\nThe count had watched the approach of death. He knew this was the last\r\nstruggle. He approached the dying man, and, leaning over him with a\r\ncalm and melancholy look, he whispered, “I am—I am——”\r\n\r\nAnd his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself\r\nappeared afraid to hear it. Caderousse, who had raised himself on his\r\nknees, and stretched out his arm, tried to draw back, then clasping his\r\nhands, and raising them with a desperate effort, “Oh, my God, my God!”\r\nsaid he, “pardon me for having denied thee; thou dost exist, thou art\r\nindeed man’s father in heaven, and his judge on earth. My God, my Lord,\r\nI have long despised thee! Pardon me, my God; receive me, Oh, my Lord!”\r\n\r\nCaderousse sighed deeply, and fell back with a groan. The blood no\r\nlonger flowed from his wounds. He was dead.\r\n\r\n“_One!_” said the count mysteriously, his eyes fixed on the corpse,\r\ndisfigured by so awful a death.\r\n\r\nTen minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived, the one\r\naccompanied by the porter, the other by Ali, and were received by the\r\nAbbé Busoni, who was praying by the side of the corpse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 84. Beauchamp\r\n\r\nThe daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation\r\nthroughout Paris for the next fortnight. The dying man had signed a\r\ndeposition declaring Benedetto to be the assassin. The police had\r\norders to make the strictest search for the murderer. Caderousse’s\r\nknife, dark lantern, bunch of keys, and clothing, excepting the\r\nwaistcoat, which could not be found, were deposited at the registry;\r\nthe corpse was conveyed to the morgue. The count told everyone that\r\nthis adventure had happened during his absence at Auteuil, and that he\r\nonly knew what was related by the Abbé Busoni, who that evening, by\r\nmere chance, had requested to pass the night in his house, to examine\r\nsome valuable books in his library.\r\n\r\nBertuccio alone turned pale whenever Benedetto’s name was mentioned in\r\nhis presence, but there was no reason why anyone should notice his\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nVillefort, being called on to prove the crime, was preparing his brief\r\nwith the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to\r\nspeak in criminal cases.\r\n\r\nBut three weeks had already passed, and the most diligent search had\r\nbeen unsuccessful; the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber\r\nby his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching\r\nmarriage of Mademoiselle Danglars to the Count Andrea Cavalcanti. It\r\nwas expected that this wedding would shortly take place, as the young\r\nman was received at the banker’s as the betrothed.\r\n\r\nLetters had been despatched to M. Cavalcanti, as the count’s father,\r\nwho highly approved of the union, regretted his inability to leave\r\nParma at that time, and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty\r\nthousand livres. It was agreed that the three millions should be\r\nintrusted to Danglars to invest; some persons had warned the young man\r\nof the circumstances of his future father-in-law, who had of late\r\nsustained repeated losses; but with sublime disinterestedness and\r\nconfidence the young man refused to listen, or to express a single\r\ndoubt to the baron.\r\n\r\nThe baron adored Count Andrea Cavalcanti; not so Mademoiselle Eugénie\r\nDanglars. With an instinctive hatred of matrimony, she suffered\r\nAndrea’s attentions in order to get rid of Morcerf; but when Andrea\r\nurged his suit, she betrayed an entire dislike to him. The baron might\r\npossibly have perceived it, but, attributing it to a caprice, feigned\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nThe delay demanded by Beauchamp had nearly expired. Morcerf appreciated\r\nthe advice of Monte Cristo to let things die away of their own accord.\r\nNo one had taken up the remark about the general, and no one had\r\nrecognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of Yanina the noble\r\ncount in the House of Peers.\r\n\r\nAlbert, however, felt no less insulted; the few lines which had\r\nirritated him were certainly intended as an insult. Besides, the manner\r\nin which Beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection\r\nin his heart. He cherished the thought of the duel, hoping to conceal\r\nits true cause even from his seconds. Beauchamp had not been seen since\r\nthe day he visited Albert, and those of whom the latter inquired always\r\ntold him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days.\r\nWhere he was no one knew.\r\n\r\nOne morning Albert was awakened by his valet de chambre, who announced\r\nBeauchamp. Albert rubbed his eyes, ordered his servant to introduce him\r\ninto the small smoking-room on the ground floor, dressed himself\r\nquickly, and went down.\r\n\r\nHe found Beauchamp pacing the room; on perceiving him Beauchamp\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n“Your arrival here, without waiting my visit at your house today, looks\r\nwell, sir,” said Albert. “Tell me, may I shake hands with you, saying,\r\n‘Beauchamp, acknowledge you have injured me, and retain my friendship,’\r\nor must I simply propose to you a choice of arms?”\r\n\r\n“Albert,” said Beauchamp, with a look of sorrow which stupefied the\r\nyoung man, “let us first sit down and talk.”\r\n\r\n“Rather, sir, before we sit down, I must demand your answer.”\r\n\r\n“Albert,” said the journalist, “these are questions which it is\r\ndifficult to answer.”\r\n\r\n“I will facilitate it by repeating the question, ‘Will you, or will you\r\nnot, retract?’”\r\n\r\n“Morcerf, it is not enough to answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to questions which\r\nconcern the honor, the social interest, and the life of such a man as\r\nLieutenant-général the Count of Morcerf, peer of France.”\r\n\r\n“What must then be done?”\r\n\r\n40174m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What I have done, Albert. I reasoned thus—money, time, and fatigue are\r\nnothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family;\r\nprobabilities will not suffice, only facts will justify a deadly combat\r\nwith a friend. If I strike with the sword, or discharge the contents of\r\na pistol at man with whom, for three years, I have been on terms of\r\nintimacy, I must, at least, know why I do so; I must meet him with a\r\nheart at ease, and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own\r\narm must save his life.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Morcerf, impatiently, “what does all this mean?”\r\n\r\n“It means that I have just returned from Yanina.”\r\n\r\n“From Yanina?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!”\r\n\r\n“Here is my passport; examine the visa—Geneva, Milan, Venice, Trieste,\r\nDelvino, Yanina. Will you believe the government of a republic, a\r\nkingdom, and an empire?” Albert cast his eyes on the passport, then\r\nraised them in astonishment to Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“You have been to Yanina?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Albert, had you been a stranger, a foreigner, a simple lord, like that\r\nEnglishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since,\r\nand whom I killed to get rid of, I should not have taken this trouble;\r\nbut I thought this mark of consideration due to you. I took a week to\r\ngo, another to return, four days of quarantine, and forty-eight hours\r\nto stay there; that makes three weeks. I returned last night, and here\r\nI am.”\r\n\r\n“What circumlocution! How long you are before you tell me what I most\r\nwish to know?”\r\n\r\n“Because, in truth, Albert——”\r\n\r\n“You hesitate?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,—I fear.”\r\n\r\n“You fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you? Oh,\r\nno self-love, Beauchamp. Acknowledge it, Beauchamp; your courage cannot\r\nbe doubted.”\r\n\r\n“Not so,” murmured the journalist; “on the contrary——”\r\n\r\nAlbert turned frightfully pale; he endeavored to speak, but the words\r\ndied on his lips.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Beauchamp, in the most affectionate tone, “I should\r\ngladly make an apology; but, alas!——”\r\n\r\n“But what?”\r\n\r\n“The paragraph was correct, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“What? That French officer——”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Fernand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“The traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he\r\nwas——”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, my friend, that man was your father!”\r\n\r\nAlbert advanced furiously towards Beauchamp, but the latter restrained\r\nhim more by a mild look than by his extended hand.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said he, “here is a proof of it.”\r\n\r\n40176m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbert opened the paper, it was an attestation of four notable\r\ninhabitants of Yanina, proving that Colonel Fernand Mondego, in the\r\nservice of Ali Tepelini, had surrendered the castle for two million\r\ncrowns. The signatures were perfectly legal. Albert tottered and fell\r\noverpowered in a chair. It could no longer be doubted; the family name\r\nwas fully given. After a moment’s mournful silence, his heart\r\noverflowed, and he gave way to a flood of tears. Beauchamp, who had\r\nwatched with sincere pity the young man’s paroxysm of grief, approached\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Now, Albert,” said he, “you understand me—do you not? I wished to see\r\nall, and to judge of everything for myself, hoping the explanation\r\nwould be in your father’s favor, and that I might do him justice. But,\r\non the contrary, the particulars which are given prove that Fernand\r\nMondego, raised by Ali Pasha to the rank of governor-general, is no\r\nother than Count Fernand of Morcerf; then, recollecting the honor you\r\nhad done me, in admitting me to your friendship, I hastened to you.”\r\n\r\nAlbert, still extended on the chair, covered his face with both hands,\r\nas if to prevent the light from reaching him.\r\n\r\n“I hastened to you,” continued Beauchamp, “to tell you, Albert, that in\r\nthis changing age, the faults of a father cannot revert upon his\r\nchildren. Few have passed through this revolutionary period, in the\r\nmidst of which we were born, without some stain of infamy or blood to\r\nsoil the uniform of the soldier, or the gown of the magistrate. Now I\r\nhave these proofs, Albert, and I am in your confidence, no human power\r\ncan force me to a duel which your own conscience would reproach you\r\nwith as criminal, but I come to offer you what you can no longer demand\r\nof me. Do you wish these proofs, these attestations, which I alone\r\npossess, to be destroyed? Do you wish this frightful secret to remain\r\nwith us? Confided to me, it shall never escape my lips; say, Albert, my\r\nfriend, do you wish it?”\r\n\r\nAlbert threw himself on Beauchamp’s neck.\r\n\r\n“Ah, noble fellow!” cried he.\r\n\r\n“Take these,” said Beauchamp, presenting the papers to Albert.\r\n\r\nAlbert seized them with a convulsive hand, tore them in pieces, and\r\ntrembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to\r\nconfront him, he approached the wax-light, always kept burning for\r\ncigars, and burned every fragment.\r\n\r\n“Dear, excellent friend,” murmured Albert, still burning the papers.\r\n\r\n“Let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream,” said Beauchamp; “let it\r\nvanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper, and disappear as\r\nthe smoke from those silent ashes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” said Albert, “and may there remain only the eternal\r\nfriendship which I promised to my deliverer, which shall be transmitted\r\nto our children’s children, and shall always remind me that I owe my\r\nlife and the honor of my name to you,—for had this been known, oh,\r\nBeauchamp, I should have destroyed myself; or,—no, my poor mother! I\r\ncould not have killed her by the same blow,—I should have fled from my\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Albert,” said Beauchamp. But this sudden and factitious joy soon\r\nforsook the young man, and was succeeded by a still greater grief.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Beauchamp, “what still oppresses you, my friend?”\r\n\r\n40178m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I am broken-hearted,” said Albert. “Listen, Beauchamp! I cannot thus,\r\nin a moment relinquish the respect, the confidence, and pride with\r\nwhich a father’s untarnished name inspires a son. Oh, Beauchamp,\r\nBeauchamp, how shall I now approach mine? Shall I draw back my forehead\r\nfrom his embrace, or withhold my hand from his? I am the most wretched\r\nof men. Ah, my mother, my poor mother!” said Albert, gazing through his\r\ntears at his mother’s portrait; “if you know this, how much must you\r\nsuffer!”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Beauchamp, taking both his hands, “take courage, my\r\nfriend.”\r\n\r\n“But how came that first note to be inserted in your journal? Some\r\nunknown enemy—an invisible foe—has done this.”\r\n\r\n“The more must you fortify yourself, Albert. Let no trace of emotion be\r\nvisible on your countenance, bear your grief as the cloud bears within\r\nit ruin and death—a fatal secret, known only when the storm bursts. Go,\r\nmy friend, reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall\r\ncome.”\r\n\r\n40179m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You think, then, all is not over yet?” said Albert, horror-stricken.\r\n\r\n“I think nothing, my friend; but all things are possible. By the way——”\r\n\r\n“What?” said Albert, seeing that Beauchamp hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars?”\r\n\r\n“Why do you ask me now?”\r\n\r\n“Because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with\r\nthe person of whom we were speaking.”\r\n\r\n“How?” said Albert, whose brow reddened; “you think M. Danglars——”\r\n\r\n“I ask you only how your engagement stands? Pray put no construction on\r\nmy words I do not mean they should convey, and give them no undue\r\nweight.”\r\n\r\n“No.” said Albert, “the engagement is broken off.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Beauchamp. Then, seeing the young man was about to relapse\r\ninto melancholy, “Let us go out, Albert,” said he; “a ride in the wood\r\nin the phaeton, or on horseback, will refresh you; we will then return\r\nto breakfast, and you shall attend to your affairs, and I to mine.”\r\n\r\n“Willingly,” said Albert; “but let us walk. I think a little exertion\r\nwould do me good.”\r\n\r\nThe two friends walked out on the fortress. When they arrived at the\r\nMadeleine:\r\n\r\n“Since we are out,” said Beauchamp, “let us call on M. de Monte Cristo;\r\nhe is admirably adapted to revive one’s spirits, because he never\r\ninterrogates, and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best\r\ncomforters.”\r\n\r\n“Gladly,” said Albert; “let us call—I love him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 85. The Journey\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men\r\ntogether. “Ah, ha!” said he, “I hope all is over, explained and\r\nsettled.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Beauchamp; “the absurd reports have died away, and should\r\nthey be renewed, I would be the first to oppose them; so let us speak\r\nno more of it.”\r\n\r\n“Albert will tell you,” replied the count “that I gave him the same\r\nadvice. Look,” added he. “I am finishing the most execrable morning’s\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” said Albert; “arranging your papers, apparently.”\r\n\r\n“My papers, thank God, no,—my papers are all in capital order, because\r\nI have none; but M. Cavalcanti’s.”\r\n\r\n“M. Cavalcanti’s?” asked Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Yes; do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is\r\nintroducing?” said Morcerf.\r\n\r\n“Let us not misunderstand each other,” replied Monte Cristo; “I\r\nintroduce no one, and certainly not M. Cavalcanti.”\r\n\r\n“And who,” said Albert with a forced smile, “is to marry Mademoiselle\r\nDanglars instead of me, which grieves me cruelly.”\r\n\r\n“What? Cavalcanti is going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars?” asked\r\nBeauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Certainly! do you come from the end of the world?” said Monte Cristo;\r\n“you, a journalist, the husband of renown? It is the talk of all\r\nParis.”\r\n\r\n“And you, count, have made this match?” asked Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“I? Silence, purveyor of gossip, do not spread that report. I make a\r\nmatch? No, you do not know me; I have done all in my power to oppose\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I understand,” said Beauchamp, “on our friend Albert’s account.”\r\n\r\n“On my account?” said the young man; “oh, no, indeed, the count will do\r\nme the justice to assert that I have, on the contrary, always entreated\r\nhim to break off my engagement, and happily it is ended. The count\r\npretends I have not him to thank;—so be it—I will erect an altar _Deo\r\nignoto_.”\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said Monte Cristo; “I have had little to do with it, for I am\r\nat variance both with the father-in-law and the young man; there is\r\nonly Mademoiselle Eugénie, who appears but little charmed with the\r\nthoughts of matrimony, and who, seeing how little I was disposed to\r\npersuade her to renounce her dear liberty, retains any affection for\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“And do you say this wedding is at hand?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, in spite of all I could say. I do not know the young man; he\r\nis said to be of good family and rich, but I never trust to vague\r\nassertions. I have warned M. Danglars of it till I am tired, but he is\r\nfascinated with his Luccanese. I have even informed him of a\r\ncircumstance I consider very serious; the young man was either charmed\r\nby his nurse, stolen by gypsies, or lost by his tutor, I scarcely know\r\nwhich. But I do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten\r\nyears; what he did during these ten years, God only knows. Well, all\r\nthat was useless. They have commissioned me to write to the major to\r\ndemand papers, and here they are. I send them, but like Pilate—washing\r\nmy hands.”\r\n\r\n“And what does Mademoiselle d’Armilly say to you for robbing her of her\r\npupil?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, I don’t know; but I understand that she is going to Italy.\r\nMadame Danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the\r\n_impresari_; I gave her a few lines for the director of the Valle\r\nTheatre, who is under some obligation to me. But what is the matter,\r\nAlbert? you look dull; are you, after all, unconsciously in love with\r\nMademoiselle Eugénie?”\r\n\r\n“I am not aware of it,” said Albert, smiling sorrowfully. Beauchamp\r\nturned to look at some paintings.\r\n\r\n“But,” continued Monte Cristo, “you are not in your usual spirits?”\r\n\r\n“I have a dreadful headache,” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear viscount,” said Monte Cristo, “I have an infallible\r\nremedy to propose to you.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” asked the young man.\r\n\r\n“A change.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“Yes; and as I am just now excessively annoyed, I shall go from home.\r\nShall we go together?”\r\n\r\n“You annoyed, count?” said Beauchamp; “and by what?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you think very lightly of it; I should like to see you with a\r\nbrief preparing in your house.”\r\n\r\n“What brief?”\r\n\r\n“The one M. de Villefort is preparing against my amiable assassin—some\r\nbrigand escaped from the gallows apparently.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Beauchamp; “I saw it in the paper. Who is this\r\nCaderousse?”\r\n\r\n“Some Provençal, it appears. M. de Villefort heard of him at\r\nMarseilles, and M. Danglars recollects having seen him. Consequently,\r\nthe procureur is very active in the affair, and the prefect of police\r\nvery much interested; and, thanks to that interest, for which I am very\r\ngrateful, they send me all the robbers of Paris and the neighborhood,\r\nunder pretence of their being Caderousse’s murderers, so that in three\r\nmonths, if this continues, every robber and assassin in France will\r\nhave the plan of my house at his fingers’ ends. I am resolved to desert\r\nthem and go to some remote corner of the earth, and shall be happy if\r\nyou will accompany me, viscount.”\r\n\r\n“Willingly.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is settled?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but where?”\r\n\r\n“I have told you, where the air is pure, where every sound soothes,\r\nwhere one is sure to be humbled, however proud may be his nature. I\r\nlove that humiliation, I, who am master of the universe, as was\r\nAugustus.”\r\n\r\n“But where are you really going?”\r\n\r\n“To sea, viscount; you know I am a sailor. I was rocked when an infant\r\nin the arms of old Ocean, and on the bosom of the beautiful Amphitrite;\r\nI have sported with the green mantle of the one and the azure robe of\r\nthe other; I love the sea as a mistress, and pine if I do not often see\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go, count.”\r\n\r\n“To sea?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You accept my proposal?”\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“Well, viscount, there will be in my courtyard this evening a good\r\ntravelling britzka, with four post-horses, in which one may rest as in\r\na bed. M. Beauchamp, it holds four very well, will you accompany us?”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, I have just returned from sea.”\r\n\r\n“What? you have been to sea?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I have just made a little excursion to the Borromean Islands18.”\r\n\r\n“What of that? come with us,” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“No, dear Morcerf; you know I only refuse when the thing is impossible.\r\nBesides, it is important,” added he in a low tone, “that I should\r\nremain in Paris just now to watch the paper.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you are a good and an excellent friend,” said Albert; “yes, you\r\nare right; watch, watch, Beauchamp, and try to discover the enemy who\r\nmade this disclosure.”\r\n\r\nAlbert and Beauchamp parted, the last pressure of their hands\r\nexpressing what their tongues could not before a stranger.\r\n\r\n“Beauchamp is a worthy fellow,” said Monte Cristo, when the journalist\r\nwas gone; “is he not, Albert?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and a sincere friend; I love him devotedly. But now we are\r\nalone,—although it is immaterial to me,—where are we going?”\r\n\r\n“Into Normandy, if you like.”\r\n\r\n“Delightful; shall we be quite retired? have no society, no neighbors?”\r\n\r\n“Our companions will be riding-horses, dogs to hunt with, and a\r\nfishing-boat.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly what I wish for; I will apprise my mother of my intention, and\r\nreturn to you.”\r\n\r\n“But shall you be allowed to go into Normandy?”\r\n\r\n“I may go where I please.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am aware you may go alone, since I once met you in Italy—but to\r\naccompany the mysterious Monte Cristo?”\r\n\r\n“You forget, count, that I have often told you of the deep interest my\r\nmother takes in you.”\r\n\r\n“‘Woman is fickle.’ said Francis I.; ‘woman is like a wave of the sea,’\r\nsaid Shakespeare; both the great king and the great poet ought to have\r\nknown woman’s nature well.”\r\n\r\n“Woman’s, yes; my mother is not woman, but _a_ woman.”\r\n\r\n“As I am only a humble foreigner, you must pardon me if I do not\r\nunderstand all the subtle refinements of your language.”\r\n\r\n“What I mean to say is, that my mother is not quick to give her\r\nconfidence, but when she does she never changes.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, indeed,” said Monte Cristo with a sigh; “and do you think she\r\nis in the least interested in me?”\r\n\r\n“I repeat it, you must really be a very strange and superior man, for\r\nmy mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited, that when I\r\nam with her she speaks of no one else.”\r\n\r\n“And does she try to make you dislike me?”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, she often says, ‘Morcerf, I believe the count has a\r\nnoble nature; try to gain his esteem.’”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo, sighing.\r\n\r\n“You see, then,” said Albert, “that instead of opposing, she will\r\nencourage me.”\r\n\r\n“Adieu, then, until five o’clock; be punctual, and we shall arrive at\r\ntwelve or one.”\r\n\r\n“At Tréport?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; or in the neighborhood.”\r\n\r\n“But can we travel forty-eight leagues in eight hours?”\r\n\r\n“Easily,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“You are certainly a prodigy; you will soon not only surpass the\r\nrailway, which would not be very difficult in France, but even the\r\ntelegraph.”\r\n\r\n“But, viscount, since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven\r\nor eight hours, do not keep me waiting.”\r\n\r\n“Do not fear, I have little to prepare.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo smiled as he nodded to Albert, then remained a moment\r\nabsorbed in deep meditation. But passing his hand across his forehead\r\nas if to dispel his reverie, he rang the bell twice and Bertuccio\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n“Bertuccio,” said he, “I intend going this evening to Normandy, instead\r\nof tomorrow or the next day. You will have sufficient time before five\r\no’clock; despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first\r\nstation. M. de Morcerf will accompany me.”\r\n\r\nBertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to Pontoise to say the\r\ntravelling-carriage would arrive at six o’clock. From Pontoise another\r\nexpress was sent to the next stage, and in six hours all the horses\r\nstationed on the road were ready.\r\n\r\nBefore his departure, the count went to Haydée’s apartments, told her\r\nhis intention, and resigned everything to her care.\r\n\r\nAlbert was punctual. The journey soon became interesting from its\r\nrapidity, of which Morcerf had formed no previous idea.\r\n\r\n“Truly,” said Monte Cristo, “with your post-horses going at the rate of\r\ntwo leagues an hour, and that absurd law that one traveller shall not\r\npass another without permission, so that an invalid or ill-tempered\r\ntraveller may detain those who are well and active, it is impossible to\r\nmove; I escape this annoyance by travelling with my own postilion and\r\nhorses; do I not, Ali?”\r\n\r\nThe count put his head out of the window and whistled, and the horses\r\nappeared to fly. The carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the\r\npavement, and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor. Ali,\r\nsmiling, repeated the sound, grasped the reins with a firm hand, and\r\nspurred his horses, whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze. This\r\nchild of the desert was in his element, and with his black face and\r\nsparkling eyes appeared, in the cloud of dust he raised, like the\r\ngenius of the simoom and the god of the hurricane.\r\n\r\n“I never knew till now the delight of speed,” said Morcerf, and the\r\nlast cloud disappeared from his brow; “but where the devil do you get\r\nsuch horses? Are they made to order?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely,” said the count; “six years since I bought a horse in\r\nHungary remarkable for its swiftness. The thirty-two that we shall use\r\ntonight are its progeny; they are all entirely black, with the\r\nexception of a star upon the forehead.”\r\n\r\n“That is perfectly admirable; but what do you do, count, with all these\r\nhorses?”\r\n\r\n“You see, I travel with them.”\r\n\r\n“But you are not always travelling.”\r\n\r\n“When I no longer require them, Bertuccio will sell them, and he\r\nexpects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale.”\r\n\r\n“But no monarch in Europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them.”\r\n\r\n“Then he will sell them to some Eastern vizier, who will empty his\r\ncoffers to purchase them, and refill them by applying the bastinado to\r\nhis subjects.”\r\n\r\n“Count, may I suggest one idea to you?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“It is that, next to you, Bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in\r\nEurope.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, viscount; I believe he has not a franc in his\r\npossession.”\r\n\r\n“Then he must be a wonder. My dear count, if you tell me many more\r\nmarvellous things, I warn you I shall not believe them.”\r\n\r\n“I countenance nothing that is marvellous, M. Albert. Tell me, why does\r\na steward rob his master?”\r\n\r\n“Because, I suppose, it is his nature to do so, for the love of\r\nrobbing.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken; it is because he has a wife and family, and\r\nambitious desires for himself and them. Also because he is not sure of\r\nalways retaining his situation, and wishes to provide for the future.\r\nNow, M. Bertuccio is alone in the world; he uses my property without\r\naccounting for the use he makes of it; he is sure never to leave my\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because I should never get a better.”\r\n\r\n“Probabilities are deceptive.”\r\n\r\n“But I deal in certainties; he is the best servant over whom one has\r\nthe power of life and death.”\r\n\r\n“Do you possess that right over Bertuccio?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThere are words which close a conversation with an iron door; such was\r\nthe count’s “yes.”\r\n\r\nThe whole journey was performed with equal rapidity; the thirty-two\r\nhorses, dispersed over seven stages, brought them to their destination\r\nin eight hours. At midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful\r\npark. The porter was in attendance; he had been apprised by the groom\r\nof the last stage of the count’s approach. At half past two in the\r\nmorning Morcerf was conducted to his apartments, where a bath and\r\nsupper were prepared. The servant who had travelled at the back of the\r\ncarriage waited on him; Baptistin, who rode in front, attended the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\nAlbert bathed, took his supper, and went to bed. All night he was\r\nlulled by the melancholy noise of the surf. On rising, he went to his\r\nwindow, which opened on a terrace, having the sea in front, and at the\r\nback a pretty park bounded by a small forest.\r\n\r\nIn a creek lay a little sloop, with a narrow keel and high masts,\r\nbearing on its flag the Monte Cristo arms which were a mountain _or_,\r\non a sea _azure_, with a cross _gules_ in chief which might be an\r\nallusion to his name that recalled Calvary, the mount rendered by our\r\nLord’s passion more precious than gold, and to the degrading cross\r\nwhich his blood had rendered holy; or it might be some personal\r\nremembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this\r\nmysterious personage’s past life.\r\n\r\nAround the schooner lay a number of small fishing-boats belonging to\r\nthe fishermen of the neighboring village, like humble subjects awaiting\r\norders from their queen. There, as in every spot where Monte Cristo\r\nstopped, if but for two days, luxury abounded and life went on with the\r\nutmost ease.\r\n\r\nAlbert found in his anteroom two guns, with all the accoutrements for\r\nhunting; a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious\r\ninstruments the English—eminent in piscatory pursuits, since they are\r\npatient and sluggish—have invented for fishing. The day passed in\r\npursuing those exercises in which Monte Cristo excelled. They killed a\r\ndozen pheasants in the park, as many trout in the stream, dined in a\r\nsummer-house overlooking the ocean, and took tea in the library.\r\n\r\nTowards the evening of the third day. Albert, completely exhausted with\r\nthe exercise which invigorated Monte Cristo, was sleeping in an\r\narmchair near the window, while the count was designing with his\r\narchitect the plan of a conservatory in his house, when the sound of a\r\nhorse at full speed on the high road made Albert look up. He was\r\ndisagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre, whom he had not\r\nbrought, that he might not inconvenience Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n40188m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Florentin here!” cried he, starting up; “is my mother ill?” And he\r\nhastened to the door. Monte Cristo watched and saw him approach the\r\nvalet, who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket, containing a\r\nnewspaper and a letter.\r\n\r\n“From whom is this?” said he eagerly.\r\n\r\n“From M. Beauchamp,” replied Florentin.\r\n\r\n“Did he send you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; he sent for me to his house, gave me money for my journey,\r\nprocured a horse, and made me promise not to stop till I had reached\r\nyou, I have come in fifteen hours.”\r\n\r\nAlbert opened the letter with fear, uttered a shriek on reading the\r\nfirst line, and seized the paper. His sight was dimmed, his legs sank\r\nunder him, and he would have fallen had not Florentin supported him.\r\n\r\n“Poor young man,” said Monte Cristo in a low voice; “it is then true\r\nthat the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and\r\nfourth generation.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Albert had revived, and, continuing to read, he threw back\r\nhis head, saying:\r\n\r\n“Florentin, is your horse fit to return immediately?”\r\n\r\n“It is a poor, lame post-horse.”\r\n\r\n“In what state was the house when you left?”\r\n\r\n“All was quiet, but on returning from M. Beauchamp’s, I found madame in\r\ntears; she had sent for me to know when you would return. I told her my\r\norders from M. Beauchamp; she first extended her arms to prevent me,\r\nbut after a moment’s reflection, ‘Yes, go, Florentin,’ said she, ‘and\r\nmay he come quickly.’”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my mother,” said Albert, “I will return, and woe to the infamous\r\nwretch! But first of all I must get there.”\r\n\r\nHe went back to the room where he had left Monte Cristo. Five minutes\r\nhad sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance. His\r\nvoice had become rough and hoarse; his face was furrowed with wrinkles;\r\nhis eyes burned under the blue-veined lids, and he tottered like a\r\ndrunken man.\r\n\r\n“Count,” said he, “I thank you for your hospitality, which I would\r\ngladly have enjoyed longer; but I must return to Paris.”\r\n\r\n“What has happened?”\r\n\r\n“A great misfortune, more important to me than life. Don’t question me,\r\nI beg of you, but lend me a horse.”\r\n\r\n“My stables are at your command, viscount; but you will kill yourself\r\nby riding on horseback. Take a post-chaise or a carriage.”\r\n\r\n“No, it would delay me, and I need the fatigue you warn me of; it will\r\ndo me good.”\r\n\r\nAlbert reeled as if he had been shot, and fell on a chair near the\r\ndoor. Monte Cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical\r\nexhaustion; he was at the window, calling:\r\n\r\n“Ali, a horse for M. de Morcerf—quick! he is in a hurry!”\r\n\r\n40190m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese words restored Albert; he darted from the room, followed by the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n“Thank you!” cried he, throwing himself on his horse.\r\n\r\n“Return as soon as you can, Florentin. Must I use any password to\r\nprocure a horse?”\r\n\r\n“Only dismount; another will be immediately saddled.”\r\n\r\nAlbert hesitated a moment. “You may think my departure strange and\r\nfoolish,” said the young man; “you do not know how a paragraph in a\r\nnewspaper may exasperate one. Read that,” said he, “when I am gone,\r\nthat you may not be witness of my anger.”\r\n\r\nWhile the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse, which\r\nleaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus, and shot away with\r\nthe rapidity of an arrow. The count watched him with a feeling of\r\ncompassion, and when he had completely disappeared, read as follows:\r\n\r\n“The French officer in the service of Ali Pasha of Yanina alluded to\r\nthree weeks since in _l’Impartial_, who not only surrendered the castle\r\nof Yanina, but sold his benefactor to the Turks, styled himself truly\r\nat that time Fernand, as our esteemed contemporary states; but he has\r\nsince added to his Christian name a title of nobility and a family\r\nname. He now calls himself the Count of Morcerf, and ranks among the\r\npeers.”\r\n\r\nThus the terrible secret, which Beauchamp had so generously destroyed,\r\nappeared again like an armed phantom; and another paper, deriving its\r\ninformation from some malicious source, had published two days after\r\nAlbert’s departure for Normandy the few lines which had rendered the\r\nunfortunate young man almost crazy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 86. The Trial\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock in the morning Albert had arrived at Beauchamp’s door.\r\nThe valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once.\r\nBeauchamp was in his bath.\r\n\r\n“Here I am,” Albert said.\r\n\r\n“Well, my poor friend,” replied Beauchamp, “I expected you.”\r\n\r\n“I need not say I think you are too faithful and too kind to have\r\nspoken of that painful circumstance. Your having sent for me is another\r\nproof of your affection. So, without losing time, tell me, have you the\r\nslightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds?”\r\n\r\n“I think I have some clew.”\r\n\r\n“But first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot.”\r\n\r\nBeauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man, who was overwhelmed\r\nwith shame and grief, the following facts. Two days previously, the\r\narticle had appeared in another paper besides _ l’Impartial_, and, what\r\nwas more serious, one that was well known as a government paper.\r\nBeauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph. He sent\r\nimmediately for a cabriolet, and hastened to the publisher’s office.\r\nAlthough professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the\r\neditor of the other paper, Beauchamp—as it sometimes, we may say often,\r\nhappens—was his intimate friend. The editor was reading, with apparent\r\ndelight, a leading article in the same paper on beet-sugar, probably a\r\ncomposition of his own.\r\n\r\n“Ah, _pardieu!_” said Beauchamp, “with the paper in your hand, my\r\nfriend, I need not tell you the cause of my visit.”\r\n\r\n“Are you interested in the sugar question?” asked the editor of the\r\nministerial paper.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Beauchamp, “I have not considered the question; a totally\r\ndifferent subject interests me.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“The article relative to Morcerf.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? Is it not a curious affair?”\r\n\r\n“So curious, that I think you are running a great risk of a prosecution\r\nfor defamation of character.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all; we have received with the information all the requisite\r\nproofs, and we are quite sure M. de Morcerf will not raise his voice\r\nagainst us; besides, it is rendering a service to one’s country to\r\ndenounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor\r\nbestowed on them.”\r\n\r\nBeauchamp was thunderstruck.\r\n\r\n“Who, then, has so correctly informed you?” asked he; “for my paper,\r\nwhich gave the first information on the subject, has been obliged to\r\nstop for want of proof; and yet we are more interested than you in\r\nexposing M. de Morcerf, as he is a peer of France, and we are of the\r\nopposition.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that is very simple; we have not sought to scandalize. This news\r\nwas brought to us. A man arrived yesterday from Yanina, bringing a\r\nformidable array of documents; and when we hesitated to publish the\r\naccusatory article, he told us it should be inserted in some other\r\npaper.”\r\n\r\nBeauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit, and left the\r\noffice to despatch a courier to Morcerf. But he had been unable to send\r\nto Albert the following particulars, as the events had transpired after\r\nthe messenger’s departure; namely, that the same day a great agitation\r\nwas manifest in the House of Peers among the usually calm members of\r\nthat dignified assembly. Everyone had arrived almost before the usual\r\nhour, and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract\r\nthe attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious\r\ncolleagues. Some were perusing the article, others making comments and\r\nrecalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more.\r\n\r\nThe Count of Morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues. Like all\r\nupstarts, he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to\r\nmaintain his position. The true nobility laughed at him, the talented\r\nrepelled him, and the honorable instinctively despised him. He was, in\r\nfact, in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice; the\r\nfinger of God once pointed at him, everyone was prepared to raise the\r\nhue and cry.\r\n\r\nThe Count of Morcerf alone was ignorant of the news. He did not take in\r\nthe paper containing the defamatory article, and had passed the morning\r\nin writing letters and in trying a horse. He arrived at his usual hour,\r\nwith a proud look and insolent demeanor; he alighted, passed through\r\nthe corridors, and entered the house without observing the hesitation\r\nof the door-keepers or the coolness of his colleagues.\r\n\r\n40194m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBusiness had already been going on for half an hour when he entered.\r\nEveryone held the accusing paper, but, as usual, no one liked to take\r\nupon himself the responsibility of the attack. At length an honorable\r\npeer, Morcerf’s acknowledged enemy, ascended the tribune with that\r\nsolemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived. There\r\nwas an impressive silence; Morcerf alone knew not why such profound\r\nattention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so\r\nmuch complacency.\r\n\r\nThe count did not notice the introduction, in which the speaker\r\nannounced that his communication would be of that vital importance that\r\nit demanded the undivided attention of the House; but at the mention of\r\nYanina and Colonel Fernand, he turned so frightfully pale that every\r\nmember shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him. Moral wounds have this\r\npeculiarity,—they may be hidden, but they never close; always painful,\r\nalways ready to bleed when touched, they remain fresh and open in the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe article having been read during the painful hush that followed, a\r\nuniversal shudder pervaded the assembly, and immediately the closest\r\nattention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks. He stated\r\nhis scruples and the difficulties of the case; it was the honor of M.\r\nde Morcerf, and that of the whole House, he proposed to defend, by\r\nprovoking a debate on personal questions, which are always such painful\r\nthemes of discussion. He concluded by calling for an investigation,\r\nwhich might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to\r\nspread, and restore M. de Morcerf to the position he had long held in\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nMorcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected\r\ncalamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around\r\non the assembly. This timidity, which might proceed from the\r\nastonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt, conciliated\r\nsome in his favor; for men who are truly generous are always ready to\r\ncompassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits\r\nof their hatred.\r\n\r\nThe president put it to the vote, and it was decided that the\r\ninvestigation should take place. The count was asked what time he\r\nrequired to prepare his defence. Morcerf’s courage had revived when he\r\nfound himself alive after this horrible blow.\r\n\r\n“My lords,” answered he, “it is not by time I could repel the attack\r\nmade on me by enemies unknown to me, and, doubtless, hidden in\r\nobscurity; it is immediately, and by a thunderbolt, that I must repel\r\nthe flash of lightning which, for a moment, startled me. Oh, that I\r\ncould, instead of taking up this defence, shed my last drop of blood to\r\nprove to my noble colleagues that I am their equal in worth.”\r\n\r\nThese words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused.\r\n\r\n“I demand, then, that the examination shall take place as soon as\r\npossible, and I will furnish the house with all necessary information.”\r\n\r\n“What day do you fix?” asked the president.\r\n\r\n“Today I am at your service,” replied the count.\r\n\r\nThe president rang the bell. “Does the House approve that the\r\nexamination should take place today?”\r\n\r\n40196m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes,” was the unanimous answer.\r\n\r\nA committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought\r\nforward by Morcerf. The investigation would begin at eight o’clock that\r\nevening in the committee-room, and if postponement were necessary, the\r\nproceedings would be resumed each evening at the same hour. Morcerf\r\nasked leave to retire; he had to collect the documents he had long been\r\npreparing against this storm, which his sagacity had foreseen.\r\n\r\nBeauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated;\r\nhis story, however, had over ours all the advantage of the animation of\r\nliving things over the coldness of dead things.\r\n\r\nAlbert listened, trembling now with hope, then with anger, and then\r\nagain with shame, for from Beauchamp’s confidence he knew his father\r\nwas guilty, and he asked himself how, since he was guilty, he could\r\nprove his innocence. Beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative.\r\n\r\n“What next?” asked Albert.\r\n\r\n“What next? My friend, you impose a painful task on me. Must you know\r\nall?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely; and rather from your lips than another’s.”\r\n\r\n“Muster up all your courage, then, for never have you required it\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\nAlbert passed his hand over his forehead, as if to try his strength, as\r\na man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends\r\nhis sword. He thought himself strong enough, for he mistook fever for\r\nenergy. “Go on,” said he.\r\n\r\n“The evening arrived; all Paris was in expectation. Many said your\r\nfather had only to show himself to crush the charge against him; many\r\nothers said he would not appear; while some asserted that they had seen\r\nhim start for Brussels; and others went to the police-office to inquire\r\nif he had taken out a passport. I used all my influence with one of the\r\ncommittee, a young peer of my acquaintance, to get admission to one of\r\nthe galleries. He called for me at seven o’clock, and, before anyone\r\nhad arrived, asked one of the door-keepers to place me in a box. I was\r\nconcealed by a column, and might witness the whole of the terrible\r\nscene which was about to take place. At eight o’clock all were in their\r\nplaces, and M. de Morcerf entered at the last stroke. He held some\r\npapers in his hand; his countenance was calm, and his step firm, and he\r\nwas dressed with great care in his military uniform, which was buttoned\r\ncompletely up to the chin. His presence produced a good effect. The\r\ncommittee was made up of Liberals, several of whom came forward to\r\nshake hands with him.”\r\n\r\nAlbert felt his heart bursting at these particulars, but gratitude\r\nmingled with his sorrow: he would gladly have embraced those who had\r\ngiven his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so\r\npowerfully attacked.\r\n\r\n“At this moment one of the door-keepers brought in a letter for the\r\npresident. ‘You are at liberty to speak, M. de Morcerf,’ said the\r\npresident, as he unsealed the letter; and the count began his defence,\r\nI assure you, Albert, in a most eloquent and skilful manner. He\r\nproduced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up to the last\r\nmoment honored him with his entire confidence, since he had interested\r\nhim with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor. He produced\r\nthe ring, his mark of authority, with which Ali Pasha generally sealed\r\nhis letters, and which the latter had given him, that he might, on his\r\nreturn at any hour of the day or night, gain access to the presence,\r\neven in the harem. Unfortunately, the negotiation failed, and when he\r\nreturned to defend his benefactor, he was dead. ‘But,’ said the count,\r\n‘so great was Ali Pasha’s confidence, that on his death-bed he resigned\r\nhis favorite mistress and her daughter to my care.’”\r\n\r\nAlbert started on hearing these words; the history of Haydée recurred\r\nto him, and he remembered what she had said of that message and the\r\nring, and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave.\r\n\r\n“And what effect did this discourse produce?” anxiously inquired\r\nAlbert.\r\n\r\n“I acknowledge it affected me, and, indeed, all the committee also,”\r\nsaid Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile, the president carelessly opened the letter which had been\r\nbrought to him; but the first lines aroused his attention; he read them\r\nagain and again, and fixing his eyes on M. de Morcerf, ‘Count,’ said\r\nhe, ‘you have said that the Vizier of Yanina confided his wife and\r\ndaughter to your care?’—‘Yes, sir,’ replied Morcerf; ‘but in that, like\r\nall the rest, misfortune pursued me. On my return, Vasiliki and her\r\ndaughter Haydée had disappeared.’—‘Did you know them?’—‘My intimacy\r\nwith the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an\r\nintroduction to them, and I had seen them above twenty times.’\r\n\r\n“‘Have you any idea what became of them?’—‘Yes, sir; I heard they had\r\nfallen victims to their sorrow, and, perhaps, to their poverty. I was\r\nnot rich; my life was in constant danger; I could not seek them, to my\r\ngreat regret.’ The president frowned imperceptibly. ‘Gentlemen,’ said\r\nhe, ‘you have heard the Comte de Morcerf’s defence. Can you, sir,\r\nproduce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted?’—‘Alas,\r\nno, monsieur,’ replied the count; ‘all those who surrounded the vizier,\r\nor who knew me at his court, are either dead or gone away, I know not\r\nwhere. I believe that I alone, of all my countrymen, survived that\r\ndreadful war. I have only the letters of Ali Tepelini, which I have\r\nplaced before you; the ring, a token of his good-will, which is here;\r\nand, lastly, the most convincing proof I can offer, after an anonymous\r\nattack, and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and\r\nthe purity of my military life.’\r\n\r\n“A murmur of approbation ran through the assembly; and at this moment,\r\nAlbert, had nothing more transpired, your father’s cause had been\r\ngained. It only remained to put it to the vote, when the president\r\nresumed: ‘Gentlemen and you, monsieur,—you will not be displeased, I\r\npresume, to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness,\r\nand who has just presented himself. He is, doubtless, come to prove the\r\nperfect innocence of our colleague. Here is a letter I have just\r\nreceived on the subject; shall it be read, or shall it be passed over?\r\nand shall we take no notice of this incident?’ M. de Morcerf turned\r\npale, and clenched his hands on the papers he held. The committee\r\ndecided to hear the letter; the count was thoughtful and silent. The\r\npresident read:\r\n\r\n“‘Mr. President,—I can furnish the committee of inquiry into the\r\nconduct of the Lieutenant-General the Count of Morcerf in Epirus and in\r\nMacedonia with important particulars.’\r\n\r\n“The president paused, and the count turned pale. The president looked\r\nat his auditors. ‘Proceed,’ was heard on all sides. The president\r\nresumed:\r\n\r\n“‘I was on the spot at the death of Ali Pasha. I was present during his\r\nlast moments. I know what is become of Vasiliki and Haydée. I am at the\r\ncommand of the committee, and even claim the honor of being heard. I\r\nshall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you.’\r\n\r\n“‘And who is this witness, or rather this enemy?’ asked the count, in a\r\ntone in which there was a visible alteration. ‘We shall know, sir,’\r\nreplied the president. ‘Is the committee willing to hear this\r\nwitness?’—‘Yes, yes,’ they all said at once. The door-keeper was\r\ncalled. ‘Is there anyone in the lobby?’ said the president.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, sir.’—‘Who is it?’—‘A woman, accompanied by a servant.’ Everyone\r\nlooked at his neighbor. ‘Bring her in,’ said the president. Five\r\nminutes after the door-keeper again appeared; all eyes were fixed on\r\nthe door, and I,” said Beauchamp, “shared the general expectation and\r\nanxiety. Behind the door-keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large\r\nveil, which completely concealed her. It was evident, from her figure\r\nand the perfumes she had about her, that she was young and fastidious\r\nin her tastes, but that was all. The president requested her to throw\r\naside her veil, and it was then seen that she was dressed in the\r\nGrecian costume, and was remarkably beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Albert, “it was she.”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Haydée.”\r\n\r\n“Who told you that?”\r\n\r\n“Alas, I guess it. But go on, Beauchamp. You see I am calm and strong.\r\nAnd yet we must be drawing near the disclosure.”\r\n\r\n“M. de Morcerf,” continued Beauchamp, “looked at this woman with\r\nsurprise and terror. Her lips were about to pass his sentence of life\r\nor death. To the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and\r\ncurious, that the interest they had felt for the count’s safety became\r\nnow quite a secondary matter. The president himself advanced to place a\r\nseat for the young lady; but she declined availing herself of it. As\r\nfor the count, he had fallen on his chair; it was evident that his legs\r\nrefused to support him.\r\n\r\n“‘Madame,’ said the president, ‘you have engaged to furnish the\r\ncommittee with some important particulars respecting the affair at\r\nYanina, and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the\r\nevent.’—‘I was, indeed,’ said the stranger, with a tone of sweet\r\nmelancholy, and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the East.\r\n\r\n“‘But allow me to say that you must have been very young then.’—‘I was\r\nfour years old; but as those events deeply concerned me, not a single\r\ndetail has escaped my memory.’—‘In what manner could these events\r\nconcern you? and who are you, that they should have made so deep an\r\nimpression on you?’—‘On them depended my father’s life,’ replied she.\r\n‘I am Haydée, the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\r\nVasiliki, his beloved wife.’\r\n\r\n40202m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the\r\ncheeks of the young woman, the brilliancy of her eye, and her highly\r\nimportant communication, produced an indescribable effect on the\r\nassembly. As for the count, he could not have been more overwhelmed if\r\na thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“‘Madame,’ replied the president, bowing with profound respect, ‘allow\r\nme to ask one question; it shall be the last: Can you prove the\r\nauthenticity of what you have now stated?’\r\n\r\n“‘I can, sir,’ said Haydée, drawing from under her veil a satin satchel\r\nhighly perfumed; ‘for here is the register of my birth, signed by my\r\nfather and his principal officers, and that of my baptism, my father\r\nhaving consented to my being brought up in my mother’s faith,—this\r\nlatter has been sealed by the grand primate of Macedonia and Epirus;\r\nand lastly (and perhaps the most important), the record of the sale of\r\nmy person and that of my mother to the Armenian merchant El-Kobbir, by\r\nthe French officer, who, in his infamous bargain with the Porte, had\r\nreserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his\r\nbenefactor, whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs.’\r\nA greenish pallor spread over the count’s cheeks, and his eyes became\r\nbloodshot at these terrible imputations, which were listened to by the\r\nassembly with ominous silence.\r\n\r\n“Haydée, still calm, but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger\r\nof another would have been, handed to the president the record of her\r\nsale, written in Arabic. It had been supposed some of the papers might\r\nbe in the Arabian, Romaic, or Turkish language, and the interpreter of\r\nthe House was in attendance. One of the noble peers, who was familiar\r\nwith the Arabic language, having studied it during the famous Egyptian\r\ncampaign, followed with his eye as the translator read aloud:\r\n\r\n“‘I, El-Kobbir, a slave-merchant, and purveyor of the harem of his\r\nhighness, acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime\r\nemperor, from the French lord, the Count of Monte Cristo, an emerald\r\nvalued at eight hundred thousand francs; as the ransom of a young\r\nChristian slave of eleven years of age, named Haydée, the acknowledged\r\ndaughter of the late lord Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\r\nVasiliki, his favorite; she having been sold to me seven years\r\npreviously, with her mother, who had died on arriving at\r\nConstantinople, by a French colonel in the service of the Vizier Ali\r\nTepelini, named Fernand Mondego. The above-mentioned purchase was made\r\non his highness’s account, whose mandate I had, for the sum of four\r\nhundred thousand francs.\r\n\r\n“‘Given at Constantinople, by authority of his highness, in the year\r\n1247 of the Hegira.\r\n\r\n“‘Signed, El-Kobbir.’\r\n\r\n“‘That this record should have all due authority, it shall bear the\r\nimperial seal, which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it.’\r\n\r\n“Near the merchant’s signature there was, indeed, the seal of the\r\nsublime emperor. A dreadful silence followed the reading of this\r\ndocument; the count could only stare, and his gaze, fixed as if\r\nunconsciously on Haydée, seemed one of fire and blood. ‘Madame,’ said\r\nthe president, ‘may reference be made to the Count of Monte Cristo, who\r\nis now, I believe, in Paris?’\r\n\r\n“‘Sir,’ replied Haydée, ‘the Count of Monte Cristo, my foster-father,\r\nhas been in Normandy the last three days.’\r\n\r\n“‘Who, then, has counselled you to take this step, one for which the\r\ncourt is deeply indebted to you, and which is perfectly natural,\r\nconsidering your birth and your misfortunes?’—‘Sir,’ replied Haydée, ‘I\r\nhave been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief.\r\nAlthough a Christian, may God forgive me, I have always sought to\r\nrevenge my illustrious father. Since I set my foot in France, and knew\r\nthe traitor lived in Paris, I have watched carefully. I live retired in\r\nthe house of my noble protector, but I do it from choice. I love\r\nretirement and silence, because I can live with my thoughts and\r\nrecollections of past days. But the Count of Monte Cristo surrounds me\r\nwith every paternal care, and I am ignorant of nothing which passes in\r\nthe world. I learn all in the silence of my apartments,—for instance, I\r\nsee all the newspapers, every periodical, as well as every new piece of\r\nmusic; and by thus watching the course of the life of others, I learned\r\nwhat had transpired this morning in the House of Peers, and what was to\r\ntake place this evening; then I wrote.’\r\n\r\n40204m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘Then,’ remarked the president, ‘the Count of Monte Cristo knows\r\nnothing of your present proceedings?’—‘He is quite unaware of them, and\r\nI have but one fear, which is that he should disapprove of what I have\r\ndone. But it is a glorious day for me,’ continued the young girl,\r\nraising her ardent gaze to heaven, ‘that on which I find at last an\r\nopportunity of avenging my father!’\r\n\r\n“The count had not uttered one word the whole of this time. His\r\ncolleagues looked at him, and doubtless pitied his prospects, blighted\r\nunder the perfumed breath of a woman. His misery was depicted in\r\nsinister lines on his countenance. ‘M. de Morcerf,’ said the president,\r\n‘do you recognize this lady as the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of\r\nYanina?’—‘No,’ said Morcerf, attempting to rise, ‘it is a base plot,\r\ncontrived by my enemies.’ Haydée, whose eyes had been fixed on the\r\ndoor, as if expecting someone, turned hastily, and, seeing the count\r\nstanding, shrieked, ‘You do not know me?’ said she. ‘Well, I\r\nfortunately recognize you! You are Fernand Mondego, the French officer\r\nwho led the troops of my noble father! It is you who surrendered the\r\ncastle of Yanina! It is you who, sent by him to Constantinople, to\r\ntreat with the emperor for the life or death of your benefactor,\r\nbrought back a false mandate granting full pardon! It is you who, with\r\nthat mandate, obtained the pasha’s ring, which gave you authority over\r\nSelim, the fire-keeper! It is you who stabbed Selim. It is you who sold\r\nus, my mother and me, to the merchant, El-Kobbir! Assassin, assassin,\r\nassassin, you have still on your brow your master’s blood! Look,\r\ngentlemen, all!’\r\n\r\n“These words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident\r\ntruth, that every eye was fixed on the count’s forehead, and he himself\r\npassed his hand across it, as if he felt Ali’s blood still lingering\r\nthere. ‘You positively recognize M. de Morcerf as the officer, Fernand\r\nMondego?’—‘Indeed I do!’ cried Haydée. ‘Oh, my mother, it was you who\r\nsaid, “You were free, you had a beloved father, you were destined to be\r\nalmost a queen. Look well at that man; it is he who raised your\r\nfather’s head on the point of a spear; it is he who sold us; it is he\r\nwho forsook us! Look well at his right hand, on which he has a large\r\nwound; if you forgot his features, you would know him by that hand,\r\ninto which fell, one by one, the gold pieces of the merchant\r\nEl-Kobbir!” I know him! Ah, let him say now if he does not recognize\r\nme!’ Each word fell like a dagger on Morcerf, and deprived him of a\r\nportion of his energy; as she uttered the last, he hid his mutilated\r\nhand hastily in his bosom, and fell back on his seat, overwhelmed by\r\nwretchedness and despair. This scene completely changed the opinion of\r\nthe assembly respecting the accused count.\r\n\r\n“‘Count of Morcerf,’ said the president, ‘do not allow yourself to be\r\ncast down; answer. The justice of the court is supreme and impartial as\r\nthat of God; it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies\r\nwithout giving you an opportunity of defending yourself. Shall further\r\ninquiries be made? Shall two members of the House be sent to Yanina?\r\nSpeak!’ Morcerf did not reply. Then all the members looked at each\r\nother with terror. They knew the count’s energetic and violent temper;\r\nit must be, indeed, a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage\r\nto defend himself. They expected that his stupefied silence would be\r\nfollowed by a fiery outburst. ‘Well,’ asked the president, ‘what is\r\nyour decision?’\r\n\r\n40206m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘I have no reply to make,’ said the count in a low tone.\r\n\r\n“‘Has the daughter of Ali Tepelini spoken the truth?’ said the\r\npresident. ‘Is she, then, the terrible witness to whose charge you dare\r\nnot plead “Not guilty”? Have you really committed the crimes of which\r\nyou are accused?’ The count looked around him with an expression which\r\nmight have softened tigers, but which could not disarm his judges. Then\r\nhe raised his eyes towards the ceiling, but withdrew then, immediately,\r\nas if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view\r\nthat second tribunal called heaven, and that other judge named God.\r\nThen, with a hasty movement, he tore open his coat, which seemed to\r\nstifle him, and flew from the room like a madman; his footstep was\r\nheard one moment in the corridor, then the rattling of his\r\ncarriage-wheels as he was driven rapidly away. ‘Gentlemen,’ said the\r\npresident, when silence was restored, ‘is the Count of Morcerf\r\nconvicted of felony, treason, and conduct unbecoming a member of this\r\nHouse?’—‘Yes,’ replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with\r\na unanimous voice.\r\n\r\n“Haydée had remained until the close of the meeting. She heard the\r\ncount’s sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or\r\npity; then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the\r\ncouncillors, and left with that dignified step which Virgil attributes\r\nto his goddesses.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 87. The Challenge\r\n\r\nThen,” continued Beauchamp, “I took advantage of the silence and the\r\ndarkness to leave the house without being seen. The usher who had\r\nintroduced me was waiting for me at the door, and he conducted me\r\nthrough the corridors to a private entrance opening into the Rue de\r\nVaugirard. I left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight. Excuse\r\nme, Albert,—sorrow on your account, and delight with that noble girl,\r\nthus pursuing paternal vengeance. Yes, Albert, from whatever source the\r\nblow may have proceeded—it may be from an enemy, but that enemy is only\r\nthe agent of Providence.”\r\n\r\nAlbert held his head between his hands; he raised his face, red with\r\nshame and bathed in tears, and seizing Beauchamp’s arm:\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said he, “my life is ended. I cannot calmly say with you,\r\n‘Providence has struck the blow;’ but I must discover who pursues me\r\nwith this hatred, and when I have found him I shall kill him, or he\r\nwill kill me. I rely on your friendship to assist me, Beauchamp, if\r\ncontempt has not banished it from your heart.”\r\n\r\n“Contempt, my friend? How does this misfortune affect you? No, happily\r\nthat unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for\r\nthe father’s actions. Review your life, Albert; although it is only\r\njust beginning, did a lovely summer’s day ever dawn with greater purity\r\nthan has marked the commencement of your career? No, Albert, take my\r\nadvice. You are young and rich—leave Paris—all is soon forgotten in\r\nthis great Babylon of excitement and changing tastes. You will return\r\nafter three or four years with a Russian princess for a bride, and no\r\none will think more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened\r\nsixteen years ago.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, my dear Beauchamp, thank you for the excellent feeling\r\nwhich prompts your advice; but it cannot be. I have told you my wish,\r\nor rather my determination. You understand that, interested as I am in\r\nthis affair, I cannot see it in the same light as you do. What appears\r\nto you to emanate from a celestial source, seems to me to proceed from\r\none far less pure. Providence appears to me to have no share in this\r\naffair; and happily so, for instead of the invisible, impalpable agent\r\nof celestial rewards and punishments, I shall find one both palpable\r\nand visible, on whom I shall revenge myself, I assure you, for all I\r\nhave suffered during the last month. Now, I repeat, Beauchamp, I wish\r\nto return to human and material existence, and if you are still the\r\nfriend you profess to be, help me to discover the hand that struck the\r\nblow.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so,” said Beauchamp; “if you must have me descend to earth, I\r\nsubmit; and if you will seek your enemy, I will assist you, and I will\r\nengage to find him, my honor being almost as deeply interested as\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, you understand, Beauchamp, that we begin our search\r\nimmediately. Each moment’s delay is an eternity for me. The calumniator\r\nis not yet punished, and he may hope that he will not be; but, on my\r\nhonor, if he thinks so, he deceives himself.”\r\n\r\n“Well, listen, Morcerf.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Beauchamp, I see you know something already; you will restore me\r\nto life.”\r\n\r\n“I do not say there is any truth in what I am going to tell you, but it\r\nis, at least, a ray of light in a dark night; by following it we may,\r\nperhaps, discover something more certain.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me; satisfy my impatience.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will tell you what I did not like to mention on my return from\r\nYanina.”\r\n\r\n“Say on.”\r\n\r\n“I went, of course, to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries.\r\nAt the first word, before I had even mentioned your father’s name”—\r\n\r\n“‘Ah,’ said he. ‘I guess what brings you here.’\r\n\r\n“‘How, and why?’\r\n\r\n“‘Because a fortnight since I was questioned on the same subject.’\r\n\r\n“‘By whom?’\r\n\r\n“‘By a banker of Paris, my correspondent.’\r\n\r\n“‘Whose name is——’\r\n\r\n“‘Danglars.’”\r\n\r\n“He!” cried Albert; “yes, it is indeed he who has so long pursued my\r\nfather with jealous hatred. He, the man who would be popular, cannot\r\nforgive the Count of Morcerf for being created a peer; and this\r\nmarriage broken off without a reason being assigned—yes, it is all from\r\nthe same cause.”\r\n\r\n“Make inquiries, Albert, but do not be angry without reason; make\r\ninquiries, and if it be true——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, if it be true,” cried the young man, “he shall pay me all I\r\nhave suffered.”\r\n\r\n“Beware, Morcerf, he is already an old man.”\r\n\r\n“I will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family; if\r\nmy father had offended him, why did he not attack him personally? Oh,\r\nno, he was afraid to encounter him face to face.”\r\n\r\n“I do not condemn you, Albert; I only restrain you. Act prudently.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, do not fear; besides, you will accompany me. Beauchamp, solemn\r\ntransactions should be sanctioned by a witness. Before this day closes,\r\nif M. Danglars is guilty, he shall cease to live, or I shall die.\r\n_Pardieu_, Beauchamp, mine shall be a splendid funeral!”\r\n\r\n“When such resolutions are made, Albert, they should be promptly\r\nexecuted. Do you wish to go to M. Danglars? Let us go immediately.”\r\n\r\nThey sent for a cabriolet. On entering the banker’s mansion, they\r\nperceived the phaeton and servant of M. Andrea Cavalcanti.\r\n\r\n“Ah! _parbleu!_ that’s good,” said Albert, with a gloomy tone. “If M.\r\nDanglars will not fight with me, I will kill his son-in-law; Cavalcanti\r\nwill certainly fight.”\r\n\r\nThe servant announced the young man; but the banker, recollecting what\r\nhad transpired the day before, did not wish him admitted. It was,\r\nhowever, too late; Albert had followed the footman, and, hearing the\r\norder given, forced the door open, and followed by Beauchamp found\r\nhimself in the banker’s study.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” cried the latter, “am I no longer at liberty to receive whom I\r\nchoose in my house? You appear to forget yourself sadly.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” said Albert, coldly; “there are circumstances in which one\r\ncannot, except through cowardice,—I offer you that refuge,—refuse to\r\nadmit certain persons at least.”\r\n\r\n“What is your errand, then, with me, sir?”\r\n\r\n“I mean,” said Albert, drawing near, and without apparently noticing\r\nCavalcanti, who stood with his back towards the fireplace—“I mean to\r\npropose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us\r\nfor ten minutes; that will be sufficient—where two men having met, one\r\nof them will remain on the ground.”\r\n\r\nDanglars turned pale; Cavalcanti moved a step forward, and Albert\r\nturned towards him.\r\n\r\n“And you, too,” said he, “come, if you like, monsieur; you have a\r\nclaim, being almost one of the family, and I will give as many\r\nrendezvous of that kind as I can find persons willing to accept them.”\r\n\r\nCavalcanti looked at Danglars with a stupefied air, and the latter,\r\nmaking an effort, arose and stepped between the two young men. Albert’s\r\nattack on Andrea had placed him on a different footing, and he hoped\r\nthis visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir,” said he to Albert, “if you are come to quarrel with this\r\ngentleman because I have preferred him to you, I shall resign the case\r\nto the king’s attorney.”\r\n\r\n“You mistake, sir,” said Morcerf with a gloomy smile; “I am not\r\nreferring in the least to matrimony, and I only addressed myself to M.\r\nCavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us. In one\r\nrespect you are right, for I am ready to quarrel with everyone today;\r\nbut you have the first claim, M. Danglars.”\r\n\r\n40212m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied Danglars, pale with anger and fear, “I warn you, when I\r\nhave the misfortune to meet with a mad dog, I kill it; and far from\r\nthinking myself guilty of a crime, I believe I do society a kindness.\r\nNow, if you are mad and try to bite me, I will kill you without pity.\r\nIs it my fault that your father has dishonored himself?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, miserable wretch!” cried Morcerf, “it is your fault.”\r\n\r\nDanglars retreated a few steps. “My fault?” said he; “you must be mad!\r\nWhat do I know of the Grecian affair? Have I travelled in that country?\r\nDid I advise your father to sell the castle of Yanina—to betray——”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” said Albert, with a thundering voice. “No; it is not you who\r\nhave directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us, but you\r\nhypocritically provoked it.”\r\n\r\n“I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; you! How came it known?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you read it in the paper in the account from Yanina?”\r\n\r\n“Who wrote to Yanina?”\r\n\r\n“To Yanina?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Who wrote for particulars concerning my father?”\r\n\r\n“I imagine anyone may write to Yanina.”\r\n\r\n“But one person only wrote!”\r\n\r\n“One only?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and that was you!”\r\n\r\n“I, doubtless, wrote. It appears to me that when about to marry your\r\ndaughter to a young man, it is right to make some inquiries respecting\r\nhis family; it is not only a right, but a duty.”\r\n\r\n“You wrote, sir, knowing what answer you would receive.”\r\n\r\n“I, indeed? I assure you,” cried Danglars, with a confidence and\r\nsecurity proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really\r\nfelt for the young man, “I solemnly declare to you, that I should never\r\nhave thought of writing to Yanina, did I know anything of Ali Pasha’s\r\nmisfortunes.”\r\n\r\n“Who, then, urged you to write? Tell me.”\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_ it was the most simple thing in the world. I was speaking\r\nof your father’s past history. I said the origin of his fortune\r\nremained obscure. The person to whom I addressed my scruples asked me\r\nwhere your father had acquired his property? I answered, ‘In\r\nGreece.’—‘Then,’ said he, ‘write to Yanina.’”\r\n\r\n“And who thus advised you?”\r\n\r\n“No other than your friend, Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\n“The Count of Monte Cristo told you to write to Yanina?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and I wrote, and will show you my correspondence, if you like.”\r\n\r\nAlbert and Beauchamp looked at each other.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Beauchamp, who had not yet spoken, “you appear to accuse\r\nthe count, who is absent from Paris at this moment, and cannot justify\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\n“I accuse no one, sir,” said Danglars; “I relate, and I will repeat\r\nbefore the count what I have said to you.”\r\n\r\n“Does the count know what answer you received?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I showed it to him.”\r\n\r\n“Did he know my father’s Christian name was Fernand, and his family\r\nname Mondego?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I had told him that long since, and I did only what any other\r\nwould have done in my circumstances, and perhaps less. When, the day\r\nafter the arrival of this answer, your father came by the advice of\r\nMonte Cristo to ask my daughter’s hand for you, I decidedly refused\r\nhim, but without any explanation or exposure. In short, why should I\r\nhave any more to do with the affair? How did the honor or disgrace of\r\nM. de Morcerf affect me? It neither increased nor decreased my income.”\r\n\r\nAlbert felt the blood mounting to his brow; there was no doubt upon the\r\nsubject. Danglars defended himself with the baseness, but at the same\r\ntime with the assurance, of a man who speaks the truth, at least in\r\npart, if not wholly—not for conscience’ sake, but through fear.\r\nBesides, what was Morcerf seeking? It was not whether Danglars or Monte\r\nCristo was more or less guilty; it was a man who would answer for the\r\noffence, whether trifling or serious; it was a man who would fight, and\r\nit was evident Danglars would not fight.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, everything forgotten or unperceived before\r\npresented itself now to his recollection. Monte Cristo knew everything,\r\nas he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha; and, knowing everything, he\r\nhad advised Danglars to write to Yanina. The answer known, he had\r\nyielded to Albert’s wish to be introduced to Haydée, and allowed the\r\nconversation to turn on the death of Ali, and had not opposed Haydée’s\r\nrecital (but having, doubtless, warned the young girl, in the few\r\nRomaic words he spoke to her, not to implicate Morcerf’s father).\r\nBesides, had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his father’s name\r\nbefore Haydée? Lastly, he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the\r\nfinal blow was near. There could be no doubt that all had been\r\ncalculated and previously arranged; Monte Cristo then was in league\r\nwith his father’s enemies. Albert took Beauchamp aside, and\r\ncommunicated these ideas to him.\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said the latter; “M. Danglars has only been a\r\nsecondary agent in this sad affair, and it is of M. de Monte Cristo\r\nthat you must demand an explanation.”\r\n\r\nAlbert turned.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he to Danglars, “understand that I do not take a final\r\nleave of you; I must ascertain if your insinuations are just, and am\r\ngoing now to inquire of the Count of Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\nHe bowed to the banker, and went out with Beauchamp, without appearing\r\nto notice Cavalcanti. Danglars accompanied him to the door, where he\r\nagain assured Albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced\r\nhim against the Count of Morcerf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 88. The Insult\r\n\r\nAt the banker’s door Beauchamp stopped Morcerf.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said he; “just now I told you it was of M. de Monte Cristo\r\nyou must demand an explanation.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and we are going to his house.”\r\n\r\n“Reflect, Morcerf, one moment before you go.”\r\n\r\n“On what shall I reflect?”\r\n\r\n“On the importance of the step you are taking.”\r\n\r\n“Is it more serious than going to M. Danglars?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; M. Danglars is a money-lover, and those who love money, you know,\r\nthink too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel.\r\nThe other is, on the contrary, to all appearance a true nobleman; but\r\ndo you not fear to find him a bully?”\r\n\r\n“I only fear one thing; namely, to find a man who will not fight.”\r\n\r\n“Do not be alarmed,” said Beauchamp; “he will meet you. My only fear is\r\nthat he will be too strong for you.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Morcerf, with a sweet smile, “that is what I wish.\r\nThe happiest thing that could occur to me, would be to die in my\r\nfather’s stead; that would save us all.”\r\n\r\n“Your mother would die of grief.”\r\n\r\n“My poor mother!” said Albert, passing his hand across his eyes, “I\r\nknow she would; but better so than die of shame.”\r\n\r\n“Are you quite decided, Albert?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; let us go.”\r\n\r\n“But do you think we shall find the count at home?”\r\n\r\n“He intended returning some hours after me, and doubtless he is now at\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\nThey ordered the driver to take them to No. 30 Champs-Élysées.\r\nBeauchamp wished to go in alone, but Albert observed that as this was\r\nan unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual\r\netiquette of duels. The cause which the young man espoused was one so\r\nsacred that Beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes; he\r\nyielded and contented himself with following Morcerf. Albert sprang\r\nfrom the porter’s lodge to the steps. He was received by Baptistin. The\r\ncount had, indeed, just arrived, but he was in his bath, and had\r\nforbidden that anyone should be admitted.\r\n\r\n“But after his bath?” asked Morcerf.\r\n\r\n“My master will go to dinner.”\r\n\r\n“And after dinner?”\r\n\r\n“He will sleep an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Then?”\r\n\r\n“He is going to the Opera.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure of it?” asked Albert.\r\n\r\n“Quite, sir; my master has ordered his horses at eight o’clock\r\nprecisely.”\r\n\r\n“Very good,” replied Albert; “that is all I wished to know.”\r\n\r\nThen, turning towards Beauchamp, “If you have anything to attend to,\r\nBeauchamp, do it directly; if you have any appointment for this\r\nevening, defer it till tomorrow. I depend on you to accompany me to the\r\nOpera; and if you can, bring Château-Renaud with you.”\r\n\r\nBeauchamp availed himself of Albert’s permission, and left him,\r\npromising to call for him at a quarter before eight. On his return\r\nhome, Albert expressed his wish to Franz Debray, and Morrel, to see\r\nthem at the Opera that evening. Then he went to see his mother, who\r\nsince the events of the day before had refused to see anyone, and had\r\nkept her room. He found her in bed, overwhelmed with grief at this\r\npublic humiliation.\r\n\r\nThe sight of Albert produced the effect which might naturally be\r\nexpected on Mercédès; she pressed her son’s hand and sobbed aloud, but\r\nher tears relieved her. Albert stood one moment speechless by the side\r\nof his mother’s bed. It was evident from his pale face and knit brows\r\nthat his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker.\r\n\r\n“My dear mother,” said he, “do you know if M. de Morcerf has any\r\nenemy?”\r\n\r\nMercédès started; she noticed that the young man did not say “my\r\nfather.”\r\n\r\n“My son,” she said, “persons in the count’s situation have many secret\r\nenemies. Those who are known are not the most dangerous.”\r\n\r\n“I know it, and appeal to your penetration. You are of so superior a\r\nmind, nothing escapes you.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you say so?”\r\n\r\n“Because, for instance, you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave,\r\nthat M. de Monte Cristo would eat nothing in our house.”\r\n\r\nMercédès raised herself on her feverish arm.\r\n\r\n“M. de Monte Cristo!” she exclaimed; “and how is he connected with the\r\nquestion you asked me?”\r\n\r\n40219m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You know, mother, M. de Monte Cristo is almost an Oriental, and it is\r\ncustomary with the Orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not\r\neating or drinking in the houses of their enemies.”\r\n\r\n“Do you say M. de Monte Cristo is our enemy?” replied Mercédès,\r\nbecoming paler than the sheet which covered her. “Who told you so? Why,\r\nyou are mad, Albert! M. de Monte Cristo has only shown us kindness. M.\r\nde Monte Cristo saved your life; you yourself presented him to us. Oh,\r\nI entreat you, my son, if you had entertained such an idea, dispel it;\r\nand my counsel to you—nay, my prayer—is to retain his friendship.”\r\n\r\n“Mother,” replied the young man, “you have special reasons for telling\r\nme to conciliate that man.”\r\n\r\n“I?” said Mercédès, blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale, and\r\nagain becoming paler than ever.\r\n\r\n“Yes, doubtless; and is it not that he may never do us any harm?”\r\n\r\nMercédès shuddered, and, fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze, “You\r\nspeak strangely,” said she to Albert, “and you appear to have some\r\nsingular prejudices. What has the count done? Three days since you were\r\nwith him in Normandy; only three days since we looked on him as our\r\nbest friend.”\r\n\r\nAn ironical smile passed over Albert’s lips. Mercédès saw it and with\r\nthe double instinct of woman and mother guessed all; but as she was\r\nprudent and strong-minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears.\r\nAlbert was silent; an instant after, the countess resumed:\r\n\r\n“You came to inquire after my health; I will candidly acknowledge that\r\nI am not well. You should install yourself here, and cheer my solitude.\r\nI do not wish to be left alone.”\r\n\r\n“Mother,” said the young man, “you know how gladly I would obey your\r\nwish, but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for\r\nthe whole evening.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Mercédès, sighing, “go, Albert; I will not make you a\r\nslave to your filial piety.”\r\n\r\nAlbert pretended he did not hear, bowed to his mother, and quitted her.\r\nScarcely had he shut her door, when Mercédès called a confidential\r\nservant, and ordered him to follow Albert wherever he should go that\r\nevening, and to come and tell her immediately what he observed. Then\r\nshe rang for her lady’s maid, and, weak as she was, she dressed, in\r\norder to be ready for whatever might happen. The footman’s mission was\r\nan easy one. Albert went to his room, and dressed with unusual care. At\r\nten minutes to eight Beauchamp arrived; he had seen Château-Renaud, who\r\nhad promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised. Both\r\ngot into Albert’s _coupé_; and, as the young man had no reason to\r\nconceal where he was going, he called aloud, “To the Opera.” In his\r\nimpatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance.\r\n\r\n40221m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChâteau-Renaud was at his post; apprised by Beauchamp of the\r\ncircumstances, he required no explanation from Albert. The conduct of\r\nthe son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that\r\nChâteau-Renaud did not seek to dissuade him, and was content with\r\nrenewing his assurances of devotion. Debray was not yet come, but\r\nAlbert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the Opera.\r\n\r\nAlbert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up. He\r\nhoped to meet with M. de Monte Cristo either in the lobby or on the\r\nstairs. The bell summoned him to his seat, and he entered the orchestra\r\nwith Château-Renaud and Beauchamp. But his eyes scarcely quitted the\r\nbox between the columns, which remained obstinately closed during the\r\nwhole of the first act. At last, as Albert was looking at his watch for\r\nabout the hundredth time, at the beginning of the second act the door\r\nopened, and Monte Cristo entered, dressed in black, and, leaning over\r\nthe front of the box, looked around the pit. Morrel followed him, and\r\nlooked also for his sister and brother in-law; he soon discovered them\r\nin another box, and kissed his hand to them.\r\n\r\nThe count, in his survey of the pit, encountered a pale face and\r\nthreatening eyes, which evidently sought to gain his attention. He\r\nrecognized Albert, but thought it better not to notice him, as he\r\nlooked so angry and discomposed. Without communicating his thoughts to\r\nhis companion, he sat down, drew out his opera-glass, and looked\r\nanother way. Although apparently not noticing Albert, he did not,\r\nhowever, lose sight of him, and when the curtain fell at the end of the\r\nsecond act, he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends. Then\r\nhis head was seen passing at the back of the boxes, and the count knew\r\nthat the approaching storm was intended to fall on him. He was at the\r\nmoment conversing cheerfully with Morrel, but he was well prepared for\r\nwhat might happen.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Monte Cristo, turning round, saw Albert, pale and\r\ntrembling, followed by Beauchamp and Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“Well,” cried he, with that benevolent politeness which distinguished\r\nhis salutation from the common civilities of the world, “my cavalier\r\nhas attained his object. Good-evening, M. de Morcerf.”\r\n\r\nThe countenance of this man, who possessed such extraordinary control\r\nover his feelings, expressed the most perfect cordiality. Morrel only\r\nthen recollected the letter he had received from the viscount, in\r\nwhich, without assigning any reason, he begged him to go to the Opera,\r\nbut he understood that something terrible was brooding.\r\n\r\n“We are not come here, sir, to exchange hypocritical expressions of\r\npoliteness, or false professions of friendship,” said Albert, “but to\r\ndemand an explanation.”\r\n\r\nThe young man’s trembling voice was scarcely audible.\r\n\r\n“An explanation at the Opera?” said the count, with that calm tone and\r\npenetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good.\r\n“Little acquainted as I am with the habits of Parisians, I should not\r\nhave thought this the place for such a demand.”\r\n\r\n“Still, if people will shut themselves up,” said Albert, “and cannot be\r\nseen because they are bathing, dining, or asleep, we must avail\r\nourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen.”\r\n\r\n“I am not difficult of access, sir; for yesterday, if my memory does\r\nnot deceive me, you were at my house.”\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I was at your house, sir,” said the young man; “because then\r\nI knew not who you were.”\r\n\r\nIn pronouncing these words Albert had raised his voice so as to be\r\nheard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby. Thus the\r\nattention of many was attracted by this altercation.\r\n\r\n“Where are you come from, sir? “ said Monte Cristo “You do not appear\r\nto be in the possession of your senses.”\r\n\r\n“Provided I understand your perfidy, sir, and succeed in making you\r\nunderstand that I will be revenged, I shall be reasonable enough,” said\r\nAlbert furiously.\r\n\r\n“I do not understand you, sir,” replied Monte Cristo; “and if I did,\r\nyour tone is too high. I am at home here, and I alone have a right to\r\nraise my voice above another’s. Leave the box, sir!”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo pointed towards the door with the most commanding dignity.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I shall know how to make you leave your home!” replied Albert,\r\nclasping in his convulsed grasp the glove, which Monte Cristo did not\r\nlose sight of.\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said Monte Cristo quietly, “I see you wish to quarrel\r\nwith me; but I would give you one piece of advice, which you will do\r\nwell to keep in mind. It is in poor taste to make a display of a\r\nchallenge. Display is not becoming to everyone, M. de Morcerf.”\r\n\r\nAt this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of\r\nspectators of this scene. They had talked of no one but Morcerf the\r\nwhole day. Albert understood the allusion in a moment, and was about to\r\nthrow his glove at the count, when Morrel seized his hand, while\r\nBeauchamp and Château-Renaud, fearing the scene would surpass the\r\nlimits of a challenge, held him back. But Monte Cristo, without rising,\r\nand leaning forward in his chair, merely stretched out his arm and,\r\ntaking the damp, crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man:\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he in a solemn tone, “I consider your glove thrown, and\r\nwill return it to you wrapped around a bullet. Now leave me or I will\r\nsummon my servants to throw you out at the door.”\r\n\r\nWild, almost unconscious, and with eyes inflamed, Albert stepped back,\r\nand Morrel closed the door. Monte Cristo took up his glass again as if\r\nnothing had happened; his face was like marble, and his heart was like\r\nbronze. Morrel whispered, “What have you done to him?”\r\n\r\n“I? Nothing—at least personally,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“But there must be some cause for this strange scene.”\r\n\r\n“The Count of Morcerf’s adventure exasperates the young man.”\r\n\r\n“Have you anything to do with it?”\r\n\r\n“It was through Haydée that the Chamber was informed of his father’s\r\ntreason.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Morrel. “I had been told, but would not credit it, that\r\nthe Grecian slave I have seen with you here in this very box was the\r\ndaughter of Ali Pasha.”\r\n\r\n“It is true, nevertheless.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Morrel, “I understand it all, and this scene was\r\npremeditated.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Albert wrote to request me to come to the Opera, doubtless that I\r\nmight be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you.”\r\n\r\n“Probably,” said Monte Cristo with his imperturbable tranquillity.\r\n\r\n“But what shall you do with him?”\r\n\r\n“With whom?”\r\n\r\n“With Albert.”\r\n\r\n“What shall I do with Albert? As certainly, Maximilian, as I now press\r\nyour hand, I shall kill him before ten o’clock tomorrow morning.”\r\nMorrel, in his turn, took Monte Cristo’s hand in both of his, and he\r\nshuddered to feel how cold and steady it was.\r\n\r\n“Ah, count,” said he, “his father loves him so much!”\r\n\r\n“Do not speak to me of that,” said Monte Cristo, with the first\r\nmovement of anger he had betrayed; “I will make him suffer.”\r\n\r\nMorrel, amazed, let fall Monte Cristo’s hand. “Count, count!” said he.\r\n\r\n“Dear Maximilian,” interrupted the count, “listen how adorably Duprez\r\nis singing that line,—\r\n\r\n‘O Mathilde! idole de mon âme!’\r\n\r\n\r\n“I was the first to discover Duprez at Naples, and the first to applaud\r\nhim. Bravo, bravo!”\r\n\r\nMorrel saw it was useless to say more, and refrained. The curtain,\r\nwhich had risen at the close of the scene with Albert, again fell, and\r\na rap was heard at the door.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” said Monte Cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least\r\nemotion; and immediately Beauchamp appeared. “Good-evening, M.\r\nBeauchamp,” said Monte Cristo, as if this was the first time he had\r\nseen the journalist that evening; “be seated.”\r\n\r\nBeauchamp bowed, and, sitting down, “Sir,” said he, “I just now\r\naccompanied M. de Morcerf, as you saw.”\r\n\r\n“And that means,” replied Monte Cristo, laughing, “that you had,\r\nprobably, just dined together. I am happy to see, M. Beauchamp, that\r\nyou are more sober than he was.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said M. Beauchamp, “Albert was wrong, I acknowledge, to betray\r\nso much anger, and I come, on my own account, to apologize for him. And\r\nhaving done so, entirely on my own account, be it understood, I would\r\nadd that I believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some\r\nexplanation concerning your connection with Yanina. Then I will add two\r\nwords about the young Greek girl.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo motioned him to be silent. “Come,” said he, laughing,\r\n“there are all my hopes about to be destroyed.”\r\n\r\n“How so?” asked Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character. I am,\r\nin your opinion, a Lara, a Manfred, a Lord Ruthven; then, just as I am\r\narriving at the climax, you defeat your own end, and seek to make an\r\nordinary man of me. You bring me down to your own level, and demand\r\nexplanations! Indeed, M. Beauchamp, it is quite laughable.”\r\n\r\n“Yet,” replied Beauchamp haughtily, “there are occasions when probity\r\ncommands——”\r\n\r\n“M. Beauchamp,” interposed this strange man, “the Count of Monte Cristo\r\nbows to none but the Count of Monte Cristo himself. Say no more, I\r\nentreat you. I do what I please, M. Beauchamp, and it is always well\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied the young man, “honest men are not to be paid with such\r\ncoin. I require honorable guaranties.”\r\n\r\n“I am, sir, a living guaranty,” replied Monte Cristo, motionless, but\r\nwith a threatening look; “we have both blood in our veins which we wish\r\nto shed—that is our mutual guaranty. Tell the viscount so, and that\r\ntomorrow, before ten o’clock, I shall see what color his is.”\r\n\r\n“Then I have only to make arrangements for the duel,” said Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“It is quite immaterial to me,” said Monte Cristo, “and it was very\r\nunnecessary to disturb me at the Opera for such a trifle. In France\r\npeople fight with the sword or pistol, in the colonies with the\r\ncarbine, in Arabia with the dagger. Tell your client that, although I\r\nam the insulted party, in order to carry out my eccentricity, I leave\r\nhim the choice of arms, and will accept without discussion, without\r\ndispute, anything, even combat by drawing lots, which is always stupid,\r\nbut with me different from other people, as I am sure to gain.”\r\n\r\n“Sure to gain!” repeated Beauchamp, looking with amazement at the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Monte Cristo, slightly shrugging his shoulders;\r\n“otherwise I would not fight with M. de Morcerf. I shall kill him—I\r\ncannot help it. Only by a single line this evening at my house let me\r\nknow the arms and the hour; I do not like to be kept waiting.”\r\n\r\n“Pistols, then, at eight o’clock, in the Bois de Vincennes,” said\r\nBeauchamp, quite disconcerted, not knowing if he was dealing with an\r\narrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being.\r\n\r\n“Very well, sir,” said Monte Cristo. “Now all that is settled, do let\r\nme see the performance, and tell your friend Albert not to come any\r\nmore this evening; he will hurt himself with all his ill-chosen\r\nbarbarisms: let him go home and go to sleep.”\r\n\r\nBeauchamp left the box, perfectly amazed.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Monte Cristo, turning towards Morrel, “I may depend upon\r\nyou, may I not?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Morrel, “I am at your service, count; still——”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“It is desirable I should know the real cause.”\r\n\r\n“That is to say, you would rather not?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“The young man himself is acting blindfolded, and knows not the true\r\ncause, which is known only to God and to me; but I give you my word,\r\nMorrel, that God, who does know it, will be on our side.”\r\n\r\n“Enough,” said Morrel; “who is your second witness?”\r\n\r\n“I know no one in Paris, Morrel, on whom I could confer that honor\r\nbesides you and your brother Emmanuel. Do you think Emmanuel would\r\noblige me?”\r\n\r\n“I will answer for him, count.”\r\n\r\n“Well? that is all I require. Tomorrow morning, at seven o’clock, you\r\nwill be with me, will you not?”\r\n\r\n“We will.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, the curtain is rising. Listen! I never lose a note of this opera\r\nif I can avoid it; the music of _William Tell_ is so sweet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 89. The Night\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo waited, according to his usual custom, until Duprez had\r\nsung his famous “_Suivez-moi!_” then he rose and went out. Morrel took\r\nleave of him at the door, renewing his promise to be with him the next\r\nmorning at seven o’clock, and to bring Emmanuel. Then he stepped into\r\nhis _coupé_, calm and smiling, and was at home in five minutes. No one\r\nwho knew the count could mistake his expression when, on entering, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Ali, bring me my pistols with the ivory cross.”\r\n\r\nAli brought the box to his master, who examined the weapons with a\r\nsolicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a\r\nlittle powder and shot. These were pistols of an especial pattern,\r\nwhich Monte Cristo had had made for target practice in his own room. A\r\ncap was sufficient to drive out the bullet, and from the adjoining room\r\nno one would have suspected that the count was, as sportsmen would say,\r\nkeeping his hand in.\r\n\r\nHe was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a\r\nlittle iron plate which served him as a target, when his study door\r\nopened, and Baptistin entered. Before he had spoken a word, the count\r\nsaw in the next room a veiled woman, who had followed closely after\r\nBaptistin, and now, seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and\r\nswords on the table, rushed in. Baptistin looked at his master, who\r\nmade a sign to him, and he went out, closing the door after him.\r\n\r\n“Who are you, madame?” said the count to the veiled woman.\r\n\r\n40227m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stranger cast one look around her, to be certain that they were\r\nquite alone; then bending as if she would have knelt, and joining her\r\nhands, she said with an accent of despair:\r\n\r\n“Edmond, you will not kill my son!”\r\n\r\nThe count retreated a step, uttered a slight exclamation, and let fall\r\nthe pistol he held.\r\n\r\n“What name did you pronounce then, Madame de Morcerf?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Yours!” cried she, throwing back her veil,—“yours, which I alone,\r\nperhaps, have not forgotten. Edmond, it is not Madame de Morcerf who is\r\ncome to you, it is Mercédès.”\r\n\r\n“Mercédès is dead, madame,” said Monte Cristo; “I know no one now of\r\nthat name.”\r\n\r\n“Mercédès lives, sir, and she remembers, for she alone recognized you\r\nwhen she saw you, and even before she saw you, by your voice,\r\nEdmond,—by the simple sound of your voice; and from that moment she has\r\nfollowed your steps, watched you, feared you, and she needs not to\r\ninquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes M. de Morcerf.”\r\n\r\n“Fernand, do you mean?” replied Monte Cristo, with bitter irony; “since\r\nwe are recalling names, let us remember them all.” Monte Cristo had\r\npronounced the name of Fernand with such an expression of hatred that\r\nMercédès felt a thrill of horror run through every vein.\r\n\r\n“You see, Edmond, I am not mistaken, and have cause to say, ‘Spare my\r\nson!’”\r\n\r\n“And who told you, madame, that I have any hostile intentions against\r\nyour son?”\r\n\r\n“No one, in truth; but a mother has twofold sight. I guessed all; I\r\nfollowed him this evening to the Opera, and, concealed in a parquet\r\nbox, have seen all.”\r\n\r\n“If you have seen all, madame, you know that the son of Fernand has\r\npublicly insulted me,” said Monte Cristo with awful calmness.\r\n\r\n“Oh, for pity’s sake!”\r\n\r\n“You have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if\r\nMorrel, one of my friends, had not stopped him.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, my son has also guessed who you are,—he attributes his\r\nfather’s misfortunes to you.”\r\n\r\n“Madame, you are mistaken, they are not misfortunes,—it is a\r\npunishment. It is not I who strike M. de Morcerf; it is Providence\r\nwhich punishes him.”\r\n\r\n“And why do you represent Providence?” cried Mercédès. “Why do you\r\nremember when it forgets? What are Yanina and its vizier to you,\r\nEdmond? What injury has Fernand Mondego done you in betraying Ali\r\nTepelini?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, madame,” replied Monte Cristo, “all this is an affair between the\r\nFrench captain and the daughter of Vasiliki. It does not concern me,\r\nyou are right; and if I have sworn to revenge myself, it is not on the\r\nFrench captain, or the Count of Morcerf, but on the fisherman Fernand,\r\nthe husband of Mercédès the Catalane.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir!” cried the countess, “how terrible a vengeance for a fault\r\nwhich fatality made me commit!—for I am the only culprit, Edmond, and\r\nif you owe revenge to anyone, it is to me, who had not fortitude to\r\nbear your absence and my solitude.”\r\n\r\n“But,” exclaimed Monte Cristo, “why was I absent? And why were you\r\nalone?”\r\n\r\n40231m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Because you had been arrested, Edmond, and were a prisoner.”\r\n\r\n“And why was I arrested? Why was I a prisoner?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” said Mercédès.\r\n\r\n“You do not, madame; at least, I hope not. But I will tell you. I was\r\narrested and became a prisoner because, under the arbor of La Réserve,\r\nthe day before I was to marry you, a man named Danglars wrote this\r\nletter, which the fisherman Fernand himself posted.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo went to a secretaire, opened a drawer by a spring, from\r\nwhich he took a paper which had lost its original color, and the ink of\r\nwhich had become of a rusty hue—this he placed in the hands of\r\nMercédès. It was Danglars’ letter to the king’s attorney, which the\r\nCount of Monte Cristo, disguised as a clerk from the house of Thomson &\r\nFrench, had taken from the file against Edmond Dantès, on the day he\r\nhad paid the two hundred thousand francs to M. de Boville. Mercédès\r\nread with terror the following lines:\r\n\r\n“The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion\r\nthat one Edmond Dantès, second in command on board the _Pharaon_, this\r\nday arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and\r\nPorto-Ferrajo, is the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and\r\nof another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris.\r\nAmple corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the\r\nabove-mentioned Edmond Dantès, who either carries the letter for Paris\r\nabout with him, or has it at his father’s abode. Should it not be found\r\nin possession of either father or son, then it will assuredly be\r\ndiscovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dantès on board the\r\n_Pharaon_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“How dreadful!” said Mercédès, passing her hand across her brow, moist\r\nwith perspiration; “and that letter——”\r\n\r\n“I bought it for two hundred thousand francs, madame,” said Monte\r\nCristo; “but that is a trifle, since it enables me to justify myself to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“And the result of that letter——”\r\n\r\n“You well know, madame, was my arrest; but you do not know how long\r\nthat arrest lasted. You do not know that I remained for fourteen years\r\nwithin a quarter of a league of you, in a dungeon in the Château d’If.\r\nYou do not know that every day of those fourteen years I renewed the\r\nvow of vengeance which I had made the first day; and yet I was not\r\naware that you had married Fernand, my calumniator, and that my father\r\nhad died of hunger!”\r\n\r\n“Can it be?” cried Mercédès, shuddering.\r\n\r\n“That is what I heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after I had\r\nentered it; and that is why, on account of the living Mercédès and my\r\ndeceased father, I have sworn to revenge myself on Fernand, and—I have\r\nrevenged myself.”\r\n\r\n“And you are sure the unhappy Fernand did that?”\r\n\r\n“I am satisfied, madame, that he did what I have told you; besides,\r\nthat is not much more odious than that a Frenchman by adoption should\r\npass over to the English; that a Spaniard by birth should have fought\r\nagainst the Spaniards; that a stipendiary of Ali should have betrayed\r\nand murdered Ali. Compared with such things, what is the letter you\r\nhave just read?—a lover’s deception, which the woman who has married\r\nthat man ought certainly to forgive; but not so the lover who was to\r\nhave married her. Well, the French did not avenge themselves on the\r\ntraitor, the Spaniards did not shoot the traitor, Ali in his tomb left\r\nthe traitor unpunished; but I, betrayed, sacrificed, buried, have risen\r\nfrom my tomb, by the grace of God, to punish that man. He sends me for\r\nthat purpose, and here I am.”\r\n\r\nThe poor woman’s head and arms fell; her legs bent under her, and she\r\nfell on her knees.\r\n\r\n“Forgive, Edmond, forgive for my sake, who love you still!”\r\n\r\nThe dignity of the wife checked the fervor of the lover and the mother.\r\nHer forehead almost touched the carpet, when the count sprang forward\r\nand raised her. Then seated on a chair, she looked at the manly\r\ncountenance of Monte Cristo, on which grief and hatred still impressed\r\na threatening expression.\r\n\r\n“Not crush that accursed race?” murmured he; “abandon my purpose at the\r\nmoment of its accomplishment? Impossible, madame, impossible!”\r\n\r\n“Edmond,” said the poor mother, who tried every means, “when I call you\r\nEdmond, why do you not call me Mercédès?”\r\n\r\n“Mercédès!” repeated Monte Cristo; “Mercédès! Well yes, you are right;\r\nthat name has still its charms, and this is the first time for a long\r\nperiod that I have pronounced it so distinctly. Oh, Mercédès, I have\r\nuttered your name with the sigh of melancholy, with the groan of\r\nsorrow, with the last effort of despair; I have uttered it when frozen\r\nwith cold, crouched on the straw in my dungeon; I have uttered it,\r\nconsumed with heat, rolling on the stone floor of my prison. Mercédès,\r\nI must revenge myself, for I suffered fourteen years,—fourteen years I\r\nwept, I cursed; now I tell you, Mercédès, I must revenge myself.”\r\n\r\nThe count, fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently\r\nloved, called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred.\r\n\r\n“Revenge yourself, then, Edmond,” cried the poor mother; “but let your\r\nvengeance fall on the culprits,—on him, on me, but not on my son!”\r\n\r\n“It is written in the good book,” said Monte Cristo, “that the sins of\r\nthe fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth\r\ngeneration. Since God himself dictated those words to his prophet, why\r\nshould I seek to make myself better than God?”\r\n\r\n“Edmond,” continued Mercédès, with her arms extended towards the count,\r\n“since I first knew you, I have adored your name, have respected your\r\nmemory. Edmond, my friend, do not compel me to tarnish that noble and\r\npure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart. Edmond, if\r\nyou knew all the prayers I have addressed to God for you while I\r\nthought you were living and since I have thought you must be dead! Yes,\r\ndead, alas! I imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy\r\ntower, or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers, and I wept!\r\nWhat could I do for you, Edmond, besides pray and weep? Listen; for ten\r\nyears I dreamed each night the same dream. I had been told that you had\r\nendeavored to escape; that you had taken the place of another prisoner;\r\nthat you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body; that you\r\nhad been thrown alive from the top of the Château d’If, and that the\r\ncry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your\r\njailers that they were your murderers. Well, Edmond, I swear to you, by\r\nthe head of that son for whom I entreat your pity,—Edmond, for ten\r\nyears I saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy, and for\r\nten years I heard every night the cry which awoke me, shuddering and\r\ncold. And I, too, Edmond—oh! believe me—guilty as I was—oh, yes, I,\r\ntoo, have suffered much!”\r\n\r\n“Have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your\r\nabsence?” cried Monte Cristo, thrusting his hands into his hair; “have\r\nyou seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival, while you\r\nwere perishing at the bottom of a dungeon?”\r\n\r\n“No,” interrupted Mercédès, “but I have seen him whom I loved on the\r\npoint of murdering my son.”\r\n\r\nMercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish, with an accent of\r\nsuch intense despair, that Monte Cristo could not restrain a sob. The\r\nlion was daunted; the avenger was conquered.\r\n\r\n“What do you ask of me?” said he,—“your son’s life? Well, he shall\r\nlive!”\r\n\r\nMercédès uttered a cry which made the tears start from Monte Cristo’s\r\neyes; but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously, for,\r\ndoubtless, God had sent some angel to collect them—far more precious\r\nwere they in his eyes than the richest pearls of Guzerat and Ophir.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said she, seizing the count’s hand and raising it to her lips;\r\n“oh, thank you, thank you, Edmond! Now you are exactly what I dreamt\r\nyou were,—the man I always loved. Oh, now I may say so!”\r\n\r\n“So much the better,” replied Monte Cristo; “as that poor Edmond will\r\nnot have long to be loved by you. Death is about to return to the tomb,\r\nthe phantom to retire in darkness.”\r\n\r\n“What do you say, Edmond?”\r\n\r\n“I say, since you command me, Mercédès, I must die.”\r\n\r\n“Die? and why so? Who talks of dying? Whence have you these ideas of\r\ndeath?”\r\n\r\n“You do not suppose that, publicly outraged in the face of a whole\r\ntheatre, in the presence of your friends and those of your\r\nson—challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were\r\na victory—you do not suppose that I can for one moment wish to live.\r\nWhat I most loved after you, Mercédès, was myself, my dignity, and that\r\nstrength which rendered me superior to other men; that strength was my\r\nlife. With one word you have crushed it, and I die.”\r\n\r\n“But the duel will not take place, Edmond, since you forgive?”\r\n\r\n“It will take place,” said Monte Cristo, in a most solemn tone; “but\r\ninstead of your son’s blood to stain the ground, mine will flow.”\r\n\r\nMercédès shrieked, and sprang towards Monte Cristo, but, suddenly\r\nstopping, “Edmond,” said she, “there is a God above us, since you live\r\nand since I have seen you again; I trust to him from my heart. While\r\nwaiting his assistance I trust to your word; you have said that my son\r\nshould live, have you not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame, he shall live,” said Monte Cristo, surprised that without\r\nmore emotion Mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for\r\nher. Mercédès extended her hand to the count.\r\n\r\n“Edmond,” said she, and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at\r\nhim to whom she spoke, “how noble it is of you, how great the action\r\nyou have just performed, how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman\r\nwho appealed to you with every chance against her, Alas, I am grown old\r\nwith grief more than with years, and cannot now remind my Edmond by a\r\nsmile, or by a look, of that Mercédès whom he once spent so many hours\r\nin contemplating. Ah, believe me, Edmond, as I told you, I too have\r\nsuffered much; I repeat, it is melancholy to pass one’s life without\r\nhaving one joy to recall, without preserving a single hope; but that\r\nproves that all is not yet over. No, it is not finished; I feel it by\r\nwhat remains in my heart. Oh, I repeat it, Edmond; what you have just\r\ndone is beautiful—it is grand; it is sublime.”\r\n\r\n“Do you say so now, Mercédès?—then what would you say if you knew the\r\nextent of the sacrifice I make to you? Suppose that the Supreme Being,\r\nafter having created the world and fertilized chaos, had paused in the\r\nwork to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal\r\nsins from her immortal eyes; suppose that when everything was in\r\nreadiness and the moment had come for God to look upon his work and see\r\nthat it was good—suppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the\r\nworld back into eternal night—then—even then, Mercédès, you could not\r\nimagine what I lose in sacrificing my life at this moment.”\r\n\r\nMercédès looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time\r\nher astonishment, her admiration, and her gratitude. Monte Cristo\r\npressed his forehead on his burning hands, as if his brain could no\r\nlonger bear alone the weight of its thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Edmond,” said Mercédès, “I have but one word more to say to you.”\r\n\r\nThe count smiled bitterly.\r\n\r\n“Edmond,” continued she, “you will see that if my face is pale, if my\r\neyes are dull, if my beauty is gone; if Mercédès, in short, no longer\r\nresembles her former self in her features, you will see that her heart\r\nis still the same. Adieu, then, Edmond; I have nothing more to ask of\r\nheaven—I have seen you again, and have found you as noble and as great\r\nas formerly you were. Adieu, Edmond, adieu, and thank you.”\r\n\r\nBut the count did not answer. Mercédès opened the door of the study and\r\nhad disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound\r\nreverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him.\r\n\r\nThe clock of the Invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed\r\nMadame de Morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the Champs-Élysées,\r\nand made Monte Cristo raise his head.\r\n\r\n“What a fool I was,” said he, “not to tear my heart out on the day when\r\nI resolved to avenge myself!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 90. The Meeting\r\n\r\nAfter Mercédès had left Monte Cristo, he fell into profound gloom.\r\nAround him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped;\r\nhis energetic mind slumbered, as the body does after extreme fatigue.\r\n\r\n“What?” said he to himself, while the lamp and the wax lights were\r\nnearly burnt out, and the servants were waiting impatiently in the\r\nanteroom; “what? this edifice which I have been so long preparing,\r\nwhich I have reared with so much care and toil, is to be crushed by a\r\nsingle touch, a word, a breath! Yes, this self, of whom I thought so\r\nmuch, of whom I was so proud, who had appeared so worthless in the\r\ndungeons of the Château d’If, and whom I had succeeded in making so\r\ngreat, will be but a lump of clay tomorrow. Alas, it is not the death\r\nof the body I regret; for is not the destruction of the vital\r\nprinciple, the repose to which everything is tending, to which every\r\nunhappy being aspires,—is not this the repose of matter after which I\r\nso long sighed, and which I was seeking to attain by the painful\r\nprocess of starvation when Faria appeared in my dungeon? What is death\r\nfor me? One step farther into rest,—two, perhaps, into silence. No, it\r\nis not existence, then, that I regret, but the ruin of projects so\r\nslowly carried out, so laboriously framed. Providence is now opposed to\r\nthem, when I most thought it would be propitious. It is not God’s will\r\nthat they should be accomplished. This burden, almost as heavy as a\r\nworld, which I had raised, and I had thought to bear to the end, was\r\ntoo great for my strength, and I was compelled to lay it down in the\r\nmiddle of my career. Oh, shall I then, again become a fatalist, whom\r\nfourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in\r\nProvidence?\r\n\r\n“And all this—all this, because my heart, which I thought dead, was\r\nonly sleeping; because it has awakened and has begun to beat again,\r\nbecause I have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast\r\nby a woman’s voice.\r\n\r\n“Yet,” continued the count, becoming each moment more absorbed in the\r\nanticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow, which Mercédès\r\nhad accepted, “yet, it is impossible that so noble-minded a woman\r\nshould thus through selfishness consent to my death when I am in the\r\nprime of life and strength; it is impossible that she can carry to such\r\na point maternal love, or rather delirium. There are virtues which\r\nbecome crimes by exaggeration. No, she must have conceived some\r\npathetic scene; she will come and throw herself between us; and what\r\nwould be sublime here will there appear ridiculous.”\r\n\r\nThe blush of pride mounted to the count’s forehead as this thought\r\npassed through his mind.\r\n\r\n“Ridiculous?” repeated he; “and the ridicule will fall on me. I\r\nridiculous? No, I would rather die.”\r\n\r\nBy thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill-fortune of the\r\nnext day, to which he had condemned himself by promising Mercédès to\r\nspare her son, the count at last exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Folly, folly, folly!—to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as\r\na mark for that young man to aim at. He will never believe that my\r\ndeath was suicide; and yet it is important for the honor of my\r\nmemory,—and this surely is not vanity, but a justifiable pride,—it is\r\nimportant the world should know that I have consented, by my free will,\r\nto stop my arm, already raised to strike, and that with the arm which\r\nhas been so powerful against others I have struck myself. It must be;\r\nit shall be.”\r\n\r\nSeizing a pen, he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk, and\r\nwrote at the bottom of the document (which was no other than his will,\r\nmade since his arrival in Paris) a sort of codicil, clearly explaining\r\nthe nature of his death.\r\n\r\n“I do this, Oh, my God,” said he, with his eyes raised to heaven, “as\r\nmuch for thy honor as for mine. I have during ten years considered\r\nmyself the agent of thy vengeance, and other wretches, like Morcerf,\r\nDanglars, Villefort, even Morcerf himself, must not imagine that chance\r\nhas freed them from their enemy. Let them know, on the contrary, that\r\ntheir punishment, which had been decreed by Providence, is only delayed\r\nby my present determination, and although they escape it in this world,\r\nit awaits them in another, and that they are only exchanging time for\r\neternity.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties,—wretched waking\r\ndreams of grief,—the first rays of morning pierced his windows, and\r\nshone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his\r\njustification of Providence.\r\n\r\nIt was just five o’clock in the morning when a slight noise like a\r\nstifled sigh reached his ear. He turned his head, looked around him,\r\nand saw no one; but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to\r\nconvince him of its reality.\r\n\r\nHe arose, and quietly opening the door of the drawing-room, saw Haydée,\r\nwho had fallen on a chair, with her arms hanging down and her beautiful\r\nhead thrown back. She had been standing at the door, to prevent his\r\ngoing out without seeing her, until sleep, which the young cannot\r\nresist, had overpowered her frame, wearied as she was with watching.\r\nThe noise of the door did not awaken her, and Monte Cristo gazed at her\r\nwith affectionate regret.\r\n\r\n“She remembered that she had a son,” said he; “and I forgot I had a\r\ndaughter.” Then, shaking his head sorrowfully, “Poor Haydée,” said he;\r\n“she wished to see me, to speak to me; she has feared or guessed\r\nsomething. Oh, I cannot go without taking leave of her; I cannot die\r\nwithout confiding her to someone.”\r\n\r\nHe quietly regained his seat, and wrote under the other lines:\r\n\r\n“I bequeath to Maximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis,—and son of my\r\nformer patron, Pierre Morrel, shipowner at Marseilles,—the sum of\r\ntwenty millions, a part of which may be offered to his sister Julie and\r\nbrother-in-law Emmanuel, if he does not fear this increase of fortune\r\nmay mar their happiness. These twenty millions are concealed in my\r\ngrotto at Monte Cristo, of which Bertuccio knows the secret. If his\r\nheart is free, and he will marry Haydée, the daughter of Ali Pasha of\r\nYanina, whom I have brought up with the love of a father, and who has\r\nshown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me, he will thus\r\naccomplish my last wish. This will has already constituted Haydée\r\nheiress of the rest of my fortune, consisting of lands, funds in\r\nEngland, Austria, and Holland, furniture in my different palaces and\r\nhouses, and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my\r\nservants, may still amount to sixty millions.”\r\n\r\n\r\n40241m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start,\r\nand the pen fell from his hand.\r\n\r\n“Haydée,” said he, “did you read it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my lord,” said she, “why are you writing thus at such an hour? Why\r\nare you bequeathing all your fortune to me? Are you going to leave me?”\r\n\r\n“I am going on a journey, dear child,” said Monte Cristo, with an\r\nexpression of infinite tenderness and melancholy; “and if any\r\nmisfortune should happen to me——”\r\n\r\nThe count stopped.\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked the young girl, with an authoritative tone the count had\r\nnever observed before, and which startled him.\r\n\r\n“Well, if any misfortune happen to me,” replied Monte Cristo, “I wish\r\nmy daughter to be happy.” Haydée smiled sorrowfully, and shook her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“Do you think of dying, my lord?” said she.\r\n\r\n“The wise man, my child, has said, ‘It is good to think of death.’”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you die,” said she, “bequeath your fortune to others, for if\r\nyou die I shall require nothing;” and, taking the paper, she tore it in\r\nfour pieces, and threw it into the middle of the room. Then, the effort\r\nhaving exhausted her strength, she fell, not asleep this time, but\r\nfainting on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe count leaned over her and raised her in his arms; and seeing that\r\nsweet pale face, those lovely eyes closed, that beautiful form\r\nmotionless and to all appearance lifeless, the idea occurred to him for\r\nthe first time, that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter\r\nloves a father.\r\n\r\n“Alas,” murmured he, with intense suffering, “I might, then, have been\r\nhappy yet.”\r\n\r\nThen he carried Haydée to her room, resigned her to the care of her\r\nattendants, and returning to his study, which he shut quickly this\r\ntime, he again copied the destroyed will. As he was finishing, the\r\nsound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard. Monte Cristo\r\napproached the window, and saw Maximilian and Emmanuel alight. “Good,”\r\nsaid he; “it was time,”—and he sealed his will with three seals.\r\n\r\nA moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing-room, and went to\r\nopen the door himself. Morrel was there; he had come twenty minutes\r\nbefore the time appointed.\r\n\r\n“I am perhaps come too soon, count,” said he, “but I frankly\r\nacknowledge that I have not closed my eyes all night, nor has anyone in\r\nmy house. I need to see you strong in your courageous assurance, to\r\nrecover myself.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo could not resist this proof of affection; he not only\r\nextended his hand to the young man, but flew to him with open arms.\r\n\r\n“Morrel,” said he, “it is a happy day for me, to feel that I am beloved\r\nby such a man as you. Good-morning, Emmanuel; you will come with me\r\nthen, Maximilian?”\r\n\r\n“Did you doubt it?” said the young captain.\r\n\r\n“But if I were wrong——”\r\n\r\n“I watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday; I\r\nhave been thinking of your firmness all night, and I said to myself\r\nthat justice must be on your side, or man’s countenance is no longer to\r\nbe relied on.”\r\n\r\n“But, Morrel, Albert is your friend?”\r\n\r\n“Simply an acquaintance, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You met on the same day you first saw me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is true; but I should not have recollected it if you had not\r\nreminded me.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Morrel.” Then ringing the bell once, “Look.” said he to\r\nAli, who came immediately, “take that to my solicitor. It is my will,\r\nMorrel. When I am dead, you will go and examine it.”\r\n\r\n“What?” said Morrel, “you dead?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; must I not be prepared for everything, dear friend? But what did\r\nyou do yesterday after you left me?”\r\n\r\n“I went to Tortoni’s, where, as I expected, I found Beauchamp and\r\nChâteau-Renaud. I own I was seeking them.”\r\n\r\n“Why, when all was arranged?”\r\n\r\n“Listen, count; the affair is serious and unavoidable.”\r\n\r\n“Did you doubt it!”\r\n\r\n“No; the offence was public, and everyone is already talking of it.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I hoped to get an exchange of arms,—to substitute the sword for\r\nthe pistol; the pistol is blind.”\r\n\r\n“Have you succeeded?” asked Monte Cristo quickly, with an imperceptible\r\ngleam of hope.\r\n\r\n“No; for your skill with the sword is so well known.”\r\n\r\n“Ah?—who has betrayed me?”\r\n\r\n“The skilful swordsman whom you have conquered.”\r\n\r\n“And you failed?”\r\n\r\n“They positively refused.”\r\n\r\n“Morrel,” said the count, “have you ever seen me fire a pistol?”\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we have time; look.” Monte Cristo took the pistols he held in\r\nhis hand when Mercédès entered, and fixing an ace of clubs against the\r\niron plate, with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of\r\nthe club. At each shot Morrel turned pale. He examined the bullets with\r\nwhich Monte Cristo performed this dexterous feat, and saw that they\r\nwere no larger than buckshot.\r\n\r\n“It is astonishing,” said he. “Look, Emmanuel.” Then turning towards\r\nMonte Cristo, “Count,” said he, “in the name of all that is dear to\r\nyou, I entreat you not to kill Albert!—the unhappy youth has a mother.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said Monte Cristo; “and I have none.” These words were\r\nuttered in a tone which made Morrel shudder.\r\n\r\n“You are the offended party, count.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless; what does that imply?”\r\n\r\n“That you will fire first.”\r\n\r\n“I fire first?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I obtained, or rather claimed that; we had conceded enough for\r\nthem to yield us that.”\r\n\r\n“And at what distance?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty paces.” A smile of terrible import passed over the count’s\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n“Morrel,” said he, “do not forget what you have just seen.”\r\n\r\n“The only chance for Albert’s safety, then, will arise from your\r\nemotion.”\r\n\r\n“I suffer from emotion?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Or from your generosity, my friend; to so good a marksman as you are,\r\nI may say what would appear absurd to another.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“Break his arm—wound him—but do not kill him.”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you, Morrel,” said the count, “that I do not need\r\nentreating to spare the life of M. de Morcerf; he shall be so well\r\nspared, that he will return quietly with his two friends, while I——”\r\n\r\n“And you?”\r\n\r\n“That will be another thing; I shall be brought home.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” cried Maximilian, quite unable to restrain his feelings.\r\n\r\n“As I told you, my dear Morrel, M. de Morcerf will kill me.”\r\n\r\nMorrel looked at him in utter amazement. “But what has happened, then,\r\nsince last evening, count?”\r\n\r\n“The same thing that happened to Brutus the night before the battle of\r\nPhilippi; I have seen a ghost.”\r\n\r\n“And that ghost——”\r\n\r\n“Told me, Morrel, that I had lived long enough.”\r\n\r\nMaximilian and Emmanuel looked at each other. Monte Cristo drew out his\r\nwatch. “Let us go,” said he; “it is five minutes past seven, and the\r\nappointment was for eight o’clock.”\r\n\r\nA carriage was in readiness at the door. Monte Cristo stepped into it\r\nwith his two friends. He had stopped a moment in the passage to listen\r\nat a door, and Maximilian and Emmanuel, who had considerately passed\r\nforward a few steps, thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob\r\nfrom within. As the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n“We are first,” said Morrel, looking out of the window.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, sir,” said Baptistin, who had followed his master with\r\nindescribable terror, “but I think I see a carriage down there under\r\nthe trees.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo sprang lightly from the carriage, and offered his hand to\r\nassist Emmanuel and Maximilian. The latter retained the count’s hand\r\nbetween his.\r\n\r\n“I like,” said he, “to feel a hand like this, when its owner relies on\r\nthe goodness of his cause.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Emmanuel, “that I see two young men down there,\r\nwho are evidently, waiting.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo drew Morrel a step or two behind his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n“Maximilian,” said he, “are your affections disengaged?” Morrel looked\r\nat Monte Cristo with astonishment. “I do not seek your confidence, my\r\ndear friend. I only ask you a simple question; answer it;—that is all I\r\nrequire.”\r\n\r\n“I love a young girl, count.”\r\n\r\n“Do you love her much?”\r\n\r\n“More than my life.”\r\n\r\n“Another hope defeated!” said the count. Then, with a sigh, “Poor\r\nHaydée!” murmured he.\r\n\r\n“To tell the truth, count, if I knew less of you, I should think that\r\nyou were less brave than you are.”\r\n\r\n“Because I sigh when thinking of someone I am leaving? Come, Morrel, it\r\nis not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage. Do I regret\r\nlife? What is it to me, who have passed twenty years between life and\r\ndeath? Moreover, do not alarm yourself, Morrel; this weakness, if it is\r\nsuch, is betrayed to you alone. I know the world is a drawing-room,\r\nfrom which we must retire politely and honestly; that is, with a bow,\r\nand our debts of honor paid.”\r\n\r\n“That is to the purpose. Have you brought your arms?”\r\n\r\n“I?—what for? I hope these gentlemen have theirs.”\r\n\r\n“I will inquire,” said Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Do; but make no treaty—you understand me?”\r\n\r\n“You need not fear.” Morrel advanced towards Beauchamp and\r\nChâteau-Renaud, who, seeing his intention, came to meet him. The three\r\nyoung men bowed to each other courteously, if not affably.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, gentlemen,” said Morrel, “but I do not see M. de Morcerf.”\r\n\r\n“He sent us word this morning,” replied Château-Renaud, “that he would\r\nmeet us on the ground.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Morrel. Beauchamp pulled out his watch.\r\n\r\n“It is only five minutes past eight,” said he to Morrel; “there is not\r\nmuch time lost yet.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I made no allusion of that kind,” replied Morrel.\r\n\r\n“There is a carriage coming,” said Château-Renaud. It advanced rapidly\r\nalong one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\n“You are doubtless provided with pistols, gentlemen? M. de Monte Cristo\r\nyields his right of using his.”\r\n\r\n“We had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count,” said\r\nBeauchamp, “and I have brought some weapons which I bought eight or ten\r\ndays since, thinking to want them on a similar occasion. They are quite\r\nnew, and have not yet been used. Will you examine them.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, M. Beauchamp, if you assure me that M. de Morcerf does not know\r\nthese pistols, you may readily believe that your word will be quite\r\nsufficient.”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Château-Renaud, “it is not Morcerf coming in that\r\ncarriage;—faith, it is Franz and Debray!”\r\n\r\nThe two young men he announced were indeed approaching. “What chance\r\nbrings you here, gentlemen?” said Château-Renaud, shaking hands with\r\neach of them.\r\n\r\n“Because,” said Debray, “Albert sent this morning to request us to\r\ncome.” Beauchamp and Château-Renaud exchanged looks of astonishment. “I\r\nthink I understand his reason,” said Morrel.\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Yesterday afternoon I received a letter from M. de Morcerf, begging me\r\nto attend the Opera.”\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Debray.\r\n\r\n“And I also,” said Franz.\r\n\r\n“And we, too,” added Beauchamp and Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“Having wished you all to witness the challenge, he now wishes you to\r\nbe present at the combat.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so,” said the young men; “you have probably guessed right.”\r\n\r\n“But, after all these arrangements, he does not come himself,” said\r\nChâteau-Renaud. “Albert is ten minutes after time.”\r\n\r\n“There he comes,” said Beauchamp, “on horseback, at full gallop,\r\nfollowed by a servant.”\r\n\r\n“How imprudent,” said Château-Renaud, “to come on horseback to fight a\r\nduel with pistols, after all the instructions I had given him.”\r\n\r\n“And besides,” said Beauchamp, “with a collar above his cravat, an open\r\ncoat and white waistcoat! Why has he not painted a spot upon his\r\nheart?—it would have been more simple.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by\r\nthe five young men. He jumped from his horse, threw the bridle on his\r\nservant’s arms, and joined them. He was pale, and his eyes were red and\r\nswollen; it was evident that he had not slept. A shade of melancholy\r\ngravity overspread his countenance, which was not natural to him.\r\n\r\n“I thank you, gentlemen,” said he, “for having complied with my\r\nrequest; I feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship.” Morrel\r\nhad stepped back as Morcerf approached, and remained at a short\r\ndistance. “And to you also, M. Morrel, my thanks are due. Come, there\r\ncannot be too many.”\r\n\r\n40248m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Maximilian, “you are not perhaps aware that I am M. de\r\nMonte Cristo’s friend?”\r\n\r\n“I was not sure, but I thought it might be so. So much the better; the\r\nmore honorable men there are here the better I shall be satisfied.”\r\n\r\n“M. Morrel,” said Château-Renaud, “will you apprise the Count of Monte\r\nCristo that M. de Morcerf is arrived, and we are at his disposal?”\r\n\r\nMorrel was preparing to fulfil his commission. Beauchamp had meanwhile\r\ndrawn the box of pistols from the carriage.\r\n\r\n“Stop, gentlemen,” said Albert; “I have two words to say to the Count\r\nof Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\n“In private?” asked Morrel.\r\n\r\n“No, sir; before all who are here.”\r\n\r\nAlbert’s witnesses looked at each other. Franz and Debray exchanged\r\nsome words in a whisper, and Morrel, rejoiced at this unexpected\r\nincident, went to fetch the count, who was walking in a retired path\r\nwith Emmanuel.\r\n\r\n“What does he want with me?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“I do not know, but he wishes to speak to you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah?” said Monte Cristo, “I trust he is not going to tempt me by some\r\nfresh insult!”\r\n\r\n“I do not think that such is his intention,” said Morrel.\r\n\r\nThe count advanced, accompanied by Maximilian and Emmanuel. His calm\r\nand serene look formed a singular contrast to Albert’s grief-stricken\r\nface, who approached also, followed by the other four young men.\r\n\r\nWhen at three paces distant from each other, Albert and the count\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n“Approach, gentlemen,” said Albert; “I wish you not to lose one word of\r\nwhat I am about to have the honor of saying to the Count of Monte\r\nCristo, for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it,\r\nstrange as it may appear to you.”\r\n\r\n“Proceed, sir,” said the count.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Albert, at first with a tremulous voice, but which\r\ngradually became firmer, “I reproached you with exposing the conduct of\r\nM. de Morcerf in Epirus, for guilty as I knew he was, I thought you had\r\nno right to punish him; but I have since learned that you had that\r\nright. It is not Fernand Mondego’s treachery towards Ali Pasha which\r\ninduces me so readily to excuse you, but the treachery of the fisherman\r\nFernand towards you, and the almost unheard-of miseries which were its\r\nconsequences; and I say, and proclaim it publicly, that you were\r\njustified in revenging yourself on my father, and I, his son, thank you\r\nfor not using greater severity.”\r\n\r\nHad a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this\r\nunexpected scene, it would not have surprised them more than did\r\nAlbert’s declaration. As for Monte Cristo, his eyes slowly rose towards\r\nheaven with an expression of infinite gratitude. He could not\r\nunderstand how Albert’s fiery nature, of which he had seen so much\r\namong the Roman bandits, had suddenly stooped to this humiliation. He\r\nrecognized the influence of Mercédès, and saw why her noble heart had\r\nnot opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless.\r\n\r\n“Now, sir,” said Albert, “if you think my apology sufficient, pray give\r\nme your hand. Next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to\r\npossess, I rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault. But this\r\nconfession concerns me only. I acted well as a man, but you have acted\r\nbetter than man. An angel alone could have saved one of us from\r\ndeath—that angel came from heaven, if not to make us friends (which,\r\nalas, fatality renders impossible), at least to make us esteem each\r\nother.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo, with moistened eye, heaving breast, and lips half open,\r\nextended to Albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment\r\nresembling respectful fear.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said he, “M. de Monte Cristo receives my apology. I had\r\nacted hastily towards him. Hasty actions are generally bad ones. Now my\r\nfault is repaired. I hope the world will not call me cowardly for\r\nacting as my conscience dictated. But if anyone should entertain a\r\nfalse opinion of me,” added he, drawing himself up as if he would\r\nchallenge both friends and enemies, “I shall endeavor to correct his\r\nmistake.”\r\n\r\n“What happened during the night?” asked Beauchamp of Château-Renaud;\r\n“we appear to make a very sorry figure here.”\r\n\r\n“In truth, what Albert has just done is either very despicable or very\r\nnoble,” replied the baron.\r\n\r\n“What can it mean?” said Debray to Franz.\r\n\r\n“The Count of Monte Cristo acts dishonorably to M. de Morcerf, and is\r\njustified by his son! Had I ten Yaninas in my family, I should only\r\nconsider myself the more bound to fight ten times.”\r\n\r\nAs for Monte Cristo, his head was bent down, his arms were powerless.\r\nBowing under the weight of twenty-four years’ reminiscences, he thought\r\nnot of Albert, of Beauchamp, of Château-Renaud, or of any of that\r\ngroup; but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead\r\nfor her son’s life, to whom he had offered his, and who had now saved\r\nit by the revelation of a dreadful family secret, capable of destroying\r\nforever in that young man’s heart every feeling of filial piety.\r\n\r\n“Providence still,” murmured he; “now only am I fully convinced of\r\nbeing the emissary of God!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 91. Mother and Son\r\n\r\nThe Count of Monte Cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy\r\nand dignified smile, and got into his carriage with Maximilian and\r\nEmmanuel. Albert, Beauchamp, and Château-Renaud remained alone. Albert\r\nlooked at his two friends, not timidly, but in a way that appeared to\r\nask their opinion of what he had just done.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, my dear friend,” said Beauchamp first, who had either the most\r\nfeeling or the least dissimulation, “allow me to congratulate you; this\r\nis a very unhoped-for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair.”\r\n\r\nAlbert remained silent and wrapped in thought. Château-Renaud contented\r\nhimself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane.\r\n\r\n“Are we not going?” said he, after this embarrassing silence.\r\n\r\n“When you please,” replied Beauchamp; “allow me only to compliment M.\r\nde Morcerf, who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“It is magnificent,” continued Beauchamp, “to be able to exercise so\r\nmuch self-control!”\r\n\r\n“Assuredly; as for me, I should have been incapable of it,” said\r\nChâteau-Renaud, with most significant coolness.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” interrupted Albert, “I think you did not understand that\r\nsomething very serious had passed between M. de Monte Cristo and\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly, possibly,” said Beauchamp immediately; “but every simpleton\r\nwould not be able to understand your heroism, and sooner or later you\r\nwill find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically\r\nthan would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your\r\nlife. May I give you a friendly counsel? Set out for Naples, the Hague,\r\nor St. Petersburg—calm countries, where the point of honor is better\r\nunderstood than among our hot-headed Parisians. Seek quietude and\r\noblivion, so that you may return peaceably to France after a few years.\r\nAm I not right, M. de Château-Renaud?”\r\n\r\n40252m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“That is quite my opinion,” said the gentleman; “nothing induces\r\nserious duels so much as a duel forsworn.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, gentlemen,” replied Albert, with a smile of indifference;\r\n“I shall follow your advice—not because you give it, but because I had\r\nbefore intended to quit France. I thank you equally for the service you\r\nhave rendered me in being my seconds. It is deeply engraved on my\r\nheart, and, after what you have just said, I remember that only.”\r\n\r\nChâteau-Renaud and Beauchamp looked at each other; the impression was\r\nthe same on both of them, and the tone in which Morcerf had just\r\nexpressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have\r\nbecome embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Albert,” said Beauchamp suddenly, carelessly extending his\r\nhand to the young man. The latter did not appear to arouse from his\r\nlethargy; in fact, he did not notice the offered hand.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” said Château-Renaud in his turn, keeping his little cane in\r\nhis left hand, and saluting with his right.\r\n\r\nAlbert’s lips scarcely whispered “Good-bye,” but his look was more\r\nexplicit; it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger, proud disdain,\r\nand generous indignation. He preserved his melancholy and motionless\r\nposition for some time after his two friends had regained their\r\ncarriage; then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to\r\nwhich his servant had tied it, he mounted and galloped off in the\r\ndirection of Paris.\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the Rue du Helder.\r\nAs he alighted, he thought he saw his father’s pale face behind the\r\ncurtain of the count’s bedroom. Albert turned away his head with a\r\nsigh, and went to his own apartments. He cast one lingering look on all\r\nthe luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his\r\ninfancy; he looked at the pictures, whose faces seemed to smile, and\r\nthe landscapes, which appeared painted in brighter colors. Then he took\r\naway his mother’s portrait, with its oaken frame, leaving the gilt\r\nframe from which he took it black and empty. Then he arranged all his\r\nbeautiful Turkish arms, his fine English guns, his Japanese china, his\r\ncups mounted in silver, his artistic bronzes by Feuchères or Barye;\r\nexamined the cupboards, and placed the key in each; threw into a drawer\r\nof his secretaire, which he left open, all the pocket-money he had\r\nabout him, and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his\r\njewel-boxes; then he made an exact inventory of everything, and placed\r\nit in the most conspicuous part of the table, after putting aside the\r\nbooks and papers which had collected there.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this work, his servant, notwithstanding orders to\r\nthe contrary, came to his room.\r\n\r\n“What do you want?” asked he, with a more sorrowful than angry tone.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, sir,” replied the valet; “you had forbidden me to disturb\r\nyou, but the Count of Morcerf has called me.”\r\n\r\n“Well!” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“I did not like to go to him without first seeing you.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because the count is doubtless aware that I accompanied you to the\r\nmeeting this morning.”\r\n\r\n40254m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is probable,” said Albert.\r\n\r\n“And since he has sent for me, it is doubtless to question me on what\r\nhappened there. What must I answer?”\r\n\r\n“The truth.”\r\n\r\n“Then I shall say the duel did not take place?”\r\n\r\n“You will say I apologized to the Count of Monte Cristo. Go.”\r\n\r\nThe valet bowed and retired, and Albert returned to his inventory. As\r\nhe was finishing this work, the sound of horses prancing in the yard,\r\nand the wheels of a carriage shaking his window, attracted his\r\nattention. He approached the window, and saw his father get into it,\r\nand drive away. The door was scarcely closed when Albert bent his steps\r\nto his mother’s room; and, no one being there to announce him, he\r\nadvanced to her bedchamber, and distressed by what he saw and guessed,\r\nstopped for one moment at the door.\r\n\r\nAs if the same idea had animated these two beings, Mercédès was doing\r\nthe same in her apartments that he had just done in his. Everything was\r\nin order,—laces, dresses, jewels, linen, money, all were arranged in\r\nthe drawers, and the countess was carefully collecting the keys. Albert\r\nsaw all these preparations and understood them, and exclaiming, “My\r\nmother!” he threw his arms around her neck.\r\n\r\nThe artist who could have depicted the expression of these two\r\ncountenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture. All\r\nthese proofs of an energetic resolution, which Albert did not fear on\r\nhis own account, alarmed him for his mother. “What are you doing?”\r\nasked he.\r\n\r\n“What were you doing?” replied she.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my mother!” exclaimed Albert, so overcome he could scarcely speak;\r\n“it is not the same with you and me—you cannot have made the same\r\nresolution I have, for I have come to warn you that I bid adieu to your\r\nhouse, and—and to you.”\r\n\r\n“I also,” replied Mercédès, “am going, and I acknowledge I had depended\r\non your accompanying me; have I deceived myself?”\r\n\r\n“Mother,” said Albert with firmness. “I cannot make you share the fate\r\nI have planned for myself. I must live henceforth without rank and\r\nfortune, and to begin this hard apprenticeship I must borrow from a\r\nfriend the loaf I shall eat until I have earned one. So, my dear\r\nmother, I am going at once to ask Franz to lend me the small sum I\r\nshall require to supply my present wants.”\r\n\r\n“You, my poor child, suffer poverty and hunger? Oh, do not say so; it\r\nwill break my resolutions.”\r\n\r\n“But not mine, mother,” replied Albert. “I am young and strong; I\r\nbelieve I am courageous, and since yesterday I have learned the power\r\nof will. Alas, my dear mother, some have suffered so much, and yet\r\nlive, and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of\r\nhappiness which heaven had made them—on the fragments of all the hope\r\nwhich God had given them! I have seen that, mother; I know that from\r\nthe gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with\r\nso much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former\r\nconquerors, and have punished them. No, mother; from this moment I have\r\ndone with the past, and accept nothing from it—not even a name, because\r\nyou can understand that your son cannot bear the name of a man who\r\nought to blush for it before another.”\r\n\r\n“Albert, my child,” said Mercédès, “if I had a stronger heart, that is\r\nthe counsel I would have given you; your conscience has spoken when my\r\nvoice became too weak; listen to its dictates. You had friends, Albert;\r\nbreak off their acquaintance. But do not despair; you have life before\r\nyou, my dear Albert, for you are yet scarcely twenty-two years old; and\r\nas a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name, take my father’s—it\r\nwas Herrera. I am sure, my dear Albert, whatever may be your career,\r\nyou will soon render that name illustrious. Then, my son, return to the\r\nworld still more brilliant because of your former sorrows; and if I am\r\nwrong, still let me cherish these hopes, for I have no future to look\r\nforward to. For me the grave opens when I pass the threshold of this\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\n“I will fulfil all your wishes, my dear mother,” said the young man.\r\n“Yes, I share your hopes; the anger of Heaven will not pursue us, since\r\nyou are pure and I am innocent. But, since our resolution is formed,\r\nlet us act promptly. M. de Morcerf went out about half an hour ago; the\r\nopportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation.”\r\n\r\n“I am ready, my son,” said Mercédès.\r\n\r\nAlbert ran to fetch a carriage. He recollected that there was a small\r\nfurnished house to let in the Rue des Saints-Pères, where his mother\r\nwould find a humble but decent lodging, and thither he intended\r\nconducting the countess. As the carriage stopped at the door, and\r\nAlbert was alighting, a man approached and gave him a letter.\r\n\r\nAlbert recognized the bearer. “From the count,” said Bertuccio. Albert\r\ntook the letter, opened, and read it, then looked round for Bertuccio,\r\nbut he was gone.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast, and\r\nwithout uttering a word he gave her the letter. Mercédès read:\r\n\r\n“Albert,—While showing you that I have discovered your plans, I hope\r\nalso to convince you of my delicacy. You are free, you leave the\r\ncount’s house, and you take your mother to your home; but reflect,\r\nAlbert, you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her. Keep\r\nthe struggle for yourself, bear all the suffering, but spare her the\r\ntrial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts; for she\r\ndeserves not even the shadow of the misfortune which has this day\r\nfallen on her, and Providence is not willing that the innocent should\r\nsuffer for the guilty. I know you are going to leave the Rue du Helder\r\nwithout taking anything with you. Do not seek to know how I discovered\r\nit; I know it—that is sufficient.\r\n\r\n“Now, listen, Albert. Twenty-four years ago I returned, proud and\r\njoyful, to my country. I had a betrothed, Albert, a lovely girl whom I\r\nadored, and I was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis,\r\npainfully amassed by ceaseless toil. This money was for her; I destined\r\nit for her, and, knowing the treachery of the sea I buried our treasure\r\nin the little garden of the house my father lived in at Marseilles, on\r\nthe Allées de Meilhan. Your mother, Albert, knows that poor house well.\r\nA short time since I passed through Marseilles, and went to see the old\r\nplace, which revived so many painful recollections; and in the evening\r\nI took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had\r\nconcealed my treasure. The iron box was there—no one had touched\r\nit—under a beautiful fig-tree my father had planted the day I was born,\r\nwhich overshadowed the spot. Well, Albert, this money, which was\r\nformerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman\r\nI adored, may now, through strange and painful circumstances, be\r\ndevoted to the same purpose.\r\n\r\n“Oh, feel for me, who could offer millions to that poor woman, but who\r\nreturn her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof\r\nsince the day I was torn from her I loved. You are a generous man,\r\nAlbert, but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment; if you\r\nrefuse me, if you ask another for what I have a right to offer you, I\r\nwill say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at\r\nthe hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in\r\nall the horrors of poverty and despair.”\r\n\r\nAlbert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide\r\nafter she had finished reading this letter. Mercédès turned her eyes\r\nwith an ineffable look towards heaven.\r\n\r\n“I accept it,” said she; “he has a right to pay the dowry, which I\r\nshall take with me to some convent!”\r\n\r\nPutting the letter in her bosom, she took her son’s arm, and with a\r\nfirmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 92. The Suicide\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Monte Cristo had also returned to town with Emmanuel and\r\nMaximilian. Their return was cheerful. Emmanuel did not conceal his joy\r\nat the peaceful termination of the affair, and was loud in his\r\nexpressions of delight. Morrel, in a corner of the carriage, allowed\r\nhis brother-in-law’s gayety to expend itself in words, while he felt\r\nequal inward joy, which, however, betrayed itself only in his\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\nAt the Barrière du Trône they met Bertuccio, who was waiting there,\r\nmotionless as a sentinel at his post. Monte Cristo put his head out of\r\nthe window, exchanged a few words with him in a low tone, and the\r\nsteward disappeared.\r\n\r\n“Count,” said Emmanuel, when they were at the end of the Place Royale,\r\n“put me down at my door, that my wife may not have a single moment of\r\nneedless anxiety on my account or yours.”\r\n\r\n“If it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph, said\r\nMorrel, I would invite the count to our house; besides that, he\r\ndoubtless has some trembling heart to comfort. So we will take leave of\r\nour friend, and let him hasten home.”\r\n\r\n“Stop a moment,” said Monte Cristo; “do not let me lose both my\r\ncompanions. Return, Emmanuel, to your charming wife, and present my\r\nbest compliments to her; and do you, Morrel, accompany me to the\r\nChamps-Élysées.”\r\n\r\n“Willingly,” said Maximilian; “particularly as I have business in that\r\nquarter.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we wait breakfast for you?” asked Emmanuel.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the young man. The door was closed, and the carriage\r\nproceeded. “See what good fortune I brought you!” said Morrel, when he\r\nwas alone with the count. “Have you not thought so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Monte Cristo; “for that reason I wished to keep you near\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“It is miraculous!” continued Morrel, answering his own thoughts.\r\n\r\n“What?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“What has just happened.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Count, “you are right—it is miraculous.”\r\n\r\n“For Albert is brave,” resumed Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Very brave,” said Monte Cristo; “I have seen him sleep with a sword\r\nsuspended over his head.”\r\n\r\n“And I know he has fought two duels,” said Morrel. “How can you\r\nreconcile that with his conduct this morning?”\r\n\r\n“All owing to your influence,” replied Monte Cristo, smiling.\r\n\r\n“It is well for Albert he is not in the army,” said Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“An apology on the ground!” said the young captain, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said the count mildly, “do not entertain the prejudices of\r\nordinary men, Morrel! Acknowledge, that if Albert is brave, he cannot\r\nbe a coward; he must then have had some reason for acting as he did\r\nthis morning, and confess that his conduct is more heroic than\r\notherwise.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, doubtless,” said Morrel; “but I shall say, like the\r\nSpaniard, ‘He has not been so brave today as he was yesterday.’”\r\n\r\n“You will breakfast with me, will you not, Morrel?” said the count, to\r\nturn the conversation.\r\n\r\n“No; I must leave you at ten o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Your engagement was for breakfast, then?” said the count.\r\n\r\nMorrel smiled, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Still you must breakfast somewhere.”\r\n\r\n“But if I am not hungry?” said the young man.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said the count, “I only know two things which destroy the\r\nappetite,—grief—and as I am happy to see you very cheerful, it is not\r\nthat—and love. Now after what you told me this morning of your heart, I\r\nmay believe——”\r\n\r\n“Well, count,” replied Morrel gayly, “I will not dispute it.”\r\n\r\n“But you will not make me your confidant, Maximilian?” said the count,\r\nin a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\n“I showed you this morning that I had a heart, did I not, count?” Monte\r\nCristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man. “Well,”\r\ncontinued the latter, “since that heart is no longer with you in the\r\nBois de Vincennes, it is elsewhere, and I must go and find it.”\r\n\r\n“Go,” said the count deliberately; “go, dear friend, but promise me if\r\nyou meet with any obstacle to remember that I have some power in this\r\nworld, that I am happy to use that power in the behalf of those I love,\r\nand that I love you, Morrel.”\r\n\r\n40260m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I will remember it,” said the young man, “as selfish children\r\nrecollect their parents when they want their aid. When I need your\r\nassistance, and the moment arrives, I will come to you, count.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I rely upon your promise. Good-bye, then.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, till we meet again.”\r\n\r\nThey had arrived in the Champs-Élysées. Monte Cristo opened the\r\ncarriage-door, Morrel sprang out on the pavement, Bertuccio was waiting\r\non the steps. Morrel disappeared down the Avenue de Marigny, and Monte\r\nCristo hastened to join Bertuccio.\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“She is going to leave her house,” said the steward.\r\n\r\n“And her son?”\r\n\r\n“Florentin, his valet, thinks he is going to do the same.”\r\n\r\n“Come this way.” Monte Cristo took Bertuccio into his study, wrote the\r\nletter we have seen, and gave it to the steward. “Go,” said he quickly.\r\n“But first, let Haydée be informed that I have returned.”\r\n\r\n“Here I am,” said the young girl, who at the sound of the carriage had\r\nrun downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count\r\nreturn safely. Bertuccio left. Every transport of a daughter finding a\r\nfather, all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover, were felt\r\nby Haydée during the first moments of this meeting, which she had so\r\neagerly expected. Doubtless, although less evident, Monte Cristo’s joy\r\nwas not less intense. Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like\r\nthe dew on the ground after a long drought; both the heart and the\r\nground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them, and nothing is\r\noutwardly apparent.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo was beginning to think, what he had not for a long time\r\ndared to believe, that there were two Mercédès in the world, and he\r\nmight yet be happy. His eye, elate with happiness, was reading eagerly\r\nthe tearful gaze of Haydée, when suddenly the door opened. The count\r\nknit his brow.\r\n\r\n“M. de Morcerf!” said Baptistin, as if that name sufficed for his\r\nexcuse. In fact, the count’s face brightened.\r\n\r\n“Which,” asked he, “the viscount or the count?”\r\n\r\n“The count.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” exclaimed Haydée, “is it not yet over?”\r\n\r\n“I know not if it is finished, my beloved child,” said Monte Cristo,\r\ntaking the young girl’s hands; “but I do know you have nothing more to\r\nfear.”\r\n\r\n“But it is the wretched——”\r\n\r\n“That man cannot injure me, Haydée,” said Monte Cristo; “it was his son\r\nalone that there was cause to fear.”\r\n\r\n“And what I have suffered,” said the young girl, “you shall never know,\r\nmy lord.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo smiled. “By my father’s tomb,” said he, extending his hand\r\nover the head of the young girl, “I swear to you, Haydée, that if any\r\nmisfortune happens, it will not be to me.”\r\n\r\n“I believe you, my lord, as implicitly as if God had spoken to me,”\r\nsaid the young girl, presenting her forehead to him. Monte Cristo\r\npressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts\r\nthrob at once, the one violently, the other secretly.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” murmured the count, “shall I then be permitted to love again? Ask\r\nM. de Morcerf into the drawing-room,” said he to Baptistin, while he\r\nled the beautiful Greek girl to a private staircase.\r\n\r\nWe must explain this visit, which although expected by Monte Cristo, is\r\nunexpected to our readers. While Mercédès, as we have said, was making\r\na similar inventory of her property to Albert’s, while she was\r\narranging her jewels, shutting her drawers, collecting her keys, to\r\nleave everything in perfect order, she did not perceive a pale and\r\nsinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage, from\r\nwhich everything could be both seen and heard. He who was thus looking,\r\nwithout being heard or seen, probably heard and saw all that passed in\r\nMadame de Morcerf’s apartments. From that glass door the pale-faced man\r\nwent to the count’s bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the\r\ncurtain of a window overlooking the courtyard. He remained there ten\r\nminutes, motionless and dumb, listening to the beating of his own\r\nheart. For him those ten minutes were very long. It was then Albert,\r\nreturning from his meeting with the count, perceived his father\r\nwatching for his arrival behind a curtain, and turned aside. The\r\ncount’s eye expanded; he knew Albert had insulted the count dreadfully,\r\nand that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a\r\ndeadly duel. Albert returned safely—then the count was revenged.\r\n\r\nAn indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like\r\nthe last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which\r\nbear the aspect, not of a downy couch, but of a tomb. But as we have\r\nsaid, he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the\r\naccount of his triumph. He easily understood why his son did not come\r\nto see him before he went to avenge his father’s honor; but when that\r\nwas done, why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms?\r\n\r\nIt was then, when the count could not see Albert, that he sent for his\r\nservant, who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him.\r\nTen minutes afterwards, General Morcerf was seen on the steps in a\r\nblack coat with a military collar, black pantaloons, and black gloves.\r\nHe had apparently given previous orders, for as he reached the bottom\r\nstep his carriage came from the coach-house ready for him. The valet\r\nthrew into the carriage his military cloak, in which two swords were\r\nwrapped, and, shutting the door, he took his seat by the side of the\r\ncoachman. The coachman stooped down for his orders.\r\n\r\n“To the Champs-Élysées,” said the general; “the Count of Monte\r\nCristo’s. Hurry!”\r\n\r\nThe horses bounded beneath the whip; and in five minutes they stopped\r\nbefore the count’s door. M. de Morcerf opened the door himself, and as\r\nthe carriage rolled away he passed up the walk, rang, and entered the\r\nopen door with his servant.\r\n\r\nA moment afterwards, Baptistin announced the Count of Morcerf to Monte\r\nCristo, and the latter, leading Haydée aside, ordered that Morcerf be\r\nasked into the drawing-room. The general was pacing the room the third\r\ntime when, in turning, he perceived Monte Cristo at the door.\r\n\r\n“Ah, it is M. de Morcerf,” said Monte Cristo quietly; “I thought I had\r\nnot heard aright.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is I,” said the count, whom a frightful contraction of the\r\nlips prevented from articulating freely.\r\n\r\n“May I know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing M. de\r\nMorcerf so early?”\r\n\r\n“Had you not a meeting with my son this morning?” asked the general.\r\n\r\n“I had,” replied the count.\r\n\r\n“And I know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you, and to\r\nendeavor to kill you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, he had very good ones; but you see that in spite of them he\r\nhas not killed me, and did not even fight.”\r\n\r\n“Yet he considered you the cause of his father’s dishonor, the cause of\r\nthe fearful ruin which has fallen on my house.”\r\n\r\n“It is true, sir,” said Monte Cristo with his dreadful calmness; “a\r\nsecondary cause, but not the principal.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless you made, then, some apology or explanation?”\r\n\r\n“I explained nothing, and it is he who apologized to me.”\r\n\r\n“But to what do you attribute this conduct?”\r\n\r\n“To the conviction, probably, that there was one more guilty than I.”\r\n\r\n“And who was that?”\r\n\r\n“His father.”\r\n\r\n“That may be,” said the count, turning pale; “but you know the guilty\r\ndo not like to find themselves convicted.”\r\n\r\n“I know it, and I expected this result.”\r\n\r\n“You expected my son would be a coward?” cried the count.\r\n\r\n“M. Albert de Morcerf is no coward!” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“A man who holds a sword in his hand, and sees a mortal enemy within\r\nreach of that sword, and does not fight, is a coward! Why is he not\r\nhere that I may tell him so?”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied Monte Cristo coldly, “I did not expect that you had come\r\nhere to relate to me your little family affairs. Go and tell M. Albert\r\nthat, and he may know what to answer you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no,” said the general, smiling faintly, “I did not come for\r\nthat purpose; you are right. I came to tell you that I also look upon\r\nyou as my enemy. I came to tell you that I hate you instinctively; that\r\nit seems as if I had always known you, and always hated you; and, in\r\nshort, since the young people of the present day will not fight, it\r\nremains for us to do so. Do you think so, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. And when I told you I had foreseen the result, it is the\r\nhonor of your visit I alluded to.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better. Are you prepared?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You know that we shall fight till one of us is dead,” said the\r\ngeneral, whose teeth were clenched with rage.\r\n\r\n40262m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Until one of us dies,” repeated Monte Cristo, moving his head slightly\r\nup and down.\r\n\r\n“Let us start, then; we need no witnesses.”\r\n\r\n“Very true,” said Monte Cristo; “it is unnecessary, we know each other\r\nso well!”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” said the count, “we know so little of each other.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo, with the same indomitable coolness; “let\r\nus see. Are you not the soldier Fernand who deserted on the eve of the\r\nbattle of Waterloo? Are you not the Lieutenant Fernand who served as\r\nguide and spy to the French army in Spain? Are you not the Captain\r\nFernand who betrayed, sold, and murdered his benefactor, Ali? And have\r\nnot all these Fernands, united, made Lieutenant-General, the Count of\r\nMorcerf, peer of France?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried the general, as if branded with a hot iron, “wretch,—to\r\nreproach me with my shame when about, perhaps, to kill me! No, I did\r\nnot say I was a stranger to you. I know well, demon, that you have\r\npenetrated into the darkness of the past, and that you have read, by\r\nthe light of what torch I know not, every page of my life; but perhaps\r\nI may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous\r\ncoverings. No—no, I am aware you know me; but I know you only as an\r\nadventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery. You call yourself, in Paris,\r\nthe Count of Monte Cristo; in Italy, Sinbad the Sailor; in Malta, I\r\nforget what. But it is your real name I want to know, in the midst of\r\nyour hundred names, that I may pronounce it when we meet to fight, at\r\nthe moment when I plunge my sword through your heart.”\r\n\r\nThe Count of Monte Cristo turned dreadfully pale; his eye seemed to\r\nburn with a devouring fire. He leaped towards a dressing-room near his\r\nbedroom, and in less than a moment, tearing off his cravat, his coat\r\nand waistcoat, he put on a sailor’s jacket and hat, from beneath which\r\nrolled his long black hair. He returned thus, formidable and\r\nimplacable, advancing with his arms crossed on his breast, towards the\r\ngeneral, who could not understand why he had disappeared, but who on\r\nseeing him again, and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under\r\nhim, drew back, and only stopped when he found a table to support his\r\nclenched hand.\r\n\r\n“Fernand,” cried he, “of my hundred names I need only tell you one, to\r\noverwhelm you! But you guess it now, do you not?—or, rather, you\r\nremember it? For, notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures, I\r\nshow you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young\r\nagain—a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your\r\nmarriage with Mercédès, my betrothed!”\r\n\r\n40268m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general, with his head thrown back, hands extended, gaze fixed,\r\nlooked silently at this dreadful apparition; then seeking the wall to\r\nsupport him, he glided along close to it until he reached the door,\r\nthrough which he went out backwards, uttering this single mournful,\r\nlamentable, distressing cry:\r\n\r\n“Edmond Dantès!”\r\n\r\nThen, with sighs which were unlike any human sound, he dragged himself\r\nto the door, reeled across the courtyard, and falling into the arms of\r\nhis valet, he said in a voice scarcely intelligible,—“Home, home.”\r\n\r\nThe fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before\r\nhis servants, partly recalled his senses, but the ride was short, and\r\nas he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived. He stopped at a\r\nshort distance from the house and alighted. The door was wide open, a\r\nhackney-coach was standing in the middle of the yard—a strange sight\r\nbefore so noble a mansion; the count looked at it with terror, but\r\nwithout daring to inquire its meaning, he rushed towards his apartment.\r\n\r\nTwo persons were coming down the stairs; he had only time to creep into\r\nan alcove to avoid them. It was Mercédès leaning on her son’s arm and\r\nleaving the house. They passed close by the unhappy being, who,\r\nconcealed behind the damask curtain, almost felt Mercédès dress brush\r\npast him, and his son’s warm breath, pronouncing these words:\r\n\r\n“Courage, mother! Come, this is no longer our home!”\r\n\r\nThe words died away, the steps were lost in the distance. The general\r\ndrew himself up, clinging to the curtain; he uttered the most dreadful\r\nsob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same\r\ntime by his wife and son. He soon heard the clatter of the iron step of\r\nthe hackney-coach, then the coachman’s voice, and then the rolling of\r\nthe heavy vehicle shook the windows. He darted to his bedroom to see\r\nonce more all he had loved in the world; but the hackney-coach drove on\r\nand the head of neither Mercédès nor her son appeared at the window to\r\ntake a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband.\r\n\r\nAnd at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the\r\ngateway a report was heard, and a thick smoke escaped through one of\r\nthe panes of the window, which was broken by the explosion.\r\n\r\n40270m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 93. Valentine\r\n\r\nWe may easily conceive where Morrel’s appointment was. On leaving Monte\r\nCristo he walked slowly towards Villefort’s; we say slowly, for Morrel\r\nhad more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps, but he\r\nhad hastened to take leave of Monte Cristo because he wished to be\r\nalone with his thoughts. He knew his time well—the hour when Valentine\r\nwas giving Noirtier his breakfast, and was sure not to be disturbed in\r\nthe performance of this pious duty. Noirtier and Valentine had given\r\nhim leave to go twice a week, and he was now availing himself of that\r\npermission.\r\n\r\nHe arrived; Valentine was expecting him. Uneasy and almost crazed, she\r\nseized his hand and led him to her grandfather. This uneasiness,\r\namounting almost to frenzy, arose from the report Morcerf’s adventure\r\nhad made in the world, for the affair at the Opera was generally known.\r\nNo one at Villefort’s doubted that a duel would ensue from it.\r\nValentine, with her woman’s instinct, guessed that Morrel would be\r\nMonte Cristo’s second, and from the young man’s well-known courage and\r\nhis great affection for the count, she feared that he would not content\r\nhimself with the passive part assigned to him. We may easily understand\r\nhow eagerly the particulars were asked for, given, and received; and\r\nMorrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved, when\r\nshe knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was\r\nunexpected.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Valentine, motioning to Morrel to sit down near her\r\ngrandfather, while she took her seat on his footstool,—“now let us talk\r\nabout our own affairs. You know, Maximilian, grandpapa once thought of\r\nleaving this house, and taking an apartment away from M. de\r\nVillefort’s.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Maximilian, “I recollect the project, of which I highly\r\napproved.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Valentine, “you may approve again, for grandpapa is again\r\nthinking of it.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo,” said Maximilian.\r\n\r\n40272m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“And do you know,” said Valentine, “what reason grandpapa gives for\r\nleaving this house.” Noirtier looked at Valentine to impose silence,\r\nbut she did not notice him; her looks, her eyes, her smile, were all\r\nfor Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Oh, whatever may be M. Noirtier’s reason,” answered Morrel, “I can\r\nreadily believe it to be a good one.”\r\n\r\n“An excellent one,” said Valentine. “He pretends the air of the\r\nFaubourg Saint-Honoré is not good for me.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Morrel; “in that M. Noirtier may be right; you have not\r\nseemed to be well for the last fortnight.”\r\n\r\n“Not very,” said Valentine. “And grandpapa has become my physician, and\r\nI have the greatest confidence in him, because he knows everything.”\r\n\r\n“Do you then really suffer?” asked Morrel quickly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it must not be called suffering; I feel a general uneasiness, that\r\nis all. I have lost my appetite, and my stomach feels as if it were\r\nstruggling to get accustomed to something.” Noirtier did not lose a\r\nword of what Valentine said.\r\n\r\n“And what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint?”\r\n\r\n“A very simple one,” said Valentine. “I swallow every morning a\r\nspoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather. When I say one\r\nspoonful, I began by one—now I take four. Grandpapa says it is a\r\npanacea.” Valentine smiled, but it was evident that she suffered.\r\n\r\nMaximilian, in his devotedness, gazed silently at her. She was very\r\nbeautiful, but her usual pallor had increased; her eyes were more\r\nbrilliant than ever, and her hands, which were generally white like\r\nmother-of-pearl, now more resembled wax, to which time was adding a\r\nyellowish hue.\r\n\r\nFrom Valentine the young man looked towards Noirtier. The latter\r\nwatched with strange and deep interest the young girl, absorbed by her\r\naffection, and he also, like Morrel, followed those traces of inward\r\nsuffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that\r\nthey escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Morrel, “I thought this mixture, of which you now take four\r\nspoonfuls, was prepared for M. Noirtier?”\r\n\r\n“I know it is very bitter,” said Valentine; “so bitter, that all I\r\ndrink afterwards appears to have the same taste.” Noirtier looked\r\ninquiringly at his granddaughter. “Yes, grandpapa,” said Valentine; “it\r\nis so. Just now, before I came down to you, I drank a glass of sugared\r\nwater; I left half, because it seemed so bitter.” Noirtier turned pale,\r\nand made a sign that he wished to speak.\r\n\r\nValentine rose to fetch the dictionary. Noirtier watched her with\r\nevident anguish. In fact, the blood was rushing to the young girl’s\r\nhead already, her cheeks were becoming red.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried she, without losing any of her cheerfulness, “this is\r\nsingular! I can’t see! Did the sun shine in my eyes?” And she leaned\r\nagainst the window.\r\n\r\n“The sun is not shining,” said Morrel, more alarmed by Noirtier’s\r\nexpression than by Valentine’s indisposition. He ran towards her. The\r\nyoung girl smiled.\r\n\r\n“Cheer up,” said she to Noirtier. “Do not be alarmed, Maximilian; it is\r\nnothing, and has already passed away. But listen! Do I not hear a\r\ncarriage in the courtyard?” She opened Noirtier’s door, ran to a window\r\nin the passage, and returned hastily. “Yes,” said she, “it is Madame\r\nDanglars and her daughter, who have come to call on us. Good-bye;—I\r\nmust run away, for they would send here for me, or, rather, farewell\r\ntill I see you again. Stay with grandpapa, Maximilian; I promise you\r\nnot to persuade them to stay.”\r\n\r\n40274m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMorrel watched her as she left the room; he heard her ascend the little\r\nstaircase which led both to Madame de Villefort’s apartments and to\r\nhers. As soon as she was gone, Noirtier made a sign to Morrel to take\r\nthe dictionary. Morrel obeyed; guided by Valentine, he had learned how\r\nto understand the old man quickly. Accustomed, however, as he was to\r\nthe work, he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to\r\nfind every word in the dictionary, so that it was ten minutes before\r\nthe thought of the old man was translated by these words,\r\n\r\n“Fetch the glass of water and the decanter from Valentine’s room.”\r\n\r\nMorrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barrois’s\r\nsituation, and in Noirtier’s name gave that order. The servant soon\r\nreturned. The decanter and the glass were completely empty. Noirtier\r\nmade a sign that he wished to speak.\r\n\r\n“Why are the glass and decanter empty?” asked he; “Valentine said she\r\nonly drank half the glassful.”\r\n\r\nThe translation of this new question occupied another five minutes.\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” said the servant, “but the housemaid is in\r\nMademoiselle Valentine’s room: perhaps she has emptied them.”\r\n\r\n“Ask her,” said Morrel, translating Noirtier’s thought this time by his\r\nlook. The servant went out, but returned almost immediately.\r\n“Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go to Madame de\r\nVillefort’s,” said he; “and in passing, as she was thirsty, she drank\r\nwhat remained in the glass; as for the decanter, Master Edward had\r\nemptied that to make a pond for his ducks.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as a gambler does who stakes his\r\nall on one stroke. From that moment the old man’s eyes were fixed on\r\nthe door, and did not quit it.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Madame Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine had seen;\r\nthey had been ushered into Madame de Villefort’s room, who had said she\r\nwould receive them there. That is why Valentine passed through her\r\nroom, which was on a level with Valentine’s, and only separated from it\r\nby Edward’s. The two ladies entered the drawing-room with that sort of\r\nofficial stiffness which preludes a formal communication. Among worldly\r\npeople manner is contagious. Madame de Villefort received them with\r\nequal solemnity. Valentine entered at this moment, and the formalities\r\nwere resumed.\r\n\r\n“My dear friend,” said the baroness, while the two young people were\r\nshaking hands, “I and Eugénie are come to be the first to announce to\r\nyou the approaching marriage of my daughter with Prince Cavalcanti.”\r\nDanglars kept up the title of prince. The popular banker found that it\r\nanswered better than count.\r\n\r\n“Allow me to present you my sincere congratulations,” replied Madame de\r\nVillefort. “Prince Cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare\r\nqualities.”\r\n\r\n40276m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said the baroness, smiling; “speaking to you as a friend I\r\ncan say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be. He has\r\nabout him a little of that foreign manner by which French persons\r\nrecognize, at first sight, the Italian or German nobleman. Besides, he\r\ngives evidence of great kindness of disposition, much keenness of wit,\r\nand as to suitability, M. Danglars assures me that his fortune is\r\nmajestic—that is his word.”\r\n\r\n“And then,” said Eugénie, while turning over the leaves of Madame de\r\nVillefort’s album, “add that you have taken a great fancy to the young\r\nman.”\r\n\r\n“And,” said Madame de Villefort, “I need not ask you if you share that\r\nfancy.”\r\n\r\n“I?” replied Eugénie with her usual candor. “Oh, not the least in the\r\nworld, madame! My wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares, or\r\nthe caprices of any man, but to be an artist, and consequently free in\r\nheart, in person, and in thought.”\r\n\r\nEugénie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color\r\nmounted to Valentine’s cheeks. The timid girl could not understand that\r\nvigorous nature which appeared to have none of the timidities of woman.\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said she, “since I am to be married whether I will or\r\nnot, I ought to be thankful to Providence for having released me from\r\nmy engagement with M. Albert de Morcerf, or I should this day have been\r\nthe wife of a dishonored man.”\r\n\r\n“It is true,” said the baroness, with that strange simplicity sometimes\r\nmet with among fashionable ladies, and of which plebeian intercourse\r\ncan never entirely deprive them,—“it is very true that had not the\r\nMorcerfs hesitated, my daughter would have married Monsieur Albert. The\r\ngeneral depended much on it; he even came to force M. Danglars. We have\r\nhad a narrow escape.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Valentine, timidly, “does all the father’s shame revert\r\nupon the son? Monsieur Albert appears to me quite innocent of the\r\ntreason charged against the general.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” said the implacable young girl, “Monsieur Albert claims\r\nand well deserves his share. It appears that after having challenged M.\r\nde Monte Cristo at the Opera yesterday, he apologized on the ground\r\ntoday.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible,” said Madame de Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear friend,” said Madame Danglars, with the same simplicity we\r\nbefore noticed, “it is a fact. I heard it from M. Debray, who was\r\npresent at the explanation.”\r\n\r\nValentine also knew the truth, but she did not answer. A single word\r\nhad reminded her that Morrel was expecting her in M. Noirtier’s room.\r\nDeeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation, Valentine had\r\nceased for a moment to join in the conversation. She would, indeed,\r\nhave found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few\r\nminutes, when suddenly Madame Danglars’ hand, pressed on her arm,\r\naroused her from her lethargy.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” said she, starting at Madame Danglars’ touch as she would\r\nhave done from an electric shock.\r\n\r\n“It is, my dear Valentine,” said the baroness, “that you are,\r\ndoubtless, suffering.”\r\n\r\n40280m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I?” said the young girl, passing her hand across her burning forehead.\r\n\r\n“Yes, look at yourself in that glass; you have turned pale and then red\r\nsuccessively, three or four times in one minute.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” cried Eugénie, “you are very pale!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, do not be alarmed; I have been so for many days.” Artless as she\r\nwas, the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave, and\r\nbesides, Madame de Villefort came to her assistance.\r\n\r\n“Retire, Valentine,” said she; “you are really suffering, and these\r\nladies will excuse you; drink a glass of pure water, it will restore\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nValentine kissed Eugénie, bowed to Madame Danglars, who had already\r\nrisen to take her leave, and went out.\r\n\r\n“That poor child,” said Madame de Villefort when Valentine was gone,\r\n“she makes me very uneasy, and I should not be astonished if she had\r\nsome serious illness.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Valentine, in a sort of excitement which she could not quite\r\nunderstand, had crossed Edward’s room without noticing some trick of\r\nthe child, and through her own had reached the little staircase.\r\n\r\nShe was within three steps of the bottom; she already heard Morrel’s\r\nvoice, when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes, her stiffened foot\r\nmissed the step, her hands had no power to hold the baluster, and\r\nfalling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the\r\nfloor. Morrel bounded to the door, opened it, and found Valentine\r\nstretched out at the bottom of the stairs. Quick as a flash, he raised\r\nher in his arms and placed her in a chair. Valentine opened her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a clumsy thing I am,” said she with feverish volubility; “I\r\ndon’t know my way. I forgot there were three more steps before the\r\nlanding.”\r\n\r\n“You have hurt yourself, perhaps,” said Morrel. “What can I do for you,\r\nValentine?”\r\n\r\nValentine looked around her; she saw the deepest terror depicted in\r\nNoirtier’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, dear grandpapa,” said she, endeavoring to smile; “it is\r\nnothing—it is nothing; I was giddy, that is all.”\r\n\r\n“Another attack of giddiness,” said Morrel, clasping his hands. “Oh,\r\nattend to it, Valentine, I entreat you.”\r\n\r\n“But no,” said Valentine,—“no, I tell you it is all past, and it was\r\nnothing. Now, let me tell you some news; Eugénie is to be married in a\r\nweek, and in three days there is to be a grand feast, a betrothal\r\nfestival. We are all invited, my father, Madame de Villefort, and I—at\r\nleast, I understood it so.”\r\n\r\n“When will it be our turn to think of these things? Oh, Valentine, you\r\nwho have so much influence over your grandpapa, try to make him\r\nanswer—Soon.”\r\n\r\n“And do you,” said Valentine, “depend on me to stimulate the tardiness\r\nand arouse the memory of grandpapa?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” cried Morrel, “make haste. So long as you are not mine,\r\nValentine, I shall always think I may lose you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” replied Valentine with a convulsive movement, “oh, indeed,\r\nMaximilian, you are too timid for an officer, for a soldier who, they\r\nsay, never knows fear. Ha, ha, ha!”\r\n\r\nShe burst into a forced and melancholy laugh, her arms stiffened and\r\ntwisted, her head fell back on her chair, and she remained motionless.\r\nThe cry of terror which was stopped on Noirtier’s lips, seemed to start\r\nfrom his eyes. Morrel understood it; he knew he must call assistance.\r\nThe young man rang the bell violently; the housemaid who had been in\r\nMademoiselle Valentine’s room, and the servant who had replaced\r\nBarrois, ran in at the same moment. Valentine was so pale, so cold, so\r\ninanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were\r\nseized with the fear which pervaded that house, and they flew into the\r\npassage crying for help. Madame Danglars and Eugénie were going out at\r\nthat moment; they heard the cause of the disturbance.\r\n\r\n“I told you so!” exclaimed Madame de Villefort. “Poor child!”\r\n\r\n40278m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 94. Maximilian’s Avowal\r\n\r\nAt the same moment M. de Villefort’s voice was heard calling from his\r\nstudy, “What is the matter?”\r\n\r\nMorrel looked at Noirtier who had recovered his self-command, and with\r\na glance indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar\r\ncircumstances, he had taken refuge. He had only time to get his hat and\r\nthrow himself breathless into the closet when the procureur’s footstep\r\nwas heard in the passage.\r\n\r\nVillefort sprang into the room, ran to Valentine, and took her in his\r\narms.\r\n\r\n“A physician, a physician,—M. d’Avrigny!” cried Villefort; “or rather I\r\nwill go for him myself.”\r\n\r\nHe flew from the apartment, and Morrel at the same moment darted out at\r\nthe other door. He had been struck to the heart by a frightful\r\nrecollection—the conversation he had heard between the doctor and\r\nVillefort the night of Madame de Saint-Méran’s death, recurred to him;\r\nthese symptoms, to a less alarming extent, were the same which had\r\npreceded the death of Barrois. At the same time Monte Cristo’s voice\r\nseemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours\r\nbefore, “Whatever you want, Morrel, come to me; I have great power.”\r\n\r\nMore rapidly than thought, he darted down the Rue Matignon, and thence\r\nto the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile M. de Villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at M.\r\nd’Avrigny’s door. He rang so violently that the porter was alarmed.\r\nVillefort ran upstairs without saying a word. The porter knew him, and\r\nlet him pass, only calling to him:\r\n\r\n“In his study, Monsieur Procureur—in his study!” Villefort pushed, or\r\nrather forced, the door open.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the doctor, “is it you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Villefort, closing the door after him, “it is I, who am\r\ncome in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone. Doctor, my house is\r\naccursed!”\r\n\r\n“What?” said the latter with apparent coolness, but with deep emotion,\r\n“have you another invalid?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, doctor,” cried Villefort, clutching his hair, “yes!”\r\n\r\nD’Avrigny’s look implied, “I told you it would be so.” Then he slowly\r\nuttered these words, “Who is now dying in your house? What new victim\r\nis going to accuse you of weakness before God?”\r\n\r\nA mournful sob burst from Villefort’s heart; he approached the doctor,\r\nand seizing his arm,—“Valentine,” said he, “it is Valentine’s turn!”\r\n\r\n40284m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Your daughter!” cried d’Avrigny with grief and surprise.\r\n\r\n“You see you were deceived,” murmured the magistrate; “come and see\r\nher, and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“Each time you have applied to me,” said the doctor, “it has been too\r\nlate; still I will go. But let us make haste, sir; with the enemies you\r\nhave to do with there is no time to be lost.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, this time, doctor, you shall not have to reproach me with\r\nweakness. This time I will know the assassin, and will pursue him.”\r\n\r\n“Let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her,”\r\nsaid d’Avrigny. “Come.”\r\n\r\nThe same cabriolet which had brought Villefort took them back at full\r\nspeed, and at this moment Morrel rapped at Monte Cristo’s door.\r\n\r\nThe count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something\r\nwhich Bertuccio had brought in haste. Hearing the name of Morrel, who\r\nhad left him only two hours before, the count raised his head, arose,\r\nand sprang to meet him.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, Maximilian?” asked he; “you are pale, and the\r\nperspiration rolls from your forehead.” Morrel fell into a chair.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said he, “I came quickly; I wanted to speak to you.”\r\n\r\n“Are all your family well?” asked the count, with an affectionate\r\nbenevolence, whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, count—thank you,” said the young man, evidently embarrassed\r\nhow to begin the conversation; “yes, everyone in my family is well.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better; yet you have something to tell me?” replied the\r\ncount with increased anxiety.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Morrel, “it is true; I have but now left a house where\r\ndeath has just entered, to run to you.”\r\n\r\n“Are you then come from M. de Morcerf’s?” asked Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Morrel; “is someone dead in his house?”\r\n\r\n“The general has just blown his brains out,” replied Monte Cristo with\r\ngreat coolness.\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a dreadful event!” cried Maximilian.\r\n\r\n“Not for the countess, or for Albert,” said Monte Cristo; “a dead\r\nfather or husband is better than a dishonored one,—blood washes out\r\nshame.”\r\n\r\n“Poor countess,” said Maximilian, “I pity her very much; she is so\r\nnoble a woman!”\r\n\r\n“Pity Albert also, Maximilian; for believe me he is the worthy son of\r\nthe countess. But let us return to yourself. You have hastened to\r\nme—can I have the happiness of being useful to you?”\r\n\r\n40286m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes, I need your help: that is I thought like a madman that you could\r\nlend me your assistance in a case where God alone can succor me.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me what it is,” replied Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Morrel, “I know not, indeed, if I may reveal this secret to\r\nmortal ears, but fatality impels me, necessity constrains me, count——”\r\nMorrel hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Do you think I love you?” said Monte Cristo, taking the young man’s\r\nhand affectionately in his.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you encourage me, and something tells me there,” placing his hand\r\non his heart, “that I ought to have no secret from you.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, Morrel; God is speaking to your heart, and your heart\r\nspeaks to you. Tell me what it says.”\r\n\r\n“Count, will you allow me to send Baptistin to inquire after someone\r\nyou know?”\r\n\r\n“I am at your service, and still more my servants.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I cannot live if she is not better.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I ring for Baptistin?”\r\n\r\n“No, I will go and speak to him myself.” Morrel went out, called\r\nBaptistin, and whispered a few words to him. The valet ran directly.\r\n\r\n“Well, have you sent?” asked Monte Cristo, seeing Morrel return.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and now I shall be more calm.”\r\n\r\n“You know I am waiting,” said Monte Cristo, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and I will tell you. One evening I was in a garden; a clump of\r\ntrees concealed me; no one suspected I was there. Two persons passed\r\nnear me—allow me to conceal their names for the present; they were\r\nspeaking in an undertone, and yet I was so interested in what they said\r\nthat I did not lose a single word.”\r\n\r\n“This is a gloomy introduction, if I may judge from your pallor and\r\nshuddering, Morrel.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, very gloomy, my friend. Someone had just died in the house to\r\nwhich that garden belonged. One of the persons whose conversation I\r\noverheard was the master of the house; the other, the physician. The\r\nformer was confiding to the latter his grief and fear, for it was the\r\nsecond time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly\r\nentered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some\r\nexterminating angel, as an object of God’s anger.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed?” said Monte Cristo, looking earnestly at the young man,\r\nand by an imperceptible movement turning his chair, so that he remained\r\nin the shade while the light fell full on Maximilian’s face.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” continued Morrel, “death had entered that house twice within one\r\nmonth.”\r\n\r\n“And what did the doctor answer?” asked Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“He replied—he replied, that the death was not a natural one, and must\r\nbe attributed”—\r\n\r\n“To what?”\r\n\r\n“To poison.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” said Monte Cristo with a slight cough which in moments of\r\nextreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush, or his pallor, or the\r\nintense interest with which he listened; “indeed, Maximilian, did you\r\nhear that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear count, I heard it; and the doctor added that if another\r\ndeath occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo listened, or appeared to do so, with the greatest\r\ncalmness.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Maximilian, “death came a third time, and neither the\r\nmaster of the house nor the doctor said a word. Death is now, perhaps,\r\nstriking a fourth blow. Count, what am I bound to do, being in\r\npossession of this secret?”\r\n\r\n“My dear friend,” said Monte Cristo, “you appear to be relating an\r\nadventure which we all know by heart. I know the house where you heard\r\nit, or one very similar to it; a house with a garden, a master, a\r\nphysician, and where there have been three unexpected and sudden\r\ndeaths. Well, I have not intercepted your confidence, and yet I know\r\nall that as well as you, and I have no conscientious scruples. No, it\r\ndoes not concern me. You say an exterminating angel appears to have\r\ndevoted that house to God’s anger—well, who says your supposition is\r\nnot reality? Do not notice things which those whose interest it is to\r\nsee them pass over. If it is God’s justice, instead of his anger, which\r\nis walking through that house, Maximilian, turn away your face and let\r\nhis justice accomplish its purpose.”\r\n\r\nMorrel shuddered. There was something mournful, solemn, and terrible in\r\nthe count’s manner.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” continued he, in so changed a tone that no one would have\r\nsupposed it was the same person speaking—“besides, who says that it\r\nwill begin again?”\r\n\r\n“It has returned, count,” exclaimed Morrel; “that is why I hastened to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you wish me to do? Do you wish me, for instance, to give\r\ninformation to the procureur?” Monte Cristo uttered the last words with\r\nso much meaning that Morrel, starting up, cried out:\r\n\r\n“You know of whom I speak, count, do you not?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly well, my good friend; and I will prove it to you by putting\r\nthe dots to the _i_, or rather by naming the persons. You were walking\r\none evening in M. de Villefort’s garden; from what you relate, I\r\nsuppose it to have been the evening of Madame de Saint-Méran’s death.\r\nYou heard M. de Villefort talking to M. d’Avrigny about the death of M.\r\nde Saint-Méran, and that no less surprising, of the countess. M.\r\nd’Avrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison; and you,\r\nhonest man, have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your\r\nconscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret. We\r\nare no longer in the Middle Ages; there is no longer a Vehmgericht, or\r\nFree Tribunals; what do you want to ask these people? ‘Conscience, what\r\nhast thou to do with me?’ as Sterne said. My dear fellow, let them\r\nsleep on, if they are asleep; let them grow pale in their drowsiness,\r\nif they are disposed to do so, and pray do you remain in peace, who\r\nhave no remorse to disturb you.”\r\n\r\nDeep grief was depicted on Morrel’s features; he seized Monte Cristo’s\r\nhand. “But it is beginning again, I say!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Count, astonished at his perseverance, which he could\r\nnot understand, and looking still more earnestly at Maximilian, “let it\r\nbegin again,—it is like the house of the Atreidae;19 God has condemned\r\nthem, and they must submit to their punishment. They will all\r\ndisappear, like the fabrics children build with cards, and which fall,\r\none by one, under the breath of their builder, even if there are two\r\nhundred of them. Three months since it was M. de Saint-Méran; Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran two months since; the other day it was Barrois; today, the\r\nold Noirtier, or young Valentine.”\r\n\r\n“You knew it?” cried Morrel, in such a paroxysm of terror that Monte\r\nCristo started,—he whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved;\r\n“you knew it, and said nothing?”\r\n\r\n“And what is it to me?” replied Monte Cristo, shrugging his shoulders;\r\n“do I know those people? and must I lose the one to save the other?\r\nFaith, no, for between the culprit and the victim I have no choice.”\r\n\r\n“But I,” cried Morrel, groaning with sorrow, “I love her!”\r\n\r\n“You love?—whom?” cried Monte Cristo, starting to his feet, and seizing\r\nthe two hands which Morrel was raising towards heaven.\r\n\r\n“I love most fondly—I love madly—I love as a man who would give his\r\nlife-blood to spare her a tear—I love Valentine de Villefort, who is\r\nbeing murdered at this moment! Do you understand me? I love her; and I\r\nask God and you how I can save her?”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo uttered a cry which those only can conceive who have heard\r\nthe roar of a wounded lion. “Unhappy man,” cried he, wringing his hands\r\nin his turn; “you love Valentine,—that daughter of an accursed race!”\r\n\r\nNever had Morrel witnessed such an expression—never had so terrible an\r\neye flashed before his face—never had the genius of terror he had so\r\noften seen, either on the battle-field or in the murderous nights of\r\nAlgeria, shaken around him more dreadful fire. He drew back terrified.\r\n\r\nAs for Monte Cristo, after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if\r\ndazzled by internal light. In a moment he restrained himself so\r\npowerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided, as\r\nturbulent and foaming waves yield to the sun’s genial influence when\r\nthe cloud has passed. This silence, self-control, and struggle lasted\r\nabout twenty seconds, then the count raised his pallid face.\r\n\r\n“See,” said he, “my dear friend, how God punishes the most thoughtless\r\nand unfeeling men for their indifference, by presenting dreadful scenes\r\nto their view. I, who was looking on, an eager and curious\r\nspectator,—I, who was watching the working of this mournful tragedy,—I,\r\nwho like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed\r\nprotected by secrecy (a secret is easily kept by the rich and\r\npowerful), I am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course\r\nI was watching, and bitten to the heart!”\r\n\r\nMorrel groaned.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” continued the count, “complaints are unavailing, be a\r\nman, be strong, be full of hope, for I am here and will watch over\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nMorrel shook his head sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n“I tell you to hope. Do you understand me?” cried Monte Cristo.\r\n“Remember that I never uttered a falsehood and am never deceived. It is\r\ntwelve o’clock, Maximilian; thank heaven that you came at noon rather\r\nthan in the evening, or tomorrow morning. Listen, Morrel—it is noon; if\r\nValentine is not now dead, she will not die.”\r\n\r\n“How so?” cried Morrel, “when I left her dying?”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo pressed his hands to his forehead. What was passing in\r\nthat brain, so loaded with dreadful secrets? What does the angel of\r\nlight or the angel of darkness say to that mind, at once implacable and\r\ngenerous? God only knows.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo raised his head once more, and this time he was calm as a\r\nchild awaking from its sleep.\r\n\r\n“Maximilian,” said he, “return home. I command you not to stir—attempt\r\nnothing, not to let your countenance betray a thought, and I will send\r\nyou tidings. Go.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, count, you overwhelm me with that coolness. Have you, then, power\r\nagainst death? Are you superhuman? Are you an angel?” And the young\r\nman, who had never shrunk from danger, shrank before Monte Cristo with\r\nindescribable terror. But Monte Cristo looked at him with so melancholy\r\nand sweet a smile, that Maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I can do much for you, my friend,” replied the count. “Go; I must be\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\nMorrel, subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy Monte Cristo exercised\r\nover everything around him, did not endeavor to resist it. He pressed\r\nthe count’s hand and left. He stopped one moment at the door for\r\nBaptistin, whom he saw in the Rue Matignon, and who was running.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Villefort and d’Avrigny had made all possible haste,\r\nValentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival, and\r\nthe doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances\r\ndemanded, and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret\r\nintensified twofold. Villefort, closely watching his countenance and\r\nhis lips, awaited the result of the examination. Noirtier, paler than\r\neven the young girl, more eager than Villefort for the decision, was\r\nwatching also intently and affectionately.\r\n\r\nAt last d’Avrigny slowly uttered these words: “She is still alive!”\r\n\r\n“Still?” cried Villefort; “oh, doctor, what a dreadful word is that.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the physician, “I repeat it; she is still alive, and I am\r\nastonished at it.”\r\n\r\n“But is she safe?” asked the father.\r\n\r\n“Yes, since she lives.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment d’Avrigny’s glance met Noirtier’s eye. It glistened with\r\nsuch extraordinary joy, so rich and full of thought, that the physician\r\nwas struck. He placed the young girl again on the chair,—her lips were\r\nscarcely discernible, they were so pale and white, as well as her whole\r\nface,—and remained motionless, looking at Noirtier, who appeared to\r\nanticipate and commend all he did.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said d’Avrigny to Villefort, “call Mademoiselle Valentine’s\r\nmaid, if you please.”\r\n\r\nVillefort went himself to find her; and d’Avrigny approached Noirtier.\r\n\r\n“Have you something to tell me?” asked he. The old man winked his eyes\r\nexpressively, which we may remember was his only way of expressing his\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n“Privately?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will remain with you.” At this moment Villefort returned,\r\nfollowed by the lady’s maid; and after her came Madame de Villefort.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, then, with this dear child? she has just left me,\r\nand she complained of being indisposed, but I did not think seriously\r\nof it.”\r\n\r\nThe young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a\r\ntrue mother, approached Valentine and took her hand. D’Avrigny\r\ncontinued to look at Noirtier; he saw the eyes of the old man dilate\r\nand become round, his cheeks turn pale and tremble; the perspiration\r\nstood in drops upon his forehead.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said he, involuntarily following Noirtier’s eyes, which were\r\nfixed on Madame de Villefort, who repeated:\r\n\r\n“This poor child would be better in bed. Come, Fanny, we will put her\r\nto bed.”\r\n\r\nM. d’Avrigny, who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with\r\nNoirtier, expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could\r\nbe done; but he forbade that anything should be given to her except\r\nwhat he ordered.\r\n\r\nThey carried Valentine away; she had revived, but could scarcely move\r\nor speak, so shaken was her frame by the attack. She had, however, just\r\npower to give one parting look to her grandfather, who in losing her\r\nseemed to be resigning his very soul. D’Avrigny followed the invalid,\r\nwrote a prescription, ordered Villefort to take a cabriolet, go in\r\nperson to a chemist’s to get the prescribed medicine, bring it himself,\r\nand wait for him in his daughter’s room. Then, having renewed his\r\ninjunction not to give Valentine anything, he went down again to\r\nNoirtier, shut the doors carefully, and after convincing himself that\r\nno one was listening:\r\n\r\n“Do you,” said he, “know anything of this young lady’s illness?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the old man.\r\n\r\n“We have no time to lose; I will question, and do you answer me.”\r\nNoirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer. “Did you anticipate\r\nthe accident which has happened to your granddaughter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.” D’Avrigny reflected a moment; then approaching Noirtier:\r\n\r\n“Pardon what I am going to say,” added he, “but no indication should be\r\nneglected in this terrible situation. Did you see poor Barrois die?”\r\nNoirtier raised his eyes to heaven.\r\n\r\n“Do you know of what he died!” asked d’Avrigny, placing his hand on\r\nNoirtier’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the old man.\r\n\r\n“Do you think he died a natural death?” A sort of smile was discernible\r\non the motionless lips of Noirtier.\r\n\r\n“Then you have thought that Barrois was poisoned?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck Barrois has\r\nnow attacked Valentine?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then will she die too?” asked d’Avrigny, fixing his penetrating gaze\r\non Noirtier. He watched the effect of this question on the old man.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the\r\nmost clever diviner.\r\n\r\n“Then you hope?” said d’Avrigny, with surprise.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What do you hope?” The old man made him understand with his eyes that\r\nhe could not answer.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, it is true,” murmured d’Avrigny. Then, turning to\r\nNoirtier,—“Do you hope the assassin will be tried?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then you hope the poison will take no effect on Valentine?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“It is no news to you,” added d’Avrigny, “to tell you that an attempt\r\nhas been made to poison her?” The old man made a sign that he\r\nentertained no doubt upon the subject. “Then how do you hope Valentine\r\nwill escape?”\r\n\r\nNoirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot. D’Avrigny\r\nfollowed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle\r\ncontaining the mixture which he took every morning. “Ah, indeed?” said\r\nd’Avrigny, struck with a sudden thought, “has it occurred to\r\nyou”—Noirtier did not let him finish.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said he.\r\n\r\n“To prepare her system to resist poison?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“By accustoming her by degrees——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, yes,” said Noirtier, delighted to be understood.\r\n\r\n“Of course. I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I give\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And by accustoming her to that poison, you have endeavored to\r\nneutralize the effect of a similar poison?” Noirtier’s joy continued.\r\n“And you have succeeded,” exclaimed d’Avrigny. “Without that precaution\r\nValentine would have died before assistance could have been procured.\r\nThe dose has been excessive, but she has only been shaken by it; and\r\nthis time, at any rate, Valentine will not die.”\r\n\r\nA superhuman joy expanded the old man’s eyes, which were raised towards\r\nheaven with an expression of infinite gratitude. At this moment\r\nVillefort returned.\r\n\r\n“Here, doctor,” said he, “is what you sent me for.”\r\n\r\n“Was this prepared in your presence?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the procureur.\r\n\r\n“Have you not let it go out of your hands?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nD’Avrigny took the bottle, poured some drops of the mixture it\r\ncontained in the hollow of his hand, and swallowed them.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “let us go to Valentine; I will give instructions to\r\neveryone, and you, M. de Villefort, will yourself see that no one\r\ndeviates from them.”\r\n\r\n40294m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment when d’Avrigny was returning to Valentine’s room,\r\naccompanied by Villefort, an Italian priest, of serious demeanor and\r\ncalm and firm tone, hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of\r\nM. de Villefort. No one knew how the three former tenants of that house\r\nleft it. About two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be\r\nunsafe; but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing\r\nhimself there with his modest furniture the same day at five o’clock.\r\nThe lease was drawn up for three, six, or nine years by the new tenant,\r\nwho, according to the rule of the proprietor, paid six months in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nThis new tenant, who, as we have said, was an Italian, was called Il\r\nSignor Giacomo Busoni. Workmen were immediately called in, and that\r\nsame night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise\r\nthat carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of\r\nthe tottering house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 95. Father and Daughter\r\n\r\nWe saw in a preceding chapter how Madame Danglars went formally to\r\nannounce to Madame de Villefort the approaching marriage of Eugénie\r\nDanglars and M. Andrea Cavalcanti. This formal announcement, which\r\nimplied or appeared to imply, the approval of all the persons concerned\r\nin this momentous affair, had been preceded by a scene to which our\r\nreaders must be admitted. We beg them to take one step backward, and to\r\ntransport themselves, the morning of that day of great catastrophes,\r\ninto the showy, gilded salon we have before shown them, and which was\r\nthe pride of its owner, Baron Danglars.\r\n\r\nIn this room, at about ten o’clock in the morning, the banker himself\r\nhad been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in\r\nevident uneasiness, watching both doors, and listening to every sound.\r\nWhen his patience was exhausted, he called his valet.\r\n\r\n“Étienne,” said he, “see why Mademoiselle Eugénie has asked me to meet\r\nher in the drawing-room, and why she makes me wait so long.”\r\n\r\nHaving given this vent to his ill-humor, the baron became more calm;\r\nMademoiselle Danglars had that morning requested an interview with her\r\nfather, and had fixed on the gilded drawing-room as the spot. The\r\nsingularity of this step, and above all its formality, had not a little\r\nsurprised the banker, who had immediately obeyed his daughter by\r\nrepairing first to the drawing-room. Étienne soon returned from his\r\nerrand.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle’s lady’s maid says, sir, that mademoiselle is finishing\r\nher toilette, and will be here shortly.”\r\n\r\nDanglars nodded, to signify that he was satisfied. To the world and to\r\nhis servants Danglars assumed the character of the good-natured man and\r\nthe indulgent father. This was one of his parts in the popular comedy\r\nhe was performing,—a make-up he had adopted and which suited him about\r\nas well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors, who\r\nseen from one side, were the image of geniality, and from the other\r\nshowed lips drawn down in chronic ill-temper. Let us hasten to say that\r\nin private the genial side descended to the level of the other, so that\r\ngenerally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal\r\nhusband and domineering father.\r\n\r\n“Why the devil does that foolish girl, who pretends to wish to speak to\r\nme, not come into my study? and why on earth does she want to speak to\r\nme at all?”\r\n\r\nHe was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time,\r\nwhen the door opened and Eugénie appeared, attired in a figured black\r\nsatin dress, her hair dressed and gloves on, as if she were going to\r\nthe Italian Opera.\r\n\r\n“Well, Eugénie, what is it you want with me? and why in this solemn\r\ndrawing-room when the study is so comfortable?”\r\n\r\n“I quite understand why you ask, sir,” said Eugénie, making a sign that\r\nher father might be seated, “and in fact your two questions suggest\r\nfully the theme of our conversation. I will answer them both, and\r\ncontrary to the usual method, the last first, because it is the least\r\ndifficult. I have chosen the drawing-room, sir, as our place of\r\nmeeting, in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences\r\nof a banker’s study. Those gilded cashbooks, drawers locked like gates\r\nof fortresses, heaps of bank-bills, come from I know not where, and the\r\nquantities of letters from England, Holland, Spain, India, China, and\r\nPeru, have generally a strange influence on a father’s mind, and make\r\nhim forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more\r\nsacred than the good opinion of his correspondents. I have, therefore,\r\nchosen this drawing-room, where you see, smiling and happy in their\r\nmagnificent frames, your portrait, mine, my mother’s, and all sorts of\r\nrural landscapes and touching pastorals. I rely much on external\r\nimpressions; perhaps, with regard to you, they are immaterial, but I\r\nshould be no artist if I had not some fancies.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” replied M. Danglars, who had listened to all this preamble\r\nwith imperturbable coolness, but without understanding a word, since\r\nlike every man burdened with thoughts of the past, he was occupied with\r\nseeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker.\r\n\r\n“There is, then, the second point cleared up, or nearly so,” said\r\nEugénie, without the least confusion, and with that masculine\r\npointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language; “and you\r\nappear satisfied with the explanation. Now, let us return to the first.\r\nYou ask me why I have requested this interview; I will tell you in two\r\nwords, sir; I will not marry count Andrea Cavalcanti.”\r\n\r\nDanglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n40298m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, sir,” continued Eugénie, still quite calm; “you are\r\nastonished, I see; for since this little affair began, I have not\r\nmanifested the slightest opposition, and yet I am always sure, when the\r\nopportunity arrives, to oppose a determined and absolute will to people\r\nwho have not consulted me, and things which displease me. However, this\r\ntime, my tranquillity, or passiveness as philosophers say, proceeded\r\nfrom another source; it proceeded from a wish, like a submissive and\r\ndevoted daughter” (a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of\r\nthe young girl), “to practice obedience.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” replied Eugénie, “I have tried to the very last and now\r\nthat the moment has come, I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is\r\nimpossible.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Danglars, whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed\r\nwith the weight of this pitiless logic, marking evident premeditation\r\nand force of will, “what is your reason for this refusal, Eugénie? what\r\nreason do you assign?”\r\n\r\n“My reason?” replied the young girl. “Well, it is not that the man is\r\nmore ugly, more foolish, or more disagreeable than any other; no, M.\r\nAndrea Cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men’s faces and\r\nfigures as a very good specimen of his kind. It is not, either, that my\r\nheart is less touched by him than any other; that would be a\r\nschoolgirl’s reason, which I consider quite beneath me. I actually love\r\nno one, sir; you know it, do you not? I do not then see why, without\r\nreal necessity, I should encumber my life with a perpetual companion.\r\nHas not some sage said, ‘Nothing too much’? and another, ‘I carry all\r\nmy effects with me’? I have been taught these two aphorisms in Latin\r\nand in Greek; one is, I believe, from Phædrus, and the other from Bias.\r\nWell, my dear father, in the shipwreck of life—for life is an eternal\r\nshipwreck of our hopes—I cast into the sea my useless encumbrance, that\r\nis all, and I remain with my own will, disposed to live perfectly\r\nalone, and consequently perfectly free.”\r\n\r\n“Unhappy girl, unhappy girl!” murmured Danglars, turning pale, for he\r\nknew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so\r\nsuddenly encountered.\r\n\r\n“Unhappy girl,” replied Eugénie, “unhappy girl, do you say, sir? No,\r\nindeed; the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected. Happy,\r\non the contrary, for what am I in want of? The world calls me\r\nbeautiful. It is something to be well received. I like a favorable\r\nreception; it expands the countenance, and those around me do not then\r\nappear so ugly. I possess a share of wit, and a certain relative\r\nsensibility, which enables me to draw from life in general, for the\r\nsupport of mine, all I meet with that is good, like the monkey who\r\ncracks the nut to get at its contents. I am rich, for you have one of\r\nthe first fortunes in France. I am your only daughter, and you are not\r\nso exacting as the fathers of the Porte Saint-Martin and Gaîté, who\r\ndisinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren. Besides,\r\nthe provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me, at\r\nleast entirely, as it has also of the power to compel me to marry\r\nMonsieur This or Monsieur That. And so—being, beautiful, witty,\r\nsomewhat talented, as the comic operas say, and rich—and that is\r\nhappiness, sir—why do you call me unhappy?”\r\n\r\nDanglars, seeing his daughter smiling, and proud even to insolence,\r\ncould not entirely repress his brutal feelings, but they betrayed\r\nthemselves only by an exclamation. Under the fixed and inquiring gaze\r\nlevelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows, he prudently\r\nturned away, and calmed himself immediately, daunted by the power of a\r\nresolute mind.\r\n\r\n“Truly, my daughter,” replied he with a smile, “you are all you boast\r\nof being, excepting one thing; I will not too hastily tell you which,\r\nbut would rather leave you to guess it.”\r\n\r\nEugénie looked at Danglars, much surprised that one flower of her crown\r\nof pride, with which she had so superbly decked herself, should be\r\ndisputed.\r\n\r\n“My daughter,” continued the banker, “you have perfectly explained to\r\nme the sentiments which influence a girl like you, who is determined\r\nshe will not marry; now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a\r\nfather like me, who has decided that his daughter shall marry.”\r\n\r\nEugénie bowed, not as a submissive daughter, but as an adversary\r\nprepared for a discussion.\r\n\r\n“My daughter,” continued Danglars, “when a father asks his daughter to\r\nchoose a husband, he has always some reason for wishing her to marry.\r\nSome are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now, that of\r\nliving again in their grandchildren. This is not my weakness, I tell\r\nyou at once; family joys have no charm for me. I may acknowledge this\r\nto a daughter whom I know to be philosophical enough to understand my\r\nindifference, and not to impute it to me as a crime.”\r\n\r\n“This is not to the purpose,” said Eugénie; “let us speak candidly,\r\nsir; I admire candor.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Danglars, “I can, when circumstances render it desirable,\r\nadopt your system, although it may not be my general practice. I will\r\ntherefore proceed. I have proposed to you to marry, not for your sake,\r\nfor indeed I did not think of you in the least at the moment (you\r\nadmire candor, and will now be satisfied, I hope); but because it\r\nsuited me to marry you as soon as possible, on account of certain\r\ncommercial speculations I am desirous of entering into.” Eugénie became\r\nuneasy.\r\n\r\n40302m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is just as I tell you, I assure you, and you must not be angry with\r\nme, for you have sought this disclosure. I do not willingly enter into\r\narithmetical explanations with an artist like you, who fears to enter\r\nmy study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti-poetic impressions\r\nand sensations. But in that same banker’s study, where you very\r\nwillingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs I\r\ngive you monthly for pocket-money, you must know, my dear young lady,\r\nthat many things may be learned, useful even to a girl who will not\r\nmarry. There one may learn, for instance, what, out of regard to your\r\nnervous susceptibility, I will inform you of in the drawing-room,\r\nnamely, that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life;\r\nthat credit sustains him as breath animates the body; and M. de Monte\r\nCristo once gave me a lecture on that subject, which I have never\r\nforgotten. There we may learn that as credit sinks, the body becomes a\r\ncorpse, and this is what must happen very soon to the banker who is\r\nproud to own so good a logician as you for his daughter.”\r\n\r\nBut Eugénie, instead of stooping, drew herself up under the blow.\r\n“Ruined?” said she.\r\n\r\n“Exactly, my daughter; that is precisely what I mean,” said Danglars,\r\nalmost digging his nails into his breast, while he preserved on his\r\nharsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man;\r\n“ruined—yes, that is it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Eugénie.\r\n\r\n“Yes, ruined! Now it is revealed, this secret so full of horror, as the\r\ntragic poet says. Now, my daughter, learn from my lips how you may\r\nalleviate this misfortune, so far as it will affect you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried Eugénie, “you are a bad physiognomist, if you imagine I\r\ndeplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me. I\r\nruined? and what will that signify to me? Have I not my talent left?\r\nCan I not, like Pasta, Malibran, Grisi, acquire for myself what you\r\nwould never have given me, whatever might have been your fortune, a\r\nhundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum, for which I\r\nshall be indebted to no one but myself; and which, instead of being\r\ngiven as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs, with sour looks\r\nand reproaches for my prodigality, will be accompanied with\r\nacclamations, with bravos, and with flowers? And if I do not possess\r\nthat talent, which your smiles prove to me you doubt, should I not\r\nstill have that ardent love of independence, which will be a substitute\r\nfor wealth, and which in my mind supersedes even the instinct of\r\nself-preservation? No, I grieve not on my own account, I shall always\r\nfind a resource; my books, my pencils, my piano, all the things which\r\ncost but little, and which I shall be able to procure, will remain my\r\nown.\r\n\r\n“Do you think that I sorrow for Madame Danglars? Undeceive yourself\r\nagain; either I am greatly mistaken, or she has provided against the\r\ncatastrophe which threatens you, and, which will pass over without\r\naffecting her. She has taken care for herself,—at least I hope so,—for\r\nher attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over\r\nme. She has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love\r\nfor liberty. Oh, no, sir; from my childhood I have seen too much, and\r\nunderstood too much, of what has passed around me, for misfortune to\r\nhave an undue power over me. From my earliest recollections, I have\r\nbeen beloved by no one—so much the worse; that has naturally led me to\r\nlove no one—so much the better—now you have my profession of faith.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Danglars, pale with anger, which was not at all due to\r\noffended paternal love,—“then, mademoiselle, you persist in your\r\ndetermination to accelerate my ruin?”\r\n\r\n“Your ruin? I accelerate your ruin? What do you mean? I do not\r\nunderstand you.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better, I have a ray of hope left; listen.”\r\n\r\n“I am all attention,” said Eugénie, looking so earnestly at her father\r\nthat it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze.\r\n\r\n“M. Cavalcanti,” continued Danglars, “is about to marry you, and will\r\nplace in my hands his fortune, amounting to three million livres.”\r\n\r\n“That is admirable!” said Eugénie with sovereign contempt, smoothing\r\nher gloves out one upon the other.\r\n\r\n“You think I shall deprive you of those three millions,” said Danglars;\r\n“but do not fear it. They are destined to produce at least ten. I and a\r\nbrother banker have obtained a grant of a railway, the only industrial\r\nenterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous\r\nprospects that Law once held out to the eternally deluded Parisians, in\r\nthe fantastic Mississippi scheme. As I look at it, a millionth part of\r\na railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks\r\nof the Ohio. We make in our case a deposit, on a mortgage, which is an\r\nadvance, as you see, since we gain at least ten, fifteen, twenty, or a\r\nhundred livres’ worth of iron in exchange for our money. Well, within a\r\nweek I am to deposit four millions for my share; the four millions, I\r\npromise you, will produce ten or twelve.”\r\n\r\n“But during my visit to you the day before yesterday, sir, which you\r\nappear to recollect so well,” replied Eugénie, “I saw you arranging a\r\ndeposit—is not that the term?—of five millions and a half; you even\r\npointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury, and you were\r\nastonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like\r\nlightning.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but those five millions and a half are not mine, and are only a\r\nproof of the great confidence placed in me; my title of popular banker\r\nhas gained me the confidence of charitable institutions, and the five\r\nmillions and a half belong to them; at any other time I should not have\r\nhesitated to make use of them, but the great losses I have recently\r\nsustained are well known, and, as I told you, my credit is rather\r\nshaken. That deposit may be at any moment withdrawn, and if I had\r\nemployed it for another purpose, I should bring on me a disgraceful\r\nbankruptcy. I do not despise bankruptcies, believe me, but they must be\r\nthose which enrich, not those which ruin. Now, if you marry M.\r\nCavalcanti, and I get the three millions, or even if it is thought I am\r\ngoing to get them, my credit will be restored, and my fortune, which\r\nfor the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have\r\nbeen opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality, will revive. Do\r\nyou understand me?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly; you pledge me for three millions, do you not?”\r\n\r\n“The greater the amount, the more flattering it is to you; it gives you\r\nan idea of your value.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. One word more, sir; do you promise me to make what use you\r\ncan of the report of the fortune M. Cavalcanti will bring without\r\ntouching the money? This is no act of selfishness, but of delicacy. I\r\nam willing to help rebuild your fortune, but I will not be an\r\naccomplice in the ruin of others.”\r\n\r\n“But since I tell you,” cried Danglars, “that with these three\r\nmillion——”\r\n\r\n“Do you expect to recover your position, sir, without touching those\r\nthree million?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so, if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit.”\r\n\r\n“Shall you be able to pay M. Cavalcanti the five hundred thousand\r\nfrancs you promise for my dowry?”\r\n\r\n“He shall receive them on returning from the mayor’s20.”\r\n\r\n“Very well!”\r\n\r\n“What next? what more do you want?”\r\n\r\n“I wish to know if, in demanding my signature, you leave me entirely\r\nfree in my person?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely.”\r\n\r\n“Then, as I said before, sir,—very well; I am ready to marry M.\r\nCavalcanti.”\r\n\r\n“But what are you up to?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that is my affair. What advantage should I have over you, if\r\nknowing your secret I were to tell you mine?”\r\n\r\nDanglars bit his lips. “Then,” said he, “you are ready to pay the\r\nofficial visits, which are absolutely indispensable?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Eugénie.\r\n\r\n“And to sign the contract in three days?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then, in my turn, I also say, very well!”\r\n\r\nDanglars pressed his daughter’s hand in his. But, extraordinary to\r\nrelate, the father did not say, “Thank you, my child,” nor did the\r\ndaughter smile at her father.\r\n\r\n“Is the conference ended?” asked Eugénie, rising.\r\n\r\nDanglars motioned that he had nothing more to say. Five minutes\r\nafterwards the piano resounded to the touch of Mademoiselle d’Armilly’s\r\nfingers, and Mademoiselle Danglars was singing Brabantio’s malediction\r\non Desdemona. At the end of the piece Étienne entered, and announced to\r\nEugénie that the horses were to the carriage, and that the baroness was\r\nwaiting for her to pay her visits. We have seen them at Villefort’s;\r\nthey proceeded then on their course.\r\n\r\n40306m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME FIVE\r\n\r\n50009m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50011m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50019m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 96. The Contract\r\n\r\nThree days after the scene we have just described, namely towards five\r\no’clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the\r\ncontract between Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars and Andrea Cavalcanti,\r\nwhom the banker persisted in calling prince, a fresh breeze was\r\nstirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the Count of Monte\r\nCristo’s house, and the count was preparing to go out. While his horses\r\nwere impatiently pawing the ground, held in by the coachman, who had\r\nbeen seated a quarter of an hour on his box, the elegant phaeton with\r\nwhich we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrance-gate,\r\nand cast out on the doorsteps M. Andrea Cavalcanti, as decked up and\r\ngay as if he were going to marry a princess.\r\n\r\nHe inquired after the count with his usual familiarity, and ascending\r\nlightly to the first story met him at the top of the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe count stopped on seeing the young man. As for Andrea, he was\r\nlaunched, and when he was once launched nothing stopped him.\r\n\r\n“Ah, good morning, my dear count,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Ah, M. Andrea,” said the latter, with his half-jesting tone; “how do\r\nyou do?”\r\n\r\n“Charmingly, as you see. I am come to talk to you about a thousand\r\nthings; but, first tell me, were you going out or just returned?”\r\n\r\n“I was going out, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Then, in order not to hinder you, I will get up with you if you please\r\nin your carriage, and Tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the count, with an imperceptible smile of contempt, for he\r\nhad no wish to be seen in the young man’s society,—“no; I prefer\r\nlistening to you here, my dear M. Andrea; we can chat better in-doors,\r\nand there is no coachman to overhear our conversation.”\r\n\r\nThe count returned to a small drawing-room on the first floor, sat\r\ndown, and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat\r\nalso. Andrea assumed his gayest manner.\r\n\r\n“You know, my dear count,” said he, “the ceremony is to take place this\r\nevening. At nine o’clock the contract is to be signed at my\r\nfather-in-law’s.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“What; is it news to you? Has not M. Danglars informed you of the\r\nceremony?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said the count; “I received a letter from him yesterday, but\r\nI do not think the hour was mentioned.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly my father-in-law trusted to its general notoriety.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Monte Cristo, “you are fortunate, M. Cavalcanti; it is a\r\nmost suitable alliance you are contracting, and Mademoiselle Danglars\r\nis a handsome girl.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed she is,” replied Cavalcanti, in a very modest tone.\r\n\r\n“Above all, she is very rich,—at least, I believe so,” said Monte\r\nCristo.\r\n\r\n“Very rich, do you think?” replied the young man.\r\n\r\n“Doubtless; it is said M. Danglars conceals at least half of his\r\nfortune.”\r\n\r\n“And he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions,” said Andrea with a\r\nlook sparkling with joy.\r\n\r\n“Without reckoning,” added Monte Cristo, “that he is on the eve of\r\nentering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the United\r\nStates and in England, but quite novel in France.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I know what you mean,—the railway, of which he has obtained\r\nthe grant, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely; it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that\r\naffair.”\r\n\r\n“Ten millions! Do you think so? It is magnificent!” said Cavalcanti,\r\nwho was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words.\r\n\r\n“Without reckoning,” replied Monte Cristo, “that all his fortune will\r\ncome to you, and justly too, since Mademoiselle Danglars is an only\r\ndaughter. Besides, your own fortune, as your father assured me, is\r\nalmost equal to that of your betrothed. But enough of money matters. Do\r\nyou know, M. Andrea, I think you have managed this affair rather\r\nskilfully?”\r\n\r\n“Not badly, by any means,” said the young man; “I was born for a\r\ndiplomatist.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you must become a diplomatist; diplomacy, you know, is something\r\nthat is not to be acquired; it is instinctive. Have you lost your\r\nheart?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I fear it,” replied Andrea, in the tone in which he had heard\r\nDorante or Valère reply to Alceste21 at the Théâtre Français.\r\n\r\n“Is your love returned?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” said Andrea with a triumphant smile, “since I am\r\naccepted. But I must not forget one grand point.”\r\n\r\n“Which?”\r\n\r\n“That I have been singularly assisted.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense.”\r\n\r\n“I have, indeed.”\r\n\r\n“By circumstances?”\r\n\r\n“No; by you.”\r\n\r\n“By me? Not at all, prince,” said Monte Cristo laying a marked stress\r\non the title, “what have I done for you? Are not your name, your social\r\nposition, and your merit sufficient?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Andrea,—“no; it is useless for you to say so, count. I\r\nmaintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my\r\nname, my social position, and my merit.”\r\n\r\n“You are completely mistaken, sir,” said Monte Cristo coldly, who felt\r\nthe perfidious manœuvre of the young man, and understood the bearing of\r\nhis words; “you only acquired my protection after the influence and\r\nfortune of your father had been ascertained; for, after all, who\r\nprocured for me, who had never seen either you or your illustrious\r\nfather, the pleasure of your acquaintance?—two of my good friends, Lord\r\nWilmore and the Abbé Busoni. What encouraged me not to become your\r\nsurety, but to patronize you?—your father’s name, so well known in\r\nItaly and so highly honored. Personally, I do not know you.”\r\n\r\nThis calm tone and perfect ease made Andrea feel that he was, for the\r\nmoment, restrained by a more muscular hand than his own, and that the\r\nrestraint could not be easily broken through.\r\n\r\n“Oh, then my father has really a very large fortune, count?”\r\n\r\n“It appears so, sir,” replied Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come?”\r\n\r\n“I have been advised of it.”\r\n\r\n“But the three millions?”\r\n\r\n“The three millions are probably on the road.”\r\n\r\n“Then I shall really have them?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well,” said the count, “I do not think you have yet known the want\r\nof money.”\r\n\r\nAndrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment. Then,\r\narousing from his reverie:\r\n\r\n“Now, sir, I have one request to make to you, which you will\r\nunderstand, even if it should be disagreeable to you.”\r\n\r\n“Proceed,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“I have formed an acquaintance, thanks to my good fortune, with many\r\nnoted persons, and have, at least for the moment, a crowd of friends.\r\nBut marrying, as I am about to do, before all Paris, I ought to be\r\nsupported by an illustrious name, and in the absence of the paternal\r\nhand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar; now, my father is\r\nnot coming to Paris, is he?”\r\n\r\n“He is old, covered with wounds, and suffers dreadfully, he says, in\r\ntravelling.”\r\n\r\n“I understand; well, I am come to ask a favor of you.”\r\n\r\n“Of me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of you.”\r\n\r\n“And pray what may it be?”\r\n\r\n“Well, to take his part.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear sir! What?—after the varied relations I have had the\r\nhappiness to sustain towards you, can it be that you know me so little\r\nas to ask such a thing? Ask me to lend you half a million and, although\r\nsuch a loan is somewhat rare, on my honor, you would annoy me less!\r\nKnow, then, what I thought I had already told you, that in\r\nparticipation in this world’s affairs, more especially in their moral\r\naspects, the Count of Monte Cristo has never ceased to entertain the\r\nscruples and even the superstitions of the East. I, who have a seraglio\r\nat Cairo, one at Smyrna, and one at Constantinople, preside at a\r\nwedding?—never!”\r\n\r\n“Then you refuse me?”\r\n\r\n“Decidedly; and were you my son or my brother I would refuse you in the\r\nsame way.”\r\n\r\n“But what must be done?” said Andrea, disappointed.\r\n\r\n“You said just now that you had a hundred friends.”\r\n\r\n“Very true, but you introduced me at M. Danglars’.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all! Let us recall the exact facts. You met him at a dinner\r\nparty at my house, and you introduced yourself at his house; that is a\r\ntotally different affair.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but, by my marriage, you have forwarded that.”\r\n\r\n“I?—not in the least, I beg you to believe. Recollect what I told you\r\nwhen you asked me to propose you. ‘Oh, I never make matches, my dear\r\nprince, it is my settled principle.’” Andrea bit his lips.\r\n\r\n50025m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“But, at least, you will be there?”\r\n\r\n“Will all Paris be there?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, like all Paris, I shall be there too,” said the count.\r\n\r\n“And will you sign the contract?”\r\n\r\n“I see no objection to that; my scruples do not go thus far.”\r\n\r\n“Well, since you will grant me no more, I must be content with what you\r\ngive me. But one word more, count.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Advice.”\r\n\r\n“Be careful; advice is worse than a service.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you can give me this without compromising yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me what it is.”\r\n\r\n“Is my wife’s fortune five hundred thousand livres?”\r\n\r\n“That is the sum M. Danglars himself announced.”\r\n\r\n“Must I receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?”\r\n\r\n“This is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished\r\nto do them stylishly: Your two solicitors appoint a meeting, when the\r\ncontract is signed, for the next or the following day; then they\r\nexchange the two portions, for which they each give a receipt; then,\r\nwhen the marriage is celebrated, they place the amount at your disposal\r\nas the chief member of the alliance.”\r\n\r\n“Because,” said Andrea, with a certain ill-concealed uneasiness, “I\r\nthought I heard my father-in-law say that he intended embarking our\r\nproperty in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Monte Cristo, “it will be the way, everybody says, of\r\ntrebling your fortune in twelve months. Baron Danglars is a good\r\nfather, and knows how to calculate.”\r\n\r\n“In that case,” said Andrea, “everything is all right, excepting your\r\nrefusal, which quite grieves me.”\r\n\r\n“You must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar\r\ncircumstances.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Andrea, “let it be as you wish. This evening, then, at\r\nnine o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Adieu till then.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of Monte Cristo, whose\r\nlips turned pale, but who preserved his ceremonious smile, Andrea\r\nseized the count’s hand, pressed it, jumped into his phaeton, and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe four or five remaining hours before nine o’clock arrived, Andrea\r\nemployed in riding, paying visits,—designed to induce those of whom he\r\nhad spoken to appear at the banker’s in their gayest\r\nequipages,—dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have\r\nsince turned every brain, and in which Danglars was just taking the\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\nIn fact, at half-past eight in the evening the grand salon, the gallery\r\nadjoining, and the three other drawing-rooms on the same floor, were\r\nfilled with a perfumed crowd, who sympathized but little in the event,\r\nbut who all participated in that love of being present wherever there\r\nis anything fresh to be seen. An Academician would say that the\r\nentertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers\r\nwhich attract inconstant butterflies, famished bees, and buzzing\r\ndrones.\r\n\r\n50025m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated; the light\r\nstreamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings; and all the\r\nbad taste of decorations, which had only their richness to boast of,\r\nshone in its splendor. Mademoiselle Eugénie was dressed with elegant\r\nsimplicity in a figured white silk dress, and a white rose half\r\nconcealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament, unaccompanied by\r\na single jewel. Her eyes, however, betrayed that perfect confidence\r\nwhich contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire.\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars was chatting at a short distance with Debray,\r\nBeauchamp, and Château-Renaud. Debray was admitted to the house for\r\nthis grand ceremony, but on the same plane with everyone else, and\r\nwithout any particular privilege. M. Danglars, surrounded by deputies\r\nand men connected with the revenue, was explaining a new theory of\r\ntaxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had\r\ncompelled the government to call him into the ministry. Andrea, on\r\nwhose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the Opera, was\r\nexplaining to him rather cleverly, since he was obliged to be bold to\r\nappear at ease, his future projects, and the new luxuries he meant to\r\nintroduce to Parisian fashions with his hundred and seventy-five\r\nthousand livres per annum.\r\n\r\nThe crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of\r\nturquoises, rubies, emeralds, opals, and diamonds. As usual, the oldest\r\nwomen were the most decorated, and the ugliest the most conspicuous. If\r\nthere was a beautiful lily, or a sweet rose, you had to search for it,\r\nconcealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban, or an aunt with\r\na bird-of-paradise.\r\n\r\nAt each moment, in the midst of the crowd, the buzzing, and the\r\nlaughter, the door-keeper’s voice was heard announcing some name well\r\nknown in the financial department, respected in the army, or\r\nillustrious in the literary world, and which was acknowledged by a\r\nslight movement in the different groups. But for one whose privilege it\r\nwas to agitate that ocean of human waves, how many were received with a\r\nlook of indifference or a sneer of disdain!\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the hand of the massive time-piece, representing\r\nEndymion asleep, pointed to nine on its golden face, and the hammer,\r\nthe faithful type of mechanical thought, struck nine times, the name of\r\nthe Count of Monte Cristo resounded in its turn, and as if by an\r\nelectric shock all the assembly turned towards the door. The count was\r\ndressed in black and with his habitual simplicity; his white waistcoat\r\ndisplayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly\r\nnoticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his\r\nface. His only jewellery was a chain, so fine that the slender gold\r\nthread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat.\r\n\r\nA circle was immediately formed around the door. The count perceived at\r\none glance Madame Danglars at one end of the drawing-room, M. Danglars\r\nat the other, and Eugénie in front of him. He first advanced towards\r\nthe baroness, who was chatting with Madame de Villefort, who had come\r\nalone, Valentine being still an invalid; and without turning aside, so\r\nclear was the road left for him, he passed from the baroness to\r\nEugénie, whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms, that\r\nthe proud artist was quite struck. Near her was Mademoiselle Louise\r\nd’Armilly, who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had\r\nso kindly given her for Italy, which she intended immediately to make\r\nuse of. On leaving these ladies he found himself with Danglars, who had\r\nadvanced to meet him.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished these three social duties, Monte Cristo stopped,\r\nlooking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class,\r\nwhich seems to say, “I have done my duty, now let others do theirs.”\r\n\r\nAndrea, who was in an adjoining room, had shared in the sensation\r\ncaused by the arrival of Monte Cristo, and now came forward to pay his\r\nrespects to the count. He found him completely surrounded; all were\r\neager to speak to him, as is always the case with those whose words are\r\nfew and weighty. The solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged\r\ntheir scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which\r\ncovered the table prepared for the signature; it was a gilt table\r\nsupported on lions’ claws. One of the notaries sat down, the other\r\nremained standing. They were about to proceed to the reading of the\r\ncontract, which half Paris assembled was to sign. All took their\r\nplaces, or rather the ladies formed a circle, while the gentlemen (more\r\nindifferent to the restraints of what Boileau calls the _style\r\nénergique_) commented on the feverish agitation of Andrea, on M.\r\nDanglars’ riveted attention, Eugénie’s composure, and the light and\r\nsprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important affair.\r\n\r\nThe contract was read during a profound silence. But as soon as it was\r\nfinished, the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing-rooms; the\r\nbrilliant sums, the rolling millions which were to be at the command of\r\nthe two young people, and which crowned the display of the wedding\r\npresents and the young lady’s diamonds, which had been made in a room\r\nentirely appropriated for that purpose, had exercised to the full their\r\ndelusions over the envious assembly.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Danglars’ charms were heightened in the opinion of the\r\nyoung men, and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor. As\r\nfor the ladies, it is needless to say that while they coveted the\r\nmillions, they thought they did not need them for themselves, as they\r\nwere beautiful enough without them. Andrea, surrounded by his friends,\r\ncomplimented, flattered, beginning to believe in the reality of his\r\ndream, was almost bewildered. The notary solemnly took the pen,\r\nflourished it above his head, and said:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, we are about to sign the contract.”\r\n\r\nThe baron was to sign first, then the representative of M. Cavalcanti,\r\nsenior, then the baroness, afterwards the “future couple,” as they are\r\nstyled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents.\r\n\r\nThe baron took the pen and signed, then the representative. The\r\nbaroness approached, leaning on Madame de Villefort’s arm.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said she, as she took the pen, “is it not vexatious? An\r\nunexpected incident, in the affair of murder and theft at the Count of\r\nMonte Cristo’s, in which he nearly fell a victim, deprives us of the\r\npleasure of seeing M. de Villefort.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said M. Danglars, in the same tone in which he would have\r\nsaid, “Oh, well, what do I care?”\r\n\r\n“As a matter of fact,” said Monte Cristo, approaching, “I am much\r\nafraid that I am the involuntary cause of his absence.”\r\n\r\n“What, you, count?” said Madame Danglars, signing; “if you are, take\r\ncare, for I shall never forgive you.”\r\n\r\nAndrea pricked up his ears.\r\n\r\n“But it is not my fault, as I shall endeavor to prove.”\r\n\r\nEveryone listened eagerly; Monte Cristo who so rarely opened his lips,\r\nwas about to speak.\r\n\r\n“You remember,” said the count, during the most profound silence, “that\r\nthe unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house; the supposition\r\nis that he was stabbed by his accomplice, on attempting to leave it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Danglars.\r\n\r\n“In order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed, and his\r\nclothes were thrown into a corner, where the police picked them up,\r\nwith the exception of the waistcoat, which they overlooked.”\r\n\r\nAndrea turned pale, and drew towards the door; he saw a cloud rising in\r\nthe horizon, which appeared to forebode a coming storm.\r\n\r\n“Well, this waistcoat was discovered today, covered with blood, and\r\nwith a hole over the heart.” The ladies screamed, and two or three\r\nprepared to faint. “It was brought to me. No one could guess what the\r\ndirty rag could be; I alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the\r\nmurdered man. My valet, in examining this mournful relic, felt a paper\r\nin the pocket and drew it out; it was a letter addressed to you,\r\nbaron.”\r\n\r\n“To me?” cried Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, to you; I succeeded in deciphering your name under the\r\nblood with which the letter was stained,” replied Monte Cristo, amid\r\nthe general outburst of amazement.\r\n\r\n“But,” asked Madame Danglars, looking at her husband with uneasiness,\r\n“how could that prevent M. de Villefort——”\r\n\r\n“In this simple way, madame,” replied Monte Cristo; “the waistcoat and\r\nthe letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence; I\r\ntherefore sent them to the king’s attorney. You understand, my dear\r\nbaron, that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases; it was,\r\nperhaps, some plot against you.” Andrea looked steadily at Monte Cristo\r\nand disappeared in the second drawing-room.\r\n\r\n“Possibly,” said Danglars; “was not this murdered man an old\r\ngalley-slave?”\r\n\r\n50025m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the count; “a felon named Caderousse.” Danglars turned\r\nslightly pale; Andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n“But go on signing,” said Monte Cristo; “I perceive that my story has\r\ncaused a general emotion, and I beg to apologize to you, baroness, and\r\nto Mademoiselle Danglars.”\r\n\r\nThe baroness, who had signed, returned the pen to the notary.\r\n\r\n“Prince Cavalcanti,” said the latter; “Prince Cavalcanti, where are\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Andrea, Andrea,” repeated several young people, who were already on\r\nsufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his Christian name.\r\n\r\n“Call the prince; inform him that it is his turn to sign,” cried\r\nDanglars to one of the floorkeepers.\r\n\r\nBut at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the\r\nprincipal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the\r\napartments, _quærens quem devoret_. There was, indeed, reason to\r\nretreat, to be alarmed, and to scream. An officer was placing two\r\nsoldiers at the door of each drawing-room, and was advancing towards\r\nDanglars, preceded by a commissary of police, girded with his scarf.\r\nMadame Danglars uttered a scream and fainted. Danglars, who thought\r\nhimself threatened (certain consciences are never calm),—Danglars even\r\nbefore his guests showed a countenance of abject terror.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, sir?” asked Monte Cristo, advancing to meet the\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\n“Which of you gentlemen,” asked the magistrate, without replying to the\r\ncount, “answers to the name of Andrea Cavalcanti?”\r\n\r\nA cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room. They\r\nsearched; they questioned.\r\n\r\n“But who then is Andrea Cavalcanti?” asked Danglars in amazement.\r\n\r\n“A galley-slave, escaped from confinement at Toulon.”\r\n\r\n“And what crime has he committed?”\r\n\r\n“He is accused,” said the commissary with his inflexible voice, “of\r\nhaving assassinated the man named Caderousse, his former companion in\r\nprison, at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the\r\nCount of Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo cast a rapid glance around him. Andrea was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 97. The Departure for Belgium\r\n\r\nA few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of M.\r\nDanglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers, and\r\nby the disclosure which had followed, the mansion was deserted with as\r\nmuch rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken\r\nout among the guests.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes, through all the doors, down all the staircases, by\r\nevery exit, everyone hastened to retire, or rather to fly; for it was a\r\nsituation where the ordinary condolences,—which even the best friends\r\nare so eager to offer in great catastrophes,—were seen to be utterly\r\nfutile. There remained in the banker’s house only Danglars, closeted in\r\nhis study, and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes; Madame\r\nDanglars, terrified, in the boudoir with which we are acquainted; and\r\nEugénie, who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her\r\nroom with her inseparable companion, Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly.\r\n\r\nAs for the numerous servants (more numerous that evening than usual,\r\nfor their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the Café de\r\nParis), venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the\r\ninsult to which they had been subjected, they collected in groups in\r\nthe hall, in the kitchens, or in their rooms, thinking very little of\r\ntheir duty, which was thus naturally interrupted. Of all this\r\nhousehold, only two persons deserve our notice; these are Mademoiselle\r\nEugénie Danglars and Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly.\r\n\r\nThe betrothed had retired, as we said, with haughty air, disdainful\r\nlip, and the demeanor of an outraged queen, followed by her companion,\r\nwho was paler and more disturbed than herself. On reaching her room\r\nEugénie locked her door, while Louise fell on a chair.\r\n\r\n“Ah, what a dreadful thing,” said the young musician; “who would have\r\nsuspected it? M. Andrea Cavalcanti a murderer—a galley-slave escaped—a\r\nconvict!”\r\n\r\nAn ironical smile curled the lip of Eugénie. “In truth, I was fated,”\r\nsaid she. “I escaped the Morcerf only to fall into the Cavalcanti.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, do not confound the two, Eugénie.”\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue! The men are all infamous, and I am happy to be able\r\nnow to do more than detest them—I despise them.”\r\n\r\n“What shall we do?” asked Louise.\r\n\r\n“What shall we do?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Why, the same we had intended doing three days since—set off.”\r\n\r\n“What?—although you are not now going to be married, you intend\r\nstill——”\r\n\r\n“Listen, Louise. I hate this life of the fashionable world, always\r\nordered, measured, ruled, like our music-paper. What I have always\r\nwished for, desired, and coveted, is the life of an artist, free and\r\nindependent, relying only on my own resources, and accountable only to\r\nmyself. Remain here? What for?—that they may try, a month hence, to\r\nmarry me again; and to whom?—M. Debray, perhaps, as it was once\r\nproposed. No, Louise, no! This evening’s adventure will serve for my\r\nexcuse. I did not seek one, I did not ask for one. God sends me this,\r\nand I hail it joyfully!”\r\n\r\n“How strong and courageous you are!” said the fair, frail girl to her\r\nbrunette companion.\r\n\r\n“Did you not yet know me? Come, Louise, let us talk of our affairs. The\r\npost-chaise——”\r\n\r\n“Was happily bought three days since.”\r\n\r\n“Have you had it sent where we are to go for it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Our passport?”\r\n\r\n“Here it is.”\r\n\r\nAnd Eugénie, with her usual precision, opened a printed paper, and\r\nread:\r\n\r\n“M. Léon d’Armilly, twenty years of age; profession, artist; hair\r\nblack, eyes black; travelling with his sister.”\r\n\r\n“Capital! How did you get this passport?”\r\n\r\n“When I went to ask M. de Monte Cristo for letters to the directors of\r\nthe theatres at Rome and Naples, I expressed my fears of travelling as\r\na woman; he perfectly understood them, and undertook to procure for me\r\na man’s passport, and two days after I received this, to which I have\r\nadded with my own hand, ‘travelling with his sister.’”\r\n\r\n50035m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Eugénie cheerfully, “we have then only to pack up our\r\ntrunks; we shall start the evening of the signing of the contract,\r\ninstead of the evening of the wedding—that is all.”\r\n\r\n“But consider the matter seriously, Eugénie!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am done with considering! I am tired of hearing only of market\r\nreports, of the end of the month, of the rise and fall of Spanish\r\nfunds, of Haitian bonds. Instead of that, Louise—do you\r\nunderstand?—air, liberty, melody of birds, plains of Lombardy, Venetian\r\ncanals, Roman palaces, the Bay of Naples. How much have we, Louise?”\r\n\r\nThe young girl to whom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid\r\nsecretaire a small portfolio with a lock, in which she counted\r\ntwenty-three bank-notes.\r\n\r\n“Twenty-three thousand francs,” said she.\r\n\r\n“And as much, at least, in pearls, diamonds, and jewels,” said Eugénie.\r\n“We are rich. With forty-five thousand francs we can live like\r\nprincesses for two years, and comfortably for four; but before six\r\nmonths—you with your music, and I with my voice—we shall double our\r\ncapital. Come, you shall take charge of the money, I of the jewel-box;\r\nso that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure, the other\r\nwould still have hers left. Now, the portmanteau—let us make haste—the\r\nportmanteau!”\r\n\r\n“Stop!” said Louise, going to listen at Madame Danglars’ door.\r\n\r\n“What do you fear?”\r\n\r\n“That we may be discovered.”\r\n\r\n“The door is locked.”\r\n\r\n“They may tell us to open it.”\r\n\r\n“They may if they like, but we will not.”\r\n\r\n“You are a perfect Amazon, Eugénie!” And the two young girls began to\r\nheap into a trunk all the things they thought they should require.\r\n\r\n“There now,” said Eugénie, “while I change my costume do you lock the\r\nportmanteau.” Louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands\r\non the top of the portmanteau.\r\n\r\n“But I cannot,” said she; “I am not strong enough; do you shut it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you do well to ask,” said Eugénie, laughing; “I forgot that I was\r\nHercules, and you only the pale Omphale!”\r\n\r\nAnd the young girl, kneeling on the top, pressed the two parts of the\r\nportmanteau together, and Mademoiselle d’Armilly passed the bolt of the\r\npadlock through. When this was done, Eugénie opened a drawer, of which\r\nshe kept the key, and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling\r\ncloak.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said she, “you see I have thought of everything; with this\r\ncloak you will not be cold.”\r\n\r\n“But you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am never cold, you know! Besides, with these men’s clothes——”\r\n\r\n“Will you dress here?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Shall you have time?”\r\n\r\n“Do not be uneasy, you little coward! All our servants are busy,\r\ndiscussing the grand affair. Besides, what is there astonishing, when\r\nyou think of the grief I ought to be in, that I shut myself up?—tell\r\nme!”\r\n\r\n“No, truly—you comfort me.”\r\n\r\n“Come and help me.”\r\n\r\nFrom the same drawer she took a man’s complete costume, from the boots\r\nto the coat, and a provision of linen, where there was nothing\r\nsuperfluous, but every requisite. Then, with a promptitude which\r\nindicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by\r\nadopting the garb of the opposite sex, Eugénie drew on the boots and\r\npantaloons, tied her cravat, buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat,\r\nand put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that is very good—indeed, it is very good!” said Louise, looking\r\nat her with admiration; “but that beautiful black hair, those\r\nmagnificent braids, which made all the ladies sigh with envy,—will they\r\ngo under a man’s hat like the one I see down there?”\r\n\r\n“You shall see,” said Eugénie. And with her left hand seizing the thick\r\nmass, which her long fingers could scarcely grasp, she took in her\r\nright hand a pair of long scissors, and soon the steel met through the\r\nrich and splendid hair, which fell in a cluster at her feet as she\r\nleaned back to keep it from her coat. Then she grasped the front hair,\r\nwhich she also cut off, without expressing the least regret; on the\r\ncontrary, her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her\r\nebony eyebrows.\r\n\r\n50039m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, the magnificent hair!” said Louise, with regret.\r\n\r\n“And am I not a hundred times better thus?” cried Eugénie, smoothing\r\nthe scattered curls of her hair, which had now quite a masculine\r\nappearance; “and do you not think me handsomer so?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are beautiful—always beautiful!” cried Louise. “Now, where are\r\nyou going?”\r\n\r\n“To Brussels, if you like; it is the nearest frontier. We can go to\r\nBrussels, Liège, Aix-la-Chapelle; then up the Rhine to Strasbourg. We\r\nwill cross Switzerland, and go down into Italy by the Saint-Gothard.\r\nWill that do?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What are you looking at?”\r\n\r\n“I am looking at you; indeed you are adorable like that! One would say\r\nyou were carrying me off.”\r\n\r\n“And they would be right, _pardieu!_”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I think you swore, Eugénie.”\r\n\r\nAnd the two young girls, whom everyone might have thought plunged in\r\ngrief, the one on her own account, the other from interest in her\r\nfriend, burst out laughing, as they cleared away every visible trace of\r\nthe disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their\r\nescape. Then, having blown out the lights, the two fugitives, looking\r\nand listening eagerly, with outstretched necks, opened the door of a\r\ndressing-room which led by a side staircase down to the yard,—Eugénie\r\ngoing first, and holding with one arm the portmanteau, which by the\r\nopposite handle Mademoiselle d’Armilly scarcely raised with both hands.\r\nThe yard was empty; the clock was striking twelve. The porter was not\r\nyet gone to bed. Eugénie approached softly, and saw the old man\r\nsleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge. She returned to Louise,\r\ntook up the portmanteau, which she had placed for a moment on the\r\nground, and they reached the archway under the shadow of the wall.\r\n\r\nEugénie concealed Louise in an angle of the gateway, so that if the\r\nporter chanced to awake he might see but one person. Then placing\r\nherself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard:\r\n\r\n“Gate!” cried she, with her finest contralto voice, and rapping at the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nThe porter got up as Eugénie expected, and even advanced some steps to\r\nrecognize the person who was going out, but seeing a young man striking\r\nhis boot impatiently with his riding-whip, he opened it immediately.\r\nLouise slid through the half-open gate like a snake, and bounded\r\nlightly forward. Eugénie, apparently calm, although in all probability\r\nher heart beat somewhat faster than usual, went out in her turn.\r\n\r\nA porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau; then the two\r\nyoung girls, having told him to take it to No. 36, Rue de la Victoire,\r\nwalked behind this man, whose presence comforted Louise. As for\r\nEugénie, she was as strong as a Judith or a Delilah. They arrived at\r\nthe appointed spot. Eugénie ordered the porter to put down the\r\nportmanteau, gave him some pieces of money, and having rapped at the\r\nshutter sent him away. The shutter where Eugénie had rapped was that of\r\na little laundress, who had been previously warned, and was not yet\r\ngone to bed. She opened the door.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” said Eugénie, “let the porter get the post-chaise from\r\nthe coach-house, and fetch some post-horses from the hotel. Here are\r\nfive francs for his trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said Louise, “I admire you, and I could almost say respect\r\nyou.” The laundress looked on in astonishment, but as she had been\r\npromised twenty louis, she made no remark.\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post-boy and horses,\r\nwhich were harnessed, and put in the post-chaise in a minute, while the\r\nporter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and\r\nstrap.\r\n\r\n“Here is the passport,” said the postilion, “which way are we going,\r\nyoung gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“To Fontainebleau,” replied Eugénie with an almost masculine voice.\r\n\r\n“What do you say?” said Louise.\r\n\r\n“I am giving them the slip,” said Eugénie; “this woman to whom we have\r\ngiven twenty louis may betray us for forty; we will soon alter our\r\ndirection.”\r\n\r\nAnd the young girl jumped into the britzka, which was admirably\r\narranged for sleeping in, without scarcely touching the step.\r\n\r\n“You are always right,” said the music teacher, seating herself by the\r\nside of her friend.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion, having been put in the\r\nright road, passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the\r\nBarrière Saint-Martin.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Louise, breathing freely, “here we are out of Paris.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear, the abduction is an accomplished fact,” replied Eugénie.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and without violence,” said Louise.\r\n\r\n“I shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance,” replied\r\nEugénie.\r\n\r\nThese words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling\r\nover the pavement of La Villette. M. Danglars no longer had a daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern\r\n\r\nAnd now let us leave Mademoiselle Danglars and her friend pursuing\r\ntheir way to Brussels, and return to poor Andrea Cavalcanti, so\r\ninopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune. Notwithstanding his\r\nyouth, Master Andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy. We have\r\nseen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually\r\napproached the door, and crossing two or three rooms at last\r\ndisappeared. But we have forgotten to mention one circumstance, which\r\nnevertheless ought not to be omitted; in one of the rooms he crossed,\r\nthe _trousseau_ of the bride-elect was on exhibition. There were\r\ncaskets of diamonds, cashmere shawls, Valenciennes lace, English veils,\r\nand in fact all the tempting things, the bare mention of which makes\r\nthe hearts of young girls bound with joy, and which is called the\r\n_corbeille_.22 Now, in passing through this room, Andrea proved himself\r\nnot only to be clever and intelligent, but also provident, for he\r\nhelped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before him.\r\n\r\nFurnished with this plunder, Andrea leaped with a lighter heart from\r\nthe window, intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes. Tall\r\nand well proportioned as an ancient gladiator, and muscular as a\r\nSpartan, he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to\r\ndirect his steps, actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the\r\nspot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken. Having\r\npassed through the Rue du Mont-Blanc, guided by the instinct which\r\nleads thieves always to take the safest path, he found himself at the\r\nend of the Rue La Fayette. There he stopped, breathless and panting. He\r\nwas quite alone; on one side was the vast wilderness of the\r\nSaint-Lazare, on the other, Paris enshrouded in darkness.\r\n\r\n“Am I to be captured?” he cried; “no, not if I can use more activity\r\nthan my enemies. My safety is now a mere question of speed.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment he saw a cab at the top of the Faubourg Poissonnière.\r\nThe dull driver, smoking his pipe, was plodding along toward the limits\r\nof the Faubourg Saint-Denis, where no doubt he ordinarily had his\r\nstation.\r\n\r\n“Ho, friend!” said Benedetto.\r\n\r\n“What do you want, sir?” asked the driver.\r\n\r\n“Is your horse tired?”\r\n\r\n“Tired? oh, yes, tired enough—he has done nothing the whole of this\r\nblessed day! Four wretched fares, and twenty sous over, making in all\r\nseven francs, are all that I have earned, and I ought to take ten to\r\nthe owner.”\r\n\r\n“Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have?”\r\n\r\n“With pleasure, sir; twenty francs are not to be despised. Tell me what\r\nI am to do for this.”\r\n\r\n“A very easy thing, if your horse isn’t tired.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you he’ll go like the wind,—only tell me which way to drive.”\r\n\r\n“Towards the Louvres.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I know the way—you get good sweetened rum over there.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so; I merely wish to overtake one of my friends, with whom I\r\nam going to hunt tomorrow at Chapelle-en-Serval. He should have waited\r\nfor me here with a cabriolet till half-past eleven; it is twelve, and,\r\ntired of waiting, he must have gone on.”\r\n\r\n“It is likely.”\r\n\r\n“Well, will you try and overtake him?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing I should like better.”\r\n\r\n“If you do not overtake him before we reach Bourget you shall have\r\ntwenty francs; if not before Louvres, thirty.”\r\n\r\n“And if we do overtake him?”\r\n\r\n“Forty,” said Andrea, after a moment’s hesitation, at the end of which\r\nhe remembered that he might safely promise.\r\n\r\n“That’s all right,” said the man; “hop in, and we’re off! Who-o-o-pla!”\r\n\r\nAndrea got into the cab, which passed rapidly through the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Denis, along the Faubourg Saint-Martin, crossed the barrier, and\r\nthreaded its way through the interminable Villette. They never overtook\r\nthe chimerical friend, yet Andrea frequently inquired of people on foot\r\nwhom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed, for a green\r\ncabriolet and bay horse; and as there are a great many cabriolets to be\r\nseen on the road to the Low Countries, and as nine-tenths of them are\r\ngreen, the inquiries increased at every step. Everyone had just seen it\r\npass; it was only five hundred, two hundred, one hundred steps in\r\nadvance; at length they reached it, but it was not the friend. Once the\r\ncab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two\r\npost-horses.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Cavalcanti to himself, “if I only had that britzka, those\r\ntwo good post-horses, and above all the passport that carries them on!”\r\nAnd he sighed deeply.\r\n\r\nThe calash contained Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle d’Armilly.\r\n\r\n“Hurry, hurry!” said Andrea, “we must overtake him soon.”\r\n\r\nAnd the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since\r\nleaving the barrier, and arrived steaming at Louvres.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Andrea, “I shall not overtake my friend, but I shall\r\nkill your horse, therefore I had better stop. Here are thirty francs; I\r\nwill sleep at the _Cheval Rouge_, and will secure a place in the first\r\ncoach. Good-night, friend.”\r\n\r\nAnd Andrea, after placing six pieces of five francs each in the man’s\r\nhand, leaped lightly on to the pathway. The cabman joyfully pocketed\r\nthe sum, and turned back on his road to Paris. Andrea pretended to go\r\ntowards the hotel of the _Cheval Rouge_, but after leaning an instant\r\nagainst the door, and hearing the last sound of the cab, which was\r\ndisappearing from view, he went on his road, and with a lusty stride\r\nsoon traversed the space of two leagues. Then he rested; he must be\r\nnear Chapelle-en-Serval, where he pretended to be going.\r\n\r\nIt was not fatigue that stayed Andrea here; it was that he might form\r\nsome resolution, adopt some plan. It would be impossible to make use of\r\na diligence, equally so to engage post-horses; to travel either way a\r\npassport was necessary. It was still more impossible to remain in the\r\ndepartment of the Oise, one of the most open and strictly guarded in\r\nFrance; this was quite out of the question, especially to a man like\r\nAndrea, perfectly conversant with criminal matters.\r\n\r\nHe sat down by the side of the moat, buried his face in his hands and\r\nreflected. Ten minutes after he raised his head; his resolution was\r\nmade. He threw some dust over the topcoat, which he had found time to\r\nunhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume, and going\r\nto Chapelle-en-Serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nThe host opened.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Andrea, “I was coming from Mortefontaine to Senlis,\r\nwhen my horse, which is a troublesome creature, stumbled and threw me.\r\nI must reach Compiègne tonight, or I shall cause deep anxiety to my\r\nfamily. Could you let me hire a horse of you?”\r\n\r\nAn innkeeper has always a horse to let, whether it be good or bad. The\r\nhost called the stable-boy, and ordered him to saddle _Le Blanc_ then\r\nhe awoke his son, a child of seven years, whom he ordered to ride\r\nbefore the gentleman and bring back the horse. Andrea gave the\r\ninnkeeper twenty francs, and in taking them from his pocket dropped a\r\nvisiting card. This belonged to one of his friends at the Café de\r\nParis, so that the innkeeper, picking it up after Andrea had left, was\r\nconvinced that he had let his horse to the Count of Mauléon, 25 Rue\r\nSaint-Dominique, that being the name and address on the card.\r\n\r\n_Le Blanc_ was not a fast animal, but he kept up an easy, steady pace;\r\nin three hours and a half Andrea had traversed the nine leagues which\r\nseparated him from Compiègne, and four o’clock struck as he reached the\r\nplace where the coaches stop. There is an excellent tavern at\r\nCompiègne, well remembered by those who have ever been there. Andrea,\r\nwho had often stayed there in his rides about Paris, recollected the\r\nBell and Bottle inn; he turned around, saw the sign by the light of a\r\nreflected lamp, and having dismissed the child, giving him all the\r\nsmall coin he had about him, he began knocking at the door, very\r\nreasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he\r\nhad best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound\r\nsleep and a good supper. A waiter opened the door.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Andrea, “I have been dining at Saint-Jean-aux-Bois,\r\nand expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight, but like a\r\nfool I have lost my way, and have been walking for the last four hours\r\nin the forest. Show me into one of those pretty little rooms which\r\noverlook the court, and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of Bordeaux.”\r\n\r\nThe waiter had no suspicions; Andrea spoke with perfect composure, he\r\nhad a cigar in his mouth, and his hands in the pocket of his top coat;\r\nhis clothes were fashionably made, his chin smooth, his boots\r\nirreproachable; he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late,\r\nthat was all. While the waiter was preparing his room, the hostess\r\narose; Andrea assumed his most charming smile, and asked if he could\r\nhave No. 3, which he had occupied on his last stay at Compiègne.\r\nUnfortunately, No. 3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with\r\nhis sister. Andrea appeared in despair, but consoled himself when the\r\nhostess assured him that No. 7, prepared for him, was situated\r\nprecisely the same as No. 3, and while warming his feet and chatting\r\nabout the last races at Chantilly, he waited until they announced his\r\nroom to be ready.\r\n\r\nAndrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out\r\nupon the court of the Bell Hotel, which with its triple galleries like\r\nthose of a theatre, with the jessamine and clematis twining round the\r\nlight columns, forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you\r\ncan imagine. The fowl was tender, the wine old, the fire clear and\r\nsparkling, and Andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good\r\nan appetite as though nothing had happened. Then he went to bed and\r\nalmost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men\r\nof twenty years of age, even when they are torn with remorse. Now, here\r\nwe are obliged to own that Andrea ought to have felt remorse, but that\r\nhe did not.\r\n\r\nThis was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance\r\nof his security. Before daybreak he would awake, leave the inn after\r\nrigorously paying his bill, and reaching the forest, he would, under\r\npretence of making studies in painting, test the hospitality of some\r\npeasants, procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet,\r\ncasting off the lion’s skin to assume that of the woodman; then, with\r\nhis hands covered with dirt, his hair darkened by means of a leaden\r\ncomb, his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his\r\nold comrades had given him the recipe, he intended, by following the\r\nwooded districts, to reach the nearest frontier, walking by night and\r\nsleeping in the day in the forests and quarries, and only entering\r\ninhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time.\r\n\r\nOnce past the frontier, Andrea proposed making money of his diamonds;\r\nand by uniting the proceeds to ten bank-notes he always carried about\r\nwith him in case of accident, he would then find himself possessor of\r\nabout 50,000 livres, which he philosophically considered as no very\r\ndeplorable condition after all. Moreover, he reckoned much on the\r\ninterest of the Danglars to hush up the rumor of their own\r\nmisadventures. These were the reasons which, added to the fatigue,\r\ncaused Andrea to sleep so soundly. In order that he might wake early he\r\ndid not close the shutters, but contented himself with bolting the door\r\nand placing on the table an unclasped and long-pointed knife, whose\r\ntemper he well knew, and which was never absent from him.\r\n\r\nAbout seven in the morning Andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight,\r\nwhich played, warm and brilliant, upon his face. In all well-organized\r\nbrains, the predominating idea—and there always is one—is sure to be\r\nthe last thought before sleeping, and the first upon waking in the\r\nmorning. Andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating\r\nidea presented itself, and whispered in his ear that he had slept too\r\nlong. He jumped out of bed and ran to the window. A gendarme was\r\ncrossing the court. A gendarme is one of the most striking objects in\r\nthe world, even to a man void of uneasiness; but for one who has a\r\ntimid conscience, and with good cause too, the yellow, blue, and white\r\nuniform is really very alarming.\r\n\r\n“Why is that gendarme there?” asked Andrea of himself.\r\n\r\nThen, all at once, he replied, with that logic which the reader has,\r\ndoubtless, remarked in him, “There is nothing astonishing in seeing a\r\ngendarme at an inn; instead of being astonished, let me dress myself.”\r\nAnd the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had\r\nfailed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had\r\nled in Paris.\r\n\r\n“Now then,” said Andrea, while dressing himself, “I’ll wait till he\r\nleaves, and then I’ll slip away.”\r\n\r\n50047m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, saying this, Andrea, who had now put on his boots and cravat,\r\nstole gently to the window, and a second time lifted up the muslin\r\ncurtain. Not only was the first gendarme still there, but the young man\r\nnow perceived a second yellow, blue, and white uniform at the foot of\r\nthe staircase, the only one by which he could descend, while a third,\r\non horseback, holding a musket in his fist, was posted as a sentinel at\r\nthe great street-door which alone afforded the means of egress. The\r\nappearance of the third gendarme settled the matter, for a crowd of\r\ncurious loungers was extended before him, effectually blocking the\r\nentrance to the hotel.\r\n\r\n“They’re after me!” was Andrea’s first thought. “_Diable!_”\r\n\r\nA pallor overspread the young man’s forehead, and he looked around him\r\nwith anxiety. His room, like all those on the same floor, had but one\r\noutlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody. “I am lost!” was his\r\nsecond thought; and, indeed, for a man in Andrea’s situation, an arrest\r\nmeant the assizes, trial, and death,—death without mercy or delay.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands, and\r\nduring that brief period he became nearly mad with terror; but soon a\r\nray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his\r\nmind, and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks.\r\nHe looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the\r\nchimney-piece; they were a pen, ink, and paper. With forced composure\r\nhe dipped the pen in the ink, and wrote the following lines upon a\r\nsheet of paper:\r\n\r\n“I have no money to pay my bill, but I am not a dishonest man; I leave\r\nbehind me as a pledge this pin, worth ten times the amount. I shall be\r\nexcused for leaving at daybreak, for I was ashamed.”\r\n\r\nHe then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper. This\r\ndone, instead of leaving the door fastened, he drew back the bolts and\r\neven placed the door ajar, as though he had left the room, forgetting\r\nto close it, and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to\r\nthat kind of gymnastic exercise, after replacing the chimney-board,\r\nwhich represented Achilles with Deidamia, and effacing the very marks\r\nof his feet upon the ashes, he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel,\r\nwhich afforded him the only means of escape left.\r\n\r\nAt this precise time, the first gendarme Andrea had noticed walked\r\nupstairs, preceded by the commissary of police, and supported by the\r\nsecond gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by\r\nthe one stationed at the door.\r\n\r\nAndrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances. At\r\ndaybreak, the telegraphs were set at work in all directions, and almost\r\nimmediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost\r\nendeavors to arrest the murderer of Caderousse. Compiègne, that royal\r\nresidence and fortified town, is well furnished with authorities,\r\ngendarmes, and commissaries of police; they therefore began operations\r\nas soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived, and the Bell and Bottle\r\nbeing the best-known hotel in the town, they had naturally directed\r\ntheir first inquiries there.\r\n\r\nNow, besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the Hôtel de Ville,\r\nwhich is next door to the Bell and Bottle, it had been stated by others\r\nthat a number of travellers had arrived during the night. The sentinel\r\nwho was relieved at six o’clock in the morning, remembered perfectly\r\nthat, just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four, a young\r\nman arrived on horseback, with a little boy before him. The young man,\r\nhaving dismissed the boy and horse, knocked at the door of the hotel,\r\nwhich was opened, and again closed after his entrance. This late\r\narrival had attracted much suspicion, and the young man being no other\r\nthan Andrea, the commissary and gendarme, who was a brigadier, directed\r\ntheir steps towards his room. They found the door ajar.\r\n\r\n“Oh, oh,” said the brigadier, who thoroughly understood the trick; “a\r\nbad sign to find the door open! I would rather find it triply bolted.”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, the little note and pin upon the table confirmed, or\r\nrather corroborated, the sad truth. Andrea had fled. We say\r\ncorroborated, because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced\r\nby a single proof. He glanced around, looked in the bed, shook the\r\ncurtains, opened the closets, and finally stopped at the chimney.\r\nAndrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the\r\nashes, but still it was an outlet, and in this light was not to be\r\npassed over without serious investigation.\r\n\r\nThe brigadier sent for some sticks and straw, and having filled the\r\nchimney with them, set a light to it. The fire crackled, and the smoke\r\nascended like the dull vapor from a volcano; but still no prisoner fell\r\ndown, as they expected. The fact was, that Andrea, at war with society\r\never since his youth, was quite as deep as a gendarme, even though he\r\nwere advanced to the rank of brigadier, and quite prepared for the\r\nfire, he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the\r\nchimney-pots.\r\n\r\n50049m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt one time he thought he was saved, for he heard the brigadier exclaim\r\nin a loud voice, to the two gendarmes, “He is not here!” But venturing\r\nto peep, he perceived that the latter, instead of retiring, as might\r\nhave been reasonably expected upon this announcement, were watching\r\nwith increased attention.\r\n\r\nIt was now his turn to look about him; the Hôtel de Ville, a massive\r\nsixteenth century building, was on his right; anyone could descend from\r\nthe openings in the tower, and examine every corner of the roof below,\r\nand Andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at\r\none of these openings. If once discovered, he knew he would be lost,\r\nfor the roof afforded no chance of escape; he therefore resolved to\r\ndescend, not through the same chimney by which he had come up, but by a\r\nsimilar one conducting to another room.\r\n\r\nHe looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued, and having\r\nreached it, he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by\r\nanyone. At the same minute, one of the little windows of the Hôtel de\r\nVille was thrown open, and the head of a gendarme appeared. For an\r\ninstant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the\r\nbuilding, then after a long sigh of disappointment the head\r\ndisappeared. The brigadier, calm and dignified as the law he\r\nrepresented, passed through the crowd, without answering the thousand\r\nquestions addressed to him, and re-entered the hotel.\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked the two gendarmes.\r\n\r\n“Well, my boys,” said the brigadier, “the brigand must really have\r\nescaped early this morning; but we will send to the Villers-Coterets\r\nand Noyon roads, and search the forest, when we shall catch him, no\r\ndoubt.”\r\n\r\nThe honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus, in that\r\nintonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie, when a\r\nloud scream, accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell, resounded\r\nthrough the court of the hotel.\r\n\r\n“Ah, what is that?” cried the brigadier.\r\n\r\n“Some traveller seems impatient,” said the host. “What number was it\r\nthat rang?”\r\n\r\n“Number 3.”\r\n\r\n“Run, waiter!”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled.\r\n\r\n“Aha!” said the brigadier, stopping the servant, “the person who is\r\nringing appears to want something more than a waiter; we will attend\r\nupon him with a gendarme. Who occupies Number 3?”\r\n\r\n“The little fellow who arrived last night in a post-chaise with his\r\nsister, and who asked for an apartment with two beds.”\r\n\r\nThe bell here rang for the third time, with another shriek of anguish.\r\n\r\n“Follow me, Mr. Commissary!” said the brigadier; “tread in my steps.”\r\n\r\n“Wait an instant,” said the host; “Number 3 has two staircases,—inside\r\nand outside.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said the brigadier. “I will take charge of the inside one. Are\r\nthe carbines loaded?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, brigadier.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you guard the exterior, and if he attempts to fly, fire upon\r\nhim; he must be a great criminal, from what the telegraph says.”\r\n\r\nThe brigadier, followed by the commissary, disappeared by the inside\r\nstaircase, accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting\r\nAndrea had excited in the crowd.\r\n\r\nThis is what had happened: Andrea had very cleverly managed to descend\r\ntwo-thirds of the chimney, but then his foot slipped, and\r\nnotwithstanding his endeavors, he came into the room with more speed\r\nand noise than he intended. It would have signified little had the room\r\nbeen empty, but unfortunately it was occupied. Two ladies, sleeping in\r\none bed, were awakened by the noise, and fixing their eyes upon the\r\nspot whence the sound proceeded, they saw a man. One of these ladies,\r\nthe fair one, uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through\r\nthe house, while the other, rushing to the bell-rope, rang with all her\r\nstrength. Andrea, as we can see, was surrounded by misfortune.\r\n\r\n“For pity’s sake,” he cried, pale and bewildered, without seeing whom\r\nhe was addressing,—“for pity’s sake do not call assistance! Save me!—I\r\nwill not harm you.”\r\n\r\n“Andrea, the murderer!” cried one of the ladies.\r\n\r\n“Eugénie! Mademoiselle Danglars!” exclaimed Andrea, stupefied.\r\n\r\n“Help, help!” cried Mademoiselle d’Armilly, taking the bell from her\r\ncompanion’s hand, and ringing it yet more violently.\r\n\r\n“Save me, I am pursued!” said Andrea, clasping his hands. “For pity,\r\nfor mercy’s sake do not deliver me up!”\r\n\r\n“It is too late, they are coming,” said Eugénie.\r\n\r\n“Well, conceal me somewhere; you can say you were needlessly alarmed;\r\nyou can turn their suspicions and save my life!”\r\n\r\n50053m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two ladies, pressing closely to one another, and drawing the\r\nbedclothes tightly around them, remained silent to this supplicating\r\nvoice, repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds.\r\n\r\n“Well, be it so,” at length said Eugénie; “return by the same road you\r\ncame, and we will say nothing about you, unhappy wretch.”\r\n\r\n“Here he is, here he is!” cried a voice from the landing; “here he is!\r\nI see him!”\r\n\r\nThe brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole, and had discovered Andrea\r\nin a posture of entreaty. A violent blow from the butt end of the\r\nmusket burst open the lock, two more forced out the bolts, and the\r\nbroken door fell in. Andrea ran to the other door, leading to the\r\ngallery, ready to rush out; but he was stopped short, and he stood with\r\nhis body a little thrown back, pale, and with the useless knife in his\r\nclenched hand.\r\n\r\n“Fly, then!” cried Mademoiselle d’Armilly, whose pity returned as her\r\nfears diminished; “fly!”\r\n\r\n“Or kill yourself!” said Eugénie (in a tone which a Vestal in the\r\namphitheatre would have used, when urging the victorious gladiator to\r\nfinish his vanquished adversary). Andrea shuddered, and looked on the\r\nyoung girl with an expression which proved how little he understood\r\nsuch ferocious honor.\r\n\r\n“Kill myself?” he cried, throwing down his knife; “why should I do so?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you said,” answered Mademoiselle Danglars, “that you would be\r\ncondemned to die like the worst criminals.”\r\n\r\n50055m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Bah,” said Cavalcanti, crossing his arms, “one has friends.”\r\n\r\nThe brigadier advanced to him, sword in hand.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said Andrea, “sheathe your sword, my fine fellow; there\r\nis no occasion to make such a fuss, since I give myself up;” and he\r\nheld out his hands to be manacled.\r\n\r\nThe two girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis, the\r\nman of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a\r\ngalley-slave. Andrea turned towards them, and with an impertinent smile\r\nasked, “Have you any message for your father, Mademoiselle Danglars,\r\nfor in all probability I shall return to Paris?”\r\n\r\nEugénie covered her face with her hands.\r\n\r\n“Oh, oh!” said Andrea, “you need not be ashamed, even though you did\r\npost after me. Was I not nearly your husband?”\r\n\r\n50056m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd with this raillery Andrea went out, leaving the two girls a prey to\r\ntheir own feelings of shame, and to the comments of the crowd. An hour\r\nafter they stepped into their calash, both dressed in feminine attire.\r\nThe gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight, but\r\nthey were forced, when the door was open, to pass through a throng of\r\ncurious glances and whispering voices.\r\n\r\nEugénie closed her eyes; but though she could not see, she could hear,\r\nand the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage.\r\n\r\n“Oh, why is not the world a wilderness?” she exclaimed, throwing\r\nherself into the arms of Mademoiselle d’Armilly, her eyes sparkling\r\nwith the same kind of rage which made Nero wish that the Roman world\r\nhad but one neck, that he might sever it at a single blow.\r\n\r\nThe next day they stopped at the Hôtel de Flandre, at Brussels. The\r\nsame evening Andrea was incarcerated in the Conciergerie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 99. The Law\r\n\r\nWe have seen how quietly Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle\r\nd’Armilly accomplished their transformation and flight; the fact being\r\nthat everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think\r\nof theirs.\r\n\r\nWe will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his\r\ndebt before the phantom of bankruptcy, and follow the baroness, who\r\nafter being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had\r\nstruck her, had gone to seek her usual adviser, Lucien Debray. The\r\nbaroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her\r\nof a guardianship which, over a girl of Eugénie’s character, could not\r\nfail to be rather a troublesome undertaking; for in the tacit relations\r\nwhich maintain the bond of family union, the mother, to maintain her\r\nascendancy over her daughter, must never fail to be a model of wisdom\r\nand a type of perfection.\r\n\r\nNow, Madame Danglars feared Eugénie’s sagacity and the influence of\r\nMademoiselle d’Armilly; she had frequently observed the contemptuous\r\nexpression with which her daughter looked upon Debray,—an expression\r\nwhich seemed to imply that she understood all her mother’s amorous and\r\npecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary; moreover, she saw\r\nthat Eugénie detested Debray, not only because he was a source of\r\ndissension and scandal under the paternal roof, but because she had at\r\nonce classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom Plato endeavors to\r\nwithdraw from the appellation of men, and whom Diogenes designated as\r\nanimals upon two legs without feathers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in this world of ours, each person views things through\r\na certain medium, and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as\r\nothers, and Madame Danglars, therefore, very much regretted that the\r\nmarriage of Eugénie had not taken place, not only because the match was\r\ngood, and likely to insure the happiness of her child, but because it\r\nwould also set her at liberty. She ran therefore to Debray, who, after\r\nhaving, like the rest of Paris, witnessed the contract scene and the\r\nscandal attending it, had retired in haste to his club, where he was\r\nchatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of\r\nconversation for three-fourths of that city known as the capital of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAt the precise time when Madame Danglars, dressed in black and\r\nconcealed in a long veil, was ascending the stairs leading to Debray’s\r\napartments, notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the\r\nyoung man was not at home, Debray was occupied in repelling the\r\ninsinuations of a friend, who tried to persuade him that after the\r\nterrible scene which had just taken place he ought, as a friend of the\r\nfamily, to marry Mademoiselle Danglars and her two millions. Debray did\r\nnot defend himself very warmly, for the idea had sometimes crossed his\r\nmind; still, when he recollected the independent, proud spirit of\r\nEugénie, he positively rejected it as utterly impossible, though the\r\nsame thought again continually recurred and found a resting-place in\r\nhis heart. Tea, play, and the conversation, which had become\r\ninteresting during the discussion of such serious affairs, lasted till\r\none o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Madame Danglars, veiled and uneasy, awaited the return of\r\nDebray in the little green room, seated between two baskets of flowers,\r\nwhich she had that morning sent, and which, it must be confessed,\r\nDebray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his\r\nabsence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman.\r\n\r\nAt twenty minutes to twelve, Madame Danglars, tired of waiting,\r\nreturned home. Women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes\r\nin one respect, they seldom return home after twelve o’clock. The\r\nbaroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as Eugénie used in\r\nleaving it; she ran lightly upstairs, and with an aching heart entered\r\nher apartment, contiguous, as we know, to that of Eugénie. She was\r\nfearful of exciting any remark, and believed firmly in her daughter’s\r\ninnocence and fidelity to the paternal roof. She listened at Eugénie’s\r\ndoor, and hearing no sound tried to enter, but the bolts were in place.\r\nMadame Danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome\r\nwith the terrible excitement of the evening, and had gone to bed and to\r\nsleep. She called the maid and questioned her.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle Eugénie,” said the maid, “retired to her apartment with\r\nMademoiselle d’Armilly; they then took tea together, after which they\r\ndesired me to leave, saying that they needed me no longer.”\r\n\r\nSince then the maid had been below, and like everyone else she thought\r\nthe young ladies were in their own room; Madame Danglars, therefore,\r\nwent to bed without a shadow of suspicion, and began to muse over the\r\nrecent events. In proportion as her memory became clearer, the\r\noccurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light; what she\r\nhad taken for confusion was a tumult; what she had regarded as\r\nsomething distressing, was in reality a disgrace. And then the baroness\r\nremembered that she had felt no pity for poor Mercédès, who had been\r\nafflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son.\r\n\r\n“Eugénie,” she said to herself, “is lost, and so are we. The affair, as\r\nit will be reported, will cover us with shame; for in a society such as\r\nours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound. How fortunate that\r\nEugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made\r\nme tremble!”\r\n\r\nAnd her glance was turned towards heaven, where a mysterious Providence\r\ndisposes all things, and out of a fault, nay, even a vice, sometimes\r\nproduces a blessing. And then her thoughts, cleaving through space like\r\na bird in the air, rested on Cavalcanti. This Andrea was a wretch, a\r\nrobber, an assassin, and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort\r\nof education, if not a complete one; he had been presented to the world\r\nwith the appearance of an immense fortune, supported by an honorable\r\nname. How could she extricate herself from this labyrinth? To whom\r\nwould she apply to help her out of this painful situation? Debray, to\r\nwhom she had run, with the first instinct of a woman towards the man\r\nshe loves, and who yet betrays her,—Debray could but give her advice,\r\nshe must apply to someone more powerful than he.\r\n\r\nThe baroness then thought of M. de Villefort. It was M. de Villefort\r\nwho had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family, as though\r\nthey had been strangers. But, no; on reflection, the procureur was not\r\na merciless man; and it was not the magistrate, slave to his duties,\r\nbut the friend, the loyal friend, who roughly but firmly cut into the\r\nvery core of the corruption; it was not the executioner, but the\r\nsurgeon, who wished to withdraw the honor of Danglars from ignominious\r\nassociation with the disgraced young man they had presented to the\r\nworld as their son-in-law. And since Villefort, the friend of Danglars,\r\nhad acted in this way, no one could suppose that he had been previously\r\nacquainted with, or had lent himself to, any of Andrea’s intrigues.\r\nVillefort’s conduct, therefore, upon reflection, appeared to the\r\nbaroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage. But the inflexibility\r\nof the procureur should stop there; she would see him the next day, and\r\nif she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate, she\r\nwould, at least, obtain all the indulgence he could allow. She would\r\ninvoke the past, recall old recollections; she would supplicate him by\r\nthe remembrance of guilty, yet happy days. M. de Villefort would stifle\r\nthe affair; he had only to turn his eyes on one side, and allow Andrea\r\nto fly, and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called\r\ncontempt of court. And after this reasoning she slept easily.\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock next morning she arose, and without ringing for her\r\nmaid or giving the least sign of her activity, she dressed herself in\r\nthe same simple style as on the previous night; then running\r\ndownstairs, she left the hotel, walked to the Rue de Provence, called a\r\ncab, and drove to M. de Villefort’s house.\r\n\r\nFor the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy\r\nappearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague. Some of the\r\napartments were closed within and without; the shutters were only\r\nopened to admit a minute’s air, showing the scared face of a footman,\r\nand immediately afterwards the window would be closed, like a\r\ngravestone falling on a sepulchre, and the neighbors would say to each\r\nother in a low voice, “Will there be another funeral today at the\r\nprocureur’s house?”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the\r\nmansion; descending from the cab, she approached the door with\r\ntrembling knees, and rang the bell. Three times did the bell ring with\r\na dull, heavy sound, seeming to participate, in the general sadness,\r\nbefore the concierge appeared and peeped through the door, which he\r\nopened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard. He saw a lady,\r\na fashionable, elegantly dressed lady, and yet the door remained almost\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\n“Do you intend opening the door?” said the baroness.\r\n\r\n“First, madame, who are you?”\r\n\r\n“Who am I? You know me well enough.”\r\n\r\n“We no longer know anyone, madame.”\r\n\r\n“You must be mad, my friend,” said the baroness.\r\n\r\n“Where do you come from?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, this is too much!”\r\n\r\n“Madame, these are my orders; excuse me. Your name?”\r\n\r\n“The baroness Danglars; you have seen me twenty times.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly, madame. And now, what do you want?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, how extraordinary! I shall complain to M. de Villefort of the\r\nimpertinence of his servants.”\r\n\r\n“Madame, this is precaution, not impertinence; no one enters here\r\nwithout an order from M. d’Avrigny, or without speaking to the\r\nprocureur.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I have business with the procureur.”\r\n\r\n“Is it pressing business?”\r\n\r\n“You can imagine so, since I have not even brought my carriage out yet.\r\nBut enough of this—here is my card, take it to your master.”\r\n\r\n“Madame will await my return?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; go.”\r\n\r\nThe concierge closed the door, leaving Madame Danglars in the street.\r\nShe had not long to wait; directly afterwards the door was opened wide\r\nenough to admit her, and when she had passed through, it was again\r\nshut. Without losing sight of her for an instant, the concierge took a\r\nwhistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court, and blew it.\r\nThe valet de chambre appeared on the door-steps.\r\n\r\n“You will excuse this poor fellow, madame,” he said, as he preceded the\r\nbaroness, “but his orders are precise, and M. de Villefort begged me to\r\ntell you that he could not act otherwise.”\r\n\r\nIn the court showing his merchandise, was a tradesman who had been\r\nadmitted with the same precautions. The baroness ascended the steps;\r\nshe felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to\r\nmagnify her own, and still guided by the valet de chambre, who never\r\nlost sight of her for an instant, she was introduced to the\r\nmagistrate’s study.\r\n\r\nPreoccupied as Madame Danglars had been with the object of her visit,\r\nthe treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so\r\ninsulting, that she began by complaining of it. But Villefort, raising\r\nhis head, bowed down by grief, looked up at her with so sad a smile\r\nthat her complaints died upon her lips.\r\n\r\n“Forgive my servants,” he said, “for a terror I cannot blame them for;\r\nfrom being suspected they have become suspicious.”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate\r\nalluded, but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never\r\nhave believed that the sentiment had been carried so far.\r\n\r\n“You too, then, are unhappy?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame,” replied the magistrate.\r\n\r\n“Then you pity me!”\r\n\r\n“Sincerely, madame.”\r\n\r\n“And you understand what brings me here?”\r\n\r\n“You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just\r\nhappened?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,—a fearful misfortune.”\r\n\r\n“You mean a mischance.”\r\n\r\n“A mischance?” repeated the baroness.\r\n\r\n“Alas, madame,” said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of\r\nmanner, “I consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable.”\r\n\r\n“And do you suppose this will be forgotten?”\r\n\r\n“Everything will be forgotten, madame,” said Villefort. “Your daughter\r\nwill be married tomorrow, if not today—in a week, if not tomorrow; and\r\nI do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter.”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars gazed on Villefort, stupefied to find him so almost\r\ninsultingly calm. “Am I come to a friend?” she asked in a tone full of\r\nmournful dignity.\r\n\r\n“You know that you are, madame,” said Villefort, whose pale cheeks\r\nbecame slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance. And truly this\r\nassurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying\r\nthe baroness and him.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, be more affectionate, my dear Villefort,” said the\r\nbaroness. “Speak to me not as a magistrate, but as a friend; and when I\r\nam in bitter anguish of spirit, do not tell me that I ought to be gay.”\r\nVillefort bowed.\r\n\r\n“When I hear misfortunes named, madame,” he said, “I have within the\r\nlast few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own, and\r\nthen I cannot help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind. That\r\nis the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me\r\nmere mischances; that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear\r\nenviable. But this annoys you; let us change the subject. You were\r\nsaying, madame——”\r\n\r\n“I came to ask you, my friend,” said the baroness, “what will be done\r\nwith this impostor?”\r\n\r\n“Impostor,” repeated Villefort; “certainly, madame, you appear to\r\nextenuate some cases, and exaggerate others. Impostor, indeed!—M.\r\nAndrea Cavalcanti, or rather M. Benedetto, is nothing more nor less\r\nthan an assassin!”\r\n\r\n“Sir, I do not deny the justice of your correction, but the more\r\nseverely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man, the more deeply\r\nwill you strike our family. Come, forget him for a moment, and instead\r\nof pursuing him, let him go.”\r\n\r\n“You are too late, madame; the orders are issued.”\r\n\r\n“Well, should he be arrested—do they think they will arrest him?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so.”\r\n\r\n“If they should arrest him (I know that sometimes prisons afford means\r\nof escape), will you leave him in prison?”\r\n\r\nThe procureur shook his head.\r\n\r\n“At least keep him there till my daughter be married.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible, madame; justice has its formalities.”\r\n\r\n“What, even for me?” said the baroness, half jesting, half in earnest.\r\n\r\n“For all, even for myself among the rest,” replied Villefort.\r\n\r\n50063m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed the baroness, without expressing the ideas which the\r\nexclamation betrayed. Villefort looked at her with that piercing glance\r\nwhich reads the secrets of the heart.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know what you mean,” he said; “you refer to the terrible rumors\r\nspread abroad in the world, that the deaths which have kept me in\r\nmourning for the last three months, and from which Valentine has only\r\nescaped by a miracle, have not happened by natural means.”\r\n\r\n“I was not thinking of that,” replied Madame Danglars quickly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you were thinking of it, and with justice. You could not help\r\nthinking of it, and saying to yourself, ‘you, who pursue crime so\r\nvindictively, answer now, why are there unpunished crimes in your\r\ndwelling?’” The baroness became pale. “You were saying this, were you\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I own it.”\r\n\r\n“I will answer you.”\r\n\r\nVillefort drew his armchair nearer to Madame Danglars; then resting\r\nboth hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual:\r\n\r\n“There are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are\r\nunknown, and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty; but\r\nwhen the culprits are discovered” (Villefort here extended his hand\r\ntoward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk)—“when they are\r\ndiscovered, I swear to you, by all I hold most sacred, that whoever\r\nthey may be they shall die. Now, after the oath I have just taken, and\r\nwhich I will keep, madame, dare you ask for mercy for that wretch!”\r\n\r\n“But, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?”\r\n\r\n“Listen; this is his description: ‘Benedetto, condemned, at the age of\r\nsixteen, for five years to the galleys for forgery.’ He promised well,\r\nas you see—first a runaway, then an assassin.”\r\n\r\n“And who is this wretch?”\r\n\r\n“Who can tell?—a vagabond, a Corsican.”\r\n\r\n“Has no one owned him?”\r\n\r\n“No one; his parents are unknown.”\r\n\r\n“But who was the man who brought him from Lucca?”\r\n\r\n“Another rascal like himself, perhaps his accomplice.” The baroness\r\nclasped her hands.\r\n\r\n“Villefort,” she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner.\r\n\r\n“For Heaven’s sake, madame,” said Villefort, with a firmness of\r\nexpression not altogether free from harshness—“for Heaven’s sake, do\r\nnot ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch! What am I?—the law. Has the\r\nlaw any eyes to witness your grief? Has the law ears to be melted by\r\nyour sweet voice? Has the law a memory for all those soft recollections\r\nyou endeavor to recall? No, madame; the law has commanded, and when it\r\ncommands it strikes. You will tell me that I am a living being, and not\r\na code—a man, and not a volume. Look at me, madame—look around me. Has\r\nmankind treated me as a brother? Have men loved me? Have they spared\r\nme? Has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands?\r\nNo, madame, they struck me, always struck me!\r\n\r\n50065m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Woman, siren that you are, do you persist in fixing on me that\r\nfascinating eye, which reminds me that I ought to blush? Well, be it\r\nso; let me blush for the faults you know, and perhaps—perhaps for even\r\nmore than those! But having sinned myself,—it may be more deeply than\r\nothers,—I never rest till I have torn the disguises from my\r\nfellow-creatures, and found out their weaknesses. I have always found\r\nthem; and more,—I repeat it with joy, with triumph,—I have always found\r\nsome proof of human perversity or error. Every criminal I condemn seems\r\nto me living evidence that I am not a hideous exception to the rest.\r\nAlas, alas, alas; all the world is wicked; let us therefore strike at\r\nwickedness!”\r\n\r\nVillefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage, which gave\r\na ferocious eloquence to his words.\r\n\r\n“But”’ said Madame Danglars, resolving to make a last effort, “this\r\nyoung man, though a murderer, is an orphan, abandoned by everybody.”\r\n\r\n“So much the worse, or rather, so much the better; it has been so\r\nordained that he may have none to weep his fate.”\r\n\r\n“But this is trampling on the weak, sir.”\r\n\r\n“The weakness of a murderer!”\r\n\r\n“His dishonor reflects upon us.”\r\n\r\n“Is not death in my house?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir,” exclaimed the baroness, “you are without pity for others,\r\nwell, then, I tell you they will have no mercy on you!”\r\n\r\n“Be it so!” said Villefort, raising his arms to heaven with a\r\nthreatening gesture.\r\n\r\n“At least, delay the trial till the next assizes; we shall then have\r\nsix months before us.”\r\n\r\n“No, madame,” said Villefort; “instructions have been given. There are\r\nyet five days left; five days are more than I require. Do you not think\r\nthat I also long for forgetfulness? While working night and day, I\r\nsometimes lose all recollection of the past, and then I experience the\r\nsame sort of happiness I can imagine the dead feel; still, it is better\r\nthan suffering.”\r\n\r\n“But, sir, he has fled; let him escape—inaction is a pardonable\r\noffence.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you it is too late; early this morning the telegraph was\r\nemployed, and at this very minute——”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the valet de chambre, entering the room, “a dragoon has\r\nbrought this despatch from the Minister of the Interior.”\r\n\r\nVillefort seized the letter, and hastily broke the seal. Madame\r\nDanglars trembled with fear; Villefort started with joy.\r\n\r\n“Arrested!” he exclaimed; “he was taken at Compiègne, and all is over.”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars rose from her seat, pale and cold.\r\n\r\n“Adieu, sir,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Adieu, madame,” replied the king’s attorney, as in an almost joyful\r\nmanner he conducted her to the door. Then, turning to his desk, he\r\nsaid, striking the letter with the back of his right hand:\r\n\r\n“Come, I had a forgery, three robberies, and two cases of arson, I only\r\nwanted a murder, and here it is. It will be a splendid session!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 100. The Apparition\r\n\r\nAs the procureur had told Madame Danglars, Valentine was not yet\r\nrecovered. Bowed down with fatigue, she was indeed confined to her bed;\r\nand it was in her own room, and from the lips of Madame de Villefort,\r\nthat she heard all the strange events we have related; we mean the\r\nflight of Eugénie and the arrest of Andrea Cavalcanti, or rather\r\nBenedetto, together with the accusation of murder pronounced against\r\nhim. But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the\r\nsame effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of\r\nhealth. Indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and\r\nconfused forms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented\r\nthemselves before her eyes.\r\n\r\nDuring the daytime Valentine’s perceptions remained tolerably clear,\r\nowing to the constant presence of M. Noirtier, who caused himself to be\r\ncarried to his granddaughter’s room, and watched her with his paternal\r\ntenderness; Villefort also, on his return from the law courts,\r\nfrequently passed an hour or two with his father and child.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock Villefort retired to his study, at eight M. d’Avrigny\r\nhimself arrived, bringing the night draught prepared for the young\r\ngirl, and then M. Noirtier was carried away. A nurse of the doctor’s\r\nchoice succeeded them, and never left till about ten or eleven o’clock,\r\nwhen Valentine was asleep. As she went downstairs she gave the keys of\r\nValentine’s room to M. de Villefort, so that no one could reach the\r\nsick-room excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little\r\nEdward.\r\n\r\nEvery morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine,\r\nand, extraordinary as it seemed, each day found him less uneasy.\r\nCertainly, though Valentine still labored under dreadful nervous\r\nexcitement, she was better; and moreover, Monte Cristo had told him\r\nwhen, half distracted, he had rushed to the count’s house, that if she\r\nwere not dead in two hours she would be saved. Now four days had\r\nelapsed, and Valentine still lived.\r\n\r\nThe nervous excitement of which we speak pursued Valentine even in her\r\nsleep, or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking\r\nhours; it was then, in the silence of night, in the dim light shed from\r\nthe alabaster lamp on the chimney-piece, that she saw the shadows pass\r\nand repass which hover over the bed of sickness, and fan the fever with\r\ntheir trembling wings. First she fancied she saw her stepmother\r\nthreatening her, then Morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes\r\nmere strangers, like the Count of Monte Cristo came to visit her; even\r\nthe very furniture, in these moments of delirium, seemed to move, and\r\nthis state lasted till about three o’clock in the morning, when a deep,\r\nheavy slumber overcame the young girl, from which she did not awake\r\ntill daylight.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day on which Valentine had learned of the flight\r\nof Eugénie and the arrest of Benedetto,—Villefort having retired as\r\nwell as Noirtier and d’Avrigny,—her thoughts wandered in a confused\r\nmaze, alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had\r\njust heard.\r\n\r\nEleven o’clock had struck. The nurse, having placed the beverage\r\nprepared by the doctor within reach of the patient, and locked the\r\ndoor, was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the\r\nkitchen, and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had\r\nfor some months past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the\r\nhouse of the king’s attorney. Meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing\r\nin the room which had been so carefully locked.\r\n\r\nTen minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left; Valentine, who for\r\nthe last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly,\r\nincapable of controlling her ideas, was forced to yield to the\r\nexcitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a\r\nsuccession and recurrence of the same fancies and images. The\r\nnight-lamp threw out countless rays, each resolving itself into some\r\nstrange form to her disordered imagination, when suddenly by its\r\nflickering light Valentine thought she saw the door of her library,\r\nwhich was in the recess by the chimney-piece, open slowly, though she\r\nin vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned.\r\n\r\nAt any other time Valentine would have seized the silken bell-pull and\r\nsummoned assistance, but nothing astonished her in her present\r\nsituation. Her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but\r\nthe children of her imagination, and the conviction was strengthened by\r\nthe fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal\r\nphantoms, who disappeared with the coming of daylight.\r\n\r\nFrom behind the door a human figure appeared, but the girl was too\r\nfamiliar with such apparitions to be alarmed, and therefore only\r\nstared, hoping to recognize Morrel. The figure advanced towards the bed\r\nand appeared to listen with profound attention. At this moment a ray of\r\nlight glanced across the face of the midnight visitor.\r\n\r\n“It is not he,” she murmured, and waited, in the assurance that this\r\nwas but a dream, for the man to disappear or assume some other form.\r\nStill, she felt her pulse, and finding it throb violently she\r\nremembered that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to\r\ndrink, for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay\r\nher fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain, and for a short time\r\nshe suffered less. Valentine therefore reached her hand towards the\r\nglass, but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition\r\nadvanced more quickly towards her, and approached the young girl so\r\nclosely that she fancied she heard his breath, and felt the pressure of\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nThis time the illusion, or rather the reality, surpassed anything\r\nValentine had before experienced; she began to believe herself really\r\nalive and awake, and the belief that her reason was this time not\r\ndeceived made her shudder. The pressure she felt was evidently intended\r\nto arrest her arm, and she slowly withdrew it. Then the figure, from\r\nwhom she could not detach her eyes, and who appeared more protecting\r\nthan menacing, took the glass, and walking towards the night-light held\r\nit up, as if to test its transparency. This did not seem sufficient;\r\nthe man, or rather the ghost—for he trod so softly that no sound was\r\nheard—then poured out about a spoonful into the glass, and drank it.\r\n\r\nValentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction. Every\r\nminute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another\r\nvision; but the man, instead of dissolving like a shadow, again\r\napproached her, and said in an agitated voice, “Now you may drink.”\r\n\r\nValentine shuddered. It was the first time one of these visions had\r\never addressed her in a living voice, and she was about to utter an\r\nexclamation. The man placed his finger on her lips.\r\n\r\n“The Count of Monte Cristo!” she murmured.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl’s mind\r\nas to the reality of the scene; her eyes started with terror, her hands\r\ntrembled, and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her. Still, the\r\npresence of Monte Cristo at such an hour, his mysterious, fanciful, and\r\nextraordinary entrance into her room through the wall, might well seem\r\nimpossibilities to her shattered reason.\r\n\r\n“Do not call anyone—do not be alarmed,” said the count; “do not let a\r\nshade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast; the man\r\nstanding before you, Valentine (for this time it is no ghost), is\r\nnothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend\r\nyou could dream of.”\r\n\r\nValentine could not reply; the voice which indicated the real presence\r\nof a being in the room, alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a\r\nsyllable; still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire, “If your\r\nintentions are pure, why are you here?” The count’s marvellous sagacity\r\nunderstood all that was passing in the young girl’s mind.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me,” he said, “or, rather, look upon me; look at my face,\r\npaler even than usual, and my eyes, red with weariness—for four days I\r\nhave not closed them, for I have been constantly watching you, to\r\nprotect and preserve you for Maximilian.”\r\n\r\nThe blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of Valentine, for the name just\r\nannounced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence\r\nhad inspired her.\r\n\r\n“Maximilian!” she exclaimed, and so sweet did the sound appear to her,\r\nthat she repeated it—“Maximilian!—has he then owned all to you?”\r\n\r\n“Everything. He told me your life was his, and I have promised him that\r\nyou shall live.”\r\n\r\n“You have promised him that I shall live?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But, sir, you spoke of vigilance and protection. Are you a doctor?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; the best you could have at the present time, believe me.”\r\n\r\n“But you say you have watched?” said Valentine uneasily; “where have\r\nyou been?—I have not seen you.”\r\n\r\nThe count extended his hand towards the library.\r\n\r\n“I was hidden behind that door,” he said, “which leads into the next\r\nhouse, which I have rented.”\r\n\r\nValentine turned her eyes away, and, with an indignant expression of\r\npride and modest fear, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Sir, I think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion, and\r\nthat what you call protection is more like an insult.”\r\n\r\n“Valentine,” he answered, “during my long watch over you, all I have\r\nobserved has been what people visited you, what nourishment was\r\nprepared, and what beverage was served; then, when the latter appeared\r\ndangerous to me, I entered, as I have now done, and substituted, in the\r\nplace of the poison, a healthful draught; which, instead of producing\r\nthe death intended, caused life to circulate in your veins.”\r\n\r\n“Poison—death!” exclaimed Valentine, half believing herself under the\r\ninfluence of some feverish hallucination; “what are you saying, sir?”\r\n\r\n50071m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hush, my child,” said Monte Cristo, again placing his finger upon her\r\nlips, “I did say poison and death. But drink some of this;” and the\r\ncount took a bottle from his pocket, containing a red liquid, of which\r\nhe poured a few drops into the glass. “Drink this, and then take\r\nnothing more tonight.”\r\n\r\nValentine stretched out her hand, but scarcely had she touched the\r\nglass when she drew back in fear. Monte Cristo took the glass, drank\r\nhalf its contents, and then presented it to Valentine, who smiled and\r\nswallowed the rest.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” she exclaimed, “I recognize the flavor of my nocturnal\r\nbeverage which refreshed me so much, and seemed to ease my aching\r\nbrain. Thank you, sir, thank you!”\r\n\r\n“This is how you have lived during the last four nights, Valentine,”\r\nsaid the count. “But, oh, how I passed that time! Oh, the wretched\r\nhours I have endured—the torture to which I have submitted when I saw\r\nthe deadly poison poured into your glass, and how I trembled lest you\r\nshould drink it before I could find time to throw it away!”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Valentine, at the height of her terror, “you say you\r\nendured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass;\r\nbut if you saw this, you must also have seen the person who poured it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nValentine raised herself in bed, and drew over her chest, which\r\nappeared whiter than snow, the embroidered cambric, still moist with\r\nthe cold dews of delirium, to which were now added those of terror.\r\n“You saw the person?” repeated the young girl.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” repeated the count.\r\n\r\n“What you tell me is horrible, sir. You wish to make me believe\r\nsomething too dreadful. What?—attempt to murder me in my father’s\r\nhouse, in my room, on my bed of sickness? Oh, leave me, sir; you are\r\ntempting me—you make me doubt the goodness of Providence—it is\r\nimpossible, it cannot be!”\r\n\r\n“Are you the first that this hand has stricken? Have you not seen M. de\r\nSaint-Méran, Madame de Saint-Méran, Barrois, all fall? Would not M.\r\nNoirtier also have fallen a victim, had not the treatment he has been\r\npursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the\r\npoison?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Heaven,” said Valentine; “is this the reason why grandpapa has\r\nmade me share all his beverages during the last month?”\r\n\r\n“And have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor, like that of\r\ndried orange-peel?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, yes!”\r\n\r\n“Then that explains all,” said Monte Cristo. “Your grandfather knows,\r\nthen, that a poisoner lives here; perhaps he even suspects the person.\r\nHe has been fortifying you, his beloved child, against the fatal\r\neffects of the poison, which has failed because your system was already\r\nimpregnated with it. But even this would have availed little against a\r\nmore deadly medium of death employed four days ago, which is generally\r\nbut too fatal.”\r\n\r\n“But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?”\r\n\r\n“Let me also ask you a question. Have you never seen anyone enter your\r\nroom at night?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; I have frequently seen shadows pass close to me, approach,\r\nand disappear; but I took them for visions raised by my feverish\r\nimagination, and indeed when you entered I thought I was under the\r\ninfluence of delirium.”\r\n\r\n“Then you do not know who it is that attempts your life?”\r\n\r\n50073m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No,” said Valentine; “who could desire my death?”\r\n\r\n“You shall know it now, then,” said Monte Cristo, listening.\r\n\r\n“How do you mean?” said Valentine, looking anxiously around.\r\n\r\n“Because you are not feverish or delirious tonight, but thoroughly\r\nawake; midnight is striking, which is the hour murderers choose.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, heavens,” exclaimed Valentine, wiping off the drops which ran down\r\nher forehead. Midnight struck slowly and sadly; every hour seemed to\r\nstrike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl.\r\n\r\n“Valentine,” said the count, “summon up all your courage; still the\r\nbeatings of your heart; do not let a sound escape you, and feign to be\r\nasleep; then you will see.”\r\n\r\nValentine seized the count’s hand. “I think I hear a noise,” she said;\r\n“leave me.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, for the present,” replied the count, walking upon tiptoe\r\ntowards the library door, and smiling with an expression so sad and\r\npaternal that the young girl’s heart was filled with gratitude.\r\n\r\nBefore closing the door he turned around once more, and said, “Not a\r\nmovement—not a word; let them think you asleep, or perhaps you may be\r\nkilled before I have the power of helping you.”\r\n\r\nAnd with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the\r\ndoor, which noiselessly closed after him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 101. Locusta\r\n\r\nValentine was alone; two other clocks, slower than that of\r\nSaint-Philippe-du-Roule, struck the hour of midnight from different\r\ndirections, and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was\r\nsilent. Then Valentine’s attention was engrossed by the clock in her\r\nroom, which marked the seconds. She began counting them, remarking that\r\nthey were much slower than the beatings of her heart; and still she\r\ndoubted,—the inoffensive Valentine could not imagine that anyone should\r\ndesire her death. Why should they? To what end? What had she done to\r\nexcite the malice of an enemy?\r\n\r\nThere was no fear of her falling asleep. One terrible idea pressed upon\r\nher mind,—that someone existed in the world who had attempted to\r\nassassinate her, and who was about to endeavor to do so again.\r\nSupposing this person, wearied at the inefficacy of the poison, should,\r\nas Monte Cristo intimated, have recourse to steel!—What if the count\r\nshould have no time to run to her rescue!—What if her last moments were\r\napproaching, and she should never again see Morrel!\r\n\r\nWhen this terrible chain of ideas presented itself, Valentine was\r\nnearly persuaded to ring the bell, and call for help. But through the\r\ndoor she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count—that eye which\r\nlived in her memory, and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much\r\nshame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever\r\nrepay his adventurous and devoted friendship.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes, twenty tedious minutes, passed thus, then ten more, and\r\nat last the clock struck the half-hour.\r\n\r\nJust then the sound of finger-nails slightly grating against the door\r\nof the library informed Valentine that the count was still watching,\r\nand recommended her to do the same; at the same time, on the opposite\r\nside, that is towards Edward’s room, Valentine fancied that she heard\r\nthe creaking of the floor; she listened attentively, holding her breath\r\ntill she was nearly suffocated; the lock turned, and the door slowly\r\nopened. Valentine had raised herself upon her elbow, and had scarcely\r\ntime to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm;\r\nthen, trembling, agitated, and her heart beating with indescribable\r\nterror, she awaited the event.\r\n\r\nSomeone approached the bed and drew back the curtains. Valentine\r\nsummoned every effort, and breathed with that regular respiration which\r\nannounces tranquil sleep.\r\n\r\n“Valentine!” said a low voice.\r\n\r\nThe girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply.\r\n\r\n“Valentine,” repeated the same voice.\r\n\r\nStill silent: Valentine had promised not to wake. Then everything was\r\nstill, excepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of\r\nsome liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied. Then she\r\nventured to open her eyelids, and glance over her extended arm. She saw\r\na woman in a white dressing-gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her\r\nglass. During this short time Valentine must have held her breath, or\r\nmoved in some slight degree, for the woman, disturbed, stopped and\r\nleaned over the bed, in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine\r\nslept: it was Madame de Villefort.\r\n\r\nOn recognizing her step-mother, Valentine could not repress a shudder,\r\nwhich caused a vibration in the bed. Madame de Villefort instantly\r\nstepped back close to the wall, and there, shaded by the bed-curtains,\r\nshe silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of\r\nValentine. The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo;\r\nshe fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp\r\nknife. Then collecting all her remaining strength, she forced herself\r\nto close her eyes; but this simple operation upon the most delicate\r\norgans of our frame, generally so easy to accomplish, became almost\r\nimpossible at this moment, so much did curiosity struggle to retain the\r\neyelid open and learn the truth. Madame de Villefort, however,\r\nreassured by the silence, which was alone disturbed by the regular\r\nbreathing of Valentine, again extended her hand, and half hidden by the\r\ncurtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the\r\nglass. Then she retired so gently that Valentine did not know she had\r\nleft the room. She only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm—the fair\r\nround arm of a woman but twenty-five years old, and who yet spread\r\ndeath around her.\r\n\r\n50077m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine\r\nduring the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the room.\r\n\r\nThe grating against the library-door aroused the young girl from the\r\nstupor in which she was plunged, and which almost amounted to\r\ninsensibility. She raised her head with an effort. The noiseless door\r\nagain turned on its hinges, and the Count of Monte Cristo reappeared.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “do you still doubt?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” murmured the young girl.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen?”\r\n\r\n“Alas!”\r\n\r\n“Did you recognize?” Valentine groaned.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes;” she said, “I saw, but I cannot believe!”\r\n\r\n“Would you rather die, then, and cause Maximilian’s death?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” repeated the young girl, almost bewildered, “can I not leave the\r\nhouse?—can I not escape?”\r\n\r\n“Valentine, the hand which now threatens you will pursue you\r\neverywhere; your servants will be seduced with gold, and death will be\r\noffered to you disguised in every shape. You will find it in the water\r\nyou drink from the spring, in the fruit you pluck from the tree.”\r\n\r\n“But did you not say that my kind grandfather’s precaution had\r\nneutralized the poison?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but not against a strong dose; the poison will be changed, and\r\nthe quantity increased.” He took the glass and raised it to his lips.\r\n“It is already done,” he said; “brucine is no longer employed, but a\r\nsimple narcotic! I can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it\r\nhas been dissolved. If you had taken what Madame de Villefort has\r\npoured into your glass, Valentine—Valentine—you would have been\r\ndoomed!”\r\n\r\n“But,” exclaimed the young girl, “why am I thus pursued?”\r\n\r\n“Why?—are you so kind—so good—so unsuspicious of ill, that you cannot\r\nunderstand, Valentine?”\r\n\r\n“No, I have never injured her.”\r\n\r\n“But you are rich, Valentine; you have 200,000 livres a year, and you\r\nprevent her son from enjoying these 200,000 livres.”\r\n\r\n“How so? The fortune is not her gift, but is inherited from my\r\nrelations.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; and that is why M. and Madame de Saint-Méran have died;\r\nthat is why M. Noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir;\r\nthat is why you, in your turn, are to die—it is because your father\r\nwould inherit your property, and your brother, his only son, succeed to\r\nhis.”\r\n\r\n“Edward? Poor child! Are all these crimes committed on his account?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, then you at length understand?”\r\n\r\n“Heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him!”\r\n\r\n“Valentine, you are an angel!”\r\n\r\n“But why is my grandfather allowed to live?”\r\n\r\n“It was considered, that you dead, the fortune would naturally revert\r\nto your brother, unless he were disinherited; and besides, the crime\r\nappearing useless, it would be folly to commit it.”\r\n\r\n“And is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been\r\ninvented by a woman?”\r\n\r\n“Do you recollect in the arbor of the Hôtel des Postes, at Perugia,\r\nseeing a man in a brown cloak, whom your stepmother was questioning\r\nupon _aqua tofana_? Well, ever since then, the infernal project has\r\nbeen ripening in her brain.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, then, indeed, sir,” said the sweet girl, bathed in tears, “I see\r\nthat I am condemned to die!”\r\n\r\n“No, Valentine, for I have foreseen all their plots; no, your enemy is\r\nconquered since we know her, and you will live, Valentine—live to be\r\nhappy yourself, and to confer happiness upon a noble heart; but to\r\ninsure this you must rely on me.”\r\n\r\n“Command me, sir—what am I to do?”\r\n\r\n“You must blindly take what I give you.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, were it only for my own sake, I should prefer to die!”\r\n\r\n“You must not confide in anyone—not even in your father.”\r\n\r\n“My father is not engaged in this fearful plot, is he, sir?” asked\r\nValentine, clasping her hands.\r\n\r\n“No; and yet your father, a man accustomed to judicial accusations,\r\nought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally;\r\nit is he who should have watched over you—he should have occupied my\r\nplace—he should have emptied that glass—he should have risen against\r\nthe assassin. Spectre against spectre!” he murmured in a low voice, as\r\nhe concluded his sentence.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Valentine, “I will do all I can to live, for there are two\r\nbeings who love me and will die if I die—my grandfather and\r\nMaximilian.”\r\n\r\n“I will watch over them as I have over you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, do as you will with me;” and then she added, in a low\r\nvoice, “oh, heavens, what will befall me?”\r\n\r\n“Whatever may happen, Valentine, do not be alarmed; though you suffer;\r\nthough you lose sight, hearing, consciousness, fear nothing; though you\r\nshould awake and be ignorant where you are, still do not fear; even\r\nthough you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin.\r\nReassure yourself, then, and say to yourself: ‘At this moment, a\r\nfriend, a father, who lives for my happiness and that of Maximilian,\r\nwatches over me!’”\r\n\r\n“Alas, alas, what a fearful extremity!”\r\n\r\n“Valentine, would you rather denounce your stepmother?”\r\n\r\n“I would rather die a hundred times—oh, yes, die!”\r\n\r\n“No, you will not die; but will you promise me, whatever happens, that\r\nyou will not complain, but hope?”\r\n\r\n“I will think of Maximilian!”\r\n\r\n“You are my own darling child, Valentine! I alone can save you, and I\r\nwill.”\r\n\r\nValentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands,—for she felt\r\nthat the moment had arrived to ask for courage,—and began to pray, and\r\nwhile uttering little more than incoherent words, she forgot that her\r\nwhite shoulders had no other covering than her long hair, and that the\r\npulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her\r\nnightdress. Monte Cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl’s arm,\r\ndrew the velvet coverlet close to her throat, and said with a paternal\r\nsmile:\r\n\r\n“My child, believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness\r\nof Providence and the love of Maximilian.” Valentine gave him a look\r\nfull of gratitude, and remained as docile as a child.\r\n\r\nThen he drew from his waistcoat-pocket the little emerald box, raised\r\nthe golden lid, and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea,\r\nwhich he placed in her hand. She took it, and looked attentively on the\r\ncount; there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector\r\nwhich commanded her veneration. She evidently interrogated him by her\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said he.\r\n\r\nValentine carried the pastille to her mouth, and swallowed it.\r\n\r\n“And now, my dear child, adieu for the present. I will try and gain a\r\nlittle sleep, for you are saved.”\r\n\r\n“Go,” said Valentine, “whatever happens, I promise you not to fear.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl, who\r\ngradually fell asleep, yielding to the effects of the narcotic the\r\ncount had given her. Then he took the glass, emptied three parts of the\r\ncontents in the fireplace, that it might be supposed Valentine had\r\ntaken it, and replaced it on the table; then he disappeared, after\r\nthrowing a farewell glance on Valentine, who slept with the confidence\r\nand innocence of an angel at the feet of the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 102. Valentine\r\n\r\nThe night-light continued to burn on the chimney-piece, exhausting the\r\nlast drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water. The globe\r\nof the lamp appeared of a reddish hue, and the flame, brightening\r\nbefore it expired, threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate\r\nobject have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human\r\ncreature in its final agonies. A dull and dismal light was shed over\r\nthe bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl. All noise in\r\nthe streets had ceased, and the silence was frightful.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the door of Edward’s room opened, and a head we have\r\nbefore noticed appeared in the glass opposite; it was Madame de\r\nVillefort, who came to witness the effects of the drink she had\r\nprepared. She stopped in the doorway, listened for a moment to the\r\nflickering of the lamp, the only sound in that deserted room, and then\r\nadvanced to the table to see if Valentine’s glass were empty. It was\r\nstill about a quarter full, as we before stated. Madame de Villefort\r\nemptied the contents into the ashes, which she disturbed that they\r\nmight the more readily absorb the liquid; then she carefully rinsed the\r\nglass, and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table.\r\n\r\nIf anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have\r\nnoticed the hesitation with which Madame de Villefort approached the\r\nbed and looked fixedly on Valentine. The dim light, the profound\r\nsilence, and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour, and still more\r\nby her own conscience, all combined to produce a sensation of fear; the\r\npoisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work.\r\n\r\nAt length she rallied, drew aside the curtain, and leaning over the\r\npillow gazed intently on Valentine. The young girl no longer breathed,\r\nno breath issued through the half-closed teeth; the white lips no\r\nlonger quivered—the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor, and the\r\nlong black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax. Madame de Villefort\r\ngazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness; then she\r\nventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl’s\r\nheart. It was cold and motionless. She only felt the pulsation in her\r\nown fingers, and withdrew her hand with a shudder. One arm was hanging\r\nout of the bed; from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of\r\nGermain Pillon’s “Graces,”23 but the fore-arm seemed to be slightly\r\ndistorted by convulsion, and the hand, so delicately formed, was\r\nresting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed.\r\nThe nails, too, were turning blue.\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort had no longer any doubt; all was over—she had\r\nconsummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish. There was no\r\nmore to do in the room, so the poisoner retired stealthily, as though\r\nfearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps; but as she withdrew she\r\nstill held aside the curtain, absorbed in the irresistible attraction\r\nalways exerted by the picture of death, so long as it is merely\r\nmysterious and does not excite disgust.\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed; Madame de Villefort could not drop the curtain\r\nwhich she held like a funeral pall over the head of Valentine. She was\r\nlost in reverie, and the reverie of crime is remorse.\r\n\r\nJust then the lamp again flickered; the noise startled Madame de\r\nVillefort, who shuddered and dropped the curtain. Immediately\r\nafterwards the light expired, and the room was plunged in frightful\r\nobscurity, while the clock at that minute struck half-past four.\r\n\r\nOverpowered with agitation, the poisoner succeeded in groping her way\r\nto the door, and reached her room in an agony of fear. The darkness\r\nlasted two hours longer; then by degrees a cold light crept through the\r\nVenetian blinds, until at length it revealed the objects in the room.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the nurse’s cough was heard on the stairs and the woman\r\nentered the room with a cup in her hand. To the tender eye of a father\r\nor a lover, the first glance would have sufficed to reveal Valentine’s\r\ncondition; but to this hireling, Valentine only appeared to sleep.\r\n\r\n“Good,” she exclaimed, approaching the table, “she has taken part of\r\nher draught; the glass is three-quarters empty.”\r\n\r\nThen she went to the fireplace and lit the fire, and although she had\r\njust left her bed, she could not resist the temptation offered by\r\nValentine’s sleep, so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a\r\nlittle more rest. The clock striking eight awoke her. Astonished at the\r\nprolonged slumber of the patient, and frightened to see that the arm\r\nwas still hanging out of the bed, she advanced towards Valentine, and\r\nfor the first time noticed the white lips. She tried to replace the\r\narm, but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a\r\nsick-nurse. She screamed aloud; then running to the door exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Help, help!”\r\n\r\n50083m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” asked M. d’Avrigny, at the foot of the stairs, it\r\nbeing the hour he usually visited her.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Villefort, rushing from his room. “Doctor, do you\r\nhear them call for help?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; let us hasten up; it was in Valentine’s room.”\r\n\r\nBut before the doctor and the father could reach the room, the servants\r\nwho were on the same floor had entered, and seeing Valentine pale and\r\nmotionless on her bed, they lifted up their hands towards heaven and\r\nstood transfixed, as though struck by lightening.\r\n\r\n“Call Madame de Villefort!—Wake Madame de Villefort!” cried the\r\nprocureur from the door of his chamber, which apparently he scarcely\r\ndared to leave. But instead of obeying him, the servants stood watching\r\nM. d’Avrigny, who ran to Valentine, and raised her in his arms.\r\n\r\n“What?—this one, too?” he exclaimed. “Oh, where will be the end?”\r\n\r\nVillefort rushed into the room.\r\n\r\n“What are you saying, doctor?” he exclaimed, raising his hands to\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n“I say that Valentine is dead!” replied d’Avrigny, in a voice terrible\r\nin its solemn calmness.\r\n\r\n50085m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed. On the\r\nexclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father, the servants all\r\nfled with muttered imprecations; they were heard running down the\r\nstairs and through the long passages, then there was a rush in the\r\ncourt, afterwards all was still; they had, one and all, deserted the\r\naccursed house.\r\n\r\nJust then, Madame de Villefort, in the act of slipping on her\r\ndressing-gown, threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood\r\nmotionless, as though interrogating the occupants of the room, while\r\nshe endeavored to call up some rebellious tears. On a sudden she\r\nstepped, or rather bounded, with outstretched arms, towards the table.\r\nShe saw d’Avrigny curiously examining the glass, which she felt certain\r\nof having emptied during the night. It was now a third full, just as it\r\nwas when she threw the contents into the ashes. The spectre of\r\nValentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less. It\r\nwas, indeed, the same color as the draught she had poured into the\r\nglass, and which Valentine had drunk; it was indeed the poison, which\r\ncould not deceive M. d’Avrigny, which he now examined so closely; it\r\nwas doubtless a miracle from heaven, that, notwithstanding her\r\nprecautions, there should be some trace, some proof remaining to reveal\r\nthe crime.\r\n\r\nWhile Madame de Villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of\r\nterror, and Villefort, with his head hidden in the bedclothes, saw\r\nnothing around him, d’Avrigny approached the window, that he might the\r\nbetter examine the contents of the glass, and dipping the tip of his\r\nfinger in, tasted it.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” he exclaimed, “it is no longer brucine that is used; let me see\r\nwhat it is!”\r\n\r\nThen he ran to one of the cupboards in Valentine’s room, which had been\r\ntransformed into a medicine closet, and taking from its silver case a\r\nsmall bottle of nitric acid, dropped a little of it into the liquor,\r\nwhich immediately changed to a blood-red color.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” exclaimed d’Avrigny, in a voice in which the horror of a judge\r\nunveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort was overpowered; her eyes first flashed and then\r\nswam, she staggered towards the door and disappeared. Directly\r\nafterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground\r\nwas heard, but no one paid any attention to it; the nurse was engaged\r\nin watching the chemical analysis, and Villefort was still absorbed in\r\ngrief. M. d’Avrigny alone had followed Madame de Villefort with his\r\neyes, and watched her hurried retreat. He lifted up the drapery over\r\nthe entrance to Edward’s room, and his eye reaching as far as Madame de\r\nVillefort’s apartment, he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor.\r\n\r\n“Go to the assistance of Madame de Villefort,” he said to the nurse.\r\n“Madame de Villefort is ill.”\r\n\r\n50087m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“But Mademoiselle de Villefort——” stammered the nurse.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle de Villefort no longer requires help,” said d’Avrigny,\r\n“since she is dead.”\r\n\r\n“Dead,—dead!” groaned forth Villefort, in a paroxysm of grief, which\r\nwas the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron\r\nheart of that man.\r\n\r\n“Dead!” repeated a third voice. “Who said Valentine was dead?”\r\n\r\nThe two men turned round, and saw Morrel standing at the door, pale and\r\nterror-stricken. This is what had happened. At the usual time, Morrel\r\nhad presented himself at the little door leading to Noirtier’s room.\r\nContrary to custom, the door was open, and having no occasion to ring\r\nhe entered. He waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant\r\nto conduct him to M. Noirtier; but no one answered, the servants\r\nhaving, as we know, deserted the house. Morrel had no particular reason\r\nfor uneasiness; Monte Cristo had promised him that Valentine should\r\nlive, and so far he had always fulfilled his word. Every night the\r\ncount had given him news, which was the next morning confirmed by\r\nNoirtier. Still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him, and\r\nhe called a second and third time; still no answer. Then he determined\r\nto go up. Noirtier’s room was opened, like all the rest. The first\r\nthing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual\r\nplace, but his eyes expressed alarm, which was confirmed by the pallor\r\nwhich overspread his features.\r\n\r\n“How are you, sir?” asked Morrel, with a sickness of heart.\r\n\r\n“Well,” answered the old man, by closing his eyes; but his appearance\r\nmanifested increasing uneasiness.\r\n\r\n“You are thoughtful, sir,” continued Morrel; “you want something; shall\r\nI call one of the servants?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Noirtier.\r\n\r\nMorrel pulled the bell, but though he nearly broke the cord no one\r\nanswered. He turned towards Noirtier; the pallor and anguish expressed\r\non his countenance momentarily increased.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” exclaimed Morrel, “why do they not come? Is anyone ill in the\r\nhouse?” The eyes of Noirtier seemed as though they would start from\r\ntheir sockets. “What is the matter? You alarm me. Valentine?\r\nValentine?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” signed Noirtier.\r\n\r\nMaximilian tried to speak, but he could articulate nothing; he\r\nstaggered, and supported himself against the wainscot. Then he pointed\r\nto the door.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, yes!” continued the old man.\r\n\r\n50089m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaximilian rushed up the little staircase, while Noirtier’s eyes seemed\r\nto say,—“Quicker, quicker!”\r\n\r\nIn a minute the young man darted through several rooms, till at length\r\nhe reached Valentine’s.\r\n\r\nThere was no occasion to push the door, it was wide open. A sob was the\r\nonly sound he heard. He saw as though in a mist, a black figure\r\nkneeling and buried in a confused mass of white drapery. A terrible\r\nfear transfixed him. It was then he heard a voice exclaim “Valentine is\r\ndead!” and another voice which, like an echo repeated:\r\n\r\n“Dead,—dead!”\r\n\r\n50090m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 103. Maximilian\r\n\r\nVillefort rose, half-ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of\r\ngrief. The terrible office he had held for twenty-five years had\r\nsucceeded in making him more or less than man. His glance, at first\r\nwandering, fixed itself upon Morrel. “Who are you, sir,” he asked,\r\n“that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with\r\ndeath? Go, sir, go!”\r\n\r\nBut Morrel remained motionless; he could not detach his eyes from that\r\ndisordered bed, and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Go!—do you hear?” said Villefort, while d’Avrigny advanced to lead\r\nMorrel out. Maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse, gazed all\r\naround the room, then upon the two men; he opened his mouth to speak,\r\nbut finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas\r\nthat occupied his brain, he went out, thrusting his hands through his\r\nhair in such a manner that Villefort and d’Avrigny, for a moment\r\ndiverted from the engrossing topic, exchanged glances, which seemed to\r\nsay,—“He is mad!”\r\n\r\nBut in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an\r\nextraordinary weight. Morrel was seen carrying, with superhuman\r\nstrength, the armchair containing Noirtier upstairs. When he reached\r\nthe landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it\r\ninto Valentine’s room. This could only have been accomplished by means\r\nof unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement. But the most\r\nfearful spectacle was Noirtier being pushed towards the bed, his face\r\nexpressing all his meaning, and his eyes supplying the want of every\r\nother faculty. That pale face and flaming glance appeared to Villefort\r\nlike a frightful apparition. Each time he had been brought into contact\r\nwith his father, something terrible had happened.\r\n\r\n“See what they have done!” cried Morrel, with one hand leaning on the\r\nback of the chair, and the other extended towards Valentine. “See, my\r\nfather, see!”\r\n\r\nVillefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man, who,\r\nalmost a stranger to him, called Noirtier his father. At this moment\r\nthe whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became\r\nbloodshot; the veins of the throat swelled; his cheeks and temples\r\nbecame purple, as though he was struck with epilepsy; nothing was\r\nwanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry. And the cry issued\r\nfrom his pores, if we may thus speak—a cry frightful in its silence.\r\nD’Avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful\r\nrestorative.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” cried Morrel, seizing the moist hand of the paralytic, “they ask\r\nme who I am, and what right I have to be here. Oh, you know it, tell\r\nthem, tell them!” And the young man’s voice was choked by sobs.\r\n\r\nAs for the old man, his chest heaved with his panting respiration. One\r\ncould have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death.\r\nAt length, happier than the young man, who sobbed without weeping,\r\ntears glistened in the eyes of Noirtier.\r\n\r\n“Tell them,” said Morrel in a hoarse voice, “tell them that I am her\r\nbetrothed. Tell them she was my beloved, my noble girl, my only\r\nblessing in the world. Tell them—oh, tell them, that corpse belongs to\r\nme!”\r\n\r\nThe young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish, fell heavily on\r\nhis knees before the bed, which his fingers grasped with convulsive\r\nenergy. D’Avrigny, unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion,\r\nturned away; and Villefort, without seeking any further explanation,\r\nand attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us\r\ntowards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn, extended his\r\nhand towards the young man.\r\n\r\nBut Morrel saw nothing; he had grasped the hand of Valentine, and\r\nunable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets. For\r\nsome time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs, exclamations, and\r\nprayers. At length Villefort, the most composed of all, spoke:\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said he to Maximilian, “you say you loved Valentine, that you\r\nwere betrothed to her. I knew nothing of this engagement, of this love,\r\nyet I, her father, forgive you, for I see that your grief is real and\r\ndeep; and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place\r\nin my heart. But you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left\r\nthis earth—she has nothing more to do with the adoration of men. Take a\r\nlast farewell, sir, of her sad remains; take the hand you expected to\r\npossess once more within your own, and then separate yourself from her\r\nforever. Valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest.”\r\n\r\n50093m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, sir,” exclaimed Morrel, raising himself on one knee,\r\nhis heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet felt—“you\r\nare mistaken; Valentine, dying as she has, not only requires a priest,\r\nbut an avenger. _You_, M. de Villefort, send for the priest; _I_ will\r\nbe the avenger.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, sir?” asked Villefort, trembling at the new idea\r\ninspired by the delirium of Morrel.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, sir, that two persons exist in you; the father has mourned\r\nsufficiently, now let the procureur fulfil his office.”\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Noirtier glistened, and d’Avrigny approached.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Morrel, reading all that passed through the minds of\r\nthe witnesses to the scene, “I know what I am saying, and you know as\r\nwell as I do what I am about to say—Valentine has been assassinated!”\r\n\r\nVillefort hung his head, d’Avrigny approached nearer, and Noirtier said\r\n“Yes” with his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Now, sir,” continued Morrel, “in these days no one can disappear by\r\nviolent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her\r\ndisappearance, even were she not a young, beautiful, and adorable\r\ncreature like Valentine. Now, M. le Procureur du Roi,” said Morrel with\r\nincreasing vehemence, “no mercy is allowed; I denounce the crime; it is\r\nyour place to seek the assassin.”\r\n\r\nThe young man’s implacable eyes interrogated Villefort, who, on his\r\nside, glanced from Noirtier to d’Avrigny. But instead of finding\r\nsympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father, he only saw an\r\nexpression as inflexible as that of Maximilian.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” indicated the old man.\r\n\r\n“Assuredly,” said d’Avrigny.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Villefort, striving to struggle against this triple force\r\nand his own emotion,—“sir, you are deceived; no one commits crimes\r\nhere. I am stricken by fate. It is horrible, indeed, but no one\r\nassassinates.”\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Noirtier lighted up with rage, and d’Avrigny prepared to\r\nspeak. Morrel, however, extended his arm, and commanded silence.\r\n\r\n“And I say that murders _are_ committed here,” said Morrel, whose\r\nvoice, though lower in tone, lost none of its terrible distinctness: “I\r\ntell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months. I\r\ntell you, Valentine’s life was attempted by poison four days ago,\r\nthough she escaped, owing to the precautions of M. Noirtier. I tell you\r\nthat the dose has been double, the poison changed, and that this time\r\nit has succeeded. I tell you that you know these things as well as I\r\ndo, since this gentleman has forewarned you, both as a doctor and as a\r\nfriend.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you rave, sir,” exclaimed Villefort, in vain endeavoring to escape\r\nthe net in which he was taken.\r\n\r\n50095m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I rave?” said Morrel; “well, then, I appeal to M. d’Avrigny himself.\r\nAsk him, sir, if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of\r\nthis house on the night of Madame de Saint-Méran’s death. You thought\r\nyourselves alone, and talked about that tragical death, and the\r\nfatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of\r\nValentine.” Villefort and d’Avrigny exchanged looks.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” continued Morrel; “recall the scene, for the words you\r\nthought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears.\r\nCertainly, after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by M. de\r\nVillefort towards his own relations, I ought to have denounced him to\r\nthe authorities; then I should not have been an accomplice to thy\r\ndeath, as I now am, sweet, beloved Valentine; but the accomplice shall\r\nbecome the avenger. This fourth murder is apparent to all, and if thy\r\nfather abandon thee, Valentine, it is I, and I swear it, that shall\r\npursue the assassin.”\r\n\r\nAnd this time, as though nature had at least taken compassion on the\r\nvigorous frame, nearly bursting with its own strength, the words of\r\nMorrel were stifled in his throat; his breast heaved; the tears, so\r\nlong rebellious, gushed from his eyes; and he threw himself weeping on\r\nhis knees by the side of the bed.\r\n\r\nThen d’Avrigny spoke. “And I, too,” he exclaimed in a low voice, “I\r\nunite with M. Morrel in demanding justice for crime; my blood boils at\r\nthe idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, merciful Heavens!” murmured Villefort. Morrel raised his head, and\r\nreading the eyes of the old man, which gleamed with unnatural lustre,—\r\n\r\n“Stay,” he said, “M. Noirtier wishes to speak.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” indicated Noirtier, with an expression the more terrible, from\r\nall his faculties being centred in his glance.\r\n\r\n“Do you know the assassin?” asked Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Noirtier.\r\n\r\n“And will you direct us?” exclaimed the young man. “Listen, M.\r\nd’Avrigny, listen!”\r\n\r\nNoirtier looked upon Morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which\r\nhad so often made Valentine happy, and thus fixed his attention. Then,\r\nhaving riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own, he glanced\r\ntowards the door.\r\n\r\n“Do you wish me to leave?” said Morrel, sadly.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Noirtier.\r\n\r\n“Alas, alas, sir, have pity on me!”\r\n\r\nThe old man’s eyes remained fixed on the door.\r\n\r\n“May I, at least, return?” asked Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Must I leave alone?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Whom am I to take with me? The procureur?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“The doctor?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You wish to remain alone with M. de Villefort?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But can he understand you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Villefort, inexpressibly delighted to think that the\r\ninquiries were to be made by him alone,—“oh, be satisfied, I can\r\nunderstand my father.” While uttering these words with this expression\r\nof joy, his teeth clashed together violently.\r\n\r\nD’Avrigny took the young man’s arm, and led him out of the room. A more\r\nthan deathlike silence then reigned in the house. At the end of a\r\nquarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard, and Villefort\r\nappeared at the door of the apartment where d’Avrigny and Morrel had\r\nbeen staying, one absorbed in meditation, the other in grief.\r\n\r\n“You can come,” he said, and led them back to Noirtier.\r\n\r\nMorrel looked attentively on Villefort. His face was livid, large drops\r\nrolled down his face, and in his fingers he held the fragments of a\r\nquill pen which he had torn to atoms.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said in a hoarse voice, “give me your word of honor\r\nthat this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst\r\nourselves!” The two men drew back.\r\n\r\n“I entreat you——” continued Villefort.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Morrel, “the culprit—the murderer—the assassin.”\r\n\r\n“Do not alarm yourself, sir; justice will be done,” said Villefort. “My\r\nfather has revealed the culprit’s name; my father thirsts for revenge\r\nas much as you do, yet even he conjures you as I do to keep this\r\nsecret. Do you not, father?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” resolutely replied Noirtier. Morrel suffered an exclamation of\r\nhorror and surprise to escape him.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir,” said Villefort, arresting Maximilian by the arm, “if my\r\nfather, the inflexible man, makes this request, it is because he knows,\r\nbe assured, that Valentine will be terribly revenged. Is it not so,\r\nfather?”\r\n\r\nThe old man made a sign in the affirmative. Villefort continued:\r\n\r\n“He knows me, and I have pledged my word to him. Rest assured,\r\ngentlemen, that within three days, in a less time than justice would\r\ndemand, the revenge I shall have taken for the murder of my child will\r\nbe such as to make the boldest heart tremble;” and as he spoke these\r\nwords he ground his teeth, and grasped the old man’s senseless hand.\r\n\r\n“Will this promise be fulfilled, M. Noirtier?” asked Morrel, while\r\nd’Avrigny looked inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister joy.\r\n\r\n“Swear, then,” said Villefort, joining the hands of Morrel and\r\nd’Avrigny, “swear that you will spare the honor of my house, and leave\r\nme to avenge my child.”\r\n\r\nD’Avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble “Yes,” but Morrel,\r\ndisengaging his hand, rushed to the bed, and after having pressed the\r\ncold lips of Valentine with his own, hurriedly left, uttering a long,\r\ndeep groan of despair and anguish.\r\n\r\nWe have before stated that all the servants had fled. M. de Villefort\r\nwas therefore obliged to request M. d’Avrigny to superintend all the\r\narrangements consequent upon a death in a large city, more especially a\r\ndeath under such suspicious circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt was something terrible to witness the silent agony, the mute despair\r\nof Noirtier, whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks. Villefort\r\nretired to his study, and d’Avrigny left to summon the doctor of the\r\nmayoralty, whose office it is to examine bodies after decease, and who\r\nis expressly named “the doctor of the dead.” M. Noirtier could not be\r\npersuaded to quit his grandchild. At the end of a quarter of an hour M.\r\nd’Avrigny returned with his associate; they found the outer gate\r\nclosed, and not a servant remaining in the house; Villefort himself was\r\nobliged to open to them. But he stopped on the landing; he had not the\r\ncourage to again visit the death chamber. The two doctors, therefore,\r\nentered the room alone. Noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless,\r\nand silent as the corpse. The district doctor approached with the\r\nindifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the\r\ndead; he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face, and just\r\nunclosed the lips.\r\n\r\n“Alas,” said d’Avrigny, “she is indeed dead, poor child!”\r\n\r\n50099m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered the doctor laconically, dropping the sheet he had\r\nraised. Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse, rattling sound; the old\r\nman’s eyes sparkled, and the good doctor understood that he wished to\r\nbehold his child. He therefore approached the bed, and while his\r\ncompanion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of\r\nthe corpse in chloride of lime, he uncovered the calm and pale face,\r\nwhich looked like that of a sleeping angel.\r\n\r\nA tear, which appeared in the old man’s eye, expressed his thanks to\r\nthe doctor. The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner\r\nof the table, and having fulfilled his duty, was conducted out by\r\nd’Avrigny. Villefort met them at the door of his study; having in a few\r\nwords thanked the district doctor, he turned to d’Avrigny, and said:\r\n\r\n“And now the priest.”\r\n\r\n“Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine?” asked\r\nd’Avrigny.\r\n\r\n“No.” said Villefort; “fetch the nearest.”\r\n\r\n“The nearest,” said the district doctor, “is a good Italian abbé, who\r\nlives next door to you. Shall I call on him as I pass?”\r\n\r\n“D’Avrigny,” said Villefort, “be so kind, I beseech you, as to\r\naccompany this gentleman. Here is the key of the door, so that you can\r\ngo in and out as you please; you will bring the priest with you, and\r\nwill oblige me by introducing him into my child’s room.”\r\n\r\n50101m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Do you wish to see him?”\r\n\r\n“I only wish to be alone. You will excuse me, will you not? A priest\r\ncan understand a father’s grief.”\r\n\r\nAnd M. de Villefort, giving the key to d’Avrigny, again bade farewell\r\nto the strange doctor, and retired to his study, where he began to\r\nwork. For some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions.\r\n\r\nAs the doctors entered the street, they saw a man in a cassock standing\r\non the threshold of the next door.\r\n\r\n“This is the abbé of whom I spoke,” said the doctor to d’Avrigny.\r\nD’Avrigny accosted the priest.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” he said, “are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an\r\nunhappy father who has just lost his daughter? I mean M. de Villefort,\r\nthe king’s attorney.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the priest, in a marked Italian accent; “yes, I have heard\r\nthat death is in that house.”\r\n\r\n“Then I need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you.”\r\n\r\n“I was about to offer myself, sir,” said the priest; “it is our mission\r\nto forestall our duties.”\r\n\r\n“It is a young girl.”\r\n\r\n“I know it, sir; the servants who fled from the house informed me. I\r\nalso know that her name is Valentine, and I have already prayed for\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir,” said d’Avrigny; “since you have commenced your sacred\r\noffice, deign to continue it. Come and watch by the dead, and all the\r\nwretched family will be grateful to you.”\r\n\r\n“I am going, sir; and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be\r\nmore fervent than mine.”\r\n\r\nD’Avrigny took the priest’s hand, and without meeting Villefort, who\r\nwas engaged in his study, they reached Valentine’s room, which on the\r\nfollowing night was to be occupied by the undertakers. On entering the\r\nroom, Noirtier’s eyes met those of the abbé, and no doubt he read some\r\nparticular expression in them, for he remained in the room. D’Avrigny\r\nrecommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the\r\ndead, and the abbé promised to devote his prayers to Valentine and his\r\nattentions to Noirtier.\r\n\r\nIn order, doubtless, that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling\r\nhis sacred mission, the priest rose as soon as d’Avrigny departed, and\r\nnot only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left, but\r\nalso that leading to Madame de Villefort’s room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 104. Danglars’ Signature\r\n\r\nThe next morning dawned dull and cloudy. During the night the\r\nundertakers had executed their melancholy office, and wrapped the\r\ncorpse in the winding-sheet, which, whatever may be said about the\r\nequality of death, is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing\r\nin life. This winding-sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of\r\ncambric, which the young girl had bought a fortnight before.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening two men, engaged for the purpose, had carried\r\nNoirtier from Valentine’s room into his own, and contrary to all\r\nexpectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child.\r\nThe Abbé Busoni had watched till daylight, and then left without\r\ncalling anyone. D’Avrigny returned about eight o’clock in the morning;\r\nhe met Villefort on his way to Noirtier’s room, and accompanied him to\r\nsee how the old man had slept. They found him in the large armchair,\r\nwhich served him for a bed, enjoying a calm, nay, almost a smiling\r\nsleep. They both stood in amazement at the door.\r\n\r\n“See,” said d’Avrigny to Villefort, “nature knows how to alleviate the\r\ndeepest sorrow. No one can say that M. Noirtier did not love his child,\r\nand yet he sleeps.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you are right,” replied Villefort, surprised; “he sleeps, indeed!\r\nAnd this is the more strange, since the least contradiction keeps him\r\nawake all night.”\r\n\r\n“Grief has stunned him,” replied d’Avrigny; and they both returned\r\nthoughtfully to the procureur’s study.\r\n\r\n“See, I have not slept,” said Villefort, showing his undisturbed bed;\r\n“grief does not stun me. I have not been in bed for two nights; but\r\nthen look at my desk; see what I have written during these two days and\r\nnights. I have filled those papers, and have made out the accusation\r\nagainst the assassin Benedetto. Oh, work, work,—my passion, my joy, my\r\ndelight,—it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows!” and he convulsively\r\ngrasped the hand of d’Avrigny.\r\n\r\n“Do you require my services now?” asked d’Avrigny.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Villefort; “only return again at eleven o’clock; at twelve\r\nthe—the—oh, Heavens, my poor, poor child!” and the procureur again\r\nbecoming a man, lifted up his eyes and groaned.\r\n\r\n“Shall you be present in the reception-room?”\r\n\r\n“No; I have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office. I shall work,\r\ndoctor—when I work I forget everything.”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, no sooner had the doctor left the room, than he was again\r\nabsorbed in work. On the doorsteps d’Avrigny met the cousin whom\r\nVillefort had mentioned, a personage as insignificant in our story as\r\nin the world he occupied—one of those beings designed from their birth\r\nto make themselves useful to others. He was punctual, dressed in black,\r\nwith crape around his hat, and presented himself at his cousin’s with a\r\nface made up for the occasion, and which he could alter as might be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o’clock the mourning-coaches rolled into the paved court, and\r\nthe Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré was filled with a crowd of idlers,\r\nequally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich,\r\nand who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the\r\nmarriage of a duchess.\r\n\r\nGradually the reception-room filled, and some of our old friends made\r\ntheir appearance—we mean Debray, Château-Renaud, and Beauchamp,\r\naccompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar, in\r\nliterature, or the army, for M. de Villefort moved in the first\r\nParisian circles, less owing to his social position than to his\r\npersonal merit.\r\n\r\nThe cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests, and it was\r\nrather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as\r\nthemselves, and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears, as\r\nwould have been the case with a father, a brother, or a lover. Those\r\nwho were acquainted soon formed into little groups. One of them was\r\nmade of Debray, Château-Renaud, and Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Poor girl,” said Debray, like the rest, paying an involuntary tribute\r\nto the sad event,—“poor girl, so young, so rich, so beautiful! Could\r\nyou have imagined this scene, Château-Renaud, when we saw her, at the\r\nmost three weeks ago, about to sign that contract?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, no,” said Château-Renaud.”\r\n\r\n“Did you know her?”\r\n\r\n“I spoke to her once or twice at Madame de Morcerf’s, among the rest;\r\nshe appeared to me charming, though rather melancholy. Where is her\r\nstepmother? Do you know?”\r\n\r\n“She is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is\r\nreceiving us.”\r\n\r\n50105m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“Whom do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“The gentleman who receives us? Is he a deputy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no. I am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day,” said\r\nBeauchamp; “but he is perfectly unknown to me.”\r\n\r\n“Have you mentioned this death in your paper?”\r\n\r\n“It has been mentioned, but the article is not mine; indeed, I doubt if\r\nit will please M. Villefort, for it says that if four successive deaths\r\nhad happened anywhere else than in the house of the king’s attorney, he\r\nwould have interested himself somewhat more about it.”\r\n\r\n“Still,” said Château-Renaud, “Dr. d’Avrigny, who attends my mother,\r\ndeclares he is in despair about it. But whom are you seeking, Debray?”\r\n\r\n“I am seeking the Count of Monte Cristo” said the young man.\r\n\r\n“I met him on the boulevard, on my way here,” said Beauchamp. “I think\r\nhe is about to leave Paris; he was going to his banker.”\r\n\r\n“His banker? Danglars is his banker, is he not?” asked Château-Renaud\r\nof Debray.\r\n\r\n“I believe so,” replied the secretary with slight uneasiness. “But\r\nMonte Cristo is not the only one I miss here; I do not see Morrel.”\r\n\r\n“Morrel? Do they know him?” asked Château-Renaud. “I think he has only\r\nbeen introduced to Madame de Villefort.”\r\n\r\n“Still, he ought to have been here,” said Debray; “I wonder what will\r\nbe talked about tonight; this funeral is the news of the day. But hush,\r\nhere comes our minister of justice; he will feel obliged to make some\r\nlittle speech to the cousin,” and the three young men drew near to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\nBeauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he\r\nhad met Monte Cristo, who was directing his steps towards the Rue de la\r\nChaussée d’Antin, to M. Danglars’. The banker saw the carriage of the\r\ncount enter the courtyard, and advanced to meet him with a sad, though\r\naffable smile.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, extending his hand to Monte Cristo, “I suppose you\r\nhave come to sympathize with me, for indeed misfortune has taken\r\npossession of my house. When I perceived you, I was just asking myself\r\nwhether I had not wished harm towards those poor Morcerfs, which would\r\nhave justified the proverb of ‘He who wishes misfortunes to happen to\r\nothers experiences them himself.’ Well, on my word of honor, I\r\nanswered, ‘No!’ I wished no ill to Morcerf; he was a little proud,\r\nperhaps, for a man who like myself has risen from nothing; but we all\r\nhave our faults. Do you know, count, that persons of our time of\r\nlife—not that you belong to the class, you are still a young man,—but\r\nas I was saying, persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate\r\nthis year. For example, look at the puritanical procureur, who has just\r\nlost his daughter, and in fact nearly all his family, in so singular a\r\nmanner; Morcerf dishonored and dead; and then myself covered with\r\nridicule through the villany of Benedetto; besides——”\r\n\r\n“Besides what?” asked the Count.\r\n\r\n“Alas, do you not know?”\r\n\r\n“What new calamity?”\r\n\r\n“My daughter——”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle Danglars?”\r\n\r\n“Eugénie has left us!”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens, what are you telling me?”\r\n\r\n“The truth, my dear count. Oh, how happy you must be in not having\r\neither wife or children!”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I do.”\r\n\r\n“And so Mademoiselle Danglars——”\r\n\r\n“She could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch, so she\r\nasked permission to travel.”\r\n\r\n“And is she gone?”\r\n\r\n“The other night she left.”\r\n\r\n“With Madame Danglars?”\r\n\r\n“No, with a relation. But still, we have quite lost our dear Eugénie;\r\nfor I doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to France.”\r\n\r\n“Still, baron,” said Monte Cristo, “family griefs, or indeed any other\r\naffliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure,\r\nare endurable to a millionaire. Philosophers may well say, and\r\npractical men will always support the opinion, that money mitigates\r\nmany trials; and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm, you\r\nought to be very easily consoled—you, the king of finance, the focus of\r\nimmeasurable power.”\r\n\r\nDanglars looked at him askance, as though to ascertain whether he spoke\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered, “if a fortune brings consolation, I ought to be\r\nconsoled; I am rich.”\r\n\r\n“So rich, dear sir, that your fortune resembles the pyramids; if you\r\nwished to demolish them you could not, and if it were possible, you\r\nwould not dare!”\r\n\r\nDanglars smiled at the good-natured pleasantry of the count. “That\r\nreminds me,” he said, “that when you entered I was on the point of\r\nsigning five little bonds; I have already signed two: will you allow me\r\nto do the same to the others?”\r\n\r\n“Pray do so.”\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s silence, during which the noise of the banker’s\r\npen was alone heard, while Monte Cristo examined the gilt mouldings on\r\nthe ceiling.\r\n\r\n“Are they Spanish, Haitian, or Neapolitan bonds?” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Danglars, smiling, “they are bonds on the bank of France,\r\npayable to bearer. Stay, count,” he added, “you, who may be called the\r\nemperor, if I claim the title of king of finance, have you many pieces\r\nof paper of this size, each worth a million?”\r\n\r\nThe count took into his hands the papers, which Danglars had so proudly\r\npresented to him, and read:—\r\n\r\n“‘To the Governor of the Bank. Please pay to my order, from the fund\r\ndeposited by me, the sum of a million, and charge the same to my\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n“Baron Danglars.’”\r\n\r\n“One, two, three, four, five,” said Monte Cristo; “five millions—why\r\nwhat a Crœsus you are!”\r\n\r\n“This is how I transact business,” said Danglars.\r\n\r\n“It is really wonderful,” said the count; “above all, if, as I suppose,\r\nit is payable at sight.”\r\n\r\n“It is, indeed,” said Danglars.\r\n\r\n“It is a fine thing to have such credit; really, it is only in France\r\nthese things are done. Five millions on five little scraps of paper!—it\r\nmust be seen to be believed.”\r\n\r\n“You do not doubt it?”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“You say so with an accent—stay, you shall be convinced; take my clerk\r\nto the bank, and you will see him leave it with an order on the\r\nTreasury for the same sum.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Monte Cristo folding the five notes, “most decidedly not;\r\nthe thing is so curious, I will make the experiment myself. I am\r\ncredited on you for six millions. I have drawn nine hundred thousand\r\nfrancs, you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand\r\nfrancs. I will take the five scraps of paper that I now hold as bonds,\r\nwith your signature alone, and here is a receipt in full for the six\r\nmillions between us. I had prepared it beforehand, for I am much in\r\nwant of money today.”\r\n\r\nAnd Monte Cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand, while\r\nwith the other he held out the receipt to Danglars. If a thunderbolt\r\nhad fallen at the banker’s feet, he could not have experienced greater\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n“What,” he stammered, “do you mean to keep that money? Excuse me,\r\nexcuse me, but I owe this money to the charity fund,—a deposit which I\r\npromised to pay this morning.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, then,” said Monte Cristo, “I am not particular about these\r\nfive notes, pay me in a different form; I wished, from curiosity, to\r\ntake these, that I might be able to say that without any advice or\r\npreparation the house of Danglars had paid me five millions without a\r\nminute’s delay; it would have been remarkable. But here are your bonds;\r\npay me differently;” and he held the bonds towards Danglars, who seized\r\nthem like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is\r\nbeing wrested from its grasp.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he rallied, made a violent effort to restrain himself, and\r\nthen a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n50109m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” he said, “your receipt is money.”\r\n\r\n“Oh dear, yes; and if you were at Rome, the house of Thomson & French\r\nwould make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than\r\nyou have just done.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, count, pardon me.”\r\n\r\n“Then I may keep this money?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Danglars, while the perspiration started from the roots of\r\nhis hair. “Yes, keep it—keep it.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable\r\nexpression which seemed to say, “Come, reflect; if you repent there is\r\nstill time.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Danglars, “no, decidedly no; keep my signatures. But you\r\nknow none are so formal as bankers in transacting business; I intended\r\nthis money for the charity fund, and I seemed to be robbing them if I\r\ndid not pay them with these precise bonds. How absurd—as if one crown\r\nwere not as good as another. Excuse me;” and he began to laugh loudly,\r\nbut nervously.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, I excuse you,” said Monte Cristo graciously, “and pocket\r\nthem.” And he placed the bonds in his pocket-book.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Danglars, “there is still a sum of one hundred thousand\r\nfrancs?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a mere nothing,” said Monte Cristo. “The balance would come to\r\nabout that sum; but keep it, and we shall be quits.”\r\n\r\n“Count,” said Danglars, “are you speaking seriously?”\r\n\r\n“I never joke with bankers,” said Monte Cristo in a freezing manner,\r\nwhich repelled impertinence; and he turned to the door, just as the\r\nvalet de chambre announced:\r\n\r\n“M. de Boville, Receiver-General of the charities.”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_,” said Monte Cristo; “I think I arrived just in time to\r\nobtain your signatures, or they would have been disputed with me.”\r\n\r\nDanglars again became pale, and hastened to conduct the count out.\r\nMonte Cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with M. de Boville, who was\r\nstanding in the waiting-room, and who was introduced into Danglars’\r\nroom as soon as the count had left.\r\n\r\nThe count’s serious face was illumined by a faint smile, as he noticed\r\nthe portfolio which the receiver-general held in his hand. At the door\r\nhe found his carriage, and was immediately driven to the bank.\r\nMeanwhile Danglars, repressing all emotion, advanced to meet the\r\nreceiver-general. We need not say that a smile of condescension was\r\nstamped upon his lips.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, creditor,” said he; “for I wager anything it is the\r\ncreditor who visits me.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, baron,” answered M. de Boville; “the charities present\r\nthemselves to you through me; the widows and orphans depute me to\r\nreceive alms to the amount of five millions from you.”\r\n\r\n“And yet they say orphans are to be pitied,” said Danglars, wishing to\r\nprolong the jest. “Poor things!”\r\n\r\n“Here I am in their name,” said M. de Boville; “but did you receive my\r\nletter yesterday?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I have brought my receipt.”\r\n\r\n50111m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“My dear M. de Boville, your widows and orphans must oblige me by\r\nwaiting twenty-four hours, since M. de Monte Cristo whom you just saw\r\nleaving here—you did see him, I think?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; well?”\r\n\r\n“Well, M. de Monte Cristo has just carried off their five millions.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“The count has an unlimited credit upon me; a credit opened by Thomson\r\n& French, of Rome; he came to demand five millions at once, which I\r\npaid him with checks on the bank. My funds are deposited there, and you\r\ncan understand that if I draw out ten millions on the same day it will\r\nappear rather strange to the governor. Two days will be a different\r\nthing,” said Danglars, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Boville, with a tone of entire incredulity, “five millions\r\nto that gentleman who just left, and who bowed to me as though he knew\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he knows you, though you do not know him; M. de Monte Cristo\r\nknows everybody.”\r\n\r\n“Five millions!”\r\n\r\n“Here is his receipt. Believe your own eyes.” M. de Boville took the\r\npaper Danglars presented him, and read:\r\n\r\n“Received of Baron Danglars the sum of five million one hundred\r\nthousand francs, to be repaid on demand by the house of Thomson &\r\nFrench of Rome.”\r\n\r\n“It is really true,” said M. de Boville.\r\n\r\n“Do you know the house of Thomson & French?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200,000\r\nfrancs; but since then I have not heard it mentioned.”\r\n\r\n“It is one of the best houses in Europe,” said Danglars, carelessly\r\nthrowing down the receipt on his desk.\r\n\r\n“And he had five millions in your hands alone! Why, this Count of Monte\r\nCristo must be a nabob?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I do not know what he is; he has three unlimited credits—one on\r\nme, one on Rothschild, one on Lafitte; and, you see,” he added\r\ncarelessly, “he has given me the preference, by leaving a balance of\r\n100,000 francs.”\r\n\r\nM. de Boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration.\r\n\r\n“I must visit him,” he said, “and obtain some pious grant from him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you may make sure of him; his charities alone amount to 20,000\r\nfrancs a month.”\r\n\r\n“It is magnificent! I will set before him the example of Madame de\r\nMorcerf and her son.”\r\n\r\n“What example?”\r\n\r\n“They gave all their fortune to the hospitals.”\r\n\r\n“What fortune?”\r\n\r\n“Their own—M. de Morcerf’s, who is deceased.”\r\n\r\n“For what reason?”\r\n\r\n“Because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired.”\r\n\r\n“And what are they to live upon?”\r\n\r\n“The mother retires into the country, and the son enters the army.”\r\n\r\n50113m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, I must confess, these are scruples.”\r\n\r\n“I registered their deed of gift yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“And how much did they possess?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, not much—from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs. But to\r\nreturn to our millions.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Danglars, in the most natural tone in the world. “Are\r\nyou then pressed for this money?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow? Why did you not tell me so before? Why, it is as good as a\r\ncentury! At what hour does the examination take place?”\r\n\r\n“At two o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Send at twelve,” said Danglars, smiling.\r\n\r\nM. de Boville said nothing, but nodded his head, and took up the\r\nportfolio.\r\n\r\n“Now I think of it, you can do better,” said Danglars.\r\n\r\n“How do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“The receipt of M. de Monte Cristo is as good as money; take it to\r\nRothschild’s or Lafitte’s, and they will take it off your hands at\r\nonce.”\r\n\r\n“What, though payable at Rome?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; it will only cost you a discount of 5,000 or 6,000 francs.”\r\n\r\nThe receiver started back.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_” he said, “I prefer waiting till tomorrow. What a\r\nproposition!”\r\n\r\n“I thought, perhaps,” said Danglars with supreme impertinence, “that\r\nyou had a deficiency to make up?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said the receiver.\r\n\r\n“And if that were the case it would be worth while to make some\r\nsacrifice.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, no, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Then it will be tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but without fail.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you are laughing at me; send tomorrow at twelve, and the bank\r\nshall be notified.”\r\n\r\n“I will come myself.”\r\n\r\n“Better still, since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you.”\r\nThey shook hands.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” said M. de Boville, “are you not going to the funeral of\r\npoor Mademoiselle de Villefort, which I met on my road here?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the banker; “I have appeared rather ridiculous since that\r\naffair of Benedetto, so I remain in the background.”\r\n\r\n“Bah, you are wrong. How were you to blame in that affair?”\r\n\r\n“Listen—when one bears an irreproachable name, as I do, one is rather\r\nsensitive.”\r\n\r\n“Everybody pities you, sir; and, above all, Mademoiselle Danglars!”\r\n\r\n“Poor Eugénie!” said Danglars; “do you know she is going to embrace a\r\nreligious life?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, it is unhappily but too true. The day after the event, she\r\ndecided on leaving Paris with a nun of her acquaintance; they are gone\r\nto seek a very strict convent in Italy or Spain.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is terrible!” and M. de Boville retired with this exclamation,\r\nafter expressing acute sympathy with the father. But he had scarcely\r\nleft before Danglars, with an energy of action those can alone\r\nunderstand who have seen Robert Macaire represented by Frédérick,24\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Fool!”\r\n\r\nThen enclosing Monte Cristo’s receipt in a little pocket-book, he\r\nadded:—“Yes, come at twelve o’clock; I shall then be far away.”\r\n\r\nThen he double-locked his door, emptied all his drawers, collected\r\nabout fifty thousand francs in bank-notes, burned several papers, left\r\nothers exposed to view, and then commenced writing a letter which he\r\naddressed:\r\n\r\n“To Madame la Baronne Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“I will place it on her table myself tonight,” he murmured. Then taking\r\na passport from his drawer he said,—“Good, it is available for two\r\nmonths longer.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 105. The Cemetery of Père-Lachaise\r\n\r\nM. de Boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking\r\nValentine to her last home on earth. The weather was dull and stormy, a\r\ncold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the\r\ntrees, and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards.\r\nM. de Villefort, a true Parisian, considered the cemetery of\r\nPère-Lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a\r\nParisian family; there alone the corpses belonging to him would be\r\nsurrounded by worthy associates. He had therefore purchased a vault,\r\nwhich was quickly occupied by members of his family. On the front of\r\nthe monument was inscribed: “The families of Saint-Méran and\r\nVillefort,” for such had been the last wish expressed by poor Renée,\r\nValentine’s mother. The pompous procession therefore wended its way\r\ntowards Père-Lachaise from the Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Having crossed\r\nParis, it passed through the Faubourg du Temple, then leaving the\r\nexterior boulevards, it reached the cemetery. More than fifty private\r\ncarriages followed the twenty mourning-coaches, and behind them more\r\nthan five hundred persons joined in the procession on foot.\r\n\r\n50117m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese last consisted of all the young people whom Valentine’s death had\r\nstruck like a thunderbolt, and who, notwithstanding the raw chilliness\r\nof the season, could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the\r\nmemory of the beautiful, chaste, and adorable girl, thus cut off in the\r\nflower of her youth.\r\n\r\nAs they left Paris, an equipage with four horses, at full speed, was\r\nseen to draw up suddenly; it contained Monte Cristo. The count left the\r\ncarriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot. Château-Renaud\r\nperceived him and immediately alighting from his _coupé_, joined him;\r\nBeauchamp did the same.\r\n\r\nThe count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd; he was\r\nevidently watching for someone, but his search ended in disappointment.\r\n\r\n50119m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Where is Morrel?” he asked; “do either of these gentlemen know where\r\nhe is?”\r\n\r\n“We have already asked that question,” said Château-Renaud, “for none\r\nof us has seen him.”\r\n\r\nThe count was silent, but continued to gaze around him. At length they\r\narrived at the cemetery. The piercing eye of Monte Cristo glanced\r\nthrough clusters of bushes and trees, and was soon relieved from all\r\nanxiety, for seeing a shadow glide between the yew-trees, Monte Cristo\r\nrecognized him whom he sought.\r\n\r\nOne funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent\r\nmetropolis. Black figures are seen scattered over the long white\r\navenues; the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise\r\nmade by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments;\r\nthen follows the melancholy chant of the priests, mingled now and then\r\nwith a sob of anguish, escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass\r\nof flowers.\r\n\r\nThe shadow Monte Cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of\r\nAbélard and Héloïse, placed itself close to the heads of the horses\r\nbelonging to the hearse, and following the undertaker’s men, arrived\r\nwith them at the spot appointed for the burial. Each person’s attention\r\nwas occupied. Monte Cristo saw nothing but the shadow, which no one\r\nelse observed. Twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object\r\nof his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes. When the\r\nprocession stopped, this shadow was recognized as Morrel, who, with his\r\ncoat buttoned up to his throat, his face livid, and convulsively\r\ncrushing his hat between his fingers, leaned against a tree, situated\r\non an elevation commanding the mausoleum, so that none of the funeral\r\ndetails could escape his observation.\r\n\r\nEverything was conducted in the usual manner. A few men, the least\r\nimpressed of all by the scene, pronounced a discourse, some deploring\r\nthis premature death, others expatiating on the grief of the father,\r\nand one very ingenious person quoting the fact that Valentine had\r\nsolicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice\r\nwas ready to fall—until at length they exhausted their stores of\r\nmetaphor and mournful speeches, elaborate variations on the stanzas of\r\nMalherbe to Du Périer.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo heard and saw nothing, or rather he only saw Morrel, whose\r\ncalmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n“See,” said Beauchamp, pointing out Morrel to Debray. “What is he doing\r\nup there?” And they called Château-Renaud’s attention to him.\r\n\r\n“How pale he is!” said Château-Renaud, shuddering.\r\n\r\n“He is cold,” said Debray.\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” said Château-Renaud, slowly; “I think he is violently\r\nagitated. He is very susceptible.”\r\n\r\n“Bah,” said Debray; “he scarcely knew Mademoiselle de Villefort; you\r\nsaid so yourself.”\r\n\r\n“True. Still I remember he danced three times with her at Madame de\r\nMorcerf’s. Do you recollect that ball, count, where you produced such\r\nan effect?”\r\n\r\n50121m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No, I do not,” replied Monte Cristo, without even knowing of what or\r\nto whom he was speaking, so much was he occupied in watching Morrel,\r\nwho was holding his breath with emotion.\r\n\r\n“The discourse is over; farewell, gentlemen,” said the count,\r\nunceremoniously.\r\n\r\nAnd he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went.\r\n\r\nThe funeral being over, the guests returned to Paris. Château-Renaud\r\nlooked for a moment for Morrel; but while they were watching the\r\ndeparture of the count, Morrel had quitted his post, and\r\nChâteau-Renaud, failing in his search, joined Debray and Beauchamp.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the\r\narrival of Morrel, who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by\r\nspectators and workmen. Morrel threw a glance around, but before it\r\nreached the spot occupied by Monte Cristo the latter had advanced yet\r\nnearer, still unperceived. The young man knelt down. The count, with\r\noutstretched neck and glaring eyes, stood in an attitude ready to\r\npounce upon Morrel upon the first occasion. Morrel bent his head till\r\nit touched the stone, then clutching the grating with both hands, he\r\nmurmured:\r\n\r\n“Oh, Valentine!”\r\n\r\nThe count’s heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words; he\r\nstepped forward, and touching the young man’s shoulder, said:\r\n\r\n“I was looking for you, my friend.” Monte Cristo expected a burst of\r\npassion, but he was deceived, for Morrel turning round, said calmly,—\r\n\r\n“You see I was praying.” The scrutinizing glance of the count searched\r\nthe young man from head to foot. He then seemed more easy.\r\n\r\n“Shall I drive you back to Paris?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“No, thank you.”\r\n\r\n“Do you wish anything?”\r\n\r\n“Leave me to pray.”\r\n\r\nThe count withdrew without opposition, but it was only to place himself\r\nin a situation where he could watch every movement of Morrel, who at\r\nlength arose, brushed the dust from his knees, and turned towards\r\nParis, without once looking back. He walked slowly down the Rue de la\r\nRoquette. The count, dismissing his carriage, followed him about a\r\nhundred paces behind. Maximilian crossed the canal and entered the Rue\r\nMeslay by the boulevards.\r\n\r\nFive minutes after the door had been closed on Morrel’s entrance, it\r\nwas again opened for the count. Julie was at the entrance of the\r\ngarden, where she was attentively watching Penelon, who, entering with\r\nzeal into his profession of gardener, was very busy grafting some\r\nBengal roses. “Ah, count,” she exclaimed, with the delight manifested\r\nby every member of the family whenever he visited the Rue Meslay.\r\n\r\n“Maximilian has just returned, has he not, madame?” asked the count.\r\n\r\n50123m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think I saw him pass; but pray, call Emmanuel.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, madame, but I must go up to Maximilian’s room this\r\ninstant,” replied Monte Cristo, “I have something of the greatest\r\nimportance to tell him.”\r\n\r\n“Go, then,” she said with a charming smile, which accompanied him until\r\nhe had disappeared.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor\r\nto Maximilian’s room; when he reached the landing he listened\r\nattentively, but all was still. Like many old houses occupied by a\r\nsingle family, the room door was panelled with glass; but it was\r\nlocked, Maximilian was shut in, and it was impossible to see what was\r\npassing in the room, because a red curtain was drawn before the glass.\r\nThe count’s anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom\r\nappeared on the face of that imperturbable man.\r\n\r\n“What shall I do!” he uttered, and reflected for a moment; “shall I\r\nring? No, the sound of a bell, announcing a visitor, will but\r\naccelerate the resolution of one in Maximilian’s situation, and then\r\nthe bell would be followed by a louder noise.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had\r\nbeen taken with the rapidity of lightning, he struck one of the panes\r\nof glass with his elbow; the glass was shivered to atoms, then\r\nwithdrawing the curtain he saw Morrel, who had been writing at his\r\ndesk, bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window.\r\n\r\n“I beg a thousand pardons,” said the count, “there is nothing the\r\nmatter, but I slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my\r\nelbow. Since it is opened, I will take advantage of it to enter your\r\nroom; do not disturb yourself—do not disturb yourself!”\r\n\r\nAnd passing his hand through the broken glass, the count opened the\r\ndoor. Morrel, evidently discomposed, came to meet Monte Cristo less\r\nwith the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_,” said Monte Cristo, rubbing his elbow, “it’s all your\r\nservant’s fault; your stairs are so polished, it is like walking on\r\nglass.”\r\n\r\n“Are you hurt, sir?” coldly asked Morrel.\r\n\r\n“I believe not. But what are you about there? You were writing.”\r\n\r\n“I?”\r\n\r\n“Your fingers are stained with ink.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, true, I was writing. I do sometimes, soldier though I am.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo advanced into the room; Maximilian was obliged to let him\r\npass, but he followed him.\r\n\r\n“You were writing?” said Monte Cristo with a searching look.\r\n\r\n“I have already had the honor of telling you I was,” said Morrel.\r\n\r\nThe count looked around him.\r\n\r\n“Your pistols are beside your desk,” said Monte Cristo, pointing with\r\nhis finger to the pistols on the table.\r\n\r\n“I am on the point of starting on a journey,” replied Morrel\r\ndisdainfully.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” exclaimed Monte Cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness.\r\n\r\n“Sir?”\r\n\r\n“My friend, my dear Maximilian, do not make a hasty resolution, I\r\nentreat you.”\r\n\r\n“I make a hasty resolution?” said Morrel, shrugging his shoulders; “is\r\nthere anything extraordinary in a journey?”\r\n\r\n50125m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Maximilian,” said the count, “let us both lay aside the mask we have\r\nassumed. You no more deceive me with that false calmness than I impose\r\nupon you with my frivolous solicitude. You can understand, can you not,\r\nthat to have acted as I have done, to have broken that glass, to have\r\nintruded on the solitude of a friend—you can understand that, to have\r\ndone all this, I must have been actuated by real uneasiness, or rather\r\nby a terrible conviction. Morrel, you are going to destroy yourself!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, count,” said Morrel, shuddering; “what has put this into your\r\nhead?”\r\n\r\n“I tell you that you are about to destroy yourself,” continued the\r\ncount, “and here is proof of what I say;” and, approaching the desk, he\r\nremoved the sheet of paper which Morrel had placed over the letter he\r\nhad begun, and took the latter in his hands.\r\n\r\nMorrel rushed forward to tear it from him, but Monte Cristo perceiving\r\nhis intention, seized his wrist with his iron grasp.\r\n\r\n“You wish to destroy yourself,” said the count; “you have written it.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Morrel, changing his expression of calmness for one of\r\nviolence—“well, and if I do intend to turn this pistol against myself,\r\nwho shall prevent me—who will dare prevent me? All my hopes are\r\nblighted, my heart is broken, my life a burden, everything around me is\r\nsad and mournful; earth has become distasteful to me, and human voices\r\ndistract me. It is a mercy to let me die, for if I live I shall lose my\r\nreason and become mad. When, sir, I tell you all this with tears of\r\nheartfelt anguish, can you reply that I am wrong, can you prevent my\r\nputting an end to my miserable existence? Tell me, sir, could you have\r\nthe courage to do so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Morrel,” said Monte Cristo, with a calmness which contrasted\r\nstrangely with the young man’s excitement; “yes, I would do so.”\r\n\r\n“You?” exclaimed Morrel, with increasing anger and reproach—“you, who\r\nhave deceived me with false hopes, who have cheered and soothed me with\r\nvain promises, when I might, if not have saved her, at least have seen\r\nher die in my arms! You, who pretend to understand everything, even the\r\nhidden sources of knowledge,—and who enact the part of a guardian angel\r\nupon earth, and could not even find an antidote to a poison\r\nadministered to a young girl! Ah, sir, indeed you would inspire me with\r\npity, were you not hateful in my eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Morrel——”\r\n\r\n“Yes; you tell me to lay aside the mask, and I will do so, be\r\nsatisfied! When you spoke to me at the cemetery, I answered you—my\r\nheart was softened; when you arrived here, I allowed you to enter. But\r\nsince you abuse my confidence, since you have devised a new torture\r\nafter I thought I had exhausted them all, then, Count of Monte Cristo\r\nmy pretended benefactor—then, Count of Monte Cristo, the universal\r\nguardian, be satisfied, you shall witness the death of your friend;”\r\nand Morrel, with a maniacal laugh, again rushed towards the pistols.\r\n\r\n“And I again repeat, you shall not commit suicide.”\r\n\r\n“Prevent me, then!” replied Morrel, with another struggle, which, like\r\nthe first, failed in releasing him from the count’s iron grasp.\r\n\r\n“I will prevent you.”\r\n\r\n50127m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“And who are you, then, that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right\r\nover free and rational beings?”\r\n\r\n“Who am I?” repeated Monte Cristo. “Listen; I am the only man in the\r\nworld having the right to say to you, ‘Morrel, your father’s son shall\r\nnot die today;’” and Monte Cristo, with an expression of majesty and\r\nsublimity, advanced with arms folded toward the young man, who,\r\ninvoluntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man, recoiled a\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n“Why do you mention my father?” stammered he; “why do you mingle a\r\nrecollection of him with the affairs of today?”\r\n\r\n“Because I am he who saved your father’s life when he wished to destroy\r\nhimself, as you do today—because I am the man who sent the purse to\r\nyour young sister, and the _Pharaon_ to old Morrel—because I am the\r\nEdmond Dantès who nursed you, a child, on my knees.”\r\n\r\nMorrel made another step back, staggering, breathless, crushed; then\r\nall his strength give way, and he fell prostrate at the feet of Monte\r\nCristo. Then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden\r\nrevulsion; he arose, rushed out of the room and to the stairs,\r\nexclaiming energetically, “Julie, Julie—Emmanuel, Emmanuel!”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo endeavored also to leave, but Maximilian would have died\r\nrather than relax his hold of the handle of the door, which he closed\r\nupon the count. Julie, Emmanuel, and some of the servants, ran up in\r\nalarm on hearing the cries of Maximilian. Morrel seized their hands,\r\nand opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs:\r\n\r\n“On your knees—on your knees—he is our benefactor—the saviour of our\r\nfather! He is——”\r\n\r\nHe would have added “Edmond Dantès,” but the count seized his arm and\r\nprevented him.\r\n\r\nJulie threw herself into the arms of the count; Emmanuel embraced him\r\nas a guardian angel; Morrel again fell on his knees, and struck the\r\nground with his forehead. Then the iron-hearted man felt his heart\r\nswell in his breast; a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his\r\neyes, he bent his head and wept. For a while nothing was heard in the\r\nroom but a succession of sobs, while the incense from their grateful\r\nhearts mounted to heaven. Julie had scarcely recovered from her deep\r\nemotion when she rushed out of the room, descended to the next floor,\r\nran into the drawing-room with childlike joy and raised the crystal\r\nglobe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the Allées de\r\nMeilhan. Meanwhile, Emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count:\r\n\r\n“Oh, count, how could you, hearing us so often speak of our unknown\r\nbenefactor, seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his\r\nmemory,—how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to\r\nus? Oh, it was cruel to us, and—dare I say it?—to you also.”\r\n\r\n“Listen, my friends,” said the count—“I may call you so since we have\r\nreally been friends for the last eleven years—the discovery of this\r\nsecret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know.\r\nI wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom, but your\r\nbrother Maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now,\r\nI am sure.”\r\n\r\nThen turning around, and seeing that Morrel, still on his knees, had\r\nthrown himself into an armchair, he added in a low voice, pressing\r\nEmmanuel’s hand significantly, “Watch over him.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?” asked the young man, surprised.\r\n\r\n“I cannot explain myself; but watch over him.” Emmanuel looked around\r\nthe room and caught sight of the pistols; his eyes rested on the\r\nweapons, and he pointed to them. Monte Cristo bent his head. Emmanuel\r\nwent towards the pistols.\r\n\r\n“Leave them,” said Monte Cristo. Then walking towards Morrel, he took\r\nhis hand; the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a\r\nprofound stupor. Julie returned, holding the silken purse in her hands,\r\nwhile tears of joy rolled down her cheeks, like dewdrops on the rose.\r\n\r\n“Here is the relic,” she said; “do not think it will be less dear to us\r\nnow we are acquainted with our benefactor!”\r\n\r\n“My child,” said Monte Cristo, coloring, “allow me to take back that\r\npurse? Since you now know my face, I wish to be remembered alone\r\nthrough the affection I hope you will grant me.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Julie, pressing the purse to her heart, “no, no, I beseech\r\nyou do not take it, for some unhappy day you will leave us, will you\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“You have guessed rightly, madame,” replied Monte Cristo, smiling; “in\r\na week I shall have left this country, where so many persons who merit\r\nthe vengeance of Heaven lived happily, while my father perished of\r\nhunger and grief.”\r\n\r\nWhile announcing his departure, the count fixed his eyes on Morrel, and\r\nremarked that the words, “I shall have left this country,” had failed\r\nto rouse him from his lethargy. He then saw that he must make another\r\nstruggle against the grief of his friend, and taking the hands of\r\nEmmanuel and Julie, which he pressed within his own, he said with the\r\nmild authority of a father:\r\n\r\n“My kind friends, leave me alone with Maximilian.”\r\n\r\nJulie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic, which\r\nMonte Cristo had forgotten. She drew her husband to the door. “Let us\r\nleave them,” she said.\r\n\r\nThe count was alone with Morrel, who remained motionless as a statue.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Monte-Cristo, touching his shoulder with his finger, “are\r\nyou a man again, Maximilian?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; for I begin to suffer again.”\r\n\r\nThe count frowned, apparently in gloomy hesitation.\r\n\r\n“Maximilian, Maximilian,” he said, “the ideas you yield to are unworthy\r\nof a Christian.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, do not fear, my friend,” said Morrel, raising his head, and\r\nsmiling with a sweet expression on the count; “I shall no longer\r\nattempt my life.”\r\n\r\n“Then we are to have no more pistols—no more despair?”\r\n\r\n“No; I have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or\r\na knife.”\r\n\r\n“Poor fellow, what is it?”\r\n\r\n“My grief will kill me of itself.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Monte Cristo, with an expression of melancholy equal\r\nto his own, “listen to me. One day, in a moment of despair like yours,\r\nsince it led to a similar resolution, I also wished to kill myself; one\r\nday your father, equally desperate, wished to kill himself too. If\r\nanyone had said to your father, at the moment he raised the pistol to\r\nhis head—if anyone had told me, when in my prison I pushed back the\r\nfood I had not tasted for three days—if anyone had said to either of us\r\nthen, ‘Live—the day will come when you will be happy, and will bless\r\nlife!’—no matter whose voice had spoken, we should have heard him with\r\nthe smile of doubt, or the anguish of incredulity,—and yet how many\r\ntimes has your father blessed life while embracing you—how often have I\r\nmyself——”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” exclaimed Morrel, interrupting the count, “you had only lost your\r\nliberty, my father had only lost his fortune, but I have lost\r\nValentine.”\r\n\r\n“Look at me,” said Monte Cristo, with that expression which sometimes\r\nmade him so eloquent and persuasive—“look at me. There are no tears in\r\nmy eyes, nor is there fever in my veins, yet I see you suffer—you,\r\nMaximilian, whom I love as my own son. Well, does not this tell you\r\nthat in grief, as in life, there is always something to look forward to\r\nbeyond? Now, if I entreat, if I order you to live, Morrel, it is in the\r\nconviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, heavens,” said the young man, “oh, heavens—what are you saying,\r\ncount? Take care. But perhaps you have never loved!”\r\n\r\n“Child!” replied the count.\r\n\r\n“I mean, as I love. You see, I have been a soldier ever since I\r\nattained manhood. I reached the age of twenty-nine without loving, for\r\nnone of the feelings I before then experienced merit the appellation of\r\nlove. Well, at twenty-nine I saw Valentine; for two years I have loved\r\nher, for two years I have seen written in her heart, as in a book, all\r\nthe virtues of a daughter and wife. Count, to possess Valentine would\r\nhave been a happiness too infinite, too ecstatic, too complete, too\r\ndivine for this world, since it has been denied me; but without\r\nValentine the earth is desolate.”\r\n\r\n“I have told you to hope,” said the count.\r\n\r\n“Then have a care, I repeat, for you seek to persuade me, and if you\r\nsucceed I should lose my reason, for I should hope that I could again\r\nbehold Valentine.”\r\n\r\nThe count smiled.\r\n\r\n“My friend, my father,” said Morrel with excitement, “have a care, I\r\nagain repeat, for the power you wield over me alarms me. Weigh your\r\nwords before you speak, for my eyes have already become brighter, and\r\nmy heart beats strongly; be cautious, or you will make me believe in\r\nsupernatural agencies. I must obey you, though you bade me call forth\r\nthe dead or walk upon the water.”\r\n\r\n“Hope, my friend,” repeated the count.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Morrel, falling from the height of excitement to the abyss\r\nof despair—“ah, you are playing with me, like those good, or rather\r\nselfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words, because\r\ntheir screams annoy them. No, my friend, I was wrong to caution you; do\r\nnot fear, I will bury my grief so deep in my heart, I will disguise it\r\nso, that you shall not even care to sympathize with me. Adieu, my\r\nfriend, adieu!”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” said the count, “after this time you must live with\r\nme—you must not leave me, and in a week we shall have left France\r\nbehind us.”\r\n\r\n“And you still bid me hope?”\r\n\r\n“I tell you to hope, because I have a method of curing you.”\r\n\r\n“Count, you render me sadder than before, if it be possible. You think\r\nthe result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief, and you\r\nwould cure it by an ordinary remedy—change of scene.” And Morrel\r\ndropped his head with disdainful incredulity.\r\n\r\n“What can I say more?” asked Monte Cristo. “I have confidence in the\r\nremedy I propose, and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its\r\nefficacy.”\r\n\r\n“Count, you prolong my agony.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said the count, “your feeble spirit will not even grant me the\r\ntrial I request? Come—do you know of what the Count of Monte Cristo is\r\ncapable? do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his\r\ncontrol? nay, that he can almost work a miracle? Well, wait for the\r\nmiracle I hope to accomplish, or——”\r\n\r\n“Or?” repeated Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Or, take care, Morrel, lest I call you ungrateful.”\r\n\r\n“Have pity on me, count!”\r\n\r\n“I feel so much pity towards you, Maximilian, that—listen to me\r\nattentively—if I do not cure you in a month, to the day, to the very\r\nhour, mark my words, Morrel, I will place loaded pistols before you,\r\nand a cup of the deadliest Italian poison—a poison more sure and prompt\r\nthan that which has killed Valentine.”\r\n\r\n“Will you promise me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; for I am a man, and have suffered like yourself, and also\r\ncontemplated suicide; indeed, often since misfortune has left me I have\r\nlonged for the delights of an eternal sleep.”\r\n\r\n“But you are sure you will promise me this?” said Morrel, intoxicated.\r\n\r\n“I not only promise, but swear it!” said Monte Cristo extending his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“In a month, then, on your honor, if I am not consoled, you will let me\r\ntake my life into my own hands, and whatever may happen you will not\r\ncall me ungrateful?”\r\n\r\n“In a month, to the day, the very hour and the date is a sacred one,\r\nMaximilian. I do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of\r\nSeptember; it is ten years today since I saved your father’s life, who\r\nwished to die.”\r\n\r\nMorrel seized the count’s hand and kissed it; the count allowed him to\r\npay the homage he felt due to him.\r\n\r\n“In a month you will find on the table, at which we shall be then\r\nsitting, good pistols and a delicious draught; but, on the other hand,\r\nyou must promise me not to attempt your life before that time.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I also swear it!”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo drew the young man towards him, and pressed him for some\r\ntime to his heart. “And now,” he said, “after today, you will come and\r\nlive with me; you can occupy Haydée’s apartment, and my daughter will\r\nat least be replaced by my son.”\r\n\r\n“Haydée?” said Morrel, “what has become of her?”\r\n\r\n“She departed last night.”\r\n\r\n“To leave you?”\r\n\r\n“To wait for me. Hold yourself ready then to join me at the\r\nChamps-Élysées, and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my\r\ndeparture.”\r\n\r\nMaximilian hung his head, and obeyed with childlike reverence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 106. Dividing the Proceeds\r\n\r\nThe apartment on the first floor of the house in the Rue\r\nSaint-Germain-des-Prés, where Albert de Morcerf had selected a home for\r\nhis mother, was let to a very mysterious person. This was a man whose\r\nface the concierge himself had never seen, for in the winter his chin\r\nwas buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen’s\r\ncoachmen on a cold night, and in the summer he made a point of always\r\nblowing his nose just as he approached the door. Contrary to custom,\r\nthis gentleman had not been watched, for as the report ran that he was\r\na person of high rank, and one who would allow no impertinent\r\ninterference, his _incognito_ was strictly respected.\r\n\r\nHis visits were tolerably regular, though occasionally he appeared a\r\nlittle before or after his time, but generally, both in summer and\r\nwinter, he took possession of his apartment about four o’clock, though\r\nhe never spent the night there. At half-past three in the winter the\r\nfire was lighted by the discreet servant, who had the superintendence\r\nof the little apartment, and in the summer ices were placed on the\r\ntable at the same hour. At four o’clock, as we have already stated, the\r\nmysterious personage arrived.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house, a lady\r\nalighted in a black or dark blue dress, and always thickly veiled; she\r\npassed like a shadow through the lodge, and ran upstairs without a\r\nsound escaping under the touch of her light foot. No one ever asked her\r\nwhere she was going. Her face, therefore, like that of the gentleman,\r\nwas perfectly unknown to the two concierges, who were perhaps\r\nunequalled throughout the capital for discretion. We need not say she\r\nstopped at the first floor. Then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a\r\ndoor, which after being opened to admit her was again fastened, and\r\ncuriosity penetrated no farther. They used the same precautions in\r\nleaving as in entering the house. The lady always left first, and as\r\nsoon as she had stepped into her carriage, it drove away, sometimes\r\ntowards the right hand, sometimes to the left; then about twenty\r\nminutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave, buried in his cravat\r\nor concealed by his handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThe day after Monte Cristo had called upon Danglars, the mysterious\r\nlodger entered at ten o’clock in the morning instead of four in the\r\nafternoon. Almost directly afterwards, without the usual interval of\r\ntime, a cab arrived, and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs. The door\r\nopened, but before it could be closed, the lady exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lucien—oh, my friend!”\r\n\r\nThe concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodger’s name\r\nwas Lucien; still, as he was the very perfection of a door-keeper, he\r\nmade up his mind not to tell his wife.\r\n\r\n“Well, what is the matter, my dear?” asked the gentleman whose name the\r\nlady’s agitation revealed; “tell me what is the matter.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lucien, can I confide in you?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, you know you can do so. But what can be the matter? Your\r\nnote of this morning has completely bewildered me. This\r\nprecipitation—this unusual appointment. Come, ease me of my anxiety, or\r\nelse frighten me at once.”\r\n\r\n“Lucien, a great event has happened!” said the lady, glancing\r\ninquiringly at Lucien,—“M. Danglars left last night!”\r\n\r\n“Left?—M. Danglars left? Where has he gone?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean? Has he gone intending not to return?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly;—at ten o’clock at night his horses took him to the\r\nbarrier of Charenton; there a post-chaise was waiting for him—he\r\nentered it with his valet de chambre, saying that he was going to\r\nFontainebleau.”\r\n\r\n“Then what did you mean——”\r\n\r\n“Stay—he left a letter for me.”\r\n\r\n“A letter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; read it.”\r\n\r\nAnd the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to\r\nDebray. Debray paused a moment before reading, as if trying to guess\r\nits contents, or perhaps while making up his mind how to act, whatever\r\nit might contain. No doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes,\r\nfor he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the\r\nheart of the baroness, and which ran as follows:\r\n\r\n“‘Madame and most faithful wife.’”\r\n\r\nDebray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness, whose face\r\nbecame covered with blushes.\r\n\r\n“Read,” she said.\r\n\r\nDebray continued:\r\n\r\n“‘When you receive this, you will no longer have a husband. Oh, you\r\nneed not be alarmed, you will only have lost him as you have lost your\r\ndaughter; I mean that I shall be travelling on one of the thirty or\r\nforty roads leading out of France. I owe you some explanations for my\r\nconduct, and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me, I\r\nwill give them. Listen, then. I received this morning five millions\r\nwhich I paid away; almost directly afterwards another demand for the\r\nsame sum was presented to me; I put this creditor off till tomorrow and\r\nI intend leaving today, to escape that tomorrow, which would be rather\r\ntoo unpleasant for me to endure. You understand this, do you not, my\r\nmost precious wife? I say you understand this, because you are as\r\nconversant with my affairs as I am; indeed, I think you understand them\r\nbetter, since I am ignorant of what has become of a considerable\r\nportion of my fortune, once very tolerable, while I am sure, madame,\r\nthat you know perfectly well. For women have infallible instincts; they\r\ncan even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have\r\ninvented; but I, who only understand my own figures, know nothing more\r\nthan that one day these figures deceived me. Have you admired the\r\nrapidity of my fall? Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden\r\nfusion of my ingots? I confess I have seen nothing but the fire; let us\r\nhope you have found some gold among the ashes. With this consoling\r\nidea, I leave you, madame, and most prudent wife, without any\r\nconscientious reproach for abandoning you; you have friends left, and\r\nthe ashes I have already mentioned, and above all the liberty I hasten\r\nto restore to you. And here, madame, I must add another word of\r\nexplanation. So long as I hoped you were working for the good of our\r\nhouse and for the fortune of our daughter, I philosophically closed my\r\neyes; but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin I will\r\nnot be the foundation of another man’s fortune. You were rich when I\r\nmarried you, but little respected. Excuse me for speaking so very\r\ncandidly, but as this is intended only for ourselves, I do not see why\r\nI should weigh my words. I have augmented our fortune, and it has\r\ncontinued to increase during the last fifteen years, till extraordinary\r\nand unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned it,—without any\r\nfault of mine, I can honestly declare. You, madame, have only sought to\r\nincrease your own, and I am convinced that you have succeeded. I leave\r\nyou, therefore, as I took you,—rich, but little respected. Adieu! I\r\nalso intend from this time to work on my own account. Accept my\r\nacknowledgments for the example you have set me, and which I intend\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n“‘Your very devoted husband,\r\n\r\n“‘Baron Danglars.’”\r\n\r\nThe baroness had watched Debray while he read this long and painful\r\nletter, and saw him, notwithstanding his self-control, change color\r\nonce or twice. When he had ended the perusal, he folded the letter and\r\nresumed his pensive attitude.\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Madame Danglars, with an anxiety easy to be understood.\r\n\r\n“Well, madame?” unhesitatingly repeated Debray.\r\n\r\n“With what ideas does that letter inspire you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is simple enough, madame; it inspires me with the idea that M.\r\nDanglars has left suspiciously.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; but is this all you have to say to me?”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand you,” said Debray with freezing coldness.\r\n\r\n“He is gone! Gone, never to return!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, madame, do not think that!”\r\n\r\n“I tell you he will never return. I know his character; he is\r\ninflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests. If he could\r\nhave made any use of me, he would have taken me with him; he leaves me\r\nin Paris, as our separation will conduce to his benefit;—therefore he\r\nhas gone, and I am free forever,” added Madame Danglars, in the same\r\nsupplicating tone.\r\n\r\nDebray, instead of answering, allowed her to remain in an attitude of\r\nnervous inquiry.\r\n\r\n“Well?” she said at length, “do you not answer me?”\r\n\r\n“I have but one question to ask you,—what do you intend to do?”\r\n\r\n“I was going to ask you,” replied the baroness with a beating heart.\r\n\r\n“Ah, then, you wish to ask advice of me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I do wish to ask your advice,” said Madame Danglars with anxious\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\n“Then if you wish to take my advice,” said the young man coldly, “I\r\nwould recommend you to travel.”\r\n\r\n“To travel!” she murmured.\r\n\r\n“Certainly; as M. Danglars says, you are rich, and perfectly free. In\r\nmy opinion, a withdrawal from Paris is absolutely necessary after the\r\ndouble catastrophe of Mademoiselle Danglars’ broken contract and M.\r\nDanglars’ disappearance. The world will think you abandoned and poor,\r\nfor the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven, were she to keep up\r\nan appearance of opulence. You have only to remain in Paris for about a\r\nfortnight, telling the world you are abandoned, and relating the\r\ndetails of this desertion to your best friends, who will soon spread\r\nthe report. Then you can quit your house, leaving your jewels and\r\ngiving up your jointure, and everyone’s mouth will be filled with\r\npraises of your disinterestedness. They will know you are deserted, and\r\nthink you also poor, for I alone know your real financial position, and\r\nam quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner.”\r\n\r\nThe dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this,\r\nwas equalled by the calm indifference with which Debray had spoken.\r\n\r\n“Deserted?” she repeated; “ah, yes, I am, indeed, deserted! You are\r\nright, sir, and no one can doubt my position.”\r\n\r\nThese were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman\r\ncould utter in response to Debray.\r\n\r\n50137m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“But then you are rich,—very rich, indeed,” continued Debray, taking\r\nout some papers from his pocket-book, which he spread upon the table.\r\nMadame Danglars did not see them; she was engaged in stilling the\r\nbeatings of her heart, and restraining the tears which were ready to\r\ngush forth. At length a sense of dignity prevailed, and if she did not\r\nentirely master her agitation, she at least succeeded in preventing the\r\nfall of a single tear.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said Debray, “it is nearly six months since we have been\r\nassociated. You furnished a principal of 100,000 francs. Our\r\npartnership began in the month of April. In May we commenced\r\noperations, and in the course of the month gained 450,000 francs. In\r\nJune the profit amounted to 900,000. In July we added 1,700,000\r\nfrancs,—it was, you know, the month of the Spanish bonds. In August we\r\nlost 300,000 francs at the beginning of the month, but on the 13th we\r\nmade up for it, and we now find that our accounts, reckoning from the\r\nfirst day of partnership up to yesterday, when I closed them, showed a\r\ncapital of 2,400,000 francs, that is, 1,200,000 for each of us. Now,\r\nmadame,” said Debray, delivering up his accounts in the methodical\r\nmanner of a stockbroker, “there are still 80,000 francs, the interest\r\nof this money, in my hands.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said the baroness, “I thought you never put the money out to\r\ninterest.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, madame,” said Debray coldly, “I had your permission to do\r\nso, and I have made use of it. There are, then, 40,000 francs for your\r\nshare, besides the 100,000 you furnished me to begin with, making in\r\nall 1,340,000 francs for your portion. Now, madame, I took the\r\nprecaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday; it is\r\nnot long ago, you see, and I was in continual expectation of being\r\ncalled on to deliver up my accounts. There is your money,—half in\r\nbank-notes, the other half in checks payable to bearer. I say _there_,\r\nfor as I did not consider my house safe enough, or lawyers sufficiently\r\ndiscreet, and as landed property carries evidence with it, and moreover\r\nsince you have no right to possess anything independent of your\r\nhusband, I have kept this sum, now your whole fortune, in a chest\r\nconcealed under that closet, and for greater security I myself\r\nconcealed it there.\r\n\r\n“Now, madame,” continued Debray, first opening the closet, then the\r\nchest;—“now, madame, here are 800 notes of 1,000 francs each,\r\nresembling, as you see, a large book bound in iron; to this I add a\r\ncertificate in the funds of 25,000 francs; then, for the odd cash,\r\nmaking I think about 110,000 francs, here is a check upon my banker,\r\nwho, not being M. Danglars, will pay you the amount, you may rest\r\nassured.”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars mechanically took the check, the bond, and the heap of\r\nbank-notes. This enormous fortune made no great appearance on the\r\ntable. Madame Danglars, with tearless eyes, but with her breast heaving\r\nwith concealed emotion, placed the bank-notes in her bag, put the\r\ncertificate and check into her pocket-book, and then, standing pale and\r\nmute, awaited one kind word of consolation.\r\n\r\nBut she waited in vain.\r\n\r\n“Now, madame,” said Debray, “you have a splendid fortune, an income of\r\nabout 60,000 livres a year, which is enormous for a woman who cannot\r\nkeep an establishment here for a year, at least. You will be able to\r\nindulge all your fancies; besides, should you find your income\r\ninsufficient, you can, for the sake of the past, madame, make use of\r\nmine; and I am ready to offer you all I possess, on loan.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir—thank you,” replied the baroness; “you forget that what\r\nyou have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires, who\r\nintends for some time, at least, to retire from the world.”\r\n\r\nDebray was, for a moment, surprised, but immediately recovering\r\nhimself, he bowed with an air which seemed to say, “As you please,\r\nmadame.”\r\n\r\nMadame Danglars had until then, perhaps, hoped for something; but when\r\nshe saw the careless bow of Debray, and the glance by which it was\r\naccompanied, together with his significant silence, she raised her\r\nhead, and without passion or violence or even hesitation, ran\r\ndownstairs, disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus\r\npart from her.\r\n\r\n“Bah,” said Debray, when she had left, “these are fine projects! She\r\nwill remain at home, read novels, and speculate at cards, since she can\r\nno longer do so on the Bourse.”\r\n\r\nThen taking up his account book, he cancelled with the greatest care\r\nall the entries of the amounts he had just paid away.\r\n\r\n“I have 1,060,000 francs remaining,” he said. “What a pity Mademoiselle\r\nde Villefort is dead! She suited me in every respect, and I would have\r\nmarried her.”\r\n\r\nAnd he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after Madame\r\nDanglars’ departure before he left the house. During this time he\r\noccupied himself in making figures, with his watch by his side.\r\n\r\nAsmodeus—that diabolical personage, who would have been created by\r\nevery fertile imagination if Le Sage had not acquired the priority in\r\nhis great masterpiece—would have enjoyed a singular spectacle, if he\r\nhad lifted up the roof of the little house in the Rue\r\nSaint-Germain-des-Prés, while Debray was casting up his figures.\r\n\r\nAbove the room in which Debray had been dividing two millions and a\r\nhalf with Madame Danglars was another, inhabited by persons who have\r\nplayed too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their\r\nappearance not to create some interest.\r\n\r\nMercédès and Albert were in that room.\r\n\r\nMercédès was much changed within the last few days; not that even in\r\nher days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display\r\nwhich makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in\r\na plain and simple attire; nor indeed, had she fallen into that state\r\nof depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery; no,\r\nthe change in Mercédès was that her eye no longer sparkled, her lips no\r\nlonger smiled, and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words\r\nwhich formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit.\r\n\r\nIt was not poverty which had broken her spirit; it was not a want of\r\ncourage which rendered her poverty burdensome. Mercédès, although\r\ndeposed from the exalted position she had occupied, lost in the sphere\r\nshe had now chosen, like a person passing from a room splendidly\r\nlighted into utter darkness, appeared like a queen, fallen from her\r\npalace to a hovel, and who, reduced to strict necessity, could neither\r\nbecome reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to\r\nplace upon the table, nor to the humble pallet which had become her\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud\r\nglance and charming smile, because she saw nothing but misery around\r\nher; the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical\r\nlandlords choose as not likely to show the dirt; the floor was\r\nuncarpeted; the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt\r\nat luxury; indeed, everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement\r\nand elegance.\r\n\r\nMadame de Morcerf had lived there since leaving her house; the\r\ncontinual silence of the spot oppressed her; still, seeing that Albert\r\ncontinually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings,\r\nshe constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone,\r\nwhich, contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually\r\nshone from her eyes, seemed like “moonlight on a statue,”—yielding\r\nlight without warmth.\r\n\r\nAlbert, too, was ill at ease; the remains of luxury prevented him from\r\nsinking into his actual position. If he wished to go out without\r\ngloves, his hands appeared too white; if he wished to walk through the\r\ntown, his boots seemed too highly polished. Yet these two noble and\r\nintelligent creatures, united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and\r\nfilial love, had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another, and\r\neconomizing their stores, and Albert had been able to tell his mother\r\nwithout extorting a change of countenance:\r\n\r\n“Mother, we have no more money.”\r\n\r\n50141m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMercédès had never known misery; she had often, in her youth, spoken of\r\npoverty, but between want and necessity, those synonymous words, there\r\nis a wide difference.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Catalans, Mercédès wished for a thousand things, but still\r\nshe never really wanted any. So long as the nets were good, they caught\r\nfish; and so long as they sold their fish, they were able to buy twine\r\nfor new nets. And then, shut out from friendship, having but one\r\naffection, which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits, she\r\nthought of herself—of no one but herself. Upon the little she earned\r\nshe lived as well as she could; now there were two to be supported, and\r\nnothing to live upon.\r\n\r\nWinter approached. Mercédès had no fire in that cold and naked\r\nroom—she, who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the\r\nhall to the boudoir; she had not even one little flower—she whose\r\napartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics. But she had her\r\nson. Hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them.\r\nExcitement, like enthusiasm, sometimes renders us unconscious to the\r\nthings of earth. But the excitement had calmed down, and they felt\r\nthemselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality; after having\r\nexhausted the ideal, they found they must talk of the actual.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” exclaimed Albert, just as Madame Danglars was descending the\r\nstairs, “let us reckon our riches, if you please; I want capital to\r\nbuild my plans upon.”\r\n\r\n“Capital—nothing!” replied Mercédès with a mournful smile.\r\n\r\n“No, mother,—capital 3,000 francs. And I have an idea of our leading a\r\ndelightful life upon this 3,000 francs.”\r\n\r\n“Child!” sighed Mercédès.\r\n\r\n“Alas, dear mother,” said the young man, “I have unhappily spent too\r\nmuch of your money not to know the value of it. These 3,000 francs are\r\nenormous, and I intend building upon this foundation a miraculous\r\ncertainty for the future.”\r\n\r\n“You say this, my dear boy; but do you think we ought to accept these\r\n3,000 francs?” said Mercédès, coloring.\r\n\r\n“I think so,” answered Albert in a firm tone. “We will accept them the\r\nmore readily, since we have them not here; you know they are buried in\r\nthe garden of the little house in the Allées de Meilhan, at Marseilles.\r\nWith 200 francs we can reach Marseilles.”\r\n\r\n“With 200 francs?—are you sure, Albert?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, as for that, I have made inquiries respecting the diligences and\r\nsteamboats, and my calculations are made. You will take your place in\r\nthe _coupé_ to Châlons. You see, mother, I treat you handsomely for\r\nthirty-five francs.”\r\n\r\nAlbert then took a pen, and wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         Frs. _Coupé_,\r\n                                                         thirty-five\r\n                                                         francs........\r\n                                                         ..............\r\n                                                         ........ 35.\r\n                                                         From Châlons\r\n                                                         to Lyons you\r\n                                                         will go on by\r\n                                                         the\r\n                                                         steamboat..\r\n                                                         6.

A young man\r\ndoes not require luxuries; besides, I know what travelling is.”\r\n\r\n“With a post-chaise and valet de chambre?”\r\n\r\n“Any way, mother.”\r\n\r\n“Well, be it so. But these 200 francs?”\r\n\r\n“Here they are, and 200 more besides. See, I have sold my watch for 100\r\nfrancs, and the guard and seals for 300. How fortunate that the\r\nornaments were worth more than the watch. Still the same story of\r\nsuperfluities! Now I think we are rich, since instead of the 114 francs\r\nwe require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of 250.”\r\n\r\n“But we owe something in this house?”\r\n\r\n“Thirty francs; but I pay that out of my 150 francs,—that is\r\nunderstood,—and as I require only eighty francs for my journey, you see\r\nI am overwhelmed with luxury. But that is not all. What do you say to\r\nthis, mother?”\r\n\r\nAnd Albert took out of a little pocket-book with golden clasps, a\r\nremnant of his old fancies, or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of\r\nthe mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little\r\ndoor,—Albert took out of this pocket-book a note of 1,000 francs.\r\n\r\n“What is this?” asked Mercédès.\r\n\r\n“A thousand francs.”\r\n\r\n“But whence have you obtained them?”\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, mother, and do not yield too much to agitation.” And\r\nAlbert, rising, kissed his mother on both cheeks, then stood looking at\r\nher. “You cannot imagine, mother, how beautiful I think you!” said the\r\nyoung man, impressed with a profound feeling of filial love. “You are,\r\nindeed, the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever saw!”\r\n\r\n“Dear child!” said Mercédès, endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear\r\nwhich glistened in the corner of her eye. “Indeed, you only wanted\r\nmisfortune to change my love for you to admiration. I am not unhappy\r\nwhile I possess my son!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, just so,” said Albert; “here begins the trial. Do you know the\r\ndecision we have come to, mother?”\r\n\r\n“Have we come to any?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it is decided that you are to live at Marseilles, and that I am\r\nto leave for Africa, where I will earn for myself the right to use the\r\nname I now bear, instead of the one I have thrown aside.” Mercédès\r\nsighed. “Well, mother, I yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the\r\nSpahis,”25 added the young man, lowering his eyes with a certain\r\nfeeling of shame, for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his\r\nself-abasement. “I thought my body was my own, and that I might sell\r\nit. I yesterday took the place of another. I sold myself for more than\r\nI thought I was worth,” he added, attempting to smile; “I fetched 2,000\r\nfrancs.”\r\n\r\n“Then these 1,000 francs——” said Mercédès, shuddering.\r\n\r\n“Are the half of the sum, mother; the other will be paid in a year.”\r\n\r\nMercédès raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be\r\nimpossible to describe, and tears, which had hitherto been restrained,\r\nnow yielded to her emotion, and ran down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n“The price of his blood!” she murmured.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if I am killed,” said Albert, laughing. “But I assure you,\r\nmother, I have a strong intention of defending my person, and I never\r\nfelt half so strong an inclination to live as I do now.”\r\n\r\n“Merciful Heavens!”\r\n\r\n“Besides, mother, why should you make up your mind that I am to be\r\nkilled? Has Lamoricière, that Ney of the South, been killed? Has\r\nChangarnier been killed? Has Bedeau been killed? Has Morrel, whom we\r\nknow, been killed? Think of your joy, mother, when you see me return\r\nwith an embroidered uniform! I declare, I expect to look magnificent in\r\nit, and chose that regiment only from vanity.”\r\n\r\nMercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile; the devoted mother felt\r\nthat she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall\r\nupon her son.\r\n\r\n“Well, now you understand, mother!” continued Albert; “here are more\r\nthan 4,000 francs settled on you; upon these you can live at least two\r\nyears.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?” said Mercédès.\r\n\r\nThese words were uttered in so mournful a tone that their real meaning\r\ndid not escape Albert; he felt his heart beat, and taking his mother’s\r\nhand within his own he said, tenderly:\r\n\r\n“Yes, you will live!”\r\n\r\n“I shall live!—then you will not leave me, Albert?”\r\n\r\n“Mother, I must go,” said Albert in a firm, calm voice; “you love me\r\ntoo well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you; besides, I\r\nhave signed.”\r\n\r\n50145m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You will obey your own wish and the will of Heaven!”\r\n\r\n“Not my own wish, mother, but reason—necessity. Are we not two\r\ndespairing creatures? What is life to you?—Nothing. What is life to\r\nme?—Very little without you, mother; for believe me, but for you I\r\nshould have ceased to live on the day I doubted my father and renounced\r\nhis name. Well, I will live, if you promise me still to hope; and if\r\nyou grant me the care of your future prospects, you will redouble my\r\nstrength. Then I will go to the governor of Algeria; he has a royal\r\nheart, and is essentially a soldier; I will tell him my gloomy story. I\r\nwill beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me, and if he keep\r\nhis word and interest himself for me, in six months I shall be an\r\nofficer, or dead. If I am an officer, your fortune is certain, for I\r\nshall have money enough for both, and, moreover, a name we shall both\r\nbe proud of, since it will be our own. If I am killed—well then mother,\r\nyou can also die, and there will be an end of our misfortunes.”\r\n\r\n“It is well,” replied Mercédès, with her eloquent glance; “you are\r\nright, my love; let us prove to those who are watching our actions that\r\nwe are worthy of compassion.”\r\n\r\n“But let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions,” said the young man; “I\r\nassure you we are, or rather we shall be, very happy. You are a woman\r\nat once full of spirit and resignation; I have become simple in my\r\ntastes, and am without passion, I hope. Once in service, I shall be\r\nrich—once in M. Dantès’ house, you will be at rest. Let us strive, I\r\nbeseech you,—let us strive to be cheerful.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, let us strive, for you ought to live, and to be happy, Albert.”\r\n\r\n“And so our division is made, mother,” said the young man, affecting\r\nease of mind. “We can now part; come, I shall engage your passage.”\r\n\r\n“And you, my dear boy?”\r\n\r\n“I shall stay here for a few days longer; we must accustom ourselves to\r\nparting. I want recommendations and some information relative to\r\nAfrica. I will join you again at Marseilles.”\r\n\r\n“Well, be it so—let us part,” said Mercédès, folding around her\r\nshoulders the only shawl she had taken away, and which accidentally\r\nhappened to be a valuable black cashmere. Albert gathered up his papers\r\nhastily, rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the\r\nlandlord, and offering his arm to his mother, they descended the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nSomeone was walking down before them, and this person, hearing the\r\nrustling of a silk dress, turned around. “Debray!” muttered Albert.\r\n\r\n“You, Morcerf?” replied the secretary, resting on the stairs. Curiosity\r\nhad vanquished the desire of preserving his _incognito_, and he was\r\nrecognized. It was, indeed, strange in this unknown spot to find the\r\nyoung man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in Paris.\r\n\r\n“Morcerf!” repeated Debray. Then noticing in the dim light the still\r\nyouthful and veiled figure of Madame de Morcerf:\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” he added with a smile, “I leave you, Albert.” Albert\r\nunderstood his thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” he said, turning towards Mercédès, “this is M. Debray,\r\nsecretary of the Minister for the Interior, once a friend of mine.”\r\n\r\n“How once?” stammered Debray; “what do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I say so, M. Debray, because I have no friends now, and I ought not to\r\nhave any. I thank you for having recognized me, sir.” Debray stepped\r\nforward, and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor.\r\n\r\n“Believe me, dear Albert,” he said, with all the emotion he was capable\r\nof feeling,—“believe me, I feel deeply for your misfortunes, and if in\r\nany way I can serve you, I am yours.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir,” said Albert, smiling. “In the midst of our\r\nmisfortunes, we are still rich enough not to require assistance from\r\nanyone. We are leaving Paris, and when our journey is paid, we shall\r\nhave 5,000 francs left.”\r\n\r\nThe blood mounted to the temples of Debray, who held a million in his\r\npocket-book, and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting\r\nthat the same house had contained two women, one of whom, justly\r\ndishonored, had left it poor with 1,500,000 francs under her cloak,\r\nwhile the other, unjustly stricken, but sublime in her misfortune, was\r\nyet rich with a few deniers. This parallel disturbed his usual\r\npoliteness, the philosophy he witnessed appalled him, he muttered a few\r\nwords of general civility and ran downstairs.\r\n\r\nThat day the minister’s clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to\r\nput up with from his ill-humor. But that same night, he found himself\r\nthe possessor of a fine house, situated on the Boulevard de la\r\nMadeleine, and an income of 50,000 livres.\r\n\r\nThe next day, just as Debray was signing the deed, that is about five\r\no’clock in the afternoon, Madame de Morcerf, after having\r\naffectionately embraced her son, entered the _coupé_ of the diligence,\r\nwhich closed upon her.\r\n\r\nA man was hidden in Lafitte’s banking-house, behind one of the little\r\narched windows which are placed above each desk; he saw Mercédès enter\r\nthe diligence, and he also saw Albert withdraw. Then he passed his hand\r\nacross his forehead, which was clouded with doubt.\r\n\r\n“Alas,” he exclaimed, “how can I restore the happiness I have taken\r\naway from these poor innocent creatures? God help me!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den\r\n\r\nOne division of La Force, in which the most dangerous and desperate\r\nprisoners are confined, is called the court of Saint-Bernard. The\r\nprisoners, in their expressive language, have named it the “Lions’\r\nDen,” probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw\r\nthe bars, and sometimes the keepers also. It is a prison within a\r\nprison; the walls are double the thickness of the rest. The gratings\r\nare every day carefully examined by jailers, whose herculean\r\nproportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen\r\nto reign over their subjects for their superior activity and\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nThe courtyard of this quarter is enclosed by enormous walls, over which\r\nthe sun glances obliquely, when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf\r\nof moral and physical deformity. On this paved yard are to be\r\nseen,—pacing to and fro from morning till night, pale, careworn, and\r\nhaggard, like so many shadows,—the men whom justice holds beneath the\r\nsteel she is sharpening. There, crouched against the side of the wall\r\nwhich attracts and retains the most heat, they may be seen sometimes\r\ntalking to one another, but more frequently alone, watching the door,\r\nwhich sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage, or\r\nto throw in another outcast from society.\r\n\r\nThe court of Saint-Bernard has its own particular apartment for the\r\nreception of guests; it is a long rectangle, divided by two upright\r\ngratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent\r\na visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners.\r\nIt is a wretched, damp, nay, even horrible spot, more especially when\r\nwe consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between\r\nthose iron bars. And yet, frightful though this spot may be, it is\r\nlooked upon as a kind of paradise by the men whose days are numbered;\r\nit is so rare for them to leave the Lions’ Den for any other place than\r\nthe barrier Saint-Jacques, the galleys! or solitary confinement.\r\n\r\nIn the court which we have attempted to describe, and from which a damp\r\nvapor was rising, a young man with his hands in his pockets, who had\r\nexcited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the “Den,” might be\r\nseen walking. The cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an\r\nelegant man, if those clothes had not been torn to shreds; still they\r\ndid not show signs of wear, and the fine cloth, beneath the careful\r\nhands of the prisoner, soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were\r\nstill perfect, for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the\r\nappearance of a new coat. He bestowed the same attention upon the\r\ncambric front of a shirt, which had considerably changed in color since\r\nhis entrance into the prison, and he polished his varnished boots with\r\nthe corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a\r\ncoronet.\r\n\r\nSome of the inmates of the “Lions’ Den” were watching the operations of\r\nthe prisoner’s toilet with considerable interest.\r\n\r\n“See, the prince is pluming himself,” said one of the thieves.\r\n\r\n“He’s a fine looking fellow,” said another; “if he had only a comb and\r\nhair-grease, he’d take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids.”\r\n\r\n“His coat looks nearly new, and his boots are brilliant. It is pleasant\r\nto have such well-dressed brethren; and those gendarmes behaved\r\nshamefully. What jealousy; to tear such clothes!”\r\n\r\n“He looks like a big-bug,” said another; “dresses in fine style. And,\r\nthen, to be here so young! Oh, what larks!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket,\r\nagainst which one of the keepers was leaning.\r\n\r\n“Come, sir,” he said, “lend me twenty francs; you will soon be paid;\r\nyou run no risks with me. Remember, I have relations who possess more\r\nmillions than you have deniers. Come, I beseech you, lend me twenty\r\nfrancs, so that I may buy a dressing-gown; it is intolerable always to\r\nbe in a coat and boots! And what a coat, sir, for a prince of the\r\nCavalcanti!”\r\n\r\nThe keeper turned his back, and shrugged his shoulders; he did not even\r\nlaugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so; he had heard so\r\nmany utter the same things,—indeed, he heard nothing else.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Andrea, “you are a man void of compassion; I’ll have you\r\nturned out.”\r\n\r\nThis made the keeper turn around, and he burst into a loud laugh. The\r\nprisoners then approached and formed a circle.\r\n\r\n“I tell you that with that wretched sum,” continued Andrea, “I could\r\nobtain a coat, and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor I\r\nam daily expecting.”\r\n\r\n“Of course—of course,” said the prisoners;—“anyone can see he’s a\r\ngentleman!”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, lend him the twenty francs,” said the keeper, leaning on\r\nthe other shoulder; “surely you will not refuse a comrade!”\r\n\r\n50151m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I am no comrade of these people,” said the young man, proudly, “you\r\nhave no right to insult me thus.”\r\n\r\nThe thieves looked at one another with low murmurs, and a storm\r\ngathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner, raised less by his\r\nown words than by the manner of the keeper. The latter, sure of\r\nquelling the tempest when the waves became too violent, allowed them to\r\nrise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate\r\nAndrea, and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe thieves had already approached Andrea, some screaming, _“La\r\nsavate—La savate!”_26 a cruel operation, which consists in cuffing a\r\ncomrade who may have fallen into disgrace, not with an old shoe, but\r\nwith an iron-heeled one. Others proposed the _anguille_, another kind\r\nof recreation, in which a handkerchief is filled with sand, pebbles,\r\nand two-sous pieces, when they have them, which the wretches beat like\r\na flail over the head and shoulders of the unhappy sufferer.\r\n\r\n“Let us horsewhip the fine gentleman!” said others.\r\n\r\nBut Andrea, turning towards them, winked his eyes, rolled his tongue\r\naround his cheeks, and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a\r\nhundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent. It was a\r\nMasonic sign Caderousse had taught him. He was immediately recognized\r\nas one of them; the handkerchief was thrown down, and the iron-heeled\r\nshoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged.\r\n\r\nSome voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right; that he\r\nintended to be civil, in his way, and that they would set the example\r\nof liberty of conscience,—and the mob retired. The keeper was so\r\nstupefied at this scene that he took Andrea by the hands and began\r\nexamining his person, attributing the sudden submission of the inmates\r\nof the Lions’ Den to something more substantial than mere fascination.\r\n\r\nAndrea made no resistance, although he protested against it. Suddenly a\r\nvoice was heard at the wicket.\r\n\r\n“Benedetto!” exclaimed an inspector. The keeper relaxed his hold.\r\n\r\n“I am called,” said Andrea.\r\n\r\n“To the visitors’ room!” said the same voice.\r\n\r\n“You see someone pays me a visit. Ah, my dear sir, you will see whether\r\na Cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person!”\r\n\r\nAnd Andrea, gliding through the court like a black shadow, rushed out\r\nthrough the wicket, leaving his comrades, and even the keeper, lost in\r\nwonder. Certainly a call to the visitors’ room had scarcely astonished\r\nAndrea less than themselves, for the wily youth, instead of making use\r\nof his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into La Force,\r\nhad maintained a rigid silence.\r\n\r\n50153m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Everything,” he said, “proves me to be under the protection of some\r\npowerful person,—this sudden fortune, the facility with which I have\r\novercome all obstacles, an unexpected family and an illustrious name\r\nawarded to me, gold showered down upon me, and the most splendid\r\nalliances about to be entered into. An unhappy lapse of fortune and the\r\nabsence of my protector have cast me down, certainly, but not forever.\r\nThe hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth\r\nto save me at the very moment when I shall think myself sinking into\r\nthe abyss. Why should I risk an imprudent step? It might alienate my\r\nprotector. He has two means of extricating me from this dilemma,—the\r\none by a mysterious escape, managed through bribery; the other by\r\nbuying off my judges with gold. I will say and do nothing until I am\r\nconvinced that he has quite abandoned me, and then——”\r\n\r\nAndrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever. The unfortunate\r\nyouth was intrepid in the attack, and rude in the defence. He had borne\r\nwith the public prison, and with privations of all sorts; still, by\r\ndegrees nature, or rather custom, had prevailed, and he suffered from\r\nbeing naked, dirty, and hungry. It was at this moment of discomfort\r\nthat the inspector’s voice called him to the visiting-room. Andrea felt\r\nhis heart leap with joy. It was too soon for a visit from the examining\r\nmagistrate, and too late for one from the director of the prison, or\r\nthe doctor; it must, then, be the visitor he hoped for. Behind the\r\ngrating of the room into which Andrea had been led, he saw, while his\r\neyes dilated with surprise, the dark and intelligent face of M.\r\nBertuccio, who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron\r\nbars, the bolted doors, and the shadow which moved behind the other\r\ngrating.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Andrea, deeply affected.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, Benedetto,” said Bertuccio, with his deep, hollow voice.\r\n\r\n“You—you?” said the young man, looking fearfully around him.\r\n\r\n“Do you not recognize me, unhappy child?”\r\n\r\n“Silence,—be silent!” said Andrea, who knew the delicate sense of\r\nhearing possessed by the walls; “for Heaven’s sake, do not speak so\r\nloud!”\r\n\r\n“You wish to speak with me alone, do you not?” said Bertuccio.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes.”\r\n\r\n“That is well.”\r\n\r\nAnd Bertuccio, feeling in his pocket, signed to a keeper whom he saw\r\nthrough the window of the wicket.\r\n\r\n“Read?” he said.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” asked Andrea.\r\n\r\n“An order to conduct you to a room, and to leave you there to talk to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried Andrea, leaping with joy. Then he mentally added,—“Still my\r\nunknown protector! I am not forgotten. They wish for secrecy, since we\r\nare to converse in a private room. I understand, Bertuccio has been\r\nsent by my protector.”\r\n\r\nThe keeper spoke for a moment with an official, then opened the iron\r\ngates and conducted Andrea to a room on the first floor. The room was\r\nwhitewashed, as is the custom in prisons, but it looked quite brilliant\r\nto a prisoner, though a stove, a bed, a chair, and a table formed the\r\nwhole of its sumptuous furniture. Bertuccio sat down upon the chair,\r\nAndrea threw himself upon the bed; the keeper retired.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the steward, “what have you to tell me?”\r\n\r\n“And you?” said Andrea.\r\n\r\n“You speak first.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no. You must have much to tell me, since you have come to seek\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n50155m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, be it so. You have continued your course of villany; you have\r\nrobbed—you have assassinated.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I should say! If you had me taken to a private room only to tell\r\nme this, you might have saved yourself the trouble. I know all these\r\nthings. But there are some with which, on the contrary, I am not\r\nacquainted. Let us talk of those, if you please. Who sent you?”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, you are going on quickly, M. Benedetto!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and to the point. Let us dispense with useless words. Who sends\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“No one.”\r\n\r\n“How did you know I was in prison?”\r\n\r\n“I recognized you, some time since, as the insolent dandy who so\r\ngracefully mounted his horse in the Champs-Élysées.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the Champs-Élysées? Ah, yes; we burn, as they say at the game of\r\npincette. The Champs-Élysées? Come, let us talk a little about my\r\nfather.”\r\n\r\n“Who, then, am I?”\r\n\r\n“You, sir?—you are my adopted father. But it was not you, I presume,\r\nwho placed at my disposal 100,000 francs, which I spent in four or five\r\nmonths; it was not you who manufactured an Italian gentleman for my\r\nfather; it was not you who introduced me into the world, and had me\r\ninvited to a certain dinner at Auteuil, which I fancy I am eating at\r\nthis moment, in company with the most distinguished people in\r\nParis—amongst the rest with a certain procureur, whose acquaintance I\r\ndid very wrong not to cultivate, for he would have been very useful to\r\nme just now;—it was not you, in fact, who bailed me for one or two\r\nmillions, when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place.\r\nCome, speak, my worthy Corsican, speak!”\r\n\r\n“What do you wish me to say?”\r\n\r\n“I will help you. You were speaking of the Champs-Élysées just now,\r\nworthy foster-father.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Well, in the Champs-Élysées there resides a very rich gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“At whose house you robbed and murdered, did you not?”\r\n\r\n“I believe I did.”\r\n\r\n“The Count of Monte Cristo?”\r\n\r\n“’Tis you who have named him, as M. Racine says. Well, am I to rush\r\ninto his arms, and strain him to my heart, crying, ‘My father, my\r\nfather!’ like Monsieur Pixérécourt.”27\r\n\r\n“Do not let us jest,” gravely replied Bertuccio, “and dare not to utter\r\nthat name again as you have pronounced it.”\r\n\r\n“Bah,” said Andrea, a little overcome, by the solemnity of Bertuccio’s\r\nmanner, “why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because the person who bears it is too highly favored by Heaven to be\r\nthe father of such a wretch as you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, these are fine words.”\r\n\r\n“And there will be fine doings, if you do not take care.”\r\n\r\n“Menaces—I do not fear them. I will say——”\r\n\r\n“Do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself?” said\r\nBertuccio, in so calm a tone, and with so steadfast a look, that Andrea\r\nwas moved to the very soul. “Do you think you have to do with\r\ngalley-slaves, or novices in the world? Benedetto, you are fallen into\r\nterrible hands; they are ready to open for you—make use of them. Do not\r\nplay with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment, but which\r\nthey can take up again instantly, if you attempt to intercept their\r\nmovements.”\r\n\r\n50157m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“My father—I will know who my father is,” said the obstinate youth; “I\r\nwill perish if I must, but I _will_ know it. What does scandal signify\r\nto me? What possessions, what reputation, what ‘pull,’ as Beauchamp\r\nsays,—have I? You great people always lose something by scandal,\r\nnotwithstanding your millions. Come, who is my father?”\r\n\r\n“I came to tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” cried Benedetto, his eyes sparkling with joy. Just then the door\r\nopened, and the jailer, addressing himself to Bertuccio, said:\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, sir, but the examining magistrate is waiting for the\r\nprisoner.”\r\n\r\n“And so closes our interview,” said Andrea to the worthy steward; “I\r\nwish the troublesome fellow were at the devil!”\r\n\r\n“I will return tomorrow,” said Bertuccio.\r\n\r\n“Good! Gendarmes, I am at your service. Ah, sir, do leave a few crowns\r\nfor me at the gate that I may have some things I am in need of!”\r\n\r\n“It shall be done,” replied Bertuccio.\r\n\r\nAndrea extended his hand; Bertuccio kept his own in his pocket, and\r\nmerely jingled a few pieces of money.\r\n\r\n“That’s what I mean,” said Andrea, endeavoring to smile, quite overcome\r\nby the strange tranquillity of Bertuccio.\r\n\r\n“Can I be deceived?” he murmured, as he stepped into the oblong and\r\ngrated vehicle which they call “the salad basket.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind, we shall see! Tomorrow, then!” he added, turning towards\r\nBertuccio.\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow!” replied the steward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 108. The Judge\r\n\r\nWe remember that the Abbé Busoni remained alone with Noirtier in the\r\nchamber of death, and that the old man and the priest were the sole\r\nguardians of the young girl’s body. Perhaps it was the Christian\r\nexhortations of the abbé, perhaps his kind charity, perhaps his\r\npersuasive words, which had restored the courage of Noirtier, for ever\r\nsince he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded\r\nto a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive\r\naffection for Valentine.\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death.\r\nThe whole establishment had been changed; another valet was engaged for\r\nhimself, a new servant for Noirtier, two women had entered Madame de\r\nVillefort’s service,—in fact, everywhere, to the concierge and\r\ncoachmen, new faces were presented to the different masters of the\r\nhouse, thus widening the division which had always existed between the\r\nmembers of the same family. The assizes, also, were about to begin, and\r\nVillefort, shut up in his room, exerted himself with feverish anxiety\r\nin drawing up the case against the murderer of Caderousse. This affair,\r\nlike all those in which the Count of Monte Cristo had interfered,\r\ncaused a great sensation in Paris. The proofs were certainly not\r\nconvincing, since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped\r\ngalley-slave on his death-bed, and who might have been actuated by\r\nhatred or revenge in accusing his companion. But the mind of the\r\nprocureur was made up; he felt assured that Benedetto was guilty, and\r\nhe hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his\r\nself-love, which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of\r\nVillefort, who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming\r\nassizes. He had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever, to\r\nevade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the\r\npurpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of\r\ntrial. And then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor\r\nValentine, and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent,\r\nthat no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional\r\nduties, which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief.\r\n\r\nOnce only had Villefort seen his father; it was the day after that upon\r\nwhich Bertuccio had paid his second visit to Benedetto, when the latter\r\nwas to learn his father’s name. The magistrate, harassed and fatigued,\r\nhad descended to the garden of his house, and in a gloomy mood, similar\r\nto that in which Tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies, he began\r\nknocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the\r\nrose-trees, which, placed along the avenue, seemed like the spectres of\r\nthe brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season.\r\n\r\nMore than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous\r\nboarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure, always returning\r\nby the same path, to begin his walk again, at the same pace and with\r\nthe same gesture, when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the\r\nhouse, whence he heard the noisy play of his son, who had returned from\r\nschool to spend the Sunday and Monday with his mother.\r\n\r\nWhile doing so, he observed M. Noirtier at one of the open windows,\r\nwhere the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of\r\nthe sun which yet yielded some heat, and was now shining upon the dying\r\nflowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony.\r\n\r\nThe eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which Villefort could\r\nscarcely distinguish. His glance was so full of hate, of ferocity, and\r\nsavage impatience, that Villefort turned out of the path he had been\r\npursuing, to see upon what person this dark look was directed.\r\n\r\nThen he saw beneath a thick clump of linden-trees, which were nearly\r\ndivested of foliage, Madame de Villefort sitting with a book in her\r\nhand, the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her\r\nson, or to throw back his elastic ball, which he obstinately threw from\r\nthe drawing-room into the garden.\r\n\r\nVillefort became pale; he understood the old man’s meaning.\r\n\r\nNoirtier continued to look at the same object, but suddenly his glance\r\nwas transferred from the wife to the husband, and Villefort himself had\r\nto submit to the searching investigation of eyes, which, while changing\r\ntheir direction and even their language, had lost none of their\r\nmenacing expression. Madame de Villefort, unconscious of the passions\r\nthat exhausted their fire over her head, at that moment held her son’s\r\nball, and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss. Edward\r\nbegged for a long while, the maternal kiss probably not offering\r\nsufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it;\r\nhowever at length he decided, leaped out of the window into a cluster\r\nof heliotropes and daisies, and ran to his mother, his forehead\r\nstreaming with perspiration. Madame de Villefort wiped his forehead,\r\npressed her lips upon it, and sent him back with the ball in one hand\r\nand some bonbons in the other.\r\n\r\nVillefort, drawn by an irresistible attraction, like that of the bird\r\nto the serpent, walked towards the house. As he approached it,\r\nNoirtier’s gaze followed him, and his eyes appeared of such a fiery\r\nbrightness that Villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart.\r\nIn that earnest look might be read a deep reproach, as well as a\r\nterrible menace. Then Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as though to\r\nremind his son of a forgotten oath.\r\n\r\n“It is well, sir,” replied Villefort from below,—“it is well; have\r\npatience but one day longer; what I have said I will do.”\r\n\r\nNoirtier seemed to be calmed by these words, and turned his eyes with\r\nindifference to the other side. Villefort violently unbuttoned his\r\ngreatcoat, which seemed to strangle him, and passing his livid hand\r\nacross his forehead, entered his study.\r\n\r\nThe night was cold and still; the family had all retired to rest but\r\nVillefort, who alone remained up, and worked till five o’clock in the\r\nmorning, reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by\r\nthe examining magistrates, compiling the depositions of the witnesses,\r\nand putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation, which was\r\none of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Monday, was the first sitting of the assizes. The morning\r\ndawned dull and gloomy, and Villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon\r\nthe lines he had traced in red ink. The magistrate had slept for a\r\nshort time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles; its\r\nflickerings awoke him, and he found his fingers as damp and purple as\r\nthough they had been dipped in blood.\r\n\r\nHe opened the window; a bright yellow streak crossed the sky, and\r\nseemed to divide in half the poplars, which stood out in black relief\r\non the horizon. In the clover-fields beyond the chestnut-trees, a lark\r\nwas mounting up to heaven, while pouring out her clear morning song.\r\nThe damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort, and refreshed his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n“Today,” he said with an effort,—“today the man who holds the blade of\r\njustice must strike wherever there is guilt.”\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of Noirtier’s room,\r\nwhere he had seen him the preceding night. The curtain was drawn, and\r\nyet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed\r\nthe closed window as though it had been open, and as if through the\r\nopening he had beheld the menacing old man.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he murmured,—“yes, be satisfied.”\r\n\r\nHis head dropped upon his chest, and in this position he paced his\r\nstudy; then he threw himself, dressed as he was, upon a sofa, less to\r\nsleep than to rest his limbs, cramped with cold and study. By degrees\r\neveryone awoke. Villefort, from his study, heard the successive noises\r\nwhich accompany the life of a house,—the opening and shutting of doors,\r\nthe ringing of Madame de Villefort’s bell, to summon the waiting-maid,\r\nmingled with the first shouts of the child, who rose full of the\r\nenjoyment of his age. Villefort also rang; his new valet brought him\r\nthe papers, and with them a cup of chocolate.\r\n\r\n“What are you bringing me?” said he.\r\n\r\n“A cup of chocolate.”\r\n\r\n“I did not ask for it. Who has paid me this attention?”\r\n\r\n“My mistress, sir. She said you would have to speak a great deal in the\r\nmurder case, and that you should take something to keep up your\r\nstrength;” and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the\r\nsofa, which was, like all the rest, covered with papers.\r\n\r\nThe valet then left the room. Villefort looked for an instant with a\r\ngloomy expression, then, suddenly, taking it up with a nervous motion,\r\nhe swallowed its contents at one draught. It might have been thought\r\nthat he hoped the beverage would be mortal, and that he sought for\r\ndeath to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil.\r\nHe then rose, and paced his room with a smile it would have been\r\nterrible to witness. The chocolate was inoffensive, for M. de Villefort\r\nfelt no effects.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast-hour arrived, but M. de Villefort was not at table. The\r\nvalet re-entered.\r\n\r\n“Madame de Villefort wishes to remind you, sir,” he said, “that eleven\r\no’clock has just struck, and that the trial commences at twelve.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Villefort, “what then?”\r\n\r\n“Madame de Villefort is dressed; she is quite ready, and wishes to know\r\nif she is to accompany you, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Where to?”\r\n\r\n“To the Palais.”\r\n\r\n“What to do?”\r\n\r\n“My mistress wishes much to be present at the trial.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Villefort, with a startling accent; “does she wish that?”\r\n\r\nThe servant drew back and said, “If you wish to go alone, sir, I will\r\ngo and tell my mistress.”\r\n\r\nVillefort remained silent for a moment, and dented his pale cheeks with\r\nhis nails.\r\n\r\n“Tell your mistress,” he at length answered, “that I wish to speak to\r\nher, and I beg she will wait for me in her own room.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Then come to dress and shave me.”\r\n\r\n“Directly, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe valet re-appeared almost instantly, and, having shaved his master,\r\nassisted him to dress entirely in black. When he had finished, he said:\r\n\r\n“My mistress said she should expect you, sir, as soon as you had\r\nfinished dressing.”\r\n\r\n“I am going to her.”\r\n\r\nAnd Villefort, with his papers under his arm and hat in hand, directed\r\nhis steps toward the apartment of his wife.\r\n\r\nAt the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp, pale brow. He then\r\nentered the room. Madame de Villefort was sitting on an ottoman and\r\nimpatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets\r\nwhich young Edward, by way of amusing himself, was tearing to pieces\r\nbefore his mother could finish reading them. She was dressed to go out,\r\nher bonnet was placed beside her on a chair, and her gloves were on her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“Ah, here you are, monsieur,” she said in her naturally calm voice;\r\n“but how pale you are! Have you been working all night? Why did you not\r\ncome down to breakfast? Well, will you take me, or shall I take\r\nEdward?”\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one\r\nanswer, but to all her inquiries M. de Villefort remained mute and cold\r\nas a statue.\r\n\r\n“Edward,” said Villefort, fixing an imperious glance on the child, “go\r\nand play in the drawing-room, my dear; I wish to speak to your mamma.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance,\r\nthat resolute tone, and the awfully strange preliminaries. Edward\r\nraised his head, looked at his mother, and then, finding that she did\r\nnot confirm the order, began cutting off the heads of his leaden\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n“Edward,” cried M. de Villefort, so harshly that the child started up\r\nfrom the floor, “do you hear me?—Go!”\r\n\r\nThe child, unaccustomed to such treatment, arose, pale and trembling;\r\nit would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or\r\npassion. His father went up to him, took him in his arms, and kissed\r\nhis forehead.\r\n\r\n“Go,” he said: “go, my child.” Edward ran out.\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort went to the door, which he closed behind the child, and\r\nbolted.\r\n\r\n“Dear me!” said the young woman, endeavoring to read her husband’s\r\ninmost thoughts, while a smile passed over her countenance which froze\r\nthe impassibility of Villefort; “what is the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Madame, where do you keep the poison you generally use?” said the\r\nmagistrate, without any introduction, placing himself between his wife\r\nand the door.\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of\r\na bird which, looking up, sees the murderous trap closing over its\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nA hoarse, broken tone, which was neither a cry nor a sigh, escaped from\r\nher, while she became deadly pale.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” she said, “I—I do not understand you.”\r\n\r\nAnd, in her first paroxysm of terror, she had raised herself from the\r\nsofa, in the next, stronger very likely than the other, she fell down\r\nagain on the cushions.\r\n\r\n“I asked you,” continued Villefort, in a perfectly calm tone, “where\r\nyou conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my\r\nfather-in-law, M. de Saint-Méran, my mother-in-law, Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran, Barrois, and my daughter Valentine.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir,” exclaimed Madame de Villefort, clasping her hands, “what do\r\nyou say?”\r\n\r\n“It is not for you to interrogate, but to answer.”\r\n\r\n“Is it to the judge or to the husband?” stammered Madame de Villefort.\r\n\r\n“To the judge—to the judge, madame!” It was terrible to behold the\r\nfrightful pallor of that woman, the anguish of her look, the trembling\r\nof her whole frame.\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir,” she muttered, “ah, sir,” and this was all.\r\n\r\n“You do not answer, madame!” exclaimed the terrible interrogator. Then\r\nhe added, with a smile yet more terrible than his anger, “It is true,\r\nthen; you do not deny it!” She moved forward. “And you cannot deny it!”\r\nadded Villefort, extending his hand toward her, as though to seize her\r\nin the name of justice. “You have accomplished these different crimes\r\nwith impudent address, but which could only deceive those whose\r\naffections for you blinded them. Since the death of Madame de\r\nSaint-Méran, I have known that a poisoner lived in my house. M.\r\nd’Avrigny warned me of it. After the death of Barrois my suspicions\r\nwere directed towards an angel,—those suspicions which, even when there\r\nis no crime, are always alive in my heart; but after the death of\r\nValentine, there has been no doubt in my mind, madame, and not only in\r\nmine, but in those of others; thus your crime, known by two persons,\r\nsuspected by many, will soon become public, and, as I told you just\r\nnow, you no longer speak to the husband, but to the judge.”\r\n\r\n50165m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young woman hid her face in her hands.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir,” she stammered, “I beseech you, do not believe appearances.”\r\n\r\n“Are you, then, a coward?” cried Villefort, in a contemptuous voice.\r\n“But I have always observed that poisoners were cowards. Can you be a\r\ncoward, you, who have had the courage to witness the death of two old\r\nmen and a young girl murdered by you?”\r\n\r\n“Sir! sir!”\r\n\r\n“Can you be a coward?” continued Villefort, with increasing excitement,\r\n“you, who could count, one by one, the minutes of four death agonies?\r\n_You_, who have arranged your infernal plans, and removed the beverages\r\nwith a talent and precision almost miraculous? Have you, then, who have\r\ncalculated everything with such nicety, have you forgotten to calculate\r\none thing—I mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to?\r\nOh, it is impossible—you must have saved some surer, more subtle and\r\ndeadly poison than any other, that you might escape the punishment that\r\nyou deserve. You have done this—I hope so, at least.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort stretched out her hands, and fell on her knees.\r\n\r\n“I understand,” he said, “you confess; but a confession made to the\r\njudges, a confession made at the last moment, extorted when the crime\r\ncannot be denied, diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the\r\nguilty!”\r\n\r\n“The punishment?” exclaimed Madame de Villefort, “the punishment,\r\nmonsieur? Twice you have pronounced that word!”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. Did you hope to escape it because you were four times\r\nguilty? Did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are\r\nthe wife of him who pronounces it?—No, madame, no; the scaffold awaits\r\nthe poisoner, whoever she may be, unless, as I just said, the poisoner\r\nhas taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her\r\ndeadliest poison.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort uttered a wild cry, and a hideous and\r\nuncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features.\r\n\r\n“Oh, do not fear the scaffold, madame,” said the magistrate; “I will\r\nnot dishonor you, since that would be dishonor to myself; no, if you\r\nhave heard me distinctly, you will understand that you are not to die\r\non the scaffold.”\r\n\r\n“No, I do not understand; what do you mean?” stammered the unhappy\r\nwoman, completely overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n“I mean that the wife of the first magistrate in the capital shall not,\r\nby her infamy, soil an unblemished name; that she shall not, with one\r\nblow, dishonor her husband and her child.”\r\n\r\n“No, no—oh, no!”\r\n\r\n“Well, madame, it will be a laudable action on your part, and I will\r\nthank you for it!”\r\n\r\n“You will thank me—for what?”\r\n\r\n“For what you have just said.”\r\n\r\n“What did I say? Oh, my brain whirls; I no longer understand anything.\r\nOh, my God, my God!”\r\n\r\nAnd she rose, with her hair dishevelled, and her lips foaming.\r\n\r\n“Have you answered the question I put to you on entering the\r\nroom?—where do you keep the poison you generally use, madame?”\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort raised her arms to heaven, and convulsively struck\r\none hand against the other.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” she vociferated, “no, you cannot wish that!”\r\n\r\n50169m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What I do not wish, madame, is that you should perish on the scaffold.\r\nDo you understand?” asked Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Oh, mercy, mercy, monsieur!”\r\n\r\n“What I require is, that justice be done. I am on the earth to punish,\r\nmadame,” he added, with a flaming glance; “any other woman, were it the\r\nqueen herself, I would send to the executioner; but to you I shall be\r\nmerciful. To you I will say, ‘Have you not, madame, put aside some of\r\nthe surest, deadliest, most speedy poison?’”\r\n\r\n50170m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, pardon me, sir; let me live!”\r\n\r\n“She is cowardly,” said Villefort.\r\n\r\n“Reflect that I am your wife!”\r\n\r\n“You are a poisoner.”\r\n\r\n“In the name of Heaven!”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“In the name of the love you once bore me!”\r\n\r\n“No, no!”\r\n\r\n“In the name of our child! Ah, for the sake of our child, let me live!”\r\n\r\n50167m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No, no, no, I tell you; one day, if I allow you to live, you will\r\nperhaps kill him, as you have the others!”\r\n\r\n“I?—I kill my boy?” cried the distracted mother, rushing toward\r\nVillefort; “I kill my son? Ha, ha, ha!” and a frightful, demoniac laugh\r\nfinished the sentence, which was lost in a hoarse rattle.\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort fell at her husband’s feet. He approached her.\r\n\r\n“Think of it, madame,” he said; “if, on my return, justice has not been\r\nsatisfied, I will denounce you with my own mouth, and arrest you with\r\nmy own hands!”\r\n\r\nShe listened, panting, overwhelmed, crushed; her eye alone lived, and\r\nglared horribly.\r\n\r\n“Do you understand me?” he said. “I am going down there to pronounce\r\nthe sentence of death against a murderer. If I find you alive on my\r\nreturn, you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Villefort sighed; her nerves gave way, and she sunk on the\r\ncarpet. The king’s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity;\r\nhe looked upon her less severely, and, bowing to her, said slowly:\r\n\r\n“Farewell, madame, farewell!”\r\n\r\nThat farewell struck Madame de Villefort like the executioner’s knife.\r\nShe fainted. The procureur went out, after having double-locked the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 109. The Assizes\r\n\r\nThe Benedetto affair, as it was called at the Palais, and by people in\r\ngeneral, had produced a tremendous sensation. Frequenting the Café de\r\nParis, the Boulevard de Gand, and the Bois de Boulogne, during his\r\nbrief career of splendor, the false Cavalcanti had formed a host of\r\nacquaintances. The papers had related his various adventures, both as\r\nthe man of fashion and the galley-slave; and as everyone who had been\r\npersonally acquainted with Prince Andrea Cavalcanti experienced a\r\nlively curiosity in his fate, they all determined to spare no trouble\r\nin endeavoring to witness the trial of M. Benedetto for the murder of\r\nhis comrade in chains.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of many, Benedetto appeared, if not a victim to, at least\r\nan instance of, the fallibility of the law. M. Cavalcanti, his father,\r\nhad been seen in Paris, and it was expected that he would re-appear to\r\nclaim the illustrious outcast. Many, also, who were not aware of the\r\ncircumstances attending his withdrawal from Paris, were struck with the\r\nworthy appearance, the gentlemanly bearing, and the knowledge of the\r\nworld displayed by the old patrician, who certainly played the nobleman\r\nvery well, so long as he said nothing, and made no arithmetical\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\nAs for the accused himself, many remembered him as being so amiable, so\r\nhandsome, and so liberal, that they chose to think him the victim of\r\nsome conspiracy, since in this world large fortunes frequently excite\r\nthe malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy.\r\n\r\nEveryone, therefore, ran to the court; some to witness the sight,\r\nothers to comment upon it. From seven o’clock in the morning a crowd\r\nwas stationed at the iron gates, and an hour before the trial commenced\r\nthe hall was full of the privileged. Before the entrance of the\r\nmagistrates, and indeed frequently afterwards, a court of justice, on\r\ndays when some especial trial is to take place, resembles a\r\ndrawing-room where many persons recognize each other and converse if\r\nthey can do so without losing their seats; or, if they are separated by\r\ntoo great a number of lawyers, communicate by signs.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the magnificent autumn days which make amends for a short\r\nsummer; the clouds which M. de Villefort had perceived at sunrise had\r\nall disappeared as if by magic, and one of the softest and most\r\nbrilliant days of September shone forth in all its splendor.\r\n\r\nBeauchamp, one of the kings of the press, and therefore claiming the\r\nright of a throne everywhere, was eying everybody through his monocle.\r\nHe perceived Château-Renaud and Debray, who had just gained the good\r\ngraces of a sergeant-at-arms, and who had persuaded the latter to let\r\nthem stand before, instead of behind him, as they ought to have done.\r\nThe worthy sergeant had recognized the minister’s secretary and the\r\nmillionnaire, and, by way of paying extra attention to his noble\r\nneighbors, promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to\r\nBeauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Beauchamp, “we shall see our friend!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed!” replied Debray. “That worthy prince. Deuce take those\r\nItalian princes!”\r\n\r\n“A man, too, who could boast of Dante for a genealogist, and could\r\nreckon back to the _Divina Comedia_.”\r\n\r\n“A nobility of the rope!” said Château-Renaud phlegmatically.\r\n\r\n“He will be condemned, will he not?” asked Debray of Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, I think we should ask you that question; you know such\r\nnews much better than we do. Did you see the president at the\r\nminister’s last night?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What did he say?”\r\n\r\n“Something which will surprise you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, make haste and tell me, then; it is a long time since that has\r\nhappened.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he told me that Benedetto, who is considered a serpent of\r\nsubtlety and a giant of cunning, is really but a very commonplace,\r\nsilly rascal, and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be\r\nmade on his phrenological organs after his death.”\r\n\r\n“Bah,” said Beauchamp, “he played the prince very well.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for you who detest those unhappy princes, Beauchamp, and are\r\nalways delighted to find fault with them; but not for me, who discover\r\na gentleman by instinct, and who scent out an aristocratic family like\r\na very bloodhound of heraldry.”\r\n\r\n“Then you never believed in the principality?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.—in the principality, but not in the prince.”\r\n\r\n“Not so bad,” said Beauchamp; “still, I assure you, he passed very well\r\nwith many people; I saw him at the ministers’ houses.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” said Château-Renaud. “The idea of thinking ministers\r\nunderstand anything about princes!”\r\n\r\n“There is something in what you have just said,” said Beauchamp,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Debray to Beauchamp, “if I spoke to the president, _you_\r\nmust have been with the procureur.”\r\n\r\n“It was an impossibility; for the last week M. de Villefort has\r\nsecluded himself. It is natural enough; this strange chain of domestic\r\nafflictions, followed by the no less strange death of his daughter——”\r\n\r\n“Strange? What do you mean, Beauchamp?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the\r\nminister’s?” said Beauchamp, placing his eye-glass in his eye, where he\r\ntried to make it remain.\r\n\r\n“My dear sir,” said Château-Renaud, “allow me to tell you that you do\r\nnot understand that manœuvre with the eye-glass half so well as Debray.\r\nGive him a lesson, Debray.”\r\n\r\n“Stay,” said Beauchamp, “surely I am not deceived.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“It is she!”\r\n\r\n“Whom do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“They said she had left.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle Eugénie?” said Château-Renaud; “has she returned?”\r\n\r\n“No, but her mother.”\r\n\r\n“Madame Danglars? Nonsense! Impossible!” said Château-Renaud; “only ten\r\ndays after the flight of her daughter, and three days from the\r\nbankruptcy of her husband?”\r\n\r\nDebray colored slightly, and followed with his eyes the direction of\r\nBeauchamp’s glance.\r\n\r\n“Come,” he said, “it is only a veiled lady, some foreign princess,\r\nperhaps the mother of Cavalcanti. But you were just speaking on a very\r\ninteresting topic, Beauchamp.”\r\n\r\n“I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; you were telling us about the extraordinary death of Valentine.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, so I was. But how is it that Madame de Villefort is not\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“Poor, dear woman,” said Debray, “she is no doubt occupied in\r\ndistilling balm for the hospitals, or in making cosmetics for herself\r\nor friends. Do you know she spends two or three thousand crowns a year\r\nin this amusement? But I wonder she is not here. I should have been\r\npleased to see her, for I like her very much.”\r\n\r\n“And I hate her,” said Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know. Why do we love? Why do we hate? I detest her, from\r\nantipathy.”\r\n\r\n“Or, rather, by instinct.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so. But to return to what you were saying, Beauchamp.”\r\n\r\n“Well, do you know why they die so multitudinously at M. de\r\nVillefort’s?”\r\n\r\n“‘Multitudinously’ is good,” said Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“My good fellow, you’ll find the word in Saint-Simon.”\r\n\r\n“But the thing itself is at M. de Villefort’s; but let’s get back to\r\nthe subject.”\r\n\r\n“Talking of that,” said Debray, “Madame was making inquiries about that\r\nhouse, which for the last three months has been hung with black.”\r\n\r\n“Who is Madame?” asked Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“The minister’s wife, _pardieu!_”\r\n\r\n“Oh, your pardon! I never visit ministers; I leave that to the\r\nprinces.”\r\n\r\n“Really, you were only before sparkling, but now you are brilliant;\r\ntake compassion on us, or, like Jupiter, you will wither us up.”\r\n\r\n“I will not speak again,” said Château-Renaud; “pray have compassion\r\nupon me, and do not take up every word I say.”\r\n\r\n“Come, let us endeavor to get to the end of our story, Beauchamp; I\r\ntold you that yesterday Madame made inquiries of me upon the subject;\r\nenlighten me, and I will then communicate my information to her.”\r\n\r\n“Well, gentlemen, the reason people die so multitudinously (I like the\r\nword) at M. de Villefort’s is that there is an assassin in the house!”\r\n\r\nThe two young men shuddered, for the same idea had more than once\r\noccurred to them.\r\n\r\n“And who is the assassin;” they asked together.\r\n\r\n“Young Edward!” A burst of laughter from the auditors did not in the\r\nleast disconcert the speaker, who continued,—“Yes, gentlemen; Edward,\r\nthe infant phenomenon, who is quite an adept in the art of killing.”\r\n\r\n“You are jesting.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. I yesterday engaged a servant, who had just left M. de\r\nVillefort—I intend sending him away tomorrow, for he eats so\r\nenormously, to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in\r\nthat house. Well, now listen.”\r\n\r\n“We are listening.”\r\n\r\n“It appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle\r\ncontaining some drug, which he every now and then uses against those\r\nwho have displeased him. First, M. and Madame de Saint-Méran incurred\r\nhis displeasure, so he poured out three drops of his elixir—three drops\r\nwere sufficient; then followed Barrois, the old servant of M. Noirtier,\r\nwho sometimes rebuffed this little wretch—he therefore received the\r\nsame quantity of the elixir; the same happened to Valentine, of whom he\r\nwas jealous; he gave her the same dose as the others, and all was over\r\nfor her as well as the rest.”\r\n\r\n“Why, what nonsense are you telling us?” said Château-Renaud.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is an extraordinary story,” said Beauchamp; “is it not?”\r\n\r\n“It is absurd,” said Debray.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Beauchamp, “you doubt me? Well, you can ask my servant, or\r\nrather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow, it was the talk\r\nof the house.”\r\n\r\n“And this elixir, where is it? what is it?”\r\n\r\n“The child conceals it.”\r\n\r\n“But where did he find it?”\r\n\r\n“In his mother’s laboratory.”\r\n\r\n“Does his mother then, keep poisons in her laboratory?”\r\n\r\n“How can I tell? You are questioning me like a king’s attorney. I only\r\nrepeat what I have been told, and like my informant I can do no more.\r\nThe poor devil would eat nothing, from fear.”\r\n\r\n“It is incredible!”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear fellow, it is not at all incredible. You saw the child\r\npass through the Rue Richelieu last year, who amused himself with\r\nkilling his brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while\r\nthey slept. The generation who follow us are very precocious.”\r\n\r\n“Come, Beauchamp,” said Château-Renaud, “I will bet anything you do not\r\nbelieve a word of all you have been telling us. But I do not see the\r\nCount of Monte Cristo here.”\r\n\r\n“He is worn out,” said Debray; “besides, he could not well appear in\r\npublic, since he has been the dupe of the Cavalcanti, who, it appears,\r\npresented themselves to him with false letters of credit, and cheated\r\nhim out of 100,000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality.”\r\n\r\n“By the way, M. de Château-Renaud,” asked Beauchamp, “how is Morrel?”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, I have called three times without once seeing him. Still,\r\nhis sister did not seem uneasy, and told me that though she had not\r\nseen him for two or three days, she was sure he was well.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, now I think of it, the Count of Monte Cristo cannot appear in the\r\nhall,” said Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because he is an actor in the drama.”\r\n\r\n“Has he assassinated anyone, then?”\r\n\r\n“No, on the contrary, they wished to assassinate him. You know that it\r\nwas in leaving his house that M. de Caderousse was murdered by his\r\nfriend Benedetto. You know that the famous waistcoat was found in his\r\nhouse, containing the letter which stopped the signature of the\r\nmarriage-contract. Do you see the waistcoat? There it is, all\r\nblood-stained, on the desk, as a testimony of the crime.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, very good.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, gentlemen, here is the court; let us go back to our places.”\r\n\r\nA noise was heard in the hall; the sergeant called his two patrons with\r\nan energetic “hem!” and the door-keeper appearing, called out with that\r\nshrill voice peculiar to his order, ever since the days of\r\nBeaumarchais:\r\n\r\n“The court, gentlemen!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 110. The Indictment\r\n\r\nThe judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence;\r\nthe jury took their seats; M. de Villefort, the object of unusual\r\nattention, and we had almost said of general admiration, sat in the\r\narmchair and cast a tranquil glance around him. Everyone looked with\r\nastonishment on that grave and severe face, whose calm expression\r\npersonal griefs had been unable to disturb, and the aspect of a man who\r\nwas a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n“Gendarmes,” said the president, “lead in the accused.”\r\n\r\nAt these words the public attention became more intense, and all eyes\r\nwere turned towards the door through which Benedetto was to enter. The\r\ndoor soon opened and the accused appeared.\r\n\r\nThe same impression was experienced by all present, and no one was\r\ndeceived by the expression of his countenance. His features bore no\r\nsign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and\r\nblanches the cheek. His hands, gracefully placed, one upon his hat, the\r\nother in the opening of his white waistcoat, were not at all tremulous;\r\nhis eye was calm and even brilliant. Scarcely had he entered the hall\r\nwhen he glanced at the whole body of magistrates and assistants; his\r\neye rested longer on the president, and still more so on the king’s\r\nattorney.\r\n\r\nBy the side of Andrea was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his\r\ndefence, and who had been appointed by the court, for Andrea disdained\r\nto pay any attention to those details, to which he appeared to attach\r\nno importance. The lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face\r\nexpressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized\r\nthe prisoner.\r\n\r\n50181m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe president called for the indictment, revised as we know, by the\r\nclever and implacable pen of Villefort. During the reading of this,\r\nwhich was long, the public attention was continually drawn towards\r\nAndrea, who bore the inspection with Spartan unconcern. Villefort had\r\nnever been so concise and eloquent. The crime was depicted in the most\r\nvivid colors; the former life of the prisoner, his transformation, a\r\nreview of his life from the earliest period, were set forth with all\r\nthe talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like\r\nthat of the procureur. Benedetto was thus forever condemned in public\r\nopinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced.\r\n\r\nAndrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought\r\nagainst him. M. de Villefort, who examined him attentively, and who no\r\ndoubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was\r\naccustomed to use, in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes,\r\nnotwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze. At length the\r\nreading of the indictment was ended.\r\n\r\n“Accused,” said the president, “your name and surname?”\r\n\r\nAndrea arose.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, Mr. President,” he said, in a clear voice, “but I see you\r\nare going to adopt a course of questions through which I cannot follow\r\nyou. I have an idea, which I will explain by and by, of making an\r\nexception to the usual form of accusation. Allow me, then, if you\r\nplease, to answer in different order, or I will not do so at all.”\r\n\r\nThe astonished president looked at the jury, who in turn looked at\r\nVillefort. The whole assembly manifested great surprise, but Andrea\r\nappeared quite unmoved.\r\n\r\n“Your age?” said the president; “will you answer that question?”\r\n\r\n“I will answer that question, as well as the rest, Mr. President, but\r\nin its turn.”\r\n\r\n“Your age?” repeated the president.\r\n\r\n“I am twenty-one years old, or rather I shall be in a few days, as I\r\nwas born the night of the 27th of September, 1817.”\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort, who was busy taking down some notes, raised his head\r\nat the mention of this date.\r\n\r\n“Where were you born?” continued the president.\r\n\r\n“At Auteuil, near Paris.”\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort a second time raised his head, looked at Benedetto as\r\nif he had been gazing at the head of Medusa, and became livid. As for\r\nBenedetto, he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric\r\npocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n“Your profession?”\r\n\r\n“First I was a forger,” answered Andrea, as calmly as possible; “then I\r\nbecame a thief, and lately have become an assassin.”\r\n\r\nA murmur, or rather storm, of indignation burst from all parts of the\r\nassembly. The judges themselves appeared to be stupefied, and the jury\r\nmanifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of\r\nfashion. M. de Villefort pressed his hand upon his brow, which, at\r\nfirst pale, had become red and burning; then he suddenly arose and\r\nlooked around as though he had lost his senses—he wanted air.\r\n\r\n50183m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Are you looking for anything, Mr. Procureur?” asked Benedetto, with\r\nhis most ingratiating smile.\r\n\r\nM. de Villefort answered nothing, but sat, or rather threw himself down\r\nagain upon his chair.\r\n\r\n“And now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?” said the\r\npresident. “The brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and\r\nclassified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the\r\ncourt, both in the name of morality, and for the respect due to\r\nhumanity. You appear to consider this a point of honor, and it may be\r\nfor this reason, that you have delayed acknowledging your name. You\r\nwished it to be preceded by all these titles.”\r\n\r\n“It is quite wonderful, Mr. President, how entirely you have read my\r\nthoughts,” said Benedetto, in his softest voice and most polite manner.\r\n“This is, indeed, the reason why I begged you to alter the order of the\r\nquestions.”\r\n\r\nThe public astonishment had reached its height. There was no longer any\r\ndeceit or bravado in the manner of the accused. The audience felt that\r\na startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the president; “your name?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot tell you my name, since I do not know it; but I know my\r\nfather’s, and can tell it to you.”\r\n\r\nA painful giddiness overwhelmed Villefort; great drops of acrid sweat\r\nfell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand.\r\n\r\n“Repeat your father’s name,” said the president.\r\n\r\nNot a whisper, not a breath, was heard in that vast assembly; everyone\r\nwaited anxiously.\r\n\r\n“My father is king’s attorney,” replied Andrea calmly.\r\n\r\n50179m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“King’s attorney?” said the president, stupefied, and without noticing\r\nthe agitation which spread over the face of M. de Villefort; “king’s\r\nattorney?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and if you wish to know his name, I will tell it,—he is named\r\nVillefort.”\r\n\r\nThe explosion, which had been so long restrained from a feeling of\r\nrespect to the court of justice, now burst forth like thunder from the\r\nbreasts of all present; the court itself did not seek to restrain the\r\nfeelings of the audience. The exclamations, the insults addressed to\r\nBenedetto, who remained perfectly unconcerned, the energetic gestures,\r\nthe movement of the gendarmes, the sneers of the scum of the crowd\r\nalways sure to rise to the surface in case of any disturbance—all this\r\nlasted five minutes, before the door-keepers and magistrates were able\r\nto restore silence. In the midst of this tumult the voice of\r\nthe president was heard to exclaim:\r\n\r\n“Are you playing with justice, accused, and do you dare set your\r\nfellow-citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has\r\nnever been equalled?”\r\n\r\nSeveral persons hurried up to M. de Villefort, who sat half bowed over\r\nin his chair, offering him consolation, encouragement, and\r\nprotestations of zeal and sympathy. Order was re-established in the\r\nhall, except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one\r\nanother. A lady, it was said, had just fainted; they had supplied her\r\nwith a smelling-bottle, and she had recovered. During the scene of\r\ntumult, Andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly; then,\r\nleaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock, in the most\r\ngraceful attitude possible, he said:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, I assure you I had no idea of insulting the court, or of\r\nmaking a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable\r\nassembly. They ask my age; I tell it. They ask where I was born; I\r\nanswer. They ask my name, I cannot give it, since my parents abandoned\r\nme. But though I cannot give my own name, not possessing one, I can\r\ntell them my father’s. Now I repeat, my father is named M. de\r\nVillefort, and I am ready to prove it.”\r\n\r\nThere was an energy, a conviction, and a sincerity in the manner of the\r\nyoung man, which silenced the tumult. All eyes were turned for a moment\r\ntowards the procureur, who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt\r\nhad changed him into a corpse.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Andrea, commanding silence by his voice and manner;\r\n“I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have said.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said the irritated president, “you called yourself Benedetto,\r\ndeclared yourself an orphan, and claimed Corsica as your country.”\r\n\r\n“I said anything I pleased, in order that the solemn declaration I have\r\njust made should not be withheld, which otherwise would certainly have\r\nbeen the case. I now repeat that I was born at Auteuil on the night of\r\nthe 27th of September, 1817, and that I am the son of the procureur, M.\r\nde Villefort. Do you wish for any further details? I will give them. I\r\nwas born in No. 28, Rue de la Fontaine, in a room hung with red damask;\r\nmy father took me in his arms, telling my mother I was dead, wrapped me\r\nin a napkin marked with an H and an N, and carried me into a garden,\r\nwhere he buried me alive.”\r\n\r\nA shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of\r\nthe prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of M. de Villefort.\r\n\r\n“But how have you become acquainted with all these details?” asked the\r\npresident.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you, Mr. President. A man who had sworn vengeance against\r\nmy father, and had long watched his opportunity to kill him, had\r\nintroduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried\r\nme. He was concealed in a thicket; he saw my father bury something in\r\nthe ground, and stabbed him; then thinking the deposit might contain\r\nsome treasure he turned up the ground, and found me still living. The\r\nman carried me to the foundling asylum, where I was registered under\r\nthe number 37. Three months afterwards, a woman travelled from Rogliano\r\nto Paris to fetch me, and having claimed me as her son, carried me\r\naway. Thus, you see, though born in Paris, I was brought up in\r\nCorsica.”\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s silence, during which one could have fancied the\r\nhall empty, so profound was the stillness.\r\n\r\n“Proceed,” said the president.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, I might have lived happily amongst those good people, who\r\nadored me, but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which\r\nmy adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart. I increased in\r\nwickedness till I committed crime. One day when I cursed Providence for\r\nmaking me so wicked, and ordaining me to such a fate, my adopted father\r\nsaid to me, ‘Do not blaspheme, unhappy child, the crime is that of your\r\nfather, not yours,—of your father, who consigned you to hell if you\r\ndied, and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive.’ After that I\r\nceased to blaspheme, but I cursed my father. That is why I have uttered\r\nthe words for which you blame me; that is why I have filled this whole\r\nassembly with horror. If I have committed an additional crime, punish\r\nme, but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate\r\nhas been sad, bitter, and lamentable, then pity me.”\r\n\r\n“But your mother?” asked the president.\r\n\r\n“My mother thought me dead; she is not guilty. I did not even wish to\r\nknow her name, nor do I know it.”\r\n\r\nJust then a piercing cry, ending in a sob, burst from the centre of the\r\ncrowd, who encircled the lady who had before fainted, and who now fell\r\ninto a violent fit of hysterics. She was carried out of the hall, the\r\nthick veil which concealed her face dropped off, and Madame Danglars\r\nwas recognized. Notwithstanding his shattered nerves, the ringing\r\nsensation in his ears, and the madness which turned his brain,\r\nVillefort rose as he perceived her.\r\n\r\n“The proofs, the proofs!” said the president; “remember this tissue of\r\nhorrors must be supported by the clearest proofs.”\r\n\r\n“The proofs?” said Benedetto, laughing; “do you want proofs?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, look at M. de Villefort, and then ask me for proofs.”\r\n\r\nEveryone turned towards the procureur, who, unable to bear the\r\nuniversal gaze now riveted on him alone, advanced staggering into the\r\nmidst of the tribunal, with his hair dishevelled and his face indented\r\nwith the mark of his nails. The whole assembly uttered a long murmur of\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n“Father,” said Benedetto, “I am asked for proofs, do you wish me to\r\ngive them?”\r\n\r\n“No, no, it is useless,” stammered M. de Villefort in a hoarse voice;\r\n“no, it is useless!”\r\n\r\n“How useless?” cried the president, “what do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I mean that I feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly\r\nweight which crushes me. Gentlemen, I know I am in the hands of an\r\navenging God! We need no proofs; everything relating to this young man\r\nis true.”\r\n\r\nA dull, gloomy silence, like that which precedes some awful phenomenon\r\nof nature, pervaded the assembly, who shuddered in dismay.\r\n\r\n“What, M. de Villefort,” cried the president, “do you yield to an\r\nhallucination? What, are you no longer in possession of your senses?\r\nThis strange, unexpected, terrible accusation has disordered your\r\nreason. Come, recover.”\r\n\r\nThe procureur dropped his head; his teeth chattered like those of a man\r\nunder a violent attack of fever, and yet he was deadly pale.\r\n\r\n“I am in possession of all my senses, sir,” he said; “my body alone\r\nsuffers, as you may suppose. I acknowledge myself guilty of all the\r\nyoung man has brought against me, and from this hour hold myself under\r\nthe authority of the procureur who will succeed me.”\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke these words with a hoarse, choking voice, he staggered\r\ntowards the door, which was mechanically opened by a door-keeper. The\r\nwhole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and\r\nconfession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that\r\nwhich had been expected during the last fortnight by the Parisian\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Beauchamp, “let them now say that drama is unnatural!”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_” said Château-Renaud, “I would rather end my career like M.\r\nde Morcerf; a pistol-shot seems quite delightful compared with this\r\ncatastrophe.”\r\n\r\n“And moreover, it kills,” said Beauchamp.\r\n\r\n“And to think that I had an idea of marrying his daughter,” said\r\nDebray. “She did well to die, poor girl!”\r\n\r\n“The sitting is adjourned, gentlemen,” said the president; “fresh\r\ninquiries will be made, and the case will be tried next session by\r\nanother magistrate.”\r\n\r\nAs for Andrea, who was calm and more interesting than ever, he left the\r\nhall, escorted by gendarmes, who involuntarily paid him some attention.\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you think of this, my fine fellow?” asked Debray of the\r\nsergeant-at-arms, slipping a louis into his hand.\r\n\r\n“There will be extenuating circumstances,” he replied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 111. Expiation\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the density of the crowd, M. de Villefort saw it open\r\nbefore him. There is something so awe-inspiring in great afflictions\r\nthat even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally\r\nbeen to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe. Many\r\npeople have been assassinated in a tumult, but even criminals have\r\nrarely been insulted during trial. Thus Villefort passed through the\r\nmass of spectators and officers of the Palais, and withdrew. Though he\r\nhad acknowledged his guilt, he was protected by his grief. There are\r\nsome situations which men understand by instinct, but which reason is\r\npowerless to explain; in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives\r\nutterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow. Those\r\nwho hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an\r\nentire poem, and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in\r\nregarding his outburst as sublime.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which\r\nVillefort left the Palais. Every pulse beat with feverish excitement,\r\nevery nerve was strained, every vein swollen, and every part of his\r\nbody seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest, thus multiplying his\r\nagony a thousand-fold. He made his way along the corridors through\r\nforce of habit; he threw aside his magisterial robe, not out of\r\ndeference to etiquette, but because it was an unbearable burden, a\r\nveritable garb of Nessus, insatiate in torture. Having staggered as far\r\nas the Rue Dauphine, he perceived his carriage, awoke his sleeping\r\ncoachman by opening the door himself, threw himself on the cushions,\r\nand pointed towards the Faubourg Saint-Honoré; the carriage drove on.\r\n\r\nAll the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him; he\r\ncould not foresee the consequences; he could not contemplate the future\r\nwith the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a\r\ncontingency already familiar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGod was still in his heart. “God,” he murmured, not knowing what he\r\nsaid,—“God—God!” Behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the\r\nhand of God. The carriage rolled rapidly onward. Villefort, while\r\nturning restlessly on the cushions, felt something press against him.\r\nHe put out his hand to remove the object; it was a fan which Madame de\r\nVillefort had left in the carriage; this fan awakened a recollection\r\nwhich darted through his mind like lightning. He thought of his wife.\r\n\r\n50189m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh!” he exclaimed, as though a red-hot iron were piercing his heart.\r\n\r\nDuring the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his\r\nmind; now another object, not less terrible, suddenly presented itself.\r\nHis wife! He had just acted the inexorable judge with her, he had\r\ncondemned her to death, and she, crushed by remorse, struck with\r\nterror, covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of _his_\r\nirreproachable virtue,—she, a poor, weak woman, without help or the\r\npower of defending herself against his absolute and supreme will,—she\r\nmight at that very moment, perhaps, be preparing to die!\r\n\r\nAn hour had elapsed since her condemnation; at that moment, doubtless,\r\nshe was recalling all her crimes to her memory; she was asking pardon\r\nfor her sins; perhaps she was even writing a letter imploring\r\nforgiveness from her virtuous husband—a forgiveness she was purchasing\r\nwith her death! Villefort again groaned with anguish and despair.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” he exclaimed, “that woman became criminal only from associating\r\nwith me! I carried the infection of crime with me, and she has caught\r\nit as she would the typhus fever, the cholera, the plague! And yet I\r\nhave punished her—I have dared to tell her—_I_ have—‘Repent and die!’\r\nBut no, she must not die; she shall live, and with me. We will flee\r\nfrom Paris and go as far as the earth reaches. I told her of the\r\nscaffold; oh, Heavens, I forgot that it awaits me also! How could I\r\npronounce that word? Yes, we will fly; I will confess all to her,—I\r\nwill tell her daily that I also have committed a crime!—Oh, what an\r\nalliance—the tiger and the serpent; worthy wife of such as I am! She\r\n_must_ live that my infamy may diminish hers.”\r\n\r\nAnd Villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage.\r\n\r\n“Faster, faster!” he cried, in a tone which electrified the coachman.\r\nThe horses, impelled by fear, flew towards the house.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” repeated Villefort, as he approached his home—“yes, that\r\nwoman must live; she must repent, and educate my son, the sole\r\nsurvivor, with the exception of the indestructible old man, of the\r\nwreck of my house. She loves him; it was for his sake she has committed\r\nthese crimes. We ought never to despair of softening the heart of a\r\nmother who loves her child. She will repent, and no one will know that\r\nshe has been guilty. The events which have taken place in my house,\r\nthough they now occupy the public mind, will be forgotten in time, or\r\nif, indeed, a few enemies should persist in remembering them, why then\r\nI will add them to my list of crimes. What will it signify if one, two,\r\nor three more are added? My wife and child shall escape from this gulf,\r\ncarrying treasures with them; she will live and may yet be happy, since\r\nher child, in whom all her love is centred, will be with her. I shall\r\nhave performed a good action, and my heart will be lighter.”\r\n\r\nAnd the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time.\r\n\r\n50191m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped at the door of the house. Villefort leaped out of\r\nthe carriage, and saw that his servants were surprised at his early\r\nreturn; he could read no other expression on their features. Neither of\r\nthem spoke to him; they merely stood aside to let him pass by, as\r\nusual, nothing more. As he passed by M. Noirtier’s room, he perceived\r\ntwo figures through the half-open door; but he experienced no curiosity\r\nto know who was visiting his father; anxiety carried him on further.\r\n\r\n“Come,” he said, as he ascended the stairs leading to his wife’s room,\r\n“nothing is changed here.”\r\n\r\nHe then closed the door of the landing.\r\n\r\n“No one must disturb us,” he said; “I must speak freely to her, accuse\r\nmyself, and say”—he approached the door, touched the crystal handle,\r\nwhich yielded to his hand. “Not locked,” he cried; “that is well.”\r\n\r\nAnd he entered the little room in which Edward slept; for though the\r\nchild went to school during the day, his mother could not allow him to\r\nbe separated from her at night. With a single glance Villefort’s eye\r\nran through the room.\r\n\r\n“Not here,” he said; “doubtless she is in her bedroom.” He rushed\r\ntowards the door, found it bolted, and stopped, shuddering.\r\n\r\n“Héloïse!” he cried. He fancied he heard the sound of a piece of\r\nfurniture being removed.\r\n\r\n“Héloïse!” he repeated.\r\n\r\n“Who is there?” answered the voice of her he sought. He thought that\r\nvoice more feeble than usual.\r\n\r\n“Open the door!” cried Villefort. “Open; it is I.”\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding this request, notwithstanding the tone of anguish\r\nin which it was uttered, the door remained closed. Villefort burst it\r\nopen with a violent blow. At the entrance of the room which led to her\r\nboudoir, Madame de Villefort was standing erect, pale, her features\r\ncontracted, and her eyes glaring horribly.\r\n\r\n“Héloïse, Héloïse!” he said, “what is the matter? Speak!” The young\r\nwoman extended her stiff white hands towards him.\r\n\r\n“It is done, monsieur,” she said with a rattling noise which seemed to\r\ntear her throat. “What more do you want?” and she fell full length on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nVillefort ran to her and seized her hand, which convulsively clasped a\r\ncrystal bottle with a golden stopper. Madame de Villefort was dead.\r\nVillefort, maddened with horror, stepped back to the threshhold of the\r\ndoor, fixing his eyes on the corpse.\r\n\r\n“My son!” he exclaimed suddenly, “where is my son?—Edward, Edward!” and\r\nhe rushed out of the room, still crying, “Edward, Edward!” The name was\r\npronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran up.\r\n\r\n“Where is my son?” asked Villefort; “let him be removed from the house,\r\nthat he may not see——”\r\n\r\n“Master Edward is not downstairs, sir,” replied the valet.\r\n\r\n“Then he must be playing in the garden; go and see.”\r\n\r\n50193m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No, sir; Madame de Villefort sent for him half an hour ago; he went\r\ninto her room, and has not been downstairs since.”\r\n\r\nA cold perspiration burst out on Villefort’s brow; his legs trembled,\r\nand his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a\r\ndisordered watch.\r\n\r\n“In Madame de Villefort’s room?” he murmured and slowly returned, with\r\none hand wiping his forehead, and with the other supporting himself\r\nagainst the wall. To enter the room he must again see the body of his\r\nunfortunate wife. To call Edward he must reawaken the echo of that room\r\nwhich now appeared like a sepulchre; to speak seemed like violating the\r\nsilence of the tomb. His tongue was paralyzed in his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Edward!” he stammered—“Edward!”\r\n\r\nThe child did not answer. Where, then, could he be, if he had entered\r\nhis mother’s room and not since returned? He stepped forward. The\r\ncorpse of Madame de Villefort was stretched across the doorway leading\r\nto the room in which Edward must be; those glaring eyes seemed to watch\r\nover the threshold, and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and\r\nmysterious irony. Through the open door was visible a portion of the\r\nboudoir, containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch. Villefort\r\nstepped forward two or three paces, and beheld his child lying—no doubt\r\nasleep—on the sofa. The unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy; a\r\nray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness. He\r\nhad only to step over the corpse, enter the boudoir, take the child in\r\nhis arms, and flee far, far away.\r\n\r\nVillefort was no longer the civilized man; he was a tiger hurt unto\r\ndeath, gnashing his teeth in his wound. He no longer feared realities,\r\nbut phantoms. He leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning\r\nbrazier. He took the child in his arms, embraced him, shook him, called\r\nhim, but the child made no response. He pressed his burning lips to the\r\ncheeks, but they were icy cold and pale; he felt the stiffened limbs;\r\nhe pressed his hand upon the heart, but it no longer beat,—the child\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\nA folded paper fell from Edward’s breast. Villefort, thunderstruck,\r\nfell upon his knees; the child dropped from his arms, and rolled on the\r\nfloor by the side of its mother. He picked up the paper, and,\r\nrecognizing his wife’s writing, ran his eyes rapidly over its contents;\r\nit ran as follows:\r\n\r\n“You know that I was a good mother, since it was for my son’s sake I\r\nbecame criminal. A good mother cannot depart without her son.”\r\n\r\nVillefort could not believe his eyes,—he could not believe his reason;\r\nhe dragged himself towards the child’s body, and examined it as a\r\nlioness contemplates its dead cub. Then a piercing cry escaped from his\r\nbreast, and he cried,\r\n\r\n“Still the hand of God.”\r\n\r\nThe presence of the two victims alarmed him; he could not bear solitude\r\nshared only by two corpses. Until then he had been sustained by rage,\r\nby his strength of mind, by despair, by the supreme agony which led the\r\nTitans to scale the heavens, and Ajax to defy the gods. He now arose,\r\nhis head bowed beneath the weight of grief, and, shaking his damp,\r\ndishevelled hair, he who had never felt compassion for anyone\r\ndetermined to seek his father, that he might have someone to whom he\r\ncould relate his misfortunes,—someone by whose side he might weep.\r\n\r\n50195m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted, and\r\nentered Noirtier’s room. The old man appeared to be listening\r\nattentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the\r\nAbbé Busoni, who looked cold and calm, as usual. Villefort, perceiving\r\nthe abbé, passed his hand across his brow. The past came to him like\r\none of those waves whose wrath foams fiercer than the others.\r\n\r\nHe recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at\r\nAuteuil, and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on\r\nthe day of Valentine’s death.\r\n\r\n“You here, sir!” he exclaimed; “do you, then, never appear but to act\r\nas an escort to death?”\r\n\r\nBusoni turned around, and, perceiving the excitement depicted on the\r\nmagistrate’s face, the savage lustre of his eyes, he understood that\r\nthe revelation had been made at the assizes; but beyond this he was\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\n“I came to pray over the body of your daughter.”\r\n\r\n“And now why are you here?”\r\n\r\n“I come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt, and\r\nthat from this moment I will pray to God to forgive you, as I do.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!” exclaimed Villefort, stepping back fearfully, “surely\r\nthat is not the voice of the Abbé Busoni!”\r\n\r\n“No!” The abbé threw off his wig, shook his head, and his hair, no\r\nlonger confined, fell in black masses around his manly face.\r\n\r\n“It is the face of the Count of Monte Cristo!” exclaimed the procureur,\r\nwith a haggard expression.\r\n\r\n“You are not exactly right, M. Procureur; you must go farther back.”\r\n\r\n“That voice, that voice!—where did I first hear it?”\r\n\r\n“You heard it for the first time at Marseilles, twenty-three years ago,\r\nthe day of your marriage with Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran. Refer to\r\nyour papers.”\r\n\r\n“You are not Busoni?—you are not Monte Cristo? Oh, heavens! you are,\r\nthen, some secret, implacable, and mortal enemy! I must have wronged\r\nyou in some way at Marseilles. Oh, woe to me!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; you are now on the right path,” said the count, crossing his arms\r\nover his broad chest; “search—search!”\r\n\r\n“But what have I done to you?” exclaimed Villefort, whose mind was\r\nbalancing between reason and insanity, in that cloud which is neither a\r\ndream nor reality; “what have I done to you? Tell me, then! Speak!”\r\n\r\n“You condemned me to a horrible, tedious death; you killed my father;\r\nyou deprived me of liberty, of love, and happiness.”\r\n\r\n“Who are you, then? Who are you?”\r\n\r\n“I am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the Château\r\nd’If. God gave that spectre the form of the Count of Monte Cristo when\r\nhe at length issued from his tomb, enriched him with gold and diamonds,\r\nand led him to you!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I recognize you—I recognize you!” exclaimed the king’s attorney;\r\n“you are——”\r\n\r\n“I am Edmond Dantès!”\r\n\r\n“You are Edmond Dantès,” cried Villefort, seizing the count by the\r\nwrist; “then come here!”\r\n\r\nAnd up the stairs he dragged Monte Cristo; who, ignorant of what had\r\nhappened, followed him in astonishment, foreseeing some new\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\n“There, Edmond Dantès!” he said, pointing to the bodies of his wife and\r\nchild, “see, are you well avenged?”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo became pale at this horrible sight; he felt that he had\r\npassed beyond the bounds of vengeance, and that he could no longer say,\r\n“God is for and with me.” With an expression of indescribable anguish\r\nhe threw himself upon the body of the child, reopened its eyes, felt\r\nits pulse, and then rushed with him into Valentine’s room, of which he\r\ndouble-locked the door.\r\n\r\n“My child,” cried Villefort, “he carries away the body of my child! Oh,\r\ncurses, woe, death to you!”\r\n\r\nHe tried to follow Monte Cristo; but as though in a dream he was\r\ntransfixed to the spot,—his eyes glared as though they were starting\r\nthrough the sockets; he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails\r\nwere stained with blood; the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as\r\nthough they would burst their narrow boundary, and deluge his brain\r\nwith living fire. This lasted several minutes, until the frightful\r\noverturn of reason was accomplished; then uttering a loud cry followed\r\nby a burst of laughter, he rushed down the stairs.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour afterwards the door of Valentine’s room opened,\r\nand Monte Cristo reappeared. Pale, with a dull eye and heavy heart, all\r\nthe noble features of that face, usually so calm and serene, were\r\novercast by grief. In his arms he held the child, whom no skill had\r\nbeen able to recall to life. Bending on one knee, he placed it\r\nreverently by the side of its mother, with its head upon her breast.\r\nThen, rising, he went out, and meeting a servant on the stairs, he\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n“Where is M. de Villefort?”\r\n\r\nThe servant, instead of answering, pointed to the garden. Monte Cristo\r\nran down the steps, and advancing towards the spot designated beheld\r\nVillefort, encircled by his servants, with a spade in his hand, and\r\ndigging the earth with fury.\r\n\r\n“It is not here!” he cried. “It is not here!”\r\n\r\n50197m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then he moved farther on, and began again to dig.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo approached him, and said in a low voice, with an\r\nexpression almost humble:\r\n\r\n“Sir, you have indeed lost a son; but——”\r\n\r\nVillefort interrupted him; he had neither listened nor heard.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I _will_ find it,” he cried; “you may pretend he is not here, but\r\nI _will_ find him, though I dig forever!”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo drew back in horror.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” he said, “he is mad!” And as though he feared that the walls of\r\nthe accursed house would crumble around him, he rushed into the street,\r\nfor the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had\r\ndone. “Oh, enough of this,—enough of this,” he cried; “let me save the\r\nlast.” On entering his house, he met Morrel, who wandered about like a\r\nghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb.\r\n\r\n“Prepare yourself, Maximilian,” he said with a smile; “we leave Paris\r\ntomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Have you nothing more to do there?” asked Morrel.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Monte Cristo; “God grant I may not have done too much\r\nalready.”\r\n\r\nThe next day they indeed left, accompanied only by Baptistin. Haydée\r\nhad taken away Ali, and Bertuccio remained with Noirtier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 112. The Departure\r\n\r\nThe recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all\r\nParis. Emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in\r\ntheir little apartment in the Rue Meslay upon the three successive,\r\nsudden, and most unexpected catastrophes of Morcerf, Danglars, and\r\nVillefort. Maximilian, who was paying them a visit, listened to their\r\nconversation, or rather was present at it, plunged in his accustomed\r\nstate of apathy.\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said Julie, “might we not almost fancy, Emmanuel, that those\r\npeople, so rich, so happy but yesterday, had forgotten in their\r\nprosperity that an evil genius—like the wicked fairies in Perrault’s\r\nstories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptism—hovered\r\nover them, and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal\r\nneglect?”\r\n\r\n“What a dire misfortune!” said Emmanuel, thinking of Morcerf and\r\nDanglars.\r\n\r\n“What dreadful sufferings!” said Julie, remembering Valentine, but\r\nwhom, with a delicacy natural to women, she did not name before her\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n“If the Supreme Being has directed the fatal blow,” said Emmanuel, “it\r\nmust be that he in his great goodness has perceived nothing in the past\r\nlives of these people to merit mitigation of their awful punishment.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not form a very rash judgment, Emmanuel?” said Julie. “When my\r\nfather, with a pistol in his hand, was once on the point of committing\r\nsuicide, had anyone then said, ‘This man deserves his misery,’ would\r\nnot that person have been deceived?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but your father was not allowed to fall. A being was commissioned\r\nto arrest the fatal hand of death about to descend on him.”\r\n\r\nEmmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell\r\nwas heard, the well-known signal given by the porter that a visitor had\r\narrived. Nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the Count\r\nof Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold. The young people uttered a\r\ncry of joy, while Maximilian raised his head, but let it fall again\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n50201m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Maximilian,” said the count, without appearing to notice the different\r\nimpressions which his presence produced on the little circle, “I come\r\nto seek you.”\r\n\r\n“To seek me?” repeated Morrel, as if awakening from a dream.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Monte Cristo; “has it not been agreed that I should take\r\nyou with me, and did I not tell you yesterday to prepare for\r\ndeparture?”\r\n\r\n“I am ready,” said Maximilian; “I came expressly to wish them\r\nfarewell.”\r\n\r\n“Whither are you going, count?” asked Julie.\r\n\r\n“In the first instance to Marseilles, madame.”\r\n\r\n“To Marseilles!” exclaimed the young couple.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and I take your brother with me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, count.” said Julie, “will you restore him to us cured of his\r\nmelancholy?” Morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n“You perceive, then, that he is not happy?” said the count.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the young woman; “and fear much that he finds our home\r\nbut a dull one.”\r\n\r\n“I will undertake to divert him,” replied the count.\r\n\r\n“I am ready to accompany you, sir,” said Maximilian. “Adieu, my kind\r\nfriends! Emmanuel—Julie—farewell!”\r\n\r\n“How farewell?” exclaimed Julie; “do you leave us thus, so suddenly,\r\nwithout any preparations for your journey, without even a passport?”\r\n\r\n“Needless delays but increase the grief of parting,” said Monte Cristo,\r\n“and Maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything\r\nrequisite; at least, I advised him to do so.”\r\n\r\n“I have a passport, and my clothes are ready packed,” said Morrel in\r\nhis tranquil but mournful manner.\r\n\r\n“Good,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “in these prompt arrangements we\r\nrecognize the order of a well-disciplined soldier.”\r\n\r\n“And you leave us,” said Julie, “at a moment’s warning? you do not give\r\nus a day—no, not even an hour before your departure?”\r\n\r\n“My carriage is at the door, madame, and I must be in Rome in five\r\ndays.”\r\n\r\n“But does Maximilian go to Rome?” exclaimed Emmanuel.\r\n\r\n“I am going wherever it may please the count to take me,” said Morrel,\r\nwith a smile full of grief; “I am under his orders for the next month.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, heavens, how strangely he expresses himself, count!” said Julie.\r\n\r\n“Maximilian goes with _me_,” said the count, in his kindest and most\r\npersuasive manner; “therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your\r\nbrother’s account.”\r\n\r\n“Once more farewell, my dear sister; Emmanuel, adieu!” Morrel repeated.\r\n\r\n“His carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart,” said Julie.\r\n“Oh, Maximilian, Maximilian, you are certainly concealing something\r\nfrom us.”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw!” said Monte Cristo, “you will see him return to you gay,\r\nsmiling, and joyful.”\r\n\r\nMaximilian cast a look of disdain, almost of anger, on the count.\r\n\r\n“We must leave you,” said Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n50203m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Before you quit us, count,” said Julie, “will you permit us to express\r\nto you all that the other day——”\r\n\r\n“Madame,” interrupted the count, taking her two hands in his, “all that\r\nyou could say in words would never express what I read in your eyes;\r\nthe thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine. Like\r\nbenefactors in romances, I should have left you without seeing you\r\nagain, but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength, because I\r\nam a weak and vain man, fond of the tender, kind, and thankful glances\r\nof my fellow-creatures. On the eve of departure I carry my egotism so\r\nfar as to say, ‘Do not forget me, my kind friends, for probably you\r\nwill never see me again.’”\r\n\r\n“Never see you again?” exclaimed Emmanuel, while two large tears rolled\r\ndown Julie’s cheeks, “never behold you again? It is not a man, then,\r\nbut some angel that leaves us, and this angel is on the point of\r\nreturning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good.”\r\n\r\n“Say not so,” quickly returned Monte Cristo—“say not so, my friends;\r\nangels never err, celestial beings remain where they wish to be. Fate\r\nis not more powerful than they; it is they who, on the contrary,\r\novercome fate. No, Emmanuel, I am but a man, and your admiration is as\r\nunmerited as your words are sacrilegious.”\r\n\r\nAnd pressing his lips on the hand of Julie, who rushed into his arms,\r\nhe extended his other hand to Emmanuel; then tearing himself from this\r\nabode of peace and happiness, he made a sign to Maximilian, who\r\nfollowed him passively, with the indifference which had been\r\nperceptible in him ever since the death of Valentine had so stunned\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Restore my brother to peace and happiness,” whispered Julie to Monte\r\nCristo. And the count pressed her hand in reply, as he had done eleven\r\nyears before on the staircase leading to Morrel’s study.\r\n\r\n“You still confide, then, in Sinbad the Sailor?” asked he, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” was the ready answer.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, sleep in peace, and put your trust in the Lord.”\r\n\r\nAs we have before said, the post-chaise was waiting; four powerful\r\nhorses were already pawing the ground with impatience, while Ali,\r\napparently just arrived from a long walk, was standing at the foot of\r\nthe steps, his face bathed in perspiration.\r\n\r\n“Well,” asked the count in Arabic, “have you been to see the old man?”\r\nAli made a sign in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n“And have you placed the letter before him, as I ordered you to do?”\r\n\r\nThe slave respectfully signalized that he had.\r\n\r\n“And what did he say, or rather do?” Ali placed himself in the light,\r\nso that his master might see him distinctly, and then imitating in his\r\nintelligent manner the countenance of the old man, he closed his eyes,\r\nas Noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Good; he accepts,” said Monte Cristo. “Now let us go.”\r\n\r\n50205m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese words had scarcely escaped him, when the carriage was on its way,\r\nand the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement.\r\nMaximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word. Half\r\nan hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly; the count had\r\njust pulled the silken check-string, which was fastened to Ali’s\r\nfinger. The Nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage door.\r\nIt was a lovely starlight night—they had just reached the top of the\r\nhill Villejuif, from whence Paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its\r\nmillions of phosphoric waves into light—waves indeed more noisy, more\r\npassionate, more changeable, more furious, more greedy, than those of\r\nthe tempestuous ocean,—waves which never rest as those of the sea\r\nsometimes do,—waves ever dashing, ever foaming, ever ingulfing what\r\nfalls within their grasp.\r\n\r\nThe count stood alone, and at a sign from his hand, the carriage went\r\non for a short distance. With folded arms, he gazed for some time upon\r\nthe great city. When he had fixed his piercing look on this modern\r\nBabylon, which equally engages the contemplation of the religious\r\nenthusiast, the materialist, and the scoffer,—\r\n\r\n“Great city,” murmured he, inclining his head, and joining his hands as\r\nif in prayer, “less than six months have elapsed since first I entered\r\nthy gates. I believe that the Spirit of God led my steps to thee and\r\nthat he also enables me to quit thee in triumph; the secret cause of my\r\npresence within thy walls I have confided alone to him who only has had\r\nthe power to read my heart. God only knows that I retire from thee\r\nwithout pride or hatred, but not without many regrets; he only knows\r\nthat the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my\r\npersonal good or to any useless cause. Oh, great city, it is in thy\r\npalpitating bosom that I have found that which I sought; like a patient\r\nminer, I have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence.\r\nNow my work is accomplished, my mission is terminated, now thou canst\r\nneither afford me pain nor pleasure. Adieu, Paris, adieu!”\r\n\r\nHis look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the\r\nnight; he passed his hand over his brow, got into the carriage, the\r\ndoor was closed on him, and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the\r\nother side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise.\r\n\r\nTen leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered. Morrel was\r\ndreaming, and Monte Cristo was looking at the dreamer.\r\n\r\n“Morrel,” said the count to him at length, “do you repent having\r\nfollowed me?”\r\n\r\n“No, count; but to leave Paris——”\r\n\r\n“If I thought happiness might await you in Paris, Morrel, I would have\r\nleft you there.”\r\n\r\n“Valentine reposes within the walls of Paris, and to leave Paris is\r\nlike losing her a second time.”\r\n\r\n“Maximilian,” said the count, “the friends that we have lost do not\r\nrepose in the bosom of the earth, but are buried deep in our hearts,\r\nand it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by\r\nthem. I have two friends, who in this way never depart from me; the one\r\nwho gave me being, and the other who conferred knowledge and\r\nintelligence on me. Their spirits live in me. I consult them when\r\ndoubtful, and if I ever do any good, it is due to their beneficent\r\ncounsels. Listen to the voice of your heart, Morrel, and ask it whether\r\nyou ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Maximilian, “the voice of my heart is very sorrowful,\r\nand promises me nothing but misfortune.”\r\n\r\n“It is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black\r\ncloud. The soul forms its own horizons; your soul is darkened, and\r\nconsequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising.”\r\n\r\n“That may possibly be true,” said Maximilian, and he again subsided\r\ninto his thoughtful mood.\r\n\r\nThe journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the\r\nunlimited power of the count ever commanded. Towns fled from them like\r\nshadows on their path, and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn\r\nseemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them, and retreating as\r\nrapidly when once reached. The following morning they arrived at\r\nChâlons, where the count’s steamboat waited for them. Without the loss\r\nof an instant, the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers\r\nembarked without delay. The boat was built for speed; her two\r\npaddle-wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like\r\na bird.\r\n\r\nMorrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is\r\ngenerally experienced in passing rapidly through the air, and the wind\r\nwhich occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the\r\npoint of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there.\r\n\r\nAs the distance increased between the travellers and Paris, almost\r\nsuperhuman serenity appeared to surround the count; he might have been\r\ntaken for an exile about to revisit his native land.\r\n\r\nEre long Marseilles presented herself to view,—Marseilles, white,\r\nfervid, full of life and energy,—Marseilles, the younger sister of Tyre\r\nand Carthage, the successor to them in the empire of the\r\nMediterranean,—Marseilles, old, yet always young. Powerful memories\r\nwere stirred within them by the sight of the round tower, Fort\r\nSaint-Nicolas, the City Hall designed by Puget,28 the port with its\r\nbrick quays, where they had both played in childhood, and it was with\r\none accord that they stopped on the Canebière.\r\n\r\nA vessel was setting sail for Algiers, on board of which the bustle\r\nusually attending departure prevailed. The passengers and their\r\nrelations crowded on the deck, friends taking a tender but sorrowful\r\nleave of each other, some weeping, others noisy in their grief, the\r\nwhole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who\r\nwitnessed similar sights daily, but which had no power to disturb the\r\ncurrent of thought that had taken possession of the mind of Maximilian\r\nfrom the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said he, leaning heavily on the arm of Monte Cristo,—“here is\r\nthe spot where my father stopped, when the _Pharaon_ entered the port;\r\nit was here that the good old man, whom you saved from death and\r\ndishonor, threw himself into my arms. I yet feel his warm tears on my\r\nface, and his were not the only tears shed, for many who witnessed our\r\nmeeting wept also.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo gently smiled and said,—“I was there;” at the same time\r\npointing to the corner of a street. As he spoke, and in the very\r\ndirection he indicated, a groan, expressive of bitter grief, was heard,\r\nand a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel\r\nabout to sail. Monte Cristo looked at her with an emotion that must\r\nhave been remarked by Morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel.\r\n\r\n“Oh, heavens!” exclaimed Morrel, “I do not deceive myself—that young\r\nman who is waving his hat, that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant,\r\nis Albert de Morcerf!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Monte Cristo, “I recognized him.”\r\n\r\n“How so?—you were looking the other way.”\r\n\r\n50209m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe count smiled, as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want\r\nto make any reply, and he again turned towards the veiled woman, who\r\nsoon disappeared at the corner of the street. Turning to his friend:\r\n\r\n“Dear Maximilian,” said the count, “have you nothing to do in this\r\nland?”\r\n\r\n“I have to weep over the grave of my father,” replied Morrel in a\r\nbroken voice.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, go,—wait for me there, and I will soon join you.”\r\n\r\n“You leave me, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I also have a pious visit to pay.”\r\n\r\nMorrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to\r\nhim; then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he\r\nquitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city. Monte\r\nCristo remained on the same spot until Maximilian was out of sight; he\r\nthen walked slowly towards the Allées de Meilhan to seek out a small\r\nhouse with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of\r\nthis story.\r\n\r\nIt yet stood, under the shade of the fine avenue of lime-trees, which\r\nforms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of Marseilles,\r\ncovered by an immense vine, which spreads its aged and blackened\r\nbranches over the stone front, burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the\r\nsouth. Two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to\r\nthe door, which was made of three planks; the door had never been\r\npainted or varnished, so great cracks yawned in it during the dry\r\nseason to close again when the rains came on. The house, with all its\r\ncrumbling antiquity and apparent misery, was yet cheerful and\r\npicturesque, and was the same that old Dantès formerly inhabited—the\r\nonly difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret,\r\nwhile the whole house was now placed at the command of Mercédès by the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\nThe woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret\r\nentered this house; she had scarcely closed the door after her when\r\nMonte Cristo appeared at the corner of a street, so that he found and\r\nlost her again almost at the same instant. The worn out steps were old\r\nacquaintances of his; he knew better than anyone else how to open that\r\nweather-beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise\r\nthe latch within. He entered without knocking, or giving any other\r\nintimation of his presence, as if he had been a friend or the master of\r\nthe place. At the end of a passage paved with bricks, was a little\r\ngarden, bathed in sunshine, and rich in warmth and light. In this\r\ngarden Mercédès had found, at the place indicated by the count, the sum\r\nof money which he, through a sense of delicacy, had described as having\r\nbeen placed there twenty-four years previously. The trees of the garden\r\nwere easily seen from the steps of the street-door.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo, on stepping into the house, heard a sigh that was almost\r\na deep sob; he looked in the direction whence it came, and there under\r\nan arbor of Virginia jessamine,29 with its thick foliage and beautiful\r\nlong purple flowers, he saw Mercédès seated, with her head bowed, and\r\nweeping bitterly. She had raised her veil, and with her face hidden by\r\nher hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been\r\nso long restrained by the presence of her son.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo advanced a few steps, which were heard on the gravel.\r\nMercédès raised her head, and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a\r\nman before her.\r\n\r\n50211m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said the count, “it is no longer in my power to restore you\r\nto happiness, but I offer you consolation; will you deign to accept it\r\nas coming from a friend?”\r\n\r\n“I am, indeed, most wretched,” replied Mercédès. “Alone in the world, I\r\nhad but my son, and he has left me!”\r\n\r\n“He possesses a noble heart, madame,” replied the count, “and he has\r\nacted rightly. He feels that every man owes a tribute to his country;\r\nsome contribute their talents, others their industry; these devote\r\ntheir blood, those their nightly labors, to the same cause. Had he\r\nremained with you, his life must have become a hateful burden, nor\r\nwould he have participated in your griefs. He will increase in strength\r\nand honor by struggling with adversity, which he will convert into\r\nprosperity. Leave him to build up the future for you, and I venture to\r\nsay you will confide it to safe hands.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” replied the wretched woman, mournfully shaking her head, “the\r\nprosperity of which you speak, and which, from the bottom of my heart,\r\nI pray God in his mercy to grant him, I can never enjoy. The bitter cup\r\nof adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs, and I feel that\r\nthe grave is not far distant. You have acted kindly, count, in bringing\r\nme back to the place where I have enjoyed so much bliss. I ought to\r\nmeet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own.”\r\n\r\n“Alas,” said Monte Cristo, “your words sear and embitter my heart, the\r\nmore so as you have every reason to hate me. I have been the cause of\r\nall your misfortunes; but why do you pity, instead of blaming me? You\r\nrender me still more unhappy——”\r\n\r\n“Hate you, blame you—_you_, Edmond! Hate, reproach, the man that has\r\nspared my son’s life! For was it not your fatal and sanguinary\r\nintention to destroy that son of whom M. de Morcerf was so proud? Oh,\r\nlook at me closely, and discover, if you can, even the semblance of a\r\nreproach in me.”\r\n\r\nThe count looked up and fixed his eyes on Mercédès, who arose partly\r\nfrom her seat and extended both her hands towards him.\r\n\r\n“Oh, look at me,” continued she, with a feeling of profound melancholy,\r\n“my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy, for the time has long\r\nfled since I used to smile on Edmond Dantès, who anxiously looked out\r\nfor me from the window of yonder garret, then inhabited by his old\r\nfather. Years of grief have created an abyss between those days and the\r\npresent. I neither reproach you nor hate you, my friend. Oh, no,\r\nEdmond, it is myself that I blame, myself that I hate! Oh, miserable\r\ncreature that I am!” cried she, clasping her hands, and raising her\r\neyes to heaven. “I once possessed piety, innocence, and love, the three\r\ningredients of the happiness of angels, and now what am I?”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo approached her, and silently took her hand.\r\n\r\n“No,” said she, withdrawing it gently—“no, my friend, touch me not. You\r\nhave spared me, yet of all those who have fallen under your vengeance I\r\nwas the most guilty. They were influenced by hatred, by avarice, and by\r\nself-love; but I was base, and for want of courage acted against my\r\njudgment. Nay, do not press my hand, Edmond; you are thinking, I am\r\nsure, of some kind speech to console me, but do not utter it to me,\r\nreserve it for others more worthy of your kindness. See” (and she\r\nexposed her face completely to view)—“see, misfortune has silvered my\r\nhair, my eyes have shed so many tears that they are encircled by a rim\r\nof purple, and my brow is wrinkled. You, Edmond, on the contrary,—you\r\nare still young, handsome, dignified; it is because you have had faith;\r\nbecause you have had strength, because you have had trust in God, and\r\nGod has sustained you. But as for me, I have been a coward; I have\r\ndenied God and he has abandoned me.”\r\n\r\n50213m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMercédès burst into tears; her woman’s heart was breaking under its\r\nload of memories. Monte Cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on\r\nit; but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than\r\nhe would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a saint.\r\n\r\n“It often happens,” continued she, “that a first fault destroys the\r\nprospects of a whole life. I believed you dead; why did I survive you?\r\nWhat good has it done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret\r\nrecesses of my heart?—only to make a woman of thirty-nine look like a\r\nwoman of fifty. Why, having recognized you, and I the only one to do\r\nso—why was I able to save my son alone? Ought I not also to have\r\nrescued the man that I had accepted for a husband, guilty though he\r\nwere? Yet I let him die! What do I say? Oh, merciful heavens, was I not\r\naccessory to his death by my supine insensibility, by my contempt for\r\nhim, not remembering, or not willing to remember, that it was for my\r\nsake he had become a traitor and a perjurer? In what am I benefited by\r\naccompanying my son so far, since I now abandon him, and allow him to\r\ndepart alone to the baneful climate of Africa? Oh, I have been base,\r\ncowardly, I tell you; I have abjured my affections, and like all\r\nrenegades I am of evil omen to those who surround me!”\r\n\r\n“No, Mercédès,” said Monte Cristo, “no; you judge yourself with too\r\nmuch severity. You are a noble-minded woman, and it was your grief that\r\ndisarmed me. Still I was but an agent, led on by an invisible and\r\noffended Deity, who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that I was\r\ndestined to hurl. I take that God to witness, at whose feet I have\r\nprostrated myself daily for the last ten years, that I would have\r\nsacrificed my life to you, and with my life the projects that were\r\nindissolubly linked with it. But—and I say it with some pride,\r\nMercédès—God needed me, and I lived. Examine the past and the present,\r\nand endeavor to dive into futurity, and then say whether I am not a\r\ndivine instrument. The most dreadful misfortunes, the most frightful\r\nsufferings, the abandonment of all those who loved me, the persecution\r\nof those who did not know me, formed the trials of my youth; when\r\nsuddenly, from captivity, solitude, misery, I was restored to light and\r\nliberty, and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant, so\r\nunbounded, so unheard-of, that I must have been blind not to be\r\nconscious that God had endowed me with it to work out his own great\r\ndesigns. From that time I looked upon this fortune as something\r\nconfided to me for a particular purpose. Not a thought was given to a\r\nlife which you once, Mercédès, had the power to render blissful; not\r\none hour of peaceful calm was mine; but I felt myself driven on like an\r\nexterminating angel. Like adventurous captains about to embark on some\r\nenterprise full of danger, I laid in my provisions, I loaded my\r\nweapons, I collected every means of attack and defence; I inured my\r\nbody to the most violent exercises, my soul to the bitterest trials; I\r\ntaught my arm to slay, my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings, and\r\nmy mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles. Good-natured,\r\nconfiding, and forgiving as I had been, I became revengeful, cunning,\r\nand wicked, or rather, immovable as fate. Then I launched out into the\r\npath that was opened to me. I overcame every obstacle, and reached the\r\ngoal; but woe to those who stood in my pathway!”\r\n\r\n50215m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Enough,” said Mercédès; “enough, Edmond! Believe me, that she who\r\nalone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you; and had\r\nshe crossed your path, and you had crushed her like glass, still,\r\nEdmond, still she must have admired you! Like the gulf between me and\r\nthe past, there is an abyss between you, Edmond, and the rest of\r\nmankind; and I tell you freely that the comparison I draw between you\r\nand other men will ever be one of my greatest tortures. No, there is\r\nnothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness! But we must\r\nsay farewell, Edmond, and let us part.”\r\n\r\n“Before I leave you, Mercédès, have you no request to make?” said the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n“I desire but one thing in this world, Edmond,—the happiness of my\r\nson.”\r\n\r\n“Pray to the Almighty to spare his life, and I will take upon myself to\r\npromote his happiness.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Edmond.”\r\n\r\n“But have you no request to make for yourself, Mercédès?”\r\n\r\n“For myself I want nothing. I live, as it were, between two graves. One\r\nis that of Edmond Dantès, lost to me long, long since. He had my love!\r\nThat word ill becomes my faded lip now, but it is a memory dear to my\r\nheart, and one that I would not lose for all that the world contains.\r\nThe other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of\r\nEdmond Dantès. I approve of the deed, but I must pray for the dead.”\r\n\r\n“Your son shall be happy, Mercédès,” repeated the count.\r\n\r\n“Then I shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly\r\nconfer.”\r\n\r\n“But what are your intentions?”\r\n\r\nMercédès smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n“To say that I shall live here, like the Mercédès of other times,\r\ngaining my bread by labor, would not be true, nor would you believe me.\r\nI have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in\r\nprayer. However, I shall have no occasion to work, for the little sum\r\nof money buried by you, and which I found in the place you mentioned,\r\nwill be sufficient to maintain me. Rumor will probably be busy\r\nrespecting me, my occupations, my manner of living—that will signify\r\nbut little, that concerns God, you, and myself.”\r\n\r\n“Mercédès,” said the count, “I do not say it to blame you, but you made\r\nan unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune\r\namassed by M. de Morcerf; half of it at least by right belonged to you,\r\nin virtue of your vigilance and economy.”\r\n\r\n“I perceive what you are intending to propose to me; but I cannot\r\naccept it, Edmond—my son would not permit it.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing shall be done without the full approbation of Albert de\r\nMorcerf. I will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will\r\nsubmit to them. But if he be willing to accept my offers, will you\r\noppose them?”\r\n\r\n“You well know, Edmond, that I am no longer a reasoning creature; I\r\nhave no will, unless it be the will never to decide. I have been so\r\noverwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head, that I am\r\nbecome passive in the hands of the Almighty, like a sparrow in the\r\ntalons of an eagle. I live, because it is not ordained for me to die.\r\nIf succor be sent to me, I will accept it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, madame,” said Monte Cristo, “you should not talk thus! It is not\r\nso we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven; on the\r\ncontrary, we are all free agents.”\r\n\r\n“Alas!” exclaimed Mercédès, “if it were so, if I possessed free-will,\r\nbut without the power to render that will efficacious, it would drive\r\nme to despair.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\n“Will you not even say you will see me again?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, we shall meet again,” said Mercédès, pointing to\r\nheaven with solemnity. “I tell you so to prove to you that I still\r\nhope.”\r\n\r\nAnd after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count,\r\nMercédès rushed up the stairs and disappeared. Monte Cristo slowly left\r\nthe house and turned towards the quay. But Mercédès did not witness his\r\ndeparture, although she was seated at the little window of the room\r\nwhich had been occupied by old Dantès. Her eyes were straining to see\r\nthe ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea; but still her\r\nvoice involuntarily murmured softly:\r\n\r\n“Edmond, Edmond, Edmond!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 113. The Past\r\n\r\nThe count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left\r\nMercédès, probably never to behold her again. Since the death of little\r\nEdward a great change had taken place in Monte Cristo. Having reached\r\nthe summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path, he saw an\r\nabyss of doubt yawning before him. More than this, the conversation\r\nwhich had just taken place between Mercédès and himself had awakened so\r\nmany recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat\r\nwith them. A man of the count’s temperament could not long indulge in\r\nthat melancholy which can exist in common minds, but which destroys\r\nsuperior ones. He thought he must have made an error in his\r\ncalculations if he now found cause to blame himself.\r\n\r\n“I cannot have deceived myself,” he said; “I must look upon the past in\r\na false light. What!” he continued, “can I have been following a false\r\npath?—can the end which I proposed be a mistaken end?—can one hour have\r\nsufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded\r\nall his hopes was an impossible, if not a sacrilegious, undertaking? I\r\ncannot reconcile myself to this idea—it would madden me. The reason why\r\nI am now dissatisfied is that I have not a clear appreciation of the\r\npast. The past, like the country through which we walk, becomes\r\nindistinct as we advance. My position is like that of a person wounded\r\nin a dream; he feels the wound, though he cannot recollect when he\r\nreceived it.\r\n\r\n“Come, then, thou regenerate man, thou extravagant prodigal, thou\r\nawakened sleeper, thou all-powerful visionary, thou invincible\r\nmillionaire,—once again review thy past life of starvation and\r\nwretchedness, revisit the scenes where fate and misfortune conducted,\r\nand where despair received thee. Too many diamonds, too much gold and\r\nsplendor, are now reflected by the mirror in which Monte Cristo seeks\r\nto behold Dantès. Hide thy diamonds, bury thy gold, shroud thy\r\nsplendor, exchange riches for poverty, liberty for a prison, a living\r\nbody for a corpse!”\r\n\r\nAs he thus reasoned, Monte Cristo walked down the Rue de la Caisserie.\r\nIt was the same through which, twenty-four years ago, he had been\r\nconducted by a silent and nocturnal guard; the houses, today so smiling\r\nand animated, were on that night dark, mute, and closed.\r\n\r\n“And yet they were the same,” murmured Monte Cristo, “only now it is\r\nbroad daylight instead of night; it is the sun which brightens the\r\nplace, and makes it appear so cheerful.”\r\n\r\nHe proceeded towards the quay by the Rue Saint-Laurent, and advanced to\r\nthe Consigne; it was the point where he had embarked. A pleasure-boat\r\nwith striped awning was going by. Monte Cristo called the owner, who\r\nimmediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for\r\na good fare.\r\n\r\nThe weather was magnificent, and the excursion a treat. The sun, red\r\nand flaming, was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming ocean. The\r\nsea, smooth as crystal, was now and then disturbed by the leaping of\r\nfish, which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for safety in\r\nanother element; while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be\r\nseen the fishermen’s boats, white and graceful as the sea-gull, or the\r\nmerchant vessels bound for Corsica or Spain.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the serene sky, the gracefully formed boats, and\r\nthe golden light in which the whole scene was bathed, the Count of\r\nMonte Cristo, wrapped in his cloak, could think only of this terrible\r\nvoyage, the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory.\r\nThe solitary light burning at the Catalans; that first sight of the\r\nChâteau d’If, which told him whither they were leading him; the\r\nstruggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard;\r\nhis despair when he found himself vanquished, and the sensation when\r\nthe muzzle of the carbine touched his forehead—all these were brought\r\nbefore him in vivid and frightful reality.\r\n\r\nLike the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up, and which\r\nafter the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop, so did\r\nthe count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which\r\nformerly nearly overwhelmed Edmond Dantès. Clear sky, swift-flitting\r\nboats, and brilliant sunshine disappeared; the heavens were hung with\r\nblack, and the gigantic structure of the Château d’If seemed like the\r\nphantom of a mortal enemy. As they reached the shore, the count\r\ninstinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat, and the owner was\r\nobliged to call out, in his sweetest tone of voice:\r\n\r\n“Sir, we are at the landing.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo remembered that on that very spot, on the same rock, he\r\nhad been violently dragged by the guards, who forced him to ascend the\r\nslope at the points of their bayonets. The journey had seemed very long\r\nto Dantès, but Monte Cristo found it equally short. Each stroke of the\r\noar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas, which sprang up with the\r\nflying spray of the sea.\r\n\r\n50219m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been no prisoners confined in the Château d’If since the\r\nrevolution of July; it was only inhabited by a guard, kept there for\r\nthe prevention of smuggling. A concierge waited at the door to exhibit\r\nto visitors this monument of curiosity, once a scene of terror.\r\n\r\nThe count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there;\r\nbut they had all been pensioned, or had passed on to some other\r\nemployment. The concierge who attended him had only been there since\r\n1830. He visited his own dungeon. He again beheld the dull light vainly\r\nendeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening. His eyes rested upon the\r\nspot where had stood his bed, since then removed, and behind the bed\r\nthe new stones indicated where the breach made by the Abbé Faria had\r\nbeen. Monte Cristo felt his limbs tremble; he seated himself upon a log\r\nof wood.\r\n\r\n“Are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one\r\nrelating to the poisoning of Mirabeau?” asked the count; “are there any\r\ntraditions respecting these dismal abodes,—in which it is difficult to\r\nbelieve men can ever have imprisoned their fellow-creatures?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; indeed, the jailer Antoine told me one connected with this\r\nvery dungeon.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo shuddered; Antoine had been his jailer. He had almost\r\nforgotten his name and face, but at the mention of the name he recalled\r\nhis person as he used to see it, the face encircled by a beard, wearing\r\nthe brown jacket, the bunch of keys, the jingling of which he still\r\nseemed to hear. The count turned around, and fancied he saw him in the\r\ncorridor, rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge.\r\n\r\n“Would you like to hear the story, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; relate it,” said Monte Cristo, pressing his hand to his heart to\r\nstill its violent beatings; he felt afraid of hearing his own history.\r\n\r\n“This dungeon,” said the concierge, “was, it appears, some time ago\r\noccupied by a very dangerous prisoner, the more so since he was full of\r\nindustry. Another person was confined in the Château at the same time,\r\nbut he was not wicked, he was only a poor mad priest.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed?—mad!” repeated Monte Cristo; “and what was his mania?”\r\n\r\n“He offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo raised his eyes, but he could not see the heavens; there\r\nwas a stone veil between him and the firmament. He thought that there\r\nhad been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom Faria\r\noffered the treasures.\r\n\r\n“Could the prisoners see each other?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, sir, it was expressly forbidden; but they eluded the vigilance\r\nof the guards, and made a passage from one dungeon to the other.”\r\n\r\n“And which of them made this passage?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it must have been the young man, certainly, for he was strong and\r\nindustrious, while the abbé was aged and weak; besides, his mind was\r\ntoo vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea.”\r\n\r\n“Blind fools!” murmured the count.\r\n\r\n“However, be that as it may, the young man made a tunnel, how or by\r\nwhat means no one knows; but he made it, and there is the evidence yet\r\nremaining of his work. Do you see it?” and the man held the torch to\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\n50223m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes; I see,” said the count, in a voice hoarse from emotion.\r\n\r\n“The result was that the two men communicated with one another; how\r\nlong they did so, nobody knows. One day the old man fell ill and died.\r\nNow guess what the young one did?”\r\n\r\n“Tell me.”\r\n\r\n“He carried off the corpse, which he placed in his own bed with its\r\nface to the wall; then he entered the empty dungeon, closed the\r\nentrance, and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body.\r\nDid you ever hear of such an idea?”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo closed his eyes, and seemed again to experience all the\r\nsensations he had felt when the coarse canvas, yet moist with the cold\r\ndews of death, had touched his face.\r\n\r\nThe jailer continued:\r\n\r\n“Now this was his project. He fancied that they buried the dead at the\r\nChâteau d’If, and imagining they would not expend much labor on the\r\ngrave of a prisoner, he calculated on raising the earth with his\r\nshoulders, but unfortunately their arrangements at the Château\r\nfrustrated his projects. They never buried the dead; they merely\r\nattached a heavy cannon-ball to the feet, and then threw them into the\r\nsea. This is what was done. The young man was thrown from the top of\r\nthe rock; the corpse was found on the bed next day, and the whole truth\r\nwas guessed, for the men who performed the office then mentioned what\r\nthey had not dared to speak of before, that at the moment the corpse\r\nwas thrown into the deep, they heard a shriek, which was almost\r\nimmediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared.”\r\n\r\nThe count breathed with difficulty; the cold drops ran down his\r\nforehead, and his heart was full of anguish.\r\n\r\n“No,” he muttered, “the doubt I felt was but the commencement of\r\nforgetfulness; but here the wound reopens, and the heart again thirsts\r\nfor vengeance. And the prisoner,” he continued aloud, “was he ever\r\nheard of afterwards?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; of course not. You can understand that one of two things must\r\nhave happened; he must either have fallen flat, in which case the blow,\r\nfrom a height of ninety feet, must have killed him instantly, or he\r\nmust have fallen upright, and then the weight would have dragged him to\r\nthe bottom, where he remained—poor fellow!”\r\n\r\n“Then you pity him?” said the count.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi_, yes; though he was in his own element.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“The report was that he had been a naval officer, who had been confined\r\nfor plotting with the Bonapartists.”\r\n\r\n“Great is truth,” muttered the count, “fire cannot burn, nor water\r\ndrown it! Thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who\r\nnarrate his history; his terrible story is recited in the\r\nchimney-corner, and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit\r\nthrough the air to be swallowed by the deep.” Then, the count added\r\naloud, “Was his name ever known?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; but only as No. 34.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Villefort, Villefort,” murmured the count, “this scene must often\r\nhave haunted thy sleepless hours!”\r\n\r\n“Do you wish to see anything more, sir?” said the concierge.\r\n\r\n“Yes, especially if you will show me the poor abbé’s room.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! No. 27.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; No. 27.” repeated the count, who seemed to hear the voice of the\r\nabbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his\r\nname.\r\n\r\n“Come, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Wait,” said Monte Cristo, “I wish to take one final glance around this\r\nroom.”\r\n\r\n“This is fortunate,” said the guide; “I have forgotten the other key.”\r\n\r\n“Go and fetch it.”\r\n\r\n“I will leave you the torch, sir.”\r\n\r\n“No, take it away; I can see in the dark.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you are like No. 34. They said he was so accustomed to darkness\r\nthat he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his dungeon.”\r\n\r\n“He spent fourteen years to arrive at that,” muttered the count.\r\n\r\nThe guide carried away the torch. The count had spoken correctly.\r\nScarcely had a few seconds elapsed, ere he saw everything as distinctly\r\nas by daylight. Then he looked around him, and really recognized his\r\ndungeon.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “there is the stone upon which I used to sit; there is\r\nthe impression made by my shoulders on the wall; there is the mark of\r\nmy blood made when one day I dashed my head against the wall. Oh, those\r\nfigures, how well I remember them! I made them one day to calculate the\r\nage of my father, that I might know whether I should find him still\r\nliving, and that of Mercédès, to know if I should find her still free.\r\nAfter finishing that calculation, I had a minute’s hope. I did not\r\nreckon upon hunger and infidelity!” and a bitter laugh escaped the\r\ncount.\r\n\r\nHe saw in fancy the burial of his father, and the marriage of Mercédès.\r\nOn the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription, the white\r\nletters of which were still visible on the green wall:\r\n\r\n“‘_Oh, God!_’” he read, “‘_preserve my memory!_’”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” he cried, “that was my only prayer at last; I no longer\r\nbegged for liberty, but memory; I dreaded to become mad and forgetful.\r\nOh, God, thou hast preserved my memory; I thank thee, I thank thee!”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall; the\r\nguide was coming; Monte Cristo went to meet him.\r\n\r\n“Follow me, sir;” and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted\r\nhim by a subterraneous passage to another entrance. There, again, Monte\r\nCristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts. The first thing that\r\nmet his eye was the meridian, drawn by the abbé on the wall, by which\r\nhe calculated the time; then he saw the remains of the bed on which the\r\npoor prisoner had died. The sight of this, instead of exciting the\r\nanguish experienced by the count in the dungeon, filled his heart with\r\na soft and grateful sentiment, and tears fell from his eyes.\r\n\r\n“This is where the mad abbé was kept, sir, and that is where the young\r\nman entered;” and the guide pointed to the opening, which had remained\r\nunclosed. “From the appearance of the stone,” he continued, “a learned\r\ngentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated\r\ntogether for ten years. Poor things! Those must have been ten weary\r\nyears.”\r\n\r\nDantès took some louis from his pocket, and gave them to the man who\r\nhad twice unconsciously pitied him. The guide took them, thinking them\r\nmerely a few pieces of little value; but the light of the torch\r\nrevealed their true worth.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” he said, “you have made a mistake; you have given me gold.”\r\n\r\n“I know it.”\r\n\r\nThe concierge looked upon the count with surprise.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” he cried, scarcely able to believe his good fortune—“sir, I\r\ncannot understand your generosity!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is very simple, my good fellow; I have been a sailor, and your\r\nstory touched me more than it would others.”\r\n\r\n“Then, sir, since you are so liberal, I ought to offer you something.”\r\n\r\n50227m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What have you to offer to me, my friend? Shells? Straw-work? Thank\r\nyou!”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, neither of those; something connected with this story.”\r\n\r\n“Really? What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said the guide; “I said to myself, ‘Something is always left\r\nin a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years,’ so I began to\r\nsound the wall.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” cried Monte Cristo, remembering the abbé’s two hiding-places.\r\n\r\n“After some search, I found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the\r\nhead of the bed, and at the hearth.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the count, “yes.”\r\n\r\n“I raised the stones, and found——”\r\n\r\n“A rope-ladder and some tools?”\r\n\r\n“How do you know that?” asked the guide in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“I do not know—I only guess it, because that sort of thing is generally\r\nfound in prisoners’ cells.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, a rope-ladder and tools.”\r\n\r\n“And have you them yet?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; I sold them to visitors, who considered them great\r\ncuriosities; but I have still something left.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked the count, impatiently.\r\n\r\n“A sort of book, written upon strips of cloth.”\r\n\r\n“Go and fetch it, my good fellow; and if it be what I hope, you will do\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\n“I will run for it, sir;” and the guide went out.\r\n\r\nThen the count knelt down by the side of the bed, which death had\r\nconverted into an altar.\r\n\r\n“Oh, second father,” he exclaimed, “thou who hast given me liberty,\r\nknowledge, riches; thou who, like beings of a superior order to\r\nourselves, couldst understand the science of good and evil; if in the\r\ndepths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can\r\nrespond to the voice of those who are left on earth; if after death the\r\nsoul ever revisit the places where we have lived and suffered,—then,\r\nnoble heart, sublime soul, then I conjure thee by the paternal love\r\nthou didst bear me, by the filial obedience I vowed to thee, grant me\r\nsome sign, some revelation! Remove from me the remains of doubt, which,\r\nif it change not to conviction, must become remorse!” The count bowed\r\nhis head, and clasped his hands together.\r\n\r\n“Here, sir,” said a voice behind him.\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo shuddered, and arose. The concierge held out the strips of\r\ncloth upon which the Abbé Faria had spread the riches of his mind. The\r\nmanuscript was the great work by the Abbé Faria upon the kingdoms of\r\nItaly. The count seized it hastily, his eyes immediately fell upon the\r\nepigraph, and he read:\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt tear out the dragons’ teeth, and shall trample the lions\r\nunder foot, saith the Lord.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” he exclaimed, “here is my answer. Thanks, father, thanks.” And\r\nfeeling in his pocket, he took thence a small pocket-book, which\r\ncontained ten bank-notes, each of 1,000 francs.\r\n\r\n“Here,” he said, “take this pocket-book.”\r\n\r\n“Do you give it to me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but only on condition that you will not open it till I am gone;”\r\nand placing in his breast the treasure he had just found, which was\r\nmore valuable to him than the richest jewel, he rushed out of the\r\ncorridor, and reaching his boat, cried, “To Marseilles!”\r\n\r\nThen, as he departed, he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison.\r\n\r\n“Woe,” he cried, “to those who confined me in that wretched prison; and\r\nwoe to those who forgot that I was there!”\r\n\r\n50229m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he repassed the Catalans, the count turned around and burying his\r\nhead in his cloak murmured the name of a woman. The victory was\r\ncomplete; twice he had overcome his doubts. The name he pronounced, in\r\na voice of tenderness, amounting almost to love, was that of Haydée.\r\n\r\nOn landing, the count turned towards the cemetery, where he felt sure\r\nof finding Morrel. He, too, ten years ago, had piously sought out a\r\ntomb, and sought it vainly. He, who returned to France with millions,\r\nhad been unable to find the grave of his father, who had perished from\r\nhunger. Morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot, but it had\r\nfallen down and the grave-digger had burnt it, as he did all the old\r\nwood in the churchyard.\r\n\r\nThe worthy merchant had been more fortunate. Dying in the arms of his\r\nchildren, he had been by them laid by the side of his wife, who had\r\npreceded him in eternity by two years. Two large slabs of marble, on\r\nwhich were inscribed their names, were placed on either side of a\r\nlittle enclosure, railed in, and shaded by four cypress-trees. Morrel\r\nwas leaning against one of these, mechanically fixing his eyes on the\r\ngraves. His grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious.\r\n\r\n50231m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Maximilian,” said the count, “you should not look on the graves, but\r\nthere;” and he pointed upwards.\r\n\r\n“The dead are everywhere,” said Morrel; “did you not yourself tell me\r\nso as we left Paris?”\r\n\r\n“Maximilian,” said the count, “you asked me during the journey to allow\r\nyou to remain some days at Marseilles. Do you still wish to do so?”\r\n\r\n“I have no wishes, count; only I fancy I could pass the time less\r\npainfully here than anywhere else.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better, for I must leave you; but I carry your word with\r\nme, do I not?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, count, I shall forget it.”\r\n\r\n“No, you will not forget it, because you are a man of honor, Morrel,\r\nbecause you have taken an oath, and are about to do so again.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, count, have pity upon me. I am so unhappy.”\r\n\r\n“I have known a man much more unfortunate than you, Morrel.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!”\r\n\r\n“Alas,” said Monte Cristo, “it is the infirmity of our nature always to\r\nbelieve ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides!”\r\n\r\n“What can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and\r\ndesired in the world?”\r\n\r\n“Listen, Morrel, and pay attention to what I am about to tell you. I\r\nknew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a\r\nwoman. He was young, he had an old father whom he loved, a betrothed\r\nbride whom he adored. He was about to marry her, when one of the\r\ncaprices of fate,—which would almost make us doubt the goodness of\r\nProvidence, if that Providence did not afterwards reveal itself by\r\nproving that all is but a means of conducting to an end,—one of those\r\ncaprices deprived him of his mistress, of the future of which he had\r\ndreamed (for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the\r\npresent), and cast him into a dungeon.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Morrel, “one quits a dungeon in a week, a month, or a year.”\r\n\r\n“He remained there fourteen years, Morrel,” said the count, placing his\r\nhand on the young man’s shoulder. Maximilian shuddered.\r\n\r\n“Fourteen years!” he muttered.\r\n\r\n“Fourteen years!” repeated the count. “During that time he had many\r\nmoments of despair. He also, Morrel, like you, considered himself the\r\nunhappiest of men.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Well, at the height of his despair God assisted him through human\r\nmeans. At first, perhaps, he did not recognize the infinite mercy of\r\nthe Lord, but at last he took patience and waited. One day he\r\nmiraculously left the prison, transformed, rich, powerful. His first\r\ncry was for his father; but that father was dead.”\r\n\r\n“My father, too, is dead,” said Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Yes; but your father died in your arms, happy, respected, rich, and\r\nfull of years; his father died poor, despairing, almost doubtful of\r\nProvidence; and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards, his\r\ntomb had disappeared, and no one could say, ‘There sleeps the father\r\nyou so well loved.’”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” exclaimed Morrel.\r\n\r\n“He was, then, a more unhappy son than you, Morrel, for he could not\r\neven find his father’s grave.”\r\n\r\n“But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?”\r\n\r\n“You are deceived, Morrel, that woman——”\r\n\r\n“She was dead?”\r\n\r\n“Worse than that, she was faithless, and had married one of the\r\npersecutors of her betrothed. You see, then, Morrel, that he was a more\r\nunhappy lover than you.”\r\n\r\n“And has he found consolation?”\r\n\r\n“He has at least found peace.”\r\n\r\n“And does he ever expect to be happy?”\r\n\r\n“He hopes so, Maximilian.”\r\n\r\nThe young man’s head fell on his breast.\r\n\r\n“You have my promise,” he said, after a minute’s pause, extending his\r\nhand to Monte Cristo. “Only remember——”\r\n\r\n“On the 5th of October, Morrel, I shall expect you at the Island of\r\nMonte Cristo. On the 4th a yacht will wait for you in the port of\r\nBastia, it will be called the _Eurus_. You will give your name to the\r\ncaptain, who will bring you to me. It is understood—is it not?”\r\n\r\n“But, count, do you remember that the 5th of October——”\r\n\r\n“Child,” replied the count, “not to know the value of a man’s word! I\r\nhave told you twenty times that if you wish to die on that day, I will\r\nassist you. Morrel, farewell!”\r\n\r\n“Do you leave me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I have business in Italy. I leave you alone in your struggle with\r\nmisfortune—alone with that strong-winged eagle which God sends to bear\r\naloft the elect to his feet. The story of Ganymede, Maximilian, is not\r\na fable, but an allegory.”\r\n\r\n“When do you leave?”\r\n\r\n“Immediately; the steamer waits, and in an hour I shall be far from\r\nyou. Will you accompany me to the harbor, Maximilian?”\r\n\r\n50233m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I am entirely yours, count.”\r\n\r\nMorrel accompanied the count to the harbor. The white steam was\r\nascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney. The steamer\r\nsoon disappeared, and in an hour afterwards, as the count had said, was\r\nscarcely distinguishable in the horizon amidst the fogs of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 114. Peppino\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the steamer disappeared behind Cape Morgiou, a\r\nman travelling post on the road from Florence to Rome had just passed\r\nthe little town of Aquapendente. He was travelling fast enough to cover\r\na great deal of ground without exciting suspicion. This man was dressed\r\nin a greatcoat, or rather a surtout, a little worse for the journey,\r\nbut which exhibited the ribbon of the Legion of Honor still fresh and\r\nbrilliant, a decoration which also ornamented the under coat. He might\r\nbe recognized, not only by these signs, but also from the accent with\r\nwhich he spoke to the postilion, as a Frenchman.\r\n\r\nAnother proof that he was a native of the universal country was\r\napparent in the fact of his knowing no other Italian words than the\r\nterms used in music, and which like the “goddam” of Figaro, served all\r\npossible linguistic requirements. “_Allegro!_” he called out to the\r\npostilions at every ascent. “_Moderato!_” he cried as they descended.\r\nAnd heaven knows there are hills enough between Rome and Florence by\r\nthe way of Aquapendente! These two words greatly amused the men to whom\r\nthey were addressed. On reaching La Storta, the point from whence Rome\r\nis first visible, the traveller evinced none of the enthusiastic\r\ncuriosity which usually leads strangers to stand up and endeavor to\r\ncatch sight of the dome of Saint Peter’s, which may be seen long before\r\nany other object is distinguishable. No, he merely drew a pocketbook\r\nfrom his pocket, and took from it a paper folded in four, and after\r\nhaving examined it in a manner almost reverential, he said:\r\n\r\n“Good! I have it still!”\r\n\r\n50235m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe carriage entered by the Porta del Popolo, turned to the left, and\r\nstopped at the Hôtel d’Espagne. Old Pastrini, our former acquaintance,\r\nreceived the traveller at the door, hat in hand. The traveller\r\nalighted, ordered a good dinner, and inquired the address of the house\r\nof Thomson & French, which was immediately given to him, as it was one\r\nof the most celebrated in Rome. It was situated in the Via dei Banchi,\r\nnear St. Peter’s.\r\n\r\nIn Rome, as everywhere else, the arrival of a post-chaise is an event.\r\nTen young descendants of Marius and the Gracchi, barefooted and out at\r\nelbows, with one hand resting on the hip and the other gracefully\r\ncurved above the head, stared at the traveller, the post-chaise, and\r\nthe horses; to these were added about fifty little vagabonds from the\r\nPapal States, who earned a pittance by diving into the Tiber at high\r\nwater from the bridge of St. Angelo. Now, as these street Arabs of\r\nRome, more fortunate than those of Paris, understand every language,\r\nmore especially the French, they heard the traveller order an\r\napartment, a dinner, and finally inquire the way to the house of\r\nThomson & French.\r\n\r\nThe result was that when the new-comer left the hotel with the\r\n_cicerone_, a man detached himself from the rest of the idlers, and\r\nwithout having been seen by the traveller, and appearing to excite no\r\nattention from the guide, followed the stranger with as much skill as a\r\nParisian police agent would have used.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of Thomson &\r\nFrench that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed, but left\r\nword for the carriage to overtake him on the road, or to wait for him\r\nat the bankers’ door. He reached it before the carriage arrived. The\r\nFrenchman entered, leaving in the anteroom his guide, who immediately\r\nentered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers\r\nwho are always to be found in Rome at the doors of banking-houses,\r\nchurches, museums, or theatres. With the Frenchman, the man who had\r\nfollowed him entered too; the Frenchman knocked at the inner door, and\r\nentered the first room; his shadow did the same.\r\n\r\n“Messrs. Thomson & French?” inquired the stranger.\r\n\r\nAn attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n“Whom shall I announce?” said the attendant.\r\n\r\n“Baron Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“Follow me,” said the man.\r\n\r\nA door opened, through which the attendant and the baron disappeared.\r\nThe man who had followed Danglars sat down on a bench. The clerk\r\ncontinued to write for the next five minutes; the man preserved\r\nprofound silence, and remained perfectly motionless. Then the pen of\r\nthe clerk ceased to move over the paper; he raised his head, and\r\nappearing to be perfectly sure of privacy:\r\n\r\n“Ah, ha,” he said, “here you are, Peppino!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” was the laconic reply. “You have found out that there is\r\nsomething worth having about this large gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“There is no great merit due to me, for we were informed of it.”\r\n\r\n“You know his business here, then.”\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu_, he has come to draw, but I don’t know how much!”\r\n\r\n“You will know presently, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, only do not give me false information as you did the other\r\nday.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?—of whom do you speak? Was it the Englishman who\r\ncarried off 3,000 crowns from here the other day?”\r\n\r\n50237m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No; he really had 3,000 crowns, and we found them. I mean the Russian\r\nprince, who you said had 30,000 livres, and we only found 22,000.”\r\n\r\n“You must have searched badly.”\r\n\r\n“Luigi Vampa himself searched.”\r\n\r\n“In that case he must either have paid his debts——”\r\n\r\n“A Russian do that?”\r\n\r\n“Or spent the money?”\r\n\r\n“Possibly, after all.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. But you must let me make my observations, or the Frenchman\r\nwill transact his business without my knowing the sum.”\r\n\r\nPeppino nodded, and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a\r\nfew prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which\r\nDanglars and the attendant had gone out. At the expiration of ten\r\nminutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance.\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Peppino of his friend.\r\n\r\n“Joy, joy—the sum is large!”\r\n\r\n“Five or six millions, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you know the amount.”\r\n\r\n“On the receipt of the Count of Monte Cristo?”\r\n\r\n“Why, how came you to be so well acquainted with all this?”\r\n\r\n“I told you we were informed beforehand.”\r\n\r\n“Then why do you apply to me?”\r\n\r\n“That I may be sure I have the right man.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is indeed he. Five millions—a pretty sum, eh, Peppino?”\r\n\r\n“Hush—here is our man!” The clerk seized his pen, and Peppino his\r\nbeads; one was writing and the other praying when the door opened.\r\nDanglars looked radiant with joy; the banker accompanied him to the\r\ndoor. Peppino followed Danglars.\r\n\r\nAccording to the arrangements, the carriage was waiting at the door.\r\nThe guide held the door open. Guides are useful people, who will turn\r\ntheir hands to anything. Danglars leaped into the carriage like a young\r\nman of twenty. The _cicerone_ reclosed the door, and sprang up by the\r\nside of the coachman. Peppino mounted the seat behind.\r\n\r\n“Will your excellency visit Saint Peter’s?” asked the _cicerone_.\r\n\r\n“I did not come to Rome to see,” said Danglars aloud; then he added\r\nsoftly, with an avaricious smile, “I came to touch!” and he rapped his\r\npocket-book, in which he had just placed a letter.\r\n\r\n“Then your excellency is going——”\r\n\r\n“To the hotel.”\r\n\r\n“Casa Pastrini!” said the _cicerone_ to the coachman, and the carriage\r\ndrove rapidly on.\r\n\r\n50239m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTen minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment, and Peppino\r\nstationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel, after\r\nhaving whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of\r\nMarius and the Gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter,\r\nwho immediately ran down the road leading to the Capitol at his fullest\r\nspeed. Danglars was tired and sleepy; he therefore went to bed, placing\r\nhis pocketbook under his pillow. Peppino had a little spare time, so he\r\nhad a game of _morra_ with the facchini, lost three crowns, and then to\r\nconsole himself drank a bottle of Orvieto.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Danglars awoke late, though he went to bed so early;\r\nhe had not slept well for five or six nights, even if he had slept at\r\nall. He breakfasted heartily, and caring little, as he said, for the\r\nbeauties of the Eternal City, ordered post-horses at noon. But Danglars\r\nhad not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of\r\nthe posting-master. The horses only arrived at two o’clock, and the\r\n_cicerone_ did not bring the passport till three.\r\n\r\nAll these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door\r\nof Signor Pastrini’s; the descendants of Marius and the Gracchi were\r\nalso not wanting. The baron walked triumphantly through the crowd, who\r\nfor the sake of gain styled him “your excellency.” As Danglars had\r\nhitherto contented himself with being called a baron, he felt rather\r\nflattered at the title of excellency, and distributed a dozen silver\r\ncoins among the beggars, who were ready, for twelve more, to call him\r\n“your highness.”\r\n\r\n“Which road?” asked the postilion in Italian.\r\n\r\n“The Ancona road,” replied the baron. Signor Pastrini interpreted the\r\nquestion and answer, and the horses galloped off.\r\n\r\nDanglars intended travelling to Venice, where he would receive one part\r\nof his fortune, and then proceeding to Vienna, where he would find the\r\nrest, he meant to take up his residence in the latter town, which he\r\nhad been told was a city of pleasure.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely advanced three leagues out of Rome when daylight began\r\nto disappear. Danglars had not intended starting so late, or he would\r\nhave remained; he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it\r\nwould be before they reached the next town. “_Non capisco_” (do not\r\nunderstand), was the reply. Danglars bent his head, which he meant to\r\nimply, “Very well.” The carriage again moved on.\r\n\r\n“I will stop at the first posting-house,” said Danglars to himself.\r\n\r\nHe still felt the same self-satisfaction which he had experienced the\r\nprevious evening, and which had procured him so good a night’s rest. He\r\nwas luxuriously stretched in a good English calash, with double\r\nsprings; he was drawn by four good horses, at full gallop; he knew the\r\nrelay to be at a distance of seven leagues. What subject of meditation\r\ncould present itself to the banker, so fortunately become bankrupt?\r\n\r\nDanglars thought for ten minutes about his wife in Paris; another ten\r\nminutes about his daughter travelling with Mademoiselle d’Armilly; the\r\nsame period was given to his creditors, and the manner in which he\r\nintended spending their money; and then, having no subject left for\r\ncontemplation, he shut his eyes, and fell asleep. Now and then a jolt\r\nmore violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes; then he felt\r\nthat he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same\r\ncountry, thickly strewn with broken aqueducts, which looked like\r\ngranite giants petrified while running a race. But the night was cold,\r\ndull, and rainy, and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to\r\nremain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to\r\nmake inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was “_Non capisco_.”\r\n\r\n50241m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDanglars therefore continued to sleep, saying to himself that he would\r\nbe sure to awake at the posting-house. The carriage stopped. Danglars\r\nfancied that they had reached the long-desired point; he opened his\r\neyes and looked through the window, expecting to find himself in the\r\nmidst of some town, or at least village; but he saw nothing except what\r\nseemed like a ruin, where three or four men went and came like shadows.\r\n\r\nDanglars waited a moment, expecting the postilion to come and demand\r\npayment with the termination of his stage. He intended taking advantage\r\nof the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor; but\r\nthe horses were unharnessed, and others put in their places, without\r\nanyone claiming money from the traveller. Danglars, astonished, opened\r\nthe door; but a strong hand pushed him back, and the carriage rolled\r\non. The baron was completely roused.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” he said to the postilion, “eh, _mio caro?_”\r\n\r\nThis was another little piece of Italian the baron had learned from\r\nhearing his daughter sing Italian duets with Cavalcanti. But _mio caro_\r\ndid not reply. Danglars then opened the window.\r\n\r\n“Come, my friend,” he said, thrusting his hand through the opening,\r\n“where are we going?”\r\n\r\n“_Dentro la testa!_” answered a solemn and imperious voice, accompanied\r\nby a menacing gesture.\r\n\r\nDanglars thought _dentro la testa_ meant, “Put in your head!” He was\r\nmaking rapid progress in Italian. He obeyed, not without some\r\nuneasiness, which, momentarily increasing, caused his mind, instead of\r\nbeing as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey, to fill with\r\nideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake, more especially\r\none in such a situation as Danglars. His eyes acquired that quality\r\nwhich in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see\r\ndistinctly, and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed.\r\nBefore we are alarmed, we see correctly; when we are alarmed, we see\r\ndouble; and when we have been alarmed, we see nothing but trouble.\r\nDanglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n“Some gendarme!” he exclaimed. “Can I have been intercepted by French\r\ntelegrams to the pontifical authorities?”\r\n\r\nHe resolved to end his anxiety. “Where are you taking me?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“_Dentro la testa_,” replied the same voice, with the same menacing\r\naccent.\r\n\r\nDanglars turned to the left; another man on horseback was galloping on\r\nthat side.\r\n\r\n“Decidedly,” said Danglars, with the perspiration on his forehead, “I\r\nmust be under arrest.” And he threw himself back in the calash, not\r\nthis time to sleep, but to think.\r\n\r\nDirectly afterwards the moon rose. He then saw the great aqueducts,\r\nthose stone phantoms which he had before remarked, only then they were\r\non the right hand, now they were on the left. He understood that they\r\nhad described a circle, and were bringing him back to Rome.\r\n\r\n“Oh, unfortunate!” he cried, “they must have obtained my arrest.”\r\n\r\nThe carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed. An hour of\r\nterror elapsed, for every spot they passed showed that they were on the\r\nroad back. At length he saw a dark mass, against which it seemed as if\r\nthe carriage was about to dash; but the vehicle turned to one side,\r\nleaving the barrier behind and Danglars saw that it was one of the\r\nramparts encircling Rome.\r\n\r\n50243m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Mon dieu!_” cried Danglars, “we are not returning to Rome; then it is\r\nnot justice which is pursuing me! Gracious heavens; another idea\r\npresents itself—what if they should be——”\r\n\r\nHis hair stood on end. He remembered those interesting stories, so\r\nlittle believed in Paris, respecting Roman bandits; he remembered the\r\nadventures that Albert de Morcerf had related when it was intended that\r\nhe should marry Mademoiselle Eugénie. “They are robbers, perhaps,” he\r\nmuttered.\r\n\r\nJust then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road.\r\nDanglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road, and perceived\r\nmonuments of a singular form, and his mind now recalled all the details\r\nMorcerf had related, and comparing them with his own situation, he felt\r\nsure that he must be on the Appian Way. On the left, in a sort of\r\nvalley, he perceived a circular excavation. It was Caracalla’s circus.\r\nOn a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage, it\r\nstopped. At the same time the door was opened. “_Scendi!_” exclaimed a\r\ncommanding voice.\r\n\r\nDanglars instantly descended; although he did not yet speak Italian, he\r\nunderstood it very well. More dead than alive, he looked around him.\r\nFour men surrounded him, besides the postilion.\r\n\r\n“_Di quà_,” said one of the men, descending a little path leading out\r\nof the Appian Way. Danglars followed his guide without opposition, and\r\nhad no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were\r\nfollowing him. Still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal\r\ndistances from one another, like sentinels. After walking for about ten\r\nminutes, during which Danglars did not exchange a single word with his\r\nguide, he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds;\r\nthree men, standing silent, formed a triangle, of which he was the\r\ncentre. He wished to speak, but his tongue refused to move.\r\n\r\n“_Avanti!_” said the same sharp and imperative voice.\r\n\r\nThis time Danglars had double reason to understand, for if the word and\r\ngesture had not explained the speaker’s meaning, it was clearly\r\nexpressed by the man walking behind him, who pushed him so rudely that\r\nhe struck against the guide. This guide was our friend Peppino, who\r\ndashed into the thicket of high weeds, through a path which none but\r\nlizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road.\r\n\r\nPeppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges; the rock, half\r\nopen, afforded a passage to the young man, who disappeared like the\r\nevil spirits in the fairy tales. The voice and gesture of the man who\r\nfollowed Danglars ordered him to do the same. There was no longer any\r\ndoubt, the bankrupt was in the hands of Roman banditti. Danglars\r\nacquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions,\r\nand who is rendered brave by fear. Notwithstanding his large stomach,\r\ncertainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the Campagna, he\r\nslid down like Peppino, and closing his eyes fell upon his feet. As he\r\ntouched the ground, he opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n50245m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe path was wide, but dark. Peppino, who cared little for being\r\nrecognized now that he was in his own territories, struck a light and\r\nlit a torch. Two other men descended after Danglars forming the\r\nrearguard, and pushing Danglars whenever he happened to stop, they came\r\nby a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors. The walls\r\nwere hollowed out in sepulchres, one above the other, and which seemed\r\nin contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes, like\r\nthose which we see on the faces of the dead. A sentinel struck the\r\nrings of his carbine against his left hand.\r\n\r\n“Who comes there?” he cried.\r\n\r\n“A friend, a friend!” said Peppino; “but where is the captain?”\r\n\r\n“There,” said the sentinel, pointing over his shoulder to a spacious\r\ncrypt, hollowed out of the rock, the lights from which shone into the\r\npassage through the large arched openings.\r\n\r\n“Fine spoil, captain, fine spoil!” said Peppino in Italian, and taking\r\nDanglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening\r\nresembling a door, through which they entered the apartment which the\r\ncaptain appeared to have made his dwelling-place.\r\n\r\n“Is this the man?” asked the captain, who was attentively reading\r\nPlutarch’s _Life of Alexander_.\r\n\r\n“Himself, captain—himself.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, show him to me.”\r\n\r\nAt this rather impertinent order, Peppino raised his torch to the face\r\nof Danglars, who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes\r\nburnt. His agitated features presented the appearance of pale and\r\nhideous terror.\r\n\r\n“The man is tired,” said the captain, “conduct him to his bed.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” murmured Danglars, “that bed is probably one of the coffins\r\nhollowed in the wall, and the sleep I shall enjoy will be death from\r\none of the poniards I see glistening in the darkness.”\r\n\r\nFrom their beds of dried leaves or wolf-skins at the back of the\r\nchamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by\r\nAlbert de Morcerf reading _Cæsar’s Commentaries_, and by Danglars\r\nstudying the _Life of Alexander_. The banker uttered a groan and\r\nfollowed his guide; he neither supplicated nor exclaimed. He no longer\r\npossessed strength, will, power, or feeling; he followed where they led\r\nhim. At length he found himself at the foot of a staircase, and he\r\nmechanically lifted his foot five or six times. Then a low door was\r\nopened before him, and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead\r\nhe entered a small room cut out of the rock. The cell was clean, though\r\nempty, and dry, though situated at an immeasurable distance under the\r\nearth. A bed of dried grass covered with goat-skins was placed in one\r\ncorner. Danglars brightened up on beholding it, fancying that it gave\r\nsome promise of safety.\r\n\r\n“Oh, God be praised,” he said; “it is a real bed!”\r\n\r\nThis was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name\r\nof God. He had not done so for ten years before.\r\n\r\n“_Ecco!_” said the guide, and pushing Danglars into the cell, he closed\r\nthe door upon him.\r\n\r\nA bolt grated and Danglars was a prisoner. If there had been no bolt,\r\nit would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the\r\ngarrison who held the catacombs of St. Sebastian, encamped round a\r\nmaster whom our readers must have recognized as the famous Luigi Vampa.\r\n\r\nDanglars, too, had recognized the bandit, whose existence he would not\r\nbelieve when Albert de Morcerf mentioned him in Paris; and not only did\r\nhe recognize him, but the cell in which Albert had been confined, and\r\nwhich was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers. These\r\nrecollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by Danglars, and\r\nrestored him to some degree of tranquillity. Since the bandits had not\r\ndespatched him at once, he felt that they would not kill him at all.\r\nThey had arrested him for the purpose of robbery, and as he had only a\r\nfew louis about him, he doubted not he would be ransomed.\r\n\r\nHe remembered that Morcerf had been taxed at 4,000 crowns, and as he\r\nconsidered himself of much greater importance than Morcerf he fixed his\r\nown price at 8,000 crowns. Eight thousand crowns amounted to 48,000\r\nlivres; he would then have about 5,050,000 francs left. With this sum\r\nhe could manage to keep out of difficulties. Therefore, tolerably\r\nsecure in being able to extricate himself from his position, provided\r\nhe were not rated at the unreasonable sum of 5,050,000 francs, he\r\nstretched himself on his bed, and after turning over two or three\r\ntimes, fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life Luigi\r\nVampa was studying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare\r\n\r\nWe awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by Danglars. He awoke.\r\nTo a Parisian accustomed to silken curtains, walls hung with velvet\r\ndrapery, and the soft perfume of burning wood, the white smoke of which\r\ndiffuses itself in graceful curves around the room, the appearance of\r\nthe whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like\r\nthe continuation of some disagreeable dream. But in such a situation a\r\nsingle moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” he murmured, “I am in the hands of the brigands of whom\r\nAlbert de Morcerf spoke.” His first idea was to breathe, that he might\r\nknow whether he was wounded. He borrowed this from _Don Quixote_, the\r\nonly book he had ever read, but which he still slightly remembered.\r\n\r\n“No,” he cried, “they have not wounded, but perhaps they have robbed\r\nme!” and he thrust his hands into his pockets. They were untouched; the\r\nhundred louis he had reserved for his journey from Rome to Venice were\r\nin his trousers pocket, and in that of his greatcoat he found the\r\nlittle note-case containing his letter of credit for 5,050,000 francs.\r\n\r\n“Singular bandits!” he exclaimed; “they have left me my purse and\r\npocket-book. As I was saying last night, they intend me to be ransomed.\r\nHello, here is my watch! Let me see what time it is.”\r\n\r\nDanglars’ watch, one of Breguet’s repeaters, which he had carefully\r\nwound up on the previous night, struck half past five. Without this,\r\nDanglars would have been quite ignorant of the time, for daylight did\r\nnot reach his cell. Should he demand an explanation from the bandits,\r\nor should he wait patiently for them to propose it? The last\r\nalternative seemed the most prudent, so he waited until twelve o’clock.\r\nDuring all this time a sentinel, who had been relieved at eight\r\no’clock, had been watching his door.\r\n\r\n50249m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDanglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept\r\nwatch over him. He had noticed that a few rays, not of daylight, but\r\nfrom a lamp, penetrated through the ill-joined planks of the door; he\r\napproached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful\r\nof brandy, which, owing to the leathern bottle containing it, sent\r\nforth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to Danglars. “Faugh!” he\r\nexclaimed, retreating to the farther corner of his cell.\r\n\r\nAt twelve this man was replaced by another functionary, and Danglars,\r\nwishing to catch sight of his new guardian, approached the door again.\r\n\r\nHe was an athletic, gigantic bandit, with large eyes, thick lips, and a\r\nflat nose; his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around\r\nhis shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Ah, ha,” cried Danglars, “this fellow is more like an ogre than\r\nanything else; however, I am rather too old and tough to be very good\r\neating!”\r\n\r\nWe see that Danglars was collected enough to jest; at the same time, as\r\nthough to disprove the ogreish propensities, the man took some black\r\nbread, cheese, and onions from his wallet, which he began devouring\r\nvoraciously.\r\n\r\n“May I be hanged,” said Danglars, glancing at the bandit’s dinner\r\nthrough the crevices of the door,—“may I be hanged if I can understand\r\nhow people can eat such filth!” and he withdrew to seat himself upon\r\nhis goat-skin, which reminded him of the smell of the brandy.\r\n\r\nBut the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible, and there are certain\r\ninvitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very\r\nirresistibly to a fasting stomach. Danglars felt his own not to be very\r\nwell supplied just then, and gradually the man appeared less ugly, the\r\nbread less black, and the cheese more fresh, while those dreadful\r\nvulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side-dishes,\r\nwhich his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said,\r\n“Monsieur Deniseau, let me have a nice little fricassee today.” He got\r\nup and knocked on the door; the bandit raised his head. Danglars knew\r\nthat he was heard, so he redoubled his blows.\r\n\r\n“_Che cosa?_” asked the bandit.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said Danglars, tapping his fingers against the door, “I\r\nthink it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat!”\r\n\r\nBut whether he did not understand him, or whether he had received no\r\norders respecting the nourishment of Danglars, the giant, without\r\nanswering, went on with his dinner. Danglars’ feelings were hurt, and\r\nnot wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute, the banker\r\nthrew himself down again on his goat-skin and did not breathe another\r\nword.\r\n\r\nFour hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit.\r\nDanglars, who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the\r\nstomach, arose softly, again applied his eye to the crack of the door,\r\nand recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide. It was,\r\nindeed, Peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as\r\npossible by seating himself opposite to the door, and placing between\r\nhis legs an earthen pan, containing chick-peas stewed with bacon. Near\r\nthe pan he also placed a pretty little basket of Villetri grapes and a\r\nflask of Orvieto. Peppino was decidedly an epicure. Danglars watched\r\nthese preparations and his mouth watered.\r\n\r\n“Come,” he said to himself, “let me try if he will be more tractable\r\nthan the other;” and he tapped gently at the door.\r\n\r\n“_On y va_,” (coming) exclaimed Peppino, who from frequenting the house\r\nof Signor Pastrini understood French perfectly in all its idioms.\r\n\r\nDanglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in\r\nsuch a furious manner, “Put in your head!” But this was not the time\r\nfor recrimination, so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said\r\nwith a gracious smile:\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, sir, but are they not going to give me any dinner?”\r\n\r\n“Does your excellency happen to be hungry?”\r\n\r\n“Happen to be hungry,—that’s pretty good, when I haven’t eaten for\r\ntwenty-four hours!” muttered Danglars. Then he added aloud, “Yes, sir,\r\nI am hungry—very hungry.”\r\n\r\n“And your excellency wants something to eat?”\r\n\r\n“At once, if possible”\r\n\r\n“Nothing easier,” said Peppino. “Here you can get anything you want; by\r\npaying for it, of course, as among honest folk.”\r\n\r\n“Of course!” cried Danglars. “Although, in justice, the people who\r\narrest and imprison you, ought, at least, to feed you.”\r\n\r\n“That is not the custom, excellency,” said Peppino.\r\n\r\n“A bad reason,” replied Danglars, who reckoned on conciliating his\r\nkeeper; “but I am content. Let me have some dinner!”\r\n\r\n“At once! What would your excellency like?”\r\n\r\nAnd Peppino placed his pan on the ground, so that the steam rose\r\ndirectly under the nostrils of Danglars. “Give your orders.”\r\n\r\n“Have you kitchens here?”\r\n\r\n“Kitchens?—of course—complete ones.”\r\n\r\n“And cooks?”\r\n\r\n“Excellent!”\r\n\r\n“Well, a fowl, fish, game,—it signifies little, so that I eat.”\r\n\r\n“As your excellency pleases. You mentioned a fowl, I think?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a fowl.”\r\n\r\nPeppino, turning around, shouted, “A fowl for his excellency!” His\r\nvoice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome, graceful, and\r\nhalf-naked young man appeared, bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his\r\nhead, without the assistance of his hands.\r\n\r\n“I could almost believe myself at the Café de Paris,” murmured\r\nDanglars.\r\n\r\n“Here, your excellency,” said Peppino, taking the fowl from the young\r\nbandit and placing it on the worm-eaten table, which with the stool and\r\nthe goat-skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell. Danglars\r\nasked for a knife and fork.\r\n\r\n“Here, excellency,” said Peppino, offering him a little blunt knife and\r\na boxwood fork. Danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the\r\nother, and was about to cut up the fowl.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, excellency,” said Peppino, placing his hand on the banker’s\r\nshoulder; “people pay here before they eat. They might not be\r\nsatisfied, and——”\r\n\r\n“Ah, ha,” thought Danglars, “this is not so much like Paris, except\r\nthat I shall probably be skinned! Never mind, I’ll fix that all right.\r\nI have always heard how cheap poultry is in Italy; I should think a\r\nfowl is worth about twelve sous at Rome.—There,” he said, throwing a\r\nlouis down.\r\n\r\nPeppino picked up the louis, and Danglars again prepared to carve the\r\nfowl.\r\n\r\n“Stay a moment, your excellency,” said Peppino, rising; “you still owe\r\nme something.”\r\n\r\n“I said they would skin me,” thought Danglars; but resolving to resist\r\nthe extortion, he said, “Come, how much do I owe you for this fowl?”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency has given me a louis on account.”\r\n\r\n“A louis on account for a fowl?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; and your excellency now owes me 4,999 louis.”\r\n\r\nDanglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke.\r\n\r\n“Very droll,” he muttered, “very droll indeed,” and he again began to\r\ncarve the fowl, when Peppino stopped the baron’s right hand with his\r\nleft, and held out his other hand.\r\n\r\n“Come, now,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Is it not a joke?” said Danglars.\r\n\r\n“We never joke,” replied Peppino, solemn as a Quaker.\r\n\r\n“What! A hundred thousand francs for a fowl!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, excellency, you cannot imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in\r\nthese horrible caves!”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, this is very droll—very amusing—I allow; but, as I am very\r\nhungry, pray allow me to eat. Stay, here is another louis for you.”\r\n\r\n“Then that will make only 4,998 louis more,” said Peppino with the same\r\nindifference. “I shall get them all in time.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, as for that,” said Danglars, angry at this prolongation of the\r\njest,—“as for that you won’t get them at all. Go to the devil! You do\r\nnot know with whom you have to deal!”\r\n\r\n50253m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeppino made a sign, and the youth hastily removed the fowl. Danglars\r\nthrew himself upon his goat-skin, and Peppino, reclosing the door,\r\nagain began eating his peas and bacon. Though Danglars could not see\r\nPeppino, the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation.\r\nHe was certainly eating, and noisily too, like an ill-bred man.\r\n“Brute!” said Danglars. Peppino pretended not to hear him, and without\r\neven turning his head continued to eat slowly. Danglars’ stomach felt\r\nso empty, that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it\r\nagain; still he had patience for another half-hour, which appeared to\r\nhim like a century. He again arose and went to the door.\r\n\r\n“Come, sir, do not keep me starving here any longer, but tell me what\r\nthey want.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, your excellency, it is you who should tell us what you want. Give\r\nyour orders, and we will execute them.”\r\n\r\n“Then open the door directly.” Peppino obeyed. “Now look here, I want\r\nsomething to eat! To eat—do you hear?”\r\n\r\n“Are you hungry?”\r\n\r\n“Come, you understand me.”\r\n\r\n“What would your excellency like to eat?”\r\n\r\n“A piece of dry bread, since the fowls are beyond all price in this\r\naccursed place.”\r\n\r\n“Bread? Very well. Holloa, there, some bread!” he called. The youth\r\nbrought a small loaf. “How much?” asked Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Four thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight louis,” said Peppino; “You\r\nhave paid two louis in advance.”\r\n\r\n50255m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What? One hundred thousand francs for a loaf?”\r\n\r\n“One hundred thousand francs,” repeated Peppino.\r\n\r\n“But you only asked 100,000 francs for a fowl!”\r\n\r\n“We have a fixed price for all our provisions. It signifies nothing\r\nwhether you eat much or little—whether you have ten dishes or one—it is\r\nalways the same price.”\r\n\r\n“What, still keeping up this silly jest? My dear fellow, it is\r\nperfectly ridiculous—stupid! You had better tell me at once that you\r\nintend starving me to death.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear, no, your excellency, unless you intend to commit suicide.\r\nPay and eat.”\r\n\r\n“And what am I to pay with, brute?” said Danglars, enraged. “Do you\r\nsuppose I carry 100,000 francs in my pocket?”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency has 5,050,000 francs in your pocket; that will be\r\nfifty fowls at 100,000 francs apiece, and half a fowl for the 50,000.”\r\n\r\nDanglars shuddered. The bandage fell from his eyes, and he understood\r\nthe joke, which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n“Come,” he said, “if I pay you the 100,000 francs, will you be\r\nsatisfied, and allow me to eat at my ease?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Peppino.\r\n\r\n“But how can I pay them?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing easier; you have an account open with Messrs. Thomson &\r\nFrench, Via dei Banchi, Rome; give me a draft for 4,998 louis on these\r\ngentlemen, and our banker shall take it.”\r\n\r\nDanglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace, so he took the\r\npen, ink, and paper Peppino offered him, wrote the draft, and signed\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Here,” he said, “here is a draft at sight.”\r\n\r\n“And here is your fowl.”\r\n\r\nDanglars sighed while he carved the fowl; it appeared very thin for the\r\nprice it had cost. As for Peppino, he examined the paper attentively,\r\nput it into his pocket, and continued eating his peas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 116. The Pardon\r\n\r\nThe next day Danglars was again hungry; certainly the air of that\r\ndungeon was very provocative of appetite. The prisoner expected that he\r\nwould be at no expense that day, for like an economical man he had\r\nconcealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of\r\nhis cell. But he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty; he had\r\nforgotten that. He struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave\r\nto the roof of his mouth; then, no longer able to resist, he called\r\nout. The sentinel opened the door; it was a new face. He thought it\r\nwould be better to transact business with his old acquaintance, so he\r\nsent for Peppino.\r\n\r\n“Here I am, your excellency,” said Peppino, with an eagerness which\r\nDanglars thought favorable to him. “What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“Something to drink.”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near Rome.”\r\n\r\n“Then give me water,” cried Danglars, endeavoring to parry the blow.\r\n\r\n“Oh, water is even more scarce than wine, your excellency,—there has\r\nbeen such a drought.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” thought Danglars, “it is the same old story.” And while he\r\nsmiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke, he felt his\r\ntemples get moist with perspiration.\r\n\r\n“Come, my friend,” said Danglars, seeing that he made no impression on\r\nPeppino, “you will not refuse me a glass of wine?”\r\n\r\n“I have already told you that we do not sell at retail.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, let me have a bottle of the least expensive.”\r\n\r\n“They are all the same price.”\r\n\r\n“And what is that?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty-five thousand francs a bottle.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” cried Danglars, in a tone whose bitterness Harpagon30 alone\r\nhas been capable of revealing—“tell me that you wish to despoil me of\r\nall; it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal.”\r\n\r\n“It is possible such may be the master’s intention.”\r\n\r\n“The master?—who is he?”\r\n\r\n“The person to whom you were conducted yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Where is he?”\r\n\r\n“Here.”\r\n\r\n“Let me see him.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\nAnd the next moment Luigi Vampa appeared before Danglars.\r\n\r\n“You sent for me?” he said to the prisoner.\r\n\r\n“Are you, sir, the chief of the people who brought me here?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your excellency. What then?”\r\n\r\n“How much do you require for my ransom?”\r\n\r\n“Merely the 5,000,000 you have about you.” Danglars felt a dreadful\r\nspasm dart through his heart.\r\n\r\n“But this is all I have left in the world,” he said, “out of an immense\r\nfortune. If you deprive me of that, take away my life also.”\r\n\r\n“We are forbidden to shed your blood.”\r\n\r\n“And by whom are you forbidden?”\r\n\r\n“By him we obey.”\r\n\r\n“You do, then, obey someone?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a chief.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you said you were the chief?”\r\n\r\n“So I am of these men; but there is another over me.”\r\n\r\n“And did your superior order you to treat me in this way?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But my purse will be exhausted.”\r\n\r\n“Probably.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Danglars, “will you take a million?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Two millions?—three?—four? Come, four? I will give them to you on\r\ncondition that you let me go.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you offer me 4,000,000 for what is worth 5,000,000? This is a\r\nkind of usury, banker, that I do not understand.”\r\n\r\n“Take all, then—take all, I tell you, and kill me!”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, calm yourself. You will excite your blood, and that would\r\nproduce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy. Be\r\nmore economical.”\r\n\r\n“But when I have no more money left to pay you?” asked the infuriated\r\nDanglars.\r\n\r\n“Then you must suffer hunger.”\r\n\r\n“Suffer hunger?” said Danglars, becoming pale.\r\n\r\n“Most likely,” replied Vampa coolly.\r\n\r\n“But you say you do not wish to kill me?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“And yet you will let me perish with hunger?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that is a different thing.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, wretches,” cried Danglars, “I will defy your infamous\r\ncalculations—I would rather die at once! You may torture, torment, kill\r\nme, but you shall not have my signature again!”\r\n\r\n“As your excellency pleases,” said Vampa, as he left the cell.\r\n\r\nDanglars, raving, threw himself on the goat-skin. Who could these men\r\nbe? Who was the invisible chief? What could be his intentions towards\r\nhim? And why, when everyone else was allowed to be ransomed, might he\r\nnot also be? Oh, yes; certainly a speedy, violent death would be a fine\r\nmeans of deceiving these remorseless enemies, who appeared to pursue\r\nhim with such incomprehensible vengeance. But to die? For the first\r\ntime in his life, Danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread\r\nand desire; the time had come when the implacable spectre, which exists\r\nin the mind of every human creature, arrested his attention and called\r\nout with every pulsation of his heart, “Thou shalt die!”\r\n\r\nDanglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase; first it flies,\r\nthen despairs, and at last, by the very force of desperation, sometimes\r\nsucceeds in eluding its pursuers. Danglars meditated an escape; but the\r\nwalls were solid rock, a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to\r\nthe cell, and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually\r\npassed. His resolution not to sign lasted two days, after which he\r\noffered a million for some food. They sent him a magnificent supper,\r\nand took his million.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer, but to have\r\neverything he wanted. At the end of twelve days, after having made a\r\nsplendid dinner, he reckoned his accounts, and found that he had only\r\n50,000 francs left. Then a strange reaction took place; he who had just\r\nabandoned 5,000,000 endeavored to save the 50,000 francs he had left,\r\nand sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of\r\nprivation—he was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of\r\nmadness.\r\n\r\nHe, who for so long a time had forgotten God, began to think that\r\nmiracles were possible—that the accursed cavern might be discovered by\r\nthe officers of the Papal States, who would release him; that then he\r\nwould have 50,000 remaining, which would be sufficient to save him from\r\nstarvation; and finally he prayed that this sum might be preserved to\r\nhim, and as he prayed he wept. Three days passed thus, during which his\r\nprayers were frequent, if not heartfelt. Sometimes he was delirious,\r\nand fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet; he, also, was\r\ndying of hunger.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth, he was no longer a man, but a living corpse. He had\r\npicked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals, and was\r\nbeginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell. Then\r\nhe entreated Peppino, as he would a guardian angel, to give him food;\r\nhe offered him 1,000 francs for a mouthful of bread. But Peppino did\r\nnot answer. On the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the\r\ncell.\r\n\r\n“Are you not a Christian?” he said, falling on his knees. “Do you wish\r\nto assassinate a man who, in the eyes of Heaven, is a brother? Oh, my\r\nformer friends, my former friends!” he murmured, and fell with his face\r\nto the ground. Then rising in despair, he exclaimed, “The chief, the\r\nchief!”\r\n\r\n“Here I am,” said Vampa, instantly appearing; “what do you want?”\r\n\r\n“Take my last gold,” muttered Danglars, holding out his pocket-book,\r\n“and let me live here; I ask no more for liberty—I only ask to live!”\r\n\r\n“Then you suffer a great deal?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, yes, cruelly!”\r\n\r\n“Still, there have been men who suffered more than you.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think so.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; those who have died of hunger.”\r\n\r\nDanglars thought of the old man whom, in his hours of delirium, he had\r\nseen groaning on his bed. He struck his forehead on the ground and\r\ngroaned. “Yes,” he said, “there have been some who have suffered more\r\nthan I have, but then they must have been martyrs at least.”\r\n\r\n“Do you repent?” asked a deep, solemn voice, which caused Danglars’\r\nhair to stand on end. His feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish\r\nobjects, and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak, half\r\nlost in the shadow of a stone column.\r\n\r\n“Of what must I repent?” stammered Danglars.\r\n\r\n“Of the evil you have done,” said the voice.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; oh, yes, I do indeed repent.” And he struck his breast with\r\nhis emaciated fist.\r\n\r\n“Then I forgive you,” said the man, dropping his cloak, and advancing\r\nto the light.\r\n\r\n“The Count of Monte Cristo!” said Danglars, more pale from terror than\r\nhe had been just before from hunger and misery.\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken—I am not the Count of Monte Cristo.”\r\n\r\n“Then who are you?”\r\n\r\n50261m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I am he whom you sold and dishonored—I am he whose betrothed you\r\nprostituted—I am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise\r\nyourself to fortune—I am he whose father you condemned to die of\r\nhunger—I am he whom you also condemned to starvation, and who yet\r\nforgives you, because he hopes to be forgiven—I am Edmond Dantès!”\r\n\r\nDanglars uttered a cry, and fell prostrate.\r\n\r\n“Rise,” said the count, “your life is safe; the same good fortune has\r\nnot happened to your accomplices—one is mad, the other dead. Keep the\r\n50,000 francs you have left—I give them to you. The 5,000,000 you stole\r\nfrom the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand. And\r\nnow eat and drink; I will entertain you tonight. Vampa, when this man\r\nis satisfied, let him be free.”\r\n\r\nDanglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew; when he raised\r\nhis head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow,\r\nbefore which the bandits bowed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the count’s directions, Danglars was waited on by Vampa,\r\nwho brought him the best wine and fruits of Italy; then, having\r\nconducted him to the road, and pointed to the post-chaise, left him\r\nleaning against a tree. He remained there all night, not knowing where\r\nhe was. When daylight dawned he saw that he was near a stream; he was\r\nthirsty, and dragged himself towards it. As he stooped down to drink,\r\nhe saw that his hair had become entirely white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 117. The Fifth of October\r\n\r\nIt was about six o’clock in the evening; an opal-colored light, through\r\nwhich an autumnal sun shed its golden rays, descended on the blue\r\nocean. The heat of the day had gradually decreased, and a light breeze\r\narose, seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the\r\nburning siesta of the south. A delicious zephyr played along the coasts\r\nof the Mediterranean, and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume\r\nof plants, mingled with the fresh smell of the sea.\r\n\r\nA light yacht, chaste and elegant in its form, was gliding amidst the\r\nfirst dews of night over the immense lake, extending from Gibraltar to\r\nthe Dardanelles, and from Tunis to Venice. The vessel resembled a swan\r\nwith its wings opened towards the wind, gliding on the water. It\r\nadvanced swiftly and gracefully, leaving behind it a glittering stretch\r\nof foam. By degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon; but\r\nas though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen\r\nmythology, its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave,\r\nas if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of Amphitrite, who\r\nin vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle.\r\n\r\nThe yacht moved rapidly on, though there did not appear to be\r\nsufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young girl.\r\nStanding on the prow was a tall man, of a dark complexion, who saw with\r\ndilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the\r\nshape of a cone, which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of\r\na Catalan.\r\n\r\n“Is that Monte Cristo?” asked the traveller, to whose orders the yacht\r\nwas for the time submitted, in a melancholy voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes, your excellency,” said the captain, “we have reached it.”\r\n\r\n“We have reached it!” repeated the traveller in an accent of\r\nindescribable sadness.\r\n\r\nThen he added, in a low tone, “Yes; that is the haven.”\r\n\r\nAnd then he again plunged into a train of thought, the character of\r\nwhich was better revealed by a sad smile, than it would have been by\r\ntears. A few minutes afterwards a flash of light, which was\r\nextinguished instantly, was seen on the land, and the sound of firearms\r\nreached the yacht.\r\n\r\n“Your excellency,” said the captain, “that was the land signal, will\r\nyou answer yourself?”\r\n\r\n“What signal?”\r\n\r\nThe captain pointed towards the island, up the side of which ascended a\r\nvolume of smoke, increasing as it rose.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” he said, as if awaking from a dream. “Give it to me.”\r\n\r\nThe captain gave him a loaded carbine; the traveller slowly raised it,\r\nand fired in the air. Ten minutes afterwards, the sails were furled,\r\nand they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor.\r\nThe gig was already lowered, and in it were four oarsmen and a\r\ncoxswain. The traveller descended, and instead of sitting down at the\r\nstern of the boat, which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his\r\naccommodation, stood up with his arms crossed. The rowers waited, their\r\noars half lifted out of the water, like birds drying their wings.\r\n\r\n50265m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Give way,” said the traveller. The eight oars fell into the sea\r\nsimultaneously without splashing a drop of water, and the boat,\r\nyielding to the impulsion, glided forward. In an instant they found\r\nthemselves in a little harbor, formed in a natural creek; the boat\r\ngrounded on the fine sand.\r\n\r\n“Will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of\r\nour men, they will carry you ashore?” The young man answered this\r\ninvitation with a gesture of indifference, and stepped out of the boat;\r\nthe sea immediately rose to his waist.\r\n\r\n“Ah, your excellency,” murmured the pilot, “you should not have done\r\nso; our master will scold us for it.”\r\n\r\nThe young man continued to advance, following the sailors, who chose a\r\nfirm footing. Thirty strides brought them to dry land; the young man\r\nstamped on the ground to shake off the wet, and looked around for\r\nsomeone to show him his road, for it was quite dark. Just as he turned,\r\na hand rested on his shoulder, and a voice which made him shudder\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Good-evening, Maximilian; you are punctual, thank you!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, is it you, count?” said the young man, in an almost joyful accent,\r\npressing Monte Cristo’s hand with both his own.\r\n\r\n“Yes; you see I am as exact as you are. But you are dripping, my dear\r\nfellow; you must change your clothes, as Calypso said to Telemachus.\r\nCome, I have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon\r\nforget fatigue and cold.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo perceived that the young man had turned around; indeed,\r\nMorrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left\r\nwithout being paid, or uttering a word. Already the sound of their oars\r\nmight be heard as they returned to the yacht.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said the count, “you are looking for the sailors.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I paid them nothing, and yet they are gone.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind that, Maximilian,” said Monte Cristo, smiling. “I have made\r\nan agreement with the navy, that the access to my island shall be free\r\nof all charge. I have made a bargain.”\r\n\r\nMorrel looked at the count with surprise. “Count,” he said, “you are\r\nnot the same here as in Paris.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“Here you laugh.” The count’s brow became clouded.\r\n\r\n“You are right to recall me to myself, Maximilian,” he said; “I was\r\ndelighted to see you again, and forgot for the moment that all\r\nhappiness is fleeting.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no, count,” cried Maximilian, seizing the count’s hands, “pray\r\nlaugh; be happy, and prove to me, by your indifference, that life is\r\nendurable to sufferers. Oh, how charitable, kind, and good you are; you\r\naffect this gayety to inspire me with courage.”\r\n\r\n“You are wrong, Morrel; I was really happy.”\r\n\r\n“Then you forget me, so much the better.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; for as the gladiator said to the emperor, when he entered the\r\narena, ‘He who is about to die salutes you.’”\r\n\r\n“Then you are not consoled?” asked the count, surprised.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” exclaimed Morrel, with a glance full of bitter reproach, “do you\r\nthink it possible that I could be?”\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said the count. “Do you understand the meaning of my words?\r\nYou cannot take me for a commonplace man, a mere rattle, emitting a\r\nvague and senseless noise. When I ask you if you are consoled, I speak\r\nto you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets. Well, Morrel,\r\nlet us both examine the depths of your heart. Do you still feel the\r\nsame feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded\r\nlion? Have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased\r\nin the grave? Are you still actuated by the regret which drags the\r\nliving to the pursuit of death; or are you only suffering from the\r\nprostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred? Has the loss\r\nof memory rendered it impossible for you to weep? Oh, my dear friend,\r\nif this be the case,—if you can no longer weep, if your frozen heart be\r\ndead, if you put all your trust in God, then, Maximilian, you are\r\nconsoled—do not complain.”\r\n\r\n“Count,” said Morrel, in a firm and at the same time soft voice,\r\n“listen to me, as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven, though\r\nhe remains on earth; I come to die in the arms of a friend. Certainly,\r\nthere are people whom I love. I love my sister Julie,—I love her\r\nhusband Emmanuel; but I require a strong mind to smile on my last\r\nmoments. My sister would be bathed in tears and fainting; I could not\r\nbear to see her suffer. Emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand,\r\nand alarm the house with his cries. You, count, who are more than\r\nmortal, will, I am sure, lead me to death by a pleasant path, will you\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n50267m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said the count, “I have still one doubt,—are you weak\r\nenough to pride yourself upon your sufferings?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed,—I am calm,” said Morrel, giving his hand to the count; “my\r\npulse does not beat slower or faster than usual. No, I feel that I have\r\nreached the goal, and I will go no farther. You told me to wait and\r\nhope; do you know what you did, unfortunate adviser? I waited a month,\r\nor rather I suffered for a month! I did hope (man is a poor wretched\r\ncreature), I did hope. What I cannot tell,—something wonderful, an\r\nabsurdity, a miracle,—of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled\r\nwith our reason that folly we call hope. Yes, I did wait—yes, I did\r\nhope, count, and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking\r\ntogether, you have unconsciously wounded, tortured my heart, for every\r\nword you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me. Oh, count,\r\nI shall sleep calmly, deliciously in the arms of death.”\r\n\r\nMorrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count shudder.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” continued Morrel, “you named the fifth of October as the\r\nend of the period of waiting,—today is the fifth of October,” he took\r\nout his watch, “it is now nine o’clock,—I have yet three hours to\r\nlive.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so,” said the count, “come.” Morrel mechanically followed the\r\ncount, and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it. He felt\r\na carpet under his feet, a door opened, perfumes surrounded him, and a\r\nbrilliant light dazzled his eyes. Morrel hesitated to advance; he\r\ndreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw. Monte Cristo drew him\r\nin gently.\r\n\r\n“Why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life,\r\nlike those ancient Romans, who when condemned by Nero, their emperor\r\nand heir, sat down at a table covered with flowers, and gently glided\r\ninto death, amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses?”\r\n\r\nMorrel smiled. “As you please,” he said; “death is always death,—that\r\nis forgetfulness, repose, exclusion from life, and therefore from\r\ngrief.”\r\n\r\nHe sat down, and Monte Cristo placed himself opposite to him. They were\r\nin the marvellous dining-room before described, where the statues had\r\nbaskets on their heads always filled with fruits and flowers. Morrel\r\nhad looked carelessly around, and had probably noticed nothing.\r\n\r\n“Let us talk like men,” he said, looking at the count.\r\n\r\n“Go on!”\r\n\r\n“Count,” said Morrel, “you are the epitome of all human knowledge, and\r\nyou seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world\r\nthan ours.”\r\n\r\n“There is something true in what you say,” said the count, with that\r\nsmile which made him so handsome; “I have descended from a planet\r\ncalled grief.”\r\n\r\n50269m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning; for\r\ninstance, you told me to live, and I did live; you told me to hope, and\r\nI almost did so. I am almost inclined to ask you, as though you had\r\nexperienced death, ‘is it painful to die?’”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo looked upon Morrel with indescribable tenderness. “Yes,”\r\nhe said, “yes, doubtless it is painful, if you violently break the\r\nouter covering which obstinately begs for life. If you plunge a dagger\r\ninto your flesh, if you insinuate a bullet into your brain, which the\r\nleast shock disorders,—then certainly, you will suffer pain, and you\r\nwill repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a\r\nprice.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death, as\r\nwell as in life; the only thing is to understand it.”\r\n\r\n“You have spoken truly, Maximilian; according to the care we bestow\r\nupon it, death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse, or an\r\nenemy who violently drags the soul from the body. Some day, when the\r\nworld is much older, and when mankind will be masters of all the\r\ndestructive powers in nature, to serve for the general good of\r\nhumanity; when mankind, as you were just saying, have discovered the\r\nsecrets of death, then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous\r\nas a slumber in the arms of your beloved.”\r\n\r\n“And if you wished to die, you would choose this death, count?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nMorrel extended his hand. “Now I understand,” he said, “why you had me\r\nbrought here to this desolate spot, in the midst of the ocean, to this\r\nsubterranean palace; it was because you loved me, was it not, count? It\r\nwas because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet\r\nmeans of death of which we were speaking; a death without agony, a\r\ndeath which allows me to fade away while pronouncing Valentine’s name\r\nand pressing your hand.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you have guessed rightly, Morrel,” said the count, “that is what\r\nI intended.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks; the idea that tomorrow I shall no longer suffer, is sweet to\r\nmy heart.”\r\n\r\n“Do you then regret nothing?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Morrel.\r\n\r\n“Not even me?” asked the count with deep emotion. Morrel’s clear eye\r\nwas for the moment clouded, then it shone with unusual lustre, and a\r\nlarge tear rolled down his cheek.\r\n\r\n“What,” said the count, “do you still regret anything in the world, and\r\nyet die?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I entreat you,” exclaimed Morrel in a low voice, “do not speak\r\nanother word, count; do not prolong my punishment.”\r\n\r\nThe count fancied that he was yielding, and this belief revived the\r\nhorrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the Château d’If.\r\n\r\n“I am endeavoring,” he thought, “to make this man happy; I look upon\r\nthis restitution as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil\r\nI have wrought. Now, supposing I am deceived, supposing this man has\r\nnot been unhappy enough to merit happiness. Alas, what would become of\r\nme who can only atone for evil by doing good?”\r\n\r\n50271m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he said aloud: “Listen, Morrel, I see your grief is great, but\r\nstill you do not like to risk your soul.” Morrel smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n“Count,” he said, “I swear to you my soul is no longer my own.”\r\n\r\n“Maximilian, you know I have no relation in the world. I have\r\naccustomed myself to regard you as my son: well, then, to save my son,\r\nI will sacrifice my life, nay, even my fortune.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I mean, that you wish to quit life because you do not understand all\r\nthe enjoyments which are the fruits of a large fortune. Morrel, I\r\npossess nearly a hundred millions and I give them to you; with such a\r\nfortune you can attain every wish. Are you ambitious? Every career is\r\nopen to you. Overturn the world, change its character, yield to mad\r\nideas, be even criminal—but live.”\r\n\r\n“Count, I have your word,” said Morrel coldly; then taking out his\r\nwatch, he added, “It is half-past eleven.”\r\n\r\n“Morrel, can you intend it in my house, under my very eyes?”\r\n\r\n“Then let me go,” said Maximilian, “or I shall think you did not love\r\nme for my own sake, but for yours;” and he arose.\r\n\r\n“It is well,” said Monte Cristo whose countenance brightened at these\r\nwords; “you wish it—you are inflexible. Yes, as you said, you are\r\nindeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you. Sit down, Morrel, and\r\nwait.”\r\n\r\nMorrel obeyed; the count arose, and unlocking a closet with a key\r\nsuspended from his gold chain, took from it a little silver casket,\r\nbeautifully carved and chased, the corners of which represented four\r\nbending figures, similar to the Caryatides, the forms of women, symbols\r\nof the angels aspiring to heaven.\r\n\r\nHe placed the casket on the table; then opening it took out a little\r\ngolden box, the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring.\r\nThis box contained an unctuous substance partly solid, of which it was\r\nimpossible to discover the color, owing to the reflection of the\r\npolished gold, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, which ornamented the box.\r\nIt was a mixed mass of blue, red, and gold.\r\n\r\nThe count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon, and\r\noffered it to Morrel, fixing a long steadfast glance upon him. It was\r\nthen observable that the substance was greenish.\r\n\r\n“This is what you asked for,” he said, “and what I promised to give\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you from the depths of my heart,” said the young man, taking\r\nthe spoon from the hands of Monte Cristo. The count took another spoon,\r\nand again dipped it into the golden box. “What are you going to do, my\r\nfriend?” asked Morrel, arresting his hand.\r\n\r\n“Well, the fact is, Morrel, I was thinking that I too am weary of life,\r\nand since an opportunity presents itself——”\r\n\r\n“Stay!” said the young man. “You who love, and are beloved; you, who\r\nhave faith and hope,—oh, do not follow my example. In your case it\r\nwould be a crime. Adieu, my noble and generous friend, adieu; I will go\r\nand tell Valentine what you have done for me.”\r\n\r\nAnd slowly, though without any hesitation, only waiting to press the\r\ncount’s hand fervently, he swallowed the mysterious substance offered\r\nby Monte Cristo. Then they were both silent. Ali, mute and attentive,\r\nbrought the pipes and coffee, and disappeared. By degrees, the light of\r\nthe lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held\r\nthem, and the perfumes appeared less powerful to Morrel. Seated\r\nopposite to him, Monte Cristo watched him in the shadow, and Morrel saw\r\nnothing but the bright eyes of the count. An overpowering sadness took\r\npossession of the young man, his hands relaxed their hold, the objects\r\nin the room gradually lost their form and color, and his disturbed\r\nvision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall.\r\n\r\n50273m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Friend,” he cried, “I feel that I am dying; thanks!”\r\n\r\nHe made a last effort to extend his hand, but it fell powerless beside\r\nhim. Then it appeared to him that Monte Cristo smiled, not with the\r\nstrange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the\r\nsecrets of his heart, but with the benevolent kindness of a father for\r\na child. At the same time the count appeared to increase in stature,\r\nhis form, nearly double its usual height, stood out in relief against\r\nthe red tapestry, his black hair was thrown back, and he stood in the\r\nattitude of an avenging angel. Morrel, overpowered, turned around in\r\nthe armchair; a delicious torpor permeated every vein. A change of\r\nideas presented themselves to his brain, like a new design on the\r\nkaleidoscope. Enervated, prostrate, and breathless, he became\r\nunconscious of outward objects; he seemed to be entering that vague\r\ndelirium preceding death. He wished once again to press the count’s\r\nhand, but his own was immovable. He wished to articulate a last\r\nfarewell, but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat, like a\r\nstone at the mouth of a sepulchre. Involuntarily his languid eyes\r\nclosed, and still through his eyelashes a well-known form seemed to\r\nmove amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped.\r\n\r\nThe count had just opened a door. Immediately a brilliant light from\r\nthe next room, or rather from the palace adjoining, shone upon the room\r\nin which he was gently gliding into his last sleep. Then he saw a woman\r\nof marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the\r\ntwo rooms. Pale, and sweetly smiling, she looked like an angel of mercy\r\nconjuring the angel of vengeance.\r\n\r\n“Is it heaven that opens before me?” thought the dying man; “that angel\r\nresembles the one I have lost.”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo pointed out Morrel to the young woman, who advanced\r\ntowards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips.\r\n\r\n“Valentine, Valentine!” he mentally ejaculated; but his lips uttered no\r\nsound, and as though all his strength were centred in that internal\r\nemotion, he sighed and closed his eyes. Valentine rushed towards him;\r\nhis lips again moved.\r\n\r\n“He is calling you,” said the count; “he to whom you have confided your\r\ndestiny—he from whom death would have separated you, calls you to him.\r\nHappily, I vanquished death. Henceforth, Valentine, you will never\r\nagain be separated on earth, since he has rushed into death to find\r\nyou. Without me, you would both have died. May God accept my atonement\r\nin the preservation of these two existences!”\r\n\r\nValentine seized the count’s hand, and in her irresistible impulse of\r\njoy carried it to her lips.\r\n\r\n50275m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank me again!” said the count; “tell me till you are weary, that\r\nI have restored you to happiness; you do not know how much I require\r\nthis assurance.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, yes, I thank you with all my heart,” said Valentine; “and if\r\nyou doubt the sincerity of my gratitude, oh, then, ask Haydée! ask my\r\nbeloved sister Haydée, who ever since our departure from France, has\r\ncaused me to wait patiently for this happy day, while talking to me of\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“You then love Haydée?” asked Monte Cristo with an emotion he in vain\r\nendeavored to dissimulate.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, with all my soul.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, listen, Valentine,” said the count; “I have a favor to ask\r\nof you.”\r\n\r\n“Of me? Oh, am I happy enough for that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; you have called Haydée your sister,—let her become so indeed,\r\nValentine; render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me;\r\nprotect her, for” (the count’s voice was thick with emotion)\r\n“henceforth she will be alone in the world.”\r\n\r\n“Alone in the world!” repeated a voice behind the count, “and why?”\r\n\r\nMonte Cristo turned around; Haydée was standing pale, motionless,\r\nlooking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement.\r\n\r\n“Because tomorrow, Haydée, you will be free; you will then assume your\r\nproper position in society, for I will not allow my destiny to\r\novershadow yours. Daughter of a prince, I restore to you the riches and\r\nname of your father.”\r\n\r\nHaydée became pale, and lifting her transparent hands to heaven,\r\nexclaimed in a voice stifled with tears, “Then you leave me, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“Haydée, Haydée, you are young and beautiful; forget even my name, and\r\nbe happy.”\r\n\r\n“It is well,” said Haydée; “your order shall be executed, my lord; I\r\nwill forget even your name, and be happy.” And she stepped back to\r\nretire.\r\n\r\n“Oh, heavens,” exclaimed Valentine, who was supporting the head of\r\nMorrel on her shoulder, “do you not see how pale she is? Do you not see\r\nhow she suffers?”\r\n\r\nHaydée answered with a heartrending expression,\r\n\r\n“Why should he understand this, my sister? He is my master, and I am\r\nhis slave; he has the right to notice nothing.”\r\n\r\nThe count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost\r\nrecesses of his heart; his eyes met those of the young girl and he\r\ncould not bear their brilliancy.\r\n\r\n“Oh, heavens,” exclaimed Monte Cristo, “can my suspicions be correct?\r\nHaydée, would it please you not to leave me?”\r\n\r\n“I am young,” gently replied Haydée; “I love the life you have made so\r\nsweet to me, and I should be sorry to die.”\r\n\r\n“You mean, then, that if I leave you, Haydée——”\r\n\r\n“I should die; yes, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Do you then love me?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Valentine, he asks if I love him. Valentine, tell him if you love\r\nMaximilian.”\r\n\r\nThe count felt his heart dilate and throb; he opened his arms, and\r\nHaydée, uttering a cry, sprang into them.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” she cried, “I do love you! I love you as one loves a father,\r\nbrother, husband! I love you as my life, for you are the best, the\r\nnoblest of created beings!”\r\n\r\n50277m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Let it be, then, as you wish, sweet angel; God has sustained me in my\r\nstruggle with my enemies, and has given me this reward; he will not let\r\nme end my triumph in suffering; I wished to punish myself, but he has\r\npardoned me. Love me then, Haydée! Who knows? perhaps your love will\r\nmake me forget all that I do not wish to remember.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“I mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty\r\nyears of slow experience; I have but you in the world, Haydée; through\r\nyou I again take hold on life, through you I shall suffer, through you\r\nrejoice.”\r\n\r\n“Do you hear him, Valentine?” exclaimed Haydée; “he says that through\r\nme he will suffer—through _me_, who would yield my life for his.”\r\n\r\nThe count withdrew for a moment. “Have I discovered the truth?” he\r\nsaid; “but whether it be for recompense or punishment, I accept my\r\nfate. Come, Haydée, come!” and throwing his arm around the young girl’s\r\nwaist, he pressed the hand of Valentine, and disappeared.\r\n\r\n50279m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour had nearly passed, during which Valentine, breathless and\r\nmotionless, watched steadfastly over Morrel. At length she felt his\r\nheart beat, a faint breath played upon his lips, a slight shudder,\r\nannouncing the return of life, passed through the young man’s frame. At\r\nlength his eyes opened, but they were at first fixed and\r\nexpressionless; then sight returned, and with it feeling and grief.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” he cried, in an accent of despair, “the count has deceived me; I\r\nam yet living;” and extending his hand towards the table, he seized a\r\nknife.\r\n\r\n“Dearest,” exclaimed Valentine, with her adorable smile, “awake, and\r\nlook at me!” Morrel uttered a loud exclamation, and frantic, doubtful,\r\ndazzled, as though by a celestial vision, he fell upon his knees.\r\n\r\nThe next morning at daybreak, Valentine and Morrel were walking\r\narm-in-arm on the seashore, Valentine relating how Monte Cristo had\r\nappeared in her room, explained everything, revealed the crime, and,\r\nfinally, how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death.\r\n\r\nThey had found the door of the grotto opened, and gone forth; on the\r\nazure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars.\r\n\r\nMorrel soon perceived a man standing among the rocks, apparently\r\nawaiting a sign from them to advance, and pointed him out to Valentine.\r\n\r\n“Ah, it is Jacopo,” she said, “the captain of the yacht;” and she\r\nbeckoned him towards them.\r\n\r\n“Do you wish to speak to us?” asked Morrel.\r\n\r\n“I have a letter to give you from the count.”\r\n\r\n“From the count!” murmured the two young people.\r\n\r\n“Yes; read it.”\r\n\r\n50281m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMorrel opened the letter, and read:\r\n\r\n“My Dear Maximilian,\r\n\r\n“There is a felucca for you at anchor. Jacopo will carry you to\r\nLeghorn, where Monsieur Noirtier awaits his granddaughter, whom he\r\nwishes to bless before you lead her to the altar. All that is in this\r\ngrotto, my friend, my house in the Champs-Élysées, and my château at\r\nTréport, are the marriage gifts bestowed by Edmond Dantès upon the son\r\nof his old master, Morrel. Mademoiselle de Villefort will share them\r\nwith you; for I entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune\r\nreverting to her from her father, now a madman, and her brother who\r\ndied last September with his mother. Tell the angel who will watch over\r\nyour future destiny, Morrel, to pray sometimes for a man, who, like\r\nSatan, thought himself for an instant equal to God, but who now\r\nacknowledges with Christian humility that God alone possesses supreme\r\npower and infinite wisdom. Perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse\r\nhe feels in his heart. As for you, Morrel, this is the secret of my\r\nconduct towards you. There is neither happiness nor misery in the\r\nworld; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing\r\nmore. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience\r\nsupreme happiness. We must have felt what it is to die, Morrel, that we\r\nmay appreciate the enjoyments of living.\r\n\r\n“Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never\r\nforget that until the day when God shall deign to reveal the future to\r\nman, all human wisdom is summed up in these two words,—‘_Wait and\r\nhope_.’—Your friend,\r\n\r\n“Edmond Dantès, _Count of Monte Cristo_.”\r\n\r\n50282m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the perusal of this letter, which informed Valentine for the\r\nfirst time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother,\r\nshe became pale, a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom, and tears, not\r\nthe less painful because they were silent, ran down her cheeks; her\r\nhappiness cost her very dear.\r\n\r\nMorrel looked around uneasily.\r\n\r\n“But,” he said, “the count’s generosity is too overwhelming; Valentine\r\nwill be satisfied with my humble fortune. Where is the count, friend?\r\nLead me to him.”\r\n\r\nJacopo pointed towards the horizon.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked Valentine. “Where is the count?—where is\r\nHaydée?”\r\n\r\n“Look!” said Jacopo.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor, and\r\non the blue line separating the sky from the Mediterranean Sea, they\r\nperceived a large white sail.\r\n\r\n“Gone,” said Morrel; “gone!—adieu, my friend—adieu, my father!”\r\n\r\n“Gone,” murmured Valentine; “adieu, my sweet Haydée—adieu, my sister!”\r\n\r\n“Who can say whether we shall ever see them again?” said Morrel with\r\ntearful eyes.\r\n\r\n“Darling,” replied Valentine, “has not the count just told us that all\r\nhuman wisdom is summed up in two words:\r\n\r\n“‘_Wait and hope_ (Fac et spera)!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] “The wicked are great drinkers of water; As the flood proved once\r\nfor all.”\r\n\r\n[2] $2,600,000 in 1894.\r\n\r\n[3] Knocked on the head.\r\n\r\n[4] Beheaded.\r\n\r\n[5] Scott, of course: “The son of an ill-fated sire, and the father of\r\na yet more unfortunate family, bore in his looks that cast of\r\ninauspicious melancholy by which the physiognomists of that time\r\npretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and\r\nunhappy death.”—The Abbot, ch. xxii.\r\n\r\n[6] Guillotine.\r\n\r\n[7] Dr. Guillotin got the idea of his famous machine from witnessing an\r\nexecution in Italy.\r\n\r\n[8] Brucea ferruginea.\r\n\r\n[9] ‘Money and sanctity, Each in a moiety.’\r\n\r\n[10] Elisabeth de Rossan, Marquise de Ganges, was one of the famous\r\nwomen of the court of Louis XIV. where she was known as “La Belle\r\nProvençale.” She was the widow of the Marquis de Castellane when she\r\nmarried de Ganges, and having the misfortune to excite the enmity of\r\nher new brothers-in-law, was forced by them to take poison; and they\r\nfinished her off with pistol and dagger.—Ed.\r\n\r\n[11] Magistrate and orator of great eloquence—chancellor of France\r\nunder Louis XV.\r\n\r\n[12] Jacques-Louis David, a famous French painter (1748-1825).\r\n\r\n[13] Ali Pasha, “The Lion,” was born at Tepelini, an Albanian village\r\nat the foot of the Klissoura Mountains, in 1741.
