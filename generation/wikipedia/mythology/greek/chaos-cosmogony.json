  "extract": "In the context of religious cosmogony, Chaos (Ancient Greek: χάος, romanized: kháos) refers to the division of reality outside or in contrast to the ordered cosmos. As such it refers to a state, place, or time beyond the known, familiar, and reliable world, often said to be inhabited by strange, ominous, or demonic beings.\nAccording to the creation of the universe (the cosmos) in early Greek cosmology, Chaos was the first being to exist.\n\n\nEtymology\nGreek kháos (χάος) means 'emptiness, vast void, chasm, abyss', related to the verbs kháskō (χάσκω) and khaínō (χαίνω) 'gape, be wide open', from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰeh₂n-, cognate to Old English geanian, 'to gape', whence English yawn.\nIt may also mean space, the expanse of air, the nether abyss, or infinite darkness. Pherecydes of Syros (fl. 6th century BC) interprets chaos as water, like something formless that can be differentiated.\n\n\nGreco-Roman tradition\n\nHesiod and the pre-Socratics use the Greek term in the context of cosmogony. Hesiod's Chaos has been interpreted as either \"the gaping void above the Earth created when Earth and Sky are separated from their primordial unity\" or \"the gaping space below the Earth on which Earth rests\". Passages in Hesiod's Theogony suggest that Chaos was located below Earth but above Tartarus. Primal Chaos was sometimes said to be the true foundation of reality, particularly by philosophers such as Heraclitus.\n\n\nEarly Greece\n\nIn Hesiod's Theogony, Chaos was the first thing to exist: \"at first Chaos came to be\" (or was), but next (possibly out of Chaos) came Gaia, Tartarus, and Eros (elsewhere the name Eros is used for a son of Aphrodite). Unambiguously \"born\" from Chaos were Erebus and Nyx. For Hesiod, Chaos, like Tartarus, though personified enough to have borne children, was also a place, far away, underground and \"gloomy\", beyond which lived the Titans; and, like the earth, the ocean, and the upper air, it was also capable of being affected by Zeus's thunderbolts.\nThe notion of the temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality. The main object of the first efforts to explain the world remained the description of its growth, from a beginning. They believed that the world arose out from a primal unity, and that this substance was the permanent base of all its being. Anaximander claims that the origin is apeiron (the unlimited), a divine and perpetual substance less definite than the common elements (water, air, fire, and earth) as they were understood to the early Greek philosophers. Everything is generated from apeiron, and must return there according to necessity. A conception of the nature of the world was that the earth below its surface stretches down indefinitely and has its roots on or above Tartarus, the lower part of the underworld. In a phrase of Xenophanes, \"The upper limit of the earth borders on air, near our feet. The lower limit reaches down to the \"apeiron\" (i.e. the unlimited).\" The sources and limits of the earth, the sea, the sky, Tartarus, and all things are located in a great windy-gap, which seems to be infinite, and is a later specification of \"chaos\".\n\n\nClassical Greece\nIn Aristophanes's comedy Birds, first there was Chaos, Night, Erebus, and Tartarus, from Night came Eros, and from Eros and Chaos came the race of birds.\n\nAt the beginning there was only Chaos, Night, dark Erebus, and deep Tartarus. Earth, the air and heaven had no existence. Firstly, blackwinged Night laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebus, and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep Tartarus with dark Chaos, winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race, which was the first to see the light. That of the Immortals did not exist until Eros had brought together all the ingredients of the world, and from their marriage Heaven, Ocean, Earth, and the imperishable race of blessed gods sprang into being. Thus our origin is very much older than that of the dwellers in Olympus. We [birds] are the offspring of Eros; there are a thousand proofs to show it. We have wings and we lend assistance to lovers. How many handsome youths, who had sworn to remain insensible, have opened their thighs because of our power and have yielded themselves to their lovers when almost at the end of their youth, being led away by the gift of a quail, a waterfowl, a goose, or a cock.\nIn Plato's Timaeus, the main work of Platonic cosmology, the concept of chaos finds its equivalent in the Greek expression chôra, which is interpreted, for instance, as shapeless space (chôra) in which material traces (ichnê) of the elements are in disordered motion (Timaeus 53a–b). However, the Platonic chôra is not a variation of the atomistic interpretation of the origin of the world, as is made clear by Plato's statement that the most appropriate definition of the chôra is \"a receptacle of all becoming – its wetnurse, as it were\" (Timaeus 49a), notabene a receptacle for the creative act of the demiurge, the world-maker.\nAristotle, in the context of his investigation of the concept of space in physics, \"problematizes the interpretation of Hesiod's chaos as 'void' or 'place without anything in it'. Aristotle understands chaos as something that exists independently of bodies and without which no perceptible bodies can exist. 'Chaos' is thus brought within the framework of an explicitly physical investigation. It has now outgrown the mythological understanding to a great extent and, in Aristotle's work, serves above all to challenge the atomists who assert the existence of empty space.\"\n\n\nRoman tradition\nFor Ovid, (43 BC – 17/18 AD), in his Metamorphoses, Chaos was an unformed mass, where all the elements were jumbled up together in a \"shapeless heap\".\n\nAccording to the Fabulae (c. 2nd century AD), attributed to Hyginus: \"From Mist (Caligo) came Chaos. From Chaos and Mist, came Night (Nox), Day (Dies), Darkness (Erebus), and Aether.\" An Orphic tradition apparently had Chaos as the son of Chronus and Ananke.\n\n\nOld Testament studies\n\nSince the classic 1895 German work Schöpfung und Chaos in Urzeit und Endzeit by Hermann Gunkel, various historians in the field of modern biblical studies have associated the theme of chaos in the earlier Babylonian cosmology with the Genesis creation narrative. One locus of focus has been with respect to the term abyss / tohu wa-bohu in Genesis 1:2. The term may refer to a state of non-being before creation or to a formless state. In the Book of Genesis, the spirit of God is moving upon the face of the waters, displacing the earlier state of the universe that is likened to a \"watery chaos\" upon which there is choshek (which translated from the Hebrew is darkness/confusion). This model of a primordial state of matter has been opposed by the Church Fathers from the 2nd century, who posited a creation ex nihilo by an omnipotent God.\nSome scholars, however, reject the association between biblical creation and notions of chaos from Babylonian myths. The basis is that the terms themselves in Genesis 1:2 are not semantically related to chaos, and that the entire cosmos exists in a state of chaos in Babylonian myth, whereas at most this can be said of the earth in Genesis. The Septuagint makes no use of χάος in the context of creation, instead using the term for גיא, \"cleft, gorge, chasm\", in Micah 1:6 and Zachariah 14:4. The Vulgate, however, renders the χάσμα μέγα or \"great gulf\" between heaven and hell in Luke 16:26 as chaos magnum.\n\n\nGnosticism\nAccording to the Gnostic On the Origin of the World (late 3rd century AD?), Chaos was not the first thing to exist. When the nature of the immortal aeons was completed, Sophia desired something like the light which first existed to come into being. Her desire appears as a likeness with incomprehensible greatness that covers the heavenly universe, diminishing its inner darkness while a shadow appears on the outside which causes Chaos to be formed. From Chaos, every deity including the Demiurge is born.\n\n\nHermeticism and alchemy\n\nThe Greco-Roman tradition of prima materia, notably including the 5th- and 6th-century Orphic cosmogony, was merged with biblical notions (Tehom) in Christianity and inherited by alchemy and Renaissance magic.\nThe cosmic egg of Orphism was taken as the raw material for the alchemical magnum opus in early Greek alchemy. The first stage of the process of producing the philosopher's stone, i.e., nigredo, was identified with chaos. Because of association with the Genesis creation narrative, where \"the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters\" (Gen. 1:2), Chaos was further identified with the classical element of Water.\nRamon Llull (1232–1315) wrote a Liber Chaos, in which he identifies Chaos as the primal form or matter created by God. Swiss alchemist Paracelsus (1493–1541) uses chaos synonymously with \"classical element\" (because the primeval chaos is imagined as a formless congestion of all elements). Paracelsus thus identifies Earth as \"the chaos of the gnomi\", i.e., the element of the gnomes, through which these spirits move unobstructed as fish do through water, or birds through air. An alchemical treatise by Heinrich Khunrath, printed in Frankfurt in 1708, was entitled Chaos. The 1708 introduction states that the treatise was written in 1597 in Magdeburg, in the author's 23rd year of practicing alchemy. The treatise purports to quote Paracelsus on the point that \"[t]he light of the soul, by the will of the Triune God, made all earthly things appear from the primal Chaos\". Martin Ruland the Younger, in his 1612 Lexicon Alchemiae, states, \"A crude mixture of matter or another name for Materia Prima is Chaos, as it is in the Beginning.\"\nThe term gas in chemistry was coined by Dutch chemist Jan Baptist van Helmont in the 17th century directly based on the Paracelsian notion of chaos. The g in gas is due to the Dutch pronunciation of this letter as a spirant, also employed to pronounce Greek χ.\n\n\nHawaiian tradition\nIn Hawaiian folklore, a triad of deities known as the \"Ku-Kaua-Kahi\" (a.k.a. \"Fundamental Supreme Unity\") were said to have existed before and during Chaos ever since eternity, or put in Hawaiian terms, mai ka po mai, meaning \"from the time of night, darkness, Chaos\". They eventually broke the surrounding Po (\"night\"), and light entered the universe. Next the group created three heavens for dwelling areas together with the Earth, Sun, Moon, stars, and assistant spirits.\n\n\nModern usage\nThe term chaos has been adopted in modern comparative mythology and religious studies as referring to the primordial state before creation, strictly combining two separate notions of primordial waters or a primordial darkness from which a new order emerges and a primordial state as a merging of opposites, such as heaven and earth, which must be separated by a creator deity in an act of cosmogony. In both cases, chaos referring to a notion of a primordial state contains the cosmos in potentia but needs to be formed by a demiurge before the world can begin its existence.\nThe use of chaos in the derived sense of \"complete disorder or confusion\" first appears in Elizabethan Early Modern English, originally implying satirical exaggeration. \"Chaos\" in the well-defined sense of chaotic complex system is in turn derived from this usage.\n\n\nSee also\nAbzu – Primeval sea in Mesopotamian mythology\nGinnungagap – Primordial void mentioned in the Gylfaginning\nGreek primordial deities – First generation of deities in Greek mythology\nHundun – Primordial and central chaos in Chinese cosmogony\nNu – Ancient Egyptian personification of the primordial watery abyssPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nŚūnya and śūnyatā in Hindu and Buddhist religions\nTiamat – Primordial goddess of ancient Babylon religion\nTohu va bohu – In the Genesis creation narrative, the earth's condition immediately before light's creationPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nThe Void – Philosophical concept of emptiness\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading",
