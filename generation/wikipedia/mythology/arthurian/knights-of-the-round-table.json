  "extract": "The Knights of the Round Table (French: Chevaliers de la Table Ronde) are the legendary knights of the fellowship of King Arthur that first appeared in the French-language Matter of Britain literature in the mid-12th century. The Knights are a chivalric order dedicated to ensuring the peace of Arthur's kingdom following an early warring period, entrusted in later years to undergo a mystical quest for the Holy Grail. The Round Table at which they meet is a symbol of the equality of its members, who range from sovereign royals to minor nobles.\nThe various Round Table stories present an assortment of knights from all over Great Britain and abroad, some of whom are even from outside of Europe. Their ranks often include Arthur's close and distant relatives, such as Agravain, Gaheris and Yvain, as well as his reconciled former enemies, like Galehaut, Pellinore and Lot. Several of the most notable Knights of the Round Table, among them Bedivere, Gawain and Kay, are based on older characters from a host of great warriors associated with Arthur in the early Welsh tales. Some, such as Lancelot, Perceval and Tristan, feature in the roles of a protagonist or eponymous hero in various works of chivalric romance. Other well-known members of the Round Table include the holy knight Galahad, replacing Perceval as the main Grail Knight in the later stories, and Arthur's traitorous son and nemesis Mordred. \nThe first written record of the Knights of the Round Table is found in the Roman de Brut, written by the Norman author Wace in 1155. At the end of the 12th century, works of chivalric romance by Chrétien de Troyes had a major influence on the spread of the Arthurian legend while introducing many of the later popular Round Table heroes to French and international audiences. In the 13th-century Arthurian prose cycles, including their seminal compilation Le Morte d'Arthur, the Round Table eventually splits up into groups of warring factions following the revelation of Lancelot's adultery with King Arthur's wife, Queen Guinevere. In the same tradition, Guinevere is featured with her own personal order of young knights, known as the Queen's Knights. Some texts also tell of one or two other minor tables, intended for the lesser knights of Arthur, and of the precedent Knights of the Old Table, once led by Arthur's father, Uther Pendragon. A story introduced by Robert de Boron around 1200 focuses on the much earlier members of the 'Grail Table'—followers of ancient Christian Joseph of Arimathea, who centuries later would serve as the template for Uther's and Arthur's orders following Merlin's creation of the Round Table.\n\n\nNumbers of members\n\nThe number of the Knights of the Round Table (including King Arthur) and their names vary greatly between the versions published by different writers. The figure may range from a dozen to as many as potentially 1,600 (the number of seats at the table), the latter claimed by Layamon in his Brut. Most commonly, however, there are between about 100 and 300 seats at the table, often with one seat permanently empty. The number of three hundred was also chosen by King Edward III of England when he decided to create his own real-life Order of the Round Table at Windsor Castle in 1344.\nIn many chivalric romances there are over 100 members of Arthur's Round Table, as with either 140 or 150 according to Thomas Malory's popular Le Morte d'Arthur, and about 140 according to Erec by Hartmann von Aue. Some sources offer much smaller numbers, such as 13 in the Didot Perceval and 60 in the count by Jean d'Outremeuse in his Ly Myreur des Histors. Others yet give higher numbers, as with 250 in the Prose Merlin, and 366 in both Li Chevaliers as Deus Espees and Perlesvaus (where this is their peak number that nevertheless had dwindled to only about 25 at the time when the story begins).\nChrétien de Troyes suggested around 500 knights in his early romance Erec and Enide. In the same work, Chrétien catalogued many of Arthur's top knights in a series of long hierarchical lists of names. These rankings are different in each of the surviving manuscripts, none of which is believed to be the author's original version.\nWhile not mentioning the Round Table as such, one of the late Welsh Triads lists 24 extraordinary knights permanently living in Arthur's court, mixing romance characters with several Arthur's warriors from a largely lost Welsh tradition considered to originate in old Celtic folklore. Companions of Arthur numbering 24 also appear in the Welsh tale of Peredur son of Efrawg.\n\n\nPartial lists\n\n\nSelect members\nSome of the more notable knights include the following: \n\n\nSir Urry list\nIn addition, there are many less prominent knights. For instance, the \"Healing of Sir Urry\" episode in the Winchester Manuscript of Le Morte d'Arthur lists, in addition to many of the mentioned above, the following:\n\n\nWinchester Castle list\nConversely, the Winchester Round Table features only Sir Alynore (Alymere), Sir Bedwere (Bedivere), Sir Blubrys (Bleoberis), Sir Bors Deganys (Bors de Ganis), Sir Brumear (Brunor le Noir), Sir Dagonet, Sir Degore, Sir Ectorde Marys (Ector de Maris), Sir Galahallt (Galahault or Galahad), Sir Garethe (Gareth), Sir Gauen (Gawain), Sir Kay, Sir Lamorak, Sir Launcelot Deulake (Lancelot du Lac), Sir Lacotemale Tayle (La Cote Male Taile), Sir Lucane (Lucan), Sir Lybyus Dysconyus (Le Bel Desconneu), Sir Lyonell (Lionel), Sir Mordrede (Mordred), Sir Plomyde (Palomedes), Sir Pelleus (Pelleas), Sir Percyvale (Percival), Sir Safer (Safir), and Sir Trystram Delyens (Tristram de Lyones), for the total of merely 24 (not counting Arthur).\n\n\nMajor knights\n\n\nAglovale\n\nAglovale is a character introduced in the Vulgate Lancelot as Agloval de Galis (Aglovan, Aglovaus; -de Galles), that is \"of Wales\". He is the eldest legitimate son of King Pellinore of Listenois. Like his father and his brothers, who may prominently include Drian, Lamorak, Perceval, and Tor, he is a Knight of the Round Table. \nIn the Post-Vulgate Cycle (as Agloval), and Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (as Aglovale but also Agglovale or Aglovayle; a modern rendering Aglaval was popularised by Howard Pyle), he is the one who brings his long lost brother Perceval to Camelot in order to be knighted, having met him by chance in the woods of Wales. In an alternative account in the Livre d'Artus version of the Vulgate Merlin, the young Agloval has all of his fourteen brothers killed during the Saxon wars by the forces of King Rions' relative King Agrippa in their attack on his mother's domain. He accompanies Gawain and Sagramore in leading an army that defeats the invaders, personally slaying Agrippa but suffering severe wounds.\n\nIn the Third (Manessier's) Continuation of Perceval, the Story of the Grail, Agloval dies seven years after Perceval became the Grail King, causing Perceval's retirement to a hermitage to grieve for his final ten years. In the Vulgate Cycle, Agloval dies accidentally at Gawain's hand during the Quest for the Holy Grail. However, the rewrite in the Post-Vulgate Queste turns it into a deliberate murder, a part of the Orkney clan's long vendetta for the death of King Lot. In Malory, Aglovale is among the knights charged by King Arthur with defending the execution of Guinevere, and is killed by unknown hand during the bloody melee when Lancelot and his men rescue the queen.\n\nAs Acglavael, he features prominently as the father of the hero of the Dutch romance Moriaen, in which visits Moorish lands in Africa and meets a black Christian princess whom he conceives a child with. He returns home and, thirteen years later, his son Morien comes to find him after which they both return to Morien's lands. In modern works, Aglovale is the eponymous protagonist of Clemence Housman's 1905 novel The Life of Sir Aglovale de Galis. \n\n\nArthur the Less\n\nArthur the Less or Arthur the Little (Arthur le Petit) is an illegitimate son of King Arthur (\"Arthur the Great\") found only in the Post-Vulgate Cycle. After Arthur forces himself on a daughter of a knight named Tanas, he orders the child to be named either Guenevere or Arthur the Less. Having been abandoned and raised by a foster mother, the boy appears at Arthur's court on the eve of the Grail Quest when his arrival is miraculously prophesied at the Round Table. He is knighted by Tristan and soon proves to be superior to even Gawain and Perceval, defeating both of them. However, he is publicly known only as the Unknown Knight, keeping his lineage secret as to not shame his father with the story of his mother's rape. Loyal to King Arthur (who is eventually informed about his son's identity by Morgan), he fights in the late wars against domestic and foreign enemies, and is one of Galahad's companions during the Grail Quest. After his father's death at Salisbury, Arthur the Less is a candidate for the heir of throne of Logres, however, he obsessively hates Lancelot's renegade faction, blaming them for the disaster. When soon defeated by Bleoberis in a duel to the death, he curses the entire kingdom in his dying breath. His curse manifests itself through King Mark's devastating invasion which destroys almost all remnants of King Arthur's rule. \n\n\nBleoberis\n\nBleoberis de Ganis is a Knight of the Round Table from the land of Ganis (variants Gan[n]es, Gannis, Gaun[n]es, Gan[n]ys), the place name regarded to mean Vannes in Brittany but usually translated as Gaul by Thomas Malory elsewhere in his version. His name may have been derived from the 12th-century Welsh storyteller known in French as Bledhericus, Bleheris or Blihis (Blihos) Bliheris (possibly Bledri ap Cydifor), who is mentioned in several texts, including being credited by both Thomas of Britain and Wauchier de Denain as the original source of their early Arthurian poems. References to the narrative authority of one Master Blihis (Maistre Blihis) repeat throughout the Elucidation, wherein the character named Blihos Bliheris also appears as knight.\nHe was first mentioned by Chrétien de Troyes in Erec and Enide as Bliobleheris (Wendelin Foerster's choice rendering; other manuscript variants Bleob[l]eris, Bleosblieris, Blioberis, Bliobeheri, Blios Blieris). He has since appeared by a large number of variations of his name and character in many works, including as Bleobleheris (Bliobliheri) and Bleheris in respectively the First and the Second Continuation of Chrétien's Perceval; as two different characters named Bleheris and Blidoblidas in Mériadeuc; as split between Bleherris and Bleoberiis in Of Arthour and of Merlin; as Bleoris in Henry Lovelich's Merlin; as Bleos von Bliriers in Diu Crône; as Bleriz in Povest' o Tryshchane; as Bliobleherin in the German Chrétien translation Erec; as Bliobleeris in La Vengeance Raguidel; as Blioblieris in Le Bel Inconnu and Wigalois; as Bréri in Tristan by Thomas of Britain; as Briobris in La Tavola Ritonda; as Pleherin in Tristrant; and as Plihopliherî (Plihophiheri, Plihopliheri) in Parzival.\nAs Bliobleris de Gannes (Biblioberis, Bla[h]aris, Bleob[l]eris, Bleobleheris, Bleosblieris, Bliaires, Blihoble[h]eris, Bliobeheri, Blioberis, Blyob[l]eris; -de Ga[u]n[n]es), he features as a major character in the romances from the French prose cycles and their adaptations, in which he is portrayed as one of the cousins of the hero Lancelot. There he is son of Nestor de Gaunes and godson of Lancelot's father King Bors, as well as brother of his fellow Round Table companion, Blamour[e] (Blamor[e], Blanor[e]). In the Vulgate Merlin, the Livre d'Artus, and Arthour and Merlin, Bleoberis fights alongside his brother in the wars against the rebel kings at Bedegraine, against the Saxons at Cameliard, and against King Claudas in the Wasteland; the latter earns him his nickname \"of the Wasteland\" (de la Deserte). In both the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate versions of the Queste, as well as in the Prose Tristan, he participates in the Grail Quest. In Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, Bleoberys de Ganis (Bleoberis, Bleoboris, Bleoheris; -de Gaynys) is described as the lord of the Castle of Ganis (Ganys), apparently in Britain.\nIn the Vulgate Cycle and the works based on it, Lancelot eventually makes him the Duke of Poitiers for his part in saving Guinevere, after which Bleoberis becomes an important leader in Lancelot's war against Arthur and Gawain. In the Post-Vulgate Mort, he returns to Britain and arrives at Salisbury after the battle to destroy the corpse of Mordred and build the Tower of the Dead. While searching for Lancelot, he meets Arthur's vengeful son Arthur the Less (himself a member of the Round Table as the Unknown Knight), whom he kills in self-defence. Finding Lancelot at a hermitage with the former Archbishop of Canterbury, he joins them together with his brother. After Lancelot's death, Bleoberis buries his body at Joyous Gard and then, along with the other knights turned monks, he undertakes a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. In Malory's ending, following the presumed death of Arthur, Bleoberys and his brother Blamo[u]re (Blamor) live as monks together with Lancelot and the rest of their kinsmen at Glastonbury Tor, before eventually (after Lancelot's death) leaving on a crusade where they all die in a battle against the Turks at Jerusalem.\n\nHe also appears in some tales as an opponent whom the story's hero must overcome during the course of a quest or an adventure. In the Prose Tristan, Bleoberis abducts Segwarides' wife from King Mark's court, and fights for her against first Segwarides and later the protagonist Tristan. In Wigalois, one of the challenges faced by the protagonist Wigalois (Gawain's son, Gingalain) is to defeat Bleoberis, the fierce guardian of the Perilous Ford. He is similarly the first adversary conquered by Gawain's son Guinglan in Le Bel Inconnu. In Parzival, Orgeluse's suitor boasts of having him either slain or defeated but spared (depending on interpretation of the text). In Tristrant, he is one of King Mark's vassals and an enemy of Tristan, who brutally kills him during his escape from Mark's court.\n\n\nBrandelis\n\nBrandelis (or similar) is the name of a number of Arthurian romance characters, including multiple Knights of the Round Table from the French prose tradition. As in the case of several other Arthurian characters, such as King Ban, they might have been derived from the Welsh mythology's figure of Brân.\nThe best known of these characters was originally known as Bran de Lis (Brans, Bras, Brun; -de Lys), a character related to one of the mothers of the illegitimate sons of Gawain. Bran first appears in the First Continuation of Chrétien's Perceval as one of the brothers of the Tent Maiden (Guilorete) of the Castle Lis, the mother of Gawain's son Lionel (Lioniaus). After Gawain had slain Bran's father Norroiz (Norrois, also Yder de Lis) and two of his brothers in the previous duels in a long feud, Bran is about to fight him as well, but they are stopped by Arthur and later become friends. This story, which also exists in an alternative version where Gawain rapes the sister of Bran de Lis (see Melian), is retold in The Jeaste of Sir Gawain, where he appears as Brandles (the name also used for one of Arthur's knights in Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle), and in the Scottish Golagros and Gawane, where he is called Spinagros. In the Vulgate Cycle,  Brandelis de Gales (of Wales) is the father of Floree, mother of Gawain's son Guinglain. In Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, Brandiles (Brandyles) is brother of the mother of Gawain's three sons (and later his companions at the Round Table): Gingalin, Lovel, and Florence.\nIn the prose cycles, he dies while fighting either against Lancelot during the latter's rescue of the condemned Guinevere or against Mordred in the final battle. Priot to that, he appears in multiple episodes through the Vulgate Cycle (some of which are included in Le Morte d'Arthur) as Sir Brandelis (Brandaliz, Brandalus, Brandalis, Brandeliz, Braudaliz; also Brandellis uniquely in the Scottish Vulgate Lancelot version Lancelot of the Laik), participating in quests and adventures, including the Quest for the Grail, and in the wars against Claudas and Galahaut.\nIn the Prose Tristan, Brandeliz (Brandelis) is a Knight of the Round Table from Cornwall, not Wales. In the standalone romance Claris et Laris, Brandaliz is one of the eleven protagonists other than the eponymous duo. Here, he is a friend of Claris who, with the help of Merlin, rescues Laris from the prison of the Danish king Tallas among his other acts. \nHe is repeatedly freed from enemy captivity by the other heroes, including Gawain and Lancelot, and in Claris et Laris by Claris. The Vulgate Lancelot story of Gaheriet's rescue of Brandelis and his lady might have been rewritten by Malory as an early episode of his \"Tale of Sir Gareth\", the fourth book of Le Morte d'Arthur.\nThe Vulgate Cycle also features a different Brandelis knight of the Round Table other than Sir Brandelis de Wales: a minor character of Duke Brandelis de Taningues (Brandeban, Brandeharz, Brandelz, -de Tranurgor). Yet another Knight of the Round Table named Brandelis le fils Lac, that is \"son of Lac\", appears as brother of Erec in Palamedes and I Due Tristani. In addition, Tristan's son romance Ysaïe le Triste features Brandor de Gaunes (of Wales), son of the Round Table knight Brandalis. \n\nA few other Brandalis characters are clearly unrelated to the Round Table, such as that of the Saxon king known as either Brandalis or Mandalis (Brandalus, Braundalis, Maundalis), or that of Arthur's sworn eternal enemy Brandelis (Brandalis), both appearing in the Vulgate Merlin. In the Welsh Vulgate Queste translation Y Seint Greal, two of Peredur's deceased uncles are named as Brwns Brandalis and Brendalis of Wales (Brendalis o Gymry). In Perlesvaus, Bruns [de] Brandalis is a long-dead uncle of Perceval in addition to his brother (another of Perceval's uncles) Brandalus de Gales. However, some scholars have connected Bran de Lis with the villains Brian (Brien) des Isles (of the Isles) from Perlesvaus and Brandin des Isles (Brandis, Brandus, Branduz, -des Ylles) from the Vulgate Lancelot (his character was expanded with an account of his earlier life as an invader in the Livre d'Artus), as well as to King Brandelidelin from an early German Arthurian romance Parzival, as possibly identical in origin. (In the case of Brian des Isles, he may also have been modeled after the historical Bryan FitzAlan, also known as Brian de l'Isle or Brian de Insula.) \n\n\nCalogrenant\n\nCalogrenant, sometimes known in English as Colgrevance of Gore and in German as Kalogrenant, among many other variants (including Calogreant, Calogrenan[s/z], Calogrevant, Calogrinans, Calogrinant, Collegrevaunce, Colgrevaunce de Gorre, Galogrinans, Kalebrant, Kalocreant, Kalogreant, Qualogrenans), is a knight of the Round Table and cousin to Yvain. He first appears in Yvain, the Knight of the Lion by Chrétien de Troyes.\n\nIn Yvain, Calogrenant tells a story to a group of knights and Queen Guinevere about an adventure he had in the forest of Brocéliande, where here was a magic spring that could summon a large storm. Calogrenant reached the spring and summoned the storm, after which a knight named Esclados attacked and defeated him. Yvain is upset that Calogrenant never told him of this defeat, and sets out to avenge him, embarking on the adventure that sets up the remainder of events in the romance. His character has been derived from the Welsh mythological hero Cynon ap Clydno, usually the lover of Owain mab Urien's sister Morvydd; although in Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain, Cynon is stated to be the son of Clydno, possibly connected to Clyddno Eiddin. Roger Sherman Loomis and some other scholars speculated that Calogrenant was used specifically as a foil for Kay in some lost early version of Yvain's story. Chrétien characterized him as everything Kay is not: polite, respectful, eloquent, and well-mannered. By this theory, his name can be deconstructed to \"Cai lo grenant\", or \"Cai the grumbler\", which would represent another opposite characteristic of Kay, who was famous for his bitter sarcasm.\n\nHis later appearance in Diu Crône has Kalogrenant and Lancelot, who both fail, accompany the Grail-achiever Gawain on the Grail Quest. Calogrenant features as one of relatively minor knights in the Lancelot-Grail (Vulgate) cycle, where his kinship to Yvain is not as clear as in Chrétien. There, he dies during the Grail Quest while trying to keep the furious Lionel from killing his own brother, Bors (this scene is described in more detail in their articles). Thomas Malory calls him Colgrevance and recounts his death at Lionel's hands from the Vulgate Queste in his Le Morte d'Arthur. However, despite having died on the Grail Quest, Colgrevance (or a different knight by the same name) reappears in Malory as one of the twelve knights who help Agravaine and Mordred trap Lancelot and Guinevere together in the queen's chambers. Lancelot has neither armour nor weapons, but manages to pull Colgrevance into the room and kills him, and then uses Colgrevance's sword to defeat the rest of Mordred's companions. \n\n\nClaudin\n\nClaudin (Claudine, Claudins, Claudino, Claudyne) is the son of the Frankish King Claudas of the Wasteland (de la Deserte) who appears in several works including the Lancelot-Grail prose cycle, the Prose Tristan, the Post-Vulgate Cycle, and Le Morte d'Arthur. His father, who he fights for, is a major villain during King Arthur's early reign. However, when Claudas eventually loses the war and flees to Rome, Prince Claudin surrenders and defects to Arthur, who makes him a member of the Round Table. During the Grail Quest, Claudin is one of the companions of Bors the Younger, Galahad and Perceval in Corbenic. \n\n\nCligès\nCligès is the title hero of Chrétien de Troyes' French poem Cligès (and its foreign versions). There, he is an offspring of Arthur's niece Soredamors and Alexander, a son of the Greek (Byzantine) Emperor. Following his adventures, Cliges eventually marries Fenice, a daughter of the German Emperor, and becomes the Greek Emperor himself.\nAs Cligés (Clicés, Clies, Clygés), he also appears in some other French Arthurian romances, including in the First Continuation of Chrétien's Perceval (where his father is King Lac) and in Claris et Laris. In the Romanz du reis Yder, he serves Queen Guenloie (Guinevere) until he is expelled from her court after he criticizes her love for Yder (who later promises to reconcile them). In The Marvels of Rigomer, he hails from Greece and participates in the quest to conquer Rigomer Castle as one of Gawain's many companions; he also defeats the undead knight in his own episode. As Clias the Greek (der Grieche Clîas), he has a role in the German Parzival. \n\nThomas Malory's Urry list in Le Morte d'Arthur calls him Sir Clegis. Despite a similar name, Malory's characters completely unrelated to the eponymous hero of the English verse romance Sir Cleges that features a completely different story set in the times of Arthur's father, Uther Pendragon. \n\n\nDodinel\n\nDodinel (Dodinas, Dodine[i]s, Dôdînes, Dodinia[u]s, Dodin[s], Dodinal, Dodynas, Dodynel[l], Didonel, Didones, Dydonel), originally known as  Lionel (Lioniaus, not to be confused with the other Lionel but possibly originally connected with the character of Lionel/Lioniaus the son of Gawain), is a Knight of the Round Table found in a great many works of Arthurian romance. In these, he is typically featured as a well-known knight yet merely a figurant type of a character, and without a common role. He is nevertheless important in several of such works, including the Third Continuation of Perceval, the Vulgate Lancelot, the Post-Vulgate Merlin, the Livre d'Artus, the Prose Tristan, and Claris et Laris.\nHe often bears the epithet le Sauvage (le Savage, le Salvage, li Sauvages, li Salvages, el Salvaje, der Wilde, etc.), variously translated to English as the Wild, the Wildman, or the Savage (sometimes also as the descriptive \"impetuous\" or \"fierce\"). He might have been originally identical with Perceval, which would explain his characteristic epithet as meaning a man from the woods (wilderness). However, the only possible trace of such motif can be found in the German Lanzelet, in which Dodines lives a double life: as an enchanter owning a magic horse and dwelling near the dangerous Shrieking Marsh (Schreiende Moos) in the summer, and as a knight in Arthur's lands in the winter.\nHe is briefly introduced in Chrétien de Troyes' Erec and Enide, being named there as Lionel (called Dodinas in the German translation Erec) and described as the ninth best of King Arthur's knights, albeit noted as a rude one. He is also listed among the top knights of Arthur in Chrétien's Yvain, the Knight of the Lion as well as in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, while the later romance The Knight of the Two Swords describes him as a \"truly exceptional ... man of many virtues.\" In the Third Continuation of Chrétien's Perceval, the Story of the Grail, one of the six episodes of Gawain's adventures relate his rescue of the \"handsome and valiant\" Dodinel (Dodinal) from a prison and his lover from a pyre, the latter then also again saved by Perceval. \nAs with his other characteristics, Dodinel's family relations are variably told. In the Vulgate Merlin Continuation and the Vulgate Lancelot, Dodinel the Wildman is an illegitimate son of King Bélinant (Balinant, Belinans, Belynans, Belyna[u]nt; possibly on of many Arthurian characters based on the Celtic god Belinus) de Sorgales (\"of South Wales\"; Norgales / North Wales in the Vulgate Lancelot) and his own niece, but raised by King Arthur's relative Queen Eglantine (Eglante, Eglente). In the Post-Vulgate Huth-Merlin, he is son of Balin's brother Balan (Balaan le Sauvage). In the Didot-Perceval, he is son of the Lady of Malehaut (Dame de Malohaut). In Parzival, he has a brother called Taurian the Wild (der Wilde).\nDodinel is prominent in Claris and Laris, portrayed there as a comical side story character, a Dinadan-like humorously anti-chivalric knight, one who avoids dangerous combat in his wanderings and once escapes from a captivity by posing as a minstrel. He and Dinadan are themselves friends in Meliadus; in the Marvels of Rigomer, Dodinel is one of Gawain's quest companions. Thomas Malory in his Le Morte d'Arthur, following some of the Dodinel material from the Vulgate Lancelot as well as his portrayal in the Prose Tristan, has him (named as Dodinas le Savage in the Winchester Manuscript) as a recurring companion of Sagramore and, early in his career, as one of the Guinevere's own ten knights.\nA complete story of Dodinel (in different versions, including different origins and families as described earlier) is presented in the French prose cycles. In the Vulgate Merlin and the Livre d'Artus, the young teenage Dodinel defects to Arthur early in the king's reign, opposing his own family. In the Livre, he kills the Saxon king Mathmas at the Battle of Clarence (Badon). Having been knighted by Arthur, he joins the Queen's Knights and eventually the Round Table. The Vulgate Lancelot, besides telling the stories of Lancelot's rescues of the captive Dodinel on multiple occasions, has him as one of the only five knights who cross the perilous bridge into Sorelois alive (besides Gawain, Meliant, Yder and Arthur). In the Vulgate Queste, he is one of the Grail knights in Galahad's company. In the Post-Vulgate, Lamorak is slain by Gawain and his brothers when he is injured following an earlier fight with Dodinel. In the end, Dodinel dies fighting against Mordred's forces at the Battle of Salisbury Plain (Camlann).\n\nIn Italy, he is called Dondinello and its variants, usually with no epithet (except in the case of Oddinello le Salvaggio in the Tristano Riccardiano). In his unusual characterization in Chantari di Lancelotto, Dodinel (Dudinello) is a villain who joins up with Mordred to conspire against Lancelot. Cantari di Carduino, a Fair Unknown type epic poem possibly based on a lost Dodinel romance, tells the story of his eponymous son Carduino's vengeance against the clan of Gawain for having his father fatally poisoned by the jealous lords including Mordred and Augerisse (probably Gaheris), as well as of Carduino's other adventures. \n\n\nDrian\nDrian (Doryan, Driant, Durnor) is one of King Pellinore's sons out of wedlock. He is most prominent in the Prose Tristan which describes him as one of the very best of the Knights, alongside Galahad, Lancelot, Palamedes, and his own brother Lamorak. There, Drian and Lamorak are hated by Gawain for being sons of Pellinore and for being superior knights to Gawain. Drian dies when he fights three of King Lot's sons, unhorsing Agravain and Mordred before being mortally wounded and left for dead by Gawain; Lamorak dies soon afterwards while trying to avenge him.\nDrian is called Dornar (Durnor[e]) by Thomas Malory in Le Morte d'Arthur, where he is also killed by Gawain. He appears alongside two knights named Darnarde and Dryaun (Dryaunt,  Tryan), both of them also derived from the French Drian. Malory splits Drian's adventures from the Prose Tristan between the latter two: Dryaun guards a bridge with his brother Alain (one of Drian's other brothers), jousting the passing knights; Darnarde visits King Mark's court with Lamorak, where they defeat Mark and all of his knights but Tristan. Darnarde is eventually killed alongside his brothers, Aglovale and Tor, when Lancelot rescues Queen Guinevere from the stake.\n\n\nElyan\n\nElyan the White or Helyan le Blanc (also Elain, Elayn, Helain, Hellaine, Helin; -le Blank, -the Pale) is son of Bors the Younger in the prose romance tradition of Lancelot-Grail (Vulgate Cycle). His mother, Claire, has tricked Bors into sleeping with her using a magic ring (the only time Bors broke his vow of chastity). Claire is daughter of British king Brandegorre (Brandegoris) and also half-sister of Sagramore, and their shared mother is daughter of the Eastern Roman Emperor. At the age of 15, Elyan is brought to Arthur's court by Bors. He then becomes known as an excellent knight and is accepted as a member to the Round Table. True to his lineage, Elyan eventually becomes Emperor of Constantinople himself.\nElyan's adventures are different the Post-Vulgate Queste, as well as the expanded version of the Prose Tristan, where he takes a vacant Round Table seat that had belonged to Dragan (Dagarius) after the latter knight's death by Tristan. He later helps his cousin Lancelot rescue Guinevere after their affair is exposed, and then joins him in exile during their war with Arthur.\n\nElyan should not be confused with Elians (Eliant, Elianz), a knight from Ireland who occupied the vacant seat of Lancelot after his expulsion from the Round Table in both the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate versions of the Mort Artu. A modern character inspired by Elyan the White was portrayed by Nigerian actor Adetomiwa Edun as Guinevere's brother in the 2008 television series Merlin. \n\n\nErec\n\nErec (French Erech, Eric, Herec, Heret; German Eres; Italian Arecco; Middle English Errake; Norse Erex), the son of King Lac, is most famous as the protagonist in Chrétien de Troyes' first romance, Erec and Enide, later retold in Erec and other versions. Because of Erec and Enide's connection to the Welsh Geraint and Enid, Erec and Geraint are often conflated or confused. Erec's name itself may be derived from Guerec, the Breton version of Gweir, the name of several of Arthur's warriors and relatives in the different early Welsh tales (possibly the prototype of Gaheris and consequently also of Gareth).\nIn Chrétien's story, Erec meets his future wife Enide while on a quest to defeat a knight who had mistreated one of Queen Guinevere's servants. The two fall in love and marry, but rumours spread that Erec no longer cares for knighthood or anything else besides his domestic life. Enide cries about these rumours, causing Erec to prove his abilities, both to himself and to his wife, through a test of Enide's love for him. Erec has her accompany him on a long, tortuous trip where she is forbidden to speak to him, after which they reconcile. When Erec's father Lac dies, Erec inherits his kingdom. The Norse Erex saga gives him two sons, named Llac and Odus, who later both become kings. The story of Erec and Enide is also retold within the Prose Tristan.\nEnide is entirely absent from the Prose Erec segment of the Post-Vulgate Cycle (beginning in La Folie Lancelot and concluded in the P-V Queste), in which Erec's mother's enchantment makes him immune to magic. His acts include saving Bors from the enchanter Mabon; he also has a cousin named Driadam, whose death begins Erec's feud with the young Mordred. In the Post-Vulgate Quest of the Holy Grail, Erec unwillingly murders his sister and is later slain by Gawain in revenge for the death of Yvain of the White Hands, and does not regain his father's kingdom; his seat at the Round Table is taken by his friend Meraugis, who had buried him. In the Alliterative Morte Arthure, Erec dies during the final battle between the forces of Arthur and Mordred.\n\nIn Lanzelet, Erec and Gawain agree to be delivered as prisoners to the great wizard Malduc (whose father was killed by Erec), so that Guinevere can be rescued from King Valerin's castle; they are then tortured and almost starved to death in Malduc's dungeon, until they are eventually themselves rescued. In Le Morte d'Arthur, Harry le Fyse Lake (or Garry le Fitz Lake, Malory's corruption of the French Herec le Fils Lac) participates in Lancelot's rescue of Guinevere from the stake. \n\n\nEsclabor\n\nEsclabor the Unknown (Astlabor, Esclabort, Scalabrone; -le Mescogneu, -li Mesconneü, -li Mesconneuz) is a wandering Saracen king from a vaguely Middle Eastern land, usually either Babylon (in today's Iraq) or Galilee (in today's Israel). He is the father of Palamedes, Safir, and Segwarides, among others. During his long stay in Britain, Esclabor initially hides his faith, trying to pass as a Christian, but soon becomes widely known as a valiant pagan knight.\n\nWhile visiting Rome, he saves the life of the Roman Emperor; he later travels to Arthur's Logres at the time of Arthur's coronation, where he rescues King Pellinore as well. Esclabor eventually settles at Camelot, later adventuring with Palamedes and Galahad during the Grail Quest. In the Post-Vulgate Queste, eleven of his sons are killed during their encounter with the Questing Beast. Shortly after finally agreeing to convert to Christianity, an act necessary for the full admission into the brotherhood of Round Table, and which also allows his participation in the Grail Quest, Esclabor commits suicide from grief upon learning of his favorite son Palamedes' death at the hands of Gawain. \n\n\nGaheris de Karaheu\n\nGaheris de Karaheu (Gaharis, Gaheran, Gahetis, Gaherys, Gaheus, Gains, Gareis, Ghaheris; -d'Escareu, -de Carahan/Car[a/e]heu, -de Gaheran/Gahereu, -de Karahau/Karehan), also known as the White (li Blans), is one of the minor Knights of the Round Table and brother of Mador de la Porte in the Vulgate Cycle and the derived works. He should not be confused with Gaheris of Orkney, one of King Arthur's nephews and another Knight of the Round Table. His most prominent role, including the manner of his death, might have been inspired by the purportedly historical account of the fatal poisoning of the Gawain-prototype Walwen as told in the chronicle Gesta Regum Anglorum.\n\nIn the Vulgate Lancelot, Gaheris of Karaheu appears in minor roles, mostly as a prisoner, prior to his accidental death. Gawain saves him from Galehaut, while the mysterious White Knight (Lancelot incognito) rescues him from the Dolorous Prison near Dolorous Gard and then again from the Vale of No Return. Later, in the Vulgate Mort Artu, he dies from eating a poisoned apple, which was made by the knight Avarlan and was meant to kill Gawain. The apple is offered to Gaheris unknowingly by Guinevere; the queen is accused of his murder, until she is cleared of the charge in the trial by combat between Mador and Lancelot. This story is retold in the Stanzaic Morte Arthur and in Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, where the victim is, respectively, either an unnamed visiting Scottish knight or Sir Patrise of Ireland (the poisoner is also renamed by Malory as Sir Pionel). The Italian Tristano Panciaticchiano, in which he remains Mador's brother, calls him Giafredi. \n\n\nGalehodin\nGalehodin le Gallois (Galeh[a/o]udin, also Gal[l]ides, Gallind[r]es, etc.) is Galehaut's nephew and godson, and his designated successor as the King of Sorelois. Galehodin is introduced in the Prose Lancelot as the young grandson of the King of Norgales (North Wales). There he is the lord of the town and castle of Pennin (Peningue), and desires to follow the great hero Lancelot so he can learn from him. He is described as one of the tallest knights in the world, using a plain white shield with no identification symbols. Together with Mordred and Mador, he easily triumphs over the men of Gorre in a tournament against King Bagdemagus. In the Italian Tavola Ritonda, Galehaut's heir is his son named Abastunagio, a character corresponding with that of Galehodin as he appears in the Prose Tristan. Both appear in their respective texts in the role of the host of the great tournament in Sorelois. The Hebrew King Artus includes one Galaodin de Gaulis (of Gaul) among Lancelot's followers.\n\nGalehaut's cousin and fellow Knight of the Round Table named Galahodin (Galihodin, Galyhodin, sometimes with 'yn' at the end) appears as one of closest companions of Lancelot in Thomas Malory's telling, in which Galahodin is given some of Galehaut's traits from the French tradition. Galahodin, described as a sub-king in Sorelois, serves Lancelot as one of his chief knights during the war against Arthur, later joining him in the hermitage at the end of his life. Before that, one of the episodes borrowed from the Prose Tristan tell of Galahodin's attempted kidnapping of Isolde, foiled by Palamedes. Malory's Galahodin should not be confused with two of his original characters from Le Morte d'Arthur, Lancelot's own relatives Galyhod (Galihud, Galyhud) and Gahalantyne (Gahalantin), who are also close companions of Lancelot. After taking over the lands in France, Malory's Lancelot appoints Galahodin as the duke of Saintonge, Galyhod as the earl of Périgord, and Gahalantyne as the duke of Auvergne. They eventually stay together with Lancelot and Galahodin as their fellow monks at the end. \n\n\nGaleschin\n\nGaleschin (Galaas, Galachin, Galathin, Galescalain, Galeschalains, Galescin[s], Galeshin,  Galessin, etc.) is the son of King Arthur's half-sister Queen Elaine and King Nentres of Garlot. He first appears in the story of the Dolorous Tower in the Vulgate Cycle, in which he and his cousin Yvain attempt to rescue their other cousin Gawain from the wicked lord Carados; both are taken captive as well, but the trio are eventually rescued by Lancelot. (Galeschin is later additionally rescued by Lancelot from the Vale of No Return.) Though mentioned in a few other stories, his role is ultimately minor. He loosely inspired the character of Duke Chaleins (Cha[u]lance) the Duke of Clarence, a Knight of the Round Table appearing in different episodes of Le Morte d'Arthur.\n\nRoger Sherman Loomis derives the name Galeschin from the name Galvariun, found on an Arthurian relief on the Italian Modena Archivolt, considered the first known Arthurian illustration (c. 1120–1240). He theorizes that the name was altered to make it sound more like Galesche, the Old French word for Gaul, and derives the name Galvariun from the epithet Gwallt Euryn, found in Culhwch and Olwen, which he translates as \"Golden Hair\". However, other scholars usually identify the figure of Galvariun as a prototype of Gawain's brother Gaheris. Oddly, Galeschin is also called the Duc de Clarence in the French literature prior to the 14th century; this could not possibly refer to the position of Duke of Clarence (which did not exist yet at the time and does not refer to a place name), leading Loomis to translate it as the \"Lord of Light\". \n\n\nGingalain\n\nGingalain (French: Guinglain, Guinglan, Giglan, German: Wigalois, etc.) is the eponymous hero of the Fair Unknown literary cycle of French, English, and German romances in verse. There, the young knight, initially known only as the Fair Unknown, is eventually revealed as son of Gawain and a fairy. His name is rendered Gingelein in the Middle English version Libeaus Desconus. The prose romance Hystoire de Giglan et de Geoffroy de Maience mixes his story with that of Griflet as told in Jaufre. \nHe also appears as a minor character in the prose compilation Le Morte d'Arthur. There, Sir Gingalin (Gyngalyn) is killed by Lancelot along with his brothers Florence and Lovell after Mordred and Agravain expose Lancelot's affair with Guinevere.\n\nIn Renaut de Beaujeu's Le Bel Inconnu, his heraldic device is described as lion of ermine on field of azure colour. This is observed to be an appropriation of the author's own Beaujeu (Bâgé) family coat of arms. \n\n\nGornemant\nGornemant de Gohort (Gorneman[s/z]: -de Goort, de Gorhaut) is the knight best known as Perceval's old mentor. He is mentioned in a few early romances and is prominent in Chrétien de Troyes's Perceval, the Story of the Grail, in which he instructs the young hero in the ways of knighthood. There, Gornemant is also an uncle of Blanchefleur, whom Perceval later marries after successfully defending her city against attackers. Medieval German author Wolfram von Eschenbach gives Gurnemans three sons named Gurzgi, Lascoyt and Schentefleurs, as well as a daughter named Liaze who falls in love with Perceval but he declines to marry her.\n\nIn the Prose Tristan romances, a character with a corresponding function, named Governal[e], is entrusted by Merlin to care for and edecate the young Cornish prince Tristan. In Richard Wagner's opera Parsifal, Gurnemanz is depicted as a Grail Knight. \n\n\nGriflet\n\nGriflet () the son of Do is a ubiquitous character in Arthurian legend, where he was one of the first Knights of the Round Table. He is first found in Chrétien de Troyes' Erec et Enide, named there as Girflez li filz Do. Like many other Arthurian romance characters, his origins lie in Welsh mythology; in this instance, it is the minor deity Gilfaethwy fab Dôn. He is notably the eponymous hero of his own, early chivalric romance, Jaufre.\nHe also appears as Gerflet in Beroul's Tristan and in the Norse Parcevals Saga; Gerflet li fius Do in Mériadeuc; Gifflet in Escanor; Gifflet (Girfles) li fieus Do in the Livre d'Artus; Giflés (Gifles) li fius Do in Perceval ou le Conte du Graal, Li Biaus Descouneüs, and Libeaus Desconus; Giflet le fils de Do in Le Bel Inconnu; Giflet fis Do in Sir Gawain and the Lady of Lys; Girflet (Giflet, Giflez, Giftet, Girfles, Gyfles, Gyflet, Gyrflet) le (li) fils (filz) Do (Doon, Dos) in the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate prose cycles; Girfles (Girlflet, Girflez) li filz Do in the Prose Tristan; Girflez le fils Do in Lancelot, le Chevalier de la Charrette; Girflez in La Mule sans Frein; Griflet (Gifles, Gifflès, Gifflet, Gryflet, Gryfflet) li fieus Do (Dou) in Le Morte d'Arthur; Grifles in Henry Lovelich's Merlin; Grimfles in the English Prose Merlin; Gyffroun in Ywain and Gawain; and Iofreit (Jofreit) fils Idol in Parzival. Further texts featuring him include Hunbaut, La Vengeance Raguidel, and the First and Fourth Continuations of Perceval.\n\nIn French chivalric romance prose cycles, he is a cousin to Lucan and Bedivere who first appears as a loyal and valiant young squire at the beginning of King Arthur's rule. About the same age as Arthur, he distinguishes himself in the Battle of Bedegraine against the rebels and joins the Round Table after personally slaying one of the Saxon kings when he helps Kay and Gawain rescue Guinevere in the Prose Merlin. Later, however, his role becomes largely limited to him notoriously often falling into captivity for the other knights to rescue in the course of their own adventures, even leading Gawain to comment in the Prose Lancelot that \"there never was a man so frequently taken prisoner as Girflet has been.\" According to the French Mort Artu, he was one of the few survivors of Arthur's final battle and was asked by the dying king to return his sword Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake. In Le Morte d'Arthur, however, Sir Griflet is one of the knights killed by Lancelot's rescue party at the execution of Guinevere, making Griflet's cousin Bedivere the knight who casts away Excalibur, the role that has been given to Bedivere also in the earlier English adaptations of the Mort Artu. \n\n\nHector de Maris\n\nHector de Maris (Ector de Maris, Estor de Mareis, Hector de Marais, Hestor des Mares, etc.) is the younger half-brother of Lancelot; Bors and Lionel are his cousins. His name means Hector of the Fens (the form used in Norris J. Lacy's translation of the Vulgate Cycle); he should not be mistaken with Sir Ector (Hector), the father of Kay and foster father of Arthur. Hector's adventures are many and wide-ranging, especially within the Vulgate and the Post-Vulgate prose cycles. As Astore, he is also the eponymous protagonist of the Italian Cantare di Astore e Morgana in which he becomes Morgan's seemingly invincible demon-knight minion known as Estorre after being first cured by her of his wounds and then falling under her evil spell, until he is defeated and saved by Galahad.\n\nAs told in the Vulgate Merlin, Hector is an illegitimate son of King Ban of Benoic (in today's France), who, magically helped by Merlin, fathered him with the Lady de Maris. He is raised by his maternal grandfather Agravadain the Black, lord of the Castle of the Fens. In the Vulgate Lancelot, Hector fights against the Saxons and saves his relative Elaine the Peerless. He is successful at tournaments, prevailing against such esteemed knights as Palomedes and Perceval. Hector is, however, one of the knights defeated and imprisoned by Turquine before being rescued by his brother Lancelot; he later returns the favour by finding the lost Knight of the Lake after Lancelot's period of insanity and returning him to the court. During the time when Lancelot is missing, Hector is one of the best knights of Arthur, second only to Bors, as ranked by King Bagdemagus asked by Arthur. Hector has a long relationship with Lady Perse of the Narrow Borderland after saving her from a forced marriage; he also has an affair with a cousin of the Lady of Roestoc prior to reuniting with Perse. In the Post-Vulgate Queste, his friendship with Gawain turns into the hatred following Gawain's killing of Erec. Hector participates in the great Grail Quest, during which his companions besides Gawain include Arthur the Less and Meraugis. Like most others, Hector is proven unworthy of achieving the sacred relic. Nevertheless, he helps the Grail hero Galahad to destroy the Castle of Treachery, and the appearance of the Grail revives him and Perceval after the two mortally wounded each other. In the Mort Artu (and Le Morte d'Arthur), when Lancelot is caught in his affair with Guinevere, Hector stands by his half-brother and leaves court with him. He becomes one of the top leaders of Lancelot's faction, participating in the battle to rescue the queen at her would-be execution and the subsequent defence of Lancelot's castle Joyous Guard. Hector accompanies Lancelot in France when they are expelled from Arthur's kingdom, before later returning to Britain to help defeat the Saxon army aided by Mordred's sons after the Battle of Camlann (Salisbury). He then joins his brother at the Archbishop of Canterbury's hermitage, and later dies on a crusade in the Holy Land. \n\n\nKing of a Hundred Knights\nThe King of (or with) a (or the) Hundred Knights (Old French: Roi des Cent Chevaliers) is a moniker commonly used in for a character that has appeared under different given names in various works of Arthurian romance. One of these is Malaguin (Aguignier, Aguigens, Aguigniez, Aguysans, Alguigines, Angvigenes, Malaguis, Malauguin[s], etc.) in the Prose Lancelot; the legendary figure of Malaguin seems to be loosely based on that of the historical Maelgwn, an early 6th-century king of Gwynedd known for propagating Christianity in Britain. He appears as Heraut  (Berant, Horel, Horiaus, Hovaux, etc.) li Aspres in the Prose Tristan, while Le Morte d'Arthur calls him as Sir Barant (Berrant) le Apres. Some texts, such as Palamedes, do not give him a proper name.\nHis first known appearance is possibly as Ritschart in Lanzelet, who is mentioned as having a hundred knights and is aided by Lancelot against King Lot, followed by that of Margon in the Third Continuation of Perceval, the Story of the Grail. His first major role as the \"King of a Hundred Knights\" is found in the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate versions of Merlin continuations, in which he is introduced as one of the chief rebels against King Arthur in the Battle of Bedegraine; however, after experiencing a prophetic dream, he decides to join Arthur to fight the invading Saxon pagans in God's name. He remains on Arthur's side during Lot's second rebellion, but then fights against Arthur in the service of Galehaut in the Vulgate Lancelot; afterwards, he again submits to Arthur's rule and joins the Round Table, later taking part in the war against Rome. (The chronology of that is different in Malory's compilation.) Lancelot of the Laik, a Scots version of the Vulgate Lancelot, splits his character into these of the King of a Hundred Knights and Maleginis, two different minor kings serving Galehaut.\n\nHe is described as the ruler of the land variably known as Estrangore in the Livre d'Artus alternative continuation of Merlin, Malahaut (Malehaut, etc.) in the Estoire de Merlin and the Prose Lancelot, Guzilagne in La Tavola Ritonda, Piacenza in I Due Tristani, and Tumane in Lanzelet. The Vulgate Lancelot gives him a sister known only as the Lady of Malahaut, a son named Maranz (Marant, Marauz, Martans, Martant), and a daughter named Landoine (Landoigne). The Prose Tristan and Le Morte d'Arthur mention him as a lover of one of Morgan le Fay's companions, the enchantress known as the Queen of North Wales. In I Due Tristani, he marries Riccarda, the half-giant sister of Galehaut. In the Third Continuation of Perceval, his son, named Cargril (Cargrilo), falls in one-sided love with Perceval's cousin Sore Pucelle; Margon and Cargril besiege her castle, however Gawain lifts the siege and Sore Pucelle avenges their hanging of her lover by launching Cargril from a catapult. In La Tavola Ritonda, the King of a Hundred Knights dies fighting alongside King Amoroldo of Ireland (an Italian version of Morholt) at the Battle of Lerline, in a factional conflict in which Lancelot and Tristan find themselves on the opposing sides. \n\n\nLac\nKing Lac (French: Roi Lac, literally \"King Lake\") is the father of the Round Table member Erec, was introduced in Chrétien de Troyes' Erec and Enide and its variants. His counterpart in the Welsh Geraint and Enid is named Erbin. King Lac is himself a Knight of the Round Table in the Guiron le Courteous part of Palamedes, and Thomas Malory retained him in this role in his Le Morte d'Arthur as the King of the Lake.\nAccording to Erec et Enide, King Lac dies of old age and his son Erec is made ruler of Lac's kingdom by King Arthur. That kingdom is variably known as Estre-Gales (probably \"Outer Wales\", possibly Strathclyde or Striguil) with the capital Carrant or Carnant (possibly a Brittonic form of Nantes), Destrigales in Hartmann von Aue's version, Greater Orkney (Orcanie la Grant) in the Vulgate Cycle, and Black Isles in Palamedes. In his redefinition in the Post-Vulgate Cycle, King Lac is son of Canan, a commoner-born Greek king. The Post-Vulgate Quest of the Holy Grail tells of Lac's poisoning by the sons of his brother, King Dirac, and the young Erec's exile from their kingdom of Saloliqui to Britain following Lac's murder. Here, King Lac's wife (Erec's mother) was the sorceress Crisea (Ocise), the sister of Pelles the Fisher King.\n\nBesides Erec, King Lac's children include a daughter, who appears unnamed in Chrétien's Perceval but is called Jeschute in Parzival. Lac's other sons include Brandelis in Palamedes and in I Due Tristani, and Cligés in the First Continuation of Perceval, who both become Knights of the Round Table in their respective stories. He is, however, entirely unrelated to neither Lancelot du Lac (meaning \"of the Lake\") nor to King Lot whose name is written as \"Lac\" in some Portuguese texts. \n\n\nLohot\nLohot or Loholt (Hoot, Loholz, Lohoot, Lohoth, Lohoz) is a character loosely based on the mysterious figure of Llacheu, one of the sons of King Arthur in the original Welsh tradition. Depending on the text, he is either Arthur's legitimate son or an illegitimate one. His story also varies greatly, as does his prominence. \nHe appears as son of Arthur and his wife Queen Guinevere in some early continental romances. In Perlesvaus, the sleeping Loholt is treacherously murdered by Kay so that the latter can take credit for the slaying of Logrin the giant, and his murder causes Guinevere to die of sorrow. In Lanzelet, Loüt is said to be the most renowned young knight who eventually accompanied Arthur \"into a country whence the Bretons still expect both of them evermore\" (i.e. Avalon). As son of Arthur named Elinot, he is also referenced as Guinevere's deceased son in Garel by Der Pleier, where he has been killed in the service of his beloved Florie who then herself died of grief. As Illinot, he similarly dies in Parzival, where she is named Florie.\n\nHis background is markedly different in the cyclical prose tradition. In the Vulgate Cycle's variant Livre d'Artus, Lohot is Arthur's bastard son by Lady Lyzianor, daughter of Earl Sevain, from the tryst magically arranged by Merlin. He dies in a tower fire as a baby while in Guinevere's care. In the mainstream Vulgate Lancelot, Lohot is a son of Arthur and Lisanor (Lisianor, Lionor) who dies from illness as a young knight, shortly after having been rescued from his captivity in the Dolorous Prison by Lancelot. This is inconsistent with his Perlesvaus-like treacherous death at Kay's hand mentioned in the Vulgate Merlin-Continuation. Le Morte d'Arthur has the Vulgate Lancelot version of Lohot renamed as Borre (Boarte, Bohart, Bohort) le Cure Hardy (\"the Strong Heart\") and his mother mentioned as Dame Lionors, daughter of Earl Sanam. The Livre de Lancelot del Lac part of Micheau Gonnot's Arthurian Compilation instead suggests that he was the son of the sorceress Camille who abducted and seduced Arthur. The standalone romance Sagramor not only conflates Lisanor's son from the Vulgate with Sagramor but even has him ascend the throne of Britain after the demise of Arthur. \n\n\nLucan\n\nLucan the Butler (Lucanere de Buttelere, Lucan[s] li Bouteillier, Lucant le Boutellier, Lucas the Botiller, Lucanus, etc.), also known in English translations as Lucan the Wine Steward, is a personal servant and court official of King Arthur whose earliest mention is found in Erec and Enide. He and his relatives, in particular his brother Bedivere and cousin Griflet, are among Arthur's earliest allies in the war against the rebel kings and then remain loyal to him throughout his life. In most accounts of Arthur's death in the romance literature, from the Lancelot-Grail cycle to Le Morte d'Arthur (where his father is named as Duke Corneus), Lucan is one of the last knights at the king's side at the Battle of Camlann and is usually the last of them to die.\nLucan fights for Arthur's right to the throne at the Battle of Bedegraine and against subsequent rebellions. He then takes on the post of butler, a significant position in charge of the royal household, alongside Bedivere the marshal and Kay the seneschal. He is also known to always attend the royal tournaments. Lucan remains with Arthur throughout the schism with Lancelot, and on occasion acts as a negotiator between them. Similarly, he stays by the monarch's side during Mordred's rebellion and tries to dissuade Arthur from his final attack on his son/nephew, but is unsuccessful and the king becomes fatally wounded. Worried about looters roaming the battlefield, Lucan and either Griflet or Bedivere attempt to move the dying Arthur into a nearby chapel for safety, but the strain is too much for Lucan and his old wound bursts open, spilling out his bowels and killing him just before the king returns Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake.\n\nThough the knight whom Arthur asks to cast the sword into the lake is usually Griflet (Vulgate Mort Artu) or Bedivere (Le Morte d'Arthur, the Alliterative Morte Arthure, the Stanzaic Morte Arthur), the 16th-century English ballad King Arthur's Death ascribes this duty to Lucan. A character named Lucan appears in the 2004 film King Arthur where, played by Johnny Brennan, he is a young boy found and cared for by Arthur's warrior Dagonet. \n\n\nMador de la Porte\n\nMador de la Porte (French: Mador, Amador; English: Mador, Madore, Madors; Italian: Amador della porta, Amadore; Irish: Mado) is a minor Knight of the Round Table in the late Arthurian prose romances. His epithet \"of the Gate\" (de la Porte) suggests he might have been Arthur's porter; if so, Mador might be equated with Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr (\"Mightygrasp\") who is Arthur's porter in medieval Welsh tales.\n\nMador's best known role is in an episode of the Vulgate Mort Artu (and consequently in the Stanzaic Morte Arthur and Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur) that tells the story of his trial by combat against the incognito Lancelot, Queen Guinevere's champion for her innocence following the poisoning of Mador's brother Gaheris de Karahau. Mador loses the duel to Lancelot (without losing his life in the process), saving Guinevere from the accusation that almost led her being burnt at the stake.\nBesides the Vulgate Mort Artu and the English works based on it, Mador also appears or is referenced in several other works, including in the Prose Lancelot, in the \"Tournament of Sorelois\" episode found in some versions of the Prose Tristan and the Prophecies de Mérlin (as well as in Le Morte d'Arthur), in the Post-Vulgate Cycle, in the Guiron le Courtois part of Palemedes, in Sir Gawaine and the Green Knight, in the Sicilian romance Floriant et Florette, and in the Compilation of Rustichello da Pisa. The Vulgate Mort Artu notes him as exceptionally tall and says there was hardly a knight in Arthur's court who was stronger. This is repeated in the Version I of the Prose Tristan, in which Tristan considers him second only to the half-giant Galehault in size and strength. In Le Morte d'Arthur, he is also a companion of the young Mordred.\n\nThe Livre d'Artus version of the Vulgate Merlin Continuation mentions Madoc li Noirs de la Porte (Madoc the Black of the Gate) among the knights who come to the aid of Aglovale to fight against the forces of Agrippe. He may be further identical with the knight Mado, who is twice briefly mentioned in the First Continuation of Chrétien's Perceval. Mado also appears as antagonist in the 16th-century Irish Arthurian tale Eachtra Mhelóra agus Orlando (The Adventures of Melora and Orlando), wherein he is the villainous son of the King of the Hesperides in love with Arthur's daughter Melora, who disguises herself as a man and fights incognito as a knight to defeat Mado and his ally Merlin. \n\n\nMelian\n\nMelian is a Knight of the Round Table who has been featured in several chivalric romances since his introduction in Perceval, the Story of the Grail, where he was originally called Melian de Lis (Melians, Meliant, Melyans, Melianz de Liz) by the author Chrétien de Troyes. According to Roger Sherman Loomis, \"that Meliant is merely a variant of Meleagant is proved by the fact that we find in the Vulgate Lancelot, where one [manuscript] has Meliagant de Cardoil [while] another has Milianz li Sires de Carduel [...] and by the fact that Heinrich von dem Turlin called the abductor of Ginover Milianz.\"\nIn Chrétien's story, Melian is injured by Gawain in the tournament in which Gawain fights for the daughter of Melian's foster-father Tiebaut, the ruler of Tintagel in Cornwall. The First Continuation gives him a niece named Pucel[l]e de Lis (also known as the Tent Maiden) and her brother Bran de Lis seeking revenge on Gawain for Melian's death from his injuries; she becomes Gawain's lover after he rapes her (there is no rape but just seduction in an alternative version, see Brandelis), and eventually King Arthur intervenes to stop Bran and makes him join his Knights. In Parzival, Meliant de Lis (Melianz, Meljanz) is the king of Lis who (along with Bagdemagus and his son Meleagant) declares war on his foster-father, Lyppaut, having been rejected by the latter's daughter, Obie. Gawain, fighting for Obie's sister Obilot, captures Meliant, who then reconciles with Obie in her captivity. Another version of this story, as told in Diu Crône, names a corresponding character as Fiers von Arramis, whom Gawain forces to surrender to a young lady who is a sister of his beloved, Flursenesephin. In the Livre de Artus, Meliant de Lis wins over and marries Gawain's own lover, Floree. As either Melian de Lis or just Melian (or forms of these), he also appears or is mentioned in many other romances, including Le Chevalier aux deux épées, Jaufré, Meraugis, La Vengeance Raguidel, Wigalois (uniquely as Miljanz), and the Didot Perceval (uniquely as Mellianz de Liz).\nIn the Vulgate Cycle's Queste and derived works (Post-Vulgate, Prose Tristan, Malory), a different Melian (Meliagante, Melians, Meliant, Melyan[s/t], Melien) is the son of King of either Denmark (Danemarc[h]e), Lyle, or Dianarca. He initially serves as a squire to Galahad, who knights him during the Grail Quest. Later, Melian joins Bors and Perceval at Castle Corbenic at the end of the quest. King Arthur appoints him to the Round Table, but he later sides with Lancelot in the civil war in the Vulgate Mort. In reward for his support, including his role in the rescue of Guinevere, Lancelot makes him an earl ruling one of Lancelot's domains on the continent. Malory calls him Melias de Lile (de Lisle) in Le Morte d'Arthur. He should not be confused with Tristan's father Meliadus, who is sometimes known as Melias.\n\nThere are also multiple other Arthurian characters by this name. For instance, one Meliant (Brano in the Italian compilation La Tavola Ritonda) is a relative of King Faramon's daughter Belide when she falsely accuses Tristan of rape in the Prose Tristan. In Perlesvaus, an explicitly villainous Meliant is an enemy lord of Arthur, allied with the traitorous Kay; he is eventually killed by Lancelot who had previously also slain his evil father. In the Vulgate Lancelot, Carados of the Dolorous Tower takes one Melyans le Gai's wife as his mistress. Another Meliant from the same cycle is an ancestor of Gawain (and himself is descended from Peter, an early Christian follower of Joseph of Arimathea) in the Vulgate Estoire del Saint Graal. \n\n\nMorholt\n\nMorholt of Ireland (Marha[u]lt, Marhaus, Morold, Amoroldo) is an Irish warrior who demands tribute from King Mark of Cornwall until he is slain by Mark's nephew Tristan. In many versions, Morholt's name is prefaced with a definite article (i.e. The Morholt) as if it were a rank or a title, but scholars have found no reason for this.\n\nHe appears in almost all versions of the legend of Tristan and Iseult, beginning with the verse works of Thomas of Britain and Béroul. In the early material, Morholt is the brother of the Queen of Ireland and the uncle of Tristan's future love (both mother and daughter are named Iseult). He comes to Cornwall to collect tribute owed to his country; instead, however, Tristan challenges him to battle on the remote Saint Samson's Isle in order to release his people from the debt. Tristan mortally wounds Morholt, leaving a piece of his sword in the Irishman's skull, but Morholt stabs him with a poisoned spear and escapes to Ireland to die. The injured Tristan eventually travels to Ireland incognito to receive healing from Iseult the Younger, but is found out when the queen discovers the piece of metal found in her brother's head fits perfectly into a chink in Tristan's blade.\n\nThe authors of later romances expanded Morholt's role. In works like the Prose Tristan, the Post-Vulgate Cycle, and Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, he is a Knight of the Round Table before his fateful encounter with Tristan, who then takes his seat. The prose romances add many further details to Morholt's career; the Post-Vulgate and Malory record his adventures with the young Gawain, Gaheris and Yvain early in King Arthur's reign. In the later versions, Tristan takes Morholt's place at the Round Table when he joins the company himself. Furthermore, Morholt's father named Norhot appears in Perceforest. \n\n\nNentres\nIn Arthurian romance, Nentres of Garlot (French: Nentres de Garlot) is a British king of the land of Garlot (Garloth, Garlott), who had served Arthur's father Uther Pendragon. At first, he rebels against the young King Arthur, but soon he becomes Arthur's ally after his defeat and reconciliation, even marrying one of Arthur's sisters. In the Old French Vulgate Merlin, he is also named Uentres and Ventre[s/ƺ], as well as Nantes, Neutre[s] and Nextres de Garloc in the Estoire d'Merlin and Neutre in the version Livre d'Artus. In the Caxton print edition of Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, he appears as Nentres, Nayntres and Nauntres, while the original Winchester manuscript calls him Nentres, Nauntres and Newtrys. His other medieval English names include Nantres or Nanter[s] in Arthour and Merlin, and Newtres, Newtris, Newtrys and Newtre[s] in Lovelich's Merlin. His first appearance could have been as Arthur's brother-in-law Viautre de Galerot (Guarlerot) in the Didot-Perceval continuation of the Verse Merlin.\nMalory makes Nentres the husband of Arthur's sister Elaine (Elayne), originally named Blasine in the Prose Merlin, by whom he has the son Galeschin and a daughter also named Elaine. In other texts, his wife is one of Arthur's different sisters: either Morgause (Belisent) or Morgan le Fay (Morgain la feé). In the Merlin continuation texts, Nentres of Garlot is one of the kings who refuse to recognise the newly proclaimed King Arthur's claim to be the true heir of Uther, and he joins the others to fight against Arthur (and his own son Galescalain) at the Battle of Bedegraine (where he is defeated by Kay in Malory). After the rebel kings agree to join Arthur to repel the foreign (Saxon or Saracen) invasion, Nentres commands the defense of Windesan. During this time, his wife is kidnapped by the enemy but is rescued by Arthur's loyalist Gawain, making Nentres firmly join Arthur's side and help him to decisively crush the foreigners at the Battle of Clarence. He then becomes one of the original members of Arthur's Round Table and participates in Arthur's continental campaigns, slaying the Spanish Saracen king Alifatima during the war against Rome.\n\nAccording to Roger Sherman Loomis, the name and character of King Nentres could have been derived from that of the historical British king Urien who is most often cast as the husband of Morgan. The Huth Merlin mentions Neutre only once as the king of Sorhaut married to Morgan, while presenting Garlot as the kingdom of Urien and Morgain (Morgue), which further suggests the identity of Nentres with Urien. The name of his realm of Garlot may also come from that of Caer Lot, an Old Welsh phrase meaning the Fortress of Lot, another British former-rebel king often depicted in the legend as married to Arthur's sister. The lands belonging to Nentres, Urien and Lot (in Lot's case meaning the kingdom of Lothian, not the northern Orkney) are also all commonly placed in today's southern (lowland) Scotland. Nevertheless, the three rebel-turned-ally kings, each later married to Arthur's sisters, regularly appear as separate characters within the same prose romances, including in Malory. \n\n\nOsenain\n\nOsenain (one of many spelling variants), often appearing with the moniker translating either (depending on the French spelling) as 'Braveheart', 'the Hardhearted', 'the Bold' or 'Hard Body', is a character often appearing as one (or more) of the knights of the Round Table in the works of Arthurian romance. In English, he is best known from Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur as Ozanna le Cure Hardy (Ozanna le Coeur Hardi in the Winchester Manuscript; rendered as Ozana of the hardy heart in William Morris' \"The Chapel in Lyonesse\"); Middle English versions of the Merlin Continuation feature names such as Gosenain Hardy Body, Gosnayn de Strangot,  Osenain Cors Hardy, or Osoman Hardi of Hert. In many works he is associated with the often similarly named nephew of King Arthur, Gawain of Orkney, while being cast as Gawain's either companion or opponent.\nWithin the chivalric romance tradition, he is first found, without details, as Garravain[s] d'Estrangot (of Estrangot) among Arthur's knights in some manuscripts of Chretien de Troyes' French poem Erec et Enide (Gasosin von Strangot in its German version Erec). Roger Sherman Loomis connected Garravain with Agravain, one of Gawain's brothers (whom Chrétien himself calls Engrevain in the later Perceval, the Story of the Grail). He is also listed by the name Gasouains in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien's Perceval. In a later, non-Chrétien verse romance Les Merveilles de Rigomer, one Garradains is named as the knight of Arthur traveling with Gawain on a quest to conquer the enchanted castle of the Irish queen Dionise.\nIn the German poem Diu Crône, the fairy knight Gasozein de Dragoz arrives at King Arthur's court, where he single-handedly defeats three Knights of the Round Table while not wearing any armor and falsely claims to be the first lover and rightful husband of Queen Guinevere, unsuccessfully demanding her to be \"returned\" to him. Gasozein later rescues the queen from her brother Gotegrin, who wants to kill Guinevere for her infidelity, but then he kidnaps her in turn and nearly rapes her, however Gawain arrives in time, defeats Gasozein in a duel, sends him back to Arthur to revoke his claim and join the Round Table, and even arranges Gasozein's marriage with his own sister-in-law, Sgoidamur. The Gosezein version of Garravain's character re-appears as Gosangos de Tarmadoise, Guinevere's early romantic lover and Gawain's valiant enemy in the French prose romance Livre d'Artus.\nFrench prose cycles and other works feature Osenain[s] Cuer Hardi (Gosenain, Osanain, Osevain, Osoain, Osuain, Oswain, etc.; -Cors Hardi[z], Corsa Hardy, Corps Hardi, au Cœur-Hardi, Chore Ardito) in the Vulgate Cycle, and Ossenain Cuer Hardi (Oselain, Osenaín, Ossenain, Ossenam, Ossenet d'Estrangot) in the Prose Tristan. In the Vulgate Estoire de Merlin (and the English Of Arthour and of Merlin), the young Gasoain d'Estrango[r]t (Gaswain, Gosenain[s], Gosnayn[s]; -of / d'Estrangor[r]e, de Strangot, Destrangot), here appearing separately from Osenain, fights alongside Gawain in the battles against the invading Saxons, his great feats earning him an early seat at the Round Table. When Gawain wrongly accuses him of treason, he gives Gawain a severe face wound in a trial by combat in front of King Arthur. In the Vulgate Lancelot, he is noted as \"very valorous and a good speaker\", and is involved in the adventures of Kay and others. He is with Gawain when they are both captured and imprisoned in the Dolorous Prison until their rescue by Lancelot, who also later frees him from Turquine's captivity on another occasion. He assists Maleagant of Gore in the abduction of Queen Guinevere and is imprisoned by King Arthur after Lancelot's rescue of her (in Malory's version, he is instead one the loyal Queen's Knights captured by Maleagant along with her). He is later forgiven and fights for Arthur against King Rience and becomes a knight errant, eventually participating in the Grail Quest. The Guiron le Courtois section of Palamedes describes him as son of King Quinados.\nLike Gawain's, his character is considered to be derived from the prototype of the warrior by the name Gwrvan and its variants, found in the early Welsh Arthurian tales Culhwch ac Olwen, Peredur fab Efrawg, Preiddeu Annwn, and Trioedd Ynys Prydein. According to Arthurian scholar Ferdinand Lot, Gwrvan's name comes with synonymous Welsh adjectives cadr and cadrauc, \"meaning 'mighty, powerful', corresponding therefore in meaning to 'au Cors Hardi'.\" The plot of the French poem Meraugis de Portlesguez revolves around the protagonist Meraugis competing for the love of Queen Lidoine with his friend Gorvain Cadrut. Here, Gorvain loses Lidoine to his rival, but ends up happily married to one of her maidens, Avice.  However, Ferdinand Lot proposed that this Gorvain is just the story's Gawain himself (who earlier appears as Golvain) by just a slightly different name. In another chivalric romance, Hunbaut, Gorvain Cadrus von Pantelion (Gorvain Cadrus of [Castle] Pantelion) takes Gawain's unnamed sister hostage, seeking vengeance against him for the death of one of his relatives. He is taken captive by Gawain, then sent as a prisoner to Arthur's court at Caerleon where he eventually becomes a Knight of the Round Table. In the Vulgate Merlin, Gosnayns Cadrus (Gornain[s], Goruain[s]; - Cadruc, Cadruz, Cardus; Gornayns Karadus in Henry Lovelich's Merlin) and Osenain Cuer Hardi appear as two different knights who are Arthur's allies since the very first days (Battle of Carmelide), before Gasoain comes to Camelot.\n\nIn the Italian Tavola Ritonda, Suziano of the Valiant Heart (Cuore Ardito) is a young son of Lady Largina and uncertainly either King Esclabor the Unknown or King Amorotto (that is, Lamorak) of Listenois, as his promiscuous and power-hungry mother was a lover of both of them at the same time. He comes into service of the evil Lady Losanna of the Ancient Tower (dela Torre Antica) after falling in love with her, and is slain by Tristan protecting Losanna's enemy Tessina from his attempt on her life. He also appears under the name Guengasoain[s] (Gasouains, Guengasouain, Guingasoain) as the antagonist of the French poem La Vengeance Raguidel, in which Gawain and Yder attempt to avenge his murder of the knight Raguidel. Here, he is a nephew of King Aguissant (King Lot's brother Angusel from the Historia Regum Britanniae) and serves as the knight of the fay enchantress Lingrenote, the lady of the Nameless Castle (Castiel sans Non), who has armed him with powerful enchanted weapons that made him near invincible. He is nevertheless defeated and killed by Gawain helped by Yder, the latter of whom then marries Guengasoain's daughter Trevilonete. \n\n\nPriamus\nPriamus (Pryamus) is an originally pagan Roman ally of Emperor Lucius in the Alliterative Morte Arthure (where his character was probably inspired by that of the Saracen Ferumbras from the Matter of France) and in Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (where he is specifically described as a Muslim). Priamus is knight from Tuscany, a right inheritor to the lands of \"Alexandria and Africa, and all outer isles\", and a descendant of Alexander the Great and Hector of Troy (and also of Judas Maccabeus and Joshua in the Morte Arthure). Upon meeting Gawain (peaceably in the Morte Arthure, in battle in Malory's \"The Tale of King Arthur and Emperor Lucius\"), Priamus defects from Lucius to join forces with King Arthur and also converts to Christianity. In return, Arthur appoints him as the Duke of Lorraine. Malory's telling also gives him two brothers who too join the Round Table. Priamus is eventually killed by Lancelot at the fight for Guinevere. \n\n\nSafir\n\nSafir (Safire, Safere, Saphar) is the youngest son of the Saracen king Esclabor in the Arthurian legend. He appeared in several works of Arthurian literature, including the Prose Tristan and Le Morte d'Arthur; his name was also included on the Winchester Round Table. Two of his brothers, Segwarides and Palamedes, also belong to the Round Table.\n\nSafir usually appears alongside his brother Palamedes. In one story, Safir disguises himself as Ector de Maris, fights with Helior le Preuse, defeats him, and wins Espinogres' lady. Vowing to defend the lady's honor, Palamedes arrives and locks swords with Safir, not realizing it is his brother. After fighting for an hour to a standstill, both are impressed with each other's prowess and skill, and decide to ask the other's identity. Safir is devastated to find that he was fighting with his own brother and asks Palamedes for forgiveness; together, they return the lady to Espinogres. Later, after the affair between Lancelot and Guinevere is exposed, Safir and Palamedes join Lancelot's side in the ensuing civil war between Lancelot and King Arthur. When they are banished to Lancelot's homeland in Gaul, Safir is made Duke of Landok while Palamedes becomes Duke of Provence. \n\n\nSegwarides\n\nSegwarides (Seguarades, Seguradés, Seguradez, etc.) is a son of the Saracen king Esclabor who becomes a liegeman of King Mark. His other brothers include the fellow Round Table knights Palamedes and Safir. It is possible there have been originally two characters of this name, but the stories in which they appear fail to differentiate between them.\n\nHe is cuckolded by Tristan in the Prose Tristan and Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. Tristan has a brief affair with Segwarides' wife, and wounds the knight after being found out. Tristan encounters Segwarides again on the Isle of Servage; Segwarides forgives him, saying he \"will never hate a noble knight for a light lady,\" and the two team up to avoid the dangers of the isle. Soon afterwards, Tristan makes Segwarides the Lord of Servage. In Malory, Segwarides is eventually killed trying to repel Lancelot's rescue of Guinevere from the stake. \n\n\nTor\n\nTor (Thor, Tors, Torz, etc.) appears frequently in Arthurian literature but always in minor roles. In the list of Arthur's prominent knights in Chrétien's Erec and Enide, the father of Tor (called Estorz in Hartmann's Erec) is named as King Ar[e]s. The German Lanzelet features Tor under the name Torfilaret derived from the French \"Tor son of Aret\". The Roman d'Escanor conflates Tor with Hector, making the latter son of King Ares. Versions of the Prose Tristan feature Tor variably as Hestor le filz Erec (son of Erec) and Tor le filz Arès.\nIn the Post-Vulgate Cycle and Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, however, Ar[i]es is only Tor's adoptive father, while Tor's natural father is King Pellinore. Tor's many half-siblings thus include Aglovale, Drian, Lamorak, Perceval, and Dindrane. He is born when Pellinore sleeps with his peasant mother (Malory calls her Vayshoure) \"half by force\", and she marries Aries shortly afterward. Here, Aries is not a king, but a poor cowherd; the young Tor is also raised as a cowherd but dreams of becoming a knight. His parents take him to the teenage King Arthur, who makes the boy one of his first knights in recognition of his qualities. Later, Merlin reveals Tor's true parentage, and Pellinore embraces his son; neither Aries nor his wife seem offended. Tor distinguishes himself at the wedding feast of Arthur and Guinevere when he takes up a quest to retrieve a mysterious white brachet hound that had come into the court. According to Malory, Tor and his brother Aglovale are present among the knights charged by Arthur with guarding the execution of Guinevere and they both die when Lancelot and his followers rescue the queen.\n\nHe should not be confused with Tor the Strong, another of Chrétien's characters and a knight from Constantinople. Tor's symbolic namesake, Le Tor of Scotland, is also featured in the Arthurian prequel romance Perceforest. \n\n\nYvain the Bastard\n\nYvain the Bastard (Yvains, Yvonet, Uwaine, Uwains; -li/le[s] Avou[l]tres, -l'Avo[u]ltre, -li Batarz) is a son of King Urien of Gore, often confused with his half-brother Yvain, after whom he was named. He is first mentioned as one of Arthur's best knights in Chrétien's Erec and Enide.\nWhile the older Yvain is Urien's legitimate child from his fairy wife Morgan, Yvain the Bastard was sired by Urien on the wife of his seneschal. He is encountered frequently in Arthurian romance as a hearty and usually sensible knight, fighting in Arthur's wars and questing for the Holy Grail with Galahad and Gareth. In the Post-Vulgate Cycle, he is killed by his cousin Gawain late during the Grail Quest when the two, disguised by their armour, randomly meet and decide to joust. It is not until Gawain takes him to a hermitage for his last rites that he realizes he has fought, and killed, his own cousin. In Perlesvaus, Yvain the Bastard's own son named Cahus dies while serving as Arthur's own squire on a strange adventure, killed by a giant in a deadly dream.\n\nThomas Malory in Le Morte d'Arthur split him into two characters: Uwaine les Avoutres, the son of Urien, and Uwaine les Adventurous, an unrelated knight. Malory further splits Morganor, the name of Urien's \"good knight\" bastard son in Of Arthour and of Merlin, into a separate character he calls Sir Morganor[e] (first appearing as a senschal of the King of the Hundred Knights, then as a king himself). Yvain the Bastard and Yvain les Avoutres are also separate characters in the Scottish romance Lancelot of the Laik. \n\n\nYvain of the White Hands\n\nYvain of the White Hands (Yvain/Yvonet aux Blanches Mains) is another different Knight of the Round Table named Yvain in the Old French romances. There, and in the English Arthour and Merlin, he is unrelated to Iseult of the White Hands and to the \"main\" Yvain (son of Urien), although Thomas Malory later merged him with the latter. He serves Arthur in the Saxon wars, later participating in the quests to learn the fate of Merlin and to find the missing Lancelot. In Palamedes, he is son of a knight named Darie. In the Prose Tristan, he is injured by King Mark and healed in a Cornish abbey. In the Post-Vulgate Queste, he is mistakenly slain by Erec, for which in turn Erec is killed by Gawain, and his seat at the Round Table is then taken by the Unknown Knight (Arthur the Less). \n\n\nOther Arthurian fellowships\n\n\nQueen's Knights\n\nThe Queen's Knights (Chevaliers de la Reine) are the knights who serve King Arthur's wife Queen Guinevere in the Old French prose cycles. They are also known in French texts as the \"Knights of Queen Guinevere\" (Chevaliers de la Roine Guenievre, the form used in the Livre d'Artus) and the more elaborate \"Valiant Knights of Queen Guinevere\" (Chevalier vaillant de la Roine Gueneure). Members of this group carry only plain white shields, often accompanying the queen and engaging in rivalry against the more experienced Knights of the Round Table. Heroes Gawain and  Lancelot are among those who first serve as the Queen's Knights in their youth after being knighted by Arthur, before winning enough honour to be promoted to fill the Round Table when a vacancy occurs. Others include the young Sagramore when he mortally wounds the Knight of the Round Table named Agravadain (unrelated to Agravain), grandfather of Hector de Maris, in defense of his comrades.\nIn the Middle English compilation Le Morte d'Arthur, the simple \"Queen's Knights\" form is used by the author Thomas Malory who also describes them as \"a grete felyshyp of men of arms\". In Malory's version, Lancelot later rescues a new generation of them when they are captured together with Guinevere by the villain Maleagant (himself sometimes depicted as a rogue member of the Round Table), after the Queen ordered her knightly companions to surrender as to not forfeit their lives.\n\n\nArthur's minor tables\nThe Post-Vulgate Cycle has two other table-based orders within Arthur's court. The first of these is the Table of Errant Companions (Tables des Compaignons Errans), reserved for the knights errant who are actively seeking adventures while awaiting promotion to the Round Table.\nThe second one is rather ingloriously called the Table of Less-Valued Knights (Tables des Chevaliers Moins Prisiés), the members of which (who originally included Perceval) are, as its name indicates, lower in their rank and status. This group seems to be derived from the knights of the Watch (also translated as the Guard), featured in the Vulgate Cycle's Prose Lancelot and first mentioned by Chrétien in Perceval.\n\n\nRound Table predecessors\nRobert de Boron's Joseph d'Arimathie introduced the Grail Table as a direct precursor to the Round Table, once used by the followers of Joseph of Arimathea, one of the earliest Christians and a relative of Jesus. They were the original guardians of the Grail, who have traveled from the Holy Land to Britain several centuries prior to the times of Arthur. In the cyclical prose continuations of Robert's poem, their descendants include Lancelot and the Fisher King. The Grail Table is again used, briefly, by the holy knight Galahad (offspring of the union between Lancelot and the Fisher King's daughter) when he and his companions (Perceval and Bors) are served mass after successfully completing the Grail Quest.\nSome French and Italian prose romances and poetry feature the original 50 knights of the Round Table from the times of Uther Pendragon, the father of King Arthur. It is known in Italian retellings of the Prose Tristan as the Old Table (Tavola Vecchia), contrasting with those of Arthur's Round Table known as the New Table (Tavola Nuova). Their stories include that of Branor the Dragon Knight, \"the flower of the Old Table\", still unsurpassed in his skills at the age of over 100. Following the death of Uther, the Round Table is kept in possession of King Leondegrance until he gives it to the young Arthur as the dowry of his daughter Guinevere.\nAn even earlier forerunner of the Round Table appears in Perceforest, where Arthur's distant ancestor, the eponymous King Perceforest, establishes the elite Order of the Franc Palais (Ordre du Franc Palais) to fight against the forces of darkness; the Order ends up destroyed by the evil Julius Caesar during his invasion of Britain. This happens even before the birth of Christ, but nevertheless is presented in the author's contemporary High Middle Ages style setting just like the other Arthurian romances; as willed by the Sovereign God (Dieu Souverain, here apparently the coming Christian god to whom the Roman and other pagan deities willingly submit and work for), the Franc Palais numbers the selected 300 British knights chosen for their valor and seated in the specially constructed building by the same name.\n\n\nOther\nJorge Ferreira de Vasconcelos' 16th-century Portuguese Memorial das Proezas da Segunda Tavola Redonda tells of the eponymous \"Second Round Table\" of new knights (children of Arthur's knights) led by King Sagramor after Arthur's death. A variety of modern works feature contemporary new Round Tables.\n\n\nSee also\nList of Arthurian characters\nPaladin\nPentecostal Oath\nSiege Perilous\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nChrétien de Troyes; Owen, D.
