  "extract": "Brigid or Brigit ( BRIJ-id, BREE-id, Irish: [ˈbʲɾʲiːdʲ]; meaning 'exalted one'), also Bríd, is a goddess of pre-Christian Ireland. She appears in Irish mythology as a member of the Tuatha Dé Danann, the daughter of the Dagda and wife of Bres, with whom she had a son named Ruadán. Her sacred tree appears to have been the birch, given some older Imbolc-related traditions.\nShe is associated with wisdom, poetry, healing, protection, smithing and domesticated animals. Cormac's Glossary, written in the 9th century by Christian monks, says that Brigid was \"the goddess whom poets adored\" and that she had two sisters: Brigid the healer and Brigid the smith. This suggests she may have been a triple deity. She is also thought to have some relation to the British Celtic goddess Brigantia.\nSaint Brigid shares many of the goddess's attributes and her feast day, 1 February, was originally a pagan festival called Imbolc. It has thus been argued that the saint is a Christianization of the goddess, or that the lore of the goddess was transferred to her.\n\n\nIn early Irish literature\nCormac's Glossary, written by Christian scribes in the 9th century and based on earlier sources, says that Brigit was a goddess and daughter of the Dagda. It describes her as a \"goddess of poets\" and \"woman of wisdom\" or sage, who is also famous for her \"protecting care\". It says that Brigit has two sisters: Brigit the physician or \"woman of healing\", and Brigit the smith. It explains that from these, all goddesses in Ireland are called Brigit; suggesting that it \"may have been more of a title than a personal name\".\nThe Lebor Gabála Érenn also calls Brigit a poetess and daughter of the Dagda. It says she has two oxen, Fea and Femen, from whom are named Mag Fea (the plain of the River Barrow) and Mag Femin (the plain of the River Suir). Elsewhere, these are named as the two oxen of Dil, \"radiant of beauty,\" which may have been a byname for Brigid.  It also says she possesses the \"king of boars\", Torc Triath (from whom the plain of Treithirne is named), and the \"king of wethers\", Cirb (from whom the plain of Cirb is named). The animals were said to cry out whenever plundering was committed in Ireland. This suggests Brigid was a guardian goddess of domesticated animals.\nIn Cath Maige Tuired, Bríd is the wife of Bres and bears him a son, Ruadán. His name is cognate to several words in Indo-European languages that mean \"red, rust\", etc. The story says she began the custom of keening, a combination of wailing and singing, while mourning the death of Ruadán. She is credited in the same passage with inventing a whistle used for night travel.\nIn her English retellings of Irish myth, Lady Augusta Gregory describes Brigit as \"a woman of poetry, and poets worshipped her, for her sway was very great and very noble.  And she was a woman of healing along with that, and a woman of smith's work, and it was she first made the whistle for calling one to another through the night.\"\n\n\nBrigid and Saint Brigid\nHistorians suggest that the goddess Brigid was syncretized with the Christian saint of the same name. According to medievalist Pamela Berger, Christian monks \"took the ancient figure of the mother goddess and grafted her name and functions onto her Christian counterpart,\" Brigid of Kildare.\nThe goddess and saint have many of the same associations. Saint Brigid is considered a patroness of healers, poets, blacksmiths, livestock and dairy workers, as well as serpents (in Scotland) and the arrival of spring.\nThe saint's hagiographies \"are mainly anecdotes and miracle stories, some of which are deeply rooted in Irish pagan folklore\". Dáithí Ó hÓgáin wrote that the melding of pagan goddess and Christian saint can be seen in some of the saint's miracles, where she multiplies food, bestows cattle and sheep, controls the weather, and is linked with fire or thermal springs.\nThis theory is contested, however, with many scholars including Elva Johnston arguing that the significance of the pagan goddess has been exaggerated at the historical figure's expense. Johnston has written \"the argument for the priority of the goddess over the saint depends on three interrelated points: firstly, that Brigit is not real, secondly that her lives betray that they are an attempt to euhemerise a pagan deity and finally an underlying assumption that a goddess cult is more empowering for the women of ancient and, by analogy, contemporary Ireland\".\nIn the late 12th century, Gerald of Wales wrote that nineteen nuns took turns in keeping a perpetual fire burning at Kildare in honour of Saint Brigid, and that this fire was kept burning since Brigid's time. It has been suggested this fire originally belonged to a temple of Brigit the goddess. The Roman goddess Vesta and the Greek goddess Hestia had perpetual fires tended by priestesses. According to Gerald, it was ringed by a hedge that no man was allowed to cross, lest he be cursed.\nThe saint is associated with many holy wells and clootie wells in Ireland and Britain, where small strips of cloth or ribbons are left as part of a healing ritual. Celtic healing goddesses, such as Sirona and Coventina, were often associated with sacred springs.\nSaint Brigid's Day is 1 February. It was originally Imbolc, the first day of spring in Irish tradition. Because Saint Brigid has been linked to the goddess Brigid, the festival of Imbolc is commonly associated with the goddess.\nSaint Brigid's Day or Imbolc is traditionally a time for weather prognostication:\n\nA tholus on Venus was named after Brigit by the International Astronomical Union in 1985. As the planetary nomenclature rules prohibit the use of national figures and religious figures from contemporary religions, this is a reference to the goddess rather than the saint.\n\n\nNeo-Paganism\nBrigid is an important figure for some modern pagans, who emphasize her triple aspect. She is sometimes worshipped in conjunction with Lugh or Cernunnos.\n\n\nName\nBy the early modern Irish period, Middle Irish Brigit [ˈbʲɾʲiʝidʲ] evolved into Brighid [bʲɾʲiːdʲ] and, after a spelling reform in 1948, the spelling was standardised as Bríd [bʲɾʲiːdʲ]. The earlier form gave rise to various forms in the languages of Europe, starting from the Medieval Latin Brigida, and from there to English Bridget, French Brigitte, Swedish Birgitta or ‘Birgit’ and Finnish Piritta.\nThe name comes from Proto-Celtic *Brigantī and means \"the high one\" or \"the exalted one\". It is cognate with the name of the ancient British goddess Brigantia, with whom Brigid is thought to have some relation. It is also cognate with the Old High German personal name Burgunt, and the Sanskrit word Bṛhatī (बृहती) \"high\", an epithet of the Hindu dawn goddess Ushas. The ultimate source is Proto-Indo-European *bʰr̥ǵʰéntih₂ (feminine form of *bʰérǵʰonts, \"high\"), derived from the root *bʰerǵʰ- (\"to rise\"). Xavier Delamarre, citing E. Campanile, suggests that Brigid could be a continuation of the Indo-European dawn goddess.\n\n\nSee also\nSaint Bridget\nBrigid's cross\nList of Irish-language given names\nSaraswati\nMaman Brigitte\nPerchta\nAthena\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\nBitel, Lisa M.
