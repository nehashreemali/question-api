  "extract": "Andy Warhol ( ; born Andrew Warhola Jr.; August 6, 1928 – February 22, 1987) was an American artist and filmmaker. Widely regarded as the most important artist of the second half of the 20th century, Warhol's work spanned various media, including painting, filmmaking, photography, publishing, and performance art. A leading figure in the pop art movement, his work explores the relationship between advertising, consumerism, mass media, and celebrity culture, transforming everyday consumer goods and familiar icons into renowned artworks. His embrace of mechanical reproduction challenged traditional boundaries between high and low culture. \nBorn to working-class Rusyn immigrant parents in Pittsburgh, Warhol began his career as a successful commercial artist in New York before transitioning to fine art. Among his best-known early works are silkscreen prints such as Campbell's Soup Cans (1962) and Marilyn Diptych (1962). In the mid 1960s, Warhol began devoting more attention to experimental filmmaking, resulting in underground films—such as Sleep (1964), Empire (1965), Vinyl (1965), Chelsea Girls (1966), Four Stars (1967), and Blue Movie (1969)—featuring a shifting group of personalities known as Warhol superstars. His studio, the Factory, became a hub for avant-garde experimentation, bringing together drag queens, poets, bohemians, musicians, and wealthy patrons. Warhol ventured into music and managed the influential rock band the Velvet Underground, who performed at his Exploding Plastic Inevitable (1966–67) multimedia events. He is often credited with popularizing the expression \"15 minutes of fame,\" which was first noted in a 1967 Time magazine article.\nAfter surviving an assassination attempt by paranoid schizophrenic writer Valerie Solanas in 1968, Warhol shifted his attention toward developing the Factory into a more structured business enterprise. He founded Interview magazine, produced the play Pork (1971), and published several books, including The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (1975) and Popism (1980). He also expanded into television, hosting the series Fashion (1979–80), Andy Warhol's TV (1980–83), and Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes (1985–87). Warhol also continued to produce visual works during the 1970s and 1980s, including the silkscreen Mao prints (1972–73), a wide range of commissioned portraits, a series of collaborations with Jean-Michel Basquiat, and the Last Supper series (1984-86). He enjoyed celebrity status until the end of his life. Warhol died of cardiac arrhythmia at the age of 58 following gallbladder surgery in 1987.\nWarhol has been described as the \"bellwether of the art market\", with several of his works ranking among the most expensive paintings ever sold. In 2013, Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster) (1963) sold for $105 million. In 2022, Shot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) sold for $195 million, the highest price ever paid at auction for a work by an American artist. Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective exhibitions, books, and documentary films. The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, which holds an extensive permanent collection of his art and archives, is the largest in the United States dedicated to a single artist.\n\n\nEarly life and education\n\nWarhol was born on August 6, 1928, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was the fourth child of Ondrej Warhola (Americanized as Andrew Warhola Sr.; 1889–1942) and Julia Warhola (née Zavacká, 1891–1972). His parents were working-class Rusyn emigrants from Mikó, Austria-Hungary (now Miková in northeast Slovakia).\nIn 1912, Warhol's father emigrated to the United States and found work in a coal mine. His wife joined him nine years later in 1921. The family lived at 55 Beelen Street and later at 3252 Dawson Street in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh. They were Ruthenian Catholic and attended St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church. Warhol had two older brothers, Paul (1922–2014) and John (1925–2010), as well as an older sister, Maria (1912; died in infancy). Warhol's nephew James Warhola, became a successful children's book illustrator.\nAt the age of eight, Warhol had a streptococcal infection that led to scarlet fever. Because there were no antibiotics to treat the illness it progressed to rheumatic fever and ultimately the neurological condition Sydenham's chorea, sometimes referred to as St. Vitus' Dance. At times he was confined to bed and made to remain home from school. He would spend these days drawing, creating scrapbooks from Hollywood magazines, and cutting out images from comic books that his mother bought him. He also enjoyed using the family's Kodak Baby Brownie Special camera, and after noticing his passion for photography, his father and brothers built a darkroom in the basement for him.\n\nWhen Warhol started art classes at Holmes School in 1937, his art teacher saw his potential and got him admitted to Saturday drawing lessons at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh. In 1942, his father died after drinking contaminated water from a coal mine in West Virginia.\nWarhol excelled in school and won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award. After graduating from Schenley High School in 1945, he enrolled at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, where he studied commercial art. During his time there, Warhol joined the campus Modern Dance Club and Beaux Arts Society. He also served as art director of the student art magazine, Cano, illustrating a cover in 1948 and a full-page interior illustration in 1949. These are believed to be his first two published artworks. Warhol earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in pictorial design in 1949.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\n1940s\nAfter graduating from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in June 1949, Warhol moved to New York City with his classmate Philip Pearlstein. They lived in a sixth-floor walk-up tenement building on St. Mark's Place near Tompkins Square Park in the East Village. On his second day in New York, Warhol visited Tina Fredericks, the art director of Glamour magazine, whom he had met during a brief visit to the city the previous year. He presented a portfolio of work completed at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, which Fredericks received favorably, purchasing a small $10 drawing of an orchestra for her personal collection. She subsequently commissioned Warhol to produce shoe illustrations; after more than one attempt, his drawings were accepted. Glamour published a page of Warhol's shoe illustrations along with several pages of people climbing the \"ladder of success,\" accompanying the major feature \"What Is Success?,\" which comprised six individual articles by Katherine Sonntag, Hazel M. Wood, Margot Clarke, Patricia Curtain, Marya Mannes, and Elizabeth Weston. Thus beginning his career as a commercial artist.\n\n\n1950s\nWarhol was hired by prominent fashion magazines, including Glamour, Mademoiselle, Vogue, and Harper's Bazaar, and produced a prolific body of advertisements throughout the 1950s. During this period, gallerist Alexander Iolas is often credited with discovering Warhol and organized his first solo exhibition, Andy Warhol: Fifteen Drawings Based on the Writings of Truman Capote, at the Hugo Gallery in New York in 1952.\nWarhol designed several covers for Interiors magazine between 1953 and 1954. In 1954, Warhol exhibited his work on multiple occasions at Vito Giallo's Loft Gallery in New York. ARTnews observed that Warhol had \"developed an original style of line drawing,\" noting that his technique produced \"the effect of the reverse side of a negative, although his lines are broken and the spaces not clouded.\" His \"blotted line\" technique combined aspects of printmaking and graphite drawing on paper. Within a year, Warhol—then working out of his railroad apartment on East 34th Street—invited Giallo to become his first paid studio assistant.\nIn 1955, Warhol began designing advertisements for the shoe manufacturer Israel Miller.  Photographer John Coplans recalled that \"nobody drew shoes the way Andy did. He somehow gave each shoe a temperament of its own, a sort of sly, Toulouse-Lautrec kind of sophistication, but the shape and the style came through accurately and the buckle was always in the right place.\" By 1956, Warhol's distinctive style had made him widely recognized as a fashion illustrator. His drawings for L. Miller attracted considerable attention, and he was so busy that he had to turn down assignments.\nIn a 1956 interview with Mademoiselle, Warhol described his approach to combining commercial and fine art: \"Every time I draw a shoe for a job, I do an illustration for myself.\" He acknowledged that \"you almost have to specialize to get assignments,\" but noted that most New York art directors were eager to \"give you a chance to do things.\" Warhol's personal illustrations were whimsical shoe designs embellished with gold leaf, and each represented a famous figure such as Truman Capote, Kate Smith, James Dean, Julie Andrews, Elvis Presley, and Zsa Zsa Gabor. They sold for $50 to $225 apiece when they were presented at the Bodley Gallery in New York in December 1956.\nIn 1956, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) politely declined Warhol's gift of his drawing Shoe, citing limited storage space and asking him to retrieve it. Nevertheless, that same year one of his shoe drawings was included in MoMA's Recent Drawings U.S.A. group exhibition, marking Warhol's first museum showing. That year, he traveled around the world with his friend, production designer Charles Lisanby, studying art and culture in several countries. While in Kyoto, Japan, Warhol drew a stylized portrait of business tycoon Madame Helena Rubinstein.\nWarhol habitually used the expedient of tracing photographs projected with an epidiascope. Using prints by Edward Wallowitch, the photographs would undergo a subtle transformation during Warhol's often cursory tracing of contours and hatching of shadows. Warhol used Wallowitch's photograph Young Man Smoking a Cigarette (c. 1956) for a 1958 design for a book cover he submitted to Simon and Schuster for the Walter Ross pulp novel The Immortal, and later used others for his series of paintings.\nTo promote himself as an artist, Warhol produced and distributed self-published books of his illustrations, including 25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy (1957) and A Gold Book (1957), which he gave to potential clients and contacts to generate work. He frequently incorporated calligraphy by his mother, Julia Warhol, to accompany his drawings.\nWith the rapid expansion of the record industry, RCA Records hired Warhol to design album covers and promotional materials. By the late 1950s, he was also working for high-end advertising clients, including Tiffany & Co.\n\n\n1960s\nAt a time when traditional artists did not buy the work of other artists, Warhol collected them. To survive, gallery artists typically did commercial work, such as window displays, and avoided using their real names because it was frowned upon. In contrast, Warhol gained recognition as a commercial artist, which caused tension with other artists. This period was a key moment in the development of his persona. Some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself, confining himself in interviews to responses like \"Um, no\" and \"Um, yes\", and often allowing others to speak for him—and even the evolution of his pop style—can be traced to the years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world.\n\nIn 1960, Warhol purchased a Victorian townhouse at 1342 Lexington Avenue in the Carnegie Hill neighborhood of Manhattan. He used the house as both a residence and a studio, and his mother lived in the basement apartment.\nBy 1961, Warhol was well known as one of \"New York's more stylish window dressers and top shoe illustrators.\" His hand-drawn illustrations were receiving placement in Vogue and the society pages of The New York Times, although competing photography depictions were on the rise. That April, his pop paintings were exhibited for the first time in the window display of the Bonwit Teller department store on Fifth Avenue at 57th Street. Five paintings based on comic strips and newspaper ads served as the backdrop for mannequins wearing spring dresses: Saturday's Popeye, Little King, Superman, Before and After, and Advertisement.\n\nA significant turning point in Warhol's career was when he began drawing dollar bills, which inspired him to start silkscreening in the spring of 1962. Warhol was taught silkscreen printmaking techniques by Max Arthur Cohn at his graphic arts business in Manhattan. Warhol is often considered to be a pioneer in silkscreen printmaking and his techniques became more elaborate throughout his career.\nIn May 1962, Warhol was featured in an article in Time with his painting Big Campbell's Soup Can with Can Opener (Vegetable) (1962), which initiated his most sustained motif, the Campbell's soup can. That painting became Warhol's first to be shown in a museum when it was exhibited at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford in July 1962. On July 9, 1962, Warhol's exhibition opened at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles with Campbell's Soup Cans, marking his West Coast debut of pop art.\nIn November 1962, Warhol had an exhibition at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery in New York. The exhibit included the works Gold Marilyn Monroe, eight of the classic Marilyn series also named Flavor Marilyns, Marilyn Diptych, 100 Soup Cans, 100 Coke Bottles, and 100 Dollar Bills. Gold Marilyn Monroe was bought by the architect Philip Johnson and donated to the MoMA.\nIn December 1962, the MoMA hosted a symposium on pop art, during which artists such as Warhol were attacked for \"capitulating\" to consumerism. Critics were appalled by Warhol's open acceptance of market culture, which set the tone for his reception. The next year, Warhol formed The Druds, a short-lived avant-garde noise band that included figures from the New York minimal art and proto-conceptual art scenes, including Larry Poons, La Monte Young, Walter De Maria, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenberg, and Lucas Samaras.\nIn January 1963, Warhol rented his first studio, an old firehouse at 159 East 87th Street, where he produced his Elvis series, including Eight Elvises (1963) and Triple Elvis (1963). These works, along with a series of portraits of Elizabeth Taylor, were exhibited later that year at his second exhibition at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. In November 1963, Warhol relocated his studio to 231 East 47th Street, which became known as the Factory.\nWarhol was among the artists commissioned to create an artwork for the New York State Pavilion at the 1964 World's Fair in Queens, New York. He created the mural Thirteen Most Wanted Men (1964), which was painted over after government officials objected to the images before the fair opened in April 1964.\nWarhol had his second exhibition at the Stable Gallery in the spring of 1964, which featured sculptures of commercial boxes stacked and scattered throughout the space to resemble a warehouse. For the exhibition, Warhol custom ordered wooden boxes and silkscreened graphics onto them. The sculptures—Brillo Box, Del Monte Peach Box, Heinz Tomato Ketchup Box, Kellogg's Cornflakes Box, Campbell's Tomato Juice Box and Mott's Apple Juice Box—sold for $200 to $400 depending on the size of the box.\nA pivotal event in Warhol's career was The American Supermarket exhibition at Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery in late 1964. The show was presented as a typical small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by prominent pop artists of the time, among them sculptor Claes Oldenburg, Mary Inman and Bob Watts. Warhol designed a $12 paper shopping bag—plain white with a red Campbell's soup can. His painting of a can of a Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for three for $18, $6.50 each. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.\nWarhol used assistants to increase his productivity and these collaborations would remain a defining and controversial aspect of his working methods throughout his career. One of Warhol's most important collaborators during this period was Gerard Malanga who assisted him with the production of silkscreens and films at the Factory, Warhol's studio that was covered in aluminium foil and painted silver by Billy Name.\nIn November 1964, Warhol's first Flowers series exhibited at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York. In May 1965, his second Flowers series, which had more sizes and color variation that the previous, was shown at Galerie Ileana Sonnabend in Paris. During this trip Warhol announced that he was retiring from painting to focus on film.\nFrom the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, Warhol surrounded himself with a retinue of bohemian and counterculture eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation \"superstars\", including Baby Jane Holzer, Brigid Berlin, Ondine, Edie Sedgwick, Ingrid Superstar, Nico, International Velvet, Mary Woronov, Viva, Ultra Violet, Joe Dallesandro, Candy Darling, Holly Woodlawn, Jackie Curtis and Jane Forth. These people participated in the Factory films, and some—like Berlin—remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer John Giorno and filmmaker Jack Smith, also appear in Warhol films of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time. Less well known was his support and collaboration with several teenagers during this era, who would achieve prominence later in life, including writer David Dalton, photographer Stephen Shore, and artist Bibbe Hansen.\n\nThe experimental rock group the Velvet Underground was taken on by Warhol around the end of 1965. In his capacity as their manager, he included them as a key component of his Exploding Plastic Inevitable multimedia happenings in 1966 and 1967, and he funded their debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967).\nWarhol made a conscious decision to oppose conventional painting, stating that he no longer believed in painting. In response to art dealer Ivan Karp's suggestion to paint cows, Warhol produced Cow Wallpaper, which covered the walls of the Leo Castelli Gallery during his April 1966 exhibition.\nIn November 1966, Warhol was hired by the Abraham & Straus department store in Brooklyn to promote the \"Paint-your-own-dress\" collection by the Mars Manufacturing Company, which included a white paper dress that came with a paintbrush and a box of watercolors. In a live demonstration, Warhol decorated two dresses at the store that were given to the Brooklyn Museum using Nico as his model.\nIn 1967, Warhol established Factory Additions for his printmaking and publishing enterprise. To duplicate prints for a wide audience, Factory Additions published multiple portfolios of ten images each in editions of 250. These were then printed using professional screen printers.\nWarhol intended to present the film Chelsea Girls (1966) at the 1967 Cannes Film Festival, but it wasn't shown because \"the festival authorities explained that the film was too long, there were technical problems.\"\nTo finance his film productions, Warhol began going on college lecture tours, where he screened some of his underground films and answered audience questions. Warhol sent actor Allen Midgette to impersonate him during a West Coast college tour in October 1967. Warhol reimbursed the four institutions where he did not appear and returned to the campuses in 1968.\nIn February 1968, Warhol's first solo museum exhibition was mounted at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm.\n1968 assassination attempt\n\nOn June 3, 1968, radical feminist writer Valerie Solanas shot Warhol and Mario Amaya, art critic and curator, at the Factory. Solanas had been a marginal figure in the Factory scene before the shooting. She authored the SCUM Manifesto, a separatist feminist tract that advocated the elimination of men; and appeared in the Warhol film I, a Man (1967). Amaya received only minor injuries and was released from the hospital later the same day. Warhol was seriously wounded by the attack and barely survived: he remained in hospital for nearly two months. Solanas turned herself in to the police a few hours after the attack and said that Warhol \"had too much control over my life.\" She was subsequently diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and eventually sentenced to three years in prison.\nJed Johnson, an assistant who was present at the Factory during the shooting, visited Warhol daily at the hospital, and the two developed an intimate relationship.  Shortly after Warhol was discharged, Johnson moved in with him to aid in his recovery and to help care for Warhol's ailing mother. During Warhol's hospitalization that summer, Paul Morrissey assumed primary filmmaking responsibilities and directed his first film, Flesh (1968), starring Joe Dallesandro.\nThe assassination attempt had a profound effect on Warhol's life and art. Complications from a second operation the following year left his abdominal muscles improperly repaired, requiring him to wear a surgical corset for the rest of his life to prevent his stomach from distending when he ate. The Factory became more regulated, and Warhol focused on making it a business enterprise. He credited Morrissey with transforming the Factory into a \"regular office.\"\nPost-shooting\nIn August 1968, Warhol made an appearance in court after Phillip \"Fufu\" Van Scoy Smith, an investor in a canceled film adaptation of the Charlotte Brontë novel Jane Eyre, sued him for $80,000. A legal battle ensued for 2 years, ending after the backer failed to show up in court.\nWarhol reemerged on the public social scene that fall. In September 1968, he and Ultra Violet attended a party celebrating the completion of the film Midnight Cowboy. The film includes a party scene featuring members of the Factory that was shot during Warhol's hospitalization. That same month, Warhol hosted a party at the Factory for the release of Nico's album The Marble Index. Warhol, Viva, and Ultra Violet also appeared on the cover of The New York Times Magazine on November 10, 1968.\nIn February 1969, Warhol and his entourage traveled to Los Angeles to discuss a prospective movie deal with Columbia Pictures. Warhol, who had always had an interest in photography, used a Polaroid camera to document his recuperation after the shooting. A few of his photographs were published in the May 1969 edition of Esquire magazine. He would become well known for always carrying his Polaroid camera to chronicle his encounters. Eventually, he used instant photography as the basis for his silkscreen portraits when he resumed painting in the 1970s.\nAfter the release of the erotic film Blue Movie (1969), Warhol rented the Fortune Theater at 62 East 4th Street, where he screened male pornographic films from June 25 to August 5, 1969. The project was managed by Gerard Malanga under his business, Poetry on Film. The theater was called \"Andy Warhol's Theater: Boys to Adore Galore.\" Morrissey came up with the idea to rent the theater and set the admission price at $5.\nWarhol and British journalist John Wilcock founded Interview magazine in the fall of 1969. The magazine was initially published as inter/VIEW: A Monthly Film Journal. It was revamped a few years later and came to represent Warhol's social life and fascination with celebrity.\nIn 1969, Warhol received an invitation to curate an exhibition using items from the permanent collection of the Rhode Island School of Design Museum in Providence. In October 1969, the exhibition Raid the Icebox opened at Rice University's Institute for the Arts in Houston. In 1970, the show traveled to the Isaac Delgado Museum in New Orleans before arriving at the RISD Museum.\n\n\n1970s\nCompared to the success and scandal of Warhol's work in the 1960s, the early 1970s were much quieter years, as he became more entrepreneurial. He was generally regarded as quiet, shy and a meticulous observer. Art critic Robert Hughes called him \"the white mole of Union Square\". His fashion evolved from what Warhol called his \"leather look\" to his \"Brooks Brothers look,\" which included a Brooks Brothers shirt and tie, DeNoyer blazer, and Levi jeans.\nAs Warhol continued to forge into filmmaking, he had established himself as \"one of the most celebrated and well-known pop art figures to emerge from the sixties.\" The Pasadena Art Museum in Pasadena organized a major retrospective of his work in 1970. The show traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, The Netherlands; Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; Tate Gallery, London; and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. The Whitney exhibition in 1971 distinctly featured Warhol's Cow Wallpaper (1966) as the backdrop for his paintings.\nIn May 1971, Warhol's theater production, Andy Warhol's Pork, opened at the La MaMa Experimental Theatre in New York. In August 1971, it was brought to the Roundhouse in London.\n\nIn late 1971, Warhol and his business partner Paul Morrissey purchased Eothen, an oceanfront estate in Montauk, New York on Long Island. They began renting the main house on the property in 1972. Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy, The Rolling Stones, Elizabeth Taylor, Truman Capote, and Halston were among the estate's guests.\nWarhol is credited with both the cover concept and photography for The Rolling Stones' album Sticky Fingers (1971). He received a Grammy nomination for Best Album Cover at the 14th Annual Grammy Awards in 1972. \nIn 1972, Warhol planned the Halston runway presentation at the Coty Awards. Although Warhol was considered to be apolitical, he participated in an exhibition with the poster Vote McGovern (1972) in effort to raise funds for George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign.\nWarhol and his live-in boyfriend Jed Johnson got a dachshund puppy, Archie, in November 1972. Warhol doted on Archie and took him everywhere: to the studio, parties, restaurants, and on trips to Europe. He created portraits of Johnson, Archie, and Amos—a second dachshund they got a few years later.\nWarhol began traveling to Europe more frequently and developed a fondness for Paris. Warhol had an apartment that he shared with his business manager Fred Hughes on the Left Bank of Paris on Rue du Cherche-Midi.\nIn October 1972, Warhol's work was included in the inaugural show at the Art Museum of South Texas in Corpus Christi, Texas. Between 1972 and 1973, Warhol created a series of portraits of Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong with funding from two New York galleries, Knoedler & Co. and the Leo Castelli Gallery, as well as art collector Peter Brant. In February 1974, the Mao portraits were installed at the Musée Galliera in Paris.\nIn 1974, Warhol and Johnson moved into a Neo-Georgian townhouse at 57 East 66th Street in Manhattan's Lenox Hill neighborhood. By this time, Warhol's public presence had increased significantly due to his attendance at parties. In 1974, he said, \"I try to go around so often so much and try to go to every party so that they'll be bored with me and stop writing about me.\"\n\nWarhol designed the sets for the Broadway musical Man on the Moon by John Philips of the Mamas & the Papas, which opened in January 1975 at the Little Theatre in New York. In May 1975, Warhol attended President Gerald Ford's state dinner in honor of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, at the White House. In September 1975, he went on an eight-city U.S. book tour for his book The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B & Back Again), followed by stops in Italy, France, and England.\nIn 1976, Warhol and painter Jamie Wyeth were commissioned to paint each other's portraits by the Coe Kerr Gallery in Manhattan. In January 1977, Warhol traveled to Kuwait for the opening of his exhibition at the Dhaiat Abdulla Al Salem Gallery. In June 1977, Warhol was invited to a special reception honoring the \"Inaugural Artists\" who had contributed prints to the Jimmy Carter presidential campaign. In 1977, Warhol was commissioned by art collector Richard Weisman to create Athletes, ten portraits consisting of the leading athletes of the day.\n\nThe opening of Studio 54 in 1977 ushered in a new era in New York City nightlife. Warhol would often socialize at Studio 54 and take note of the drug-fueled activities that his friends engaged in at parties. In 1977, Warhol began taking nude photographs of men in various poses and performing sexual acts—referred to as \"landscapes\"—for what became known as the Torsos and Sex Parts series. Most of the men were street hustlers and male prostitutes brought to the Factory by Halston's lover Victor Hugo. This caused tension in Warhol's relationship with Johnson who did not approve of his friendship with Hugo. \"When Studio 54 opened things changed with Andy. That was New York when it was at the height of its most decadent period, and I didn't take part. I never liked that scene, I was never comfortable. … Andy was just wasting his time, and it was really upsetting. … He just spent his time with the most ridiculous people,\" said Johnson.\nIn 1979, Warhol formed a publishing company, Andy Warhol Books, and released the book Exposures, which contained his photographs of famous friends and acquaintances. In November 1979, he embarked on a three-week book tour in the US.\nWarhol devoted much of his time to rounding up new, rich patrons for portrait commissions—including Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, his wife Empress Farah Pahlavi, his sister Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, Mick Jagger, Liza Minnelli, Diana Ross and Brigitte Bardot. In November 1979, the Whitney Museum of American Art mounted the exhibition Andy Warhol: Portraits of the 70s. Some critics disliked the exhibition of personalities and celebrities, calling them superficial, facile and commercial, with no depth or indication of the significance of the subjects.\n\n\n1980s\nWarhol had a re-emergence of critical and financial success in the 1980s, partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a number of prolific younger artists, who were dominating the \"bull market\" of 1980s New York art: Jean-Michel Basquiat, Julian Schnabel, David Salle and other so-called Neo-Expressionists, as well as members of the Transavantgarde movement in Europe, including Francesco Clemente and Enzo Cucchi. Warhol also earned street credibility and graffiti artist Fab Five Freddy paid homage to him by painting an entire train with Campbell soup cans.His 1980 exhibition Ten Portraits of Jews of the Twentieth Century at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan was panned by critics. Warhol—who was uninterested in Judaism and Jews—had described in his diary as \"They're going to sell.\"\nThe New York Academy of Art was founded in part by Warhol. First established in 1980, the institute's mission was to \"revive traditional methods of training artists.\" According to fellow co-founder Stuart Pivar, \"What happened was that Modernism got boring [for Warhol] ... But his overall game plan, what he really believed, was that the modern age was going away and that we were entering a neoclassical period.\"\nIn 1981, Warhol worked on a project with Peter Sellars and Lewis Allen that would create a traveling stage show called, A No Man Show, with a life-sized animatronic robot in the exact image of Warhol. The Andy Warhol Robot would then be able to read Warhol's diaries as a theatrical production. Warhol was quoted as saying, \"I'd like to be a machine, wouldn't you?\"\nWarhol also had an appreciation for intense Hollywood glamour. He once said: \"I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They're so beautiful. Everything's plastic, but I love plastic. I want to be plastic.\" Warhol occasionally walked the fashion runways and did product endorsements, represented by Zoli Agency and later Ford Models.\nIn 1983, Warhol was commissioned to create a poster for the centennial of the Brooklyn Bridge. The poster was his contribution to the 1983 New York Art Expo.\nWarhol created a series of endangered species silkscreen prints for his exhibition Warhol's Animals: Species at Risk at New York City's American Museum of Natural History in April 1983. Warhol donated 10 of the 150 sets he made to wildlife organizations \"so they could sell them to raise money.\"\nPrior to the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics, he teamed with 15 other artists, including David Hockney and Cy Twombly, and contributed a Speed Skater print to the Art and Sport collection. The Speed Skater was used for the official Sarajevo Winter Olympics poster.\nIn 1984, Vanity Fair commissioned Warhol to produce a portrait of Prince, to accompany an article that celebrated the success of Purple Rain and its accompanying movie. Referencing the many celebrity portraits produced by Warhol across his career, Orange Prince (1984) was created using a similar composition to the Marilyn \"Flavors\" series from 1962, among some of Warhol's first celebrity portraits. Prince is depicted in a pop color palette commonly used by Warhol, in bright orange with highlights of bright green and blue. The facial features and hair are screen-printed in black over the orange background.\nIn September 1985, Warhol's joint exhibition with Basquiat, Paintings, opened to negative reviews at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery. That month, despite apprehension from Warhol, his silkscreen series Reigning Queens was shown at the Leo Castelli Gallery. In the Andy Warhol Diaries, Warhol noted: \"They were supposed to be only for Europe—nobody here cares about royalty and it'll be another bad review.\"\nIn January 1987, Warhol traveled to Milan for the opening of his last exhibition, Last Supper, at the Palazzo delle Stelline. The next month, Warhol modeled with jazz musician Miles Davis for Koshin Satoh's fashion show at the Tunnel in New York City on February 17, 1987.\n\n\nDeath\nWarhol was initially diagnosed with a gallstone in 1973, but he adamantly rejected surgery because he feared hospitals. When he was insistent about avoiding surgery, his internist Denton Cox attempted to obtain an experimental medication from Japan. The artist also sought guidance from a chiropractor and nutritionist, who suggested that he wear a small crystal. Dehydrated and unable to eat, Warhol was in excruciating pain by February 1987.\nWarhol was admitted to New York Hospital in Manhattan on February 20, and he underwent gallbladder surgery on February 21. His surgeon Bjorn Thorbjarnarson found his gallbladder \"on the verge of perforating\" and in danger of \"spilling the infection into (Warhol's) belly.\" Warhol was awake and able to walk about, make phone calls, and watch television when both of his doctors visited him after the four-hour operation. His private nurse, Min Cho, saw his growing pallor at 4:30 the following morning, but she did not call the hospital's cardiac-arrest team until 5:45 am, when he was \"unresponsive\" and turning blue. He was pronounced dead at 6:31 a.m. from sudden cardiac arrhythmia.\n\nWarhol's brothers took his body back to Pittsburgh, where an open-casket wake was held at the Thomas P. Kunsak Funeral Home. The solid bronze casket had gold-plated rails and white upholstery. Warhol was dressed in a black cashmere suit, a paisley tie, and a platinum wig. He was laid out holding a small prayer book and a red rose. The funeral liturgy was held at the Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church on Pittsburgh's North Side on February 26, 1987. Monsignor Peter Tay delivered the eulogy. After the liturgy, the casket, covered with white roses and asparagus ferns, was driven to St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery in Bethel Park, a south suburb of Pittsburgh, where Warhol was buried near his parents. The priest said a brief prayer at the graveside and sprinkled holy water on the casket. Before the casket was lowered, Warhol's close friend and Interview staffer Paige Powell placed copies of the February and March issues and a bottle of Beautiful Eau de Parfum by Estée Lauder into his grave.\nA memorial service for Warhol was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan on April 1, 1987. It was attended by over 2,000 people, including Warhol collaborators and numerous celebrities such as Raquel Welch, Debbie Harry, Liza Minnelli, Claus von Bülow, and Calvin Klein, among others. Eulogies were given by John Richardson and Yoko Ono. Afterwards, there was a luncheon at the Diamond Horseshoe nightclub beneath the Paramount Hotel.\n\n\nWrongful death lawsuit\nIn April 1987, the New York State Health Department released a report that Warhol was given inadequate care by New York Hospital from the time he was admitted until the hours before his death. These included not performing the appropriate work-up tests prior to surgery, giving Warhol antibiotics to which he may have experienced an allergic response, causing him to become overhydrated, and repeatedly failing to take accurate notes on his chart. There were no issues with the procedure itself, according to the report. In response, the hospital dismissed the private nurse who had been employed to care for Warhol and penalized the staff nurse who had been tasked with overseeing her. However, the hospital claimed that the nursing deficiencies were not significant enough to cause Warhol's death.\nIn December 1991, Warhol's family sued the hospital in the New York Supreme Court for inadequate care, before judge Ira Gammerman, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and water intoxication. The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.\nPrior to his surgery, doctors expected Warhol to survive, though a re-evaluation of the case about thirty years after his death showed many indications that Warhol's surgery was in fact riskier than originally thought. It was widely reported at the time that Warhol had died of a \"routine\" surgery, though when considering factors such as his age, a family history of gallbladder problems, his previous gunshot wound, and his medical state in the weeks leading up to the procedure, the potential risk of death following the surgery appeared to have been significant.\n\n\nArt works\n\n\nPaintings and prints\nBy the beginning of the 1960s, pop art was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as Roy Lichtenstein, would later become synonymous with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the \"Pope of Pop\", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from cartoons and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists such as Willem de Kooning.\nFrom these beginnings, he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol was an early adopter of the silkscreen printmaking process as a technique for making paintings. His later drawings were traced from slide projections. Warhol had several assistants through the years, including Gerard Malanga, Ronnie Cutrone, and George Condo, who produced his silkscreen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.\nWarhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bonwit Teller's window display. For his first major exhibition in 1962, Warhol painted his famous cans of Campbell's soup, which he claimed to have had for lunch for 20 years. Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills, mushroom clouds, electric chairs, cans, Coca-Cola bottles, and celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley and Elizabeth Taylor, as well as newspaper headlines. His work became popular and controversial. Warhol had this to say about Coca-Cola:\n\nWhat's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca-Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca-Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca-Cola, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good.  In 1962, Warhol created his famous Marilyn series. The Flavor Marilyns were selected from a group of fourteen canvases in the sub-series. Some of the canvases were named after Life Savers candy flavors and others are identified by their background colors. Warhol produced both comic and serious works; his subject could be a soup can or an electric chair. Warhol used the same techniques—silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors—whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes and disasters, as in the 1962–63 Death and Disaster series.\nIn 1970, screenprinting materials from Warhol's 1960s studio were taken to Europe to produce a new series of prints under the name \"Sunday B Morning.\" Warhol initially signed and numbered one edition of 250, but after a dispute with some studio employees, unauthorized unsigned editions were produced in Brussels using the same photo negatives and color codes he had provided. These later prints were stamped \"Sunday B Morning\" or \"Add Your Own Signature Here,\" and some carried Warhol's disclaimer, \"This is not by me, Andy Warhol.\" The most widely known of these are the 1967 Marilyn Monroe portfolio prints, which continued to be produced into the 2010s. Sunday B Morning editions have also been issued for other works, including Flowers, Campbell's Soup I, Campbell's Soup Cans II, Gold Marilyn Monroe, and Dollar Bill. Early versions bore black stamps on the verso, shifting to blue by the 1980s.\n\nIn the 1970s, Warhol evolved into a portraiture artist, painting commissioned portraits of celebrities and socialites. The last portrait he made at the old Factory at 33 Union Square West, in 1974, was of his mother, Julia Warhola, who had died two years earlier. In the new Factory at 860 Broadway, he left behind the finger-painting and gestural complexity of his 1972–74 works for a cleaner, more streamlined style—echoing the shift from the old studio's clutter to the new one's openness. Many of the portraits Warhol produced between 1975 and 1976, share a soft, pastel look, with distant eyes under washes of azure, mint, or lavender. This style defined his portrayals of Mick Jagger, Joe MacDonald, Roy Lichtenstein, Marilyn Karp, Marcia Weisman, Doda Voridis, Tina Freeman, and Carole Coleman.\nWarhol wasn't only painting commissioned portraits—though some non-portrait works were still dealer-commissioned before he began them. His studio production returned to mid-sixties levels, with the same intensity and volume. After the Mao series (1972–73), he created Hand Colored Flowers 1974, a portfolio of 10 flower prints, silkscreened in black and hand watercolored. In 1975, Warhol completed the Ladies and Gentlemen series, followed by Cats and Dogs in 1976 and the Skulls series later that year. In 1977, he debuted his Torsos series, and subsequently began Shadows (1978–79).\nIn 1979, Warhol was commissioned to paint a BMW M1 Group 4 racing version for the fourth installment of the BMW Art Car project. He was initially asked to paint a BMW 320i in 1978, but the car model was changed and it didn't qualify for the race that year. Warhol was the first artist to paint directly onto the automobile himself instead of letting technicians transfer a scale-model design to the car. Reportedly, it took him only 23 minutes to paint the entire car. Racecar drivers Hervé Poulain, Manfred Winkelhock and Marcel Mignot drove the car at the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans.\nHis oxidation paintings, also known as \"piss paintings,\" such as Jean-Michel Basquiat (1982),  are also noteworthy in this context. It's also important to notice the way these works—and their means of production—mirrored the atmosphere at Warhol's Factory. Former Interview editor Bob Colacello recalled that Victor Hugo was a \"ghost pisser\" on the Oxidations, urinating on canvases primed with copper paint by Warhol and Ronnie Cutrone—whose vitamin B, Warhol said, made the colors prettier. Warhol sometimes used his own urine early on, along with various visitors who found it amusing to help him paint.\n\nAfter many years of silkscreening, oxidation, and photography, Warhol returned to painting with a brush in hand. In 1983, Warhol began collaborating with artists Jean-Michel Basquiat and Francesco Clemente. Warhol and Basquiat created a series of more than 50 large collaborative works between 1984 and 1985. Despite criticism when these were first shown, Warhol called some of them \"masterpieces.\"\nIn 1985, Warhol used Amiga computers to generate digital art, including the short film You Are the One. He also did a demonstration on live TV with singer Debbie Harry as a model.\nWarhol was commissioned by gallerist Alexander Iolas to produce work based on Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. His Last Supper exhibition opened shortly before his death in 1987. It is the largest series of religious-themed works by an American artist. In the period just before his death, Warhol was also working on Cars, a series of paintings for Mercedes-Benz.\n\n\nDrawings\nAlthough Warhol is best known for his work in printmaking, particularly silkscreen, he was also a highly skilled illustrator and draughtsman. His early drawings on paper convey a sense of ease and immediacy, drawing on techniques related to blind contour and continuous line drawing. As a commercial artist, Warhol pioneered the \"blotted line\" technique, in which ink was applied to paper and blotted while still wet—a process akin to rudimentary printmaking. Using tracing paper and ink, he was able to repeat basic images and generate numerous variations on a single motif.\nAmong the best known of these early works are his shoe illustrations. Some of his personal drawings were self-published in small booklets, including Yum, Yum, Yum (food-themed), Ho, Ho, Ho (Christmas-themed), and Shoes, Shoes, Shoes. His most critically acclaimed book of drawings is A Gold Book, a collection of sensitive drawings of young men, distinguished by the use of gold leaf decorating its pages. The drawings from his later years demonstrate the skill and technique that have been refined over the course of his illustrious career.\n\n\nSculptures\nWarhol's most well-known sculptures are his Brillo boxes—silkscreen ink on wood replicas of the large branded cardboard boxes used to hold 24 packages of Brillo soap pads. The original Brillo design was by commercial artist James Harvey. Warhol's Brillo boxes were part of a series of \"grocery carton\" works that also included Heinz ketchup and Campbell's tomato juice boxes. Other famous works include the Silver Clouds—helium filled, silver mylar, pillow-shaped balloons. A Silver Cloud was included in the traveling exhibition Air Art (1968–1969) curated by Willoughby Sharp. Clouds was also adapted by Warhol for avant-garde choreographer Merce Cunningham's dance piece RainForest (1968).\nWarhol's Invisible Sculpture made in 1980 consisted of burglar alarms placed around the perimeter of a room at the Factory and aimed toward an empty center. When a visitor stepped into the center point, all the alarms were triggered simultaneously. A version of Invisible Sculpture without the burglar alarms was installed at New York's Area nightclub in 1984 as part of its \"Art\" theme.\n\n\nArt market\nDuring Warhol's lifetime, his work was initially modestly priced. In 1965, large paintings from the Flowers series sold for approximately $6,000, while smaller versions were available for as little as $400. By the 1970s, Warhol had established a lucrative portrait practice, charging $25,000 for a commissioned portrait, with a discounted rate of $40,000 for two portraits.\nWarhol's market began to gain momentum at auction during his lifetime. In 1970, Campbell's Soup Can with Peeling Label (1962) sold for $60,000 at Parke-Bernet Galleries, then the highest price ever paid at public auction for a work by a living American artist. In 1978, 19 Cents (1962) sold for $95,000—setting a new auction record for Warhol—after having originally been purchased for $1,300 in 1962.\nFollowing Warhol's death in 1987, the value of his work continued to rise significantly, establishing him as one of the most consistently high-performing artists in the global art market. In 2014 alone, Warhol's works generated approximately $569 million at auction, accounting for more than one-sixth of the global art market that year. Despite occasional downturns, his market has demonstrated long-term resilience. Art dealer Dominique Lévy characterized Warhol's market as \"a seesaw being pulled uphill,\" noting that while prices fluctuate, each successive peak and decline occurs at a higher level than the previous one. She attributed this pattern to the continual influx of new collectors, observing that different generations and demographics periodically enter the market, driving renewed demand before stabilizing and giving way to the next cycle of interest.\nWarhol's celebrity imagery commands high prices, and Marilyn Monroe remains one of his most iconic subjects. In 1998, Orange Marilyn (1964) sold for $17.3 million, setting a new record at the time for the highest price paid for a Warhol work. The artist's market continued to strengthen in the 2000s. In 2007, collectors Stefan Edlis and Gael Neeson sold Turquoise Marilyn (1964) to financier Steven A. Cohen in a private transaction reportedly valued at $80 million. In May 2007, Green Car Crash (Green Burning Car I) (1963) realized $71.1 million at Christie's, while Lemon Marilyn (1962) sold for $28 million in the same auction. In November 2009, 200 One Dollar Bills (1962) sold for $43.8 million at Sotheby's.\nThe Elvis series remains among Warhol's most important bodies of work; of the 22 versions produced, eleven are held in museum collections. Eight Elvises (1963), depicting Elvis Presley in a gunslinger pose, was sold privately in 2008 by Annibale Berlingieri for approximately $100 million. Related works have also achieved strong results at auction, including Double Elvis (Ferus Type), which sold for $37 million at Sotheby's in 2012, and Triple Elvis (Ferus Type), which sold for $81.9 million at Christie's in 2014.\nPortraits of Elizabeth Taylor have also been highly sought after. In 2007, Liz (Colored Liz) (1963), formerly owned by actor Hugh Grant, sold for $23.7 million at Christie's. In November 2010, Men in Her Life (1962) sold for $63.4 million at Phillips de Pury, while Coca-Cola (4) (1962) sold for $35.3 million at Sotheby's. In May 2011, Liz No. 5 (Early Colored Liz) sold for $26.9 million at Phillips. In May 2015, Silver Liz (1963, diptych) sold for $28 million, while Colored Mona Lisa (1963) achieved $56.2 million at Christie's.\nWarhol's self-portraits have likewise performed strongly at auction. In May 2010, a purple self-portrait from 1986, formerly owned by fashion designer Tom Ford, sold for $32.6 million at Sotheby's.  In May 2011, Warhol's earliest self-portrait from 1963 to 1964 sold for $38.4 million at Christie's, while a red self-portrait from 1986 realized $27.5 million at the same auction house.\nSeveral major sales in the early 2010s further cemented Warhol's status as one of the most valuable artists in the world. In November 2013, Warhol's rarely exhibited diptych Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster) (1963) sold for $105.4 million at Sotheby's, setting a new auction record for the artist at the time. That same month, Coca-Cola (3) (1962) sold for $57.3 million at Christie's. In May 2014, White Marilyn (1962), which sold for $41 million at Christie's in May 2014, and Four Marlons (1964), a portrait of Marlon Brando, which realized $69.6 million at Christie's in November 2014.\nWarhol's market continued to expand globally in the late 2010s and early 2020s. That same year, hedge fund manager  Kenneth C. Griffin reportedly purchased Orange Marilyn in a private sale for approximately $200 million. In March 2022, Silver Liz (Ferus Type) sold for ¥2.3 billion ($18.9 million) at Shinwa Auction, setting a new auction record in Japan. In May 2022, Shot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) sold for $195 million at Christie's, becoming the most expensive American artwork ever sold at auction.\n\n\nCollectors\nEmily and Burton Tremaine were among Warhol's earliest collectors and most influential supporters. They acquired more than 15 of his works, including Marilyn Diptych (1962), now in the collection of Tate Modern in London, and A Boy for Meg (1962), now held by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC; both were purchased directly from Warhol's studio in 1962. In appreciation of their support and encouragement, Warhol once left a small Head of Marilyn Monroe at the Tremaines' New York apartment as a Christmas gift.\nRobert Scull and Ethel Scull were also early and significant patrons of Warhol's work. Ethel Scull became the subject of Warhol's first commissioned portrait, Ethel Scull 36 Times (1963), which is now part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection.\n\n\nBusiness art\nWarhol was a fan of \"Business Art\", as he stated in his book The Philosophy of Andy Warhol from A to B and Back Again: \"I went into business art. I wanted to be an art business man or a business artist. Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art,\" he said. His transformation into a mere business artist was a point of criticism. In hindsight, however, some critics have come to view Warhol's superficiality and commerciality as \"the most brilliant mirror of our times\", contending that \"Warhol had captured something irresistible about the zeitgeist of American culture in the 1970s.\"\nIn addition to his paintings and drawings, Warhol directed and produced films, managed the Velvet Underground, and authored numerous books, as well as producing works in such diverse media as audio, photography, sculpture, theater, fashion and performance art. His ability to blur the lines between art, commerce, and everyday life was central to his creative philosophy. \"That's probably the greatest thing about Warhol: the way he penetrated and summarized our world, to the point that distinguishing between him and our everyday life is basically impossible, and in any case useless,\" said artist Maurizio Cattelan.\n\n\nFilmography\n\nBetween 1963 and 1968, Warhol made more than 600 underground films, including short black-and-white \"screen test\" portraits of Factory visitors. Many of his films premiered at the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre in Greenwich Village and 55th Street Playhouse in Midtown Manhattan.\nHis early experimental films were silent observations of very typical daily life. Sleep (1964) monitors poet John Giorno sleeping for six hours. Kiss (1964) shows various couples kissing. The film Eat (1964) consists of an artist Robert Indiana eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. The 35-minute film Blow Job (1964) is one continuous shot of the face of DeVeren Bookwalter supposedly receiving oral sex from poet Willard Maas, although the camera never tilts down to prove this.\nFor these efforts, Mekas presented Warhol with the Independent Film Award of 1964, which was \"the underground's answer to Oscar.\" Newsday's Mike McGrady hailed Warhol as \"the Cecil B. DeMille of the Off-Hollywood movie makers.\" The Village Voice called him one of the \"most exciting\" filmmakers in New York.\nIn 1964 Warhol produced and directed Batman Dracula without the permission of DC Comics. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the Batman series, Warhol's movie was an \"homage\" and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly campy Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis.\nWarhol's 1965 film Empire is an eight-hour view of the Empire State Building, and shortly after he released Vinyl (1965), an adaptation of Anthony Burgess' popular dystopian novel A Clockwork Orange. His other films show improvised conversations between Factory regulars such as Taylor Mead, Brigid Berlin, Edie Sedgwick, Ondine, Nico, and International Velvet.\n\nHis film Chelsea Girls (1966) was the first underground film of the 1960s to reach widespread popularity and capture the attention of film critics. The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two 16 mm-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that \"story\" while it was lowered for the other.\nThe controversial film Blue Movie (1969)—in which Warhol superstars Viva and Louis Waldon make love in bed—was Warhol's last film as director. It is a seminal film in the Golden Age of Porn, and at the time, it was controversial for its frank approach to a sexual encounter. In 2005, Blue Movie was publicly screened in New York City for the first time in more than 30 years.\nWhile Warhol recovered from a near-fatal shooting in 1968, his assistant director, Paul Morrissey, took over most of the filmmaking chores for the Factory collective. Morrissey steered the Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie exploitation fare with Flesh (1968), Trash (1970) and Heat (1972). All of these films, including Andy Warhol's Dracula (1973) and Andy Warhol's Frankenstein (1974) starred Joe Dallesandro and are now considered cult classics. The last Warhol-produced film, Bad, starred Carroll Baker and was made without either Morrissey or Dallesandro. It was directed by Warhol's boyfriend Jed Johnson, who had assisted Morrissey on several films.\nMost of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business. With assistance from Warhol in 1984, the Whitney Museum and the Museum of Modern Art began to restore his films, which are occasionally shown at museums and film festivals. In 2022, the Andy Warhol Museum announced the launch of The Warhol TV, a streaming platform that allows users to watch free museum content and to rent a selection of Warhol's films from its collection.\n\n\nTheater and television\nWarhol's play Andy Warhol's Pork, premiered at New York's La MaMa Theater in May 1971 and ran for two weeks. It was brought to the Roundhouse in London for a longer run in August 1971. Pork was based on tape-recorded conversations between Brigid Berlin and Warhol. Berlin would play Warhol tapes she had made of phone conversations between herself and her mother, socialite Honey Berlin. In 1974, Warhol designed the sets for the musical Man on the Moon.\nIn 1968, Warhol produced a TV commercial for Schrafft's Restaurants in New York City, for an ice cream dessert appropriately titled the \"Underground Sundae\". Warhol dreamed of a television special about a favorite subject of his – Nothing – that he would call Nothing Special. Later in his career he created three television shows: Fashion (1979–1980), Andy Warhol's TV (1980–1983), and the MTV series Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes (1985–1987).\n\n\nMusic and cover art\n\nIn 1963, Warhol founded The Druds, a short-lived avant-garde noise music band that featured prominent members of the New York proto-conceptual art and minimal art community.\nIn 1965, Warhol adopted the band the Velvet Underground, making them a crucial element of the Exploding Plastic Inevitable multimedia performance art show. His involvement with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer. Warhol and Paul Morrissey acted as the band's manager, introducing them to Nico, who would perform with the band at Warhol's request. While managing the Velvet Underground, Warhol would have them dressed in all black to perform in front of movies that he was also presenting.\nIn 1966, he \"produced\" their first album The Velvet Underground & Nico, as well as providing its album art. His actual participation in the album's production amounted to simply paying for the studio time.\nAfter the band's first album, Warhol and band leader Lou Reed started to disagree more about the direction the band should take, and Warhol was fired in 1967. In 1989, Reed and John Cale reunited for the first time since 1972 to write, perform, record and release the concept album Songs for Drella, as a tribute to Warhol. In October 2019, an audio tape of publicly unknown music by Reed, based on Warhol's 1975 book, The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again, was reported to have been discovered in an archive at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.\nWarhol designed many album covers for various artists beginning during his days as an illustrator in the 1950s. The album covers he designed include for I'm Still Swinging (1955) by The Joe Newman Octet, Blue Lights, Vols. 1 & 2 (1958) by Kenny Burrell, This Is John Wallowitch!!! (1964) by John Wallowitch, Sticky Fingers (1971) and Love You Live (1977) by The Rolling Stones, The Academy in Peril (1972) by John Cale, Silk Electric (1982) by Diana Ross, and Aretha (1986) by Aretha Franklin.\nIn 1984, Warhol co-directed the music video \"Hello Again\" by the Cars, and he appeared in the video as a bartender. In 1986, Warhol co-directed the music video \"Misfit\" by Curiosity Killed the Cat and he made a cameo in video.\n\n\nBooks and magazines\n\nBeginning in the late 1950s, Warhol produced several unbound portfolios of his work. In 1957, his bound book 25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy was printed by Seymour Berlin. Berlin also printed some of Warhol's other self-published books, including A Gold Book (1957) and Wild Raspberries (1959). Warhol's book A La Recherche du Shoe Perdu marked his \"transition from commercial to gallery artist\". The title is a play on words by Warhol on the title of French author Marcel Proust's À la recherche du temps perdu.  In an effort to generate work, the majority of these books were printed to be given out to people to draw attention to his illustrations.\nAfter gaining fame, Warhol \"wrote\" several books that were commercially published:\n\nAndy Warhol's Index (Book) (1967, ISBN 9780517566985) offered a portrait of Warhol's Factory scene, featuring photographs of Warhol and his circle, pop-up pages, a silver balloon, and a flexi disc with audio from Warhol's tape recordings of Nico in conversation with poet Rene Ricard. It also included three interviews.\nA, a Novel (1968, ISBN 978-0-8021-3553-7) is a literal transcription—containing spelling errors and phonetically written background noise and mumbling—of audio recordings of Ondine and several of Andy Warhol's friends hanging out at the Factory, talking, going out.\nThe Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B & Back Again) (1975, ISBN 978-0-15-671720-5), Pat Hackett did the transcriptions and text for the book based on daily phone conversations, sometimes using audio cassettes that Andy Warhol gave her. The cassettes contained conversations with Brigid Berlin and former Interview magazine editor Bob Colacello.\nExposures (1979, ISBN 9780448128504), authored by Warhol and Bob Colacello, is a book of Warhol's photographs of his famous friends with anecdotes.\nPOPism: The Warhol '60s (1980, ISBN 978-0-15-173095-7), authored by Warhol and Pat Hackett, is a retrospective view of the 1960s and the role of pop art.\nWarhol's America (1985, ISBN 978-0060960049) features Warhol's photographs gathered over a decade of travels, paired with anecdotes and wry, often unexpectedly deep reflections, presenting an idiosyncratic love letter to the United States.\nThe Andy Warhol Diaries (1989, ISBN 978-0-446-39138-2), edited by Pat Hackett, is a diary dictated by Warhol to Hackett in daily phone conversations. Warhol started the diary to keep track of his expenses after being audited, although it soon evolved to include his personal and cultural observations.\nWarhol created covers for a number of magazines, including Time and Vogue. In 1969, his launched Interview magazine, which was a film critic spread before it became a pop culture magazine in the 1972.\n\n\nPhotography and tape recordings\nWarhol used Polaroid photos as the basis for his silkscreen paintings. These pictures were mostly taken with The Big Shot camera. During the portrait session, Warhol typically shot dozens of photographs of his subject, then selected the best one that would underlie the painting. This photographic approach to painting and his snapshot method of taking pictures has had a great effect on artistic photography. Warhol was also an avid photographer and also used the Polaroid SX-70 as a portable camera. He took an enormous number of photographs of Factory visitors, friends, and celebrities; many of these have been acquired by Stanford University.\nAt one point, Warhol carried a portable tape recorder and camera wherever he went, recording nearly everything said and done. He referred to the recorder as his 'wife.' Some of these recordings became the basis for his literary work. Warhol also taped interviews for Interview magazine and regularly published his Polaroid photos in its pages. In 2015, Taschen published Andy Warhol: Polaroids 1958–1987.\n\n\nFashion\n\nWarhol is quoted for having said, \"I'd rather buy a dress and put it up on the wall, than put a painting, wouldn't you?\" Warhol has been described as a modern dandy, whose authority \"rested more on presence than on words\". His work in fashion includes department store window displays, illustrations for Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, and a career as a model.\nIn 1965, Warhol designed furs for Coopchik-Forrest. In 1966, paper dresses had gained such popularity that Brooklyn's Abraham & Straus department store invited Warhol to demonstrate decorating plain white Mars Manufacturing paper dresses, which came with brushes and watercolor sets for personal customization. During the event, he silkscreened \"FRAGILE\" onto Nico's dress as she wore it, signing it \"Dalí\" humorously, and adorned another dress with large screen-printed bananas. Both pieces were eventually donated to the Brooklyn Museum.\nWarhol formed friendships with prominent figures in the fashion industry, including former Vogue editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland, fashion designers Karl Lagerfeld, Yves Saint Laurent, Halston, Diane von Furstenberg, and Calvin Klein. In 1972, Warhol collaborated with Halston for the Coty Awards.\nIn 1997, the Whitney Museum in New York mounted the exhibition The Warhol Look: Glamour, Style, Fashion, organized by the Andy Warhol Museum.\n\n\nPublic persona\nEarly in his career, Warhol often gave reporters conflicting accounts of his background, habits, and working methods, treating the press as a study in how information spread. As he told People Weekly in 1976, \"I used to like to give different information to different magazines because it was like putting a tracer on where people get their information.\" By planting small inconsistencies, he watched how stories circulated and evolved, turning interviews into part of his ongoing play with persona, authorship, and media behavior.\nWarhol also enjoyed having others speak for him. In public, he increasingly relied on an impersonal style of communication, mirroring his impulse to distance himself from the creation of his own artwork. He often hid behind a dazed expression and flat remarks—\"gee,\" \"uh,\" \"really\"—and seemed to relish performing as a kind of \"monosyllabic oddity\" or \"Keatonesque idiot savant\" to the media. He suggested that all one needs to know about his work is \"already there on the surface.\" His boyfriend Jed Johnson said, \"He felt an artist should keep a neutral expression on his face when he showed his work to other people, that to betray pleasure or displeasure was, again 'corny.' I'd watch him at many museum and gallery openings of his shows and he followed that policy consistently.\"\n\n\nPersonal life\n\n\nSexuality and relationships\nWarhol lived as a gay man before the gay liberation movement, but he often veiled his personal life in the press. In the 1950s, Warhol submitted homoerotic drawings of male nudes to a fine art gallery, but they were rejected for being too openly gay. In his book Popism, the artist recalls a conversation with the filmmaker Emile de Antonio about the difficulty he had being accepted socially by the then-more-famous (but closeted) gay artists Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. De Antonio explained that Warhol was \"too swish and that upsets them. ... major painters try to look straight; you play up the swish—it's like an armor with you.\" In response, Warhol said: \"I'd always had a lot of fun with that—just watching the expressions on people's faces. You'd have to have seen the way all the Abstract Expressionist painters carried themselves and the kinds of images they cultivated, to understand how shocked people were to see a painter coming on swish. I certainly wasn't a butch kind of guy by nature, but I must admit, I went out of my way to play up the other extreme.\"\nThe impact of Warhol's homosexuality on his work has been extensively studied.  He expressed his queer identity through many of his artworks and films at a time when homosexuality in the United States was heavily stigmatized and legally constrained. Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Some of his most famous works—portraits of Liza Minnelli, Judy Garland, and Elizabeth Taylor and films such as Blow Job (1964), My Hustler (1965), and Lonesome Cowboys (1968)—draw from gay underground culture or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. Many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters in the 1960s.\nIn 1980, Warhol proclaimed to Forum magazine that he was still a virgin. Former Interview editor Bob Colacello felt it was probably true and that what little sex he had was probably \"a mixture of voyeurism and masturbation—to use [Warhol's] word abstract.\" However, this assertion is contradicted by Warhol's hospital treatment in 1960 for condylomata, a sexually transmitted disease. Furthermore, some of his friends claimed to have witnessed Warhol having sex and heard him boasting about his sexual relations. Production designer Charles Lisanby, whom Warhol had unrequited romantic feelings for, said Warhol told him sex was \"messy and distasteful.\" \"He told me he'd had sex a few times, he had tried it and didn't really like it,\" said Lisanby.\nDue to Warhol's own admission that he was asexual, it was assumed that all his relationships were platonic. Warhol superstar Jay Johnson, whose twin brother was Warhol's longtime partner, stated, \"He enjoyed the idea that he was considered a voyeur and that he was considered asexual. That was his mystique.\" According to photographer Billy Name, who was briefly Warhol's lover, \"Andy's idea of sex was to have it once or twice and get it over with—with Andy it wasn't about love, it was about companionship.\" He also said that Warhol's \"personality was so vulnerable that it became a defense to put up the blank front.\" Warhol referred to photographer Edward Wallowitch as his \"first boyfriend.\" He had intimate relationships with artist John Giorno, art historian Robert Pincus-Witten, and aspiring filmmaker Danny Williams. His most enduring romantic relationship was with Jed Johnson, who nursed him back to health after he was shot. Johnson collaborated with him on films and went on to achieve fame as an interior designer. They \"functioned as husband and husband, sharing a bed and a domestic life\" for 12 years. Warhol's close friend Stuart Pivar said he \"had no sex life after Jed.\" His later companions include Paramount Pictures executive Jon Gould and Factory assistant Sam Bolton.\n\n\nReligion\n\nWarhol was a practicing Ruthenian Catholic. He regularly volunteered at homeless shelters in New York City, particularly during the busier times of the year, and described himself as a religious person. In 1966, his mother Julia Warhola told Esquire magazine that he was a \"good religious boy\" and he attended one o'clock Mass at St. Paul's every Sunday. The priest at Warhol's church, Saint Vincent Ferrer, said that the artist went there almost daily, and although he was not observed taking Communion or going to Confession, he sat or knelt in the pews at the back. The priest thought he was afraid of being recognized; Warhol said he was self-conscious about being seen in a Latin Catholic church crossing himself \"in the Orthodox way\" (right to left instead of the reverse). In 1980, Warhol met Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Square.\nMany of Warhol's later works depicted religious subjects, including two series, Details of Renaissance Paintings (1984) and The Last Supper (1986). Warhol made almost 100 variations on the theme of the Last Supper, which the Guggenheim felt \"indicates an almost obsessive investment in the subject matter\". In addition, a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate.\nWarhol's art is noticeably influenced by the Eastern Christian tradition which was so evident in his places of worship. Warhol's brother has described the artist as \"really religious, but he didn't want people to know about that because [it was] private\". Despite the private nature of his faith, in Warhol's eulogy John Richardson depicted it as devout: \"To my certain knowledge, he was responsible for at least one conversion. He took considerable pride in financing his nephew's studies for priesthood\".\nFrom November 2021 to June 2022, the Brooklyn Museum displayed the Andy Warhol: Revelation exhibition. The exhibition delved at the artist's enduring connection to his faith, which was often reflected in his artwork.\n\n\nCollections\nWarhol was an avid collector and a \"pack rat\" who'd save everything. As he was relocating his Manhattan studio in 1974, Warhol began assembling Time Capsules, a modular sculpture consisting of 610 containers, each holding an average of 800 items. The majority of the containers are standard cardboard boxes, with a large trunk and forty filing cabinet drawers. This also includes the Time Capsules that Warhol created at home, which hold a plethora of personal memorabilia like letters, telephone messages, photographs, and his mother's possessions. The Time Capsules were later transferred to the Andy Warhol Museum.\nWarhol's Broadway Factory, established in 1974, was shaped in part by the presence of large Art Deco furnishings. The screening room featured a complete set of twelve bronze side chairs upholstered in red leather, designed by Edgar Brandt. The paneled executive office contained a large oval table veneered in Macassar ebony, accompanied by twelve matching chairs designed by Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann. According to Warhol, much of this furniture was originally acquired as \"used furniture,\" having previously served as props for a film production.\n\nHis collection of American items were displayed in the exhibition Andy Warhol's Folk and Funk at the Museum of American Folk Art in 1977, but few people knew the true extent of his collections until after his death. \"Andy had the peasant's wisdom that if people (either the very rich or the very poor) knew that you had anything good, they'd probably try to take it away from you. So he hid what he had. It was inconspicuous consumption,\" said Warhol's partner Jed Johnson. Warhol would wear a diamond necklace under a black turtleneck, conceal his jewelry in Famous Amos cookie tins atop the canopy of his bed, and keep wads of money in his mattress. Although Warhol did not drive, he owned a Mercedes and later a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow. When he purchased the Rolls-Royce, Johnson was under strict orders to say he traded it for art.\nJohnson organized his collections, and when Warhol realized he needed more room, Johnson found a townhouse at 57 East 66th Street in 1974. Johnson decorated the four-story townhouse, creating several ornate neoclassical period rooms. While residing with Johnson, Warhol promised to keep his shopping bags in the closets and top-floor storage rooms. However, once Johnson moved out in December 1980, the townhouse was overrun by Warhol's acquisitions. Warhol occupied a second-floor bedroom and basement kitchen when he died in February 1987; all other rooms, with the exception of the quarters for his Filipino housekeepers, sisters Nena and Aurora Bugarin, were used for storage.\nDuring the last few years of his life, Warhol was accompanied by chemist and art collector Stuart Pivar on daily shopping excursions. Pivar said they wanted \"to see if we could come across a couple a masterpieces or some amusing junk.\" According to Pivar, Warhol envisioned \"Warhol Hall\" on Madison Avenue, a massive gift shop with a museum where he would display a collection of sculptures he was assembling. Pivar regarded Warhol as the quintessential connoisseur who navigated society through flea markets, antique stores, and Christie's and Sotheby's salerooms. Fred Hughes, Warhol's business manager and estate executor, also affirmed Warhol's idea for \"Warhol Hall,\" adding that they had been thinking of setting up a flea market booth.\nIn 1988, Warhol's enormous collection was auctioned at Sotheby's in New York. Dealers and collectors were drawn to the 3,436 lots that were sold, totaling almost 10,000 items. A total of $25.3 million was accumulated during the 10-day sale. His collections included American shop signs, Coca-Cola memorabilia, 19th-century American furniture, Art Deco furniture by Jacques-Émile Ruhlmann, Jean Dunand, Jean-Michel Frank, and Pierre Legrain, carousel horses, Navajo blanket rugs, silverware by Jean Puiforcat, 175 cookie jars, 313 watches, and 332 pieces of Fiesta Ware.\nWarhol enjoyed purchasing artwork and owned a collection of 19th century sculptures by Antoine-Louis Barye, Antonio Canova, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, and Jean-Léon Gérôme. Among the paintings in his collection were George Bellows' Miss Bentham (1906), Man Ray's Peinture Feminin (1954), Roy Lichtenstein's Laughing Cat (1961), Mirror (1971), and Sailboats (1974), Jasper Johns' Screen Piece (1967), and Jean-Michel Basquiat's All Beef (1983). He also had work by Marcel Duchamp, Joseph Whiting Stock, Cy Twombly. Johnson recalled that Warhol refused to hang his own art on the walls, saying it was \"too corny\" to display your own work.\nWarhol also collected many books, with more than 1,200 titles in his collection. His collection, which reflects his eclectic taste and interests, included The Two Mrs. Grenvilles: A Novel by Dominick Dunne, Artists in Uniform by Max Eastman, D.V. by Diana Vreeland, Blood of a Poet by Jean Cocteau, Hidden Faces by Salvador Dalí, and The Dinah Shore Cookbook.\n\n\nLegacy\n\nIn 1991, the Warhol Family Museum of Modern Art was established in Medzilaborce, Slovakia by Warhol's family and the Slovak Ministry of Culture. In 1996, it was renamed the Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art.\nIn 1992, Warhol's estate donated 15 acres of land on his former property Eothen to The Nature Conservancy. Now called The Andy Warhol Preserve, it is part of a 2,400-acre protected area in Montauk.\nIn 1994, the Andy Warhol Museum opened in Pittsburgh. It holds the largest collection of the artist's works in the world.\nIn 1998, Warhol's Upper East Side townhouse at 57 E 66th Street in Manhattan was designated a cultural landmark by the Historical Landmarks Preservation Center to commemorate the 70th anniversary of his birthday.\nIn 2002, the US Postal Service issued an 18-cent stamp commemorating Warhol. Designed by Richard Sheaff of Scottsdale, Arizona, the stamp was unveiled at a ceremony at the Andy Warhol Museum and features Warhol's painting \"Self-Portrait, 1964\".\n\nIn 2005, the Seventh Street Bridge in Pittsburgh was renamed the Andy Warhol Bridge in his honor.\nA chrome statue of Andy Warhol and his Polaroid camera was displayed at Union Square in New York City from March to October 2011.\nThe International Astronomical Union named a crater on the planet Mercury after Warhol in 2012.\nIn 2013, to honor the 85th anniversary of Warhol's birthday, the Andy Warhol Museum and EarthCam launched a collaborative project titled Figment, a live feed of Warhol's gravesite.\nIn 2024, Warhol was posthumously awarded the Order of the White Double Cross of the Second Class by the Slovak Republic's ambassador to the U.S. on the 37th anniversary of his death, at the behest of Slovakian President Zuzana Čaputová, \"for promoting the Slovak Republic's good name abroad.\"\nIn 2025, Warhol was selected as one of the first 10 inductees into the Pittsburgh Walk of Fame.\n\n\nThe Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts\nWarhol's will dictated that his entire estate—with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members—would go to create a foundation dedicated to promoting the visual arts. Warhol had so many possessions that it took Sotheby's 10 days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed $25.3 million.\nIn 1987, in accordance with Warhol's will, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts was formed. The foundation serves as the estate of Andy Warhol, but also has a mission \"to foster innovative artistic expression and the creative process\" and is \"focused primarily on supporting work of a challenging and often experimental nature\".\nThe Artists Rights Society is the US copyright representative for the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts for all Warhol works with the exception of Warhol film stills. The US copyright representative for Warhol film stills is the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. Additionally, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts has agreements in place for its image archive. All digital images of Warhol are exclusively managed by Corbis, while all transparency images of Warhol are managed by Art Resource.\nThe Andy Warhol Foundation released its 20th Anniversary Annual Report as a three-volume set in 2007: Vol. I, 1987–2007; Vol. II, Grants & Exhibitions; and Vol. III, Legacy Program.\nThe Foundation is in the process of compiling its catalogue raisonné of paintings and sculptures in volumes covering blocks of years of the artist's career. Volumes IV and V were released in 2019. The subsequent volumes are still in the process of being compiled.\nThe Foundation remains one of the largest grant-giving organizations for the visual arts in the US.\nMany of Warhol's works and possessions are on display at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. The foundation donated more than 3,000 works of art to the museum.\n\n\nIn pop culture\nWarhol founded Interview, a stage for celebrities he \"endorsed\" and a business staffed by his friends. One might even say that he produced people (as in the Warholian \"Superstar\" and the Warholian portrait). Warhol endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and films.\n\n\nFilms\n\nWarhol appeared in the films Dynamite Chicken (1971), The Driver's Seat (1974), Cocaine Cowboys (1979) and Tootsie (1982).\nAfter his death, Warhol was portrayed by Crispin Glover in Oliver Stone's film The Doors (1991), by Jared Harris in Mary Harron's film I Shot Andy Warhol (1996), and by David Bowie in Julian Schnabel's film Basquiat (1996).\nWarhol appeared as a character in Michael Daugherty's opera Jackie O (1997). Actor Mark Bringleson makes a brief cameo as Warhol in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997). Many films by avant-garde cineast Jonas Mekas have caught the moments of Warhol's life. Sean Gregory Sullivan depicted Warhol in the film 54 (1998). Guy Pearce portrayed Warhol in the film Factory Girl (2007) about Edie Sedgwick's life. Actor Greg Travis portrays Warhol in a brief scene from the film Watchmen (2009). \nIn the movie Highway to Hell a group of Andy Warhols are part of the Good Intentions Paving Company where good-intentioned souls are ground into pavement. In the film Men in Black 3 (2012) Andy Warhol turns out to really be undercover MIB Agent W (played by Bill Hader). Warhol is throwing a party at The Factory in 1969, where he is encountered by MIB Agents K and J.Andy Warhol (portrayed by Tom Meeten) is one of main characters of the 2012 British television show Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy. The character is portrayed as having robot-like mannerisms.  \nIn September 2016, it was announced that Jared Leto would portray the title character in Warhol, an upcoming American biographical drama film produced by Michael De Luca and written by Terence Winter, based on the book Warhol: The Biography by Victor Bockris.\nIn the 2017 film The Billionaire Boys Club, Cary Elwes portrays Warhol in a film based on the true story about Ron Levin, a friend of Warhol's who was murdered in 1986. Comedian Conan O'Brien portrayed Warhol in the film Weird: The Al Yankovic Story (2022).\n\n\nDocumentaries\nWarhol (1973) is an ITV documentary by British photographer David Bailey.

Warhol doesn't say much save for bashful gestures and whispering \"yes\" or \"no,\" while Sedgwick mediates a conversation on how Pop Art is art without any sense of emotion.\nIn 1969, Warhol was commissioned by Braniff International to appear in two television commercials to promote the luxury airline's \"When You Got It – Flaunt It\" campaign. The campaign was created by the advertising agency Lois Holland Calloway, which was led by George Lois, creator of a famed series of Esquire covers. The first commercial series involved the unlikely paring of Warhol and heavyweight boxing champion Sonny Liston who shared the fact that they both flew Braniff Airways. The odd commercial worked and Warhol was featured in another commercial entering a Braniff jet and being greeted by a Braniff hostess, while espousing their like for flying Braniff. The rights to Warhol's films for Braniff and his signed contracts are owned by a private trust and are administered by Braniff Airways Foundation in Dallas, Texas.\nWarhol appeared on the BBC series Arena in a scene with writers William S.

Bowie recorded a song called \"Andy Warhol\" for his 1971 album Hunky Dory. Lou Reed wrote the song \"Andy's Chest\" in response to the attempted assassination of Warhol. The song was originally recorded by the Velvet Underground in 1969, but it wasn't released until a version appeared on Reed's solo album Transformer in 1972.
