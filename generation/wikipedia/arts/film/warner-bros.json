  "extract": "The name Warner Bros. and related names have been used by a collection of multinational mass media and entertainment entities descended from or associated with Warner Bros. Pictures, a major American film studio founded in 1923.\nAs of 2025, Warner Bros. Discovery owns the motion picture and television assets derived from the original Warner Bros. studio, while Warner Music Group has been independently owned since 2004. Several other entities have been spun off or sold, but no longer use the Warner name.\n\n\nHistorical overview\nWarner Bros. Pictures, Inc. was founded in 1923 by the brothers Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner. Jack Warner took full control of the company in 1956.  During this time, the company began activities in animation (Warner Bros. Cartoons), television (Warner Bros. Television Studios), and music publishing (Warner Bros. Music).\nSeven Arts Productions merged with Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. in 1967 to form Warner Bros.-Seven Arts.  Kinney National Company then purchased Warner Bros.-Seven Arts in 1969 as part of a buying spree that also included National Periodical Publications (predecessor to DC Comics), Television Communications Corporation (predecessor to Time Warner Cable), and Paperback Library (predecessor to Warner Books). After spinning off its non-media assets, Kinney National Company was renamed Warner Communications, and then Time Warner.\nIn the mid-2000s, Time Warner spun off or sold several Warner-derived or branded divisions as independent companies: it spun off Warner Music Group (which remains independent as of 2025) and Time Warner Cable (later acquired by Charter Communications), while Warner Books was sold to Hachette Livre.  During this time, the film and television assets were incorporated into a new Warner Bros. Entertainment subsidiary of Time Warner.\nTime Warner, much reduced in scope, was acquired by AT&T in 2018 and renamed WarnerMedia. AT&T then sold WarnerMedia to Discovery, Inc. to form Warner Bros. Discovery in 2022.\n\n\nList of entities derived from Warner Bros.\nThe following entities have used the Warner name and have been derived from or affiliated with the original Warner Bros.
