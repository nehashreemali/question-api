Held in Cannes, France, it previews new films of all genres, including documentaries, from all around the world. Founded in 1946, the invitation-only festival is held annually (usually in May) at the Palais des Festivals et des Congrès. The festival was formally accredited by the FIAPF in 1951. Cannes is considered one of the \"Big Three\" major European film festivals, alongside Venice and Berlin, as well as one of the \"Big Five\" major international film festivals, alongside Venice, Berlin, Toronto and Sundance.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nThe early years\n\nThe Cannes Film Festival has its origins in 1938 when Jean Zay, the French Minister of National Education, on the proposal of high-ranking official and historian Philippe Erlanger and film journalist Robert Favre Le Bret, decided to set up an international cinematographic festival. They found the support of the Americans and the British.\nThus, on 31 May 1939, the city of Cannes was finally selected as the location for the festival over Biarritz and the town hall along with the French government signed the International Film Festival's official birth certificate with the name of Le Festival International du Film.\nIts creation can be largely attributed to the French desire to compete with the Venice Film Festival, which at the time was the only international film festival and had shown a lack of impartiality with its fascist bias during those years. The political interference seemed evident in the 1937 edition when Benito Mussolini meddled to ensure that French pacifist film La Grande Illusion would not win.\nThe last straw was in the 1938 event when Mussolini and Adolf Hitler respectively overruled the jury's decision in order to award the Coppa Mussolini (Mussolini Cup) for the Best Film to Italian war film Luciano Serra, Pilot, produced under the supervision of Mussolini's son, and the Coppa Mussolini for the Best Foreign Film to Olympia, a German documentary film about the Berlin 1936 Summer Olympics produced in association with the Nazi Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda despite the fact that the regulations at that time prohibited awarding a documentary.\nOutraged by the decision and as a measure of protest, the French, British, and American jury members decided to withdraw from the festival with the intention of not returning. This snub encouraged the French to found a free festival. Thus, on 31 May 1939, the city of Cannes was finally selected as the location for the festival over Biarritz and the town hall along with the French government signed the International Film Festival's official birth certificate with the name of Le Festival International du Film.\nThe reason for choosing Cannes was because of its touristic appeal as a French Riviera resort town and also because the city hall offered to increase the municipality's financial participation, including the commitment of building a dedicated venue for the event.\nHollywood stars of the moment like Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, Tyrone Power, Douglas Fairbanks Jr.,  Marlene Dietrich, Mae West, Norma Shearer, Paul Muni, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, and George Raft arrived thanks to an Ocean liner chartered by MGM (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer). On 31 August, the opening night gala took place with the private screening of the American film The Hunchback of Notre Dame starring Charles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara and directed by William Dieterle. The next day, on 1 September, German troops invaded Poland. As a result, the festival was postponed for 10 days and it would be resumed if the circumstances allowed it. However, the situation only worsened and on 3 September, France and the United Kingdom declared war against Germany, sparking the Second World War. The French government ordered a general mobilisation and this prevented the festival from continuing so it was finally cancelled.\nIn 1946, the festival was relaunched and from 20 September to 5 October 1946, twenty-one countries presented their films at the First Cannes International Film Festival, which took place at the former Casino of Cannes. In 1947, amid serious problems of efficiency, the festival was held as the \"Festival du film de Cannes\", where films from sixteen countries were presented. The festival was not held in 1948 and 1950 due to budgetary problems.\nIn 1949, the Palais des Festivals was expressly constructed for the occasion on the seafront promenade of La Croisette, although its inaugural roof, while still unfinished, blew off during a storm. In 1951, the festival was moved to spring to avoid direct competition with the Venice Festival which was held in autumn.\n\n\n1950s and 1960s\nDuring the early 1950s, the festival attracted much tourism and press attention, with showbiz scandals and high-profile personalities' love affairs. At the same time, the artistic aspect of the festival started developing. Because of controversies over the selection of films, the Critics' Prize was created for the recognition of original films and daring filmmakers. In 1954, the Special Jury Prize was awarded for the first time. In 1955, the Palme d'Or was created, replacing the Grand Prix du Festival which had been given until that year. In 1957, Dolores del Río was the first female member of the jury for the official selection.\nIn 1959, the Marché du Film (Film Market) was founded, giving the festival a commercial character and facilitating exchanges between sellers and buyers in the film industry. Today it has become the first international platform for film commerce. Still, in the 1950s, some outstanding films, like Night and Fog in 1956 and Hiroshima, My Love in 1959 were excluded from the competition for diplomatic concerns. Jean Cocteau, three times president of the jury in those years, is quoted to have said: \"The Cannes Festival should be a no man's land in which politics has no place. It should be a simple meeting between friends.\"\nIn 1962, the International Critics' Week was born, created by the French Union of Film Critics as the first parallel section of the Cannes Film Festival. Its goal was to showcase first and second works by directors from all over the world, not succumbing to commercial tendencies. In 1965 Olivia de Havilland was named the first female president of the jury, while the next year Sophia Loren became president.\nThe 1968 festival was halted on 19 May. Some directors, such as Carlos Saura and Miloš Forman, had withdrawn their films from the competition. On 18 May filmmaker Louis Malle along with a group of directors took over the large room of the Palais and interrupted the projections in solidarity with students and labour on strike throughout France, and in protest to the eviction of the then President of the Cinémathèque Française. The filmmakers achieved the reinstatement of the President, and they founded the Film Directors' Society (SRF) that same year. In 1969 the SRF, led by Pierre-Henri Deleau created the Directors' Fortnight (Quinzaine des Réalisateurs), a new non-competitive section that programs a selection of films from around the world, distinguished by the independent judgment displayed in the choice of films.\n\n\n1970s and 1980s\nDuring the 1970s, important changes occurred in the Festival. In 1972, Robert Favre Le Bret was named the new president, and Maurice Bessy the General Delegate. He introduced important changes in the selection of the participating films, welcoming new techniques, and relieving the selection from diplomatic pressures, with films like MASH, and later Chronicle of the Years of Fire marking this turn. In some cases, these changes helped directors like Andrei Tarkovsky overcome problems of censorship in their own country. Also, until that time, the different countries chose the films that would represent them in the festival. Yet, in 1972, Bessy created a committee to select French films, and another for foreign films.\nIn 1978, Gilles Jacob assumed the position of General Delegate, introducing the Caméra d'Or award, for the best first film of any of the main events, and the Un Certain Regard section, for the non-competitive categories. Other changes were the decrease of length of the festival down to thirteen days, thus reducing the number of selected films; also, until that point the Jury was composed by Film Academics, and Jacob started to introduce celebrities and professionals from the film industry.\n\nIn 1983, a new, much bigger Palais des Festivals et des Congrès was built to host the festival, while the Directors' Fortnight remained in the old building. The new building was nicknamed \"The Bunker\", provoking much criticism, especially since it was hardly finished at the event and several technical problems occurred. In 1984, Pierre Viot replaced Robert Favre Le Bret as President of the Festival. In his term, the Festival started including films from more countries, like Philippines, China, Cuba, Australia, India, New Zealand and Argentina. In 1987, for the first time of the Festival, a red carpet was placed at the entrance of the Palais. In 1989, during the first Cinéma & liberté forum, hundred directors from many countries signed a declaration \"against all forms of censorship still existing in the world\".\n\n\n1990s to present\nIn 1998, Gilles Jacob created the last section of the Official Selection: la Cinéfondation, aiming to support the creation of works of cinema in the world and to contribute to the entry of the new scenario writers in the circle of the celebrities. The Cinéfondation was completed in 2000 with La Résidence, where young directors could refine their writing and screenplays, and in 2005, L'Atelier, which helps twenty directors per year with the funding of their films. Gilles Jacob was appointed Honorary President in 2000, and in 2002, the Festival officially adopted the name Festival de Cannes.\nDuring the 2000s, the Festival started focusing more on the technological advances taking place in the film world, especially the digital techniques. In 2004, the restored historical films of the Festival were presented as Cannes Classics, which included documentaries. In 2007, Thierry Frémaux became General Delegate. In 2009, he extended the Festival in Buenos Aires, as La Semana de Cine del Festival de Cannes, and in 2010, he created the Cannes Court Métrage for the Short Film competition.\nOn 20 March 2020, organisers announced the postponement of the 2020 edition due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; although a small line-up of films was announced as the Official Selection for commercial purposes. Shortly after, the edition was officially cancelled, since organisers refused to adopt an online strategy used by other festivals abroad. It marked the first time the festival would not take place since 1968.\nIn 2021, since the pandemic was not fully controlled in France, the festival was once again postponed for two months later, dropping its usual late May dates, while masks were enforced to all attendees except for cast and crew during the red carpet. Spike Lee, who had been chosen to lead the main competition jury in 2020, was invited again to head the main competition jury for 2021 Cannes Film Festival. Aiming to accommodate many of the productions not released in 2020, the \"Cannes Premiere\" section was created featuring a considerable amount of the festival's regular filmmakers who didn't make into the main competition. A special \"Cinema for the Climate\" section was also created, but later dropped in the following editions.\nIn 2022, the festival denied press accreditation to Russian journalists associated with outlets who are not opposed to the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. On the opening night of the festival, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, made a video appearance where he talked about the war and the role of cinema in it. The selection of Kirill Serebrennikov's Tchaikovsky's Wife, was met with criticism by European Film Academy president Agnieszka Holland, even though the Russian filmmaker had been living in exile in Germany after condemning the ongoing war. Iris Knobloch was elected the first woman president of the festival in the same year, succeeding the co-founder and former head of French pay-TV operator Canal+, Pierre Lescure, who had served since 2014. \nThe 2025 edition featured a record 45% of films directed by women. One day after the announcement of the ACID official selection, Palestinian photojournalist Fatima Hassouna, one of the main subjects of the documentary film Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk by Sepideh Farsi, was killed along with ten members of her family in an Israeli airstrike on their home in Gaza City on 16 April 2025. The festival released an official statement expressing condolences and criticising the ongoing war and violence in Gaza. On the festival's opening day, more than 350 directors, actors and producers signed a letter condemning the killing of Hassouna and denounced the ongoing genocide in Gaza.\n\n\nControversies\nIn recent years, a number of gender and sexual controversies have surrounded the Cannes Film Festival. These include \"Heelgate\" in which numerous female attendees of a red carpet premiere were stopped from entering in 2015 for wearing flat soled shoes instead of high heels. The incident caused numerous female celebrities to wear flat soled shoes or no shoes at all to other red carpet premieres in a show of solidarity and protest.\nGeneral Delegate Thierry Frémaux reportedly \"banned\" selfies on the red carpet of the festival in 2015.\nAs a result of the past sexual controversies and the #MeToo movement that arose out of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, in 2018, Cannes Film Festival officials announced the creation of a telephone hotline during the festival in which victims could report incidents of sexual harassment and other crimes. The hotline is in collaboration with the French government.\nIn 2017, along with the 70th anniversary events of the Festival, the issue of changing the rules on theatrical screening caused controversy, the festival had selected two Netflix-produced films (The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) and Okja) for its main competition. Since 2018, the enforcement of a theatrical screening window of eighteen months in France, only for main competition titles, resulted in the American streaming giant withdrawing completely from the festival, a decision maintained ever since.\n\n\nFestival team\n\nThe president of the festival, who represents the festival in front of financial partners, the public authorities and the media, is elected by the board of directors of the festival, officially named the \"French Association of the Film Festival\".\nThe board is composed of authorities of the world of cinema, as well as of public authorities which subsidise the event. The president has a renewable 3-year mandate and appoints the members of his team, including the general delegate, with the approval of the board of directors. Sometimes a president, after his last term, becomes the honorary president of the festival.\nThe general delegate is responsible for the coordination of the events. When Gilles Jacob passed from general delegate to the position of the president, in 2001, two new positions were created to take over his former post, the general director to oversee the smooth running of the event, and the artistic director, responsible for the selection of films. However, in 2007, the artistic director Thierry Frémaux, became again the general delegate of the Festival.\nThe general secretary is responsible for the reception of works and other practical matters.\n\n\nPrograms\nThe Cannes Film Festival is organised in various sections:\n\n\nOfficial Selection\nMain Competition – Usually 22 films, competing for the Palme d'Or, all of them are projected at the Grand Auditorium Louis Lumière (Théâtre Lumière), Cannes' main venue with more than 2.300 seats.\nUn Certain Regard – The festival's second most important section, featuring mostly upcoming filmmakers in their directorial debuts, competing for the Prix un certain regard.

Jill Forbes and Sarah Street argue in European Cinema: An Introduction (ISBN 0333752104), that Cannes \"became...extremely important for critical and commercial interests and for European attempts to sell films on the basis of their artistic quality\" (page 20). Forbes and Street also point out that, along with other festivals such as the Venice Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival, Cannes offers an opportunity to determine a particular country's image of its cinema and generally foster the notion that European cinema is \"art\" cinema.\nAdditionally, given massive media exposure, the non-public festival is attended by many stars and is a popular venue for film producers to launch their new films and to attempt to sell their works to the distributors who come from all over the globe.\n\n\nCannes Film Festival in fiction\nThough most of the media attention the festival receives is journalistic in nature, the festival has been explored from the standpoint of fiction by novelists over the years.\nMichael Grothaus' Epiphany Jones is a social satire about the festival and film industry and explores sex trafficking that occurs during the festival. The book was named one of the best Hollywood novels of all time by Entertainment Weekly. Iain Johnstone's Cannes: The Novel is a dystopian tale about terrorists holding the festival hostage.\nPaulo Coelho's The Winner Stands Alone  is also set at the Cannes Film Festival.\nThe culture and history of the festival has been covered in a number of non-fiction books.\nThe festival has been used as the backdrop and setting of several films, including The Last Horror Film (1982), La cité de la peur (1994),  Festival in Cannes (2001), Femme Fatale (2002) and Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007); some of these were shot on location at the festival.\n\n\nSee also\nDirectors' Fortnight\nInternational Critics' Week\nACID\nList of Cannes Film Festival jury presidents\nList of Cannes Film Festival juries (Feature films)\nList of Cannes Film Festival records\nMarché du Film\nList of Big Three film festivals winners\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nCoyle, Jake (10 May 2017). \"Outcry over Netflix films prompts Cannes to change rules\".
