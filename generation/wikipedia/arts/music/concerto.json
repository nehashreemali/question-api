  "extract": "A concerto (; plural concertos, or concerti from the Italian plural) is, from the late Baroque era, mostly understood as an instrumental composition, written for one or more soloists accompanied by an orchestra or other ensemble. The typical three-movement structure, a slow movement (e.g., lento or adagio) preceded and followed by fast movements (e.g., presto or allegro), became a standard from the early 18th century.\nThe concerto originated as a genre of vocal music in the late 16th century: the instrumental variant appeared around a century later, when Italians such as Arcangelo Corelli and Giuseppe Torelli started to publish their concertos. A few decades later, Venetian composers, such as Antonio Vivaldi, had written hundreds of violin concertos, while also producing solo concertos for other instruments such as a cello or a woodwind instrument, and concerti grossi for a group of soloists. The first keyboard concertos, such as George Frideric Handel's organ concertos and Johann Sebastian Bach's harpsichord concertos, were written around the same time.\nIn the second half of the 18th century, the piano became the most used keyboard instrument, and composers of the Classical Era such as Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven each wrote several piano concertos, and, to a lesser extent, violin concertos, and concertos for other instruments. In the Romantic Era, many composers, including Niccolò Paganini, Felix Mendelssohn, Frédéric Chopin, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Sergei Rachmaninoff, continued to write solo concertos, and, more exceptionally, concertos for more than one instrument; 19th century concertos for instruments other than the piano, violin and cello remained comparatively rare, however. In the first half of the 20th century, concertos were written by, among others, Maurice Ravel, Edward Elgar, Richard Strauss, Sergei Prokofiev, George Gershwin, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Joaquín Rodrigo and Béla Bartók, the latter also composing a concerto for orchestra, that is without soloist. During the 20th century concertos appeared by major composers for orchestral instruments which had been neglected in the 19th century such as the clarinet, viola and French horn.\nIn the second half of the 20th century and onwards into the 21st a great many composers have continued to write concertos, including Alfred Schnittke, György Ligeti, Dmitri Shostakovich, Philip Glass and James MacMillan among many others. An interesting feature of this period is the proliferation of concerti for less usual instruments, including orchestral ones such as the double bass (by composers like Eduard Tubin or Peter Maxwell Davies) and cor anglais (like those by MacMillan and Aaron Jay Kernis), but also folk instruments (such as Tubin's concerto for Balalaika, Serry's Concerto in C Major for Bassetti Accordion, or the concertos for Harmonica by Villa-Lobos and Malcolm Arnold), and even Deep Purple's Concerto for Group and Orchestra, a concerto for a rock band.\nConcertos from previous ages have remained a conspicuous part of the repertoire for concert performances and recordings. Less common has been the previously common practice of the composition of concertos by a performer to be performed personally, though the practice has continued via certain composer-performers such as Daniil Trifonov.\n\n\nGenre\nThe Italian word concerto, meaning accord or gathering, derives from the Latin verb concertare, which indicates a competition or battle.\n\n\nBaroque Era\n\nCompositions were for the first time indicated as concertos in the title of a music print when the Concerti by Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli were published in 1587.\n\n\nConcerto as a genre of vocal music\n\nIn the 17th century, sacred works for voices and orchestra were typically called concertos, as reflected by J. S. Bach's usage of the title \"concerto\" for many of the works that are now known as cantatas. The term \"concerto\" was initially used to denote works that involved voices and instruments in which the instruments had independent parts—as opposed to the Renaissance common practice in which instruments that accompanied voices only doubled the voice parts. Examples of this earlier form of concerto include Giovanni Gabrieli's \"In Ecclesiis\" or Heinrich Schütz's \"Saul, Saul, was verfolgst du mich\".\n\n\nInstrumental concerto\n\nThe concerto began to take its modern shape in the late-Baroque period, beginning with the concerto grosso form developed by Arcangelo Corelli. Corelli's concertino group was two violins, a cello and basso continuo. In J. S. Bach's Fifth Brandenburg Concerto, for example, the concertino is a flute, a violin, and a harpsichord; although the harpsichord is a featured solo instrument, it also sometimes plays with the ripieno, functioning as a continuo keyboard accompaniment.\nLater, the concerto approached its modern form, in which the concertino usually reduces to a single solo instrument playing with (or against) an orchestra. The main composers of concertos of the baroque were Tommaso Albinoni, Antonio Vivaldi (e.g., published in L'estro armonico, La stravaganza, Six Violin Concertos, Op. 6, Twelve Concertos, Op. 7, Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione, Six Flute Concertos, Op. 10, Six Concertos, Op. 11 and Six Violin Concertos, Op. 12), Georg Philipp Telemann, Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, Pietro Locatelli, Jean-Marie Leclair, Giuseppe Tartini, Francesco Geminiani and Johann Joachim Quantz.\nThe concerto was intended as a composition typical of the Italian style of the time, and all the composers were studying how to compose in the Italian fashion (all'Italiana).\nThe Baroque concerto was mainly for a string instrument (violin, viola, cello, seldom viola d'amore or harp) or a wind instrument (flute, recorder, oboe, bassoon, horn, or trumpet,). Bach also wrote a concerto for two violins and orchestra. During the Baroque period, before the invention of the piano, keyboard concertos were comparatively rare, with the exception of the twelve organ concertos by George Frideric Handel and the thirteen harpsichord concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\n\nClassical era\n\nThe concertos of the sons of Johann Sebastian Bach, such as C. P. E. Bach, are perhaps the best links between those of the Baroque period and those of the Classical era. It is conventional to state that the first movements of concertos from the Classical period onwards follow the structure of sonata form. Final movements are often in rondo form, as in J.S. Bach's E Major Violin Concerto.\nMozart wrote five violin concertos, all in 1775, except the first in 1773. They show a number of influences, notably Italian and Austrian. Several passages have leanings towards folk music, as manifested in Austrian serenades. Mozart also wrote the Sinfonia Concertante for violin, viola and orchestra. Haydn wrote three concertos for violin and above all two for cello. Beethoven wrote only one violin concerto that remained obscure until revealed as a masterpiece in a performance by violin virtuoso Joseph Joachim on 27 May 1844.\nC.P.E. Bach's keyboard concertos contain some virtuosic solo writing. Some of them have movements that run into one another without a break, and there are frequent cross-movement thematic references. Mozart, as a child, made arrangements for keyboard and orchestra of four sonatas by now little-known composers. Then he arranged three sonata movements by Johann Christian Bach. By the time he was twenty, Mozart was able to write concerto ritornelli that gave the orchestra admirable opportunity for asserting its character in an exposition with some five or six sharply contrasted themes, before the soloist enters to elaborate on the material. Of his 27 piano concertos, the last 17 are highly appreciated. Eleven cataloged keyboard concertos are attributed to Haydn, of which seven are considered genuine. Beethoven wrote five concertos for piano and orchestra.\nC. P. E. Bach wrote five flute concertos and two oboe concertos. Mozart wrote four horn concertos, two for flute, one for oboe (later rearranged for flute and known as Flute Concerto No. 2), one for clarinet, one for bassoon, one for flute and harp, and Exsultate, jubilate, a de facto concerto for soprano voice. They all exploit and explore the characteristics of the solo instrument(s). Haydn wrote an important trumpet concerto and a Sinfonia Concertante for violin, cello, oboe, bassoon and orchestra, as well as one horn concerto. Haydn also wrote a concerto for double bass, but it was lost to history in the great fire of Eszterháza in 1779.\n\n\nRomantic era\n\nIn the 19th century, the concerto as a vehicle for virtuosic display flourished, and concertos became increasingly complex and ambitious works. Whilst performances of typical concertos in the baroque era lasted about ten minutes, those by Beethoven could last half an hour or longer. The term concertino, or the German Konzertstuck (\"Concert Piece\") began to be used to designate smaller pieces not considered large enough to be considered a full concerto, though the distinction has never been formalised and many Concertinos are still longer than the original Baroque concertos.\nDuring the Romantic era the cello became increasingly used as a concerto instrument; though the violin and piano remained the most frequently used. Beethoven contributed to the repertoire of concertos for more than one soloist with a  Triple Concerto for piano, violin, cello and orchestra while later in the century, Brahms wrote a  Double Concerto for violin, cello and orchestra.\n\n\n20th and 21st century\n\nMany of the concertos written in the early 20th century belong more to the late Romantic school, hence modernistic movement. Masterpieces were written by Edward Elgar (a violin concerto and a cello concerto), Sergei Rachmaninoff and Nikolai Medtner (four and three piano concertos, respectively), Jean Sibelius (a violin concerto), Frederick Delius (a violin concerto, a cello concerto, a piano concerto and a double concerto for violin and cello), Karol Szymanowski (two violin concertos and a \"Symphonie Concertante\" for piano), and Richard Strauss (two horn concertos, a violin concerto, Don Quixote—a tone poem that features the cello as a soloist—and among later works, an oboe concerto).\nHowever, in the first decades of the 20th century, several composers such as Debussy, Schoenberg, Berg, Hindemith, Stravinsky, Prokofiev and Bartók started experimenting with ideas that were to have far-reaching consequences for the way music is written and, in some cases, performed. Some of these innovations include a more frequent use of modality, the exploration of non-western scales, the development of atonality and neotonality, the wider acceptance of dissonances, the invention of the twelve-tone technique of composition and the use of polyrhythms and complex time signatures.\nThese changes also affected the concerto as a musical form. Beside more or less radical effects on musical language, they led to a redefinition of the concept of virtuosity that included new and extended instrumental techniques and a focus on previously neglected aspects of sound such as pitch, timbre and dynamics. In some cases, they also brought about a new approach to the role of soloists and their relation to the orchestra.\nTwo great innovators of early 20th-century music, Schoenberg and Stravinsky, both wrote violin concertos. The material in Schoenberg's concerto, like that in Berg's, is linked by the twelve-tone serial method. In the 20th century, particularly after the Second World War, the cello enjoyed an unprecedented popularity. As a result, its concertante repertoire caught up with those of the piano and the violin both in terms of quantity and quality.\nThe 20th century also witnessed a growth of the concertante repertoire of instruments, some of which had seldom or never been used in this capacity, and even a concerto for wordless coloratura soprano by Reinhold Glière. As a result, almost all classical instruments now have a concertante repertoire. Among the works of the prolific composer Alan Hovhaness may be noted Prayer of St. Gregory for trumpet and strings, though it is not a concerto in the usual sense of the term. In the later 20th century the concerto tradition was continued by composers such as Maxwell Davies, whose series of Strathclyde Concertos exploit some of the instruments less familiar as soloists.\nIn addition, the 20th century gave rise to several composers who experimented further by showcasing a variety of nontraditional orchestral instruments within the center of the orthodox concerto form. Included within this group are: Paul Hindemith (Concerto for Trautonium and String Orchestra in 1931), Andre Jolivet (Concerto of Ondes Martenot in 1947), Heitor Villa-Lobos (Concerto for Harmonica in 1956), John Serry Sr. (Concerto in C Major for Bassetti Accordion in 1966), Astor Piazzolla (Concerto for Bandoneon, String Orchestra and Percussion, \"Aconcagua\" in 1979), Peter Maxwell Davies (Concerto for Piccolo and Orchestra, Op. 182 in 1996), and Tan Dun (Concerto for Water Percussion and Orchestra in 1998)\nOther composers of this era adopted a neoclassical rejection of specific features which typically characterized the concerto form during the Baroque or Romantic periods. Several of them achieved this objective by incorporating various musical elements from the realm of jazz within the structure of the concerto. Included in this group were: Aaron Copland (Concerto for Piano, 1926), Maurice Ravel (Concerto for the Left Hand, 1929), Igor Stravinsky (Ebony Concerto for clarinet and jazz band, 1945) and George Gershwin (Concerto in F, 1925). Still others called upon the orchestra itself to function as the primary virtuosic force within the concerto form. This approach was adopted by Béla Bartók in his Concerto for Orchestra as well by other composers of the period including: Walter Piston (1933), Zoltan Kodaly (1939), Michael Tippet (1962) and Elliott Carter (1969).\nConcertos with concert band include:\n\nBryant – 2007–2010\nFoss – 2002\nHusa – 1982\nJacob – 1974\nJager – 1982\n\n\nBy type\n\n\nVocal concerto\n\n20th century:\n\nColoratura soprano Concerto: Reinhold Glière\n\n\nWithout orchestra\n\n\nSingle solo instrument\n\nBaroque era:\n\nBach:\nItalian Concerto\nWeimar concerto transcriptions\n20th century:\n\nSerry's Concerto In C Major For Free Bass Accordion\n\n\nMultiple instruments\nBaroque era:\n\nBach's concerto for two harpsichords, BWV 1061.1\nTelemann's concertos for four violins\n20th century:\n\nWebern's Concerto for Nine Instruments\nStravinsky's Concerto for Two Pianos\n\n\nFor one instrumental soloist and orchestra\n\n\nFor bowed string instrument and orchestra\n\n\nViolin concerto\n\nBaroque era:\n\nVivaldi:\nNos. 3, 6, 9 and 12 of L'estro armonico\nLa stravaganza\nSix Violin Concertos, Op. 6\nTen of the Twelve Concertos, Op. 7\nIl cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione, which includes The Four Seasons\nFive of the Six Concertos, Op. 11\nSix Violin Concertos, Op. 12\nGrosso mogul\nBach:\nViolin Concerto in A minor\nViolin Concerto in E major\nClassical era:\n\nMozart:\nNo. 1 in B flat major, K. 207\nNo. 2 in D major, K. 211\nNo. 3 in G major, K. 216 (Straßburg)\nNo. 4 in D major, K. 218\nNo. 5 in A major, K. 219 (Turkish)\nEarly Romantic traits can be found in the violin concertos of Viotti, but it is Spohr's twelve violin concertos, written between 1802 and 1827, that truly embrace the Romantic spirit with their melodic as well as their dramatic qualities.\n20th century:\n\nArnold Schoenberg\nIgor Stravinsky\nAlban Berg\nBartók wrote two concertos for violin.\nRussian composers Prokofiev and Shostakovich each wrote two concertos while Khachaturian wrote a concerto and a Concerto-Rhapsody for the instrument.\nHindemith's concertos hark back to the forms of the 19th century, even if the harmonic language he used was different.\nThree violin concertos from David Diamond show the form in neoclassical style.\nIn 1950 Carlos Chávez completed a substantial Violin Concerto with an enormous central cadenza for the unaccompanied violin.\nDutilleux's L'Arbre des songes has proved an important addition to the repertoire and a fine example of the composer's atonal yet melodic style.\nOther composers of major violin concertos include John Adams, Samuel Barber, Benjamin Britten, Peter Maxwell Davies, Miguel del Aguila, Philip Glass, Cristóbal Halffter, György Ligeti, Frank Martin, Bohuslav Martinů, Carl Nielsen, Walter Piston, Alfred Schnittke, Jean Sibelius, Ralph Vaughan Williams, William Walton, John Williams and Roger Sessions.\n21st century:\n\nElfman's violin concerto\n\n\nViola concerto\n\nBaroque era:\n\nViola Concerto in G major (Telemann)\nClassical era:\n\nFranz Anton Hoffmeister\nViola Concerto in D major\nViola Concerto in B-flat major\nViola Concerto in D major, Op. 1 (Carl Stamitz)\nViola Concerto in E♭ major, ICZ 17 (Carl Friedrich Zelter)\n20th century:\n\nViola concerto: Aho, Arnold, Bartók, del Aguila, Denisov, Gagneux, Gubaidulina, Hindemith, Kancheli, Martinů, Milhaud, Murail, Penderecki, Schnittke, Takemitsu, Walton\n\n\nCello concerto\n\nThe 'core' repertoire—performed the most of any cello concertos—are by Elgar, Dvořák, Saint-Saëns, Haydn, Shostakovich and Schumann, but many more concertos are performed nearly as often.\nBaroque era:\n\nVivaldi's cello concertos RV 398–403, 405–414 and 416–424\nClassical era:\n\nHaydn wrote two cello concertos (for cello, oboes, horns, and strings), which are the most important works in that genre of the classical era.\nCarl Philipp Emanuel Bach wrote three cello concertos and Luigi Boccherini wrote twelve cello concertos.\nRomantic era:\n\nAntonín Dvořák's cello concerto ranks among the supreme examples from the Romantic era while Robert Schumann's focuses on the lyrical qualities of the instrument.\nThe instrument was also popular with composers of the Franco-Belgian tradition: Saint-Saëns and Vieuxtemps wrote two cello concertos each and Lalo and Jongen one.\nTchaikovsky's contribution to the genre is a series of Variations on a Rococo Theme. He also left very fragmentary sketches of a projected Cello Concerto. Cellist Yuriy Leonovich and Tchaikovsky researcher Brett Langston published their completion of the piece in 2006.\nCarl Reinecke, David Popper and Julius Klengel also wrote cello concertos that were popular in their time and are still played occasionally nowadays.\nElgar's popular concerto, while written in the early 20th century, belongs to the late romantic period stylistically.\n20th century:\n\nAn important factor for the 20th-century cello concerto was the rise of virtuoso cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. His outstanding technique and passionate playing prompted dozens of composers to write pieces for him, first in his native Soviet Union and then abroad. Among such compositions may be listed Sergei Prokofiev's Symphony-Concerto, Dmitri Shostakovich's two cello concertos, Benjamin Britten's Cello-Symphony (which emphasizes, as its title suggests, the equal importance of soloist and orchestra), Henri Dutilleux' Tout un monde lointain..., Cristóbal Halffter's two cello concertos, Witold Lutosławski's cello concerto, Dmitry Kabalevsky's two cello concertos, Aram Khachaturian's Concerto-Rhapsody, Arvo Pärt's Pro et Contra, Alfred Schnittke, André Jolivet and Krzysztof Penderecki second cello concertos, Sofia Gubaidulina's Canticles of the Sun, Luciano Berio's Ritorno degli Snovidenia, Leonard Bernstein's Three Meditations, James MacMillan's cello concerto and Olivier Messiaen's Concert à quatre (a quadruple concerto for cello, piano, oboe, flute and orchestra).\nIn addition, several important composers who were not directly influenced by Rostropovich wrote cello concertos: Samuel Barber, Elliott Carter, Carlos Chávez, Miguel del Aguila, Alexander Glazunov, Hans Werner Henze, Paul Hindemith, Arthur Honegger, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, György Ligeti, Bohuslav Martinů, Darius Milhaud, Nikolai Myaskovsky, Einojuhani Rautavaara, Joaquín Rodrigo, Toru Takemitsu, William Walton, Heitor Villa-Lobos, and Bernd Alois Zimmermann for instance.\n\n\nDouble bass concerto\n\n20th century:\n\nDouble bass concerto: Aho, Gagneux, Dittersdorf, Henze, Koussevitsky, Davies, Ohzawa, Rautavaara, Skalkottas, Tubin\n\n\nOther bowed string instruments\n20th century:\n\nViola d'amore concerto: Hindemith\n\n\nFor plucked string instrument and orchestra\n\n\nHarp concerto\n\nBaroque era:\n\nHandel's Harp Concerto, HWV 294 (a.k.a.

He was a significant contributor to the genre of horn concertos in the 18th century. Most of his outstanding horn concertos were composed between 1782 and 1789 for the Bohemian duo Franz Zwierzina and Joseph Nage while at the Bavarian court of Oettingen-Wallerstein. One of his best-known works in this genre is his Horn Concerto in E flat major C49/K III:36. It consists of three movements: 1. Allegro moderato 2. Romance 3. Rondo. Many common features of the galant style are present in Rosetti's music and composing style. In his E-flat horn concerto, we hear periodic and short phrases, galant harmonic rhythm and melodic line reduction. Rosetti's influence on the 18th century composers, musicians and music was considerable. At the Bavarian court of Oettingen-Wallerstein, his music was often performed by the Wallerstein ensembles. In Paris, his compositions were performed by the best ensembles of the city, including the orchestra of the Concert Spirituel. His publishers were Le Menu et Boyer and Sieber. According to H. C. Robbins Landon (Mozart scholar), Rosetti's horn concertos might have been a model for Mozart's horn concertos.\n20th century:\n\nFrench horn Concerto: Aho, Arnold, Arutiunian, Atterberg, Bowen, Carter, Davies, Glière, Gipps, Hindemith, Hovhaness, Jacob, Knussen, Ligeti, Murail, Penderecki, Strauss, Tomasi, J.

The last two are particularly remarkable, integrating the concerto into a large symphonic structure with movements that frequently run into one another. His Piano Concerto No. 4 starts with a statement by the piano, after which the orchestra enters in a foreign key, to present what would normally be the opening tutti. The work has a lyrical character. The slow movement is a dramatic dialogue between the soloist and the orchestra. His Piano Concerto No. 5 has the basic rhythm of a Viennese military march. There is no lyrical second subject, but in its place a continuous development of the opening material.\nThe piano concertos of Cramer, Field, Düssek, Woelfl, Ries, and Hummel provide a link from the Classical concerto to the Romantic concerto.\nChopin wrote two piano concertos in which the orchestra is relegated to an accompanying role. Schumann, despite being a pianist-composer, wrote a piano concerto in which virtuosity is never allowed to eclipse the essential lyrical quality of the work. The gentle, expressive melody heard at the beginning on woodwind and horns (after the piano's heralding introductory chords) bears the material for most of the argument in the first movement. In fact, argument in the traditional developmental sense is replaced by a kind of variation technique in which soloist and orchestra interweave their ideas.\nLiszt's mastery of piano technique matched that of Paganini for the violin. His concertos No. 1 and No. 2 left a deep impression on the style of piano concerto writing, influencing Rubinstein, and especially Tchaikovsky, whose First Piano Concerto's rich chordal opening is justly famous.\nGrieg's concerto likewise begins in a striking manner after which it continues in a lyrical vein.\nSaint-Saëns wrote five piano concertos and orchestra between 1858 and 1896, in a classical vein.\nBrahms's First Piano Concerto in D minor (pub 1861) was the result of an immense amount of work on a mass of material originally intended for a symphony. His Second Piano Concerto in B♭ major (1881) has four movements and is written on a larger scale than any earlier concerto. Like his violin concerto, it is symphonic in proportions.\nFewer piano concertos were written in the late Romantic Period. But Sergei Rachmaninoff wrote four piano concertos between 1891 and 1926. His Second and Third, being the most popular of the four, went on to become among the most famous in the piano repertoire.\nOther romantic piano concertos, like those by Kalkbrenner, Henri Herz, Moscheles and Thalberg were also very popular in the Romantic era, but not today.\n20th century:\n\nMaurice Ravel wrote two pianos concertos, one in G-major (1931) and the second for the left hand in D-major (date of creation1932).\nIgor Stravinsky wrote three works for solo piano and orchestra:\nConcerto for Piano and Wind Instruments\nCapriccio for Piano and Orchestra\nMovements for Piano and Orchestra\nSergei Prokofiev, another Russian composer, wrote five piano concertos, which he himself performed.\nDmitri Shostakovich composed two piano concertos.\nAram Khachaturian contributed to the repertoire with a piano concerto and a Concerto-Rhapsody.\nArnold Schoenberg's Piano Concerto is a well-known example of a dodecaphonic piano concerto.\nBéla Bartók also wrote three piano concertos. Like their violin counterparts, they show the various stages in his musical development. Bartok's also rearranged his chamber piece, Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, into a Concerto for Two Pianos and Percussion, adding orchestral accompaniment.\nCristóbal Halffter wrote a prize-winning neoclassical Piano Concerto in 1953, and a second Piano Concerto in 1987–88.\nRalph Vaughan Williams wrote a concerto for piano, though it was later reworked as a concerto for two pianos and orchestra—both versions have been recorded\nBenjamin Britten's concerto for piano (1938) is a prominent work from his early period.\nPiano concertos by Latin-American composers include one by Carlos Chávez, two by Alberto Ginastera, and five by Heitor Villa-Lobos.\nGyörgy Ligeti's concerto (1988) has a synthetic quality: it mixes complex rhythms, the composer's Hungarian roots and his experiments with micropolyphony from the 1960s and 1970s.\nWitold Lutosławski's piano concerto, completed in the same year, alternates between playfulness and mystery. It also displays a partial return to melody after the composer's aleatoric period.\nRussian composer Rodion Shchedrin has written six piano concertos.\nFinnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara wrote three piano concertos, the third one dedicated to Vladimir Ashkenazy, who played and conducted the world première.\nFrench composer Germaine Tailleferre and Czech composers Bohuslav Martinů and Vítězslava Kaprálová wrote piano concertos.\n\n\nAccordion concerto\n\n20th century:\n\nAccordion concerto: Hovhaness, Sofia Gubaidulina, Toshio Hosokawa, Kalevi Aho\nFree bass accordion Concerto: John Serry Sr.\n\n\nOther keyboard instruments\n20th century:\n\nBandoneón Concerto: Piazzolla\nClavinet concerto: Woolf\nYamaha GX-1: Akutagawa\n\n\nOther instrumental soloist\n\n\nPercussion instrument\n\n20th century:\n\nPercussion concerto: Aho, Dorman, Glass, Jolivet, MacMillan, Milhaud, Rautavaara, Susman\nTimpani concerto: Aho, Druschetzky, Glass, Kraft, Rosauro\nXylophone concerto: Mayuzumi\nMarimba concerto: Creston, Larsen, Milhaud, Rosauro (Concerto No.1 and No.2), Svoboda, Viñao\nVibraphone: Rosauro (Concerto No.1 and Concerto No.2)\n\n\nFree reed aerophone\n\n20th century:\n\nHarmonica concerto: Arnold, Hovhaness, Vaughan Williams, Villa-Lobos\nSheng Concerto: Unsuk Chin, Bernd Richard Deutsch, Jukka Tiensuu, Man Fang .\n\n\nElectronic musical instrument\n20th century:\n\nOndes Martenot concerto: Jolivet, Rozsa\nTheremin concerto: Aho\n\n\nFor multiple instruments and orchestra\n\nIn the Baroque era, two violins and one cello formed the standard concertino of a concerto grosso. In the classical era, the sinfonia concertante replaced the concerto grosso genre, although concertos for two or three soloists were still composed too. From the Romantic era works for multiple instrumental soloists and orchestra were again commonly called concerto.\n\n\nTwo soloists\n\nBaroque era:\n\nVivaldi's concertos for 2 violins, for 2 cellos, for 2 mandolins, for 2 trumpets, for 2 flutes, for oboe and bassoon, for cello and bassoon (etc.)\nBach:\nConcerto for Two Violins\nConcertos for two harpsichords: BWV 1060, 1061 and 1062\nTelemann's Concerto for Two Violas\nClassical era:\n\nHaydn's concerto for violin and keyboard (usually referred to as the Keyboard Concerto No. 6)\nMozart:\nPiano Concerto No. 10\nConcerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra\nSalieri's double concerto for flute and oboe\nRomantic era:\n\nFelix Mendelssohn:\nConcerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra in E major\nConcerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra in A-flat major\nJohannes Brahms's Double Concerto for violin and cello\nMax Bruch:\nConcerto for Clarinet, Viola, and Orchestra\nConcerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra\n20th century:\n\nDmitri Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 1 (soloists: piano, trumpet)\nMalcolm Arnold's Concerto for Two Violins and String Orchestra\nFrancis Poulenc's Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra\nRalph Vaughan Williams's Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra\nElliott Carter's Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano with Two Chamber Orchestras\nPeter Maxwell Davies's Strathclyde Concerto No. 3 for horn, trumpet and orchestra, and No. 4 for violin, viola and string orchestra\n\n\nThree soloists\n\nBaroque era:\n\nArcangelo Corelli's twelve concerti grossi, Op. 6 for two violins and cello\nVivaldi's concertos for 3 violins\nBach:\nBrandenburg Concertos Nos. 4 (BWV 1049) and 5 (BWV 1050)\nConcertos for three harpsichords: BWV 1063 and 1064\nTriple Concerto, BWV 1044, for harpsichord, flute and violin\nClassical era:\n\nMozart's Piano Concerto No. 7\nRomantic era:\n\nBeethoven's Triple Concerto for piano, violin, and cello.\n21st century:\n\nSmirnov's Triple Concerto No. 2\n\n\nFour or more soloists\nBaroque era:\n\nVivaldi:\nL'estro armonico Nos. 1, 4, 7 and 10\nRV 555, featuring 3 violins, an oboe, 2 recorders, 2 viole all'inglese, a chalumeau, 2 cellos, 2 harpsichords and 2 trumpets.\nConcerto for Diverse Instruments in C major, RV 558\nConcerto in C major, RV 559, for two oboes, two clarinets, strings and continuo\nBach:\nBrandenburg Concertos Nos. 1 (BWV 1046) and 2 (BWV 1047)\nConcerto for 4 harpsichords, BWV 1065 (after a concerto for four violins by Vivaldi)\n20th century:\n\nArnold Schoenberg's Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra\nMaxwell Davies's Strathclyde Concerto and No. 9 for piccolo, alto flute, cor anglais, E-flat clarinet, bass clarinet, contrabassoon and string orchestra.\nFrank Martin's Concerto for seven wind instruments, timpani, percussion, and string orchestra.\nJon Lord's Concerto for Group and Orchestra for rock band.\nJoaquín Rodrigo's Concierto Andaluz for 4 guitars.\nAlfred Schnittke's Concerto Grosso No. 3\nOlivier Messiaen's Concert à quatre for piano, cello, oboe and flute.\n\n\nConcerto for orchestra\n\n\nSymphonic orchestra\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, several composers wrote concertos for orchestra. In these works, different sections and/or instruments of the orchestra or concert band are treated at one point or another as soloists with emphasis on solo sections and/or instruments changing during the piece. Some examples include those written by:\n\nHindemith – Op. 38, 1925\nKodály – 1940\nBartók – Concerto for Orchestra – 1945\nLutoslawski – Concerto for Orchestra – 1954\nShchedrin\nNo. 1 Naughty Limericks (1963)\nNo. 2 The Chimes (1968)\nNo. 3 Old Russian Circus Music (1989)\nNo. 4 Round Dances (Khorovody) (1989)\nNo. 5 Four Russian Songs (1998)\nCarter – 1969\nKnussen – 1969\nLindberg – 2003\nDutilleux has also described his Métaboles as a concerto for orchestra.\n\n\nChamber orchestra or string orchestra\nBaroque era:\n\nVivaldi's Concerto alla rustica\nBach's Brandenburg Concertos Nos. 3 (BWV 1048) and 6 (BWV 1051)\n20th century:\n\nStravinsky:\nConcerto in D\nDumbarton Oaks concerto\n\n\nMore than one orchestra\nBaroque era:\n\nHandel's Concerti a due cori, HWV 332–334\n20th century:\n\nMichael Tippett: Concerto for Double String Orchestra\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nBertensson, Sergei (2001).
