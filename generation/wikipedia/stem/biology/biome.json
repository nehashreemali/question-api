It consists of a biological community that has formed in response to its physical environment and regional climate. In 1935, Tansley added the climatic and soil aspects to the idea, calling it ecosystem. The International Biological Program (1964–74) projects popularized the concept of biome.\nHowever, in some contexts, the term biome is used in a different manner. In German literature, particularly in the Walter terminology, the term is used similarly as biotope (a concrete geographical unit), while the biome definition used in this article is used as an international, non-regional, terminology—irrespectively of the continent in which an area is present, it takes the same biome name—and corresponds to his \"zonobiome\", \"orobiome\" and \"pedobiome\" (biomes determined by climate zone, altitude, or soil).\nIn the Brazilian literature, the term biome is sometimes used as a synonym of biogeographic province, an area based on species composition (the term floristic province being used when plant species are considered), or also as synonym of the \"morphoclimatic and phytogeographical domain\" of Ab'Sáber, a geographic space with subcontinental dimensions, with the predominance of similar geomorphologic and climatic characteristics, and of a certain vegetation form. Both include many biomes in fact.\n\n\nClassifications\nTo divide the world into a few ecological zones is difficult, notably because of the small-scale variations that exist everywhere on earth and because of the gradual changeover from one biome to the other. Their boundaries must therefore be drawn arbitrarily and their characterization made according to the average conditions that predominate in them.\nA 1978 study on North American grasslands found a positive logistic correlation between evapotranspiration in mm/yr and above-ground net primary production in g/m2/yr. The general results from the study were that precipitation and water use led to above-ground primary production, while solar irradiation and temperature lead to below-ground primary production (roots), and temperature and water lead to cool and warm season growth habit. These findings help explain the categories used in Holdridge's bioclassification scheme (see below), which were then later simplified by Whittaker. The number of classification schemes and the variety of determinants used in those schemes, however, should be taken as strong indicators that biomes do not fit perfectly into the classification schemes created.\n\n\nHoldridge (1947, 1964) life zones\n\nIn 1947, the American botanist and climatologist Leslie Holdridge classified climates based on the biological effects of temperature and rainfall on vegetation under the assumption that these two abiotic factors are the largest determinants of the types of vegetation found in a habitat. Holdridge uses the four axes to define 30 so-called \"humidity provinces\", which are clearly visible in his diagram. While this scheme largely ignores soil and sun exposure, Holdridge acknowledged that these were important.\n\n\nAllee (1949) biome-types\nThe principal biome-types by Allee (1949):\n\nTundra\nTaiga\nDeciduous forest\nGrasslands\nDesert\nHigh plateaus\nTropical forest\nMinor terrestrial biomes\n\n\nKendeigh (1961) biomes\nThe principal biomes of the world by Kendeigh (1961):\n\nTerrestrial\nTemperate deciduous forest\nConiferous forest\nWoodland\nChaparral\nTundra\nGrassland\nDesert\nTropical savanna\nTropical forest\nMarine\nOceanic plankton and nekton\nBalanoid-gastropod-thallophyte\nPelecypod-annelid\nCoral reef\n\n\nWhittaker (1962, 1970, 1975) biome-types\n\nWhittaker classified biomes using two abiotic factors: precipitation and temperature. His scheme can be seen as a simplification of Holdridge's; more readily accessible, but missing Holdridge's greater specificity.\nWhittaker based his approach on theoretical assertions and empirical sampling. He had previously compiled a review of biome classifications.\n\n\nKey definitions for understanding Whittaker's scheme\nPhysiognomy: sometimes referring to the plants' appearance; or the biome's apparent characteristics, outward features, or appearance of ecological communities or species – including plants.\nBiome: a grouping of terrestrial ecosystems on a given continent that is similar in vegetation structure, physiognomy, features of the environment and characteristics of their animal communities.\nFormation: a major kind of community of plants on a given continent.\nBiome-type: grouping of convergent biomes or formations of different continents, defined by physiognomy.\nFormation-type: a grouping of convergent formations.\nWhittaker's distinction between biome and formation can be simplified: formation is used when applied to plant communities only, while biome is used when concerned with both plants and animals. Whittaker's convention of biome-type or formation-type is a broader method to categorize similar communities. \n\n\nWhittaker's parameters for classifying biome-types\nWhittaker used what he called \"gradient analysis\" of ecocline patterns to relate communities to climate on a worldwide scale. Whittaker considered four main ecoclines in the terrestrial realm.\n\nIntertidal levels: The wetness gradient of areas that are exposed to alternating water and dryness with intensities that vary by location from high to low tide\nClimatic moisture gradient\nTemperature gradient by altitude\nTemperature gradient by latitude\nAlong these gradients, Whittaker noted several trends that allowed him to qualitatively establish biome-types:\n\nThe gradient runs from favorable to the extreme, with corresponding changes in productivity.\nChanges in physiognomic complexity vary with how favorable of an environment exists (decreasing community structure and reduction of stratal differentiation as the environment becomes less favorable).\nTrends in the diversity of structure follow trends in species diversity; alpha and beta species diversities decrease from favorable to extreme environments.\nEach growth-form (i.e. grasses, shrubs, etc.) has its characteristic place of maximum importance along the ecoclines.\nThe same growth forms may be dominant in similar environments in widely different parts of the world.\nWhittaker summed the effects of gradients (3) and (4) to get an overall temperature gradient and combined this with a gradient (2), the moisture gradient, to express the above conclusions in what is known as the Whittaker classification scheme. The scheme graphs average annual precipitation (x-axis) versus average annual temperature (y-axis) to classify biome-types.\n\n\nBiome-types\n\n\nGoodall (1974–) ecosystem types\nThe multi-authored series Ecosystems of the World, edited by David W. Goodall, provides a comprehensive coverage of the major \"ecosystem types or biomes\" on Earth:\n\n\nWalter (1976, 2002) zonobiomes\nThe eponymously named Heinrich Walter classification scheme considers the seasonality of temperature and precipitation. The system, also assessing precipitation and temperature, finds nine major biome types, with the important climate traits and vegetation types. The boundaries of each biome correlate to the conditions of moisture and cold stress that are strong determinants of plant form, and therefore the vegetation that defines the region. Extreme conditions, such as flooding in a swamp, can create different kinds of communities within the same biome.\n\n\nSchultz (1988) eco-zones\nSchultz (1988, 2005) defined nine ecozones (his concept of ecozone is more similar to the concept of biome than to the concept of ecozone of BBC):\n\n\nBailey (1989) ecoregions\nRobert G. Bailey nearly developed a biogeographical classification system of ecoregions for the United States in a map published in 1976. He subsequently expanded the system to include the rest of North America in 1981, and the world in 1989. The Bailey system, based on climate, is divided into four domains (polar, humid temperate, dry, and humid tropical), with further divisions based on other climate characteristics (subarctic, warm temperate, hot temperate, and subtropical; marine and continental; lowland and mountain).\n\n100 Polar Domain\n120 Tundra Division (Köppen: Ft)\nM120 Tundra Division – Mountain Provinces\n130 Subarctic Division (Köppen: E)\nM130 Subarctic Division – Mountain Provinces\n200 Humid Temperate Domain\n210 Warm Continental Division (Köppen: portion of Dcb)\nM210 Warm Continental Division – Mountain Provinces\n220 Hot Continental Division (Köppen: portion of Dca)\nM220 Hot Continental Division – Mountain Provinces\n230 Subtropical Division (Köppen: portion of Cf)\nM230 Subtropical Division – Mountain Provinces\n240 Marine Division (Köppen: Do)\nM240 Marine Division – Mountain Provinces\n250 Prairie Division (Köppen: arid portions of Cf, Dca, Dcb)\n260 Mediterranean Division (Köppen: Cs)\nM260 Mediterranean Division – Mountain Provinces\n300 Dry Domain\n310 Tropical/Subtropical Steppe Division\nM310 Tropical/Subtropical Steppe Division – Mountain Provinces\n320 Tropical/Subtropical Desert Division\n330 Temperate Steppe Division\n340 Temperate Desert Division\n400 Humid Tropical Domain\n410 Savanna Division\n420 Rainforest Division\n\n\nOlson & Dinerstein (1998) biomes for WWF / Global 200\n\nA team of biologists convened by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) developed a scheme that divided the world's land area into biogeographic realms (called \"ecozones\" in a BBC scheme), and these into ecoregions (Olson & Dinerstein, 1998, etc.). Each ecoregion is characterized by a main biome (also called major habitat type).\nThis classification is used to define the Global 200 list of ecoregions identified by the WWF as priorities for conservation.\nFor the terrestrial ecoregions, there is a specific EcoID, format XXnnNN (XX is the biogeographic realm, nn is the biome number, NN is the individual number).\n\n\nBiogeographic realms (terrestrial and freshwater)\n\nThe applicability of the realms scheme above – based on Udvardy (1975)—to most freshwater taxa is unresolved.\n\n\nBiogeographic realms (marine)\n\n\nBiomes (terrestrial)\nTropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests (tropical and subtropical, humid)\nTropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests (tropical and subtropical, semihumid)\nTropical and subtropical coniferous forests (tropical and subtropical, semihumid)\nTemperate broadleaf and mixed forests (temperate, humid)\nTemperate coniferous forests (temperate, humid to semihumid)\nBoreal forests/taiga (subarctic, humid)\nTropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands (tropical and subtropical, semiarid)\nTemperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands (temperate, semiarid)\nFlooded grasslands and savannas (temperate to tropical, fresh or brackish water inundated)\nMontane grasslands and shrublands (alpine or montane climate)\nTundra (Arctic)\nMediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub or sclerophyll forests (temperate warm, semihumid to semiarid with winter rainfall)\nDeserts and xeric shrublands (temperate to tropical, arid)\nMangrove (subtropical and tropical, salt water inundated)\n\n\nBiomes (freshwater)\nAccording to the WWF, the following are classified as freshwater biomes:\n\n\nBiomes (marine)\nBiomes of the coastal and continental shelf areas (neritic zone):\n\nPolar\nTemperate shelves and sea\nTemperate upwelling\nTropical upwelling\nTropical coral\n\n\nSummary of the scheme\nBiosphere\nBiogeographic realms (terrestrial) (8)\nEcoregions (867), each characterized by a biome, a major habitat type (14)\nEcosystems (biotopes)\nBiosphere\nBiogeographic realms (freshwater) (8)\nEcoregions (426), each characterized by a biome, a major habitat type (12)\nEcosystems (biotopes)\nBiosphere\nBiogeographic realms (marine) (12)\n(Marine provinces) (62)\nEcoregions (232), each characterized by a biome, a major habitat type (5)\nEcosystems (biotopes)\nExample:\n\nBiosphere\nBiogeographic realm: Palearctic\nEcoregion: Dinaric Mountains mixed forests (PA0418); biome type: temperate broadleaf and mixed forests\nEcosystem: Orjen, vegetation belt between 1,100 and 1,450 m, Oromediterranean zone, nemoral zone (temperate zone)\nBiotope: Oreoherzogio-Abietetum illyricae Fuk.

As a result, vegetation forms predicted by conventional biome systems can no longer be observed across much of Earth's land surface as they have been replaced by crops and rangelands or cities. Anthropogenic biomes provide an alternative view of the terrestrial biosphere based on global patterns of sustained direct human interaction with ecosystems, including agriculture, human settlements, urbanization, forestry and other uses of land. Anthropogenic biomes offer a way to recognize the irreversible coupling of human and ecological systems at global scales and manage Earth's biosphere and anthropogenic biomes.\n\nMajor anthropogenic biomes:\n\nDense settlements\nCroplands\nRangelands\nForested\nIndoor\n\n\nMicrobial biomes\n\n\nEndolithic biomes\nThe endolithic biome, consisting entirely of microscopic life in rock pores and cracks, kilometers beneath the surface, has only recently been discovered, and does not fit well into most classification schemes.\n\n\nEffects of climate change\nAnthropogenic climate change has the potential to greatly alter the distribution of Earth's biomes. Meaning, biomes around the world could change so much that they would be at risk of becoming new biomes entirely. More specifically, between 54% and 22% of global land area will experience climates that correspond to other biomes. 3.6% of land area will experience climates that are completely new or unusual. An example of a biome shift is woody plant encroachment, which can change grass savanna into shrub savanna.\n\nAverage temperatures have risen more than twice the usual amount in both arctic and mountainous biomes, which leads to the conclusion that arctic and mountainous biomes are currently the most vulnerable to climate change. South American terrestrial biomes have been predicted to go through the same temperature trends as arctic and mountainous biomes. With its annual average temperature continuing to increase, the moisture currently located in forest biomes will dry up.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nRitter, Michael E. (2005).
