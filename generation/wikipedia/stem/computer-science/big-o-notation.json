  "extract": "Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the approximate size of a function on a domain. Big O is a member of a family of notations invented by German mathematicians Paul Bachmann and  Edmund Landau \n\nand expanded by others, collectively called Bachmann–Landau notation.  The letter O was chosen by Bachmann to stand for Ordnung, meaning the order of approximation.\nIn computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements\n grow as the input size grows.  \nIn analytic number theory, big O notation is often used to express bounds on the growth of an arithmetical function; one well-known example is the remainder term in the prime number theorem.\nIn mathematical analysis, including calculus,\nBig O notation is used to bound the error when truncating a power series and to express the quality\nof approximation of a real or complex valued function\nby a simpler function.\nOften, big O notation characterizes functions according to their growth rates as the variable becomes large: different functions with the same asymptotic growth rate may be represented using the same O notation. The letter O is used because the growth rate of a function is also referred to as the order of the function.  A description of a function in terms of big O notation only provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the function.\nAssociated with big O notation are several related notations, using the symbols \n  \n    \n      \n        o\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle o}\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        ∼\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sim }\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        Ω\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Omega }\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        ≪\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ll }\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        ≫\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gg }\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        ≍\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\asymp }\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        ω\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\omega }\n  \n, and \n  \n    \n      \n        Θ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Theta }\n  \n to describe other kinds of bounds on  growth rates.\n\n\nFormal definition\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle f,}\n  \n the function to be estimated, be either a real or complex valued function defined on a domain \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle D,}\n  \n and let \n  \n    \n      \n        g\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle g,}\n  \n the comparison function, be a non-negative real valued function defined on the same set \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle D.}\n  \n Common choices for the domain are intervals of real numbers, bounded or unbounded, the set of positive integers, the set of complex numbers and tuples of real/complex numbers.

In most applications, one chooses the function \n  \n    \n      \n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle g(x)}\n  \n appearing within the argument of \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        \n          \n            (\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          \n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle O{\\bigl (}\\cdot {\\bigr )}}\n  \n to be as simple a form as possible, omitting constant factors and lower order terms.

When using big \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle O}\n  \n notation, what matters is that some finite \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  \n exists, not its specific value. This simplifies the presentation of many analytic inequalities.\nFor functions defined on positive real numbers or positive integers, a more restrictive and somewhat conflicting definition\nis still in common use, especially in computer science. \nWhen restricted to functions which are eventually positive, the notation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        O\n        \n          \n            (\n          \n        \n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n          \n            )\n          \n        \n        \n         \n        \n          \n            a\n            s\n          \n        \n        \n        x\n        →\n        ∞\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=O{\\bigl (}g(x){\\bigr )}\\qquad ~{\\mathsf {as}}\\quad x\\to \\infty }\n  \n\nmeans that for some real number \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle a,}\n  \n \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        O\n        \n          \n            (\n          \n        \n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n          \n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle f(x)=O{\\bigl (}g(x){\\bigr )}}\n  \n in the domain \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          [\n          \n            a\n            ,\n            ∞\n          \n          )\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle \\left[a,\\infty \\right).}\n  \n Here, the expression \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        →\n        ∞\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle x\\to \\infty }\n  \n doesn't indicate a limit, but the notion that the inequality holds for large enough \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle x.}\n  \n The expression \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        →\n        ∞\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle x\\to \\infty }\n  \n often is omitted.\nSimilarly, for a finite real number \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle a,}\n  \n the notation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        O\n        \n          \n            (\n          \n        \n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n          \n            )\n          \n        \n        \n         \n        \n           as \n        \n         \n        x\n        →\n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=O{\\bigl (}g(x){\\bigr )}\\qquad ~{\\text{ as }}\\ x\\to a}\n  \n\nmeans that for some constant \n  \n    \n      \n        c\n        >\n        0\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle c>0,}\n  \n \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        O\n        \n          \n            (\n          \n        \n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n          \n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle f(x)=O{\\bigl (}g(x){\\bigr )}}\n  \n on the interval \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          [\n          \n            a\n            −\n            c\n            ,\n            a\n            +\n            c\n          \n          ]\n        \n        ;\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left[a-c,a+c\\right];}\n  \n that is, in a small neighborhood of \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a.}\n  \n\nIn addition, the notation\n\n  \n    \n      \n         \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        +\n        O\n        \n          \n            (\n          \n        \n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n          \n            )\n          \n        \n         \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ f(x)=h(x)+O{\\bigl (}g(x){\\bigr )}\\ }\n  \n\nmeans \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        −\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        O\n        \n          \n            (\n          \n        \n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n          \n            )\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle f(x)-h(x)=O{\\bigl (}g(x){\\bigr )}.}\n  \n More complicated expressions are also possible.\nDespite the presence of the equal sign (=) as written, the expression \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        O\n        \n          \n            (\n          \n        \n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n          \n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle f(x)=O{\\bigl (}g(x){\\bigr )}}\n  \n does not refer to an equality, but rather to an inequality relating \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle f}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        g\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle g.}\n  \n\nIn the 1930s, the Russian number theorist I.M.

In this setting, the contribution of the terms that grow \"most quickly\" will eventually make the other ones irrelevant. As a result, the following simplification rules can be applied:\n\nIf \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)}\n  \n is a sum of several terms, if there is one with largest growth rate, it can be kept, and all others omitted.\nIf \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)}\n  \n is a product of several factors, any constants (factors in the product that do not depend on \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n) can be omitted.\nFor example, let \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        6\n        \n          x\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n        −\n        2\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        +\n        5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=6x^{4}-2x^{3}+5}\n  \n, and suppose we wish to simplify this function, using \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O}\n  \n notation, to describe its growth rate for large \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n. This function is the sum of three terms: \n  \n    \n      \n        6\n        \n          x\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 6x^{4}}\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        −\n        2\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle -2x^{3}}\n  \n, and \n  \n    \n      \n        5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 5}\n  \n. Of these three terms, the one with the highest growth rate is the one with the largest exponent as a function of \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n, namely \n  \n    \n      \n        6\n        \n          x\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 6x^{4}}\n  \n. Now one may apply the second rule: \n  \n    \n      \n        6\n        \n          x\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 6x^{4}}\n  \nis a product of \n  \n    \n      \n        6\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 6}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{4}}\n  \n in which the first factor does not depend on \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n. Omitting this factor results in the simplified form \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{4}}\n  \n. Thus, we say that \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)}\n  \n is a \"big O\" of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{4}}\n  \n. Mathematically, we can write \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        O\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=O(x^{4})}\n  \n for all \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        ≥\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\geq 1}\n  \n. One may confirm this calculation using the formal definition: let \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        6\n        \n          x\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n        −\n        2\n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        +\n        5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=6x^{4}-2x^{3}+5}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle g(x)=x^{4}}\n  \n.

Some authors write O* for the same purpose as the latter definition. Essentially, it is big O notation, ignoring logarithmic factors because the growth-rate effects of some other super-logarithmic function indicate a growth-rate explosion for large-sized input parameters that is more important to predicting bad run-time performance than the finer-point effects contributed by the logarithmic-growth factor(s). This notation is often used to obviate the \"nitpicking\" within growth-rates that are stated as too tightly bounded for the matters at hand (since \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          log\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        ⁡\n        n\n        =\n        o\n        (\n        \n          n\n          \n            ε\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\log ^{k}n=o(n^{\\varepsilon })}\n  \n\nfor any constant \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n  \n and any \n\n  \n    \n      \n        ε\n        >\n        0.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon >0.}\n  \n\nAlso, the L notation, defined as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          L\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        [\n        α\n        ,\n        c\n        ]\n        =\n        \n          e\n          \n            (\n            c\n            +\n            o\n            (\n            1\n            )\n            )\n            (\n            ln\n            ⁡\n            n\n            \n              )\n              \n                α\n              \n            \n            (\n            ln\n            ⁡\n            ln\n            ⁡\n            n\n            \n              )\n              \n                1\n                −\n                α\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L_{n}[\\alpha ,c]=e^{(c+o(1))(\\ln n)^{\\alpha }(\\ln \\ln n)^{1-\\alpha }},}\n  \n\nis convenient for functions that are between polynomial and exponential in terms of \n  \n    \n      \n        log\n        ⁡\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\log n}\n  \n.\n\n\nGeneralizations and related usages\nThe generalization to functions taking values in any normed vector space is straightforward (replacing absolute values by norms), where \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        g\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle g}\n  \n need not take their values in the same space.

In another letter, Knuth also pointed out that\n\nthe equality sign is not symmetric with respect to such notations [as, in this notation,] mathematicians customarily use the '=' sign as they use the word 'is' in English: Aristotle is a man, but a man isn't necessarily Aristotle.\nFor these reasons, some advocate for using set notation and write \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ∈\n        O\n        (\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)\\in O(g(x))}\n  \n,\nread as  \"\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)}\n  \n is an element of \n\n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(g(x))}\n  \n\", or \"\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)}\n  \n is in the set \n\n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(g(x))}\n  \n\" –  thinking of \n\n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(g(x))}\n  \n as the class of all functions \n\n  \n    \n      \n        h\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h(x)}\n  \n such that \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        O\n        (\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h(x)=O(g(x))}\n  \n.

In TeX, it is produced by simply typing 'O' inside math mode.  Unlike Greek-named Bachmann–Landau notations, it needs no special symbol. However, some authors use the calligraphic variant \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            O\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}}\n  \n instead.\nThe big-O originally stands for \"order of\" (\"Ordnung\", Bachmann 1894), and is thus a Latin letter. Neither Bachmann nor Landau ever call it \"Omicron\". The symbol was much later on (1976) viewed by Knuth as a capital omicron, probably in reference to his definition of the symbol Omega. The digit zero should not be used.\n\n\nSee also\nAsymptotic computational complexity\nAsymptotic expansion: Approximation of functions by a series, generalizing Taylor's formula\nAsymptotically optimal algorithm: A phrase frequently used to describe an algorithm that has an upper bound asymptotically within a constant of a lower bound for the problem\nBig O in probability notation: Op, op\nLimit inferior and limit superior: An explanation of some of the limit notation used in this article\nMaster theorem (analysis of algorithms): For analyzing divide-and-conquer recursive algorithms using big O notation\nNachbin's theorem: A precise method of bounding complex analytic functions so that the domain of convergence of integral transforms can be stated\nOrder of approximation\nOrder of accuracy\nComputational complexity of mathematical operations\n\n\nReferences and notes\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nFurther reading\nKnuth, Donald (1997). \"1.2.11: Asymptotic Representations\".
