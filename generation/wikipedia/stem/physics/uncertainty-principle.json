It states that there is a limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, can be simultaneously known. In other words, the more accurately one property is measured, the less accurately the other property can be known.\nMore formally, the uncertainty principle is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the product of the accuracy of certain related pairs of measurements on a quantum system, such as position, x, and momentum, p. Such paired-variables are known as complementary variables or canonically conjugate variables.\nFirst introduced in 1927 by German physicist Werner Heisenberg, the formal inequality relating the standard deviation of position σx and the standard deviation of momentum σp was derived by Earle Hesse Kennard later that year and by Hermann Weyl in 1928:\n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        ℏ\n        =\n        \n          \n            h\n            \n              2\n              π\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\hbar ={\\frac {h}{2\\pi }}}\n  \n is the reduced Planck constant.\nThe quintessentially quantum mechanical uncertainty principle comes in many forms other than position–momentum. The energy–time relationship is widely used to relate quantum state lifetime to measured energy widths but its formal derivation is fraught with confusing issues about the nature of time. The basic principle has been extended in numerous directions; it must be considered in many kinds of fundamental physical measurements.\n\n\nPosition–momentum\n\nIt is vital to illustrate how the principle applies to relatively intelligible physical situations since it is indiscernible on the macroscopic scales that humans experience. Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The wave mechanics picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract matrix mechanics picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.\nMathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding orthonormal bases in Hilbert space are Fourier transforms of one another (i.e., position and momentum are conjugate variables). A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized at the same time. A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a sharp spike at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave. In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a matter wave, and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation p = ħk, where k is the wavenumber.\nIn matrix mechanics, the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, any pair of non-commuting self-adjoint operators representing observables are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable A is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate Ψ of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable A need not be an eigenstate of another observable B: If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.\n\n\nVisualization\nThe uncertainty principle can be visualized using the position- and momentum-space wavefunctions for one spinless particle with mass in one dimension.\nThe more localized the position-space wavefunction, the more likely the particle is to be found with the position coordinates in that region, and correspondingly the momentum-space wavefunction is less localized so the possible momentum components the particle could have are more widespread. Conversely, the more localized the momentum-space wavefunction, the more likely the particle is to be found with those values of momentum components in that region, and correspondingly the less localized the position-space wavefunction, so the position coordinates the particle could occupy are more widespread. These wavefunctions are Fourier transforms of each other: mathematically, the uncertainty principle expresses the relationship between conjugate variables in the transform.\n\n\nWave mechanics interpretation\n\nAccording to the de Broglie hypothesis, every object in the universe is associated with a wave. Thus every object, from an elementary particle to atoms, molecules and on up to planets and beyond are subject to the uncertainty principle.\nThe time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber k0 or momentum p0 is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ψ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ∝\n        \n          e\n          \n            i\n            \n              k\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n            x\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          e\n          \n            i\n            \n              p\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n            x\n            \n              /\n            \n            ℏ\n          \n        \n         \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\psi (x)\\propto e^{ik_{0}x}=e^{ip_{0}x/\\hbar }~.}\n  \n\nThe Born rule states that this should be interpreted as a probability density amplitude function in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between a and b is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        ⁡\n        [\n        a\n        ≤\n        X\n        ≤\n        b\n        ]\n        =\n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        \n          |\n        \n        ψ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n          \n            |\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n        \n          d\n        \n        x\n         \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {P} [a\\leq X\\leq b]=\\int _{a}^{b}|\\psi (x)|^{2}\\,\\mathrm {d} x~.}\n  \n\nIn the case of the single-mode plane wave, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        ψ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n          \n            |\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |\\psi (x)|^{2}}\n  \n is 1 if \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        =\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X=x}\n  \n and 0 otherwise. In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet.\nOn the other hand, consider a wave function that is a sum of many waves, which we may write as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ψ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ∝\n        \n          ∑\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        \n          A\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        \n          e\n          \n            i\n            \n              p\n              \n                n\n              \n            \n            x\n            \n              /\n            \n            ℏ\n          \n        \n         \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\psi (x)\\propto \\sum _{n}A_{n}e^{ip_{n}x/\\hbar }~,}\n  \n\nwhere An represents the relative contribution of the mode pn to the overall total. The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an integral over all possible modes\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ψ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              2\n              π\n              ℏ\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            −\n            ∞\n          \n          \n            ∞\n          \n        \n        φ\n        (\n        p\n        )\n        ⋅\n        \n          e\n          \n            i\n            p\n            x\n            \n              /\n            \n            ℏ\n          \n        \n        \n        d\n        p\n         \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\psi (x)={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {2\\pi \\hbar }}}\\int _{-\\infty }^{\\infty }\\varphi (p)\\cdot e^{ipx/\\hbar }\\,dp~,}\n  \n\nwith \n  \n    \n      \n        φ\n        (\n        p\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi (p)}\n  \n representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in momentum space.

Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.\nOne way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the standard deviation σ.

Another way of stating this is that σx and σp have an inverse relationship or are at least bounded from below.

For example, if a particle's position is measured, then the state amounts to a position eigenstate. This means that the state is not a momentum eigenstate, however, but rather it can be represented as a sum of multiple momentum basis eigenstates. In other words, the momentum must be less precise. This precision may be quantified by the standard deviations,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          σ\n          \n            x\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            ⟨\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    x\n                    ^\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            ⟩\n            −\n            ⟨\n            \n              \n                \n                  x\n                  ^\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              ⟩\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{x}={\\sqrt {\\langle {\\hat {x}}^{2}\\rangle -\\langle {\\hat {x}}\\rangle ^{2}}}}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          σ\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            ⟨\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    p\n                    ^\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            ⟩\n            −\n            ⟨\n            \n              \n                \n                  p\n                  ^\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              ⟩\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{p}={\\sqrt {\\langle {\\hat {p}}^{2}\\rangle -\\langle {\\hat {p}}\\rangle ^{2}}}.}\n  \n\nAs in the wave mechanics interpretation above, one sees a tradeoff between the respective precisions of the two, quantified by the uncertainty principle.\n\n\nQuantum harmonic oscillator stationary states\n\nConsider a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator.

To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in spectroscopy, excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time–energy uncertainty principle, they do not have a definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the natural linewidth. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow-decaying states have a narrow linewidth. The same linewidth effect also makes it difficult to specify the rest mass of unstable, fast-decaying particles in particle physics. The faster the particle decays (the shorter its lifetime), the less certain is its mass (the larger the particle's width).\n\n\nTime in quantum mechanics\nThe concept of \"time\" in quantum mechanics offers many challenges. There is no quantum theory of time measurement; relativity is both fundamental to time and difficult to include in quantum mechanics. While position and momentum are associated with a single particle, time is a system property: it has no operator needed for the Robertson–Schrödinger relation. The mathematical treatment of stable and unstable quantum systems differ. These factors combine to make energy–time uncertainty principles controversial.\nThree notions of \"time\" can be distinguished: external, intrinsic, and observable. External or laboratory time is seen by the experimenter; intrinsic time is inferred by changes in dynamic variables, like the hands of a clock or the motion of a free particle; observable time concerns time as an observable, the measurement of time-separated events.\nAn external-time energy–time uncertainty principle might say that measuring the energy of a quantum system to an accuracy \n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta E}\n  \n requires a time interval \n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        t\n        >\n        h\n        \n          /\n        \n        Δ\n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta t>h/\\Delta E}\n  \n. However, Yakir Aharonov and David Bohm have shown that, in some quantum systems, energy can be measured accurately within an arbitrarily short time: external-time uncertainty principles are not universal.\nIntrinsic time is the basis for several formulations of energy–time uncertainty relations, including the Mandelstam–Tamm relation discussed in the next section. A physical system with an intrinsic time closely matching the external laboratory time is called a \"clock\".\nObservable time, measuring time between two events, remains a challenge for quantum theories; some progress has been made using  positive operator-valued measure concepts.\n\n\nMandelstam–Tamm\nIn 1945, Leonid Mandelstam and Igor Tamm derived a non-relativistic time–energy uncertainty relation as follows.

The mass-energy and lifetime of these particles are related by the energy–time uncertainty relation. The energy of a quantum systems is not known with enough precision to limit their behavior to a single, simple history. Thus the influence of all histories must be incorporated into quantum calculations, including those with much greater or much less energy than the mean of the measured/calculated energy distribution.\nThe energy–time uncertainty principle does not temporarily violate conservation of energy; it does not imply that energy can be \"borrowed\" from the universe as long as it is \"returned\" within a short amount of time. The energy of the universe is not an exactly known parameter at all times. When events transpire at very short time intervals, there is uncertainty in the energy of these events.\n\n\nHarmonic analysis\n\nIn the context of harmonic analysis the uncertainty principle implies that one cannot at the same time localize the value of a function and its Fourier transform.

In practice, the Gabor limit limits the simultaneous time–frequency resolution one can achieve without interference; it is possible to achieve higher resolution, but at the cost of different components of the signal interfering with each other.\nAs a result, in order to analyze signals where the transients are important, the wavelet transform is often used instead of the Fourier.\n\n\nDiscrete Fourier transform\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          {\n          \n            \n              x\n              \n                n\n              \n            \n          \n          }\n        \n        :=\n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            N\n            −\n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left\\{\\mathbf {x_{n}} \\right\\}:=x_{0},x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{N-1}}\n  \n be a sequence of N complex numbers and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          {\n          \n            \n              X\n              \n                k\n              \n            \n          \n          }\n        \n        :=\n        \n          X\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          X\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        \n          X\n          \n            N\n            −\n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left\\{\\mathbf {X_{k}} \\right\\}:=X_{0},X_{1},\\ldots ,X_{N-1},}\n  \n be its  discrete Fourier transform.\nDenote by \n  \n    \n      \n        ‖\n        x\n        \n          ‖\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\|x\\|_{0}}\n  \n the number of non-zero elements in the time sequence \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            N\n            −\n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{0},x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{N-1}}\n  \n and by \n  \n    \n      \n        ‖\n        X\n        \n          ‖\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\|X\\|_{0}}\n  \n the number of non-zero elements in the frequency sequence \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          X\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          X\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        \n          X\n          \n            N\n            −\n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X_{0},X_{1},\\ldots ,X_{N-1}}\n  \n.

and Jaming for the general case. Note that Hörmander–Beurling's version implies the case ab > 1 in Hardy's Theorem while the version by Bonami–Demange–Jaming covers the full strength of Hardy's Theorem. A different proof of Beurling's theorem based on Liouville's theorem appeared in ref.\nA full description of the case ab < 1 as well as the following extension to Schwartz class distributions appears in ref.\n\n\nAdditional uncertainty relations\n\n\nHeisenberg limit\nIn quantum metrology, and especially interferometry, the Heisenberg limit is the optimal rate at which the accuracy of a measurement can scale with the energy used in the measurement. Typically, this is the measurement of a phase (applied to one arm of a beam-splitter) and the energy is given by the number of photons used in an interferometer. Although some claim to have broken the Heisenberg limit, this reflects disagreement on the definition of the scaling resource. Suitably defined, the Heisenberg limit is a consequence of the basic principles of quantum mechanics and cannot be beaten, although the weak Heisenberg limit can be beaten.\n\n\nSystematic and statistical errors\nThe inequalities above focus on the statistical imprecision of observables as quantified by the standard deviation \n  \n    \n      \n        σ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma }\n  \n. Heisenberg's original version, however, was dealing with the systematic error, a disturbance of the quantum system produced by the measuring apparatus, i.e., an observer effect.\nIf we let \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ε\n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon _{A}}\n  \n represent the error (i.e., inaccuracy) of a measurement of an observable A and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          η\n          \n            B\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\eta _{B}}\n  \n the disturbance produced on a subsequent measurement of the conjugate variable B by the former measurement of A, then the inequality proposed by Masanao Ozawa − encompassing both systematic and statistical errors - holds:\n\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle, as originally described in the 1927 formulation, mentions only the first term of Ozawa inequality, regarding the systematic error. Using the notation above to describe the error/disturbance effect of sequential measurements (first A, then B), it could be written as\n\nThe formal derivation of the Heisenberg relation is possible but far from intuitive. It was not proposed by Heisenberg, but formulated in a mathematically consistent way only in recent years.\nAlso, it must be stressed that the Heisenberg formulation is not taking into account the intrinsic statistical errors \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          σ\n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{A}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          σ\n          \n            B\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{B}}\n  \n. There is increasing experimental evidence that the total quantum uncertainty cannot be described by the Heisenberg term alone, but requires the presence of all the three terms of the Ozawa inequality.\nUsing the same formalism, it is also possible to introduce the other kind of physical situation, often confused with the previous one, namely the case of simultaneous measurements (A and B at the same time):\n\nThe two simultaneous measurements on A and B are necessarily unsharp or weak.\nIt is also possible to derive an uncertainty relation that, as the Ozawa's one, combines both the statistical and systematic error components, but keeps a form very close to the Heisenberg original inequality.

For example, uncertainty relations in which one of the observables is an angle has little physical meaning for fluctuations larger than one period. Other examples include highly bimodal distributions, or unimodal distributions with divergent variance.\nA solution that overcomes these issues is an uncertainty based on entropic uncertainty instead of the product of variances. While formulating the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics in 1957, Hugh Everett III conjectured a stronger extension of the uncertainty principle based on entropic certainty. This conjecture, also studied by I. I. Hirschman and proven in 1975 by W. Beckner and by Iwo Bialynicki-Birula and Jerzy Mycielski is that, for two normalized, dimensionless Fourier transform pairs f(a) and g(b) where\n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        a\n

A few remarks on these inequalities. First, the choice of base e is a matter of popular convention in physics. The logarithm can alternatively be in any base, provided that it be consistent on both sides of the inequality. Second, recall the Shannon entropy has been used, not the quantum von Neumann entropy. Finally, the normal distribution saturates the inequality, and it is the only distribution with this property, because it is the maximum entropy probability distribution among those with fixed variance (cf. here for proof).\n\nA measurement apparatus will have a finite resolution set by the discretization of its possible outputs into bins, with the probability of lying within one of the bins given by the Born rule. We will consider the most common experimental situation, in which the bins are of uniform size. Let δx be a measure of the spatial resolution. We take the zeroth bin to be centered near the origin, with possibly some small constant offset c.

Working with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, he continued to develop matrix mechanics, that would become the first modern quantum mechanics formulation. \n\nIn March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-commutativity implies the uncertainty principle. Writing to Wolfgang Pauli in February 1927, he worked out the basic concepts.\nIn his celebrated 1927 paper \"Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik\" (\"On the Perceptual Content of Quantum Theoretical Kinematics and Mechanics\"), Heisenberg established this expression as the minimum amount of unavoidable momentum disturbance caused by any position measurement, but he did not give a precise definition for the uncertainties Δx and Δp. Instead, he gave some plausible estimates in each case separately. His paper gave an analysis in terms of a microscope that Bohr showed was incorrect; Heisenberg included an addendum to the publication.\nIn his 1930 Chicago lecture he refined his principle:\n\nLater work broadened the concept. Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously—the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known. Heisenberg wrote:It can be expressed in its simplest form as follows: One can never know with perfect accuracy both of those two important factors which determine the movement of one of the smallest particles—its position and its velocity. It is impossible to determine accurately both the position and the direction and speed of a particle at the same instant.\nKennard in 1927 first proved the modern inequality:\n\nwhere ħ = ⁠h/2π⁠, and σx, σp are the standard deviations of position and momentum. (Heisenberg only proved relation (A2) for the special case of Gaussian states.) In 1929 Robertson generalized the inequality to all observables and in 1930 Schrödinger extended the form to allow non-zero covariance of the operators; this result is referred to as Robertson-Schrödinger inequality.\n\n\nTerminology and translation\nThroughout the main body of his original 1927 paper, written in German, Heisenberg used the word \"Ungenauigkeit\", (Eng: Imprecision)\nto describe the basic theoretical principle. Only in the endnote did he switch to the word \"Unsicherheit\" (Eng: Uncertainty). Later on, he always used \"Unbestimmtheit\" (Eng: Indefiniteness). When the English-language version of Heisenberg's textbook, The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory, was published in 1930, however, only the English word \"uncertainty\" was used, and it became the term in the English language.\n\n\nHeisenberg's microscope\n\nThe principle is quite counter-intuitive, so the early students of quantum theory had to be reassured that naive measurements to violate it were bound always to be unworkable. One way in which Heisenberg originally illustrated the intrinsic impossibility of violating the uncertainty principle is by using the observer effect of an imaginary microscope as a measuring device.\nHe imagines an experimenter trying to measure the position and momentum of an electron by shooting a photon at it.\n\nProblem 1 – If the photon has a short wavelength, and therefore, a large momentum, the position can be measured accurately. But the photon scatters in a random direction, transferring a large and uncertain amount of momentum to the electron. If the photon has a long wavelength and low momentum, the collision does not disturb the electron's momentum very much, but the scattering will reveal its position only vaguely.\nProblem 2 – If a large aperture is used for the microscope, the electron's location can be well resolved (see Rayleigh criterion); but by the principle of conservation of momentum, the transverse momentum of the incoming photon affects the electron's beamline momentum and hence, the new momentum of the electron resolves poorly. If a small aperture is used, the accuracy of both resolutions is the other way around.\nThe combination of these trade-offs implies that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used, the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit, which is (up to a small numerical factor) equal to the Planck constant. Heisenberg did not care to formulate the uncertainty principle as an exact limit, and preferred to use it instead, as a heuristic quantitative statement, correct up to small numerical factors, which makes the radically new noncommutativity of quantum mechanics inevitable.\n\n\nIntrinsic quantum uncertainty\nHistorically, the uncertainty principle has been confused with a related effect in physics, called the observer effect, which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the system, that is, without changing something in a system. Heisenberg used such an observer effect at the quantum level (see below) as a physical \"explanation\" of quantum uncertainty. It has since become clearer, however, that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all wave-like systems, and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects. Thus, the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology.\n\n\nCritical reactions\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle were, in fact, initially seen as twin targets by detractors. According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, there is no fundamental reality that the quantum state describes, just a prescription for calculating experimental results. There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.\nAlbert Einstein believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while Niels Bohr believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform. Einstein and Bohr debated the uncertainty principle for many years.\n\n\nIdeal detached observer\nWolfgang Pauli called Einstein's fundamental objection to the uncertainty principle \"the ideal of the detached observer\" (phrase translated from the German):\n\n\"Like the moon has a definite position,\" Einstein said to me last winter, \"whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects. Observation cannot create an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.\" I hope, that I quoted Einstein correctly; it is always difficult to quote somebody out of memory with whom one does not agree. It is precisely this kind of postulate which I call the ideal of the detached observer.\n\n\nEinstein's slit\nThe first of Einstein's thought experiments challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows:\n\nConsider a particle passing through a slit of width d. The slit introduces an uncertainty in momentum of approximately ⁠h/d⁠ because the particle passes through the wall. But let us determine the momentum of the particle by measuring the recoil of the wall. In doing so, we find the momentum of the particle to arbitrary accuracy by conservation of momentum.\nBohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy Δp, the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through. This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to ⁠h/Δp⁠, and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.\nA similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by Richard Feynman.\n\n\nEinstein's box\nBohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as Einstein's box. Einstein argued that \"Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to the Planck constant.\" Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely. The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape. \"We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box.\" \"Now, weigh the box again. The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light. In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle.\"\nBohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed. He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, \"since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table. ... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the Earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock\", because of Einstein's own theory of gravity's effect on time. \"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape.\"\n\n\nEPR paradox for entangled particles\n\nIn 1935, Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen published an analysis of spatially separated entangled particles (EPR paradox). According to EPR, one could measure the position of one of the entangled particles and the momentum of the second particle, and from those measurements deduce the position and momentum of both particles to any precision, violating the uncertainty principle. In order to avoid such possibility, the measurement of one particle must modify the probability distribution of the other particle instantaneously, possibly violating the principle of locality.\nIn 1964, John Stewart Bell showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out EPR's basic assumption of local hidden variables.\n\n\nPopper's criticism\n\nScience philosopher Karl Popper approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and metaphysical realist. He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to ensembles of identically prepared particles, referring to them as \"statistical scatter relations\". In this statistical interpretation, a particular measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory.\nIn 1934, Popper published Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen (\"Critique of the Uncertainty Relations\") in Naturwissenschaften, and in the same year Logik der Forschung (translated and updated by the author as The Logic of Scientific Discovery in 1959), outlining his arguments for the statistical interpretation. In 1982, he further developed his theory in Quantum theory and the schism in Physics, writing:\n\n[Heisenberg's] formulae are, beyond all doubt, derivable statistical formulae of the quantum theory. But they have been habitually misinterpreted by those quantum theorists who said that these formulae can be interpreted as determining some upper limit to the precision of our measurements. [original emphasis]\nPopper proposed an experiment to falsify the uncertainty relations, although he later withdrew his initial version after discussions with Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Heisenberg, and Einstein; Popper sent his paper to Einstein and  it may have influenced the formulation of the EPR paradox.\n\n\nFree will\nSome scientists, including Arthur Compton and Martin Heisenberg, have suggested that the uncertainty principle, or at least the general probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, could be evidence for the two-stage model of free will. One critique, however, is that apart from the basic role of quantum mechanics as a foundation for chemistry, nontrivial biological mechanisms requiring quantum mechanics are unlikely, due to the rapid decoherence time of quantum systems at room temperature. Proponents of this theory commonly say that this decoherence is overcome by both screening and decoherence-free subspaces found in biological cells.\n\n\nThermodynamics\nThere is reason to believe that violating the uncertainty principle also strongly implies the violation of the second law of thermodynamics. See Gibbs paradox.\n\n\nRejection of the principle\nUncertainty principles relate quantum particles – electrons for example – to classical concepts – position and momentum. This presumes quantum particles have position and momentum. Edwin C. Kemble pointed out in 1937 that such properties cannot be experimentally verified and assuming they exist gives rise to many contradictions; similarly Rudolf Haag notes that position in quantum mechanics is an attribute of an interaction, say between an electron and a detector, not an intrinsic property. From this point of view the uncertainty principle is not a fundamental quantum property but a concept \"carried over from the language of our ancestors\", as Kemble says.\n\n\nApplications\nSince the uncertainty principle is such a basic result in quantum mechanics, typical experiments in quantum mechanics routinely observe aspects of it. All forms of spectroscopy, including particle physics use the relationship to relate measured energy line-width to the lifetime of quantum states. Certain experiments, however, may deliberately test a particular form of the uncertainty principle as part of their main research program. These include, for example, tests of number–phase uncertainty relations in superconducting or quantum optics systems. Applications dependent on the uncertainty principle for their operation include extremely low-noise technology such as that required in gravitational wave interferometers.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Uncertainty principle\", Encyclopedia of Mathematics, EMS Press, 2001 [1994]\nStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry",
