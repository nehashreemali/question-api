The average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval; the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero. Speed is the magnitude of velocity (a vector), which indicates additionally the direction of motion.\nSpeed has the dimensions of distance divided by time. The SI unit of speed is the metre per second (m/s), but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour (km/h) or, in the US and the UK, miles per hour (mph). For air and marine travel, the knot is commonly used.\nThe fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel, according to special relativity, is the speed of light in vacuum c = 299792458 metres per second (approximately 1079000000 km/h or 671000000 mph). Matter cannot quite reach the speed of light, as this would require an infinite amount of energy. In relativity physics, the concept of rapidity replaces the classical idea of speed.\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\nHistorical definition\nItalian physicist Galileo Galilei is usually credited with being the first to measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes. Galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time. In equation form, that is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        v\n        =\n        \n          \n            d\n            t\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v={\\frac {d}{t}},}\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  \n is speed, \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n  \n is distance, and \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t}\n  \n is time. A cyclist who covers 30 metres in a time of 2 seconds, for example, has a speed of 15 metres per second. Objects in motion often have variations in speed (a car might travel along a street at 50 km/h, slow to 0 km/h, and then reach 30 km/h).\n\n\nInstantaneous speed\nSpeed at some instant, or assumed constant during a very short period of time, is called instantaneous speed. By looking at a speedometer, one can read the instantaneous speed of a car at any instant. A car travelling at 50 km/h generally goes for less than one hour at a constant speed, but if it did go at that speed for a full hour, it would travel 50 km. If the vehicle continued at that speed for half an hour, it would cover half that distance (25 km). If it continued for only one minute, it would cover about 833 m.\nIn mathematical terms, the instantaneous speed \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  \n is defined as the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          v\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {v}}}\n  \n, that is, the derivative of the position \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          r\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {r}}}\n  \n with respect to time:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        v\n        =\n        \n          |\n          \n            v\n          \n          |\n        \n        =\n        \n          |\n          \n            \n              \n                r\n                ˙\n              \n            \n          \n          |\n        \n        =\n        \n          |\n          \n            \n              \n                d\n                \n                  r\n                \n              \n              \n                d\n                t\n              \n            \n          \n          |\n        \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v=\\left|{\\boldsymbol {v}}\\right|=\\left|{\\dot {\\boldsymbol {r}}}\\right|=\\left|{\\frac {d{\\boldsymbol {r}}}{dt}}\\right|\\,.}\n  \n\nIf \n  \n    \n      \n        s\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s}\n  \n is the length of the path (also known as the distance) travelled until time \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t}\n  \n, the speed equals the time derivative of \n  \n    \n      \n        s\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s}\n  \n:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        v\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              s\n            \n            \n              d\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v={\\frac {ds}{dt}}.}\n  \n\nIn the special case where the velocity is constant (that is, constant speed in a straight line), this can be simplified to \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n        =\n        s\n        \n          /\n        \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v=s/t}\n  \n.\n\n\nAverage speed\n\nDifferent from instantaneous speed, average speed is defined as the total distance covered divided by the time interval. For example, if a distance of 80 kilometres is driven in 1 hour, the average speed is 80 kilometres per hour. Likewise, if 320 kilometres are travelled in 4 hours, the average speed is also 80 kilometres per hour. When a distance in kilometres (km) is divided by a time in hours (h), the result is in kilometres per hour (km/h).\nAverage speed does not describe the speed variations that may have taken place during shorter time intervals (as it is the entire distance covered divided by the total time of travel), and so average speed is often quite different from a value of instantaneous speed. If the average speed and the time of travel are known, the distance travelled can be calculated by rearranging the definition to\n\n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              v\n              ¯\n            \n          \n        \n        t\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d={\\boldsymbol {\\bar {v}}}t\\,.}\n  \n\nUsing this equation for an average speed of 80 kilometres per hour on a 4-hour trip, the distance covered is found to be 320 kilometres.\nExpressed in graphical language, the slope of a tangent line at any point of a distance-time graph is the instantaneous speed at this point, while the slope of a chord line of the same graph is the average speed during the time interval covered by the chord.\n\n\nDifference between speed and velocity\nSpeed denotes only how fast an object is moving, whereas velocity describes both how fast and in which direction the object is moving. If a car is said to travel at 60 km/h, its speed has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60 km/h to the north, its velocity has now been specified.\nThe big difference can be discerned when considering movement around a circle. When something moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point, its average velocity is zero, but its average speed is found by dividing the circumference of the circle by the time taken to move around the circle. This is because the average velocity is calculated by considering only the displacement between the starting and end points, whereas the average speed considers only the total distance travelled.\n\n\nTangential speed\n\n\nUnits\n\nUnits of speed include:\n\nmetres per second (symbol m s−1 or m/s), the SI derived unit;\nkilometres per hour (symbol km/h);\nmiles per hour (symbol mi/h or mph);\nknots (nautical miles per hour, symbol kn or kt);\nfeet per second (symbol fps or ft/s);\nMach number (dimensionless), speed divided by the speed of sound;\nin natural units (dimensionless), speed divided by the speed of light in vacuum (symbol c = 299792458 m/s).\n (* = approximate values)\n\n\nExamples of different speeds\n\n\nPsychology\nAccording to Jean Piaget, the intuition for the notion of speed in humans precedes that of duration, and is based on the notion of outdistancing. Piaget studied this subject inspired by a question asked to him in 1928 by Albert Einstein: \"In what order do children acquire the concepts of time and speed?\" Children's early concept of speed is based on \"overtaking\", taking only temporal and spatial orders into consideration, specifically: \"A moving object is judged to be more rapid than another when at a given moment the first object is behind and a moment or so later ahead of the other object.\"\n\n\nSee also\nAir speed\nList of vehicle speed records\nTypical projectile speeds\nSpeedometer\nV speeds\n\n\nReferences",
