In classical electromagnetism, the electric field of a single charge (or group of charges) describes their capacity to exert attractive or repulsive forces on another charged object. Charged particles exert attractive forces on each other when the sign of their charges are opposite, one being positive while the other is negative, and repel each other when the signs of the charges are the same. Because these forces are exerted mutually, two charges must be present for the forces to take place. These forces are described by Coulomb's law, which says that the greater the magnitude of the charges, the greater the force, and the greater the distance between them, the weaker the force. Informally, the greater the charge of an object, the stronger its electric field. Similarly, an electric field is stronger nearer charged objects and weaker further away. Electric fields originate from electric charges and time-varying electric currents. Electric fields and magnetic fields are both manifestations of the electromagnetic field. Electromagnetism is one of the four fundamental interactions of nature.\nElectric fields are important in many areas of physics, and are exploited in electrical technology. For example, in atomic physics and chemistry, the interaction in the electric field between the atomic nucleus and electrons is the force that holds these particles together in atoms. Similarly, the interaction in the electric field between atoms is the force responsible for chemical bonding that result in molecules.\nThe electric field is defined as a vector field that associates to each point in space the force per unit of charge exerted on an infinitesimal positive test charge at rest at that point. The SI unit for the electric field is the volt per meter (V/m), which is equal to the newton per coulomb (N/C).\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe electric field is defined at each point in space as the force that would be experienced by an infinitesimally small stationary positive test charge at that point divided by the charge. The electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector (i.e. having both magnitude and direction), so it follows that an electric field may be described by a vector field. The electric field acts between two charges similarly to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, as they both obey an inverse-square law with distance. This is the basis for Coulomb's law, which states that, for stationary charges, the electric field varies with the source charge and varies inversely with the square of the distance from the source. This means that if the source charge were doubled, the electric field would double, and if you move twice as far away from the source, the field at that point would be only one-quarter its original strength.\nThe electric field can be visualized with a set of lines whose direction at each point is the same as those of the field, a concept introduced by Michael Faraday, whose term 'lines of force' is still sometimes used. This illustration has the useful property that, when drawn so that each line represents the same amount of flux, the strength of the field is proportional to the density of the lines. Field lines due to stationary charges have several important properties, including that they always originate from positive charges and terminate at negative charges, they enter all good conductors at right angles, and they never cross or close in on themselves. The field lines are a representative concept; the field actually permeates all the intervening space between the lines. More or fewer lines may be drawn depending on the precision to which it is desired to represent the field. The study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics.\nFaraday's law describes the relationship between a time-varying magnetic field and the electric field. One way of stating Faraday's law is that the curl of the electric field is equal to the negative time derivative of the magnetic field. In the absence of time-varying magnetic field, the electric field is therefore called conservative (i.e. curl-free). This implies there are two kinds of electric fields: electrostatic fields and fields arising from time-varying magnetic fields. While the curl-free nature of the static electric field allows for a simpler treatment using electrostatics, time-varying magnetic fields are generally treated as a component of a unified electromagnetic field. The study of magnetic and electric fields that change over time is called electrodynamics.\n\n\nMathematical formulation\n\nElectric fields are caused by electric charges, described by Gauss's law, and time varying magnetic fields, described by Faraday's law of induction. Together, these laws are enough to define the behavior of the electric field. However, since the magnetic field is described as a function of electric field, the equations of both fields are coupled and together form Maxwell's equations that describe both fields as a function of charges and currents.\n\n\nElectrostatics\n\nIn the special case of a steady state (stationary charges and currents), the Maxwell-Faraday inductive effect disappears.

static, such that magnetic fields are not time-varying, then by Faraday's law, the electric field is curl-free.

Mass is sometimes called \"gravitational charge\".\nElectrostatic and gravitational forces both are central, conservative and obey an inverse-square law.\n\n\nUniform fields\n\nA uniform field is one in which the electric field is constant at every point. It can be approximated by placing two conducting plates parallel to each other and maintaining a voltage (potential difference) between them; it is only an approximation because of boundary effects (near the edge of the planes, the electric field is distorted because the plane does not continue). Assuming infinite planes, the magnitude of the electric field E is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        =\n        −\n        \n          \n            \n              Δ\n              V\n            \n            d\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E=-{\\frac {\\Delta V}{d}},}\n  \n\nwhere ΔV is the potential difference between the plates and d is the distance separating the plates. The negative sign arises as positive charges repel, so a positive charge will experience a force away from the positively charged plate, in the opposite direction to that in which the voltage increases. In micro- and nano-applications, for instance in relation to semiconductors, a typical magnitude of an electric field is in the order of 106 V⋅m−1, achieved by applying a voltage of the order of 1 volt between conductors spaced 1 μm apart.\n\n\nElectromagnetic fields\n\nElectromagnetic fields are electric and magnetic fields, which may change with time, for instance when charges are in motion. Moving charges produce a magnetic field in accordance with Ampère's circuital law (with Maxwell's addition), which, along with Maxwell's other equations, defines the magnetic field, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          B\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {B} }\n  \n, in terms of its curl:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ∇\n        ×\n        \n          B\n        \n        =\n        \n          μ\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              J\n            \n            +\n            \n              ε\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  ∂\n                  \n                    E\n                  \n                \n                \n                  ∂\n                  t\n                \n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nabla \\times \\mathbf {B} =\\mu _{0}\\left(\\mathbf {J} +\\varepsilon _{0}{\\frac {\\partial \\mathbf {E} }{\\partial t}}\\right),}\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          J\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {J} }\n  \n is the current density, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          μ\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{0}}\n  \n is the vacuum permeability, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ε\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon _{0}}\n  \n is the vacuum permittivity.\nBoth the electric current density and the partial derivative of the electric field with respect to time, contribute to the curl of the magnetic field.

The charge of a particle is considered frame invariant, as supported by experimental evidence. Alternatively the electric field of uniformly moving point charges can be derived from the Lorentz transformation of four-force experienced by test charges in the source's rest frame given by Coulomb's law and assigning electric field and magnetic field by their definition given by the form of Lorentz force. However the following equation is only applicable when no acceleration is involved in the particle's history where Coulomb's law can be considered or symmetry arguments can be used for solving Maxwell's equations in a simple manner.

Spherical symmetry is not satisfied due to breaking of symmetry in the problem by specification of direction of velocity for calculation of field. To illustrate this, field lines of moving charges are sometimes represented as unequally spaced radial lines which would appear equally spaced in a co-moving reference frame.\n\n\nPropagation of disturbances in electric fields\n\nSpecial theory of relativity imposes the principle of locality, that requires cause and effect to be time-like separated events where the causal efficacy does not travel faster than the speed of light. Maxwell's laws are found to confirm to this view since the general solutions of fields are given in terms of retarded time which indicate that electromagnetic disturbances travel at the speed of light. Advanced time, which also provides a solution for Maxwell's law are ignored as an unphysical solution. For the motion of a charged particle, considering for example the case of a moving particle with the above described electric field coming to an abrupt stop, the electric fields at points far from it do not immediately revert to that classically given for a stationary charge. On stopping, the field around the stationary points begin to revert to the expected state and this effect propagates outwards at the speed of light while the electric field lines far away from this will continue to point radially towards an assumed moving charge. This virtual particle will never be outside the range of propagation of the disturbance in electromagnetic field, since charged particles are restricted to have speeds slower than that of light, which makes it impossible to construct a Gaussian surface in this region that violates Gauss's law. Another technical difficulty that supports this is that charged particles travelling faster than or equal to speed of light no longer have a unique retarded time. Since electric field lines are continuous, an electromagnetic pulse of radiation is generated that connects at the boundary of this disturbance travelling outwards at the speed of light. In general, any accelerating point charge radiates electromagnetic waves however, non-radiating acceleration is possible in a systems of charges.\n\n\nArbitrarily moving point charge\n\nFor arbitrarily moving point charges, propagation of potential fields such as Lorenz gauge fields at the speed of light needs to be accounted for by using Liénard–Wiechert potential. Since the potentials satisfy Maxwell's equations, the fields derived for point charge also satisfy Maxwell's equations. The electric field is expressed as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n        \n        (\n        \n          r\n        \n        ,\n        \n          t\n        \n        )\n        =\n

However, there have been theories exploring the advanced time solutions of Maxwell's equations, such as Feynman Wheeler absorber theory.\nThe above equation, although consistent with that of uniformly moving point charges as well as its non-relativistic limit, are not corrected for quantum-mechanical effects.\n\n\nCommon formulas\n\nElectric field infinitely close to a conducting surface in electrostatic equilibrium having charge density \n  \n    \n      \n        σ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma }\n  \n at that point is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            σ\n            \n              ε\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n              \n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle {\\frac {\\sigma }{\\varepsilon _{0}}}{\\hat {\\mathbf {x} }}}\n  \n since charges are only formed on the surface and the surface at the infinitesimal scale resembles an infinite 2D plane.
