Its discovery was a significant landmark in the development of quantum mechanics. It is named after Erwin Schrödinger, an Austrian physicist, who postulated the equation in 1925 and published it in 1926, forming the basis for the work that resulted in his Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933.\nConceptually, the Schrödinger equation is the quantum counterpart of Newton's second law in classical mechanics. Given a set of known initial conditions, Newton's second law makes a mathematical prediction as to what path a given physical system will take over time. The Schrödinger equation gives the evolution over time of the wave function, the quantum-mechanical characterization of an isolated  physical system. The equation was postulated by Schrödinger based on a postulate of Louis de Broglie that all matter has an associated matter wave. The equation predicted bound states of the atom in agreement with experimental observations.\nThe Schrödinger equation is not the only way to study quantum mechanical systems and make predictions. Other formulations of quantum mechanics include matrix mechanics, introduced by Werner Heisenberg, and the path integral formulation, developed chiefly by Richard Feynman. When these approaches are compared, the use of the Schrödinger equation is sometimes called \"wave mechanics\".\nThe equation given by Schrödinger is nonrelativistic because it contains a first derivative in time and a second derivative in space, and therefore space and time are not on equal footing. Paul Dirac incorporated special relativity and quantum mechanics into a single formulation that simplifies to the Schrödinger equation in the non-relativistic limit. This is the Dirac equation, which contains a single derivative in both space and time. Another partial differential equation, the Klein–Gordon equation, led to a problem with probability density even though it was a relativistic wave equation. The probability density could be negative, which is physically unviable. This was fixed by Dirac by taking the so-called square root of the Klein–Gordon operator and in turn introducing Dirac matrices. In a modern context, the Klein–Gordon equation describes spin-less particles, while the Dirac equation describes spin-1/2 particles.\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\nPreliminaries\nIntroductory courses on physics or chemistry typically introduce the Schrödinger equation in a way that can be appreciated knowing only the concepts and notations of basic calculus, particularly derivatives with respect to space and time. A special case of the Schrödinger equation that admits a statement in those terms is the position-space Schrödinger equation for a single nonrelativistic particle in one dimension:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        ℏ\n        \n          \n            ∂\n            \n              ∂\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        Ψ\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        t\n        )\n        =\n        \n          [\n          \n            −\n            \n              \n                \n                  ℏ\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \n                  2\n                  m\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  ∂\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \n                  ∂\n                  \n                    x\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            +\n            V\n            (\n            x\n            ,\n            t\n            )\n          \n          ]\n        \n        Ψ\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        t\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i\\hbar {\\frac {\\partial }{\\partial t}}\\Psi (x,t)=\\left[-{\\frac {\\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}{\\frac {\\partial ^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}}+V(x,t)\\right]\\Psi (x,t).}\n  \n\nHere, \n  \n    \n      \n        Ψ\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Psi (x,t)}\n  \n is a wave function, a function that assigns a complex number to each point \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n at each time \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t}\n  \n.

This vector is postulated to be normalized under the Hilbert space's inner product, that is, in Dirac notation it obeys \n  \n    \n      \n        ⟨\n        ψ\n        \n          |\n        \n        ψ\n        ⟩\n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\langle \\psi |\\psi \\rangle =1}\n  \n. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system – for example, for describing position and momentum the Hilbert space is the space of square-integrable functions \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          L\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L^{2}}\n  \n, while the Hilbert space for the spin of a single proton is the two-dimensional complex vector space \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            C\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{2}}\n  \n with the usual inner product.\nPhysical quantities of interest – position, momentum, energy, spin – are represented by observables, which are self-adjoint operators acting on the Hilbert space. A wave function can be an eigenvector of an observable, in which case it is called an eigenstate, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. More generally, a quantum state will be a linear combination of the eigenstates, known as a quantum superposition. When an observable is measured, the result will be one of its eigenvalues with probability given by the Born rule: in the simplest case the eigenvalue \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n  \n is non-degenerate and the probability is given by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        ⟨\n        λ\n        \n          |\n        \n        ψ\n        ⟩\n        \n          \n            |\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |\\langle \\lambda |\\psi \\rangle |^{2}}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        λ\n        ⟩\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |\\lambda \\rangle }\n  \n is its associated eigenvector. More generally, the eigenvalue is degenerate and the probability is given by \n  \n    \n      \n        ⟨\n        ψ\n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          P\n          \n            λ\n          \n        \n        \n          |\n        \n        ψ\n        ⟩\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\langle \\psi |P_{\\lambda }|\\psi \\rangle }\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            λ\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{\\lambda }}\n  \n is the projector onto its associated eigenspace.\nA momentum eigenstate would be a perfectly monochromatic wave of infinite extent, which is not square-integrable. Likewise a position eigenstate would be a Dirac delta distribution, not square-integrable and technically not a function at all. Consequently, neither can belong to the particle's Hilbert space. Physicists sometimes regard these eigenstates, composed of elements outside the Hilbert space, as \"generalized eigenvectors\". These are used for calculational convenience and do not represent physical states. Thus, a position-space wave function \n  \n    \n      \n        Ψ\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Psi (x,t)}\n  \n as used above can be written as the inner product of a time-dependent state vector \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        Ψ\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        ⟩\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |\\Psi (t)\\rangle }\n  \n with unphysical but convenient \"position eigenstates\" \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        x\n        ⟩\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |x\\rangle }\n  \n:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Ψ\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        t\n        )\n        =\n        ⟨\n        x\n        \n          |\n        \n        Ψ\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        ⟩\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Psi (x,t)=\\langle x|\\Psi (t)\\rangle .}\n  \n\n\nTime-dependent equation\n\nThe form of the Schrödinger equation depends on the physical situation. The most general form is the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, which gives a description of a system evolving with time:\n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t}\n  \n is time, \n  \n    \n      \n        |\n        Ψ\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        ⟩\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\vert \\Psi (t)\\rangle }\n  \n is the state vector of the quantum system (\n  \n    \n      \n        Ψ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Psi }\n  \n being the Greek letter psi), and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              H\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {H}}}\n  \n is an observable, the Hamiltonian operator.\nThe term \"Schrödinger equation\" can refer to both the general equation, or the specific nonrelativistic version. The general equation is indeed quite general, used throughout quantum mechanics, for everything from the Dirac equation to quantum field theory, by plugging in diverse expressions for the Hamiltonian. The specific nonrelativistic version is an approximation that yields accurate results in many situations, but only to a certain extent (see relativistic quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory).\nTo apply the Schrödinger equation, write down the Hamiltonian for the system, accounting for the kinetic and potential energies of the particles constituting the system, then insert it into the Schrödinger equation. The resulting partial differential equation is solved for the wave function, which contains information about the system. In practice, the square of the absolute value of the wave function at each point is taken to define a probability density function. For example, given a wave function in position space \n  \n    \n      \n        Ψ\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Psi (x,t)}\n  \n as above, we have\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Pr\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        t\n        )\n        =\n        \n          |\n        \n        Ψ\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        t\n        )\n        \n          \n            |\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Pr(x,t)=|\\Psi (x,t)|^{2}.}\n  \n\n\nTime-independent equation\nThe time-dependent Schrödinger equation described above predicts that wave functions can form standing waves, called stationary states. These states are particularly important as their individual study later simplifies the task of solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for any state. Stationary states can also be described by a simpler form of the Schrödinger equation, the time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n is the energy of the system. This is only used when the Hamiltonian itself is not dependent on time explicitly. However, even in this case the total wave function is dependent on time as explained in the section on linearity below. In the language of linear algebra, this equation is an eigenvalue equation. Therefore, the wave function is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian operator with corresponding eigenvalue(s) \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n.\n\n\nProperties\n\n\nLinearity\nThe Schrödinger equation is a linear differential equation, meaning that if two state vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          ψ\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ⟩\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |\\psi _{1}\\rangle }\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          ψ\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⟩\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |\\psi _{2}\\rangle }\n  \n are solutions, then so is any linear combination\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        ψ\n        ⟩\n        =\n        a\n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          ψ\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ⟩\n        +\n        b\n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          ψ\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⟩\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |\\psi \\rangle =a|\\psi _{1}\\rangle +b|\\psi _{2}\\rangle }\n  \n\nof the two state vectors where a and b are any complex numbers. Moreover, the sum can be extended for any number of state vectors. This property allows superpositions of quantum states to be solutions of the Schrödinger equation. Even more generally, it holds that a general solution to the Schrödinger equation can be found by taking a weighted sum over a basis of states. A choice often employed is the basis of energy eigenstates, which are solutions of the time-independent Schrödinger equation.

As mentioned above, \"bases\" that lie outside the physical Hilbert space are also employed for calculational purposes. This is illustrated by the position-space and momentum-space Schrödinger equations for a nonrelativistic, spinless particle. The Hilbert space for such a particle is the space of complex square-integrable functions on three-dimensional Euclidean space, and its Hamiltonian is the sum of a kinetic-energy term that is quadratic in the momentum operator and a potential-energy term:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        ℏ\n        \n          \n            d\n            \n              d\n              t\n

This makes it convenient to solve the momentum-space Schrödinger equation at each point in the Brillouin zone independently of the other points in the Brillouin zone.\n\n\nProbability current\n\nThe Schrödinger equation is consistent with local probability conservation. It also ensures that a normalized wavefunction remains normalized after time evolution. In matrix mechanics, this means that the time evolution operator is a unitary operator. In contrast to, for example, the Klein Gordon equation, although a redefined inner product of a wavefunction can be time independent, the total volume integral of modulus square of the wavefunction need not be time independent.\nThe continuity equation for probability in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is stated as: \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            ∂\n            \n              ∂\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        ρ\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              r\n            \n            ,\n            t\n          \n          )\n        \n        +\n        ∇\n        ⋅\n        \n          j\n        \n        =\n        0\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial }{\\partial t}}\\rho \\left(\\mathbf {r} ,t\\right)+\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf {j} =0,}\n  \nwhere\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          j\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              2\n              m\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              Ψ\n              \n                ∗\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    p\n                  \n                  ^\n                \n              \n            \n            Ψ\n            −\n            Ψ\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    p\n                  \n                  ^\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Ψ\n              \n                ∗\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        =\n        −\n        \n          \n            \n              i\n              ℏ\n            \n            \n              2\n              m\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          ψ\n          \n            ∗\n          \n        \n        ∇\n        ψ\n        −\n        ψ\n        ∇\n        \n          ψ\n          \n            ∗\n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            ℏ\n            m\n          \n        \n        Im\n        ⁡\n        (\n        \n          ψ\n          \n            ∗\n          \n        \n        ∇\n        ψ\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {j} ={\\frac {1}{2m}}\\left(\\Psi ^{*}{\\hat {\\mathbf {p} }}\\Psi -\\Psi {\\hat {\\mathbf {p} }}\\Psi ^{*}\\right)=-{\\frac {i\\hbar }{2m}}(\\psi ^{*}\\nabla \\psi -\\psi \\nabla \\psi ^{*})={\\frac {\\hbar }{m}}\\operatorname {Im} (\\psi ^{*}\\nabla \\psi )}\n  \n\nis the probability current or probability flux (flow per unit area).\nIf the wavefunction is represented as ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ψ\n          (\n          \n            \n              x\n            \n          \n          ,\n          t\n          )\n          =\n          \n            \n              ρ\n              (\n              \n                \n                  x\n                \n              \n              ,\n              t\n              )\n            \n          \n          exp\n          ⁡\n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                \n                  i\n                  ℏ\n                \n              \n              S\n              (\n              \n                \n                  x\n                \n              \n              ,\n              t\n              )\n            \n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\textstyle \\psi ({\\bf {x}},t)={\\sqrt {\\rho ({\\bf {x}},t)}}\\exp \\left({\\frac {i}{\\hbar }}S({\\bf {x}},t)\\right)}\n  \n⁠, where \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n        (\n        \n          x\n        \n        ,\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S(\\mathbf {x} ,t)}\n  \n is a real function that represents the complex phase of the wavefunction, then the probability flux is calculated as:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          j\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              ρ\n              ∇\n              S\n            \n            m\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {j} ={\\frac {\\rho \\nabla S}{m}}.}\n  \n Hence, the spatial variation of the phase of a wavefunction is said to characterize the probability flux of the wavefunction.

In physics, these standing waves are called \"stationary states\" or \"energy eigenstates\"; in chemistry they are called \"atomic orbitals\" or \"molecular orbitals\". Superpositions of energy eigenstates change their properties according to the relative phases between the energy levels. The energy eigenstates form a basis: any wave function may be written as a sum over the discrete energy states or an integral over continuous energy states, or more generally as an integral over a measure. This is an example of the spectral theorem, and in a finite-dimensional state space it is just a statement of the completeness of the eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix.\nSeparation of variables can also be a useful method for the time-independent Schrödinger equation.

The finite potential well problem is mathematically more complicated than the infinite particle-in-a-box problem as the wave function is not pinned to zero at the walls of the well. Instead, the wave function must satisfy more complicated mathematical boundary conditions as it is nonzero in regions outside the well. Another related problem is that of the rectangular potential barrier, which furnishes a model for the quantum tunneling effect that plays an important role in the performance of modern technologies such as flash memory and scanning tunneling microscopy.\n\n\nHarmonic oscillator\n\nThe Schrödinger equation for this situation is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        ψ\n        =\n        −\n        \n          \n            \n              ℏ\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              2\n              m\n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        x\n                        \n                          2\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              d\n              \n                x\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        ψ\n        +\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              2\n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        x\n                        \n                          2\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        m\n        \n          ω\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ψ\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E\\psi =-{\\frac {\\hbar ^{2}}{2m{\\vphantom {x^{2}}}}}{\\frac {d^{2}}{dx^{2}}}\\psi +{\\frac {1}{2{\\vphantom {x^{2}}}}}m\\omega ^{2}x^{2}\\psi ,}\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n is the displacement and \n  \n    \n      \n        ω\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\omega }\n  \n the angular frequency.

The negative sign arises in the potential term since the proton and electron are oppositely charged. The reduced mass in place of the electron mass is used since the electron and proton together orbit each other about a common center of mass, and constitute a two-body problem to solve. The motion of the electron is of principal interest here, so the equivalent one-body problem is the motion of the electron using the reduced mass.\nThe Schrödinger equation for a hydrogen atom can be solved by separation of variables.

When the preparation of a system is only imperfectly known, or when the system under investigation is a part of a larger whole, density matrices may be used instead. A density matrix is a positive semi-definite operator whose trace is equal to 1. (The term \"density operator\" is also used, particularly when the underlying Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional.) The set of all density matrices is convex, and the extreme points are the operators that project onto vectors in the Hilbert space.

For one reason, it is essentially invariant under Galilean transformations, which form the symmetry group of Newtonian dynamics. Moreover, processes that change particle number are natural in relativity, and so an equation for one particle (or any fixed number thereof) can only be of limited use. A more general form of the Schrödinger equation that also applies in relativistic situations can be formulated within quantum field theory (QFT), a framework that allows the combination of quantum mechanics with special relativity. The region in which both simultaneously apply may be described by relativistic quantum mechanics.

Historically, Dirac obtained the Dirac equation by seeking a differential equation that would be first-order in both time and space, a desirable property for a relativistic theory. Taking the \"square root\" of the left-hand side of the Klein–Gordon equation in this way required factorizing it into a product of two operators, which Dirac wrote using 4 × 4 matrices \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          α\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          α\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          α\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        β\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha _{1},\\alpha _{2},\\alpha _{3},\\beta }\n  \n.

Including influences upon the particle requires modifying the Hamiltonian operator.

The Dirac equation is true for all spin-1⁄2 particles, and the solutions to the equation are 4-component spinor fields with two components corresponding to the particle and the other two for the antiparticle.\nFor the Klein–Gordon equation, the general form of the Schrödinger equation is inconvenient to use, and in practice the Hamiltonian is not expressed in an analogous way to the Dirac Hamiltonian. The equations for relativistic quantum fields, of which the Klein–Gordon and Dirac equations are two examples, can be obtained in other ways, such as starting from a Lagrangian density and using the Euler–Lagrange equations for fields, or using the representation theory of the Lorentz group in which certain representations can be used to fix the equation for a free particle of given spin (and mass).\nIn general, the Hamiltonian to be substituted in the general Schrödinger equation is not just a function of the position and momentum operators (and possibly time), but also of spin matrices. Also, the solutions to a relativistic wave equation, for a massive particle of spin s, are complex-valued 2(2s + 1)-component spinor fields.\n\n\nFock space\nAs originally formulated, the Dirac equation is an equation for a single quantum particle, just like the single-particle Schrödinger equation with wave function \n  \n    \n      \n        Ψ\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Psi (x,t)}\n  \n. This is of limited use in relativistic quantum mechanics, where particle number is not fixed. Heuristically, this complication can be motivated by noting that mass–energy equivalence implies material particles can be created from energy. A common way to address this in QFT is to introduce a Hilbert space where the basis states are labeled by particle number, a so-called Fock space. The Schrödinger equation can then be formulated for quantum states on this Hilbert space. However, because the Schrödinger equation picks out a preferred time axis, the Lorentz invariance of the theory is no longer manifest, and accordingly, the theory is often formulated in other ways.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFollowing Max Planck's quantization of light (see black-body radiation), Albert Einstein interpreted Planck's quanta to be photons, particles of light, and proposed that the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency, one of the first signs of wave–particle duality. Since energy and momentum are related in the same way as frequency and wave number in special relativity, it followed that the momentum \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n  \n of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n  \n, or proportional to its wave number \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n  \n:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        =\n        \n          \n            h\n            λ\n          \n        \n        =\n        ℏ\n        k\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p={\\frac {h}{\\lambda }}=\\hbar k,}\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n  \n is the Planck constant and \n  \n    \n      \n        ℏ\n        =\n        \n          h\n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        \n          2\n          π\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\hbar ={h}/{2\\pi }}\n  \n is the reduced Planck constant. Louis de Broglie hypothesized that this is true for all particles, even particles which have mass such as electrons. He showed that, assuming that the matter waves propagate along with their particle counterparts, electrons form standing waves, meaning that only certain discrete rotational frequencies about the nucleus of an atom are allowed.\nThese quantized orbits correspond to discrete energy levels, and de Broglie reproduced the Bohr model formula for the energy levels. The Bohr model was based on the assumed quantization of angular momentum \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n according to\n\n  \n    \n      \n        L\n        =\n        n\n        \n          \n            h\n            \n              2\n              π\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        n\n        ℏ\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L=n{\\frac {h}{2\\pi }}=n\\hbar .}\n  \n\nAccording to de Broglie, the electron is described by a wave, and a whole number of wavelengths must fit along the circumference of the electron's orbit:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        λ\n        =\n        2\n        π\n        r\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n\\lambda =2\\pi r.}\n  \n\nThis approach essentially confined the electron wave in one dimension, along a circular orbit of radius \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n  \n.\nIn 1921, prior to de Broglie, Arthur C. Lunn at the University of Chicago had used the same argument based on the completion of the relativistic energy–momentum 4-vector to derive what we now call the de Broglie relation.\nFollowing up on de Broglie's ideas, physicist Peter Debye made an offhand comment that if particles behaved as waves, they should satisfy some sort of wave equation. Inspired by Debye's remark, Schrödinger decided to find a proper 3-dimensional wave equation for the electron. He was guided by William Rowan Hamilton's analogy between mechanics and optics, encoded in the observation that the zero-wavelength limit of optics resembles a mechanical system—the trajectories of light rays become sharp tracks that obey Fermat's principle, an analog of the principle of least action.\n\nThe equation he found is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        ℏ\n        \n          \n            ∂\n            \n              ∂\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        Ψ\n        (\n        \n          r\n        \n        ,\n        t\n        )\n        =\n        −\n        \n          \n            \n              ℏ\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              2\n              m\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          ∇\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        Ψ\n        (\n        \n          r\n        \n        ,\n        t\n        )\n        +\n        V\n        (\n        \n          r\n        \n        )\n        Ψ\n        (\n        \n          r\n        \n        ,\n        t\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i\\hbar {\\frac {\\partial }{\\partial t}}\\Psi (\\mathbf {r} ,t)=-{\\frac {\\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}\\nabla ^{2}\\Psi (\\mathbf {r} ,t)+V(\\mathbf {r} )\\Psi (\\mathbf {r} ,t).}\n  \n\nBy that time Arnold Sommerfeld had refined the Bohr model with relativistic corrections.

Discouraged, he put away his calculations and secluded himself with a mistress in a mountain cabin in December 1925.\nWhile at the cabin, Schrödinger decided that his earlier nonrelativistic calculations were novel enough to publish and decided to leave off the problem of relativistic corrections for the future. Despite the difficulties in solving the differential equation for hydrogen (he had sought help from his friend the mathematician Hermann Weyl) Schrödinger showed that his nonrelativistic version of the wave equation produced the correct spectral energies of hydrogen in a paper published in 1926. Schrödinger computed the hydrogen spectral series by treating a hydrogen atom's electron as a wave \n  \n    \n      \n        Ψ\n        (\n        \n          x\n        \n        ,\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Psi (\\mathbf {x} ,t)}\n  \n, moving in a potential well \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n  \n, created by the proton. This computation accurately reproduced the energy levels of the Bohr model.\nThe Schrödinger equation details the behavior of \n  \n    \n      \n        Ψ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Psi }\n  \n but says nothing of its nature. Schrödinger tried to interpret the real part of \n  \n    \n      \n        Ψ\n        \n          \n            \n              ∂\n              \n                Ψ\n                \n                  ∗\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              ∂\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Psi {\\frac {\\partial \\Psi ^{*}}{\\partial t}}}\n  \n as a charge density, and then revised this proposal, saying in his next paper that the modulus squared of \n  \n    \n      \n        Ψ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Psi }\n  \n is a charge density. This approach was, however, unsuccessful. In 1926, just a few days after this paper was published, Max Born successfully interpreted \n  \n    \n      \n        Ψ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Psi }\n  \n as the probability amplitude, whose modulus squared is equal to probability density. Later, Schrödinger himself explained this interpretation as follows:\n\nThe already ... mentioned psi-function.... is now the means for predicting probability of measurement results. In it is embodied the momentarily attained sum of theoretically based future expectation, somewhat as laid down in a catalog.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe Schrödinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time. However, the Schrödinger equation does not directly say what, exactly, the wave function is. The meaning of the Schrödinger equation and how the mathematical entities in it relate to physical reality depends upon the interpretation of quantum mechanics that one adopts.\nIn the views often grouped together as the Copenhagen interpretation, a system's wave function is a collection of statistical information about that system. The Schrödinger equation relates information about the system at one time to information about it at another. While the time-evolution process represented by the Schrödinger equation is continuous and deterministic, in that knowing the wave function at one instant is in principle sufficient to calculate it for all future times, wave functions can also change discontinuously and stochastically during a measurement. The wave function changes, according to this school of thought, because new information is available. The post-measurement wave function generally cannot be known prior to the measurement, but the probabilities for the different possibilities can be calculated using the Born rule. Other, more recent interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as relational quantum mechanics and QBism, also give the Schrödinger equation a status of this sort.\nSchrödinger himself suggested in 1952 that the different terms of a superposition evolving under the Schrödinger equation are \"not alternatives but all really happen simultaneously\". This has been interpreted as an early version of Everett's many-worlds interpretation. This interpretation, formulated independently in 1956, holds that all the possibilities described by quantum theory simultaneously occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes. This interpretation removes the axiom of wave function collapse, leaving only continuous evolution under the Schrödinger equation, and so all possible states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus, together with the observer, are present in a real physical quantum superposition. While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we do not observe the multiverse as a whole, but only one parallel universe at a time. Exactly how this is supposed to work has been the subject of much debate. Why should we assign probabilities at all to outcomes that are certain to occur in some worlds, and why should the probabilities be given by the Born rule? Several ways to answer these questions in the many-worlds framework have been proposed, but there is no consensus on whether they are successful.\nBohmian mechanics reformulates quantum mechanics to make it deterministic, at the price of adding a force due to a \"quantum potential\". It attributes to each physical system not only a wave function but in addition a real position that evolves deterministically under a nonlocal guiding equation. The evolution of a physical system is given at all times by the Schrödinger equation together with the guiding equation.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Schrödinger equation\".
