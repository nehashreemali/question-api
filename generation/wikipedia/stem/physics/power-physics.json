Power is a scalar quantity.\nThe output power of a motor is the product of the torque that the motor generates and the angular velocity of its output shaft.  Likewise, the power dissipated in an electrical element of a circuit is the product of the current flowing through the element and of the voltage across the element.\n\n\nDefinition\nPower is the rate with respect to time at which work is done or, more generally, the rate of change of total mechanical energy.

In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of power is the watt (W), which is equal to one joule per second. Other common and traditional measures are horsepower (hp), comparing to the power of a horse; one mechanical horsepower equals about 745.7 watts. Other units of power include ergs per second (erg/s), foot-pounds per minute, dBm, a logarithmic measure relative to a reference of 1 milliwatt, calories per hour, BTU per hour (BTU/h), and tons of refrigeration.\n\n\nAverage power and instantaneous power\nAs a simple example, burning one kilogram of coal releases more energy than detonating a kilogram of TNT, but because the TNT reaction releases energy more quickly, it delivers more power than the coal.\nIf ΔW  is the amount of work performed during a period of time of duration Δt, the average power Pavg over that period is given by the formula\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            \n              a\n              v\n              g\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              Δ\n              W\n            \n            \n              Δ\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{\\mathrm {avg} }={\\frac {\\Delta W}{\\Delta t}}.}\n  \n\nIt is the average amount of work done or energy converted per unit of time.
