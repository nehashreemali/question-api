It is a fundamental concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of physical objects. Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning that both magnitude and direction are needed to define it (velocity vector). The scalar absolute value (magnitude) of velocity is called speed, a quantity that is measured in metres per second (m/s or m⋅s−1) in the SI (metric) system. For example, \"5 metres per second\" is a scalar, whereas \"5 metres per second east\" is a vector. If there is a change in speed, direction or both, then the object is said to be undergoing an acceleration.\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\nAverage velocity\nThe average velocity of an object over a period of time is its change in position, \n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        s\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta s}\n  \n, divided by the duration of the period, \n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta t}\n  \n, given mathematically as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              v\n              ¯\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              Δ\n              s\n            \n            \n              Δ\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\bar {v}}={\\frac {\\Delta s}{\\Delta t}}.}\n  \n\n\nInstantaneous velocity\n\nThe instantaneous velocity of an object is the limit average velocity as the time interval approaches zero. At any particular time t, it can be calculated as the derivative of the position with respect to time:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          v\n        \n        =\n        \n          lim\n          \n            \n              Δ\n              t\n            \n            →\n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Δ\n              \n                s\n              \n            \n            \n              Δ\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              \n                s\n              \n            \n            \n              d\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {v}}=\\lim _{{\\Delta t}\\to 0}{\\frac {\\Delta {\\boldsymbol {s}}}{\\Delta t}}={\\frac {d{\\boldsymbol {s}}}{dt}}.}\n  \n\nFrom this derivative equation, in the one-dimensional case it can be seen that the area under a velocity vs. time (v vs. t graph) is the displacement, s. In calculus terms, the integral of the velocity function v(t) is the displacement function s(t). In the figure, this corresponds to the yellow area under the curve.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          s\n        \n        =\n        ∫\n        \n          v\n        \n         \n        d\n        t\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {s}}=\\int {\\boldsymbol {v}}\\ dt.}\n  \n\nAlthough the concept of an instantaneous velocity might at first seem counter-intuitive, it may be thought of as the velocity that the object would continue to travel at if it stopped accelerating at that moment.\n\n\nDifference between speed and velocity\n\nWhile the terms speed and velocity are often colloquially used interchangeably to connote how fast an object is moving, in scientific terms they are different. Speed, the scalar magnitude of a velocity vector, denotes only how fast an object is moving, while velocity indicates both an object's speed and direction.\nTo have a constant velocity, an object must have a constant speed in a constant direction. Constant direction constrains the object to motion in a straight path thus, a constant velocity means motion in a straight line at a constant speed.\nFor example, a car moving at a constant 20 kilometres per hour in a circular path has a constant speed, but does not have a constant velocity because its direction changes. Hence, the car is considered to be undergoing an acceleration.\n\n\nUnits\nSince the derivative of the position with respect to time gives the change in position (in metres) divided by the change in time (in seconds), velocity is measured in metres per second (m/s).\n\n\nEquation of motion\n\n\nAverage velocity\nVelocity is defined as the rate of change of position with respect to time, which may also be referred to as the instantaneous velocity to emphasize the distinction from the average velocity. In some applications the average velocity of an object might be needed, that is to say, the constant velocity that would provide the same resultant displacement as a variable velocity in the same time interval, v(t), over some time period Δt. Average velocity can be calculated as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              v\n              ¯\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              Δ\n              \n                x\n              \n            \n            \n              Δ\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                ∫\n                \n                  \n                    t\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    t\n                    \n                      1\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                v\n              \n              (\n              t\n              )\n              \n              d\n              t\n            \n            \n              \n                t\n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n              −\n              \n                t\n                \n                  0\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {\\bar {v}} ={\\frac {\\Delta \\mathbf {x} }{\\Delta t}}={\\frac {\\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\\mathbf {v} (t)\\,dt}{t_{1}-t_{0}}}.}\n  \n\nThe average velocity is always less than or equal to the average speed of an object. This can be seen by realizing that while distance is always strictly increasing, displacement can increase or decrease in magnitude as well as change direction.\nIn terms of a displacement-time (x vs. t) graph, the instantaneous velocity (or, simply, velocity) can be thought of as the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point, and the average velocity as the slope of the secant line between two points with t coordinates equal to the boundaries of the time period for the average velocity.\n\n\nSpecial cases\nWhen a particle moves with different uniform speeds v1, v2, v3, ..., vn

acceleration. As seen by the three green tangent lines in the figure, an object's instantaneous acceleration at a point in time is the slope of the line tangent to the curve of a v(t) graph at that point. In other words, instantaneous acceleration is defined as the derivative of velocity with respect to time:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              \n                v\n              \n            \n            \n              d\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {a}}={\\frac {d{\\boldsymbol {v}}}{dt}}.}\n  \n\nFrom there, velocity is expressed as the area under an a(t) acceleration vs. time graph. As above, this is done using the concept of the integral:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          v\n        \n        =\n        ∫\n        \n          a\n        \n         \n        d\n        t\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {v}}=\\int {\\boldsymbol {a}}\\ dt.}\n  \n\n\nConstant acceleration\nIn the special case of constant acceleration, velocity can be studied using the suvat equations. By considering a as being equal to some arbitrary constant vector, this shows\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          v\n        \n        =\n        \n          u\n        \n        +\n        \n          a\n        \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {v}}={\\boldsymbol {u}}+{\\boldsymbol {a}}t}\n  \n\nwith v as the velocity at time t and u as the velocity at time t = 0. By combining this equation with the suvat equation x = ut + at2/2, it is possible to relate the displacement and the average velocity by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              (\n              \n                u\n              \n              +\n              \n                v\n              \n              )\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        t\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              v\n              ¯\n            \n          \n        \n        t\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {x}}={\\frac {({\\boldsymbol {u}}+{\\boldsymbol {v}})}{2}}t={\\boldsymbol {\\bar {v}}}t.}\n  \n\nIt is also possible to derive an expression for the velocity independent of time, known as the Torricelli equation, as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  v\n                  \n

Where Newtonian mechanics and special relativity differ is in how different observers would describe the same situation. In particular, in Newtonian mechanics, all observers agree on the value of t and the transformation rules for position create a situation in which all non-accelerating observers would describe the acceleration of an object with the same values. Neither is true for special relativity. In other words, only relative velocity can be calculated.\n\n\nQuantities that are dependent on velocity\n\n\nMomentum\nIn classical mechanics, Newton's second law defines momentum, p, as a vector that is the product of an object's mass and velocity, given mathematically as\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n        \n        =\n        m\n        \n          v\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {p}}=m{\\boldsymbol {v}}}\n  \nwhere m is the mass of the object.\n\n\nKinetic energy\nThe kinetic energy of a moving object is dependent on its velocity and is given by the equation\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        m\n        \n          v\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E_{\\text{k}}={\\tfrac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}\n  \nwhere Ek is the kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity as it depends on the square of the velocity.\n\n\nDrag (fluid resistance)\nIn fluid dynamics, drag is a force acting opposite to the relative motion of any object moving with respect to a surrounding fluid.

It represents the kinetic energy that, when added to the object's gravitational potential energy (which is always negative), is equal to zero. The general formula for the escape velocity of an object at a distance r from the center of a planet with mass M is\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          v\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                2\n                G\n                M\n              \n              r\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            2\n            g\n            r\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v_{\\text{e}}={\\sqrt {\\frac {2GM}{r}}}={\\sqrt {2gr}},}\n  \nwhere G is the gravitational constant and g is the gravitational acceleration. The escape velocity from Earth's surface is about 11 200 m/s, and is irrespective of the direction of the object. This makes \"escape velocity\" somewhat of a misnomer, as the more correct term would be \"escape speed\": any object attaining a velocity of that magnitude, irrespective of atmosphere, will leave the vicinity of the base body as long as it does not intersect with something in its path.\n\n\nThe Lorentz factor of special relativity\nIn special relativity, the dimensionless Lorentz factor appears frequently, and is given by\n  \n    \n      \n        γ\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              1\n              −\n              \n                \n                  \n                    v\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    c\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma ={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {1-{\\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}}\n  \nwhere γ is the Lorentz factor and c is the speed of light.\n\n\nRelative velocity\n\nRelative velocity is a measurement of velocity between two objects as determined in a single coordinate system. Relative velocity is fundamental in both classical and modern physics, since many systems in physics deal with the relative motion of two or more particles.\nConsider an object A moving with velocity vector v and an object B with velocity vector w; these absolute velocities are typically expressed in the same inertial reference frame. Then, the velocity of object A relative to object B is defined as the difference of the two velocity vectors:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            v\n          \n          \n            A\n            \n               relative to \n            \n            B\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          v\n        \n        −\n        \n          w\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {v}}_{A{\\text{ relative to }}B}={\\boldsymbol {v}}-{\\boldsymbol {w}}}\n  \n\nSimilarly, the relative velocity of object B moving with velocity w, relative to object A moving with velocity v is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            v\n          \n          \n            B\n            \n               relative to \n            \n            A\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          w\n        \n        −\n        \n          v\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {v}}_{B{\\text{ relative to }}A}={\\boldsymbol {w}}-{\\boldsymbol {v}}}\n  \n\nUsually, the inertial frame chosen is that in which the latter of the two mentioned objects is in rest.\nIn Newtonian mechanics, the relative velocity is independent of the chosen inertial reference frame.

Both arise from angular velocity, which is the rate of rotation about the origin (with positive quantities representing counter-clockwise rotation and negative quantities representing clockwise rotation, in a right-handed coordinate system).\nThe radial and traverse velocities can be derived from the Cartesian velocity and displacement vectors by decomposing the velocity vector into radial and transverse components.
