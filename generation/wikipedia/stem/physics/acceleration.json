Accelerations are vector quantities (in that they have magnitude and direction). The orientation of an object's acceleration is given by the orientation of the net force acting on that object. The magnitude of an object's acceleration, as described by Newton's second law, is the combined effect of two causes:\n\nthe net balance of all external forces acting onto that object — magnitude is directly proportional to this net resulting force;\nthat object's mass, depending on the materials out of which it is made — magnitude is inversely proportional to the object's mass.\nThe SI unit for acceleration is metre per second squared (m⋅s−2, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              m\n              \n                s\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {\\tfrac {m}{s^{2}}} }\n  \n).\nFor example, when a vehicle starts from a standstill (zero velocity, in an inertial frame of reference) and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds, it is accelerating in the direction of travel. If the vehicle turns, an acceleration occurs toward the new direction and changes its motion vector. The acceleration of the vehicle in its current direction of motion is called a linear acceleration (or tangential acceleration during circular motions), the reaction to which the passengers on board experience as a force pushing them back into their seats. When changing direction, the effecting acceleration is called radial or normal acceleration (or centripetal acceleration during circular motions), the reaction to which the passengers experience as a centrifugal force. If the speed of the vehicle decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction of the velocity vector, sometimes called deceleration or retardation, and passengers experience the reaction to deceleration as an inertial force pushing them forward. Such deceleration is often achieved by retrorocket burning in spacecraft. Both acceleration and deceleration are treated the same, as they are both changes in velocity. Each of these accelerations (tangential, radial, deceleration) is felt by passengers until their relative (differential) velocity is neutralised in reference to the acceleration due to change in speed.\n\n\nDefinition and properties\n\n\nAverage acceleration\n\nAn object's average acceleration over a period of time is its change in velocity, \n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        \n          v\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta \\mathbf {v} }\n  \n, divided by the duration of the period, \n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta t}\n  \n.

The SI unit of acceleration is the metre per second squared (m s−2); or \"metre per second per second\", as the velocity in metres per second changes by the acceleration value, every second.\n\n\nOther forms\nAn object moving in a circular motion—such as a satellite orbiting the Earth—is accelerating due to the change of direction of motion, although its speed may be constant. In this case it is said to be undergoing centripetal (directed towards the center) acceleration.\n\nProper acceleration, the acceleration of a body relative to a free-fall condition, is measured by an instrument called an accelerometer. Newton's second law is normally applied in an inertial reference frame. In a reference frame accelerating with acceleration \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  \n (in one dimension), Newton's laws can still be used by introducing an inertial force (fictitious force) \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        =\n        −\n        m\n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F=-ma}\n  \n on a mass \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n  \n, opposite the acceleration of the frame. This accounts for the tendency of the mass to maintain its inertial motion—to stay \"as is,\" at rest or moving at constant velocity—while the frame accelerates. One example is that a person in an elevator feels heavier or lighter as the elevator accelerates or decelerates. If \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n  \n is known, measurement of the supporting force on the mass can be used to infer the acceleration; this is the principle of a mechanical accelerometer. In general relativity, gravity and inertial acceleration may be locally indistinguishable (see General relativity). \nIn classical mechanics, for a body with constant mass, the (vector) acceleration of the body's center of mass is proportional to the net force vector (i.e. sum of all forces) acting on it (Newton's second law):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n        \n        =\n        m\n        \n          a\n        \n        \n        \n        ⟹\n        \n        \n        \n          a\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              F\n            \n            m\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} =m\\mathbf {a} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\mathbf {a} ={\\frac {\\mathbf {F} }{m}},}\n  \n\nwhere F is the net force acting on the body, m is the mass of the body, and a is the center-of-mass acceleration.

As Galileo showed, the net result is parabolic motion, which describes, e.g., the trajectory of a projectile in vacuum near the surface of Earth.\n\n\nCircular motion\n\nIn uniform circular motion, that is moving with constant speed along a circular path, a particle experiences an acceleration resulting from the change of the direction of the velocity vector, while its magnitude remains constant. The derivative of the location of a point on a curve with respect to time, i.e. its velocity, turns out to be always exactly tangential to the curve, respectively orthogonal to the radius in this point. Since in uniform motion the velocity in the tangential direction does not change, the acceleration must be in radial direction, pointing to the center of the circle. This acceleration constantly changes the direction of the velocity to be tangent in the neighbouring point, thereby rotating the velocity vector along the circle.\n\nFor a given speed \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  \n, the magnitude of this geometrically caused acceleration (centripetal acceleration) is inversely proportional to the radius \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n  \n of the circle, and increases as the square of this speed: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            c\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              v\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            r\n          \n        \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a_{c}={\\frac {v^{2}}{r}}\\,.}\n  \n\nFor a given angular velocity \n  \n    \n      \n        ω\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\omega }\n  \n, the centripetal acceleration is directly proportional to radius \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n  \n.

Newtonian mechanics is exactly revealed to be an approximation to reality, valid to great accuracy at lower speeds. As the relevant speeds increase toward the speed of light, acceleration no longer follows classical equations.\nAs speeds approach that of light, the acceleration produced by a given force decreases, becoming infinitesimally small as light speed is approached; an object with mass can approach this speed asymptotically, but never reach it.\n\n\nGeneral relativity\n\nUnless the state of motion of an object is known, it is impossible to distinguish whether an observed force is due to gravity or to acceleration—gravity and inertial acceleration have identical effects. Albert Einstein called this the equivalence principle, and said that only observers who feel no force at all—including the force of gravity—are justified in concluding that they are not accelerating.\n\n\nConversions\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nAcceleration Calculator Simple acceleration unit converter",
