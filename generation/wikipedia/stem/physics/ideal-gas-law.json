  "extract": "The ideal gas law, also called the general gas equation, is the equation of state of a hypothetical ideal gas. It is a good approximation of the behavior of many gases under many conditions, although it has several limitations. It was first stated by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834 as a combination of the empirical Boyle's law, Charles's law, Avogadro's law, and Gay-Lussac's law. The ideal gas law is often written in an empirical form:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        V\n        =\n        n\n        R\n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle pV=nRT}\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T}\n  \n are the pressure, volume and temperature respectively; \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n is the amount of substance; and \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n  \n is the ideal gas constant.\nIt can also be derived from the microscopic kinetic theory, as was achieved (independently) by August Krönig in 1856 and Rudolf Clausius in 1857.\n\n\nFormulations\n\nThe state of an amount of gas is determined by its pressure, volume, and temperature. The modern form of the equation relates these simply in two main forms. The temperature used in the equation of state is an absolute temperature: the appropriate SI unit is the kelvin.\n\n\nCommon forms\nThe most frequently introduced forms are:\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        V\n        =\n        n\n        R\n        T\n        =\n        n\n        \n          k\n          \n            B\n          \n        \n        \n          N\n          \n            A\n          \n        \n        T\n        =\n        N\n        \n          k\n          \n            B\n          \n        \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle pV=nRT=nk_{\\text{B}}N_{\\text{A}}T=Nk_{\\text{B}}T}\n  \nwhere:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n  \n is the absolute pressure of the gas,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n  \n is the volume of the gas,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n is the amount of substance of gas (also known as number of moles),\n\n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n  \n is the ideal, or universal, gas constant, equal to the product of the Boltzmann constant and the Avogadro constant,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          k\n          \n            B\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k_{\\text{B}}}\n  \n is the Boltzmann constant,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          N\n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N_{A}}\n  \n is the Avogadro constant,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T}\n  \n is the absolute temperature of the gas,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n is the number of particles (usually atoms or molecules) of the gas.\nIn SI units, p is measured in pascals, V is measured in cubic meters, n is measured in moles, and T in kelvins (the Kelvin scale is a shifted Celsius scale, where 0 K = −273.15 °C, the lowest possible temperature). R has for value 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 1.989 ≈ 2 cal/(mol·K), or 0.0821 L⋅atm/(mol⋅K).\n\n\nMolar form\nHow much gas is present could be specified by giving the mass instead of the chemical amount of gas. Therefore, an alternative form of the ideal gas law may be useful. The chemical amount, n (in moles), is equal to total mass of the gas (m) (in kilograms) divided by the molar mass, M (in kilograms per mole):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        =\n        \n          \n            m\n            M\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n={\\frac {m}{M}}.}\n  \n\nBy replacing n with m/M and subsequently introducing density ρ = m/V, we get:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        V\n        =\n        \n          \n            m\n            M\n          \n        \n        R\n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle pV={\\frac {m}{M}}RT}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        =\n        \n          \n            m\n            V\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              R\n              T\n            \n            M\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p={\\frac {m}{V}}{\\frac {RT}{M}}}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        =\n        ρ\n        \n          \n            R\n            M\n          \n        \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p=\\rho {\\frac {R}{M}}T}\n  \n\nDefining the specific gas constant Rspecific as the ratio R/M,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        =\n        ρ\n        \n          R\n          \n            specific\n          \n        \n        T\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p=\\rho R_{\\text{specific}}T.}\n  \n\nThis form of the ideal gas law is very useful because it links pressure, density, and temperature in a unique formula independent of the quantity of the considered gas.  Alternatively, the law may be written in terms of the specific volume v, the reciprocal of density, as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        v\n        =\n        \n          R\n          \n            specific\n          \n        \n        T\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle pv=R_{\\text{specific}}T.}\n  \n\nIt is common, especially in engineering and meteorological applications, to represent the specific gas constant by the symbol R. In such cases, the universal gas constant is usually given a different symbol such as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              R\n              ¯\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\bar {R}}}\n  \n or \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n          \n            ∗\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R^{*}}\n  \n to distinguish it. In any case, the context and/or units of the gas constant should make it clear as to whether the universal or specific gas constant is being used.\n\n\nStatistical mechanics\nIn statistical mechanics, the following molecular equation (i.e. the ideal gas law in its theoretical form) is derived from first principles:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        =\n        n\n        \n          k\n          \n            B\n          \n        \n        T\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p=nk_{\\text{B}}T,}\n  \n\nwhere p is the absolute pressure of the gas, n is the number density of the molecules (given by the ratio n = N/V, in contrast to the previous formulation in which n is the number of moles), T is the absolute temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant relating temperature and energy, given by:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          k\n          \n            B\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            R\n            \n              N\n              \n                A\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k_{\\text{B}}={\\frac {R}{N_{\\text{A}}}}}\n  \n\nwhere NA is the Avogadro constant.\nThe form can be further simplified by defining the kinetic energy corresponding to the temperature:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        T\n        :=\n        \n          k\n          \n            B\n          \n        \n        T\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T:=k_{\\text{B}}T,}\n  \n\nso the ideal gas law is more simply expressed as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        =\n        n\n        \n        T\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p=n\\,T.}\n  \n\nFrom this we notice that for a gas of mass m, with an average particle mass of μ times the atomic mass constant, mu, (i.e., the mass is μ Da) the number of molecules will be given by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        =\n        \n          \n            m\n            \n              μ\n              \n                m\n                \n                  u\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N={\\frac {m}{\\mu m_{\\text{u}}}},}\n  \n\nand since ρ = m/V = nμmu, we find that the ideal gas law can be rewritten as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            V\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            m\n            \n              μ\n              \n                m\n                \n                  u\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          k\n          \n            B\n          \n        \n        T\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              k\n              \n                B\n              \n            \n            \n              μ\n              \n                m\n                \n                  u\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        ρ\n        T\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p={\\frac {1}{V}}{\\frac {m}{\\mu m_{\\text{u}}}}k_{\\text{B}}T={\\frac {k_{\\text{B}}}{\\mu m_{\\text{u}}}}\\rho T.}\n  \n\nIn SI units, p is measured in pascals, V in cubic metres, T in kelvins, and kB = 1.38×10−23 J⋅K−1 in SI units.\n\n\nCombined gas law\nCombining the laws of Charles, Boyle, and Gay-Lussac gives the combined gas law, which can take the same functional form as the ideal gas law.

In other words, its potential energy is zero. Hence, all the energy possessed by the gas is the kinetic energy of the molecules, or atoms, of the gas.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        =\n        \n          \n            3\n            2\n          \n        \n        n\n        R\n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E={\\frac {3}{2}}nRT}\n  \n\nThis corresponds to the kinetic energy of n moles of a monoatomic gas having 3 degrees of freedom: x, y, z. The table here below gives this relationship for different amounts of a monoatomic gas.\n\n\nApplications to thermodynamic processes\nThe table below essentially simplifies the ideal gas equation for a particular process, making the equation easier to solve using numerical methods.\nA thermodynamic process is defined as a system that moves from state 1 to state 2, where the state number is denoted by a subscript. As shown in the first column of the table, basic thermodynamic processes are defined such that one of the gas properties (P, V, T, S, or H) is constant throughout the process.\nFor a given thermodynamic process, in order to specify the extent of a particular process, one of the properties ratios (which are listed under the column labeled \"known ratio\") must be specified (either directly or indirectly). Also, the property for which the ratio is known must be distinct from the property held constant in the previous column (otherwise the ratio would be unity, and not enough information would be available to simplify the gas law equation).\nIn the final three columns, the properties (p, V, or T) at state 2 can be calculated from the properties at state 1 using the equations listed.\n\n^  a. In an isentropic process, system entropy (S) is constant. Under these conditions, p1V1γ = p2V2γ, where γ is defined as the heat capacity ratio, which is constant for a calorifically perfect gas. The value used for γ is typically 1.4 for diatomic gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), (and air, which is 99% diatomic). Also γ is typically 1.6 for mono atomic gases like the noble gases helium (He), and argon (Ar). In internal combustion engines γ varies between 1.35 and 1.15, depending on constitution gases and temperature.\n^  b. In an isenthalpic process, system enthalpy (H) is constant. In the case of free expansion for an ideal gas, there are no molecular interactions, and the temperature remains constant.  For real gases, the molecules do interact via attraction or repulsion depending on temperature and pressure, and heating or cooling does occur.  This is known as the Joule–Thomson effect.  For reference, the Joule–Thomson coefficient μJT for air at room temperature and sea level is 0.22 °C/bar.\n\n\nDeviations from ideal behavior of real gases\nThe equation of state given here (PV = nRT) applies only to an ideal gas, or as an approximation to a real gas that behaves sufficiently like an ideal gas. There are in fact many different forms of the equation of state. Since the ideal gas law neglects both molecular size and intermolecular attractions, it is most accurate for monatomic gases at high temperatures and low pressures. The molecular size becomes less important for lower densities, i.e. for larger volumes at lower pressures, because the average distance between adjacent molecules becomes much larger than the molecular size. The relative importance of intermolecular attractions diminishes with increasing thermal kinetic energy, i.e., with increasing temperatures. More detailed equations of state, such as the van der Waals equation, account for deviations from ideality caused by molecular size and intermolecular forces.\n\n\nDerivations\n\n\nEmpirical\nThe

{\\displaystyle C_{1},C_{2},C_{3},C_{4},C_{5},C_{6}}\n  \n are constants in this context because of each equation requiring only the parameters explicitly noted in them changing.\nTo derive the ideal gas law one does not need to know all 6 formulas, one can just know 3 and with those derive the rest or just one more to be able to get the ideal gas law, which needs 4.\nSince each formula only holds when only the state variables involved in said formula change while the others (which are a property of the gas but are not explicitly noted in said formula) remain constant, we cannot simply use algebra and directly combine them all. This is why:  Boyle did his experiments while keeping N and T constant and this must be taken into account (in this same way, every experiment kept some parameter as constant and this must be taken into account for the derivation).\nKeeping this in mind, to carry the derivation on correctly, one must imagine the gas being altered by one process at a time (as it was done in the experiments).

However, because each formula has two variables, this is possible only for certain groups of three. For example, if you were to have equations (1), (2) and (4) you would not be able to get any more because combining any two of them will only give you the third. However, if you had equations (1), (2) and (3) you would be able to get all six equations because combining (1) and (2) will yield (4), then (1) and (3) will yield (6), then (4) and (6) will yield (5), as well as would the combination of (2) and (3) as is explained in the following visual relation:\n\nwhere the numbers represent the gas laws numbered above.\nIf you were to use the same method used above on 2 of the 3 laws on the vertices of one triangle that has a \"O\" inside it, you would get the third.\nFor example:\nChange only pressure and volume first:\n\nthen only volume and temperature:\n\nthen as we can choose any value for \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          V\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V_{3}}\n  \n, if we set \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          V\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          V\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V_{1}=V_{3}}\n  \n, equation (2') becomes:\n\nCombining equations (1') and (3') yields \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              P\n              \n                1\n              \n            \n            \n              T\n              \n                1\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              P\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              T\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {P_{1}}{T_{1}}}={\\frac {P_{2}}{T_{2}}}}\n  \n, which is equation (4), of which we had no prior knowledge until this derivation.\n\n\nTheoretical\n\n\nKinetic theory\n\nThe ideal gas law can also be derived from first principles using the kinetic theory of gases, in which several simplifying assumptions are made, chief among which are that the molecules, or atoms, of the gas are point masses, possessing mass but no significant volume, and undergo only elastic collisions with each other and the sides of the container in which both linear momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.\nFirst we show that the fundamental assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases imply that\n\n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            3\n          \n        \n        n\n        m\n        \n          v\n          \n            rms\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P={\\frac {1}{3}}nmv_{\\text{rms}}^{2}.}\n  \n\nConsider a container in the \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        y\n        z\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xyz}\n  \n Cartesian coordinate system.
