Limits of functions are essential to calculus and mathematical analysis, and are used to define continuity, derivatives, and integrals.\nThe concept of a limit of a sequence is further generalized to the concept of a limit of a topological net, and is closely related to limit and direct limit in category theory.\nThe limit inferior and limit superior provide generalizations of the concept of a limit which are particularly relevant when the limit at a point may not exist.\n\n\nNotation\nIn formulas, a limit of a function is usually written as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          lim\n          \n            x\n            →\n            c\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        L\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to c}f(x)=L,}\n  \n\nand is read as \"the limit of \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n of \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n as \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n approaches \n  \n    \n      \n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c}\n  \n equals \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n\". This means that the value of the function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n can be made arbitrarily close to \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n, by choosing \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n sufficiently close to \n  \n    \n      \n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c}\n  \n. Alternatively, the fact that a function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n approaches the limit \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n as \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n approaches \n  \n    \n      \n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c}\n  \n is sometimes denoted by a right arrow (→ or \n  \n    \n      \n        →\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rightarrow }\n  \n), as in\n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        →\n        L\n        \n           as \n        \n        x\n        →\n        c\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)\\to L{\\text{ as }}x\\to c,}\n  \n\nor in\n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n          \n            →\n            \n              \n                x\n                →\n                c\n              \n            \n            \n          \n        \n        L\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x){\\xrightarrow[{x\\to c}]{}}L,}\n  \n\nwhich reads \"\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n of \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n tends to \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n as \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n tends to \n  \n    \n      \n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c}\n  \n\".\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to Hankel (1871), the modern concept of limit originates from Proposition X.1 of Euclid's Elements, which forms the basis of the Method of exhaustion found in Euclid and Archimedes: \"Two unequal magnitudes being set out, if from the greater there is subtracted a magnitude greater than its half, and from that which is left a magnitude greater than its half, and if this process is repeated continually, then there will be left some magnitude less than the lesser magnitude set out.\"\nGrégoire de Saint-Vincent gave the first definition of limit (terminus) of a geometric series in his work Opus Geometricum (1647): \"The terminus of a progression is the end of the series, which none progression can reach, even not if she is continued in infinity, but which she can approach nearer than a given segment.\" \nIn the Scholium to Principia in 1687, Isaac Newton had a clear definition of a limit, stating that \"Those ultimate ratios ... are not actually ratios of ultimate quantities, but limits ... which they can approach so closely that their difference is less than any given quantity\". Bruce Pourciau further argues that, in addition to Newton actually having a more sophisticated understanding of limits than he is generally credited with, he also provided the first epsilon argument.\nThe modern definition of a limit goes back to Bernard Bolzano who, in 1817, developed the basics of the epsilon-delta technique to define continuous functions. However, his work remained unknown to other mathematicians until thirty years after his death.\nAugustin-Louis Cauchy in 1821, followed by Karl Weierstrass, formalized the definition of the limit of a function which became known as the (ε, δ)-definition of limit.\nThe modern notation of placing the arrow below the limit symbol was invented by John Gaston Leathem in 1905 and popularized by G. H. Hardy's 1908 textbook A Course of Pure Mathematics.\n\n\nTypes of limits\n\n\nIn sequences\n\n\nReal numbers\nThe expression 0.999... should be interpreted as the limit of the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ... and so on. This sequence can be rigorously shown to have the limit 1, and therefore this expression is meaningfully interpreted as having the value 1.\nFormally, suppose a1, a2, ... is a sequence of real numbers. When the limit of the sequence exists, the real number L is the limit of this sequence if and only if for every real number ε > 0, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, we have |an − L| < ε.\nThe common notation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          lim\n          \n            n\n            →\n            ∞\n          \n        \n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        =\n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lim _{n\\to \\infty }a_{n}=L}\n  \n\nis read as:\n\n or \nThe formal definition intuitively means that eventually, all elements of the sequence get arbitrarily close to the limit, since the absolute value |an − L| is the distance between an and L. \nNot every sequence has a limit. A sequence with a limit is called convergent; otherwise it is called divergent. One can show that a convergent sequence has only one limit.\nThe limit of a sequence and the limit of a function are closely related. On one hand, the limit as n approaches infinity of a sequence {an} is simply the limit at infinity of a function a(n)—defined on the natural numbers {n}. On the other hand, if X is the domain of a function f(x) and if the limit as n approaches infinity of f(xn) is L for every arbitrary sequence of points {xn} in X − x0 which converges to x0, then the limit of the function f(x) as x approaches x0 is equal to L. One such sequence would be {x0 + 1/n}.\n\n\nInfinity as a limit\nThere is also a notion of having a limit \"tend to infinity\", rather than to a finite value \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n. A sequence \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{a_{n}\\}}\n  \n is said to \"tend to infinity\" if, for each real number \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M>0}\n  \n, known as the bound, there exists an integer \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n such that for each \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        >\n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n>N}\n  \n, \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        >\n        M\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a_{n}>M.}\n  \n\nThat is, for every possible bound, the sequence eventually exceeds the bound. This is often written \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          lim\n          \n            n\n            →\n            ∞\n          \n        \n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        =\n        ∞\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lim _{n\\rightarrow \\infty }a_{n}=\\infty }\n  \n or simply \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        →\n        ∞\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a_{n}\\rightarrow \\infty }\n  \n.\nIt is possible for a sequence to be divergent, but not tend to infinity. Such sequences are called oscillatory. An example of an oscillatory sequence is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        =\n        (\n        −\n        1\n        \n          )\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a_{n}=(-1)^{n}}\n  \n.\nThere is a corresponding notion of tending to negative infinity, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          lim\n          \n            n\n            →\n            ∞\n          \n        \n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        =\n        −\n        ∞\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lim _{n\\rightarrow \\infty }a_{n}=-\\infty }\n  \n, defined by changing the inequality in the above definition to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        <\n        M\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a_{n}<M,}\n  \n with \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n        <\n        0.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M<0.}\n  \n\nA sequence \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{a_{n}\\}}\n  \n with \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          lim\n          \n            n\n            →\n            ∞\n          \n        \n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        \n          |\n        \n        =\n        ∞\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lim _{n\\rightarrow \\infty }|a_{n}|=\\infty }\n  \n is called unbounded, a definition equally valid for sequences in the complex numbers, or in any metric space. Sequences which do not tend to infinity are called bounded. Sequences which do not tend to positive infinity are called bounded above, while those which do not tend to negative infinity are bounded below.\n\n\nMetric space\nThe discussion of sequences above is for sequences of real numbers. The notion of limits can be defined for sequences valued in more abstract spaces, such as metric spaces.

For example, consider the space of functions from a generic set \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} }\n  \n.

However, such sequences can exhibit unexpected behavior. For example, it is possible to construct a sequence of continuous functions which has a discontinuous pointwise limit. \nAnother notion of convergence is uniform convergence. The uniform distance between two functions \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        ,\n        g\n        :\n        E\n        →\n        \n          R\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f,g:E\\rightarrow \\mathbb {R} }\n  \n is the maximum difference between the two functions as the argument \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        ∈\n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\in E}\n  \n is varied. That is, \n\n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        (\n        f\n        ,\n        g\n        )\n        =\n        \n          max\n          \n            x\n            ∈\n            E\n          \n        \n        \n          |\n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        −\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n          |\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d(f,g)=\\max _{x\\in E}|f(x)-g(x)|.}\n  \n\nThen the sequence \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f_{n}}\n  \n is said to uniformly converge or have a uniform limit of \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n if \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        →\n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f_{n}\\rightarrow f}\n  \n with respect to this distance. The uniform limit has \"nicer\" properties than the pointwise limit. For example, the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous.\nMany different notions of convergence can be defined on function spaces. This is sometimes dependent on the regularity of the space. Prominent examples of function spaces with some notion of convergence are Lp spaces and Sobolev space.\n\n\nIn functions\n\nSuppose f is a real-valued function and c is a real number. Intuitively speaking, the expression\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          lim\n          \n            x\n            →\n            c\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to c}f(x)=L}\n  \n\nmeans that f(x) can be made to be as close to L as desired, by making x sufficiently close to c.

A series is absolutely convergent if \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∑\n          \n            n\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            ∞\n          \n        \n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty }|a_{n}|}\n  \n is well defined. Furthermore, all possible orderings give the same value.\nOtherwise, the series is conditionally convergent. A surprising result for conditionally convergent series is the Riemann series theorem: depending on the ordering, the partial sums can be made to converge to any real number, as well as \n  \n    \n      \n        ±\n        ∞\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pm \\infty }\n  \n.\n\n\nPower series\n\nA useful application of the theory of sums of series is for power series.

One way to quantify this is using the order of convergence of a sequence.\nA formal definition of order of convergence can be stated as follows. Suppose \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        \n          }\n          \n            n\n            >\n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{a_{n}\\}_{n>0}}\n  \n is a sequence of real numbers which is convergent with limit \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  \n. Furthermore, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        ≠\n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a_{n}\\neq a}\n  \n for all \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n.

There exist limit expressions whose modulus of convergence is undecidable. In recursion theory, the limit lemma proves that it is possible to encode undecidable problems using limits.\nThere are several theorems or tests that indicate whether the limit exists. These are known as convergence tests. Examples include the ratio test and the squeeze theorem. However they may not tell how to compute the limit.\n\n\nSee also\nAsymptotic analysis: a method of describing limiting behavior\nBig O notation: used to describe the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity\nBanach limit defined on the Banach space \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ℓ\n          \n            ∞\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ell ^{\\infty }}\n  \n that extends the usual limits.\nConvergence of random variables\nConvergent matrix\nLimit in category theory\nDirect limit\nInverse limit\nLimit of a function\nOne-sided limit: either of the two limits of functions of a real variable x, as x approaches a point from above or below\nList of limits: list of limits for common functions\nSqueeze theorem: finds a limit of a function via comparison with two other functions\nLimit superior and limit inferior\nModes of convergence\nAn annotated index\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nApostol, Tom M.
