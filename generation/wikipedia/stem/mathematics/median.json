  "extract": "The median of a set of numbers is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population, or a probability distribution. For a data set, it may be thought of as the “middle\" value. The basic feature of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply described as the \"average\") is that it is not skewed by a small proportion of extremely large or small values, and therefore provides a better representation of the center. Median income, for example, may be a better way to describe the center of the income distribution because increases in the largest incomes alone have no effect on the median. For this reason, the median is of central importance in robust statistics.\nMedian is a 2-quantile; it is the value that partitions a set into two equal parts.\n\n\nFinite set of numbers\nThe median of a finite list of numbers is the \"middle\" number, when those numbers are listed in order from smallest to greatest.\nIf the data set has an odd number of observations, the middle one is selected (after arranging in ascending order). For example, the following list of seven numbers,\n\nhas the median of 6, which is the fourth value.\nIf the data set has an even number of observations, there is no distinct middle value and the median is usually defined to be the arithmetic mean of the two middle values. For example, this data set of 8 numbers\n\nhas a median value of 4.5, that is \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        4\n        +\n        5\n        )\n        \n          /\n        \n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (4+5)/2}\n  \n. (In more technical terms, this interprets the median as the fully trimmed mid-range).\nIn general, with this convention, the median can be defined as follows: For a data set \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n elements, ordered from smallest to greatest,\n\n\nDefinition and notation\nFormally, a median of a population is any value such that at least half of the population is less than or equal to the proposed median and at least half is greater than or equal to the proposed median. As seen above, medians may not be unique. If each set contains more than half the population, then some of the population is exactly equal to the unique median.\nThe median is well-defined for any ordered (one-dimensional) data and is independent of any distance metric. The median can thus be applied to school classes which are ranked but not numerical (e.g. working out a median grade when student test scores are graded from F to A), although the result might be halfway between classes if there is an even number of classes. (For odd number classes, one specific class is determined as the median.)\nA geometric median, on the other hand, is defined in any number of dimensions. A related concept, in which the outcome is forced to correspond to a member of the sample, is the medoid.\nThere is no widely accepted standard notation for the median, but some authors represent the median of a variable x as med(x), x͂, as μ1/2, or as M. In any of these cases, the use of these or other symbols for the median needs to be explicitly defined when they are introduced.\nThe median is a special case of other ways of summarizing the typical values associated with a statistical distribution: it is the 2nd quartile, 5th decile, and 50th percentile.\n\n\nUses\nThe median can be used as a measure of location when one attaches reduced importance to extreme values, typically because a distribution is skewed, extreme values are not known, or outliers are untrustworthy, i.e., may be measurement or transcription errors.\nFor example, consider the multiset\n\nThe median is 2 in this case, as is the mode, and it might be seen as a better indication of the center than the arithmetic mean of 4, which is larger than all but one of the values.  However, the widely cited empirical relationship that the mean is shifted \"further into the tail\" of a distribution than the median is not generally true.  At most, one can say that the two statistics cannot be \"too far\" apart; see § Inequality relating means and medians below.\nAs a median is based on the middle data in a set, it is not necessary to know the value of extreme results in order to calculate it. For example, in a psychology test investigating the time needed to solve a problem, if a small number of people failed to solve the problem at all in the given time a median can still be calculated.\nBecause the median is simple to understand and easy to calculate, while also a robust approximation to the mean, the median is a popular summary statistic in descriptive statistics.  In this context, there are several choices for a measure of variability: the range, the interquartile range, the mean absolute deviation, and the median absolute deviation.\nFor practical purposes, different measures of location and dispersion are often compared on the basis of how well the corresponding population values can be estimated from a sample of data. The median, estimated using the sample median, has good properties in this regard. While it is not usually optimal if a given population distribution is assumed, its properties are always reasonably good. For example, a comparison of the efficiency of candidate estimators shows that the sample mean is more statistically efficient when—and only when— data is uncontaminated by data from heavy-tailed distributions or from mixtures of distributions.  Even then, the median has a 64% efficiency compared to the minimum-variance mean (for large normal samples), which is to say the variance of the median will be ~50% greater than the variance of the mean.\n\n\nProbability distributions\nA median of a real-valued random variable \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n is a real number \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n  \n that satisfies \n\n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        ⁡\n        (\n        X\n        <\n        m\n        )\n        ≤\n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        \n        \n          and\n        \n        \n        P\n        ⁡\n        (\n        X\n        >\n        m\n        )\n        ≤\n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {P} (X<m)\\leq {\\frac {1}{2}}\\quad {\\text{and}}\\quad \\operatorname {P} (X>m)\\leq {\\frac {1}{2}}}\n  \n\nor, equivalently with the complementary events,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        ⁡\n        (\n        X\n        ≥\n        m\n        )\n        ≥\n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        \n        \n          and\n        \n        \n        P\n        ⁡\n        (\n        X\n        ≤\n        m\n        )\n        ≥\n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {P} (X\\geq m)\\geq {\\frac {1}{2}}\\quad {\\text{and}}\\quad \\operatorname {P} (X\\leq m)\\geq {\\frac {1}{2}}\\,.}\n  \n\nSuch an \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n  \n always exists, but needs not be uniquely determined.

This is true for all members of the Pearson distribution family. However this is not always true. For example, the Weibull distribution family has members with positive mean, but mean < median. Violations of the rule are particularly common for discrete distributions. For example, any Poisson distribution has positive skew, but its mean < median whenever \n  \n    \n      \n        μ\n        \n          mod\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        >\n        ln\n        ⁡\n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu {\\bmod {1}}>\\ln 2}\n  \n. See  for a proof sketch.\nWhen the distribution has a monotonically decreasing probability density, then the median is less than the mean, as shown in the figure.\n\n\nJensen's inequality for medians\nJensen's inequality states that for any random variable X with a finite expectation E[X] and for any convex function f\n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        E\n        ⁡\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n        ≤\n        E\n        ⁡\n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(\\operatorname {E} (x))\\leq \\operatorname {E} (f(x))}\n  \n\nThis inequality generalizes to the median as well.

This includes the median, which is the ⁠n/2⁠th order statistic (or for an even number of samples, the arithmetic mean of the two middle order statistics).\nSelection algorithms still have the downside of requiring Ω(n) memory, that is, they need to have the full sample (or a linear-sized portion of it) in memory. Because this, as well as the linear time requirement, can be prohibitive, several estimation procedures for the median have been developed. A simple one is the median of three rule, which estimates the median as the median of a three-element subsample; this is commonly used as a subroutine in the quicksort sorting algorithm, which uses an estimate of its input's median. A more robust estimator is Tukey's ninther, which is the median of three rule applied with limited recursion: if A is the sample laid out as an array, and\n\nthen\n\nThe remedian is an estimator for the median that requires linear time but sub-linear memory, operating in a single pass over the sample.\n\n\nSampling distribution\nThe distributions of both the sample mean and the sample median were determined by Laplace.

The observed mean is 3.16, the observed raw median is 3 and the observed interpolated median is 3.174.  The following table gives some comparison statistics.\n\nThe expected value of the median falls slightly as sample size increases while, as would be expected, the standard errors of both the median and the mean are proportionate to the inverse square root of the sample size.  The asymptotic approximation errs on the side of caution by overestimating the standard error.\n\n\nEstimation of variance from sample data\nThe value of \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        2\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n          )\n          \n            −\n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (2f(x))^{-2}}\n  \n—the asymptotic value of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            −\n            1\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        ν\n        −\n        m\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n^{-1/2}(\\nu -m)}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        ν\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nu }\n  \n is the population median—has been studied by several authors. The standard \"delete one\" jackknife method produces inconsistent results.

This method may be computationally expensive for large data sets. A bootstrap estimate is known to be consistent, but converges very slowly (order of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n          \n            −\n            \n              \n                1\n                4\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n^{-{\\frac {1}{4}}}}\n  \n). Other methods have been proposed but their behavior may differ between large and small samples.\n\n\nEfficiency\nThe efficiency of the sample median, measured as the ratio of the variance of the mean to the variance of the median, depends on the sample size and on the underlying population distribution.

Pareto interpolation is an application of this when the population is assumed to have a Pareto distribution.\n\n\nMultivariate median\nPreviously, this article discussed the univariate median, when the sample or population had one-dimension. When the dimension is two or higher, there are multiple concepts that extend the definition of the univariate median; each such multivariate median agrees with the univariate median when the dimension is exactly one.\n\n\nMarginal median\nThe marginal median is defined for vectors defined with respect to a fixed set of coordinates. A marginal median is defined to be the vector whose components are univariate medians. The marginal median is easy to compute, and its properties were studied by Puri and Sen.\n\n\nGeometric median\nThe geometric median of a discrete set of sample points \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        …\n        \n          x\n          \n            N\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1},\\ldots x_{N}}\n  \n in a Euclidean space is the point minimizing the sum of distances to the sample points.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              μ\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              r\n              g\n              \n              m\n              i\n              n\n            \n            \n              μ\n              ∈\n              \n                \n                  R\n                \n                \n                  m\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          ∑\n          \n            n\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            N\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            ‖\n            \n              μ\n              −\n              \n                x\n                \n                  n\n                \n              \n            \n            ‖\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {\\mu }}={\\underset {\\mu \\in \\mathbb {R} ^{m}}{\\operatorname {arg\\,min} }}\\sum _{n=1}^{N}\\left\\|\\mu -x_{n}\\right\\|_{2}}\n  \n\nIn contrast to the marginal median, the geometric median is equivariant with respect to Euclidean similarity transformations such as translations and rotations.\n\n\nMedian in all directions\nIf the marginal medians for all coordinate systems coincide, then their common location may be termed the \"median in all directions\". This concept is relevant to voting theory on account of the median voter theorem. When it exists, the median in all directions coincides with the geometric median (at least for discrete distributions).\n\n\nCenterpoint\n\n\nConditional median\nThe conditional median occurs in the setting where we seek to estimate a random variable \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n from a random variable \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n  \n, which is a noisy version of \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n.

An example of this is a Likert scale, on which opinions or preferences are expressed on a scale with a set number of possible responses. If the scale consists of the positive integers, an observation of 3 might be regarded as representing the interval from 2.50 to 3.50. It is possible to estimate the median of the underlying variable. If, say, 22% of the observations are of value 2 or below and 55.0% are of 3 or below (so 33% have the value 3), then the median \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n  \n is 3 since the median is the smallest value of \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n for which \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F(x)}\n  \n is greater than a half. But the interpolated median is somewhere between 2.50 and 3.50.  First we add half of the interval width \n  \n    \n      \n        w\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w}\n  \n to the median to get the upper bound of the median interval. Then we subtract that proportion of the interval width which equals the proportion of the 33% which lies above the 50% mark.  In other words, we split up the interval width pro rata to the numbers of observations.  In this case, the 33% is split into 28% below the median and 5% above it so we subtract 5/33 of the interval width from the upper bound of 3.50 to give an interpolated median of 3.35.

The Hodges–Lehmann estimator has been generalized to multivariate distributions.\n\n\nVariants of regression\nThe Theil–Sen estimator is a method for robust linear regression based on finding medians of slopes.\n\n\nMedian filter\nThe median filter is an important tool of image processing, that can effectively remove any salt-and-pepper noise from grayscale images.\n\n\nCluster analysis\n\nIn cluster analysis, the k-medians clustering algorithm provides a way of defining clusters, in which the criterion of maximising the distance between cluster-means that is used in k-means clustering, is replaced by maximising the distance between cluster-medians.\n\n\nMedian–median line\nThis is a method of robust regression. The idea dates back to Wald in 1940 who suggested dividing a set of bivariate data into two halves depending on the value of the independent parameter \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n: a left half with values less than the median and a right half with values greater than the median. He suggested taking the means of the dependent \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n and independent \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n variables of the left and the right halves and estimating the slope of the line joining these two points. The line could then be adjusted to fit the majority of the points in the data set.\nNair and Shrivastava in 1942 suggested a similar idea but instead advocated dividing the sample into three equal parts before calculating the means of the subsamples. Brown and Mood in 1951 proposed the idea of using the medians of two subsamples rather the means. Tukey combined these ideas and recommended dividing the sample into three equal size subsamples and estimating the line based on the medians of the subsamples.\n\n\nMedian-unbiased estimators\n\nAny mean-unbiased estimator minimizes the risk (expected loss) with respect to the squared-error loss function, as observed by Gauss. A median-unbiased estimator minimizes the risk with respect to the absolute-deviation loss function, as observed by Laplace. Other loss functions are used in statistical theory, particularly in robust statistics.\nThe theory of median-unbiased estimators was revived by George W. Brown in 1947:\n\nAn estimate of a one-dimensional parameter θ will be said to be median-unbiased if, for fixed θ, the median of the distribution of the estimate is at the value θ; i.e., the estimate underestimates just as often as it overestimates. This requirement seems for most purposes to accomplish as much as the mean-unbiased requirement and has the additional property that it is invariant under one-to-one transformation.\nFurther properties of median-unbiased estimators have been reported. \nThere are methods of constructing median-unbiased estimators that are optimal (in a sense analogous to the minimum-variance property for mean-unbiased estimators). Such constructions exist for probability distributions having monotone likelihood-functions. One such procedure is an analogue of the Rao–Blackwell procedure for mean-unbiased estimators: The procedure holds for a smaller class of probability distributions than does the Rao—Blackwell procedure but for a larger class of loss functions.\n\n\nHistory\nScientific researchers in the ancient near east appear not to have used summary statistics altogether, instead choosing values that offered maximal consistency with a broader theory that integrated a wide variety of phenomena.  Within the Mediterranean (and, later, European) scholarly community, statistics like the mean are fundamentally a medieval and early modern development.  (The history of the median outside Europe and its predecessors remains relatively unstudied.)\nThe idea of the median appeared in the 6th century in the Talmud, in order to fairly analyze divergent appraisals.  However, the concept did not spread to the broader scientific community.\nInstead, the closest ancestor of the modern median is the mid-range, invented by Al-Biruni  Transmission of his work to later scholars is unclear. He applied his technique to assaying currency metals, but, after he published his work, most assayers still adopted the most unfavorable value from their results, lest they appear to cheat.  However, increased navigation at sea during the Age of Discovery meant that ship's navigators increasingly had to attempt to determine latitude in unfavorable weather against hostile shores, leading to renewed interest in summary statistics.  Whether rediscovered or independently invented, the mid-range is recommended to nautical navigators in Harriot's \"Instructions for Raleigh's Voyage to Guiana, 1595\".\nThe idea of the median may have first appeared in Edward Wright's 1599 book Certaine Errors in Navigation on a section about compass navigation. Wright was reluctant to discard measured values, and may have felt that the median — incorporating a greater proportion of the dataset than the mid-range — was more likely to be correct.  However, Wright did not give examples of his technique's use, making it hard to verify that he described the modern notion of median.  The median (in the context of probability) certainly appeared in the correspondence of Christiaan Huygens, but as an example of a statistic that was inappropriate for actuarial practice.\nThe earliest recommendation of the median dates to 1757, when Roger Joseph Boscovich developed a regression method based on the L1 norm and therefore implicitly on the median.  In 1774, Laplace made this desire explicit: he suggested the median be used as the standard estimator of the value of a posterior PDF. The specific criterion was to minimize the expected magnitude of the error; \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        α\n        −\n        \n          α\n          \n            ∗\n          \n        \n        \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |\\alpha -\\alpha ^{*}|}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          α\n          \n            ∗\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha ^{*}}\n  \n is the estimate and \n  \n    \n      \n        α\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n  \n is the true value.  To this end, Laplace determined the distributions of both the sample mean and the sample median in the early 1800s.  However, a decade later, Gauss and Legendre developed the least squares method, which minimizes \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        α\n        −\n        \n          α\n          \n            ∗\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\alpha -\\alpha ^{*})^{2}}\n  \n to obtain the mean; the strong justification of this estimator by reference to maximum likelihood estimation based on a normal distribution means it has mostly replaced Laplace's original suggestion.\nAntoine Augustin Cournot in 1843 was the first to use the term median (valeur médiane) for the value that divides a probability distribution into two equal halves. Gustav Theodor Fechner used the median (Centralwerth) in sociological and psychological phenomena. It had earlier been used only in astronomy and related fields. Gustav Fechner popularized the median into the formal analysis of data, although it had been used previously by Laplace, and the median appeared in a textbook by F. Y. Edgeworth.  Francis Galton used the term median in 1881, having earlier used the terms middle-most value in 1869, and the medium in 1880.\n\n\nSee also\n\nAbsolute deviation – Difference between a variable's observed value and a reference valuePages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nBias of an estimator – Statistical property\nCentral tendency – Statistical value representing the center or average of a distribution\nConcentration of measure – Statistical parameter for Lipschitz functions – Strong form of uniform continuityPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nMedian graph – Graph with a median for each three vertices\nMedian of medians – Fast approximate median algorithm – Algorithm to calculate the approximate median in linear time\nMedian search – Method for finding kth smallest valuePages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nMedian slope – Statistical method for fitting a linePages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nMedian voter theory – Theorem in political sciencePages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nMedoid – Objects maximally similar to other objects in a datasets – Generalization of the median in higher dimensions\nMoving average#Moving median – Type of statistical measure over subsets of a dataset\nMedian absolute deviation – Statistical measure of variability\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"Median (in statistics)\", Encyclopedia of Mathematics, EMS Press, 2001 [1994]\nMedian as a weighted arithmetic mean of all Sample Observations\nOn-line calculator\nCalculating the median\nA problem involving the mean, the median, and the mode.\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Statistical Median\".
