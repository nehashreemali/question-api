The standard deviation of the distribution is ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        σ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma }\n  \n⁠ (sigma). A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed and is called a normal deviate.\nNormal distributions are important in statistics and are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. Their importance is partly due to the central limit theorem. It states that, under some conditions, the average of many samples (observations) of a random variable with finite mean and variance is itself a random variable—whose distribution converges to a normal distribution as the number of samples increases. Therefore, physical quantities that are expected to be the sum of many independent processes, such as measurement errors, often have distributions that are nearly normal.\nMoreover, Gaussian distributions have some unique properties that are valuable in analytic studies. For instance, any linear combination of a fixed collection of independent normal deviates is a normal deviate. Many results and methods, such as propagation of uncertainty and least squares parameter fitting, can be derived analytically in explicit form when the relevant variables are normally distributed.\nA normal distribution is sometimes informally called a bell curve. However, many other distributions are bell-shaped (such as the Cauchy, Student's t, and logistic distributions). (For other names, see Naming.)\nThe univariate probability distribution is generalized for vectors in the multivariate normal distribution and for matrices in the matrix normal distribution.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nStandard normal distribution\nThe simplest case of a normal distribution is known as the standard normal distribution or unit normal distribution.

It is also the continuous distribution with the maximum entropy for a specified mean and variance. Geary has shown, assuming that the mean and variance are finite, that the normal distribution is the only distribution where the mean and variance calculated from a set of independent draws are independent of each other.\nThe normal distribution is a subclass of the elliptical distributions. The normal distribution is symmetric about its mean, and is non-zero over the entire real line. As such it may not be a suitable model for variables that are inherently positive or strongly skewed, such as the weight of a person or the price of a share. Such variables may be better described by other distributions, such as the log-normal distribution or the Pareto distribution.\nThe value of the normal density is practically zero when the value ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n⁠ lies more than a few standard deviations away from the mean (e.g., a spread of three standard deviations covers all but 0.27% of the total distribution). Therefore, it may not be an appropriate model when one expects a significant fraction of outliers—values that lie many standard deviations away from the mean—and least squares and other statistical inference methods that are optimal for normally distributed variables often become highly unreliable when applied to such data. In those cases, a more heavy-tailed distribution should be assumed and the appropriate robust statistical inference methods applied.\nThe Gaussian distribution belongs to the family of stable distributions which are the attractors of sums of independent, identically distributed distributions whether or not the mean or variance is finite. Except for the Gaussian which is a limiting case, all stable distributions have heavy tails and infinite variance. It is one of the few distributions that are stable and that have probability density functions that can be expressed analytically, the others being the Cauchy distribution and the Lévy distribution.\n\n\nSymmetries and derivatives\nThe normal distribution with density \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle f(x)}\n  \n (mean ⁠\n

It is typically the case that such approximations are less accurate in the tails of the distribution.\nA general upper bound for the approximation error in the central limit theorem is given by the Berry–Esseen theorem, improvements of the approximation are given by the Edgeworth expansions.\nThis theorem can also be used to justify modeling the sum of many uniform noise sources as Gaussian noise.

Cramér's theorem implies that a linear combination of independent non-Gaussian variables will never have an exactly normal distribution, although it may approach it arbitrarily closely.\n\n\nThe Kac–Bernstein theorem\nThe Kac–Bernstein theorem states that if \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle X}\n  \n and ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n  \n⁠ are independent and \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        +\n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle X+Y}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        −\n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle X-Y}\n  \n are also independent, then both X and Y must necessarily have normal distributions.\nMore generally, if \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          X\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        \n          X\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle X_{1},\\ldots ,X_{n}}\n  \n are independent random variables, then two distinct linear combinations \n  \n    \n      \n        ∑\n        \n          \n            a\n            \n              k\n            \n          \n          \n            X\n            \n              k\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle \\sum {a_{k}X_{k}}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        ∑\n        \n          \n            b\n            \n              k\n            \n          \n          \n            X\n            \n              k\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle \\sum {b_{k}X_{k}}}\n  \nwill be independent if and only if all \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          X\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle X_{k}}\n  \n are normal and \n  \n    \n      \n        ∑\n        \n          \n            a\n            \n              k\n            \n          \n          \n            b\n            \n              k\n            \n          \n          \n            σ\n            \n              k\n            \n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          =\n          0\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle \\sum {a_{k}b_{k}\\sigma _{k}^{2}=0}}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          σ\n          \n            k\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle \\sigma _{k}^{2}}\n  \n denotes the variance of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          X\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle X_{k}}\n  \n.\n\n\nExtensions\nThe notion of normal distribution, being one of the most important distributions in probability theory, has been extended far beyond the standard framework of the univariate (that is one-dimensional) case (Case 1). All these extensions are also called normal or Gaussian laws, so a certain ambiguity in names exists.\n\nThe multivariate normal distribution describes the Gaussian law in the k-dimensional Euclidean space. A vector X ∈ Rk is multivariate-normally distributed if any linear combination of its components Σkj=1aj Xj has a (univariate) normal distribution. The variance of X is a k × k symmetric positive-definite matrix V. The multivariate normal distribution is a special case of the elliptical distributions. As such, its iso-density loci in the k = 2 case are ellipses and in the case of arbitrary k are ellipsoids.\nRectified Gaussian distribution a rectified version of normal distribution with all the negative elements reset to 0.\nComplex normal distribution deals with the complex normal vectors. A complex vector X ∈ Ck is said to be normal if both its real and imaginary components jointly possess a 2k-dimensional multivariate normal distribution. The variance-covariance structure of X is described by two matrices: the variance matrix Γ, and the relation matrix C.\nMatrix normal distribution describes the case of normally distributed matrices.\nGaussian processes are the normally distributed stochastic processes. These can be viewed as elements of some infinite-dimensional Hilbert space H, and thus are the analogues of multivariate normal vectors for the case k = ∞. A random element h ∈ H is said to be normal if for any constant a ∈ H the scalar product (a, h) has a (univariate) normal distribution. The variance structure of such Gaussian random element can be described in terms of the linear covariance operator K: H → H. Several Gaussian processes became popular enough to have their own names:\nBrownian motion;\nBrownian bridge; and\nOrnstein–Uhlenbeck process.\nGaussian q-distribution is an abstract mathematical construction that represents a q-analogue of the normal distribution.\nthe q-Gaussian is an analogue of the Gaussian distribution, in the sense that it maximises the Tsallis entropy, and is one type of Tsallis distribution. This distribution is different from the Gaussian q-distribution above.\nThe Kaniadakis κ-Gaussian distribution is a generalization of the Gaussian distribution which arises from the Kaniadakis statistics, being one of the Kaniadakis distributions.\nA random variable X has a two-piece normal distribution if it has a distribution\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n

the main practical uses of the Gaussian law is to model the empirical distributions of many different random variables encountered in practice. In such case a possible extension would be a richer family of distributions, having more than two parameters and therefore being able to fit the empirical distribution more accurately. The examples of such extensions are:\n\nPearson distribution — a four-parameter family of probability distributions that extend the normal law to include different skewness and kurtosis values.\nThe generalized normal distribution, also known as the exponential power distribution, allows for distribution tails with thicker or thinner asymptotic behaviors.\n\n\nStatistical inference\n\n\nEstimation of parameters\n\nIt is often the case that we do not know the parameters of the normal distribution, but instead want to estimate them.

In practice people usually take α = 5%, resulting in the 95% confidence intervals. The confidence interval for σ can be found by taking the square root of the interval bounds for σ2.\nApproximate formulas can be derived from the asymptotic distributions of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                μ\n                ^\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\hat {\\mu }}}\n  \n and s2:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        μ\n        ∈\n        \n          [\n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  μ\n                  ^\n                \n              \n            \n            −\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    |\n                  \n                  \n                    z\n                    \n                      α\n                      \n                        /\n                      \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    |\n                  \n                \n                \n                  n\n                \n              \n            \n            s\n            ,\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  μ\n                  ^\n                \n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    |\n                  \n                  \n                    z\n                    \n                      α\n                      \n                        /\n                      \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    |\n                  \n                \n                \n                  n\n                \n              \n            \n            s\n          \n          ]\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu \\in \\left[{\\hat {\\mu }}-{\\frac {|z_{\\alpha /2}|}{\\sqrt {n}}}s,\\,{\\hat {\\mu }}+{\\frac {|z_{\\alpha /2}|}{\\sqrt {n}}}s\\right]}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          σ\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ∈\n        \n          [\n          \n            \n              s\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            −\n            \n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    |\n                  \n                  \n                    z\n                    \n                      α\n                      \n                        /\n                      \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    |\n                  \n                \n                \n                  n\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              s\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            ,\n            \n            \n              s\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    |\n                  \n                  \n                    z\n                    \n                      α\n                      \n                        /\n                      \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    |\n                  \n                \n                \n                  n\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              s\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          ]\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma ^{2}\\in \\left[s^{2}-{\\sqrt {2}}{\\frac {|z_{\\alpha /2}|}{\\sqrt {n}}}s^{2},\\,s^{2}+{\\sqrt {2}}{\\frac {|z_{\\alpha /2}|}{\\sqrt {n}}}s^{2}\\right]}\n  \n\nThe approximate formulas become valid for large values of n, and are more convenient for the manual calculation since the standard normal quantiles zα/2 do not depend on n. In particular, the most popular value of α = 5%, results in |z0.025| = 1.96.\n\n\nNormality tests\n\nNormality tests assess the likelihood that the given data set {x1, ..., xn} comes from a normal distribution. Typically the null hypothesis H0 is that the observations are distributed normally with unspecified mean μ and variance σ2, versus the alternative Ha that the distribution is arbitrary. Many tests (over 40) have been devised for this problem. The more prominent of them are outlined below:\nDiagnostic plots are more intuitively appealing but subjective at the same time, as they rely on informal human judgement to accept or reject the null hypothesis.\n\nQ–Q plot, also known as normal probability plot or rankit plot—is a plot of the sorted values from the data set against the expected values of the corresponding quantiles from the standard normal distribution. That is, it is a plot of point of the form (Φ−1(pk), x(k)), where plotting points pk are equal to pk = (k − α)/(n + 1 − 2α) and α is an adjustment constant, which can be anything between 0 and 1. If the null hypothesis is true, the plotted points should approximately lie on a straight line.\nP–P plot – similar to the Q–Q plot, but used much less frequently. This method consists of plotting the points (Φ(z(k)), pk), where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            z\n            \n              (\n              k\n              )\n            \n          \n          =\n          (\n          \n            x\n            \n              (\n              k\n              )\n            \n          \n          −\n          \n            \n              \n                μ\n                ^\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n          \n            /\n          \n          \n            \n              \n                σ\n                ^\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle \\textstyle z_{(k)}=(x_{(k)}-{\\hat {\\mu }})/{\\hat {\\sigma }}}\n  \n.

The test compares the least squares estimate of that slope with the value of the sample variance, and rejects the null hypothesis if these two quantities differ significantly.\nTests based on the empirical distribution function:\n\nAnderson–Darling test\nLilliefors test (an adaptation of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test)\n\n\nBayesian analysis of the normal distribution\nBayesian analysis of normally distributed data is complicated by the many different possibilities that may be considered:\n\nEither the mean, or the variance, or neither, may be considered a fixed quantity.\nWhen the variance is unknown, analysis may be done directly in terms of the variance, or in terms of the precision, the reciprocal of the variance. The reason for expressing the formulas in terms of precision is that the analysis of most cases is simplified.\nBoth univariate and multivariate cases need to be considered.\nEither conjugate or improper prior distributions may be placed on the unknown variables.\nAn additional set of cases occurs in Bayesian linear regression, where in the basic model the data is assumed to be normally distributed, and normal priors are placed on the regression coefficients. The resulting analysis is similar to the basic cases of independent identically distributed data.\nThe formulas for the non-linear-regression cases are summarized in the conjugate prior article.\n\n\nSum of two quadratics\n\n\nScalar form\nThe following auxiliary formula is useful for simplifying the posterior update equations, which otherwise become fairly tedious.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        (\n        x\n        −\n        y\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        b\n        (\n        x\n        −\n        z\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        (\n        a\n        +\n        b\n        )\n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              x\n              −\n              \n                \n                  \n                    a\n                    y\n                    +\n                    b\n                    z\n                  \n                  \n                    a\n                    +\n                    b\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              b\n            \n            \n              a\n              +\n              b\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        y\n        −\n        z\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a(x-y)^{2}+b(x-z)^{2}=(a+b)\\left(x-{\\frac {ay+bz}{a+b}}\\right)^{2}+{\\frac {ab}{a+b}}(y-z)^{2}}\n  \n\nThis equation rewrites the sum of two quadratics in x by expanding the squares, grouping the terms in x, and completing the square.

precision of the data to the prior total precision, and form a new mean through a precision-weighted average, i.e. a weighted average of the data mean and the prior mean, each weighted by the associated total precision. This makes logical sense if the precision is thought of as indicating the certainty of the observations: In the distribution of the posterior mean, each of the input components is weighted by its certainty, and the certainty of this distribution is the sum of the individual certainties. (For the intuition of this, compare the expression \"the whole is (or is not) greater than the sum of its parts\". In addition, consider that the knowledge of the posterior comes from a combination of the knowledge of the prior and likelihood, so it makes sense that we are more certain of it than of either of its components.)\nThe above formula reveals why it is more convenient to do Bayesian analysis of conjugate priors for the normal distribution in terms of the precision. The posterior precision is simply the sum of the prior and likelihood precisions, and the posterior mean is computed through a precision-weighted average, as described above. The same formulas can be written in terms of variance by reciprocating all the precisions, yielding the more ugly formulas\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n

^{2})}\n  \n with unknown mean μ and unknown variance σ2, a combined (multivariate) conjugate prior is placed over the mean and variance, consisting of a normal-inverse-gamma distribution.\nLogically, this originates as follows:\n\nFrom the analysis of the case with unknown mean but known variance, we see that the update equations involve sufficient statistics computed from the data consisting of the mean of the data points and the total variance of the data points, computed in turn from the known variance divided by the number of data points.\nFrom the analysis of the case with unknown variance but known mean, we see that the update equations involve sufficient statistics over the data consisting of the number of data points and sum of squared deviations.\nKeep in mind that the posterior update values serve as the prior distribution when further data is handled. Thus, we should logically think of our priors in terms of the sufficient statistics just described, with the same semantics kept in mind as much as possible.\nTo handle the case where both mean and variance are unknown, we could place independent priors over the mean and variance, with fixed estimates of the average mean, total variance, number of data points used to compute the variance prior, and sum of squared deviations. Note however that in reality, the total variance of the mean depends on the unknown variance, and the sum of squared deviations that goes into the variance prior (appears to) depend on the unknown mean. In practice, the latter dependence is relatively unimportant: Shifting the actual mean shifts the generated points by an equal amount, and on average the squared deviations will remain the same. This is not the case, however, with the total variance of the mean: As the unknown variance increases, the total variance of the mean will increase proportionately, and we would like to capture this dependence.\nThis suggests that we create a conditional prior of the mean on the unknown variance, with a hyperparameter specifying the mean of the pseudo-observations associated with the prior, and another parameter specifying the number of pseudo-observations. This number serves as a scaling parameter on the variance, making it possible to control the overall variance of the mean relative to the actual variance parameter. The prior for the variance also has two hyperparameters, one specifying the sum of squared deviations of the pseudo-observations associated with the prior, and another specifying once again the number of pseudo-observations. Each of the priors has a hyperparameter specifying the number of pseudo-observations, and in each case this controls the relative variance of that prior. These are given as two separate hyperparameters so that the variance (aka the confidence) of the two priors can be controlled separately.\nThis leads immediately to the normal-inverse-gamma distribution, which is the product of the two distributions just defined, with conjugate priors used (an inverse gamma distribution over the variance, and a normal distribution over the mean, conditional on the variance) and with the same four parameters just defined.\nThe priors are normally defined as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n

When the outcome is produced by many small effects acting additively and independently, its distribution will be close to normal. The normal approximation will not be valid if the effects act multiplicatively (instead of additively), or if there is a single external influence that has a considerably larger magnitude than the rest of the effects.\n\nIn counting problems, where the central limit theorem includes a discrete-to-continuum approximation and where infinitely divisible and decomposable distributions are involved, such as\nBinomial random variables, associated with binary response variables;\nPoisson random variables, associated with rare events;\nThermal radiation has a Bose–Einstein distribution on very short time scales, and a normal distribution on longer timescales due to the central limit theorem.\n\n\nAssumed normality\n\nI can only recognize the occurrence of the normal curve – the Laplacian curve of errors – as a very abnormal phenomenon. It is roughly approximated to in certain distributions; for this reason, and on account for its beautiful simplicity, we may, perhaps, use it as a first approximation, particularly in theoretical investigations.\nThere are statistical methods to empirically test that assumption; see the above Normality tests section.\n\nIn biology, the logarithm of various variables tend to have a normal distribution, that is, they tend to have a log-normal distribution (after separation on male/female subpopulations), with examples including:\nMeasures of size of living tissue (length, height, skin area, weight);\nThe length of inert appendages (hair, claws, nails, teeth) of biological specimens, in the direction of growth; presumably the thickness of tree bark also falls under this category;\nCertain physiological measurements, such as blood pressure of adult humans.\nIn finance, in particular the Black–Scholes model, changes in the logarithm of exchange rates, price indices, and stock market indices are assumed normal (these variables behave like compound interest, not like simple interest, and so are multiplicative). Some mathematicians such as Benoit Mandelbrot have argued that log-Levy distributions, which possess heavy tails, would be a more appropriate model, in particular for the analysis for stock market crashes. The use of the assumption of normal distribution occurring in financial models has also been criticized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his works.\nMeasurement errors in physical experiments are often modeled by a normal distribution. This use of a normal distribution does not imply that one is assuming the measurement errors are normally distributed, rather using the normal distribution produces the most conservative predictions possible given only knowledge about the mean and variance of the errors.\nIn standardized testing, results can be made to have a normal distribution by either selecting the number and difficulty of questions (as in the IQ test) or transforming the raw test scores into output scores by fitting them to the normal distribution. For example, the SAT's traditional range of 200–800 is based on a normal distribution with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100.\n\nMany scores are derived from the normal distribution, including percentile ranks (percentiles or quantiles), normal curve equivalents, stanines, z-scores, and T-scores. Additionally, some behavioral statistical procedures assume that scores are normally distributed; for example, t-tests and ANOVAs. Bell curve grading assigns relative grades based on a normal distribution of scores.\nIn hydrology the distribution of long duration river discharge or rainfall, e.g. monthly and yearly totals, is often thought to be practically normal according to the central limit theorem. The plot on the right illustrates an example of fitting the normal distribution to ranked October rainfalls showing the 90% confidence belt based on the binomial distribution. The rainfall data are represented by plotting positions as part of the cumulative frequency analysis.\n\n\nMethodological problems and peer review\nJohn Ioannidis argued that using normally distributed standard deviations as standards for validating research findings leave falsifiable predictions about phenomena that are not normally distributed untested. This includes, for example, phenomena that only appear when all necessary conditions are present and one cannot be a substitute for another in an addition-like way and phenomena that are not randomly distributed. Ioannidis argues that standard deviation-centered validation gives a false appearance of validity to hypotheses and theories where some but not all falsifiable predictions are normally distributed since the portion of falsifiable predictions that there is evidence against may and in some cases are in the non-normally distributed parts of the range of falsifiable predictions, as well as baselessly dismissing hypotheses for which none of the falsifiable predictions are normally distributed as if they were unfalsifiable when in fact they do make falsifiable predictions. It is argued by Ioannidis that many cases of mutually exclusive theories being accepted as validated by research journals are caused by failure of the journals to take in empirical falsifications of non-normally distributed predictions, and not because mutually exclusive theories are true, which they cannot be, although two mutually exclusive theories can both be wrong and a third one correct.\n\n\nComputational methods\n\n\nGenerating values from normal distribution\n\nIn computer simulations, especially in applications of the Monte-Carlo method, it is often desirable to generate values that are normally distributed. The algorithms listed below all generate the standard normal deviates, since a N(μ, σ2) can be generated as X = μ + σZ, where Z is standard normal. All these algorithms rely on the availability of a random number generator U capable of producing uniform random variates.\n\nThe most straightforward method is based on the probability integral transform property: if U is distributed uniformly on (0,1), then Φ−1(U) will have the standard normal distribution. The drawback of this method is that it relies on calculation of the probit function Φ−1, which cannot be done analytically. Some approximate methods are described in Hart (1968) and in the erf article. Wichura gives a fast algorithm for computing this function to 16 decimal places, which is used by R to compute random variates of the normal distribution.\nAn easy-to-program approximate approach that relies on the central limit theorem is as follows: generate 12 uniform U(0,1) deviates, add them all up, and subtract 6 – the resulting random variable will have approximately standard normal distribution. In truth, the distribution will be Irwin–Hall, which is a 12-section eleventh-order polynomial approximation to the normal distribution. This random deviate will have a limited range of (−6, 6). Note that in a true normal distribution, only 0.00034% of all samples will fall outside ±6σ.\nThe Box–Muller method uses two independent random numbers U and V distributed uniformly on (0,1). Then the two random variables X and Y \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        =\n        \n          \n            −\n            2\n            ln\n            ⁡\n            U\n          \n        \n        \n        cos\n        ⁡\n        (\n        2\n        π\n        V\n        )\n        ,\n        \n        Y\n        =\n        \n          \n            −\n            2\n            ln\n            ⁡\n            U\n          \n        \n        \n        sin\n        ⁡\n        (\n        2\n        π\n        V\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X={\\sqrt {-2\\ln U}}\\,\\cos(2\\pi V),\\qquad Y={\\sqrt {-2\\ln U}}\\,\\sin(2\\pi V).}\n  \n will both have the standard normal distribution, and will be independent. This formulation arises because for a bivariate normal random vector (X, Y) the squared norm X2 + Y2 will have the chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom, which is an easily generated exponential random variable corresponding to the quantity −2 ln(U) in these equations; and the angle is distributed uniformly around the circle, chosen by the random variable V.\nThe Marsaglia polar method is a modification of the Box–Muller method which does not require computation of the sine and cosine functions. In this method, U and V are drawn from the uniform (−1,1) distribution, and then S = U2 + V2 is computed. If S is greater or equal to 1, then the method starts over, otherwise the two quantities \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        =\n        U\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                −\n                2\n                ln\n                ⁡\n                S\n              \n              S\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        Y\n        =\n        V\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                −\n                2\n                ln\n                ⁡\n                S\n              \n              S\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X=U{\\sqrt {\\frac {-2\\ln S}{S}}},\\qquad Y=V{\\sqrt {\\frac {-2\\ln S}{S}}}}\n  \n are returned. Again, X and Y are independent, standard normal random variables.\nThe Ratio method is a rejection method. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\nGenerate two independent uniform deviates U and V;\nCompute X = √8/e (V − 0.5)/U;\nOptional: if X2 ≤ 5 − 4e1/4U then accept X and terminate algorithm;\nOptional: if X2 ≥ 4e−1.35/U + 1.4 then reject X and start over from step 1;\nIf X2 ≤ −4 ln U then accept X, otherwise start over the algorithm.\nThe two optional steps allow the evaluation of the logarithm in the last step to be avoided in most cases. These steps can be greatly improved so that the logarithm is rarely evaluated.\nThe ziggurat algorithm is faster than the Box–Muller transform and still exact. In about 97% of all cases it uses only two random numbers, one random integer and one random uniform, one multiplication and an if-test. Only in 3% of the cases, where the combination of those two falls outside the \"core of the ziggurat\" (a kind of rejection sampling using logarithms), do exponentials and more uniform random numbers have to be employed.\nInteger arithmetic can be used to sample from the standard normal distribution. This method is exact in the sense that it satisfies the conditions of ideal approximation; i.e., it is equivalent to sampling a real number from the standard normal distribution and rounding this to the nearest representable floating point number.\nThere is also some investigation into the connection between the fast Hadamard transform and the normal distribution, since the transform employs just addition and subtraction and by the central limit theorem random numbers from almost any distribution will be transformed into the normal distribution. In this regard a series of Hadamard transforms can be combined with random permutations to turn arbitrary data sets into a normally distributed data.\n\n\nNumerical approximations for the normal cumulative distribution function and normal quantile function\nThe standard normal cumulative distribution function is widely used in scientific and statistical computing.\nThe values Φ(x) may be approximated very accurately by a variety of methods, such as numerical integration, Taylor series, asymptotic series and continued fractions. Different approximations are used depending on the desired level of accuracy.\n\nZelen & Severo (1964) give the approximation for Φ(x) for x > 0 with the absolute error |ε(x)| < 7.5·10−8 (algorithm 26.2.17): \n  \n    \n      \n        Φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        1\n        −\n        φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              b\n              \n                1\n              \n            \n            t\n            +\n            \n              b\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              t\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              b\n              \n                3\n              \n            \n            \n              t\n              \n                3\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              b\n              \n                4\n              \n            \n            \n              t\n              \n                4\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              b\n              \n                5\n              \n            \n            \n              t\n              \n                5\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        +\n        ε\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ,\n        \n        t\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              1\n              +\n              \n                b\n                \n                  0\n                \n              \n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Phi (x)=1-\\varphi (x)\\left(b_{1}t+b_{2}t^{2}+b_{3}t^{3}+b_{4}t^{4}+b_{5}t^{5}\\right)+\\varepsilon (x),\\qquad t={\\frac {1}{1+b_{0}x}},}\n  \n where ϕ(x) is the standard normal probability density function, and b0 = 0.2316419, b1 = 0.319381530, b2 = −0.356563782, b3 = 1.781477937, b4 = −1.821255978, b5 = 1.330274429.\nHart (1968) lists some dozens of approximations – by means of rational functions, with or without exponentials – for the erfc() function. His algorithms vary in the degree of complexity and the resulting precision, with maximum absolute precision of 24 digits. An algorithm by West (2009) combines Hart's algorithm 5666 with a continued fraction approximation in the tail to provide a fast computation algorithm with a 16-digit precision.\nCody (1969) after recalling Hart68 solution is not suited for erf, gives a solution for both erf and erfc, with maximal relative error bound, via Rational Chebyshev Approximation.\nMarsaglia (2004) suggested a simple algorithm based on the Taylor series expansion \n  \n    \n      \n        Φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n          (\n          \n            x\n            +\n            \n              \n                \n                  x\n                  \n                    3\n                  \n                \n                3\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              \n                \n                  x\n                  \n                    5\n                  \n                \n                \n                  3\n                  ⋅\n                  5\n                \n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              \n                \n                  x\n                  \n                    7\n                  \n                \n                \n                  3\n                  ⋅\n                  5\n                  ⋅\n                  7\n                \n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              \n                \n                  x\n                  \n                    9\n                  \n                \n                \n                  3\n                  ⋅\n                  5\n                  ⋅\n                  7\n                  ⋅\n                  9\n                \n              \n            \n            +\n            ⋯\n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Phi (x)={\\frac {1}{2}}+\\varphi (x)\\left(x+{\\frac {x^{3}}{3}}+{\\frac {x^{5}}{3\\cdot 5}}+{\\frac {x^{7}}{3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7}}+{\\frac {x^{9}}{3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7\\cdot 9}}+\\cdots \\right)}\n  \n for calculating Φ(x) with arbitrary precision.

Gauss used M, M′, M″, ... to denote the measurements of some unknown quantity V, and sought the most probable estimator of that quantity: the one that maximizes the probability φ(M − V) · φ(M′ − V) · φ(M″ − V) · ... of obtaining the observed experimental results. In his notation φΔ is the probability density function of the measurement errors of magnitude Δ. Not knowing what the function φ is, Gauss requires that his method should reduce to the well-known answer: the arithmetic mean of the measured values. Starting from these principles, Gauss demonstrates that the only law that rationalizes the choice of arithmetic mean as an estimator of the location parameter, is the normal law of errors:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        φ\n        \n          \n            Δ\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            h\n            \n              √\n              π\n            \n          \n        \n        \n        \n          e\n          \n            −\n            \n              h\n              h\n            \n            Δ\n            Δ\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi {\\mathit {\\Delta }}={\\frac {h}{\\surd \\pi }}\\,e^{-\\mathrm {hh} \\Delta \\Delta },}\n  \n \nwhere h is \"the measure of the precision of the observations\". Using this normal law as a generic model for errors in the experiments, Gauss formulates what is now known as the non-linear weighted least squares method.\n\nAlthough Gauss was the first to suggest the normal distribution law, Laplace made significant contributions. It was Laplace who first posed the problem of aggregating several observations in 1774, although his own solution led to the Laplacian distribution. It was Laplace who first calculated the value of the integral ∫ e−t2 dt = √π in 1782, providing the normalization constant for the normal distribution. For this accomplishment, Gauss acknowledged the priority of Laplace. Finally, it was Laplace who in 1810 proved and presented to the academy the fundamental central limit theorem, which emphasized the theoretical importance of the normal distribution.\nIt is of interest to note that in 1809 an Irish-American mathematician Robert Adrain published two insightful but flawed derivations of the normal probability law, simultaneously and independently from Gauss. His works remained largely unnoticed by the scientific community, until in 1871 they were exhumed by Abbe.\nIn the middle of the 19th century Maxwell demonstrated that the normal distribution is not just a convenient mathematical tool, but may also occur in natural phenomena: The number of particles whose velocity, resolved in a certain direction, lies between x and x + dx is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        ⁡\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              α\n              \n              \n                \n                  π\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n        \n          e\n          \n            −\n            \n              \n                \n                  x\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \n                  α\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n        d\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {N} {\\frac {1}{\\alpha \\;{\\sqrt {\\pi }}}}\\;e^{-{\\frac {x^{2}}{\\alpha ^{2}}}}\\,dx}\n  \n \n\n\nNaming\nToday, the concept is usually known in English as the normal distribution or Gaussian distribution.  Other less common names include Gauss distribution, Laplace–Gauss distribution, the law of error, the law of facility of errors, Laplace's second law, and Gaussian law.\nGauss himself apparently coined the term with reference to the \"normal equations\" involved in its applications, with normal having its technical meaning of orthogonal rather than usual. However, by the end of the 19th century some authors had started using the name normal distribution, where the word \"normal\" was used as an adjective – the term now being seen as a reflection of this distribution being seen as typical, common – and thus normal. Peirce (one of those authors) once defined \"normal\" thus: \"... the 'normal' is not the average (or any other kind of mean) of what actually occurs, but of what would, in the long run, occur under certain circumstances.\" Around the turn of the 20th century Pearson popularized the term normal as a designation for this distribution.\n\nMany years ago I called the Laplace–Gaussian curve the normal curve, which name, while it avoids an international question of priority, has the disadvantage of leading people to believe that all other distributions of frequency are in one sense or another 'abnormal'. \nAlso, it was Pearson who first wrote the distribution in terms of the standard deviation σ as in modern notation. Soon after this, in year 1915, Fisher added the location parameter to the formula for normal distribution, expressing it in the way it is written nowadays:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        f\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              2\n              \n                σ\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              π\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          e\n          \n            −\n            (\n            x\n            −\n            m\n            \n              )\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              /\n            \n            (\n            2\n            \n              σ\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            )\n          \n        \n        \n        d\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle df={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {2\\sigma ^{2}\\pi }}}e^{-(x-m)^{2}/(2\\sigma ^{2})}\\,dx.}\n  \n\nThe term standard normal distribution, which denotes the normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance came into general use around the 1950s, appearing in the popular textbooks by P.
