Squares are special cases of rectangles, which have four equal angles, and of rhombuses, which have four equal sides. As with all rectangles, a square's angles are right angles (90 degrees, or π/2 radians), making adjacent sides perpendicular. The area of a square is the side length multiplied by itself, and so in algebra, multiplying a number by itself is called squaring.\nEqual squares can tile the plane edge-to-edge in the square tiling. Square tilings are ubiquitous in tiled floors and walls, graph paper, image pixels, and game boards. Square shapes are also often seen in building floor plans, origami paper, food servings, in graphic design and heraldry, and in instant photos and fine art.\nThe formula for the area of a square forms the basis of the calculation of area and motivates the search for methods for squaring the circle by compass and straightedge, now known to be impossible. Squares can be inscribed in any smooth or convex curve, such as a circle or triangle, but it remains unsolved whether a square can be inscribed in every simple closed curve. Several problems of squaring the square involve subdividing squares into unequal squares. Mathematicians have also studied packing squares as tightly as possible into other shapes.\nSquares can be constructed by straightedge and compass, through their Cartesian coordinates, or by repeated multiplication by \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n  \n in the complex plane. They form the metric balls for taxicab geometry and Chebyshev distance, two forms of non-Euclidean geometry. Although spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry both lack polygons with four equal sides and right angles, they have square-like regular polygons with four sides and other angles, or with right angles and different numbers of sides.\n\n\nDefinitions and characterizations\n\nSquares can be defined or characterized in many equivalent ways. If a polygon in the Euclidean plane satisfies any one of the following criteria, it satisfies all of them:\n\nA square is a polygon with four equal sides and four right angles; that is, it is a quadrilateral that is both a rhombus and a rectangle\nA square is a rectangle with four equal sides.\nA square is a rhombus with a right angle between a pair of adjacent sides.\nA square is a rhombus with all angles equal.\nA square is a parallelogram with one right angle and two adjacent equal sides.\nA square is a  quadrilateral where the diagonals are equal, and are the perpendicular bisectors of each other.

One parameter (typically the length of a side or diagonal) suffices to specify a square's size. Squares of the same size are congruent.\n\n\nMeasurement\n\nA square whose four sides have length \n  \n    \n      \n        ℓ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ell }\n  \n has perimeter \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        =\n        4\n        ℓ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P=4\\ell }\n  \n and diagonal length \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        =\n        \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ℓ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d={\\sqrt {2}}\\ell }\n  \n. The square root of 2, appearing in this formula, is irrational, meaning that it cannot be written exactly as a fraction. It is approximately equal to 1.414, and its approximate value was already known in Babylonian mathematics. A square's area is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        \n          ℓ\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          d\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A=\\ell ^{2}={\\tfrac {1}{2}}d^{2}.}\n  \n\nThis formula for the area of a square as the second power of its side length led to the use of the term squaring to mean raising any number to the second power. Reversing this relation, the side length of a square of a given area is the square root of the area. Squaring an integer, or taking the area of a square with integer sides, results in a square number; these are figurate numbers representing the numbers of points that can be arranged into a square grid.\nSince four squared equals sixteen, a four by four square has an area equal to its perimeter. That is, it is an equable shape. The only other equable integer rectangle is a three-by-six rectangle.\nBecause it is a regular polygon, a square is the quadrilateral of least perimeter enclosing a given area. Dually, a square is the quadrilateral containing the largest area within a given perimeter.  Indeed, if A and P are the area and perimeter enclosed by a quadrilateral, then the following isoperimetric inequality holds:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        16\n        A\n        ≤\n        \n          P\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 16A\\leq P^{2}}\n  \n\nwith equality if and only if the quadrilateral is a square.\n\n\nSymmetry\n\nThe square is the most symmetrical of the quadrilaterals.  Eight rigid transformations of the plane take the square to itself:\n\nFor an axis-parallel square centered at the origin, each symmetry acts by a combination of negating and swapping the Cartesian coordinates of points.\nThe symmetries permute the eight isosceles triangles between the half-edges and the square's center (which stays in place); any of these triangles can be taken as the fundamental region of the transformations. Each two vertices, each two edges, and each two half-edges are mapped one to the other by at least one symmetry (exactly one for half-edges). All regular polygons also have these properties, which are expressed by saying that symmetries of a square and, more generally, a regular polygon act transitively on vertices and edges, and simply transitively on half-edges.\nCombining any two of these transformations by performing one after the other continues to take the square to itself, and therefore produces another symmetry. Repeated rotation produces another rotation with the summed rotation angle. Two reflections with the same axis return to the identity transformation, while two reflections with different axes rotate the square. A rotation followed by a reflection, or vice versa, produces a different reflection. This composition operation gives the eight symmetries of a square the mathematical structure of a group, called the group of the square or the dihedral group of order eight. Other quadrilaterals, like the rectangle and rhombus, have only a subgroup of these symmetries.\n\nThe shape of a square, but not its size, is preserved by similarities of the plane. Other kinds of transformations of the plane can take squares to other kinds of quadrilateral. An affine transformation can take a square to any parallelogram, or vice versa; a projective transformation can take a square to any convex quadrilateral, or vice versa. This implies that, when viewed in perspective, a square can look like any convex quadrilateral, or vice versa. A Möbius transformation can take the vertices of a square (but not its edges) to the vertices of a harmonic quadrilateral.\nThe wallpaper groups are symmetry groups of two-dimensional repeating patterns. For many of these groups the basic unit of repetition (the unit cell of its period lattice) can be a square, and for three of these groups, p4, p4m, and p4g, it must be a square.\n\n\nInscribed and circumscribed circles\n\nThe inscribed circle of a square is the largest circle that can fit inside that square. Its center is the center point of the square, and its radius (the inradius of the square) is \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n        =\n        ℓ\n        \n          /\n        \n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r=\\ell /2}\n  \n. Because this circle touches all four sides of the square (at their midpoints), the square is a tangential quadrilateral. The circumscribed circle of a square passes through all four vertices, making the square a cyclic quadrilateral. Its radius, the circumradius, is \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n        =\n        ℓ\n        \n          /\n        \n        \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R=\\ell /{\\sqrt {2}}}\n  \n.

four, referring to the four corners of a square tile. Graph paper, preprinted with a square tiling, is widely used for data visualization using Cartesian coordinates. The pixels of bitmap images, as recorded by image scanners and digital cameras or displayed on electronic visual displays, conventionally lie at the intersections of a square grid, and are often considered as small squares, arranged in a square tiling. Standard techniques for image compression and video compression, including the JPEG format, are based on the subdivision of images into larger square blocks of pixels. The quadtree data structure used in data compression and computational geometry is based on the recursive subdivision of squares into smaller squares.\n\nArchitectural structures from both ancient and modern cultures have featured a square floor plan, base, or footprint. Ancient examples include the Egyptian pyramids, Mesoamerican pyramids such as those at Teotihuacan, the Chogha Zanbil ziggurat in Iran, the four-fold design of Persian walled gardens, said to model the four rivers of Paradise,\nand later structures inspired by their design such as the Taj Mahal in India, the square bases of Buddhist stupas, and East Asian pagodas, buildings that symbolically face to the four points of the compass and reach to the heavens. Norman keeps such as the Tower of London often take the form of a low square tower. In modern architecture, a majority of skyscrapers feature a square plan for pragmatic rather than aesthetic or symbolic reasons.\n\nThe stylized nested squares of a Tibetan mandala, like the design of a stupa, function as a miniature model of the cosmos. Some formats for film photography use a square aspect ratio, notably Polaroid cameras, medium format cameras, and Instamatic cameras. Painters known for their frequent and prominent use of square forms and frames include Josef Albers, Kazimir Malevich Piet Mondrian, and Theo van Doesburg.\nBaseball diamonds and boxing rings are square despite being named for other shapes. In the quadrille and square dance, four couples form the sides of a square. In Samuel Beckett's minimalist television play Quad, four actors walk along the sides and diagonals of a square.\n\nThe square go board is said to represent the earth, with the 361 crossings of its lines representing days of the year. The chessboard inherited its square shape from a pachisi-like Indian race game and in turn passed it on to checkers. In two ancient games from Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, the Royal Game of Ur and Senet, the game board itself is not square, but rectangular, subdivided into a grid of squares. The ancient Greek Ostomachion puzzle (according to some interpretations) involves rearranging the pieces of a square cut into smaller polygons, as does the Chinese tangram. Another set of puzzle pieces, the polyominos, are formed from squares glued edge-to-edge; in this context, a single square is called a monomino. Medieval and Renaissance horoscopes were arranged in a square format, across Europe, the Middle East, and China. Other recreational uses of squares include the shape of origami paper, and a common style of quilting involving the use of square quilt blocks. Scrabble players place square lettered tiles onto a grid of \n  \n    \n      \n        15\n        ×\n        15\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 15\\times 15}\n  \n squares on a square board.\n\nSquares are a common element of graphic design, used to give a sense of stability, symmetry, and order. In heraldry, a canton (a design element in the top left of a shield) is normally square, and a square flag is called a banner. The flag of Switzerland is square, as are the flags of the Swiss cantons. QR codes are square and feature prominent nested square alignment marks in three corners. Robertson screws have a square drive socket. Crackers and sliced cheese are often square, as are waffles. Square foods named for their square shapes include caramel squares, date squares, lemon squares, square sausage, and Carré de l'Est cheese.\nIn stereochemistry, a square planar molecular geometry is a chemical structure with atoms at the corners of a square. An example is xenon tetrafluoride.\n\n\nConstructions\n\n\nCoordinates and equations\n\nA unit square is a square of side length one.

The Gaussian integers, complex numbers with integer real and imaginary parts, form a square lattice in the complex plane.\n\n\nCompass and straightedge\nThe construction of a square with a given side, using a compass and straightedge, is given in Euclid's Elements I.46. The existence of this construction means that squares are constructible polygons.

A truncated square is an octagon. The square belongs to a family of regular polytopes that includes the cube in three dimensions and the hypercubes in higher dimensions, and to another family that includes the regular octahedron in three dimensions and the cross-polytopes in higher dimensions. The cube and hypercubes can be given vertex coordinates that are all \n  \n    \n      \n        ±\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pm 1}\n  \n, giving an axis-parallel square in two dimensions, while the octahedron and cross-polytopes have one coordinate \n  \n    \n      \n        ±\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pm 1}\n  \n and the rest zero, giving a diagonal square in two dimensions. As with squares, the symmetries of these shapes can be obtained by applying a signed permutation to their coordinates.\nThe Sierpiński carpet is a square fractal, with square holes. Space-filling curves including the Hilbert curve, Peano curve, and Sierpiński curve cover a square as the continuous image of a line segment. The Z-order curve is analogous but not continuous. Other mathematical functions associated with squares include Arnold's cat map and the baker's map, which generate chaotic dynamical systems on a square, and the lemniscate elliptic functions, complex functions periodic on a square grid.\n\nThe Finsler–Hadwiger theorem states that for two squares \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        B\n        C\n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ABCD}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          B\n          ′\n        \n        \n          C\n          ′\n        \n        \n          D\n          ′\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle AB'C'D'}\n  \n, the center of both squares and the midpoint of \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n        \n          D\n          ′\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle BD'}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          B\n          ′\n        \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B'D}\n  \n form a third square. This theorem can be applied repeatedly to prove van Aubel's theorem, that the centers of four squares constructed on the sides of a quadrilateral form a midsquare quadrilateral. A square cannot be dissected into an odd number of equal-area triangles, a result of Monsky's theorem.\nMinkowski–Bouligand dimension or box-counting dimension involves squares to determine the fractal dimension of a set in Euclidean space or metric space, the squares are named \"boxes\". The fractal dimension of a set is attainable by lying on an evenly spaced grid and counting the number of squares required to cover the set. The method of box counting is used when the grid is finer.\nMathematical puzzles that include squares are square arrays that are filled with numbers in Sudoku with generalized symbols in Latin square, and with color or blank in nonogram, as well as paradoxical optical illusions such as the missing square puzzle and the chessboard paradox. The Langton's ant, in cellular automaton, is a two-dimensional square lattice consisting of a black-or-white colored grid wherein an ant assigns the combination of those colors and its current direction of motion.\n\n\nInscribed squares\n\nA square is inscribed in a curve when all four vertices of the square lie on the curve. The unsolved inscribed square problem asks whether every simple closed curve has an inscribed square. It is true for every smooth curve, and for any closed convex curve. The only other regular polygon that can always be inscribed in every closed convex curve is the equilateral triangle, as there exists a convex curve on which no other regular polygon can be inscribed.\nFor an inscribed square in a triangle, at least one side of the square lies on a side of the triangle. Every acute triangle has three inscribed squares, one for each of its three sides. A right triangle has two inscribed squares, one touching its right angle and the other lying on its hypotenuse. An obtuse triangle has only one inscribed square, on its longest side. A square inscribed in a triangle can cover at most half the triangle's area.\n\n\nArea and quadrature\n\nSince ancient times, many units for surface area have been defined from squares, typically with a standard unit of length as its side, for example, a square meter or square inch.\nIn ancient Greek deductive geometry, the area of a planar shape was measured and compared by constructing a square with the same area by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge, a process called quadrature or squaring. Euclid's Elements shows how to do this for rectangles, parallelograms, triangles, and then more generally for simple polygons by breaking them into triangular pieces. Some shapes with curved sides could also be squared, such as the lune of Hippocrates and the parabola.\nThis use of a square as the defining shape for area measurement also occurs in the Greek formulation of the Pythagorean theorem: squares constructed on the two sides of a right triangle have equal total area to a square constructed on the hypotenuse. Stated in this form, the theorem would be equally valid for other shapes on the sides of the triangle, such as equilateral triangles or semicircles, but the Greeks used squares. In modern mathematics, this formulation of the theorem using areas of squares has been replaced by an algebraic formulation involving squaring numbers: the lengths of the sides and hypotenuse of the right triangle obey the equation \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}\n  \n.\nBecause of this focus on quadrature as a measure of area, the Greeks and later mathematicians sought unsuccessfully to square the circle, constructing a square with the same area as a given circle, again using finitely many steps with a compass and straightedge. In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible as a consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem. This theorem proves that pi (π) is a transcendental number rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. A construction for squaring the circle could be translated into a polynomial formula for π, which does not exist. In philosophy, the concept of a \"square circle\" has been used as an example of an oxymoron since Aristotle, sparking attempts to find contexts such as taxicab geometry (below) in which this phrase is meaningful.\n\n\nTiling and packing\n\nThe square tiling, familiar from flooring and game boards, is one of three regular tilings of the plane. The other two use the equilateral triangle and the regular hexagon. The vertices of a square tiling form a square lattice. Squares of more than one size can also tile the plane, for instance in the Pythagorean tiling, named for its connection to proofs of the Pythagorean theorem. \n\nSquare packing problems seek the smallest square or circle into which a given number of unit squares can fit. A chessboard optimally packs a square number of unit squares into a larger square, but beyond a few special cases such as this, the optimal solutions to these problems remain unsolved; the same is true for circle packing in a square. Packing squares into other shapes can have high computational complexity: testing whether a given number of unit squares can fit into an orthogonally convex rectilinear polygon with half-integer vertex coordinates is NP-complete.\nSquaring the square involves subdividing a given square into smaller squares, all having integer side lengths. A subdivision with distinct smaller squares is called a perfect squared square. Another variant of squaring the square called \"Mrs. Perkins's quilt\" allows repetitions, but uses as few smaller squares as possible in order to make the greatest common divisor of the side lengths be 1. The entire plane can be tiled by squares, with exactly one square of each integer side length.\n\nIn higher dimensions, other surfaces than the plane can be tiled by equal squares, meeting edge-to-edge. One of these surfaces is the Clifford torus, the four-dimensional Cartesian product of two congruent circles; it has the same intrinsic geometry as a single square with each pair of opposite edges glued together. Another square-tiled surface, a regular skew apeirohedron in three dimensions, has six squares meeting at each vertex. The paper bag problem seeks the maximum volume that can be enclosed by a surface tiled with two squares glued edge to edge; its exact answer is unknown. Gluing two squares in a different pattern, with the vertex of each square attached to the midpoint of an edge of the other square (or alternatively subdividing these two squares into eight squares glued edge-to-edge) produces a pincushion shape called a biscornu. The surfaces tiled with finitely many squares of the three-dimensional integer lattice are called polyominoids.\n\n\nCounting\n\nA common mathematical puzzle involves counting the squares of all sizes in a square grid of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        ×\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n\\times n}\n  \n squares. For instance, a square grid of nine squares has 14 squares: the nine squares that form the grid, four more \n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        ×\n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2\\times 2}\n  \n squares, and one \n  \n    \n      \n        3\n        ×\n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 3\\times 3}\n  \n square.

For instance, a grid of nine points has five axis-parallel squares as described above, but it also contains one more diagonal square for a total of six.

A square can be divided into two similar rectangles only in one way, by bisecting it, but when dividing a square into three similar rectangles there are three possible aspect ratios of the rectangles, 3:1, 3:2, and the square of the plastic ratio, approximately 1.755:1.

By contrast, in spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, space is curved and the internal angles of a convex quadrilateral never sum to 360°, so quadrilaterals with four right angles do not exist. Both of these geometries feature regular quadrilaterals, characterized by four equal sides and four equal angles, often referred to as squares, although some authors prefer to avoid this name because they lack right angles. These geometries also feature regular polygons with right angles, but with the number of sides differing from four.\nIn spherical geometry, space has uniform positive curvature, and every convex quadrilateral (a polygon with four great-circle arc edges) has angles whose sum exceeds 360° by an amount called the angular excess, proportional to its surface area. Small spherical squares are approximately Euclidean, and the angles of larger squares increase with area. One special case is the face of a spherical cube with four 120° angles, covering one sixth of the sphere's surface. Another is a hemisphere, the face of a spherical square dihedron, with four straight angles; the Peirce quincuncial projection for world maps conformally maps two such faces to Euclidean squares. An octant of a sphere is a regular spherical triangle, with three equal sides and three right angles; eight of them tile the sphere, with four meeting at each vertex, to form a spherical octahedron. A spherical lune is a regular digon, with two semicircular sides and two equal angles at antipodal vertices; a right-angled lune covers one quarter of the sphere, one face of a four-lune hosohedron.\nIn hyperbolic geometry, space has uniform negative curvature, and every convex quadrilateral has angles whose sum falls short of 360° by an amount called the angular defect, proportional to its surface area. Small hyperbolic squares are approximately Euclidean, and larger squares decrease with increasing area. Special cases include the squares with angles of 360°/n for every value of n larger than 4, each of which can tile the hyperbolic plane. In the infinite limit, an ideal square has four sides of infinite length and four vertices at ideal points outside the hyperbolic plane, with 0° internal angles; an ideal square, like every ideal quadrilateral, has finite area proportional to its angular defect of 360°. It is also possible to make a regular hyperbolic polygon with right angles at every vertex and any number of sides greater than four; such polygons can uniformly tile the hyperbolic plane, dual to the tiling with n squares about each vertex.\n\nThe Euclidean plane can be defined in terms of the real coordinate plane by adoption of the Euclidean distance function, according to which the distance between any two points \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{2},y_{2})}\n  \n is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              (\n              \n                x\n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n              −\n              \n                x\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \n                )\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              +\n              (\n              \n                y\n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n              −\n              \n                y\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \n                )\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\sqrt {(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}+(y_{1}-y_{2})^{2}}}}\n  \n.
