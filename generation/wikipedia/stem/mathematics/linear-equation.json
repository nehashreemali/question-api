The coefficients may be considered as parameters of the equation and may be arbitrary expressions, provided they do not contain any of the variables. To yield a meaningful equation, the coefficients \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        \n          a\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a_{1},\\ldots ,a_{n}}\n  \n are required to not all be zero.\nAlternatively, a linear equation can be obtained by equating to zero a linear polynomial over some field, from which the coefficients are taken.\nThe solutions of such an equation are the values that, when substituted for the unknowns, make the equality true.\nIn the case of just one variable, there is exactly one solution (provided that \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ≠\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a_{1}\\neq 0}\n  \n). Often, the term linear equation refers implicitly to this particular case, in which the variable is sensibly called the unknown.\nIn the case of two variables, each solution may be interpreted as the Cartesian coordinates of a point of the Euclidean plane. The solutions of a linear equation form a line in the Euclidean plane, and, conversely, every line can be viewed as the set of all solutions of a linear equation in two variables. This is the origin of the term linear for describing this type of equation. More generally, the solutions of a linear equation in n variables form a hyperplane (a subspace of dimension n − 1) in the Euclidean space of dimension n.\nLinear equations occur frequently in all mathematics and their applications in physics and engineering, partly because non-linear systems are often well approximated by linear equations.\nThis article considers the case of a single equation with coefficients from the field of real numbers, for which one studies the real solutions. All of its content applies to complex solutions and, more generally, to linear equations with coefficients and solutions in any field. For the case of several simultaneous linear equations, see system of linear equations.\n\n\nOne variable\nA linear equation in one variable x can be written as \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        x\n        +\n        b\n        =\n        0\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ax+b=0,}\n  \n with \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        ≠\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a\\neq 0}\n  \n. \nThe solution is \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        −\n        \n          \n            b\n            a\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=-{\\frac {b}{a}}}\n  \n.\n\n\nTwo variables\nA linear equation in two variables x and y can be written as \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        x\n        +\n        b\n        y\n        +\n        c\n        =\n        0\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ax+by+c=0,}\n  \n where a and  b are not both 0.\nIf a and b are real numbers, it has infinitely many solutions.\n\n\nLinear function\n\nIf b ≠ 0, the equation \n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        x\n        +\n        b\n        y\n        +\n        c\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ax+by+c=0}\n  \n\nis a linear equation in the single variable y for every value of x. It therefore has a unique solution for y, which is given by \n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        −\n        \n          \n            a\n            b\n          \n        \n        x\n        −\n        \n          \n            c\n            b\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=-{\\frac {a}{b}}x-{\\frac {c}{b}}.}\n  \n\nThis defines a function. The graph of this function is a line with slope \n  \n    \n      \n        −\n        \n          \n            a\n            b\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle -{\\frac {a}{b}}}\n  \n and y-intercept \n  \n    \n      \n        −\n        \n          \n            c\n            b\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle -{\\frac {c}{b}}.}\n  \n The functions whose graph is a line are generally called linear functions in the context of calculus. However, in linear algebra, a linear function is a function that maps a sum to the sum of the images of the summands. So, for this definition, the above function is linear only when c = 0, that is when the line passes through the origin. To avoid confusion, the functions whose graph is an arbitrary line are often called affine functions, and the linear functions such that c = 0 are often called linear maps.\n\n\nGeometric interpretation\n\nEach solution (x, y) of a linear equation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        x\n        +\n        b\n        y\n        +\n        c\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ax+by+c=0}\n  \n\nmay be viewed as the Cartesian coordinates of a point in the Euclidean plane. With this interpretation, all solutions of the equation form a line, provided that a and b are not both zero. Conversely, every line is the set of all solutions of a linear equation.\nThe phrase \"linear equation\" takes its origin in this correspondence between lines and equations: a linear equation in two variables is an equation whose solutions form a line.\nIf b ≠ 0, the line is the graph of the function of x that has been defined in the preceding section. If b = 0, the line is a vertical line (that is a line parallel to the y-axis) of equation \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        −\n        \n          \n            c\n            a\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=-{\\frac {c}{a}},}\n  \n which is not the graph of a function of x.\nSimilarly, if a ≠ 0, the line is the graph of a function of y, and, if a = 0, one has a horizontal line of equation \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        −\n        \n          \n            c\n            b\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=-{\\frac {c}{b}}.}\n  \n\n\nEquation of a line\nThere are various ways of defining a line. In the following subsections, a linear equation of the line is given in each case.\n\n\nSlope–intercept form or Gradient-intercept form\nA non-vertical line can be defined by its slope m, and its y-intercept y0 (the y coordinate of its intersection with the y-axis). In this case, its linear equation can be written \n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        m\n        x\n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=mx+y_{0}.}\n  \n\nIf, moreover, the line is not horizontal, it can be defined by its slope and its x-intercept x0. In this case, its equation can be written\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        m\n        (\n        x\n        −\n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=m(x-x_{0}),}\n  \n\nor, equivalently,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        m\n        x\n        −\n        m\n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=mx-mx_{0}.}\n  \n\nThese forms rely on the habit of considering a nonvertical line as the graph of a function.

If every variable has a zero coefficient, then, as mentioned for one variable, the equation is either inconsistent (for b ≠ 0) as having no solution, or all n-tuples are solutions.\nThe n-tuples that are solutions of a linear equation in n variables are the Cartesian coordinates of the points of an (n − 1)-dimensional hyperplane in an n-dimensional Euclidean space (or affine space if the coefficients are complex numbers or belong to any field). In the case of three variables, this hyperplane is a plane.\nIf a linear equation is given with aj ≠ 0, then the equation can be solved for xj, yielding \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        −\n        \n          \n            b\n            \n              a\n              \n                j\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          ∑\n          \n            i\n            ∈\n            {\n            1\n            ,\n            …\n            ,\n            n\n            }\n            ,\n            i\n            ≠\n            j\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n            \n              a\n              \n                j\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{j}=-{\\frac {b}{a_{j}}}-\\sum _{i\\in \\{1,\\ldots ,n\\},i\\neq j}{\\frac {a_{i}}{a_{j}}}x_{i}.}\n  \n\nIf the coefficients are real numbers, this defines a real-valued function of n real variables.\n\n\nSee also\nLinear equation over a ring\nAlgebraic equation\nLine coordinates\nLinear inequality\nNonlinear equation\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nBarnett, R.A.; Ziegler, M.R.; Byleen, K.E.
