More precisely, one can be obtained from the other by uniformly scaling (enlarging or reducing), possibly with additional translation, rotation and reflection. This means that either object can be rescaled, repositioned, and reflected, so as to coincide precisely with the other object. If two objects are similar, each is congruent to the result of a particular uniform scaling of the other.\n\nFor example, all circles are similar to each other, all squares are similar to each other, and all equilateral triangles are similar to each other. On the other hand, ellipses are not all similar to each other, rectangles are not all similar to each other, and isosceles triangles are not all similar to each other. This is because two ellipses can have different width to height ratios, two rectangles can have different length to breadth ratios, and two isosceles triangles can have different base angles. \n\nIf two angles of a triangle have measures equal to the measures of two angles of another triangle, then the triangles are similar. Corresponding sides of similar polygons are in proportion, and corresponding angles of similar polygons have the same measure.\nTwo congruent shapes are similar, with a scale factor of 1. However, some school textbooks specifically exclude congruent triangles from their definition of similar triangles by insisting that the sizes must be different if the triangles are to qualify as similar.\n\n\nSimilar triangles\nTwo triangles, △ABC and △A'B'C' are similar if and only if corresponding angles have the same measure: this implies that they are similar if and only if the lengths of corresponding sides are proportional. It can be shown that two triangles having congruent angles (equiangular triangles) are similar, that is, the corresponding sides can be proved to be proportional. This is known as the AAA similarity theorem. Note that the \"AAA\" is a mnemonic: each one of the three A's refers to an \"angle\". Due to this theorem, several authors simplify the definition of similar triangles to only require that the corresponding three angles are congruent.\nThere are several criteria each of which is necessary and sufficient for two triangles to be similar:\n\nAny two pairs of angles are congruent, which in Euclidean geometry implies that all three angles are congruent:\nIf ∠BAC is equal in measure to ∠B'A'C', and ∠ABC is equal in measure to ∠A'B'C', then this implies that ∠ACB is equal in measure to ∠A'C'B' and the triangles are similar.\nAll the corresponding sides are proportional:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                A\n                B\n              \n              ¯\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  A\n                  ′\n                \n                \n                  B\n                  ′\n                \n              \n              ¯\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                B\n                C\n              \n              ¯\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  B\n                  ′\n                \n                \n                  C\n                  ′\n                \n              \n              ¯\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                A\n                C\n              \n              ¯\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  A\n                  ′\n                \n                \n                  C\n                  ′\n                \n              \n              ¯\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\overline {AB}}{\\overline {A'B'}}}={\\frac {\\overline {BC}}{\\overline {B'C'}}}={\\frac {\\overline {AC}}{\\overline {A'C'}}}.}\n  \n \n\nThis is equivalent to saying that one triangle (or its mirror image) is an enlargement of the other.\nAny two pairs of sides are proportional, and the angles included between these sides are congruent:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                A\n                B\n              \n              ¯\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  A\n                  ′\n                \n                \n                  B\n                  ′\n                \n              \n              ¯\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                B\n                C\n              \n              ¯\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  B\n                  ′\n                \n                \n                  C\n                  ′\n                \n              \n              ¯\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        ∠\n        A\n        B\n        C\n        ≅\n        ∠\n        \n          A\n          ′\n        \n        \n          B\n          ′\n        \n        \n          C\n          ′\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\overline {AB}}{\\overline {A'B'}}}={\\frac {\\overline {BC}}{\\overline {B'C'}}},\\quad \\angle ABC\\cong \\angle A'B'C'.}\n  \n\nThis is known as the SAS similarity criterion. The \"SAS\" is a mnemonic: each one of the two S's refers to a \"side\"; the A refers to an \"angle\" between the two sides.\nSymbolically, we write the similarity and dissimilarity of two triangles △ABC and △A'B'C' as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                △\n                A\n                B\n                C\n              \n              \n                \n                ∼\n                △\n                \n                  A\n                  ′\n                \n                \n                  B\n                  ′\n                \n                \n                  C\n                  ′\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                △\n                A\n                B\n                C\n              \n              \n                \n                ≁\n                △\n                \n                  A\n                  ′\n                \n                \n                  B\n                  ′\n                \n                \n                  C\n                  ′\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}\\triangle ABC&\\sim \\triangle A'B'C'\\\\\\triangle ABC&\\nsim \\triangle A'B'C'\\end{aligned}}}\n  \n\nThere are several elementary results concerning similar triangles in Euclidean geometry:\n\nAny two equilateral triangles are similar.\nTwo triangles, both similar to a third triangle, are similar to each other (transitivity of similarity of triangles).\nCorresponding altitudes of similar triangles have the same ratio as the corresponding sides.\nTwo right triangles are similar if the hypotenuse and one other side have lengths in the same ratio. There are several equivalent conditions in this case, such as the right triangles having an acute angle of the same measure, or having the lengths of the legs (sides) being in the same proportion.\nGiven a triangle △ABC and a line segment DE one can, with a ruler and compass, find a point F such that △ABC ~ △DEF. The statement that point F satisfying this condition exists is Wallis's postulate and is logically equivalent to Euclid's parallel postulate. In hyperbolic geometry (where Wallis's postulate is false) similar triangles are congruent.\nIn the axiomatic treatment of Euclidean geometry given by George David Birkhoff (see Birkhoff's axioms) the SAS similarity criterion given above was used to replace both Euclid's parallel postulate and the SAS axiom which enabled the dramatic shortening of Hilbert's axioms.\nSimilar triangles provide the basis for many synthetic (without the use of coordinates) proofs in Euclidean geometry. Among the elementary results that can be proved this way are: the angle bisector theorem, the geometric mean theorem, Ceva's theorem, Menelaus's theorem and the Pythagorean theorem. Similar triangles also provide the foundations for right triangle trigonometry.\n\n\nOther similar polygons\n\nThe concept of similarity extends to polygons with more than three sides. Given any two similar polygons, corresponding sides taken in the same sequence (even if clockwise for one polygon and counterclockwise for the other) are proportional and corresponding angles taken in the same sequence are equal in measure. However, proportionality of corresponding sides is not by itself sufficient to prove similarity for polygons beyond triangles (otherwise, for example, all rhombi would be similar). Likewise, equality of all angles in sequence is not sufficient to guarantee similarity (otherwise all rectangles would be similar). A sufficient condition for similarity of polygons is that corresponding sides and diagonals are proportional.\nFor given n, all regular n-gons are similar.\n\n\nSimilar curves\nSeveral types of curves have the property that all examples of that type are similar to each other. These include:\n\nLines (any two lines are even congruent)\nLine segments\nCircles\nParabolas\nHyperbolas of a specific eccentricity\nEllipses of a specific eccentricity\nCatenaries\nGraphs of the logarithm function for different bases\nGraphs of the exponential function for different bases\nLogarithmic spirals are self-similar\n\n\nIn Euclidean space\nA similarity (also called a similarity transformation or similitude) of a Euclidean space is a bijection f from the space onto itself that multiplies all distances by the same positive real number r, so that for any two points x and y we have\n\n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ,\n        f\n        (\n        y\n        )\n        )\n        =\n        r\n        \n        d\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d(f(x),f(y))=r\\,d(x,y),}\n  \n\nwhere d(x,y) is the Euclidean distance from x to y. The scalar r has many names in the literature including; the ratio of similarity, the stretching factor and the similarity coefficient. When r = 1 a similarity is called an isometry (rigid transformation). Two sets are called similar if one is the image of the other under a similarity.\nAs a map ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        →\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f:\\mathbb {R} ^{n}\\to \\mathbb {R} ^{n},}\n  \n⁠ a similarity of ratio r takes the form\n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        r\n        A\n        x\n        +\n        t\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=rAx+t,}\n  \n\nwhere ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        ∈\n        \n          O\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          R\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A\\in O^{n}(\\mathbb {R} )}\n  \n⁠ is an n × n orthogonal matrix and ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        t\n        ∈\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\n  \n⁠ is a translation vector.\nSimilarities preserve planes, lines, perpendicularity, parallelism, midpoints, inequalities between distances and line segments. Similarities preserve angles but do not necessarily preserve orientation, direct similitudes preserve orientation and opposite similitudes change it.\nThe similarities of Euclidean space form a group under the operation of composition called the similarities group S. The direct similitudes form a normal subgroup of S and the Euclidean group E(n) of isometries also forms a normal subgroup. The similarities group S is itself a subgroup of the affine group, so every similarity is an affine transformation.\nOne can view the Euclidean plane as the complex plane, that is, as a 2-dimensional space over the reals.

When |a|= 1, these similarities are isometries.\n\n\nArea ratio and volume ratio\n\nThe ratio between the areas of similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of corresponding lengths of those figures (for example, when the side of a square or the radius of a circle is multiplied by three, its area is multiplied by nine — i.e. by three squared). The altitudes of similar triangles are in the same ratio as corresponding sides. If a triangle has a side of length b and an altitude drawn to that side of length h then a similar triangle with corresponding side of length kb will have an altitude drawn to that side of length kh. The area of the first triangle is \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        b\n        h\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A={\\tfrac {1}{2}}bh,}\n  \n while the area of the similar triangle will be \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          ′\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        k\n        b\n        ⋅\n        k\n        h\n        =\n        \n          k\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        A\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A'={\\frac {1}{2}}\\cdot kb\\cdot kh=k^{2}A.}\n  \n\nSimilar figures which can be decomposed into similar triangles will have areas related in the same way. The relationship holds for figures that are not rectifiable as well.\nThe ratio between the volumes of similar figures is equal to the cube of the ratio of corresponding lengths of those figures (for example, when the edge of a cube or the radius of a sphere is multiplied by three, its volume is multiplied by 27 — i.e. by three cubed).\nGalileo's square–cube law concerns similar solids. If the ratio of similitude (ratio of corresponding sides) between the solids is k, then the ratio of surface areas of the solids will be k2, while the ratio of volumes will be k3.\n\n\nSimilarity with a center\n\nIf a similarity has exactly one invariant point: a point that the similarity keeps unchanged, then this only point is called \"center\" of the similarity.\nOn the first image below the title, on the left, one or another similarity shrinks a regular polygon into a concentric one, the vertices of which are each on a side of the previous polygon. This rotational reduction is repeated, so the initial polygon is extended into an abyss of regular polygons. The center of the similarity is the common center of the successive polygons. A red segment joins a vertex of the initial polygon to its image under the similarity, followed by a red segment going to the following image of vertex, and so on to form a spiral. Actually we can see more than three direct similarities on this first image, because every regular polygon is invariant under certain direct similarities, more precisely certain rotations the center of which is the center of the polygon, and a composition of direct similarities is also a direct similarity. For example we see the image of the initial regular pentagon under a homothety of negative ratio −k, which is a similarity of ±180° angle and a positive ratio equal to k.\nBelow the title on the right, the second image shows a similarity decomposed into a rotation and a homothety. Similarity and rotation have the same angle of +135 degrees modulo 360 degrees.

The similarity is a function such that its value is greater when two points are closer (contrary to the distance, which is a measure of dissimilarity: the closer the points, the lesser the distance).\nThe definition of the similarity can vary among authors, depending on which properties are desired.

This usage is not the same as the similarity transformation of the § In Euclidean space and § In general metric spaces sections of this article.\n\n\nSelf-similarity\nSelf-similarity means that a pattern is non-trivially similar to itself, e.g., the set {..., 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, ...}  of numbers of the form {2i, 3·2i}  where i ranges over all integers. When this set is plotted on a logarithmic scale it has one-dimensional translational symmetry: adding or subtracting the logarithm of two to the logarithm of one of these numbers produces the logarithm of another of these numbers. In the given set of numbers themselves, this corresponds to a similarity transformation in which the numbers are multiplied or divided by two.\n\n\nPsychology\n\nThe intuition for the notion of geometric similarity already appears in human children, as can be seen in their drawings. Certain perceptual categorization models in psychology are based on geometric similarity, assuming that learning involves the storage of specific instances (i.e. of general object specifications) in memory. The categorization of another object is subsequently based on the similarity of the object to the instances in memory.\n\n\nSee also\nBasic proportionality theorem\nHelmert transformation\nSpiral similarity\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nHenderson, David W.; Taimiņa, Daina (2005).
