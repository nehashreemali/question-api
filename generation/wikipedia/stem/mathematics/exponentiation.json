When n is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is, bn is the product of multiplying n bases:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                b\n                ×\n                b\n                ×\n                ⋯\n                ×\n                b\n                ×\n                b\n              \n              ⏟\n            \n          \n          \n            n\n            \n               times\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{n}=\\underbrace {b\\times b\\times \\dots \\times b\\times b} _{n{\\text{ times}}}.}\n  \nIn particular, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        =\n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{1}=b}\n  \n.\nThe exponent is usually shown as a superscript to the right of the base as bn or in computer code as b^n.

More involved definitions allow complex base and exponent, as well as certain types of matrices as base or exponent.\nExponentiation is used extensively in many fields, including economics, biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science, with applications such as compound interest, population growth, chemical reaction kinetics, wave behavior, and public-key cryptography.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe term exponent originates from the Latin exponentem, the present participle of exponere, meaning \"to put forth\". The term power (Latin: potentia, potestas, dignitas) is a mistranslation of the ancient Greek δύναμις (dúnamis, here: \"amplification\") used by the Greek mathematician Euclid for the square of a line, following Hippocrates of Chios.\nThe word exponent was coined in 1544 by Michael Stifel. In the 16th century, Robert Recorde used the terms \"square\", \"cube\", \"zenzizenzic\" (fourth power), \"sursolid\" (fifth), \"zenzicube\" (sixth), \"second sursolid\" (seventh), and \"zenzizenzizenzic\" (eighth). \"Biquadrate\" has been used to refer to the fourth power as well.\n\n\nHistory\nIn The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes proved the law of exponents, 10a · 10b = 10a+b, necessary to manipulate powers of 10. He then used powers of 10 to estimate the number of grains of sand that can be contained in the universe.\nIn the 9th century, the Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi used the terms مَال (māl, \"possessions\", \"property\") for a square—the Muslims, \"like most mathematicians of those and earlier times, thought of a squared number as a depiction of an area, especially of land, hence property\"—and كَعْبَة (Kaʿbah, \"cube\") for a cube, which later Islamic mathematicians represented in mathematical notation as the letters mīm (m) and kāf (k), respectively, by the 15th century, as seen in the work of Abu'l-Hasan ibn Ali al-Qalasadi.\nNicolas Chuquet used a form of exponential notation in the 15th century, for example 122 to represent 12x2. This was later used by Henricus Grammateus and Michael Stifel in the 16th century. In the late 16th century, Jost Bürgi would use Roman numerals for exponents in a way similar to that of Chuquet, for example iii4 for 4x3.\nIn 1636, James Hume used in essence modern notation, when in L'algèbre de Viète he wrote Aiii for A3. Early in the 17th century, the first form of our modern exponential notation was introduced by René Descartes in his text titled La Géométrie; there, the notation is introduced in Book I.\n\nI designate ... aa, or a2 in multiplying a by itself; and a3 in multiplying it once more again by a, and thus to infinity.\nSome mathematicians (such as Descartes) used exponents only for powers greater than two, preferring to represent squares as repeated multiplication. Thus they would write polynomials, for example, as ax + bxx + cx3 + d.\nSamuel Jeake introduced the term indices in 1696. The term involution was used synonymously with the term indices, but had declined in usage and should not be confused with its more common meaning.\n\nIn 1748, Leonhard Euler introduced variable exponents, and, implicitly, non-integer exponents by writing:Consider exponentials or powers in which the exponent itself is a variable. It is clear that quantities of this kind are not algebraic functions, since in those the exponents must be constant.\n\n\n20th century\nAs calculation was mechanized, notation was adapted to numerical capacity by conventions in exponential notation. For example Konrad Zuse introduced floating-point arithmetic in his 1938 computer Z1. One register contained representation of leading digits, and a second contained representation of the exponent of 10. Earlier Leonardo Torres Quevedo contributed Essays on Automation (1914) which had suggested the floating-point representation of numbers. The more flexible decimal floating-point representation was introduced in 1946 with a Bell Laboratories computer. Eventually educators and engineers adopted scientific notation of numbers, consistent with common reference to order of magnitude in a ratio scale.\nFor instance, in 1961 the School Mathematics Study Group developed the notation in connection with units used in the metric system.\nExponents also came to be used to describe units of measurement and quantity dimensions. For instance, since force is mass times acceleration, it is measured in kg m/sec2. Using M for mass, L for length, and T for time, the expression M L T–2 is used in dimensional analysis to describe force.\n\n\nTerminology\nThe expression b2 = b · b is called \"the square of b\" or \"b squared\", because the area of a square with side-length b is b2. (It is true that it could also be called \"b to the second power\", but \"the square of b\" and \"b squared\" are more traditional)\nSimilarly, the expression b3 = b · b · b is called \"the cube of b\" or \"b cubed\", because the volume of a cube with side-length b is b3.\nWhen an exponent is a positive integer, that exponent indicates how many copies of the base are multiplied together. For example, 35 = 3 · 3 · 3 · 3 · 3 = 243. The base 3 appears 5 times in the multiplication, because the exponent is 5. Here, 243 is the 5th power of 3, or 3 raised to the 5th power.\nThe word \"raised\" is usually omitted, and sometimes \"power\" as well, so 35 can be simply read \"3 to the 5th\", or \"3 to the 5\".\n\n\nInteger exponents\nThe exponentiation operation with integer exponents may be defined directly from elementary arithmetic operations.\n\n\nPositive exponents\nThe definition of the exponentiation as an iterated multiplication can be formalized by using induction, and this definition can be used as soon as one has an associative multiplication:\nThe base case is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        =\n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{1}=b}\n  \n\nand the recurrence is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            n\n            +\n            1\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          b\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        b\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{n+1}=b^{n}\\cdot b.}\n  \n\nThe associativity of multiplication implies that for any positive integers m and n,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            m\n            +\n            n\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          b\n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          b\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{m+n}=b^{m}\\cdot b^{n},}\n  \n\nand\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          b\n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          b\n          \n            m\n            n\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (b^{m})^{n}=b^{mn}.}\n  \n\n\nZero exponent\nAs mentioned earlier, a (nonzero) number raised to the 0 power is 1:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        1.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b^{0}=1.}\n  \n\nThis value is also obtained by the empty product convention, which may be used in every algebraic structure with a multiplication that has an identity.

Otherwise, if a and b are, say, square matrices of the same size, this formula cannot be used. It follows that in computer algebra, many algorithms involving integer exponents must be changed when the exponentiation bases do not commute. Some general purpose computer algebra systems use a different notation (sometimes ^^ instead of ^) for exponentiation with non-commuting bases, which is then called non-commutative exponentiation.\n\n\nCombinatorial interpretation\n\nFor nonnegative integers n and m, the value of nm is the number of functions from a set of m elements to a set of n elements (see cardinal exponentiation). Such functions can be represented as m-tuples from an n-element set (or as m-letter words from an n-letter alphabet). Some examples for particular values of m and n are given in the following table:\n\n\nParticular bases\n\n\nPowers of ten\n\nIn the base ten (decimal) number system, integer powers of 10 are written as the digit 1 followed or preceded by a number of zeroes determined by the sign and magnitude of the exponent. For example, 103 = 1000 and 10−4 = 0.0001.\nExponentiation with base 10 is used in scientific notation to denote large or small numbers. For instance, 299792458 m/s (the speed of light in vacuum, in metres per second) can be written as 2.99792458×108 m/s and then approximated as 2.998×108 m/s.\nSI prefixes based on powers of 10 are also used to describe small or large quantities. For example, the prefix kilo means 103 = 1000, so a kilometre is 1000 m.\n\n\nPowers of two\n\nThe first negative powers of 2 have special names: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            −\n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{-1}}\n  \nis a half; \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            −\n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{-2}}\n  \n is a quarter.\nPowers of 2 appear in set theory, since a set with n members has a power set, the set of all of its subsets, which has 2n members.\nInteger powers of 2 are important in computer science. The positive integer powers 2n give the number of possible values for an n-bit integer binary number; for example, a byte may take 28 = 256 different values. The binary number system expresses any number as a sum of powers of 2, and denotes it as a sequence of 0 and 1, separated by a binary point, where 1 indicates a power of 2 that appears in the sum; the exponent is determined by the place of this 1: the nonnegative exponents are the rank of the 1 on the left of the point (starting from 0), and the negative exponents are determined by the rank on the right of the point.\n\n\nPowers of one\nEvery power of one equals: 1n = 1.\n\n\nPowers of zero\nFor a positive exponent n > 0, the nth power of zero is zero: 0n = 0.

The result is always a positive real number, and the identities and properties shown above for integer exponents remain true with these definitions for real exponents. The second definition is more commonly used, since it generalizes straightforwardly to complex exponents.\nOn the other hand, exponentiation to a real power of a negative real number is much more difficult to define consistently, as it may be non-real and have several values.

Analytic continuation shows that the principal nth root is the unique complex differentiable function that extends the usual nth root to the complex plane without the nonpositive real numbers.\nIf the complex number is moved around zero by increasing its argument, after an increment of \n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        π\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2\\pi ,}\n  \n the complex number comes back to its initial position, and its nth roots are permuted circularly (they are multiplied by \n  \n    \n      e\n      \n        2\n        i\n        π\n        \n          /\n        \n        n\n      \n    \n    e^{2i\\pi /n}\n  \n). This shows that it is not possible to define a nth root function that is continuous in the whole complex plane.\n\n\nRoots of unity\n\nThe nth roots of unity are the n complex numbers such that wn = 1, where n is a positive integer.

For example:\n\n\nIrrationality and transcendence\n\nIf b is a positive real algebraic number, and x is a rational number, then bx is an algebraic number. This results from the theory of algebraic extensions. This remains true if b is any algebraic number, in which case, all values of bx (as a multivalued function) are algebraic. If x is irrational (that is, not rational), and both b and x are algebraic, Gelfond–Schneider theorem asserts that all values of bx are transcendental (that is, not algebraic), except if b equals 0 or 1.\nIn other words, if x is irrational and \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n        ∉\n        {\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        }\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b\\not \\in \\{0,1\\},}\n  \n then at least one of b, x and bx is transcendental.\n\n\nInteger powers in algebra\nThe definition of exponentiation with positive integer exponents as repeated multiplication may apply to any associative operation denoted as a multiplication.

A group (or subgroup) that consists of all powers of a specific element x is the cyclic group generated by x. If all the powers of x are distinct, the group is isomorphic to the additive group \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Z\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} }\n  \n of the integers. Otherwise, the cyclic group is finite (it has a finite number of elements), and its number of elements is the order of x. If the order of x is n, then \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{n}=x^{0}=1,}\n  \n and the cyclic group generated by x consists of the n first powers of x (starting indifferently from the exponent 0 or 1).\nOrder of elements play a fundamental role in group theory. For example, the order of an element in a finite group is always a divisor of the number of elements of the group (the order of the group). The possible orders of group elements are important in the study of the structure of a group (see Sylow theorems), and in the classification of finite simple groups.\nSuperscript notation is also used for conjugation; that is, gh = h−1gh, where g and h are elements of a group. This notation cannot be confused with exponentiation, since the superscript is not an integer.

In a commutative ring, the nilpotent elements form an ideal, called the nilradical of the ring.\nIf the nilradical is reduced to the zero ideal (that is, if \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        ≠\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\neq 0}\n  \n implies \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        ≠\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{n}\\neq 0}\n  \n for every positive integer n), the commutative ring is said to be reduced. Reduced rings are important in algebraic geometry, since the coordinate ring of an affine algebraic set is always a reduced ring.\nMore generally, given an ideal I in a commutative ring R, the set of the elements of R that have a power in I is an ideal, called the radical of I. The nilradical is the radical of the zero ideal. A radical ideal is an ideal that equals its own radical. In a polynomial ring \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n        [\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k[x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n}]}\n  \n over a field k, an ideal is radical if and only if it is the set of all polynomials that are zero on an affine algebraic set (this is a consequence of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz).\n\n\nMatrices and linear operators\nIf A is a square matrix, then the product of A with itself n times is called the matrix power. Also \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A^{0}}\n  \n is defined to be the identity matrix, and if A is invertible, then \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            −\n            n\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              A\n              \n                −\n                1\n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A^{-n}=\\left(A^{-1}\\right)^{n}}\n  \n.\nMatrix powers appear often in the context of discrete dynamical systems, where the matrix A expresses a transition from a state vector x of some system to the next state Ax of the system. This is the standard interpretation of a Markov chain, for example. Then \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A^{2}x}\n  \n is the state of the system after two time steps, and so forth: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A^{n}x}\n  \n is the state of the system after n time steps. The matrix power \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A^{n}}\n  \n is the transition matrix between the state now and the state at a time n steps in the future. So computing matrix powers is equivalent to solving the evolution of the dynamical system. In many cases, matrix powers can be expediently computed by using eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\nApart from matrices, more general linear operators can also be exponentiated. An example is the derivative operator of calculus, \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        \n          /\n        \n        d\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d/dx}\n  \n, which is a linear operator acting on functions \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)}\n  \n to give a new function \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        d\n        \n          /\n        \n        d\n        x\n        )\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          f\n          ′\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (d/dx)f(x)=f'(x)}\n  \n. The nth power of the differentiation operator is the nth derivative:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                d\n                \n                  d\n                  x\n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              \n                n\n              \n            \n            \n              d\n              \n                x\n                \n                  n\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          f\n          \n            (\n            n\n            )\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\frac {d}{dx}}\\right)^{n}f(x)={\\frac {d^{n}}{dx^{n}}}f(x)=f^{(n)}(x).}\n  \n\nThese examples are for discrete exponents of linear operators, but in many circumstances it is also desirable to define powers of such operators with continuous exponents. This is the starting point of the mathematical theory of semigroups. Just as computing matrix powers with discrete exponents solves discrete dynamical systems, so does computing matrix powers with continuous exponents solve systems with continuous dynamics. Examples include approaches to solving the heat equation, Schrödinger equation, wave equation, and other partial differential equations including a time evolution. The special case of exponentiating the derivative operator to a non-integer power is called the fractional derivative which, together with the fractional integral, is one of the basic operations of the fractional calculus.\n\n\nFinite fields\n\nA field is an algebraic structure in which multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division are defined and satisfy the properties that multiplication is associative and every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. This implies that exponentiation with integer exponents is well-defined, except for nonpositive powers of 0. Common examples are the field of complex numbers, the real numbers and the rational numbers, considered earlier in this article, which are all infinite.\nA finite field is a field with a finite number of elements. This number of elements is either a prime number or a prime power; that is, it has the form \n  \n    \n      \n        q\n        =\n        \n          p\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle q=p^{k},}\n  \n where p is a prime number, and k is a positive integer. For every such q, there are fields with q elements. The fields with q elements are all isomorphic, which allows, in general, working as if there were only one field with q elements, denoted \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            F\n          \n          \n            q\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{q}.}\n  \n\nOne has\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            q\n          \n        \n        =\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{q}=x}\n  \n\nfor every \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        ∈\n        \n          \n            F\n          \n          \n            q\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\in \\mathbb {F} _{q}.}\n  \n\nA primitive element in \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            F\n          \n          \n            q\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{q}}\n  \n is an element g such that the set of the q − 1 first powers of g (that is, \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        \n          g\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        =\n        g\n        ,\n        \n          g\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        \n          g\n          \n            p\n            −\n            1\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          g\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{g^{1}=g,g^{2},\\ldots ,g^{p-1}=g^{0}=1\\}}\n  \n) equals the set of the nonzero elements of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            F\n          \n          \n            q\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{q}.}\n  \n There are \n  \n    \n      \n        φ\n        (\n        p\n        −\n        1\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi (p-1)}\n  \n primitive elements in \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            F\n          \n          \n            q\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{q},}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        φ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi }\n  \n is Euler's totient function.\nIn \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            F\n          \n          \n            q\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{q},}\n  \n the freshman's dream identity\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        +\n        y\n        \n          )\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x+y)^{p}=x^{p}+y^{p}}\n  \n\nis true for the exponent p.

Iterating tetration leads to another operation, and so on, a concept named hyperoperation. This sequence of operations is expressed by the Ackermann function and Knuth's up-arrow notation. Just as exponentiation grows faster than multiplication, which is faster-growing than addition, tetration is faster-growing than exponentiation. Evaluated at (3, 3), the functions addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and tetration yield 6, 9, 27, and 7625597484987 (=327 = 333 = 33) respectively.\n\n\nLimits of powers\nZero to the power of zero gives a number of examples of limits that are of the indeterminate form 00. The limits in these examples exist, but have different values, showing that the two-variable function xy has no limit at the point (0, 0). One may consider at what points this function does have a limit.\nMore precisely, consider the function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            y\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{y}}\n  \n defined on \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n        =\n        {\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        ∈\n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        :\n        x\n        >\n        0\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D=\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbf {R} ^{2}:x>0\\}}\n  \n. Then D can be viewed as a subset of R2 (that is, the set of all pairs (x, y) with x, y belonging to the extended real number line R = [−∞, +∞], endowed with the product topology), which will contain the points at which the function f has a limit.\nIn fact, f has a limit at all accumulation points of D, except for (0, 0), (+∞, 0), (1, +∞) and (1, −∞). Accordingly, this allows one to define the powers xy by continuity whenever 0 ≤ x ≤ +∞, −∞ ≤ y ≤ +∞, except for 00, (+∞)0, 1+∞ and 1−∞, which remain indeterminate forms.\nUnder this definition by continuity, we obtain:\n\nx+∞ = +∞ and x−∞ = 0, when 1 < x ≤ +∞.\nx+∞ = 0 and x−∞ = +∞, when 0 < x < 1.\n0y = 0 and (+∞)y = +∞, when 0 < y ≤ +∞.\n0y = +∞ and (+∞)y = 0, when −∞ ≤ y < 0.\nThese powers are obtained by taking limits of xy for positive values of x. This method does not permit a definition of xy when x < 0, since pairs (x, y) with x < 0 are not accumulation points of D.\nOn the other hand, when n is an integer, the power xn is already meaningful for all values of x, including negative ones. This may make the definition 0n = +∞ obtained above for negative n problematic when n is odd, since in this case xn → +∞ as x tends to 0 through positive values, but not negative ones.\n\n\nEfficient computation with integer exponents\nComputing bn using iterated multiplication requires n − 1 multiplication operations, but it can be computed more efficiently than that, as illustrated by the following example. To compute 2100, apply Horner's rule to the exponent 100 written in binary:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        100\n        =\n        \n          2\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          2\n          \n            5\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          2\n          \n            6\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          2\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        1\n        +\n        \n          2\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        (\n        1\n        +\n        2\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 100=2^{2}+2^{5}+2^{6}=2^{2}(1+2^{3}(1+2))}\n  \n.\nThen compute the following terms in order, reading Horner's rule from right to left.\n\nThis series of steps only requires 8 multiplications instead of 99.\nIn general, the number of multiplication operations required to compute bn can be reduced to \n  \n    \n      \n        ♯\n        n\n        +\n        ⌊\n        \n          log\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⁡\n        n\n        ⌋\n        −\n        1\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sharp n+\\lfloor \\log _{2}n\\rfloor -1,}\n  \n by using exponentiation by squaring, where \n  \n    \n      \n        ♯\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sharp n}\n  \n denotes the number of 1s in the binary representation of n. For some exponents (100 is not among them), the number of multiplications can be further reduced by computing and using the minimal addition-chain exponentiation. Finding the minimal sequence of multiplications (the minimal-length addition chain for the exponent) for bn is a difficult problem, for which no efficient algorithms are currently known (see Subset sum problem), but many reasonably efficient heuristic algorithms are available. However, in practical computations, exponentiation by squaring is efficient enough, and much easier to implement.\n\n\nIterated functions\n\nFunction composition is a binary operation that is defined on functions such that the codomain of the function written on the right is included in the domain of the function written on the left. It is denoted \n  \n    \n      \n        g\n        ∘\n        f\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle g\\circ f,}\n  \n and defined as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        g\n        ∘\n        f\n        )\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        g\n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (g\\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))}\n  \n\nfor every x in the domain of f.\nIf the domain of a function f equals its codomain, one may compose the function with itself an arbitrary number of time, and this defines the nth power of the function under composition, commonly called the nth iterate of the function. Thus \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f^{n}}\n  \n denotes generally the nth iterate of f; for example, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f^{3}(x)}\n  \n means \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        f\n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(f(f(x))).}\n  \n\nWhen a multiplication is defined on the codomain of the function, this defines a multiplication on functions, the pointwise multiplication, which induces another exponentiation. When using functional notation, the two kinds of exponentiation are generally distinguished by placing the exponent of the functional iteration before the parentheses enclosing the arguments of the function, and placing the exponent of pointwise multiplication after the parentheses. Thus \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        f\n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f^{2}(x)=f(f(x)),}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ⋅\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)^{2}=f(x)\\cdot f(x).}\n  \n When functional notation is not used, disambiguation is often done by placing the composition symbol before the exponent; for example \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n            ∘\n            3\n          \n        \n        =\n        f\n        ∘\n        f\n        ∘\n        f\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f^{\\circ 3}=f\\circ f\\circ f,}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        =\n        f\n        ⋅\n        f\n        ⋅\n        f\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f^{3}=f\\cdot f\\cdot f.}\n  \n For historical reasons, the exponent of a repeated multiplication is placed before the argument for some specific functions, typically the trigonometric functions. So, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          sin\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⁡\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin ^{2}x}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          sin\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⁡\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin ^{2}(x)}\n  \n both mean \n  \n    \n      \n        sin\n        ⁡\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ⋅\n        sin\n        ⁡\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin(x)\\cdot \\sin(x)}\n  \n and not \n  \n    \n      \n        sin\n        ⁡\n        (\n        sin\n        ⁡\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin(\\sin(x)),}\n  \n which, in any case, is rarely considered. Historically, several variants of these notations were used by different authors.\nIn this context, the exponent \n  \n    \n      \n        −\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle -1}\n  \n denotes always the inverse function, if it exists.

The most common operator symbol for exponentiation is the caret (^). The original version of ASCII included an uparrow symbol (↑), intended for exponentiation, but this was replaced by the caret in 1967, so the caret became usual in programming languages.\nThe notations include:\n\nx ^ y: AWK, BASIC, J, MATLAB, Wolfram Language (Mathematica), R, Microsoft Excel, Analytica, TeX (and its derivatives), TI-BASIC, bc (for integer exponents), Haskell (for nonnegative integer exponents), Lua, and most computer algebra systems.\nx ** y. The Fortran character set did not include lowercase characters or punctuation symbols other than +-*/()&=.,' and so used ** for exponentiation (the initial version used a xx b instead.). Many other languages followed suit: Ada, Z shell, KornShell, Bash, COBOL, CoffeeScript, Fortran, FoxPro, Gnuplot, Groovy, JavaScript, OCaml, ooRexx, F#, Perl, PHP, PL/I, Python, Rexx, Ruby, SAS, Tcl, ABAP, Mercury, Haskell (for floating-point exponents), Turing, and VHDL.\nx ↑ y: Algol Reference language, Commodore BASIC, TRS-80 Level II/III BASIC.\nx ^^ y: Haskell (for fractional base, integer exponents), D.\nx⋆y: APL.\nIn most programming languages with an infix exponentiation operator, it is right-associative, that is, a^b^c is interpreted as a^(b^c). This is because (a^b)^c is equal to a^(b*c) and thus not as useful. In some languages, it is left-associative, notably in Algol, MATLAB, and the Microsoft Excel formula language.\nOther programming languages use functional notation:\n\n(expt x y): Common Lisp.\npown x y: F# (for integer base, integer exponent).\nStill others only provide exponentiation as part of standard libraries:\n\npow(x, y): C, C++ (in math library).\nMath.Pow(x, y): C#.\nmath:pow(X, Y): Erlang.\nMath.pow(x, y): Java.\n[Math]::Pow(x, y): PowerShell.\nIn some statically typed languages that prioritize type safety such as Rust, exponentiation is performed via a multitude of methods:\n\nx.pow(y) for x and y as integers\nx.powf(y) for x and y as floating-point numbers\nx.powi(y) for x as a float and y as an integer\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences",
