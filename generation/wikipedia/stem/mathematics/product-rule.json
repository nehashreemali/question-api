For two functions, it may be stated in Lagrange's notation as \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        u\n        ⋅\n        v\n        \n          )\n          ′\n        \n        =\n        \n          u\n          ′\n        \n        ⋅\n        v\n        +\n        u\n        ⋅\n        \n          v\n          ′\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (u\\cdot v)'=u'\\cdot v+u\\cdot v'}\n  \n or in Leibniz's notation as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            d\n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        u\n        ⋅\n        v\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              u\n            \n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        v\n        +\n        u\n        ⋅\n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              v\n            \n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d}{dx}}(u\\cdot v)={\\frac {du}{dx}}\\cdot v+u\\cdot {\\frac {dv}{dx}}.}\n  \n\nThe rule may be extended or generalized to products of three or more functions, to a rule for higher-order derivatives of a product, and to other contexts.\n\n\nDiscovery\nDiscovery of this rule is credited to Gottfried Leibniz, who demonstrated it using \"infinitesimals\" (a precursor to the modern differential). (However, J. M. Child, a translator of Leibniz's papers, argues that it is due to Isaac Barrow.) Here is Leibniz's argument: Let u and v be functions. Then d(uv) is the same thing as the difference between two successive uv's; let one of these be uv, and the other u+du times v+dv; then:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                d\n                (\n                u\n                ⋅\n                v\n                )\n              \n              \n                \n                \n\n                \n                =\n                (\n                u\n                +\n                d\n                u\n                )\n                ⋅\n                (\n                v\n                +\n                d\n                v\n                )\n                −\n                u\n                ⋅\n                v\n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                \n\n                \n                =\n                u\n                ⋅\n                d\n                v\n                +\n                v\n                ⋅\n                d\n                u\n                +\n                d\n                u\n                ⋅\n                d\n                v\n                .\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}d(u\\cdot v)&{}=(u+du)\\cdot (v+dv)-u\\cdot v\\\\&{}=u\\cdot dv+v\\cdot du+du\\cdot dv.\\end{aligned}}}\n  \n\nSince the term du·dv is \"negligible\" (compared to du and dv), Leibniz concluded that\n\n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        (\n        u\n        ⋅\n        v\n        )\n        =\n        v\n        ⋅\n        d\n        u\n        +\n        u\n        ⋅\n        d\n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d(u\\cdot v)=v\\cdot du+u\\cdot dv}\n  \n\nand this is indeed the differential form of the product rule.

Leibniz reasoned with \"infinitely smaller quantities\", interpreting products as areas of rectangles, while Newton reasoned with \"flowing quantities\".\n\n\nExamples\nSuppose we want to differentiate \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          sin\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}{\\text{sin}}(x).}\n  \n By using the product rule, one gets the derivative \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          ′\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        2\n        x\n        ⋅\n        \n          sin\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        +\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          cos\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f'(x)=2x\\cdot {\\text{sin}}(x)+x^{2}{\\text{cos}}(x)}\n  \n (since the derivative of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{2}}\n  \n is \n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        x\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2x,}\n  \n and the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function).\nOne special case of the product rule is the constant multiple rule, which states: if c is a number, and \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)}\n  \n is a differentiable function, then \n  \n    \n      \n        c\n        ⋅\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c\\cdot f(x)}\n  \n is also differentiable, and its derivative is \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        c\n        f\n        \n          )\n          ′\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        c\n        ⋅\n        \n          f\n          ′\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (cf)'(x)=c\\cdot f'(x).}\n  \n This follows from the product rule since the derivative of any constant is zero. This, combined with the sum rule for derivatives, shows that differentiation is linear.\nThe rule for integration by parts is derived from the product rule, as is (a weak version of) the quotient rule. (It is a \"weak\" version in that it does not prove that the quotient is differentiable but only says what its derivative is if it is differentiable.)\n\n\nProofs\n\n\nLimit definition of derivative\nLet h(x) = f(x)g(x) and suppose that f and g are each differentiable at x. We want to prove that h is differentiable at x and that its derivative, h′(x), is given by f′(x)g(x) + f(x)g′(x). To do this, \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        +\n        Δ\n        x\n        )\n        −\n        f\n        (\n        x\n

change the value) is added to the numerator to permit its factoring, and then properties of limits are used.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n
