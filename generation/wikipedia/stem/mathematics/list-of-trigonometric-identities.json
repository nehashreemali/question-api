  "extract": "In trigonometry, trigonometric identities are equalities that involve trigonometric functions and are true for every value of the occurring variables for which both sides of the equality are defined. Geometrically, these are identities involving certain functions of one or more angles. They are distinct from triangle identities, which are identities potentially involving angles but also involving side lengths or other lengths of a triangle.\nThese identities are useful whenever expressions involving trigonometric functions need to be simplified. An important application is the integration of non-trigonometric functions: a common technique involves first using the substitution rule with a trigonometric function, and then simplifying the resulting integral with a trigonometric identity.\n\n\nPythagorean identities\n\nThe basic relationship between the sine and cosine is given by the Pythagorean identity:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          sin\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⁡\n        θ\n        +\n        \n          cos\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⁡\n        θ\n        =\n        1\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin ^{2}\\theta +\\cos ^{2}\\theta =1,}\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          sin\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⁡\n        θ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin ^{2}\\theta }\n  \n means \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            (\n            sin\n            ⁡\n            θ\n            )\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {(\\sin \\theta )}^{2}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          cos\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⁡\n        θ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cos ^{2}\\theta }\n  \n means \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            (\n            cos\n            ⁡\n            θ\n            )\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {(\\cos \\theta )}^{2}.}\n  \n\nThis can be viewed as a version of the Pythagorean theorem, and follows from the equation \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=1}\n  \n for the unit circle.

It states that in a cyclic quadrilateral \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        B\n        C\n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ABCD}\n  \n, as shown in the accompanying figure, the sum of the products of the lengths of opposite sides is equal to the product of the lengths of the diagonals. In the special cases of one of the diagonals or sides being a diameter of the circle, this theorem gives rise directly to the angle sum and difference trigonometric identities. The relationship follows most easily when the circle is constructed to have a diameter of length one, as shown here.\nBy Thales's theorem, \n  \n    \n      \n        ∠\n        D\n        A\n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\angle DAB}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        ∠\n        D\n        C\n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\angle DCB}\n  \n are both right angles.

sine and cosine only involves powers of a single function allows one to relate the geometric problem of a compass and straightedge construction of angle trisection to the algebraic problem of solving a cubic equation, which allows one to prove that trisection is in general impossible using the given tools.\nA formula for computing the trigonometric identities for the one-third angle exists, but it requires finding the zeroes of the cubic equation 4x3 − 3x + d = 0, where \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n is the value of the cosine function at the one-third angle and d is the known value of the cosine function at the full angle. However, the discriminant of this equation is positive, so this equation has three real roots (of which only one is the solution for the cosine of the one-third angle). None of these solutions are reducible to a real algebraic expression, as they use intermediate complex numbers under the cube roots.\n\n\nPower-reduction formulae\nObtained by solving the second and third versions of the cosine double-angle formula.\n\nIn general terms of powers of \n  \n    \n      \n        sin\n        ⁡\n        θ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sin \\theta }\n  \n or \n  \n    \n      \n        cos\n        ⁡\n        θ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cos \\theta }\n  \n the following is true, and can be deduced using De Moivre's formula, Euler's formula and the binomial theorem.\n\n\nProduct-to-sum and sum-to-product identities\n\nThe product-to-sum identities or prosthaphaeresis formulae can be proven by expanding their right-hand sides using the angle addition theorems. Historically, the first four of these were known as Werner's formulas, after Johannes Werner who used them for astronomical calculations. See amplitude modulation for an application of the product-to-sum formulae, and beat (acoustics) and phase detector for applications of the sum-to-product formulae.\n\n\nProduct-to-sum identities\nThe

prime factors in common with) 21. The last several examples are corollaries of a basic fact about the irreducible cyclotomic polynomials: the cosines are the real parts of the zeroes of those polynomials; the sum of the zeroes is the Möbius function evaluated at (in the very last case above) 21; only half of the zeroes are present above. The two identities preceding this last one arise in the same fashion with 21 replaced by 10 and 15, respectively.\nOther cosine identities include:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n
