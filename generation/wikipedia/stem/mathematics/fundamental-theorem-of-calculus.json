  "extract": "The fundamental theorem of calculus is a theorem that links the concept of differentiating a function (calculating its slopes, or rate of change at every point on its domain) with the concept of integrating a function (calculating the area under its graph, or the cumulative effect of small contributions). Roughly speaking, the two operations can be thought of as inverses of each other.\nThe first part of the theorem, the first fundamental theorem of calculus, states that for a continuous function f , an antiderivative or indefinite integral F can be obtained as the integral of f over an interval with a variable upper bound.\nConversely, the second part of the theorem, the second fundamental theorem of calculus, states that the integral of a function f over a fixed interval is equal to the change of any antiderivative F between the ends of the interval. This greatly simplifies the calculation of a definite integral provided an antiderivative can be found by symbolic integration, thus avoiding numerical integration.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus relates differentiation and integration, showing that these two operations are essentially inverses of one another. Before the discovery of this theorem, it was not recognized that these two operations were related. Ancient Greek mathematicians knew how to compute area via infinitesimals, an operation that we would now call integration. The origins of differentiation likewise predate the fundamental theorem of calculus by hundreds of years; for example, in the fourteenth century the notions of continuity of functions and motion were studied by the Oxford Calculators and other scholars. The historical relevance of the fundamental theorem of calculus is not the ability to calculate these operations, but the realization that the two seemingly distinct operations (calculation of geometric areas, and calculation of gradients) are actually closely related.\nCalculus as a unified theory of integration and differentiation started from the conjecture and the proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus. The first published statement and proof of a rudimentary form of the fundamental theorem, strongly geometric in character, was by James Gregory (1638–1675). Isaac Barrow (1630–1677) proved a more generalized version of the theorem, while his student Isaac Newton (1642–1727) completed the development of the surrounding mathematical theory. Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716) systematized the knowledge into a calculus for infinitesimal quantities and introduced the notation used today.\n\n\nSketch of geometric proof\n\nThe first fundamental theorem may be interpreted as follows. Given a continuous function \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=f(x)}\n  \n whose graph is plotted as a curve, one defines a corresponding \"area function\" \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        ↦\n        A\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\mapsto A(x)}\n  \n such that A(x) is the area beneath the curve between 0 and x. The area A(x) may not be easily computable, but it is assumed to be well defined.\nThe area under the curve between x and x + h could be computed by finding the area between 0 and x + h, then subtracting the area between 0 and x. In other words, the area of this \"strip\" would be A(x + h) − A(x).\nThere is another way to estimate the area of this same strip. As shown in the accompanying figure, h is multiplied by f(x) to find the area of a rectangle that is approximately the same size as this strip. So:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        (\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        )\n        −\n        A\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ≈\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ⋅\n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A(x+h)-A(x)\\approx f(x)\\cdot h}\n  \n\nDividing by h on both sides, we get:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              A\n              (\n              x\n              +\n              h\n              )\n              −\n              A\n              (\n              x\n              )\n            \n            h\n          \n        \n        ≈\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {A(x+h)-A(x)}{h}}\\approx f(x)}\n  \n\nThis estimate becomes a perfect equality when h approaches 0:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          lim\n          \n            h\n            →\n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              A\n              (\n              x\n              +\n              h\n              )\n              −\n              A\n              (\n              x\n              )\n            \n            h\n          \n        \n         \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                =\n              \n              \n                def\n              \n            \n          \n        \n         \n        \n          A\n          ′\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=\\lim _{h\\to 0}{\\frac {A(x+h)-A(x)}{h}}\\ {\\stackrel {\\text{def}}{=}}\\ A'(x).}\n  \nThat is, the derivative of the area function A(x) exists and is equal to the original function f(x), so the area function is an antiderivative of the original function.\nThus, the derivative of the integral of a function (the area) is the original function, so that derivative and integral are inverse operations which reverse each other. This is the essence of the Fundamental Theorem.\n\n\nIntuitive understanding\nIntuitively, the fundamental theorem states that integration and differentiation are inverse operations which reverse each other.\nThe second fundamental theorem says that the sum of infinitesimal changes in a quantity (the integral of the derivative of the quantity) adds up to the net change in the quantity. To visualize this, imagine traveling in a car and wanting to know the distance traveled (the net change in position along the highway). You can see the velocity on the speedometer but cannot look out to see your location. Each second, you can find how far the car has traveled using distance = speed × time, that is, multiplying the current speed (in kilometers or miles per hour) by the time interval (1 second = \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              3600\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{3600}}}\n  \n hour). By summing up all these small steps, you can approximate the total distance traveled, in spite of not looking outside the car:\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          distance traveled\n        \n        =\n        ∑\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    velocity at\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    each time\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        ×\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    time\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    interval\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        =\n        ∑\n        \n          v\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        ×\n        Δ\n        t\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{distance traveled}}=\\sum \\left({\\begin{array}{c}{\\text{velocity at}}\\\\{\\text{each time}}\\end{array}}\\right)\\times \\left({\\begin{array}{c}{\\text{time}}\\\\{\\text{interval}}\\end{array}}\\right)=\\sum v_{t}\\times \\Delta t.}\n  \nAs \n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta t}\n  \n becomes infinitesimally small, the summing up corresponds to integration. Thus, the integral of the velocity function (the derivative of position) computes how far the car has traveled (the net change in position).\nThe first fundamental theorem says that the value of any function is the rate of change (the derivative) of its integral from a fixed starting point up to any chosen end point. Continuing the above example using a velocity as the function, you can integrate it from the starting time up to any given time to obtain a distance function whose derivative is that velocity. (To obtain your highway-marker position, you would need to add your starting position to this integral and to take into account whether your travel was in the direction of increasing or decreasing mile markers.)\n\n\nFormal statements\nThere are two parts to the theorem. The first part deals with the derivative of an antiderivative, while the second part deals with the relationship between antiderivatives and definite integrals. The terminology on this topic has not been completely standardized. For convenience, this article uses one of the common conventions. The conventions adopted in other sources are discussed later.\n\n\nFirst part\nThis part is sometimes referred to as the first fundamental theorem of calculus.\nLet f be a continuous real-valued function defined on a closed interval [a, b].

What we have to do is approximate the curve with n rectangles. Now, as the size of the partitions get smaller and n increases, resulting in more partitions to cover the space, we get closer and closer to the actual area of the curve.\nBy taking the limit of the expression as the norm of the partitions approaches zero, we arrive at the Riemann integral. We know that this limit exists because f was assumed to be integrable. That is, we take the limit as the largest of the partitions approaches zero in size, so that all other partitions are smaller and the number of partitions approaches infinity.\nSo, we take the limit on both sides of (2').

That is, suppose G is an antiderivative of f. Then by the second theorem, \n  \n    \n      \n        G\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        −\n        G\n        (\n        a\n        )\n        =\n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            x\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        \n        d\n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle G(x)-G(a)=\\int _{a}^{x}f(t)\\,dt}\n  \n. Now, suppose \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            x\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        \n        d\n        t\n        =\n        G\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        −\n        G\n        (\n        a\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle F(x)=\\int _{a}^{x}f(t)\\,dt=G(x)-G(a)}\n  \n. Then F has the same derivative as G, and therefore F′ = f. This argument only works, however, if we already know that f has an antiderivative, and the only way we know that all continuous functions have antiderivatives is by the first part of the Fundamental Theorem.\nFor example, if f(x) = e−x2, then f has an antiderivative, namely\n\n  \n    \n      \n        G\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          ∫\n          \n            0\n          \n          \n            x\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        \n        d\n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G(x)=\\int _{0}^{x}f(t)\\,dt}\n  \n\nand there is no simpler expression for this function. It is therefore important not to interpret the second part of the theorem as the definition of the integral. Indeed, there are many functions that are integrable but lack elementary antiderivatives, and discontinuous functions can be integrable but lack any antiderivatives at all. Conversely, many functions that have antiderivatives are not Riemann integrable (see Volterra's function).\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nComputing a particular integral\nSuppose the following is to be calculated:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            5\n          \n        \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n        d\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{2}^{5}x^{2}\\,dx.}\n  \n\nHere, \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}}\n  \n and we can use \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            3\n          \n        \n        \n          x\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle F(x)={\\frac {1}{3}}x^{3}}\n  \n as the antiderivative.

calculus and which should be called the second. In this article, the first fundamental theorem is that, if one is given a continuous function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n and defines a new function by \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            x\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        \n        d\n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F(x)=\\int _{a}^{x}f(t)\\,dt}\n  \n, then \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          ′\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F'(x)=f(x)}\n  \n. Apostol's calculus series uses this terminology, and similarly, Strang et al. call this \"part 1\" of the fundamental theorem of calculus. Multiple other texts also call this result the first fundamental theorem or the fundamental theorem's first part.\nOn the other hand, Larson and Edwards adopt a different convention, in which \"the fundamental theorem\" is that the definite integral is the change of the antiderivative, \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        −\n        F\n        (\n        c\n        )\n        =\n        \n          ∫\n          \n            c\n          \n          \n            x\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        \n        d\n        t\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F(x)-F(c)=\\int _{c}^{x}f(t)\\,dt\\,}\n  \n for a continuous function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n. That is, this article's \"corollary\" is designated \"the fundamental theorem\", while the \"second fundamental theorem\" is what Apostol calls the first. Other textbooks also call this article's \"second fundamental theorem\", or a weaker form of it that assumes continuity, the first.\nSalas and Hille's Calculus: One and Several Variables (1971) says that the latter expression in the special case of continuous \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n (this article's \"corollary\") is \"the fundamental theorem of integral calculus\", while this article's \"first part\" is just the un-named Theorem 4.3.2. Similarly, some other works call this article's \"second part\" the fundamental theorem while leaving the other part un-named.\nBoyer's History of the Calculus first explains \"what is commonly known as the fundamental theorem of the calculus\": that if \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            x\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        \n        d\n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F(x)=\\int _{a}^{x}f(t)\\,dt}\n  \n, then \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          ′\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F'(x)=f(x)}\n  \n. For Boyer, our \"first part\" is \"the fundamental theorem\". Then, Boyer writes that the difference of the antiderivatives \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        (\n        b\n        )\n        −\n        F\n        (\n        a\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F(b)-F(a)}\n  \n \"is occasionally taken as the definition\" of the integral \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx}\n  \n.

Part I of the theorem then says: if f is any Lebesgue integrable function on [a, b] and x0 is a number in [a, b] such that f is continuous at x0, then\n\n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            x\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        \n        d\n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F(x)=\\int _{a}^{x}f(t)\\,dt}\n  \n\nis differentiable for x = x0 with F′(x0) = f(x0). We can relax the conditions on f still further and suppose that it is merely locally integrable. In that case, we can conclude that the function F is differentiable almost everywhere and F′(x) = f(x) almost everywhere. On the real line this statement is equivalent to Lebesgue's differentiation theorem. These results remain true for the Henstock–Kurzweil integral, which allows a larger class of integrable functions.\nIn higher dimensions Lebesgue's differentiation theorem generalizes the Fundamental theorem of calculus by stating that for almost every x, the average value of a function f over a ball of radius r centered at x tends to f(x) as r tends to 0.\nPart II of the theorem is true for any Lebesgue integrable function f, which has an antiderivative F (not all integrable functions do, though). In other words, if a real function F on [a, b] admits a derivative f(x) at every point x of [a, b] and if this derivative f is Lebesgue integrable on [a, b], then\n\n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        (\n        b\n        )\n        −\n        F\n        (\n        a\n        )\n        =\n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        \n        d\n        t\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F(b)-F(a)=\\int _{a}^{b}f(t)\\,dt.}\n  \n\nThis result may fail for continuous functions F that admit a derivative f(x) at almost every point x, as the example of the Cantor function shows. However, if F is absolutely continuous, it admits a derivative F′(x) at almost every point x, and moreover F′ is integrable, with F(b) − F(a) equal to the integral of F′ on [a, b]. Conversely, if f is any integrable function, then F as given in the first formula will be absolutely continuous with F′ = f almost everywhere.\nThe conditions of this theorem may again be relaxed by considering the integrals involved as Henstock–Kurzweil integrals. Specifically, if a continuous function F(x) admits a derivative f(x) at all but countably many points, then f(x) is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable and F(b) − F(a) is equal to the integral of f on [a, b]. The difference here is that the integrability of f does not need to be assumed.\nThe version of Taylor's theorem that expresses the error term as an integral can be seen as a generalization of the fundamental theorem.\nThere is a version of the theorem for complex functions: suppose U is an open set in C and f : U → C is a function that has a holomorphic antiderivative F on U. Then for every curve γ : [a, b] → U, the curve integral can be computed as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            γ\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        z\n        =\n        F\n        (\n        γ\n        (\n        b\n        )\n        )\n        −\n        F\n        (\n        γ\n        (\n        a\n        )\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{\\gamma }f(z)\\,dz=F(\\gamma (b))-F(\\gamma (a)).}\n  \n\nThe fundamental theorem can be generalized to curve and surface integrals in higher dimensions and on manifolds. One such generalization offered by the calculus of moving surfaces is the time evolution of integrals. The most familiar extensions of the fundamental theorem of calculus in higher dimensions are the divergence theorem and the gradient theorem.\nOne of the most powerful generalizations in this direction is the generalized Stokes theorem (sometimes known as the fundamental theorem of multivariable calculus): Let M be an oriented piecewise smooth manifold of dimension n and let \n  \n    \n      \n        ω\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\omega }\n  \n be a smooth compactly supported (n − 1)-form on M.
