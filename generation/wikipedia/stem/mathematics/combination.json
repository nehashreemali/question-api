  "extract": "In mathematics, a combination is a selection of items from a set that has distinct members, such that the order of selection does not matter (unlike permutations). For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange. More formally, a k-combination of a set S is a subset of k distinct elements of S. So, two combinations are identical if and only if each combination has the same members. (The arrangement of the members in each set does not matter.)

To refer to combinations in which repetition is allowed, the terms k-combination with repetition, k-multiset, or k-selection, are often used. If, in the above example, it were possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there would be 3 more 2-selections: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and one with two pears.\nAlthough the set of three fruits was small enough to write a complete list of combinations, this becomes impractical as the size of the set increases. For example, a poker hand can be described as a 5-combination (k = 5) of cards from a 52 card deck (n = 52). The 5 cards of the hand are all distinct, and the order of cards in the hand does not matter. There are 2,598,960 such combinations, and the chance of drawing any one hand at random is 1 / 2,598,960.\n\n\nNumber of k-combinations\n\nThe number of k-combinations from a given set S of n elements is often denoted in elementary combinatorics texts by \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        (\n        n\n        ,\n        k\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C(n,k)}\n  \n, or by a variation such as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            k\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{k}^{n}}\n  \n,  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        \n          C\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {}_{n}C_{k}}\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        \n          C\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {}^{n}C_{k}}\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            n\n            ,\n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{n,k}}\n  \n or even \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            n\n          \n          \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{n}^{k}}\n  \n (the last form is standard in French, Romanian, Russian, and Chinese texts).

Now setting all of the Xs equal to the unlabeled variable X, so that the product becomes (1 + X)n, the term for each k-combination from S becomes Xk, so that the coefficient of that power in the result equals the number of such k-combinations.\nBinomial coefficients can be computed explicitly in various ways.

This expresses a symmetry that is evident from the binomial formula, and can also be understood in terms of k-combinations by taking the complement of such a combination, which is an (n − k)-combination.\nFinally there is a formula which exhibits this symmetry directly, and has the merit of being easy to remember:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              (\n            \n            \n              n\n              k\n            \n            \n              )\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              n\n              !\n            \n            \n              k\n              !\n              (\n              n\n              −\n              k\n              )\n              !\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\binom {n}{k}}={\\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}},}\n  \n\nwhere n! denotes the factorial of n. It is obtained from the previous formula by multiplying denominator and numerator by (n − k)!, so it is certainly computationally less efficient than that formula.\nThe last formula can be understood directly, by considering the n! permutations of all the elements of S. Each such permutation gives a k-combination by selecting its first k elements. There are many duplicate selections: any combined permutation of the first k elements among each other, and of the final (n − k) elements among each other produces the same combination; this explains the division in the formula.\nFrom the above formulas follow relations between adjacent numbers in Pascal's triangle in all three directions:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n

a given set S of n elements in some fixed order, which establishes a bijection from an interval of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                (\n

{\\tbinom {n}{k}}}\n  \n integers with the set of those k-combinations. Assuming S is itself ordered, for instance S = { 1, 2, ..., n }, there are two natural possibilities for ordering its k-combinations: by comparing their smallest elements first (as in the illustrations above) or by comparing their largest elements first. The latter option has the advantage that adding a new largest element to S will not change the initial part of the enumeration, but just add the new k-combinations of the larger set after the previous ones. Repeating this process, the enumeration can be extended indefinitely with k-combinations of ever larger sets. If moreover the intervals of the integers are taken to start at 0, then the k-combination at a given place i in the enumeration can be computed easily from i, and the bijection so obtained is known as the combinatorial number system. It is also known as \"rank\"/\"ranking\" and \"unranking\" in computational mathematics.\nThere are many ways to enumerate k combinations. One way is to track k index numbers of the elements selected, starting with {0 .. k−1} (zero-based) or {1 .. k} (one-based) as the first allowed k-combination. Then, repeatedly move to the next allowed k-combination by incrementing the smallest index number for which this would not create two equal index numbers, at the same time resetting all smaller index numbers to their initial values.\n\n\nNumber of combinations with repetition\n\nA k-combination with repetitions, or k-multicombination, or multisubset of size k from a set S of size n is given by a set of k not necessarily distinct elements of S, where order is not taken into account: two sequences define the same multiset if one can be obtained from the other by permuting the terms. In other words, it is a sample of k elements from a set of n elements allowing for duplicates (i.e., with replacement) but disregarding different orderings (e.g. {2,1,2} = {1,2,2}). Associate an index to each element of S and think of the elements of S as types of objects, then we can let \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{i}}\n  \n denote the number of elements of type i in a multisubset.

This can be generalized to any number of bins with the constraint that every item must go to exactly one bin. The number of ways to put objects into bins is given by the multinomial coefficient\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              (\n            \n            \n              n\n              \n                \n                  k\n                  \n                    1\n                  \n                \n                ,\n                \n                  k\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                ,\n                …\n                ,\n                \n                  k\n                  \n                    m\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              )\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              n\n              !\n            \n            \n              \n                k\n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n              !\n              \n              \n                k\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              !\n              ⋯\n              \n                k\n                \n                  m\n                \n              \n              !\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\binom {n}{k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots ,k_{m}}}={\\frac {n!}{k_{1}!\\,k_{2}!\\cdots k_{m}!}},}\n  \n\nwhere n is the number of items, m is the number of bins, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          k\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k_{i}}\n  \n is the number of items that go into bin i.\nOne way to see why this equation holds is to first number the objects arbitrarily from 1 to n and put the objects with numbers \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        ,\n        2\n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1,2,\\ldots ,k_{1}}\n  \n into the first bin in order, the objects with numbers \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          k\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        +\n        1\n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        +\n        2\n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          k\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k_{1}+1,k_{1}+2,\\ldots ,k_{1}+k_{2}}\n  \n into the second bin in order, and so on.
