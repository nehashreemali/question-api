It is even possible to obtain a result slightly greater than one for the cosine of an angle.\nThe third formula shown is the result of solving for a in the quadratic equation a2 − 2ab cos γ + b2 − c2 = 0. This equation can have 2, 1, or 0 positive solutions corresponding to the number of possible triangles given the data. It will have two positive solutions if b sin γ < c < b, only one positive solution if c = b sin γ, and no solution if c < b sin γ. These different cases are also explained by the side-side-angle congruence ambiguity.\n\n\nHistory\nBook II of Euclid's Elements, compiled c. 300 BC from material up to a century or two older, contains a geometric theorem corresponding to the law of cosines but expressed in the contemporary language of rectangle areas; Hellenistic trigonometry developed later, and sine and cosine per se first appeared centuries afterward in India.\nThe cases of obtuse triangles and acute triangles (corresponding to the two cases of negative or positive cosine) are treated separately, in Propositions II.12 and II.13:\n\nProposition 12.In obtuse-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the obtuse angle is greater than the squares on the sides containing the obtuse angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides about the obtuse angle, namely that on which the perpendicular falls, and the straight line cut off outside by the perpendicular towards the obtuse angle.\nProposition 13 contains an analogous statement for acute triangles. In his (now-lost and only preserved through fragmentary quotations) commentary, Heron of Alexandria provided proofs of the converses of both II.12 and II.13.\n\nUsing notation as in Fig. 2, Euclid's statement of proposition II.12 can be represented more concisely (though anachronistically) by the formula\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          B\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        C\n        \n          A\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        C\n        \n          B\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        2\n        (\n        C\n        A\n        )\n        (\n        C\n        H\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle AB^{2}=CA^{2}+CB^{2}+2(CA)(CH).}\n  \n\nTo transform this into the familiar expression for the law of cosines, substitute ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        B\n        =\n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle AB=c}\n  \n⁠, ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        A\n        =\n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle CA=b}\n  \n⁠, ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        B\n        =\n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle CB=a}\n  \n⁠, and \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        H\n        =\n        a\n        cos\n        ⁡\n        (\n        π\n        −\n        γ\n        )\n         \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle CH=a\\cos(\\pi -\\gamma )\\ }\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n\n        \n        =\n        −\n        a\n        cos\n        ⁡\n        γ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\!{}=-a\\cos \\gamma }\n  \n.\nProposition II.13 was not used in Euclid's time for the solution of triangles, but later it was used that way in the course of solving astronomical problems by al-Bīrūnī (11th century) and Johannes de Muris (14th century). Something equivalent to the spherical law of cosines was used (but not stated in general) by al-Khwārizmī (9th century), al-Battānī (9th century), and Nīlakaṇṭha (15th century).\nThe 13th century Persian mathematician Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī, in his Kitāb al-Shakl al-qattāʴ (Book on the Complete Quadrilateral, c. 1250), systematically described how to solve triangles from various combinations of given data. Given two sides and their included angle in a scalene triangle, he proposed finding the third side by dropping a perpendicular from the vertex of one of the unknown angles to the opposite base, reducing the problem to finding the legs of one right triangle from a known angle and hypotenuse using the law of sines and then finding the hypotenuse of another right triangle from two known sides by the Pythagorean theorem.\nAbout two centuries later, another Persian mathematician, Jamshīd al-Kāshī, who computed the most accurate trigonometric tables of his era, also described the solution of triangles from various combinations of given data in his Miftāḥ al-ḥisāb (Key of Arithmetic, 1427), and repeated essentially al-Ṭūsī's method, now consolidated into one formula and including more explicit details, as follows: \n\nAnother case is when two sides and the angle between them are known and the rest are unknown. We multiply one of the sides by the sine of the [known] angle one time and by the sine of its complement the other time converted and we subtract the second result from the other side if the angle is acute and add it if the angle is obtuse.

In this case, the right triangle to which the Pythagorean theorem is applied moves outside the triangle ABC. The only effect this has on the calculation is that the quantity b − a cos(γ) is replaced by a cos(γ) − b. As this quantity enters the calculation only through its square, the rest of the proof is unaffected. However, this problem only occurs when β is obtuse, and may be avoided by reflecting the triangle about the bisector of γ.\nReferring to Fig. 6 it is worth noting that if the angle opposite side a is α then:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        tan\n        ⁡\n        α\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              sin\n              ⁡\n              γ\n            \n            \n              b\n              −\n              a\n              cos\n              ⁡\n              γ\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tan \\alpha ={\\frac {a\\sin \\gamma }{b-a\\cos \\gamma }}.}\n  \n\nThis is useful for direct calculation of a second angle when two sides and an included angle are given.\n\n\nFrom three altitudes\n\nThe altitude through vertex C is a segment perpendicular to side c. The distance from the foot of the altitude to vertex A plus the distance from the foot of the altitude to vertex B is equal to the length of side c (see Fig. 5).

of cosine and obtains squared side lengths algebraically. Other proofs typically invoke the Pythagorean theorem explicitly, and are more geometric, treating a cos γ as a label for the length of a certain line segment.\nUnlike many proofs, this one handles the cases of obtuse and acute angles γ in a unified fashion.\n\n\nCartesian coordinates\n\nConsider a triangle with sides of length a, b, c, where θ is the measurement of the angle opposite the side of length c.

depending on whether the angle γ is acute, right, or obtuse.
