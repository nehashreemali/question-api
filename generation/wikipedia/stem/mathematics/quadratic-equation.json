(If a = 0 and b ≠ 0 then the equation is linear, not quadratic.) The numbers a, b, and c are the coefficients of the equation and may be distinguished by respectively calling them, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant coefficient or free term.\nThe values of ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n⁠ that satisfy the equation are called solutions of the equation, and roots or zeros of the quadratic function on its left-hand side. A quadratic equation has at most two solutions. If there is only one solution, one says that it is a double root. If all the coefficients are real numbers, there are either two real solutions, or a real double root, or two complex solutions that are complex conjugates of each other. A quadratic equation always has two roots, if complex roots are included and a double root is counted for two. A quadratic equation can be factored into an equivalent equation \n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        b\n        x\n        +\n        c\n        =\n        a\n        (\n        x\n        −\n        r\n        )\n        (\n        x\n        −\n        s\n        )\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=a(x-r)(x-s)=0}\n  \n\nwhere r and s are the solutions for ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n⁠. \nThe quadratic formula\n\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              −\n              b\n              ±\n              \n                \n                  \n                    b\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                  −\n                  4\n                  a\n                  c\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              2\n              a\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x={\\frac {-b\\pm {\\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}}\n  \n\nexpresses the solutions in terms of a, b, and c. Completing the square is one of several ways for deriving the formula.\nSolutions to problems that can be expressed in terms of quadratic equations were known as early as 2000 BC.\nThe quadratic equation contains only powers of ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n⁠ that are non-negative integers, and therefore it is a polynomial equation. In particular, it is a second-degree polynomial equation, since the greatest power is two.\n\n\nSolving the quadratic equation\n\nA quadratic equation whose coefficients are real numbers can have either zero, one, or two distinct real-valued solutions, also called roots. When there is only one distinct root, it can be interpreted as two roots with the same value, called a double root. When there are no real roots, the coefficients can be considered as complex numbers with zero imaginary part, and the quadratic equation still has two complex-valued roots, complex conjugates of each-other with a non-zero imaginary part. A quadratic equation whose coefficients are arbitrary complex numbers always has two complex-valued roots which may or may not be distinct.\nThe solutions of a quadratic equation can be found by several alternative methods.\n\n\nFactoring by inspection\nIt may be possible to express a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 as a product (px + q)(rx + s) = 0. In some cases, it is possible, by simple inspection, to determine values of p, q, r, and s that make the two forms equivalent to one another. If the quadratic equation is written in the second form, then the \"Zero Factor Property\" states that the quadratic equation is satisfied if px + q = 0 or rx + s = 0. Solving these two linear equations provides the roots of the quadratic.\nFor most students, factoring by inspection is the first method of solving quadratic equations to which they are exposed. If one is given a quadratic equation in the form x2 + bx + c = 0, the sought factorization has the form (x + q)(x + s), and one has to find two numbers q and s that add up to  b and whose product is c (this is sometimes called \"Vieta's rule\" and is related to Vieta's formulas). As an example, x2 + 5x + 6 factors as (x + 3)(x + 2). The more general case where a does not equal 1 can require a considerable effort in trial and error guess-and-check, assuming that it can be factored at all by inspection.\nExcept for special cases such as where b = 0 or c = 0, factoring by inspection only works for quadratic equations that have rational roots. This means that the great majority of quadratic equations that arise in practical applications cannot be solved by factoring by inspection.\n\n\nCompleting the square\n\nThe process of completing the square makes use of the algebraic identity\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        2\n        h\n        x\n        +\n        \n          h\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        (\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{2}+2hx+h^{2}=(x+h)^{2},}\n  \n\nwhich represents a well-defined algorithm that can be used to solve any quadratic equation. Starting with a quadratic equation in standard form, ax2 + bx + c = 0 \n\nDivide each side by a, the coefficient of the squared term.\nSubtract the constant term c/a from both sides.\nAdd the square of one-half of b/a, the coefficient of x, to both sides. This \"completes the square\", converting the left side into a perfect square.\nWrite the left side as a square and simplify the right side if necessary.\nProduce two linear equations by equating the square root of the left side with the positive and negative square roots of the right side.\nSolve each of the two linear equations.\nWe illustrate use of this algorithm by solving 2x2 + 4x − 4 = 0\n\n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        4\n        x\n        −\n        4\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2x^{2}+4x-4=0}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n         \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        2\n        x\n        −\n        2\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ x^{2}+2x-2=0}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n         \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        2\n        x\n        =\n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ x^{2}+2x=2}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n         \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        2\n        x\n        +\n        1\n        =\n        2\n        +\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ x^{2}+2x+1=2+1}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              x\n              +\n              1\n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left(x+1\\right)^{2}=3}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n         \n        x\n        +\n        1\n        =\n        ±\n        \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ x+1=\\pm {\\sqrt {3}}}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n         \n        x\n        =\n        −\n        1\n        ±\n        \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ x=-1\\pm {\\sqrt {3}}}\n  \n\nThe plus–minus symbol \"±\" indicates that both \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        −\n        1\n        +\n        \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle x=-1+{\\sqrt {3}}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        −\n        1\n        −\n        \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle x=-1-{\\sqrt {3}}}\n  \n are solutions of the quadratic equation.\n\n\nQuadratic formula and its derivation\n\nCompleting the square can be used to derive a general formula for solving quadratic equations, called the quadratic formula.

These result in slightly different forms for the solution, but are otherwise equivalent.\nA number of alternative derivations can be found in the literature. These proofs are simpler than the standard completing the square method, represent interesting applications of other frequently used techniques in algebra, or offer insight into other areas of mathematics.\nA lesser known quadratic formula, as used in Muller's method, provides the same roots via the equation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              2\n              c\n            \n            \n              −\n              b\n              ±\n              \n                \n                  \n                    b\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                  −\n                  4\n                  a\n                  c\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x={\\frac {2c}{-b\\pm {\\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}}.}\n  \n \nThis can be deduced from the standard quadratic formula by Vieta's formulas, which assert that the product of the roots is c/a.

By contrast, in this case, the more common formula has a division by zero for one root and an indeterminate form 0/0 for the other root. On the other hand, when c = 0, the more common formula yields two correct roots whereas this form yields the zero root and an indeterminate form 0/0.\nWhen neither a nor c is zero, the equality between the standard quadratic formula and Muller's method,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              2\n              c\n            \n            \n              −\n              b\n              −\n              \n                \n                  \n                    b\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                  −\n                  4\n                  a\n                  c\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              −\n              b\n              +\n              \n                \n                  \n                    b\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                  −\n                  4\n                  a\n                  c\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              2\n              a\n            \n          \n        \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2c}{-b-{\\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}}={\\frac {-b+{\\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}\\,,}\n  \n\ncan be verified by cross multiplication, and similarly for the other choice of signs.\n\n\nReduced quadratic equation\nIt is sometimes convenient to reduce a quadratic equation so that its leading coefficient is one.

In these expressions i is the imaginary unit.\nThus the roots are distinct if and only if the discriminant is non-zero, and the roots are real if and only if the discriminant is non-negative.\n\n\nGeometric interpretation\n\nThe function f(x) = ax2 + bx + c is a quadratic function. The graph of any quadratic function has the same general shape, which is called a parabola. The location and size of the parabola, and how it opens, depend on the values of a, b, and c. If a > 0, the parabola has a minimum point and opens upward. If a < 0, the parabola has a maximum point and opens downward. The extreme point of the parabola, whether minimum or maximum, corresponds to its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex will be located at \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          =\n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  −\n                  b\n                \n                \n                  2\n                  a\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle x={\\tfrac {-b}{2a}}}\n  \n, and the y-coordinate of the vertex may be found by substituting this x-value into the function. The y-intercept is located at the point (0, c).\nThe solutions of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 correspond to the roots of the function f(x) = ax2 + bx + c, since they are the values of x for which f(x) = 0. If a, b, and c are real numbers and the domain of f is the set of real numbers, then the roots of f are exactly the x-coordinates of the points where the graph touches the x-axis. If the discriminant is positive, the graph touches the x-axis at two points; if zero, the graph touches at one point; and if negative, the graph does not touch the x-axis.\n\n\nQuadratic factorization\nThe term\n\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        −\n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x-r}\n  \n\nis a factor of the polynomial\n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        b\n        x\n        +\n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c}\n  \n\nif and only if r is a root of the quadratic equation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        b\n        x\n        +\n        c\n        =\n        0.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=0.}\n  \n\nIt follows from the quadratic formula that\n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        b\n        x\n        +\n        c\n        =\n        a\n        \n          (\n          \n            x\n            −\n            \n              \n                \n                  −\n                  b\n                  +\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        b\n                        \n                          2\n                        \n                      \n                      −\n                      4\n                      a\n                      c\n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  2\n                  a\n                \n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        \n          (\n          \n            x\n            −\n            \n              \n                \n                  −\n                  b\n                  −\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        b\n                        \n                          2\n                        \n                      \n                      −\n                      4\n                      a\n                      c\n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  2\n                  a\n                \n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=a\\left(x-{\\frac {-b+{\\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}\\right)\\left(x-{\\frac {-b-{\\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}\\right).}\n  \n\nIn the special case b2 = 4ac where the quadratic has only one distinct root (i.e. the discriminant is zero), the quadratic polynomial can be factored as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        b\n        x\n        +\n        c\n        =\n        a\n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              x\n              +\n              \n                \n                  b\n                  \n                    2\n                    a\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=a\\left(x+{\\frac {b}{2a}}\\right)^{2}.}\n  \n\n\nGraphical solution\n\nThe solutions of the quadratic equation \n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        b\n        x\n        +\n        c\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=0}\n  \n\nmay be obtained from the graph of the quadratic function\n\n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        a\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        b\n        x\n        +\n        c\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c,}\n  \n\nwhich is a parabola.\nIf the parabola intersects the x-axis in two points, there are two real roots, which are the x-coordinates of these two points (also called x-intercept).\nIf the parabola is tangent to the x-axis, there is a double root, which is the x-coordinate of the contact point between the graph and parabola.\nIf the parabola does not intersect the x-axis, there are two complex conjugate roots.

In this context, the quadratic formula is not completely stable.\nThis occurs when the roots have different order of magnitude, or, equivalently, when b2 and b2 − 4ac are close in magnitude.

The Egyptian Berlin Papyrus, dating back to the Middle Kingdom (2050 BC to 1650 BC), contains the solution to a two-term quadratic equation. Babylonian mathematicians from circa 400 BC and Chinese mathematicians from circa 200 BC used geometric methods of dissection to solve quadratic equations with positive roots. Rules for quadratic equations were given in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, a Chinese treatise on mathematics. These early geometric methods do not appear to have had a general formula. Euclid, the Greek mathematician, produced a more abstract geometrical method around 300 BC. With a purely geometric approach Pythagoras and Euclid created a general procedure to find solutions of the quadratic equation. In his work Arithmetica, the Greek mathematician Diophantus solved the quadratic equation, but giving only one root, even when both roots were positive.\nIn 628 AD, Brahmagupta, an Indian mathematician, gave in his book Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta the first explicit (although still not completely general) solution of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx = c as follows: \"To the absolute number multiplied by four times the [coefficient of the] square, add the square of the [coefficient of the] middle term; the square root of the same, less the [coefficient of the] middle term, being divided by twice the [coefficient of the] square is the value.\" This is equivalent to\n\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  4\n                  a\n                  c\n                  +\n                  \n                    b\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              −\n              b\n            \n            \n              2\n              a\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x={\\frac {{\\sqrt {4ac+b^{2}}}-b}{2a}}.}\n  \n\nThe Bakhshali Manuscript written in India in the 7th century AD contained an algebraic formula for solving quadratic equations, as well as linear indeterminate equations (originally of type ax/c = y).\nMuhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (9th century) developed a set of formulas that worked for positive solutions. Al-Khwarizmi goes further in providing a full solution to the general quadratic equation, accepting one or two numerical answers for every quadratic equation, while providing geometric proofs in the process. He also described the method of completing the square and recognized that the discriminant must be positive, which was proven by his contemporary 'Abd al-Hamīd ibn Turk (Central Asia, 9th century) who gave geometric figures to prove that if the discriminant is negative, a quadratic equation has no solution. While al-Khwarizmi himself did not accept negative solutions, later Islamic mathematicians that succeeded him accepted negative solutions, as well as irrational numbers as solutions. Abū Kāmil Shujā ibn Aslam (Egypt, 10th century) in particular was the first to accept irrational numbers (often in the form of a square root, cube root or fourth root) as solutions to quadratic equations or as coefficients in an equation. The 9th century Indian mathematician Sridhara wrote down rules for solving quadratic equations.\nThe Jewish mathematician Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi (12th century, Spain) authored the first European book to include the full solution to the general quadratic equation. His solution was largely based on Al-Khwarizmi's work. The writing of the Chinese mathematician Yang Hui (1238–1298 AD) is the first known one in which quadratic equations with negative coefficients of 'x' appear, although he attributes this to the earlier Liu Yi. By 1545 Gerolamo Cardano compiled the works related to the quadratic equations. The quadratic formula covering all cases was first obtained by Simon Stevin in 1594. In 1637 René Descartes published La Géométrie containing the quadratic formula in the form we know today.\n\n\nAdvanced topics\n\n\nAlternative methods of root calculation\n\n\nVieta's formulas\n\nVieta's formulas (named after François Viète) are the relations\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        −\n        \n          \n            b\n            a\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            c\n            a\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1}+x_{2}=-{\\frac {b}{a}},\\quad x_{1}x_{2}={\\frac {c}{a}}}\n  \n \nbetween the roots of a quadratic polynomial and its coefficients.

The figure shows the difference between (i) a direct evaluation using the quadratic formula (accurate when the roots are near each other in value) and (ii) an evaluation based upon the above approximation of Vieta's formulas (accurate when the roots are widely spaced). As the linear coefficient b increases, initially the quadratic formula is accurate, and the approximate formula improves in accuracy, leading to a smaller difference between the methods as b increases. However, at some point the quadratic formula begins to lose accuracy because of round off error, while the approximate method continues to improve. Consequently, the difference between the methods begins to increase as the quadratic formula becomes worse and worse.\nThis situation arises commonly in amplifier design, where widely separated roots are desired to ensure a stable operation (see Step response).\n\n\nTrigonometric solution\nIn the days before calculators, people would use mathematical tables—lists of numbers showing the results of calculation with varying arguments—to simplify and speed up computation. Tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions were common in math and science textbooks. Specialized tables were published for applications such as astronomy, celestial navigation and statistics. Methods of numerical approximation existed, called prosthaphaeresis, that offered shortcuts around time-consuming operations such as multiplication and taking powers and roots. Astronomers, especially, were concerned with methods that could speed up the long series of computations involved in celestial mechanics calculations.\nIt is within this context that we may understand the development of means of solving quadratic equations by the aid of trigonometric substitution. Consider the following alternate form of the quadratic equation,\n\nwhere the sign of the ± symbol is chosen so that a and c may both be positive. By substituting\n\nand then multiplying through by cos2(θ) / c, we obtain\n\nIntroducing functions of 2θ and rearranging, we obtain\n\nwhere the subscripts n and p correspond, respectively, to the use of a negative or positive sign in equation [1]. Substituting the two values of θn or θp found from equations [4] or [5] into [2] gives the required roots of [1]. Complex roots occur in the solution based on equation [5] if the absolute value of sin 2θp exceeds unity. The amount of effort involved in solving quadratic equations using this mixed trigonometric and logarithmic table look-up strategy was two-thirds the effort using logarithmic tables alone. Calculating complex roots would require using a different trigonometric form.\nTo illustrate, let us assume we had available seven-place logarithm and trigonometric tables, and wished to solve the

of ways. One way is via Lill's method. The three coefficients a, b, c are drawn with right angles between them as in SA, AB, and BC in Figure 6. A circle is drawn with the start and end point SC as a diameter. If this cuts the middle line AB of the three then the equation has a solution, and the solutions are given by negative of the distance along this line from A divided by the first coefficient a or SA. If a is 1 the coefficients may be read off directly. Thus the solutions in the diagram are −AX1/SA and −AX2/SA.\n\nThe Carlyle circle, named after Thomas Carlyle, has the property that the solutions of the quadratic equation are the horizontal coordinates of the intersections of the circle with the horizontal axis. Carlyle circles have been used to develop ruler-and-compass constructions of regular polygons.\n\n\nGeneralization of quadratic equation\nThe formula and its derivation remain correct if the coefficients a, b and c are complex numbers, or more generally members of any field whose characteristic is not 2. (In a field of characteristic 2, the element 2a is zero and it is impossible to divide by it.)\nThe symbol\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ±\n        \n          \n            \n              b\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            −\n            4\n            a\n            c\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pm {\\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}\n  \n\nin the formula should be understood as \"either of the two elements whose square is b2 − 4ac, if such elements exist\". In some fields, some elements have no square roots and some have two; only zero has just one square root, except in fields of characteristic 2. Even if a field does not contain a square root of some number, there is always a quadratic extension field which does, so the quadratic formula will always make sense as a formula in that extension field.\n\n\nCharacteristic 2\nIn a field of characteristic 2, the quadratic formula, which relies on 2 being a unit, does not hold. Consider the monic quadratic polynomial\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        b\n        x\n        +\n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{2}+bx+c}\n  \n\nover a field of characteristic 2.

Instead, define the 2-root R(c) of c to be a root of the polynomial x2 + x + c, an element of the splitting field of that polynomial. One verifies that R(c) + 1 is also a root.

Because (a + 1)2 = a, a + 1 is the unique solution of the quadratic equation x2 + a = 0. On the other hand, the polynomial x2 + ax + 1 is irreducible over F4, but it splits over F16, where it has the two roots ab and ab + a, where b is a root of x2 + x + a in F16.\nThis is a special case of Artin–Schreier theory.\n\n\nSee also\nSolving quadratic equations with continued fractions\nLinear equation\nCubic function\nQuartic equation\nQuintic equation\nFundamental theorem of algebra\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Quadratic equation\", Encyclopedia of Mathematics, EMS Press, 2001 [1994]\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Quadratic equations\".
