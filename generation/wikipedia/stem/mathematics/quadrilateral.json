  "extract": "In  geometry  a quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon, having four edges (sides) and four corners (vertices). The word is derived from the Latin words quadri, a variant of four, and latus, meaning \"side\". It is also called a tetragon, derived from Greek \"tetra\" meaning \"four\" and \"gon\" meaning \"corner\" or \"angle\", in analogy to other polygons (e.g. pentagon). Since \"gon\" means \"angle\", it is analogously called a quadrangle, or 4-angle.

Simple quadrilaterals are either convex or concave.\nThe interior angles of a simple (and planar) quadrilateral ABCD add up to 360 degrees, that is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ∠\n        A\n        +\n        ∠\n        B\n        +\n        ∠\n        C\n        +\n        ∠\n        D\n        =\n        \n          360\n          \n            ∘\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\angle A+\\angle B+\\angle C+\\angle D=360^{\\circ }.}\n  \n\nThis is a special case of the n-gon interior angle sum formula: S = (n − 2) × 180° (here, n=4).\nAll non-self-crossing quadrilaterals tile the plane, by repeated rotation around the midpoints of their edges.\n\n\nSimple quadrilaterals\nAny quadrilateral that is not self-intersecting is a simple quadrilateral.\n\n\nConvex quadrilateral\n\nIn a convex quadrilateral all interior angles are less than 180°, and the two diagonals both lie inside the quadrilateral.\n\nIrregular quadrilateral: no sides are parallel.\nTrapezium (UK) or trapezoid (US): at least one pair of opposite sides are parallel.  Trapezia (UK) and trapezoids (US) include parallelograms.\nIsosceles trapezium (UK) or isosceles trapezoid (US): one pair of opposite sides are parallel and the base angles are equal in measure. Alternative definitions are a quadrilateral with an axis of symmetry bisecting one pair of opposite sides, or a trapezoid with diagonals of equal length.\nParallelogram: a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. Equivalent conditions are that opposite sides are of equal length; that opposite angles are equal; or that the diagonals bisect each other.  Parallelograms include rhombi (including those rectangles called squares) and rhomboids (including those rectangles called oblongs).  In other words, parallelograms include all rhombi and all rhomboids, and thus also include all rectangles.\nRhombus, rhomb: all four sides are of equal length (equilateral). An equivalent condition is that the diagonals perpendicularly bisect each other.  Informally: \"a pushed-over square\" (but strictly including a square, too).\nRhomboid: a parallelogram in which adjacent sides are of unequal lengths, and some angles are oblique (equiv., having no right angles). Informally: \"a pushed-over oblong\". Not all references agree; some define a rhomboid as a parallelogram that is not a rhombus.\nRectangle: all four angles are right angles (equiangular). An equivalent condition is that the diagonals bisect each other, and are equal in length.  Rectangles include squares and oblongs. Informally: \"a box or oblong\" (including a square).\nSquare (regular quadrilateral): all four sides are of equal length (equilateral), and all four angles are right angles. An equivalent condition is that opposite sides are parallel (a square is a parallelogram), and that the diagonals perpendicularly bisect each other and are of equal length. A quadrilateral is a square if and only if it is both a rhombus and a rectangle (i.e., four equal sides and four equal angles).\nOblong: longer than wide, or wider than long (i.e., a rectangle that is not a square).\nKite: two pairs of adjacent sides are of equal length. This implies that one diagonal divides the kite into congruent triangles, and so the angles between the two pairs of equal sides are equal in measure. It also implies that the diagonals are perpendicular. Kites include rhombi.\n\nTangential quadrilateral: the four sides are tangents to an inscribed circle. A convex quadrilateral is tangential if and only if opposite sides have equal sums.\nTangential trapezoid: a trapezoid where the four sides are tangents to an inscribed circle.\nCyclic quadrilateral: the four vertices lie on a circumscribed circle. A convex quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if opposite angles sum to 180°.\nRight kite: a kite with two opposite right angles. It is a type of cyclic quadrilateral.\nHarmonic quadrilateral: a cyclic quadrilateral such that the products of the lengths of the opposing sides are equal.\nBicentric quadrilateral: it is both tangential and cyclic.\nOrthodiagonal quadrilateral: the diagonals cross at right angles.\nEquidiagonal quadrilateral: the diagonals are of equal length.\nBisect-diagonal quadrilateral: one diagonal bisects the other into equal lengths. Every dart and kite is bisect-diagonal. When both diagonals bisect another, it's a parallelogram.\nEx-tangential quadrilateral: the four extensions of the sides are tangent to an excircle.\nAn equilic quadrilateral has two opposite equal sides that when extended, meet at 60°.\nA Watt quadrilateral is a quadrilateral with a pair of opposite sides of equal length.\nA quadric quadrilateral is a convex quadrilateral whose four vertices all lie on the perimeter of a square.\nA diametric quadrilateral is a cyclic quadrilateral having one of its sides as a diameter of the circumcircle.\nA Hjelmslev quadrilateral is a quadrilateral with two right angles at opposite vertices.\n\n\nConcave quadrilaterals\nIn a concave quadrilateral, one interior angle is bigger than 180°, and one of the two diagonals lies outside the quadrilateral.\n\nA dart (or arrowhead) is a concave quadrilateral with bilateral symmetry like a kite, but where one interior angle is reflex. See Kite.\n\n\nComplex quadrilaterals\n\nA self-intersecting quadrilateral is called variously a cross-quadrilateral, crossed quadrilateral, butterfly quadrilateral or bow-tie quadrilateral. In a crossed quadrilateral, the four \"interior\" angles on either side of the crossing (two acute and two reflex, all on the left or all on the right as the figure is traced out) add up to 720°.\n\nCrossed trapezoid (US) or trapezium (Commonwealth): a crossed quadrilateral in which one pair of nonadjacent sides is parallel (like a trapezoid).\nAntiparallelogram: a crossed quadrilateral in which each pair of nonadjacent sides have equal lengths (like a parallelogram).\nCrossed rectangle: an antiparallelogram whose sides are two opposite sides and the two diagonals of a rectangle, hence having one pair of parallel opposite sides.\nCrossed square: a special case of a crossed rectangle where two of the sides intersect at right angles.\n\n\nSpecial line segments\nThe two diagonals of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect opposite vertices.\nThe two bimedians of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect the midpoints of opposite sides. They intersect at the \"vertex centroid\" of the quadrilateral (see § Remarkable points and lines in a convex quadrilateral below).\nThe four maltitudes of a convex quadrilateral are the perpendiculars to a side—through the midpoint of the opposite side.\n\n\nArea of a convex quadrilateral\nThere are various general formulas for the area K of a convex quadrilateral ABCD with sides a =  AB, b = BC, c = CD and d = DA.\n\n\nTrigonometric formulas\nThe area can be expressed in trigonometric terms as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        K\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        p\n        q\n        sin\n        ⁡\n        θ\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K={\\tfrac {1}{2}}pq\\sin \\theta ,}\n  \n\nwhere the lengths of the diagonals are p and q and the angle between them is θ.

In the latter case the quadrilateral is a tangential quadrilateral.\nIn quadrilateral ABCD, if the angle bisectors of A and C meet on diagonal BD, then the angle bisectors of B and D meet on diagonal AC.\n\n\nBimedians\n\nThe bimedians of a quadrilateral are the line segments connecting the midpoints of the opposite sides. The intersection of the bimedians is the centroid of the vertices of the quadrilateral.\nThe midpoints of the sides of any quadrilateral (convex, concave or crossed) are the vertices of a parallelogram called the Varignon parallelogram. It has the following properties:\n\nEach pair of opposite sides of the Varignon parallelogram are parallel to a diagonal in the original quadrilateral.\nA side of the Varignon parallelogram is half as long as the diagonal in the original quadrilateral it is parallel to.\nThe area of the Varignon parallelogram equals half the area of the original quadrilateral. This is true in convex, concave and crossed quadrilaterals provided the area of the latter is defined to be the difference of the areas of the two triangles it is composed of.\nThe perimeter of the Varignon parallelogram equals the sum of the diagonals of the original quadrilateral.\nThe diagonals of the Varignon parallelogram are the bimedians of the original quadrilateral.\nThe two bimedians in a quadrilateral and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals in that quadrilateral are concurrent and are all bisected by their point of intersection.\nIn a convex quadrilateral with sides a, b, c and d, the length of the bimedian that connects the midpoints of the sides a and c is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            −\n            \n              a\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              b\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            −\n            \n              c\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              d\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              p\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              q\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m={\\tfrac {1}{2}}{\\sqrt {-a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}+d^{2}+p^{2}+q^{2}}}}\n  \n\nwhere p and q are the length of the diagonals.

This is a direct consequence of the fact that the area of a convex quadrilateral satisfies\n\n  \n    \n      \n        K\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        p\n        q\n        sin\n        ⁡\n        \n          θ\n        \n        ≤\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        p\n        q\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K={\\tfrac {1}{2}}pq\\sin {\\theta }\\leq {\\tfrac {1}{2}}pq,}\n  \n\nwhere θ is the angle between the diagonals p and q. Equality holds if and only if θ = 90°.\nIf P is an interior point in a convex quadrilateral ABCD, then\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        P\n        +\n        B\n        P\n        +\n        C\n        P\n        +\n        D\n        P\n        ≥\n        A\n        C\n        +\n        B\n        D\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle AP+BP+CP+DP\\geq AC+BD.}\n  \n\nFrom this inequality it follows that the point inside a quadrilateral that minimizes the sum of distances to the vertices is the intersection of the diagonals. Hence that point is the Fermat point of a convex quadrilateral.\n\n\nRemarkable points and lines in a convex quadrilateral\nThe centre of a quadrilateral can be defined in several different ways. The \"vertex centroid\" comes from considering the quadrilateral as being empty but having equal masses at its vertices. The \"side centroid\" comes from considering the sides to have constant mass per unit length. The usual centre, called just centroid (centre of area) comes from considering the surface of the quadrilateral as having constant density. These three points are in general not all the same point.\nThe \"vertex centroid\" is the intersection of the two bimedians. As with any polygon, the x and y coordinates of the vertex centroid are the arithmetic means of the x and y coordinates of the vertices.\nThe \"area centroid\" of quadrilateral ABCD can be constructed in the following way. Let Ga, Gb, Gc, Gd be the centroids of triangles BCD, ACD, ABD, ABC respectively. Then the \"area centroid\" is the intersection of the lines GaGc and GbGd.\nIn a general convex quadrilateral ABCD, there are no natural analogies to the circumcenter and orthocenter of a triangle. But two such points can be constructed in the following way. Let Oa, Ob, Oc, Od be the circumcenters of triangles BCD, ACD, ABD, ABC respectively; and denote by Ha, Hb, Hc, Hd the orthocenters in the same triangles. Then the intersection of the lines OaOc and ObOd is called the quasicircumcenter, and the intersection of the lines HaHc and HbHd is called the quasiorthocenter of the convex quadrilateral. These points can be used to define an Euler line of a quadrilateral. In a convex quadrilateral, the quasiorthocenter H, the \"area centroid\" G, and the quasicircumcenter O are collinear in this order, and HG = 2GO.\nThere can also be defined a quasinine-point center E as the intersection of the lines EaEc and EbEd, where Ea, Eb, Ec, Ed are the nine-point centers of triangles BCD, ACD, ABD, ABC respectively. Then E is the midpoint of OH.\nAnother remarkable line in a convex non-parallelogram quadrilateral is the Newton line, which connects the midpoints of the diagonals, the segment connecting these points being bisected by the vertex centroid. One more interesting line (in some sense dual to the Newton's one) is the line connecting the point of intersection of diagonals with the vertex centroid. The line is remarkable by the fact that it contains the (area) centroid. The vertex centroid divides the segment connecting the intersection of diagonals and the (area) centroid in the ratio 3:1.\nFor any quadrilateral ABCD with points P and Q the intersections of AD and BC and AB and CD, respectively, the circles (PAB), (PCD), (QAD), and (QBC) pass through a common point M, called a Miquel point.\nFor a convex quadrilateral ABCD in which E is the point of intersection of the diagonals and F is the point of intersection of the extensions of sides BC and AD, let ω be a circle through E and F which meets CB internally at M and DA internally at N. Let CA meet ω again at L and let DB meet ω again at K. Then, applying Pascal's theorem to the hexagons EKNFML and EKMFNL inscribed in ω, there holds: the straight lines NK and ML intersect at point P that is located on the side AB; the straight lines NL and KM intersect at point Q that is located on the side CD. \nPoints P and Q are called \"Pascal points\" formed by circle ω on sides AB and CD.\n\n\nOther properties of convex quadrilaterals\nIf exterior squares are drawn on all sides of a quadrilateral then the segments connecting the centers of opposite squares are (a) equal in length, and (b) perpendicular. Thus these centers are the vertices of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral. This is called Van Aubel's theorem.\nFor any simple quadrilateral with given edge lengths, there is a cyclic quadrilateral with the same edge lengths.\nThe four smaller triangles formed by the diagonals and sides of a convex quadrilateral have the property that the product of the areas of two opposite triangles equals the product of the areas of the other two triangles.\nLet vectors AC and BD form the diagonals from A to C and from B to  D.  The angle \n  \n    \n      \n        θ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n  \n at the intersection of the diagonals satisfies \n  \n    \n      \n        cos\n        ⁡\n        θ\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                b\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              +\n              \n                d\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              −\n              \n                a\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              −\n              \n                c\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              2\n              p\n              q\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cos \\theta ={\\frac {b^{2}+d^{2}-a^{2}-c^{2}}{2pq}},}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        θ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n  \n  is the angle between AC  and BD, and \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        ,\n        q\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p,q}\n  \n are the diagonals of the quadrilateral.\n\n\nTaxonomy\n\nA hierarchical taxonomy of quadrilaterals is illustrated by the figure to the right. Lower classes are special cases of higher classes they are connected to. Note that \"trapezoid\" here is referring to the North American definition (the British equivalent is a trapezium). Inclusive definitions are used throughout.\n\n\nSkew quadrilaterals\n\nA non-planar quadrilateral is called a skew quadrilateral. Formulas to compute its dihedral angles from the edge lengths and the angle between two adjacent edges were derived for work on the properties of molecules such as cyclobutane that contain a \"puckered\" ring of four atoms. Historically the term gauche quadrilateral was also used to mean a skew quadrilateral. A skew  quadrilateral together with its diagonals form a (possibly non-regular) tetrahedron, and conversely every skew quadrilateral comes from a tetrahedron where a pair of opposite edges is removed.\n\n\nSee also\nComplete quadrangle\nPerpendicular bisector construction of a quadrilateral\nSaccheri quadrilateral\nTypes of mesh § Quadrilateral\nQuadrangle (geography)\nHomography - Any quadrilateral can be transformed into another quadrilateral by a projective transformation (homography)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Quadrangle, complete\", Encyclopedia of Mathematics, EMS Press, 2001 [1994]\nQuadrilaterals Formed by Perpendicular Bisectors, Projective Collinearity and  Interactive Classification of Quadrilaterals from cut-the-knot\nDefinitions and examples of quadrilaterals and Definition and properties of tetragons from Mathopenref\nA (dynamic) Hierarchical Quadrilateral Tree at Dynamic Geometry Sketches\nAn extended classification of quadrilaterals Archived 2019-12-30 at the Wayback Machine at Dynamic Math Learning Homepage Archived 2018-08-25 at the Wayback Machine\nThe role and function of a hierarchical classification of quadrilaterals by Michael de Villiers",
