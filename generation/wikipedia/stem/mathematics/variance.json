The standard deviation is obtained as the square root of the variance. Variance is a measure of dispersion, meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers are spread out from their average value. It is the second central moment of a distribution, and the covariance of the random variable with itself, and it is often represented by ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          σ\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma ^{2}}\n  \n⁠, ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          s\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s^{2}}\n  \n⁠, ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        Var\n        ⁡\n        (\n        X\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Var} (X)}\n  \n⁠, ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        (\n        X\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V(X)}\n  \n⁠, or ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          V\n        \n        (\n        X\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {V} (X)}\n  \n⁠.\nAn advantage of variance as a measure of dispersion is that it is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than other measures of dispersion such as the expected absolute deviation; for example, the variance of a sum of uncorrelated random variables is equal to the sum of their variances. A disadvantage of the variance for practical applications is that, unlike the standard deviation, its units differ from the random variable, which is why the standard deviation is more commonly reported as a measure of dispersion once the calculation is finished. Another disadvantage is that the variance is not finite for many distributions.\nThere are two distinct concepts that are both called \"variance\". One, as discussed above, is part of a theoretical probability distribution and is defined by an equation. The other variance is a characteristic of a set of observations. When variance is calculated from observations, those observations are typically measured from a real-world system. If all possible observations of the system are present, then the calculated variance is called the population variance. Normally, however, only a subset is available, and the variance calculated from this is called the sample variance. The variance calculated from a sample is considered an estimate of the full population variance. There are multiple ways to estimate the population variance on the basis of the sample variance, as discussed in the section below.\nThe two kinds of variance are closely related. To see how, consider that a theoretical probability distribution can be used as a generator of hypothetical observations. If an infinite number of observations are generated using a distribution, then the sample variance calculated from that infinite set will match the value calculated using the distribution's equation for variance. Variance has a central role in statistics, where some ideas that use it include descriptive statistics, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, goodness of fit, and Monte Carlo sampling.\n\n\nDefinition\nThe variance of a random variable \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean of ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n⁠, ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        μ\n        =\n        E\n        ⁡\n        [\n        X\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu =\\operatorname {E} [X]}\n  \n⁠:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Var\n        ⁡\n        (\n        X\n        )\n        =\n        E\n        ⁡\n        \n          [\n          \n            (\n            X\n            −\n            μ\n            \n              )\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          ]\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Var} (X)=\\operatorname {E} \\left[(X-\\mu )^{2}\\right].}\n  \n\nThis definition encompasses random variables that are generated by processes that are discrete, continuous, neither, or mixed.

\n\n\nCommonly used probability distributions\nThe following table lists the variance for some commonly used probability distributions.\n\n\nProperties\n\n\nBasic properties\nVariance is non-negative because the squares are positive or zero:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Var\n        ⁡\n        (\n        X\n        )\n        ≥\n        0.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Var}

\\operatorname {Var} (a)=0.}\n  \n\nConversely, if the variance of a random variable is 0, then it is almost surely a constant. That is, it always has the same value:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Var\n        ⁡\n        (\n        X\n        )\n        =\n        0\n        \n        ⟺\n        \n        ∃\n        a\n        :\n        P\n        (\n        X\n        =\n        a\n        )\n        =\n        1.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Var} (X)=0\\iff \\exists a:P(X=a)=1.}\n  \n\n\nIssues of finiteness\nIf a distribution does not have a finite expected value, as is the case for the Cauchy distribution, then the variance cannot be finite either. However, some distributions may not have a finite variance, despite their expected value being finite. An example is a Pareto distribution whose index \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n  \n satisfies \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        <\n        k\n        ≤\n        2.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1<k\\leq 2.}\n  \n\n\nDecomposition\nThe general formula for variance decomposition or the law of total variance is: If \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n  \n are two random variables, and the variance of \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n exists, then\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Var\n        ⁡\n        [\n        X\n        ]\n        =\n        E\n        ⁡\n        (\n        Var\n        ⁡\n        [\n        X\n        ∣\n        Y\n        ]\n        )\n        +\n        Var\n        ⁡\n        (\n        E\n        ⁡\n        [\n        X\n        ∣\n        Y\n        ]\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Var} [X]=\\operatorname {E} (\\operatorname {Var} [X\\mid Y])+\\operatorname {Var} (\\operatorname {E} [X\\mid Y]).}\n  \n\nThe conditional expectation \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        ⁡\n        (\n        X\n        ∣\n        Y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {E} (X\\mid Y)}\n  \n of \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n given \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n  \n, and the conditional variance \n  \n    \n      \n        Var\n        ⁡\n        (\n        X\n        ∣\n        Y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Var} (X\\mid Y)}\n  \n may be understood as follows.

This also holds in the multidimensional case.\n\n\nUnits of measurement\nUnlike the expected absolute deviation, the variance of a variable has units that are the square of the units of the variable itself.  For example, a variable measured in meters will have a variance measured in meters squared.  For this reason, describing data sets via their standard deviation or root mean square deviation is often preferred over using the variance.  In the dice example the standard deviation is √2.9 ≈ 1.7, slightly larger than the expected absolute deviation of 1.5.\nThe standard deviation and the expected absolute deviation can both be used as an indicator of the \"spread\" of a distribution.  The standard deviation is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than the expected absolute deviation, and, together with variance and its generalization covariance, is used frequently in theoretical statistics; however the expected absolute deviation tends to be more robust as it is less sensitive to outliers arising from measurement anomalies or an unduly heavy-tailed distribution.\n\n\nPropagation\n\n\nAddition and multiplication by a constant\nVariance is invariant with respect to changes in a location parameter.

The formula states that the variance of a sum is equal to the sum of all elements in the covariance matrix of the components. The next expression states equivalently that the variance of the sum is the sum of the diagonal of covariance matrix plus two times the sum of its upper triangular elements (or its lower triangular elements); this emphasizes that the covariance matrix is symmetric. This formula is used in the theory of Cronbach's alpha in classical test theory.\nSo, if the variables have equal variance σ2 and the average correlation of distinct variables is ρ, then the variance of their mean is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Var\n        ⁡\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              X\n              ¯\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              σ\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            n\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              n\n              −\n              1\n            \n            n\n          \n        \n        ρ\n        \n          σ\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Var} \\left({\\overline {X}}\\right)={\\frac {\\sigma ^{2}}{n}}+{\\frac {n-1}{n}}\\rho \\sigma ^{2}.}\n  \n\nThis implies that the variance of the mean increases with the average of the correlations. In other words, additional correlated observations are not as effective as additional independent observations at reducing the uncertainty of the mean. Moreover, if the variables have unit variance, for example if they are standardized, then this simplifies to\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Var\n        ⁡\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              X\n              ¯\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            n\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              n\n              −\n              1\n            \n            n\n          \n        \n        ρ\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Var} \\left({\\overline {X}}\\right)={\\frac {1}{n}}+{\\frac {n-1}{n}}\\rho .}\n  \n\nThis formula is used in the Spearman–Brown prediction formula of classical test theory. This converges to ρ if n goes to infinity, provided that the average correlation remains constant or converges too. So for the variance of the mean of standardized variables with equal correlations or converging average correlation we have\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          lim\n          \n            n\n            →\n            ∞\n          \n        \n        Var\n        ⁡\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              X\n              ¯\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        =\n        ρ\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lim _{n\\to \\infty }\\operatorname {Var} \\left({\\overline {X}}\\right)=\\rho .}\n  \n\nTherefore, the variance of the mean of a large number of standardized variables is approximately equal to their average correlation. This makes clear that the sample mean of correlated variables does not generally converge to the population mean, even though the law of large numbers states that the sample mean will converge for independent variables.\n\n\nSum of uncorrelated variables with random sample size\nThere are cases when a sample is taken without knowing, in advance, how many observations will be acceptable according to some criterion.

As such, the variance calculated from the finite set will in general not match the variance that would have been calculated from the full population of possible observations. This means that one estimates the mean and variance from a limited set of observations by using an estimator equation. The estimator is a function of the sample of n observations drawn without observational bias from the whole population of potential observations. In this example, the sample would be the set of actual measurements of yesterday's rainfall from available rain gauges within the geography of interest.\nThe simplest estimators for population mean and population variance are simply the mean and variance of the sample, the sample mean and (uncorrected) sample variance – these are consistent estimators (they converge to the value of the whole population as the number of samples increases) but can be improved. Most simply, the sample variance is computed as the sum of squared deviations about the (sample) mean, divided by n as the number of samples. However, using values other than n improves the estimator in various ways. Four common values for the denominator are n, n − 1, n + 1, and n − 1.5: n is the simplest (the variance of the sample), n − 1 eliminates bias, n + 1 minimizes mean squared error for the normal distribution, and n − 1.5 mostly eliminates bias in unbiased estimation of standard deviation for the normal distribution.\nFirstly, if the true population mean is unknown, then the sample variance (which uses the sample mean in place of the true mean) is a biased estimator: it underestimates the variance by a factor of (n − 1) / n; correcting this factor, resulting in the sum of squared deviations about the sample mean divided by n − 1 instead of n, is called Bessel's correction. The resulting estimator is unbiased and is called the (corrected) sample variance or unbiased sample variance. If the mean is determined in some other way than from the same samples used to estimate the variance, then this bias does not arise, and the variance can safely be estimated as that of the samples about the (independently known) mean.\nSecondly, the sample variance does not generally minimize mean squared error between sample variance and population variance. Correcting for bias often makes this worse: one can always choose a scale factor that performs better than the corrected sample variance, though the optimal scale factor depends on the excess kurtosis of the population (see Mean squared error § Variance) and introduces bias. This always consists of scaling down the unbiased estimator (dividing by a number larger than n − 1) and is a simple example of a shrinkage estimator: one \"shrinks\" the unbiased estimator towards zero. For the normal distribution, dividing by n + 1 (instead of n − 1 or n) minimizes mean squared error. The resulting estimator is biased, however, and is known as the biased sample variation.\n\n\nPopulation variance\nIn general, the population variance of a finite population of size N with values xi

variance of the generating probability distribution. In this sense, the concept of population can be extended to continuous random variables with infinite populations.\n\n\nSample variance\n\n\nBiased sample variance\nIn many practical situations, the true variance of a population is not known a priori and must be computed somehow. When dealing with extremely large populations, it is not possible to count every object in the population, so the computation must be performed on a sample of the population. This is generally referred to as sample variance or empirical variance. Sample variance can also be applied to the estimation of the variance of a continuous distribution from a sample of that distribution.\nWe take a sample with replacement of n values Y1, ..., Yn from the population of size N, where n < N, and estimate the variance on the basis of this sample. Directly taking the variance of the sample data gives the average of the squared deviations:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                S\n                ~\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            Y\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            n\n          \n        \n        \n          ∑\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                Y\n                \n                  i\n                \n              \n              −\n              \n                \n                  Y\n                  ¯\n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                n\n              \n            \n            \n              ∑\n              \n                i\n                =\n                1\n              \n              \n                n\n              \n            \n            \n              Y\n              \n                i\n              \n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        −\n        \n          \n            \n              Y\n              ¯\n            \n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              n\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          ∑\n          \n            i\n            ,\n            j\n            \n            :\n            \n            i\n            <\n            j\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                Y\n                \n                  i\n                \n              \n              −\n              \n                Y\n                \n                  j\n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {S}}_{Y}^{2}={\\frac {1}{n}}\\sum _{i=1}^{n}\\left(Y_{i}-{\\overline {Y}}\\right)^{2}=\\left({\\frac {1}{n}}\\sum _{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}^{2}\\right)-{\\overline {Y}}^{2}={\\frac {1}{n^{2}}}\\sum _{i,j\\,:\\,i<j}\\left(Y_{i}-Y_{j}\\right)^{2}.}\n  \n\n(See the section § Population variance for the derivation of this formula.)

The same proof is also applicable for samples taken from a continuous probability distribution.\nThe use of the term n − 1 is called Bessel's correction, and it is also used in sample covariance and the sample standard deviation (the square root of variance). The square root is a concave function and thus introduces negative bias (by Jensen's inequality), which depends on the distribution, and thus the corrected sample standard deviation (using Bessel's correction) is biased. The unbiased estimation of standard deviation is a technically involved problem, though for the normal distribution using the term n − 1.5 yields an almost unbiased estimator.\nThe unbiased sample variance is a U-statistic for the function f(y1, y2) = (y1 − y2)2/2, meaning that it is obtained by averaging a 2-sample statistic over 2-element subsets of the population.\n\n\nExample\nFor a set of numbers {10, 15, 30, 45, 57, 52, 63, 72, 81, 93, 102, 105}, if this set is the whole data population for some measurement, then variance is the population variance 932.743 as the sum of the squared deviations about the mean of this set, divided by 12 as the number of the set members. If the set is a sample from the whole population, then the unbiased sample variance can be calculated as 1017.538 that is the sum of the squared deviations about the mean of the sample, divided by 11 instead of 12. A function VAR.S in Microsoft Excel gives the unbiased sample variance while VAR.P is for population variance.\n\n\nDistribution of the sample variance\n\nBeing a function of random variables, the sample variance is itself a random variable, and it is natural to study its distribution. In the case that Yi are independent observations from a normal distribution, Cochran's theorem shows that the unbiased sample variance S2 follows a scaled chi-squared distribution (see also: asymptotic properties and an elementary proof):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        n\n        −\n        1\n        )\n        \n          \n            \n              S\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            \n              σ\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        ∼\n        \n          χ\n          \n            n\n            −\n            1\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (n-1){\\frac {S^{2}}{\\sigma ^{2}}}\\sim \\chi _{n-1}^{2}}\n  \n\nwhere σ2 is the population variance.

Non-normality makes testing for the equality of two or more variances more difficult. \nSeveral non parametric tests have been proposed: these include the Barton–David–Ansari–Freund–Siegel–Tukey test, the Capon test, Mood test, the Klotz test and the Sukhatme test. The Sukhatme test applies to two variances and requires that both medians be known and equal to zero. The Mood, Klotz, Capon and Barton–David–Ansari–Freund–Siegel–Tukey tests also apply to two variances. They allow the median to be unknown but do require that the two medians are equal.\nThe Lehmann test is a parametric test of two variances. Of this test there are several variants known. Other tests of the equality of variances include the Box test, the Box–Anderson test and the Moses test.\nResampling methods, which include the bootstrap and the jackknife, may be used to test the equality of variances.\n\n\nMoment of inertia\n\nThe variance of a probability distribution is analogous to the  moment of inertia in classical mechanics of a corresponding mass distribution along a line, with respect to rotation about its center of mass.  It is because of this analogy that such things as the variance are called moments of probability distributions. The covariance matrix is related to the moment of inertia tensor for multivariate distributions.

For skewed distributions, the semivariance can provide additional information that a variance does not.\nFor inequalities associated with the semivariance, see Chebyshev's inequality § Semivariances.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe term variance was first introduced by Ronald Fisher in his 1918 paper The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance:\n\nThe great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          σ\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{1}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          σ\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{2}}\n  \n, it is found that the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard deviation \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              σ\n              \n                1\n              \n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              σ\n              \n                2\n              \n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {\\sigma _{1}^{2}+\\sigma _{2}^{2}}}}\n  \n.
