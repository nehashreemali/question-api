The ratio is called coefficient of proportionality (or proportionality constant) and its reciprocal is known as constant of normalization (or normalizing constant). Two sequences are inversely proportional if corresponding elements have a constant product.\nTwo functions \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle g(x)}\n  \n are proportional if their ratio \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              f\n              (\n              x\n              )\n            \n            \n              g\n              (\n              x\n              )\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle {\\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}}}\n  \n is a constant function.\nIf several pairs of variables share the same direct proportionality constant, the equation expressing the equality of these ratios is called a proportion, e.g., ⁠a/b⁠ = ⁠x/y⁠ = ⋯ = k (for details see Ratio).\nProportionality is closely related to linearity.\n\n\nDirect proportionality\n\nGiven an independent variable x and a dependent variable y, y is directly proportional to x if there is a positive constant k such that:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        k\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=kx.}\n  \n\nThe relation is often denoted using the symbols ∝ (not to be confused with the Greek letter alpha) or ~, with exception of Japanese texts, where ~ is reserved for intervals:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        ∝\n        x\n        \n        \n          or\n        \n        \n        y\n        ∼\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y\\propto x\\quad {\\text{or}}\\quad y\\sim x.}\n  \n\nFor x ≠ 0 the proportionality constant can be expressed as the ratio:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        k\n        =\n        \n          \n            y\n            x\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k={\\frac {y}{x}}.}\n  \n\nIt is also called the constant of variation or constant of proportionality. \nGiven such a constant k, the proportionality relation ∝ with proportionality constant k between two sets A and B is the equivalence relation defined by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        ∈\n        A\n        ×\n        B\n        :\n        a\n        =\n        k\n        b\n        }\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{(a,b)\\in A\\times B:a=kb\\}.}\n  \n\nA direct proportionality can also be viewed as a linear equation in two variables with a y-intercept of 0 and a slope of k > 0, which corresponds to linear growth.\n\n\nExamples\nIf an object travels at a constant speed, then the distance traveled is directly proportional to the time spent traveling, with the speed being the constant of proportionality.\nThe circumference of a circle is directly proportional to its diameter, with the constant of proportionality equal to π.\nOn a map of a sufficiently small geographical area, drawn to scale distances, the distance between any two points on the map is directly proportional to the beeline distance between the two locations represented by those points; the constant of proportionality is the scale of the map.\nThe force, acting on a small object with small mass by a nearby large extended mass due to gravity, is directly proportional to the object's mass; the constant of proportionality between the force and the mass is known as gravitational acceleration.\nThe net force acting on an object is proportional to the acceleration of that object with respect to an inertial frame of reference. The constant of proportionality in this, Newton's second law, is the classical mass of the object.\n\n\nInverse proportionality\n\nTwo variables are inversely proportional (also called varying inversely, in inverse variation, in inverse proportion) if each of the variables is directly proportional to the multiplicative inverse (reciprocal) of the other, or equivalently if their product is a constant. It follows that the variable y is inversely proportional to the variable x if there exists a non-zero constant k such that\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        \n          \n            k\n            x\n          \n        \n        \n        \n        ⟺\n        \n        \n        x\n        y\n        =\n        k\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y={\\frac {k}{x}}\\quad \\iff \\quad xy=k.}\n  \n\nHence the constant k is the product of x and y.\nThe graph of two variables varying inversely on the Cartesian coordinate plane is a rectangular hyperbola. The product of the x and y values of each point on the curve equals the constant of proportionality k. Since neither x nor y can equal zero (because k is non-zero), the graph never crosses either axis.\nDirect and inverse proportion contrast as follows: in direct proportion the variables increase or decrease together. With inverse proportion, an increase in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other. For instance, in travel, a constant speed dictates a direct proportion between distance and time travelled; in contrast, for a given distance (the constant), the time of travel is inversely proportional to speed: s × t = d.\n\n\nHyperbolic coordinates\n\nThe concepts of direct and inverse proportion lead to the location of points in the Cartesian plane by hyperbolic coordinates; the two coordinates correspond to the constant of direct proportionality that specifies a point as being on a particular ray and the constant of inverse proportionality that specifies a point as being on a particular hyperbola.\n\n\nComputer encoding\nThe Unicode characters for proportionality are the following:\n\nU+221D ∝ PROPORTIONAL TO (&prop;, &Proportional;, &propto;, &varpropto;, &vprop;)\nU+007E ~ TILDE\nU+2237 ∷ PROPORTION\nU+223C ∼ TILDE OPERATOR (&sim;, &thicksim;, &thksim;, &Tilde;)\nU+223A ∺ GEOMETRIC PROPORTION (&mDDot;)\n\n\nSee also\nLinear map\nCorrelation\nEudoxus of Cnidus\nGolden ratio\nInverse-square law\nProportional font\nRatio\nRule of three (mathematics)\nSample size\nSimilarity\nTrairāśika\nBasic proportionality theorem\nLinear growth\nHyperbolic growth\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nBurrell, Brian: Merriam-Webster's Guide to Everyday Math: A Home and Business Reference.
