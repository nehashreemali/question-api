Often denoted by the letter m, slope is calculated as the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change (\"rise over run\") between two distinct points on the line, giving the same A slope is the ratio of the vertical distance (rise) to the horizontal distance (run) between two points, not a direct distance or a direct angle for any choice of points. To explain, a slope is the ratio of the vertical distance (rise) to the horizontal distance (run) between two points, not a direct distance or a direct angle\nThe line may be physical – as set by a road surveyor, pictorial as in a diagram of a road or roof, or abstract.\nAn application of the mathematical concept is found in the grade or gradient in geography and civil engineering. \nThe steepness, incline, or grade of a line is the absolute value of its slope: greater absolute value indicates a steeper line.

Neglecting the Earth's curvature, if the two points have horizontal distance x1 and x2 from a fixed point, the run is (x2 − x1) = Δx.

When the curve is approximated by a series of points, the slope of the curve may be approximated by the slope of the secant line between two nearby points. When the curve is given as the graph of an algebraic expression, calculus gives formulas for the slope at each point. Slope is thus one of the central ideas of calculus and its applications to design.\n\n\nNotation\nThere seems to be no clear answer as to why the letter m is used for slope, but it first appears in English in O'Brien (1844) who introduced the equation of a line as \"y = mx + b\", and it can also be found in Todhunter (1888) who wrote \"y = mx + c\".\n\n\nDefinition\n\nThe slope of a line in the plane containing the x and y axes is generally represented by the letter m, and is defined as the change in the y coordinate divided by the corresponding change in the x coordinate, between two distinct points on the line.

For non-linear functions, the rate of change varies along the curve. The derivative of the function at a point is the slope of the line tangent to the curve at the point and is thus equal to the rate of change of the function at that point.\nIf we let Δx and Δy be the distances (along the x and y axes, respectively) between two points on a curve, then the slope given by the above definition,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              Δ\n              y\n            \n            \n              Δ\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m={\\frac {\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}}}\n  \n,\nis the slope of a secant line to the curve. For a line, the secant between any two points is the line itself, but this is not the case for any other type of curve.\nFor example, the slope of the secant intersecting y = x2 at (0,0) and (3,9) is 3. (The slope of the tangent at x = 3⁄2 is also 3 − a consequence of the mean value theorem.)\nBy moving the two points closer together so that Δy and Δx decrease, the secant line more closely approximates a tangent line to the curve, and as such the slope of the secant approaches that of the tangent. Using differential calculus, we can determine the limit, or the value that Δy/Δx approaches as Δy and Δx get closer to zero; it follows that this limit is the exact slope of the tangent. If y is dependent on x, then it is sufficient to take the limit where only Δx approaches zero. Therefore, the slope of the tangent is the limit of Δy/Δx as Δx approaches zero, or dy/dx. We call this limit the derivative.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                d\n              \n              y\n            \n            \n              \n                d\n              \n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          lim\n          \n            Δ\n            x\n            →\n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              Δ\n              y\n            \n            \n              Δ\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} y}{\\mathrm {d} x}}=\\lim _{\\Delta x\\to 0}{\\frac {\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}}}\n  \n\nThe value of the derivative at a specific point on the function provides us with the slope of the tangent at that precise location. For example, let y = x2. A point on this function is (−2,4). The derivative of this function is dy⁄dx = 2x. So the slope of the line tangent to y at (−2,4) is 2 ⋅ (−2) = −4. The equation of this tangent line is: y − 4 = (−4)(x − (−2)) or y = −4x − 4.\n\n\nDifference of slopes\n\nAn extension of the idea of angle follows from the difference of slopes.

This invariance of slope differences makes slope an angular invariant measure, on a par with circular angle (invariant under rotation) and hyperbolic angle, with invariance group of squeeze mappings.\n\n\nSlope (pitch) of a roof\n\nThe slope of a roof, traditionally and commonly called the roof pitch, in carpentry and architecture in the US is commonly described in terms of integer fractions of one foot (geometric tangent, rise over run), a legacy of British imperial measure. Other units are in use in other locales, with similar conventions. For details, see roof pitch.\n\n\nSlope of a road or railway\n\nThere are two common ways to describe the steepness of a road or railroad. One is by the angle between 0° and 90° (in degrees), and the other is by the slope in a percentage. See also steep grade railway and rack railway.\nThe formulae for converting a slope given as a percentage into an angle in degrees and vice versa are: \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          angle\n        \n        =\n        arctan\n        ⁡\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              slope\n              \n                100\n                %\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{angle}}=\\arctan \\left({\\frac {\\text{slope}}{100\\%}}\\right)}\n  \n (this is the inverse function of tangent; see trigonometry)\nand\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            slope\n          \n        \n        =\n        100\n        %\n        ×\n        tan\n        ⁡\n        (\n        \n          \n            angle\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mbox{slope}}=100\\%\\times \\tan({\\mbox{angle}}),}\n  \n\nwhere angle is in degrees and the trigonometric functions operate in degrees. For example, a slope of 100% or 1000‰ is an angle of 45°.\nA third way is to give one unit of rise in say 10, 20, 50 or 100 horizontal units, e.g. 1:10. 1:20, 1:50 or 1:100 (or \"1 in 10\", \"1 in 20\", etc.) 1:10 is steeper than 1:20. For example, steepness of 20% means 1:5 or an incline with angle 11.3°.\nRoads and railways have both longitudinal slopes and cross slopes.\n\n\nOther uses\nThe concept of a slope or gradient is also used as a basis for developing other applications in mathematics:\n\nGradient descent, a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function\nGradient theorem, theorem that a line integral through a gradient field can be evaluated by evaluating the original scalar field at the endpoints of the curve\nGradient method, an algorithm to solve problems with search directions defined by the gradient of the function at the current point\nConjugate gradient method, an algorithm for the numerical solution of particular systems of linear equations\nNonlinear conjugate gradient method, generalizes the conjugate gradient method to nonlinear optimization\nStochastic gradient descent, iterative method for optimizing a differentiable objective function\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Slope of a Line (Coordinate Geometry)\".
