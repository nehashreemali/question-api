When spoken in everyday English, a fraction describes how many parts of a certain size there are, for example, one-half, eight-fifths, three-quarters. A common, vulgar, or simple fraction (examples: ⁠1/2⁠ and ⁠17/3⁠) consists of an integer numerator, displayed above a line (or before a slash like 1⁄2), and a non-zero integer denominator, displayed below (or after) that line. If these integers are positive, then the numerator represents a number of equal parts, and the denominator indicates how many of those parts make up a unit or a whole. For example, in the fraction ⁠3/4⁠, the numerator 3 indicates that the fraction represents 3 equal parts, and the denominator 4 indicates that 4 parts make up a whole. The picture to the right illustrates ⁠3/4⁠ of a cake.\nFractions can be used to represent ratios and division. Thus the fraction ⁠3/4⁠ can be used to represent the ratio 3:4 (the ratio of the part to the whole), and the division 3 ÷ 4 (three divided by four).\nWe can also write negative fractions, which represent the opposite of a positive fraction. For example, if ⁠1/2⁠ represents a half-dollar profit, then −⁠1/2⁠ represents a half-dollar loss. Because of the rules of division of signed numbers (which states in part that negative divided by positive is negative), −⁠1/2⁠, ⁠−1/2⁠ and ⁠1/−2⁠ all represent the same fraction –  negative one-half. And because a negative divided by a negative produces a positive, ⁠−1/−2⁠ represents positive one-half.\nIn mathematics a rational number is a number that can be represented by a fraction of the form ⁠a/b⁠, where a and b are integers and b is not zero; the set of all rational numbers is commonly represented by the symbol ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Q\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} }\n  \n⁠ or Q, which stands for quotient. The term fraction and the notation ⁠a/b⁠ can also be used for mathematical expressions that do not represent a rational number (for example \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                2\n              \n              2\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\frac {\\sqrt {2}}{2}}}\n  \n), or even do not represent any number (for example the rational fraction \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\frac {1}{x}}}\n  \n).\nA rational number, expressed as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            p\n            q\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {p}{q}}}\n  \n where p and q are Coprime integers and is in base \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {b}}\n  \n, has a terminating representation in base \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          b\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {b}}\n  \n if and only if q divides a power of b, or \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            p\n            q\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            C\n            \n              b\n              \n                n\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {p}{q}}={\\frac {C}{b^{n}}}}\n  \n,for some \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {C}}\n  \n and some integer \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          n\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {n}}\n  \n > 0.\nBy cross multiplying, the equality is equivalent to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          q\n          C\n        \n        =\n        \n          p\n          \n            b\n            \n              n\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {qC}={pb^{n}}}\n  \n.

As an example, the fraction ⁠8/5⁠ amounts to eight parts, each of which is of the type named fifth. In terms of division, the numerator corresponds to the dividend, and the denominator corresponds to the divisor.\nInformally, the numerator and denominator may be distinguished by placement alone, but in formal contexts they are usually separated by a fraction bar. The fraction bar may be horizontal (as in ⁠1/3⁠), oblique (as in 2/5), or diagonal (as in 4⁄9). These marks are respectively known as the horizontal bar; the virgule, slash (US), or stroke (UK); and the fraction bar, solidus, or fraction slash. In typography, fractions stacked vertically are also known as en or nut fractions, and diagonal ones as em or mutton fractions, based on whether a fraction with a single-digit numerator and denominator occupies the proportion of a narrow en square, or a wider em square. In traditional typefounding, a piece of type bearing a complete fraction (e.g. ⁠1/2⁠) was known as a case fraction, while those representing only parts of fractions were called piece fractions.\nThe denominators of English fractions are generally expressed as ordinal numbers, in the plural if the numerator is not 1. (For example, ⁠2/5⁠ and ⁠3/5⁠ are both read as a number of fifths.) Exceptions include the denominator 2, which is always read half or halves, the denominator 4, which may be alternatively expressed as quarter/quarters or as fourth/fourths, and the denominator 100, which may be alternatively expressed as hundredth/hundredths or percent.\nWhen the denominator is 1, it may be expressed in terms of wholes but is more commonly ignored, with the numerator read out as a whole number. For example, ⁠3/1⁠ may be described as three wholes, or simply as three. When the numerator is 1, it may be omitted (as in a tenth or each quarter).\nThe entire fraction may be expressed as a single composition, in which case it is hyphenated, or as a number of fractions with a numerator of one, in which case they are not. (For example, two-fifths is the fraction ⁠2/5⁠ and two fifths is the same fraction understood as 2 instances of ⁠1/5⁠.) Fractions should always be hyphenated when used as adjectives. Alternatively, a fraction may be described by reading it out as the numerator over the denominator, with the denominator expressed as a cardinal number. (For example, ⁠3/1⁠ may also be expressed as three over one.) The term over is used even in the case of solidus fractions, where the numbers are placed left and right of a slash mark. (For example, 1/2 may be read one-half, one half, or one over two.) Fractions with large denominators that are not powers of ten are often rendered in this fashion (e.g., ⁠1/117⁠ as one over one hundred seventeen), while those with denominators divisible by ten are typically read in the normal ordinal fashion (e.g., ⁠6/1000000⁠ as six-millionths, six millionths, or six one-millionths).\n\n\nForms of fractions\n\n\nSimple, common, or vulgar fractions\nA simple fraction (also known as a common fraction or vulgar fraction) is a rational number written as a/b or ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              b\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {a}{b}}}\n  \n⁠, where a and b are both integers. As with other fractions, the denominator (b) cannot be zero. Examples include ⁠1/2⁠, −⁠8/5⁠, ⁠−8/5⁠, and ⁠8/−5⁠. The term was originally used to distinguish this type of fraction from the sexagesimal fraction used in astronomy.\nCommon fractions can be positive or negative, and they can be proper or improper (see below). Compound fractions, complex fractions, mixed numerals, and decimal expressions (see below) are not common fractions; though, unless irrational, they can be evaluated to a common fraction.\n\nA unit fraction is a common fraction with a numerator of 1 (e.g., ⁠1/7⁠). Unit fractions can also be expressed using negative exponents, as in 2−1, which represents 1/2, and 2−2, which represents 1/(22) or 1/4.\nA dyadic fraction is a common fraction in which the denominator is a power of two, e.g. ⁠1/8⁠ = ⁠1/23⁠.\nIn Unicode, precomposed fraction characters are in the Number Forms block.\n\n\nProper and improper fractions\nCommon fractions can be classified as either proper or improper. When the numerator and the denominator are both positive, the fraction is called proper if the numerator is less than the denominator, and improper otherwise. The concept of an improper fraction is a late development, with the terminology deriving from the fact that fraction means \"piece\", so a proper fraction must be less than 1. This was explained in the 17th century textbook The Ground of Arts.\nIn general, a common fraction is said to be a proper fraction if the absolute value of the fraction is strictly less than one—that is, if the fraction is greater than −1 and less than 1. It is said to be an improper fraction, or sometimes top-heavy fraction, if the absolute value of the fraction is greater than or equal to 1. Examples of proper fractions are 2/3, −3/4, and 4/9, whereas examples of improper fractions are 9/4, −4/3, and 3/3. As described below, any improper fraction can be converted to a mixed number (integer plus proper fraction), and vice versa.\n\n\nReciprocals and the invisible denominator\nThe reciprocal of a fraction is another fraction with the numerator and denominator exchanged. The reciprocal of ⁠3/7⁠, for instance, is ⁠7/3⁠. The product of a non-zero fraction and its reciprocal is 1, hence the reciprocal is the multiplicative inverse of a fraction. The reciprocal of a proper fraction is improper, and the reciprocal of an improper fraction not equal to 1 (that is, numerator and denominator are not equal) is a proper fraction.\nWhen the numerator and denominator of a fraction are equal (for example, ⁠7/7⁠), its value is 1, and the fraction therefore is improper. Its reciprocal is identical and hence also equal to 1 and improper.\nAny integer can be written as a fraction with the number one as denominator. For example, 17 can be written as ⁠17/1⁠, where 1 is sometimes referred to as the invisible denominator. Therefore, every fraction and every integer, except for zero, has a reciprocal. For example, the reciprocal of 17 is ⁠1/17⁠.\n\n\nRatios\nA ratio is a relationship between two or more numbers that can be sometimes expressed as a fraction. Typically, a number of items are grouped and compared in a ratio, specifying numerically the relationship between each group. Ratios are expressed as \"group 1 to group 2 ... to group n\". For example, if a car lot had 12 vehicles, of which\n\n2 are white,\n6 are red, and\n4 are yellow,\nthen the ratio of red to white to yellow cars is 6 to 2 to 4. The ratio of yellow cars to white cars is 4 to 2 and may be expressed as 4:2 or 2:1.\nA ratio is often converted to a fraction when it is expressed as a ratio to the whole. In the above example, the ratio of yellow cars to all the cars on the lot is 4:12 or 1:3. We can convert these ratios to a fraction, and say that ⁠4/12⁠ of the cars or ⁠1/3⁠ of the cars in the lot are yellow. Therefore, if a person randomly chose one car on the lot, then there is a one in three chance or probability that it would be yellow.\n\n\nDecimal fractions and percentages\nA decimal fraction is a fraction whose denominator is an integer power of ten, commonly expressed using decimal notation, in which the denominator is not given explicitly but is implied by the number of digits to the right of a decimal separator. The separator can be a period ⟨.⟩, interpunct ⟨·⟩, or comma ⟨,⟩, depending on locale. (For examples, see Decimal separator.) Thus, for 0.75 the numerator is 75 and the implied denominator is 10 to the second power, namely, 100, because there are two digits to the right of the decimal separator. In decimal numbers greater than 1 (such as 3.75), the fractional part of the number is expressed by the digits to the right of the separator (with a value of 0.75 in this case). 3.75 can be written either as an improper fraction, ⁠375/100⁠, or as a mixed number, ⁠3+75/100⁠.\nDecimal fractions can also be expressed using scientific notation with negative exponents, such as 6.023×10−7, a convenient alternative to the unwieldy 0.0000006023. The 10−7 represents a denominator of 107. Dividing by 107 moves the decimal point seven places to the left.\nA decimal fraction with infinitely many digits to the right of the decimal separator represents an infinite series. For example, ⁠1/3⁠ = 0.333... represents the infinite series 3/10 + 3/100 + 3/1000 + ....\nAnother kind of fraction is the percentage (from Latin: per centum, meaning \"per hundred\", represented by the symbol %), in which the implied denominator is always 100. Thus, 51% means 51⁄100. Percentages greater than 100 or less than zero are treated in the same way, e.g. 311% means 311⁄100 and −27% means −27⁄100.\nThe related concept of permille, or parts per thousand (ppt), means a denominator of 1000, and this parts-per notation is commonly used with larger denominators, such as million and billion, e.g. 75 parts per million (ppm) means that the proportion is ⁠75/1000000⁠.\nThe choice between fraction and decimal notation is often a matter of taste and context. Fractions are used most often when the denominator is relatively small. By mental calculation, it is easier to multiply 16 by 3⁄16 than to do the same calculation using the fraction's decimal equivalent (0.1875). And it is more precise (exact, in fact) to multiply 15 by 1⁄3, for example, than it is to multiply 15 by any decimal approximation of one third. Monetary values are commonly expressed as decimal fractions with denominator 100, i.e., with two digits after the decimal separator, for example $3.75. However, as noted above, in pre-decimal British currency, shillings and pence were often given the form (but not the meaning) of a fraction, as, for example, \"3/6\", commonly read three and six, means three shillings and sixpence and has no relationship to the fraction three sixths.\n\n\nMixed numbers\nA mixed number (also called a mixed fraction or mixed numeral) is the sum of a non-zero integer and a proper fraction, conventionally written by juxtaposition (or concatenation) of the two parts, without the use of an intermediate plus (+) or minus (−) sign. When the fraction is written horizontally, a space is added between the integer and fraction to separate them.\nAs a basic example, two entire cakes and three quarters of another cake might be written as \n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        \n          \n            \n              3\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2{\\tfrac {3}{4}}}\n  \n cakes or \n  \n    \n      \n        2\n         \n        \n        3\n        \n          /\n        \n        4\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2\\ \\,3/4}\n  \n cakes, with the numeral \n  \n    \n      \n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2}\n  \n representing the whole cakes and the fraction \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              3\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {3}{4}}}\n  \n representing the additional partial cake juxtaposed; this is more concise than the more explicit notation \n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              3\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2+{\\tfrac {3}{4}}}\n  \n cakes. The mixed number ⁠2+3/4⁠ is spoken two and three quarters or two and three fourths, with the integer and fraction portions connected by the word and. Subtraction or negation is applied to the entire mixed numeral, so \n  \n    \n      \n        −\n        2\n        \n          \n            \n              3\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle -2{\\tfrac {3}{4}}}\n  \n means \n  \n    \n      \n        −\n        \n          \n            (\n          \n        \n        2\n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              3\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            )\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle -{\\bigl (}2+{\\tfrac {3}{4}}{\\bigr )}.}\n  \n\nAny mixed number can be converted to an improper fraction by applying the rules of adding unlike quantities: change the measure of one of the unlike quantities so it has the same measure as the other. For example, \n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              3\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              8\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              3\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              11\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2+{\\tfrac {3}{4}}={\\tfrac {8}{4}}+{\\tfrac {3}{4}}={\\tfrac {11}{4}}.}\n  \n Alternatively, one can multiply the whole number part by the denominator, then add the numerator, to get the numerator of the improper fraction, which keeps the same denominator as the improper fraction. Conversely, an improper fraction can be converted to a mixed number using division with remainder, with the mixed number consisting the whole number part as the quotient and the fraction part (if any) being the remainder divided by denominator of the original improper fraction. For example, since 4 goes into 11 twice, with 3 left over, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              11\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        2\n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              3\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {11}{4}}=2+{\\tfrac {3}{4}}.}\n  \n\nIn primary school, teachers often insist that every fractional result should be expressed as a mixed number. Outside school, mixed numbers are commonly used for describing measurements, for instance ⁠2+1/2⁠ hours or 5 3/16 inches, and remain widespread in daily life and in trades, especially in regions that do not use the decimalized metric system. However, scientific measurements typically use the metric system, which is based on decimal fractions, and starting from the secondary school level, mathematics pedagogy treats every fraction uniformly as a rational number, the quotient ⁠p/q⁠ of integers, leaving behind the concepts of improper fraction and mixed number. College students with years of mathematical training are sometimes confused when re-encountering mixed numbers because they are used to the convention that juxtaposition in algebraic expressions means multiplication.\n\n\nHistorical notions\n\n\nEgyptian fraction\nAn Egyptian fraction is the sum of distinct positive unit fractions, for example \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              3\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\\tfrac {1}{3}}}\n  \n.

They have lost their meaning as technical terms and the attributes complex and compound tend to be used in their everyday meaning of consisting of parts.\n\n\nArithmetic with fractions\nLike whole numbers, fractions obey the commutative, associative, and distributive laws, and the rule against division by zero.\nMixed-number arithmetic can be performed either by converting each mixed number to an improper fraction, or by treating each as a sum of integer and fractional parts.\n\n\nEquivalent fractions\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same (non-zero) number results in a fraction that is equivalent to the original fraction. This is true because for any non-zero number \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n, the fraction \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              n\n              n\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {n}{n}}}\n  \n equals 1. Therefore, multiplying by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              n\n              n\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {n}{n}}}\n  \n is the same as multiplying by one, and any number multiplied by one has the same value as the original number. By way of an example, start with the fraction ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{2}}}\n  \n⁠. When the numerator and denominator are both multiplied by 2, the result is ⁠2/4⁠, which has the same value (0.5) as ⁠1/2⁠. To picture this visually, imagine cutting a cake into four pieces; two of the pieces together (⁠2/4⁠) make up half the cake (⁠1/2⁠).\n\n\nSimplifying (reducing) fractions\nDividing the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same non-zero number yields an equivalent fraction: if the numerator and the denominator of a fraction are both divisible by a number (called a factor) greater than 1, then the fraction can be reduced to an equivalent fraction with a smaller numerator and a smaller denominator.

One says that the fraction has been reduced to its lowest terms.\nIf the numerator and the denominator do not share any factor greater than 1, the fraction is already reduced to its lowest terms, and it is said to be irreducible, reduced, or in simplest terms.

When a whole is divided into equal pieces, if fewer equal pieces are needed to make up the whole, then each piece must be larger. When two positive fractions have the same numerator, they represent the same number of parts, but in the fraction with the smaller denominator, the parts are larger.\nOne way to compare fractions with different numerators and denominators is to find a common denominator.

This allows, together with the above rules, to compare all possible fractions.\n\n\nAddition\nThe first rule of addition is that only like quantities can be added; for example, various quantities of quarters. Unlike quantities, such as adding thirds to quarters, must first be converted to like quantities as described below: Imagine a pocket containing two quarters, and another pocket containing three quarters; in total, there are five quarters. Since four quarters is equivalent to one (dollar), this can be represented as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              2\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              3\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              5\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              4\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {2}{4}}+{\\tfrac {3}{4}}={\\tfrac {5}{4}}=1{\\tfrac {1}{4}}}\n  \n.\n\n\nAdding unlike quantities\nTo add fractions containing unlike quantities (e.g. quarters and thirds), it is necessary to convert all amounts to like quantities.

Using the example of a cake, if three small slices of equal size make up a quarter, and four quarters make up a whole, twelve of these small, equal slices make up a whole. Therefore, a third of a quarter is a twelfth. Now consider the numerators. The first fraction, two thirds, is twice as large as one third. Since one third of a quarter is one twelfth, two thirds of a quarter is two twelfth. The second fraction, three quarters, is three times as large as one quarter, so two thirds of three quarters is three times as large as two thirds of one quarter. Thus two thirds times three quarters is six twelfths.\nA short cut for multiplying fractions is called cancellation. Effectively the answer is reduced to lowest terms during multiplication.

For example, to change ⁠1/4⁠ to a decimal expression, divide 1 by 4 (\"4 into 1\"), to obtain exactly 0.25. To change ⁠1/3⁠ to a decimal expression, divide 1... by 3 (\"3 into 1...\"), and stop when the desired precision is obtained, e.g., at four places after the decimal separator (ten-thousandths) as 0.3333. The fraction ⁠1/4⁠ is expressed exactly with only two digits after the decimal separator, while the fraction ⁠1/3⁠ cannot be written exactly as a decimal with a finite number of digits. A decimal expression can be converted to a fraction by removing the decimal separator, using the result as the numerator, and using 1 followed by the same number of zeroes as there are digits to the right of the decimal separator as the denominator.

Sometimes an infinite repeating decimal is required to reach the same precision. Thus, it is often useful to convert repeating digits into fractions.\nA conventional way to indicate a repeating decimal is to place a bar (known as a vinculum) over the digits that repeat, for example 0.789 = 0.789789789.... For repeating patterns that begin immediately after the decimal point, the result of the conversion is the fraction with the pattern as a numerator, and the same number of nines as a denominator. For example:\n\n0.5 = 5/9\n0.62 = 62/99\n0.264 = 264/999\n0.6291 = 6291/9999\nIf leading zeros precede the pattern, the nines are suffixed by the same number of trailing zeros:\n\n0.05 = 5/90\n0.000392 = 392/999000\n0.0012 = 12/9900\nIf a non-repeating set of digits precede the pattern (such as 0.1523987), one may write the number as the sum of the non-repeating and repeating parts, respectively:\n\n0.1523 + 0.0000987\nThen, convert both parts to fractions, and add them using the methods described above:\n\n1523 / 10000 + 987 / 9990000 = 1522464 / 9990000\nAlternatively, algebra can be used, such as below:\n\nLet x = the repeating decimal:\nx = 0.1523987\nMultiply both sides by the power of 10 just great enough (in this case 104) to move the decimal point just before the repeating part of the decimal number:\n10,000x = 1,523.987\nMultiply both sides by the power of 10 (in this case 103) that is the same as the number of places that repeat:\n10,000,000x = 1,523,987.987\nSubtract the two equations from each other (if a = b and c = d, then a − c = b − d):\n10,000,000x − 10,000x = 1,523,987.987 − 1,523.987\nContinue the subtraction operation to clear the repeating decimal:\n9,990,000x = 1,523,987 − 1,523\n9,990,000x = 1,522,464\nDivide both sides by 9,990,000 to represent x as a fraction\nx = ⁠1522464/9990000⁠\n\n\nFractions in abstract mathematics\nIn addition to being of great practical importance, fractions are also studied by mathematicians, who check that the rules for fractions given above are consistent and reliable.

This way the fractions of integers make up the field of the rational numbers.\nMore generally, a and b may be elements of any integral domain R, in which case a fraction is an element of the field of fractions of R. For example, polynomials in one indeterminate, with coefficients from some integral domain D, are themselves an integral domain, call it P. So for a and b elements of P, the generated field of fractions is the field of rational fractions (also known as the field of rational functions).\n\n\nAlgebraic fractions\n\nAn algebraic fraction is the indicated quotient of two algebraic expressions.

These same numbers, however, are not rational fractions with integer coefficients.\nThe term partial fraction is used when decomposing rational fractions into sums of simpler fractions. For example, the rational fraction \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              2\n              x\n            \n            \n              \n                x\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              −\n              1\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2x}{x^{2}-1}}}\n  \n can be decomposed as the sum of two fractions: ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              x\n              +\n              1\n            \n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              x\n              −\n              1\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{x+1}}+{\\frac {1}{x-1}}}\n  \n⁠. This is useful for the computation of antiderivatives of rational functions (see partial fraction decomposition for more).\n\n\nRadical expressions\n\nA fraction may also contain radicals in the numerator or the denominator. If the denominator contains radicals, it can be helpful to rationalize it (compare Simplified form of a radical expression), especially if further operations, such as adding or comparing that fraction to another, are to be carried out. It is also more convenient if division is to be done manually. When the denominator is a monomial square root, it can be rationalized by multiplying both the top and the bottom of the fraction by the denominator:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            3\n            \n              7\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            3\n            \n              7\n            \n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          \n            \n              7\n            \n            \n              7\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              3\n              \n                \n                  7\n                \n              \n            \n            7\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{\\sqrt {7}}}={\\frac {3}{\\sqrt {7}}}\\cdot {\\frac {\\sqrt {7}}{\\sqrt {7}}}={\\frac {3{\\sqrt {7}}}{7}}.}\n  \n\nThe process of rationalization of binomial denominators involves multiplying the top and the bottom of a fraction by the conjugate of the denominator so that the denominator becomes a rational number.

numerator being irrational, like in the examples above, the process may still facilitate subsequent manipulations by reducing the number of irrationals one has to work with in the denominator.\n\n\nTypographical variations\n\nIn computer displays and typography, simple fractions are sometimes printed as a single character, e.g. ½ (one half). See the article on Number Forms for information on doing this in Unicode.\nScientific publishing distinguishes four ways to set fractions, together with guidelines on use:\n\nSpecial fractions: fractions that are presented as a single character with a slanted bar, with roughly the same height and width as other characters in the text. Generally used for simple fractions, such as: ½, ⅓, ⅔, ¼, and ¾. Since the numerals are smaller, legibility can be an issue, especially for small-sized fonts. These are not used in modern mathematical notation but in other contexts.\nCase fractions: similar to special fractions, these are rendered as a single typographical character, but with a horizontal bar, thus making them upright. An example would be ⁠1/2⁠, but rendered with the same height as other characters. Some sources include all rendering of fractions as case fractions if they take only one typographical space, regardless of the direction of the bar.\nShilling, or solidus, fractions: 1/2, so called because this notation was used for pre-decimal British currency (£sd), as in \"2/6\" for a half crown, meaning two shillings and six pence. While the notation two shillings and six pence did not represent a fraction, the slash is now used in fractions, especially for fractions inline with prose (rather than displayed), to avoid uneven lines. It is also used for fractions within fractions (complex fractions) or within exponents to increase legibility. Fractions written this way, also known as piece fractions, are written all on one typographical line but take three or more typographical spaces.\nBuilt-up fractions: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}}\n  \n. This notation uses two or more lines of ordinary text and results in a variation in spacing between lines when included within other text. While large and legible, these can be disruptive, particularly for simple fractions or within complex fractions.\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest fractions were reciprocals of integers: ancient symbols representing one part of two, one part of three, one part of four, and so on. The Egyptians used Egyptian fractions c. 1000 BC. About 4000 years ago, Egyptians divided with fractions using slightly different methods. They used least common multiples with unit fractions. Their methods gave the same answer as modern methods. The Egyptians also had a different notation for dyadic fractions, used for certain systems of weights and measures.\nThe Greeks used unit fractions and (later) simple continued fractions. Followers of the Greek philosopher Pythagoras (c. 530 BC) discovered that the square root of two cannot be expressed as a fraction of integers. (This is commonly though probably erroneously ascribed to Hippasus of Metapontum, who is said to have been executed for revealing this fact.) In 150 BC Jain mathematicians in India wrote the Sthananga Sutra, which contains work on the theory of numbers, arithmetical operations, and operations with fractions.\nA modern expression of fractions known as bhinna seems to have originated in India. They were first described in the Bakhshali manuscript (c. AD 400), Brahmagupta (c. 628), and Bhaskara (c. 1150). Their works form fractions by placing the numerators (Sanskrit: amsa) over the denominators (cheda), but without a bar between them. The integer was written on one line and the fraction in its two parts on the next line. If the fraction was marked by a small circle ⟨०⟩ or cross ⟨+⟩, it is subtracted from the integer; if no such sign appears, it is understood to be added. For example, Bhaskara I writes:\n\n६  १  २\n१  १  १०\n४  ५  ९\nwhich is the equivalent of\n\n6  1  2\n1  1  −1\n4   5  9\nand would be written in modern notation as 6⁠1/4⁠, 1⁠1/5⁠, and 2 − ⁠1/9⁠ (i.e., 1⁠8/9⁠).\nThe horizontal fraction bar is first attested in the work of Al-Hassār (fl. 1200), a Muslim mathematician from Fez, Morocco, who specialized in Islamic inheritance jurisprudence. In his discussion he writes: \"for example, if you are told to write three-fifths and a third of a fifth, write thus, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              3\n              \n              1\n            \n            \n              5\n              \n              3\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3\\quad 1}{5\\quad 3}}}\n  \n\". The same fractional notation—with the fraction given before the integer—appears soon after in the work of Leonardo Fibonacci in the 13th century.\nIn discussing the origins of decimal fractions, Dirk Jan Struik states:\n\nThe introduction of decimal fractions as a common computational practice can be dated back to the Flemish pamphlet De Thiende, published at Leyden in 1585, together with a French translation, La Disme, by the Flemish mathematician Simon Stevin (1548–1620), then settled in the Northern Netherlands. It is true that decimal fractions were used by the Chinese many centuries before Stevin and that the Persian astronomer Al-Kāshī used both decimal and sexagesimal fractions with great ease in his Key to arithmetic (Samarkand, early fifteenth century).\n\nWhile the Persian mathematician Jamshīd al-Kāshī claimed to have discovered decimal fractions himself in the 15th century, J. Lennart Berggren notes that he was mistaken, as decimal fractions were first used five centuries before him by the Baghdadi mathematician Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi as early as the 10th century.\n\n\nIn formal education\n\n\nPrimary schools\nIn primary schools, fractions have been demonstrated through Cuisenaire rods, Fraction Bars, fraction strips, fraction circles, paper (for folding or cutting), pattern blocks, pie-shaped pieces, plastic rectangles, grid paper, dot paper, geoboards, counters and computer software.\n\n\nDocuments for teachers\nSeveral states in the United States have adopted learning trajectories from the Common Core State Standards Initiative's guidelines for mathematics education. Aside from sequencing the learning of fractions and operations with fractions, the document provides the following definition of a fraction: \"A number expressible in the form \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  \n⁄\n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  \n is a whole number and \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n  \n is a positive whole number. (The word fraction in these standards always refers to a non-negative number.)\" The document itself also refers to negative fractions.\n\n\nSee also\nCross multiplication\n0.999...\nMultiple\nFRACTRAN\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nWeisstein, Eric (2003). \"CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics, Second Edition\".
