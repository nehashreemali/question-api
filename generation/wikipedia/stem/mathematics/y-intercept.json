The \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n-intercepts of functions, if any exist, are often more difficult to locate than the \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n-intercept, as finding the \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n-intercept involves simply evaluating the function at \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=0}\n  \n.\n\n\nIn higher dimensions\nThe notion may be extended for 3-dimensional space and higher dimensions, as well as for other coordinate axes, possibly with other names.

(In electrical engineering, \n  \n    \n      \n        I\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I}\n  \n is the symbol used for electric current.)\n\n\nSee also\nRegression intercept\n\n\nReferences",
