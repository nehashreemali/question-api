A solution to a linear system is an assignment of values to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied. In the example above, a solution is given by the ordered triple\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        =\n        (\n        1\n        ,\n        −\n        2\n        ,\n        −\n        2\n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x,y,z)=(1,-2,-2),}\n  \n\nsince it makes all three equations valid.\nLinear systems are a fundamental part of linear algebra, a subject used in most modern mathematics. Computational algorithms for finding the solutions are an important part of numerical linear algebra, and play a prominent role in engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science, and economics. A system of non-linear equations can often be approximated by a linear system (see linearization), a helpful technique when making a mathematical model or computer simulation of a relatively complex system.\nVery often, and in this article, the coefficients and solutions of the equations are constrained to be real or complex numbers, but the theory and algorithms apply to coefficients and solutions in any field. For other algebraic structures, other theories have been developed. For coefficients and solutions in an integral domain, such as the ring of integers, see Linear equation over a ring. For coefficients and solutions that are polynomials, see Gröbner basis. For finding the \"best\" integer solutions among many, see Integer linear programming. For an example of a more exotic structure to which linear algebra can be applied, see Tropical geometry.\n\n\nElementary examples\n\n\nTrivial example\nThe system of one equation in one unknown\n\n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        x\n        =\n        4\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2x=4}\n  \n\nhas the solution \n\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        2.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=2.}\n  \n\nHowever, most interesting linear systems have at least two equations.\n\n\nSimple nontrivial example\nThe simplest kind of nontrivial linear system involves two equations and two variables:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                2\n                x\n              \n              \n              \n                \n                +\n                \n              \n              \n              \n                3\n                y\n              \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n              \n              \n              \n                6\n              \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                4\n                x\n              \n              \n              \n                \n                +\n                \n              \n              \n              \n                9\n                y\n              \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n              \n              \n              \n                15\n              \n              \n                \n                .\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{alignedat}{5}2x&&\\;+\\;&&3y&&\\;=\\;&&6&\\\\4x&&\\;+\\;&&9y&&\\;=\\;&&15&.\\end{alignedat}}}\n  \n\nOne method for solving such a system is as follows.

vector spaces (or more generally, modules) to be brought to bear. For example, the collection of all possible linear combinations of the vectors on the left-hand side (LHS) is called their span, and the equations have a solution just when the right-hand vector is within that span. If every vector within that span has exactly one expression as a linear combination of the given left-hand vectors, then any solution is unique. In any event, the span has a basis of linearly independent vectors that do guarantee exactly one expression; and the number of vectors in that basis (its dimension) cannot be larger than m or n, but it can be smaller. This is important because if we have m independent vectors a solution is guaranteed regardless of the right-hand side (RHS), and otherwise not guaranteed.\n\n\nMatrix equation\nThe vector equation is

The set of all possible solutions is called the solution set.\nA linear system may behave in any one of three possible ways:\n\nThe system has infinitely many solutions.\nThe system has a unique solution.\nThe system has no solution.\n\n\nGeometric interpretation\nFor a system involving two variables (x and y), each linear equation determines a line on the xy-plane. Because a solution to a linear system must satisfy all of the equations, the solution set is the intersection of these lines, and is hence either a line, a single point, or the empty set.\nFor three variables, each linear equation determines a plane in three-dimensional space, and the solution set is the intersection of these planes. Thus the solution set may be a plane, a line, a single point, or the empty set. For example, as three parallel planes do not have a common point, the solution set of their equations is empty; the solution set of the equations of three planes intersecting at a point is single point; if three planes pass through two points, their equations have at least two common solutions; in fact the solution set is infinite and consists in all the line passing through these points.\nFor n variables, each linear equation determines a hyperplane in n-dimensional space. The solution set is the intersection of these hyperplanes, and is a flat, which may have any dimension lower than n.\n\n\nGeneral behavior\n\nIn general, the behavior of a linear system is determined by the relationship between the number of equations and the number of unknowns. Here, \"in general\" means that a different behavior may occur for specific values of the coefficients of the equations.\n\nIn general, a system with fewer equations than unknowns has infinitely many solutions, but it may have no solution. Such a system is known as an underdetermined system.\nIn general, a system with the same number of equations and unknowns has a single unique solution.\nIn general, a system with more equations than unknowns has no solution. Such a system is also known as an overdetermined system.\nIn the first case, the dimension of the solution set is, in general, equal to n − m, where n is the number of variables and m is the number of equations.\nThe following pictures illustrate this trichotomy in the case of two variables:\n\nThe first system has infinitely many solutions, namely all of the points on the blue line. The second system has a single unique solution, namely the intersection of the two lines. The third system has no solutions, since the three lines share no common point.\nIt must be kept in mind that the pictures above show only the most common case (the general case). It is possible for a system of two equations and two unknowns to have no solution (if the two lines are parallel), or for a system of three equations and two unknowns to be solvable (if the three lines intersect at a single point).\nA system of linear equations behave differently from the general case if the equations are linearly dependent, or if it is inconsistent and has no more equations than unknowns.\n\n\nProperties\n\n\nIndependence\nThe equations of a linear system are independent if none of the equations can be derived algebraically from the others. When the equations are independent, each equation contains new information about the variables, and removing any of the equations increases the size of the solution set. For linear equations, logical independence is the same as linear independence.\n\nFor example, the equations\n\n  \n    \n      \n        3\n        x\n        +\n        2\n        y\n        =\n        6\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          and\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        6\n        x\n        +\n        4\n        y\n        =\n        12\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 3x+2y=6\\;\\;\\;\\;{\\text{and}}\\;\\;\\;\\;6x+4y=12}\n  \n\nare not independent — they are the same equation when scaled by a factor of two, and they would produce identical graphs.

Indeed, any one of these equations can be derived from the other two, and any one of the equations can be removed without affecting the solution set. The graphs of these equations are three lines that intersect at a single point.\n\n\nConsistency\n\nA linear system is inconsistent if it has no solution, and otherwise, it is said to be consistent. When the system is inconsistent, it is possible to derive a contradiction from the equations, that may always be rewritten as the statement 0 = 1.\nFor example, the equations\n\n  \n    \n      \n        3\n        x\n        +\n        2\n        y\n        =\n        6\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          and\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        3\n        x\n        +\n        2\n        y\n        =\n        12\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 3x+2y=6\\;\\;\\;\\;{\\text{and}}\\;\\;\\;\\;3x+2y=12}\n  \n\nare inconsistent. In fact, by subtracting the first equation from the second one and multiplying both sides of the result by 1/6, we get 0 = 1. The graphs of these equations on the xy-plane are a pair of parallel lines.\nIt is possible for three linear equations to be inconsistent, even though any two of them are consistent together.

Adding the first two equations together gives 3x + 2y = 2, which can be subtracted from the third equation to yield 0 = 1. Any two of these equations have a common solution. The same phenomenon can occur for any number of equations.\nIn general, inconsistencies occur if the left-hand sides of the equations in a system are linearly dependent, and the constant terms do not satisfy the dependence relation. A system of equations whose left-hand sides are linearly independent is always consistent.\nPutting it another way, according to the Rouché–Capelli theorem, any system of equations (overdetermined or otherwise) is inconsistent if the rank of the augmented matrix is greater than the rank of the coefficient matrix. If, on the other hand, the ranks of these two matrices are equal, the system must have at least one solution. The solution is unique if and only if the rank equals the number of variables. Otherwise the general solution has k free parameters where k is the difference between the number of variables and the rank; hence in such a case there is an infinitude of solutions. The rank of a system of equations (that is, the rank of the augmented matrix) can never be higher than [the number of variables] + 1, which means that a system with any number of equations can always be reduced to a system that has a number of independent equations that is at most equal to [the number of variables] + 1.\n\n\nEquivalence\nTwo linear systems using the same set of variables are equivalent if each of the equations in the second system can be derived algebraically from the equations in the first system, and vice versa. Two systems are equivalent if either both are inconsistent or each equation of each of them is a linear combination of the equations of the other one. It follows that two linear systems are equivalent if and only if they have the same solution set.\n\n\nSolving a linear system\nThere are several algorithms for solving a system of linear equations.\n\n\nDescribing the solution\nWhen the solution set is finite, it is reduced to a single element. In this case, the unique solution is described by a sequence of equations whose left-hand sides are the names of the unknowns and right-hand sides are the corresponding values, for example \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        =\n        3\n        ,\n        \n        y\n        =\n        −\n        2\n        ,\n        \n        z\n        =\n        6\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x=3,\\;y=-2,\\;z=6)}\n  \n. When an order on the unknowns has been fixed, for example the alphabetical order the solution may be described as a vector of values, like \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        3\n        ,\n        \n        −\n        2\n        ,\n        \n        6\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (3,\\,-2,\\,6)}\n  \n for the previous example.\nTo describe a set with an infinite number of solutions, typically some of the variables are designated as free (or independent, or as parameters), meaning that they are allowed to take any value, while the remaining variables are dependent on the values of the free variables.\nFor example, consider the following system:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n              \n              \n              \n                \n                +\n                \n              \n              \n              \n                3\n                y\n              \n              \n              \n                \n                −\n                \n              \n              \n              \n                2\n                z\n              \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n              \n              \n              \n                5\n              \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                3\n                x\n              \n              \n              \n                \n                +\n                \n              \n              \n              \n                5\n                y\n              \n              \n              \n                \n                +\n                \n              \n              \n              \n                6\n                z\n              \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n              \n              \n              \n                7\n              \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{alignedat}{7}x&&\\;+\\;&&3y&&\\;-\\;&&2z&&\\;=\\;&&5&\\\\3x&&\\;+\\;&&5y&&\\;+\\;&&6z&&\\;=\\;&&7&\\end{alignedat}}}\n  \n\nThe solution set to this system can be described by the following equations:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        −\n        7\n        z\n        −\n        1\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          and\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        y\n        =\n        3\n        z\n        +\n        2\n        \n          .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=-7z-1\\;\\;\\;\\;{\\text{and}}\\;\\;\\;\\;y=3z+2{\\text{.}}}\n  \n\nHere z is the free variable, while x and y are dependent on z. Any point in the solution set can be obtained by first choosing a value for z, and then computing the corresponding values for x and y.\nEach free variable gives the solution space one degree of freedom, the number of which is equal to the dimension of the solution set. For example, the solution set for the above equation is a line, since a point in the solution set can be chosen by specifying the value of the parameter z. An infinite solution of higher order may describe a plane, or higher-dimensional set.\nDifferent choices for the free variables may lead to different descriptions of the same solution set. For example, the solution to the above equations can alternatively be described as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        −\n        \n          \n            3\n            7\n          \n        \n        x\n        +\n        \n          \n            11\n            7\n          \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          and\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        z\n        =\n        −\n        \n          \n            1\n            7\n          \n        \n        x\n        −\n        \n          \n            1\n            7\n          \n        \n        \n          .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=-{\\frac {3}{7}}x+{\\frac {11}{7}}\\;\\;\\;\\;{\\text{and}}\\;\\;\\;\\;z=-{\\frac {1}{7}}x-{\\frac {1}{7}}{\\text{.}}}\n  \n\nHere x is the free variable, and y and z are dependent.\n\n\nElimination of variables\nThe simplest method for solving a system of linear equations is to repeatedly eliminate variables. This method can be described as follows:\n\nIn the first equation, solve for one of the variables in terms of the others.\nSubstitute this expression into the remaining equations. This yields a system of equations with one fewer equation and unknown.\nRepeat steps 1 and 2 until the system is reduced to a single linear equation.\nSolve this equation, and then back-substitute until the entire solution is found.\nFor example, consider the following system:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            {\n            \n              \n                \n                  x\n                  +\n                  3\n                  y\n                  −\n                  2\n                  z\n                  =\n                  5\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  3\n                  x\n                  +\n                  5\n                  y\n                  +\n                  6\n                  z\n                  =\n                  7\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  2\n                  x\n                  +\n                  4\n                  y\n                  +\n                  3\n                  z\n                  =\n                  8\n                \n              \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{cases}x+3y-2z=5\\\\3x+5y+6z=7\\\\2x+4y+3z=8\\end{cases}}}\n  \n\nSolving the first equation for x gives \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        5\n        +\n        2\n        z\n        −\n        3\n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=5+2z-3y}\n  \n, and plugging this into the second and third equation yields\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            {\n            \n              \n                \n                  y\n                  =\n                  3\n                  z\n                  +\n                  2\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  y\n                  =\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        7\n                        2\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                  z\n                  +\n                  1\n                \n              \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{cases}y=3z+2\\\\y={\\tfrac {7}{2}}z+1\\end{cases}}}\n  \n\nSince the LHS of both of these equations equal y, equating the RHS of the equations.

matrix of coefficients, while the numerator is the determinant of a matrix in which one column has been replaced by the vector of constant terms.\nThough Cramer's rule is important theoretically, it has little practical value for large matrices, since the computation of large determinants is somewhat cumbersome. (Indeed, large determinants are most easily computed using row reduction.)\nFurther, Cramer's rule has very poor numerical properties, making it unsuitable for solving even small systems reliably, unless the operations are performed in rational arithmetic with unbounded precision.\n\n\nMatrix solution\nIf the equation system is expressed in the matrix form \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          x\n        \n        =\n        \n          b\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A\\mathbf {x} =\\mathbf {b} }\n  \n, the entire solution set can also be expressed in matrix form.

The standard algorithm for solving a system of linear equations is based on Gaussian elimination with some modifications. Firstly, it is essential to avoid division by small numbers, which may lead to inaccurate results. This can be done by reordering the equations if necessary, a process known as pivoting. Secondly, the algorithm does not exactly do Gaussian elimination, but it computes the LU decomposition of the matrix A. This is mostly an organizational tool, but it is much quicker if one has to solve several systems with the same matrix A but different vectors b.\nIf the matrix A has some special structure, this can be exploited to obtain faster or more accurate algorithms. For instance, systems with a symmetric positive definite matrix can be solved twice as fast with the Cholesky decomposition. Levinson recursion is a fast method for Toeplitz matrices. Special methods exist also for matrices with many zero elements (so-called sparse matrices), which appear often in applications.\nA completely different approach is often taken for very large systems, which would otherwise take too much time or memory. The idea is to start with an initial approximation to the solution (which does not have to be accurate at all), and to change this approximation in several steps to bring it closer to the true solution. Once the approximation is sufficiently accurate, this is taken to be the solution to the system. This leads to the class of iterative methods.  For some sparse matrices, the introduction of randomness improves the speed of the iterative methods. One example of an iterative method is the Jacobi method, where the matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n  \n is split into its diagonal component \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n and its non-diagonal component \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n        +\n        U\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L+U}\n  \n.

=\\mathbf {0} }\n  \n\nwhere A is an m × n matrix, x is a column vector with n entries, and 0 is the zero vector with m entries.\n\n\nHomogeneous solution set\nEvery homogeneous system has at least one solution, known as the zero (or trivial) solution, which is obtained by assigning the value of zero to each of the variables. If the system has a non-singular matrix (det(A) ≠ 0) then it is also the only solution.  If the system has a singular matrix then there is a solution set with an infinite number of solutions.  This solution set has the following additional properties:\n\nIf u and v are two vectors representing solutions to a homogeneous system, then the vector sum u + v is also a solution to the system.\nIf u is a vector representing a solution to a homogeneous system, and r is any scalar, then ru is also a solution to the system.\nThese are exactly the properties required for the solution set to be a linear subspace of Rn. In particular, the solution set to a homogeneous system is the same as the null space of the corresponding matrix A.\n\n\nRelation to nonhomogeneous systems\nThere is a close relationship between the solutions to a linear system and the solutions to the corresponding homogeneous system:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          x\n        \n        =\n        \n          b\n        \n        \n        \n          and\n        \n        \n        A\n        \n          x\n        \n        =\n        \n          0\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A\\mathbf {x} =\\mathbf {b} \\qquad {\\text{and}}\\qquad A\\mathbf {x} =\\mathbf {0} .}\n  \n\nSpecifically, if p is any specific solution to the linear system Ax = b, then the entire solution set can be described as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          {\n          \n            \n              p\n            \n            +\n            \n              v\n            \n            :\n            \n              v\n            \n            \n               is any solution to \n            \n            A\n            \n              x\n            \n            =\n            \n              0\n            \n          \n          }\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left\\{\\mathbf {p} +\\mathbf {v} :\\mathbf {v} {\\text{ is any solution to }}A\\mathbf {x} =\\mathbf {0} \\right\\}.}\n  \n\nGeometrically, this says that the solution set for Ax = b is a translation of the solution set for Ax = 0. Specifically, the flat for the first system can be obtained by translating the linear subspace for the homogeneous system by the vector p.\nThis reasoning only applies if the system Ax = b has at least one solution. This occurs if and only if the vector b lies in the image of the linear transformation A.\n\n\nSee also\nArrangement of hyperplanes\nIterative refinement – Method to improve accuracy of numerical solutions to systems of linear equations\nCoates graph – Mathematical graph for solving linear systems\nLAPACK – Software library for numerical linear algebra\nLinear equation over a ring\nLinear least squares – Least squares approximation of linear functions to dataPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nMatrix decomposition – Representation of a matrix as a product\nMatrix splitting – Representation of a matrix as a sum\nNAG Numerical Library – Software library of numerical-analysis algorithms\nRybicki Press algorithm – Algorithm for inverting a matrix\nSimultaneous equations – Set of equations to be solved togetherPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nAnton, Howard (1987), Elementary Linear Algebra (5th ed.), New York: Wiley, ISBN 0-471-84819-0\nBeauregard, Raymond A.; Fraleigh, John B.
