For example, there are six divisors of 4; they are 1, 2, 4, −1, −2, and −4, but only the positive ones (1, 2, and 4) would usually be mentioned.\n1 and −1 divide (are divisors of) every integer. Every integer (and its negation) is a divisor of itself. Integers divisible by 2 are called even, and integers not divisible by 2 are called odd.\n1, −1, \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        −\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle -n}\n  \n are known as the trivial divisors of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n.}\n  \n A divisor of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n that is not a trivial divisor is known as a non-trivial divisor (or strict divisor).
