  "extract": "In probability theory and statistics, the binomial distribution with parameters n and p is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments, each asking a yes–no question, and each with its own Boolean-valued outcome: success (with probability p) or failure (with probability q = 1 − p). A single success/failure experiment is also called a Bernoulli trial or Bernoulli experiment, and a sequence of outcomes is called a Bernoulli process. For a single trial, that is, when n = 1, the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution. The binomial distribution is the basis for the binomial test of statistical significance.\nThe binomial distribution is frequently used to model the number of successes in a sample of size n drawn with replacement from a population of size N. If the sampling is carried out without replacement, the draws are not independent and so the resulting distribution is a hypergeometric distribution, not a binomial one.  However, for N much larger than n, the binomial distribution remains a good approximation, and is widely used.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nProbability mass function\nIf the random variable X follows the binomial distribution with parameters \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        ∈\n        \n          N\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n\\in \\mathbb {N} }\n  \n (a natural number) and p ∈ [0, 1], we write X ~ B(n, p).

The formula can be understood as follows: pk qn−k is the probability of obtaining the sequence of n independent Bernoulli trials in which k trials are \"successes\" and the remaining n − k trials are \"failures\". Since the trials are independent with probabilities remaining constant between them, any sequence of n trials with k successes (and n − k failures) has the same probability of being achieved (regardless of positions of successes within the sequence).

Instead, one may use \n  \n    \n      \n        z\n        =\n        \n          z\n          \n            α\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle z=z_{\\alpha /2}}\n  \n to get the lower bound, or use \n  \n    \n      \n        z\n        =\n        \n          z\n          \n            1\n            −\n            α\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle z=z_{1-\\alpha /2}}\n  \n to get the upper bound.

So the sum of two Binomial distributed random variables X ~ B(n, p) and Y ~ B(m, p) is equivalent to the sum of n + m Bernoulli distributed random variables, which means Z = X + Y ~ B(n + m, p). This can also be proven directly using the addition rule.\nHowever, if X and Y do not have the same probability p, then the variance of the sum will be smaller than the variance of a binomial variable distributed as B(n + m, p).\n\n\nPoisson binomial distribution\nThe binomial distribution is a special case of the Poisson binomial distribution, which is the distribution of a sum of n independent non-identical Bernoulli trials B(pi).\n\n\nRatio of two binomial distributions\nThis result was first derived by Katz and coauthors in 1978.\nLet X ~ B(n, p1) and Y ~ B(m, p2) be independent. Let T = (X/n) / (Y/m).\nThen log(T) is approximately normally distributed with mean log(p1/p2) and variance ((1/p1) − 1)/n + ((1/p2) − 1)/m.\n\n\nConditional binomials\nIf X ~ B(n, p) and Y | X ~ B(X, q) (the conditional distribution of Y, given X), then Y is a simple binomial random variable with distribution Y ~ B(n, pq).\nFor example, imagine throwing n balls to a basket UX and taking the balls that hit and throwing them to another basket UY. If p is the probability to hit UX then X ~ B(n, p) is the number of balls that hit UX. If q is the probability to hit UY then the number of balls that hit UY is Y ~ B(X, q) and therefore Y ~ B(n, pq).\n\n\nBernoulli distribution\nThe Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution, where n = 1. Symbolically, X ~ B(1, p) has the same meaning as X ~ Bernoulli(p). Conversely, any binomial distribution, B(n, p), is the distribution of the sum of n independent Bernoulli trials, Bernoulli(p), each with the same probability p.\n\n\nNormal approximation\n\nIf n is large enough, then the skew of the distribution is not too great. In this case a reasonable approximation to B(n, p) is given by the normal distribution\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            N\n          \n        \n        (\n        n\n        p\n        ,\n        \n        n\n        p\n        (\n        1\n        −\n        p\n        )\n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {N}}(np,\\,np(1-p)),}\n  \n\nand this basic approximation can be improved in a simple way by using a suitable continuity correction.\nThe basic approximation generally improves as n increases (at least 20) and is better when p is not near to 0 or 1. Various rules of thumb may be used to decide whether n is large enough, and p is far enough from the extremes of zero or one:\n\nOne rule is that for n > 5 the normal approximation is adequate if the absolute value of the skewness is strictly less than 0.3; that is, if \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                |\n              \n              1\n              −\n              2\n              p\n              \n                |\n              \n            \n            \n              n\n              p\n              (\n              1\n              −\n              p\n              )\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              n\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          |\n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    1\n                    −\n                    p\n                  \n                  p\n                \n              \n            \n            −\n            \n              \n                \n                  p\n                  \n                    1\n                    −\n                    p\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n          \n          |\n        \n        <\n        0.3.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {|1-2p|}{\\sqrt {np(1-p)}}}={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {n}}}\\left|{\\sqrt {\\frac {1-p}{p}}}-{\\sqrt {\\frac {p}{1-p}}}\\,\\right|<0.3.}\n  \n\nThis can be made precise using the Berry–Esseen theorem.\n\nA stronger rule states that the normal approximation is appropriate only if everything within 3 standard deviations of its mean is within the range of possible values; that is, only if \n  \n    \n      \n        μ\n        ±\n        3\n        σ\n        =\n        n\n        p\n        ±\n        3\n        \n          \n            n\n            p\n            (\n            1\n            −\n            p\n            )\n          \n        \n        ∈\n        (\n        0\n        ,\n        n\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu \\pm 3\\sigma =np\\pm 3{\\sqrt {np(1-p)}}\\in (0,n).}\n  \n\nThis 3-standard-deviation rule is equivalent to the following conditions, which also imply the first rule above. \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        >\n        9\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                −\n                p\n              \n              p\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        \n        \n          and\n        \n        \n        n\n        >\n        9\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              p\n              \n                1\n                −\n                p\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n>9\\left({\\frac {1-p}{p}}\\right)\\quad {\\text{and}}\\quad n>9\\left({\\frac {p}{1-p}}\\right).}\n  \n\nAnother commonly used rule is that both values np and n(1 − p) must be greater than or equal to 5. However, the specific number varies from source to source, and depends on how good an approximation one wants. In particular, if one uses 9 instead of 5, the rule implies the results stated in the previous paragraphs.\n\nThe following is an example of applying a continuity correction. Suppose one wishes to calculate Pr(X ≤ 8) for a binomial random variable X. If Y has a distribution given by the normal approximation, then Pr(X ≤ 8) is approximated by Pr(Y ≤ 8.5). The addition of 0.5 is the continuity correction; the uncorrected normal approximation gives considerably less accurate results.\nThis approximation, known as de Moivre–Laplace theorem, is a huge time-saver when undertaking calculations by hand (exact calculations with large n are very onerous); historically, it was the first use of the normal distribution, introduced in Abraham de Moivre's book The Doctrine of Chances in 1738. Nowadays, it can be seen as a consequence of the central limit theorem since B(n, p) is a sum of n independent, identically distributed Bernoulli variables with parameter p. This fact is the basis of a hypothesis test, a \"proportion z-test\", for the value of p using x / n, the sample proportion and estimator of p, in a common test statistic.\nFor example, suppose one randomly samples n people out of a large population and ask them whether they agree with a certain statement. The proportion of people who agree will of course depend on the sample. If groups of n people were sampled repeatedly and truly randomly, the proportions would follow an approximate normal distribution with mean equal to the true proportion p of agreement in the population and with standard deviation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        σ\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                p\n                (\n                1\n                −\n                p\n                )\n              \n              n\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma ={\\sqrt {\\frac {p(1-p)}{n}}}}\n  \n\n\nPoisson approximation\nThe binomial distribution converges towards the Poisson distribution as the number of trials goes to infinity while the product np converges to a finite limit. Therefore, the Poisson distribution with parameter λ = np can be used as an approximation to B(n, p) of the binomial distribution if n is sufficiently large and p is sufficiently small.  According to rules of thumb, this approximation is good if n ≥ 20 and p ≤ 0.05 such that np ≤ 1, or if n > 50 and p < 0.1 such that np < 5, or if n ≥ 100 and np ≤ 10.\nConcerning the accuracy of Poisson approximation, see Novak, ch. 4, and references therein.\n\n\nLimiting distributions\nPoisson limit theorem: As n approaches ∞ and p approaches 0 with the product np held fixed, the Binomial(n, p) distribution approaches the Poisson distribution with expected value λ = np.\nde Moivre–Laplace theorem: As n approaches ∞ while p remains fixed, the distribution of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              X\n              −\n              n\n              p\n            \n            \n              n\n              p\n              (\n              1\n              −\n              p\n              )\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {X-np}{\\sqrt {np(1-p)}}}}\n  \n approaches the normal distribution with expected value 0 and variance 1. This result is sometimes loosely stated by saying that the distribution of X is asymptotically normal with expected value 0 and variance 1. This result is a specific case of the central limit theorem.\n\n\nBeta distribution\nThe binomial distribution and beta distribution are different views of the same model of repeated Bernoulli trials. The binomial distribution is the PMF of k successes given n independent events each with a probability p of success. \nMathematically, when α = k + 1 and β = n − k + 1, the beta distribution and the binomial distribution are related by a factor of n + 1:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Beta\n        ⁡\n        (\n        p\n        ;\n        α\n        ;\n        β\n        )\n        =\n        (\n        n\n        +\n        1\n        )\n        \n          B\n        \n        (\n        k\n        ;\n        n\n        ;\n        p\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Beta} (p;\\alpha ;\\beta )=(n+1)\\mathrm {B} (k;n;p)}\n  \n\nBeta distributions also provide a family of prior probability distributions for binomial distributions in Bayesian inference: \n\n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        (\n        p\n        ;\n        α\n        ,\n        β\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                p\n                \n                  α\n                  −\n                  1\n                \n              \n              (\n              1\n              −\n              p\n              \n                )\n                \n                  β\n                  −\n                  1\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Beta\n              ⁡\n              (\n              α\n              ,\n              β\n              )\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P(p;\\alpha ,\\beta )={\\frac {p^{\\alpha -1}(1-p)^{\\beta -1}}{\\operatorname {Beta} (\\alpha ,\\beta )}}.}\n  \n\nGiven a uniform prior, the posterior distribution for the probability of success p given n independent events with k observed successes is a beta distribution.\n\n\nComputational methods\n\n\nRandom number generation\n\nMethods for random number generation where the marginal distribution is a binomial distribution are well-established.\nOne way to generate random variates samples from a binomial distribution is to use an inversion algorithm. To do so, one must calculate the probability that Pr(X = k) for all values k from 0 through n. (These probabilities should sum to a value close to one, in order to encompass the entire sample space.) Then by using a pseudorandom number generator to generate samples uniformly between 0 and 1, one can transform the calculated samples into discrete numbers by using the probabilities calculated in the first step.\n\n\nHistory\nThis distribution was derived by Jacob Bernoulli. He considered the case where p = r/(r + s) where p is the probability of success and r and s are positive integers. Blaise Pascal had earlier considered the case where p = 1/2, tabulating the corresponding binomial coefficients in what is now recognized as Pascal's triangle.\n\n\nSee also\n\nLogistic regression\nMultinomial distribution\nNegative binomial distribution\nBeta-binomial distribution\nBinomial measure, an example of a multifractal measure.\nStatistical mechanics\nPiling-up lemma, the resulting probability when XOR-ing independent Boolean variables\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nHirsch, Werner Z.
