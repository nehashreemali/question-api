  "extract": "In mathematics, a multiple is the product of any quantity and an integer. In other words, for the quantities a and b, it can be said that b is a multiple of a if b = na for some integer n, which is called the multiplier. If a is not zero, this is equivalent to saying that \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n        \n          /\n        \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b/a}\n  \n is an integer.\nWhen a and b are both integers, and b is a multiple of a, then a is called a divisor of b. One says also that a divides b. If a and b are not integers, mathematicians prefer generally to use integer multiple instead of multiple, for clarification. In fact, multiple is used for other kinds of product; for example, a polynomial p is a multiple of another polynomial q if there exists third polynomial r such that p = qr.\n\n\nExamples\n14, 49, −21 and 0 are multiples of 7, whereas 3 and −6 are not. This is because there are integers that 7 may be multiplied by to reach the values of 14, 49, 0 and −21, while there are no such integers for 3 and −6. Each of the products listed below, and in particular, the products for 3 and −6, is the only way that the relevant number can be written as a product of 7 and another real number:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        14\n        =\n        7\n        ×\n        2\n        ;\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 14=7\\times 2;}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        49\n        =\n        7\n        ×\n        7\n        ;\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 49=7\\times 7;}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        −\n        21\n        =\n        7\n        ×\n        (\n        −\n        3\n        )\n        ;\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle -21=7\\times (-3);}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        0\n        =\n        7\n        ×\n        0\n        ;\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0=7\\times 0;}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        3\n        =\n        7\n        ×\n        (\n        3\n        \n          /\n        \n        7\n        )\n        ,\n        \n        3\n        \n          /\n        \n        7\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 3=7\\times (3/7),\\quad 3/7}\n  \n is not an integer;\n\n  \n    \n      \n        −\n        6\n        =\n        7\n        ×\n        (\n        −\n        6\n        \n          /\n        \n        7\n        )\n        ,\n        \n        −\n        6\n        \n          /\n        \n        7\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle -6=7\\times (-6/7),\\quad -6/7}\n  \n is not an integer.\n\n\nProperties\n0 is a multiple of every number (\n  \n    \n      \n        0\n        =\n        0\n        ⋅\n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0=0\\cdot b}\n  \n).\nThe product of any integer \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n and any integer is a multiple of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n.

This terminology is also used with units of measurement (for example by the BIPM and NIST), where a unit submultiple is obtained by prefixing the main unit, defined as the quotient of the main unit by an integer, mostly a power of 103. For example, a millimetre is the 1000-fold submultiple of a metre. As another example, one inch may be considered as a 12-fold submultiple of a foot, or a 36-fold submultiple of a yard.\n\n\nSee also\nUnit fraction\nIdeal (ring theory)\nDecimal and SI prefix\nMultiplier (linguistics)\n\n\nReferences",
