It can also be used when two sides and one of the non-enclosed angles are known. In some such cases, the triangle is not uniquely determined by this data (called the ambiguous case) and the technique gives two possible values for the enclosed angle.\nThe law of sines is one of two trigonometric equations commonly applied to find lengths and angles in scalene triangles, with the other being the law of cosines.\nThe law of sines can be generalized to higher dimensions on surfaces with constant curvature.\n\n\nProof\nWith the side of length a as the base, the triangle's altitude can be computed as b sin γ or as c sin β.  Equating these two expressions gives\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            b\n            \n              sin\n              ⁡\n              β\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            c\n            \n              sin\n              ⁡\n              γ\n            \n          \n        \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {b}{\\sin \\beta }}={\\frac {c}{\\sin \\gamma }}\\,,}\n  \n\nand similar equations arise by choosing the side of length b or the side of length c as the base of the triangle.

In the case shown below they are triangles ABC and ABC′.\n\nGiven a general triangle, the following conditions would need to be fulfilled for the case to be ambiguous:\n\nThe only information known about the triangle is the angle α and the sides a and c.\nThe angle α is acute (i.e., α < 90°).\nThe side a is shorter than the side c (i.e., a < c).\nThe side a is longer than the altitude h from angle β, where h = c sin α (i.e., a > h).\nIf all the above conditions are true, then each of angles β and β′ produces a valid triangle, meaning that both of the following are true:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            γ\n          \n          ′\n        \n        =\n        arcsin\n        ⁡\n        \n          \n            \n              c\n              sin\n              ⁡\n              \n                α\n              \n            \n            a\n          \n        \n        \n        \n          or\n        \n        \n        \n          γ\n        \n        =\n        π\n        −\n        arcsin\n        ⁡\n        \n          \n            \n              c\n              sin\n              ⁡\n              \n                α\n              \n            \n            a\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\gamma }'=\\arcsin {\\frac {c\\sin {\\alpha }}{a}}\\quad {\\text{or}}\\quad {\\gamma }=\\pi -\\arcsin {\\frac {c\\sin {\\alpha }}{a}}.}\n  \n\nFrom there we can find the corresponding β and b or β′ and b′ if required, where b is the side bounded by vertices A and C and b′ is bounded by A and C′.\n\n\nExamples\nThe following are examples of how to solve a problem using the law of sines.\n\n\nExample 1\n\nGiven: side a = 20, side c = 24, and angle γ = 40°.

law of sines\nThe spherical law of sines deals with triangles on a sphere, whose sides are arcs of great circles.\nSuppose the radius of the sphere is 1. Let a, b, and c be the lengths of the great-arcs that are the sides of the triangle. Because it is a unit sphere, a, b, and c are the angles at the center of the sphere subtended by those arcs, in radians. Let A, B, and C be the angles opposite those respective sides. These are dihedral angles between the planes of the three great circles.\nThen the spherical law of sines says:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              sin\n              ⁡\n              A\n            \n            \n              sin\n              ⁡\n              a\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              sin\n              ⁡\n              B\n            \n            \n              sin\n              ⁡\n              b\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              sin\n              ⁡\n              C\n            \n            \n              sin\n              ⁡\n              c\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\sin A}{\\sin a}}={\\frac {\\sin B}{\\sin b}}={\\frac {\\sin C}{\\sin c}}.}\n  \n\n\nVector proof\nConsider a unit sphere with three unit vectors OA, OB and OC drawn from the origin to the vertices of the triangle. Thus the angles α, β, and γ are the angles a, b, and c, respectively. The arc BC subtends an angle of magnitude a at the centre. Introduce a Cartesian basis with OA along the z-axis and OB in the xz-plane making an angle c with the z-axis. The vector OC projects to ON in the xy-plane and the angle between ON and the x-axis is A.

space, the absolute value of the polar sine of the normal vectors of the facets that meet at a vertex, divided by the hyperarea of the facet opposite the vertex is independent of the choice of the vertex.

In his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, Brahmagupta expresses the circumradius of a triangle as the product of two sides divided by twice the altitude; the law of sines can be derived by alternately expressing the altitude as the sine of one or the other base angle times its opposite side, then equating the two resulting variants. An equation even closer to the modern law of sines appears in Brahmagupta's Khaṇḍakhādyaka, in a method for finding the distance between the Earth and a planet following an epicycle; however, Brahmagupta never treated the law of sines as an independent subject or used it systematically for solving triangles.\nThe spherical law of sines is sometimes credited to 10th century scholars Abu-Mahmud Khujandi or Abū al-Wafāʾ (it appears in his Almagest), but it is given prominence in Abū Naṣr Manṣūr's Treatise on the Determination of Spherical Arcs, and was credited to Abū Naṣr Manṣūr by his student al-Bīrūnī in his Keys to Astronomy. Ibn Muʿādh al-Jayyānī's 11th-century Book of Unknown Arcs of a Sphere also contains the spherical law of sines. \n\nThe 13th-century Persian mathematician Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī stated and proved the planar law of sines: In any plane triangle, the ratio of the sides is equal to the ratio of the sines of the angles opposite to those sides. That is, in triangle ABC, we have AB : AC = Sin(∠ACB) : Sin(∠ABC) By employing the law of sines, al-Tusi could solve triangles where either two angles and a side were known or two sides and an angle opposite one of them were given. For triangles with two sides and the included angle, he divided them into right triangles that he could then solve. When three sides were given, he dropped a perpendicular line and then used Proposition II-13 of Euclid's Elements (a geometric version of the law of cosines). Al-Tusi established the important result that if the sum or difference of two arcs is provided along with the ratio of their sines, then the arcs can be calculated.\nAccording to Glen Van Brummelen, \"The Law of Sines is really Regiomontanus's foundation for his solutions of right-angled triangles in Book IV, and these solutions are in turn the bases for his solutions of general triangles.\" Regiomontanus was a 15th-century German mathematician.\n\n\nSee also\nGersonides – Medieval Jewish philosopher\nHalf-side formula –  for solving spherical triangles\nLaw of cosines\nLaw of tangents\nLaw of cotangents\nMollweide's formula –  for checking solutions of triangles\nSolution of triangles\nSurveying\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Sine theorem\", Encyclopedia of Mathematics, EMS Press, 2001 [1994]\nThe Law of Sines at cut-the-knot\nDegree of Curvature\nFinding the Sine of 1 Degree\nGeneralized law of sines to higher dimensions",
