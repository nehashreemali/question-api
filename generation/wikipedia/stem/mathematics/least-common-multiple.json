  "extract": "In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple (LCM), lowest common multiple, or smallest common multiple (SCM) of two integers a and b, usually denoted by lcm(a, b), is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b. Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if a and b are both different from zero. However, some authors define lcm(a, 0) as 0 for all a, since 0 is the only common multiple of a and 0.\nThe least common multiple of the denominators of two fractions is the \"lowest common denominator\" (lcd), and can be used for adding, subtracting or comparing the fractions.\nThe least common multiple of more than two integers a, b, c, . . . , usually denoted by lcm(a, b, c, . . .), is defined as the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of a, b, c, . . .\n\n\nOverview\nA multiple of a number is the product of that number and an integer. For example, 10 is a multiple of 5 because 5 × 2 = 10, so 10 is divisible by 5 and 2. Because 10 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 5 and 2, it is the least common multiple of 5 and 2. By the same principle, 10 is the least common multiple of −5 and −2 as well.\n\n\nNotation\nThe least common multiple of two integers a and b is denoted as lcm(a, b). Some older textbooks use [a, b].\n\n\nExample\n\n  \n    \n      \n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        4\n        ,\n        6\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {lcm} (4,6)}\n  \n\nMultiples of 4 are:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        4\n        ,\n        8\n        ,\n        12\n        ,\n        16\n        ,\n        20\n        ,\n        24\n        ,\n        28\n        ,\n        32\n        ,\n        36\n        ,\n        40\n        ,\n        44\n        ,\n        48\n        ,\n        52\n        ,\n        56\n        ,\n        60\n        ,\n        64\n        ,\n        68\n        ,\n        72\n        ,\n        76\n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40,44,48,52,56,60,64,68,72,76,...}\n  \n\nMultiples of 6 are:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        6\n        ,\n        12\n        ,\n        18\n        ,\n        24\n        ,\n        30\n        ,\n        36\n        ,\n        42\n        ,\n        48\n        ,\n        54\n        ,\n        60\n        ,\n        66\n        ,\n        72\n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,54,60,66,72,...}\n  \n\nCommon multiples of 4 and 6 are the numbers that are in both lists:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        12\n        ,\n        24\n        ,\n        36\n        ,\n        48\n        ,\n        60\n        ,\n        72\n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 12,24,36,48,60,72,...}\n  \n\nIn this list, the smallest number is 12.

However, if both a and b are 0, these formulas would cause division by zero; so, lcm(0, 0) = 0 must be considered as a special case.\nTo return to the example above,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        21\n        ,\n        6\n        )\n        =\n        6\n        ×\n        \n          \n            21\n            \n              gcd\n              (\n              21\n              ,\n              6\n              )\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        6\n        ×\n        \n          \n            21\n            3\n          \n        \n        =\n        6\n        ×\n        7\n        =\n        42.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {lcm} (21,6)=6\\times {\\frac {21}{\\gcd(21,6)}}=6\\times {\\frac {21}{3}}=6\\times 7=42.}\n  \n\nThere are fast algorithms, such as the Euclidean algorithm for computing the gcd that do not require the numbers to be factored. For very large integers, there are even faster algorithms for the three involved operations (multiplication, gcd, and division); see Fast multiplication. As these algorithms are more efficient with factors of similar size, it is more efficient to divide the largest argument of the lcm by the gcd of the arguments, as in the example above.\n\n\nUsing prime factorization\nThe unique factorization theorem indicates that every positive integer greater than 1 can be written in only one way as a product of prime numbers. The prime numbers can be considered as the atomic elements which, when combined, make up a composite number.\nFor example:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        90\n        =\n        \n          2\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          3\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          5\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        =\n        2\n        ⋅\n        3\n        ⋅\n        3\n        ⋅\n        5.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 90=2^{1}\\cdot 3^{2}\\cdot 5^{1}=2\\cdot 3\\cdot 3\\cdot 5.}\n  \n\nHere, the composite number 90 is made up of one atom of the prime number 2, two atoms of the prime number 3, and one atom of the prime number 5.\nThis fact can be used to find the lcm of a set of numbers.\nExample: lcm(8,9,21)\nFactor each number and express it as a product of prime number powers.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                8\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  2\n                  \n                    3\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                9\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  3\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                21\n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  3\n                  \n                    1\n                  \n                \n                ⋅\n                \n                  7\n                  \n                    1\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}8&=2^{3}\\\\9&=3^{2}\\\\21&=3^{1}\\cdot 7^{1}\\end{aligned}}}\n  \n\nThe lcm will be the product of multiplying the highest power of each prime number together.

The lcm then can be found by multiplying all of the prime numbers in the diagram.\nHere is an example:\n\n48 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3,\n180 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5,\nsharing two \"2\"s and a \"3\" in common:\n\nLeast common multiple = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 720\nGreatest common divisor = 2 × 2 × 3 = 12\nProduct = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 8640\nThis also works for the greatest common divisor (gcd), except that instead of multiplying all of the numbers in the Venn diagram, one multiplies only the prime factors that are in the intersection. Thus the gcd of 48 and 180 is 2 × 2 × 3 = 12.\n\n\nFormulas\n\n\nFundamental theorem of arithmetic\nAccording to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        =\n        \n          2\n          \n            \n              n\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          3\n          \n            \n              n\n              \n                3\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          5\n          \n            \n              n\n              \n                5\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          7\n          \n            \n              n\n              \n                7\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        ⋯\n        =\n        \n          ∏\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n        \n          p\n          \n            \n              n\n              \n                p\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n=2^{n_{2}}3^{n_{3}}5^{n_{5}}7^{n_{7}}\\cdots =\\prod _{p}p^{n_{p}},}\n  \n\nwhere the exponents n2, n3, ... are non-negative integers; for example, 84 = 22 31 50 71 110 130 ...\nGiven two positive integers \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        =\n        \n          ∏\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n        \n          p\n          \n            \n              a\n              \n                p\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle a=\\prod _{p}p^{a_{p}}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n        =\n        \n          ∏\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n        \n          p\n          \n            \n              b\n              \n                p\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\textstyle b=\\prod _{p}p^{b_{p}}}\n  \n, their greatest common divisor and least common multiple are given by the formulas\n\n  \n    \n      \n        gcd\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        =\n        \n          ∏\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n        \n          p\n          \n            min\n            (\n            \n              a\n              \n                p\n              \n            \n            ,\n            \n              b\n              \n                p\n              \n            \n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gcd(a,b)=\\prod _{p}p^{\\min(a_{p},b_{p})}}\n  \n\nand\n\n  \n    \n      \n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        =\n        \n          ∏\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n        \n          p\n          \n            max\n            (\n            \n              a\n              \n                p\n              \n            \n            ,\n            \n              b\n              \n                p\n              \n            \n            )\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {lcm} (a,b)=\\prod _{p}p^{\\max(a_{p},b_{p})}.}\n  \n\nSince\n\n  \n    \n      \n        min\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        +\n        max\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        =\n        x\n        +\n        y\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\min(x,y)+\\max(x,y)=x+y,}\n  \n\nthis gives\n\n  \n    \n      \n        gcd\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        =\n        a\n        b\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gcd(a,b)\\operatorname {lcm} (a,b)=ab.}\n  \n\nIn fact, every rational number can be written uniquely as the product of primes, if negative exponents are allowed.

ordered by divisibility: if a divides b (that is, if b is an integer multiple of a) write a ≤ b (or equivalently, b ≥ a). (Note that the usual magnitude-based definition of ≤ is not used here.)\nUnder this ordering, the positive integers become a lattice, with meet given by the gcd and join given by the lcm. The proof is straightforward, if a bit tedious; it amounts to checking that lcm and gcd satisfy the axioms for meet and join. Putting the lcm and gcd into this more general context establishes a duality between them:\n\nIf a formula involving integer variables, gcd, lcm, ≤ and ≥ is true, then the formula obtained by switching gcd with lcm and switching ≥ with ≤ is also true. (Remember ≤ is defined as divides).\nThe following pairs of dual formulas are special cases of general lattice-theoretic identities.\n\nIt can also be shown that this lattice is distributive; that is, lcm distributes over gcd and gcd distributes over lcm:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        gcd\n        (\n        b\n        ,\n        c\n        )\n        )\n        =\n        gcd\n        (\n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        ,\n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        c\n        )\n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {lcm} (a,\\gcd(b,c))=\\gcd(\\operatorname {lcm} (a,b),\\operatorname {lcm} (a,c)),}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        gcd\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        b\n        ,\n        c\n        )\n        )\n        =\n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        gcd\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        ,\n        gcd\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        c\n        )\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gcd(a,\\operatorname {lcm} (b,c))=\\operatorname {lcm} (\\gcd(a,b),\\gcd(a,c)).}\n  \n\nThis identity is self-dual:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        gcd\n        (\n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        ,\n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        b\n        ,\n        c\n        )\n        ,\n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        c\n        )\n        )\n        =\n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        gcd\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n        ,\n        gcd\n        (\n        b\n        ,\n        c\n        )\n        ,\n        gcd\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        c\n        )\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gcd(\\operatorname {lcm} (a,b),\\operatorname {lcm} (b,c),\\operatorname {lcm} (a,c))=\\operatorname {lcm} (\\gcd(a,b),\\gcd(b,c),\\gcd(a,c)).}\n  \n\n\nOther\nLet D be the product of ω(D) distinct prime numbers (that is, D is squarefree).\nThen\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        {\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        \n        :\n        \n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        =\n        D\n        }\n        \n          |\n        \n        =\n        \n          3\n          \n            ω\n            (\n            D\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |\\{(x,y)\\;:\\;\\operatorname {lcm} (x,y)=D\\}|=3^{\\omega (D)},}\n  \n\nwhere the absolute bars || denote the cardinality of a set.\n\nIf none of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        \n          a\n          \n            r\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots ,a_{r}}\n  \n is zero, then\n\n  \n    \n      \n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        \n          a\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        \n          a\n          \n            r\n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        lcm\n        ⁡\n        (\n        \n          a\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        \n          a\n          \n            r\n            −\n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        \n          a\n          \n            r\n          \n        \n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {lcm} (a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots ,a_{r})=\\operatorname {lcm} (\\operatorname {lcm} (a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots ,a_{r-1}),a_{r}).}\n  \n\n\nIn commutative rings\nThe least common multiple can be defined generally over commutative rings as follows:\nLet a and b be elements of a commutative ring R. A common multiple of a and b is an element m of R such that both a and b divide m (that is, there exist elements x and y of R such that ax = m and by = m). A least common multiple of a and b is a common multiple that is minimal, in the sense that for any other common multiple n of a and b, m divides n.\nIn general, two elements in a commutative ring can have no least common multiple or more than one. However, any two least common multiples of the same pair of elements are associates. In a unique factorization domain, any two elements have a least common multiple. In a principal ideal domain, the least common multiple of a and b can be characterised as a generator of the intersection of the ideals generated by a and b (the intersection of a collection of ideals is always an ideal).\n\n\nSee also\nAnomalous cancellation\nCoprime integers\nChebyshev function\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\nBurton, David M.
