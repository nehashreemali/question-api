  "extract": "An endothermic process is a chemical or physical process that absorbs heat from its surroundings. In terms of thermodynamics, it is a thermodynamic process with an increase in the enthalpy H (or internal energy U) of the system. In an endothermic process, the heat that a system absorbs is thermal energy transfer into the system. Thus, an endothermic reaction generally leads to an increase in the temperature of the system and a decrease in that of the surroundings.\nThe term was coined by 19th-century French chemist Marcellin Berthelot. The term endothermic comes from the Greek ἔνδον (endon) meaning 'within' and θερμ- (therm) meaning 'hot' or 'warm'.\nAn endothermic process may be a chemical process, such as dissolving ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) in water (H2O), or a physical process, such as the melting of ice cubes.\nThe opposite of an endothermic process is an exothermic process, one that releases or \"gives out\" energy, usually in the form of heat and sometimes as electrical energy. Thus, endo in endothermic refers to energy or heat going in, and exo in exothermic refers to energy or heat going out. In each term (endothermic and exothermic) the prefix refers to where heat (or electrical energy) goes as the process occurs.\n\n\nIn chemistry\n\nDue to bonds breaking and forming during various processes (changes in state, chemical reactions), there is usually a change in energy. If the energy of the forming bonds is greater than the energy of the breaking bonds, then energy is released. This is known as an exothermic reaction. However, if more energy is needed to break the bonds than the energy being released, energy is taken up. Therefore, it is an endothermic reaction.\n\n\nDetails\nWhether a process can occur spontaneously depends not only on the enthalpy change but also on the entropy change (∆S) and absolute temperature T. If a process is a spontaneous process at a certain temperature, the products have a lower Gibbs free energy G = H – TS than the reactants (an exergonic process), even if the enthalpy of the products is higher. Thus, an endothermic process usually requires a favorable entropy increase (∆S > 0) in the system that overcomes the unfavorable increase in enthalpy so that still ∆G < 0. While endothermic phase transitions into more disordered states of higher entropy, e.g. melting and vaporization, are common, spontaneous chemical processes at moderate temperatures are rarely endothermic. The enthalpy increase ∆H ≫ 0 in a hypothetical strongly endothermic process usually results in ∆G = ∆H – T∆S > 0, which means that the process will not occur (unless driven by electrical or photon energy). An example of an endothermic and exergonic process is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            C\n            \n              6\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            H\n            \n              12\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            O\n            \n              6\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          +\n          6\n          \n          \n            H\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          O\n          ⟶\n          12\n          \n          \n            H\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          +\n          6\n          \n          \n            CO\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\ce {C6H12O6 + 6 H2O -> 12 H2 + 6 CO2}}}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Δ\n          \n            r\n          \n        \n        \n          H\n          \n            ∘\n          \n        \n        =\n        +\n        627\n         \n        \n          kJ/mol\n        \n        ,\n        \n        \n          Δ\n          \n            r\n          \n        \n        \n          G\n          \n            ∘\n          \n        \n        =\n        −\n        31\n         \n        \n          kJ/mol\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta _{r}H^{\\circ }=+627\\ {\\text{kJ/mol}},\\quad \\Delta _{r}G^{\\circ }=-31\\ {\\text{kJ/mol}}}\n  \n.\n\n\nExamples\nEvaporation\nSublimation\nCracking of alkanes\nThermal decomposition\nHydrolysis\nNucleosynthesis of elements heavier than nickel in stellar cores\nHigh-energy neutrons can produce tritium from lithium-7 in an endothermic process, consuming 2.466 MeV.
