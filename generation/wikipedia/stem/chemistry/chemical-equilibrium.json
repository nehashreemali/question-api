This state results when the forward reaction proceeds at the same rate as the reverse reaction. The reaction rates of the forward and backward reactions are generally not zero, but they are equal. Thus, there are no net changes in the concentrations of the reactants and products. Such a state is known as dynamic equilibrium.\nIt is the subject of study of equilibrium chemistry.\n\n\nHistorical introduction\nThe concept of chemical equilibrium was developed in 1803, after Berthollet found that some chemical reactions are reversible. For any reaction mixture to exist at equilibrium, the rates of the forward and backward (reverse) reactions must be equal. In the following chemical equation, arrows point both ways to indicate equilibrium. A and B are reactant chemical species, S and T are product species, and α, β, σ, and τ are the stoichiometric coefficients of the respective reactants and products:\n\nα A + β B ⇌ σ S + τ T\nThe equilibrium concentration position of a reaction is said to lie \"far to the right\" if, at equilibrium, nearly all the reactants are consumed. Conversely the equilibrium position is said to be \"far to the left\" if hardly any product is formed from the reactants.\nGuldberg and Waage (1865), building on Berthollet's ideas, proposed the law of mass action:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  forward reaction rate\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  k\n                  \n                    +\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    A\n                  \n                  \n                    α\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    B\n                  \n                  \n                    β\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  backward reaction rate\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  k\n                  \n                    −\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    S\n                  \n                  \n                    σ\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    T\n                  \n                  \n                    τ\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\text{forward reaction rate}}&=k_{+}{\\ce {A}}^{\\alpha }{\\ce {B}}^{\\beta }\\\\{\\text{backward reaction rate}}&=k_{-}{\\ce {S}}^{\\sigma }{\\ce {T}}^{\\tau }\\end{aligned}}}\n  \n\nwhere A, B, S and T are active masses and k+ and k− are rate constants.

Equality of forward and backward reaction rates, however, is a necessary condition for chemical equilibrium, though it is not sufficient to explain why equilibrium occurs.\nDespite the limitations of this derivation, the equilibrium constant for a reaction is indeed a constant, independent of the activities of the various species involved, though it does depend on temperature as observed by the van 't Hoff equation. Adding a catalyst will affect both the forward reaction and the reverse reaction in the same way and will not have an effect on the equilibrium constant. The catalyst will speed up both reactions thereby increasing the speed at which equilibrium is reached.\nAlthough the macroscopic equilibrium concentrations are constant in time, reactions do occur at the molecular level. For example, in the case of acetic acid dissolved in water and forming acetate and hydronium ions,\n\nCH3CO2H + H2O  ⇌  CH3CO−2 + H3O+\na proton may hop from one molecule of acetic acid onto a water molecule and then onto an acetate anion to form another molecule of acetic acid and leaving the number of acetic acid molecules unchanged. This is an example of dynamic equilibrium. Equilibria, like the rest of thermodynamics, are statistical phenomena, averages of microscopic behavior.\nLe Châtelier's principle (1884) predicts the behavior of an equilibrium system when changes to its reaction conditions occur. If a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium moves to partially reverse the change. For example, adding more S (to the chemical reaction above) from the outside will cause an excess of products, and the system will try to counteract this by increasing the reverse reaction and pushing the equilibrium point backward (though the equilibrium constant will stay the same).\nIf mineral acid is added to the acetic acid mixture, increasing the concentration of hydronium ion, the amount of dissociation must decrease as the reaction is driven to the left in accordance with this principle. This can also be deduced from the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        K\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              {\n              \n                \n                  CH\n                  \n                    3\n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  CO\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                  \n                    −\n                  \n                \n              \n              }\n              {\n              \n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    3\n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  O\n                  \n                    +\n                  \n                \n              \n              }\n            \n            \n              \n                {\n                \n                  CH\n                  \n                    3\n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  CO\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                \n                H\n                }\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K={\\frac {\\{{\\ce {CH3CO2-}}\\}\\{{\\ce {H3O+}}\\}}{{\\ce {\\{CH3CO2H\\}}}}}}\n  \n\nIf {H3O+} increases {CH3CO2H} must increase and CH3CO−2 must decrease. The H2O is left out, as it is the solvent and its concentration remains high and nearly constant.\nJ. W. Gibbs suggested in 1873 that equilibrium is attained when the \"available energy\" (now known as Gibbs free energy or Gibbs energy) of the system is at its minimum value, assuming the reaction is carried out at a constant temperature and pressure. What this means is that the derivative of the Gibbs energy with respect to reaction coordinate (a measure of the extent of reaction that has occurred, ranging from zero for all reactants to a maximum for all products) vanishes (because dG = 0), signaling a stationary point. This derivative is called the reaction Gibbs energy (or energy change) and corresponds to the difference between the chemical potentials of reactants and products at the composition of the reaction mixture. This criterion is both necessary and sufficient. If a mixture is not at equilibrium, the liberation of the excess Gibbs energy (or Helmholtz energy at constant volume reactions) is the \"driving force\" for the composition of the mixture to change until equilibrium is reached. The equilibrium constant can be related to the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction by the equation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Δ\n          \n            r\n          \n        \n        \n          G\n          \n            ⊖\n          \n        \n        =\n        −\n        R\n        T\n        ln\n        ⁡\n        \n          K\n          \n            \n              e\n              q\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta _{r}G^{\\ominus }=-RT\\ln K_{\\mathrm {eq} }}\n  \n\nwhere R is the universal gas constant and T the temperature.\nWhen the reactants are dissolved in a medium of high ionic strength the quotient of activity coefficients may be taken to be constant.

For this reason, equilibrium constants for solutions are usually determined in media of high ionic strength. Kc varies with ionic strength, temperature and pressure (or volume). Likewise Kp for gases depends on partial pressure. These constants are easier to measure and encountered in high-school chemistry courses.\n\n\nThermodynamics\nAt constant temperature and pressure, one must consider the Gibbs free energy, G, while at constant temperature and volume, one must consider the Helmholtz free energy, A, for the reaction; and at constant internal energy and volume, one must consider the entropy, S, for the reaction.\nThe constant volume case is important in geochemistry and atmospheric chemistry where pressure variations are significant. Note that, if reactants and products were in standard state (completely pure), then there would be no reversibility and no equilibrium. Indeed, they would necessarily occupy disjoint volumes of space. The mixing of the products and reactants contributes a large entropy increase (known as entropy of mixing) to states containing equal mixture of products and reactants and gives rise to a distinctive minimum in the Gibbs energy as a function of the extent of reaction. The standard Gibbs energy change, together with the Gibbs energy of mixing, determine the equilibrium state.\nIn this article only the constant pressure case is considered. The relation between the Gibbs free energy and the equilibrium constant can be found by considering chemical potentials.\nAt constant temperature and pressure in the absence of an applied voltage, the Gibbs free energy, G, for the reaction depends only on the extent of reaction: ξ (Greek letter xi), and can only decrease according to the second law of thermodynamics.

It can be shown that in this case, the sum of chemical potentials times the stoichiometric coefficients of the products is equal to the sum of those corresponding to the reactants. Therefore, the sum of the Gibbs energies of the reactants must be the equal to the sum of the Gibbs energies of the products.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        α\n        \n          μ\n          \n            \n              A\n            \n          \n        \n        +\n        β\n        \n          μ\n          \n            \n              B\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        σ\n        \n          μ\n          \n            \n              S\n            \n          \n        \n        +\n        τ\n        \n          μ\n          \n            \n              T\n            \n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha \\mu _{\\mathrm {A} }+\\beta \\mu _{\\mathrm {B} }=\\sigma \\mu _{\\mathrm {S} }+\\tau \\mu _{\\mathrm {T} }\\,}\n  \n\nwhere μ is in this case a partial molar Gibbs energy, a chemical potential.

For solutions, equations such as the Debye–Hückel equation or extensions such as Davies equation Specific ion interaction theory or Pitzer equations may be used. However this is not always possible. It is common practice to assume that Γ is a constant, and to use the concentration quotient in place of the thermodynamic equilibrium constant. It is also general practice to use the term equilibrium constant instead of the more accurate concentration quotient. This practice will be followed here.\nFor reactions in the gas phase partial pressure is used in place of concentration and fugacity coefficient in place of activity coefficient. In the real world, for example, when making ammonia in industry, fugacity coefficients must be taken into account. Fugacity, f, is the product of partial pressure and fugacity coefficient.

The ionic strength of a solution is given by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        I\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          ∑\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            N\n          \n        \n        \n          c\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          z\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I={\\frac {1}{2}}\\sum _{i=1}^{N}c_{i}z_{i}^{2}}\n  \n\nwhere ci and zi stand for the concentration and ionic charge of ion type i, and the sum is taken over all the N types of charged species in solution. When the concentration of dissolved salt is much higher than the analytical concentrations of the reagents, the ions originating from the dissolved salt determine the ionic strength, and the ionic strength is effectively constant. Since activity coefficients depend on ionic strength, the activity coefficients of the species are effectively independent of concentration. Thus, the assumption that Γ is constant is justified. The concentration quotient is a simple multiple of the equilibrium constant.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            \n              c\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            K\n            Γ\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{\\mathrm {c} }={\\frac {K}{\\Gamma }}}\n  \n\nHowever, Kc will vary with ionic strength. If it is measured at a series of different ionic strengths, the value can be extrapolated to zero ionic strength. The concentration quotient obtained in this manner is known, paradoxically, as a thermodynamic equilibrium constant.\nBefore using a published value of an equilibrium constant in conditions of ionic strength different from the conditions used in its determination, the value should be adjusted.\n\n\nMetastable mixtures\nA mixture may appear to have no tendency to change, though it is not at equilibrium. For example, a mixture of SO2 and O2 is metastable as there is a kinetic barrier to formation of the product, SO3.\n\n2 SO2 + O2 ⇌ 2 SO3\nThe barrier can be overcome when a catalyst is also present in the mixture as in the contact process, but the catalyst does not affect the equilibrium concentrations.\nLikewise, the formation of bicarbonate from carbon dioxide and water is very slow under normal conditions\n\nCO2 + 2 H2O  ⇌  HCO−3 + H3O+\nbut almost instantaneous in the presence of the catalytic enzyme carbonic anhydrase.\n\n\nPure substances\nWhen pure substances (liquids or solids) are involved in equilibria their activities do not appear in the equilibrium constant because their numerical values are considered one.\nApplying the general formula for an equilibrium constant to the specific case of a dilute solution of acetic acid in water one obtains\n\nCH3CO2H + H2O ⇌ CH3CO2− + H3O+\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            \n              c\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              [\n              \n                \n                  C\n                  \n                    H\n                    \n                      3\n                    \n                  \n                  C\n                  \n                    O\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  −\n                \n              \n              ]\n              [\n              \n                \n                  \n                    H\n                    \n                      3\n                    \n                  \n                  O\n                \n                \n                  +\n                \n              \n              ]\n            \n            \n              [\n              \n                C\n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    3\n                  \n                \n                C\n                \n                  O\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                H\n              \n              ]\n              [\n              \n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                O\n              \n              ]\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{\\mathrm {c} }={\\frac {\\mathrm {[{CH_{3}CO_{2}}^{-}][{H_{3}O}^{+}]} }{\\mathrm {[{CH_{3}CO_{2}H}][{H_{2}O}]} }}}\n  \n\nFor all but very concentrated solutions, the water can be considered a \"pure\" liquid, and therefore it has an activity of one.

Kw varies with variation in ionic strength and/or temperature.\nThe concentrations of H+ and OH− are not independent quantities. Most commonly [OH−] is replaced by Kw[H+]−1 in equilibrium constant expressions which would otherwise include hydroxide ion.\nSolids also do not appear in the equilibrium constant expression, if they are considered to be pure and thus their activities taken to be one.

In practice, however, the method is unreliable because error propagation almost always gives very large errors on the values calculated in this way.\n\n\nEffect of electric and magnetic fields\nThe effect of electric field on equilibrium has been studied by Manfred Eigen among others.\n\n\nTypes of equilibrium\n\nEquilibrium can be broadly classified as heterogeneous and homogeneous equilibrium. Homogeneous equilibrium consists of reactants and products belonging in the same phase whereas heterogeneous equilibrium comes into play for reactants and products in different phases.  \n\nIn the gas phase: rocket engines\nThe industrial synthesis such as ammonia in the Haber–Bosch process (depicted right) takes place through a succession of equilibrium steps including adsorption processes\nAtmospheric chemistry\nSeawater and other natural waters: chemical oceanography\nDistribution between two phases\nlog D distribution coefficient: important for pharmaceuticals where lipophilicity is a significant property of a drug\nLiquid–liquid extraction, Ion exchange, Chromatography\nSolubility product\nUptake and release of oxygen by hemoglobin in blood\nAcid–base equilibria: acid dissociation constant, hydrolysis, buffer solutions, indicators, acid–base homeostasis\nMetal–ligand complexation: sequestering agents, chelation therapy, MRI contrast reagents, Schlenk equilibrium\nAdduct formation: host–guest chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, molecular recognition, dinitrogen tetroxide\nIn certain oscillating reactions, the approach to equilibrium is not asymptotically but in the form of a damped oscillation .\nThe related Nernst equation in electrochemistry gives the difference in electrode potential as a function of redox concentrations.\nWhen molecules on each side of the equilibrium are able to further react irreversibly in secondary reactions, the final product ratio is determined according to the Curtin–Hammett principle.\nIn these applications, terms such as stability constant, formation constant, binding constant, affinity constant, association constant and dissociation constant are used. In biochemistry, it is common to give units for binding constants, which serve to define the concentration units used when the constant's value was determined.\n\n\nComposition of a mixture\nWhen the only equilibrium is that of the formation of a 1:1 adduct as the composition of a mixture, there are many ways that the composition of a mixture can be calculated. For example, see ICE table for a traditional method of calculating the pH of a solution of a weak acid.\nThere are three approaches to the general calculation of the composition of a mixture at equilibrium.\n\nThe most basic approach is to manipulate the various equilibrium constants until the desired concentrations are expressed in terms of measured equilibrium constants (equivalent to measuring chemical potentials) and initial conditions.\nMinimize the Gibbs energy of the system.\nSatisfy the equation of mass balance. The equations of mass balance are simply statements that demonstrate that the total concentration of each reactant must be constant by the law of conservation of mass.\n\n\nMass-balance equations\nIn general, the calculations are rather complicated or complex. For instance, in the case of a dibasic acid, H2A dissolved in water the two reactants can be specified as the conjugate base, A2−, and the proton, H+. The following equations of mass-balance could apply equally well to a base such as 1,2-diaminoethane, in which case the base itself is designated as the reactant A:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            \n              A\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          [\n          A\n          ]\n          +\n          [\n          H\n          A\n          ]\n          +\n          [\n          \n            H\n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          A\n          ]\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T_{\\mathrm {A} }=\\mathrm {[A]+[HA]+[H_{2}A]} \\,}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          T\n          \n            \n              H\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          [\n          H\n          ]\n          +\n          [\n          H\n          A\n          ]\n          +\n          2\n          [\n          \n            H\n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          A\n          ]\n          −\n          [\n          O\n          H\n          ]\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T_{\\mathrm {H} }=\\mathrm {[H]+[HA]+2[H_{2}A]-[OH]} \\,}\n  \n\nwith TA the total concentration of species A.

Each concentration is shown as a percentage of the total aluminium.\n\n\nSolution and precipitation\nThe diagram above illustrates the point that a precipitate that is not one of the main species in the solution equilibrium may be formed. At pH just below 5.5 the main species present in a 5 μM solution of Al3+ are aluminium hydroxides Al(OH)2+, AlOH+2 and Al13(OH)7+32, but on raising the pH Al(OH)3 precipitates from the solution. This occurs because Al(OH)3 has a very large lattice energy. As the pH rises more and more Al(OH)3 comes out of solution. This is an example of Le Châtelier's principle in action: Increasing the concentration of the hydroxide ion causes more aluminium hydroxide to precipitate, which removes hydroxide from the solution. When the hydroxide concentration becomes sufficiently high the soluble aluminate, Al(OH)−4, is formed.\nAnother common instance where precipitation occurs is when a metal cation interacts with an anionic ligand to form an electrically neutral complex. If the complex is hydrophobic, it will precipitate out of water. This occurs with the nickel ion Ni2+ and dimethylglyoxime, (dmgH2): in this case the lattice energy of the solid is not particularly large, but it greatly exceeds the energy of solvation of the molecule Ni(dmgH)2.\n\n\nMinimization of Gibbs energy\nAt equilibrium, at a specified temperature and pressure, and with no external forces, the Gibbs free energy G is at a minimum:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        G\n        =\n        \n          ∑\n          \n            j\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        \n          μ\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        \n        d\n        \n          N\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle dG=\\sum _{j=1}^{m}\\mu _{j}\\,dN_{j}=0}\n  \n\nwhere μj is the chemical potential of molecular species j, and Nj is the amount of molecular species j.

If there are a total of k types of atoms in the system, then there will be k such equations. If ions are involved, an additional row is added to the aij matrix specifying the respective charge on each molecule which will sum to zero.\nThis is a standard problem in optimisation, known as constrained minimisation. The most common method of solving it is using the method of Lagrange multipliers (although other methods may be used).\nDefine:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            G\n          \n        \n        =\n        G\n        +\n        \n          ∑\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \n          λ\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              ∑\n              \n                j\n                =\n                1\n              \n              \n                m\n              \n            \n            \n              a\n              \n                i\n                j\n              \n            \n            \n              N\n              \n                j\n              \n            \n            −\n            \n              b\n              \n                i\n              \n              \n                0\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {G}}=G+\\sum _{i=1}^{k}\\lambda _{i}\\left(\\sum _{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}N_{j}-b_{i}^{0}\\right)=0}\n  \n\nwhere the λi are the Lagrange multipliers, one for each element.

This is a set of (m + k) equations in (m + k) unknowns (the Nj and the λi) and may, therefore, be solved for the equilibrium concentrations Nj as long as the chemical activities are known as functions of the concentrations at the given temperature and pressure. (In the ideal case, activities are proportional to concentrations.) (See Thermodynamic databases for pure substances.) Note that the second equation is just the initial constraints for minimization.\nThis method of calculating equilibrium chemical concentrations is useful for systems with a large number of different molecules. The use of k atomic element conservation equations for the mass constraint is straightforward, and replaces the use of the stoichiometric coefficient equations. The results are consistent with those specified by chemical equations. For example, if equilibrium is specified by a single chemical equation:,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∑\n          \n            j\n            =\n            0\n          \n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        \n          ν\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        \n          R\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sum _{j=0}^{m}\\nu _{j}R_{j}=0}\n  \n\nwhere νj is the stoichiometric coefficient for the j th molecule (negative for reactants, positive for products) and Rj is the symbol for the j th molecule, a properly balanced equation will obey:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∑\n          \n            j\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        \n          a\n          \n            i\n            j\n          \n        \n        \n          ν\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sum _{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}\\nu _{j}=0}\n  \n\nMultiplying the first equilibrium condition by νj and using the above equation yields:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        0\n        =\n        \n          ∑\n          \n            j\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        \n          ν\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        \n          μ\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          ∑\n          \n            j\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        \n          ∑\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \n          ν\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        \n          λ\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          a\n          \n            i\n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          ∑\n          \n            j\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        \n          ν\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        \n          μ\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0=\\sum _{j=1}^{m}\\nu _{j}\\mu _{j}+\\sum _{j=1}^{m}\\sum _{i=1}^{k}\\nu _{j}\\lambda _{i}a_{ij}=\\sum _{j=1}^{m}\\nu _{j}\\mu _{j}}\n  \n\nAs above, defining ΔG\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        G\n        =\n        \n          ∑\n          \n            j\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        \n          ν\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        \n          μ\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          ∑\n          \n            j\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        \n          ν\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          μ\n          \n            j\n          \n          \n            ⊖\n          \n        \n        +\n        R\n        T\n        ln\n        ⁡\n        (\n        {\n        \n          R\n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        }\n        )\n        )\n        =\n        Δ\n        \n          G\n          \n            ⊖\n          \n        \n        +\n        R\n        T\n        ln\n        ⁡\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              ∏\n              \n                j\n                =\n                1\n              \n              \n                m\n              \n            \n            {\n            \n              R\n              \n                j\n              \n            \n            \n              }\n              \n                \n                  ν\n                  \n                    j\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        =\n        Δ\n        \n          G\n          \n            ⊖\n          \n        \n        +\n        R\n        T\n        ln\n        ⁡\n        (\n        \n          K\n          \n            c\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta G=\\sum _{j=1}^{m}\\nu _{j}\\mu _{j}=\\sum _{j=1}^{m}\\nu _{j}(\\mu _{j}^{\\ominus }+RT\\ln(\\{R_{j}\\}))=\\Delta G^{\\ominus }+RT\\ln \\left(\\prod _{j=1}^{m}\\{R_{j}\\}^{\\nu _{j}}\\right)=\\Delta G^{\\ominus }+RT\\ln(K_{c})}\n  \n\nwhere Kc is the equilibrium constant, and ΔG will be zero at equilibrium.\nAnalogous procedures exist for the minimization of other thermodynamic potentials.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\nVan Zeggeren, F.; Storey, S.
