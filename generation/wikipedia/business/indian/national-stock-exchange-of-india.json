It is the 5th largest stock exchange in the world by total market capitalization, exceeding $5 trillion in May 2024.\nNSE is under the ownership of various financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. As of 2024, it is the world's largest derivatives exchange by number of contracts traded and the third largest in cash equities by number of trades for the calendar year 2023.\n\n\nHistory\n\nNational Stock Exchange was incorporated in 1992 to bring about transparency in the Indian equity markets. NSE was set up at the behest of the Government of India, based on the recommendations laid out by the Pherwani committee in 1991 and the blueprint was prepared by a team of five members (Ravi Narain, Raghavan Puthran, K Kumar, Chitra Ramkrishna and Ashishkumar Chauhan) along with R H Patil and SS Nadkarni who were deputed by IDBI in 1992. Instead of trading memberships being confined to a group of brokers, NSE ensured that anyone who was qualified, experienced, and met the minimum financial requirements was allowed to trade.\nNSE commenced operations on 30 June 1994 starting with the wholesale debt market (WDM) segment and equities segment on 3 November 1994. It was the first exchange in India to introduce an electronic trading facility. Within one year of the start of its operations, the daily turnover on NSE exceeded that of the BSE.\nOperations in the derivatives segment commenced on 12 June 2000. In August 2008, NSE introduced currency derivatives.\nIn 2012, NSE launched the NSE EMERGE platform for the listing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and startup companies in India.\nIn May 2013, NSE launched India's first dedicated trading platform for debt-related products.\nIn June 2017, NSE established the NSE International Exchange (NSE IX), which is a universal multi assets exchange headquartered in the GIFT City.

Total market capitalization of NSE-listed companies was ₹438.9 lakh crore (US$5.13 trillion), as of 31 December 2024.\nAs of December 2023, there were 190 ETFs listed on the NSE, including ETFs on equity, debt and commodity asset classes. The first InvIT listed on the NSE in 2017 and the first REIT in 2019.\nAs of January 2025, NSE has over 11 crore unique registered investors.\n\n\nIndices\nNSE Indices operates NSE's broad-based, sectoral, thematic, strategy and fixed-income indices. The flagship index NIFTY 50 was launched on 22 April 1996, with a base value of 1,000 on the base date of 3 November 1995.\n\n\nDerivatives\nThe NSE allows trading of futures and options contracts of indices and single stock contracts.\nOn 3 May 2012, the National Stock exchange launched derivative contracts (futures and options) on FTSE 100, a widely tracked index of the UK equity stock market.

NSE has also provided mock market simulation software called NSE Learn to Trade (NLT) to develop investment, trading, and portfolio management skills among the students. The simulation software is very similar to the software currently being used by the market professionals and helps students to learn how to trade in the markets. NSE also conducts online examinations and awards certification, under its Certification in Financial Markets (NCFM) programs. NSE has set up NSE Academy Limited to further financial literacy.\nAt present, certifications are available in 46 modules, covering different sectors of financial and capital markets, both at the beginner and advanced levels. The list of various modules can be found at the official site of NSE India. In addition, since August 2009, it has offered a short-term course called NSE Certified Capital Market Professional (NCCMP).\n\n\nCriticism and controversies\n\nNSE has witnessed several high-profile market manipulation scandals including the co-location manipulation instance. At times, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has barred several individuals and entities from trading on the exchange for insider trading, stock manipulation, especially in illiquid smallcaps and penny stocks.\n\n\nMarket operators\n\nMarket operators continue to operate in the NSE, albeit within a regulatory framework aimed at ensuring transparency and fairness. Market operators are individuals or entities that actively engage in buying and selling securities to influence their prices for profit. They operate through various strategies, such as arbitrage, short selling, high-frequency trading, front running, churning, scalping, wash trading, spoofing, and layering, often leveraging sophisticated technology and large capital. Regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) oversee market activities to curb malpractices such as insider trading, price rigging, and market manipulation. SEBI has implemented measures, including surveillance systems, to detect and penalize unethical practices. Despite these regulations, market operators exploit loopholes to gain an edge, necessitating continuous vigilance and regulatory updates. Market operators often use the pump and dump strategy, despite strict regulations against such practices. This scheme involves artificially inflating the price of a stock through false or misleading positive statements. Once the price has been significantly raised, the operators then sell off their holdings at the inflated prices, leading to a sharp price decline and substantial losses for other investors who bought in at the higher prices. Their activities have continued to impact market volatility, liquidity, and price discovery, playing a significant role in the dynamics of NSE. \n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",
