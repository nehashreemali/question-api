The group has operations in over 100 countries, with a presence in aerospace, agribusiness, aftermarket automotive components, construction equipment, defence, energy, farm equipment, finance and insurance, industrial equipment, information technology, leisure and hospitality, logistics, real estate, retail and education.  The group's flagship company Mahindra & Mahindra has market leadership in utility vehicles as well as tractors in India.\n\n\nHistory\nMahindra & Mahindra was incorporated as Mahindra & Mohammed in 1945 by the brothers J. C. Mahindra and K. C. Mahindra, and Malik Ghulam Muhammad in Ludhiana, Punjab to trade steel.  Following the Partition of India in 1947, Malik Ghulam Muhammad left the company and emigrated to Pakistan, where he became the first finance minister of the new state (and later the third Governor General in 1951). In 1948, K. C. Mahindra changed the company's name to Mahindra & Mahindra.\nBuilding on their expertise in the steel industry, the Mahindra brothers began trading steel with UK suppliers. They won a contract to manufacture Willys Jeeps in India and began producing them in 1947. By 1956, the company was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, and by 1969 the company became an exporter of utility vehicles and spare parts.  Like many Indian companies, Mahindra responded to the restrictions of the Licence Raj by expanding into other industries. Mahindra & Mahindra created a tractor division in 1982 and a tech division (now Tech Mahindra) in 1986. It has continued to diversify its operations through both joint ventures and greenfield investments.\nBy 1994, the group had become so diverse that it undertook a fundamental reorganization, dividing into six Strategic Business Units: Automotive; Farm Equipment; Infrastructure; Trade and Financial services; Information Technology; and Automotive Components (known internally as Systech). The new managing director, Anand Mahindra, followed this reorganization with a new logo in 2000 and the successful launch of the Mahindra Scorpio (a wholly indigenously designed vehicle) in 2002. Along with an overhaul in production and manufacturing methods, these changes helped make the company more competitive, and since then the Group's reputation and revenues have risen noticeably. Currently, Mahindra & Mahindra is one of the 20 largest companies in India In 2009, Forbes ranked Mahindra among the top 200 most reputable companies in the world.\nIn January 2011, the Mahindra Group launched a new corporate brand, Mahindra Rise, to unify Mahindra's image across industries and geographies. The brand positions Mahindra products and services as aspirational, supporting customers' ambitions to 'Rise.'\nIn April 2012, the Mahindra Group expressed interest in purchasing the bankrupt automobile company Saab, and placed several bids for Saab, though was outbid by Saab's new owner National Electric Vehicle Sweden.\n\n\nAffiliated companies\n\nAerospace\nMahindra Aerostructures\nAftermarket\nMahindra FirstChoice Services\nMahindra First Choice Wheels\nAgribusiness\nMahindra Agribusiness Division\nEPC Mahindra\nAutomotive\nMahindra & Mahindra\nComponents\nMahindra Accelo\nConsulting\nMahindra Integrated Business Solutions\nMahindra Logisoft\nMahindra Special Services Group\nDefence\nMahindra & Mahindra – Military Defence Division\nEducation\nMahindra United World College of India\nMahindra École Centrale\nEnergy\nMahindra Solarize\nMahindra teqo\nMahindra Susten\nFarm equipment\nMahindra & Mahindra – Farm Equipment Division\nMahindra USA Inc\nMahindra Yueda (Yancheng) Tractor Co\nMahindra Tractors\nErkunt Tractor\nGromax Agri Equipment\nMahindra Swaraj\nJiangling Tractors\nFinancial services\nMahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Limited\nHospitality\nMahindra Holidays and Resorts\nInformation Technology\nTech Mahindra\nLogistics\nMahindra Logistics\nEcommerce\nM2ALL\nReal estate\nMahindra Lifespaces\nMahindra World City\nSports\nMahindra Racing\nMedia\nHungama Digital Media Entertainment\n\n\nCommunity initiatives\nThe Mahindra Group is extensively involved in philanthropy and volunteering.  It is considered an active participant in the Indian Corporate Social Responsibility field and received the Pegasus Award for CSR in 2007.  Mahindra engages in philanthropy primarily through the KC Mahindra Trust, which serves as the CSR arm of the group (although many subsidiaries have their own CSR initiatives, notably Tech Mahindra and Mahindra Satyam).  Founded in 1953 by K.C Mahindra, the trust focuses primarily on fostering literacy in India and promoting higher learning through grants and scholarships.  Mahindra operates several vocational schools as well as the Mahindra United World College.  The KC Mahindra Trust's primary project however is Project Nanhi Kali, which targets the education of young Indian girls. The foundation currently supports the education of approximately 153,190 underprivileged girls.  Other initiatives include Mahindra Hariyali (a 1 million tree planting campaign) as well as sponsorship of the Lifeline Express, a mobile hospital train.  Mahindra employees also plan and lead their own service projects through Mahindra's Employee Social Options Plans.
