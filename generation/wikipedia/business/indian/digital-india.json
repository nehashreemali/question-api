Some take issue with technological determinism, the notion that ICTs are a sure-fire antidote to the world's problems. Instead, governments must adjust solutions to the specific political and social context of their nation. Others note that technology amplifies underlying institutional forces, so technology must be accompanied by significant changes in policy and institutions to have a meaningful impact.\nIt is thought that there needs to be more research on the actual worth of these multimillion-dollar government and ICT for development projects. For the most part, the technological revolution in India has benefited the already privileged sectors of Indians. It is also difficult to scale up initiatives to affect all Indians, and fundamental attitudinal and institutional change is still an issue. While much ICT research has been conducted in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Gujarat, poorer states such as Bihar and Odisha are rarely mentioned.\nDigital India as a programme has been considered by some as a continuation of the long history of bias towards RIL, which has previously manifested in the form of altering TRAI regulations in favour of the company. Reliance Jio has cited the Digital India initiative numerous times for its marketing purposes.\nThe government has faced criticism over frequent data breaches. The Aadhaar biometrics have been criticised for being an easy target for hackers.\n\n\nAlso have a look on\nCommon Service Centres\nInternet in India\nTelecommunications in India\nMobile telephone numbering in India\nList of mobile phone brands by country\nList of countries by Internet connection speeds\nList of countries by smartphone penetration\nElectronics and semiconductor manufacturing industry in India\nFlexible electronics\nIndia.gov.in\nNational e-Governance Plan\nStandup India\nMake in India\nSmart Cities Mission\nDigital Literacy\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nMinistry of Electronics & IT",
