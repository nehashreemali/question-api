Nilekani became the chief executive officer of Infosys in March 2002 and served as CEO of the company through April 2007, when he relinquished his position to his colleague Kris Gopalakrishnan and became co-chairman of the board of directors. Before assuming leadership as CEO in 2002, Nilekani held various posts, including managing director, president, and chief operating officer. He served as its CEO from March 2002 to April 2007.

The identification method will be biometric, and the drive to create this government database of the entire population of India has been called \"the biggest social project on the planet.\"\nThey developed Aadhaar, which is an Indian biometric ID system, a database, which contains demographic information, home addresses of Indians.
