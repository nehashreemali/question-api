  "extract": "Make in India is an initiative by the Government of India to create and encourage companies to develop, manufacture and assemble products in India and incentivize dedicated investments into manufacturing. The policy approach was to create a conducive environment for investments, develop a modern and efficient infrastructure, and open up new sectors for foreign capital.\nMake in India has been unsuccessful at achieving its stated targets. Under this programme, the share of manufacturing in GDP was projected to reach 25% by 2022. However, the GDP share of manufacturing has actually fallen from 16.7% in 2013–2014 to 15.9% in 2023–2024.\n\n\nHistory\nAnnounced in 2014, \"Make in India\" had three stated objectives:\n\nto increase the manufacturing sector's growth rate to 12-14% per annum;\nto create 100 million additional manufacturing jobs in the economy by 2022;\nto ensure that the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP is increased to 25% by 2022 (later revised to 2025).\nAfter the launch, India gave investment commitments worth ₹16.40 lakh crore (US$190 billion) and investment inquiries worth of ₹1.5 lakh crore (US$18 billion) between September 2014 to February 2016.\nAs per the current policy, 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted in all 100 sectors, except for Space industry (74%), defence industry (49%) and Media of India (26%). Japan and India had also announced a US$12 billion 'Japan-India Make-in-India Special Finance Facility\" fund to push investment.\nIn line with the Make in India, individual states too launched their own local initiatives, such as \"Utkarsh Odisha\", \"Tamil Nadu Global Investors Meet\", \"Vibrant Gujarat\", \"Happening Haryana\", and \"Magnetic Maharashtra\". India received US$60 billion FDI in FY 2016–17.\nThe World Bank's 2019 ease of doing business index acknowledges India's jump of 23 positions against its rank of 100 in 2017 to be placed now at 63rd rank among 190 countries. By the end of 2017, India had risen 42 places on the ease of doing business index, 32 places in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, and 19 notches in the Logistics Performance Index.\nThe growth rate of manufacturing averaged 6.9% per annum between 2014–15 and 2019–20. The share of manufacturing dropped from 16.3% of GDP in 2014–15 to 14.3% in 2020–21, and dropped further to 14.1% in 2023–24.\nThree capital acquisition proposals worth ₹4,276 crore were cleared for the government's Make-In-India scheme on January 10, 2023. Due to a lack of awareness of transparent legal protection and law enforcement, hesitated investors and slow progress are the main difficulties in building a business-friendly environment. With some big companies finally tried to fulfill \"make in India\" decades after, however, it did not achieve enough jobs as expected.\n\n\nThe \"Make In India\" initiative\n\n\nEase of doing business\nIn 2019, India was ranked at 63rd place out of 190 countries in the World Bank's ease of doing business index, up from 130th in 2016. In February 2017, the government appointed the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the National Productivity Council \"to sensitise actual users and get their feedback on various reform measures.\" As a result, now there is competition among the states of India to improve their current ranking on the ease of doing business index based on the completion percentage scores on 98-point action plan for business reform under Make in India initiative.\n\n\nOngoing global campaign\nThe campaign was designed by Wieden+Kennedy, with the launch of a web portal and release of brochures on the 25 sectors, after foreign equity caps, norms and procedures in various sectors were relaxed, including application of manufacturing application made available online and the validity of licenses was increased to three years.\n\"Zero Defect Zero Effect\" slogan was coined by Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, to guide the Make in India initiative that produces products with no defects with no adverse environmental and ecological effects.\n\"Make in India Week\" multi-sectoral industrial event at the MMRDA from 13 February 2016 was attended by 2500+ international and 8000+ domestic, foreign government delegations from 68 countries and business teams from 72 countries and all Indian states also held expos. Event received over ₹15.2 lakh crore (US$180 billion) worth of investment commitments and investment inquiries worth ₹1.5 lakh crore (US$18 billion), where Maharashtra led with ₹8 lakh crore (US$95 billion) of investments. Previously between September 2014 and November 2015, the government received ₹1.20 lakh crore (US$14 billion) worth of proposals from companies interested in manufacturing electronics in India.\n\n\nRevision in Public Procurement Order & GFR\nOn June 15, 2017, Ministry of Commerce and Industry (India), the nodal ministry revised the Indian public procurement order and general financial rule to incorporate preference to Make In India. Subsequently, all the nodal agencies published their own orders to extended the scope of Make In India in procurement related to their line of products.\n\n\nSectors covered\n\nMake in India focuses on the following 25 sectors of the economy:\n\n\nAutomobiles\n\nGeneral Motors announced an investment of US$1 billion to manufacture automobiles in Maharashtra.\nIn April 2017, Kia announced that the company would invest over $1.1 billion to build a car manufacturing plant in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh.

Kia president Han-Woo Park announced that the first model produced at the plant would be an SUV(sport utility vehicle) specifically designed for the Indian market. Park also added that Kia would invest over $2 billion and create 10,000 jobs in India by 2021.\n\n\nAutomobile components\n\nHitachi announced an auto-component plant in Chennai by 2016 with an increase in their India employees count from 10,000 to 13,000.\n\n\nAviation\n\nBefore the Make in India campaign had been put in motion, the first deal to have been done under the broader Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign was the Fairchild-Dornier 228's manufacturing by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, by Pushpindar Singh Chopra. French drone manufacturer LH Aviation announced a manufacturing plant in India to produce drones. During Magnetic Maharashtra: Convergence 2018, Thurst Aircraft Pvt Ltd signed a MOU with Govt. of Maharashtra to build an aeroplane manufacturing plant near Palghar district (roughly 140 km north of Mumbai) with an investment of ₹35,000 crore($5.2 billion).\n\n\nBiotechnology\nOn 6 July 2024, Horiba's largest medical equipment and hematology reagent production facility in India was officially opened in Nagpur. The company plans to invest ₹200 crore in phases at the Nagpur plant, which will cater to more than 30,000 hospitals and diagnostic facilities. It will produce medical consumables (reagents), clinical chemistry equipment, and equipment for blood tests. It will act as a hub for exports to nearby nations, with a 50% localization objective initially, and a target of 80–90% localization of products in the future. With aspirations to eventually expand into the Materials & Semiconductor and Energy & Environment sectors, the factory will initially serve the Bio & Healthcare segment.\n\n\nDefence manufacturing\n\nAs part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Narendra Modi Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self Reliant India Campaign), India's ministry of defence last month reserved 26 items that will only be procured from the local suppliers.\nIndia and Russia have deepened their Make in India defence manufacturing cooperation by signing agreements for the construction of naval frigates, KA-226T twin-engine utility helicopters (joint venture (JV) to make 60 in Russia and 140 in India), Brahmos cruise missile (JV with 50.5% India and 49.5% Russia). A defence deal was signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia in December 2015 which will see the Kamov Ka-226 multi-role helicopter being built in India, was widely seen as the first defence deal to be actually signed under the Make in India campaign. In August 2015, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) began talks with Russia's Irkut Corp to transfer technology of 332 components of the Sukhoi Su-30MKI fighter aircraft under the Make in India program. These components, also called line replacement units (LRUs) refer to both critical and non-critical components and fall into four major heads such as Radio and Radar; Electrical & Electronics System; Mechanical System and Instrument System.\nLockheed Martin announced in February 2016 its plans to manufacture F-16 in India, although it did not announce any time frame. In February 2017, Lockheed stated that it intended to manufacture the F-16 Block-70 aircraft with a local partner in India, if the Indian Air Force agreed to purchase the aircraft.\nBoeing announced setting up a factory to assemble fighter planes, either the Apache or Chinook defence helicopter in India, as well as the manufacture of F/A-18 Super Hornet.\n\nIn May 2018, the Indian Army announced a ₹50,000 crore (US$5.9 billion) ammunition production project to be implemented in phases over a 10-year period. Under the project, 11 private firms will manufacture and supply ammunition for the Army's tanks, rockets, air defence system, artillery guns, infantry combat vehicles, grenade launchers, and other field weapons. The Army noted that the objectives of the program were to cut dependence on foreign imports and to establish an inventory of ammunition that would be sufficient to fight a 30-day war. The Indian government is also focusing upon indigenous defence communication systems. On 7th October 2025, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) released ISRA (Indian radio software architecture) to enable interoperability in military communication. A private-academia collaboration between CST Advanced Systems Pvt. Ltd and IIT Jammu developed anti-GPS jamming and identification friend or foe (IFF) devices to address the critical challenges like secure and reliable communication. The devices aim at enhancing the operational efficiency and effectiveness of the armed forces during counter terrorism, raids and other specialized operations.\n\n\nElectronic systems\n\nWith the demand for electronic hardware expected to rise rapidly to US$400 billion by 2020, India has the potential to become an electronic manufacturing hub and government is targeting to achieve net zero imports of electronics by 2020. After the launch of this project, 24.8% of smartphones sold in India in the April–June quarter of 2015 were made in India, up from 19.9% the previous quarter. By 2019 that number has jumped to 95%.\nVarious companies pledged investment in India to begin manufacturing\n\nFoxconn: US$5 billion investment over 5 years in research and development and hi-tech semiconductor manufacturing facility in Maharashtra but it backed out from the MOU as it could not acquire the land parcel at the terms it wanted.\nPegatron: Apple Inc supplier Pegatron in talks to open second Indian iPhone factory.\nHuawei: new research and development (R&D) campus in Bengaluru with an investment of US$170 million and telecom hardware manufacturing plant in Chennai.\nMotorola Mobility: manufacturing at Sriperumbudur near Chennai run by Flextronics.\nMicromax: 3 new manufacturing units in Rajasthan, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh with ₹3 billion (US$35 million) investment.\nQualcomm: \"Design in India\" programme to mentor ten Indian hardware companies with the potential to come up with innovative solutions and help them reach global scale.\nSamsung: 10 \"MSME-Samsung Technical Schools\" and manufacturing of Samsung Z1 in its plant in Noida.\nSpice Group: ₹5 billion (US$59 million) mobile phone manufacturing unit in Uttar Pradesh.\nVivo Mobile India began manufacturing smartphones at a plant in Greater Noida with 2,200 employees.\nWistron: Taiwanese company to start manufacturing of Blackberry, HTC and Motorola devices at a new factory in Noida.\nXiaomi: smartphones to be manufactured at a Foxconn-run facility in Sri City made operational by producing Xiaomi Redmi 2 Prime.\nVVDN Technologies: ODM based out of India expanded its manufacturing with additional 10-acre Global Innovation Park in India in line with government's Make in India initiative.\n\n\nFood processing\n\nPitha of Odisha, Gushtaba of Kashmir, Chicken Curry of Punjab, Khakhra and Khandvi of Gujarat, Bamboo steam fish, Vada and Medu vada of South India, Khaja and Inarsa of Bihar, Kebab of Uttar Pradesh and Puran poli of Maharashtra have been selected as traditional regional food to be promoted in the ongoing campaign.\nMarine Products Export Development Authority announced the deal to supply shrimp eggs to farmer in India for eventual exports of shrimp from India to other countries.\nIn Odisha Investor Summit, Poseidon Aquatech announced plans to undertake shrimp farming and processing in the state at the cost of ₹100 crore ($14.7 million).\nNoodles manufacturer Indo Nissin Foods Ltd also announced that it intended to invest additional ₹50 crore ($7.3 million) to expand the existing facility in Odisha by 2017.\n\n\nMining\n\nDuring Odisha investor summit, NLC India signed an MOU with government of Odisha to set up a coal mining processing plant at the cost of ₹7,500 crore ($1.1 billion).\n\n\nRailways\n\nAlstom/GE Transportation: The French and American rolling stock manufacturers announced ₹400 billion (US$4.7 billion) locomotive manufacturing factories in Madhepura and Marhaura in Bihar.
