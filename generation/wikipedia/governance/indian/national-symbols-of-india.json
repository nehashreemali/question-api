  "extract": "The Government of India has designated official national symbols that represent the Republic of India. These symbols serve as the representation of the identity of the country. When India obtained independence from the British Raj on 15 August 1947, the tricolour flag officially became the first national symbol of the Dominion of India. The Indian Rupee which was in circulation earlier was adopted as the official legal tender after independence. The official state emblem with the motto Satyameva Jayate was adopted later on 30 December 1947. The national anthem and song were adopted two days before the Constitution of India was adopted on 26 January 1950. After India became a republic following the enactment of the constitution, the national symbols officially came to represent the Republic of India. The last to be adopted as a national symbol was the national microbe Lactobacillus delbrueckii in October 2012.\n\n\nList of national and official symbols\n\n\nSee also\nList of Indian state symbols\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nNational Symbols.
