  "extract": "Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal, and faces east. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone. Christ the Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide.\nThe statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the 700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca National Park overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. This statue is the largest Art Deco–style sculpture in the world. A symbol of Christianity around the world, the statue has also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.\n\n\nHistory\n\nVincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss first suggested placing a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado in the mid-1850s to honor Princess Isabel, regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro II, but the project was not approved. In 1889, the country became a republic, and owing to the separation of church and state, the proposed statue was dismissed.\n\nThe Catholic Circle of Rio made a second proposal for a landmark statue on the mountain in 1920. The group organized an event called Semana do Monumento (\"Monument Week\") to attract donations and collect signatures to support the building of the statue. The organization was motivated by what they perceived as \"Godlessness\" in the society. The donations came mostly from Brazilian Catholics. The designs considered for the \"Statue of the Christ\" included a representation of the Christian cross, a statue of Jesus with a globe in his hands, and a pedestal symbolizing the world. Eventually, the statue of Christ the Redeemer with open arms, a symbol of peace, was chosen.\nLocal engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and artist Carlos Oswald designed the statue. French sculptor Paul Landowski created the work.\n\nIn 1922, Landowski commissioned fellow Parisian Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida, who studied sculpture at the Fine Arts Conservatory in Bucharest and in Italy. A group of engineers and technicians studied Landowski's submissions, and they felt building the structure out of reinforced concrete (designed by Albert Caquot) instead of steel was more suitable for the cross-shaped statue. The concrete making up the base was supplied from Limhamn, Sweden. The outer layers are soapstone, chosen for its enduring qualities and ease of use. Construction took nine years, from 1922 to 1931, and cost the equivalent of US$250,000 (equivalent to $4,400,000 in 2024) and the monument opened on October 12, 1931. During the opening ceremony, the statue was to be lit by a battery of floodlights turned on remotely by Italian shortwave radio inventor Guglielmo Marconi, stationed 9,200 kilometres (5,700 mi) away in Rome but because of bad weather, the lights were activated on site.\nIn October 2006, on the 75th anniversary of the statue's completion, Cardinal Eusebio Oscar Scheid, Archbishop of Rio, consecrated a chapel, named after Brazil's patron saint—Our Lady of the Apparition—under the statue, allowing Catholics to hold baptisms and weddings there.\n\nLightning struck the statue during a violent thunderstorm on February 10, 2008, causing some damage to the fingers, head and eyebrows. The Rio de Janeiro state government initiated a restoration effort to replace some of the outer soapstone layers and repair the lightning rods on the statue. Lightning damaged it again on January 17, 2014, dislodging a finger on the right hand.In 2010, a massive restoration of the statue began. Work included cleaning, replacing the mortar and soapstone on the exterior, restoring iron in the internal structure, and waterproofing the monument. Vandals attacked the statue during renovation, spraying paint along the arm. Mayor Eduardo Paes called the act \"a crime against the nation\". The culprits later apologized and presented themselves to the police.\nIn reference to Brazilian striker Ronaldo's usual goal celebration of both arms outstretched, the Pirelli tyre company ran a 1998 commercial in which he replaced the statue while in an Inter Milan strip. The commercial was controversial with the Catholic Church.\n\n\nRestoration\n\nIn 1990, several organizations, including the Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro, media company Grupo Globo, oil company Shell do Brasil, environmental regulator IBAMA, National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage, and the city government of Rio de Janeiro entered into an agreement to conduct restoration work.\nMore work on the statue and its environs was conducted in 2003 and early 2010. In 2003, a set of escalators, walkways, and elevators were installed to facilitate access to the platform surrounding the statue. The four-month restoration in 2010 focused on the statue itself. The statue's internal structure was renovated and its soapstone mosaic covering was restored by removing a crust of fungi and other microorganisms and repairing small cracks. The lightning rods located in the statue's head and arms were also repaired, and new lighting fixtures were installed at the foot of the statue.\nThe restoration involved one hundred people and used more than 60,000 pieces of stone taken from the same quarry as the original statue.  During the unveiling of the restored statue, it was illuminated with green-and-yellow lighting in support of the Brazil national football team playing in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nMaintenance work needs to be conducted periodically because of the strong winds and erosion to which the statue is exposed, as well as lightning strikes. The original pale stone is no longer available in sufficient quantity, and replacement stones are increasingly darker in hue.\n\n\nSimilar structures\nAngola\nCristo Rei in Lubango (14 m, 46 ft)\nArgentina/Chile\nChrist the Redeemer of the Andes\nBolivia\nCristo de la Concordia in Cochabamba (34 m, 112 ft)\nBrazil\nCristo Luz in Balneário Camboriú, Santa Catarina\nChrist the Protector in Encantado, Rio Grande do Sul (43 m, 141 ft)\nStatue in Jataí, southern Goiás\nChrist in the Mount in Pitangui, Minas Gerais\nChrist the Redeemer in Rio Verde, Goiás\nColombia\nCristo Rey in Cali (26 m, 85 ft)\nCuba\nChrist of Havana in Havana, inspired by Christ the Redeemer (20 m, 66 ft)\nDominican Republic\nCristo Redentor, Puerto Plata\nEast Timor\nCristo Rei of Dili in Dili (27 m, 89 ft)\nHonduras\nChrist at El Picacho in Tegucigalpa\nIndia\nImitation statue of Christ the Redeemer at Nellore, state of Andhra Pradesh\nImitation at St. Joseph Shrine, Vizhinjam, near Trivandrum, Kerala, India\nImitation at Ecopark, Kolkata, India\nIndonesia\nChrist Blessing in Manado, North Sulawesi (30 m, 98 ft)\nPatung Yesus Kristus in Mansinam Island, West Papua, Indonesia (30 m, 98 ft)\nItaly\nCristo Redentore (Christ the Redeemer) of Maratea (21 m, 69 ft)\nPhilippines\nRisen Christ statue on top of Tombol Hill in Rosario, Batangas\nLebanon\nChrist the King, past Nahr al-Kalb on the coast\nMalaysia\nChrist the Redeemer of Malacca, on the Portuguese Settlement Square in Melaka (20 ft, 6.1 m)\nMalta\nTas-Salvatur in Gozo (12 m, 39 ft)\nMexico\nCristo Rey on the Cerro del Cubilete in Guanajuato, inspired by Rio's Christ the Redeemer (23 m, 75 ft)\nCristo del Sagrado Corazón, Villas San Pedro, Carretera Libre Tijuana Ensenada Km 37.5, Playa de Rosarito, Baja California (75 foot, 40 ton, steel and fiberglass, colored)\nCristo Rey in Tenancingo, México (30 m, 98 ft)\nCristo Rey, at Iglesia de San Martín de Porres near Colonia Los Álamos, Tijuana, Baja California (23 m, 75 ft 30 cm)\nCristo de las Noas in Torreón (22 m, 72 ft)\nNigeria\nJesus de Greatest in Imo, Africa's tallest statue of Jesus and fifth tallest statue on the continent (8.53 m, 28.0 ft)\nPeru\nCristo Blanco in Cusco\nCristo del Pacífico in Lima, erected in 2011 (37 m, 121 ft)\nCristo Redentor in Barranca Province, Lima Region, Peru\nStatue in Yungay\nPoland\nChrist the King in Świebodzin (33 m, 108 ft)\nPortugal\nCristo Rei (Christ the King) in Almada (28 m, 92 ft)\nCristo Rei, Madeira on Madeira island, completed in 1927 (15 m, 49 ft)\nRomania\nStatuia Inima lui Iisus in Harghita.
