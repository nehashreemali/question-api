  "extract": "The Tapti River (or Tapi) is a river in central India located to the south of the Narmada River that flows westwards before draining into the Arabian Sea. The river has a length of around 724 km (450 miles) and flows through the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. It flows through the city of Surat, in Gujarat, and is crossed by the Magdalla, ONGC Bridge.\n\nOn 7 August 1968, before the construction of the Ukai Dam to bring its waters under control and provide hydroelectric power, the Tapti River overflowed its banks during heavy rains in the monsoon season. More than 1,000 people drowned in the flood, and the city of Surat was submerged beneath 10 feet of water for several days. After the floodwaters receded, at least 1,000 more people died in Gujarat during a cholera epidemic from the contamination of the drinking water. The Tapti basin covers parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.\n\n\nCourse\nThe Tapti River rises in Multai, in Madhya Pradesh, and with a total length of 724 km is the second longest west-flowing river in India, after the Narmada River. The Tapti travels east to west and flows through the Indian states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. It drains into the Gulf of Khambhat, in the Arabian Sea, in Gujarat. The Tapti River has 14 major tributaries, four are right bank and ten are left bank tributaries. The right bank tributaries originate in the Satpura range and include the Vaki, Aner, Arunawati, and Gomai. The left bank tributaries include the Nesu, Amravati, Buray, Panjhara, Bori, Girna, Waghur, Purna, Mona, and Sipna. They originate in the Gawilgarh hills, Ajanta hills, the Western Ghats, and Satmalas.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe river is supposedly named after the goddess Tapati, the daughter of Surya, the Sun god and Chhaya. Tapati is the sister of Shani, Bhadra, Yamuna and Yama.\n\nSurat, Bhusawal, Burhanpur and Multai towns are located near Tapti River.\n\n\nSee also\nGulf of Khambhat\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links",
