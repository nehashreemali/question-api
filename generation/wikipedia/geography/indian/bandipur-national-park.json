After this, the governments of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka agreed to ban night traffic in the forest.  \n\n\nSee also\n\n2019 Bandipur forest fires\nArid Forest Research Institute\nIndian Council of Forestry Research and Education\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nPark brochure from Karnataka Forest Department",
