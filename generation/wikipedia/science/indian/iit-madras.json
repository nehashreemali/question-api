  "extract": "The Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras or IITM) is a public research university and technical institute located in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Along with being recognized as an Institute of Eminence, IIT Madras is widely regarded as one of India’s most prestigious higher education institutions, consistently ranking first nationally in engineering and overall categories by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) for many years.\nAs an Indian Institute of Technology, IIT Madras is also recognized as an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India. Founded in 1959 with technical, academic and financial assistance from the government of West Germany, IITM was the third Indian Institute of Technology to be established.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1956, the West German Government rendered technical assistance to establish a state-of-the-art engineering institute in India. Soon, the first Indo-German agreement was signed in Bonn, West Germany, in 1959 for the establishment of the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras (now Chennai). IIT Madras was started with technical, academic and financial assistance from the Government of West Germany. It was at the time the most significant international educational project sponsored by the Federal Republic of Germany. As part of the agreement, the West German government committed to providing various forms of assistance for the development of the institute in Madras:\n\nA workshop, laboratory equipment, and a library whose total value does not exceed ₹1.8 crore (equivalent to ₹166 crores or $20 million in 2024) .\nTwenty German professors to serve at the institute for a period of four to five years\nFour German foremen for the workshops of the institute for two years\nFacilities for the training of twenty Indian teachers in German institutions\nThis has led to several collaborative research efforts with universities and institutions in Germany over the years. Although official support from the German government has ended, several research efforts involving the DAAD programme and Humboldt Fellowships still exist.\nThe Indian Institute of Technology, Madras started functioning with the first batch of 120 students being admitted in July 1959 to the first year of the Engineering Course. The institute was inaugurated in 1959, by the then Union Minister for Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs. The first batch had an overall strength of 120 students from across India. In 1961, the IITs were declared to be Institutes of National Importance. The first convocation ceremony was held on 11 July 1964, with Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, then the president of India, delivering the convocation address and awarding the degrees to the inaugural batch of students. The institute got its first women students in the BTech batch of 1966. IIT Madras celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2009, and its Diamond Jubilee in 2019.\n\n\nCampus\n\nThe main entrance of IIT Madras is on Sardar Patel Road, flanked by the residential districts of Adyar and Velachery. The campus is close to the Raj Bhavan, the official residence of the Governor of Tamil Nadu. Other entrances are located in Velachery (near Anna Garden MTC bus stop, Velachery Main Road), Gandhi Road and Taramani gate (close to Ascendas Tech Park). The campus is located 10 km (6.2 mi) from the Chennai Airport, 12 km (7.5 mi) from the Chennai Central Railway station, and is connected by city buses. Kasturba Nagar is the nearest station on the Chennai MRTS line.\nTwo parallel roads, Bonn Avenue and Delhi Avenue, cut through the faculty residential area before they meet at the Gajendra Circle, near the Administrative Block. Buses regularly ply between the Main Gate, Gajendra Circle, the Academic Zone, and the Hostel Zone.\n\n\nStudent Hostels\n\nMost students at IIT Madras reside in student hostels, where extracurricular activities complement the academic routine. The campus has 21 hostels, of which six —Sabarmati, Sarayu, Sharavati, Swarnamukhi, and the convertible Tunga-Bhadra — are currently exclusively for women. In earlier times, each hostel had attached dining facilities, but all of them have been closed down starting around 2010. Dining facilities are provided in three centralised halls: Nilgiri, Vindhya and Himalaya. Recently (2023), a new mess has been opened in the old Cauvery hostel mess for Jain food. Students are assigned to hostels upon matriculation, where they usually reside for the entire duration of their course of study.\nThe hostels of IITM are:\n\nMandakini, Sindhu, Pampa, Mahanadhi and Tamiraparani are seven-storeyed, whereas all the other hostels are three or four-storeyed. The latter four hostels can accommodate more than 1,200 students. The older hostels were all three-storeyed till the early 2000s, when extra rooms were added. An additional new floor in the three-storeyed hostels, which generally house the undergraduate students, and a new block in place of the mess halls of these hostels have been constructed to accommodate the increased intake of students. These new blocks could be used as entrances for these hostels. As of 2022, the old Mandakini has been demolished and a new multi-storey block opened, with provision to accommodate approximately 1200 students.\n\n\nFacilities\nIIT Madras provides residential accommodation for its students, faculty, administrative and supporting staff, and their families. The residential houses employ private caterers. The self-contained campus includes two schools               (Vanavani and Kendriya Vidyalaya), three temples (Jalakanteshwara, Durga Peliamman and Ganapathi), three bank branches (SBI, ICICI, Canara Bank), a hospital, shopping centres, food shops, a gym, sleeping room and cricket, football, hockey and badminton stadiums. The Internet is available in the academic zone and the faculty and staff residential zone. Earlier, the Internet was limited in the hostel zone from 2:00 pm to midnight and from 5:00 am to 8:00 am. However, increasing demand during the academic semester led to round-the-clock Internet service.\nIIT Madras also has supercomputing capability, with the IBM Virgo Super Cluster with 97 teraflops worth of computational power.\n\n\nSatellite Campuses\nIIT Madras set up an offshore campus in Tanzania in Africa as part of the Central government's IIT expansion plans abroad.  \nIn July 2023, education officials of India and Tanzania confirmed that the IIT Madras satellite campus in the Tanzanian autonomous territory of Zanzibar began offering classes in October 2023. IITM - Zanzibar is also the first IIT to have a female director, with Prof. Preeti Aghalayam heading the Zanzibar Campus.\nIn  2024, IIT Madras proposed plans to establish a second satellite campus internationally in Sri Lanka.\n\n\nOrganisation and administration\n\n\nGovernance\nIIT Madras is an autonomous statutory organisation functioning within the Institutes of Technology Act. The twenty-three IITs are administered centrally by the IIT Council, an apex body established by the Government of India. The Minister of Human Resources and Development is the chairman of the council. Each institute has a board of governors responsible for its administration and control. The finance committee advises on matters of financial policy, while the Building and Works Committee advises on buildings and infrastructure.\nThe Senate comprises all professors of the institute and decides its academic policy. It controls and approves the curriculum, courses, examinations, and results. It appoints committees to examine specific academic matters. The director of the institute serves as the chairman of the Senate. The current director (appointed in 2022) is Kamakoti Veezhinathan, who obtained his Ph.D. and M.S in CSE from IIT Madras.\nThree Senate Sub-Committees – The Board of Academic Research, The Board of Academic Courses and The Board of Students – help in academic administration and the operations of the institute.  The Board of Industrial Consultancy and Sponsored Research addresses industrial consultancy, and the Library Advisory Committee oversees library matters.\n\n\nDepartments\nIIT Madras has the following departments\n\nAerospace Engineering\nApplied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering\nBiotechnology(Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences)\nChemical Engineering\nChemistry\nCivil Engineering\nComputer Science and Engineering (CSE)\nData Science and Artificial Intelligence\nElectrical Engineering (EE)\nEngineering Design\nHumanities and Social Sciences (HSS)\nManagement Studies (DoMS)\nMathematics (MA)\nMechanical Engineering (ME)\nMedical Science and Technology (MST)\nMetallurgical and Materials Engineering\nOcean Engineering\nPhysics\n\n\nAcademics\nIIT Madras offers undergraduate, postgraduate and research degrees across 18 disciplines in Engineering, Science, Humanities and Management. About 600 faculty belonging to science and engineering departments and centres of the institute are engaged in teaching, research and industrial consultancy.\nThe institute has 18 academic departments and advanced research centres across disciplines of engineering and pure sciences, with nearly 100 laboratories. The academic calendar is organised around the semester. Each semester provides a minimum of seventy days of instruction in English. Students are evaluated continuously throughout the semester. The faculty does evaluation, a consequence of the autonomous status granted to the institute. Research work is evaluated based on the review thesis by peer examiners, both from within the country and abroad. The Senate, the highest academic body within the institute prepare ordinances that govern the academic programme of study.\nIITM is also gearing up to launch a new and completely online BEd degree programme in Maths and Computing to improve maths teaching in schools, as said by the director at the G20 seminar at IIT Madras.\n\n\nGrading System and Student Evaluation\nThe Indian Institutes of Technology have strict rules for grading. Depending on the course, the evaluation is based on participation in class, attendance, quizzes, exams and/or papers. Course instructors do continuous evaluation. The Evaluation System of IIT Madras which is also used in other IITs is the Cumulative Grade Point Average with a scale from 0 to 10 which is converted to letters:\n\nCGPA then gets calculated as the cumulative credit-weighted average of the grade points:\nCGPA = (Σ Ci • GPi) / (Σ Ci)\nwhere:\nN is the number of courses\nCi is the credits for the ith course\nGPi is the grade points for the ith course\nCGPA is the cumulative grade point average\nThe CGPA is not the same as the one commonly used in the United States.\nIn India, some credits might be awarded during Bachelor studies for Co-curricular and Extra-curricular Activities, while during the Master's Programme, this is not allowed.\nThrough agreements with numerous international organisations, IIT grades are accepted by many international organisations like NTU, NUS and DAAD.\nAdditionally, the attendance of the students is evaluated with VG for very good (always present), G for good (not present every lecture), M for marginal (less than 85%) and P for poor (student was present less than 75% of lectures).\n\n\nAdmission tests\nFor the undergraduate curriculum, admission to the BTech and Dual Degree (BS + MS or BTech + MTech) programme is done through the Joint Entrance Examination – Advanced (JEE-Advanced). IIT Madras was the organising institute of JEE Advanced in 2017 and 2024.\nHowever, admissions to the BS Chemistry and BS Medical Sciences and Engineering (MSE) courses are not done through JEE Advanced but are done from a separate merit list made based on the rank obtained in IAT, upon separate registration on the IITM website.\nAdmissions to the 4-years hybrid BS degree programmes for Data Science and Applications and Electronic Systems are taken through 2 channels: JEE-based entry (students clearing cutoff of JEE(Main) to be eligible to write JEE(Advanced) are eligible for direct entry to this course); Regular Entry through Qualifier Exam which is their entrance test, any student from any background and even professionals can sit in this test.\n\nIn 2025, IIT Madras introduced a new admission process for undergraduate programs, allowing students who have excelled in national and international Olympiads to secure seats without a JEE score. Moreover, they have also introduced a sports quota and fine arts and cultural excellence quota through which a candidate with national level achievements in various sports and cultural fields can apply for admission, after having qualified for JEE advanced.\nFor the postgraduate curriculum, admission to the MTech and MS programmes are through the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE); after 2022, with the discontinuation of 5 year integrated MA program and the same becoming a 2-year PG program, admissions is through GATE for the MA program also. The Joint Admission Test to MSc (JAM) is the entrance exam for the two-year MSc programme, and other post BSc programmes. MBA candidates are accepted through the Common Admission Test (CAT).\n\n\nAcademic research programmes\nThe institute has departments and advanced research centres across the disciplines of engineering and the pure sciences, and nearly 100 laboratories.\nResearch programmes concern work undertaken by faculty members or specific research groups within departments that award an MS or PhD degree. Research is carried out by scholars admitted into these departmental programmes, under the guidance of their faculty.  Each department makes known its areas of interest to the academic community through handbooks, brochures and bulletins. Topics of interest may be theoretical or experimental. IIT Madras has initiated 16 interdisciplinary research projects against identified focus areas.\n\n\nPartnership with other universities\nThe institute maintains academic friendships with educational institutes around the world through faculty exchange programmes. The institute has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with foreign universities, resulting in cooperative projects and assignments. The list of partners includes Auckland University of Technology, Massey University, Durham University, Sydney University, University of Colombo  and other prestigious universities around the world.\n\n\nRankings\nThe Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) was ranked 180th in the QS World University Rankings of 2026.\n\nInternationally, IIT Madras was ranked 227 in the QS World University Rankings of 2024 and 74 in Asia.
