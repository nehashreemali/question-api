They graduated in 1962.\nOn 9 July 2018, Prakash Javadekar, the Union Minister of Human Resources Development, announced that IIT Bombay would be granted the status of Institution of Eminence. The decision came into effect on 11 October 2018.\n\n\nCampus\n\nThe 545-acre IIT Bombay campus is located between Powai lake and Vihar lake, roughly 15 kilometres away from the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.
