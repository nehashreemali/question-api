  "extract": "Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an Indian instant payment system and protocol developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016. The interface facilitates inter-bank peer-to-peer (P2P) and person-to-merchant (P2M) transactions. It is used on mobile devices to instantly transfer funds between two bank accounts using only a unique UPI ID. It runs as an open source application programming interface (API) on top of the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS), and is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Major Indian banks started making their UPI-enabled apps available to customers in August 2016 and the system is today supported by almost all Indian banks.\nAs of 2025, 50% of world's digital transaction volume are conducted by India's UPI platform with over 250 billion annual transactions worth US$3.4 trillion. In 2021, UPI in India had over 500 million active users. In the month of August 2025, 20 billion UPI transactions worth ₹ 25 trillion (about 293 billion USD) were processed by the UPI system, processing an average of nearly 7,500 transactions every second. The widespread adoption and usage of UPI has positioned India as the global leader in instant payments, accounting for nearly half of all global instant payment transactions. UPI is the largest real-time payment system in the world, it handles more than 640 million transactions every day, compared to Visa’s 639 million. Furthermore, the successful execution of an instant payment system at such an enormous scale has made it a soft power tool for India and is often cited as the most transformative and successful financial technology innovations India has developed. UPI accounts for 84% of digital payments in India.\n\n\nHistory\nIn April 2009, the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) was formed to integrate all the payment mechanisms in India and make them uniform for all retail payments. In March 2009, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reported an annual average of just six non-cash transactions per capita, despite over 10 million retailers accepting card-based payments. A parallel challenge was combating black money and corruption, which were primarily facilitated by cash transactions.\nRBI released a vision statement in 2012 for a period of four years that indicated commitment towards building a safe, efficient, accessible, inclusive, interoperable, and authorized payment and settlement system in India. It was also part of the Green Initiative to decrease the usage of paper in the domestic payments market. UPI was officially launched in 2016 for public use.\nUnder RBI guidance, NPCI became the primary body tasked with developing a new payment system which was simple, secure, and interoperable. UPI works on a four-pillar push-pull interoperable model where there will be a remitter/beneficiary front-end PSP (payment service provider) and a remitter/beneficiary back-end bank that settles the monetary transaction for the users. According to the CEO of Netmagic Solutions, UPI became one of the most successful deep-tech financial innovations India has produced.\nIn December 2019, noting the success of UPI, Google suggested that the US Federal Reserve Board should follow UPI as an example in developing FedNow, a real-time payment system for the United States.\nWith the exponential growth of UPI, India became the world's largest real-time payment market with 25.5 billion annual transactions in 2020 as per data from ACI Worldwide and GlobalData. This put the country ahead of China, South Korea, Thailand and the United Kingdom.\nAs per the Economist Intelligence Unit Report 2021, UPI has made India a leader in the global real-time payment market followed by China and South Korea. After the decision of the Ministry of Finance to nullify the merchant discount rate (MDR) in 2019 from UPI, the number of low value transactions skyrocketed, making huge gains on real-time transaction volume data. Countries such as Brazil, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United States, and the European Union are exploring options to implement a UPI-like system in their own domestic markets.\nFrom 1 January 2019, UPI became a popular payment option for initial public offerings (IPOs). The transaction limit was enhanced from ₹100,000 to ₹200,000 in March 2020. From December 2021, RBI again increased the limit to ₹500,000 for Retail Direct Scheme and IPO applications. To make UPI economically feasible for payment companies, RBI is considering a merchant discount rate (MDR) on future UPI transactions. In its first monetary policy for the 2022–23 financial year, RBI proposed a cardless cash withdrawal facility from ATMs using UPI-based QR codes. In partnership with the NSDL Payments Bank and NPCI, ToneTag launched VoiceSE, which will enable 40 crores (400 million) feature phone users to make UPI payments using voice in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, and Bengali languages.\nAccording to Redseer Strategy Consultants, in 2023, UPI usage has expanded outside of metro areas. Currently, around 70% of UPI users are from places other than Tier-1 cities with over 80% of newly registered users originating from Tier-2 cities. On 8 August 2024, RBI suggested raising the UPI tax payment ceiling from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh.\nProfessor Carlos Montes, Lead of the Innovation Hub for Prosperity at the Cambridge Judge Business School, argues that UPI gives other nations a chance to absorb knowledge from India's experience and get inspiration for implementing it in their own nations. The expansion of UPI demonstrates that the government is ensuring that the technology it creates for citizens is easy to use, easily accessible, and constantly improved, which accounts for the high rate of UPI acceptance in India. In 2025, UPI surpassed Visa in digital payments, according to the International Monetary Fund. Over 640 million transactions are handled via UPI per day, compared to 639 million by Visa.\n\n\nUPI 2.0\nOn 16 August 2018, UPI 2.0 was launched, which enabled users to link their overdraft accounts to a UPI handle. Users were also able to pre-authorise transactions by issuing a mandate for a specific merchant. This version also included a feature to view and store an invoice for each transaction. An AutoPay facility for recurring payments was also added. As of August 2021, State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Paytm Payments Bank have been live on UPI AutoPay, each registering 660,000, 204,000, and 186,000 mandates, respectively. From 15 March 2022, the government removed the need for debit cards for UPI registration. NPCI is planning to expand AutoPay to international markets and operationalize real-time payment dispute resolution mechanisms covering 90% of the complaints by September 2022.\nFrom 8 June 2022, RBI allowed linking RuPay credit cards with UPI. Customers can now make credit card payments using UPI, in the absence of a physical card. NPCI developed a real-time feature that will reduce the 24-hour time period taken by banks to unblock funds over time-out or transaction declines to 30 seconds. The service was officially launched on 20 September 2022. On 7 December 2022, RBI announced that UPI will upgrade from single-block-single to single-block-multiple debit for recurring transactions and investments in securities. This feature is expected to help users block funds for specific purposes and release them when needed.\nRBI on 6 April 2023 proposed allowing credit on UPI through pre-approved bank lines which would help customers reduce their dependence on credit cards. On its point-of-sale devices, Razorpay introduced a quick refund feature for UPI in 2024. Compared to the industry average of five to six business days, the reimbursement will be initiated within 2 minutes.\nAfter introducing the first card-less UPI automated teller machine (ATM), Hitachi Payment Services is now working on creating a UPI-based cash recycler machine (CRM). It will operate on the opposite principle to UPI ATMs'. The RBI and the NPCI are collaborating with the company to explore the feasibility of permitting deposits based on UPI. On August 29, 2024, during the Global Fintech Fest, RBI Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar introduced the UPI Interoperable Cash Deposit (UPI-ICD) feature for cash recycler machine.\nIn October 2024,  the transactions using RuPay credit cards via UPI apps have doubled in the first seven months of FY25. It reached ₹63,825.80 crore—up from ₹33,439.24 crore in during the same period last fiscal.\nInternational mobile numbers of ICICI Bank's non-resident Indian clients can be used to make UPI payments in India. In ten nations—the United States, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia—the bank provides this service.\n\n\nUPI 123PAY\nAs part of a financial inclusion initiative, NPCI, with fintech start-up Naffa Innovations and their product ToneTag, started working on developing a voice-based payment service for feature phone users in low connectivity zones over UPI payment ecosystem under Interactive Voice Response (IVR) project in 2021. The system utilised Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signalling technology with two-factor authentication (2FA) flow for peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction. From September 2020 to June 2021, it was under beta testing while awaiting RBI approval for large-scale deployment. The beta testing and pilot experiment were completed by October 2021 and RBI started formulating guidelines for nationwide use.\nRBI governor Shaktikanta Das launched the service UPI 123PAY on 8 March 2022, with an aim to help almost 40 crores (400 million) feature phone users in the country. Until then, UPI payments were only possible through payment applications on smartphones and USSD-based service for feature phones. However, as per Deputy Governor T Rabi Shankar, the latter has been found to be cumbersome due to the unavailability of the services on several mobile networks.\nUPI 123PAY has four options for payment.\n\nApp-based functionality where a mobile phone manufacturer can install a UPI app through over-the-air programming, that can be used for payment.\nMissed calls based: where a customer can use a dedicated merchant payment number by giving a missed call. The incoming authentication call will ask for PIN verification to complete the transaction.\nInteractive Voice Response (IVR) based where the payment transaction will be completed using pre-defined phone numbers.\nPayment in offline mode through sound-based proximity data communication.\nAs per NPCI, some of the early use cases involve FASTag recharges, insurance payments, and EMI collections. As of 20 September 2022, Ultracash Technologies, in collaboration with Bharat Petroleum, helped 200,000 active users make LPG booking and payment through UPI 123PAY. As of October 9, 2024, the RBI increased the transaction limit from ₹5,000 to ₹10,000. Banks and service providers have until January 1, 2025, to make the required adjustments.\n\n\nUPI 3.0\nNPCI started introducing new features under UPI 3.0 from 2024.\n\n\nConversational Voice Payments\nAt the Global Fintech Fest 2024, NPCI, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), and CoRover unveiled \"Conversational Voice Payments\" for UPI, a huge advancement in the convenience of online transactions. Customers may now use their voice or type their UPI ID or mobile number to complete transactions thanks to this new functionality that is enabled by BharatGPT and linked with payment gateways. The system immediately obtains the associated UPI ID and starts the payment request through the user's default UPI app when a mobile number is entered. Users can update their UPI ID or mobile number within the transaction time restriction thanks to this functionality, which enables flexibility. The goal of this innovative technology, which is the first of its type for UPI payments, is to reduce linguistic barriers and increase the accessibility and human-centeredness of transactions. With support for Hindi, Gujarati, and other languages, CoRover's voice-enabled BharatGPT improves the multilingual system and guarantees inclusion in the payment process. Users of AskDISHA, the AI virtual assistant for Indian Railways and IRCTC, can now buy tickets and make payments with just their voice thanks to the integration of Conversational Voice Payments.\n\n\nCredit lines\nThe RuPay credit card on UPI facility is responsible for credit transactions of ₹10,000 crore per month. Approximately 100 to 200 crores of the ₹10,000 crore in credit card spending through UPI have been made through credit lines, according to NPCI MD and CEO Dilip Asbe. The pre-approved, small-ticket, short-term loans on UPI are called credit lines. On July 19, 2024, The New Indian Express published an article stating that Punjab National Bank, Axis Bank, State Bank of India, and ICICI Bank had already started using the UPI credit line product on a trial basis. When it comes to granting pre-approved loans through credit lines on UPI, ICICI Bank is the industry leader.\nOn August 23, 2024, PhonePe introduced the \"Credit Line on UPI\" service. It makes low-cost, high-volume retail loans available.\n\n\nUPI Vouchers\nGoogle Pay revealed at the Global Fintech Fest 2024 that it will be launching UPI Vouchers, a capability that was first made available for COVID-19 vaccine payments. This feature will be released in the second half of 2024. With UPI Vouchers, users can transfer prepaid vouchers that are connected to the smartphone number of the recipient. The recipient of these vouchers does not need to connect their bank account to UPI in order to use them for payments. It is now possible for businesses and individuals to issue and use UPI vouchers more easily thanks to the adaptation of this feature for a wider range of industries. In addition to making financial transactions for users easier, UPI Vouchers offer a smooth digital payment option for a variety of scenarios, including corporate gifts, government programs, and others.\n\n\nUPI Circle\nIn its monetary policy announcement in August 2024, the RBI implemented the delegated payments feature through UPI. By doing this, a person (the primary user) could grant permission to another person (the secondary user) to utilize their bank account to perform UPI transactions. The primary user would choose the transaction limit.\nThe UPI Circle feature was launched on 19 August 2024. Two kinds of delegation are possible with UPI Circle. Full delegation, in which the primary user gives the secondary user the authority to start and finish transactions up to specified expenditure limitations without needing additional permission. Additionally, there is partial delegation, in which the primary user must authenticate and complete the payment using their UPI PIN before the secondary user may start a transaction. With UPI Circle, one can use platforms for collaboration or gig economies to create micro-communities where people can pool resources or settle payments in real time. On August 22, 2024, PhonePe released the feature on its platform. At the Global Fintech Fest 2024, Google Pay announced that it will be introducing the UPI Circle feature. The second half of 2024 will see the release of this feature.\nNPCI guidelines for UPI ecosystem members,\n\nFor Primary and Secondary users, separate user journeys are provided by payment service providers and UPI apps. Users are allowed to select the UPI app of their choosing. App passcodes and biometrics (facial or fingerprint) must be required for all secondary users.\nThe primary user must first select a contact number from the contact list and then scan the QR code or input their UPI ID in order to link. Eventually, primary users will be able to connect with secondary users by choosing a contact number from the contact list alone, rather than scanning a QR code.\nUp to five secondary users may be delegated by a primary user, and only one primary user may accept delegation from a secondary user. Members must make sure that, in cases of full or partial delegation, the primary user grants permission to the secondary user.\nMembers are responsible for making sure the principal user has restricted access to set use limits for their secondary users. Members must guarantee a maximum monthly limit of approximately 15,000 per delegate and a maximum per transaction limit of approximately 5,000 for full delegation.\nThe current UPI restrictions will apply in the event of partial delegation. Members are responsible for making sure that, following the successful connection of primary and secondary users for both full and partial delegation, a daily transaction limit of about 5,000 is set for the first 24 hours of the cooling period.\nMembers are required to make certain that transactions made by secondary users are visible to the primary user on their bank account statement and UPI app.\nMembers must abide by RBI regulations regarding \"Harmonization of Turn Around Time\" and compensating customers for unsuccessful transactions through authorized payment methods. UPI transactions must provide online dispute resolution capabilities.\n\n\nAgentic Payment\nIn order to provide Agentic Payments on ChatGPT and investigate AI-driven commerce on a national level, Razorpay, NPCI, and OpenAI are conducting a pilot project as of October 2025. It will make digital payments intelligent, conversational, and easy. Before completing a transaction, customers will set aside money for particular merchants in order to secure their payment passwords. It guarantees that payments only proceed after a user confirms. With options for instantaneous payment cancelation and real-time tracking, users maintain control.\nThe effort, which is based on UPI Circle and UPI Reserve Pay, aims to provide smooth UPI transactions for AI-native shopping. Razorpay, NPCI, and OpenAI will investigate AI-based payment use cases as part of this project, including safe and customized AI commerce through conversational checkout and shopping experiences. Axis Bank and Airtel Payments Bank are banking partners. Bigbasket is the first retailer to be able to test this service.\n\n\nTechnical controls and operational limits (2025)\nOn 1 August 2025, the NPCI implemented new technical and operational restrictions across UPI applications to enhance system stability and reduce the risk of fraud. The changes include daily limits on balance enquiry and “list accounts” API calls, a regulated processing window for autopay mandate scheduling, and caps.\n\n\nService\nFor real-time payments from one bank account to another, any UPI client app can be used and multiple bank accounts can be linked to a single app. Money can be sent or requested using a user-created Virtual Payment Address (VPA) or UPI ID for each bank account using the KYC-linked mobile number. UPI also generates a specific QR code for each user account for contactless payments. The RBI increased the UPI payment limit for payments in hospitals and educational institutions from ₹100,000 to ₹500,000 on 8 December 2023. Multi-factor authentication for UPI e-mandates will now be activated over ₹100,000, as opposed to ₹15,000, for credit card repayments, mutual fund subscriptions, and insurance premium payments.\n\n\nMobile apps\nAny UPI app can be used to transfer funds from and to UPI enabled banks. Apart from various third-party apps such as Google Pay (previously Tez), PhonePe, Paytm, Amazon Pay, Airtel Payments Bank, MobiKwik,  Samsung Pay, WhatsApp Pay, NPCI manages its own app, BHIM.\nThe total number of banks linked to UPI platform grew from 21 in April 2016 to 304 in February 2022.\nIn June 2021, NPCI removed the restriction placed on WhatsApp for UPI customer onboarding which until then was limited to 2 crore (20 million) users. With 53 crores (530 million) registered users in the Indian market, WhatsApp could then roll out UPI to all its customers. In place of the present four- or six-digit UPI PIN, NPCI proposed forming collaborations with startups to implement biometric identification for UPI transactions utilizing fingerprints on Android smartphones and face ID on iPhones.\n\n\nForeign tourists\nThere are multiple apps that allow foreign tourists to make UPI payment such as UPI One World, Mony among others.\n\n\nOn-Device wallet\nNPCI called this feature UPI Lite. It can scan a QR code without the need of an internet connection. In phase 1, UPI Lite will process the debit transaction offline while the credit will happen when the device goes online. But the final goal is to achieve both credit and debit transaction through offline mode. The upper limit of UPI Lite On-Device wallet is ₹2,000. Additional factor authentication or UPI AutoPay feature will  be used to securely load the desirable amount. Since 50% of UPI transactions are below ₹200 with a higher frequency rate, the per transaction limit will be maximum ₹200, as it creates a large backlog of volume which increases the failure rate and affects the stability of the entire payment network. To save electricity consumption and computing power of banks, UPI mobile apps will have to support on-device wallet features as per the RBI directive from December 2021. The in-built wallet will help in low-value instant payment by using the infrastructure of the mobile app developer, thus decreasing the load on banks through decentralization of back-end infrastructure and resources.\nOn 20 September, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das officially launched UPI Lite at Global Fintech Fest 2022. Canara Bank, HDFC Bank, Indian Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Union Bank of India and Utkarsh Small Finance Bank enabled UPI Lite feature on BHIM. Paytm Payments Bank on 15 February 2023 went live with UPI Lite feature.\nBeginning November 1, 2024, the UPI Lite auto top-up feature will allow the balance to be automatically replenished when it drops below a certain threshold. The user is responsible for setting the minimum balance and reload amount, which cannot be greater than the ₹2,000 wallet limit. The UPI Lite account can be topped-up up to five times in a single day. Users using UPI Lite are currently able to transact up to ₹500 each. Furthermore, ₹2,000 is the maximum amount that can be stored in a UPI Lite wallet. For users of UPI Lite wallets, the cumulative maximum daily expenditure limit has been set at ₹4,000. It has been suggested by the RBI that the UPI Lite maximum transaction limit be raised from ₹500 to ₹1,000. The UPI Lite wallet limit has also been raised from ₹2,000 to ₹5,000.\n\n\nSupported banks\nThe NPCI website lists the banks that facilitate UPI, termed as Payment Service Providers (PSP) – listed with their UPI application and handle – and issuers. PSP includes banks which have their own mobile application to facilitate transaction and issuers include banks which do not have their own payments interface and rely on third-party software for transactions. On 1 August 2024, RBL Bank announced integration of UPI and National Common Mobility Card capabilities with RuPay credit cards.\n\n\ne-RUPI\n\ne-RUPI or e₹UPI (portmanteau of electronic Rupee and UPI) developed in collaboration with Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and National Health Authority. It was introduced from 2 August 2021. e-RUPI is to ensure leak proof delivery of welfare services and bypassing middle man to decrease corruption. Private sector can use the service for their own corporate social responsibility initiative (CSR). e-RUPI is basically e-voucher based on QR code or SMS string that can be delivered through mobile phone. e-RUPI will act as a precursor for future Central bank digital currency (CBDC) that will be launched by RBI as it will help in highlighting the gaps within the national digital payment infrastructure.\nFinancial Software and Systems (FSS) integrated e-RUPI on 1 December 2021 for financially underserved segments of the society. Government of Karnataka partnered with NPCI to provide student scholarship through e-RUPI which can even be received on feature phones.\n\n\nDigital Rupee\n\nAs part of the Central Bank Digital Currency pilot project, Canara Bank has released the Unified Payments Interface compatible digital rupee mobile app. Without the need for a separate on-boarding procedure for CBDC for retailers, it will enable users to scan the existing UPI QR code and make payments using digital rupee. Customers in 26 Indian cities who have been whitelisted can access the service as part of a pilot program.\n\n\nMarket share\nFrom 93,000 transactions in August 2016 valued at ₹ 3 crore (30 million), UPI generated 80 crore (800 million) transactions in March 2019 with a total value of ₹ 1.3 lakh crore (1330 billion). In June 2021, UPI recorded 9.4 crore (94 million) IPO mandates that increased to 76.6 lakhs (7.66 million) in July. This was the highest ever since UPI was made mandatory by Securities and Exchange Board of India for domestic retail investors for IPO process. By late August 2020, with 18 billion annual transactions, UPI surpassed American Express in India. NITI Aayog predicted that UPI will also surpass Visa and Mastercard by 2023. UPI took three years to reach 1.14 billion in October 2019 while by the end of October 2020, the payment system registered 2.07 billion transactions. In 2020, $457 billion worth of value was moved on UPI platform which was 15% of India's GDP.\nAs of July 2021, UPI registered 432.5 million transactions that accounted for ₹567,345 million with highest average daily transaction of approximately 100 million that is double the amount from July 2020. As of August 2021, UPI forms 10% of all retail payment in India. PhonePe and Google Pay both recorded 1 billion transactions in August with a market share of 45.94% and 34.45% respectively in the UPI payment ecosystem while Paytm took 11.94% share with ₹387.85 million transaction.\nFrom the financial year 2015–21, the domestic retail payment by value on UPI grew at 18% at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) while between 2017 and 2021, the collective payment on all forms of UPI grew at 400% CAGR. In the financial year 2021, ₹41 trillion (short scale) worth of money was exchanged on the UPI platform that is 2.8 times the value of debit and credit card payment at point of sale (POS) terminals and 20 times the value of digital wallet and prepaid instruments in India.\nUPI registered 3.55 billion transactions in August 2021, a growth of 9.56% from the previous month. In terms of value, ₹6.39 trillion worth of money was transacted in August alone. From ₹3.2 trillion to ₹6 trillion, the growth in value terms doubled between September 2020 to July 2021. It had reached an all-time high of 3.65 billion transactions worth ₹6.54 trillion in value since inception in the month of September. By now the total transaction for the year 2021, reached ₹50 trillion.\nUPI touched value of ₹7.71 trillion in October 2021 which is a 56% jump from September. As per NPCI, daily UPI payment for the month of October is between ₹250 billion to ₹300 billion. Out of all UPI transactions done in the month of October, 54% are Person-to-Person (P2P) while 46% were Person-to-Merchant (P2M). UPI reached $844 billion in value until November 2021. In December, the total transaction value on UPI reached ₹8.27 trillion with 99% annual growth rate. The largest share in $2 trillion of annual digital payment in India comes from UPI. The Q2 of 2022 saw 20.57 billion transactions worth ₹36.08 trillion as per Worldline SA.P2P accounted for 49% in volume and 67% in value while P2M accounted for 34% in volume and 17% in value. As per CEO Dilip Asbe of NPCI, P2M as of November 2022 accounts for more than 50% of UPI transaction volumes. In 2019, UPI accounted for 17% of the ₹31 billion of digital transactions, and in 2022, accounted for 52% of the ₹88.4 billion of digital transactions.\nAs per Minister of State for Finance Bhagwat Karad, in terms of volume, UPI increased at a CAGR of 147% from 92 crore in FY 2017–18 to 8,375 crore in FY 2022–2023. At a CAGR of 168%, the value of UPI transactions increased from ₹1 lakh crore in FY 2017–18 to ₹139 lakh crore in FY 2022–23. With UPI representing 62% of digital payment transactions in FY 2022–2023, it has been the primary driver of the overall development of digital payment transactions in India.\nIn January 2024, the value of UPI transactions reached ₹18.41 trillion, a slight increase of 1% from ₹18.23 trillion in December 2023. From 12.02 billion in October 2023 to 12.20 billion in January 2024, there was a 1.5% increase in transactions. With 11.4 billion transactions, the value was recorded at ₹17.4 trillion in November 2023. In comparison to the same month in the previous fiscal year, January 2024 numbers were 52% higher in volume and 42% higher in value, according to NPCI data. According to RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, in 2023 UPI would account for close to 80% of digital payments. Nearly 8 out of 10 digital payments are now done through UPI. \n\nsource – NPCI portal\n~this data excludes the transactions having debit/credit to the same account for the month of August 2018 onwards\n\n\nApp market share\n\n\nMarket cap\nOn 26 March 2021, NPCI defined standard operating procedure for third-party payment providers on 30% market cap. The limit will be calculated on the basis of total volume of transactions processed over UPI during the preceding three months on a rolling basis starting from 1 January 2021. Compliance deadline is until December 2023. NPCI will push first alert through an email or a letter to third-party payment providers and their partner banks when UPI transactions hits 25–27% threshold which payment providers must acknowledge. In return, payment providers will send second alert to NPCI with evidence on the steps taken for compliance. In case 30% mark is breached, payment providers and banks must stop new user on-boarding. In special cases, payment providers and banks may get an exemption of 6 months for compliance. The report of breaching 30% market cap must reach NPCI within first five working days with plan for corrective measures. During the same period, payment providers and banks must inform new customers about the issue. Non compliance of market cap bring penalties under UPI procedural guidelines. NPCI will check operating procedures of UPI every 6 months to meet objectives without creating inconvenience for end users.\nPhonePe made a formal request to NPCI to defer the 30% market cap deadline from January 2023 to January 2026. NPCI is currently discussing this issue with RBI and Government. Industry stakeholders want to do away with 30% market cap proposed by NPCI, instead want organic growth based on customer demand. Implementation is a contentious issue as it results in blocking existing users from performing payment to maintain the 30% market cap. RBI has also started looking for solutions to fix the duopoly situation created by Google Pay and PhonePe. Both players will get two additional years till 31 December 2024 to fix their market cap.\n\n\nInternationalization\nAround 777 million Indian consumers shopped across the border in 2021. To make ease of payment, NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) with UK-based PPRO Financial on 17 November 2021 to expand the acceptance of UPI into foreign markets, especially those in China and the United States which account for half of all international transaction coming from India. On 26 January 2022, UK based fintech startup Transact365 enabled UPI for global merchants with real time currency conversion facility that will help them do business in India independent of local presence. As per NPCI and RBI mandate, banks, payment service providers (PSPs) and third-party application providers (TPAPs) in India must enable international acceptance through UPI from 30 September 2022.\nWith the release of the Payments Vision 2025 document on 17 June 2022, RBI will push for internationalization of UPI with nations using United States dollar, Pound sterling and Euro under bilateral treaties. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) also actively pushing for internationalization of UPI due to geopolitical concerns. But several countries including Canada are reluctant to accept UPI due to pushback from American firms. MEA is looking for Central Bank to Central Bank transfer using UPI as the pipeline and a collaborative effort if the countries have a similar system like UPI. On 12 October 2022, India offered UPI and related technologies to Commonwealth of Nations.\nOn 7 February 2023, PhonePe announced extending support of UPI for international payments in UAE, Singapore, Mauritius, Nepal, and Bhutan. Users will be able to pay in international currency directly from Indian bank accounts. NIPL signed a definitive agreement with PPRO Financial on 27 April 2023 that will enable acceptance of UPI among international payment service providers (PSPs) and global merchant acquirers.\nOn 18 July 2023, Universal Postal Union Director General Masahiko Metoki met with Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw from the Ministry of Communications. He consented to assess the integration of UPI for international money transfers via postal routes. NPCI and RBI started active discussions with SWIFT for allowing international dollar transactions on UPI.

As more users adopt this convenient payment system, scammers have increasingly exploited vulnerabilities in digital transactions. One reason why scammers adopt this method is, it is almost impossible to reverse the transaction. As per RBI's annual report in 2023-24, 29,082 digital frauds (card/internet) were reported amounting to ₹1,457 crore (US$170 million).\nThe Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, Indian School of Business, Fuqua School of Business (Duke University), and the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL) conducted a joint study titled Open Banking and Digital Payments: Implications for Credit Access. They found that UPI has made it possible for underserved borrowers to obtain formal credit for the first time. In areas where UPI adoption is high, loans to new credit borrowers have increased by 4%, while loans to subprime borrowers have increased by 8%. As an example of how digital financial records helped lenders better evaluate applicants, the authors pointed out that a 10% increase in UPI transactions resulted in a 7% increase in credit availability. UPI-enabled digital transaction data helped lenders grow responsibly, as evidenced by the fact that default rates did not increase despite the lending boom.\n\n\nOutage and downtime\nOn 12 April 2025, UPI had its largest outage in more than three years, which lasted over five hours. The NPCI stated that the lack of a transaction status check limitation in the system architecture was the cause of the outage. The 'Check transaction' API flooding was found to be the root of the problem. Additionally, it was noted that several banks that provided payment services were repeatedly requesting \"Check transactions,\" even for previous transactions. According to the NPCI's operating guidelines, banks are specifically only permitted to check the progress of a transaction three times, with a 90-second gap between requests. At its firewall, NPCI did not implement a rate restriction to prevent API calls that exceeded three requests. However, rather than using NPCI's infrastructure, the banks themselves were supposed to enforce this restriction. On 12 April 2025, NPCI noticed a decline in UPI success rates. Between 11.40 a.m. and 4.40 p.m., the success rate dropped to approximately 50% for the next two hours and then to about 80% for the next three. The success rate stabilized at 4:40 p.m. on 12 April 2025.\nA nationwide UPI outage that disrupted transactions occurred on August 7, 2025. Users of Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm were unable to make purchases, at approximately 7:45 p.m. Transactions at HDFC Bank, State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, and Kotak Mahindra Bank, were interrupted by the malfunction. According to Downdetector, 8% of customers reported app-related issues, 29% encountered issues with money transfers, and 62% had trouble processing payments. A small number of banks were experiencing internal technical issues, according to NPCI. The UPI service was operational again.\n\n\nMisuse\nThe Bangalore Mirror reported on 7 August 2025, that inmates at Bangalore Central Prison are allegedly utilizing UPI apps like PhonePe and Google Pay to extort money from people outside the jail. According to reports, the prisoners are threatening ex-offenders who are free on bail via WhatsApp calls, threatening to harm them if they do not pay funds to designated UPI IDs. After associates outside take these transactions out, the money is returned to the prison. To determine the total amount extorted, investigators have tracked down 14 UPI IDs that were reportedly used by prisoners and have asked banks for transaction records.\n\n\nSee also\n\nInteroperable Instant Payment System\nUnified Lending Interface\nAadhaar\nBHIM\nPix\nIndia Stack\nPayment gateway\nMerchant account\nImmediate Payment Service\nNational Payments Corporation of India\nOpen Network for Digital Commerce\nBuy Now Pay Later\nZelle\nQRIS, the Indonesian equivalent\n\n\nReferences",
