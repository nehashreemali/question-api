  "extract": "The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) is India's premier nuclear research facility, headquartered in Trombay, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. It was founded by Homi Jehangir Bhabha as the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET) in January 1954 as a multidisciplinary research program essential for India's nuclear program.\nIt operates under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), which is directly overseen by the Prime Minister of India.\nBARC is a multi-disciplinary research centre with extensive infrastructure for advanced research and development covering the entire spectrum of nuclear science, chemical engineering, material sciences and metallurgy, electronic instrumentation, biology and medicine, supercomputing, high-energy physics and plasma physics and associated research for Indian nuclear programme and related areas.\nBARC's core mandate is to sustain peaceful applications of nuclear energy. It manages all facets of nuclear power generation, from the theoretical design of reactors to, computer modeling and simulation, risk analysis, development and testing of new reactor fuel, materials, etc. It also researches spent fuel processing and safe disposal of nuclear waste. Its other research focus areas are applications for isotopes in industries, radiation technologies and their application to health, food and medicine, agriculture and environment, accelerator and laser technology, electronics, instrumentation and reactor control and material science, environment and radiation monitoring etc. BARC operates a number of research reactors across the country.\nIts primary facilities are located in Trombay, with new facilities also located in Challakere in Chitradurga district of Karnataka. A new Special Mineral Enrichment Facility which focuses on enrichment of uranium fuel is under construction in Atchutapuram near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, for supporting India's nuclear submarine program and produce high specific activity radioisotopes for extensive research.\n\n\nHistory\n\nWhen Homi Jehangir Bhabha was working at the Indian Institute of Science, there was no institute in India which had the necessary facilities for original work in nuclear physics, cosmic rays, high energy physics, and other frontiers of knowledge in physics. This prompted him to send a proposal in March 1944 to the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust for establishing \"a vigorous school of research in fundamental physics\".\n\nWhen Bhabha realised that technology development for the atomic energy programme could no longer be carried out within TIFR he proposed to the government to build a new laboratory entirely devoted to this purpose. For this purpose, 1200 acres of land was acquired at Trombay from the Bombay Government. Thus the Atomic Energy Establishment Trombay (AEET) started functioning in 1954. The same year the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) was also established.\nBhabha established the BARC Training School to cater to the manpower needs of the expanding atomic energy research and development program. Bhabha emphasized self-reliance in all fields of nuclear science and engineering.\nThe Government of India created the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET) with Bhabha as the founding director on 3 January 1954. It was established to consolidate all the research and development activities for nuclear reactors and technology under the Atomic Energy Commission. All scientists and engineers engaged in the fields of reactor designing and development, instrumentation, metallurgy, and material science, etc., were transferred with their respective programs from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) to AEET, with TIFR retaining its original focus for fundamental research in the sciences. After Bhabha's death in 1966, the centre was renamed as the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre on 22 January 1967.\nThe first reactors at BARC and its affiliated power generation centres were imported from the west. India's first power reactors, installed at the Tarapur Atomic Power Station were from the United States.\nThe primary importance of BARC is as a research centre. The BARC and the Indian government has consistently maintained that the reactors are used for this purpose only: Apsara (1956; named by the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru when he likened the blue Cerenkov radiation to the beauty of the Apsaras), CIRUS (1960; the \"Canada-India Reactor\" with assistance from the US), the now-defunct ZERLINA (1961; Zero Energy Reactor for Lattice Investigations and Neutron Assay), Purnima I (1972), Purnima II (1984), Dhruva (1985), Purnima III (1990), and KAMINI.\nApsara was India's first nuclear reactor built at BARC in 1956 to conduct basic research in nuclear physics. It is 1 MWTh light water cooled and moderated swimming pool type thermal reactor that went critical on August 4, 1956, and is suitable for production of isotopes, basic nuclear research, shielding experiments, neutron activation analysis, neutron radiography and testing of neutron detectors. It was shut down permanently in 2010 and replaced with Apsara-U. Purnima-I is a plutonium oxide fuelled 1 MWTh pulsed-fast reactor that was built starting in 1970 and went critical on 18 May 1972 to primarily support the validation of design parameters for development of plutonium-239 powered nuclear weapons.\nOn the twentieth anniversary of the 1974 Pokhran nuclear test, Purnima's designer, P. K. Iyengar, reflected on the reactor's critical role: \"Purnima was a novel device, built with about 20 kg of plutonium, a variable geometry of reflectors, and a unique control system. This gave considerable experience and helped to benchmark calculations regarding the behaviour of a chain-reacting system made out of plutonium. The kinetic behaviour of the system just above critical could be well studied. Very clever physicists could then calculate the time behaviour of the core of a bomb on isotropic compression. What the critical parameters would be, how to achieve optimum explosive power, and its dependence on the first self sustaining neutron trigger, were all investigated\". It was decommissioned in 1973.\n\nAlong with DRDO and other agencies and laboratories BARC also played an essential and important role in nuclear weapons technology and research. The plutonium used in India's 1974 Smiling Buddha nuclear test came from CIRUS. In 1974 the head of this entire nuclear bomb project was the director of the BARC, Raja Ramanna. The neutron initiator was of the polonium–beryllium type and code-named Flower was developed by BARC. The entire nuclear bomb was engineered and finally assembled by Indian engineers at Trombay before transportation to the test site. The 1974 test (and the 1998 tests that followed) gave Indian scientists the technological know-how and confidence not only to develop nuclear fuel for future reactors to be used in power generation and research but also the capacity to refine the same fuel into weapons-grade fuel to be used in the development of nuclear weapons.\nBARC was also involved in the Pokhran-II series of five nuclear test conducted at Pokhran Test Range in May 1998. It was the second instance of nuclear testing conducted after Smiling Buddha by India. The tests achieved their main objective of giving India the capability to build fission and thermonuclear weapons(Hydrogen bomb/fusion bomb) with yields up to 200 Kilotons. The then Chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission described each one of the explosions of Pokhran-II to be \"equivalent to several tests carried out by other nuclear weapon states over decades\". Subsequently, India established computer simulation capability to predict the yields of nuclear explosives whose designs are related to the designs of explosives used in this test. The scientists and engineers of the BARC, the Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMDER), and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) were involved in the nuclear weapon assembly, layout, detonation and data collection.\nOn 3 June 1998 BARC was hacked by hacktivist group milw0rm, consisting of hackers from the United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand. They downloaded classified information, defaced the website and deleted data from servers.\nBARC also designed a class of Indian Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor IPHWR (Indian Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor), the baseline 220 MWe design was developed from the Canadian CANDU reactor. The design was later expanded into 540 MW and 700 MW designs.\nThe IPHWR-220 (Indian Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor-220) was the first in class series of Indian pressurized heavy-water reactor designed by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. It is a Generation II reactor developed from earlier CANDU based RAPS-1 and RAPS-2 reactors built at Rawatbhata, Rajasthan. Currently there are 14 units operational at various locations in India. Upon completion of the design of IPHWR-220, a larger 540 MWe design was started around 1984 under the aegis of BARC in partnership with NPCIL. Two reactors of this design were built in Tarapur, Maharashtra starting in the year 2000 and the first was commissioned on 12 September 2005. The IPHWR-540 design was later upgraded to a 700 MWe with the main objective to improve fuel efficiency and develop a standardized design to be installed at many locations across India as a fleet-mode effort. The design was also upgraded to incorporate Generation III+ features. Almost 100% of the parts of these indigenously designed reactors are manufactured by Indian industry.\nBARC designed and built India's first pressurised water reactor at Kalpakkam, a 80MW land based prototype of INS Arihant's nuclear power unit, as well as the Arihant's main propulsion reactor. Three other submarine vessels of the class(Arihant class) including the upcoming INS arighat, S4 and S4* will also get the same class of reactors as there primary propulsion.\nBARC also developed stabilization systems for Seekers, Antenna Units for India's multirole fighter HAL Tejas and contributed to Chandrayaan-I and Mangalyaan missions. BARC has contributed for collaboration with various mega science projects of National and International repute viz. CERN (LHC), India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO), ITER, Low Energy High Intensity Proton Accelerator (LEHIPA), Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), Major Atmospheric Cerenkov Experiment Telescope (MACE), etc.\nIn 2012 it was reported that new facilities and campuses of BARC were planned in Atchutapuram, near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, and in Challakere in Chitradurga district in Karnataka. BARC would be setting 30 MW special research reactor using an enriched uranium fuel at Visakhapatnam to meet the demand for high specific activity radio isotopes and carry out extensive research and development in nuclear sector. The site would also support the nuclear submarine program.\n\n\nDescription\nBARC is a multi-disciplinary research centre with extensive infrastructure for advanced research and development covering the entire spectrum of nuclear science, chemical engineering, material sciences and metallurgy, electronic instrumentation, biology and medicine, supercomputing, high-energy physics and plasma physics and associated research for Indian nuclear programme and related areas.\nBARC is a premier nuclear and multi-disciplinary research organisation though founded primarily to serve India's nuclear program and its peaceful applications of nuclear energy does an extensive and advanced research and development covering the entire spectrum of nuclear science, chemical engineering, radiology and their application to health, food, medicine, agriculture and environment, accelerator and laser technology, electronics, high performance computing, instrumentation and reactor control, materials science and radiation monitoring, high-energy physics and plasma physics among others.\n\n\nOrganisation and governance\nBARC is an agency of the Department of Atomic Energy. It is divided into a number of Groups, each under a director, and many more Divisions.\n\n\nNuclear Recycle Board\nBARC's Nuclear Recycle Board (NRB) was formed in 2009. It is located in three cities – Mumbai, Tarapur, and Kalpakkam.\n\n\nAreas of research\nBARC conducts extensive and advanced research and development covering the entire spectrum of nuclear science, chemical engineering, material sciences and metallurgy, electronics instrumentation, biology and medicine, advance computing, high-energy plasma physics and associated research for Indian nuclear program and related areas. The few are:\n\n\nThorium fuel cycle\nIndia has a unique position in the world, in terms of availability of nuclear fuel resource. It has a limited resource of uranium but a large resource of thorium. The beach sands of Kerala and Orissa have rich reserves of monazite, which contains about 8–10% thorium.\nStudies have been carried out on all aspects of thorium fuel cycle - mining and extraction, fuel fabrication, utilisation in different reactor systems, evaluation of its various properties and irradiation behaviour, reprocessing and recycling. Some of the important milestones achieved / technological progress made in these are as follows:\nThe process of producing thoria from monazite is well established. IREL has produced several tonnes of nuclear grade thoria powder\nThe fabrication of thoria based fuel by powder-pellet method is well established. Few tonnes of thoria fuel have been fabricated at BARC and NFC for various irradiations in research and power reactors.\nStudies have been carried out regarding use of thorium in different types of reactors with respect to fuel management, reactor control and fuel utilisation.\nA Critical Facility has been constructed and is being used for carrying out experiments with thoria based fuels.\nThoria based fuel irradiations have been carried out in our research and power reactors.\nThoria fuel rods in the reflector region of research reactor CIRUS.\nThoria fuel assemblies as reactivity load in research reactor Dhruva.\nThoria fuel bundles for flux flattening in the Initial Core of PHWRs.\nThoria blanket assemblies in FBTR.\n(Th-Pu)MOX fuel pins of BWR, PHWR and AHWR design in research reactors CIRUS and Dhruva.\nPost-irradiation examinations have been carried out on the irradiated PHWR thoria fuel bundles and (Th-Pu) MOX fuel pins.\nThermo-physical and thermodynamic properties have been evaluated for the thoria based fuels.\nThoria fuel rods irradiated in CIRUS have been reprocessed at Uranium Thorium Separation Facility (UTSF) BARC. The recovered 233U has been fabricated as fuel for KAMINI reactor.\nThoria blanket assemblies irradiated in FBTR have been reprocessed at IGCAR. The recovered 233U has been used for experimental irradiation of PFBR type fuel assembly in FBTR.\nThoria fuel bundles irradiated in PHWRs will be reprocessed in Power Reactor Thorium Reprocessing Facility (PRTRF). The recovered 233U will be used for reactor physics experiments in AHWR-Critical Facility.\nAdvanced reactors AHWR and AHWR300-LEU have been designed at BARC to provide impetus to the large-scale utilisation of thorium.\n\n\nReprocessing and nuclear waste management\nAfter certain energy utilization, known as burn-up (a legacy of thermal power) is reached, nuclear fuel in a reactor is replaced by fresh fuel so that fission chain reactions can sustain and desired power output can be maintained. The spent fuel discharged from the reactor is known as spent nuclear fuel (SNF). BARC has come a long way since it first began reprocessing of spent fuel in the year 1964 at Trombay. India has more than five decades of experience for reprocessing of spent fuel of Uranium based first stage reactor resulting in development of well matured and highly evolved PUREX based reprocessing flow sheet involving recovery of SNM.\nImplementation of thorium fuel cycle requires extraction of 233U from irradiated thorium fuel and its re-insertion into the fuel cycle. Based on indigenous efforts, a flow sheet for reprocessing of spent thoria rods was developed and demonstrated at Uranium Thorium Separation Facility (UTSF), Trombay. After gaining successful experience at UTSF, Power Reactor Thoria Reprocessing Facility (PRTRF) has been set up employing advanced laser based technology for dismantling of thoria bundle and single pin mechanical chopper for cutting of fuel pins. Thoria irradiated fuel bundles from PHWR were reprocessed using TBP as extractant to recover 233U.\nHigh Level Liquid Waste (HLLW) generated during reprocessing of spent fuel contains most of the radioactivity generated in entire nuclear fuel cycle. The HLLW is immobilised into an inert Sodium Boro-Silicate glass matrix through a process, called vitrification. The vitrified waste is stored for an interim period in an air cooled vault to facilitate the dissipation of heat generated during radioactive decay. Prior to its eventual disposal in geological disposal facility. Vitrification of HLLW is a complex process and poses challenges in view of high temperature operations in presence of high amount of radioactivity. As a result, very few countries in world could master the technology of vitrification of HLLW and India is among them. Three melter technologies, Induction Heated Metallic Melter (IHMM), Joule Heated Ceramic Melter (JHCM) and Cold Crucible Induction Melter (CCIM), have been indigenously developed for vitrification of HLLW. HLLW vitrification plants, based on IHMM or JHCM technologies, have been constructed and successfully operated at Trombay, Tarapur and Kalpakkam sites of India.\nVitrification Cell (IHMM), WIP, Trombay Joule Heated Ceramic Melter, Tarapur Inside view of Cold Crucible Induction Melter R&D in the field of partitioning of Minor Actinides from HLLW are also aimed to separate out the long-lived radioactive waste constituents prior to immobilizing then in glass matrice. The long lived radio-contaminants is planned to be burnt in Fast reactor or Accelerator Driven Sub Critical systems to get converted into short- lived species. This will reduce the need of long term isolation of radionuclide from environment by multifold. R&D is also directed towards management of Hulls, contaminated left over pieces of zirconium clad tube after dissolution of fuel, and Geological Disposal Facility for safe disposal of vitrified HLLW and long lived waste with objective to long term isolation of radionuclide from the human environment.\n\n\nAdvanced Fuel Fabrication Facility\nThe Advanced Fuel Fabrication Facility (AFFF), a MOX fuel fabrication facility, is part of the Nuclear Recycle Board (NRB), and located at the Tarapur, Maharashtra. Advanced Fuel Fabrication Facility has fabricated MOX fuels on experimental basis for BWR, PHWR, FBTR and research reactors. It makes plutonium-based MOX fuel for the stage 2 of Indian Nuclear Program. The unit has successfully fabricated more than 1 lakh PFBR fuel elements for the Kalpakam based Bhavini's PFBR. AFFF is presently engaged in the fabrication of PFBR fuel elements for reloads of PFBR.\nAFFF also is involved in AHWR(Thorium MOX Fuel) MOX fuel fabrication for the third stage of Indian nuclear program and is experimenting with different fabrication techniques. | \nMOX fuel fabrication at AFFF follows Powder Oxide Pelletisation (POP) Method. Major operations are mixing and milling, pre-compaction, granulation, Final compaction, Sintering, centreless grinding, degassing, endplug welding, decontamination of fuel elements and wire wrapping. AFFF also does the recycling of the rejects based on either thermal pulverisation or microwave based oxidation and reduction. AFFF uses Laser welding for encapsulation of fuel elements along with GTAW.\n\n\nBasic and applied physics\nThe interdisciplinary research includes investigation of matter under different physicochemical environments, including temperature, magnetic field and pressure. Reactors, ion and electron accelerators and lasers are being employed as tools to investigate crucial phenomena in materials over wide length and time scales. Major facilities, operated by BARC for research in Physical sciences, include the Pelletron-Superconducting linear accelerator at TIFR, the National Facility for Neutron Beam Research (NFNBR) at Dhruva, a number of state-of-the-art beam lines at INDUS synchrotron, RRCAT-Indore, the TeV Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope with Imaging Camera (TACTIC) at Mt.

It is the highest (in altitude) and second largest Cerenkov telescope in the world. It was built by Electronics Corporation of India, Hyderabad, for the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and was assembled at the campus of Indian Astronomical Observatory at Hanle. The telescope is the second-largest gamma ray telescope in the world and will help the scientific community enhance its understanding in the fields of astrophysics, fundamental physics, and particle acceleration mechanisms. The largest telescope of the same class is the 28-metre-diameter High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) telescope being operated in Namibia.\nOngoing basic and applied research encompasses a broad spectrum covering condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, astrophysical sciences and atomic and molecular spectroscopy. Important research areas include advanced magnetism, soft and nano structured materials, energy materials, thin film and multi-layers, accelerator/reactor based fusion-fission studies, nuclear-astrophysics, nuclear data management, reactor based neutrino physics, very high-energy astrophysics and astro-particle physics.\nSome of the important ongoing developmental activities are: Indian Scintillat or Matrix for Reactor Anti-Neutrinos (ISMRAN), neutron guides, polarizers and Neutron supermirror, Nb-based superconducting RF cavities, high purity Germanium detector, 2-D neutron detectors, cryogen-free superconducting magnets, electromagnetic separator for radio-isotopes, nuclear batteries and radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) power source and liquid Hydrogen cold neutron source. Other activities include research and developmental towards India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) and quantum computing.\n\n\nHigh-performance computing\n\nBARC designed and developed a series of supercomputers for their internal usage. They were mainly used for molecular dynamical simulations, reactor physics, theoretical physics, computational chemistry, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis.\nThe latest in the series is Anupam-Aganya. BARC has started development of supercomputers under the ANUPAM project in 1991 and till date, has developed more than 20 different computer systems. All ANUPAM systems have employed parallel processing as the underlying philosophy and MIMD (Multiple Instruction Multiple Data) as the core architecture. BARC, being a multidisciplinary research organization, has a large pool of scientists and engineers, working in various aspects of nuclear science and technology and thus are involved in doing diverse nature of computation.\nTo keep the gestation period short, the parallel computers were built with commercially available off-the-shelf components, with BARC's major contribution being in the areas of system integration, system engineering, system software development, application software development, fine tuning of the system and support to a diverse set of users.\nThe series started with a small four-processor system in 1991 with a sustained performance of 34 MFlops. Keeping in mind the ever increasing demands from the users, new systems have been built regularly with increasing computational power. The latest in the series of supercomputers is Anupam-Aganya with processing power of 270 TFLOPS and PARALLEL PROCESSING SUPERCOMPUTER ANUPAM-ATULYA:Provides sustained LINPACK performance of 1.35 PetaFlops for solving complex scientific problems.\n\n\nElectronics instrumentation and computers\nBARC's research and development programing electrical, electronics, instrumentation and computers is in the fields of Nuclear Science and Technology, and this has resulted in the development of various indigenous technologies.\nIn the fields of nuclear energy, many Control and Instrumentation systems including In Service Inspection Systems were designed, developed and deployed for Nuclear Reactors ranging from PHWR, AHWR, LWR, PFBR, to new generation Research Reactors and C&I for reprocessing facilities.

The ultimate focus of the programme is on enabling the thorium reserves of India to be utilised in meeting the country's energy requirements. Thorium is particularly attractive for India, as it has only around 1–2% of the global uranium reserves, but one of the largest shares of global thorium reserves at about 25% of the world's known thorium reserves.\n\n\nStage I – Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor\nIn the first stage of the programme, natural uranium fueled pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWR) produce electricity while generating plutonium-239 as by-product. PHWRs was a natural choice for implementing the first stage because it had the most efficient reactor design in terms of uranium utilisation, and the existing Indian infrastructure in the 1960s allowed for quick adoption of the PHWR technology. Natural uranium contains only 0.7% of the fissile isotope uranium-235. Most of the remaining 99.3% is uranium-238 which is not fissile but can be converted in a reactor to the fissile isotope plutonium-239. Heavy water (deuterium oxide, D2O) is used as moderator and coolant.\n\n\nStage II – Fast Breeder Reactor\nIn the second stage, fast breeder reactors (FBRs) would use a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel made from plutonium-239, recovered by reprocessing spent fuel from the first stage, and natural uranium. In FBRs, plutonium-239 undergoes fission to produce energy, while the uranium-238 present in the mixed oxide fuel transmutes to additional plutonium-239. Thus, the Stage II FBRs are designed to \"breed\" more fuel than they consume. Once the inventory of plutonium-239 is built up thorium can be introduced as a blanket material in the reactor and transmuted to uranium-233 for use in the third stage\nThe surplus plutonium bred in each fast reactor can be used to set up more such reactors, and might thus grow the Indian civil nuclear power capacity till the point where the third stage reactors using thorium as fuel can be brought online. The design of the country's first fast breeder, called Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR), was done by Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR).\n\n\nDoubling time\nDoubling time refers to the time required to extract as output, double the amount of fissile fuel, which was fed as input into the breeder reactors. This metric is critical for understanding the time durations that are unavoidable while transitioning from the second stage to the third stage of Bhabha's plan, because building up a sufficiently large fissile stock is essential to the large deployment of the third stage.\n\n\nStage III – Thorium Based Reactors\n\nA Stage III reactor or an Advanced nuclear power system involves a self-sustaining series of thorium-232–uranium-233 fuelled reactors. This would be a thermal breeder reactor, which in principle can be refueled – after its initial fuel charge – using only naturally occurring thorium. According to the three-stage programme, Indian nuclear energy could grow to about 10 GW through PHWRs fueled by domestic uranium, and the growth above that would have to come from FBRs till about 50GW.[b] The third stage is to be deployed only after this capacity has been achieved.\n\n\nParallel approaches\nAs there is a long delay before direct thorium utilisation in the three-stage programme, the country is looking at reactor designs that allow more direct use of thorium in parallel with the sequential three-stage programme. Three options under consideration are the Indian Accelerator Driven Systems (IADS), Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) and Compact High Temperature Reactor. Molten Salt Reactor is also under development.\nIndia's Department of Atomic Energy and US's Fermilab are designing unique first-of-its-kind accelerator driven systems. No country has yet built an Accelerator Driven System for power generation. Anil Kakodkar, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission called this a mega science project and a \"necessity\" for humankind.\n\n\nReactor design\nBARC has developed a wide array of nuclear reactor designs for nuclear research, production of radioisotopes, naval propulsion and electricity generation\n\n\nResearch reactors and production of radioisotopes\n\n\nCommercial reactors and power generation\n\n\nPressurized heavy-water reactors\n\nBARC has developed various sizes of IPHWR class of pressurized heavy-water reactors powered by Natural Uranium for the first-stage Three-stage nuclear power programme which produce electricity and plutonium-239 to power the fast-breeder reactors being developed by IGCAR for the second stage of the program.\nThe IPHWR class was developed from the CANDU reactors built at RAPS in Rawatbhata, Rajasthan. As of 2020, three successively larger designs IPHWR-220, IPHWR-540 and IPHWR-700 of electricity generation capacity of 220 MWe, 540 MWe and 700 MWe respectively have been developed.\n\n\nAdvanced heavy-water reactor\n\nBARC is developing a 300 MWe advanced heavy-water reactor design that is powered by thorium-232 and uranium-233 to power the third stage of India's three-stage nuclear power programme. The AHWR at standard is set to be a closed nuclear fuel cycle. AHWR-300 is expected to have design life close to 100 years and will utilise Uranium-233 produced in the fast-breeder reactors being developed by IGCAR.\n\n\nBharat small modular reactor\nThe Bharat small modular reactor (BSMR) is a reactor design under development at the BARC. It is a joint project with the NPCIL. It is a 220MWe small reactor being developed for captive use. A 55MWe  SMR and a 5MWth High temperature gas cooled reactor are also in the design stage.\n\n\nIndian molten salt breeder reactor\nThe Indian molten salt breeder reactor (IMSBR) is the platform to burn thorium as part of 3rd stage of Indian nuclear power programme. The fuel in IMSBR is in the form of a continuously circulating molten fluoride salt which flows through heat exchangers for ultimately transferring heat for power production to Super-critical CO2 based Brayton cycle (SCBC) so as to have larger energy conversion ratio as compared to existing power-conversion cycle. Because of the fluid fuel, online reprocessing is possible, extracting the 233Pa (formed in conversion chain of 232Th to 233U) and allowing it to decay to 233U outside the core, thus making it possible to breed even in thermal neutron spectrum. Hence IMSBR can operate in self-sustaining 233U-Th fuel cycle. Additionally, being a thermal reactor, the 233U requirement is lower (as compared to fast spectrum), thus allowing higher deployment potential.\n\n\nLight-water reactors\n\nBARC with experience gained from the development of the light-water reactor for the Arihant-class submarine is developing a large 900 MWe pressurized water reactor design known as IPWR-900. The design will include Generation III+ safety features like Passive Decay Heat Removal System, Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS), Corium Retention and Core Catcher System.\n\n\nMarine propulsion for naval application\nBARC has developed multiple designs of light-water reactor designs suitable for nuclear marine propulsion for Indian Navy submarines beginning with the CLWR-B1 reactor design for the Arihant-class submarine.Total four submarine will be built for this class.\n\n\nIndia and the NPT\nIndia is not a part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), citing concerns that it unfairly favours the established nuclear powers, and provides no provision for complete nuclear disarmament. Indian officials argued that India's refusal to sign the treaty stemmed from its fundamentally discriminatory character; the treaty places restrictions on the non-nuclear weapons states but does little to curb the modernisation and expansion of the nuclear arsenals of the nuclear weapons states.\nMore recently, India and the United States signed an agreement to enhance nuclear cooperation between the two countries, and for India to participate in an international consortium on fusion research, ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor).\n\n\nCivilian research\nThe BARC also researches biotechnology at the Gamma Gardens and has developed numerous disease-resistant and high-yielding crop varieties, particularly groundnuts. It also conducts research in Liquid Metal Magnetohydrodynamics for power generation.\nOn 4 June 2005, intending to encourage research in basic sciences, BARC started the Homi Bhabha National Institute. Research institutions affiliated to BARC(Bhabha Atomic Research Centre) include IGCAR (Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research), RRCAT (Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology), and VECC (Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre).\nPower projects that have benefited from BARC expertise but which fall under the NPCIL (Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited) are KAPP (Kakrapar Atomic Power Project), RAPP (Rajasthan Atomic Power Project), and TAPP (Tarapur Atomic Power Project).\nThe Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in addition to its nuclear research mandate also conducts research in other high technology areas like accelerators, micro electron beams, materials design, supercomputers, and computer vision among the few. The BARC has dedicated departments for these specialized fields. BARC has designed and developed, for its own use an infrastructure of supercomputers, Anupam using state of the art technology.\n\n\nSee also\nIPHWR, class of PHWR electricity generation reactors designed by BARC\nAHWR, thorium fuelled reactor being designed by BARC\nMilw0rm#BARC attack\nDepartment of Atomic Energy, Government of India\nIndira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research\nRaja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology\nVariable Energy Cyclotron Centre\nHomi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (disambiguation)\n\n\nReferences",
