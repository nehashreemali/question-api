It has its satellite campus in Sonipat, Haryana, and the international campus in Abu Dhabi, UAE. It is one of the 23 Indian Institutes of Technology created to be a Centre of Excellence for India's training, research and development in science, engineering and technology. It has been ranked 26th internationally for Engineering and Technology in QS Rankings by Subject 2025. Overall, it has been ranked 123rd internationally in QS World University Rankings, a jump of more than 100 places in 10 years. IIT Delhi holds the record of producing the highest number of unicorn startups in India, and one of the highest in the world.     IIT Delhi was declared an Institution of Eminence in 2018.\nEstablished in 1961, it was formally inaugurated in August 1961 by Humayun Kabir, Minister of Scientific Research & Cultural Affairs. The first admissions were made in 1961. The current campus has an area of 320 acres (or 1.3 km2) and is bound by the Sri Aurobindo Marg on the east, the Jawaharlal Nehru University Complex on the west, the National Council of Educational Research and Training on the south, and the New Ring Road on the north. It is flanked by Qutub Minar and the Hauz Khas monuments.\nThe institute was later decreed in the Institutes of National Importance under the Institutes of Technology Amendment Act, 1963, and accorded the status of a full University with powers to decide its academic policy, conduct its examinations, and award its degrees.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe concept of IIT was first introduced by Nalini Ranjan Sarkar, then a Member of Education on the Viceroy's executive council. Following his recommendations, the first Indian Institute of Technology was established in the year 1950 in Kharagpur. In his report, Shri Sircar suggested that such institutes should also be established in different parts of the country. The Government, having accepted these recommendations of the Sircar Committee, decided to establish more Institutes of Technology with the assistance of friendly countries that were prepared to help. The first offer of help came from the USSR, which agreed to collaborate in the establishment of an Institute through UNESCO in Bombay. This was followed by the Institutes of Technology at Madras, Kanpur, and Delhi with collaborations with West Germany, the United States, and UK respectively.\nH.R.H. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh laid the foundation stone of the college at Hauz Khas on 28 January 1959 during his visit to India. The first admissions were made in 1961. The College of Engineering & Technology was registered as a society on 14 June 1960 under the Societies Registration Act No. XXI of 1860 (Registration No. S1663 of 1960–61). The students were asked to report to the college on August 16, 1961, and the college was formally inaugurated on August 17, 1961, by Humayun Kabir, Minister of Scientific Research & Cultural Affairs. Initially, the college ran in the Kashmiri Gate campus of Delhi College of Engineering (now known as Delhi Technological University) before shifting to its permanent campus in Hauz Khas. The Department of Textile Technology at Delhi College of Engineering was relocated en bloc to mark the beginning of IIT Delhi at its new Hauz Khas campus. The college was later accorded university status and was renamed the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. IIT Delhi celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2011, and its Diamond Jubilee in 2021.\nIn 2018, IIT Delhi was one of the first six institutes to be awarded the Institute of Eminence status. According to a government statement issued earlier, these IoEs will have greater autonomy, allowing them to admit foreign students up to 30% of the total number of students and recruit foreign faculty up to 25% of the faculty strength, along with enhanced research funding.\nIn July 2023, IIT Delhi signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish the first global campus of IIT-Delhi in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nCampus\n\n\nMain Campus\nThe primary campus of IIT Delhi is located in Hauz Khas, South Delhi, with Sonipat and Jhajjar being the two satellite campuses.
