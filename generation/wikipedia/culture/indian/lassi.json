  "extract": "Lassi (pronounced [ləsːi]) is a yogurt–based beverage with a smoothie-like consistency. It has been called \"the most popular and traditional yogurt-based drink\" in India. It has also been described as the form in which yogurt \"is most cherished and unbeatably popular in [...] Punjab\", its \"best-loved summer drink\", and \"the air conditioner of the Punjab\".\nLassi originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent. The word 'lassi' means yogurt mixed with water in Punjabi and Hindi-Urdu.\n\nLassi is prepared by blending yogurt, water, and spices. In Punjab, the yogurt is traditionally made from water buffalo milk. However, variations of lassi can be prepared in different ways. Cumin and cardamom are the most common spices added to lassi. Lassi is traditionally served in a clay cup known as kulhar.\n\n\nVarieties\n\n\nNamkin / Namkeen lassi\nNamkin or namkeen (salty) lassi is made by adding salt, black pepper, cumin, and sugar to the yogurt-water mixture.\n\n\nLassi masalewal\nLassi masalewal (spicy lassi) is made by adding ingredients such as almonds, ginger, green chilies, and pistachios to namkin lassi.\n\n\nMeethi lassi\nMeethi (sweet) lassi is made by adding cardamom, rosewater, and saffron to the yogurt-water mixture.\n\n\nBhang lassi\nBhang lassi is a cannabis-infused drink that contains bhang, a liquid derivative of cannabis, which has effects similar to other eaten forms of cannabis. It is legal in many parts of India and mainly sold during Holi, when pakoras containing bhang are also sometimes eaten. Uttar Pradesh is known to have licensed bhang shops, and in many places, one can buy bhang products and drink bhang lassis.\n\n\nOthers\nFruits such as mangos and strawberries may be added to the yogurt-water mixture to yield, for example, mango lassi and strawberry lassi.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\n\nSmoothie\nList of yogurt-based dishes and beverages\n\n\nReferences",
