  "extract": "Paneer (pronounced [/pəˈniːr/]), is a fresh acid-set cheese, common in cuisine of South Asia, made from cow milk or buffalo milk. It is a non-aged, non-melting soft cheese made by curdling milk with an acid, such as lemon juice or citric acid. Paneer was predominantly used in most north Indian dishes and is now commonly used throughout India due to its versatility as an ingredient in diverse dishes.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe word paneer entered English from the Hindi-Urdu term panīr, which comes from Persian panir (پنیر) 'cheese', which comes from Old Iranian. Armenian panir (պանիր), Azerbaijani pəndir, Bengali ponir (পনির), Turkish peynir and Turkmen peýnir, all derived from Persian panir, also refer to cheese of any type.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe origin of paneer is debated. Ancient Indian, Afghan, Iranian and Portuguese origins have been proposed for paneer.\nLegends about Krishna make several references to milk, butter, ghee and dahi (yogurt), but do not mention sour milk cheese. According to Arthur Berriedale Keith, a kind of cheese is \"perhaps referred to\" in Rigveda 6.48.18. However, Otto Schrader (1890) believes that the Rigveda only mentions \"a skin of sour milk, not cheese in the proper sense\". Vedic literature refers to a substance that is interpreted by some authors, such as K. T. Achaya, Om Prakash and Sanjeev Kapoor, as a possible form of paneer, but without definitive evidence.\nCatherine Donnelly, author of The Oxford Companion to Cheese (2016), mentions that Vedic literature refers to cheese production made with the aid of barks of palash tree (Butea monosperma), fruits like jujube (Ziziphus mauritiana) and creeper like putika with coagulating enzymes, \"as well as Dadhanvat, a cheese-like substance made with and without pores\". According to Catherine Donnelly, these plant substances may have contained rennet-like enzymes and notes that the \"Vedas may include some of the earliest known references to rennet-coagulated cheeses\". Lokopakara text dated to the 10th century gives two recipes for coagulated cheeses made from buffalo milk for making sweets using plants and roots. According to the text, buffalo milk was coagulated using roots of amaranth plant or leaves of marsh barbel (Hygrophila auriculata); the soft cheese produced in this manner was called Haluvuga. In the second recipe, buffalo milk was coagulated with Indian mallow (Abutilon indicum) or country mallow (Sida cordifolia) and was made into balls for sweets. Manasollasa, a Sanskrit-language text by the 12th-century king Someshvara III, describes Kshiraprakara, a similar sweet food prepared from milk solids after separating boiled milk using buttermilk.\nAnother theory is that like the word itself, paneer originated in Persianate lands and spread to the Indian subcontinent under Muslim rule. Paneer, according to this theory, was developed and moulded to suit local tastes under these rulers, and the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire are when paneer as currently known developed. Another theory states that paneer is Afghan in origin and spread to India from the lands that make up Afghanistan. National Dairy Research Institute states that paneer was introduced into India by Afghan and Iranian invaders. Based on texts such as Charaka Samhita, BN Mathur wrote that the earliest evidence of a heat-acid coagulated milk product in India can be traced to 75–300 CE, in the Kushan-Satavahana era. Sunil Kumar et al.(2011) interpret this product as the present-day paneer. According to them, paneer is indigenous to the north-western part of South Asia and was introduced in India by Afghan and Iranian travellers.\nAnother theory is that the Portuguese may have introduced the technique of \"breaking\" milk with acid to Bengal in the 17th century. Thus, according to this theory, Indian acid-set cheeses such as paneer and chhena were first prepared in Bengal, under Portuguese influence. A type of smoked cheese called Bandel cheese was introduced by the Portuguese in Bengal, which is distinct from paneer.\n\n\nNutrition and preparation\n\nPaneer is prepared by adding food acid, such as lemon juice, vinegar, citric acid or dahi (yogurt), to hot milk to separate the curds from the whey. The curds are drained in muslin or cheesecloth and the excess water is pressed out. The resulting paneer is dipped in chilled water for 2–3 hours to improve its texture and appearance. From this point, the preparation of paneer diverges based on its use and regional tradition.\nIn north Indian cuisines, the curds are wrapped in cloth, placed under a heavy weight such as a stone slab for two to three hours, and then cut into cubes for use in curries. Pressing for a shorter time (approximately 20 minutes) results in a softer, fluffier cheese.\nIn Bengali, Odia and other East Indian cuisines, the chhena are beaten or kneaded by hand into a dough-like consistency, heavily salted and hardened to produce paneer (called ponir), which is typically eaten in slices at teatime with biscuits or various types of bread, deep-fried in a light batter or used in cooking.\nIn the area surrounding the city of Surat in Gujarat, surti paneer is made by draining the curds and ripening them in whey for 12 to 36 hours.\n\n\nUse in dishes\nPaneer is the most common type of cheese used in traditional cuisines from the Indian subcontinent. It is sometimes wrapped in dough and deep-fried or served with either roti(Indian bread). Paneer dishes can be sweet, like shahi paneer, or spicy/hot, like chilli paneer.\n\n\nPaneer dishes\nSome paneer recipes include:\n\nMatar paneer (paneer with peas)\nShahi paneer (paneer cooked in a Mughlai curry)\nPaneer tikka (a vegetarian version of chicken tikka, paneer placed on skewers and roasted)\nPaneer tikka masala\nChilli paneer (an Indo-Chinese preparation with spicy chilies, onions and green peppers, usually served dry and garnished with spring onions)\nKadai Paneer\nPaneer pakora (paneer fritters)\nPalak paneer\nKhoya paneer\nPaneer momo\nPaneer makhani\nPaneer pasanda (shallow-fried stuffed paneer sandwiches in a smooth, creamy onion-tomato based gravy)\nPaneer lababdar\nPaneer Dopiaza (named so because twice the normal amount of onions are used in this recipe).\n\n\nSimilar cheeses\n\nAnari, a fresh mild whey cheese produced in Cyprus, is very similar in taste and texture to fresh Indian paneer. Circassian cheese is produced using a similar method and is close in consistency to paneer, but is usually salted. Farmer cheese (pressed curds) and firm versions of quark are similar except that they are made from cultured milk and may be salted. Although many South Asians translate \"paneer\" into \"cottage cheese\", cottage cheese is made using rennet extracted from the stomach of ruminants, and cow's skim milk. Queso blanco or queso fresco are often recommended as substitutes in the Americas and Spain as they are more commercially available in many American markets. Queso blanco can be a closer match, as it is acid-set while queso fresco frequently uses rennet at a lower temperature. Both are generally salted, unlike paneer. It also shares some similarities to queso panela, as well as unsalted halloumi (although it is made using rennet).\n\n\nSee also\nKalari cheese – Indian traditional ripened cheese\nChhurpi - Himalayan cheese\nShosha (cheese) – Tibetan cheese\nKesong puti – Filipino soft carabao's milk cheese\nCottage cheese – Type of cheese\n\n\nReferences",
