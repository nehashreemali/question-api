  "extract": "Butter chicken is a type of curry made from chicken cooked in a spiced tomato and butter-based (makhan) gravy. The gravy is typically known for its creamy, rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste. The dish originates in Delhi, India.\n\n\nHistory\nThe curry was allegedly developed at the Moti Mahal restaurant in the Daryaganj neighbourhood of Old Delhi in the 1950s, after the Partition of India by Kundan Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral, who were both Punjabi Hindu refugees from Peshawar, in the North-West Frontier Province of British India. The curry was made \"by chance\" by mixing leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato sauce, rich in butter (makhan). \nIn 1975, the English phrase \"butter chicken\" curry first appeared in print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord Indian restaurant in Manhattan. In Canada and the Caribbean, it can be found as a filling in pizza, poutine, wraps, roti, or rolls, while in Australia and New Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling. The curry is common in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and many other countries where a South Asian diaspora is present. Due to its popularity outside of India, it is sometimes mistakenly assumed to be of Western origin (like chicken tikka masala, which it is sometimes confused with).\nIn 2024, the owners of restaurant sued a rival restaurant in a dispute over credit for inventing the dish.\n\n\nPreparation\nChicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt), Kashmiri red chilli, salt, garam masala, ginger paste, and garlic paste.\nThe marinated chicken is cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, oven-roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato, garlic, and ginger-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated. There are many variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is velvety smooth. Spices may include cardamom, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, garam masala, and dried fenugreek leaves (Punjabi/Hindi: kasuri methi). Cashew paste may be used as a thickener and it is finally garnished with coriander.\n\n\nSee also\n\nBiryani\nDal makhani\nList of chicken dishes\nList of Indian dishes\nPaneer makhani\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nCurry Club Tandoori and Tikka Dishes.
