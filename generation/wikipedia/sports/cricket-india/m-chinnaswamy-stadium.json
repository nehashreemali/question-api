  "extract": "The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, also known as the Karnataka State Cricket Association Stadium, is a cricket stadium in Bengaluru city of the Indian state of Karnataka. The ground is owned by the Government of Karnataka and operated by the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA).\nFlanked by the picturesque Cubbon Park, Queen's Road, Cubbon and uptown MG Road, this five-decade-old stadium is situated in the heart of the city of Bangalore. It regularly hosts Test, ODI, T20I and first-class cricket matches, as well as musical, cultural events. The stadium is the home ground of the Karnataka men's, Karnataka women's as well as franchises RCB men's and RCB women's teams. It is owned by the Government of Karnataka and has been leased out to the KSCA for a period of 100 years.\nFormerly known as the Karnataka State Cricket Association Stadium, it was later rechristened in tribute to M. Chinnaswamy, a lawyer from Mandya and the founding member of the Mysore State Cricket Association. He served the KSCA for four decades and was also president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from 1977 to 1980, latter's National Cricket Academy also situated in the premises of this stadium.\nIt is the first cricket stadium in the world to use solar panels to generate a bulk of the electricity needed to run the stadium. The panels were procured through the \"Go Green\" initiative of the KSCA. In 2016 a water purification plant was added, and by January 2017 a sophisticated  system of aeration and drainage was in place to avoid matches being curtailed due to a wet outfield.\n\n\nHistory\n\nWith generous patronage from the Government of Karnataka, the foundation stone of this stadium was laid in 1969 and construction work commenced in 1970. The stadium was first used for First-class cricket matches during the 1972–73 season. It earned test status during the 1974–75 season when the West Indies toured India.\nThe Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) stadium, as it was known was later renamed as a tribute to M. Chinnaswamy, who was the BCCI President from 1977 to 1980 and the Secretary and President of KSCA. Born in Mandya in 1900, he was the founding member of the Mysore State Cricket Association and a lawyer by profession. He, helped by other eminent people, was instrumental in prevailing upon the Government of Karnataka to allot the ground for cricket in the prime MG Road area in 1969.\nThe first Test played at this stadium was on 22–27 November 1974. This was the debut Test match for the West Indian batsmen Viv Richards and Gordon Greenidge. The West Indians led by Clive Lloyd crushed M. A. K. Pataudi's Indian team by 256 runs. India registered their first Test win on this ground against the touring English team led by Tony Greig in 1976–77. The first ODI match at this venue was played on 6 September 1982. India defeated Sri Lanka by six wickets in that match.\nFloodlights were first installed at this stadium for the 1996 Wills World Cup. The first match played here under lights was the quarter-final clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan on 9 March 1996 in which India defeated Pakistan by 39 runs. In 2007, in the 3rd Test Match between India and Pakistan, Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh led a 300 run partnership fightback from 61/4, breaking several records. India's 365/5 at stumps was the highest first-day score in India. The 300 run partnership was the highest partnership at the stadium and the highest left-hander batsmen partnership. Sourav Ganguly's 239 is the highest left-hander score.\nSince the BCCI chose Bangalore as the centre for the National Cricket Academy in 2000, many budding cricketers have passed out of the academy housed on this ground. Chinnaswamy Stadium is also the home ground of the Bangalore franchise team, the Royal Challengers Bangalore. It was painted in red and yellow, the team colours of the Royal Challengers and also the colours of the Karnataka flag (cultural flag). This stadium also served as the venue for the 1996 Miss World pageant, when it was first held in India. \nFollowing a crowd crush on 4 June 2025 which resulted in 11 fatalities, the stadium was deemed unfit to organise large gatherings and hence was withdrawn from list of IPL stadiums for 2026. In August 2025, ICC announced that the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai replaced Bengaluru for the ICC Women's World Cup 2025.\n\n\nFeatures\nKarnataka State Cricket Association claims that their stadium is world's only solar powered cricket stadium. They inspired to install a solar system at the stadium from Germany's Freiburg football stadium, which is fully powered by solar energy. KSCA initiated the ₹4.5 Cr and 400 KW project in February 2015.\nThe venue has 40,000 seats. Its ground is small thus it has small boundaries, due to this, batting teams often score high totals here. It is evident by the fact that in the 2023 Indian Premier League edition, teams scored 210 plus runs on four and 170+ on three occasions in 8 innings played here. As per former Royal Challengers Bangalore's bowler Harshal Patel \"It is hard to bowl at the Chinnaswamy. It is a small ground and the ball generally flies\". \n\n\nCricket World Cups\nThis stadium has hosted One Day International (ODI) matches for all editions of the World cups, when India was a host/co-host.\n\nQuarter final match\n\n\nDomestic Cricket\nThe arena is regular venue of domestic cricket. It is home ground of Karnataka cricket team. Since 2008, it is the home ground of IPL team Royal Challengers Bangalore. The first ever game of the IPL was held at the venue.  In 1998-99 Ranji trophy final at the venue, Karnataka won against Madhya Pradesh (MP). In June 2022, 2021-22 edition final of the tournament MP won its maiden title by defeating Mumbai cricket team. 2022-23 Ranji semifinal held at the venue Saurashtra cricket team defeated Karnataka.\nIn the final of the 2019-20 Vijay Hazare trophy Karnataka defeated Tamil Nadu there. In October 2018, in the tournament's edition Mumbai won the final by defeating Delhi at the venue.\n\n\nEvents\nMiss World 1996 beauty pageant was held in this stadium, it was the first ever that this event was organised in India. Irene Skliva of Greece became the winner.\n\n\nSustainability initiatives\nThe M. Chinnaswamy Stadium has adopted several sustainability initiatives to minimise its environmental impact.\n\n\nSolar energy utilisation\nThe stadium is recognised for its utilisation of solar energy. A solar power plant was established, generating over six lakh units of electricity in the first year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 600 tonnes. The solar panels, initially installed on the east end, are being extended to the west end to increase electricity generation.\n\n\nWater management\nA comprehensive water management system is in place, which includes rainwater harvesting and a sewage treatment plant. The treatment plant recycles sewage water for turf watering, gardening, and landscaping. This initiative was developed in collaboration with the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewage Board (BWSSB).\n\n\nSubair drainage system\nThe 'subair drainage system' installed at the stadium facilitates rapid water drainage, allowing the ground to dry within 10 to 15 minutes after heavy rains, thus minimising match interruptions due to wet conditions.\n\n\nOther Eco-friendly measures\nAdditional measures to reduce environmental impact include a water purification plant and an efficient aeration and drainage system.\n\n\nRecognition and replication\nThe sustainability initiatives at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium have been noted, with some cricket associations in India considering replicating these initiatives. These eco-friendly projects were self-funded by the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA).\n\n\nRecords and statistics\nOn 14 June 2018, after being granted 'Test Status' by the ICC in 2017, Afghanistan played their first ever test match at this venue against India.\nThe only T20I match in which double super over was played is in this stadium between India and Afghanistan on 17 January 2024 where Rohit Sharma scored his 5th century in T20I.
