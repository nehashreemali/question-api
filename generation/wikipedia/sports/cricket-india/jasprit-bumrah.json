He is widely regarded as the world's best active all-format pace bowler, and one of the best fast bowlers of all time. Bumrah is the first bowler to attain the number one ranking in the ICC Men's Player Rankings across all three formats, and the first Indian bowler to take 100 wickets in each format. He represents Gujarat in domestic cricket and Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League. \nAmong Indian fast bowlers, he's the fastest to 200 Test wickets and the second fastest to 100 ODI wickets. He was a crucial member of the Indian team that won the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he was named the Player of the Tournament for taking 15 wickets with an average economy of 4.17.\nBumrah made his domestic debut in 2012–13 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and also helped his side clinch its maiden title victory. His first-class debut came against Vidarbha, during the 2013–14 season of the Ranji Trophy. Bumrah was signed by the Mumbai Indians for the 2013 season of IPL. Since then, he has played for MI, contributing to the team's title wins five times. He is the second highest wicket-taker for MI after Lasith Malinga, with 181 wickets in 142 matches.\nBumrah made his international debut in January 2016 during India's tour of Australia, where he emerged as the highest wicket-taker of the T20 series. In 2016, he was the highest wicket-taker in a calendar year in T20I cricket, with 28 wickets. He made his Test debut in 2018 against South Africa. Since December 2023, he has served as the vice-captain of the Indian team in Test cricket and has also captained the team thrice in the absence of regular skipper Rohit Sharma. He was named in the ICC Men's Test Team of the Year in 2018 and 2024, in the ICC Men's ODI Team of the Year in 2017 and 2018, and in the ICC Men's T20I Team of the Year in 2024.

He was also named in the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 2022.\nNotably, Bumrah achieved a milestone in 2024 by surpassing Ravichandran Ashwin's highest ICC Test bowling rating for an Indian bowler. Bumrah concluded the year as the leading wicket-taker in Test cricket, with 71 wickets, and reached a career-high rating of 908 points, placing him joint-16th on the all-time list. His performances, including a nine-wicket haul in the Melbourne Test in December 2024, secured his position as the top-ranked bowler in the ICC Men's Test Rankings, and led to him being awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy and the ICC Men's Test Cricketer of the Year in the 2024 ICC Awards.\n\n\nEarly life\nBumrah was born on 6 December 1993 into a Sikh Punjabi Ramgarhia family in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. His father, Jasbir Singh, ran a chemical business, while his mother, Daljeet Bumrah, worked as a school teacher. His father died due to hepatitis B when Bumrah was 5 years old. His mother raised him and his sister Juhika in a middle-class environment in Ahmedabad. Bumrah attended Nirman High School in Vastrapur, Ahmedabad, where his mother worked as the vice principal. He also played cricket for Nirman's team.\n\n\nYouth and domestic career\nIn 2010, Bumrah appeared at the Gujarat Cricket Association's Under-19 district selection trials. The selectors did not include him in the main squad of 15 due to his unconventional bowling action but named him as a reserve. After the district team won the first three matches, all three reserve players were given a chance in the fourth three-day match. Bumrah took seven wickets in that match.\nBumrah made his twenty20 (T20) debut for Gujarat against Maharashtra in the 2012–13 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, and helped his side clinch the title with his Man of the Match performance in the final, with figures of 3/14 to beat Punjab. On 18 March 2013, during the match against Mumbai, former India coach John Wright, who was then the head coach of Mumbai Indians (MI) and scouting for the team at the time, was impressed by Bumrah's performance and invited him to sign up for MI.\nBumrah played first-class cricket for Gujarat and made his debut against Vidarbha in October 2013 during the 2013–14 season, where he took seven wickets for 89 runs. During the 2015–16 Vijay Hazare Trophy, after the first two matches, the umpires called him for throwing and raised objections about his bowling action. The issue was resolved when the team management protested against it. Gujarat won the trophy, with Bumrah taking a five-wicket haul in the final against Delhi. On 11 December 2020, he scored his maiden first-class half century (55 not out) against Australia A during the India tour of Australia.\n\n\nInternational career\n\n\n2016–2017: International debut\nBumrah made his ODI debut in January 2016 against Australia in the last match of the ODI series, where he took his first international wicket – that of Steve Smith – and finished with figures of 2/40. In the first match of the T20I series that followed Bumrah made his debut, taking his maiden T20I wicket – that of David Warner – and finished with figures of 3/23. India won the T20I series and Bumrah was the highest wicket-taker on either side with six wickets. In February 2016, he took three wickets in the T20I series against Sri Lanka.\nBumrah was named in India's 15-man squad for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20. He took a wicket in every single match of the tournament except against Bangladesh.

Bumrah was the second highest wicket-taker for India behind teammate Mohammed Shami.\n\nIn June 2018, in the first match of India's tour of Ireland, Bumrah fractured his left thumb while attempting a catch; the injury caused him to miss the remainder of the tour and the first two Test matches of the 2018 Pataudi Trophy. He returned for the third Test match at Trent Bridge, where he took his second five-wicket haul and finished with figures of 5/85 from 29 overs. He was the fifth leading wicket-taker of the series with 14 wickets from three matches, in a series where India faced a 4–1 defeat.\nDuring the Boxing Day Test of India Tour of Australia 2018, with career-best figures of 6/33, Bumrah became the first Asian bowler to take five-wicket hauls in Australia, England, and South Africa in the same calendar year.

At Sydney, Bumrah faced racist abuse from the crowd, prompting India to file a formal complaint at the end of day three. Subsequently, Cricket Australia issued an apology to the Indian team. India won the final test, securing victory in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Bumrah was the fifth highest wicket-taker of the series with 11 wickets. He played his maiden Test match in India in the M.

He scored 29 runs in an over bowled by Stuart Broad, beating the 18-year-old Test record set by Brian Lara (who had scored 28 runs in an over). The over also included six extras, meaning it cost a total of 35 runs. In September 2021, Bumrah was named in India's squad for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. He was one of only four fast bowlers in the main squad, alongside Mohammed Shami, the white-ball specialist, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and the bowling all-rounder Shardul Thakur. India was knocked out of the tournament without reaching the semi-finals.\nIn February 2022, Bumrah was named vice-captain of India for the T20I and Test series against Sri Lanka as the regular vice-captain, KL Rahul, was unavailable. He took his maiden Test five-wicket haul in India during the second match of the series. In April 2022, Bumrah was among the Wisden Five Cricketers of the Year. During the 2022 India tour of England, in the first match of the ODI series, he took 6 wicket for 19 runs, India's best figures against England, and the third best figures for India in ODIs. In July 2022, Bumrah regained the number one spot in the ICC Men's ODI player rankings, overtaking New Zealand's Trent Boult. Bumrah missed the 2022 Asia Cup in August due to a back injury; he also missed the 2022 T20 World Cup in October. He featured in two of the three T20Is against Australia but was pulled out on the eve of the South Africa series, India's last before the 2022 T20 World Cup, after he complained of back pain.\n\n\n2023: Injury and 2023 Cricket World Cup\n\nIn January 2023, Bumrah missed the home series against Sri Lanka due to his back injury. He underwent back surgery in March 2023. He also missed the 2023 ICC World Test Championship final against Australia in June 2023. In August 2023, after nearly a year, Bumrah made his comeback to international cricket as India's captain in the series against Ireland. Bumrah was the player of the series, which India won 2–0.\nOn 21 August 2023, Bumrah was named in India's squad for the 2023 Asia Cup. He played his first match in the tournament against Pakistan, scoring 16 runs off 14 balls, but the match was abandoned due to rain. He was replaced by Mohammed Shami for the match against Nepal because he flew back to Mumbai for personal reasons. India won the tournament by beating Sri Lanka in the final. Bumrah played four matches and took four wickets, averaging 17.75 with an economy rate of 4.17 runs per over.\nIn September 2023, Bumrah was named in India's 15-man squad for 2023 Cricket World Cup.

In the final, against Australia at Ahmedabad, he took 2 wickets for 43 runs at an economy rate of 4.77. India lost the final, and Bumrah finished as the fourth leading wicket-taker of the tournament with 20 wickets at an average of 18.65 and economy rate of 4.06. He was the most economical bowler in the World Cup among those who took 10 wickets or more, with the next most economical being Keshav Maharaj taking 15 wickets at an economy rate of 4.15.\n\n\n2024: 2024 T20 World Cup, Border Gavaskar Trophy\nOn 3 February 2024, during England's tour of India, in the second match of the series, Bumrah became the joint third-fastest (34 matches) Indian bowler and the fastest Indian pacer to take 150 wickets in Test cricket. He took 6 wickets for 45 runs, his third-best bowling figure in Tests, and was awarded the Player of the Match award. He became the first Indian fast bowler to reach the number one ranking in the ICC Test player rankings and the first bowler to achieve the number one ranking in all three formats of the game. He took 19 wickets in four matches and emerged as the third-highest wicket-taker of the series, behind Ravichandran Ashwin of India and Tom Hartley of England.\n\nIn June 2024, Bumrah was part of India's squad for the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

The next most economical was Anrich Nortje, who took 15 wickets at an economy rate of 5.74, with no other bowler in that group recording an economy below six. Bumrah was named the player of the tournament following India's win in the final against South Africa. In the final vs South Africa, Bumrah helped deliver a near miraculous win for India;  with South Africa needing only 30 runs from 30 balls and 6 wickets in hand, he gave away only 6 runs in 2 overs and took the wicket of Marco Jansen.\nIn September 2024, Bumrah achieved the milestone of 400 international wickets during the first Test match between India and Bangladesh. With this accomplishment, he became the sixth Indian fast bowler to reach this significant mark. In December 2024,Bumrah became the number 1 bowler in the ICC player rankings with 904 points,equalling the career-best rating of Ravichandran Ashwin. \nIn the Border–Gavaskar Trophy, Bumrah became the fastest Indian fast bowler to reach 200 Test wickets in his 44th match with the best bowling average among bowlers to have taken 200 wickets. His 32 wickets in the series are the most taken by an Indian bowler in an overseas Test series. Among visiting bowlers to Australia, Bumrah's 32 wickets are joint fourth most with England's Maurice Tate leading with 38 wickets in the Ashes series of 1924–25. He broke Bishen Singh Bedi's record of 31 wickets set in 1977–78.\n\n\nFranchise career\n\nDuring the 2013–14 season of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, John Wright, who was then the head coach of the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Mumbai Indians (MI) and scouting for the team at the time, was impressed by Bumrah's performance and invited him to sign up for the franchise. Bumrah has played for the Mumbai Indians since 2013 IPL and helped the team win the title five times in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020. He has taken 170 wickets in 138 matches in the IPL, with an average of 22.78 and an economy rate of 7.32, making him the joint highest wicket-taker for the team with Lasith Malinga. He has two five and four-wicket hauls in the league.\nBumrah made his IPL debut at the age of 19, where he concluded with figures of 3/32 against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB).

He was then benched for the remainder of the season and only played in the match against the Delhi Daredevils, where he did not take a wicket. Despite only playing two matches in the 2013 season, the Mumbai Indians retained him for the 2014 season. He went wicketless in his first two matches of the 2014 season.

In the match against RCB, he achieved his second five-wicket haul, finishing with figures of 5/21. Bumrah ended the season with a total of 20 wickets, making him the third-highest wicket-taker of the tournament.\n\n\nBowling style\nBumrah gained prominence with his unorthodox action and hyperextended elbows. His run-up is short, the first part of which consists of small, stuttering strides. He has an anomalous, stiff-armed action yet generates high pace, and his unusual point of release makes it difficult for batters to read his bowling. Accordingly, the Indian team often uses him in powerplay and death overs. He bowls outside the off-stump, yorkers and short length balls frequently. According to former international bowler Shoaib Akhtar, Bumrah's bowling action has the potential to cause back injuries. Bumrah's front-on bowling action means that bowlers like him generate speed primarily from their shoulders and back, increasing the risk of injury.\n\nBumrah targets the stumps more often than any other bowler who bowls at his pace, nearly 141 kilometres per hour (88 mph). He bowls nearly 43% of his deliveries on a good line and length. He has the highest average pace among bowlers who hit the good line and length at least as frequently. Additionally, he utilises lateral movement of the ball in his deliveries, capable of swinging it both ways and using reverse swing, especially in Indian conditions.\nBumrah's hyper-extended right elbow allows him to release the ball from beyond the bowling crease, creating the illusion of increased speed by reducing the ball's travel distance by nearly half a meter. This hyperextension also enables him to impart an extraordinary amount of backspin on the ball, which produces lift towards the batter (see Magnus effect). His slower variation, the off cutter, has dismissed many batters over the years. Its effectiveness stems from his ability to reverse the lift by imparting enough revolutions on the ball in the opposite direction, causing the ball to dip which makes it land slightly earlier. Another notable skill is his ability to hit various lengths without significantly altering his release point, making it difficult for batters to pick the length from his hand. Additionally, his beyond-the-perpendicular release point allows him to angle the ball into right-handed batters and away from left-handers from over the wicket.\nBumrah has earned a reputation for his late-swinging yorker, which he says he learned by practising with a tennis ball. Bumrah has grown into an asset for the Indian team in the limited-overs format. He is considered one of the fastest Indian bowlers, with an average speed of 142 km/h and his fastest recorded speed being 153 km/h which was recorded during the first Test match of the India Tour of Australia 2018 at the Adelaide Oval, outpacing Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins.\n\n\"My all-time favourite bowlers are Mitchell Johnson, Wasim Akram and Brett Lee. I used to watch their videos and learn from them. I have learnt a lot from Johnson, and Malinga too. I try to learn from any senior bowlers who have played international cricket.\"\nMumbai Indians bowling coach and former New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond said: \"Boom's action, though unique, is repeatable. He has great control.\" Former Indian fast bowler Ashish Nehra also commented on Bumrah's bowling action, stating, \"What you do in 75–80% of your run-up, nothing matters. It's the last 15–20%, the last four-five steps, which is the main thing. That is bowling. Bumrah runs differently, but in his last three-four steps – he is loading, front leg, back leg, everything is in alignment, and he is quick through the air.\"\n\n\nOutside cricket\n\n\nPersonal life\nOn 15 March 2021, Bumrah married model and presenter Sanjana Ganesan in Goa. Hailing from Pune, Maharashtra, Ganesan is a former Miss India finalist and was also a participant in MTV's Splitsvilla in 2014. Bumrah and Ganesan first met in an interview during the 2013 Indian Premier League. They became friends after that first meeting, and after dating for two years, they married in 2021. On 4 September 2023, their son was born.\n\n\nPublic image\nAccording to Forbes India, in August 2023 Bumrah had around 25 million followers on social media, including over 10 million on Instagram, which is the highest social media following among bowlers in the world. Financial advisory firm Kroll placed Bumrah in the top 45 most valued celebrities of the country, with an estimated brand value of ₹100 crore (equivalent to ₹106 crore or US$13 million in 2023) in the year 2022. He was the only bowler in the top 50. As of August 2023, he charges in the range of ₹1.5 to ₹2 crore a day for an endorsement. His brand value is estimated to increase by 25 to 30 per cent in the next 12 months. Forbes India included Bumrah in its Celebrity 100 list in the years 2018 and 2019.\n\n\nAcclaim\nBumrah is regarded by many as the world's best all-format pace bowler in modern cricket. He has received praise from numerous former cricketers, analysts, commentators, current players, and fans for his exceptional fast bowling skills, accuracy, and performance. Notably, Pakistan's legendary fast bowler Wasim Akram explicitly described him as the \"best bowler in the world,\" emphasising his ability to execute yorkers and perform under pressure. Other legendary fast bowlers, including Andy Roberts, Curtly Ambrose, Ian Bishop, and Waqar Younis, have lauded his unique action, impact, precision, and psychological dominance over batters. Lasith Malinga, Matthew Hayden and Dale Steyn have also commended Bumrah for his mastery of yorkers and his adaptability across different conditions. Indian cricket figures such as Sachin Tendulkar, Irfan Pathan, Ravi Shastri, and Sunil Gavaskar have highlighted his consistency and leadership in India's bowling attack, while Ricky Ponting and commentator Harsha Bhogle have praised his tactical acumen and composure in critical moments of the game.\n\n\nAwards\nBumrah won the Polly Umrigar Award for best male cricketer for India thrice, in 2018–19, 2021–22, and 2023–24.\nAdditionally, he received the Dilip Sardesai Award for taking the highest number of wickets in Test cricket in 2018–19. \nFor his achievements during India's tour of England in 2021, he was selected by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in its 2022 edition. \nBumrah was conferred with The Times of India TOISA Cricketer of the Year award in 2021.\n\n\nHonours\n\n\nIndia\nMen's T20 World Cup: 2024\nAsia Cup: 2016, 2018, 2023, 2025\n\n\nIndividual\nICC Men's Test Cricketer of the Year: 2024\nSir Garfield Sobers Trophy: 2024\nICC Men's Player of the Month: June 2024 & December 2024\nWisden Leading Cricketer in the World: 2024\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nJasprit Bumrah at ESPNcricinfo\nJasprit Bumrah's profile page on Wisden",
