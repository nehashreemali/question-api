  "extract": "The Gujarat Titans, also known as GT, are a professional Twenty20 cricket team based in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, that competes in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The home ground of the team is Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The franchise is owned by Torrent Group and CVC Capital Partners. The team is captained by Shubman Gill and coached by Ashish Nehra. They won their maiden title in their debut season in 2022 under captain Hardik Pandya and secured the runners-up position the following season, in 2023.\n\n\nFranchise history\nThe Governing Council of the Indian Premier League issued an invitation to tender for two new sides in August 2021. A total of 22 companies declared an interest, but with a high base price for the new teams, there were no more than six serious bidders. The Board of Control for Cricket in India allowed a consortium of three companies or individuals to bid for each franchise. In October 2021, CVC Capital Partners won the rights to operate the Ahmedabad franchise with a bid of ₹5,625 crore (US$670 million). Ahead of the IPL 2022 auctions, the franchise drafted Hardik Pandya as their captain. In February 2022, the team was officially named Gujarat Titans.\nIn Feb 2025,  Torrent Group has acquired a majority stake (67%) in the franchise, with CVC Capital Partners retaining a minority stake (33%).\n\n\nTeam history\nAlthough their auction methods and their selections during their first-ever auction were considered weak, and the team was written off, the Titans surprised everyone with their performances, gaining their first win against fellow newcomers Lucknow Super Giants. That win was the first in their inaugural campaign, which saw the Titans eventually win 10 of their 14 group matches, qualifying at the top of the table with 20 points. They then won the first qualifier against Rajasthan Royals, whom they would meet again in the final after their qualifier win against Royal Challengers Bangalore. Gujarat won the final by restricting Rajasthan to 130 on a pitch on which they were asked to bowl first, and chasing down the target with 11 balls to spare, which included Shubman Gill hitting the winning six off the first ball of the 19th over. Hardik Pandya was adjudged the Man of the Match for his bowling figures of 3/17 and his 34 from 30 balls with a strike rate of 113.33. Critics have praised Pandya's captaincy, bowling, and batting, with many agreeing that he and the management used their players well and worked as a team to win the tournament.\nThis win meant that Gujarat became the second team to win the IPL in their first season after Rajasthan Royals in the inaugural season.\n\n\nTeam rivalries\nRajasthan Royals\nRajasthan Royals (also known as RR), are the main rivals of GT. They faced off in the 2022 finals, the first season GT was introduced in the IPL, where GT beat them in the finals to win their first championship. Although GT has had the upper hand with matches against RR for the most part, every season when these teams face off there is nervousness and rivalry between fans. The rivalry has been further accelerated as former RR players went to play for GT such as Rahul Tewatia, Prasidh Krishna, David Miller, and most importantly Jos Buttler. \nMumbai Indians\nMumbai Indians (also known as MI), are another rival team of GT. This is a relatively new rivalry, but they have clashed in 8 games so far. Out of these 8 games, GT have won 5 and MI have won 3 times. MI won the first match in 2022, but GT beat them 5 times after that, with a win for MI in between. GT and MI's main clashes were in 2023 and 2025. In 2023, MI won the Eliminator against Lucknow Super Giants, and GT lost the first qualifier against Chennai Super Kings, which meant they had to face off against MI in the second qualifier. The match was in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, so GT had a home court advantage and won by 62 runs. In 2025, The two teams faced off in the Eliminator, and the match was in Punjab, so no one had a home court advantage. GT had defeated MI in every game since the second qualifier in 2023, but MI won by 20 runs, and advanced to the second qualifier. That means MI have won the most recent match.\n\n\nTeam identity\nThe team anthem is 'Aava De'. It is written on the backside \nof the team's jersey. In the first IPL season, the song was sung by Aditya Gadhvi. The team's other anthem for the IPL 2024 season is 'GT Karshe'.\n\n\nHome ground\nThe team's home ground is the Narendra Modi Stadium, which is situated in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.\n\n\nCaptaincy record\nLast updated: 30 May 2025 \n\n\nCurrent squad\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\n *  denotes a player who is currently unavailable for selection.\n *  denotes a player who is unavailable for rest of the season.\n\n\nStaff record\n\n\nSponsors\n\n\nTeam records\n\n\nOverall results in the IPL\nLast updated: 30 May 2025\n\nPerformance in IPL Knockouts\n\n\nBy Opponent\nLast updated: 30 May 2025 \n\n\nFirst IPL match wins\n\n\nResult records\n\n\nGreatest win margin (by runs)\n\n\nGreatest win margin (by balls remaining)\n\n\nGreatest win (by wickets)\n\n\nNarrowest win margin (by runs)\n\n\nNarrowest win margin (by balls remaining)\n\n\nNarrowest win margins (by wickets)\n\n\nGreatest loss margin (by runs)\n\n\nGreatest loss margin (by balls remaining)\n\n\nGreatest loss margins (by wickets)\n\n\nNarrowest loss margin (by runs)\n\n\nNarrowest loss margin (by balls remaining)\n\n\nNarrowest loss margins (by wickets)\n\n\nTeam scoring records\n\n\nHighest Totals\n\n\nLowest Totals\n\n\nHighest Totals Conceded\n\n\nLowest Totals Conceded\n\n\nHighest match aggregate\n\n\nLowest match aggregate\n\n\nBatting records\n\n\nMost career runs\nA run is the basic means of scoring in cricket.
