The team was one of the eight debut franchises when the league was established in 2008. The team plays its home matches at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium and is owned by Chennai Super Kings Cricket.\nThe Super Kings are the joint-most successful IPL franchise, along with Mumbai Indians, having won five IPL titles each. It has also appeared in ten finals and qualified for the playoff stages 12 times, the most amongst the IPL teams. The franchise has also won the Champions League Twenty20 twice in 2010 and 2014. The team is currently captained by Ruturaj Gaikwad and coached by Stephen Fleming.\nThe Super Kings were suspended for two years from the IPL from July 2015 to 2017 due to the involvement of its owners in the 2013 IPL spot-fixing and betting case.

As of 2022, it was the second most valuable IPL franchise with a valuation of $1.15 billion.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nEarly years (2008–09)\nIn September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League (IPL), a Twenty20 competition with the inaugural season planned for 2008. Chennai was one of the eight city-based franchises unveiled for the inaugural edition in January 2008.\n\nThe player auction for the inaugural IPL season took place in January 2008. Then captain of the Indian team MS Dhoni was bought by the Super Kings for $1.5 million, the most expensive buy at the auction.

Murali Vijay, who won the Man of the Match in the final, was awarded the Golden Bat for scoring the most runs in the tournament, and Ravichandran Ashwin, who was the leading wicket-taker, was adjudged the Player of the Series.\n\nFor the 2011 IPL season, a fresh auction was held after two new teams were added to the IPL.

At the auction, the franchise bought Brendon McCullum, Dwayne Smith, Faf du Plessis, Ashish Nehra and Mohit Sharma among others. The first phase of the IPL season was held in the UAE with the second phase returning to India, but the Super Kings' home matches were shifted from Chennai to Ranchi due to a dispute between the Government of Tamil Nadu and the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association. The Super Kings started the season with eight wins in their first ten matches before suffering from a dip in form towards the end of the regular season. The team recovered to finish third in the points table to qualify for the playoffs.

In the first match, the Super Kings beat the defending champions Mumbai Indians. The team finished seventh overall in the group stage points table and failed to make it to the playoffs for the first time. The team's captain Dhoni drew criticism from the supporters over his form and team selection. The franchise released many of the players including Chawla, Vijay and Kedar Jadhav before the player auction for the 2021 season.\n\n\nFurther success and transition (2021–2024)\nIn the 2021 player auction, the Super Kings bought Cheteshwar Pujara, Krishnappa Gowtham and Moeen Ali and traded in Robin Uthappa from the Rajasthan Royals.

On 21 March 2024, Dhoni handed over the captaincy of the team to Ruturaj Gaikwad. In the group stage, the Super Kings finished with 14 points from seven wins from 14 matches. The team was tied with three other teams in the competition for the fourth and final play-off spot but finished fifth behind the Royal Challengers Bangalore on net run rate after the loss to the same team in its final group match.

The stadium is often referred to as \"Fortress Chepauk\" and \"Lions' den\".\nIn 2014, the Super Kings played their home matches at the JSCA International Cricket Stadium at Ranchi due to a dispute with the Government of Tamil Nadu regarding the usage of three stands at the Chepauk stadium. In 2018, the team played six of its home games at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune after members of some of the political parties staged protests outside the Chepauk stadium and the Tamil Nadu Police indicated their inability to provide security for the subsequent matches.\n\n\nBrand\nThe Super Kings has consistently been named amongst the most valuable sporting franchises in India.

The deal was renewed in 2011 for ₹850 million (US$10 million), then the most expensive sponsorship deal in the IPL. Muthoot Group was the principal shirt sponsor from 2018 to 2020 after which Myntra took over as the principal shirt sponsor for the 2021 season.\nIn 2022, tyre maker TVS Eurogrip signed up with the franchise as the principal shirt sponsor on a three-year deal worth over ₹1 billion (US$12 million).

They are the two most successful IPL teams with five titles each. The two sides have met each other at the final of the IPL four times, with Mumbai winning thrice and Chennai winning once.\n\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru rivalry\nThe rivalry between the Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru is called the \"Southern derby\" or \"Kaveri derby\" (from the Kaveri River and the water dispute between the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu). The Super Kings have won 22 of the 36 matches between the teams, and have beaten the Royal Challengers in the only meeting between the two teams in an IPL final in 2011. At its home ground in Chennai, the Super Kings have a superior record, and have lost only twice to the Royal Challengers, in 2008 and 2025.\n\n\nOwnership and finances\nWhen the IPL was launched in 2008, the Chennai franchise was sold to the India Cements for $91 million, making it the fourth most expensive team in the league. N. Srinivasan, who was then the treasurer and vice-chairman of the BCCI, became the de facto owner of the Super Kings as the managing director of India Cements. In September 2008, former BCCI President A. C. Muthiah wrote to then BCCI President citing the BCCI regulations, which prevented any administrator from holding commercial interests in the matches conducted by the board. Subsequently, the regulations were amended by the BCCI to exclude the IPL and a case was filed against the same in the Madras High Court. In 2013, he Muthiah moved to the Supreme Court to stop Srinivasan from taking over as the President of BCCI, which was rejected and Srinivasan was elected as the President of BCCI. In a subsequent decision announced on 22 January 2015, the Supreme Court stuck down the 2008 amendment to the BCCI constitution that allowed board officials to have a commercial interest in the IPL. As a result, the Super Kings franchise was transferred to a separate entity named Chennai Super Kings Cricket Limited.\nAs of 2021, about 30% of the franchise is owned by the trustees and shareholders of India Cements. The Super Kings recorded revenues of ₹4.18 billion (US$49 million) with a net profit of ₹1.11 billion (US$13 million) for FY 2018–19. In the FY 2020–21, the revenue dropped to ₹2.54 billion (US$30 million) with a net profit of ₹402 million (US$4.8 million). The franchise generates revenues from broadcasting deals, match day tickets, in-stadium advertising and merchandise sales. Majority of the revenue comes from broadcasting rights which contributes about 60% of the total revenue, followed by around 20% from sponsorship deals and about 10-15% from ticket sales.\n\n\nPlayers\n\n\nCurrent squad\nPlayers with international caps in bold.\n\n\nCaptains\n\nDhoni led the team from 2008 to 2023 and is one of the most successful captains in the IPL, having led the Super Kings to ten finals of which the team has won five. In 2022, Jadeja was appointed as the captain succeeding Dhoni but handed the captaincy back to Dhoni after a poor start to the IPL season. Gaikwad was appointed as the captain before the start of the 2024 IPL season.
