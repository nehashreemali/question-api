  "extract": "Rafael \"Rafa\" Nadal Parera, 1st Marquess of Llevant de Mallorca (born 3 June 1986), is a Spanish former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 209 weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. Nadal won 92 ATP Tour singles titles, with 22 major titles—including a record 14 French Open titles—as well as 36 Masters titles and an Olympic gold medal. Nadal is one of three men to complete the career Golden Slam in singles. His 81 consecutive wins on clay constitute the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era.\nFor nearly two decades, Nadal was a leading figure in men's tennis, alongside Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, collectively known as the Big Three. Early in his career, Nadal became one of the most successful teenagers in ATP Tour history, reaching No. 2 in the world and winning 16 titles before turning 20, including his first major title at the 2005 French Open. Nadal became the world No. 1 for the first time in 2008 after defeating Federer in an historic Wimbledon final, his first major championship off clay. He followed with an Olympic singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. By defeating Djokovic in the 2010 US Open final, Nadal became the youngest man in the Open Era to achieve the career Grand Slam at 24, and the first man to win majors on three different surfaces in the same year.\nNadal won major singles titles in 10 consecutive years from 2005 to 2014, and again in a four-year span from 2017 to 2020. He also won 11 doubles titles during his career, including an Olympic gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Nadal surpassed his joint-record with Djokovic and Federer for the most Grand Slam men's singles titles at the 2022 Australian Open, and became one of four men in history to complete the double career Grand Slam in singles. Nadal retired from the sport after playing for Spain in the 2024 Davis Cup Finals.\nAs a left-handed player, one of Nadal's main strengths was his forehand, delivered with heavy topspin. He frequently ranked among the tour leaders in return games, return points, and break points won. His game was especially well-suited for clay courts, on which came 63 of his 92 singles titles. Nadal won the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award five times and was the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2011 and 2021. Time named Nadal one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2022. Representing Spain, he won two Olympic gold medals, and led the nation to five Davis Cup titles. Nadal has also opened a tennis academy in Mallorca, and is an active philanthropist.\n\n\nEarly life\nRafael Nadal Parera was born on 3 June 1986 in Manacor on the island of Mallorca, Spain, to Ana María Parera Femenías and Sebastián Nadal Homar. His father is a businessman who owns an insurance company, a glass and window company, and a restaurant. His mother owned a perfume shop but gave it up to raise Nadal and his younger sister, María Isabel. One of his uncles, Miguel Ángel Nadal, is a retired professional footballer who played for RCD Mallorca, FC Barcelona, and the Spanish national team. As a child, he idolized Ronaldo, and was given access through his uncle to the Barcelona team dressing room to have a photo taken with the Brazilian. Another uncle, tennis coach Toni Nadal, introduced him to tennis when he was three years old.\nNadal started to play tennis at the Manacor Tennis Club, where Toni worked as a coach, hitting his first few shots with his uncle. At this stage Nadal's passion was football, which he often played on the streets of Manacor with his friends. He began to play tennis more regularly when he was five. Toni quickly realized that his young nephew had both the passion and talent to be a serious player. Nadal often played tennis in a group, but Toni singled him out during sessions, shouting at him instead of the other kids, and making him pick up the balls and sweep the courts. In his 2011 autobiography, he admitted fearing Toni and dreading solo practice sessions with him. Nadal admitted he sometimes returned home from tennis lessons crying.\nAt age 8, Nadal won an under-12 regional tennis championship while also being a promising football player. This victory inspired Toni to train Nadal more intensively. After studying Nadal's two-handed forehand, Toni encouraged him to play left-handed for a natural advantage on the tennis court. The transition was purportedly difficult for Nadal, but he was coached through the change by his uncle, who instructed him to try it for 20 minutes per day before gradually increasing that time until he was fully adjusted.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\n1997–2000: Juniors\nNadal won the Spanish junior championships in 1997 and 1998, beating Ricardo Villacorta and Marcel Granollers respectively. In 1998 Nadal reached the final of the U14 Spanish championship at the age of 12, a feat that remains unmatched, losing to Juan Sanchez de Luna in straight sets. In late 1998, Nadal won the season-ending U12 Junior Masters at Stuttgart, beating future world No. 5 Kevin Anderson in the final.\nIn February 1998, Nadal competed outside Spain for the first time and won the Open Super 12, an unofficial world championship for U12 players in Auray. He beat 1997 winner Jamie Murray in the final. At the time, Nadal was torn between football and tennis, partly because his uncle Miguel Ángel was preparing to compete in the 1998 FIFA World Cup with Spain. Nadal said winning the Auray tournament helped him make the decision to \"opt for tennis and try an international career\". In 1998, when Nadal was runner-up in the U14 event Spanish championship, he was still playing football. Nadal's father insisted he choose between football and tennis to so his schoolwork wouldn't suffer, leading Nadal to quit football.\nIn 1999, the 12-year-old Nadal was playing in the U14 circuit of the ETA Junior Tour (now the Tennis Europe Junior Tour), winning the Tim Essonne, and finishing the year at No. 69. In 2000, Nadal dominated the U14 circuit, winning Les Petits As in Tarbes, beating Julien Gely in the final, and the European Junior Masters in Prato. On the day he turned 14, Nadal won the Sport Goofy Trophy in Getxo, beating Granollers in the final. In July, Nadal won the U14 Spanish championships, beating his friend and training partner Tomeu Salvá in the final, despite breaking a finger on his left hand during the first round. As a member of the Spanish national team, Nadal won the 2000 ITF World Junior Championship for players under 14, winning his matches in both singles and doubles (paired with Marcel Granollers) in a 3–0 win over Russia. Nadal ended 2000 at No. 5 of the ETA rankings for U14s.\nHis junior results secured Nadal a tennis scholarship in Barcelona, and the Spanish tennis federation requested that Nadal move to Barcelona to continue his tennis training. His family turned down this request, partly because they feared his education would suffer, but also because Toni said, \"I don't want to believe that you have to go to America or other places to be a good athlete. You can do it from your home.\" Nadal already was by then practicing three times a week at Palma with former World No. 1 Carlos Moyá, who later became Nadal's mentor and confidant, and whom Nadal beat in 2000, at the time still a Top-10 player, in an exhibition match. The decision to stay home meant less financial support from the federation; instead, Nadal's father covered the costs.\n\n\n2001–2002: Start of professional career\nNadal turned professional at the beginning of 2001, at the age of 14. He reached the semi-finals of the junior singles event at Wimbledon and helped Spain defeat the US in the final of the Junior Davis Cup.\nIn early 2001, aged 14, Nadal began playing the qualifying draws of professional tournaments. In May 2001, he defeated former Grand Slam tournament champion Pat Cash in a clay-court exhibition match. Nadal made his pro debut in the main draw at the Futures in Madrid on 11 September 2001, wasting 13 match points against Guillermo Platel-Varas in the opening round. He received a wild card into the main draw of the Challenger in Seville, his first Challenger tournament, and beat world No. 751 Israel Matos Gil 6–4 6–4 to claim his first pro win and earn the first five ATP points of his career to become world No. 1002. At age 15, Nadal ended 2001 as the world No. 811.\nIn 2002, Nadal, then ranked No. 762, received a wild card to the ATP 250 event on his home island of Mallorca, where on 29 April, Nadal won his first ATP match by defeating No. 81 Ramón Delgado, and became the ninth player in the Open Era to do so before the age of 16. He did not compete for two months as he studied for school exams and missed the junior French Open in June. At junior Wimbledon, he reached the semi-finals before losing to Lamine Ouahab. Nadal then won six of the nine Futures events he entered from July until December, including 5 on clay and 1 on hard courts. Nadal finished 2002 with a Futures record of 40–9 in singles and 10–9 in doubles. In October, Nadal defeated No. 76 Albert Montañés in the quarterfinals of a Challenger at Barcelona, before losing to Albert Portas in the semi-finals. Nadal ended 2002 as the world No. 199.\n\n\n2003: First ATP title and ascending to the top 50\nNadal continued his ascent in early 2003, reaching the finals of Challengers at Hamburg, Cherbourg and Cagliari, and winning at Barletta. He scored a total of 19 Challenger wins in the first three months of the season to find himself inside the Top 150. He then qualified for his second career ATP event, the Monte Carlo Masters, where in the second round he beat the 2002 French Open champion Albert Costa, then ranked No. 7 (his first top 10 career win) and he entered the world's top 100. Nadal reached his fifth Challenger final of the year in Aix-en-Provence, which he lost to Mariano Puerta. In May, 16-year-old Nadal entered his second Masters event at Hamburg, where he upset No. 4 Carlos Moyá before losing to future French Open Champion Gaston Gaudio in round three. Nadal postponed his French Open debut after injuring his elbow in a fall while training. He then qualified directly to Wimbledon, having never contested in a major qualifying event before. In his major main draw debut in Wimbledon, Nadal defeated Mario Ančić, and reached the third round to become the youngest man to do so since Boris Becker in 1984.\nAt Umag, Nadal lost to Moyá in the semi-finals. This was Nadal's only loss at a clay-court semi-final for the next 12 years, as he then began a streak of 52 consecutive wins in semi-final matches on clay that ended at the 2015 Rio Open. Nadal won his first ATP title (doubles or singles) at Umag, partnering Álex López Morón to beat Todd Perry and Thomas Shimada in the final. Nadal won his second Challenger title of the year in August at Segovia, thus entering the top 50 and winning the ATP Newcomer of the Year Award.\nAt the US Open, Nadal lost in round two to Younes El Aynaoui. In September, Nadal entered the final Challenger event of his career, on hard courts in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, retiring with an injury against Richard Gasquet, who never defeated Nadal again. Nadal finished the year ranked as the world No. 49.\n\n\n2004: Davis Cup title\nNadal won Chennai Open doubles, with Tommy Robredo defeating Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram in the final; Nadal's second doubles title and first on hard courts. In singles, Nadal had his 5th consecutive loss after a first round exit to Thierry Ascione; this remains the worst losing streak of his career. At Auckland he reached the first ATP final of his career, which he lost to Dominik Hrbatý. Nadal reached the third round of the Australian Open, where he lost in straight sets to former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt. Ranked No. 34, Nadal faced No. 1 Roger Federer for the first time in the third round of the Miami Open, winning in straight sets before losing to Fernando González in the fourth round.\nAt Estoril, Nadal suffered a stress fracture in his left ankle during his round of 16 victory over Richard Gasquet, causing him to miss 3 months of play, the French Open, and Wimbledon. He won his first ATP singles title at the Prokom Open by defeating No. 105 José Acasuso in the final, but won hardly any other match on the tour. At the US Open, Nadal lost to defending champion Andy Roddick in the second round. In the doubles he and Robredo upset the No. 4 seeds in the third round and reached the semi-finals; Nadal's best performance in a grand slam doubles event.\nIn the 2004 Davis Cup final, 18-year-old Nadal beat world No. 2 Andy Roddick on clay in Spain to help his nation clinch the title over the United States. In doing so at 18 years and six months of age, he became the youngest player to register a singles victory in a Davis Cup final for a winning nation. Nadal finished the year ranked No. 51, mainly because he missed most of the clay court season.\n\n\n2005: First major title\n\n2005 started with a doubles title alongside Albert Costa at the Qatar Open, defeating Andrei Pavel and Mikhail Youzhny in the final. At the 2005 Australian Open, Nadal lost in the fourth round to eventual runner-up Lleyton Hewitt. Two months later, he reached the final of the 2005 Miami Masters, but was defeated by No. 1 Roger Federer.\nHe dominated the spring clay-court season. He won 24 consecutive singles matches, breaking Andre Agassi's Open Era record of consecutive match wins for a male teenager. Nadal won the Torneo Conde de Godó in Barcelona defeating the former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final; which meant he was ranked in the top 10 for the first time in his career. He then beat 2004 French Open runner-up Guillermo Coria in the finals of the 2005 Monte Carlo Masters and the 2005 Italian Open. These victories raised his ranking to world No. 5 and made him one of the favorites at his career-first French Open. On his 19th birthday, Nadal defeated Federer in the French Open semi-finals, being one of only four players to defeat him that year. Then he defeated Mariano Puerta in the final, becoming the second man to win the French Open on his first attempt. He also became the first male teenager to win a major singles title since Pete Sampras won the 1990 US Open at age 19. His ranking rose to No. 3.\nThree days later, Nadal's 24-match winning streak was snapped in the first round on grass at Halle, Germany, where he lost to No. 147 Alexander Waske.  He then lost in the second round of 2005 Wimbledon to No. 69 Gilles Müller. Following his Wimbledon loss, Nadal won 16 consecutive matches and three consecutive tournaments, the Swedish Open, Stuttgart Open, and the Canada Masters, defeating Agassi in the final of the latter to win the first hardcourt title of his career and to bring his ranking to No. 2 on 25 July 2005, where he remained for the next three years behind Roger Federer. His winning streak ended in the first round of the Cincinnati Open at the hands of Tomáš Berdych. Nadal was seeded second at the 2005 US Open, but was upset in the third round by No. 49 James Blake.\nIn September, he defeated Coria in the final of the China Open in Beijing and won both of his Davis Cup matches against Italy. In October, he won his fourth Masters title of the year, against Ivan Ljubičić at the 2005 Madrid Masters, his biggest indoor title to this day. A foot injury prevented him from competing in the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup.\nNadal (with 11 titles) broke Mats Wilander's previous teenage season record of nine in 1983. Nadal was awarded ATP Most Improved Player of the Year award.\n\n\n2006: Second French Open title\n\nNadal missed the Australian Open because of a foot injury. In February, he lost in the semi-finals of Marseille. Two weeks later, he handed Roger Federer his first loss of the year in the final of the Dubai Open, ending Federer's 56-match hard court winning streak. Nadal was then upset in the semi-finals of Indian Wells by James Blake, and in the second round of Miami by Carlos Moyá.\n\nNadal beat Federer in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters and Tommy Robredo in the Barcelona final. He won the Italian Open beating Federer in a fifth-set tiebreak in the final, after saving two match points, and equaled Björn Borg's tally of 16 ATP titles won as a teenager. At five hours and five minutes, this was the longest match Federer and Nadal ever contested and it is considered to be where their rivalry began in earnest. The New York Times compared it to the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing. Nadal then broke Argentinian Guillermo Vilas's 29-year male record of 53 consecutive clay-court match victories by beating Robin Söderling in the first round of the French Open. Nadal beat Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals, the first-ever meeting of their historic rivalry.

During the round-robin stage of the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup, Nadal lost to James Blake but defeated Nikolay Davydenko and Robredo.

This was Nadal's third loss in nine career matches with Federer.\nNadal went on to become the first player since Andre Agassi in 1994–95 to finish the year ranked No. 2 in consecutive years.\n\n\n2007: Third French Open title\n\nAt the Australian Open, Nadal lost in the quarterfinals to eventual runner-up Fernando González.

Nadal entered the final on a 23-match winning streak, including his first career grass-court title at Queen's. Unlike their previous two Wimbledon finals, Federer was not the prohibitive favorite, and many analysts picked Nadal to win. At 4 hours and 48 minutes, they played the longest final (in terms of time on court, surpassed in 2019) in Wimbledon history, and because of rain delays, Nadal won the fifth set 9–7 in near-darkness. The match was widely lauded as the greatest Wimbledon final ever, with many tennis critics calling it the greatest match in tennis history.\nBy winning Wimbledon, Nadal became the third man in the Open Era to win both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year, as well as the second Spaniard to win Wimbledon.

Exhausted, Nadal lost the final to Roger Federer. This was Nadal's first defeat on clay in 33 matches and his first loss to Federer since the semi-finals of the 2007 Tennis Masters Cup.\nBy beating Marcos Daniel in the first round of the French Open, Nadal broke Björn Borg's 28-year male record of 28 consecutive victories at the French Open, and he then broke Chris Evert's overall record of 29 by beating Teymuraz Gabashvili in round two. This run came to an end on 31 May 2009, when Nadal was upset by the eventual runner-up, Robin Söderling in the 4th round. This was Nadal's first loss at the French Open. Former champion Mats Wilander stated after the match that \"Everybody's in a state of shock, I would think. At some point, Nadal was going to lose.

Nadal called it \"one of the toughest moments in my career\".\nNadal then reached the semi-finals of both the Indian Wells, where he was beaten by Federer, and Miami, where he withdrew because of knee problems. At Monte Carlo, Nadal did not lose a set en route to the title to become the first man in the Open Era to win the same tournament eight consecutive times. In the final, he defeated No. 1 Novak Djokovic to end a streak of seven straight final losses to him. This was the most lopsided of all their matches, as Nadal only lost four games. Nadal then beat David Ferrer in a three-set final to clinch his seventh title in eight years at Barcelona. At Madrid, Nadal lost to Fernando Verdasco, whom he held a 13–0 record against. He criticized the new blue clay and threatened to skip future events if the surface wasn't changed back to red clay, a sentiment echoed by several players, including Novak Djokovic. He beat Djokovic in a tight straight-set final at the Italian Open.\nAt the French Open, Nadal won his semi-final match against Ferrer to set up another final against Novak Djokovic. This marked only the second time in tennis history (after Serena and Venus Williams between the 2002 French Open and the 2003 Australian Open), two players played four consecutive major singles finals against each other. After rain delays pushed the conclusion of the final into a second day, Nadal emerged victorious in four sets. Nadal became the most successful male player at the French Open (overtaking Borg) with seven titles. Nadal lost a total of only three sets in the 2012 clay court season.\nAs a warm-up ahead of Wimbledon, Nadal played in Halle, losing to Philipp Kohlschreiber in the quarterfinals.

His semi-final match against Djokovic has been called one of the greatest clay court matches ever, with Nadal rallying from a break down in the fifth set to win after 4 hours and 37 minutes. This was only the second time Nadal had been pushed to five sets at the French Open (the first was against John Isner in the first round in 2011). This victory meant that since returning from seven months out due to injury, Nadal had reached eight consecutive finals, won 7 titles, and compiled a 43–2 record in 2013. However, Nadal then lost his first-round match at Wimbledon in straight sets to Steve Darcis, his first loss in the first round of a major.

They held the top two rankings on the ATP Tour from July 2005 to 14 August 2009, and again from 11 September 2017 to 15 October 2018. They are the only pair of men to be consistently ranked in the Top 2 for four years continuously (from July 2005 to August 2009).

He appeared in the Top 10 of the ATP rankings consecutively from April 2005 to March 2023 – a record spanning 912 weeks. He stands alone in the Open Era as the player with the most clay court titles (63), consisting of an all-time record 14 French Open titles, 12 Barcelona Open titles, 11 Monte-Carlo Masters titles, and 10 Italian Open titles. His 14 French Open titles are a record at any single tournament, and he holds the open era records for the longest single-surface win streak in matches (81 on clay) and in sets (50 on clay). Nadal holds the men's all-time records for the most majors won without losing a set (4), the most match wins at a single major (112 at the French Open), and the highest match-winning percentage at clay court majors (96.6%), among many others. Nadal's dominance on clay is reflected by his honorific title as the \"King of Clay\", and he is widely regarded as the greatest clay-court player in history. Nadal is considered by many to be the greatest player in tennis history.\nNadal is one of three men, along with Agassi and Djokovic, to win the Olympic gold medal as well as the four majors in singles in his career, a feat known as a Career Golden Slam. He is the only male player in history to complete the Career Grand Slam and win an Olympic gold medal in both singles and doubles. He is one of four men in history, along with Roy Emerson, Rod Laver and Djokovic, to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles.\nAmong numerous career accolades, Nadal was the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2011 and 2021, and was 2010 BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year. He is an honorary recipient of the Grand Cross of Royal Order of Sports Merit, Grand Cross of Order of the Second of May, the Grand Cross of Naval Merit, the Princess of Asturias Award, and the Medal of the City of Paris. He was ranked as one of the world's highest-paid athletes by Forbes magazine in 2014 and named among the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2022.\nIn 2019, former world No. 1 and 1995 French Open champion Thomas Muster stated: \"Rafael Nadal is the best clay-court player ever\". Former world No. 1 Carlos Moyá stated in 2010 that Nadal was \"one of the greatest ever. But he is on his way to become, who knows, maybe the greatest\". Former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero: \"Rafa is the king of knowing how to adapt to any situation in the match\". Former world No. 1 and rival Novak Djokovic: \"Our encounters have made me the player I am today\". Former world No. 1 and rival Roger Federer: \"I have always had the utmost respect for my friend Rafa as a person and as a champion. I believe we have pushed each other to become better players\".\nNadal played an instrumental role in the sport's revival, ushering in a Golden Age of tennis, which saw increased interest and higher revenues across tennis venues globally. His rivalries with Djokovic and Federer are widely considered by players, coaches, and pundits to be among the greatest rivalries in sports history.\n\n\nPlayer profile\n\n\nPlaying style\nNadal generally played an aggressive, behind-the-baseline game based on heavy topspin groundstrokes, consistency and shrewd court coverage; an aggressive counterpuncher. \n\nKnown for his athleticism and speed around the court in his 20s, Nadal has been called \"the best defender in tennis\". who hit well on the run, constructing winning plays from seemingly defensive positions. He also played very fine dropshots, which worked well because his heavy topspin often forced opponents to the back of the court.\nNadal employed a semi-western grip forehand, often with a \"lasso-whip\" follow-through, where his left arm hit through the ball and finished above his left shoulder. Nadal's forehand allowed him to hit shots with heavy topspin – more so than his contemporaries.\nSan Francisco tennis researcher John Yandell used a high-speed video camera and special software to count the average number of revolutions of a tennis ball hit full force by Nadal. Yandell concluded:\n\nThe first guys we did were Sampras and Agassi. They were hitting forehands that in general were spinning about 1,800 to 1,900 revolutions per minute. Federer is hitting with an amazing amount of spin, too, right? 2,700 revolutions per minute. Well, we measured one forehand Nadal hit at 4,900. His average was 3,200.\nWhile Nadal's shots tended to land short of the baseline, the characteristically high bounces his forehands achieved tended to mitigate the advantage an opponent would normally gain from capitalizing on a short ball. Although his forehand was based on heavy topspin, he hit the ball deep and flat with a more orthodox follow through for clean winners, but instead of being admired for his finesse and angles, it was the brutality of his groundstrokes that caught the public eye.\nNadal's serve was considered a weak point in his game, although his high number of first-serve points won and break points saved allowed him to consistently compete for and win major titles on faster surfaces. Before the 2010 US Open, he altered his service motion. He arrived in the trophy pose earlier, pulled the racket lower during the trophy pose and modified his service grip to a more continental one, He increased his average speed by around 10 mph during the 2010 US Open, maxing out at 135 mph (217 km/h), allowing him to win more free points on his serve. After the 2010 US Open, Nadal's serve speed dropped to previous levels and was again cited as in need of improvement. From 2019 onwards, several analysts praised Nadal's improvement on the serve, noting the speed of his serve had increased.\nNadal, a clay court maestro, was also successful on hard courts. However, Nadal himself admitted that playing a lot on them is tiring and takes a physical toll on ATP Tour players, so he repeatedly requested for a reevaluated tour schedule featuring fewer hard court tournaments and increasing the weeks of rest.\nEarly in his career some questioned his longevity in the sport, citing his build and playing style as conducive to injury. After winning the 2010 US Open, former world No. 1 Pete Sampras stated: \"The only question with Rafa is physically how much his body can handle the pounding with how hard he works for every point. You just watch him play, the kid is relentless\". This \"longevity\" narrative was proven inaccurate, and pundits later admired his resilience to come back from devastating injuries and his ability to play with physical pain.\n\n\nAttitude and demeanor\n\nDespite his success, his uncle Toni ensured that Nadal remained as normal, modest, and down to earth as possible and believed these qualities had a tremendous impact on his results and motivation. He rarely if ever touted his achievements, refused to put down his rivals, and lingered after matches and practices to sign autographs. For instance, in 2007, Nadal would often interrupt his training sessions on the public courts of Manacor, just to hit a few balls with fans and foreign tourists that had asked him to, even though they were not very good, and even against his uncle Toni’s wishes.\nNadal was also noted for his visceral delight in competing, whether he won or lost. He also had a rare philosophical approach to tennis and life that one sportswriter described as a \"model of humility, empathy, and perspective\".\nNadal was known for his on-court rituals including specific bodily movements and the positioning of items courtside. At changeovers, he always waited until his opponent crossed the net, refused to step on the lines, and lined up his drinks bottles in precise positions near his chair, labels always facing out, before stepping back into action. His water-bottle routine was so well-known that when they fell over during a match at the 2015 Australian Open, a ball boy dashed over to return the bottles to their upright position, with the labels facing the court as Nadal had intended. Nadal explained that such rituals were meant to work as a psychological mechanism to help him stay calm in stressful situations.\nThere was a pattern to the way he approached a serve. He usually took three balls, examined them, discarded one, shook the strands of hair that were not corralled by his headband out of his eyes, and then served. Nadal's extensive time taken between points received criticism from other players including Roger Federer and Denis Shapovalov, with the latter wanting Nadal to be given a code violation for pushing the 25-second serve clock to the limit, stating that he was being given preferential treatment because of his status in the game.\n\n\nCoaching and personal team\nNadal's first and most important coach was his uncle Toni Nadal, who coached him from 1990 to 2017 (aged 4 to 31). Though strong physically as a player, Toni Nadal struggled to be aggressive with his forehand and possessed no big shots. Along with working on the mental and physical sides, he ensured that his nephew developed a good technical, all-round aggressive game, became competent at the net, and developed his forehand into a weapon.\nAged 12, Nadal began attending the Balearic Islands training centre 50 kilometers away from Manacor in Palma. He and his uncle trained there three times a week, so that Nadal could train with the best boys in the Balearic Islands. There, he was trained along with his uncle Toni, by Toni Colom, who travelled with Nadal at mainly Futures events for the next four years, between 1999 and 2003. Colom explained that he \"was traveling to those tournaments because I had a bigger availability of traveling [than Toni] and not because I was more experienced\". After 2005, Nadal left the structure of the Balearic School and created his own team.\nNadal worked with the same team from 2006 to 2017, which consisted of members from his family and professional staff, whom Nadal also considered his family. Besides Toni, the first members of his team were Joan Forcades, Nadal's instructor since childhood, and doctor Ángel Ruiz Cotorro. Cotorro, who also worked with Juan Martín del Potro and Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, helped him play after facing injuries and his suggestions were pivotal to his game. Nadal said of his doctor that: \"I trust Dr. Cotorro with my life\". Forcades was the lead fitness expert for Nadal and developed his training program.\nToni has described his coaching style as 'hard', saying that he occasionally put too much pressure on Nadal, but that he did so because he wanted him to succeed. Together, they won 16 major titles between 2005 and 2017, making them the second most successful tennis coach-player partnership only behind Marián Vajda and Novak Djokovic.\nCarlos Costa was Nadal's agent from 2005. In 2006, Costa and Nadal's father convinced Benito Pérez Barbadillo, who had been working as the press officer of the ATP since the late 1990s, to open his own company (B1PR) to work with them as Nadal's communications director (PR manager). Nadal then hired physiotherapist Rafael Maymó, who designed his physical preparation with Forcades and who was one of Nadal's closest friends, thus also acting as a psychologist.\nAfter signing his new coach Carlos Moyá in December 2016, Nadal's game style acquired a more offensive approach. Under Moyá's direction, Nadal improved his serve, and incorporated serve-and-volley as a surprise tactic in some of his matches. Moyá, who has known Nadal since he was 12, was more a friend than a coach, and when he realized that Nadal was going through a bad time, he left his duty as a coach and acted like a friend with whom Nadal could speak to.\nFrancisco Roig, who was hired by Nadal in 2005, acted as the alternate coach.\n\n\nEquipment and apparel\n\nNike served as Nadal's clothing and shoe sponsor. Nadal's signature on-court attire entailed a variety of sleeveless shirts paired with 3/4 length capri pants. For the 2009 season, Nadal adopted more-traditional on-court apparel. Nike encouraged Nadal to update his look in order to reflect his new status as the sport's top player at that time. In 2009, Nadal played matches in a polo shirt specifically designed for him by Nike, paired with shorts cut above the knee. Nadal wore Nike's Air CourtBallistec 2.3 tennis shoes, with various customizations throughout the season, including his nickname \"Rafa\" on the right shoe and a stylized bull logo on the left.\nNadal used an AeroPro Drive racquet with a 4+1⁄4-inch L2 grip. As of the 2010 season, Nadal's racquets were painted to resemble the Babolat AeroPro Drive with Cortex GT racquet in order to market a current model that Babolat sold. Nadal used no replacement grip, and instead wrapped two overgrips around the handle. He used Duralast 15L strings until the 2010 season, when he switched to Babolat's new, black-colored, RPM Blast string. Nadal's rackets were always strung at 55 lb (25 kg), regardless of which surface or conditions he played on.\n\n\nOff the court\n\n\nIn popular culture\nNadal's autobiography, Rafa, written with John Carlin, was published in 2011.\nIn February 2010, Rafael Nadal was featured in the music video for Shakira's \"Gypsy\". In 2016, Nadal was one of many celebrities appearing in the music video for RedOne's \"Don't You Need Somebody\".\nIn 2018, Nadal was featured in a new ad for the 2018 tennis game Mario Tennis Aces.\nNadal appeared in the 2024 documentary Federer: Twelve Final Days about Roger Federer's final tournament before his retirement, the 2022 Laver Cup.\n\n\nTributes and honors\n\nIn April 2017, the centre court of the Barcelona Open was named Pista Rafa Nadal. In 2021, prior to the tournament, the French Open paid tribute to Nadal by installing a statue at Stade Roland Garros, created by Spanish sculptor Jordi Díez Fernández. 128036 Rafaelnadal is an asteroid discovered in 2003 and named after Nadal.\nAt both the London and Rio Olympic Games, Nadal was chosen as Spain's flag bearer. Although he had to forfeit the role in 2012 due to injury, he carried the flag during the opening ceremony of the 2016 Games.\nIn 2025, on the first day of the 2025 French Open, a new plaque commemorating Rafael Nadal's 14 Roland Garros trophies was unveiled on the Court Philippe Chatrier stadium's soil. The ceremony occurred in the presence of Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray, who came to pay tribute to Nadal's career.\nThe following month, Nadal was created Marquess of Llevant de Mallorca by King Felipe VI, becoming a member of Spanish nobility. As a marquess, he is entitled to the style of \"The Most Illustrious\", however, as a knight grand cross of some orders such as the Royal Order of Sports Merit and the Grand Cross of Naval Merit, he receives the higher treatment of \"The Most Excellent\".\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn November 2007, Nadal launched the nonprofit Fundación Rafa Nadal. The foundation was created to help disadvantaged children and teenagers, offering them opportunities through sports. His wife María Perelló is the director of the foundation.\nIn response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Nadal played in a special charity event alongside fellow top tennis players during the 2010 Australian Open called Hit for Haiti, with proceeds going to Haiti earthquake victims. He participated in a follow-up charity exhibition during the 2010 Indian Wells Open. In late 2010, Nadal played his rival Roger Federer in the Match for Africa exhibitions for the Roger Federer Foundation and the Rafa Nadal Foundation. The first match took place in Zürich on 21 December, and was won by Federer, while the following match was played in Madrid, and was won by Nadal.\nDuring the Majorca flood in October 2018, Nadal, who was recovering from injury at home in Majorca, opened his tennis academy centre to the victims. One day after the flood he worked personally with some friends to help the victims, being photographed cleaning up once the flood waters had receded. Later, Nadal donated €1 million for rebuilding Sant Llorenç des Cardassar, the most affected town. Nadal also organized other charitable activities to help repair the damage of the disaster, such as the Olazábal & Nadal charity golf tournament.\nTo combat the ill-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nadal joined with Pau Gasol and the Red Cross in June to help raise 11 million euros. In 2020, the Fundación Rafa Nadal pledged to support the Food Bank of Mallorca, announcing that it would aim to collect 3,000 kg of food to support 25,000 individuals in Mallorca.\nOn 6 April 2023, the Fundación Rafa Nadal announced that they would partner with UNESCO through its Fit for Life project, a sport-based flagship program designed to tackle physical inactivity, such as accelerating the recovery from COVID-19, mental health issues, and inequality. In 2024, The Rafa Nadal Foundation received the Laureus Sport for Good Award at the Laureus World Sports Awards 2024.\nNadal supports or has supported other charities, such as City Harvest, Elton John AIDS Foundation, Laureus Sport for Good Foundation and Small Steps Project. Nadal was awarded the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year award for 2011.\n\n\nSponsorships and endorsements\nNadal was sponsored by Kia Motors since 2006. He appeared in advertising campaigns for Kia as a global ambassador for the company.\nHe became the face of Lanvin's L'Homme Sport cologne in April 2009. Nadal was the international ambassador for Quely, a biscuit company from his native Mallorca. In 2010, luxury watchmaker Richard Mille announced that he had developed an ultra-light wristwatch in collaboration with Nadal.\nNadal was the face of Emporio Armani Underwear and Armani Jeans for the spring/summer 2011 collection. This was the first time that the label had chosen a tennis player for the job.\nIn June 2012, Nadal joined the group of sports endorsers of the PokerStars online poker cardroom. Nadal won a charity poker tournament against retired Brazilian football player Ronaldo in 2014.\nIn August 2023, Nadal signed up as the brand ambassador for the Indian IT major Infosys.\n\n\nRafa Nadal Sports Centre\nNadal owns and trained at the Rafa Nadal Sports Centre (40,000 m2, 430,000 sq ft) in his hometown of Manacor, Mallorca. The centre houses the Rafa Nadal Academy, where the American International School of Mallorca is located. The academy is used by both young Spanish tennis players as well as players from other countries. For instance, in 2017, the Australian tennis federation agreed to partner with Nadal's Academy to allow their players use it as their European training base. Nadal's coach and uncle Toni Nadal is the head of the academy, his agent Carlos Costa is the head of business development, and fellow Majorcan Carlos Moyá is involved as a technical director.\nIn 2021, a four-episode series about the Rafa Nadal Academy was aired on Amazon Prime and Movistar and was broadcast in 244 countries. Nadal also owns and operates three other similar facilities: the Rafa Nadal Academy Kuwait, the Rafa Nadal Tennis Centre Mexico and the Rafa Nadal Tennis Centre Greece. The Mexico and Greece Centres opened in 2019 and the Kuwait Academy opened in 2020.\nAs of 2024, Nadal will promote tennis in Saudi Arabia and open a Rafa Nadal Academy there.\n\n\nInvolvement in football and other sports\nNadal is an avid football fan and his favorite clubs are RCD Mallorca and Real Madrid CF, stating \"when my uncle (Miguel Ángel) was playing for Barcelona, we wanted Barcelona to win. Before that, my whole family was for Real Madrid. After my uncle left the Barcelona team, then we're all for the Real Madrid again. I have got nothing against Barcelona, but I prefer Real Madrid to win\". He is a fervent supporter of the Spanish national team, and he was one of six people not affiliated with the team or the national federation allowed to enter the team's locker room following Spain's victory in the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final. Nadal has made several honorary kick-offs for various teams.\nIn December 2007, in the \"Friends of Iker v Friends of Rafa\" charity sports event, the two teams contested a tennis match and a football match. In December 2008, Nadal and Casillas staged a similar event, this time including an indoor football match, a tennis match, and a go-kart race.\nIn July 2010, it was reported that he had become a shareholder of RCD Mallorca (owning 10%). He was offered the role of vice president, which he rejected. His uncle Miguel Ángel Nadal became assistant coach. Shortly after acquiring his interest in Mallorca, Nadal called out UEFA for apparent hypocrisy in ejecting the club from the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League for excessive debts.\nNadal enjoys playing golf and poker. In October 2020, Nadal competed in the professional-level Balearic Golf Championship, obtaining a World Amateur Golf Ranking in the process.\n\n\nPersonal life\n\n\nFamily and beliefs\nIn June 2009, reports emerged that Nadal's parents, Ana María and Sebastián, had separated, following weeks of speculation about his recent struggles on the court. Nadal later stated \"My parents' divorce made an important change in my life. It affected me. After that, I couldn't play Wimbledon, it was tough.\"\nNadal met his future wife, María Francisca (Mery) Perelló Pascual through his younger sister, María Isabel. They began dating in 2005, when he was 19 and she was 17, and only formalized their relationship publicly in 2007, with their engagement reported in January 2019. In October 2019, the couple was married at the La Fortaleza castle in Port de Pollença, Majorca. On 8 October 2022, they had their first child, a son. Nadal had previously commented on not starting a family early and expressed a desire to have children in the future, reflecting on the unpredictability of life during his ongoing tennis career. On 7 August 2025, the couple welcomed their second son.\nMery Perelló was a sports marketer in London, but as she saw Nadal's career getting bigger, she decided to help his off-court business. She now serves as the director of Fundación Rafa Nadal.\nNadal was raised a Catholic, but now identifies as an agnostic atheist.\nNadal's native languages are Spanish and Balearic Catalan; he speaks conversational English.\n\n\nResidences\nWhen Nadal was aged 10 to 21, the extended Nadal family shared a five-storey, family-owned apartment building in Manacor. In 2012, Nadal purchased a house in Porto Cristo for about 4 million euros, located near his family home. Around the time he won the 2012 French Open, Nadal acquired a vacation home, a two-story villa in Playa Nueva Romana, in the Dominican Republic, for about 2 million euros.\n\n\nOther endeavors\nAs a young boy, he would run home from school to watch his favorite Japanese anime, Dragon Ball, and CNN dubbed him \"the Dragon Ball of tennis\" for his unorthodox style.\nOff the court, his sister described him as \"a bit of a scaredy cat\". Since childhood, he has had a fear of the dark, preferring to sleep with a light or television on. Nadal is afraid of deep water, dogs, and thunderstorms, and is nervous about riding a bicycle.\nDespite playing tennis left-handed, Nadal is right-handed in other activities.\n\n\nHealth\nThroughout his career, Nadal had chronic knee injuries, sidelining him from multiple tournaments. In late 2012, Nadal received over six months of physical therapy, along with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, a non-surgical treatment that had been previously disallowed by the World Anti-Doping Agency.\nNadal has a rare chronic disorder of his left ankle, Mueller-Weiss syndrome, diagnosed age 19. He received anesthetic injections en route to winning the 2022 French Open.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\nGrand Slam tournament performance timeline\n\nNadal's 22 Grand Slam singles titles place him second in the men's all-time rankings, behind Djokovic's 24 titles. His 30 Grand Slam singles finals place him 3rd in the men's all-time rankings, behind Djokovic's 37 and Federer's 31 finals, respectively. He has won 14 French Open titles, an all-time record at any tournament.
