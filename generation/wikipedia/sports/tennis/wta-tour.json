A player's ranking is determined by her results at a maximum of 18 tournaments for singles and 12 for doubles. Points are awarded based on how far a player advances in a tournament. The basis for calculating a player's ranking are those tournaments that yield the highest ranking points during the rolling 52-week period. The period must include:\n\nthe four Grand Slams\nsix WTA 1000 Mandatory combined/virtually combined tournaments\none WTA 1000 Mandatory (WTA-only) tournament\nthe best of seven results from all WTA 1000 Mandatory, WTA 500, WTA 250, and WTA 125 Tournaments and ITF W15+ events\nthe WTA Finals as a bonus tournament if the player attended\nAll WTA players also have a Universal Tennis Rating, based on head-to-head results.\nThe points distribution for tournaments in 2024 is shown below:\n\nS = singles players, D = doubles teams, Q = qualification players.\n* Assumes undefeated round robin match record.\nNote that if a player or team receives one or more byes and then loses their first match of the tournament, they will only receive points for the first round of that tournament.  For example, if a player receives a bye in R64 and then loses her match in R32, she will only receive points for R64 despite having advanced (via bye) to R32.  Similarly, if a player or team withdraws from their first match after receiving a bye, they will not be awarded any points for that tournament.\nIn ITF tournaments, the main draw is normally 32 for singles and 16 for doubles.  Losers in the first round of doubles will receive points equal to that shown in the R32 column above. For subsequent rounds (quarter-finals onwards) the points are the same as for singles.\n\n\nSee also\nWTA 125K series\nITF Women's Circuit\nATP Tour Association of Tennis Professionals Tour\n\n\nReferences",
