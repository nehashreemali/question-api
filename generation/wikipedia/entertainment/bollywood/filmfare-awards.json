Filmfare Awards were first introduced by Filmfare of The Times Group in 1954, the same year as the National Film Awards. They were called the Clare Awards, or The Clares, after Clare Mendonça, the editor of The Times of India.\nFrom 2001, a recorded and edited version of the awards ceremony was televised on SET a week or two after the ceremony has been held. Since 2018, the ceremony has been televised on Colors. Until 2023, the function was held in Mumbai except for year 2020 when the 65th Filmfare Awards event was held on 16 February 2020 at Sarusajai Stadium, Guwahati. Until the mid-1990s, Filmfare Awards were the preeminent and most-recognised awards in Bollywood until several other awards sprouted up in Mumbai. This has resulted in poor viewership since the 2000s.\nIn addition to the flagship event, Filmfare also has variants for regional Indian film industries, such as Filmfare Awards South for South Indian cinema; Filmfare Marathi Awards for Marathi cinema; Filmfare Awards Bangla for Bengali cinema, Filmfare Awards Punjabi for Punjabi cinema; Filmfare OTT Awards for over-the-top content, Filmfare Short Film Awards for short films; and Filmfare Glamour & Style Awards.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nBeginnings\nThe Filmfare awards were introduced in 1954. The Clares was the original name of the award ceremony, named after The Times of India critic Clare Mendonca. Readers of Filmfare were polled to decide the winners, and over 20,000 readers spread throughout India participated in the polls; trophies were given to winners of the popular vote. In the first awards function, held on 21 March 1954 at the Metro Theatre of Mumbai, only five awards were presented: Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Music Director.\n\nDo Bigha Zameen was the first movie to win the award for Best Film. The first winners for the other four categories were: Bimal Roy for his direction of Do Bigha Zameen, Dilip Kumar for his performance in Daag, Meena Kumari for her performance in Baiju Bawra, and Naushad Ali for his music in Baiju Bawra. The Filmfare Awards also introduced the Short Film Category in 2017, with Vidya Balan and Gauri Shinde on the jury. The People's Choice Award for Best Short Film was presented to Khamakha. Short films like Chutney, Matitali Kusti and Taandav won awards as well.\nHollywood star Gregory Peck was invited to be the guest of honour at the first ever awards on 21 March 1954 at the Metro theatre, Mumbai but could not make it to the function since his flight from Colombo got delayed. However, Peck did attend the banquet that followed the award night at Wellington Club (Gymkhana), Mumbai.\n\n\nPostponement in 1986 and 1987\nThe winners for the year 1985 were announced in 1986 and the event was scheduled to be held at the Brabourne Stadium in December 1986. The Bombay Film Industry as it was known then, went on strike in 1986 because of its many contentious issues with the Government of Maharashtra. As a result, the ceremony was pushed to the next year. The winners of 1985 were awarded on 28 January 1987. For security reasons, the Filmfare was not awarded for 1986 and 1987.\n\n\nRed carpet\nThe red carpet is a segment that takes place before the beginning of the actual ceremony. This is when actors, actresses, producers, directors, singers, composers, and others that have contributed to Indian cinema are introduced. Hosts question the celebrities about upcoming performances and who they think deserves to take the Black Lady home.\n\n\n2013 awards\nThe 58th Filmfare Awards honoured the best Hindi-language films of 2012 and were held on 20 January 2013 at Yash Raj Studios, Andheri, Mumbai. The ceremony was hosted by Shah Rukh Khan and Saif Ali Khan.\nThe theme for the 2013 ceremony was described as \"a hundred years in the future\", continuing from the previous year's celebration of one hundred years of Indian cinema. The organisers also redesigned the iconic \"Black Lady\" trophy for the occasion, adding a gold-plated base to mark the centenary milestone.\nAmong the major winners, Barfi! led the ceremony with twelve nominations and won seven awards, including Best Film. Kahaani also earned several honours, including Best Actress for Vidya Balan.\nThe 58th Filmfare Awards were notable for blending futuristic presentation with a retrospective celebration of Indian cinema's century-long legacy.\n\n\nTrophy\nThe statuette, depicting a woman whose arms are upraised in a dance number with her fingers touching, is commonly referred to as \"The Black Lady\" (or \"The Lady in Black\"). Originally designed by N.G. Pansare under the supervision of Times of India's art director Walter Langhammer, it is generally made of bronze, its height is 46.5 cm and it weighs around 5 kg. To celebrate the 25th year of the awards, the statues were made in silver and to celebrate the 50th year the statues were made in gold. The Filmfare trophy has been manufactured by The Award Gallery since 2000.\nUntil 2012, there had only been a few changes made to the trophy. But as of 2014, a huge change was made to give the trophy a 3-D look. There were two reasons given for this change. First, that the organisers believe that it was necessary to match the many advances in technology in today's world, which will advance a lot more in the coming years as well. This was also an attempt to match the theme of the 2013 set of awards at Filmfare in Mumbai: a hundred years leap into the future.\n\n\nCategories\n\n\nCurrent categories\nBest Film: since 1954\nBest Director: since 1954\nBest Actor: since 1954\nBest Actress: since 1954\nBest Supporting Actor: since 1955\nBest Supporting Actress: since 1955\nBest Male Debut: since 1989\nBest Female Debut: since 1989\nBest Debut Director: since 2010\nBest Music Director: since 1954\nBest Lyricist: since 1959\nBest Male Playback Singer: since 1959\nBest Female Playback Singer: since 1959\n\n\nDiscontinued categories\nBest Performance in a Comic Role (1967–2007)\nBest Performance in a Negative Role (1992–2007)\n\n\nCritics' awards\n\n\nCurrent awards\nBest Film Critics: since 1971\nBest Actor Critics: since 1998\nBest Actress Critics: since 1998\n\n\nDiscontinued awards\nBest Documentary (1967–1997)\nFilmfare Critics Award for Best Performance (1991–1997)\n\n\nTechnical awards\nBest Story: since 1955\nBest Screenplay: since 1969\nBest Dialogue: since 1959\nBest Action: since 1993\nBest Art Direction: since 1956\nBest Background Score: since 1998\nBest Cinematography: since 1954\nBest Editing: since 1956\nBest Choreography: since 1989\nBest Sound Design: since 1955\nBest Special Effects: since 2007\nBest Costume Design: since 1995\n\n\nSpecial categories\n\n\nCurrent special categories\nLifetime Achievement: since 1991\nRD Burman Award for New Music Talent: since 1995\nSpecial Performance Award: since 1971\n\n\nDiscontinued special categories\nBest Scene of the Year (1998–2012)\nPower Award (2003–2007)\n\n\nOther editions\n\n\nFilmfare OTT Awards\n\nIn 2020, Filmfare started Filmfare OTT Awards for the best in web series.\n\n\nFilmfare Awards Punjabi\n\nFilmfare Awards for Punjabi-language film industry.\n\n\nFilmfare Awards Marathi\n\nFilmfare Awards for Marathi-language film industry.\n\n\nFilmfare Awards Bangla\n\nFilmfare Awards for Bengali-language film industry.\n\n\nFilmfare Awards South\n\nFilmfare Awards for South Indian film industries.\n\n\nFilmfare Awards East\n\nFilmfare Awards for East Indian film industries.
