  "extract": "Asha Bhosle (pronounced [ˈaːʃaː ˈbʱos(ə)le]; née Mangeshkar; born 8 September 1933) is an Indian playback singer, entrepreneur, actress and television personality who predominantly works in Indian cinema. Known for her versatility, she has been described in the media as one of the greatest and most influential singers in Hindi cinema. In her career spanning over eight decades she has recorded songs for films and albums in various Indian languages and received several accolades including two National Film Awards, four BFJA Awards, eighteen Maharashtra State Film Awards, nine Filmfare Awards including a Lifetime Achievement Award and a record seven Filmfare Awards for Best Female Playback Singer, in addition to two Grammy nominations. In 2000, she was honoured with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India's highest award in the field of cinema. In 2008, she was honoured by the Government of India with the Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian honour of the country. The Guinness Book of World Records acknowledged her in 2011 as the most recorded artist in music history.\nBhosle is the sister of playback singer Lata Mangeshkar and belongs to the prominent Mangeshkar family. Renowned for her soprano voice range and often credited for her versatility, Her work includes film music, pop, ghazals, bhajans, traditional Indian classical music, folk songs, qawwalis, and Rabindra Sangeet. Apart from Hindi, she has sung in over 20 Indian and foreign languages. In 2013, she made her debut as an actress in the film Mai, and received critical acclaim for her performance. In 2006, she stated that she has recorded over 12,000 songs in her career, a figure repeated by several other sources.\n\n\nEarly life and career\nAsha Mangeshkar was born in the small hamlet of Goar in Sangli, then in the salute princely state of Sangli (now in Maharashtra), into the musical family of Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar, who was Marathi and Konkani, and his Gujarati wife, Shevanti. Deenanath was an actor and classical singer on the Marathi musical stage. When Bhosle was nine years old, her father died. The family moved from Pune to Kolhapur and then to Mumbai. She and her elder sister Lata Mangeshkar began singing and acting in films to support their family. She sang her first film song '\"Chala Chala Nav Bala\" for the Marathi film Majha Bal (1943). The music for the film was composed by Datta Davjekar. She made her Hindi film debut when she sang the song \"Saawan Aaya\" for Hansraj Behl's Chunariya (1948), though another film Andhon Ki Duniya was released before Chunariya in the same year, in both films she has sung one trio each. Her first solo Hindi film song was for the movie Raat Ki Rani (1949).\nAt the age of 16, she eloped with 31-year-old Ganpatrao Bhosle, marrying him against her family's wishes.\n\n\nCareer\n\nIn the late 1940s to early 1950s, prominent playback singers like Geeta Dutt, Shamshad Begum and Lata Mangeshkar dominated the singing for the female lead and the big films. In the 1950s, Bhosle sang more songs than most playback singers in Hindi films. Most of these were in low budget films. Her earliest songs were composed by A. R. Qureshi, Sajjad Hussain, S. Mohinder, Sardar Malik, Ghulam Mohammed and some others. Singing in Sangdil (1952), composed by Sajjad Hussain, she got reasonable recognition. In the same year, she has the lead in the film Chham Chhama Chham, under O. P. Nayyar, she has sung 10 out of 11 songs in that film. Consequently, film director Bimal Roy gave her a chance to sing in Parineeta (1953). Raj Kapoor signed her to sing all songs in Boot Polish (1954), which gained her popularity.\nO. P. Nayyar gave Bhosle a number of songs during 1952-1956, although she first achieved success in B. R. Chopra's Naya Daur (1957), composed by him. Her duets with Rafi like \"Maang Ke Saath Tumhara\", \"Saathi Haath Badhana\" and \"Uden Jab Jab Zulfein Teri\", penned by Sahir Ludhianvi, earned her recognition. It was the first time she sang all the songs for a film's leading actress. B. R. Chopra then approached her for several of his later productions, including Dhool Ka Phool, Gumrah (1963), Waqt (1965), Hamraaz (1967), Aadmi Aur Insaan (1969), Dhund (1973) and many more. O. P. Nayyar's future collaboration with Bhosle also resulted in success. Gradually, she established her status and received the patronage of such composers as Sachin Dev Burman and Ravi. Bhosle and O. P. Nayyar had a professional and personal parting of ways in the 1970s.\nIn 1966, Bhosle's performances in the duets from one of music director R.D. Burman's soundtracks, for the movie Teesri Manzil, won popular acclaim. Reportedly, when she first heard the dance number \"Aaja Aaja\", she felt she would not be able to sing this westernised tune. While Burman offered to change the music, she refused, taking it as a challenge. She completed the song after ten days of rehearsals, and \"Aaja Aaja\", along with such other songs as \"O Haseena Zulfonwali\" and \"O Mere Sona Re\" (all three duets with Rafi), became successful. Shammi Kapoor, the film's leading actor, was once quoted as saying– \"If I did not have Mohammad Rafi to sing for me, I would have got Asha Bhosle to do the job\". Bhosle's collaboration with Burman resulted in numerous hits and a marriage. During the 1960-70s, she was the voice of Hind film actress and dancer, Helen, on whom \"O Haseena Zulfon Wali\" was picturised. It is said that Helen would attend her recording sessions so that she could understand the song better and plan dance steps accordingly. Some of their other popular numbers include \"Piya Tu Ab To Aaja\" (Caravan) and \"Yeh Mera Dil\" (Don), among others.\nIn 1981, Bhosle attempted a different genre by singing several ghazals for the Rekha-starrer Umrao Jaan, including \"Dil Cheez Kya Hai\", \"In Aankhon Ki Masti Ke\", \"Yeh Kya Jagah Hai Doston\" and \"Justju Jiski Thi\". The film's music director Khayyam, had lowered her pitch by half a note.  Bhosle herself expressed surprise that she could sing so differently. The ghazals won her the first National Film Award of her career. A few years later, she won another National Award for the song \"Mera Kuchh Saamaan\" from Ijaazat (1987).\nIn 1995, 62-year-old Bhosle sang for actress Urmila Matondkar in the movie Rangeela. The soundtrack featured songs like \"Tanha Tanha\" and \"Rangeela Re\" sung by her, and composed by music director A. R. Rahman, who would go on to record several songs with her. During the 2000s, several of Bhosle's numbers became chartbusters, including \"Radha Kaise Na Jale\" from Lagaan (2001), \"Kambakht Ishq\" from Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya (2001), \"Yeh Lamha\" from Filhaal (2002) and \"Lucky Lips\" from Lucky (2005). In October 2004, The Very Best of Asha Bhosle, The Queen of Bollywood, a compilation album of songs recorded by Bhosle for albums and Hindi language films that were released between 1966 and 2003, was released.\nIn 2012 she judged Sur Kshetra.\nIn 2013, Bhosle debuted in the film Mai in the title role, at the age of 79. Bhosle played the role of a 65-year-old mother who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and is abandoned by her children. She received positive reviews for her acting as well from critics.\nIn May 2020, Bhosle launched her YouTube channel named \"Asha Bhosle Official\".\n\n\nPartnership with music directors\n\n\nO. P. Nayyar\nMusic director O. P. Nayyar's association with Bhosle is part of Hindi film lore. He was the composer who first gave Bhosle her own identity. Many people have speculated about a romantic relationship between the two.\nNayyar first met Bhosle in 1952, at the music recording of Chham Chhama Chham. He then called her for a film called Mangu (1954), and gave her a big break in superhit films like Baap Re Baap (1955), Ham Sab Chor Hain (1956), C.I.D. (1956), Duniya Rang Rangeeli (1957), Mr. Qartoon M. A. (1958) and many more. However, it was the success of Naya Daur (1957) that made the duo popular. After 1959, she was emotionally and professionally involved with O. P. Nayyar.\nThe team of O. P. Nayyar and Bhosle is best remembered for their breezy and sometimes sirenish songs. Some good examples of their sensuous numbers are \"Aaiye Meharbaan\" picturised on Madhubala (Howrah Bridge, 1958) and \"Yeh Hai Reshmi Zulfon Ka Andhera\", (Mere Sanam, 1965). \"Aao Huzoor Tumko\" (Kismat, 1968) and \"Jaiye Aap Kahan Jayenge\" (Mere Sanam, 1965) were also popular. They also recorded songs for many hit movies like Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957), Ek Musafir Ek Hasina (1962) and Kashmir Ki Kali (1964). O. P. Nayyar used the Bhosle-Rafi duo for his most popular duets such as \"Mangke Saath Tumhara\", \"Uden Jab Jab Zulfein Teri\" (both from Naya Daur), \"Aap Yun Hi Agar Humse Milte Rahe\", \"Main Pyaar Ka Rahi Hoon\" (both from Ek Musafir Ek Hasina), \"Deewana Hua Baadal\", \"Ishaaron Ishaaron Mein\" (both from Kashmir Ki Kali).\nBhosle recorded her last song for O. P. Nayyar in the movie Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye (1974). The solo number \"Chain Se Humko Kabhi\" garnered many awards, but it was not included in the movie.\nThey separated on 5 August 1972. It is not clear what made them part their ways. On being asked the reason for their parting, O. P. Nayyar once said, \"I know astrology very well. I knew that one day I had to part with her. Something also happened that upset me, so I left her.\" Nevertheless, he also said \"...now that I am seventy-six, I can say that the most important person in my life was Asha Bhosle. She was the best person I ever met.\"\nThe parting of Bhosle and O. P. Nayyar was bitter, and probably therefore she has hesitated to give Nayyar his due. While talking about O. P. Nayyar in an interview with The Times of India, she once remarked, \"Whichever composer gave me work, it was because my voice was suited to his music at that point. No one musician did me any favor by asking me to sing for him.\" She gives the credit for her first big break to B. R. Chopra, the producer of Naya Daur.\n\n\nKhayyam\nAnother music director who recognized Bhosle's talent early was Khayyam. Their partnership dates back to his first movie Biwi (1948), in which Khayyam was assistant music director. Khayyam gave her some good assignments in the 1950s, including Footpath and Phir Subah Hogi. However, their collaboration is chiefly remembered for the songs of Umrao Jaan.\n\n\nRavi\nMusic composer Ravi considered Bhosle one of his favorite singers. She sang for his first movie Vachan (1955). The melodious lullaby from this movie, \"Chanda Mama Door Ke\" became an overnight hit among young mothers in India. Ravi got her to sing bhajans for the movies Gharana, Grahasti, Kaajal and Phool Aur Patthar, Ravi and Bhosle recorded a variety of songs, including the popular comic duet with Kishore Kumar :– \"C A T...Cat, Cat Maane Billi\" (Dilli Ka Thug). The bhajan \"Tora Man Darpan Kehlaye\" (Kaajal) attained great popularity.\nThey also recorded songs for many popular movies like Waqt, Chaudhvin Ka Chand, Gumrah, Bahu Beti, China Town, Aadmi Aur Insaan, Dhund, Hamraaz and many more. For Chaudhvin Ka Chand, Ravi wanted Geeta Dutt (the wife of actor and producer Guru Dutt) to sing the songs. Guru Dutt insisted that only Bhosle could do justice with those songs, which has been proved.\n\n\nSachin Dev Burman\nSachin Dev Burman was one of those composers, who had recognized the potentiality and versatility in Bhosle and apart from Lata Mangeshkar, he had utilised the voice of Bhosle as well, he had some misunderstandings with Lata from 1957 to 1962, on that time only Bhosle used to be his only female voice. She and Burman Dada gave many songs in movies such as Nau Do Gyarah, Kala Pani, Kala Bazar, Insan Jaag Utha, Lajwanti, Sujata, Teen Devian and many more. They recorded many songs together after 1962 as well.\n\n\nRahul Dev Burman (Pancham)\nBhosle first met Rahul Dev Burman (also known as Pancham) when she was the mother of two and he was in 10th grade having dropped out to pursue music. Their partnership was first noticed in Teesri Manzil (1966). She went on to record a variety of songs with him – cabarets, rock, disco, ghazals and classical.\nIn the 1970s, Bhosle and Burman's youthful Western songs took Hindi film music by storm – the raunchy cabaret \"Piya Tu Ab To Aaja\" (Caravan, picturized on Helen), the rebellious \"Dum Maro Dum\" (Hare Rama Hare Krishna, 1971), the sexy \"Duniya Mein Logon Ko\" (Apna Desh, 1972) and the romantic \"Chura Liya Hai Tumne\" (Yaadon Ki Baaraat, 1973). Burman also recorded many hit duets with Bhosle and Kishore Kumar such as \"Jaan-E-Jaan Dhundhta Phir Raha\" (Jawani Diwani) and \"Bhali Bhali Si Ek Soorat\" (Buddha Mil Gaya).\nIn the 1980s, Burman and Bhosle recorded subtle numbers for films like Ijaazat (1987) - \"Mera Kuch Saaman\", \"Khaali Haath Shaam Aayi Hai\" and \"Katra Katra\". They also recorded the duet \"O Maria!\" (Saagar).\nBhosle used to call R. D. Burman \"Bob\". She married him in 1980. Their partnership lasted until his death.\nR. D. Burman made her sing some of the most legendary songs in Bengali as well, namely \"Mohuaye Jomechhe Aaj Mou Go\", \"Chokhe Chokhe Kotha Bolo\", \"Chokhe Naame Brishti\" (Bengali version of \"Jaane Kya Baat Hai\"), \"Baanshi Sune Ki Ghore Thaka Jaye\", \"Sondhya Belay Tumi Aami\" and \"Aaj Gun Gun Gun Kunje Amar\" (Bengali version of \"Pyaar Deewana Hota Hai\") and many other songs.\n\n\nBappi Lahiri\nBhosle has long collaboration with Bappi Lahiri, starting from mid 70s to mid 90s, Bhosle gave many songs under Bappi Lahiri such, Haathkadi (1982), Namak Halaal (1982), Sharaabi (1984), Himmatwala (1983), Mawaali (1983), Tohfa (1984), Prem Pratigyaa (1989) to name a very few. The last duet of Kishore-Bhosle \"Guru Guru, Aa Jao Guru\" from Waqt Ki Awaz (1988), also music by Bappi Lahiri. Bappi Lahiri also composed the memorable ghazal \"Kisi Nazar Ko Tera Intazaar Aaj Bhi Hai\" for Aitbaar (1985), also sung by Bhosle. \n\n\nIlaiyaraaja\nProlific Indian film composer Ilaiyaraaja began employing Bhosle's vocals in the early 1980s, their earliest collaboration being for the film Moondram Pirai (1982) (remade in Hindi as Sadma in 1983). Their association continued, mostly through the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s. Another notable song from this period is \"Shenbagamae\" for the movie Enga Ooru Pattukaran in 1987. In 2000, Bhosle sung the theme song for Kamal Haasan's political film Hey Ram. The song, \"Nee Partha Parvai\" in Tamil and Janmon Ki Jwala in Hindi (or Aparna's Theme), was a duet with singer Hariharan.\n\n\nA. R. Rahman\nA. R. Rahman is credited withBhosle's \"comeback\" with Rangeela (1995). Songs like \"Tanha Tanha\" and \"Rangeela Re\" were chartbusters. She and Rahman went on to record more hits like \"Mujhe Rang De\" (Thakshak), \"Radha Kaise Na Jale\" (Lagaan, duet with Udit Narayan), \"Kahin Aag Lage\" (Taal), \"O Bhanware\" (Daud, duet with K. J. Yesudas), \"Venilla Venilla\" (Iruvar, 1999), \"September Madham\" (Alaipayuthey, 2000) and \"Dhuan Dhuan\" (Meenaxi, 2004).\n\n\nJaidev\nWhen S D Burman's assistant Jaidev started giving music independently, he got Bhosle to sing some of his songs as well. They worked in Hum Dono (1961), Mujhe Jeene Do (1963), Do Boond Pani (1971) and other movies. In 1971, the pair released an LP of eight non-film devotional songs and ghazals called An Unforgettable Treat. Bhosle considered Jaidev a close friend who stood by her when she was struggling personally and professionally. Upon his death in 1987, she released a compilation album of lesser-known songs he had composed for her, called Suranjali.\n\n\nShankar–Jaikishan\nShankar–Jaikishan worked with Bhosle in a number of songs, especially, from 1965 to 1972. Some hits of this trio including the seductive \"Parde Mein Rehne Do\" (Shikar, 1968). Bhosle got her second Filmfare Award for the song. She also sang \"Zindagi Ek Safar Hai Suhana\" (Andaz, 1971) for Shankar–Jaikishan, in which she tried to yodel like Kishore Kumar, whose version of the song is more popular. They also used her voice in films like Boot Polish (1954), Shree 420 (1955), Chori Chori (1956), Jis Desh Men Ganga Behti Hai (1960), Junglee (1961), An Evening in Paris (1967) and Kal Aaj Aur Kal (1971), Lal Patthar (1971), Aankhon Aankhon Mein (1972) among others.

The song gained major popularity among the Indian youth. Vidyasagar recorded Bhosle's voice for a popular duet song \"Konja Neram\" for the Rajinikanth starrer Chandramukhi (2005) along with Madhu Balakrishnan.\nBhosle has worked with Lata-patrons like Laxmikant–Pyarelal, Naushad Ali, Ravindra Jain, N. Dutta and Hemant Kumar. When Naushad was asked to sum up the essential difference between Lata and Bhosle, he said that Bhosle \"lacks certain something which Lata, and Lata alone has.\" Later he stated in an interview, \"Maybe I said it because I then had a closed ear on Asha\". Naushad, later in his life, also admitted that he has been unfair to Bhosle. Bhosle has also worked with other noted Hindi film composers like Roshan, Chitragupt, Kalyanji-Anandji,  Usha Khanna, Nadeem-Shravan, Jatin-Lalit and others.\n\n\nNon-film music\n\n\nPrivate albums\nIn a rare feat, noted lyricist Gulzar, music director R.D. Burman and Bhosle came together in 1987 to create a double album titled Dil Padosi Hai, which was released on 8 September 1987. In 1995, Bhosle underwent the gatha bandan (thread-tying) ceremony with Hindustani classical music maestro Ali Akbar Khan to learn a classical repertoire held within the Maihar gharana (stylistic school of Indian classical music), as handed down to Khan by his father Allauddin Khan (the guru of Ravi Shankar). Later, Bhosle and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan recorded eleven fixed compositions (or bandishes) in California for Legacy, a private album that earned them a Grammy Award nomination.\nIn the 1990s, Bhosle experimented with remixed R.D. Burman songs. She was criticized by many, including Khayyam, for tampering with old melodies. Nevertheless, albums like Rahul And I became quite popular. In 1997, Bhosle did a private Indipop album Janam Samjha Karo with Lesle Lewis. The album was hugely popular and won her many awards including the 1997 MTV Award.\nBhosle had been once asked by director B. R. Ishara to compose music for one of his films, but she had politely declined. In 2002, she turned music composer with the album Aap Ki Asha, an eight-song music and video album. The lyrics were written by Majrooh Sultanpuri. The album was released by Sachin Tendulkar on 21 May 2001 at a lavish party in Mumbai. The album received mixed reviews.\nBhosle had spotted Pakistani singer Adnan Sami's talent when he was about 10 years old. At that time, she was performing in London with R. D. Burman. It was she who had asked him to pursue his interests in music. When Adnan grew up and became a professional musician, Bhosle sang the title duet with him for his best-selling album Kabhi to nazar milao. The two came together again in the album Barse Badal. The album comprises eight songs, based on Indian Classical music. She contributed the song Yun Na Thi to the recording Womad Talking Book Volume Four: An Introduction to Asia 1 on Womad Records.\nBhosle has sung ghazals for many albums like Meraj-E-Ghazal, Aabshar-e-Ghazal and Kashish.

The album features eight of her favorite ghazals like Farida Khanum's Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo, Ghulam Ali's Chupke Chupke, Aawargi and Dil Mein Ek Lahar, Jagjit Singh's Ahista Ahista and Mehdi Hassan's Ranjish Hi Sahi, Rafta Rafta and Mujhe Tum Nazar Se. These classic ghazals were recreated with modern sounds by musician Pandit Somesh Mathur. The album was aimed at the younger generation, who, according to Bhosle, are \"turned off\" by the traditional sounds of tabla and sarangi.\nNumerous compilations of Bhosle's songs have been released as well. To commemorate her 60th birthday, EMI India released three cassettes: Bala Main Bairagan Hoongi (devotional songs), The Golden Collection: Memorable Ghazals (non-film ghazals by composers such as Ghulam Ali, R.D. Burman and Nazar Hussain), and The Golden Collection: The Ever Versatile Asha Bhosle (44 popular film songs).\nIn 1996, Bhosle sang Channeache Rati among several other songs in Rajendra Talak's Konkani album Daryachya Deger with Suresh Wadkar.\nIn 2006, she recorded an album Asha and Friends, singing duets, with film actors Sanjay Dutt and Urmila Matondkar and famous cricket player Brett Lee, with whom she sang, \"You're the One for Me\" (Haan Main Tumhara Hoon).

The album was named after her age at the time of recording. About the album \"82\", Bhosle said, \"I had a long association with Suresh Bhat and have a lot of memories about him. With this album, I will relive those memories. I don't need to tell you how powerful his words were and, with the album, that power can be experienced again. Mr. Bhat always wanted to record these ghazals in the pop and rock genres and it is good to see Mandar fulfilling that wish. I just wish Mr. Bhat was among us today.\"\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown throughout the nation, Bhosle along with many noted artists like S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, Udit Narayan, Kailash Kher, Usha Uthup, Shaan, Alka Yagnik, Sonu Nigam and other 200 artists of India, made a song named 'Jayatu Jayatu Bharatam' to make the country unite during the pandemic.\n\n\nConcerts and collaborations with foreign artists\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Bhosle staged concerts in Canada, Dubai, UK, US and many other countries.

In the mid-1970s, she would frequently sing for Bengali songs tuned by Sudhin Dasgupta, Nachiketa Ghosh etc. In 1977, she sang the duet \"Sara Pyaar Tumhara\" with Kishore Kumar in Anand Ashram and \"Amar Swapno Tumi\" in its Bengali version with the same title. In the 1970s, she sang a lot of songs in films such as Chhadmabeshi, Bandi, Mouchak, Swayamsiddha, Amanush, Anand Ashram etc. In 1981, she sang the duet \"Aadho Aalo Chhayate\" with Kishore in Kalankini Kankabati.

In 1987, she sang \"Chirodini Tumi Je Amar\" in Amar Sangee, composed by Bappi Lahiri. In 2014, she has created the album \"Pancham Tumi Kothay\" in honor of her husband Rahul Dev Burman's 75th birth anniversary. In this album she has sung 8 songs previously composed by Burman. She has also sung in a 2014 film Paarapaar at the age of 81.\n\n\nMarathi career\nBhosle started her playback singing in Marathi with the mythological film Gokulcha Raja. Since then Bhosle has sung thousands of Marathi film songs, Bhavgeet (non-film songs). Natya sangeet from Mast er Deenanath Mangeshkar's Marathi Sangeet natak has also been recorded in Bhosle's voice. During the 1950s and 60s, Bhosle and her sister Lata were the main playback singers for Marathi films. She won the 1962 Maharashtra State Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer for the Marathi film, Manini. In 1963 music director Vasant Desai used her voice with Talat Mahmood in the film, Molkarin.  \nSome Marathi films in which Bhosle has rendered her voice are: Molkarin, Jait Re Jait, Gharkul, Devbappa, Sangtye Aika, Sinhasan, Samna, Maratha Tituka Melvava, and Nivdung.\nBhosle also sang many Marathi devotional songs (abhang) with music composed by Shrinivas Khale. \n\n\nPersonal life\nBhosle's house is situated in Prabhukunj Apt on the Pedder Road (now named Gopalrao Deshmukh Marg) area of South Mumbai.\nBhosle, at the age of 16, had eloped with 31-year-old Ganpatrao Bhosle. Ganpatrao was her personal secretary.  Her husband and in-laws mistreated her. After a few years of marriage, Bhosle was turned out by a suspicious Ganpatrao and she went to her maternal home with two children while pregnant with her third child. They separated in 1960. The eldest of her three children, Hemant Bhosle (named after Hemant Kumar), spent most of his early years as a pilot and quit to have a brief career as a music director. Hemant Bhosle's best known compositions were the Kishore-Bhosle duets such as \"Aji Kaho Kya Haal Hai\" from Anpadh picturised on Vijendra Ghatke and \"Sarika\" and \"Salamat Raho Tum\" from the same film \"Anpadh\" picturised on Ashok Kumar and Sarika. Hemant died of cancer in 2015. Bhosle's daughter Varsha committed suicide on 8 October 2012; she was 56 years old and worked as a columnist for The Sunday Observer and Rediff. Bhosle's youngest child, Anand Bhosle, has studied business and film direction. He manages Bhosle's career. Her grandson, Chaitanya (Chintu) Bhosle (Hemant's son) is a part of the world of music. He is a member of India's first and only boy band, \"A Band of Boys\". Her sisters Lata and Usha Mangeshkar are playback singers. Her other, sister Meena Mangeshkar and brother Hridaynath Mangeshkar are music directors. Her granddaughter Zanai Bhosle (daughter of Anand Bhosle) runs iAzure Apple Inc. Store in Mumbai. Zanai is an emerging singer and Kathak dancer and had sung with Bhosle.\nBhosle married Rahul Dev Burman in 1980 after a protracted romance despite vehement opposition from Rahul's mother to their relationship. This was the second marriage for both Rahul and Bhosle. Rahul, 6 years younger than her, earlier got divorced from Rita Patel in 1971.\nBhosle is an excellent cook and cooking is her favorite hobby. She often gets flooded with requests by Hindi film celebrities for kadai ghosht and biryani dishes and has rarely turned down a request. In fact, her paya curry, Goan fish curry and dal are very popular with the Kapoor family of Hindi films. Once, when asked in a The Times of India interview, what if her singing career had not taken off, she said \"I would have become a cook. I'd have cooked in four houses and made money.\" The love of cooking got Bhosle into a successful restaurant business. She runs restaurants in Dubai and Kuwait called Asha's which offers traditional north-western Indian cuisine. It has a presence in the Wafi City development in Dubai, as well as three restaurants in Kuwait, at The Avenues Mall, the Marina Mall and a brand new third outlet at the Spoons Complex. Other restaurants can be found in Abu Dhabi's Khaldiya Mall, Doha's Villagio and Bahrain's City Center Mall, with future outposts planned for Dubai's Mall of the Emirates and Cairo, Egypt. Bhosle has a 20% stake in the business. Bhosle is not involved in the day-to-day running of the restaurant which is looked after by the Wafi Group. She takes care of the kitchen and the décor. She personally trained the chefs for almost six months. According to a December 2004 report in Menu Magazine, Russell Scott, a former head of Harry Ramsden's (the fish and chips chain), secured the UK rights to the Bhosle's brand and planned to open up to 40 restaurants over the next five years. As part of her chain of restaurants, Bhosle has recently opened a new restaurant in Birmingham, UK. Bhosle will be on view at the Madame Tussauds gallery that opened in New Delhi in 2017.\n\n\nRivalry with Lata Mangeshkar\nBhosle's sibling rivalry with Lata Mangeshkar is often talked about, in spite of their insistence that these are just tales. As young children, they were very close. As a child, Lata used to carry Bhosle all the time. They were so inseparable that when Lata went to school she would take Bhosle with her. One day the teacher protested and said that they cannot have two students on one fee. Lata refused to return to school without Bhosle and quit her studies.\nLata considered Bhosle's act of eloping with her lover as irresponsible, leaving her alone to sing and earn for the family. This led to tensions between them. Bhosle herself stated in an interview – \"It was a love marriage and Lata didi did not speak to me for a long time. She disapproved of the alliance.\" At one time, their relationship was very adversarial and there have been periods of non-communication.\nIn her initial days in the industry, Bhosle always played second fiddle to her elder sister. Some say that Lata had once criticised Bhosle's relationship with O. P. Nayyar. This widened the rift between the two sisters and O. P. Nayyar also decided that he would never work with Lata. O. P. Nayyar had once revealed that \"Asha and Lata, staying in opposite flats at Bombay's Pedder Road, shared a maid. Said maid's responsibility was to come and tell the younger sister that Lata had just recorded something wonderful for Bhosle to lose her vocal poise. Such was her Lata phobia that it took me some months to convince Bhosle that she had a voice individualistic enough to evolve a singing style all of her own.\" Bhosle once said that she has worked for years to create a voice and a style that was different from Lata, so that she could carve her own niche and not be banished to live in her sister's shadow.\nBhosle and Lata have also sung together. Their first duet was for the film Daman (1951). Some of their songs include \"Man Bhawan Ke Ghar aye\" (Chori Chori, 1956), \"Sakhi ri sun bole papihaa us paar\" (Miss Mary, 1957), \"O chand jahaan woh jayein\" (Sharada, 1957), \"Mere Mehboob Mein Kya Nahi\" (Mere Mehboob, 1963), \"Unse Nazrein Mili\" (Gazal, 1964), \"Ai kash kisi deewane ko\" (Aaye Din Bahar Ke, 1966), \"Jabse Laagi Toose Najariya\" (Shikar, 1968), \"Main Haseena Nazneena Koi Mujhsa Nahi\" (Baazi, 1968), \"Main Chali Main Chali\" (Padosan, 1968), \"Chhap tilak sab\" (Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki, 1978), and \"Man kyun behka\" (Utsav, 1984). While singing, Lata used to hold her notebook in her right hand, while Bhosle held hers in the left hand. This meant Lata had her face away from Bhosle, making it difficult for them to \"anticipate\" each other.\nThe movie Saaz was supposedly based on Lata and Bhosle's rivalry. Bhosle said about the movie – \"To have two women in long plaits, take a couple of incidents and exaggerate them into a 3-hour film is such a waste of time.\" In the last few years, Bhosle and Lata have often been seen in public, enjoying each other's company. In an interview with The Times of India, Bhosle once said – \"I remember, sometimes both of us would be at a function and some industry types would ignore me and interact only with her, as if to prove their loyalty. Later, didi and I would have a good laugh!\"\n\n\nIn popular culture\nBritish alternative rock band Cornershop released \"Brimful of Asha\" in 1997. The song, dedicated to Bhosle, became an international hit single for the band and topped the UK Singles Chart in February 1998. A number of remixes have been released as well, notably by Norman Cook, also known as Fatboy Slim.\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nHindi songs\n\n\nAwards\n\n\nFilmfare awards\nAsha Bhosle has won seven Filmfare Best Female Playback Awards of 18 nominations.
