She has two elder sisters and an elder brother. She kindled an interest in dance at an early age of three, and went on to train in Kathak for eight years; later on becoming a professionally trained Kathak dancer.\n\nI received a scholarship as a Kathak dancer when I was nine. I even remember that it was due to a dance performance that the first time my name had appeared in the paper. I was seven or eight years old at that time and had performed at the Guru Purnima festival. And there was a journalist who was there and he had written this article saying that 'this little girl stole the show' – something like that. I was over the moon. So dance gave me a sense of achievement. Of worth.\"\nDixit received her education at Divine Child High School in Andheri.

The film's success established Dixit as a leading actress of Hindi cinema and marked a significant point in her career.

Her portrayal of Ganga, a police officer, who volunteers to go undercover, to trap an escaped criminal, garnered her critical acclaim. India Today wrote, \"..she grinds and thrusts in her trademark dhak dhak style.

In a review for India Today, Anupama Chopra wrote, \" Dixit gives her career's best performance. Simply dressed, she looks stunning and acts even better.

For her performance, Dixit won a third Screen Award for Best Actress. She next starred in the dramas Koyla, Mahaanta and Mohabbat.

She played Apoorva, a very rich girl who is misunderstood by Malhar, played by Patekar. Suparn Verma of Rediff commented: \"..She nevertheless shows that even a weak role cannot stifle her as she animates the screen like only she can. Truly, the coming together of Nana, Madhuri and Chandra in one film is a tour de force.\" The same year, she appeared in a cameo role in the comedy Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, once again playing herself onscreen after Dharavi. Her next and only release of 1999 was the romance Aarzoo (1999) opposite Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan.

A love story based on the backdrop of the Indian Army, the film was shot over a course of 350 days. Dixit's portrayal of Anjali, a heartbroken and jealous woman who swears revenge on Jai (played by Kapoor) for rejecting her, garnered her several Best Actress nominations at various award ceremonies, including Filmfare and Screen. A review in Filmfare said that both \"Anil Kapoor and Madhuri, veterans in their field, outdo themselves in the film\". It won two National Film Awards, including the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration. She then played the title character in Gaja Gamini, the first feature film directed by painter M. F. Husain. Hussain got fixated with Dixit, and watched her movie Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! several times, and was certain that he would make a film only with her.

Pukar was an average grosser, while the latter underperformed at the box office.\n\nIn 2001, Dixit starred in Deepak Shivdasani's love triangle Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ke opposite Ajay Devgan and Preity Zinta. Upon release, the film met with largely negative reviews. Critic Gautam Buragohain, however, described her as \"the saving grace of the film\", adding that \"she gives a delightful performance\". Commercially too, the film failed to do well. Subsequently, Dixit reunited with Rajkumar Santoshi for the social drama Lajja (2001). Dealing with the issue of gender inequality, Dixit played Janki, a theatre actress who gets pre-maritally pregnant. Anita Bora of Rediff.com wrote: \"Madhuri slips into her role as Janaki..with consummate ease..and..dazzles us with a class act.\" The film was a box-office failure in India but was an overseas success. Dixit's performance fetched her a Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination and won her the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role – Female. Dixit's first release of 2002 was the love triangle Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam opposite Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, where she played Radha whose married life blemishes when she gets obsessed with the career of her friend. A remake of director K. S. Adhiyaman's own Tamil film Thotta Chinungi (1995), the film took six years in making, with huge sabbaticals in between shoots due to several production problems. The film emerged moderately successful at the Indian box office. Few critics noted that the delay made the film look outdated.\nDixit's next release was Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period romantic drama Devdas, co-starring Shah Rukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai. It was based on Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel of the same name. She portrayed Chandramukhi, a courtesan who is in love with the title character. Sita Menon of Rediff.com wrote: \"The most understated role and perhaps the one that is most lingering, in terms of virtuosity, is that played by Madhuri Dixit. As Chandramukhi, she is simply stunning, lending passion, fire and gentleness with such consummate ease that watching her perform is sheer delight.\" The film was screened at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and was featured by Time in their listing of the \"10 Best Films of the Millennium\". The film emerged as a major commercial success with revenues of over ₹530 million (US$6.3 million). Devdas was chosen as India's official entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.

She played Dia, a choreographer who returns to her town to save the endangered theatre where she learnt to dance. A box office failure, the film generated positive reviews for Dixit's portrayal. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN criticised the plot, while he wrote about Dixit's performance: \"It's hard to take your eyes off the screen when she's up there, dazzling you with her spontaneity, her easy charm and her 100-watt smile.\" Her performance earned her another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.\n\n\n2010s: Sporadic work and television focus\nDixit relocated to India with her family in 2011 and was felicitated by Filmfare with a special jury recognition for completing 25 years in the Indian film industry.

The film opened to positive response from critics who called it \"one of the year's most important releases\". Anupama Chopra called Dixit \"compelling\", while Deepanjana Pal of Firstpost wrote \"She's still capable of keeping an audience glued to their seats when the credits start rolling, all because she's dancing on screen.\". The film earned Dixit her fourteenth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Dedh Ishqiya earned little at the box-office.\nHer next release of the year was debutant director Soumik Sen's Gulaab Gang, alongside Juhi Chawla. Dixit portrayed Rajjo, the leader of a women's activist group, inspired by the real vigilante activist Sampat Pal Devi and her group Gulabi Gang.

To prepare for her role, Dixit practised Shaolin Kung fu, stick training, and close combat. Gulaab Gang failed at the box office, earning mixed reviews. Subhash K. Jha labelled Dixit's performance and demeanour \"inconsistent\". However, Sampat Pal claimed that in Dixit's character she finds a \"reflection of her own life so stark\" that it makes her feel \"it was she on screen\". The film was a box-office failure.\nFour years later, Dixit made her debut in Marathi Cinema with the comedy drama Bucket List. She played Madhura Sane, a middle aged housewife who takes the initiative to complete the bucket list of her deceased teenage heart donor. Dixit garnered critical acclaim for her portrayal; Mihir Bhanage of The Times of India\nwrote \"Madhuri owns the film and sails through it with flying colours.\" Kunal Guha of Mumbai Mirror said, \"Madhuri Dixit long-overdue debut in Marathi cinema is a comfort watch even if a tad predictable and sappy.\"\nDixit reunited with Anil Kapoor and Ajay Devgn in Indra Kumar's adventure comedy Total Dhamaal (2019).

Set in the 1940s prior to the partition of India, the film featured her as Bahaar Begum, the madam of a brothel. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV wrote, \"In the blinding glow of Dixit's presence as a nautch girl who can turn on the magic at will, the younger cast members pale somewhat in comparison. She lights up the screen as only she can, pushing the others to strive harder.\" It did not perform well at the box office; however, she earned a third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the film.\n\n\n2020s: Transition to streaming\nDixit was the lead actress in the 2022 Netflix family mystery series The Fame Game, where she played a high-profile actress.
