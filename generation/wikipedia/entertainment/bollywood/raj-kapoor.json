  "extract": "Raj Kapoor (pronounced [raːdʒ kəˈpuːɾ]); born as Ranbir Raj Kapoor; 14 December 1924 – 2 June 1988) was an Indian actor, film director, and producer, who worked in Hindi cinema. He is considered to be one of the greatest and most influential actors and filmmakers in the history of Indian cinema, and has been referred to as The Greatest Showman of Indian Cinema and as the Charlie Chaplin of Indian Cinema.\nBorn in Peshawar as the eldest son of Prithviraj Kapoor of the Kapoor family, Raj Kapoor starred in and produced many films for which he received multiple accolades, including three National Film Awards and 11 Filmfare Awards in India. He was inspired by Charlie Chaplin and played characters based on The Tramp in films, such as Awaara (1951), Shree 420 (1955) and Mera Naam Joker (1970). His performance in Awaara was ranked as one of the \"Top-Ten Greatest Performances of All Time in World Cinema\" by Time magazine in 2005. His films Awaara (1951) and Boot Polish (1954) competed for the Palme d'Or prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1951 and 1955's editions respectively.\nHis films were global commercial successes in parts of Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Soviet bloc. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1971 for his contributions to the arts. India's highest award in cinema, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, was bestowed to him in 1988 by the Government of India.\n\n\nEarly life and background\nRaj Kapoor was born as Ranbir Raj Kapoor on 14 December 1924 at Kapoor Haveli, a large house then owned by his grandfather in the Qissa Khwani Bazaar neighborhood of Peshawar, British India into a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family who belonged to the sunar community. He had an Arya Samaji upbringing. His parents were Prithviraj Kapoor and Ramsarni Devi Kapoor (née Mehra). The Kapoor family hailed originally from Samundri, Samundri Tehsil, Lyallpur District, Punjab Province, British India. He was the eldest of six children in the family. He was the grandson of Dewan Basheshwarnath Kapoor, great-grandson of Dewan Keshavmal Kapoor, and great-great-grandson of Dewan Murli Mal Kapoor, and was part of the Kapoor family. His brothers were the late actors Shammi Kapoor (1931–2011) and Shashi Kapoor (1938–2017). He also had a sister named Urmila Sial (1935–2001). Two other siblings died in infancy. Kapoor's family later on moved from Peshawar to Bombay for residence and for education.\nAs Prithviraj moved from city to city early in his career during the 1930s, the family had to move too. Raj Kapoor attended several different schools like Colonel Brown Cambridge School in Dehradun, St Xavier's Collegiate School in Calcutta and Campion School in Bombay.\n\n\nExtended family\nHe is the nephew of actor Trilok Kapoor, who is the younger brother of his father. His first cousin was director Vijay Kapoor who was the son of Trilok Kapoor and actor Subbiraj who was his father's sister's son. His father's cousin was film producer Surinder Kapoor, whose children are producer Boney Kapoor and actors Anil Kapoor and Sanjay Kapoor. His father's maternal first cousins were actors Kamal Kapoor, Ravindra Kapoor, and Nandkishore Kapoor. Kamal's grandson is filmmaker Goldie Behl. His maternal first cousin, Juggal Kishore Mehra, was a singer, whose step-granddaughter, Salma Agha, later became an actress and singer.\n\n\nCareer\n\n\nDebut and struggle (1947–1948)\nAt the age of ten, Raj Kapoor appeared in a Hindi film for the first time, in 1935 film Inquilab.\nSome early success came with the lead role in 1947 with Kidar Sharma's romantic drama Neel Kamal opposite Begum Para and Madhubala. The film proved to be a semi-hit at the box office, but his other releases, such as Jail Yatra, Dil Ki Rani and Chittor Vijay didn't do well. In 1948, he founded his own banner R. K. Films and made his directional debut with the musical drama Aag in which he starred alongside Nargis, Premnath and Kamini Kaushal. The film was an average grosser, but received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\nStardom (1949–1964)\nSeveral films released in 1949 had a major influence on Kapoor's career. His first release Sunehre Din flopped commercially, but the next one Parivartan emerged a commercially successful venture while his third release, Mehboob Khan's romantic drama Andaz, which also starred Dilip Kumar and Nargis, went on to become highly successful at the box office. This was followed by Barsaat, which he also directed and produced. The film went ahead of the former, eventually emerging as the highest grossing Indian film of all time, breaking the record of Kismet. It ran in Kolkata's Paradise Cinema for almost two years. The huge box office success of Andaz and Barsaat made Kapoor one of the leading male stars of the time along with Dilip Kumar and Dev Anand.\nThe following year, he starred in Sargam and Dastan opposite Rehana and Suraiya, respectively. Kapoor also acted in the 1950 film Pyar, which was not a hit movie and not a popular movie, and did not receive critical acclaim. In that film, the singers were Kishore Kumar, Geeta Dutt, and Shamshad Begum. The film had a total of nine songs, with Kishore Kumar singing five songs which were two solos and three duets. The three duets Kishore had was two duets with Geeta Dutt and one duet with Shmashad Begum. Geeta Dutt singing six songs, which were two duets with Kishore Kumar and four solos, and Shamshad Begum singing only one song which was only one duet with Kishore Kumar. This movie marked the first, and last time Kishore Kumar sang for Raj Kapoor, and it was rare for only one male singer to sing in one film as in most of his films, more than one playback singer sings for him in his films, and Raj Kapoor's major playback singers for him were Mukesh and Manna Dey.\nKapoor had only one release in 1951 which was his own directional, the crime drama Awaara co-starring Prithviraj Kapoor and Nargis. The film opened to highly positive response from critics as well as the audience and proved to be another major success for the actor. Its soundtrack composed by Shankar–Jaikishan was the best-selling Hindi film music album of the 1950s and became popular in foreign markets as well, especially in the Soviet Union, China, Turkey and Afghanistan. Awaara also earned Kapoor a fan-following in Soviet Union where the film had approximately 100 million admissions and remains the third-most watched foreign film in the country. In 1952, he reunited with Nargis for psychological drama Anhonee and crime noir Bewafa. While Anhonee was a success, Bewafa only managed average returns. This was followed by a minor setback, the next year as none of his films, including Aah and Dhoon worked at the box office.\nAfter having no major appearance in 1954, he made a comeback in 1955 with the comedy drama film Shree 420, co-starring Nargis and Nadira, which garnered critical acclaim and emerged the top-grossing film of the year. Its songs, such as \"Mera Joota Hai Japani\", a solo by Mukesh, \"Pyar Hua Iqrar Hua\", a duet by Manna Dey and Lata Mangeshkar, and \"\"Mud Mud Ke Na Dekh\", a duet by Dey and Asha Bhosle, topped the year-end annual list of Binaca Geetmala and made its soundtrack the fourth best-selling Bollywood album of the 1950s. Shree 420 was released in the Soviet Union in 1956 and it took 2nd spot at the Soviet box office charts that year. Despite being imported at an unusually high price, it was the most successful foreign film of the year at the Soviet box office, drawing an audience of 35 million viewers. At the 3rd National Awards, it won National Award for Second Best Feature Film in Hindi. The following year, he starred in Anant Thakur's Chori Chori and Sombhu Mitra's Jagte Raho (which he also produced). Although underperforming commercially, the latter received acclaim and its Bengali version won Certificate of Merit at the 4th National Film Awards. Chori Chori and Jagte Raho also proved to be the final film appearances of Nargis opposite Kapoor.\nAfter delivering a moderate fare with Sharada in 1957, Kapoor delivered two successful films, the next year - Phir Subha Hogi and Parvarish, both co-starring Mala Sinha. In 1959, he collaborated with Hrishikesh Mukherjee for the comedy drama film Anari, which also had Nutan, Motilal and Lalita Pawar in the lead. The film took number one spot at the box office that year and was a blockbuster for Mukherjee whose last directional Musafir received lukewarm response from audience. The soundtrack of Anari became one of the best-selling Hindi film album of the decade. Especially the song \"Kisi Ki Muskurahaton Pe\", a solo by Mukesh, was very popular. For his performance in the film, Kapoor won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor.\nKapoor began the 1960s with Radhu Karmakar's Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai (which he also produced) and Manmohan Desai's Chhalia. The former did very well at the box office. It won Kapoor several accolades, including National Award for Second Best Feature Film in Hindi, Filmfare Award for Best Film and his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor. On the other hand, Chhalia based on Fyodor Dostoevsky's \"White Nights\" was a moderate commercial success, but received positive response from critics. From 1961 to 1963, he had only one success in C. V. Sridhar's melodrama film Nazrana (1961). In 1964, Kapoor had two releases, Dulha Dulhan opposite Sadhana and his own directional Sangam, co-starring Vyjayanthimala and Rajendra Kumar, which was the first Indian film to be exclusively shot abroad on locations including London, Paris and Switzerland and was also among the most expensive film of its time with the longest runtime for an Indian film up to that time. Sangam, which was Kapoor's first color film, was the second-highest-grossing film of the 1960s behind Mughal-E-Azam. Its soundtrack, composed by Shankar-Jaikishan, became very popular and included the songs \"Dost Dost Na Raha\", \"Har Dil Jo Pyaar Karega\", \"Bol Radha Bol\", \"Yeh Mera Prem Patra\".\nSangam also proved to be one of the last major hits of Kapoor as a lead.\n\n\nDecline, focus on direction and further acting assignments (1965–1988)\nKapoor lost stardom in the late-1960s as his subsequent releases, such as Teesri Kasam (1966), Diwana (1967), Around the World (1967) and Sapnon Ka Saudagar (1968) were commercially unsuccessful.\nIn 1970, he starred, produced and directed Mera Naam Joker, which took six years in making. The film had an ensemble cast consisting of Simi Garewal, Kseniya Ryabinkina, Padmini, Manoj Kumar, Dharmendra, Rajendra Kumar and Rishi Kapoor (playing younger version of Kapoor). Upon release, Mera Naam Joker was heavily panned by critics and proved to be a box office bomb, eventually putting Kapoor into a financial crisis. However, in later years, it attained cult status and is now considered one of his best films with film experts labelling it a \"misunderstood masterpiece\". For portraying a kind-hearted clown in the film, Kapoor won BFJA Award for Best Actor (Hindi).\nThe following year, Kapoor produced and appeared alongside his son (Randhir Kapoor) and father in Kal Aaj Aur Kal. The film proved to be moderately successful and marked Shankar-Jaikishan's last collaboration with R. K. Films. In 1973, he decided to launch Rishi to cover-up the losses incurred due to the box office failure of Mera Naam Joker, in the romantic musical Bobby, which paired him opposite debutante Dimple Kapadia. The film opened to thunderous commercial response, both in India as well as overseas and emerged an All Time Blockbuster as well as the highest-grossing film of 1973. In 1975, Kapoor returned to acting with two back-to-back successful films in Randhir Kapoor's Dharam Karam and Naresh Kumar's Do Jasoos. In 1978, he returned to the director's chair with Satyam Shivam Sundaram starring Shashi Kapoor and Zeenat Aman. It ran into controversies and was accused of promoting \"obscenity\", but opened to positive reception from critics as well as audience and earned him a nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Director category.\nIn 1980, Kapoor appeared alongside Sanjay Khan and Zeenat Aman in the highly anticipated romantic drama Abdullah. Upon release, it did not live up to expectations and underperformed domestically, but was successful overseas due to his popularity in the Soviet Union. In 1982, Kapoor once again directed his son Rishi in the romantic musical drama Prem Rog opposite Padmini Kolhapure. The film marked his return to social themes and emerged commercially successful at the box office as well as the second-highest-grossing film of the year. Its soundtrack composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal was also very successful and proved to be one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the decade. The same year, he appeared alongside Shashi in Asit Sen's Vakil Babu, which marked his final film appearance.\nIn 1985, he directed and produced romance film Ram Teri Ganga Maili, which had his youngest son Rajiv Kapoor and the then newcomer Mandakini playing the lead roles. Despite not having any stars, Ram Teri Ganga Maili took first spot at the box office that year and proved to be an All Time Blockbuster and one of the biggest hits of the 1980s. At the 33rd Filmfare Awards, it won five awards, including Best Film, Best Director for Kapoor and Best Music Director for Ravindra Jain. Ram Teri Ganga Maili was Kapoor's last work as he died in 1988. Few months before his death, he was working on an Indo-Pak cross-border love story Henna, which was later directed and released by Randhir in 1991 and went on to become a major box office success.\n\n\nPersonal life\nOn 12 May 1946, Raj Kapoor married Krishna Malhotra (1930–2018), a first cousin of his father Prithviraj. She was then 16 and he was 22. Krishna was one of nine siblings, and following her marriage, many of them joined the Hindi film industry. Her brothers, Rajendra Nath, Prem Nath and Narendra Nath, later became actors, and her sister Uma is married to actor Prem Chopra.\nRaj and Krishna Kapoor had five children: three sons, actors Randhir Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor and Rajiv Kapoor, and two daughters, Ritu Nanda  and Rima Jain. Randhir is married to former actress Babita and is the father of actresses Karisma Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor. Rishi's widow is actress Neetu Singh and their two children are daughter Riddhima Kapoor, and son, actor Ranbir Kapoor. Raj Kapoor's elder daughter, Ritu Nanda, was married to industrialist Rajan Nanda (scion of the family which promoted and controls the Escorts group), and they had two children: daughter Nitasha Nanda and son, Nikhil Nanda, married to Shweta, daughter of actors Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan. Raj Kapoor's younger daughter, Rima Jain, is married to investment banker Manoj Jain and is the mother of Armaan Jain and Aadar Jain, both actors.\nBoth of Kapoor's brothers, all three of Kapoor's sons, two of Kapoor's daughters-in-law, three of Kapoor's grandchildren and a great-grandson are all actors in the Hindi film industry. His granddaughters Karisma Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor (daughters of Kapoor's eldest son Randhir), and grandson Ranbir Kapoor (son of Kapoor's second son Rishi) are the latest Hindi cinema superstars from the Kapoor family, while another of his grandsons, Nikhil Nanda (Kapoor's daughter Ritu's son), is a noted industrialist. Nikhil's son, Agastya Nanda, made his acting debut with The Archies in 2023.\nKapoor had a longtime romantic relationship with renowned actress Nargis Dutt during the 1940s and 1950s, despite being a married man, although neither ever publicly admitted to this. The couple starred in several films together, including Awaara and Shree 420. As Kapoor would not leave his wife and children, Nargis ended their relationship after Chori Chori and married her co-star Sunil Dutt with whom she fell in love on the set of Mother India (1957). In 2017, his second son Rishi confirmed his father's affairs in his autobiography Khullam Khulla.\nKrishna Raj Kapoor died on 1 October 2018. Rajan Nanda, husband of Ritu Nanda, died on 5 August 2018. In January 2020, Ritu Nanda herself died. She was followed three months later by her younger brother Rishi, Kapoor's second son, who died in April 2020. Kapoor's third and youngest son, Rajiv, died in February 2021.\nDilip Kumar, Mukesh, Shailendra, Hasrat Jaipuri, Dev Anand, Pran, Rajendra Kumar, Manna Dey, Shankar Jaikishan, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and Rajesh Khanna were among Kapoor's closest friends from the movie industry.\n\n\nDeath\n\n\nCause\nRaj Kapoor suffered from asthma in his later years; he died of complications related to the disease in 1988 at the age of 63. He collapsed at the event where he was to receive the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in New Delhi, and was taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi for treatment. He was hospitalised for about a month before he succumbed to complications arising from his asthma. At the time of his death, he was working on the movie Henna (an Indo-Pakistan based love story). The film was later completed by his sons Randhir Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor and was released in 1991.\n\n\nMemorial at family farm in Pune\n\nHis and his parents' samadhi is at their family farm \"Rajbaugh\", meaning the \"gardens of king\". Located inside the MIT Art Design and Technology University (MIT ADTU), Rajbaugh lies on the banks of Mula-Mutha River in Loni Kalbhor village 30 km east of Pune in Maharashtra.Kapoor family sold part of 125 acres Rajbaugh to MIT ADTU which built a memorial for the Kapoor family on its campus.

The Kapoor family memorial has 7 pagodas showing elements of Raj Kapoor's movies, a museum or viewing gallery which showcases family photographs and moments from his movie making from 1945 to 1990. Raj Kapoor shot many of his films at this farm, including Satyam Shivam Sundaram, Mera Naam Joker, Bobby, and Prem Rog. The family bungalow inside the farm has been preserved; the popular song \"Hum Tum Ek Kamre Mein Band Ho\" was shot inside this bungalow.\n\n\nArtistry and legacy\n\nRaj Kapoor is often referred as The Greatest Showman of Indian Cinema in the Indian media. Film historians and movie buffs speak of him as the \"Charlie Chaplin of Indian cinema\", since he often portrayed a tramp-like figure, who, despite adversity, was still cheerful and honest. His movies were popular in large parts of South/Central/Southeast Asia, the former Soviet Union/Bloc, China, the Middle East, and Africa; his movies were global commercial successes.\nSiddharth Kak made Raj Kapoor, a feature film documentary on the actor in 1987 which was produced by the Government of India's Films Division.\n\nA postage stamp, bearing his face, was released by India Post to honour him on 14 December 2001.
