Unlike other Indian film industries, which saw the emergence of superstars that commanded a great degree of fame and stardom post-Indian independence, Malayalam cinema historically focused on stories that dealt with the lives of ordinary people, and did not generally have superstars, with the possible exception of Prem Nazir. This changed in the 1980s with the growing popularity of Mammootty and Mohanlal.
