Haasan was also criticised by Nayakan's producer Muktha Srinivasan for his article in The Hindu taking unnecessary credit for that film. Directors like Bharathan, who was irked by the unnecessary interferences of Kamal during the filming of Thevar Magan, and Balachandra Menon, who criticized Kamal for making his film, Kanden Seethaiyai, shelved by leaving the project, were some of the filmmakers who had rifts with Kamal. Sibi Malayil was supposed to direct the film Gunaa. But when he understood that Kamal Haasan would take the decisions regarding the making of film, Sibi withdrew from the project.\nHaasan has been accused of self-indulgence, and has been criticised for sexually explicit scenes and themes, offending religious sentiments and superficiality on social issues depicted in his films. There have also been complaints about his obsession with perfection, which may have caused some of his films to run over budget. He was also accused of kissing actress Rekha Harris without her consent in a scene during the shooting of Punnagai Mannan.  His former partner Gautami had said that Kamal Haasan hasn't paid her salary dues since 2016. She also accused Haasan of hurting her film prospects by preventing her from working with others.\nIn November 2017, Haasan said that right-wing Hindus have started employing extremism to propagate their communal agenda. In May 2019, he passed a controversial remark that independent India's first terrorist was a Hindu during his election campaign.\nIn May 2025, Haasan made a statement that \"Kannada was born out of Tamil\", which offended Kannadigas and Pro-Kannada activists. His refusal to apologise sparked wide spread protests in Karnataka and led to the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce calling for ban on the release of Thug Life. On 3 June 2025, the Karnataka High Court, warned Haasan that he cannot use his right to speech \"to hurt sentiments\".\nIn August, 2025, Haasan made controversial remarks on the necessity of education in Chennai, \"Education (is the) only weapon that can break (the) chains of dictatorship and Sanatan\".\n\n\nElections contested and positions held\n\n\nRajya Sabha elections\n\n\nTamil Nadu Legislative Assembly elections\n\n\nPositions in Parliament of the Republic of India\n\n\nBibliography\nK.
