  "extract": "Baahubali: The Beginning (transl. One With Strong Arms) is a 2015 Indian epic action film co-written and directed by S. S. Rajamouli, and produced by Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni under Arka Media Works.  Produced in the Telugu film industry, the film was shot in both Telugu and Tamil languages. It features Prabhas in a dual role alongside Rana Daggubati, Anushka, Tamannaah Bhatia, Ramya Krishnan, Sathyaraj, and Nassar. The first of a duology of films, it follows Sivudu, an adventurous young man who helps his love Avantika rescue Devasena, the princess of Kuntala who is now a prisoner under the tyrannical rule of king Bhallaladeva. The story concludes in Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017). \nThe film's story was written by Rajamouli's father V. Vijayendra Prasad, who told him a story about Sivagami, a woman who carries a baby in her hand while crossing a river, and a few years later about Kattappa, which intrigued Rajamouli. His fascination with Mahabharata and the tales of Amar Chitra Katha and Chandamama further fueled his interest in the story. It took the writers three months to complete the final draft. The soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani, while cinematography, production design, and visual effects (VFX) were handled by K. K. Senthil Kumar, Sabu Cyril, and V. Srinivas Mohan.\nThe film was made on a budget of ₹180 crore ($28 million), making it the most expensive Indian film at its time of release. The film opened worldwide on 10 July 2015 along with the dubbed versions in Hindi and Malayalam. It received national and international acclaim for Rajamouli's direction, story, visual effects, cinematography, themes, action sequences, music, and performances, and became a record-breaking box office success. With a worldwide box office gross of ₹600–650 crore, it became the highest-grossing Telugu film and the second highest-grossing Indian film worldwide at the time of its release. It is currently the sixth highest-grossing Telugu film of all time. At the time of its release, it also became the highest-grossing Tamil film at the time of its release. Its Hindi dubbed version also broke several records by becoming the highest-grossing dubbed film in Hindi of all time. Both budget and box office records have since been surpassed by Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, the highest-grossing film in India of all time.\nBaahubali: The Beginning along with its successor, is widely regarded as one of the most influential films of Indian cinema. It became the first Indian film to be nominated for Saturn Awards, receiving five nominations at the 42nd ceremony, including Best Fantasy Film and Best Supporting Actress. It received several accolades such as the National Film Award for Best Feature Film, and the National Award for Best Special Effects. It won five awards from ten nominations, including Best Telugu Film, Best Director – Telugu for Rajamouli, and Best Supporting Actress – Telugu for Ramya Krishna respectively, at the 63rd Filmfare Awards South. A combined recut version of The Beginning and The Conclusion, titled Baahubali: The Epic, was theatrically released worldwide on 31 October 2025.\n\n\nPlot\nAn injured middle-aged woman (Shivagamini Devi) emerges from a cave underneath a giant waterfall, carrying an infant. While trying to cross a raging river, she is swept away by the current. Facing imminent death, the woman holds the baby aloft and prays to Lord Shiva to protect the child, Mahendra Baahubali, for the sake of his birth mother and the kingdom of Mahishmati. The tribesmen of Amburi rescue the child and the chieftain's wife, Sanga, adopts him, naming him Sivudu.\nSivudu grows up to be an ambitious and mischievous man, obsessed with ascending the waterfall despite Sanga's restraints. He exhibits superhuman strength by lifting the Shiva Lingam and placing it at the foot of the waterfall, where he finds a face mask that falls from above. Realising that the mask belongs to a beautiful woman, he is determined to find its owner. With the same resolution, he successfully climbs the waterfall and discovers that the mask belongs to Avantika, a warrior woman belonging to a resistance group dedicated to rescuing Devasena, the captive princess, from the despotic king of Mahishmati, Bhallaladeva.  \nHe overhears the group talking about Kattappa, who is known to be a good man, but is a slave who is bound to the throne and is loyal to the king despite despising him. Kattappa saves Bhallaladeva from a bull, and as his reward, asks Bhallaladeva to free Devasena - however, Bhalladeva refuses, insisting that Devasena must stay as his prisoner until she dies. \nSmitten with Avantika, Sivudu pledges to fulfil her cause and sets out for Mahishmati. He infiltrates the kingdom disguised as a guard during the festivities of Bhallaladeva's birthday, where he rescues people from being crushed by Bhallaladeva's enormous golden statue. An elderly slave recognises him to be Baahubali and chants the name. Eventually, everyone at the celebration chants Baahubali's name, enraging Bhallaladeva. On the same night, Sivudu distracts Bhallaladeva and escapes from the city with Devasena, with Bhallaladeva's son Bhadra and Kattappa in pursuit. \nThey find Shivudu and ambush them. After seeing Bhadra torture Devasena, Shivudu breaks free and a fight breaks out. The members of her resistance group and the people of Amburi tribe, led by a worried Sanga, arrive at the scene. Sivudu beheads Bhadra to their shock and Devasena's glee. Kattappa, upon seeing Sivudu's face, falls at his feet and proclaims him to be Baahubali. Everyone bows to Sivudu, confusing him. Sivudu confronts Kattappa, demaning to know who he is. Kattappa reveals that he is the son of Amarendra Baahubali, the beloved warrior prince of Mahishmati, and the woman who died protecting him as an infant is the queen regent Sivagami Devi. He starts narrating the story. \nFifty years ago, King Vikramadeva of Mahishmati dies unexpectedly. When the kingdom is in dissarray, Sivagami, the wife of Vikramadeva's physically disabled elder brother, Bijjaladeva, takes the reigns of the kingdom herself. Bijjaladeva, who was denied the throne due to his wicked nature, desires to declare his infant son Bhallaladeva as the future king. However, Sivagami adopts Vikramadeva's orphaned infant, Amarendra Baahubali, and decides to raise him along with Bhallaladeva as her own son, with the intent of choosing the most efficient prince as the next king - this displeases Bijjaladeva. The princes grow up to be formidable warriors and are educated in all matters of ruling a kingdom. Bhallaladeva has retained the power-hungry nature of his father, while Baahubali is loved by the subjects of the kingdom. \nMahishmati faces threat from the savage tribe of Kalakeya, who lay siege to the kingdom. Bijjaladeva proposes that whoever repels the threat by murdering Inkoshi, the chieftain of Kalakeya, will be crowned as the King. As the battle begins, Baahubali uses innovative tactics to save any bystanders and inspires his soldiers to fight bravely for the kingdom while Bhallaladeva indiscriminately kills opponents and the captured subjects of Mahishmati. After Baahubali subdues Inkoshi, Bhallaladeva kills him and is expected to be crowned as the king, much to the displeasure of Kattappa and the people of Mahishmati. However, Sivagami announces Baahubali as the future king and Bhallaladeva as the Commander General, pointing out how he had shown his respect and saved his own people in the battle, whereas Bhalladeva had focused on the war alone. \nUpon hearing about Amarendra Baahubali, Sivudu and his adoptive parents are awed desire to meet him, but Kattappa reveals that he was treacherously murdered. When Shivudu demands to know who had done it, Kattappa reveals that it was him who had killed Baahubali.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nProduction\n\nBaahubali: The Beginning was produced in the Telugu film industry and filmed in both Telugu and Tamil languages simultaneously. Distant shots, however, were only shot in Telugu and dubbed in Tamil. As of July 2015, the film series was considered the most expensive in India.\n\n\nDevelopment\nDirector S. S. Rajamouli revealed that Baahubali is inspired by the epic Mahabharata. V. Vijayendra Prasad, the screenwriter and Rajamouli's father who wrote stories for most of Rajamouli's films, once again penned the story for Baahubali. Vijayendra Prasad revealed that Sivagami has shades of both Kunti and Kaikeyi while Devasena is a warrior like Sita. He further added that he sees Baahubali as the story of Sivagami and Devasena. He was also inspired by tales of Chandamama and Amar Chitra Katha comics.\nIn February 2011, S. S. Rajamouli announced that Prabhas would star in his upcoming movie. In January 2013, he announced that the working title was Baahubali. Actual film production started at Rock Gardens in Kurnool on 6 July 2013. The waterfall scenes were shot at Athirappilly Falls in Kerala, huge sets for the Mahishmati kingdom were constructed at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad, and the snow episodes in the film were shot in Bulgaria. The film boasts of one year pre-production work wherein 15,000 storyboard sketches for the film were created—the highest for any Indian Film as of this date. More than 90 percent of the film had visually enhanced shots and, according to the producer, more than 600 VFX artists worked for the film from 18 facilities around the world led by Makuta VFX and Firefly in Hyderabad, Prasad Studios in Hyderabad and Chennai, Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad, Tau Films, and Dancing Digital Animation and Macrograph in South Korea. Makuta VFX which had prior experience of working with S. S. Rajamouli was chosen as principal visual effects studio. The cinematography of the movie was done by KK Senthil Kumar for 380 days using Arri Alexa XT camera with Master Prime lens. This marked Rajamouli's first film using digital imagery.\nMost of the film was shot in ArriRaw format in 4:3 aspect ratio while ArriRaw 16.9 was used for slow motion shots at 120 fps. Open Gate format, which can use the full 3.4K sensor in the camera to produce frames larger than the standard ArriRaw format, was tapped in to get the maximum image quality in VFX shots. Production designer Sabu Cyril created 10,000 different kinds of weaponry including swords, helmets and armour required for the soldiers. To make the swords lightweight, carbon-fibre was used instead of steel. 3D printing technology was used to create the head of the 100-foot Bhallaladeva statue in the movie. Flexi foam was used to make lightweight armour with the look of leather. V. Srinivas Mohan was chosen as visual effects supervisor, and Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was the editor. P. M. Satheesh was the sound designer and Peter Hein was responsible for the action sequences. The costume designers were Rama Rajamouli and Prasanthi Tipirneni. The line producer was M. M. Srivalli.\n\n\nVisual effects\nNational Award winner V. Srinivas Mohan was roped in as Visual effects supervisor for Baahubali. Makuta VFX which is based out of Hyderabad was chosen as principal visual effects studio and was responsible for more than 50% of the computer-generated imagery in the film. The majority of work done by Makuta involved bringing the 1500 foot waterfall to life, creating mountains and landscapes including the kingdom of Mahishmati, with its massive temples and courtyards. Creating the waterfall took nearly two years as Makuta dealt with complexity in fluid dynamics and simulations. Manuka claimed each frame of the waterfall sequence was treated as creating a new set and employed a different set of methodology.\nFirefly Creative Studio of Hyderabad worked primarily on the avalanche and the war sequences, which account for nearly 25 minutes of the film. Firefly Creative was also involved in creating underwater VFX shots and in establishing backstories for Kalakeya characters. Tau Films was responsible for creating the CGI bison, while Prasad EFX from Hyderabad was responsible for some shots in pre and post battle episodes involving digital multiplication. Prasad also created a 3D image of Kattappa and mapped his head onto a duplicate actor in one of the scenes.\nSrushti VFX from Hyderabad was involved in digitally creating some of the shots in the war sequence along with Firefly Studios. Annapurna Studios from Hyderabad was chosen as digital intermediate partner for the film which is responsible for generating the digital feed with the best colour and audio for editing. For the first time in Indian movies, Academy Color Encoding System workflows were implemented along with Infinitely Scalable Information Storage keeping in mind the scale of digitally enhanced shots in the film. Arka Media Works, production company of Baahubali, teamed up with AMD to use the state of the art FirePro GPUs W9100 and W8100 during post production.\nIn an interview with Quartz, the co-founder of Makuta VFX stated, \"Most of Baahubali was developed in Hyderabad, home to Tollywood, and used local talent. It was principally a homegrown feature produced by homegrown talent.\"\n\n\nKiliki language\n\nThe fictional language Kiliki (also referred to as Kilikili) spoken by the Kalakeyas, a ferocious warrior tribe, was created by Madhan Karky for the film. It is said to be the first fictional language to be created for Indian film.\nWhile Karky was pursuing a PhD in Australia, he took up a part-time job of teaching and baby-sitting children. During one such interaction, he thought it would be fun to create a new language that could be easily grasped. Basic words were first made up and opposites were represented by word reversals – me was min and you was nim. The language, with 100 words, was called \"Click\" to highlight its simplicity. This formed the foundation for Kiliki.\n\nKilikili consists of at least 750 words and more than 40 concrete grammar rules.\nIt was designed to be an intuitive language: Karky said he used hard consonants and soft consonants depending on the nature of the words' meanings.\nThe language was created keeping in mind that the Kalakeya warriors had to be portrayed as terrifying brutes.\nOn 21 February 2020, on the occasion of International Mother Language Day, Rajamouli launched the official website of Kiliki language. He called the language as \"world's youngest and easiest language.\"\n\n\nMusic\n\nRajamouli's cousin M. M. Keeravani composed the music and background score for this film and the sound supervision was done by Kalyani Malik. The Telugu version of the soundtrack album was released on 31 May 2015, at the Sri Venkateswara University Grounds. The album of the film's Tamil version was released on 7 June 2015, while the soundtrack of the Hindi and Malayalam versions, were released on 21 June and 1 July respectively.\n\n\nRelease\n\n\nScreenings and statistics\nThe film was released on 10 July 2015 in 4,000 screens worldwide in Telugu, Tamil, Hindi and Malayalam languages.

The film was released in the USA a day earlier by BlueSky Cinemas in 135 screens. A premier show was also held on 9 July at Prasads IMAX Hyderabad. The film's release in Kerala was hindered by the shutdown of a number of theatres due to the piracy issue of the Malayalm film Premam and released in only a few theatres.

Marketing of the film started two years before the shoot by S. S. Rajamouli with the audition campaign on Facebook and YouTube. A number of short promotional behind-the-scenes videos were released on ArkaMediaworks YouTube channel and the team unveiled first look posters and videos featuring the film's lead stars on the occasions of their birthdays. The film used an augmented reality application to play the trailer on smart phones and tablets. The crown used by the character of Baahubali in the film was exhibited at Comic Con, Hyderabad, as a part of the film's promotion. A cosplay event was held in which chosen winners were given a chance to visit the sets of the film. On 22 July 2015, Guinness World Records approved the poster created during the audio launch of Baahubali in Kochi on 1 July 2015 as the world's largest poster. The poster has an area of 4,793.65 m2 (51,598.21 ft2) and it was created by Global United Media Company Pvt Ltd. This record was later broken by a 5,969.61 m2  poster for the film MSG-2 The Messenger.\nProducers announced plans to create a film museum at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad to showcase the weapons, armour, and costumes used by actors in the film. The museum would be the first of its kind for any Indian movie. The film's website hosts merchandise which includes apparel, accessories, and film collectibles.\n\n\nDistribution\nIn early July 2014, for the first part of the film, the region distribution rights for Karnataka and Ceded (Rayalaseema) were sold to a distributor for ₹230 million (US$3.59 million).

In Korea, the movie is scheduled to be released via Entermode Corp.\n\n\nControversy\nThe Tamil version of the film faced a controversy relating to a word used in the film. On 22 July 2015, activists of Dalit group Puratchi Pulikal Iyakkam hurled petrol bombs outside the 'Tamil, Jaya' multiplex in Madurai screening the Tamil version of the film. The Dalit group Puratchi Pulikal Iyakkam protested against the movie over the inclusion of the word 'pagadai' (gambler). Members of the group claimed the words, used by caste Hindus to address members of the Arunthathiyar Dalit sub-caste, are considered derogatory against Dalits. Dialogue writer of Tamil version, Madhan Karky issued an apology for offending Dalits.\n\n\nHome media\nArka Media Works gave the satellite rights to Star Maa and the Malayalam dubbed version was also given the satellite rights to Mazhavil Manorama.

The outcome of the battle is no surprise, but there are enough clever tactics and twists to keep the audience hooked. The biggest surprise, however, lies in the film's final shot, which gives you a glimpse into the sequel that will come out next year.\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV India rated the film with three stars out of five and stated, \"The spectacular universe that the film conjures up is filled with magic, but the larger-than-life characters that populate its extraordinary expanse do not belong to any known mythic landscape. To that extent, Baahubali, driven by the titular superhero who pulls off mind-boggling feats both in love and in war, throws up many a surprise that isn't altogether meaningless.\"\nShubhra Gupta of The Indian Express praised the film: \"Right from its opening frames, Baahubali holds out many promises: of adventure and romance, love and betrayal, valour and weakness. And it delivers magnificently on each of them. This is full-tilt, fully-assured filmmaking of a very high order. Baahubali is simply spectacular.\" In her review for The Hindu, Sangeetha Devi Dundoo wrote, \"The war formations that form a chunk of the latter portions of the film are the best we've seen in Indian cinema so far. These portions are spectacular and show the technical finesse of the cinematographer (K.K. Senthil Kumar) and the visual effects teams. The waterfall, the mystical forests and water bodies above the cliffs and the lead pair escaping an avalanche all add to the spectacle. Give into its magic, without drawing comparisons to Hollywood flicks.\"\nSukanya Varma of Rediff gave the film four out of five stars, calling it \"mega, ingenious and envelope pushing!\" Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave the film four stars (out of 5) and summarised, \"Baahubali is truly an epic experience. Had the story not been so jaded, this would've gone into the history books as an all-time classic. But that's not the case. It has its set of storytelling flaws, but even those are overshadowed by Rajamouli's ideas and execution. This is definitely worthy of being India's most expensive film. It's a definite movie watching experience.\"\nSuparna Sharma of Deccan Chronicle praised the second half of the film, writing, \"Rajamouli has reserved all the grander and grandstanding for later, after interval. That's when the film stands up and begins to strut like an epic.\" Suhani Singh of India Today pointed out that the film is best enjoyed keeping logic at bay. She added, \"SS Rajamouli and his team put up a fascinating wild, wild east adventure. It takes pluck to conceive a world like the one seen in Baahubali and to pull it off on a level which is on par with the international standards. The almost 45-minute-long battle sequence at the end is not just one of the biggest climaxes, but also the action spectacle rarely seen in Indian cinema. And if Rajamouli can present another one like that in part 2, then he is on course to register his name in cinema's history books. We can't wait to revisit Mahishmati kingdom.\"\nCritical reception penned by Shubha Shetty Saha for Mid-Day rates the film with four stars out of five, exclaiming, \"While watching Baahubali, you might have to periodically pick up your jaw off the floor. Because this is not merely a movie, it is an unbelievably thrilling fantasy ride.\" The review extends praising the aspects, \"It is to the director's credit that every aspect of the film – action, mind-boggling set design and choreography – lives up to this epic film of gigantic scale. The choreography in the song that has Shiva disrobing Avantika to get her in touch with her feminine side, is an absolute gem.\"\n\n\nInternational\nCritics praised the film for its direction, technical values, and the actors' performances. Lisa Tsering based on The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"The story has been told many times before – a child is born destined for greatness and as a man vanquishes the forces of evil – but in the confident hands of accomplished South Indian director S.S. Rajamouli the tale gets potent new life in Baahubali: The Beginning.\" Allan Hunter, writing for Screen Daily noted that \"The broad brushstrokes storytelling and the director's over-fondness for slow-motion sequences are among the film's failings but this is still a rousing film, easily accessible epic. There's rarely a dull moment in Baahubali: The Beginning, part one of a gung-ho, crowd-pleasing Telugu-language epic that has been shattering box-office records throughout India.\"\nMike McCahill of The Guardian rated the film four stars out of five, praising the film, \"Rajamouli defers on the latter for now, but his skilful choreography of these elements shucks off any cynicism one might carry into Screen 1: wide-eyed and wondrous, his film could be a blockbuster reboot, or the first blockbuster ever made, a reinvigoration of archetypes that is always entertaining, and often thrilling, to behold.\" Suprateek Chatterjee of The Huffington Post wrote, \"However, all said and done, Baahubali: The Beginning is a remarkable achievement. What Rajamouli has pulled off here, despite its flaws, is nothing short of a miracle, especially when you take into account India's notoriously risk-averse filmmaking environment and when the film ends on a tantalizing cliffhanger (paving the way for Baahubali: The Conclusion, due to release next year), one can't help but applaud his singularly brave vision. As the cliché goes, a journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step, but it doesn't really matter if that first step is shaky as long as it lands firmly and confidently.\"\n\n\nBox office\n\nBaahubali: The Beginning collected ₹15 crore (US$2.34 million) from the United States on its first day.
