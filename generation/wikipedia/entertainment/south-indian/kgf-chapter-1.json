  "extract": "KGF: Chapter 1 is a 2018 Indian Kannada-language period action film written and directed by Prashanth Neel, and produced by Vijay Kiragandur under the banner of Hombale Films. It is the first installment in the KGF series, followed by KGF: Chapter 2. The film stars Yash, Srinidhi Shetty, Vasishta N. Simha, Ramachandra Raju, Archana Jois, Anant Nag, Achyuth Kumar, Malavika Avinash, T. S. Nagabharana and B. Suresha. Filmed on a budget of ₹80 crore (equivalent to ₹107 crore or US$13 million in 2023), it was the most expensive Kannada film at the time of its release. In the film, Rocky, a high-ranking mercenary, working for a prominent gold mafia in Bombay, seeks power and wealth in order to fulfill his mother's promise. Due to his high fame, the leaders of the gold mafia where he works hire him to assassinate Garuda, the son of the founder of Kolar Gold Fields.\nThe film's development began in early 2015, after Neel finished writing the screenplay. Filming began two years later, in January 2017. Most of the film is set in the Kolar Gold Fields and was filmed in locales such as Kolar, Mysore, and parts of North Karnataka. The film's production was completed in August 2018. Bhuvan Gowda handled the cinematography and Srikanth edited the film. Composer Ravi Basrur scored the film.\nThe Kannada version of K.G.F: Chapter 1 was released on 20 December 2018 and the dubbed versions in Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and Hindi released the next day. The film received positive reviews from critics and dialogues from the film became famous worldwide. The film did well commercially and earned ₹250 crore (equivalent to ₹334 crore or US$40 million in 2023) in its entire theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing Kannada film until it was surpassed by its sequel. It turned out to be a cult hit. At the 66th National Film Awards, the film won two awards for Stunt Choreography and Best Special Effects. At the 66th Filmfare Awards South, the film won two awards from five nominations, including the award for Best Film and Best Actor for Yash.\n\n\nPlot\nJournalist Anand Ingalagi's book El Dorado, which detailed the events at the Kolar Gold Fields (KGF) between 1951 and 2018, was banned by the Indian government, but a television news channel procures a copy and interviews him.\nIn 1951, Raja \"Rocky\" Krishnappa Bairya was born to a poor, underage girl named Shanti. On the same day, government officials, accompanied by Suryavardhan, arrived to investigate a strange yellow rock discovered by workers digging a well in southern Mysore State. Upon realizing that the rock was gold ore, Suryavardhan, a powerful don and politician of the time, killed the officials and leased the land for 99 years under the pretext of running a limestone mine called Narachi, while secretly establishing K.G.F and his crime syndicate. To manage the empire, Suryavardhan had appointed five associates: Adheera, his ruthless younger brother, who headed the security at K.G.F; Kamal, son of Suryavardhan's late associate Bhargav, who looks after gold refinery in Varca; Rajendra Desai, who oversees the transportation of gold bars coming from the refinery; Andrews, who oversees the gold smuggling in the Western Coast; and Guru Pandian, president of the incumbent DYSS party who gave political influence to Suryavardhan. Suryavardhan suffers a stroke and appoints his elder son Garuda as the future heir of K.G.F, expecting Adheera to serve as his son's aide. His associates, now eyeing the riches of K.G.F, plan to assassinate Garuda. Adheera is presumed dead after Garuda bombs his car in retaliation for Adheera's unsuccessful assassination attempt. \nRocky arrives in Bombay as a ten-year-old on a quest for wealth and power as desired by his dying mother, and begins to work for Shetty, a gold smuggler and Andrews' underboss, who competes against a Dubai-based underworld don Inayat Khalil. Years later, he rises in ranks and oversees the arrival of gold bars to the Bombay coast. Andrews notices Rocky's influence has begun to rival Shetty's own, and offers Rocky complete control of the Bombay underworld in return for assassinating Garuda. Rocky accepts the offer and heads to Bangalore, where Suryavardhan's statue is built at the DYSS party office to lure Garuda out of K.G.F. Desai, Andrews, Kamal, and Andrews' secretary Daya covertly smuggle in a pistol for Rocky, but the attempt is foiled when they are spotted by Garuda's bodyguards. Garuda reveals he had replaced his father's statue with his own. Rocky, witnessing the authority and power that Garuda commands and seeing no other option to murder him, decides to journey to K.G.F. The workers in K.G.F, who are forcibly kidnapped from nearby villages, are subjected to inhumane conditions and treated as slaves. Rocky allows himself to be kidnapped and enters K.G.F with other slaves. Rocky stealthily accesses the map of the mine in the maintenance room during a roll call and narrowly escapes death after a fellow slave sacrifices himself to save the lives of his wife and unborn child. Andrews, Kamal and Desai are misinformed about the incident and assume Rocky is killed.\nAlthough apathetic at first, he is moved by the cold-blooded murder of a mother and son by a guard. Rocky engages in a fight with an entire unit of twenty-three guards, killing each one of them to save a blind slave. With this act, Rocky emerges as a messiah in the slaves' eyes. He orders them to burn the guards' corpses to let Andrews and his men know he is still alive via their informants, Kulkarni and Garuda's younger brother Virat. Garuda prepares to leave his residence to investigate the fire and missing guards. To avert this, Virat smothers Suryavardhan to death, in order to sidetrack Garuda, who rushes back home. Rocky heads unsuspected through a tunnel from the mines to Garuda's mansion, following the map in the maintenance room.\nShaken by the recent bad turn of events, Garuda orders Maa Kaali's ritual, to be rescheduled from the following week to the next day. Garuda plans to kill his father's allies as soon as the ritual, where he has decided to behead three assassins (sent earlier to kill him) as offerings to the goddess, is completed. The next day, while preparations for the ritual are being made, Vanaram, the head of security, discovers one of the assassins dead inside his prison cell, and realizes someone has entered the mansion. As Garuda beheads two assassins, Rocky, who hid himself as the third assassin, emerges and beheads Garuda. The ecstatic slaves accept Rocky as their leader.\nIngalagi concludes that Rocky intentionally chose K.G.F as the location to assassinate Garuda, thereby inspiring an army of slaves to help him seize control. He indicates, however, that this is just the beginning. The news of Garuda's murder reaches Inayat Khalil and Ramika Sen, the to-be prime minister of India. Adheera, who is revealed to be alive, hears the news of Garuda's death and plans to resurface. All others at the K.G.F including Desai, Kamal, Andrews, Daya, Khalil and Shetty, were overjoyed by hearing the news. As Vanaram orders his men to attack Rocky and his army, a gunshot is heard.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nProduction\n\n\nPre-production\nFollowing the success of Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari (2014), Yash signed for four projects as of March 2015, including one with director Prashanth Neel (of Ugramm fame). The project, KGF, about an ambitious man and his life in the 1970s, was considered to be one of the most expensive films in Kannada cinema. Hombale Films, the production house led by Vijay Kiragandur, bankrolled the project, and one of its production executive Karthik Gowda, stated that \"KGF, which is set in the 70s, took over one and a half years of pre-production, because they wanted to ensure they got every single detail right, be it the matchboxes, telephone, or the clothes people wore.\" The film's director, Prashanth Neel, stated that the film would be launched in April 2016, and the shooting would begin in May 2016. Ravi Basrur, who earlier scored music for the director's Ugramm, was hired for the project, while Bhuvan Gowda handled the cinematography.\nIn an interview with The Times of India, Prashanth Neel stated that he planned to split the film in two parts, as the narration of the story is in a non-linear format. The decision to split the film into two parts also had to do with its commercial prospects. He further added “The scale of the project is huge and we had a scope for a beginning, an interval, and an end for both parts, so it made sense for us to release it as two parts”. As for the decision to make it a multilingual release, he says that it was because the film is based on a unique idea and has a universal theme. About the rumours of doing KGF as a \"Tamil version, with Suriya being roped in, but failing to do so\", he stated that it was meant to be a Kannada film.\nIn December 2020, during the making of its second installment, Prasanth Neel denied rumours of a third installment in the KGF franchise, claiming that the story would conclude in its second part.\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe film's cast consists mostly of completely new faces. The cast members sported rugged looks, given the subject and setting of the film. Yash grew his beard and long hair for his role as Rocky, a slick and a suave person of the 1970s. Bangalore-based model Srinidhi Shetty, a winner of the Miss Supranational 2016, was cast alongside Yash. Srinidhi, a self-confessed fan of Yash, claimed that she had watched his films Drama and Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari, and stated that he is one of the actors to whom she looks forward. In August 2017, Vasishta Simha bagged a pivotal role in the film, while Ramya Krishnan and Nassar were falsely reported to be a part of the film.\nIn July 2016, the filmmakers kick-started a 15-day schedule in North Karnataka, without Yash, as the actor was shooting for Santhu Straight Forward (2016). The first schedule of the film took place on a huge set, which took more than 35–40 days to construct. The film was slated to take off earlier that year, but was pushed back because of problems surrounding the Kalasa Banduri issue, which meant the team had to cancel its initial shoot schedule plans. The schedule was further complicated by Yash's break from shooting films, in order to focus on his wedding to Radhika Pandit, which was held in Bangalore in December 2016.\n\n\nFilming\nThe film's shooting began on 15 January 2017, after completing the final stages of pre-production. On 25 January 2017, the filmmakers erected huge sets at Badami, to replicate Kolar in the period of 1970–80, thereby filming extensively in the location. The art director Shivakumar recreated the Kolar Gold Fields film set of the 1980s and VFX was used as an extension for the film. Aware that a freak accident happened at the sets of Masti Gudi (2017), claiming the lives of two actors, producer Kirangadur secured an insurance cover for the crew members working on the film. As of 25 June 2017, the project was 50 percent complete, and production had restarted after sets were rebuilt, following their destruction by heavy rains.\nAs a part of the film's shoot, the filmmakers painted a portion of the Jayalakshmi Vilas Mansion, which is located on the campus of University of Mysore. Some sequences of the movie, which has Yash and Srinidhi Shetty in the lead roles, were also shot at the centenary clock tower located next to the campus. Yash entered the final schedule of the film in April 2018. In May 2018, actors Malavika Avinash and Anant Nag filmed the interview sequence, one of the major scenes in the film's storyline. At the end of the month, Yash had announced that he had completed his portions, and started dubbing for the film. As of May 2018, the filmmakers completed major portions of the film, except one song.\nIn August 2018, Kajal Aggarwal was reported to shoot for a song sequence, thus marking her debut in Kannada. However, on 9 August, Tamannaah Bhatia was hired for a song number, thus marking her second film appearance in Kannada, after Jaguar (2016). On 17 August 2018, the filmmakers announced that shooting of the film had wrapped, although another song shoot for the film's Hindi version, featuring Yash and Mouni Roy, took place at the Goregaon Studio on 7 and 8 December.\n\n\nThemes and influences\nIn an interview with director Prashanth Neel for The Times of India about the theme of the film, he stated \"'KGF' has a strong texture of gold in it, which is about greed and gold. KGF, in many ways, is akin to El Dorado. The way kings and soldiers have over the years gone looking for the mythical El Dorado, where anyone who lays claim to the place ruled the world. This is what Anant Nag (narrator) says in the film, too.” Prashant explains about the setting of the film in 1970–80, stating, \"In 1978, because of the Cold War between the USA and the erstwhile Soviet Union that had affected places like Iran and Afghanistan, the price of gold went up the highest in the recorded history. Till date, one cannot find another time when the price of gold shot up so much. So, 1978 was the perfect setting for us, because the higher the price of gold, the higher the greed of men.” The film was also inspired by action films and western films like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and For a Few Dollars More.\n\n\nMusic\n\nRavi Basrur composed the soundtrack album and the film's score, while Tanishk Bagchi remastered the track \"Gali Gali\" from Tridev (1989) for the film's Hindi version. The audio rights of the film were purchased by Lahari Music in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Malayalam for ₹3.6 crore (equivalent to ₹4.8 crore or US$570,000 in 2023), a record sum for any South Indian film; the Hindi version's audio rights were bought by T-Series.\nThe track \"Salaam Rocky Bhai\" served as the lead single from the soundtrack album. It was released in Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam on 7 December 2018, along with the full soundtrack album; the album for the Hindi version was released on 9 December 2018. The karaoke versions of the songs were released on 27 December 2018.\nThe film's score was released in two volumes; the first volume of the original soundtrack was released on 10 September 2019, and the second volume was released on 12 October 2019.\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first look of the film was released on 3 May 2017. On 8 January 2018, coinciding with Yash's birthday, a one-minute long introductory teaser, with Ananth Nag narrating, was unveiled by the production team. After responding to a fan's request, Yash announced that the film's trailer would be released in October 2018. Farhan Akhtar shared the first look on 6 November 2018 and a second one on 8 November on the occasion of Diwali. The official trailer of the film was released on 9 November 2018. The trailer crossed more than one million views within an hour of its release.\nSpecial promotions were planned on 4 December in Chennai, and 6 December in Hyderabad. On 9 December 2018, the makers hosted a pre-release event at the JRC Convention Centre in Hyderabad to promote the film's Telugu version. S. S. Rajamouli graced the event as the chief guest. As a part of the film's promotion, an online game, KGF, specially designed for Android mobile phones, was released by Mobi2Fun Private Limited for the Google Play Store, which saw more than 5,000 downloads upon its initial release.\n\n\nRelease\n\n\nTheatrical\nOn 28 August 2017, the filmmakers announced that KGF will be made as a multilingual film, released in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Hindi languages, marking the first foray of its crew members (including Yash) into different industries. The filmmakers planned to release the film in the second half of 2018. On 19 September 2018, it was announced that the first part of the film will be released on 16 November 2018; however, the release was postponed to 21 December.\n\n\nYouTube\nKGF Chapter 1 also release his Hindi dubbed  version on  YouTube channel Goldmines Telefilms. the Hindi dubbed version crossed more than 750 million views.\n\n\nDistribution\nThe distribution rights for the Kannada version were bought by KRG Studios, a sister company of Hombale Films.

The rights for the Tamil and Telugu dubbed versions were sold to Vishal Film Factory and Vaaraahi Chalana Chitram. The Malayalam-dubbed rights of the film were sold to Global United Media.\n\n\nScreenings and statistics\nK.G.F: Chapter 1 received a U/A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification in early December 2018. It was reported that the film would be released to 1,800–2,200 screens worldwide, the widest ever release for a Kannada film. However, it was later reported that the film was released to 2,460 screens, including 1,500 for the Hindi version, 400 each for Kannada and Telugu, 100 for Tamil and 60 for Malayalam.\nThe advance booking for the shows were started on 16 December 2018, and saw a tremendous response upon its initial bookings.

The film released in Malaysia on 28 December and in United Kingdom on 4 January 2019.\nThe Hindi-dubbed version of the film was released to 71 screens in Pakistan on 11 January and became the first Kannada film to be released there, although Lucia (2013) was screened at film festivals and had no theatrical release in the country.\n\n\nFilm festivals\nKGF was screened at the 11th Bengaluru International Film Festival on 28 February 2019, where it received an award for the Best Picture in the Entertainment category, and was adjudged the most popular Kannada film by the jury members.\n\n\nLawsuit\nOn 20 December 2018, the 10th Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate court in Bengaluru had passed an interim stay before the film's release, following two petitions, filed by Venkatesh G, Yogesh and Ratan, citing plagiarism allegations, and also accusing the filmmakers of portraying Kolar's history in a poor light. However, the producer Kiragandur stated that the film will be released on the said date, and asked fans to avoid rumours. On 27 December 2018, the filmmakers issued a statement that the shows in Australia were cancelled due to an unauthorized screening, as the distributors of the film did not consult the producers of the original.\n\n\nPiracy\nOn 18 December 2018, a few scenes from the film were leaked on social networking sites, although Karthik Gowda, the executive producer, labeled it a rumour and clarified that the filmmakers have created a team to fight against online piracy.

While its story plot, cinematography, action sequences, music, narration, direction and cast performances of the ensemble cast received acclaim, critics had mixed comments about the screenplay and editing. However the film's dialogues became famous worldwide, especially Yash and Anant Nag's dialogues.\nReviewing for Deccan Herald, Vivek M. V. felt that the \"grandeur\" lay in the film's \"fantastically gripping story\". He praised the film's narration, its \"brilliant\" editing, and \"riveting sequences\". Sunayana Suresh of The Times of India gave the film rating of 3+1⁄2 stars out of five, writing that it had a \"fast-paced first half ... but the second half and the climax sets up the right premise for the second part of the film.\" She called the screenplay's \"non-linear\" fashion the \"most interesting part of the film\". She commended Yash's performance, in that he \"lives his character to the fullest\". Troy Ribeiro of News18 echoed her sentiment, writing, \"Yash's endurance, strife and sincerity ... get projected as perfunctory\" in the context of \"tight close-ups and mid-shots the camera stops us from getting emotionally connected to\" every actor in the film. He further wrote, \"With intense atmospheric lighting, every frame in the film looks aesthetic and natural. Brilliant cinematography and equally challenging action sequences are put together with razor-sharp edits. They give the film a racy pace.\" Priyanka Sundar of Hindustan Times called the film a \"story of greed and redemption\" that \"burns bright\". While praising the \"promising\" background score, \"sharp\" editing, and \"stunning\" visuals, she felt that the screenplay could have been \"tighter\".\nJanani K. of India Today felt the film was \"dragged and over-stretched\", and gave it a three out of five-star rating. While she commended Yash's \"extraordinary performance\" and the \"brilliantly choreographed stunt sequences\", she wrote that despite having \"universal theme, [the film] gets lost in translation, thanks to sloppy editing and atrocious dialogues.\" Subha J. Rao of Firstpost gave the film a similar rating, and praised the film's music, cinematography, and art direction, particularly the latter in \"bringing alive the grime and heat of the gold mines\". However, she felt \"[t]ighter editing ... would have smoothened out the kinks\" in the film. Shashiprasad S. M. of Deccan Chronicle scored the film 2+1⁄2 stars out of five, describing the film as \"a visual spectacle\". Barring that, he felt it fell short of \"instilling the much-needed life into it.\" Karthik Keramalu of Film Companion felt that the film fell short of \"becoming a great movie by a long mile\". He dismissed the dialogue delivered by Yash's character as a \"lengthy sermon about his own valour\", while also criticizing the film's editing.\nExcluding what he described the film's climax as \"spectacular with the support of a brilliant cast\" and \"spot-on\" sets and location, Muralidhara Khajane of The Hindu felt there was \"nothing in the film that we have not seen before\". While writing that \"[t]here is a certain finesse to the edgy, moody cinematography\", he concluded that the film lacked a \"soul, a believable story, and a rounded protagonist.\" Manoj Kumar R. of The Indian Express scored the film 2+1⁄2 stars out of five, deeming it \"[a]n overstretched exercise in hero worship\". While drawing comparisons of certain scenes to those from Baahubali, he felt the film had a \"flimsy storyline\", which he added was made up for by its \"terrific background orchestra\". Also writing for the same news publication, Shubhra Gupta drew comparisons of the film in plot to those of Nayakan, Deewaar, and Parinda in its first half. She felt that the film had \"nothing more\" than \"striking cinematography, and the brown and sepia colours which suffuse the screen.\"\nThe character of Rocky was well received by critics. Janani K. of India Today said that \"You take a look at [Rocky] and instantly you know that this guy will do the impossible and pull people out of their misery.\" Sunaina Suresh of The Times of India said that \"The growth of Rocky is shown steadily and the makers kept a clever story telling pattern right through that keeps pace with the narrative.\" Suresh further added: \"The first chapter shows Rocky as the maverick mastermind who will stop at nothing in order to achieve his mission.\" Troy Ribeiro of News18 said that \"Rocky is the new Superhero in the town.\"\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\nSequel\n\nBefore the release of the first K.G.F film in December 2018, the filmmakers shot 20% of its second installment, with the crew doing double shifts till January 2019. The film has Yash and Srinidhi Shetty reprising their roles from the first film, while Sanjay Dutt and Raveena Tandon were cast in pivotal new roles. The shooting of the film kick-started on 13 March 2019.\nK.G.F: Chapter 2 was originally scheduled to hit theatres on 23 October 2020, but its release was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India.
