  "extract": "Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (transl. One With Strong Arms) is a 2017 Indian Telugu-language epic action film directed by S. S. Rajamouli, who co-wrote the script with V. Vijayendra Prasad. It was produced by Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni under the banner Arka Media Works. The cast includes Prabhas in a dual role, alongside Rana Daggubati, Anushka Shetty, Tamannaah Bhatia, Ramya Krishna, Sathyaraj, Nassar and Subbaraju. It is both the sequel and the prequel to Baahubali: The Beginning, as well as the final installment in the  Baahubali film duology. The film is set in fictional medieval India and centers on the rivalry between siblings Amarendra Baahubali and Bhallaladeva. Bhallaladeva conspires against Amarendra, leading to his death at the hands of Kattappa. Years later, Amarendra's son (Mahendra or Sivudu) seeks to avenge his father's demise. The film was primarily shot in Telugu, with a limited number of close-up scenes also filmed in Tamil for select actors.\nThe film was produced on an estimated budget of ₹250 crore, making it the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release. Production began on 17 December 2015 at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. The cinematography was handled by K. K. Senthil Kumar, with editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao, and Tammiraju. The production design was created by Sabu Cyril, while the action sequences were choreographed by King Solomon, Lee Whittaker, and Kecha Khamphakdee. Visual effects were designed by Makuta VFX, with contributions from Adel Adili and Pete Draper. The music and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani. The film was released on 28 April 2017 in Telugu, Tamil, Hindi, Kannada and Malayalam, and later dubbed in Japanese, Russian and Chinese. It was available in conventional 2D and IMAX formats and was the first Telugu film to release in 4K High Definition format.\nBaahubali 2 was one of the most anticipated films of 2017, primarily due to the massive cliffhanger ending of its predecessor. The film premiered on over 9,000 screens worldwide, with 6,500 screens in India, setting a record for the widest release of an Indian film. Upon its release, Baahubali 2 like its predecessor, received widespread acclaim for its direction, storytelling, cinematography, themes, visual effects, music, action sequences, and performances. The film grossed over ₹1810.60 crore worldwide, briefly becoming the highest grossing Indian film of all time, surpassing PK (2014). It collected approximately ₹792 crore worldwide within the first six days and became the first Indian film to gross over ₹1,000 crore. Within India, it set numerous records, becoming the highest-grossing film in Hindi, as well as in its original Telugu language. As of 2025, Baahubali 2 remains the highest-grossing film in India. It is currently the highest grossing Telugu film, the highest grossing South Indian film, and the second highest-grossing Indian film worldwide. The film sold over 10 crore tickets during its box office run, marking the highest estimated admissions for any film in India since Sholay (1975). It also ranks among the top 50 highest-grossing non-English films globally.\nBaahubali 2, along with its predecessor, is regarded as one of the most influential films in Indian cinema. It set new standards in large-scale filmmaking with its high budget, expansive action sequences, and franchise-building approach. The film won the Saturn Award for Best International Film and three National Film Awards, including Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment, Best Special Effects, and Best Stunt Choreographer. It also fetched the state Gaddar Award for Best Feature Film. The Baahubali franchise also pioneered the pan-Indian film movement of dubbing the same film in multiple languages instead of remaking it. A combined recut version of The Beginning and The Conclusion, titled Baahubali: The Epic, was theatrically released worldwide on 31 October 2025.\n\n\nPlot\n\nKattappa continues Amarendra Baahubali's tale. After his victory over the Kalakeyas, Baahubali is declared heir apparent with Bhallaladeva as his commander. Sivagami sends him on a tour of the kingdom in disguise with Kattappa, while she selects a suitable queen for him. During the journey, Baahubali witnesses Princess Devasena of Kuntala bravely repelling attackers, leading to an admiration for her. In disguise, he approaches her and is accepted into the royal palace of Kuntala as a guard.\nBhallaladeva views Devasena's portrait and Sivagami assures their marriage, sending an emissary to Kuntala. Devasena rejects the proposal, and Bijjaladeva tricks Sivagami into ordering Baahubali to capture Devasena. In Kuntala, Baahubali and Kattappa defend the palace from an attack alongside Devasena and her cousin Kumara Varma. Kattappa then reveals Baahubali as the future King of Mahishmati, and Baahubali proposes Devasena for marriage, who agrees. As the misunderstanding is brought to light, Sivagami orders Baahubali to choose between the crown and Devasena, who then chooses Devasena. As a result, Bhallaladeva is crowned King, with Baahubali as his commander, though Baahubali retains his fame with the people.\nWhen Devasena is pregnant, Bhallaladeva removes Baahubali from his position and appoints Sethupathi, a court official. Devasena disagrees publicly with the decision and asks Baahubali to ascend the throne as a gift to her. Baahubali and Devasena are later banished, when Baahubali kills Sethupathi for offending Devasena.\nThreatened by Baahubali's unwavering popularity, Bhallaladeva and Bijjaladeva conspire to turn Sivagami against him. Bijjaladeva convinces Kumara Varma that Devasena and her child's lives are in danger, who then unsuccessfully tries to assassinate Bhallaladeva. Sivagami, believing that the assassin was sent by Baahubali, secretly orders Kattappa to kill him. Kattappa lures Baahubali into a secluded place and assassinates him. Bhallaladeva exposes himself as the mastermind behind the plot, and Kattappa conveys this to Sivagami, to her regret. As Devasena arrives with her newborn son, Sivagami declares Baahubali's son Mahendra as the new King. Bhallaladeva however turns the guards against her and she is forced to flee with Mahendra. Bhallaladeva rules for the next twenty-five years as a tyrannical King, and imprisons Devasena who starts to build a funeral pyre for him.\nWhen Kattappa finishes the tale, Sivudu (Mahendra) decides to declare war on Bhallaladeva, assembling the tribals, the resistance and Mahishmati's slave army led by Kattappa. The army lays siege to Mahishmati, while Mahendra breaches the city walls with Kattappa. He engages Bhallaladeva in a brawl as the army continues the assault, and pins him on Devasena's funeral pyre with chains. Devasena burns Bhallaladeva alive, ending his reign. Mahendra is crowned the new King of Mahishmati with Avantika as his queen, and pledges to uphold peace and justice. It ends with Mahendra saying, \"Idi naa maata. Naa maate shasanam (This is my word. My word is the law.).\" \n\n\nCast\n\n\nProduction\n\nBaahubali 2: The Conclusion was produced in the Telugu film industry. Unlike the first film, Baahubali 2 was shot primarily in Telugu; however, only certain close-up shots and dialogue scenes—mainly those involving Ramya Krishna, Nassar, and Sathyaraj—were additionally filmed in Tamil to improve lip-sync for the Tamil release. As of July 2015, the film series was considered the most expensive in India. \nRajamouli's father V. Vijayendra Prasad who wrote stories for most of his films once again gave the story for Baahubali. The series was produced by Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni. R. C. Kamalakannan was chosen as visual effects supervisor and Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was the editor. PM Satheesh was the sound designer and stunt sequences were coordinated by King Solomon, Lee Whittaker, and Kecha Khamphakdee. The film's costume designers are Rama Rajamouli and Prasanthi Tripuraneni. The line producer was M.M Srivalli. The film shooting started on 17 December 2015 at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad with Prabhas and Ramya Krishna. The film featuring actors Prabhas and Rana Daggubati in the lead roles became the biggest ever movie in India in terms of scale of production and making as of 2017. The film is also known by the abbreviation BB2. Sabu Cyril was the production designer and Peter Hein was the choreographer. R. C. Kamalakannan was the VFX supervisor and was assisted by Pete Draper and Adel Adili, co-founder of Makuta VFX. In order for the lip sync to not be noticeable when dubbed in various languages, the film featured less dialogues and more action scenes.\n\n\nCasting\nPrabhas was cast as main lead of the film. Anushka Shetty was cast as the lead actress of the film as she was also a part of Mirchi (2013). She coincidentally became the first heroine Rajamouli repeated in his films and thus made her schedules full for 2013 and 2014. Rana Daggubati was cast as the antagonist of the film and coincidentally he was also a part of Rudhramadevi.\nActor Nassar was selected to play a supporting role. Charandeep was selected to play the brother of the film's chief villain. On 20 December 2013 a press release stated that Tamannaah Bhatia will be starring in the film playing the role of \"Avanthika\". Meka Ramakrishna was picked for the head of the Kuntala guerillas.\n\n\nCharacters and looks\nRana Daggubati was said to be playing the role of Prabhas' brother and he too underwent a lot of physical transformation satisfying the role he was assigned to play in the film. He also underwent training in martial arts under the supervision of a Vietnamese trainer, Tuan. Sathyaraj has a tonsured look for his role in the film. In the end of October 2013, Rana appeared at a fashion show with a beefed up body which, according to him, was a part of his look in the film. In mid-May 2014, reports emerged that Anushka would play a pregnant woman for a few sequences in the second part of the film.\nAt the same time, Prabhas posted on his Facebook page that he underwent minor shoulder surgery and would join the film's sets in a span of a month.  On 1 June 2014, Prabhas and Rana's trainer Lakshman Reddy, said that Prabhas started his training 8 months before the commencement of shooting and after two years, both of them weighed nearly 100 kilos each. He also added that Prabhas has two attires with a heavy, bulky body for Baahubali's role and a lean physique for the second role. For his look, Prabhas met WWE superstars like The Undertaker in February 2014 and interacted with them about their daily regimen and workouts.\nPrabhas had equipment costing ₹1.5 crore shipped to his home, where he built a personal gym. His breakfast included 40 half-boiled egg whites blended and added with protein powder. In mid-June 2014, Tamannaah Bhatia regarding her role in the film,  said that she would be playing the role of a warrior princess named Avanthika and her appearance in the film is completely different when compared to her past films. Before joining the film's shoot, Bhatia did costume trials for the film which she confirmed in her micro-blogging page stating \"I am very excited to get on to the set of Baahubali. I did some dress trials today and my look in this movie will be totally new. I have never been seen in such sort of a look till now. It will be a new role for me\". Rajamouli called Bhatia and her characterisation as a \"value addition\" to the movie. She stated that she plays Avanthika, and had a special training and diet regime. The film introduced a new language called Kiliki.\n\n\nPiracy\nOn 22 November 2016, a two-minute war sequence from the film was leaked and posted on Facebook and Twitter. The following day, the police arrested a video editor for stealing and uploading the scenes. The Deccan Chronicle, noticing the lack of punishment, felt the leak was a publicity stunt. Following this, a nine-minute war sequence supposedly from the climax was leaked. The video lacked VFX.\n\n\nThemes and influences\n\nDirector S. S. Rajamouli revealed that Baahubali is inspired by the epic Mahabharata. V. Vijayendra Prasad, the screenwriter and Rajamouli's father who wrote stories for most of Rajamouli's films, once again penned the story for Baahubali. Vijayendra Prasad revealed that Sivagami has shades of both Kunti and Kaikeyi while Devasena is a warrior like Sita. He further added that he sees Baahubali as the story of Sivagami and Devasena. He was also inspired by tales of Chandamama and Amar Chitra Katha comics.\nIn March 2017, Rajamouli said in an interview that \"Why Kattappa killed Baahubali\" is the theme of the film. The tagline \"The boy he raised, the man he killed\" was billed in a poster featuring Kattappa. Rajamouli had stated that the Mahabharata was a source of inspiration for the film. According to K. K. Senthil Kumar, the colour palette used was based on the \"mood and feel\". He contrasts different tones used within the film: warm colours for Mahishmati, cool colours for Kuntala, desaturated colours for the frame in which Baahubali is expelled.\nAccording to Chandan Gowda, a professor at the Azim Premji University, \"the social order [in the film] appears to be a varna order: Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas are named with the Shudras staying an unnamed presence,\" also noting that \"Muslims are also part of the Mahishmati kingdom\". Kathi Mahesh felt that the modules and imagery were borrowed from Indian epics like Mahabharata and called Prabhas' character \"a mix of the Pandavas put together,\" while Gowda writes that the influence is \"at best rough,\" stating that the film cannot match the \"moral depth or complexity\" of Mahabharata. He further contrasts the themes of both, writing, \"the heroes have failings and the villains redeeming virtues, making us morally ambivalent towards them both, Baahubali goes for black and white: its heroes are wholly good and the villains pure evil\". According to Gowda, the palace scenes resemble those in Ben Hur (1959) and Troy (2004) while the fight sequences are similar to the Chinese films Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000).\nCritics noticed similarities between Baahubali 2 and The Lion King, an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Hamlet (1599–1602). This similarity was also felt by fans, who created memes of the comparison.  The Indian Express makes a comparison, stating that both films are a tale of two brothers, where inhabitants suffer under a cruel ruler, who is the brother of a kind ruler. The son of the kind ruler grows in remote lands, unaware of his lineage, guided to his home by his love interest. The spouse of the kind ruler is treated badly by the cruel ruler. The son also has an advisor, who helps him realize his identity. They further note that the kind ruler and his son look similar in both films. Firstpost notes that both Bhallaladeva and Scar share a scar on one eye, and both Simba and Mahendra are introduced similarly into the world.\n\n\nMusic\n\nRajamouli's cousin M. M. Keeravani composed the music and background for the film. The Conclusion's Telugu soundtrack was released on 26 March 2017 at the pre-release event of the film at YMCA grounds. The album of the film's Hindi version was released on 5 April 2017, while the Tamil version was released on 9 April. The Malayalam version was released on 24 April 2017.\nBaahubali The Beginning is first non-English film to be screened at Royal Albert Hall in London, receives a standing ovation. The show, saw the score performed live while the epic action movie unfolded on the big screen, a special Q&A took place on stage. Baahubali franchise director S.S Rajamouli and composer M.M. Keeravani  as well as stars Prabhas, Anushka Shetty and Rana Daggubati, sat down with Rachel Dwyer for a chat.\n\n\nRelease\nInitially scheduled for release in the summer of 2016, the release date  of Baahubali 2 was postponed to November 2016 due to preparations for the international release of The Beginning in various locations. This was further pushed to 28 April 2017. At first, the joint budget of both The Beginning and The Conclusion was speculated to be around ₹2.5 billion. This was later confirmed by Rajamouli in 2015. However, the joint budget of the series was increased to ₹4.3 billion, of which ₹1.8 billion was the budget for The Beginning and ₹2.5 billion for The Conclusion. The climax of The Conclusion alone cost ₹30 crore, almost double the amount of The Beginning's climax.\n\n\nScreenings and statistics\n\nAn initial limited release of Baahubali 2 took place in most Gulf countries, including the UAE, on 27 April 2017.

Its the kind of sweeping magnum opus that Indian mythos and culture deserve. Its the biggest film we have ever made and barring a few minor glitches in CGI, this film is possibly the greatest spectacle you'll see on a big screen, in your life\". Sangeetha Devi Dundoo from The Hindu stated, \"For the most part, The Conclusion doesn't let us take our eyes off the screen. Its designed to be a cinematic celebration, one that deserves to be watched on the largest screen possible\". Anupama Subramanian of the Deccan Chronicle gave the film a 3.5/5, praising the acting of the stars while complaining about \"the lack of a solid plot' and called the ending \"predictable\".\nVishnuprasad Pillai of Asianet News gave a negative review, writing that the film \"offers nothing new... The writing from KV Vijayendra Prasad fails inspire or to do justice to an epic of such scale,\" adding that \"the dialogues at times are downright corny and plot developments cringe-worthy\". Dipanjan Sinha of Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 3/5 stars, praising the film's cinematography and special effects, but found faults with some of the female characters. Sinha stated, \"Devasena ... starts off as an ace warrior only to be tamed into someone who has to be protected\". Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 2/5 stars, noting problems with pacing and sound, writing, \"The background music is relentless, and the pitch at which the declamatory dialogues are delivered is deafening: there were times I felt like closing my ears\". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rates the film 4.5 out of 5 and praises the performance of the cast, writing, \"Its a feast for moviegoers and has the trappings to make all generations its fan\".\nMeena Iyer from The Times of India rated it 4/5, writing: \"Just savor it. It is a visual extravaganza that India must feast on ... Prabhas is terrific as father and son. Of course, it is CGI and VFX that grab you in your seat\". Hemanth Kumar from Firstpost called it \"Rajamouli's epic drama\" and rated it 4/5. Sukanya Verma from Rediff rated the film 3.5/5, writing the film, \"continues its tradition of grandiloquence and magnitude... high drama, more than spectacle, is what lends its riveting tale of revenge and glory all its wallop and wizardry\". She also praised the film's cast and director stating, \"Equipped with a cast that's not only in tune with Rajamouli's vision but knows exactly where to hold back and when to give their all adds to Baahubali's might\". Sudhir Suryawanshi of The New Indian Express wrote that \"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is deserving of high praise if only for the visceral experience it is\".\n\n\nInternational\nIt was further featured in Rotten Tomatoes' list of Best Off the Radar Films of 2017, in which Tim Ryan writes, \"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion plays like a shotgun wedding between Ben Hur and Kung Fu Hustle, seasoned with bits of Shakespeare, Kurosawa, and Buster Keaton,\" opining, \"it's a blockbuster that's both gigantic and lighter than air\". Mike McCahill of The Guardian gave a 4/5 rating and called it \"a jaw-dropping blockbuster that combines nimble action with genuine heart\". He also stated, \"This production's triumph is the room it's granted Rajamouli to head into the fields and dream up endlessly expressive ways to frame bodies in motion. Of the many sequences here primed to cut through jadedness, perhaps the most wondrous is that which finds Baahu guiding Deva mid-battle to shoot three arrows simultaneously – a set piece that speaks both to a love of action, and love in action. The budget's big, the muscle considerable, but they're nothing compared with Baahubali's heart\".\nManjusha Radhakrishnan of Gulf News rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes, \"This is a sweeping visual spectacle filled with epic battle scenes, clashes between warring troops from Indian mythology and elephants on a rampage,\" but further added, \"There were times in the second half where you felt the computer-generated graphics took over the story. But all this is new and exotic for Indian cinema\". Shilpa Jamkhandikar of Reuters writes, \"It may not up the ante from the last film, but it doesn't let up on the pace either. For an Indian film, that is no mean feat\". J Hurtado of Screen Anarchy writes, \"It's a bit daunting because it does begin in media res immediately following the complex actions of the first film, but astute viewers will put together the pieces soon enough\".\nSimon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave the film a 4/4 rating and writes the film \"is everything I want but rarely get from superhero and big-budget fantasy movie\" adding \"the fight scenes... are so creative that they make even the most frequently abused creative shortcuts seem novel, everything from computer-generated imagery (CGI) to speed-ramping... You care what happens to the cast as they, aided by wires, hurl volleys of arrows at disposable minions and CGI animals\". Anita Iyer from Khaleej Times rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes, \"What stands out in the film is the powerful star cast. Enough has been said already about the acting prowess of Prabhas but he has an equally supportive cast to hold the film. Ramya Krishna as Sivagami, is known for her impressive acting talent and proves her mettle here. Another veteran, Sathyaraj as Katappa excels and you develop a camaraderie with him. Rana Daggubati is aptly spiteful in his portrayal of the villain... Nassar, as his father, is busy spewing venom but his role could have been meatier\".\n\n\nBox office\nBaahubali 2 grossed ₹2.17 billion on its opening day and ₹5.10 billion in its opening weekend worldwide.
