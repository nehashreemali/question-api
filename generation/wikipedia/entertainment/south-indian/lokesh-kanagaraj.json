He created the Lokesh Cinematic Universe (LCU) franchise after the commercial success of Kaithi (2019), the franchise's first installment.\n\n\nEarly life\nLokesh Kanagaraj was born in Kinathukadavu, Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu, India to a Tamil family.

He pursued his passion towards film making by participating in a corporate short film competition. The judge of the competition was Karthik Subbaraj. Impressed with his short film, he encouraged Lokesh to pursue a directorial career making films.\n\n\nCareer\nLokesh made his directorial debut with the short film, Acham Thavir (2012), which won awards for Best Director, Best Film and Best Actor at the Clubace short film festival. In 2016, his short film Kalam was included in the anthology film Aviyal, produced by Karthik Subbaraj. He directed his first feature film, Maanagaram, in 2017, followed by the 2019 action thriller Kaithi produced by Dream Warrior Pictures, with Karthi in the lead role. \nLokesh's next film, Master, released in January 2021 and starring Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi, received positive reviews and became the highest-grossing Indian film of that year.\n\nIn 2022, Lokesh directed Vikram, starring Kamal Haasan, Vijay Sethupathi and Fahadh Faasil. The film’s success, along with the establishment of the Lokesh Cinematic Universe (LCU), elevated his reputation in the industry, leading to another collaboration with Vijay on Leo (2023). It became one of the highest grossing Indian films by earning over ₹600 crore (US$71 million) worldwide and served as the third installment in the LCU franchise.\nLokesh Kanagaraj and Shruti Haasan come together for a musical project titled Inimel (2024). \nIn June 2023, Lokesh announced to conclude his directing career after completing 10 films.

He has likened himself to John Woo, who is also known mainly for directing such films. Despite this, Lokesh has expressed interest in exploring other genres such as fantasy and comedy. He has cited action films from the 1980s and 1990s as influences on his films, and has named Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino as some of his favourite directors due to their filmmaking styles. Rathna Kumar, who worked with Lokesh on Master, Vikram, and Leo, mentioned that his penchant for retro songs, violence, and hyperlink narratives in his films comes from his admiration for Tarantino. Though Lokesh's films are sometimes criticised for glorifying bloodshed and violence, he admitted that while he does try to romanticise violence, he has always had to tone down such sequences in his films to appeal to family audiences. To make his stunt sequences believable, Lokesh avoids using ropes, and believes this limitation makes the sequences look brutal and raw.\n\n\nPersonal life\nLokesh married his longtime partner Aishwarya on 8 January 2012. They have two daughters.\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nAs actor\n\n\nMusic video\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nRecurring collaborations\nEditor Philomin Raj and art director Sathees Kumar has worked on all films.
