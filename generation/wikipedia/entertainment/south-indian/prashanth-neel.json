He debuted with the Kannada action-thriller Ugramm (2014) and later directed the KGF franchise (2018–present), whose second part became the highest-grossing Kannada film of all-time. Subsequently, Neel had his maiden Telugu film release with Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire (2023).\n\n\nPersonal life\nPrashanth Neelakantapuram was born on 4 June 1980 in a Telugu family  settled in Bangalore. His parents are Subhash and Bharathi, and their family hails from Neelakantapuram village, near Madakasira in Andhra Pradesh. He regularly visits his native place, Neelakantapuram, where his father's tomb is located. He shortened his eponymous surname to Neel.\nNeel married Likitha in 2010. The couple has a daughter and son. Neel's sister is married to actor Sriimurali, who eventually starred in Neel's directorial debut Ugramm. Neel is a first cousin of former Andhra Pradesh state minister, Raghu Veera Reddy and is also a cousin of Telugu film actor, Aadarsh Balakrishna.\n\n\nCareer\nIn an interview with a Kannada weekly magazine, Neel said he took to filmmaking initially for the need of money, following which he completed a course in the same, eventually developing interest in it. After having completed the course, he decided to cast his brother-in-law and actor Sriimurali in Aa Hudugi Neene, a screenplay that he had written during the time. After the latter expressed his concerns due to his inexperience, Neel changed his mind and began observing Srimurali's mannerisms over a period of time, and came up with the project Ugramm, an action film. The film turned out to be a massive commercial success and emerged as one of the highest-grossing Kannada films of 2014.\nReports emerged in late 2014 and early 2015 of Neel having been signed to direct three films. The first is a sequel to Ugramm, entitled Ugramm Veeram, which would feature Srimurali reprise his role from Ugramm. His next film KGF: Chapter 1 which stands for Kolar Gold Fields has Yash playing the role of Rocky, an orphan who becomes a don. The sequel KGF: Chapter 2, was scheduled for a release in July 2021, but was delayed due to the second wave of the COVID pandemic in India and was subsequently released in April 2022.\nIn December 2020, Hombale Films announced the film Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire starring Prabhas. The film's shoot began in January 2021 and was released in December 2023. In May 2021, Mythri Movie Makers and N. T. R. Arts have announced a film in collaboration with Neel and N. T. Rama Rao Jr. The film was officially began in August 2024 with the working title NTRNeel.\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nPrashanth Neel at IMDb\nPrashanth Neel on Twitter",
