But when Rocky shows his arrogance and teases Reena, Kamal gets enraged and threatens to kill Rocky, which angeres Rocky and he shoots Kamal on the spot. After this, Rocky issues orders to start work in eight hidden mines, while Vanaram, who was captured by Rocky, decides to help him.\nMeanwhile, Adheera resurfaces and kills all guards at an outpost. In a ruse to bring Rocky to Adheera, Andrews kills Desai to lure Reena outside KGF, and John abducts Reena as per Adheera's order. While trying to save Reena, Adheera shoots Rocky but spares his life, while his men roadblock all gold exports from KGF. Later, Shetty ties up with other subordinates of Andrews across India's western coast and exterminates Rocky's allies with Inayat Khalil's newfound support. Rocky vacates the mansion with Reena with excessive gold and currency from the treasury. While chaos ensues among people of KGF, Vanaram deduces that Rocky is headed for a throat clamp.\nA recuperating Rocky visits Dubai to deal in gold with Khalil, simultaneously killing Khalil's associates all over India to recapture the coast forcing Khalil to join him in business, and also buys Kalashnikovs. Rocky and his gang gravely wound Adheera and kill his henchmen at the roadblock with their newly acquired weapons. Exasperated with KGF, some central ministers had planned a no-confidence motion against the DYSS-supported government to bring Ramika Sen in power, but Rocky's henchmen threaten other ministers against the vote and the motion fails. Rocky also kills Shetty, gaining control over Bombay. Pandian warns Rocky of Sen's rising stature, but he disregards him.\nIn 1981, Ramika Sen wins the Indian general elections and becomes the Prime Minister. After CBI officer Kanneganti Raghavan briefs her about the situation in KGF, Sen authorises Raghavan to raid Rocky's warehouses. A young Ingalagi is caught spying by Rocky's henchmen, but Rocky gets impressed by his integrity. The CBI finds nothing in their raids except for a 400 gram-gold bar. Rocky retrieves it from a police station and singlehandedly destroys the police station using a DshK.\nRocky halts all exports from KGF, which strains relations with Khalil, but continues the mining. His aides trace his biological father, a drunkard who abandoned his family, and pays the unaware man to take care of Shanti's (Rocky's mother) newly shifted grave. Reena realizes she has fallen for Rocky and confesses her feelings to him, and they get married. Rocky meets with Sen and hands her a file exposing his involvement in money laundering, but she cannot consider it as almost all her party members are complicit in the corruption. Still furious after his defeat, Adheera makes his way to KGF through a secret passage with Andrews, Daya and John, supported by Khalil's armada. Just as Reena reveals her pregnancy to Rocky, Adheera fatally shoots her.\nIn the ensuing clash, Rocky's army kill Andrews and Daya, while Rocky kills John and chokes Adheera to death.
