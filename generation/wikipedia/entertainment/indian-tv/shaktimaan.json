  "extract": "Shaktimaan is an Indian Hindi-language superhero television series created and produced by Mukesh Khanna. Inspired by American superhero Superman,   the series aired on DD National from 13 September 1997 to 27 March 2005. Khanna starred as the titular superhero, who gains superhuman abilities through meditation and the five elements of nature, and his alter ego, Pandit Gangadhar Vidhyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri, a photographer for Aaj Ki Aawaz. The series also featured Vaishnavi Mahant (initially played by Kitu Gidwani) as journalist Geeta Vishwas and Surendra Pal as the primary antagonist, Tamraj Kilvish.\nThe series was widely popular and received recognition for its impact on children, with Khanna being acknowledged by Indian political leaders for his portrayal. The show was followed by Shaktimaan: The Animated Series in 2011 and a television film, Hamara Hero Shaktimaan, in 2013. In 2024, Khanna announced the revival of Shaktimaan through a teaser video.\nIn 2025, Shaktimaan made a comeback as an audio series titled Shaktimaan Returns on the audio entertainment platform Pocket FM. According to media reports, the adaptation comprises a 40-episode new storyline that expands the original universe of the superhero. The narrative takes Shaktimaan’s mission beyond fighting traditional evil, focusing instead on humanity’s greed and the reckless exploitation of nature. The series introduces a new antagonist, Mahatatva, a former guardian of balance who becomes corrupted and seeks to restore harmony to Earth—even if it means resorting to destruction. \n\n\nPlot\nHumanity existed in peace until the onset of the Kali Yuga, which brought greed and hatred, leading to its decline over 6,000 years. To restore balance, a mystical sect of saints known as the Suryanshis chose a man to rise against evil and protect society. He was trained in Kundalini Yoga to awaken his seven chakras, granting him mystical and supernatural abilities. As part of his training, he underwent the ritual of death, immersing his body in holy fire to attain complete control over his powers. When the five natural elements—fire, earth, water, wind, and sky—infused his being, he transformed into a superhuman. With his newfound powers, he vowed to eradicate corruption and injustice. Recognising his heroic deeds, journalist Geeta Vishwas named him Shaktimaan.\nIt is later revealed that Shaktimaan is the reincarnation of Shri Satya, a member of the Suryanshi Sect from the Mahabharata era 5,000 years ago. To maintain his secret identity, he assumes the persona of Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri, a comical and eccentric photographer who speaks in formal Hindi.\nShaktimaan's greatest adversary is Tamraj Kilvish, the embodiment of darkness and evil, who seeks to spread corruption and chaos.\n\n\nCast\n\n\nProduction\n\n\nDevelopment\nMukesh Khanna conceived Shaktimaan in 1981 while working on a film with Rajshri Productions. He shared the idea with producer Rajkumar Barjatya, and they planned to develop it as a film titled Aakash, but the project did not progress. Khanna later revived the concept under his own production banner, Bheeshm International, named after his acclaimed role as Bheeshma in Mahabharat (1988–1990).\nIn a 1997 interview with Screen, Khanna explained that the growing popularity of superhero content among children influenced his decision to create Shaktimaan. Observing his nephew's fascination with animated superhero shows, he saw an opportunity to introduce an Indian superhero. He noted that while Indian mythology featured powerful figures, it lacked a dedicated superhero like Superman or Spider-Man. This led him to create Shaktimaan, a character born from a yagna and the combined energies of the universe.\nFor Shaktimaan’s alter ego, 'Pandit Gangadhar Vidhyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri', Khanna wanted a distinct, comical persona to contrast with the superhero’s powerful presence. The character’s appearance, including buck teeth and floppy hair, was inspired by American comedian Jerry Lewis.\nThe series was sponsored by Parle-G from its debut episode. In 2004, sign language interpretation was introduced for the social messages delivered at the end of episodes to make them accessible to a wider audience.\n\n\nSpecial effects\nMukesh Khanna aimed for Shaktimaan to feature the \"best-ever\" special effects on Indian television. However, after the series aired, he admitted that it fell short of his expectations. He had envisioned effects comparable to those in Superman, Independence Day: Resurgence,  Spider-Man and Terminator, but acknowledged that the availability of advanced computer graphics and trained professionals in India was limited at the time. The special effects for each episode cost ₹2 lakh, with a total expenditure of ₹10 lakh in 1997.\n\n\nRelease\n\n\nBroadcast\nShaktimaan aired for 450 episodes on Doordarshan National from 13 September 1997 to 27 March 2005. The series was later dubbed and broadcast in multiple Indian languages, including Tamil on Doordarshan Tamil (then DD Podhigai) and Chutti TV, and in Odia on Tarang. Reruns aired on STAR Utsav and Dangal TV, while a re-edited version premiered on Pogo TV in 2006, including an English-dubbed version for the network.\nIn 2019, Mukesh Khanna stated on his YouTube channel, Bheeshm International, that the series was canceled due to high broadcasting costs, which resulted in financial losses. He clarified that the decision was not influenced by concerns over children imitating stunts from the show, as was widely speculated.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Shaktimaan was re-telecast on DD National from 1 April 2020 after the suspension of ongoing productions. It was also aired on DD Retro starting 13 April 2020.\n\n\nHome media and streaming services\nThe series was released on DVD by Ultra India. The series was also launched on their YouTube channel on 17 February 2011. A Bhojpuri version was also launched on Ultra Kids Zone's YouTube channel in 2014.\nThe series was made available to stream on Amazon Prime Video in 2019.\n\n\nFictional biography\n\n\nOrigin\nShaktimaan received powers from seven gurus who trained and blessed him with \"yogic shakti which was natural power.\" He was the chosen warrior against evil by Siddha gurus of a cult named Suryanshi. They are followers of the star Sun. As part of the training, he trained with Kundalini Yoga to awake the 7 chakras of the body and gain 'supernatural' powers from them. To gain complete control over his powers, he performed the ritual of death. However, this did not cause death but made him more alive than when he was a normal man. He also performed Yajna in which he entered the fire himself and dissolved his body in the fire. Then, the five elements of life, i.e. fire, wind, water, earth, sky revived his body giving him special powers from them. Thus, after leaving his mortal body, he was given a superhuman form to fight against the evil in the world as Shaktimaan.\nAfter Shaktimaan was created, he set out to destroy his archenemy Kilvish. But, as the Mahaguru (Tom Alter) explained, Kilvish can only be defeated after evil is destroyed. Shaktimaan's mission is to destroy the sin within people, not the sinned people. Shaktimaan's adventures show him pursuing justice and saving his friends while Kilvish and his minions plot to defeat him.\n\n\nPowers\nShaktimaan has superhuman powers that lie inside his body in his seven chakras of Kundalini attained through meditation. Shaktimaan worships God through the symbol Om. Truthfulness is his motto. He can even separate his body into five different bodies of fire, wind, water, earth, and sky. He is an expert, skilled and intelligent fighter and has fought with super-skilled enemies. He possesses physical powers like unlimited speed (up to the speed of light), strength, durability as well as psychic powers like telepathy, teleportation, telekinesis, etc.\nAlthough he possesses godlike powers, his only weakness is a crystal (Papmani) possessed by Tamraj Kilvish which can be used to defeat and even kill him. This makes him powerless because it is filled with the evil of the world and is the source of the black powers. But he regains his strength after the crystal is taken away from him. He can be killed if the crystal is placed in front of him and he is treated violently to the verge of death. Shaktimaan also gets brief premonitions about the incidents that are going to happen to him in the future. This can be observed in Kashtak's episode, Geeta going to jail, and in Kapala's reappearance episodes.\nShaktimaan's powers are virtually limitless. He can do practically anything he imagines. The only limit to his powers is his own belief in himself and his knowledge of how to manifest his powers. His powers come from his chakras. (Note: Although we'll call them chakras in the Vedas, in the series dialogue they will also be called energy centers.)\nThe seven chakras in his body which give him powers are:\n\nEnergy Chakra (1): This chakra gives Shaktimaan super strength, enabling him to fly, shoot fire from his hands, emit rays from his fingertips, blow a stream of freezing air, or send out protective force fields which nothing can penetrate (provided he can maintain his willpower and not give in). Shaktimaan's strength allows him to physically penetrate anything and lift any object.\nCreative Chakra (2): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to manifest things out of thin air.\nAstral Chakra (3): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control his astral body (a semi-transparent, ethereal duplicate of himself) which can fly, walk through walls, see inside objects, etc.\nHeart Chakra (4): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control the will of others, but only for good. He can will people to do the right thing, see the error in their ways. This power is most useful when Shaktimaan needs to stop someone who is under the control of Kilvish from doing evil.\nVibration Chakra (5): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control all types of vibrations, including sound waves, light waves, healing warmth, etc. He can also use it to hear ultrasonic sounds and can speed up the vibrations of his own atoms, allowing him to transport himself in space or time. This can be very useful for getting out of dangerous situations.\nPsychic Chakra (6): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power of the \"third eye\", which enables him to read minds and see anywhere in the world at any distance. He can sense impending danger and see things at any corner of the world.\n\n\nPersonal life\nTo avoid being an easy prey of Tamraj Kilvish, Shaktimaan adopted an alter ego of Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri in the society. The character Gangadhar is completely opposite to that of Shaktimaan in all aspects, e.g. appearance, intelligence while he speaks pure Hindi. Whenever he gets an important job to do, he says that he has written a book on it which had never been published. Staying in society as a common person helped him to get knowledge about the crime. He got a job as a photographer for the newspaper Aaj Ki Awaaz after being interviewed by Geeta Vishwas. After a few weeks, he became a co-reporter working with Geeta. Through a series of incidents and the fact that he could never capture a photo of Shaktimaan, Geeta came to know about the dual identity of Shaktimaan, which was previously known only to Suryanshis. After Aaj Ki Awaaz was shut down, Gangadhar became a Hindi professor at a Tarun college. Later, he left the college to work for a news channel KR TV with Geeta.\n\n\nCharacters\n\n\nMain characters\n\n\nShaktimaan / Gangadhar Vidhyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shasthri\nActor Mukesh Khanna portrays the main character of the show Shaktimaan and his alter ego Gangadhar. In the show, Shaktimaan was depicted as a character who had attained superhuman powers through meditation and five elements of nature. He is trained by a mystical sect of saints to fight against all odds and defeat the evil prevailing within the society.\nShaktimaan's alter ego is Gangadhar, who is a funny geek. He works as a photographer in a daily newspaper office to maintain his secret identity. He is portrayed as the complete opposite of Shaktimaan.\n\n\nGita Vishwas\nGita Vishwas (Vaishnavi Mahant, previously Kitu Gidwani), the female lead in the serial, used to work as a brave news reporter in Aaj Ki Awaaz. She was the first to report about Shaktimaan in a newspaper and named the superhero Shaktimaan. Incidentally, she was the only reporter to get interviews with Shaktimaan as Gangadhar used to accompany her as a photographer on missions. She died in a crash planned by Dr. Jackal. As Shaktimaan loved her, he brought her back to life again using his power, which resulted in losing his powers temporarily due to his against the nature actions. Gita came to know about this after Shaktimaan regained power with the vow that he will never repeat the same mistake again. To ensure this, she planned to leave the country. In the lead up to that situation, she got to know about Shaktimaan's dual character for the third time. But unlike the first two occasions, Shaktimaan didn't erase it from Gita's memory this time as she promised to keep it secret forever.\nOne year later‡, after Aaj Ki Awaaz was shut down, its staff members persuaded Gita in returning to India to join them to release Shaktimaan comics. Later, she teamed up with Gangadhar again and joined KR TV as a television reporter while working for the comics simultaneously.\n‡ – When the journalist character Gita Vishwas was written out of the series, fan protests prompted the producers to bring her back.\n\n\nGyanesh Vishwas\nHe is a scientist who was Gita's father and Ranjit Singh's friend. He encountered Ranjit Singh while on an expedition to perform research at a mysterious valley, where he and his team were attacked by invisible figures (later revealed to be Tamraj Kilvish's servants) that shot fires at them and was rescued by Ranjit Singh. When he went to the city and returned to meet Ranjit Singh at the forest later, he found out that Ranjit Singh and the whole group of soldiers there had been killed. He writes the incidents in his diary. Many years later, Shaktimaan wanted to know more about Ranjit Singh from Gyanesh, as he didn't know Ranjit Singh was actually Shaktimaan's father and he was only raised by Pandit Vidyadhar Shastri. However, Gyanesh is killed by Dr. Jackal before it happens. Later, Gita gives Gangadhar Gyanesh's diary which helps him find out the truth.\n\n\nEnemies\n\n\nTamraj Kilvish\nTamraj Kilvish is Shaktimaan's archenemy and overall the main antagonist of the entire franchise. Tamraj means King of Darkness (Tama = darkness, raj = king) and Kilvish means shameful. He has lived 6000 years and is the source of evil in the world. He intends to rule the world by spreading darkness, hatred, sin, and evil. It is said that the source of his strength is one-half of the \"Shakti Punj\" (the half which is referred to as \"Shaktiman\") which he managed to retain after he originally obtained the entire Shakti Punj by deceit from Shri Satya (Satya means truth), the founder of the Suryavanshi. However, it is also mentioned that the source of his strength is the evil that is committed by people in this world.\nIt was later revealed that only Shri Satya can kill Tamraj Kilvish. After a death-defying adventure, Shaktimaan was told that he is the rebirth of Shri Satya. Shri Satya had given the exact time of the child's birth and the place before he died about 6000 years ago. Tamraj also knows this and this is the main reason he is frightened by the appearance of Shaktimaan as he knows that only Shaktimaan can kill Tamraj. He murdered Shaktimaan's parents and his adoptive father, Pandit Vidyadhar Shastri. He and his minion's plot to kill him but always fail. His minions include Electric-man (who can shoot lightning bolts from his body), Stone-man (who can shoot stones from his body), Plastica (who can stretch any part of her body), Dr. Jackal (an evil scientist), and others. Dr. Jackal has helped Kilvish in his various schemes by cloning Shaktimaan and also by turning aliens against him.\nIn the television series, Kilvish is often treated as the personification of darkness itself even though he was once a human being who later becomes very powerful and commits many evil deeds. In an attempt to become immortal, he left his mortal body and took an ethereal body that can't be killed but Shaktimaan is told that he has to kill all the evil in the world to destroy Tamraj's ethereal body. Kilvish's trademark quote is \"Andhera Kaayam Rahe\" (May Darkness Prevail), which is also used by his followers.\nKilvish's character evolves as the series progresses. In the beginning episodes of Shaktimaan, his face is never shown and his voice is different from the voice that he uses in the later episodes of Shaktimaan, in which his role is played by Surendra Pal. Later his face deforms to become a distorted wolf-like face.\n\n\nDr. Jackal\nDr. \"Jackal\" Vishvamitra Shandilya is an evil scientist who works for Kilvish. His earlier intention was not that of becoming evil. However, when he was denied scholarship for research, Kilvish provided him with funds and labs; this made him a supporter of Kilvish and helped him become an evil scientist.\nThough he is overall a brilliant scientist, his specialisation is cloning and various energy rays. His creations against Shaktimaan include Kekda Man (a clone formed by fusing cells of crab and human), followed by Jonk Jonkaa (a clone using leech), an evil clone of Shaktimaan, Plastica, Lightman, 3D image, Super-heroine Sunanda and others. He also invented a height control solution and fictional EC- rays.\n\n\nSahab\nSahab is an organised criminal and drug lord. Like Shaktimaan he also possesses a double identity, the other being that of a law-abiding industrialist and Mayor, known as Kumar Ranjan. Except for Tamraj Kilvish (and later Dr. Jackal), no one knows that Sahab and Kumar Ranjan are the same people, thus making this his biggest strength. Through his criminal mind, Sahab keeps plotting ways to create trouble for Shaktimaan or to defame him and to find out about the real identity of Shaktimaan.\n\n\nOther antagonists:\nKakodar\nKakodar is a sorcerer with the visage of a devil who was imprisoned in a statue nearly five hundred years ago. He could only be freed if a good person removes a thread from his neck. It is unclear whether he was cursed by an enemy or punished by Tamraj to end up imprisoned. In the present day, the mayor of Mumbai, Jai Kumar Janardhan a.k.a. JJ (Nawab Shah) was deceived by his personal assistant Mathur (Deepak Bhatia) to break the thread and free him. Mayor JJ died in shock at seeing Kakodar's true form. As instructed by Mathur, Kakodar possessed JJ's body and decided to spread Andhera (darkness).\nHe was the primary supervillain in the first part of the series as he uses JJ's wealth and power to hatch plots to kill Shaktimaan but always failed. Unlike most of the other assailants of Shaktimaan, he is very sharp and analytical. He even tries to approach Tarendra, an all-knowing sentient being of light, to know the truth about Shaktimaan. He is cunning enough to be able to use mental manipulation to trick Shaktimaan on occasion. This put the hero into a dilemma, and self-doubt drained him of his powers temporarily.\nThe full extent of his powers is not revealed. On an occasion, JJ's girlfriend Zuby realises that JJ is possessed by a demon and tries to reveal him in public. He uses hypnosis to drive her mad so that the public will ignore her statements. He has a potent and fatal poison inside him that he can spit out of his mouth which affects everyone except Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan and Kakodar end things in a fight when Kakodar turns into his real form and Shaktimaan turns him back to a statue.\n\nNatasha\nNatasha (Portrayed by Sunila Karambelkar) was also a demonic evil woman sent by Kilvish. Along with Mathur, she serves JJ/Kakodar. She was JJ's secretary before he was possessed. She has the ability to change her appearance. She kills a C.B.I. officer and takes her appearance to interrogate Gangadhar and Geeta on one occasion. Her powers were greatly diminished due to Shaktimaan defeating Kakodar. To regain the power she and Mathur decide to sacrifice Shaktimaan. For this they kidnap the son of a scientist to get the formula of invisible man which may help to defeat Shaktimaan.\n\nMathur\nMathur (Deepak Bhatia) is one of the two trusted demonic accomplices of JJ/Kakodar along with Natasha. He initially served JJ as his personal assistant (PA) before he was possessed, but was secretly preparing the stage for Kakodar's entry under Tamraj's directions. His true identity is revealed after Kakodar is released from his imprisonment. Not many of his powers are revealed in the series. He has the ability to change his appearance at will, but not shapeshift to assume someone else's body. He also loses his powers when Kakodar was defeated by Shaktimaan.\n\nElectric-man\nHe was the first synthetic villain faced by Shaktimaan. Dr. Chandola, an evil scientist, created him. Dr. Chandola claims that the Electric man was his son, whom he killed so that he can resurrect the dead body with electricity. When he comes to life he kills Dr. Chandola. Without recognising a friend from a foe he kills everyone in his path and spreads destruction in the city. His powers include shooting electricity from eyes and electrocution on contact. Finding him difficult to restrain, Shaktimaan grabs him and tunnels deep into the earth, pushing him deep underground.\n\nKapala\nKapala is a corrupted Tantrik who serves Tamraj Kilvish. His primary skill is his shapeshifting to inanimate objects such as vehicles and weapons. He also has many other magical devices and servants under his control. One such device is a metal plate he wears around his neck that has the power to steal his opponent's strength. The villain Stone man was created from his magic skull. Shaktimaan destroys both the metal plate and the magic skull. He has an odd sense of humour as he makes jokes while fighting Shaktimaan. There are occasions where he serves as comic relief. This is in contrast to other villains who are stark and serious. He also has a very fragile ego and falls victim to taunts. His main accessory is a trident. Shaktimaan eventually turns him into stone and shatters him at one instance. However, in later episodes of Shaktimaan, he is shown resurrected back to life. He is played by Faqir Nabi.\n\nKhali-Bali\nKhali and Bali are two dwarvish green and red imps. Their names originate from the Urdu word Khalbali which means commotion. Throughout their appearances, they constantly argue and reconcile with each other over inane reasons. They claim to eat humans but there is no evidence regarding the same. They can combine to form a single full-size demon. This demon wears green and red garb. Their power is insignificant when they are separated but when they both combine they become as physically strong as a full-fledged demon. Not much is shown regarding any psychic powers they possess.\n\nKashtak\nDuring an archaeological dig in the qila(fort) at Bhangdu Khati, the lead archaeologist Prof. Hussain and his assistant Hema discover a sarcophagus and a mysteriously untarnished sword made out of an unknown metal in the ruins. Hema accidentally opens the sarcophagus and unleashes Kashtak, a servant of Tamraj Kilvish. Kashtak used to terrorise the world and was imprisoned nearly 2500 years ago by the curse of Komalatha, a lady sage. Geeta Vishwas turns out to be the reincarnation of Komalatha. His sword Khadgi has many powers imbued in them such as telekinesis, petrification and resurrection and control of his army. In the series, it is enhanced with the power of mind control by Tamraj. When he controls the mind of a scientist to create a weapon of mass destruction, Shaktimaan stops him .\n\nKekda Man\nKekda man (Crab man) is one of the two dangerous clones of Dr. Jackal (along with Jonk Jonkaa). He is a clone created by Dr. Jackal by fusing cells of crab and a kidnapped Suryanshi. Dr. Jackal managed to twist the mind of the pure Suryanshi to become the Kekda man. He can breathe fire which contains an extremely dangerous poison that even impeded Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan left an illusion of him behind and narrowly escaped. Because he returns with only the illusion, Kekda man is destroyed by his short-tempered creator.\n\nJonk Jonkaa\nJonk (leech) is one of the two most dangerous clones of Dr. Jackal (along with Kekda Man); He was created by fusing genes of humans and alien leech from Mars. He has the power to eat any form of matter and grow larger in size. He was killed by Geeta and the campers using salt. Shaktimaan is however captured in a flying prison in the process.\n\nEvil clone Shaktimaan\nAfter capturing Shaktimaan, Dr. Jackal makes a clone of him but twists his mind to be a servant of darkness. The evil clone is created stronger than Shaktimaan and is unleashed on the world. When the real Shaktimaan escapes his prison, he challenges the evil clone to a fight. He then captures the clone and sends him into deep space.\nLater, during the crash when Geeta and her father, Gyanesh, died, Dr. Jackal's missiles released him from his trap. He comes to the Earth searching for Shaktimaan, unable to find him as Shaktimaan had lost his power. Geeta is misled into believing the clone was the real Shaktimaan until he was killed by the real Shaktimaan who gained his power later.\n\nCatsisters\nShalaka & Shaliyaa(portrayed by Ashwini kalsekar & Dolly Minhas)\nKilvish sent Shaliyaa the white cat to kill Major Ranjith singh, However, in the process Shaliyaa failed in her attempt and cursed by kilvish as a cat. Years later kilvish Sent Shalaka the black cat to kill his son Shaktimaan with the wrong info that Shaliyaa was killed by Major Singh, so it is a chance to take revenge by his son Shaktimaan. Shalakaa captures Shaktimaan and tortures him. In the process she accidentally kills her sister, thinking the cat was Shaktimaan's supporter, and it is revealed that the whole time kilvish was lying to her. She leaves Shaktimaan and heads to Kilvish to kill him. However, she is stabbed and killed by Kilvish.\n\nTeemiraa\nTeemira (portrayed by Annu Kashyap) was another devil magician sent by Tamraaj to kill Shaktimaan in childhood but she failed. Tamraaj tortured her in a fire for several years for this. Later he again gives her a chance to kill Shaktimaan with a warning but Teemiraa was planning to kill both Shaktimaan and Tamraaj Kilvish. She drinks Human blood like a vampire so that she can maintain her charm and be young always. She kidnaps and tortures Geeta Vishwas and takes her form as an identity to set trap for Shaktimaan for making him as a partner, in the process kilvish kills her for her misbehaves.In 2005 Diamond Comics\nShaktimaan issue \"Paap Samraat\" has a more detailed story with the encounters of teemira and baby Gangadhar.\n\nMatandeeka\nShe was a devil creature who works for Kilvish, she hitches somebody on-road and kills him brutally by taking his spirit. She wants to become powerful, so she goes in front of Kilvish for her request. Kilvish tells her to Kill Shaktimaan and she will become what she wants. Her look was mostly similar to Teemiraa, she wears a red dress and also the background score of Teemiraa was played on her.\n\nToyman\nToyman's character was played by Brij Mohan Pandey. He is mentally a psycho lover who kills his love interest Shailaa after she lodged a complaint against him to the police. To make more profit, he made toys using low-priced colours which are harmful to children, causing death to many children and he was jailed after Shailaa reported it. He killed Shailaa on returning from Jail. Later he created dangerous toys as weapons to destroy Shaktimaan.\n\nKalushaah\nShe is a devil woman, running her black world as an agent of Tamraj Kilvish. She is so cruel that she kills her own servants who can't do her given work. She made the jungle of Karadunga, her penthouse, a mysterious place so that no one can come there. Once, she attacked Shaktimaan's father Ranjeet Singh when he tried to investigate the secrets of Karadunga. Later, Shaktimaan ruins her world, leaving her no way but to flee.\n\nMaharani Mayadri\nHer role was played by actress Sunila Karambekar as a villain. She enters when Shaktimaan, Dwijj, Geeta time-travel upon centuries Diamond Comics collect chakra, but they were unable as Queen Mayadri makes them her hostages. She thought of the Shaktimaan as Satya, the Mahaguru, who was once a king but later became a priest as he loves the environment of the forest. His fighting skills make maharani fell in love with him and she proposes to Satya, but he rejects her. It makes her angry and so psycho that she creates her own world where she rules like a queen.

Shaktimaan wants the time machine remote from Maharaniji which she stole from him while kidnapping Geeta and Dwijj to an unknown place. Shaktimaan requests Maharaniji to return the remote and free both hostages. For her love, she shows both Geeta and Dwijj. Later Maharaniji attacked Geeta with her magical dangerous rays so cruelly that she can be dead. What happened then is shown in the remaining episode.\n\nBehroopia\nShe has the power to shapeshift to any appearance. On one occasion, she changes her appearance to that of Shaktimaan and engages in a fake fight to defame Shaktimaan. Later she again changes her shape to that of Geeta Vishwaas to give mislead people through an interview on television about Shaktimaan.

He converts her to a superwoman and uses her to destroy Shaktimaan's status with another devil woman Behroopia. Later Sunanda changes heart and surrenders after seeing the reality of Kilvish and Jaikaal.\n\nKitanuman\nKitanuman is an extremely dangerous green-coloured creature completely made from germs and is also one of the servants of Tamraj Kilvish. Thousands of years ago, Shri Satya turned him into a statue, and later he gets freed from the statue and spreads germs so badly and turn each and every child of the world into old men. Kitanuman was one of the most dangerous and difficult devils to defeat Shaktimaan and had a really tough time with him. However, later Shaktimaan kills him using his own germs.
