He then conceived the idea of Delhi Crime during a conversation with Neeraj Kumar, the former Commissioner of the Delhi Police, who introduced him to the investigating team and provided access to several legal documents that were prepared as part of the investigation. Later on, Kumar asked Mehta if he would consider making a film on the case to which he denied. He then started reading the documents and was \"amazed at the precision with which this case was solved, and so quickly.\" He also met the officers involved in the case and was \"blown away by them.\" Mehta also sought permission from the victim's family. He said that films like The French Connection (1971) and Zodiac (2007) influenced his approach.\nHe modeled several portrayals of the cops based on his own observations. Mehta said that the making of the series was a \"personally transformative journey\" for him. He spoke to several police personnel involved in the case and tried \"retracing the paths that the police took during the course of the investigation.\" It took Mehta six years to finish his research, adding that the writing part of the film which began in 2014 took place for more than four years, since he had to meet the cops and had to return to Canada to put his research work altogether, which took him more time. Mehta initially wanted to make it as a feature film, but as he continued the research, he realised that he could not fit the content in that length.\n\n\nCasting\nThe casting director of the series is Mukesh Chhabra. Mehta decided to focus on actors from theatre background, without being influenced by the need to have recognised faces from Hindi film industry. Shefali Shah, Rajesh Tailang, Adil Hussain and Rasika Dugal were a part of the prominent cast members in the series, with whom Mehta worked in their first feature film Amal (2007). When Mehta spoke to Chhabra he stated that he had a little time to process the completion, so Mehta did not agree to cast star actors in the series, which unleashed Chhabra's imagination. He also added that the rise of streaming platforms had given much recognition to \"some of the best acting talent in the world that comes from India\".\nThe character of Vartika Chaturvedi (Shefali Shah) was based on Chhaya Sharma, the former deputy commissioner of police in Delhi. Mehta met Sharma, who was in the team who caught the perpetrators. They spoke for months as Mehta wanted her point of view in the crime. Shefali Shah agreed to don the character after Mehta's narration spanned for five minutes and also met Sharma for the preparation of the role. Tailang's character was an amalgamation of different investigating officers, but he spoke to one police officer and used him as reference point.\n\n\nFilming\nThe series spans six days, covering the period between 16 December and 21 December 2012, from the incident to the final arrest. The film went on floors in Delhi in January 2018 after taking permission from the Delhi police and the victim's family, and was shot over the course of 62 days. Mehta decided not to show the rape on screen as he wanted \"not to cross that line into exploitation.\" To make the experience more cathartic for the audience, director Richie Mehta revealed that they used handheld cameras on purpose. He says, \"We wanted the audience like they are a part of our narrative and all that was happening on the sets. To make them feel more inclusive, we have shot those scenes with a handheld camera.\"\nThe shooting commenced in Delhi, mostly on the roads and no sets were used. Neeraj Kumar, for whom Mehta conceived the idea of the script stated that he advised the producers not to involve my successors who would neither approve of the project nor would they give any support, since the case was their predecessor's — a common failing observed in the police. Thus, the entire shoot was done almost without formal permissions.\nBefore the shoot, Kumar called the entire cast including Shefali Shah, to brief them about police hierarchy, the rank structure, body language of the police and the works so as to find the series to be an authentic depiction of the police on account of these briefings. Kumar has not visited the shooting spot, with the exception of one scene at the India Gate because his visits to the locales would have spread the word that he was getting Delhi Crime being made for his glorification.\n\n\nRelease\nThe first two episodes of the series was premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival at the Indie Episodic Category, held on 23 January to 3 February 2019. Netflix acquired the streaming rights of the show later, and on 14 February, with the official announcement of their new original contents (including series and films) for their 2019 original slate, the makers confirmed their scheduled release of 22 March 2019. The official trailer of this series was unveiled on 11 March 2019. The show was released on Netflix on 22 March.\nDelhi Crime season 2's official trailer was released on 8 August 2022.Delhi Crime Season 2 premiered on 26 August 2022 on Netflix. The entire season, consisting of 5 episodes, was released simultaneously worldwide. It is available in multiple languages, including Hindi, English, Telugu, and Tamil, with subtitles.\n\n\nReception\n\n\nSeason 1\nThe first season received universal acclaim upon its release. On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 92% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 7.25/10.\nDaniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"consistently different enough to be interesting.\" He also felt the police-procedural conventions felt \"reasonably fresh and consistently engaging.\" Ben Travers of IndieWire wrote: \"An expertly told, hard-to-watch true crime series, Delhi Crime Story won't be for everyone — but it won't let go of anyone who watches.\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote: \"Where Delhi Crime scores is in the portrayal of a beleaguered police force, which is easy to point fingers at.\"\nSaibal Chatterjee of NDTV called the series \"grim, gritty and grounded in the everyday.\" He further wrote: \"Delhi Crime is a knockout punch of a series: unsettling and enthralling by turns.\" Piyasree Dasgupta of HuffPost noted that the series \"comes across as such an elaborate exercise to valorise the Delhi Police that it actually seems deeply insensitive.\" She also said that the \"only people the show humanises are the police.\" Rahul Desai of Film Companion wrote: \"It's the tiny infusions of well-informed opinion into what is essentially dramatic long-read reportage that make Delhi Crime one hell of a ride.\" Rohan Naahar of Hindustan Times called it: \" gut-wrenching, stylishly directed, passionately performed, and most important, not at all exploitative.\" Avinash Ramachandran of The New Indian Express – Cinema Express in his review wrote: \"Delhi Crime might be a glorification of the police force, but it is also a mirror to our society. It might absolve the Delhi police of its alleged dereliction of duties, but it is also a reminder that we vouched, and hoped, for a similar incident to never happen again.\"\nAlong with the story telling and the premise of the series, the cast also received widespread appreciation for their performances in the series. Priyanka Roy of The Telegraph said: \"And while the rest of it is worth a watch, Shefali Shah is reason number one why you shouldn't give Delhi Crime a miss.\" Nandini Ramnath from Scroll wrote: \" Rajesh Tailang, Anurag Arora, Adil Hussain, Jaya Bhattacharya, Gopal Dutt and Vinod Sharawat are among the numerous actors who display the same dedication to their craft as did their fictionalised selves to the investigation.\" Namrata Joshi from The Hindu said: \"Tailang's control, poise and measured way plays out beautifully against Shah's dynamism to give us arguably the best on-screen buddy-cop team seen yet in India.\"\n\n\nSeason 2\nThe second season of Delhi Crime has an 82% rating based on 11 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, and has an average audience rating of 7.6/10.

He highlighted the series' ability to weave \"moral dilemmas\" into its narrative without becoming didactic..Abhimanyu Mathur of Hindustan Times described it as \"more brutal and graphic\" than the first season but praised its emotional depth, stating it \"retains enough sensitivity and finesse to be one of the best shows around.\" He singled out Tillotama Shome's \"scene-stealing\" performance and the show's focus on the investigators' personal lives..Neela Debnath of Express UK clarified that while inspired by the historical \"Kachcha-Baniyan gangs\" of 1990s North India, the season fictionalizes events rather than depicting a specific case. She detailed the gang's real-life tactics, including oil-covered bodies and posing as laborers, and noted director Tanuj Chopra's research into case files and community perspectives..Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV awarded the season 4/5 stars, applauding its \"perceptive and powerful portrait of a city at war with itself.\" He noted its \"near-documentary realism\" and the layered portrayal of female characters, particularly Shah, Rasika Dugal, and Shome..Namrata Joshi of National Herald emphasized the series' examination of class conflict and police corruption, calling it \"sharp and smart\" while critiquing its occasional inauthenticity in dialogue delivery..Shweta Keshri of India Today noted that the season \"lacks the depth of the first season\" but provides a \"peek into the lives of the cops.\" She praised Shah's \"author-backed role\" and Shome's \"intense act,\" while critiquing the \"grim and dark tale\" as potentially challenging for some viewers..Udita Jhunjhunwala of Livemint praised the \"rock-solid cast\" but observed that the season \"starts slow,\" with English-language dialogues feeling incongruous in a Delhi police setting. She commended its depiction of aspirational economics driving crime..Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in offered a mixed assessment, calling the season a \"clumsy exploration of systemic bias in policing.\" She compared it unfavorably to films like Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye! and Titli, which she felt better portrayed Delhi's aspirational crime. Ramnath criticized the \"formulaic approach,\" uneven pacing, and incongruous English dialogue, adding that the show avoids addressing the Delhi Police's real-life controversies post-2019 protests..News18 highlighted the show's critique of caste and class structures, stating it \"perfectly depicts\" societal inequities through its \"talented cast.\".Sunny Mahat of The Annapurna Express lauded the series' intensity and Shome's performance, though cautioned viewers about its \"gruesome\" violence..Zee News highlighted positive social media reactions to the season, with netizens praising Shefali Shah's \"brilliant\" performance.
