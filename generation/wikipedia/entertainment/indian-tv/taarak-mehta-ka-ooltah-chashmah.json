I approached every channel, but the trend of daily soaps had just started, and saas-bahu shows dominated the scene. Whoever I approached said there was no scope for comedy every day. But I had a feeling that one-day comedies, too, would become a daily trend. Finally, in 2008, Taarak Mehta... came on the air.\"\n\n\nFilming\nThe filming for the series takes place in Film City in Mumbai. External filming for specific scenes has taken place in locations, for example: Gujarat, New Delhi, Goa and in overseas locations such as Leicester, London, Brussels, Paris, Hong Kong and Singapore.\nFrom March to June 2020, filming shut down in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India.

The show started broadcasting its new episodes from 22 July 2020. In April 2021, due to the rise in COVID-19 cases, the Government of Maharashtra suspended the shooting of films and TV shows in the state.

It completed 1000 episodes in November 2012, 2000 episodes in August 2016, 3000 episodes in September 2020 and 4000 episodes in February 2024.\nIn February 2015, Dilip Joshi, Disha Vakani, and Shailesh Lodha hosted the red carpet at the 60th Britannia Filmfare Awards to promote the Clean India campaign. In 2018, the Mudra Institute of Communications, Ahmedabad took up the show as a case study. It is also one of the most searched television series in India.\nDecoding the reason behind Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah's success, Yashika Singla of The Print stated, \"The major appeal of the television show is the idea of ethics and 'Indian values' at the very core of its scripts. To its credit, it also talked about a multitude of social issues and created awareness about them in its own light-hearted manner. It also had an age-inclusive cast that set it apart from other family dramas, beyond the confines of a typical female-audience focusing saas-bahu serial.\"\n\n\nControversies\nThe show faced a controversy in 2020 when Neha Mehta left the show, stating that: I do feel that in many areas discipline and decorum was not maintained on the sets. In 2022, she claimed that producers of the show have not cleared her dues after leaving the show. Neela Film Productions issued a statement: We consider our artist as our family. We have contacted Neha Mehta multiple times to complete the formalities with us. Unfortunately, she has been reluctant to sign the exit documents without which we cannot do a full and final settlement as per company policy. She also stopped responding to all our communication from past 2 years and she left the show without meeting us. We wish she would have replied to our emails instead of making false accusations about the makers that have given her 12 years of fame and career. We reserve our rights for appropriate action. Shailesh Lodha left the show in 2022, and sued the makers of the show for being underpaid in 2023.\nJennifer Mistry Bansiwal quit the show in March 2023 accusing show producer Asit Kumarr Modi, executive producer Jatin Bajaj, and project head Sohail Ramani of sexual harassment.\nIn May 2023, Monika Bhadoriya accused Asit Kumarr Modi and project head Sohail Ramani of encouraging a hostile workplace. She further claimed that the producers have withheld the money of many artists. She also revealed that co-star Munmun Dutta argued frequently with producer Asit Kumarr Modi.\nPalak Sidhwani, who portrayed Sonu Bhide accused the producers of exploiting her. The actor disclosed that she had received a legal notice from the production, alleging that she had breached her initial contract. In an interview with Bombay Times, Palak stated that she had chosen to leave the show for professional growth and health reasons. In response, the production house issued a statement claiming that Palak had violated several important rules in her exclusive artiste agreement. They alleged that she had engaged in unauthorized third-party endorsements and appearances without obtaining the necessary written consent. Palak, however, denied these allegations, asserting that she had informed the production house of her decision to quit well in advance and had followed the proper procedures.\n\n\nAwards\n\n\nIndian Television Academy Awards\n\n\nIndian Telly Awards\n\n\nStar Guild Awards\n\n\nSee also\nList of Hindi comedy shows\nList of programmes broadcast by Sony SAB\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nTaarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah at IMDb",
