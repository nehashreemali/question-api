Satvir was the illegitimate son of Haveliram's sister Veerawali and her lover Vrishbhan. They lived in Bicchowali Gali, Lahore in 1947 during the Partition of India. During the Partition, 3/4th of the Hindu population migrated from Lahore, as the Pakistan was created, and millions of Muslims from India moved to Pakistan and Hindus from Pakistan to India, this large-scale movement of people on both sides was at times aimed at securing fundamental religious freedoms. Lajwanti sends his son Roshanlal to go to Okara to rescue Channi, Dammo, and Guru Dutt, relatives of Lajwanti's maternal family. Roshanlal's bus is looted near Shahdara Bagh. However, he reaches the DAV College Lahore Refugee Camp to save his life. Satbir goes to Gaindamal in Gawalmandi shop for his well-being. \nLala Gaindamal originally came from Mandi Bahauddin in 1900, within 4 years.\nIn 1904, he opened a shop in Anarkali Bazaar and owned a house in Kucha Radha Kishan of the Old City of Lahore. Lochan's family migrated to Shimla in July 1947, and she forced Kulbushan to migrate to East Punjab, Dominion of India, but Kulbhushan stayed in Lahore. Riots occurred in West Punjab where the Hindus were killed by the Muslim mobs. Lajwanti and sons migrated to independent India in a convoy and remember the days in 1915 when she met Master Haveliram and how Veerawali avoided relationships, coming from Montgomery and Wazirabad. Lajwanti's uncle takes her away forcefully to Lajwanti in Pindi and sells her to an old drunkard as a bride, but destiny had something else in the store, and he died at the wedding night, and she again came to Bicchowali in Lahore. Veerawali and Lajjo regularly meet each other at Shah Alami Gate. Again, Ralliyaram came with a relation from Chak Jhumra and she again denied it. Veerawali likes Vrishbhan, who was from Delhi when he came to Lahore during a business trip with Veerawali's father. Lajjo and their sons, Kulbhushan, his pregnant wife Lochan, and his daughter and son, Roshanlal and Satbir, migrated towards India. Lochan gave birth to a baby girl when she crossed the Ravi and forced Kulbhushan to meet his father who was sick in Shimla, but Satbir said that all the families of Korey Koot and most refugees migrated to New Delhi as the capital of India where the refugee camps would be in a good condition and Kulbhushan said to his mother and brothers to wait for him in Ambala. But Roshanlal said that they had a perfect livelihood and employment opportunities in Delhi rather than in Shimla. Finally, Lajjo and her sons reached the Purana Qila Refugee Camp in Delhi. At the refugee camp, Lajjo meets with many people who came as refugees in Delhi from the different cities of Punjab, Rawalpindi, Sheikhupura, and Sialkot. \nBubbly, who was from Sheikhupura, lost her parents in riots and found her relatives when she worked as a list maker in different refugee camps like Kingsway Camp, Kashmiri Gate, Subzi Mandi, and Gandhi Maidan, became the love interest of JB, but didn't marry due to misunderstanding created by Shyamlal and heartbroken, she reached to Saharanpur but reached to Calcutta for work but betrayed by Dalpat and sold to the hotel and work as a dancer and renamed as Barbie.

Haveliram, which was lost in Lahore, was found in Kashmir with the help of Nivedita Sengupta. Roshanlal received him from the Ambala Cantonment, but lost his memory but got back his memory when he again slipped from the stairs of a basement to see Habibullah, who hid himself from rioters. Haveliram was admitted to the hospital where he got his memory and asked him if he was in Mayo Hospital but Satbir told him that he was in Irwin Hospital. He then asked where Irvin Hospital was in Lahore but was told that he was in Delhi. Kulbhushan got a government quarter in Ludlow Castle, Delhi where the whole family shifted.
