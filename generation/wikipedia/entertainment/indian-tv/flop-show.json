  "extract": "Flop Show is an Indian television sitcom that first aired on DD National in 1989. The show was written and directed by satirical humorist Jaspal Bhatti, who also played himself as the main character. His wife Savita Bhatti produced the show and also acted in all the episodes as his wife. The sitcom was a satire on the socio-cultural problems faced by a common Indian at the time. Only 10 episodes of the show were produced.\nThe show was again telecast on DD National from 19 May 2020 during the lockdown due to coronavirus.\n\n\nOverview\nFlop Show has a distinctive opening sequence. It starts off with a dedication to those whom the specific episode is poking fun at. This is followed by the title song \"Flop Show\", which mocks the show itself as being misdirected. It features most of the main cast collectively playing musical instruments as a band. H. N. Singh appears as an eye-patch wearing, menacing looking director. The other cast members are dressed variously as a police inspector, a doctor, a peon, etc.\nThe show was shot completely in Chandigarh with some episodes being shot at Punjab Engineering College (Jaspal Bhatti is an alumnus of that college). The cast remained the same in every episode, although they played different characters as each episode essayed a different story.\nAnother distinctive aspect of the show is a joke in between the casting credits at the beginning and a satirically reworded popular Hindi film song played at the end of every episode, in the form of a Parody.\n\n\nEpisodes\nFollowing is the complete list of episodes:\n\n\nCast\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nFlop Show at IMDb",
