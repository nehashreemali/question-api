Shankar Nag erected a land \"replete with dancers, wrestlers, fire eaters, bangle sellers\" for the episode \"Talkative Man\". Shankar Nag and Narasimhan initially considered Mysore but since the town has become urbanized, they considered Nanjangud however they rejected it \"because of its proximity to Mysore\" then they finally zeroed in on Agumbe. Some episodes were filmed in Bengaluru and some others in Devarayanadurga located in Tumakuru district in Karnataka. One episode, \"Nitya\", was shot entirely in Devarayanadurga. Railway station scenes were shot at Arasalu village railway station.
