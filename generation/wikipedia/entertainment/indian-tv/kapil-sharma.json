In response, The Chief of BMC's vigilance department asked him the names of the people who took bribes and assured him stringent action against them. It was later revealed that Sharma himself was doing illegal activities involving construction work being done on his properties. BMC issued a stop work notice to him regarding illegal extensions on two of his bungalows in Andheri and told him to demolish illegal work within 24 hours.

He just wants to earn money and doesn't care about the country, we strongly condemn Sharma for performing during PSL\".\nIn 2018, Kapil Sharma had an argument with journalist Vicky Lalwani of SpotboyE in a recorded telephone conversation, later leaked by Lalwani. Sharma used foul language and asked the journalist his reason for writing negative and biased articles about him (Sharma). After the conversation went viral on social media, Sharma filed a police complaint against Lalwani, and his ex-managers Preeti Simoes and Neeti Simoes, for trying to extort INR 25 lakhs from him as well as alleging in a police complaint that both sisters used to take money from the people who arrived in Film City, Mumbai to see his show and orchestrated misunderstandings between him and fellow comedians of his show and arriving guests. Simoes condemned all of these allegations as false and made-up stories. Preeti Simoes also claimed she had been Sharma's girlfriend for 8 years until his engagement. She and her sister Neeti Simoes worked in Kapil Sharma's production with him for eight years until 2017. She claimed that trouble erupted between Preeti and Kapil after he announced his engagement with Ginni Chatrath in March 2017.

According to reports, an unidentified gunman, in a video recorded and later uploaded on social media, fired shots at the establishment. The bullets not only hit the cafe, but also nearby buildings, causing panic among locals, but no injuries.\nHarjeet Singh Laddi, a Khalistani terrorist and member of the banned militant outfit, Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), claimed responsibility for the attack, linking it to ongoing tensions involving the Indian diaspora in Canada, but being prompted mostly by comments allegedly made by Sharma in the past. Laddi is wanted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for the murder of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader, Vikas Prabhakar alias Vikas Bagga, who was shot dead at his shop in the Rupnagar district of Punjab, India in April 2024. Laddi hails from Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district in India's Punjab and is listed among India’s most wanted by the NIA.\nThe incident drew condemnation from Indian officials, who reiterated concerns over Sikh extremist activities targeting Indian businesses abroad.

Canadian police launched an investigation, though no arrests were immediately reported.\nOn 7 August 2025, at 4:40 a.m., shots were fired at Kap's Café for a second time. Police responded to a call around 4:40 a.m. of shots fired outside the Scott Road business.\nOn 15 October 2025, shots were fired at comedian Kapil Sharma's Kap's Café for the third time in the past four months.
