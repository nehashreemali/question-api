The bass is a very important part of the track and is the main riff which is why it had to be perfect. So it was the three things, with the added vocal which was minimal on top, that made the tune come together as know it in its final version.\" The song crossed 7 million streams in music streaming platforms upon release and became popular among audiences.\nThe series also features tracks from the folk band Kabir Café naming 'Do Din Ki Zindagi Hai, Do Din Ka Mela', which is a composition based on the poem of 15th century saint Kabirdas, and a song from their 2016 album 'Panchrang', 'Matkar Maya Ko Ahankar' which is played by the ending scenes of the last episode.\n\n\nMarketing and release\nScam 1992's digital rights were acquired by SonyLIV, an over-the-top media service platform from Sony Pictures Networks.

Sayan Ghosh of The Hindu wrote \"Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story is a well-written show with its lead characters doing all the heavy lifting. Despite its flaws, it provides an intriguing sneak-peek at the untapped potential of homegrown content creators — and what they are capable of — if allowed to run wild with their imagination.\" Ronak Kotecha, editor-in-chief of The Times of India gave three-and-a-half of five stating \"The fact that it’s a real story that captured the country’s collective imagination makes for a riveting watch. It’s almost like our very own desi version of The Wolf of Wall Street and we’re quite bullish that it will keep you invested.\" Jyoti Sharma Bawa of Hindustan Times said, \"Hansal Mehta digs deep into the India of 80s and 90s to tell us the story of the securities scam that shook up the country. Harshad Mehta’s boom-to-bust story is emblematic of its time, but not limited to it.\" Subhra Gupta of The Indian Express stated \"The Hansal Mehta directed series does a smart balancing act, never quite tipping over into Harshad Mehta adulation, nor showing him as an unmitigated villain.\"\nDevasheesh Pandey of News18, gave three-and-a-half out of five stars and stated \"Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story does not pronounce guilty verdict on India's first financial sector scamster, but presents us with a morally dubious character and leaves it our sensibilities whether to make him a messiah or a pariah.\" Tatsam Mukherjee, writing for Firstpost, summarised \"In spite of all the research, the show never quite transports us into Harshad's mind — the greed, the compulsive need to be surrounded by materialist things, the arrogance of taking on the government, and the tragedy of a 'pioneer' turned into an outcast.\" Scroll's chief editor Nandini Ramanath reviewed \"Scam 1992 provides ample evidence of Mehta’s dishonesty over 500-plus minutes, only to float the idea that the system was the bigger villain. This bull got big but then ran into the wolves who were stronger, the series lamely suggests.\"\nMoumita Bhattacharya of Rediff gave three-and-a-half out of five and stated \"Hansal Mehta's nine-hour drama series Scam 1992 needs to be viewed by everyone, young and old.\" The News Minute's Saraswati Darar wrote \"Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story, it’s a compellingly told labour of love that deserves to be watched.\" Shefali Deshpande of Bloomberg Quint gave four-and-a-half out of five stating, \"Scam 1992 taps into the psychological need to succeed and have prestige.\" Amman Khurana of Zoom TV, gave four out of five and stated \"Scam 1992 – The Harshad Mehta Story, despite being significantly long, never goes off track and keeps you glued till the end. The deft direction, skilfully-stitched screenplay and thorough research do the job.\" Shubham Kulkarni of Koimoi, gave four out of five and stated \"It is one of those rare shows where the primary layer is the only thing to hook on, and the writing does wonders here.\" Prathyush Parasuraman writing for Film Companion gave a mixed review and said \"There’s too much posturing and pouting, and not enough to stay tethered to the 10 long fifty-minute episodes.\"\n\n\nImpact\nThe music of the series became popular, with the titular track of Scam 1992, was recreated by a beatbox band from France, which went viral on YouTube with 970,000 views upon its release on 4 December 2020.\n\n\nFuture\nIn March 2021, SonyLiv and Applause Entertainment announced the second installment of the franchise titled Scam 2003.
