He has also accused the producers of willfully misrepresenting certain concepts from the novel, such as \"tilism\" (kind of a maze) and \"ayyari\" (spying), and showing them as \"jadu-tona\" (sorcery), as well as criticizing the characters and the sequences in the Chunar fort for being overly exaggerated, and how far into the show Chandrakanta appeared.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nChandrakanta at IMDb\nOfficial Site on Sony TV Archived 16 June 2004 at the Wayback Machine",
