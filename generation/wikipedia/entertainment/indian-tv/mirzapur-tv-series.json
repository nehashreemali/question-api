In March 2017, the makers announced about the crime drama series which is set in Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh. Rithesh Sidhwani and Farhan Akhtar, said that the series is loosely based on the Netflix series Narcos.\nKaran Anshuman created the series, who also wrote the script with Puneet Krishna and Vineet Krishna, and directed the series along with Gurmmeet Singh and Mihir Desai. In an interview with Devarsi Ghosh of Scroll.in, Anshuman stated that he has been a big fan of the Hinterland western genre, and also watched films such as Omkara (2006) and Gangs of Wasseypur series, however, due to the restrictions in the medium, the genre cannot be possible in cinema, as it demands extreme violence and brutality. He added \"We had this idea for a gangster drama, and I felt that the best way to do it in India was to set it in the hinterlands, in the back of beyond. We [co-writers Puneet Krishna and Vineet Krishna] had access to a lot of stories based on our research, but we wanted to create a world that was hyper-real and amped up. We created a world of violence where even the nicest person would own a gun and could pull the trigger if the need arose. But the characters and their relationships are emotional. All the characters are heroes in their own arc, so everyone will find someone to relate to.\"\nIn March 2020, the makers announced for a third instalment in the series, with its pre-production work being underway. Amazon Prime Video, officially announced for a third season on 12 November 2020.\n\n\nCasting\nThe series revolves around the principal character Pankaj Tripathi who plays the role of Akhandanad Tripathi (Kaleen Bhayya), a mafia boss and millionaire carpet exporter.

Divyendu Sharma, Ali Fazal, Vikrant Massey appears in other principal roles alongside Shweta Tripathi, Shriya Pilgaonkar, Rasika Dugal, Harshita Gaur and Kulbhushan Kharbanda. Anshuman stated that the characters in the series are real, but the world they are in is larger than life, similar to the worlds of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. He eventually conceived that the characters Guddu (Ali Fazal) and Bablu (Vikrant Massey) were inspired two real boys who rode a bike and went around terrorising the town. He further added Guddu's character was inspired by a bodybuilder's look.\nIn an interview published on an online portal in February 2020, Vikrant Massey revealed that the makers of the series had kept him in dark about his character's demise, till the day of the shoot. Reportedly, Vikrant Massey's character Vinay Pandit (Bablu) was brutally murdered in the climax of Season 1. He exclaimed that the makers had kept his death under the wraps to reportedly make the audiences more curious about his character. But his character did not have a cameo appearance in the second season.

Ginny Diwan, the lyricist of this song penned the lyrics within an hour. Anand stated that \"It's an 'item song' from a woman's point of view while a fight is on.

Rohan Naahar of the Hindustan Times, gave two out of five and stated \"Mirzapur doesn't aim high, and yet it fails to hit its target. A more mature approach to the violence and a more focused plot would greatly benefit the second season, were there to be one.\" Ektaa Malik of The Indian Express claimed that \"The nine-part series, with almost hour-long episodes, is a tedious watch, and even its top-notch cast can't save this mammoth show from sinking.\" Saraswati Datar from The News Minute reviewed \"A brilliant cast of actors led by Pankaj Tripathi is let down by an inconsistent script and indulgent direction.\" Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave two out of five to the series, and stated \"Barring a couple of sequences in the first two episodes, Mirzapur never finds a way out of the drably pedestrian.\" Stutee Ghosh from The Quint gave two-and-a-half out of five stars and stated \"Mirzapur runs out of steam early on and never truly recovers, but it does have one saving grace.\"\nIn a positive note, Nandini Ramanth of Scroll.in stated \"The violence in Mirzapur is nearly always gratuitous in its operatics, but Pankaj Tripathi's nuanced and hugely enjoyable performance is among the grace notes.\" Rahul Desai of Film Companion rated it three-out-of-five stars and stated \"Featuring some of Hindi cinema's most talented actors, it's no surprise that the performances paper over awkward cracks in the narrative balance.\"\n\n\nSeason 2\nSaibal Chatterjee of NDTV, gave two-and-a-half out of five stars and stated \"One key difference between the two seasons is in the pacing of the narrative. Season 2, as expected, fires on all cylinders, but in an infinitely more controlled manner. The language continues to be gratingly coarse. However, the scenes of violence, even when they are fervidly excessive, aren't delivered merely to boost the shock quotient as was often the case in S1.\" Udita Jhunjhunwala from Firstpost reviewed the series, giving three out of five stars and stated \"Season 2 ends with what we have come to expect when a game of thrones is afoot – some will die, some will live, and the show will go on.\"\nRonak Kotecha of The Times of India rated the series three-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote \"Mirzapur 2 has that 'killer' combination of power and politics that largely works, but is not bulletproof to flaws.\" Jyothi Sharma Bawa of Hindustan Times reviewed \"For a show that revels in throwing references at you, here is one that Mirzapur 2 offers us right in the beginning – a scorpion with a sting in its tale.\" Rohit Vats of News18 gave two-and-a-half to the series stating \"In Mirzapur 2, Ali Fazal and Pankaj Tripathi are unflinchingly staring at each other amid a barrage of bullets with a commitment to make all this look bizarrely satisfying.\"\nNandini Ramanath of Scroll.in reviewed \"Mirzapur 2 might have not felt the need to invent new characters to ramp up the intrigue. These fresh entrants deliver enough scheming and maneuvering to last 10 episodes, but the show's writers, Puneet Krishna and Vineet Krishna aren't done yet. Like a Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise that stretches on unto eternity, a time-bound story revolving around revenge for fresh wounds is threatening to evolve into a saga that will persist for a few more seasons.\" Mughda Kapoor of Daily News and Analysis, rated three-and-a-half out of five to the show stating \"Living up to the expectations of delivering an action-packed, fierce, and intense season, Mirzapur 2 surely makes for a great watch.\"\nIn contrast, Ektaa Malik from The Indian Express gave two out of five stars and stated \"Mirzapur 2 doesn't yet fall into the category of 'its soo bad that its good,’ nor does it fit into the 'guilty pleasure' slot.\" Saraswati Datar of The News Minute stated \"The episodes, which start off at a brisk pace, slow down mid-way through the season. Yet this enviable ensemble of actors, who are undoubtedly some of the best in the business today, strive hard to stay invested and keep the proceedings going.\"\n\n\nSeason 3\nThe third season of Mirzapur has received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Ronak Kotecha of The Times of India gave it a three-and-a-half-stars out of five. She praised the main cast for their performances in this season, while criticizing the pacing in the first half.\nArushi Jain of India Today also gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five, and stated that the season feels \"flavourful and wholly satisfying\" despite following a similar formula as the previous two seasons. She also praised the depiction of the female characters in this season.\nSaibal Chatterjee of  NDTV rated it two-and-a-half stars out of five, and stated that it has \"markedly less tensile strength than the first two seasons\" Shubra Gupta of The Indian Express rated it two stars out of five, and said that it is the \"weakest season\" of the show. Sugandha Rawal of Hindustan Times also provided a critical review, where she said that the show has a \"weak storyline, too many main characters & predictable highpoints\".\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\nMirzapur at IMDb",
