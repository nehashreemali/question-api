  "extract": "Augustus (born Gaius Octavius; 23 September 63 BC – 19 August AD 14), also known as Octavian (Latin: Octavianus), was the founder of the Roman Empire, who reigned as the first Roman emperor from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. The reign of Augustus initiated an imperial cult and an era of imperial peace (the Pax Romana or Pax Augusta) in which the Roman world was largely free of armed conflict. The principate, a style of government where the emperor showed nominal deference to the Senate, was established during his reign and lasted until the Crisis of the Third Century.\nOctavian was born into an equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia. Following the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, Octavian was named in Caesar's will as his primary heir. Inheriting Caesar's estate and assuming his name, Octavian fought for the loyalty of Caesar's legions. He, Mark Antony, and Marcus Lepidus formed a triumvirate regime to avenge themselves upon the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, the triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as de facto autocrats. The triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members; Lepidus was sidelined in 36 BC and Antony was defeated by Octavian's naval commander Marcus Agrippa at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. Antony and his wife Cleopatra, the Ptolemaic queen of Egypt, killed themselves during Octavian's invasion of Egypt, which then became Octavian's personal property.\nAfter the demise of the triumvirate, Augustus reached an accord with the remaining Roman elite: he would restore the façade of a free republic, centered around the Senate, the executive magistrates and the legislative assemblies. But his control of the military meant he maintained autocratic power legitimized by his appointment as commander-in-chief of most Roman armies along with assuming the powers of the tribunate and censorship. A similar ambiguity is seen in his chosen names, the implied rejection of monarchical titles whereby he called himself princeps ('first citizen'), juxtaposed with his acceptance of the name Augustus ('the revered'). The Senate also granted him the title pater patriae (lit. 'father of the country'), and named the month of August after him.\nAugustus dramatically enlarged the empire, annexing Egypt, Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Raetia, expanding possessions in Africa, and completing the conquest of Hispania. His expansionism, however, suffered a major setback in Germania. Beyond the frontiers, he secured the empire with a buffer region of client states and negotiated peace treaties with the Parthian Empire and Kingdom of Kush. He reformed the Roman system of taxation and currency, developed networks of roads with an official courier system, established a standing professional army, established the Praetorian Guard as well as official police and fire-fighting services for Rome, and renovated much of the city during his reign. Augustus died in AD 14 at age 75 from natural causes. Persistent rumors, substantiated somewhat by deaths in the imperial family, have claimed his wife Livia poisoned him. He was succeeded as emperor by his adoptive son Tiberius, Livia's son and former husband of Augustus's only biological child, Julia.\n\n\nName\nAs a consequence of Roman customs, society, and personal preference, Augustus ( aw-GUST-əs) was known by many names throughout his life:\n\nGaius Octavius: ( ok-TAY-vee-əs; Latin: [ˈɡaːiʊs ɔkˈtaːwiʊs]). According to Suetonius, the cognomen Thurinus (Latin: [tʰuːˈriːnʊs], 'of Thurii') was added to his birth name as a toddler in 60 BC. Later, after he had taken the name of Caesar, his rival Mark Antony referred to him as Thurinus in order to belittle him. Marcus Junius Brutus, one of the assassins of Julius Caesar, referred to Octavian as Octavius, rejecting Octavian's claim to testamentary adoption.\nGaius Julius Caesar: After his adoption by Julius Caesar on the latter's death in 44 BC, he took Caesar's nomen and cognomen. He was often distinguished by historians from his adoptive father by the addition Octavianus (Latin: [ɔktaːwiˈaːnʊs]) after the name, denoting that he was a former member of the gens Octavia in conformance with Roman naming conventions. There is no evidence that Augustus did this himself, although Cicero and some other contemporaries called him Gaius Octavius, Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, as well as \"the young Caesar\". In English he is mainly known by the anglicisation Octavian ( ok-TAY-vee-ən) for the period between 44 and 27 BC.\nImperator Caesar ('Commander-in-Chief Caesar'): Octavian's early coins and inscriptions all refer to him simply as Gaius Caesar, but by 38 BC he had replaced Gaius with the victory title imperator ('commander'). The use of imperator signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory. His new family line would continue the use of the name Caesar, a cognomen for one branch of the Julian family, and eventually this would form a standard imperial title. Occasionally the epithet divi filius or divi Iuli(i) filius 'son of the divine Julius' was included, alluding to Julius Caesar's deification in 42 BC.\nImperator Caesar Augustus: On 16 January 27 BC, in recognition of his perceived accomplishments, the Senate granted him the honorific Augustus (Latin: [au̯ˈɡʊstʊs]), 'the revered'. Historians use this name to refer to him from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. The name is sometimes given as Augustus Caesar.\n\n\nEarly life\n\nOctavian was born Gaius Octavius in Rome on 23 September 63 BC. His paternal family was from the Volscian town of Velitrae (modern Velletri), approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) south-east of the city. He was born at Ox Head, a small property on the Palatine Hill, very close to the Roman Forum. In his childhood, he may have received the cognomen \"Thurinus\" to commemorate his father's victory at Thurii over a rebellious band of slaves who had been followers of Spartacus. Roman histories gloss over the childhood of Octavian. Some details about Octavian's upbringing from his now-lost autobiography were preserved by Suetonius, while the majority of information is preserved in a biography composed by Nicolaus of Damascus around 20 BC that survives only partially in 10th-century Byzantine excerpts.\nOctavian was raised for at least part of his childhood in his father's hometown of Velitrae. Octavian's father, also named Gaius Octavius, came from a moderately wealthy equestrian family of the gens Octavia. Octavian's paternal great-grandfather Octavius was a military tribune in Sicily during the Second Punic War. His grandfather was a banker. His father ascended the Cursus honorum as quaestor c. 73, aedile c. 64, and praetor in 61 BC, before being made proconsular governor of Macedonia, where he was proclaimed imperator for victories against the Thracian Bessi on its frontiers. His mother, Atia, was the niece of Julius Caesar.\n\nOctavian was four years old when his father died in 59 BC, or in 58 BC. In 58 BC his mother Atia married a former governor of Syria, Lucius Marcius Philippus. Philippus came from a leading family in Rome and was elected consul in 56 BC. According to historian Karl Galinsky, as Octavian's stepfather, Philippus served as a role model in how to delicately navigate troubled political waters while preserving his personal wealth. Octavian was partly raised by his grandmother, Julia, the sister of Julius Caesar. When Julia died in 52 or 51 BC, Octavian delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother. \nOctavian was educated in reading, writing, arithmetic, and the Greek language by a Greek slave tutor named Sphaerus, who Octavian later freed from slavery and honored with a state funeral in 40 BC. As a teenager he studied philosophy under the tutelage of Areios of Alexandria and Athenodorus of Tarsus, Latin rhetoric under Marcus Epidius, and Greek rhetoric under Apollodorus of Pergamon. In 48 or 47 BC Octavian donned the toga virilis ('toga of manhood'). At the request of Caesar to fill a priesthood position left vacant by Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (after he was killed at Pharsalus), Octavian was elected to the College of Pontiffs in 47 BC. The following year he was put in charge of the Greek games that were staged in honor of the Temple of Venus Genetrix, built by Julius Caesar.\nIn 63 BC Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus, head of the College of Pontiffs, allowing him to build political clout and eventually form the so-called 'first triumvirate' with the statesmen Pompey and Marcus Licinius Crassus in 60 BC. This informal alliance, which superseded but did not suspend Rome's constitution, had fallen apart by the time Caesar crossed the Rubicon on 11 January 49 BC and initiated a protracted civil war. In late 47 BC, Octavian wished to join Caesar's staff for his campaign in Africa but gave way when his mother Atia protested over his poor health. Treating him as a son, Caesar had Octavian proceed next to his chariot during his triumph celebrating the campaign, and had him awarded with military decorations as if he had been present for it. In 45 BC Octavian traveled to Hispania to join Caesar's camp during the fight against the lingering forces of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus the Younger (son of Pompey), convincing his mother Atia not to join him despite her worries about his fragile physical health. Returning to Rome from Hispania in October 45 BC, Caesar deposited a new will with the Vestal Virgins (drafting it while at his villa in Labici), naming Octavian as the prime beneficiary and his principal heir on 13 September 45 BC.\n\n\nRise to power\n\n\nHeir to Caesar\n\nIn 44 BC, Octavian was studying and undergoing military training in Apollonia, Illyria, when Julius Caesar was made Rome's first dictator perpetuo ('dictator in perpetuity') in February, and then assassinated on the Ides of March (15 March). Octavian consulted with Caesar's loyal army officers stationed in Macedonia for advice on a course of action, and ultimately decided to sail to Italy to ascertain whether he had any potential political fortunes or security. Caesar had no living legitimate children under Roman law. In the absence of sons, Caesar's will made Octavian his main heir with the condition that he take up the dead dictator's name. After landing at Lupiae near Brundisium in southern Italy, Octavian received a copy of the will, which made him heir to three-quarters of Caesar's estate. Octavian's stepfather Philippus advised him against accepting Caesar's will and to live quietly instead, while Atia—who often intervened in young Octavian's affairs—left this pivotal choice to her son, who ultimately accepted it on 8 May 44 BC.\nAccepting the inheritance by appearing before the urban praetor, Octavian purported that he was adopted as Caesar's son, a legally spurious but politically powerful claim, and assumed his great-uncle's name Gaius Julius Caesar. Roman citizens adopted into a new family usually retained their old nomen in cognomen form (e.g. Octavianus for one who had been an Octavius, Aemilianus for one who had been an Aemilius). There is no evidence that Octavian himself used the name Octavianus, seeking to portray himself more closely as Caesar's son; however some of his contemporaries did refer to him as Octavianus, such as Cicero and his stepfather Philippus. Historians usually refer to the new Caesar as Octavian during the time between his adoption and his assumption of the name Augustus in 27 BC, to avoid confusing the dead dictator with his heir.\nOctavian could not rely on his limited funds to make a successful entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy. After a warm welcome by Caesar's soldiers at Brundisium, Octavian demanded a portion of the funds that were allotted by Caesar for the intended war against the Parthian Empire in the Middle East. This amounted to 700 million sesterces stored at Brundisium, the staging ground in Italy for military operations in the east. A later senatorial investigation into the disappearance of the public funds took no action against Octavian since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senate's enemy Mark Antony. Octavian made another bold move in 44 BC when, without official permission, he appropriated the annual tribute that had been sent from Rome's province of Asia in the Near East to Italy.\nOctavian began to bolster his personal forces with Caesar's veteran legionaries and with troops designated for the Parthian war, gathering support by emphasizing his status as heir to Caesar. On his march to Rome through Italy, Octavian's presence and newly acquired funds attracted many, winning over Caesar's former veterans stationed in Campania. By June, he had gathered an army of 3,000 loyal veterans, paying each a bonus of 500 denarii, which was more than a legionary soldier earned after two years of service.\n\n\nGrowing tensions\n\nArriving in Rome on 6 May 44 BC, Octavian found consul Mark Antony, Caesar's former colleague, in an uneasy truce with the dictator's assassins. They had been granted a general amnesty on 17 March in an agreement that they would respect the magistracies installed and laws passed by Caesar to avoid the political turmoil of invalidating them. Soon afterwards, Antony succeeded in driving most of them out of Rome with an inflammatory eulogy at Caesar's funeral, mounting public opinion against the assassins.\nMark Antony was amassing political support, but Octavian still had the opportunity to rival him as the leading member of the faction supporting Caesar. Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he initially opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status. Antony refused to hand over the money due Octavian as Caesar's heir, possibly on grounds that it would take time to disentangle it from state funds, but also as a measure to delay Octavian from carrying out the popular provision in Caesar's will that promised the dispersal of 300 sesterces per capita to the urban plebs of Rome. As consul, Antony blocked the curiate assembly from hearing Octavian's petition to legitimize his supposed adoption by Caesar, Octavian's attempts to reinstate Caesar's golden throne for public view at games staged in April and June, and Octavian's attempts to have Caesar formally deified after a comet seen in July during games honoring Caesar (and Venus) was widely interpreted as a sign of his divinity. Despite Antony's obstructionist tactics, during Caesar's victory games Octavian was able to distribute some of the funds in Caesar's will and combine this with other personal finances to cover half of the promised payouts to the plebs, enhancing his popularity while damaging that of Antony.\nDuring the summer of 44 BC, Octavian won the support of Caesarian veterans and also made common cause with those senators—many of whom were themselves former Caesarians—who perceived Antony as a threat to the state. Antony had lictors drag Octavian away from a trial hearing over the reinstatement of private property seized by Caesar in 49 BC, after which Octavian claimed Antony threatened his life as retribution for ensuring the plebs received their rightful dues. Caesar's veterans then convinced Antony to publicly reconcile with Octavian in the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. Following this abortive attempt at reconciliation, Antony's bellicose edicts against Brutus and Cassius alienated him from the moderate Caesarians in the Senate, who feared a renewed civil war. In September, Marcus Tullius Cicero, now a political ally of Octavian, began to attack Antony in a series of speeches portraying him as a threat to the republican order.\n\n\nFirst conflict with Antony\n\nWith opinion in Rome turning against him and his year of consular power nearing its end, Antony attempted to pass a plebiscite that would assign him proconsular governorship over the strategic province of Cisalpine Gaul in northern Italy, rather than the province of Macedonia. Octavian meanwhile built up a private army in Italy by recruiting Caesarian veterans, and in early November entered Rome with this private force to challenge Antony. However, they vacated the city shortly afterwards, due to some veterans choosing to quit once it became clear they were involved in a Caesarian squabble rather than a revenge campaign against Caesar's assassins. Nevertheless, on 28 November Octavian won over two of Antony's legions with the enticing offer of monetary gain.\nIn the face of Octavian's large and capable force, Antony saw the danger of staying in Rome and, to the relief of the Senate, he left Rome for Cisalpine Gaul, which was to be handed to him on 1 January 43 BC. However, the province had earlier been assigned to Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, one of Caesar's assassins, who now refused to yield to Antony. Antony besieged him at Mutina, and rejected the resolutions passed by the Senate to stop the fighting. The Senate had no army to enforce their resolutions. This provided an opportunity for Octavian, who was already known to have armed forces. Cicero also defended Octavian against Antony's taunts about Octavian's lack of noble lineage and aping of Julius Caesar's name.\n\nAt the urging of Cicero, the Senate inducted Octavian as senator on 1 January 43 BC, yet he also was given the power to vote alongside the former consuls and the ability to stand for election of offices at an earlier age than usual. In addition, Octavian was granted imperium pro praetore, which legitimized his command, and was sent to relieve the siege along with Hirtius and Pansa (the consuls for 43 BC). He assumed the fasces on 7 January, a date that he would later commemorate as the beginning of his public career. Antony's forces were defeated at the battles of Forum Gallorum (14 April) and Mutina (21 April), forcing Antony to retreat to Transalpine Gaul. Both consuls were killed, however, leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies. These victories earned him his first acclamation as imperator, a title reserved for victorious commanders.\nThe Senate heaped many more rewards on Decimus Brutus than on Octavian for defeating Antony, then attempted to give command of the consular legions to Decimus Brutus. In response, Octavian stayed in the Po Valley and refused to aid any further offensive against Antony. In July, an embassy of centurions sent by Octavian entered Rome and demanded the consulship left vacant by Hirtius and Pansa, with Cicero as the proposed co-consul, and also that the decree should be rescinded which declared Antony a public enemy. When this was refused, he marched on the city with eight legions. He encountered no military opposition in Rome and on 19 August 43 BC was elected consul with his relative Quintus Pedius as co-consul. \nPedius passed legislation that created a special tribunal; over a single day with Octavian as president, the tribunal tried, convicted, and passed sentences of exile on the Caesarian assassins and alleged associates in absentia. Octavian also induced the curiate assembly to have him adrogated into Caesar's family, sanctioning his legally dubious claim of testamentary adoption. Meanwhile, Antony formed an alliance with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, then governor of Gallia Narbonensis. A fellow Caesarian, Lepidus was branded by the Senate as a public enemy for joining Antony. While Octavian marched north to fight Decimus Brutus and meet with Antony, Pedius convinced the Senate to revoke the law branding Antony and Lepidus as outlaws. Octavian's mother Atia died at some point before he officially allied with Antony and Lepidus in November, with nothing known about her death except that, as consul, Octavian arranged a lavish public funeral service for her.\n\n\nSecond Triumvirate\n\n\nProscriptions\n\nIn a meeting near Bononia in October 43 BC, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus sketched plans to form the triumvirate, ostensibly for the putting together of the republic. Their agreement, legitimized by law for five years, was then put in to force by the lex Titia, passed by tribune Publius Titius on 27 November that year. The triumvirate, unlike the unofficial \"first triumvirate\" of Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, was a formal office; it gave the three men consular power, the right to appoint the magistrates, and allowed their division among themselves of the provinces not under the control of the liberatores in the east. Octavian had previously been engaged to Servilia, daughter of Publius Servilius Isauricus, but instead became engaged to Claudia, stepdaughter of Antony, a marriage alliance that was intended to solidify their official political union. Octavian also relinquished the consulship to Antony's political ally Publius Ventidius.\nThe triumvirs then set in motion proscriptions, in which some 300 men were targeted as outlaws, divided roughly evenly between senators and equestrians. Thousands more had their properties confiscated. Contemporary Roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which triumvir was most responsible for the proscriptions and killing. However, the sources agree that enacting the proscriptions was a means by all three factions to eliminate political enemies. Plutarch described the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping of friends and family among Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian. For example, Octavian allowed the proscription of his ally Cicero, Antony the proscription of his maternal uncle Lucius Julius Caesar (the consul for 64 BC), and Lepidus his brother Paullus. Plutarch insisted that Octavian defended Cicero at first before giving in to Antony's bloodlust, but historian Patricia Southern suggests that Octavian had his own motives for allowing Cicero to be killed.\nThe proscriptions were motivated in part by a need to raise money to pay the salaries of their troops for the upcoming conflict against Caesar's assassins, Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus, but the main intention was the removal of wartime rivals. Rewards for their arrest gave incentive for Romans to capture those proscribed, while property of those arrested were seized by the triumvirs. However much money was raised was insufficient, possibly due to the few bidders for properties of proscript victims. The triumvirs then introduced a range of new taxes to fund their war. They reinstituted property taxes (in abeyance since 167 BC) and created new imposts on slaves, before also demanding property assessments for taxes on rich women that were reduced after a public protest of women in Rome.\n\n\nBattle of Philippi and division of territory\n\nOn 1 January 42 BC, with Lepidus as consul, the Senate posthumously recognized Julius Caesar as a divinity of the Roman state, divus Iulius. Octavian was able to further his cause by emphasizing the fact that he was divi filius ('Son of the Divine'). Antony and Octavian then sent twenty-eight legions by sea to face the armies of Brutus and Cassius, who had built their base of power in Greece and eastern provinces. After two battles at Philippi in Macedonia in October 42 BC, the Caesarian army was victorious and Brutus and Cassius committed suicide. \nMark Antony used the battles of Philippi as a means to belittle Octavian, as both engagements were decisively won with the use of Antony's forces. In addition to claiming responsibility for both victories, Antony branded Octavian as a coward for handing over his direct military control to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa instead. Octavian was bedridden with illness during the first battle, allegedly removing himself from command over the camp per his doctor's advice, but captured Brutus' camp during the second battle. Galinsky asserts that Octavian saved face from this embarrassment by having the corpse of Brutus beheaded, though Goldsworthy says it is unclear who gave this order. The remains were sent back to Rome for public display, but these were lost in a storm at sea before they could arrive.\n\nAfter Philippi, a new territorial arrangement was made among the members of the triumvirate. Lepidus was suspected by Octavian and Antony of colluding with Sextus Pompeius, the son of Pompey and renegade general who had been given command over all Mediterranean coastlines by the anti-Caesarian Senate in 43 BC. Cisalpine Gaul was combined with Italia and given to Octavian along with the provinces of Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior that Lepidus had to forfeit. Antony travelled east to Egypt where he allied himself with Queen Cleopatra, a Roman client ruler, former lover of Julius Caesar, and mother of Caesar's son Caesarion. In addition to eastern provinces, Antony also took Gallia Narbonensis from Lepidus, and already controlled Gallia Comata. Lepidus was left with the province of Africa, stymied by Antony, who conceded Hispania to Octavian. \nOctavian was left to decide where in Italy to settle tens of thousands of veterans of the African and Macedonian campaigns, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. Those who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land. There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian chose to alienate many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, instead of alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.\n\n\nThe Perusine War, marriage alliances, and Treaty of Brundisium\n\nThere was widespread dissatisfaction with Octavian over these settlements of his soldiers, and this encouraged many to rally at the side of Lucius Antonius, who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate. Meanwhile, Octavian asked for a divorce from Claudia, the daughter of Antony's wife Fulvia and her first husband Publius Clodius Pulcher. He returned Claudia to her mother, claiming that their marriage had never been consummated. Fulvia decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius, she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian, and Lucius Antonius even briefly took Rome, forcing Lepidus and his two legions to flee the city. Yet Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian, since the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries. Lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at Perusia, where Octavian forced them into surrender in February 40 BC. \nLucius and his army were spared because of his kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia fled in exile to Sicyon in Greece. She died shortly afterwards, with blame for the revolt conveniently placed on her rather than on Lucius. Octavian showed no mercy, however, for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius. On 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesar's assassination, he had 300 Roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius. Perusia was also pillaged and burned, though it is unclear if Octavian's troops or local inhabitants started the fires. This bloody event sullied Octavian's reputation and was criticized by many, such as Augustan poet Sextus Propertius.\nSextus Pompeius affirmed his control of his powerbase in Sicily as part of an agreement reached with the triumvirate in 40 BC, and gained control of Sardinia and Corsica in 39 BC. Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius. Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40 BC when he married Scribonia, a sister (or daughter) of Pompeius's father-in-law Lucius Scribonius Libo (hence an aunt of Sextus Pompey’s wife). Scribonia gave birth to Octavian's only natural child, Julia, the same day that he divorced her to marry Livia Drusilla, little more than a year after their marriage. Octavian's affair with Livia also began while she was already married and pregnant.\nWhile in Egypt, Antony had been engaged in an affair with Cleopatra and had fathered two children with her. Antony's Gallic provinces also fell into Octavian's hands after the death of Antony's legate Quintus Fufius Calenus in 40 BC. Aware of his deteriorating relationship with Octavian, Antony left Cleopatra; he sailed to Italy in 40 BC with a large force to oppose Octavian, laying siege to Brundisium. This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however. Their centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight because of their Caesarian cause, while the legions under their command followed suit. Meanwhile, in Sicyon, Antony's wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness, shortly after Antony met with her. Fulvia's death and the mutiny of their centurions allowed the two remaining triumvirs to effect a reconciliation.\nIn the autumn of 40, Octavian and Antony approved the Treaty of Brundisium, by which Lepidus would remain in Africa, Antony in the East, Octavian in the West. The Italian Peninsula was left open to all for the recruitment of soldiers, but in reality this provision was useless for Antony in the East. Octavian was in a stronger negotiating position due to the troubles Antony had to face in the east with the Parthians invading Asia Minor. To further cement relations of alliance with Antony, Octavian gave his sister, Octavia Minor, in marriage to Antony in late 40 BC.\n\n\nWar with Sextus Pompeius and exile of Lepidus\n\nSextus Pompeius threatened Octavian in Italy by denying shipments of grain through the Mediterranean Sea to the peninsula. Pompeius's own son was put in charge as naval commander in the effort to cause widespread famine in Italy. Pompeius's control over the sea prompted him to take on the name Neptuni filius ('son of Neptune'). Before the battles of Philippi, Octavian had sent Salvidienus Rufus with a naval force to dislodge Sextus Pompeius from Sicily, but without success, and so the triumvirs recognized his command over the sea with the Treaty of Brundisium in 40 BC. However, when Sextus Pompeius resumed his blockade, a starving angry mob in Rome blamed Octavian and Antony and attacked them in early 39 BC; Antony's forces rescued Octavian and dispersed the mob. Another temporary peace agreement was reached in 39 BC with the Pact of Misenum. The blockade on Italy was lifted once Octavian granted Pompeius Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, and the Peloponnese, and ensured him a future position in the consulship.\nThe territorial agreement between the triumvirate and Sextus Pompeius began to crumble once Octavian divorced Scribonia and married Livia on 17 January 38 BC. After Antony refused to relinquish the Peloponnese, Pompeius blocked Rome's food supply, causing riots there. Pompeius's naval commander Menas betrayed him, handing over three legions to Octavian, as well as Corsica and Sardinia. However, Octavian's naval forces were defeated at Cumae. Octavian lacked the resources to confront Pompeius alone, so an agreement was reached with the triumvirate's extension for another five-year period beginning in 37 BC.\nIn supporting Octavian, Antony expected to gain support for his own campaign against the Parthian Empire, desiring to avenge Rome's defeat at Carrhae in 53 BC. In an agreement reached at Tarentum in mid-37 BC, Antony provided 120 ships for Octavian to use against Pompeius, while Octavian was to send 20,000 legionaries to Antony for use against Parthia. Two years later Octavian sent only a tenth of those promised, which Antony viewed as an intentional provocation. Meanwhile, Agrippa was tasked with creating the artificial harbor Portus Julius near Cumae by joining the Lucrinus and Avernus lakes for the training and shipbuilding of Octavian's naval fleet.\n\nOctavian and Lepidus launched a joint operation against Sextus in Sicily in 36 BC. Octavian suffered major setbacks, including the loss of his fleet as he became shipwrecked in Sicily, aided by the sole companion Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus. However, the naval fleet of Sextus Pompeius fled the fighting against Agrippa at Mylae in August, and was almost entirely destroyed on 3 September by Agrippa at the naval battle of Naulochus. Sextus fled to the east with his remaining forces, where he was captured and executed in Miletus by Antony or one of his legates in 35 BC. \nAs Lepidus and Octavian accepted the surrender of Pompeius's troops, Lepidus attempted to claim Sicily for himself, ordering Octavian to leave. Lepidus's troops deserted him, however, and defected to Octavian since they were weary of fighting, enticed by Octavian's promises of money. They were also effectively surrounded by Octavian's forces in Sicily. Lepidus surrendered to Octavian and was permitted to retain the office of pontifex maximus, but was ejected from the Triumvirate and exiled to a villa at Cape Circei in Italy. The Roman dominions were then divided between Octavian in the West and Antony in the East. Octavian ensured Rome's citizens of their rights to property, settled his discharged soldiers outside of Italy, and returned 30,000 slaves to their former Roman owners after they had fled to join Pompeius's army and navy. Octavian had the Senate grant him, his wife, and his sister tribunician immunity, or sacrosanctitas, in order to ensure his own safety and that of Livia and Octavia once he returned to Rome. \nAfter defeating Pompeius, Octavian's military campaigns in Illyricum from 35–33 BC secured the submission of the Iapodes and Dalmatae people (in what is now Croatia). This conflict allowed him to return the military standards previously lost by Aulus Gabinius, which Octavian housed afterwards in the Porticus Octavia. During the first campaign, Octavian destroyed Segesta (modern Siscia) and was wounded by a collapsing siege ramp when he besieged Metulum (along the Kolpa River). These efforts were lauded in the Senate, though Octavian postponed a triumph for his victories, and only later acknowledged the contributions of commanders Agrippa and Statilius Taurus. Nevertheless both Octavian and Antony's generals celebrated triumphs during the 30s BC, such as Antony's general Publius Ventidius when granted a triumph for defending Roman Syria in 38 BC against the invasion of Pacorus I of Parthia.\n\n\nWar with Antony and Cleopatra\n\nIn 36 BC, Octavian used a political ploy to make himself look less autocratic and Antony more the villain by proclaiming that the civil wars were coming to an end and that he would step down as triumvir—if only Antony would do the same. Antony refused. Antony's Parthian campaign in 36 BC turned into a debacle, tarnishing his image as a leader. The mere 2,000 legionaries sent by Octavian to Antony, traveling with his wife Octavia, were hardly enough to replenish his lost forces. On the other hand, Cleopatra, with her enormous wealth, could restore his army to full strength. Antony was already engaged in a romantic affair with Cleopatra, their third child Ptolemy Philadelphus born in 36 BC, so in 35 BC he decided to send Octavia back to Rome. Octavian used this to spread propaganda implying that Antony was becoming less than Roman, rejecting his legitimate Roman spouse who he wronged while favoring a foreign queen as his lover.\nRoman troops captured the Kingdom of Armenia in 34 BC, and Antony made his son Alexander Helios the ruler of Armenia. Cleopatra assumed the title \"Queen of Kings\" and her son Caesarion was named King of Kings and co-regent, acts that Octavian used to convince the Senate that Antony had ambitions to diminish the preeminence of Rome. Octavian became consul once again on 1 January 33 BC, and he opened the following session in the Senate with a vehement attack on Antony's grants of titles and territories to his relatives and to his queen, later known as the Donations of Alexandria.\nIn early 32 BC, amid an intense war of propaganda between him and Octavian, Antony publicly announced the end of his marriage to Octavia. The new consuls Gaius Sosius and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus were Antonine loyalists who threatened to revoke Octavian's triumviral authority. This prompted Octavian to enter the Senate house with armed guards where he made a speech accusing Antony and Sosius of misdeeds, an intimidation tactic that convinced a large portion of the senators and both consuls to flee Rome and defect to Antony. However, Octavian received two key deserters from Antony in the autumn of 32 BC: Munatius Plancus and Marcus Titius. These defectors gave Octavian the information that he needed to confirm with the Senate all the accusations that he made against Antony. Octavian forcibly entered the temple of the Vestal Virgins and seized Antony's secret will, which he promptly publicized. The will would have given away Roman-conquered territories as kingdoms for his sons to rule and designated Alexandria as the site of a tomb for him and his queen. Octavian demonstrated his loyalty to Rome by building his mausoleum on the Campus Martius. He also contested the clause in Antony's will recognizing Caesarion as the true heir to Julius Caesar.\n\nIn late 32 BC, the Senate officially revoked Antony's assigned consulship for the following year and declared war on Cleopatra's regime in Egypt. Following the terms of two suffect consuls for late 32 BC, Octavian had legal standing to conduct the war against Antony by being elected as consul for 31 BC. He retained his authority as a triumvir despite his term having officially expired at the end of 33 BC. He used emergency powers (tumultus) to have men of military age throughout the Republic swear an oath of loyalty to him as a mandate for assuming leadership.\nIn early 31 BC, Antony and Cleopatra were temporarily stationed in Greece when Octavian gained a preliminary victory: the navy successfully ferried troops across the Adriatic Sea under the command of Agrippa. Agrippa cut off Antony and Cleopatra's main force from their supply routes in the Ionian Sea, while Octavian landed at Toryne in Epirus, opposite the Greek island of Corcyra (modern Corfu), and marched south. Trapped on land and sea, deserters of Antony's army fled to Octavian's side daily while Octavian's forces were comfortable enough to make preparations.\n\nAntony's fleet sailed through the bay of Actium along the Ambracian Gulf of western Greece in a desperate attempt to break free of the naval blockade. It was there that Antony's fleet faced that of Octavian, led by his commanders Agrippa and Gaius Sosius in the Battle of Actium on 2 September 31 BC. Cleopatra and her portion of the fleet withdrew early in the battle and were later joined by Antony; his remaining forces were spared in a last-ditch effort by Cleopatra's fleet that had been waiting nearby. All of Antony's nearby forces on land surrendered to Octavian after initially attempting a retreat through Macedonia. Various client rulers siding with Antony now also defected to Octavian, such as Herod the Great of Judea, who met Octavian at Rhodes and would help supply Octavian's forces at Ptolemais in Phoenicia during their march to Egypt. Octavian would later establish a new city—Nicopolis ('victory city')—near the site of the battle at Actium, where games were staged every four years in honor of his victory.\nA year later, Octavian defeated their forces in Alexandria on 1 August 30 BC—after which Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide. Antony fell on his own sword and was allegedly taken by his soldiers back to Cleopatra's tomb where he died in her arms. After meeting with Octavian and refusing to be paraded in a triumph at Rome, Cleopatra took her own life by poisoning, contrary to the popular belief that she was bitten by an asp. Octavian had exploited his position as Caesar's heir to further his own political career, and he was well aware of the dangers in allowing another person to do the same. He followed the advice of the Greek philosopher Arius Didymus that there was room in the world for only one Caesar, and therefore ordered Caesarion to be killed. He also had Antony's son Marcus Antonius Antyllus killed, but spared Iullus Antonius and Cleopatra's children sired by Antony. Octavian had previously shown little mercy to surrendered enemies and acted in ways that had proven unpopular with the Roman people, yet he pardoned many of his opponents after the Battle of Actium. He also ensured that Cleopatra was buried properly next to Antony in their tomb. After Octavia arranged the marriage of Cleopatra's daughter Cleopatra Selene II to Juba II of Numidia, Emperor Augustus appointed this couple as the new co-rulers of Mauretania in 25 BC.\n\n\nSole ruler of Rome\n\n\nControl of Egypt\n\nThe conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt relieved the financial debts incurred by Octavian during the civil wars. He controlled Roman Egypt directly, forbade Roman Senators to travel there, and appointed equestrian governor Cornelius Gallus to supervise its administration and enormously lucrative taxation. While in Alexandria in 30 BC, Octavian visited the tomb of Alexander the Great, the conqueror king he emulated and associated himself with through similar artistic portraits. Octavian's conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt brought an end to the Hellenistic period initiated by Alexander. It also led to the cultural formation of a Greek East and Latin West in the Mediterranean and the type of cosmopolitan universal monarchy espoused by Alexander, albeit one now centered on Rome. \nOctavian would become the first Roman emperor as Augustus and also the first Roman pharaoh of Egypt, though he did not partake in Egyptian coronation rites or worship of the Apis bull, and he never traveled to Egypt again after 30 BC. Before returning to Rome, Octavian spent the winter of 30 BC on the Greek island of Samos. In August 29 BC Octavian was awarded with three triumphs in Rome for his respective victories in Illyria, Greece, and Egypt. Octavian and Agrippa were elected as the consuls for 28 BC, granted certain powers of the censor but not with the office itself, namely for the duty of conducting Rome's census.\n\n\nPrincipate\n\nAfter Actium and the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a position to rule the entire republic under an unofficial principate—with himself as princeps ('leading citizen')—which he achieved through incremental power gains. He did so by courting the Senate and the people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, maintaining the carefully curated appearance that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy. The term princeps was previously applied to members of the Roman nobility who distinguished themselves in service to the Republic, and Octavian would embrace this title as part of his cultivated image as a restorer of the Republic. \nYears of civil war had left Rome in a state of near lawlessness, but the republic was not prepared to accept the control of Octavian as a despot. At the same time, Octavian could not give up his authority without risking further civil wars. The Senate and people of Rome desired a return to stability, traditional legality, civility, and the assurance of free elections—which would be conducted in name at least under Octavian, soon to be princeps Augustus. \nHistorian Adrian Goldsworthy stresses that Augustus did not have a carefully planned design in fashioning this principate regime, which was far from inevitable, and relied much on chance, experimentation, improvisation, and trial-by-error. In his \"Caesar Augustus: A Call to Order\" historian T. P. Wiseman argues that, given the overwhelmingly positive reception of Augustus in contemporary Roman sources, Augustus should not be viewed as an unlawful usurper masking his monarchical intentions or autocratic wishes. Southern surmises that Octavian needed to at least keep up the appearance of being bound by term limits for the consulship and other offices: \"Octavian probably remembered very starkly that Caesar did not survive for more than a few weeks after accepting the appointment as dictator perpetuo\".\n\n\nFirst settlement\n\nOn 13 January 27 BC, Octavian made a show of returning full power to the Senate and relinquishing his control of the Roman provinces and their armies. Under his consulship, however, the Senate had little power in initiating legislation by introducing bills for senatorial debate. Octavian was no longer in direct control of the provinces and their armies, but he retained the loyalty of active duty soldiers and veterans alike. The careers of many clients and adherents depended on his patronage, as his financial power was unrivaled in the Roman Republic. Historians Werner Eck and Sarolta Takács state that:\n\nThe sum of his power derived first of all from various powers of office delegated to him by the Senate and people, secondly from his immense private fortune, and thirdly from numerous patron-client relationships he established with individuals and groups throughout the Empire. All of them taken together formed the basis of his auctoritas, which he himself emphasized as the foundation of his political actions.\nTo a large extent, the public was aware of the vast financial resources that Octavian commanded. He failed to encourage enough senators to finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in Italy in 20 BC, but he undertook direct responsibility for them. This was publicized on the Roman currency issued in 16 BC, after he donated vast amounts of money to the aerarium Saturni, the public treasury.\n\nAccording to historian H. H. Scullard, however, Octavian's power was based on the exercise of \"a predominant military power and ... the ultimate sanction of his authority was force, however much the fact was disguised\". The Senate proposed to Octavian, the victor of Rome's civil wars, that he once again assume command of the provinces. The Senate's proposal was a ratification of Octavian's extra-constitutional power. Through the Senate, Octavian was able to continue the appearance of a still-functional constitution. Feigning reluctance, on 16 January 27 BC he accepted a ten-year responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic. The provinces ceded to Augustus for that ten-year period constituted much of the conquered Roman world, including all of Hispania and Gaul, Syria, Cilicia, Cyprus, and Egypt. Moreover, command of these provinces provided Octavian with control over the majority of Rome's legions.\nOctavian became the most powerful political figure in the city of Rome and in most of its provinces, but he did not have a monopoly on political and martial power. The Senate still controlled North Africa, an important regional producer of grain, as well as Illyria and Macedonia, two strategic regions with several legions. However, the Senate had control of only five or six legions distributed among three senatorial proconsuls, compared to the twenty legions under the control of Octavian, and their control of these regions did not amount to any political or military challenge to Octavian. The Senate's control over some of the Roman provinces helped maintain a republican facade for the autocratic principate. \nWhile Octavian acted as consul in Rome, he dispatched senators to the provinces under his command as his representatives to manage provincial affairs and ensure that his orders were carried out. The provinces not under Octavian's control were overseen by governors chosen by the Senate. However, by virtue of his imperium maius, the later reigning Augustus issued instructions and edicts not only to his own legates but also to independent proconsuls governing public provinces that were nominally under senatorial control. Octavian's control of entire provinces even followed Republican-era precedents for the limited objective of securing peace and creating stability. For instance, Pompey had been given a similar level of command across the Roman world. Pompey was given term limits for extraordinary proconsular authority that included legates who answered to him, not the Senate, during his campaign against Mediterranean pirates in 67 BC and the subsequent Third Mithridatic War against Mithridates VI of Pontus.\n\n\nChange to Augustus\n\nOn 16 January 27 BC the Senate gave Octavian the new title of augustus. Augustus, from the Latin augere 'to increase', can be translated as \"illustrious one\", \"sublime\", or \"revered\". It was a title of religious authority rather than a political one, and it indicated that Octavian now approached divinity. His name of Augustus was also more favorable than Romulus, the previous one which he styled for himself in reference to the story of the legendary founder of Rome, which symbolized a second founding of Rome. The title of Romulus was associated too strongly with notions of monarchy and kingship, an image that Octavian tried to avoid. The Senate also confirmed his position as princeps senatus ('leader of the Senate'), the member of the Senate with the highest precedence. The honorific augustus was inherited by future Roman emperors, became the de facto main title of the emperor, and by the late 2nd century became the title of the senior emperor, his junior partner titled as Caesar instead. \nAugustus styled himself as Imperator Caesar divi filius ('Commander Caesar son of the deified one'). With this title, he boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, and the use of imperator signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory. He transformed Caesar, a cognomen for one branch of the Julian family, into a new family line that began with him.\n\nAugustus was granted the right to hang the corona civica ('civic crown') above his door and to have laurels drape his doorposts. However, he renounced flaunting insignia of power such as holding a scepter, wearing a diadem, or wearing the golden crown and purple toga of his predecessor Julius Caesar. If he refused to symbolize his power by donning and bearing these items on his person, the Senate nonetheless awarded him with a golden shield displayed in the meeting hall of the Curia, bearing the inscription virtus, pietas, clementia, iustitia ('valor, piety, clemency, and justice'). Augustus also did not feel the need to stay in Rome to retain these powers and privileges. For instance, he left for Gaul in the summer of 27 BC, and from 26 to 24 BC governed the Empire from Tarraco in Roman Spain, overseeing military campaigns in the Iberian peninsula until his return to Rome.\n\n\nSecond settlement\n\nBy 23 BC, some of the un-republican implications were becoming apparent concerning the settlement of 27 BC. Augustus's retention of an annual consulate drew attention to his de facto dominance over the Roman political system and cut in half the opportunities for others to achieve what was still nominally the preeminent position in the Roman state. Further, he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the principate in his turn, alienating his three greatest supporters: Agrippa, Maecenas, and Livia. He appointed noted republican Calpurnius Piso (who had fought against Julius Caesar and supported Cassius and Brutus) as co-consul in 23 BC, after his choice Aulus Terentius Varro Murena died unexpectedly.\n\n\nResignation from the consulship\nIn the late spring Augustus had a severe illness and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure the continuation of the principate in some form, while allaying senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism. Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus's supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed. This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.\nAugustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. With regards to the principate, it was obvious to Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position. Nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor and that they should continue to obey Agrippa, constitutional procedure notwithstanding.\n\nSoon after his bout of illness subsided, Augustus gave up his consulship. The only other times Augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2 BC, both times to introduce his grandsons into public life. This was a clever ploy by Augustus; ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the consular position while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class. Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular imperium not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. This desire, as well as the Marcus Primus affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the second settlement.\n\n\nMarcus Primus affair\nAfter Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, he was no longer in an official position to rule the state. However, his dominant position remained unchanged over his 'imperial' provinces where he was still a proconsul. When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary.\nA second problem later arose showing the need for the second settlement in what became known as the \"Marcus Primus affair\". In late 24 or early 23 BC, charges were brought against Marcus Primus, the former proconsul (governor) of Macedonia, for waging a war without prior approval of the Senate on the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace, whose king was a Roman ally. He was defended by Lucius Licinius Varro Murena who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus ordering him to attack the client state. Later, Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus. Such orders, had they been given, would have been considered a breach of the Senate's prerogative under the settlement of 27 BC and its aftermath—i.e., before Augustus was granted imperium proconsulare maius—as Macedonia was a senatorial province under the Senate's jurisdiction, not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus. Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of republican restoration as promoted by Augustus, and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen, a first among equals. Even worse, the involvement of Marcellus provided proof that Augustus's policy was to have the youth take his place as princeps, instituting a form of monarchy—accusations that had already played out.\n\nThe situation was so serious that Augustus appeared at the trial even though he had not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.\n\n\nGreater proconsular authority\nThe second settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize Augustus's legal authority to intervene in senatorial provinces. The Senate granted Augustus a form of general imperium proconsulare ('proconsular power') that applied throughout the empire, not solely to his provinces. Moreover, the Senate augmented Augustus's proconsular imperium into imperium proconsulare maius ('greater proconsular power'). This form of proconsular imperium was applicable throughout the empire and in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls. Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support, thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13 BC.\n\n\nAdditional powers\n\n\nPowers of the tribune\nDuring the second settlement, Augustus was also granted the power of a tribune (tribunicia potestas) for life, though not the official title of tribune. For some years, Augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas, the immunity given to a tribune of the plebs. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to patricians, a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar. This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting. Also included in Augustus's tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the Roman censor; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate.\n\n\nPowers of the censor\nWith the powers of a censor, Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the Forum. There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor. Julius Caesar had been granted similar powers, wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state. However, this position did not extend to the censor's ability to hold a census and determine the Senate's roster. The office of the tribunus plebis began to lose its prestige due to Augustus's amassing of tribunal powers, so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the praetorship.\n\n\nImperium over the city of Rome\nAugustus was granted sole imperium within the city of Rome in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular imperium when they crossed the Pomerium—the sacred boundary of Rome—and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority, but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul, which meant that when he was in the city he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or auctoritas, his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.\n\n\nThe Roman triumph\nCredit was given to Augustus for every Roman military victory after the second settlement, because the majority of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the legatus who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a senatorial province, Augustus's proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory.  With few exceptions Augustus was the only individual who could receive a triumph, a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first king and first triumphant general. Licinius Crassus (grandson of the triumvir) was awarded a triumph for his victories in Thrace against the Germanic Bastarnae in 29–27 BC, but was denied other traditional honors. For celebrating his victory against the Garamantes in Roman Libya in 19 BC, Cornelius Balbus was the last person outside the family of Augustus to receive a triumph. Agrippa was awarded a triumph for his victories in Spain in 19 BC but he refused to celebrate it. Tiberius, Augustus's eldest stepson by Livia, received a triumph in 7 BC for victories in Germania in 8 BC, and again for victories in Illyria (Pannonia) in AD 9, celebrated in AD 12. For that campaign, his fellow commander Germanicus Julius Caesar was instead granted the ornamenta triumphalia ('triumphal honors'), a praetorship, and the ability to serve as a candidate for the consulship despite his young age.\n\n\nDiplomacy\n\nAugustus received emissaries from as far east as India, and his court included political exiles from as far north as the British Isles with the chieftains Dubnovellaunus and Tincomarus. Foreign embassies typically came to Augustus directly rather than to the Senate, though Augustus was careful to show respect to the Senate in certain cases. For instance, when the Parthians sent ambassadors to Augustus in 20 BC, he referred them to the Senate, but the latter sent them back to Augustus so they could negotiate solely with him instead. Petitions to Augustus from provinces and semi-autonomous municipalities were handled similarly to embassies of Roman client states and foreign countries, traveling to the court of the emperor as his administration moved to different locations across the Empire. In AD 8, the elderly Augustus assigned the exhausting work of managing foreign embassies to three ex-consuls, granting them the power to make all decisions that did not require serious debate in the Senate or oversight by the emperor.\n\n\nConspiracy, titles, and the share of power\n\nA food shortage in Rome during 22 BC sparked widespread panic, as many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis. After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome's grain supply through the use of his existing proconsular imperium, and ended the crisis almost immediately. It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a praefectus annonae, a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome.\nThere were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the second settlement, and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio. Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio. Murena, the outspoken consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus affair, was named among the conspirators. The conspirators were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor; the jury found them guilty, but it was not a unanimous verdict. All the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed as soon as they were captured—without ever giving testimony in their defense. Augustus ensured that the façade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.\nIn 19 BC, the Senate granted Augustus a form of general consular imperium, which was probably imperium consulare maius, like the proconsular powers that he received in 23 BC. Like his tribune authority, the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold. In addition, Augustus was allowed to wear the consul's insignia in public and before the Senate, as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the fasces, an emblem of consular authority. This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was a consul, the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary. On 6 March 12 BC, after the death of Lepidus, he additionally took up the position of pontifex maximus, the high priest of the college of the pontiffs, the most important position in Roman religion. On 5 February 2 BC, Augustus was also given the title pater patriae ('father of the country'), which was then inscribed in various places in Rome such as the Senate chambers in the Forum Romanum.\n\nIn terms of principate constitutional stability, historian Ronald Syme wrote that if Augustus were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war, given the public memory of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium. Possibly during the 20s BC and certainly by 18 BC, proconsular imperium was conferred upon Agrippa for five years, similar to Augustus's power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus's imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. Like Augustus, Agrippa was also granted the powers of the tribunate.\n\n\nWar and expansion\n\nBy AD 13, Augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed him imperator after a successful battle. Almost the entire fourth chapter in his publicly released memoirs of achievements known as the Res Gestae is devoted to his military victories and honours. Augustus also promoted the ideal of a superior Roman civilization with a task of ruling the world (to the extent to which the Romans knew it), a sentiment embodied in words that the contemporary poet Virgil attributes to a legendary ancestor of Augustus: tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento ('Roman, remember to rule the Earth's peoples with authority!'). The impulse for expansionism was apparently prominent among all classes at Rome, and it is accorded divine sanction by Virgil's Jupiter in Book 1 of the Aeneid, where Jupiter promises Rome imperium sine fine ('sovereignty without end').\nBy the end of his reign, the armies of Augustus had conquered northern Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal) and the Alpine regions of Raetia and Noricum (modern Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, Slovenia), Illyricum and Pannonia (modern Albania, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, etc.), and had extended the borders of Africa Proconsularis to the east and south. Judea was added to the province of Syria when Augustus deposed Herod Archelaus, successor to client king Herod the Great. After Syria was assigned to Augustus by the Senate in 27 BC it was initially governed by legates under Agrippa, and then by a high prefect of the equestrian class rather than by a proconsul or legate of Augustus (much like Egypt after Antony). In AD 6 an equestrian governor was also appointed in Sardinia after pirate raids necessitated the presence of troops stationed there.\n\nNo military effort was needed in 25 BC when Galatia (part of modern Turkey) was converted to a Roman province shortly after Amyntas of Galatia was killed by an avenging widow of a slain prince from Homonada. The rebellious tribes of Asturias and Cantabria in modern-day Spain were finally quelled in 19 BC by Agrippa, and the territory fell under the provinces of Hispania and Lusitania. This region proved to be a major asset in funding Augustus's future military campaigns, as it was rich in mineral deposits that could be fostered in Roman mining projects, especially the very rich gold deposits at Las Médulas.\nConquering the peoples of the Alps in 15 BC after the disastrous defeat of Marcus Lollius in 17/16 BC was another important victory for Rome, since it provided a large territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Rome's enemies in Germania to the north. Horace dedicated an ode to the victory, while the monumental Trophy of Augustus was built in La Turbie near Monaco to honor the occasion. The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12 BC, when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum, and his brother Nero Claudius Drusus moved against the Germanic tribes of the eastern Rhineland. Both campaigns were successful, as Drusus's forces reached the Elbe River by 9 BC—though he died shortly after from an injury sustained by falling off his horse. Tiberius rushed from Italy to Germany to see Drusus just before he died, and escorted his brother's body back to Rome, where he and Augustus provided eulogies for Drusus. After Illyrian tribes revolted in Illyricum in AD 6, their rebellion was quelled by forces under Tiberius and Germanicus in AD 9. This was the only major rebellion within Roman provincial territory since Augustus had become emperor, and by this point he had reduced the standing Roman army from roughly 500,000 soldiers during the civil wars down to 300,000 soldiers used primarily for foreign conquests.\nTo protect Rome's eastern territories from the Parthian Empire, Augustus relied on the client states of the east to act as territorial buffers and areas that could raise their own troops for defense. To ensure security of the empire's eastern flank, Augustus stationed a Roman army in Syria, while his skilled stepson Tiberius negotiated with the Parthians as Rome's diplomat to the East. Tiberius then restored Tigranes V to the throne of the Kingdom of Armenia in 20 BC, personally placing the crown on his head and replacing his brother Artavasdes IV as king.\nArguably Augustus's greatest diplomatic achievement was negotiating with Phraates IV of Parthia in 20 BC for the return of the battle standards lost by Crassus in the Battle of Carrhae, a symbolic victory and great boost of morale for Rome. Eck and Takács claim that this was a great disappointment for Romans seeking to avenge Crassus's defeat by military means. However, Augustus used the return of the standards as propaganda symbolizing the submission of Parthia to Rome. The event was celebrated in art such as the breastplate design on the statue Augustus of Prima Porta and in monuments such as the Temple of Mars Ultor ('Mars the Avenger') built to house the standards. After Phraates V of Parthia managed to cleave Armenia away from Roman control, Augustus dispatched his grandson Gaius Caesar with an army to Syria in 1 BC, mounting a diplomatic pressure campaign that in AD 2 convinced Phraates V to concede to Roman demands.\n\nParthia posed a threat to Rome in West Asia, but the more pressing concern was the battlefront along the Rhine and Danube rivers. Before the final fight with Antony, Octavian's campaigns against the tribes in Dalmatia were the first step in expanding Roman dominions to the Danube. Victory in battle was not always a permanent success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Rome's enemies in Germania. A prime example of Roman loss in battle was the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in AD 9, where three entire legions led by Publius Quinctilius Varus were destroyed by Arminius, leader of the Cherusci, a Roman citizen and apparent Roman ally. Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it in AD 10 and AD 11, and these campaigns had some success. However, Augustus advised Tiberius against further conquests after the loss at Teutoburg, and the Romans abandoned expansion into Germany beyond the Rhine. Augustus lamented the loss, but it is glossed over entirely in his Res Gestae, which merely states that he pacified Germania up to the mouth of the Elbe. Under Augustus's successor Tiberius, Roman general Germanicus took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and Segestes; at the Battle of Idistaviso in AD 16, he defeated Arminius.\n\nRome also experienced loss to the south in Arabia Felix against the Kingdom of Saba (in modern Yemen). In 26 BC Augustus had Gaius Aelius Gallus, prefect of Egypt, invade South Arabia with Roman troops supported by Jewish and Nabataean Arab auxiliaries. They aimed to conquer the Sabaeans or force them to accept client state status so that Rome could gain a share of their profitable trade with India. Roman forces laid siege to Marib, but retreated to Hejaz (under allied Nabataean control) after a shortage of water supplies. Southern suggests that this campaign might have been part of a failed two-pronged assault to flank the Parthian Empire, considering how Augustus encouraged Tiridates II of Parthia to invade Mesopotamia and reclaim his throne the same year.\nGaius Petronius, who replaced Aelius Gallus as prefect of Egypt, was ordered by Augustus to invade Aethiopia, after Queen Amanirenas of the Kingdom of Kush (in modern Sudan) invaded Roman Egypt in 24 BC and sacked Aswan and Philae. The Romans counterattacked, sacking Napata in Nubia before withdrawing, but Amanirenas invaded Roman Egypt again in 22 BC and threatened Primis (modern Qasr Ibrim). Petronius bolstered its defenses and withstood a Kushite assault, after which Amanirenas sent diplomats to negotiate a favorable peace treaty with Augustus while he was on the island of Samos. The treaty established Maharraqa as the new border with Kush (previously set at Aswan), and lessened the amount of Roman tribute gathered from Kush. It also guaranteed peaceful trade relations between Roman Egypt and Nubia for the next three centuries. Rome had better fortunes further west in the Maghreb of North Africa, where Cossus Cornelius Lentulus put down a rebellion of the Gaetuli against Rome's Mauretanian client ruler Juba II in AD 6.\n\n\nDeath and succession\n\nThe illness of Augustus in 23 BC and his lifelong struggles with ill health brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed to Augustus's unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.\n\n\nThe search for an heir\n\nSome Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sister's son Marcellus, who had been quickly married to Augustus's daughter Julia the Elder. Other historians dispute this due to the content of Augustus's will read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23 BC. The will indicated a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus's second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the empire together.\nAfter the death of Marcellus in 23 BC, Augustus married his daughter Julia to Agrippa in 21 BC. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Vipsania Julia, Agrippina, and Agrippa Postumus, so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died.  In 18 BC (and perhaps also earlier), Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus's authority), his seat of governance stationed at Samos in the eastern Aegean. This granting of power showed Augustus's favor for Agrippa, and upset some senators of the old aristocracy, but perhaps placated some members of the Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with Augustus.\nAugustus's intent became apparent to make his grandsons Gaius and Lucius his heirs when he adopted them as his own children. He took the consulship in 5 BC and 2 BC so that he could personally usher them into their respective political careers. Gaius was nominated for the consulship of AD 1 after serving in the priesthood until age 21, deferred from 6 BC when at age 14 he was elected consul but deemed by Augustus to be too young to serve. Lucius died before his designated consulship. Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livia's children from her first marriage, Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus (henceforth referred to as Drusus) and Tiberius Claudius (henceforth Tiberius), granting them military commands and public office, though seeming to favor Drusus. After Agrippa died in 12 BC, Tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife, Vipsania Agrippina, and marry Augustus's widowed daughter, Julia, as soon as a period of mourning for Agrippa had ended. Drusus's marriage to Augustus's niece Antonia was considered an unbreakable affair, whereas Vipsania, the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage, was deemed less important.\n\n\nTiberius, heir to Augustus\n\nTiberius shared in Augustus's tribune powers as of 6 BC but shortly thereafter went into retirement, reportedly wanting no further role in politics while he exiled himself to Rhodes. No specific reason is known for his departure, though it could have been a combination of reasons, including a failing marriage with Julia, who in 2 BC was banished to the island of Pandateria (modern Ventotene) by Augustus for committing adultery. Another possible reason would be his sense of envy and exclusion over Augustus's apparent favoring of the younger Gaius and Lucius. Gaius and Lucius joined the college of priests at an early age, were presented to spectators in a more favorable light, and were introduced to the army in Gaul.\nAfter the deaths of both Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively, and the earlier death of his brother Drusus (9 BC), Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD 4, where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he, in turn, adopt his nephew Germanicus. This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs. In AD 4 Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul, emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him, and he was eventually awarded with a triumph. In October AD 12 Tiberius was granted proconsular imperium over the entire empire and not just the western half where he had been campaigning in Germania, and in AD 13 he was granted an equal level of imperium with that of Augustus for a ten-year term.\n\nThe only other possible claimant as heir was Agrippa Postumus. However, he had been exiled by Augustus to Sorrento in AD 6 and then to Planasia AD 7. His banishment was made permanent by senatorial decree, and Augustus officially disowned him for his lack of good character and alleged involvement in a conspiracy. The historian Erich S. Gruen notes various contemporary sources that state Agrippa Postumus was a \"vulgar young man, brutal and brutish, and of depraved character\". After Tiberius succeeded Augustus, he was most likely the one who had Agrippa killed in exile.\n\n\nDeath of Augustus\nOn 19 August AD 14, Augustus died while visiting Nola, where his father had died. Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that Livia was rumored to have brought about Augustus's death by poisoning fresh figs. This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustus's life, but some historians view it as likely to have been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favored Postumus as heir, or other political enemies of Tiberius. Livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are unlikely to have been true. Alternatively, it is possible that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustus's health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir. It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed to the succession of Tiberius, in order not to endanger that transition of power.\n\nAugustus's famous last words were, \"Have I played the part well? Then applaud as I exit\" (Acta est fabula, plaudite)—referring to the play-acting and regal authority that he had put on as emperor. An enormous funerary procession of mourners travelled with Augustus's body from Nola to Rome, and all public and private businesses closed on the day of his burial. Tiberius and his son Drusus delivered the eulogy while standing atop two rostra. Augustus's body was coffin-bound and cremated on a pyre close to his mausoleum.\n\n\nDeification\n\nOn 17 September 27 BC Augustus was proclaimed by the Senate to have joined the company of the gods and his adoptive father Julius Caesar as a member of the Roman pantheon. People in Rome's eastern provinces had worshipped him as a living deity since his victory at Actium. There was even limited worship of him as a living god in some of Rome's western provinces, primarily at Lugdunum (modern Lyon, France) and Oppidum Ubiorum (modern Cologne, Germany), but not in Rome itself where this claim was highly taboo during his reign. Only his genius (spirit or general divine nature) was allowed worship there.\nHistorian D. C. A. Shotter states that Augustus's policy of favoring the Julian family line over the Claudian might have afforded Tiberius sufficient cause to show open disdain for Augustus after the latter's death; instead, Tiberius was always quick to rebuke those who criticized Augustus. Shotter suggests that Augustus's deification obliged Tiberius to suppress any open resentment that he might have harbored, coupled with Tiberius's \"extremely conservative\" attitude towards religion. Also, historian R. Shaw-Smith points to letters of Augustus to Tiberius which display affection towards Tiberius and high regard for his military merits. Shotter states that Tiberius focused his anger and criticism on Gaius Asinius Gallus (for marrying Vipsania after Augustus forced Tiberius to divorce her), as well as toward the two young Caesars, Gaius and Lucius—instead of Augustus, the real architect of his divorce and imperial demotion.\n\n\nLegacy\n\n\nOverview\nAugustus created a regime that maintained relative peace and prosperity in the Latin West and Greek East for two centuries, initiating the celebrated Pax Romana (or Pax Augusta), though Galinsky affirms that the \"Augustan Golden Age\" myth obscures the complicated political challenges that Augustus had to face during his reign. His regime laid the foundations of a concept of universal monarchy in the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Rome) and the Holy Roman Empires down to their dissolutions in 1453 and 1806, respectively. The reign of Augustus was viewed favorably by later Romans, embodied by the Senate's formal wish to every emperor after Trajan that they \"be more fortunate than Augustus and better than Trajan\". This positive overall image was also helped by his successors copying a lot of Augustus's policies and forms of self-promotion, which modern research calls ‘imitatio Augusti’.\nAugustus's adoptive surname, Caesar, and his title augustus became the permanent titles of the rulers of the Roman Empire for fourteen centuries after his death, in use both at Rome and Constantinople following the reign of Constantine I and the division of the Roman Empire. His adoptive name Caesar formed the root of later regnal titles such as the German kaiser and Russian czar. His title of civilis princeps was preferred by emperors for three centuries until they adopted the title domini ('lords'), beginning with Diocletian. His adoptive name Imperator ('victorious general') served as the etymological root of the word 'emperor', though it did not possess this connotation in Augustus's lifetime.\n\n\nWritten works\nAugustus composed an account of his achievements, the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, to be inscribed in bronze in front of his mausoleum. Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the empire upon his death. The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it, were inscribed on many public edifices such as the temple in Ankara dubbed the Monumentum Ancyranum, and were called the \"queen of inscriptions\" by historian Theodor Mommsen. The Res Gestae is the only major work by Augustus to have survived, though he is also known to have composed poems entitled \"Sicily\", \"Epiphanus\", and \"Ajax\", an autobiography of 13 books, a philosophical treatise, and a written rebuttal to Brutus's Eulogy of Cato. Historians are able to analyze excerpts of letters penned by Augustus, preserved in various works of antiquity that reveal additional facts or clues about his personal life. The poet Martial preserved a sexually crude poem allegedly written by Octavian during the Perusine War, which pokes fun at Glaphyra, Antony, and Fulvia.\nIn his Res Gestae, Augustus defined the relative peace established by his reign as a pact \"born of victories\" (parta victoriis pax), one that brought disastrous Roman civil wars to an end. It ensured Romans and subjugated peoples within their Empire upheld a cohesive social pact: the latter would relinquish their sovereignty and pay taxes in exchange for the preservation of their native customs, economic stability, security and protection afforded to them by Rome. This theme of peace being rooted in conquest is also featured prominently in Augustan-era visual artworks. By boasting of his many conquests, the Res Gestae of Augustus emphasizes the same code of honor found in Republican funerary inscriptions such as those of the Scipios, a key element in elevating the political reputation of Roman families.\n\n\nEnduring institutions\n\nThe city of Rome was thoroughly transformed under Augustus, with Rome's first institutionalized police force, firefighting force, and the establishment of the praefectus ('municipal prefect') as a permanent office. Established in AD 6 and based on previous (but inadequate) firefighting services established in 22 BC and 7 BC (the first iteration consisted of slaves belonging to Senator Marcus Egnatius Rufus), the vigiles was a combined fire brigade and police force divided into cohorts of 500 to 1,000 men each, with seven units assigned to fourteen divided city sectors. A praefectus vigilum ('prefect of the watch') was put in charge of the vigiles, whereas vicomagistri officials had previously been in charge of each district following the fire of 7 BC. Augustus was also able to create a standing army for the Roman Empire, fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers, reduced from 60 legions at the end of the Republican civil wars in 30 BC. This was supported by numerous auxiliary units of 500 non-citizen soldiers each, often recruited from recently conquered areas.\nWith his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy, Augustus installed an official courier system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the praefectus vehiculorum. Besides the advent of swifter communication among Italian polities, his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Rome's armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country. In the year 6 Augustus established the aerarium militare, donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers.\nOne of the most enduring institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the Praetorian Guard in 27 BC, commanded by the praetorian prefect after this office was created by Augustus in 2 BC. Originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield, the praetorians evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome. They had the power to intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked. The last emperor they served was Maxentius, as it was Constantine I who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the Castra Praetoria.\n\n\nRevenue reforms\n\nAugustus's public revenue reforms had a great impact on the subsequent success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as during the Republic. This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces. It also avoided sparking provincial resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.\nThe measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province. Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces. Indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the next of kin.\nAn equally important reform was the abolition of private tax farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors who collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. These tax farmers, called publicani, were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, and the right to tax local areas. Due to protest from equestrians, the suffect consuls for 9 AD modified and lessened penalties in the Lex Papia Poppaea that affected the inheritance of estates by celibate, unmarried, or childless individuals, though it continued to generate revenues with properties of the deceased seized by the state.\nThe use of Egypt's immense land rents to finance the Empire's operations resulted from Augustus's conquest of Egypt and the shift to a Roman form of government. As it was effectively considered Augustus's private property rather than a province of the Empire, it became part of each succeeding emperor's patrimonium. Instead of a legate or proconsul, Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports. This position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming Prefect of the Praetorian Guard. The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions. Gold and silver found in the Ptolemaic royal treasury was melted down for minting coins. In his will, Augustus left money to members of his family such as his wife Livia but also 43 million sesterces to the Roman people, 1,000 sesterces to every praetorian, 500 sesterces to every soldier in urban cohorts, and 300 sesterces to each legionary soldier.\n\n\nMonth of August\n\nThe month of August (Latin: Augustus) was named after Augustus in 8 BC. Until his time it was called Sextilis (or Sextilus), named so because it had been the sixth month of the original Roman calendar, which was based on the lunar cycle. Sextilis, the eighth month in the Julian calendar established by Julius Caesar, which was based on the solar cycle, was chosen by Augustus due to it being the month in which he had first served as a consul and won various victories. In comparison, the month of July (Latin: Iulius) was named after his adoptive father Julius Caesar, the only other month in the Roman calendar named after a Roman statesman.\n\n\nBuilding projects\n\n\nRemodeling of Rome\n\nOn his deathbed, Augustus boasted that he converted Rome from a city of bricks into one of marble. Marble could be found in buildings of Rome before Augustus, but it was not extensively used as a building material in Rome until the reign of Augustus. This did not apply to the Subura slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever. However, he did leave a mark on the monumental topography of the city's center, as well as on the Campus Martius with the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central gnomon was an obelisk taken from Egypt. The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus's triumphs in the Res Gestae. Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.\nThe Corinthian order of architectural style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome. Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital, yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment. They did so by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the Greek model, incorporating both Classical and Hellenistic elements and having many Athenian monuments serve as direct inspirations.\n\nAugustus was responsible for the erection of the Temple of Caesar, the Temple of Jupiter Tonans, the Temple of Apollo Palatinus and the Baths of Agrippa, and the Forum of Augustus with its Temple of Mars Ultor. Other projects were either encouraged by him, such as the Theatre of Balbus, and Agrippa's construction of the Pantheon, or funded by him in the name of others, often relations (e.g. Portico of Octavia, Theatre of Marcellus). Even his tomb in Rome was built before his death to house members of his family. To celebrate his victory at the Battle of Actium, the Arch of Augustus was built in 29 BC near the entrance of the Temple of Castor and Pollux, and widened in 19 BC to include a triple-arch design. Augustus barely mentions Julius Caesar in the Res Gestae, but he completed construction projects initiated by him, such as the Curia Julia (a meeting place of the Senate), the Forum of Caesar, and the Temple of Venus Genetrix (allowing the statue of Cleopatra inside it to remain). He also rebuilt the Basilica Aemilia by 2 BC (previously burned down in a fire of 35 BC).\nAugustus also provided grand spectacles in Rome. In addition to staging lion hunts in the Circus Maximus, he also temporarily flooded the Circus Flaminius so that hunters could slaughter crocodiles for entertaining crowds, and held gladiator games in the Saepta Julia. In 2 BC he also staged an elaborate mock naval battle, the naumachia Augusti, by creating an artificial lake on the west bank of the Tiber, its waters fed by a newly built aqueduct, the Aqua Alsietina that stretched for over twenty miles. In a lethal performance, the combatants reenacted the 480 BC Battle of Salamis between the Greek city-states led by Athens and the Persian Achaemenid Empire. Over two centuries later Dio wrote that some of the structures built for this occasion were still standing.\n\n\nPublic works\n\nAugustus put Agrippa in charge of Rome's water supply, sanitation, drainage system, public baths, and road repairs. After the death of Agrippa in 12 BC, a solution had to be found in maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile in 33 BC, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense. In 33 BC Agrippa built the Aqua Julia aqueduct, along with new cisterns and water towers. In 12 BC, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair. \nIn the late Augustan era, the commission of five senators called the curatores locorum publicorum iudicandorum ('Supervisors of Public Property') was put in charge of maintaining public buildings and temples of the state cult. Augustus created the senatorial group of the curatores viarum ('supervisors for roads') for the upkeep of roads; this senatorial commission worked with local officials and contractors to organize regular repairs. Augustus repaired all bridges in Rome except the Milvian and Minucian ones, and paved the Via Flaminia between Rome and Ariminum.\n\n\nResidences\n\nThe official residence of Augustus was the Domus Augusti ('House of Augustus') on the Palatine Hill, though its identification is not certain. According to Suetonius the home was somewhat modest, though if the home should be identified archaeologically with the Carettoni house west of the Palatine temple of Apollo, Augustus's residence would have been substantially larger and more luxurious than the literary sources admit. Galinsky asserts that it is no coincidence that Augustus is often shown on coinage wearing the civic crown with laurels highly associated with Apollo, having dedicated this temple to Apollo near his home in 28 BC. Southern insists that Octavian built the temple near his home in honor of Diana, Apollo's twin sister, who was believed to have divinely assisted Octavian in his victory at the 36 BC Battle of Naulochus. The Domus Augusti is also located near the Casa Romuli ('House of Romulus'), the alleged domicile of Rome's legendary founder Romulus. Southern contends that Augustus was keen to stress his connection to him. The House of Livia is located nearby as well, identified with an inscription on a lead water pipe, though it is unclear if Augustus's wife occupied the residence before his death.\nOutside of Rome, Augustus owned three countryside villas, which were not extravagant by contemporary standards but did have ornamental gardens. Augustus built the Palazzo a Mare palace on the island of Capri, where he hosted a sizable collection of fossils and what may have been dinosaur bones (referred to as 'bones of giants'). At the Villa Giulia on the island of Ventotene, where Augustus exiled his daughter Julia, he constructed a sophisticated hypocaust central heating system for two large bathtubs and a caldarium hot plunge bath. The family home of Augustus was a villa located in Nola, where he and his father died. This residence was probably the villa discovered at Somma Vesuviana.\n\n\nCritical analysis\n\nHistorians Eck and Takács assert that the attrition of civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus's reign must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a de facto monarchy. Augustus's experiences, patience, tact, and political acumen also played their parts. He was responsible for establishing a standing professional army stationed along the frontiers, the dynastic principle of the imperial succession, and the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus's ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. Every emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title. \nHistorian Walter Eder contends that, although Augustus was the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire, he wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to address the concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29 BC, Augustus gave 400 sesterces (equal to one-tenth of a Roman pound of gold) each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28 BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.\n\n\nAncient and contemporary views\nHowever, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages. The contemporary Roman jurist Marcus Antistius Labeo, fond of the days of pre-Augustan republican liberty in which he had been born, openly criticized the Augustan regime. In the beginning of his Annals, Tacitus wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery. He continued to say that, with Augustus's death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius, the people of Rome traded one slaveholder for another. Tacitus was of the belief that emperor Nerva (r. 96–98) successfully \"mingled two formerly alien ideas, principate and liberty\". The 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign, moderate ruler, yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus, Dio viewed Augustus as an autocrat. The 1st-century poet Marcus Annaeus Lucanus was of the opinion that Caesar's victory over Pompey and the fall of Cato the Younger in 46 BC marked the end of traditional liberty in Rome. Historian Chester Starr writes of Annaeus Lucanus's avoidance of criticizing Augustus: \"perhaps Augustus was too sacred a figure to accuse directly\".\n\nDebate still exists among modern academics about the extent to which Augustus utilized censorship of criticism or allowed free speech in his Empire, though the consensus is that he engaged in constant self-promotion. As triumvir Octavian, he destroyed all public records dating from the Ides of March 44 BC to the defeat Sextus Pompeius in 36 BC, a convenient political move for him that seemed to align with popular sentiment of purging painful memories about the proscriptions. The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire. Octavian was Virgil's patron when the latter penned his Eclogues, which express the discontented views of impoverished farmers and landowners during the triumvirate. Yet Augustus was responsible for the exile of the poet Ovid in c. AD 8, and banning of his literature. Ovid suggested that this was in reprisal for writing a poem and making a mistake, perhaps being a witness to a sexual scandal involving either Julia the Elder (Augustus's daughter) or Julia the Younger (Augustus's granddaughter).\nTacitus claimed that the discipline of history declined under Augustus due to flattery of the emperor by historians rather than by active suppression of historical literature. Livy wrote the most highly influential work of history during Augustus's reign. Despite championing many of the emperor's views, Goldsworthy asserts that Livy was not \"an official mouthpiece\" of the emperor, was critical of Julius Caesar, and Tacitus claimed that Augustus even lightly criticized Livy for glorifying the career of Pompey. Goldsworthy insists that there were only a few rare instances of Augustus censoring literature, which perhaps included Antonia Minor pressuring Claudius, her son with Drusus and a future emperor, to refrain from writing a history on Rome's civil wars.\n\n\nEarly modern and modern perspectives\nViews on Augustus varied during the early modern period. The Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift, in his 1701 Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome, criticized Augustus for installing tyranny over Rome, and likened what he believed Great Britain's virtuous constitutional monarchy to Rome's moral Republic of the 2nd century BC. In his criticism of Augustus, the Scottish admiral and historian Thomas Gordon compared Augustus to the puritanical tyrant Oliver Cromwell. Thomas Gordon and the French political philosopher Montesquieu both remarked that Augustus was a coward in battle, his alleged cowardliness also hinted at strongly by English playwright Shakespeare in his portrayal of 'Caesar' (Augustus) in the 1607 play Antony & Cleopatra. In his 1753 Memoirs of the Court of Augustus, the Scottish scholar Thomas Blackwell deemed Augustus a Machiavellian ruler, \"a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper\", \"wicked and worthless\", \"a mean spirit\", and a \"tyrant\". However, during the 19th century Augustus was viewed favorably as a figure who brought stability, prosperity, and peace after a tumultuous period caused by a failed Republic.\n\nAttitudes about Augustus shifted once again during the 20th century, as scholarship during the upheavals of fascism and WWII in the 1930s and 1940s generally held negative views about Augustus's seizure of state powers. Subsequently more peaceful times have led to a greater focus on the art and literature produced in the Augustan age. Ronald Syme, who sparked debate by publishing the then controversial The Roman Revolution (1939) at the onset of WWII, acknowledged the political climate that impacted his research, rejecting fascist appropriations of ancient Rome while examining the misuse of political terminology and deceptive language employed by totalitarian regimes. Goldsworthy cautions that, while Benito Mussolini styled himself as Il Duce after dux Augustus, the general temptation to compare Augustus to either him or Hitler and Stalin is anachronistic and inaccurate. He highlights how Augustus was no more ruthless than \"other warlords\" even when considering the lethal proscriptions against his rivals, some of whom had been pardoned by Julius Caesar before betraying the latter, a fact the triumvirs had strongly emphasized.\nThe Roman Revolution was not circulated in continental Europe until its revised publication in 1952, but this and other works by Syme left a major impact on scholarship in the English-speaking world and its views on Augustus in particular. Syme viewed Octavian as a \"sickly and sinister youth,\" and the so-called \"party of Augustus\" as an entity somewhat analogous to a modern crime syndicate. Syme criticized some academics for attributing to Octavian various political achievements that were initiated by Julius Caesar, their ready acceptance of Augustan propaganda about Mark Antony, and the view of Augustus as a flawless organizer and peacemaker. Goldsworthy largely agrees with Syme, but argues that he was \"extremely charitable in his judgements of Antony and deliberately harsh in his comments on Augustus’s supporters, especially the majority who came from outside the established aristocracy\". Goldsworthy also takes issue with the often repeated idea in academia that Augustus attempted to distance himself from Julius Caesar the man and dictator when embracing the deified Caesar, claiming there is no explicit evidence for it. Southern contends that this is implicitly evidenced by Augustan literature's portrayal of Julius Caesar as divine while rarely mentioning his acts as dictator, and that Octavian-Augustus placed less emphasis on Divus Julius and more on his own role as princeps over time.\n\n\nCultural depictions\n\n\nPhysical appearance and official images\n\nIn The Twelve Caesars, Roman historian Suetonius provided a biography on Augustus and wrote about his appearance. According to Goldsworthy, descriptions of hair color in ancient Roman sources are difficult to decipher, and Suetonius' comment that Augustus's curly hair was inclined towards golden (subflavum) could mean \"slightly blond\" or \"simply mean brown rather than black\" hair. Scientific analysis of traces of paint found in his official statues shows that he most likely had naturally light brown hair. Given descriptions by Suetonius, it is estimated that Octavius-Augustus was about 5 foot 9 inches in height, and, conscious of his short stature, may have worn built-up soles in his shoes to appear taller.\nAmong the best known of many surviving portraits of Augustus are the Prima Porta Statue, his sculpted relief on the Ara Pacis, and the sculpted Via Labicana Augustus, the latter which depicts him in his role as pontifex maximus. Prominent cameo portraits include the Blacas Cameo and Gemma Augustea. The official images of Augustus were very tightly controlled and idealized, drawing from a tradition of Hellenistic portraiture rather than the tradition of realism in Roman portraiture. Archaeologist Susan Walker and numismatist Andrew Burnett assert that Octavian first appeared on coins by the age of 19, and from c. 29 BC \"the explosion in the number of Augustan portraits attests a concerted propaganda campaign aimed at dominating all aspects of civil, religious, economic and military life with Augustus's person\". The early images depicted a young man and, although there were gradual changes, his images remained youthful until he died in his seventies, by which time they had \"a distanced air of ageless majesty\", according to the classicist R. R. R. Smith. \nPersonalized portraits of living individuals were first introduced on Roman coins by Julius Caesar in the 40s BC, and Augustus's image on coins is perhaps one means by which he emulated his adoptive father. Southern insists that it is still unclear who precisely controlled images and legends seen on coins, or how they were fully perceived by people across the Empire, though it is possible Augustus personally dictated how these portraits appeared. Goldsworthy notes how Augustus's name and image became universal on coinage throughout the Empire, and how the 'Caesar' mentioned by the prophet Jesus in the New Testament in reference to the figure on silver coins used by Jews and others for paying taxes was most likely Augustus rather than Tiberius.\n\n\nPost-classical visual artworks\n\nAugustus has also been depicted in various artworks following classical antiquity. In 1765 French painter Charles-André van Loo was commissioned by Louis XV to create a painting depicting Augustus closing the gates of the Temple of Janus in the Roman Forum, a symbolic act signaling that Rome was at peace. Although Louis XV disliked this and other paintings of monarchical virtue, having them removed from his royal hunting lodge, historian Mary Beard contends that van Loo's painting served as \"an appropriate backdrop\" during the signing of the 1802 Treaty of Amiens during the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon III commissioned French painter Jean-Léon Gérôme to create the painting titled The Age of Augustus, the Birth of Christ (c. 1852–1854), which blends classical and gothic elements and depicts Augustus on an imperial dais above a nativity scene, juxtaposing the birth of Jesus with the peace brought about by the reign of Augustus. It was exhibited in Paris at the 1855 Universal Exposition world's fair.\n\n\nTheater, film, televised series, and novels\n\nAccording to historian Adrian Goldsworthy, Augustus is not as widely known as his great-uncle Julius Caesar and is often sidelined as a minor character or brooding villain in theatrical plays, films, and novels, attributing this to the fact that William Shakespeare never wrote a play centered around him. Shakespeare's 1599 play Julius Caesar features the character of Octavius, and Augustus is named as Caesar in the 1607 play Antony and Cleopatra, in which he plays a foil to Antony as a weak, cowardly, and manipulative foe. Goldsworthy claims this view is based on ancient primary sources that reflect the propaganda war waged between Antony and Octavian, and is also manifested in the cold performance of actor Roddy McDowall as Octavian in the 1963 film Cleopatra. The 1934 historical fiction novel I, Claudius by Robert Graves and its subsequent 1976 television series depict the older Augustus in a far more sympathetic light as he is outmaneuvered by his murderous wife Livia, though he plays only a supporting character.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nAncient sources\n\n\nModern sources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\nWorks by and about Augustus at Perseus Digital Library\nGallery of the Ancient Art: August\nAugustus – short biography on the BBC's History section\n\"Augustus Caesar and the Pax Romana\" – essay by Steven Kreis about Augustus's legacy at the History Guide\n\"De Imperatoribus Romanis\" – article about Augustus by Garrett G.
