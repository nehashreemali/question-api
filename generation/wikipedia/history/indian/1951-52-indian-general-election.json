Voters elected 489 members of the first Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India. Elections to most of the state legislatures were held simultaneously. It was the first Indian election with full universal franchise.\nThe elections were conducted under the provisions of the constitution adopted on 26 November 1949. After the adoption of the constitution, the Constituent Assembly continued to act as the interim parliament, while an interim cabinet was headed by Jawaharlal Nehru. An Election Commission was created in 1949 and in March 1950 Sukumar Sen was appointed as the first Chief Election Commissioner. A month later parliament passed the Representation of the People Act which set out how the elections for parliament and state legislatures would be conducted. The 489 elected seats of the Lok Sabha were allotted across 401 constituencies in 25 states. There were 314 constituencies electing one member using the first-past-the-post system. 86 constituencies elected two members, one from the general category and one from Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes. There was one constituency with three elected representatives. The multi-seat constituencies were created as reserved seats for backward sections of society, and were abolished in the 1960s. The constitution at this time also provided for two Anglo-Indian members to be nominated by the President of India.\nA total of 1,949 candidates competed for 489 elected seats in the Lok Sabha. Each candidate was allotted a different coloured ballot box at the polling booth, on which the candidate's name and symbol were written. 16,500 clerks were appointed on a contract of six months to type and collate the electorate rolls and 380,000 reams of paper were used for printing the rolls. A total of 173,212,343 voters were registered (excluding Jammu and Kashmir) out of a population of 361,088,090 according to the 1951 census, making it the largest election conducted at the time. All Indian citizens over the age of 21 were eligible to vote.\nDue to the harsh climate and challenging logistics, the election was held in 68 phases. A total of 196,084 polling booths were set up, of which 27,527 booths were reserved for women. The majority of voting took place in early 1952, but Himachal Pradesh voted in 1951 as its weather was commonly inclement in February and March, with heavy snow impending free movement. The remainder of states voted in February–March 1952, except for Jammu & Kashmir, where no voting took place for Lok Sabha seats until 1967. The first votes of the election were cast in the tehsil (district) of Chini in Himachal Pradesh.\nThe result was a landslide victory for the Indian National Congress (INC), which received 45% of the vote and won 364 of the 489 elected seats. The second-placed Socialist Party received only 11% of the vote and won twelve seats. Jawaharlal Nehru became the first democratically elected Prime Minister of the country.\n\n\nContesting parties\nA total of 53 parties and 533 independents contested the 489 seats.\nSeveral ministers resigned from their posts and formed their own parties to contest the elections. Syama Prasad Mukherjee established the Jana Sangh in October 1951 and Law Minister B. R. Ambedkar revived the Scheduled Castes Federation (which was later named the Republican Party). Congress party president Purushottam Das Tandon resigned from his post because of differences with Nehru.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nResults by state\n\n\nAssam\n\n\nBihar\n\n\nBombay\n\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\n\nMadras\n\n\nOrissa\n\n\nPunjab\n\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\n\nWest Bengal\n\n\nHyderabad\n\n\nMadhya Bharat\n\n\nMysore\n\n\nPatiala and East Punjab States Union\n\n\nRajasthan\n\n\nSaurashtra\n\n\nTravancore Cochin\n\n\nAjmer\n\n\nBhopal\n\n\nBislaspur\n\nBilaspur constituency was uncontested\n\n\nCoorg\n\n\nDelhi\n\n\nHimachal Pradesh\n\n\nKutch\n\n\nManipur\n\n\nTripura\n\n\nVindhya Pradesh\n\n\nGovernment formation\nThe speaker of the first Lok Sabha was Ganesh Vasudev Mavalankar.

Ambedkar was defeated in the Bombay (North Central) constituency as Scheduled Castes Federation candidate by his little-known former assistant and Congress Candidate Narayan Sadoba Kajrolkar, who polled 138,137 votes compared to Ambedkar's 123,576 votes. Ambedkar then entered the parliament as a Rajya Sabha member. He contested a by-poll from Bhandara in 1954 in another attempt to enter the Lok Sabha, but again lost, standing third behind PSP winner Ashok Mehta & Congress runner-up B. N. Arjun.\nAcharya Kripalani lost from Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh as a KMPP candidate, but his wife Sucheta Kripalani defeated the Congress candidate Manmohini Sahgal in Delhi.\n\n\nSee also\nList of members of the 1st Lok Sabha\nElection Commission of India\n1952 Indian presidential election\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nGuha, Ramachandra. \"Democracy's Biggest Gamble\", World Policy Journal, (Spring 2002) 19#1 pp. 95–103",
