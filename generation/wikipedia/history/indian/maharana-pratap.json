  "extract": "Pratap Singh I (18 May 1540 – 19 January 1597), popularly known as Maharana Pratap (IPA: [məɦaːˈɾaːɳaː pɾəˈtaːp] ), was king of the Kingdom of Mewar, in north-western India in the present-day state of Rajasthan, from 1572 until his death in 1597. He is notable for leading the Rajput resistance against the expansionist policy of the Mughal Emperor Akbar including the battle of Haldighati.\n\n\nEarly life and accession\nMaharana Pratap was born to Udai Singh II of Mewar and Jaiwanta Bai in 1540, the year in which Udai Singh ascended to the throne after defeating Vanvir Singh. His younger brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had two stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. His chief consort was Ajabde Bai Punwar of Bijolia. Their eldest son was Amar Singh I. He belonged to the royal family of Mewar. After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai Bhatiyani wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him but senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed and Pratap ascended the throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line of the Sisodia Rajputs. He was crowned in Gogunda on the auspicious day of Holi. Jagmal swore revenge and left for Ajmer, to join the armies of Emperor Akbar who later gave him a portion of Sirohi.\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nInitial conflict with the Mughals\n\n\nBackground\nAkbar initially favored diplomacy over direct conflict in his dealings with Maharana Pratap. Although Jagmal, Pratap's rival, sought Akbar’s support and had been named successor by his father, the emperor refrained from military intervention—largely due to ongoing unrest in Gujarat. Instead, Akbar dispatched several emissaries to negotiate with Pratap, including Jalal Khan, Man Singh, Raja Bhagwant das, and Todar Mal. However, all these attempts ended in failure. Pratap consistently resisted submission, either by making ambiguous promises or by declining to meet the envoys altogether. Rajput sources claim that Pratap even insulted Man Singh by avoiding a feast held in his honor, an account many modern historians consider exaggerated. The breakdown of negotiations likely stemmed from Akbar’s demands—such as personal attendance at the Mughal court, payment of tribute, political allegiance, or a matrimonial alliance—all of which were unacceptable to Pratap. By late 1573 A.D., it had become evident that a peaceful resolution was unlikely, and a military confrontation appeared inevitable. \nSome scholars suggest that a key but often overlooked point of contention between Akbar and Maharana Pratap was an elephant named Ram Prasad. Historical sources such as ʽAbd al-Qadir Badayuni and Abul Fazl mention that Akbar had repeatedly requested this elephant from the Rana, but Pratap refused to surrender it. The elephant was eventually captured by the Mughal army during the Battle of Haldighati and brought to Akbar. Badauni even describes Ram Prasad as a subject of dispute. This incident has been interpreted by some historians as further evidence of Pratap’s unwillingness to submit to Mughal authority, casting doubt on claims that he ever sent his son Amar Singh or any proposal to Akbar’s court, as suggested by Abu'l-Fazl.\nThe conflicts between Pratap Singh and Akbar led to the Battle of Haldighati.\nAccording to Indian Journal of Secularism, in his campaign to extend his empire, Akbar presented Rana Pratap with the rank of Panj Hazari (commander of an army of 5,000). Rana Pratap refused, demanding instead the rank of Dah Hazari (commander of an army of 10,000).leading to battle of haldighati.\n\n\nBattle of Haldighati\n\nThe Siege of Chittorgarh in 1567-1568 had led to the loss of the fertile eastern belt of Mewar to the Mughals. However, the rest of the wooded and hilly kingdom in the Aravalli range was still under the control of Maharana Pratap. Mughal Emperor Akbar was intent on securing a stable route to Gujarat through Mewar; when Pratap Singh was crowned king (Maharana) in 1572, Akbar sent a number of envoys, including one by Raja Man Singh I of Amer, entreating him to become a vassal like many other rulers in Rajputana. When Pratap refused to personally submit to Akbar and several attempts to diplomatically settle the issue failed, war became inevitable.\nThe forces of Pratap Singh and Mughal and Rajput general Man Singh met on 18 June 1576 beyond a narrow mountain pass at Haldighati near Gogunda, modern day Rajsamand in Rajasthan. This came to be known as the battle of Haldighati. Pratap Singh fielded a force of around 3000 cavalry and 400 Bhil archers. Man Singh commanded an army numbering around 10,000 men.  After a fierce battle lasting more than three hours, Pratap found himself wounded and the day lost. He managed to retreat to the hills and lived to fight another day. The Mughals were victorious and inflicted significant casualties among the forces of Mewar but failed to capture Maharana Pratap.\nRana Pratap was able to escape due to selfless devotion of chief of Jhala who drew upon himself the attack of armies by declaring himself to be Rana.\nHaldighati was a futile victory for the Mughals, as they were unable to kill or capture Pratap, or any of his close family members in Udaipur. While the sources also claim that Pratap was able to make a successful escape, Man Singh managed to conquer Gogunda within a week after Haldighati then ended his campaign. Subsequently, Akbar himself led a sustained campaign against the Rana in September 1576, and soon, Gogunda, Udaipur, and Kumbhalgarh were all under Mughal control.\n\n\nPost-Haldighati Mughal invasions\nShahbaz Khan Kamboh led multiple invasions that resulted in the subjugation of key areas in Mewar, such as Kumbhalgarh, Mandalgarh, Gogunda, and Central Mewar, bringing them permanently under Mughal rule. The Mughal Empire established its supremacy in Mewar after Shahbaz Khan's invasions. This ultimately led to a significant weakening of Pratap's power, forcing him to seek shelter in his hilly abode.\n\n\nPatronage of art\nMaharana Pratap's court at Chavand provided refuge to numerous poets, artists, writers, and artisans. During his reign, the Chavand school of art emerged and developed as a distinctive artistic tradition. His support for cultural activities is evidenced by the presence of notable figures such as the artist Nasiruddin in his court.\n\n\nReconquest of Mewar\nMughal pressure on Mewar relaxed after 1579 following rebellions in Bengal and Bihar and Mirza Hakim's incursion into the Punjab. After this Akbar sent Jagannath Kachhwaha to invade Mewar in 1584. This time too Mewar army defeated Mughals and forced them to retreat. In 1585, Akbar moved to Lahore and remained there for the next twelve years watching the situation in the north-west. No major Mughal expedition was sent to Mewar during this period. Taking advantage of the situation, Pratap recovered some of the Mughal occupied areas of Mewar and captured thirty-six Mughal outposts. Udaipur, Mohi, Gogunda, Mandal and Pandwara were some of the important areas that were recaptured during this conflict. According to the 1588 inscription near Jahazpur, the Rana gave the lands of Pander to a trusted follower called Sadulnath Trivedi. G.N. Sharma claims that the Pander inscription is proof that the Rana had occupied north-eastern Mewar and was granting lands to those who had been loyal to him. From 1585 till his death, the Rana had recovered a large part of Mewar. The citizens who had migrated out of Mewar started returning during this time. There was good monsoon which helped to revive the agriculture of Mewar. The economy also started getting better and trade in the area started increasing. The Rana was able to capture the territories around Chittor but could not fulfill his dream of capturing Chittor itself.\n\n\nDeath\nMaharana Pratap reportedly died from injuries sustained in a hunting accident at Chavand on 19 January 1597, at the age of 56. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Amar Singh I. On his deathbed, Pratap is said to have instructed his son never to submit to the Mughals and to make efforts to reclaim Chittor.\nAccording to some accounts, the Mughal emperor Akbar was deeply affected upon hearing the news of Maharana Pratap's death. The court poet Dursa Arha is said to have eulogised Pratap in the Mughal court as a mark of respect.\n\n\nLegacy\n\nMaharana Pratap is a prominent figure in both folk and contemporary Rajasthani culture and is viewed as a folk hero and celebrated warrior in that state, as well as in India as a whole.\nHistorian Satish Chandra notes –\n\n\"Rana Pratap's defiance of the mighty Mughal empire, almost alone and unaided by the other Rajput states, constitute a glorious saga of Rajput valour and the spirit of self sacrifice for cherished principles. Rana Pratap's methods of guerrilla warfare was later elaborated further by Malik Ambar, the Deccani general, and by Shivaji\".\nBandyopadhyay also seconds Satish Chandra's view with the observation that \n\nPratap's successful defiance of Mughals using guerrilla strategy also proved inspirational to figures ranging from Shivaji to anti-British revolutionaries in Bengal.\nIn 2007, a statue of Maharana Pratap was unveiled by former President Pratibha Patil in the Parliament of India.\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nFilm and television\n1988–1989: Bharat Ek Khoj, broadcast on Doordarshan, where he was played by Puneet Issar\n2012: Maharana Pratap: The First Freedom Fighter\n2013–2015: Jodha Akbar, broadcast on Zee TV, where he was played by Anurag Sharma\n2013–2015: Bharat Ka Veer Putra – Maharana Pratap, broadcast by Sony Entertainment Television (India), where he was portrayed by Faisal Khan and Sharad Malhotra\n2016: ABP News presented Bharatvarsha, in which episode 8 showcased the story of Maharana Pratap.\n2023: Deepraj Rana as Maharana Pratap in Webseries Taj: Divided by Blood on Zee5\n\n\nSee also\n\nUdaipur State\nDurgadas Rathore\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nSarkar, Jadunath (1960).
