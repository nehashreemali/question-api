  "content": "[In § XXVI. Plutarch points out that Homer calls great and good men \"god-like\" and \"God's compeers,\" but the word Daemon is applied to the good and bad indifferently (see Odyssey, vi. 12; Iliad, xiii. 810, v. 438, iv. 31, &c.). Plato assigns to the Olympian Gods good things and the odd numbers, and the opposite to the Daemons. Xenocrates believed in the existence of a series of strong and powerful beings which take pleasure in scourgings and fastings, &c. Hesiod speaks of \"holy daemons\" (Works and Days, 126) and \"guardians of mankind,\" and \"bestowers of wealth,\" and these are regarded by Plato as a \"middle order of beings between the gods and men, interpreters of the wills of the gods to men, and ministering to their wants, carrying the prayers and supplications of mortals to heaven, and bringing down thence in return oracles and all\n\nother blessings of life.\" Empedocles thought that the Daemons underwent punishment, and that when chastened and purified they were restored to their original state.]",
