She (also) refreshes the heart of N. therewith to life,\n\n1181b. she purifies N., she censes N.\n\n1182a. N. receives his provision from that which is in the granary of the\n Great God;\n\n1182b. N. is clothed with imperishable stars;\n\n1182c. N. presides over the two ’itr.t-palaces,\n\n1182d. he sits at the place of him equipped with the form (of a man).\n\n1183a. Further, to say: O Nwrw,\n ferryman of the marsh of Pȝ‘t,\n\n1183b. N. is the herdsman of thy cattle, who is over thy Birthplace;\n\n1184a. N. is thy potter who is on earth,\n\n1184b. who will break the jar, the child of Nut.\n\n1185a. N. is come; he brought to thee this thy house here which he made for\n thee\n\n1185b. on the night of thy birth, on the day of thy Mś'ḫn.t;\n\n1186a. Thou art Bes who knows not his father; thou knowest not thy mother.\n\n1186b. Let him not announce thee to those who do not know thee that they may\n know thee.\n\n1187a. Ferry him over rapidly\n\n1187b. to the land of smȝ, to\n this field where the gods were be gotten,\n\n1187c. over which the gods rejoice on these their New Year's days.\n\n1188a. Further, to say: O thou who ferriest over the just, who is without a\n boat,\n\n1188b. ferryman of the Marsh of Reeds,\n\n1188c. N. is just before heaven, before the earth;\n\n1188d. N. is just before this isle of the earth,\n\n1188e. to which he has been swimming, and has arrived there,\n\n1188f. and which is between the two thighs of Nut.\n\n1189a. It is N., a pygmy, a dancer of the god,\n\n1189b. who makes glad the heart of the god, before his great throne.\n\n1189c. This is what thou hast heard in the houses,\n\n1189d. and what thou hast learned in the streets,\n\n1189e. that day when N. was summoned to life,\n\n1189f. to hear the sentence.\n\n1190a. Behold, the two who are on the throne of the Great God,\n\n1190b. they summon N. to life and joy for ever,\n\n1190c. they are prosperity and health.\n\n1191a. (So) ferry N. over to the field, the beautiful seat of the Great God,\n\n1191b. where he does the things to be done among the ’imȝḫw.w (venerable\n ones),\n\n1191c. appoints them to food and assigns them to fowling.\n\n1192b. whom he appoints to food and assigns to fowling.\n\n1193a. Further, to say: O ’Iw,\n ferryman of the Marsh of Offerings,\n\n1193b. bring for N. this (boat); N. goes, N. should come,\n\n1194a. the son of the Morning Boat whom she bore before the earth, his happy\n birth,\n\n1194b. whereby the Two Lands live, on the right side of Osiris.\n\n1195a. N. is the annual messenger of Osiris.\n\n1195b. Behold, he is come with a message from thy father Geb:\n\n1195c. \"If the year's yield is welcome, how welcome is the year's yield;\n the year's yield is good, how good is the year's yield!\"\n\n1196a. N. has descended with the Two Enneads in ḳbḥ.w;\n\n1196b. N. is the measuring line of the Two Enneads,\n\n1196c. by which the Marsh of Offerings is established.\n\n1197a. N. found the gods standing,\n\n1197b. wrapped in their garments,\n\n1197c. their white sandals on their feet.\n\n1197d. Then they threw their white sandals on the ground,\n\n1197e. they cast off their garments.\n\n1198a. \"Our heart was not joyful until thou didst descend,\" say\n they;\n\n1198b. \"may that which was said of you be that which you now are.\"\n\n11199a. Stand up, Osiris,\n\n1199b. commend N. to those who are on \"Śḫm is joyous\" north of the Marsh of Offerings,\n\n1199c. like as thou didst commend Horus to Isis\n the day that thou didst impregnate her,\n\n1200a. that they may give food to N. in the fields,\n\n1200b. and that he may drink at the sources\n\n1200c. in the Marsh of Offerings.\n\n1201a. Further, to say: O Ḥr.f-ḥȝ.f,\n doorkeeper of Osiris,\n\n1201b. Osiris has said: \"Let this thy boat be brought for N.,\n\n1201c. in which thy pure ones ferry,\n\n1201d. that thou mayest receive a libation in this eastern (?) quarter of\n the imperishable stars\n\n1202a. that N. may ferry in it\n\n1202b. with that band of green tissue,\n\n1202c. woven, as an eye of Horus,\n\n1202d. to bandage with it that finger of Osiris which became affected.\"\n\n1203a. N. arrives, ššw, ššw.\n\n1203b. The shoals of the great sea protect him.\n\n1203c. The double doors with windows (of heaven) are open; the double doors\n of the lower region are open.\n\n1203d. Ye Two Enneads, take N. with you\n\n1203e. to the Marsh of Offerings, in accordance with the dignity (quality)\n of N., (of the) lord of the ’imȝḫw.w.\n\n1204a. N. strikes with the ‘bȝ-sceptre;\n N. directs with the ’iȝȝ-t-sceptre;\n\n1204b. N. conducts the servants of Rē‘.\n\n1204c. The earth has been refreshed; Geb has been censed\n\n1204d. the Two Enneads have been ndśdś\n (?);\n\n1205a. N. is a ba which passes\n among you, O gods.\n\n1205b. The pȝ‘t-pool (?) has been\n opened up; the pȝ‘t-pool has been filled\n with water;\n\n1205c. the Marsh of Reeds has been inundated;\n\n1205d. the Marsh of Offerings has been filled with water.\n\n1206a. They come to these four long-haired youths,\n\n1206b. who stand on the eastern side of the sky,\n\n1206c. and who prepare the two reed-floats for Rē‘,\n\n1206d. that Rē‘ may go thereby to his horizon.\n\n1206e. They prepare the two reed-floats for N.,\n\n1206f. that N. may go thereby to the horizon, to Rē‘.\n\n1207a. O morning star, Horus of the Dȝ.t,\n the divine falcon, the great green (?),\n\n1207b. children of heaven, greetings to thee in these thy four faces, which\n are satisfied\n\n1207c. when they see those who are in Kns.t,\n\n1207d. who drive away the storm from those who are satisfied.\n\n1208a. Give thou these thy two fingers to N.,\n\n1208b. which-thou gavest to the beautiful one (Nfr.t), daughter of the Great God,\n\n1208c. when the sky was separated from the earth, and when the gods ascended\n to heaven,\n\n1209a. whilst thou was a soul appearing in the bow of thy boat of 770 cubits\n (long),\n\n1209b. which the gods of Buto constructed for thee, which the eastern gods\n shaped for thee.\n\n1210a. N. is son of Khepri, born from the vulva,\n\n1210b. under the curls of ’Iw.ś-‘ȝ.ś,\n north of Heliopolis,\n out of the forehead of Geb.\n\n1211a. N. is he who was between the legs of Mḫnti-’irti,\n\n1211b. that night when be made the bread plain,\n\n1211c. that day when the heads of the mottled serpents were cut off.\n\n1212a. Take thou to thyself thy favourite m‘bȝ-harpoon,\n\n1212b. thy spear which seizes the canals,\n\n1212c. whose two points are the rays of the sun,\n\n1212d. whose two barbs are the claws of Mȝfd.t,\n\n1212e. with which N. cuts off the heads\n\n1212f. of the adversaries, who are in the Marsh of Offerings,\n\n1213a. when he descended to the ocean (great green).\n\n1214b. Bow thy head, decline thine arms (bow in humility), great green.\n\n1213c. The children of Nut are those who descend to thee,\n\n1213d. their garlands on their heads,\n\n1213e. their garlands of leaves on their necks;\n\n1214a. (those) who cause to flourish the crowns (of the North) of the canals\n of the Marsh of Offerings\n\n1214b. for the great Isis, who fastened on the girdle in Chemmis,\n\n1214c. when she brought her garment and burned incense before her son,\n Horus, the young child,\n\n1215a. when he was journeying through the land in his two white sandals,\n\n1215b. and went to see his father, Osiris.\n\n1215c. N. opened his way like fowlers;\n\n1215d. N. exchanged greetings with the lords of kas;\n\n1216a. N. went to the great island in the midst of the Marsh of Offerings,\n\n1216b. on which the gods cause the swallows to alight.\n\n1216c. The swallows are the imperishable stars.\n\n1216d. They give to N. the tree of life whereof they live,\n\n1216e. that N. may, at the same time, live thereof.\n\n1217a. (Morning Star), cause thou N. to ferry over with thee,\n\n1217b. to this thy great field, which thou didst subdue with the aid of the\n gods,\n\n1217c. (where) thou eatest at evening and at dawn, which is full of food.\n\n1218a. N. eats of that which thou eatest;\n\n12 18b. N. drinks of that which thou drinkest.\n\n1218c. Put thou the back of N.\n\n1218d. against the post, against it who is before its sisters.\n\n1219a. Thou (Morning Star) makest N. to sit down because of his truth\n\n1219b. (and) to stand up because of his venerableness.\n\n1219c. N. stands; he has taken (his) venerableness in thy presence,\n\n1219d. like Horus who took the house (heritage) of his father from the\n brother of his father, Set, in the presence of Geb.\n\n1220a. Put thou N. as a prince among the spirits,\n\n1220b. the imperishable stars of the north of the sky,\n\n1220c. who direct the offerings and protect the gifts,\n\n1220d. who cause to come those things (offerings and gifts) for those who\n preside over the kas in heaven.\n\n1221a. Further, to say: O ye four who are in possession of curls,\n\n1221b. your curls are in front of you (or, on your forehead),\n\n1221c. your curls are at your temples,\n\n1221d. your curls are at the back of your head,\n\n1221e. (and that which is) in the middle of your head are braids.\n\n1222a. Bring this boat to N.; bring this boat to N.\n\n1222b. It is Ḥḳrr and\n Sees-behind-him who will ferry N. over,\n\n1222c. (when) N. ferries over to that side where the imperishable stars are,\n\n1222d. that N. may be with them.\n\n1223a. If you do not at once ferry over in the ferry-boat of N.,\n\n1223b. then N. will tell this your name to the people whom he knows,\n\n1223c. to the \"wicked-men\";\n\n1223d. so then N. will pluck out those braids, which are in the middle of\n your head,\n\n1223e. like lotus flowers in-the lotus pond.\n\n1224a. To say: He who journeys over the sea, the messenger; he who journeys\n over the sea, the messenger\n\n1224b. it is a śr-gander, who\n brings himself; it is a sȝt-goose,\n who brings herself;\n\n1224c. it is a ng-bull, who brings\n himself.\n\n1225a. N. flies, as a cloud, like a heron;\n\n1225b. thou fliest low (?) like the father of a ḥ‘ȝ-heron.\n\n1225d. to these his fathers, who are over (chief of) Pdw-š;\n\n1226a. N. brings his bread which cannot mould,\n\n1226b. his beer which cannot sour.\n\n1226c. N. eats this his one bread alone;\n\n1226d. N. gives it not to one at his back;\n\n1226e. he rescues it from the knm.t-bird.\n\n1227a. To say: Sees-behind-him, His-face-behind-him,\n\n1227b. behold thou, N. is come to life.\n\n1227c. He has brought to thee this eye of Horus, bound in the field of\n wrestlers.\n\n1227d, Bring it to N., namely, the \"work of Khnum.\"\n\n1228a. O Ḥpi, ’Imś.ti, Dwȝ-mut.f, Ḳbḥ-śn.w.f,\n\n1228b. bring it to N., namely, the \"work of Khnum,\"\n\n1228c. which is in the Winding Watercourse.\n\n1229a. O devourer, open the way to N.;\n\n1229b. O ḳrr-serpent, open the\n way to N.;\n\n1229c. O Nekhbet, open the way to N.\n\n1230a. Greetings to thee, good one, (come) in peace.\n\n1230b. Love N. as N. loves thee.\n\n1230c. Unwanted (?) art thou, evil one;\n\n1230d. if thou avoidest N., N. will avoid thee.",
