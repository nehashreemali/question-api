The father of N., Atum, lays hold of the arm of N.; he assigns N.\n\n380b. to those gods, who are the nimble, the wise, the imperishable stars.\n\n381a. Mother of N., ’Ipii,\n\n381b. give to N. thy breast,\n\n381c. that N. may pass it over his mouth (taste it),\n\n381d. and that N. may suck thy milk, which is white, light and sweet.\n\n382a.
