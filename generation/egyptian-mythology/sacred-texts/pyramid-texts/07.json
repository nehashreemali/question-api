(thy) mkś-sceptre and thy nḥb.t-sceptre in thy hand, commanding\n those of secret places.\n\n135a. Thine arm is like that of Atum; thy shoulders are like those of Atum;\n thy body is like that of Atum; thy back is like that of Atum;\n\n135b. thy seat is like that of Atum; thy legs are like those of Atum; thy\n face is like that of Anubis.\n\n135c. Thou travelest over the regions of Horus; thou travelest over the\n regions of Set (or, the regions of Horus serve thee; the regions of Set serve\n thee).\n\n136a. O N., beware of the ocean (sea?). To say four times.\n\n136b. The messengers of thy ka are\n come for thee; the messengers of thy father are come for thee; the messengers\n of Rē‘ are come for thee.\n\n137a. Go after (pursue) thy sun (days); purify thyself,\n\n137b. (for) thy bones are (those of) female-falcons, goddesses, who are in\n heaven,\n\n137c. that thou mayest be at the side of the god; that thou mayest leave thy\n house to thy son\n\n137d. who is thine heir. Everyone who speaks, evil against the name of N.,\n\n138a. when he ascends, Geb reckons him as an evil-doer in his own city,\n\n138b. so that he weakens, he falters. Thou purifiest thyself in the dew of\n the stars;\n\n138c. thou descendest on firm (copper?) cables, on the shoulders of Horus in\n his name of \"He who is in the Ḥnw-boat.\"\n\n139a. The blessed dead (?) lament for thee (after) the imperishable stars\n bore thee (away).\n\n139b. Enter the abode of thy father, to the abode of Geb,\n\n139c. that he may give to thee that which is on the brow of Horus, that thou\n mayest be a ba thereby, that thou\n mayest be a śḫm thereby,\n\n139d. that thou mayest be a Ḫnti-’imntiw\n thereby.\n\n140b. let thy messengers go; let thine envoys hasten to thy father, to Atum.\n\n140c. Atum, let him ascend to thee; enfold him in thine embrace,\n\n141a. (for) there is no god, (who has become) a star, who has not his\n companion. Shall I be thy companion?\n\n146. Look (at me); thou hast regarded the form of the children of their\n fathers,\n\n141c. who know their speech. (They are now) imperishable stars.\n\n141d. (So) shalt thou see those who are in the palace, (that is) Horus and\n Set.\n\n142a. Mayest thou spit in the face of Horus; mayest thou drive away the\n injury from him.\n\n142b. Mayest thou catch the testicles of Set; mayest thou drive away his\n mutilation.\n\n142c. That one was born to thee; this one was conceived by thee.\n\n143a. Thou art born, O Horus, as one whose name is \"Him at whom the\n earth quakes.\" [Thou art conceived, O Set, as one whose name is] \"Him\n at whom heaven trembles.\"\n\n143b. That one (Horus) has not a mutilation; this one (Set) has not an\n injury; this one (Set) has not an injury; that one (Horus) has not a\n mutilation.\n\n144a. Thou art born, Horus, of Osiris; thou art more ba than he, thou art more śḫm\n than he.\n\n144b. Thou art conceived, Set by Geb; thou art more ba than he, thou art more śḫm\n than he.\n\n145a. No seed of a god, which belongs to him, goes to ruin; so thou who\n belongest to him wilt not go to ruin.\n\n145b. Rē‘-Atum does not surrender thee to Osiris. He judges (lit. numbers)\n not thy heart; he gains not power over thy heart.\n\n145c. Rē‘-Atum does not surrender thee to Horus. He judges (lit. numbers)\n not thy heart; he gains not power over thy heart.\n\n146a. Osiris, thou dost not gain power over him (Set); thy son gains not\n power over him.\n\n146b. Horus, thou dost not gain power over him (Set); thy father gains not\n power over him.\n\n147a. Thou belongest, O mn, to\n that god, of whom the twin-children of Atum said (to him):\n\n147b. \"Arise,\" said they, \"in thy name of god\"--and so\n thou becomest an Atum to (of) every god:\n\n148a. Thy head is (that of) Horus of the Dȝ.t,\n O Imperishable.\n\n148b. Thy face is that of Mḫnti-’irti,\n O Imperishable.\n\n148c. Thine ears are the twin-children of Atum, O Imperishable. Thine eyes\n are the twin-children of Atum, O Imperishable.\n\n148d. Thy nose is (that of) Anubis, O Imperishable. Thy teeth are (those of)\n Sopdu, O Imperishable.\n\n149a. Thine arms are Hp and Dwȝ-mw.t.f, which thou needest to\n ascend to heaven, when thou ascendest;\n\n149b. thy legs are ’Imś.ti and Ḳbḥ-śn.w.f, which thou needest to\n descend to the lower heaven (underworld) when thou descendest.\n\n149c. Thy (other) members are the twin-children of Atum, O Imperishable.\n\n149d. Thou perishest not, thy ka\n perishes not, (for) thou art a ka.\n\n150a. To say: I had come to thee Nephthys; I am come to thee Boat of the\n Evening (mśkt.t-boat);\n\n150b. I am come to thee Mȝ‘-ḥri-tr.wt;\n\n150c. I am come to thee Mśḫȝ.t-kȝ.w;\n remember him--N.\n\n151a. Śȝḥ is enveloped by the Dȝ.t, pure and living, in the horizon;\n\n151b. So this is enveloped by the Dȝ.t,\n pure and living, in the horizon;\n\n151c. N. is enveloped by the Dȝ.t,\n pure and living, in the horizon.\n\n151d. He is content because of them; he is cool because of them,\n\n151e. in the arms of his father, in the arms of Atum.\n\n152a.
