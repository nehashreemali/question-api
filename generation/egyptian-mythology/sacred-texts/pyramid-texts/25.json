N. was born in Nun,\n\n1040b. when the sky had not yet come into being, when the earth had not yet\n come into being,\n\n1040c. when the two supports (of the sky) had not yet come into being, when\n unrest had not yet come into being,\n\n1040d. when fear had not yet come into being, which came into being on\n account of the eye of Horus.\n\n1041a. N. is one of that great corporation who was born before (all others)\n in Heliopolis,\n\n1041b. who will not be taken away for (on account of?) a king\n\n1041c. who (lit. they) will (not) be confiscated for (on account of?) high\n officials,\n\n1041d. who will not be executed, who will not be pronounced guilty.\n\n1042a.
