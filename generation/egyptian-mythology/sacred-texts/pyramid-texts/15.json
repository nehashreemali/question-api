Say ye to your father (Ptaḥ)\n\n448b. that N. has given to you your established-offering, that N. has\n satisfied you with your due.\n\n448c. Ye shall (or, should) not hinder N. when he ferries to the horizon to\n him.\n\n449a. N. knows him, knows his name. Nḥi\n is, his name, Nḥi lord of the year\n is his name;\n\n449b. he with the warrior's arm, Horus who is over the śhd.w of heaven, who causes Rē‘ to live every day.\n\n450a. He will rebuild N.; he will cause N. to live every day.\n\n450b. N. comes to thee, Horus of Hȝ.t;\n N. comes to thee, Horus of Šsm.t;\n\n450c. N. comes to thee, Horus of the East.\n\n451a. Behold, N. brings to thee thy great left eye as healer.\n\n451b. Take it, the intact (one), to thyself from N.; its water is in it,\n being intact;\n\n451c. its blood is in it, being intact; its breath is in it, being intact.\n\n452a. Enter into it; take possession of it, in this thy name of \"Sacred\n Ḥḳ3ś\" (a god),\n\n452b. that thou mayest approach to it in this thy name of \"Rē‘\"'.\n\n453a. Put it on thy brow, in this, its name of \"choice oil\",\n\n453b. that thou mayest rejoice in it, in this its name of\n \"willow-tree\",\n\n454a. that thou mayest sparkle thereby among the gods, in this its name of\n \"that which sparkles\", (or, \"tḥnw.t-oil\"),\n\n454b. that thou mayest be pleased with it in this its name of \"oil of\n pleasure\", (or, \"ḥkn.w-oil\").\n\n454c. (Then) will the Rnn-wt.t-serpent\n love thee.\n\n455a. Stand there, great reed-float, like Wp-wȝ.wt,\n\n455b. filled with thy splendour, come forth from the horizon,\n\n455c. after thou hast taken possession of the white crown in the\n water-springs, great and mighty, which are in the south of Libya,\n\n456a. (like) Sebek, lord of Bȝh.w.\n\n456b. Thou journeyest to thy fields, thou passest through thy kśb.t-woods,\n\n456c. thy nose breathes the fragrance of the Šsmt.t-land.\n\n456d. Thou causest the ka of N. to\n approach his side,\n\n456e. like as thy Wig (deified) approaches thee.\n\n457a. Purify N., make N. bright\n\n457b. in this thy jackal-lake, O jackal, where thou purifiest the gods.\n\n457c. Thou art become a soul, thou art become pre-eminent (sharp), (like.)\n Horus lord of the green-stone--(to say) four times--(like) the two green\n falcons.\n\n458a. To say: Heaven is serene (?); Sothis lives, for it is N. who lives,\n the son of Sothis.\n\n458b. The Two Enneads have purified themselves for him\n\n458c. as (in the form of) the mśḫtiw-hook-star,\n the imperishable.\n\n458d. The house of N. in heaven will not go under, the throne of N. on earth\n will never be destroyed.\n\n459a. Men bury themselves (in their grave (?); the gods fly up.\n\n449b. Sothis caused N. to fly to heaven among his brothers the gods.\n\n449c. Nut, the great, uncovered her arms for N.\n\n460a. The two souls who are at the head of the souls of Heliopolis, who genuflected at sun-rise,\n\n460b. passed the night, while they did this, weeping for the god.\n\n460c. The throne of N. is by thee, O Rē‘; he will not give it to anyone\n else.\n\n461a. N. ascends to heaven, to thee, O Rē‘;\n\n461b. the face of N. is as (that of) falcons;\n\n461c. the wings of N. are as (those of) geese;\n\n461d. his claws are as the fangs of the god of the Dw.f-nome.\n\n462a. There is not a word among men on earth against N.;\n\n462b. there is no condemnation of him among the gods in heaven.\n\n462c. N. has removed the word against him; N. has destroyed (it) so as to\n mount up to heaven.\n\n463a. Wp-wȝ.wt has caused N. to\n fly to heaven among his brothers, the gods.\n\n463b. N. moved (flapped) his arms like a śmn-goose;\n\n463c. N. flaps his wings like a kite.\n\n463d. He flies who flies, O men; N. also flies away from you.\n\n464a. To say: Gods of the West, gods of the East, gods of the South, gods of\n the North--\n\n464b. these four pure reed-floats, which ye placed for Osiris,\n\n464c. for his ascension to heaven,\n\n465a. that he might ferry over to ḳbḥ.w,\n while his son Horus was at hand (at his fingers),\n\n465b. (whom) he reared and whom he caused to dawn as a great god in ḳbḥ.w,\n\n465c. place them for N.\n\n466a. Art thou Horus, son of Osiris? Art thou, O N., the god, the eldest,\n son of Hathor?\n\n466b. Art thou the seed of Geb?\n\n467a. Osiris has ordained that N. dawn as a second Horus.\n\n467b. Those four souls (spirits), who are in Heliopolis, have written it\n\n467c. in the register of the two Great Gods who are in ḳbḥ.w.\n\n468a.

To say: The ladder is fastened by Rē‘ in the presence of Osiris;\n\n472b. the ladder is fastened by Horus in the presence of his father Osiris,\n\n472c. as he goes to his ȝḫ\n (spirit).\n\n472d. One of them is on this side, one of them is on this side, while N. is\n between them.\n\n473a. Art thou then a god, pure in dwellings (places)? (I am) come from a pure\n (place).\n\n473b. Stand (here), O N., says Horus; sit (here), O N., says Set;\n\n473c. Take his arm (certificate), says Rē‘.\n\n474a. The spirit belongs to heaven; the body belongs to the earth.\n\n474b. That which men receive when they are buried\n\n474c. are their thousand loaves of bread, their thousand mugs of beer from\n the offering-table of Ḫnti-’imnti.w.\n\n475a. If the heir is poor because he has no testament,\n\n475b. then shall N. (really, \"he\") write with his great finger;\n\n475c. but he shall not write with his little finger,\n\n476a. To say: \"How beautiful indeed is the sight, how pleasant indeed\n is the view,\" say they, say the gods,\n\n476b. \"'the ascension of this god to heaven, the ascension of N. to\n heaven,\n\n477a. his renown over him, his terror on both sides of him,\n\n477b. his magic preceding him!\"\n\n477c. Geb has done for him as was done for himself; (and)\n\n478a. the gods, the Souls of Buto come to him, (and) the gods, the Souls of\n Hierakonpolis, the gods who are in heaven, the gods who are on the earth;\n\n478b. they make for thee (they serve thee as), N., supports of their arms,\n\n479a. and thou ascendest, N., to heaven, and thou climbest on it in this its\n name of \"ladder.\"\n\n479b. \"Let heaven be given to N.; let the earth be given to him,\"\n said Atum.\n\n480a. He who had spoken (with Atum) about it was Geb.\n\n480b. The regions of the kingdom, the kingdom\n of Horus, the kingdom\n  of Set, (and)\n\n480c. the Marshes of Reeds, they adore thee\n\n480d. in this thy name of Dwȝ.m,\n as Sopdu, (who lives) under his kśb.t-trees.\n\n481a. Has he killed thee after his heart had said that thou shouldst die for\n him?\n\n481b. But, behold, thou for thy part become in spite of him as the remaining\n bull of the wild-bulls.\n\n481c.

N. has looked to you, as Set looked to the two harmonius (goddesses).\n\n490a. To say: N. is the dḥȝ.i\n of the gods, who is behind the house of Rē‘,\n\n490b. born of the wish of the gods, which is in the prow of the boat of\n Rē‘.\n\n490c. N. sits before him;\n\n491a. N. opens his boxes; N. breaks open his edicts;\n\n491b. N. seals his rolls (of papyrus);\n\n491c. N. sends forth his messengers, the indefatigables.\n\n491d. N. does, that which he (Rē‘) says to N.\n\n492a. To say: If N. should be bewitched, so will Atum be bewitched.\n\n492b. If N. should be slandered, so will Atum be slandered.\n\n492c.

N. comes after his father (in time); N. comes after\n Osiris.\n\n493b. O thou, whose face is before him, whose face is behind him,\n\n494a. bring this (boat) to N. Which boat shall I bring to thee, O N.?\n\n494b. Bring to N. that which flies up and alights.\n\n495a. To say: Look at N., O Rē‘; recognize N., O Rē‘.\n\n495b. He belongs to those who know thee. He knows (that)\n\n495c. when his lord (Rē‘) goes forth, he should not forget the ḥtp-di,\n\n496a. so that she \"who excludes whom she will exclude\" may open\n the doors of the horizon for the going forth of the boat of the morning-sun.\n\n496b. (N.) knows the hall of the royal throne, which is in the midst of the\n platform of ’iskn, whence thou goest\n forth,\n\n497a. that thou mayest enter (step down into) the boat of the evening-sun.\n\n497b. Commend N.; commend him, commend him--to say four times one after\n another--to those four raging ones (winds),\n\n497c. who are around thee (Rē‘) who see with two faces, who speak with two\n mouths (?),\n\n498a. who are evil with those who are unfortunate, with those who would\n destroy them (the winds?),\n\n498b. that they put not out their arm, when N. turns to thee, when N. comes\n to thee,\n\n499a. as one who says to thee this thy name of \"great flood,\"\n which proceeds from the great (one).\n\n499b. N. will not be blind when thou leavest him in darkness;\n\n499c. he will not be deaf when he does not hear thy voice.\n\n500a. Mayest thou take N. with thee, with thee;\n\n500b. he who drives away the storm for thee; be who chases off the clouds\n for thee; he who breaks up the hail for thee.\n\n500c, N. will do homage (upon) homage to thee; he will cause acclamation\n (upon) acclamation to thee.\n\n500d.
