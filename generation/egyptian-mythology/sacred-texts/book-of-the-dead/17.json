  "content": "Vignettes: The funereal procession to the tomb; running the length of the two plates. In the centre of Plate V. the mummy of the dead man is seen lying in a chest or shrine mounted on a boat with runners, which is drawn by oxen. In the boat, at the head and foot of the mummy, are two small models of Nephthys and Isis. By the side kneels Ani's wife Thuthu, lamenting. In front of the boat is the Sem priest burning incense in a censer,[3] and pouring out a libation from a vase; he wears his characteristic dress, a panther's skin. Eight mourners follow. one of whom has his hair whitened. In the rear a sepulchral ark or chest[4] surmounted. by a figure of Anubis and ornamented with emblems of \"protection\" and \"stability,\" is drawn on a sledge by four attendants, and is followed by two others. By their side walk other attendants carrying Ani's palette, boxes, chair, couch, staff, etc.\n\nIn Plate VI. the procession is continued up to the tomb. In the centre is a\n\n[1. \"Thou goest forth over heaven in three-fold peace [in] thy sektet boat; when thou showest thy face . . . . . . . thee.\"\n\n2. \"He giveth to thee thine eyes to see therewith, and thine cars [to hear therewith].\"\n\n3. For a bronze censer similar in shape, see No. 5296 a, Fourth Egyptian Room.\n\n4. It is similar in shape to the chests which held the four jars containing the mummied intestines of the deceased. For examples of them see Nos. 8543a, 8543b in the Third Egyptian Room.]\n\ngroup of wailing women, followed by attendants carrying on yokes boxes of flowers, vases of unguents, etc. In the right centre are a cow with her calf, chairs of painted wood with flowers upon them, and an attendant with shaven head, carrying a haunch, newly cut, for the funereal feast. The group on the right is performing the last rites. Before the door of the tomb stands the mummy of Ani to receive the final honours; behind him, embracing him, stands Anubis, the god of the tomb; and at his feet, in front, kneels Thuthu to take a last farewell of her husband's body. Before a table of offerings stand two priests: the Sem priest, who wears a panther's skin, holding in his right hand a libation vase, and in his left a censer; and a priest holding in his right hand an instrument[1] with which he is about to touch the mouth and eyes of the mummy, and in his left the instrument for \"opening the mouth.\"[2] Behind or beside them on the ground, in a row, lie the instruments employed in the ceremony of \"opening the mouth,\"[2] etc., the mesxet instrument, the sepulchral box, the boxes of purification, the bandlet, the libation vases, the ostrich feather and the instruments called Seb-ur, Temanu or Tun-tet, and the Pesh-en-kef. The Kher-heb priest stands behind reading the service of the dead from a papyrus.\n\nAppendix: In the papyrus of Hunefer a slab or stele with rounded top is placed by the door of the tomb (Fig. 1, p. 265). In the upper part of it the deceased is shown adoring Osiris, and below is the legend,[3] \"Hail, Osiris, the chief of Amenta, the lord of eternity,\n\n[1. This instrument is called ### ur hekau, and is made of a sinuous piece of wood, one end of which is in the form of a ram's head surmounted by a uræus (Fig. 1).\n\n2. In the Neb-seni papyrus the \"Guardian of the Scale\" opens the mouth of the deceased (Fig. 2).\n\nspreading out in everlastingness, lord of adorations, chief of the company of his gods; and hail, Anubis [dweller] in the tomb, great god, chief of the holy dwelling. May they grant that I may go into and come out from the underworld, that I may follow Osiris in all his festivals at the beginning of the year, that I may receive cakes, and that I may go forth into the presence of [Osiris]; I, the double (ka) of Osiris, the greatly favoured of his god, Hu-nefer.\" In the upper register of this section of the papyrus is the text of the \"Chapter of opening the mouth of the statue of Osiris.\" The complete scene, including this stele and vignette, appears in the tomb of Pe-ta-Amen-Apt. In the vignette of the first chapter of the Book of the Dead in the papyrus of Neb-qet[1] the soul of the deceased is represented descending the steps of the tomb to carry food to its mummy in the underground chamber (Fig. 2).\n\nThe ceremonies[2] which took place at the door of the tomb in an Egyptian funeral are of considerable interest. The priest called Kher-heb, holding the Sem priest by the arm, gives directions for the slaughter of \"a bull of the South.\" The slaughterer, standing on the bull, cuts off a fore-leg (Fig. 3) and takes out the heart. A woman, called the Tcherauur, who personifies Isis, then whispers in the deceased's ear, \"Behold, thy lips are set in order for thee, so that thy mouth may be opened.\" Next, an antelope[3] and a duck[4]\n\n[1. Devéria and Pierret, Papyrus Funéraire de Neb-set, plate 3.\n\n2. The following description of them is based upon the chapters on this subject in Dümichen, Der Grabpalast des Patuamenap, Abth. ii I, plates x ff., pp. 3 ff.\n\nare brought by order of the Kher-heb, and their heads are cut off.[1] The Kher-heb then addresses the Sem priest: \"I have seized them for thee, I have brought unto thee thine enemies. His hands bring his head [as] his gift. I have slain them for thee, O Tmu; let not his enemies rise up against this god.\" The slaughterer then presents the thigh to the Kher-heb, and the heart to an official whose title was Smer, and all three then \"place the thigh and the heart upon the ground before this god\" (i.e., Osiris). The Kher-heb then says to the deceased, represented by his mummy or statue: I have brought unto thee the thigh (Fig. 4) as the Eye of Horus. I have brought unto thee the heart; let there be no rising up against this god. I have\n\nbrought unto thee the antelope, his head is cut off; I have brought unto thee the duck, his head is cut off.\" Here the sacrifice ends.\n\nThe next part of the ceremony, i.e., \"the opening of the mouth and eyes,\" is performed by the Sem priest, who addresses the deceased: \"I have come to embrace thee, I am thy son Horus, I have pressed thy mouth; I am thy son, I love thee. His mother beats her breast and weeps for him, and those who are in chains with him (i.e., Isis and Nephthys) beat their breasts. Thy mouth was closed, but I have set in order for\n\n[1. The slaughter of the antelope and duck typified the destruction of the enemies of the deceased; for, when Horus destroyed the enemies of his father Osiris, \"he cut off their heads [which took] the form of ducks in the sky, making them to fall headlong to the ground in the form of antelopes, and into the water in the form of fishes,\" For the text, see Schiaparelli,. Il Libro dei Funerali degli Antichi Egiziani (in Atti della R. Accademia dei Lincei; Rome, 1883 and 1890), p. 94; Naville, Todtenbuch, chap. 134.]\n\n\"thee thy mouth[1] and thy teeth.\" The Kher-heb next calls on the Sem priest four times: \"O Sem, take the Seb-ur[2] (Fig. 5) and open the mouth and the eyes\"; and while the Sem priest is performing the ceremony the Kher-heb continues: \"Thy mouth was closed, but I have set in order for thee thy mouth and thy teeth. I open for thee thy mouth, I open for thee thy two eyes. I have opened for thee thy mouth with the instrument of Anubis. I have opened thy mouth with the instrument of Anubis, with the iron tool with which the mouths of the gods were opened. Horus, open the mouth, Horus, open the mouth. Horus hath opened the mouth of the dead, as he whilom opened the mouth of Osiris, with the iron which came forth from Set, with the iron tool (Fig. 6) with which he opened the mouths of the gods. He hath opened thy mouth with it. The dead shall walk and shall speak, and his body shall [be] with the great company of the gods in the Great House of the Aged one in Annu, and he shall receive there the ureret crown from Horus, the lord of mankind.\" The Kher-heb next says: \"Let the Ami-Khent priest (Fig. 7) stand behind him (i.e., the deceased), and say, 'My father, my father,' four times.\" The eldest son of the deceased then stands behind the deceased, and in his\n\nname the Kher-heb says: \"His mother beateth her breast and weepeth for him, and those who are in chains with him also beat their breasts.\" Another priest, called Am-Khent-Heru, takes up the same position and says: \"Isis goeth unto Horus, who embraceth his father.\" A priestly official belonging to the mesenti class then goes behind the deceased, and the Sem, Smer and Kher-heb priests stand in front, and the Sem priest and the Kher-heb, personifying Horus and Sut, respectively cry: \"I am Horus, I am Sut; I will not let thee illumine the head of my father.\" The Sem priest then leaves the Ka-chapel and returns, leading in the Se-mer-f, i.e., \"the son who loveth him\"; whereupon the Kher-heb says: \"O Sem, let the Se-mer-f come into the tomb in order that he may see the god.\" The Sem priest holding him by the arm then leads forward the Se-mer-f, who addresses the deceased: \"I have come, I have brought\n\n[1. See Schiaparelli, Il Libro dei Funerali degli Antichi Egiziani; Maspero, Le Rituel du Sacrifice Funéraire (in Revue de L'Histoire des Religions, 1887, p. 159 ff.).\n\n2. ###. For a complete list of these instruments, see Schiaparelli, Il Libro dei Funerali degli Antichi Egiziani, p.109.]\n\nunto thee thy son who loveth thee; he shall open for thee thy mouth and thine eyes.\" (Fig. 8). A tomb-official, Am-as, then takes up his position behind the deceased, and the Se-mer-f and the Kher-heb stand in front; the Kher-heb repeating four times: \"The Se-mer-f openeth the mouth and the two eyes of the deceased, first with a needle of iron, then with a rod of smu metal\"; the Am-as addressing the deceased: \"Behold the Se-mer-f\"; and the Kher-heb saying, in the name of the Se-mer-f: \"I have pressed for thee thy mouth, even as thy father pressed it in the name of Seker. Hail, Horus hath pressed thy mouth for thee, he hath opened thine eyes for thee; Horus hath opened thy mouth for thee, he hath opened for thee thine eyes; they are firmly stablished. Thy mouth was closed; I have ordered thy mouth and thy teeth for thee in their true order. Thou hast [again] opened thy mouth; Horus hath opened thy mouth. I have stablished thy mouth firmly. Horus hath opened for thee thy mouth, Horus hath opened for thee thy two eyes.\" The Kher-heb then speaks on behalf of the Sem priest: \"Thy mouth was closed up. I have ordered aright for thee thy mouth and thy teeth. Thy mouth is firmly stablished. Thy mouth was tightly closed. His mouth is firmly stablished, and [his] two eyes are firmly stablished.\" The Sem priest next presents to the deceased (Fig. 9) a cone-shaped offering,[2] and at the same time the Kher-heb says: \"Open the mouth and the two eyes, open the mouth and the two eyes. Thou hadst tightly closed thy mouth, thou hast [again] opened thy two eyes.\" Then the Kher-heb says, on behalf of the Smer (Fig. 10) priest who stands behind the deceased:\n\n\"One cometh unto thee for thy purification.\" Next the Se-mer-f comes forward with four boxes (Fig. 11) in his hands, and the Kher-heb says: \"O se-mer-f, take the four boxes of purification, press the mouth and the two eyes, and open the mouth and the two eyes with each of them four times, and say, 'Thy mouth and thy two eyes are firmly stablished, and they are restored aright,' and say also, 'I have firmly pressed thy mouth, I have opened thy mouth, I have opened thy two eyes by means of the four boxes of purification.\"' The Sem priest then approaches\n\n2. A large collection of such offerings is exhibited in the Third Egyptian Room.]\n\nthe deceased (Fig. 12) with the instrument ###[1], and the Kher-heb at the same time says: \"O Sem priest, lay the pesh-en-kef upon his mouth, and say, 'I have stablished for thee thy two jaw-bones in thy face which was divided into two parts.'\" The Sem priest next makes an offering of grapes (Fig. 13), the Kher-heb saying: \"O Sem priest, place the grapes upon his mouth and say, 'He bringeth to thee the eye of Horus, he graspeth it; do thou also grasp it.'\" After an ostrich feather has been offered (Fig. 14) by the Sem priest, and a number of the ceremonies described above have been repeated, and other animals slaughtered, the Kher-heb addresses the Sem priest, and says: \"Take the instrument Tun-tet[2] (thrice) and open the mouth and the eyes\" (four times). He then continues: \"O Sem priest, take the iron instrument of Anubis, Tun-tet (thrice). Open the mouth and the two eyes (four times), and say, 'I open for thee thy mouth with the iron instrument of Anubis with which he opened the mouths of the gods. Horus openeth the mouth, Horus openeth the mouth,\n\nHorus openeth the mouth with the iron which cometh forth from Set, wherewith he hath opened the mouth of Osiris. With the iron tool (meskhet) wherewith he opened the mouths of the gods doth he open the mouth. He [the deceased] shall go in and he shall speak [again], and his body shall dwell with the company of the great gods in Annu, wherein he hath received the ureret crown from Horus, lord of men. Hail, Horus openeth thy mouth and thy two eyes with the instrument Seb-ur or Teman,[3] with the instrument Tun-tet of the Opener of the Roads (i.e., Anubis) wherewith he opened the mouth of all the gods of the North. Horus the Great[4] cometh to embrace thee. I, thy son who loveth thee, have opened thy mouth and thy two eyes. His mother beateth her breast in grief while she embraceth him, and the two sisters (i.e., Isis and Nephthys), who are one, strike themselves in grief. All the gods open thy mouth according to the book of the service.\"' The Kher-heb next instructs the Sem priest to clothe the mummy or statue of the deceased with the nemes\n\n[1. It is called Pesh-en-kef. See Dümichen, Der Grabpalast des Patuamenap, Abth. I, pp. 18, 19.\n\n4 Heru-ur, the Heroeris of the Greeks.]\n\nband or fillet (Fig. 15), and to say: \"Lo! the nemes fillet, the nemes fillet, which cometh as the light, which cometh as the light; it cometh as the eye of Horus, the brilliant; it cometh forth from Nekheb. The gods were bound therewith; bound round is thy face with it in its name of Hetch (i.e., light, or brilliance), coming forth from Nekheb. \"All that could do harm to thee upon earth is destroyed.\" The Sem priest, holding a vase of ointment in his left hand, and smearing the mouth with his fore-finger (Fig. 16), says: \"I have anointed thy face with ointment, I have anointed thine eyes. I have painted thine eye with uatch and with mestchem. May no ill-luck happen through the dethronement of his two eyes in his body, even as no evil fortune came to Horus through the overthrow of his eye in his body. Thy two eyes are decked therewith in its name of Uatch, which maketh thee to give forth fragrance, in its name of \"Sweet-smelling.\" A number of scented unguents and perfumes are brought forward, and at the presentation of each a short sentence is recited by the Kher-heb having reference to the final triumph of the deceased in the underworld and to the help which the great gods will render to him.\n\nText: [Chapter I.][2] (1) HERE BEGIN THE CHAPTERS OF COMING FORTH BY DAY,[3] AND OF THE SONGS OF PRAISE[4] AND (2) GLORIFYING,[4] AND OF COMING FORTH FROM AND GOING INTO THE GLORIOUS NETER-KHERT IN THE BEAUTIFUL\n\n2 The text accompanying Plates 5 and 6 represents Chapter I., Chapter XXII., and the Rubric of Chapter LXXII., of Lepsius's numeration.\n\n3.

Osiris Ani, (4) Osiris, the scribe Ani, saith: \"Homage to thee, O bull of Amenta, Thoth the (5) king of eternity is with me. I am the great god in[1] the boat of the Sun; I have (6) fought for thee.

In the vignettes which accompany it, the deceased is represented as adoring three gods, who are either standing in a shrine or are seated upon it. In other instances, the deceased stands by a sepulchral chest or outside a pylon with hands raised in adoration. The following is a translation of the Louvre text:--\n\n(1) CHAPTER OF COMING FORTH BY DAY AND OF PASSING THROUGH THE AMMAHET. (2) \"Homage to you, O ye lords of kas, ye lords of right and truth, infallible, who shall endure for ever and shall exist through countless ages, grant that (3) 1 may enter into your [presence]. I, even I, am pure and holy, and I have gotten power over the spells which are mine. judgment (4) hath been passed\n\n[1. A variant gives the reading ### (Naville, Todtenbuch, Bd. IL, Bl. 84). For the situation of the pool, see Brugsch, Dict. Géog, p. 359.\n\n2 The following lines of text form the XXIst chapter of the Saïte recension of the Book of the Dead. See Lepsius, Todtenbuch, plate xiv.; and Pierret, Le Livre des Morts, p. 91.\n\n4 The chapter which Lepsius has numbered XXIII., as being most closely connected with the XXIInd chapter, and which refers to the opening of the mouth of the deceased, follows on Plate XV.]\n\nupon me in my glorified form. Deliver ye me from the crocodile which is in the place of the lords of right and truth. Grant ye unto me (5) my mouth that I may speak therewith. May offerings be made unto me in your presence, for I know you and I know your names, and I know (6) the name of the great god. Grant ye abundance of food for his nostrils. The god Rekem passeth through the western horizon of heaven. He (7) travelleth on, and I travel on he goeth forth, and I go forth. Let me not be destroyed in the place Mesqet let not the Fiend get the mastery over me; let me not be driven back from your gates; (8) let not your doors be shut against me; for I have [eaten] bread in Pe and I have drunken ale in Tepu. If my arms be fettered in the (9) holy habitation, may my father Tmu stablish for me my mansion in the place above [this] earth where there are wheat and barley in abundance which cannot be told. May feasts be made for me there, for my soul and for my (10) body. Grant me even offerings of the dead, bread, and ale, and wine, oxen, and ducks, linen bandages and incense, wax, and all the good and fair and pure things whereby the gods do live. May I rise again in all the forms which (11) I desire without fail and for ever. May I sail up and down through the fields of Aaru; may I come thither in peace; for I am the double Lion-god.\"",
