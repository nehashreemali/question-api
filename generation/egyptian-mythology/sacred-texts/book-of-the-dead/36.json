  "content": "Vignettes: The Hall of Double Right and Truth, wherein Ani has to address severally the forty-two gods, who are seated in a row in the middle of the, hall. At each end is a door that on the right is called \"Neb-Maat-heri-tep-retui-f\" and that on the left \"Neb-pehti-thesu-menment.\" On the centre of the roof, which is crowned with\n\na series of uræi and feathers emblematic of Maat, is a seated deity with hands extended, the right over the eye of Horus and the left over a pool (see the Vignette of Plate VIII. above, p. 278).[1] On the right, at the end of the hall (Plate XXXII.), are four small vignettes, in which are depicted: (1) Two seated figures of the goddess Maat, with emblematic of Right and Truth, on the head, and sceptres and emblems of life in the right and left hands. (2) Osiris, seated, wearing the atef crown, and holding in his hands the crook and flail. Before him, by the side of an altar of offerings, stands Ani, with both hands raised in adoration. (3) A balance with the heart, symbolizing the conscience of Ani, in one scale, and emblematic of Right and Truth, in the other. Beside the balance is the tri-formed monster Amemit. (4) Thoth, ibis-headed, seated on a pylon-shaped pedestal, painting a large feather of Maat.\n\nText: [THE NEGATIVE CONFESSION.]\n\n(1) Ani saith: \"Hail, thou whose strides are long, who comest forth from Annu, I have not done iniquity.\"\n\n(2) \"Hail, thou who art embraced by flame, who comest forth from Kheraba, I have not robbed with violence.\"\n\n(3) \"Hail, Fentiu, who comest forth from Khemennu, I have not stolen.\"\n\n(4) \"Hail, Devourer of the Shade, who comest forth from Qernet, I have done no murder; I have done no harm.\"\n\n(5) \"Hail, Nehau, who comest forth from Re-stau, I have not defrauded offerings.\"\n\n(6) \"Hail, god in the form of two lions, who comest forth from heaven, I have not minished oblations.\"\n\n(7) \"Hail, thou whose eyes are of fire, who comest forth from Saut, I have not plundered the god.\"\n\n(8) \"Hail, thou Flame, which comest and goest, I have spoken no lies.\"\n\n(9) \"Hail, Crusher of bones, who comest forth from Suten-henen, I have not snatched away food.\"\n\n(10) \"Hail, thou who shootest forth the Flame, who comest forth from Het-Ptah-ka, I have not caused pain.\"\n\n[1. In the Nebseni Papyrus a dog-headed ape and a balance are represented on each side of the seated deity, and at each end of the roof; and each uræus wears a disk and horns.]\n\n(11) \"Hall, Qerer, who comest forth from Amentet, I have not committed fornication.\"\n\n(12) \"Hail, thou whose face is turned back, who comest forth from thy hiding place, I have not caused shedding of tears.\"\n\n(13) \"Hail, Bast, who comest forth from the secret place, I have not dealt deceitfully.\"\n\n(14) \"Hail, thou whose legs are of fire, who comest forth out of the darkness, I have not transgressed.\"\n\n(15) \"Hail, Devourer of Blood, who comest forth from the block of slaughter, I have not acted guilefully.\"\n\n(16) \"Hail, Devourer of the inward parts, who comest forth from Mabet, I have not laid waste the ploughed land.\"\n\n(17) \"Hail, Lord of Right and Truth, who comest forth from the city of Right and Truth, I have not been an eavesdropper.\"\n\n(18) \"Hail, thou who dost stride backwards, who comest forth from the city of Bast, I have not set my lips in motion [against any man].\"\n\n(19) \"Hail, Sertiu, who comest forth from Annu, I have not been angry and wrathful except for a just cause.\"\n\n(20) \"Hail, thou. being of two-fold wickedness, who comest forth from Ati (?)
