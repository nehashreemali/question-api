  "content": "The papyrus of Ani, was found at Thebes, and was purchased by the Trustees of the British Museum in 1888. It measures 78 feet by 1 foot 3 inches, and is the longest known papyrus of the Theban period.[1] It is made up of six distinct lengths of papyrus, which vary in length from 26 feet 9 inches to 5 feet 7 inches. The material is composed of three layers of papyrus supplied by plants which measured in the stalks about 41 inches in diameter. The several lengths have been joined together with great neatness, and the repairs and insertion of new pieces (see plates 25, 26) have been dexterously made. When first found, the papyrus was of a light colour, similar to that of the papyrus of Hunefer (B. M. No. 9901), but it became darker after it had been unrolled, and certain sections of it have shrunk somewhat.\n\nIt contains a number of chapters of the Book of the Dead, nearly all of which are accompanied by vignettes; and at top and bottom is a border of two colours-red and yellow.[2] At the beginning and end of the papyrus spaces of six and eleven inches respectively have been left blank. The inscribed portion is complete, and the loss of the few characters which were damaged in unrolling[3] does not interrupt the text. It was written by three or more scribes; but the uniformity of the execution of the vignettes suggests that fewer artists were employed on the illustrations. The titles of the chapters, rubrics, catchwords, etc., are in red. In some instances the artist has occupied so much space that the\n\n[1 The papyrus of Nebseni, of the XVIIIth dynasty (B.M., No. 9900), measures 76 feet 81 inches by 13 inches; and the papyrus of Hunefer, of the XIXth dynasty (B.M., No. 9601), 18 feet 10 inches by 1 foot 3 5/8 inches; the Leyden papyrus of Qenna, of the XVIIIth dynasty, measures about 50 feet; and the Dublin papyrus (Da of M. Naville's edition), XVIIIth dynasty, 24 feet 9 inches.\n\n2 In some sections the border is painted yellow and orange.\n\n3 See plates 1, 15, 24.]\n\nscribe has been obliged to crowd the text (e.g., in plate 11) and at times he has written it on the border (see plates 14, 17). This proves that the vignettes were drawn before the text was written.\n\nAll the different sections of the papyrus were not originally written for Ani, for his name has been added in several places' by a later hand. As however such additions do not occur in the first section, which measures 16 feet 4 inches in length, it must be concluded that that section was written expressly for him, and that the others were some of those ready-written copies in which blank spaces were left for the insertion of the names of the deceased persons for whom they were purchased. The scribe who filled in Ani's name in these spaces wrote hurriedly, for in Chapter XXXB., line 2 (pl. 15), he left himself no space to write the word \"Osiris\" in the phrase, \"Ani victorious before Osiris\" (compare pl. 1, line 5); in Chapter XLIII., lines 1, 2 (pl. 17), he has written it twice; in Chapter IX., l. 1 (pl. 18), he has omitted the determinative in Chapter XV., line 2 (pl. 20) he meant to write \"Ani, victorious in peace (pl. 19), but wrote \"Ani in triumph\" in Chapter CXXV., line 18 (pl. 30), the word ### is written twice, probably, however, with the view of filling up the line; in Chapter CLI. (Pl. 34) the name is written crookedly, and the determinative is omitted; and in Chapters XVIII. (Introduction, pl. 12) and CXXXIV. (pl. 22). the scribe has, in two spaces, omitted to write the name. It seems tolerably certain that all the sections of the papyrus were written about the same time, and that they are the work of scribes of the same school; the variations in the depth of the space occupied by the text and the difference in the colours of the border only show that even the best scribes did not tie themselves to any one plan or method in preparing a copy of the Book of the Dead. The text has many serious errors: by some extraordinary oversight it includes two copies of the XVIII th Chapter, one with an unusual introduction and the other without introduction; and a large section of the XVIIth Chapter, one of the most important in the whole work, has been entirely omitted. Such mistakes and omissions, however, occur in papyri older than that of Ani, for in the papyrus of Nebseni (B.M., No. 9900), which was written at Memphis early in the XVIIIth dynasty, of Chapters L., LVI., LXIV., CLXXX., two copies each, of\n\n[1. See Chapter XXVI, l. 1 (pl. 15); Chapter XLV., l. 1 (pl. 16); Chapter IX, 1. 6 (pl. 18); Chapter CXXXIV., 1. 15 (pl. 22); Chapter LXXVIII., l. 1 (p. 25); Chap. LXXX., l. 1 (pl. 28); Chapter CLXXXV., l. 15 (pl. 36).]\n\nChapters C. and CVI., three copies, and of Chapter XVII. two extracts are given in different parts of the papyrus.[1]\n\nThe papyrus of Ani is undated, and no facts are given in it concerning the life of Ani, whereby it would be possible to fix its exact place in the series of the illustrated papyri of the Theban period to which it belongs. His full titles are:--\n\nsuten in maa an hesb hetep neter en neteru nebu\n\nRoyal scribe veritable, scribe and accountant of the divine offerings (i.e., revenues) of all the gods.\n\nmer tenti en nebu Abtu an hetep neter en\n\nThe governor of the granary of the lords of Abydos, scribe of the divine offerings (i.e., revenues) of\n\nand he is said to be \"beloved of the lord of the North and South\" and to \"love him\". The name of the king thus referred to cannot be stated. That Ani's rank of \"royal scribe\" [2] was not titular only is shown by the addition of the word \"veritable,\" and his office of scribe and accountant of all the gods was probably one of the highest which a scribe could hold.[3] His other offices of \"governor of the granary of the lords of Abydos,\" and \"scribe of the sacred property of the lords of Thebes,\" further prove his rank and importance, for Abydos and Thebes were the most ancient and sacred cities of Egypt.\n\nAni's wife Thuthu is described as \"the lady of the house, the qematet of Amen\".[4] What the title \"lady of the house\n\n[1. Naville, Einleitung, pp. 48-54.\n\n2. See Brugsch, Aegyptologie, p. 223.\n\n3. In the list of the high officers of the priesthood given by Brugsch (Aegyptologie, p. 218), we meet with an official whose title is ###, \"the scribe set over the sacred property of the gods\"; Ani held a similar appointment.\n\n4 Plate 19; her name is nowhere else mentioned in the papyrus.]\n\nmeans has not yet been decided, but qemat is the title applied to the noble ladies who sang or played on an instrument in the temple of a god.[1] The lady Thuthu belonged to the number of the priestesses of the god Amen-Ra at Thebes, and she always carries in her hands the sistrum. and the instrument menat, the emblems of her office. Thus Ani and his wife were high ecclesiastical dignitaries connected with the famous confraternity of the priests of Amen.\n\nCopies of the Book of the Dead in the Theban period.\n\nAn examination of the papyri of the Theban period preserved in the British Museum shows that two distinct classes of Book of the Dead papyri existed in the XVIIIth dynasty. In the first both text and vignettes are traced in black outline,[2] the rubrics, catchwords, etc., alone being in red colour; in the second the text only is black, the rubrics, etc., being red, and the vignettes beautifully painted in a number of bright colours. To the latter class the papyrus of Ani belongs, but, if the text and vignettes be compared with those found in any other early Theban papyri, it will be seen that it occupies an independent position in all respects. Though agreeing in the main with the papyri of the XVIIIth dynasty in respect of textual readings, the papyrus of Ani has peculiarities in spelling, etc., which are not found in any of them. The handwriting of the first section at least suggests the best period of the XVIIIth dynasty; but as the scribe forms some of the characters in a way peculiarly his own, the palæographic evidence on this point is not decisive. That the papyrus belongs to the period which produced such documents as the papyrus of Neb-qet,[3] and the papyrus of Qenna,[4] i.e., to some period of the XVIIIth dynasty, is tolerably certain; and we may assume that it is older than the papyrus of Hunefer, which was written during the reign of Seti I.; for, though belonging to the same class of highly decorated papyri, the execution of the vignettes is finer and more careful, and the free, bold forms of the hieroglyphics in the better written sections more closely resemble those of the texts inscribed in stone under the greatest kings of the XVIIIth dynasty. The \"lord of the two lands,\" i.e., of Upper and Lower Egypt, or the North and South, mentioned in pl. 4, is probably one of the Thothmes or Amenhetep kings, and accordingly we may place the period of our papyrus between 1500 and 1400 years B.C.\n\n[1. In the stele of Canopus, is rendered by {Greek ta`s i'era`s parðe'nous}; see Brugsch, Wörterbuch, P. 1454.\n\n2. Compare the papyrus of Nebseni (British Museum, No. 9, 900)\n\n3. Le Papyrus de Neb-Qued, ed. Devéria, Paris, 1872. M. Pierret, its translator, says, \"Il appartient la plus ancienne époque des exemplaires sur papyrus.\"\n\n4 Papyrus Égyptien Funéraire Hiéroglyphique (t. ii.), ed. Leemans, Leyden, 1882.]\n\nThe text may be divided into two parts. The first part contains unusual versions of two hymns to Ra and Osiris, the vignette of the sunrise (Chapter XVIA.), and the judgment Scene accompanied by texts, some of which occur in no other papyrus. The second part comprises about sixty-two Chapters of the Theban edition of the Book, in the following order:--I., XXII. LXXII., rubric, XVII., CXLVII., CXLVI., XVIII., XXIII., XXIV., XXVI. XXXB., LXI., LIV., XXIX., XXVII., LVIII., LIX., XLIV., XLV., XLVI., L., XCIII., XLIII., LXXXIX., XCI., XCII., LXXIV., VIII., II., IX., CXXXII., X., [XLVIII.], XV., CXXXIII., CXXXIV., XVIII., CXXIV., LXXXVI., LXXVII., LXXVIII., LXXXVII., LXXXVIII., LXXXII., LXXXV., LXXXIII., LXXXIV., LXXXIA., LXXX., CLXXV., CXXV. Introduction and Negative Confession, XLII., CXXV., Rubric, CLV., CLVI., XXIXB., CLXVI., CLI., VI., CX., CXLVIII., CLXXXV., and CLXXXVI. The titles of these Chapters arranged according to the numeration introduced by Lepsius are as follows :--\n\nChapter I. \"Here begin the chapters of 'coming forth by day,' and of the songs of praise and of glorifying, and of coming forth from and of going into the glorious Neter-khert in the beautiful Amenta; to be said on the day of the burial going in after coming forth.\" (See pp. 19, 270 and pll. 5, 6.)\n\nThe papyri belonging to the early part of the XVIIth dynasty call this Chapter the \"Chapter of going in to the divine chiefs of Osiris,\" ###. The large numbers of the men attending the bier and of the weeping women are peculiar to the Ani papyrus.\n\nChapter II. \"The Chapter of coming forth by day and of living after death.\" (See pp. 120, 321, and pl. 18.)\n\nThis Chapter is found only in one other papyrus of the Theban period (British Museum, No. 9964). Another copy of it is inscribed upon a mummy bandage preserved in the Louvre, No. 3097.'\n\nChapter VI.--[See Chapter CLI., of which it forms a part, pp. 233, 362, and pl. 32.] In the papyrus of Nebseni (British Museum, No. 9900) this Chapter stands by itself, and is entitled \"Chapter of making the ushabti figures to perform work for a man in the Neter-khert,\"\n\n[1. See Naville, Einleitung, p. 103.]\n\nChapter VIII. \"The Chapter of passing through Amenta, and of coming forth by day.\" (See pp. 119, 320, and pl. 18.)\n\nAs a separate composition, this Chapter is found in only two other papyri of the XVIIIth dynasty.[1]\n\nChapter IX. \"The Chapter of coming forth by day, having passed through the tomb.\" (See pp. 120, 321, and pl. 18.)\n\nThe vignette in the papyrus of Ani is similar to that which stands at the head of Chapters VIII. and IX. in other papyri of this period.\n\nChapter X. [See Chapter XLVIII., pp. 123, 321, and pl. 18.]\n\nChapter XV. 1. \"A hymn of praise to Ra when he riseth in the eastern sky.\" (See pp. 1, 236, and pl. I.)\n\nThis version is found in no other papyrus.\n\nChapter XV. 2. \"A hymn of praise to Osiris Unnefer, the great god in Abydos,\"[2] etc. (See pp. 8, 253, and pl. 2.)\n\nChapter XV. 3. \"A hymn of praise to Ra when he riseth in the eastern sky, and when he setteth in the [land of] life.\" (See pp. 123, 322, and pl. 18-21.)\n\nThe Litany to Osiris (pl. 19) and the hymn to Ra (pll. 24, 25) which follow are variants of the XVth Chapter, similar to those published by M. Naville.[3]\n\nChapter XVIA. consists of a vignette only. (See p. 252, and pl. 2.) Strictly speaking, it should form the vignette of the XVth Chapter, or of that part of it which refers to the rising sun. Like many other ancient papyri, the papyrus of Ani has no vignette referring to the sunset.\n\nChapter XVII. \"Here begin the praises and glorifyings of coming out from and of going into the glorious Neter-khert in the beautiful Amenta, of coming forth by day in all the transformations which please him, of playing at draughts, and of sitting in the Sekh hall, and of coming forth as a living soul.\" (See pp. 27, 280, and Pll. 7-10.)\n\nThis is one of the oldest and most important of all the Chapters in the Book of the Dead, and it contains the most complete statements concerning the Egyptian cosmogony as formulated by the college of priests of Heliopolis. The scribe seems to have accidentally omitted a large section.\n\nChapter XVIII. This Chapter has no title.\n\n[1. I.e., in British Museum papyrus, No. 9964, and in a papyrus in Rome; see Naville, Einleitung, p. 118.\n\n2. This hymn may form no part of the XVth chapter, and may have been inserted after the hymn to Ra on account of Ani's official connection with the ecclesiastical endowments of Abydos.]\n\nThe papyrus of Ani contains two copies of this Chapter. In the first the gods of the localities are grouped separately, and it is preceded by a very rare introduction, in which the An-mut-f and Sa-mer-f priests introduce Ani to the gods, whom he addresses in two speeches. (See p. 71, 301, and pll. 12-14.) In the second the text is not divided into distinct sections, and the gods are not grouped. (See p. 330, and pll. 23-24.)\n\nChapter XXII., \"The Chapter of giving a mouth to Osiris Ani, the scribe It and teller of the holy offerings of all the gods.\" (See pp. 25, 274, and pl. 6.)\n\nThe ceremony of giving a mouth to the deceased was, according to the vignette in the papyrus of Nebseni, performed by the \"Guardian of the Balance \". In the papyrus of Ani there is no vignette, and it is remarkable that this Chapter follows immediately after Chapter 1.\n\nChapter XXIII. \"The Chapter of opening the mouth of Osiris, the scribe Ani.\" (See pp. 84, 306, and pl. 15.)\n\nChapter XXIV. \"The Chapter of bringing charms unto Osiris Ani in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 85, 306, and pl. 15.)\n\nAs with other ancient Theban papyri, the papyrus of Ani gives no Vignette.\n\nChapter XXVI. \"The Chapter of giving a heart unto Osiris Ani in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 88, 308, and pl. 15.)\n\nThe vignette is probably unique.\n\nChapter XXVII. \"The Chapter of not letting the heart of a man be taken away from him in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 100, 312, and pl. 15.)\n\nThe vignette is unusual.\n\nChapter XXIX. \"The Chapter of not letting the heart of a man be taken away from him in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 97, 311, and pl. 15.)\n\nNo other copy of this Chapter is at present known.\n\nChapter XXIXB. \"The Chapter of a heart of carnelian.\" (See pp. 228, 359, and pl. 33.)\n\nChapter XXXB. \"The Chapter of not letting the heart of Osiris Ani be driven away from him in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. I 1, 90, 258, 309, and pl. 15-)\n\nChapter XLII. This Chapter is without title (see pp. 213, 353, and pl. 32), but in other ancient papyri it is called \"Repulsing of slaughter in Suten-henen.\"\n\nChapter XLIII. \"The Chapter of not letting the head of a man be cut off from him in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 111, 317, and pl. 17.)\n\nAs in other ancient Theban papyri, this Chapter is without vignette.\n\nChapter XLIV. \"The Chapter of not dying a second time in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 105, 315, and pl. 16.)\n\nThe vignette is peculiar to the papyrus of Ani.\n\nChapter XLV. \"The Chapter of not suffering corruption in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 106, 315, and pl. 16.)\n\nOnly one other copy of the text of this Chapter is known.[1] Among Theban papyri the vignette is peculiar to the papyrus of Ani.\n\nChapter XLVI. \"The Chapter of not perishing and of becoming alive in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 107, 316, and pl. 16.)\n\nOnly one other copy of the text of this Chapter is known (B.M. No. 9900). Among Theban papyri the vignette is peculiar to the papyrus of Ani.\n\nChapter XLVIII. \"Another Chapter of one who cometh forth by day against his foes in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 123, 321, and pl. 18.)\n\nOnly one other copy of the text of this Chapter is known (B.M. No. 9900). Among Theban papyri the vignette is peculiar to the papyrus of Ani.\n\nChapter L. \"The Chapter of not entering in unto the block.\" (See pp. 108, 315, and pl. 16.)\n\nThe text of this Chapter agrees rather with the second version in the papyrus of Nebseni than with that in B.M. papyrus No. 9964. As the Ani papyrus is of Theban origin this was to be expected.\n\nChapter LIV. \"The Chapter of giving breath in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 94, 310, and pl. 15.)\n\nOnly one other copy of this Chapter is known, and it is without vignette.[2]\n\nChapter LVIII. \" The Chapter of breathing the air, and of having power over the water in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 103, 314, and pl. 16.)\n\nNo other copy of this Chapter is known.\n\nChapter LIX. \"The Chapter of breathing the air, and of having power over the water in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 104, 315, and pl. 16.)\n\nOnly one other copy of this Chapter is known.[2]\n\nChapter LXI. \"The Chapter of not letting the soul of a man be taken away from him in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 91, 309, and pl. 15.)\n\nThe vignette is similar to that in the papyrus of Sutimes, which M. Naville believes to be no older than the XIXth dynasty.[3]\n\n[1. Naville, Einleitung, p. 134.\n\nChapter LXXII.--Rubric. (See pp. 26, 275, and pl. 6.)\n\nChapter LXXIV. \"The Chapter of walking with the legs and of coming forth upon earth.\" (See pp. 118, 320, and pl. 18.)\n\nChapter LXXVII. \" The Chapter of changing into a golden hawk .\" (See pp. 152, 332, and pl. 25.)\n\nChapter LXXVIII. \"The Chapter of changing into a divine hawk.\" (See pp. 154, 333, and pl. 25, 26.)\n\nChapter LXXX. \"The Chapter of changing into the god who giveth light in the darkness.\" (See pp. 182, 341, and pl. 28.)\n\nChapter LXXXIA. \"The Chapter of changing into a lotus.\" (See pp. 181, 340, and pl. 28.)\n\nThe pool of water in the vignette is uncommon.\n\nChapter LXXXII. \"The Chapter of changing into Ptah.\" (See pp. 170, 337, and pl. 27.)\n\nAs in other XVIIIth dynasty papyri, this Chapter has a vignette.\n\nChapter LXXXIII. \"The Chapter of changing into a bennu bird\" (phœnix?). (See pp. 176, 339, and pl. 27.)\n\nLike other XVIIIth dynasty papyri, this Chapter lacks the addition which is found in the papyrus of Sutimes.\n\nChapter LXXXIV. \"The Chapter of changing into a heron.\" (See pp. 178, 339, and pl. 28.)\n\nChapter LXXXV. \" The Chapter of changing into the soul of Tmu.\" (See pp. 172, 338, and pl. 27.)\n\nThe vignette to this Chapter is similar to that of the papyrus of Tura, surnamed Nefer-uben-f, of the XVIIIth dynasty.'\n\nChapter LXXXVI. \"The Chapter of changing into a swallow.\" (See pp. 250, 331, and pl. 25.)\n\nChapter LXXXVII. \"The Chapter of changing into Seta.\" (See pp. 169, 337, and pl. 27.)\n\nChapter LXXXVIII. \"The Chapter of changing into a crocodile.\" (See pp. 170, 337, and pl. 27.)\n\nChapter LXXXIX. \"The Chapter of causing the soul to be united to its body in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 112, 318, and pl. 17.)\n\nThe two incense burners which stand, one at the head and one at the foot of the bier, are peculiar to the papyrus of Ani.\n\n[1. Naville, Einleitung, p. 97.]\n\nChapter XCI. \"The Chapter of not letting the soul of a man be captive in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 114, 319, and pl. 17.)\n\nChapter XCII. \"The Chapter of opening the tomb to the soul and the shadow, of coming forth by day, and of getting power over the legs.\" (See pp. 115, 319, and pl. 17.)\n\nThe vignette of this Chapter is unusual and of great interest, for in it Ani's soul accompanies his shadow.\n\nChapter XCIII. \"The Chapter of not letting a man pass over to the east in Neter-khert.\" (See pp. 109, 317, and pl. 17-)\n\nThe vignette as here given is peculiar to the papyrus of Ani.\n\nChapter XCIIIA. \"Another Chapter.\" (See pp. 110, 317, and pl. 17.)\n\nChapter CX. \"Here begin the Chapters of the Sekhet-hetepu, and the Chapters of coming forth by day, and of going into and coming out from Neter-khert, and of arriving in the Sekhet-Aanru, and of being in peace in the great city wherein are fresh breezes.\" (See pp. 236, 362, and pl. 34.)\n\nThe text is here incomplete.\n\nChapter CXXIV. \"The Chapter of going unto the divine chiefs of Osiris.\" (See pp. 146, 330, and pl. 24.)\n\nIn the vignette we should expect four, instead of three, gods.\n\nChapter CXXV. \"The Chapter of entering into the Hall of double Right and Truth: a hymn of praise to Osiris.\" (See pp. 189, 344, and pl. 30.)\n\nThe Introduction to this Chapter as found in the papyrus of Ani is not met with elsewhere; the text which usually follows the \"Negative Confession\" is however omitted. The vignette as here given is peculiar to the papyrus of Ani.\n\nChapter CXXXII. \"The Chapter of making a man to return to see again his home upon earth.\" (See pp. 121, 321, and pl. 18.)\n\nChapter CXXX III. \"[A Chapter] to be said on the day of the month.\" (See pp. 138, 327, and pl. 21.)\n\nChapter CXXXIII.--Rubric. (See pp. 142, 328, and pl. 22.)\n\nChapter CXXXIV. \"A hymn of praise to Ra on the day of the month wherein he saileth in the boat.\" (See pp. 142, 329, and pl. 22.)\n\nChapter CXLVI. \"The Chapter of renewing the pylons in the House of Osiris which is in the Sekhet-Aanru.\" (See pp. 63, 295, and pll. 11, 12.)\n\nChapter CXLVII. \"A Chapter to be said when Ani cometh to the first Aril.\" (See pp. 56, 291, and pll. 11, 12.)\n\nChapter CXLVIII. Without title. See pp. 239, 366, and pl. 35.)\n\nChapter CLI. Scene in the mummy chamber. (See pp. 229, 360, and Pll. 33, 34.)\n\nChapter CLV. \"The Chapter of a Tet of gold.\" (See pp. 225, 357, and pl. 33.)\n\nChapter CLVI. \"The Chapter of a Buckle of carnelian.\" (See pp. 227, 359, and pl. 33.)\n\nChapter CLXVI. \"The Chapter of the Pillow which is placed under the head.\" (See pp. 228, 359, and pl. 33.)\n\nChapter CLXXV. \" The Chapter of not dying a second time.\" (See pp. 184, 341, and pl. 29.)\n\nOnly one other much mutilated copy of this most important Chapter is known. In it it is declared that neither men nor gods can conceive what great glory has been laid up for Ani in his existence in the next world, and that his life therein shall be for \"millions of millions of years.\"\n\nChapter CLXXXV. \"A Hymn of Praise to Osiris, the dweller in Amenta, Un-nefer within Abtu (Abydos).\" (See pp. 241, 367, and pl. 36.)\n\nChapter CLXXXVI. \"A Hymn of praise to Hathor.\" (See pp. 242, 368. and pl. 37.)",
