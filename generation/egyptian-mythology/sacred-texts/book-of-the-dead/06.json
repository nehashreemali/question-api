  "content": "The word neter and its meaning.\n\nTo the great and supreme power which made the earth, the heavens, the sea, the sky, men and women, animals, birds, and creeping things, all that is and all that shall be, the Egyptians gave the name neter. This word survives in the Coptic ###, but both in the ancient language and in its younger relative the exact meaning of the word is lost. M. Pierret,[2] following de Rougé, connects it with the word ### and says that it means \"renovation\" (renouvellement), but Brugsch[3] renders it by \"göttlich,\" \"heilig,\" \"divin,\" \"sacré,\" and by three Arabic words which mean \"divine,\" \"sacred or set apart,\" and \"holy\" respectively. By a quotation from the stele of Canopus he shows that in Ptolemaic times it meant \"holy\" or \"sacred\" when applied to the animals of the gods. Mr. Renouf[4] says that \"the notion expressed by nutar as a noun, and nutra as an adjective or verb, must be sought in the Coptic ###, which in the translation of the Bible corresponds to the Greek words {Greek du'namis, i?sxu's, i?sxuro's, i?sxupo'w} 'power,' 'force,' 'strong,' 'fortify,' 'protect,'\"[5] and he goes on to show that the word neter means \"strong\" or \"mighty.\" M. Maspero, however, thinks that the Coptic nomti has nothing in common with meter, the Egyptian word for God, and that the passages quoted by Mr. Renouf in support of his theory can be otherwise explained.[6] His own opinion is that the signification \"strong,\" if it ever existed, is a derived and not an original meaning, and he believes that the word is\n\n[1. Several examples of the different ways in which the word is spelt are given by Maspero, Notes sur différent point de Grammaire (in Mélanges d'Archéologie, t. ii., Paris, 1873, p. 140).\n\n2.

The fact that the Coptic translators of the Bible used the word nouti to express the name of the Supreme Being shows that no other word conveyed to their minds their conception of Him, and supports M. Maspero's views on this point. Another definition of the word given by Brugsch makes it to mean \"the active power which produces and creates things in regular recurrence; which bestows new life upon them, and gives back to them their youthful vigour,\"[1] and he adds that the innate conception of the word completely covers the original meaning of the Greek {Greek fu'sis} and the Latin natura.\n\nBut side by side with neter, whatever it may mean, we have mentioned in texts of all ages a number of beings called neteru which Egyptologists universally translate by the word \"gods.\" Among these must be included the great cosmic powers and the beings who, although held to be supernatural, were yet finite and mortal, and were endowed by the Egyptians with love, hatred, and passions of every sort and kind. The difference between the conceptions of neter the one supreme God and the neteru is best shown by an appeal to Egyptian texts.\n\nIn the pyramid of Unas it is said to the deceased,\n\nThou existest at the side of God.[3]\n\nIn the pyramid of Teta it is said of the deceased,\n\nut'a-f met neter as set'em-nef metu\n\nHe weigheth words, and, behold, God hearkeneth unto the words.[3]\n\nGod hath called Teta[4] (in his name, etc.).\n\n[1.

It may be urged that we might as well translate neter by \"a god\" or \"the god,\" but other evidence of the conception of neter at that early date is afforded by the following passages from the Prisse papyrus,[5] which, although belonging at the earliest to he XIth dynasty, contains copies of the Precepts of Kaqemna, written in the reign of Seneferu, a king of the IVth dynasty, and the Precepts of Ptah-hetep, written during the reign of Assa, a king of the Vth dynasty.[6]\n\n[1.

Amélineau thinks (La Morale Égyptienne, p. xi.) that the Prisse papyrus was copied about the period of the XVIIth dynasty and that the works in it only date from the XIIth dynasty; but many Egyptologists assign the composition of the work to the age of Assa.

Amélineau, La Morale, p. 141.\n\nThe passages from the pyramid of Pepi show at once the difference between neter as God, and the \"gods\" neteru; the other passages, which might be multiplied almost indefinitely, prove that the Being spoken of is God. The neteru or \"gods\" whom Unas hunted, and snared, and killed, and roasted, and ate, are beings who could die; to them were attributed bodies, souls, ka's, spiritual bodies, etc. In a remarkable passage from the CLIVth Chapter of the Book of the Dead (Naville, Todtenbuch, Bd. I., Bl. 179, l. 3) the deceased king Thothmes III. prays:--\n\nseset-kua emxet-k Tem huau ma ennu ari-k\n\nPreserve me behind thee, O Tmu, from decay such as that which thou workest\n\ner meter neb netert nebt er aut neb er t'etfet neb\n\nfor god every, and goddess every, for animals all, for reptiles all\n\nsebuit-f per ba-f emxet mit-f ha-f\n\nfor each passeth away when hath gone forth his soul after his death, he perisheth\n\nafter he hath passed away.\n\nOf these mortal gods some curious legends have come down to us; from which the following may be selected as illustrating their inferior position.",
