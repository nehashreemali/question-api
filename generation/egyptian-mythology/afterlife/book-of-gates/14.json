  "content": "The majesty of this great god taketh up his position in this Circle at the limits of the thick darkness, and this great god is born under the form of KHEPERA in this Circle. The gods NU and AMMUI, and HEH and HEH[UT] are in this Circle at the birth of this great god, when he maketh his appearance from the Tuat, and taketh up his place in the Matet Boat, and riseth from between the thighs of the goddess Nut.\n\nTHENEN-NETERU is the name of the gate of this City.\n\nKHEPER-KEKUI-KHA-MESTI is the name of this City. [This is] the secret Circle of the Tuat, wherein this great god is born, when he maketh his appearance in NU, and taketh up his place in the body of NUT.\n\nWhosoever shall make [a copy] of these [representations] according to the figures which are depicted on the east [wall] of the palace of Ament of the Tuat, they shall be magical protectors to him that knoweth them upon earth, both in heaven and on earth.\n\nAt this point the light beginneth [to come], and it is the end of the thick darkness which Ra travelleth through in Amentet, and of the secret matters which this great god performed therein. He who hath no knowledge of the whole (?) or part (?) of the secret\n\nrepresentations of the Tuat, shall be condemned to destruction.\n\nWhosoever shall make [a copy] of these [representations] according to this copy of what is in the Ament of the Tuat, [which] cannot be looked at or seen, and whosoever shall know these secret images shall be in the condition of the spirit who is equipped [for journeying], and shall come forth [from] and shall descend into the Tuat, and shall hold converse with the men and women who live [there] regularly and unfailingly, millions of times.",
