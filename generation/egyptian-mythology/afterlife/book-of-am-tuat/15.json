  "content": "THE TWELFTH DIVISION 1 of the Tuat, which is passed through by the Sun-god during the TWELFTH HOUR of the night, is introduced by three lines of text, which read:--\n\n\"The Majesty of this great god taketh up his position in this Circle, which is the uttermost limit of thick darkness, and this great god is born in his form of Khepera in this Circle, and Nut and Nu are in this Circle for the birth of this great god when he cometh forth from the Tuat and taketh up his position in the Matet Boat, and when he riseth up from the thighs of Nut. The name of the Gate of this City is THEN-NETERU. The name of this City is KHEPER-KEKIU-KHAU-MESTU. The name of the hour of the night wherein this god cometh into being is MAA-NEFERT-RA.\"\n\nAbove the whole scene is a line of hieroglyphics, which describes it as:--\n\n\"The hidden Circle in the Tuat wherein this great god is born; he cometh forth into the pool of Nu, and he taketh up his place in the body of Nut. Whosoever shall make a copy thereof according to the copies which exist in writing upon the east [wall\n\nClick to view\n The Boat of the Sun in the last hour of the Night.\n\nof] the palace, and shall know it upon earth, it shall act as a magical protector for him both in heaven and upon earth.\"\n\nIn the middle register are:--\n\n1. The boat of the sun, in which stands the god under a canopy formed by the body of the serpent Mehen; on his head are horns and a disk. In the fore part of the, boat is the beetle of KHEP[R]A,\n\ni.e., Khepera, which takes the place of the solar disk that rested on the prow of the boat in the Eleventh Hour.\n\nThe text reads: \"This great god in this picture journeyeth along through this City by means of the faithful servants (amkhiu) of this hidden image ANKH-NETERU. His gods draw him along by a cord, and he entereth into his tail and cometh forth from his mouth, and cometh to the birth under the form of Khepera, and the gods who are in his boat [do] likewise. He taketh up his place on the face of the hidden image of the horn (or, forehead) of the sky at the end of the thick darkness, and his hands seal lip the Tuat. Then this great god taketh up his position in the Eastern Horizon of heaven, and Shu receiveth him, and he cometh into being in the East.\"\n\n2. Twelve gods, who are occupied in towing along the boat of the Sun, each with his head turned behind him and looking at the boat; their names are:--\n\nThe text which refers to these reads:\n\n[paragraph continues] \"Those who are in this picture draw this great god through the tail (or, bowels) of the serpent Ankh-neteru. The loyal servants of Ra who are in his following are the product of his hands, and they are born on the earth each day after the birth of this great god in the eastern portion of the sky. They enter into this hidden image of Ankh-neteru in the form of loyal servants, and they come forth in the renewed forms of Ra every day. When they tarry upon the earth it is an abomination to them to utter the name of the god.\"\n\n3. The monster serpent KA-EM-ANKH-NETERU.\n\n4. Twelve goddesses, who are occupied in towing the boat of the sun through the body of the serpent KA-EM-ANKH-NETERU; each has her head turned behind her, and is looking at the boat.

This is the hidden image of the serpent Ankh-neteru, which is by his den in the Tuat, and he resteth in [his] place every day. This great god speaketh to him in [his] name of NA, [and the space covered by] his forepaws and legs is one thousand three hundred cubits long . . . . . . .; he liveth upon the sound of the rumblings of the earth. The servants who are loyal to his service come forth from [his] mouth every day.\"\n\nThe text relating to the twelve goddesses reads: \"Those who are in this picture take the towing rope of the boat of Ra when it cometh forth\n\nfrom the serpent ANKH-NETERU, and they tow this great god into the sky, and lead him along the ways of the upper sky.

They follow after this god, and the flames which issue from their mouths drive away Apep on behalf of Ra into the Hall of the East of the Horizon. They journey round about the upper heavens in his following [remaining] in their places, and they restore these gods after this great god hath passed by the hidden chamber of the sky, and then they take up their positions [again] in their own abodes. They give pleasure to the hearts of the gods of Amentet through Ra-Heru-khut, and their work upon the earth is to drive away those who\n\nare in the darkness by the flames of their uraei which are behind them, and they guide Ra along, and they smite Apep for him in the sky.\"\n\n2.

Heaven belongeth to thy soul, which taketh up its place therein, and the earth belongeth to thy body, thou lord of homage. Thou sailest over the Horizon, thou takest up thy place in thy shrine, the gods in their bodies praise thee; descend thou into the sky and take thou thy two souls through thy magical protectors.' The work of these gods in the Tuat is to praise this great god, and they stand in this City and they count up (or, verify) the gods of the country of Mafket (i.e., Sinai).

They themselves belong to their Halls of the Horizon, but the forms which\n\nthey have in the Tuat [belong to] this Circle.\"\n\n2. \"Those who are in this picture with their paddles drive Apep to the back of the sky, after the birth of the god. Their work is to hold up the Great Disk in the Eastern Horizon of the sky every day. Behold the serpent SENMEKHEF which burneth up the enemies of Ra at the dawn! These gods go round about the heights of heaven in the following of this great god every day, and they receive their protection for this Circle.\"\n\n3. \"Those who are in this picture are behind the image of Osiris, who is over the thick darkness.

Life [to thee], O governor of Amentet, Osiris, who art over the beings of Amentet! Life to thee! Life to thee! O thou who art over the Tuat, the winds of Ra are to thy nostrils, and the nourishment of Kheper is with thee. Thou livest, and ye live. Hail to Osiris, the lord of the living, that is to say, of the gods who are with Osiris, and who came into being with him the first time.'

Above his head is the beetle, symbol of Khep[er], who has emerged from the boat of the Sun-god, and below is the \"image of Af,\" that is to say, the body of the night Sun-god, which has been cast away.\n\n256:1 See Lanzone, Domicile, pl. v.",
