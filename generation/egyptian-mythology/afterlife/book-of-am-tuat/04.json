(Right) Maati goddesses. Neken-f.\n\ntwo parts by a river which flows along it. In the upper part is the boat of the dead Sun-god AF, who is in the form of a rain-headed man; he wears a disk upon his head, and stands within a shrine in the SEKTET boat, i.e., the boat in which the god travels\n\nfrom noon to sunset. In front of the shrine in the boat stand the three deities, AP-UAT, SA, and the \"Lady of the Boat,\" who wears on her head a disk and horns. Behind the shrine stand five gods, each having the head of a man; the names of the first four are HERU-HEKENU, KA-SHU, i.e., the \"double of Shu,\" NEHES, i.e., the \"Look-out,\" and HU, and the fifth is the Steersman KHERP. On the high prow of the Sektet boat hangs an object which is said to be a carpet by some, and a reed mat by others, and on the side, near the curve of the prow, is an utchat. In front of the boat march:--\n\n1. The two goddesses MAAT, the one representing the South of Egypt, and the other the North.\n\n2. The god NEKENT-F, who holds a spear, or knife, in his left hand.\n\n3. The god KHENTI AMENTET, bearded, and in mummy form, and wearing the White Crown and the Menat.\n\n4. The god SEKHET, or as it is written here SEKHMET, lioness-headed.\n\n5. The god SEHETCH-UR, ram-headed.\n\n6. Four Terms, the first of which is called UT-METU-RA,\n\nthe second UT-METU-TEM, the third UT-METU-KHEPERA, and the fourth UT-METU-ASAR.\n\n7. The leader of the company, who is called TCHA-UNNUT; by his side is a serpent, called SA (?), that stands on his tail.\n\nClick to view\n The gods Khenti-Amentet, Sekhet, Sebeteh-ur, the Four-Terms, and Teha-Unnut.\n\nThis scene is explained by the horizontal line of inscription written above it, and the hieroglyphic text, based on the editions of Lefébure and Champollion, reads:--\n\n\"The name of this Field is 'MAATI.' This god arriveth in the SEKTET BOAT, he maketh a way through the Court of this city, which is two hundred and twenty measures in length, which he travelleth through to URNES. He passeth through the water, which is three hundred measures in extent, and he bestoweth the fields upon the gods who follow him. NET-RA is the name of this Field, ARNEBAUI is the name of the guardian [of this Field]. This god beginneth to declare in this region the words which perform the destinies (?) of those who are in the Tuat.\"\n\nIn the lower part of the middle section of the scene we have another boat, in the centre. of which is a beetle; on one side of the beetle is a god with his knees in the direction of the prow of the boat, but having his head turned behind him and his hands raised in adoration of the beetle, and on the other is a god who also has his hands raised in adoration of the same object. The legend reads \"the coming into being of Osiris\"; as the boat has\n\nno reed mat or carpet hanging from the prow, we may assume that it is intended to represent the Atet or Matet Boat, i.e., the boat in which the Sun-god travelled over the sky from sunrise to noon.\n\nClick to view\n The Boat of the Birth of Osiris, with serpents and gods.\n\n[paragraph continues] In front of the boat glide three serpents, which are called SEK-RE, SEFA, and NEPEN, and in front of these march four man-headed\n\nClick to view\n Gods in the procession of the Boat of the Birth of Osiris.\n\ngods and two hawk-headed gods, each with a serpent in his left hand, a god called NABTI, who holds a crook in each hand, NET, or NEITH, goddess\n\nof the South, NET, or NEITH, goddess of the North, and the goat goddess ARTET. The two hawk-headed gods are called TCHATUI and METI, and the four following gods ABENTI, BENBETI, SEKHTI, and SEKHET (?).\n\nThe explanation of this scene is given by the horizontal line of hieroglyphic text written above it, which reads:--\n\n\"[The god cometh to] this Court, he passeth through it in the form of a ram, and he maketh his transformations therein. After he hath passed through this Court, the dead who are in his following do not [go with him], but they remain in this Court, and he speaketh\n\nwords unto the gods who are therein.

Give ye light unto me, and make ye yourselves guides to me, O ye who came into being, from my members, my word hath gone forth to you. Ye are made of my bodies, I have made you, having fashioned you of my soul, I have created you, I have made you by means\n\nof my enchantments, [and] I have come to avenge myself the blood of my members which have risen up against me, and I will bring to destruction that which hath been made for it. I will make perfect with the . . . . . . of my forms Osiris Khenti Amenti. Open to me the doors with your hands, O ye Apes, unfold to me the portals of the Courts, O ye Apes, [and welcome] the gods (or, goddesses) who have come into being from my divine Souls, come ye into being, come ye into being for(?) KHEPERA, O ye who have your being at the head of the Tuat. Stand ye up, in URNES, and stablish ye yourselves on the secret banks thereof, and work ye for the gods of Tuat in the Court which ye guard, possess ye your plans in your seats, in your domains and in your fields.\"\n\nThe gods of this Court say unto Ra, \"O great god, [the doors] are opened to thee, and the portals of the secret Ament are thrown open before thee, the doors of Nut the great are thrown wide open, illumine thou the darkness of night (or, thick darkness), provide for that which is in the place of destruction, and approach thou in thy name of Ra the place where is OSIRIS KHENTI AMENTI. There is a shout of joy to Ra at the entrance to the doors of the earth (?). Praise be to thee and make thou perfect the light, and enter thou [in through the habitations] of the Great Country. The Apes (ambenti) open the doors to thee, the Apes (amhetetu) unfold to thee the portals, the serpents sing, and exalt thee, and the divine serpents\n\nlighten thy darkness for thee . . . . . . . O Ra, the goddess of the hour cometh to thee, the two SOUL GODDESSES tow thee along in thy form, and thou takest up thy position on the ground of the Field of [this] land. Thou hast taken possession of the night, and thou wilt bring in the day, and [thou] dost likewise make long the hours, and thy boat cometh to rest. Thou seizest the grain of the god HENBET in thy secret place (?) NET. Thou openest NET-RA, \"thou uncoverest the god TCHEBA, the uraeus goddesses (neterit) of URNES acclaim thee, the uraeus goddesses (nehenuit) ascribe praise to thee, thy word is maat against thine enemies, thou givest tribulations to those who are condemned.\"\n\nThe Majesty of this god uttereth words after he hath come forth into this Court, he doeth battle at the fortifications thereof, the doors of this [Court] are strong, saying, \"Shut [your doors] by your bolts. Come ye to me, advance ye to me, make ye your way [to me], and ye shall abide in your place; take ye up your stand on the banks of the stream [URNES].\" This great god passeth them by, and they (i.e., the gods) wail when he hath gone by them in the FIELD OF URNES. [The goddess of] the hour who guideth [this great god] through this Court is \"USHEM-HAT-KHEFTIU-NU-RA,\"\n\n16:1 See Léfebure, op. cit., part iv., pl. 28, and Description de l'Égypte, tom. v., pl. 41, no. 5.",
