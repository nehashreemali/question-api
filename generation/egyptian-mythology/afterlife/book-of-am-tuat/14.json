And Ra saith unto them:--'O ye who keep ward over your serpent-figures with your two\n\nClick to view\n (Left) Sem-Nebt-het. (Right) Sem-shet.\n\nhands, lift ye up your heads, whose hands are strong, whose feet are firm, who perform the journeyings which ye are bound to make, who make long your steps as ye go, unite ye yourselves to your offerings in the Hall of the Eastern Horizon.'
