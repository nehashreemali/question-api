  "content": "THE scene that illustrates the EIGHTH DIVISION Of the Tuat, which is passed through by the Sun-god during the EIGHTH HOUR of the night, is introduced by four lines of text which read:--\n\n\"The Majesty of this great god taketh up its place in the Circles of the hidden gods who are on their sand,\n\nand he addresseth to them words in his boat whilst the gods tow him along through this City by means of the magical powers of the serpent MEHEN. The name of the gate of this City is AHA-AN-URT-NEF. The name of this City is TEBAT-NETERU-S. The name of the Hour of the night which guideth this great god is NEBT-USHA.\"\n\nThe Circles of this Division are thus described:--\n\n\"The hidden Circles of Ament which are passed through by the great god, his boat being towed along by the gods who dwell in the Tuat; let them be made according to the figures [which are depicted] on the north of the hidden palace in the Tuat. Whosoever knoweth them by their names shall be the possessor of swathings upon earth, and he shall not be repulsed at the hidden gates, and he shall have offerings in very great abundance regularly and perpetually.\"\n\nIn the middle register are:--\n\n1. The boat of the sun, in which the god stands\n\nunder a canopy formed by the body of the serpent Mehen, being towed along by nine gods. His passage is thus described: \"This god maketh his way into this City, being towed along by the gods of the Tuat, in his hidden form of MEHEN. This god sendeth forth a cry to the regions\n\nof every Circle of this City, and also to the gods who are therein, and it is the voice of them which this god heareth after he hath sent forth a cry to them. The figures of their bodies remain always with their dead bodies which are under their sand, and their gates open to the voice of this god each day, and then they hide themselves after he hath passed by them. Their work in the Tuat is to tow Ra along over the ways of this\n\nClick to view\n The Boat of Af, the dead Sun-god, in the Eighth Hour.\n\n[paragraph continues] City, and they rise up after they have towed him along into this Hall, and they say unto him:--O thou god, come thou to thine hidden image, O our god, and to all the sepulchres of KHENTI-AMENTI, unite thyself strongly to it, and mayest thou be entreated to lighten the darkness of those who are on their sands. We beseech thee to come and to unite thyself, O Ra, to those who tow thee along.\" The eight gods\n\nwho tow along the boat of Ra are thus described: \"These are the gods of the Tuat who tow alone, Ra in the place where the gods have their sepulchres (TEBAT-NETERU-SET), and he is [acclaimed] by those who are in this City. The images secret of TATHENEN, Of Horus (?), [and of] the gods are with them.\"\n\n2. Nine large objects somewhat in the form of the hieroglyphic shems, which has the meaning of \"follower\" or \"servant\"; unlike this sign, however, each of the nine objects is provided with a huge knife, and from the curved end of each is suspended a human head. M. Maspero is undoubtedly correct in describing these as the servants of the god. The names of the nine servants are:--\n\nOf these gods it is said:\n\nClick to view\n Servants of the god Ra.\n\n[paragraph continues] \"Those who are in this\n\npicture are those who are on the path along which this god is towed, and they have their swathings before them in the form in which the god himself [had them]. This our great god crieth out unto those who have their life in them, in [their] heads in their forms, and this god crieth out to them by their names. Their work is [to seize] the enemies of Ra everywhere throughout this City, and then to make their heads to pass under their swords after this god hath passed them by.\"\n\n3. A ram, having the solar disk between his horns,\n\nClick to view\n (Left) Servants of the god Ra.

And they on their part cry out to this god with their voices which are joyful but hidden, and this god singeth a song of joy at their voices. After [this\n\nClick to view\n The Circle Sesheta.\n\ngreat god] hath passed by them, and when the darkness of night hath covered them over, they receive the diadems of Ra, and the soul of TATHENEN uniteth itself to the earth.\"\n\nIn the upper register are five Circles of the Tuat, and a door, which may be thus described:--\n\n1.
