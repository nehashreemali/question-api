If a copy of these things be made according to the figures which are depicted on the east of the hidden chamber of the Tuat, and if [a man] knoweth it, together with the names [of the gods], he shall journey round about and shall pass through the Tuat, and he shall not be turned back from making himself a companion of Ra.\"\n\nIn the upper register are:--\n\n1.
