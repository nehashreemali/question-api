However, most of the material is based substantially on previous works, some centuries older. A few of these works have been preserved in the collection of Norse poetry known as the \"Poetic Edda\".\n\nThe text of this edition is based on that published as \"The Story of the Volsungs\", translated by William Morris and Eirikr Magnusson (Walter Scott Press, London, 1888).\n\nThis electronic edition was edited, proofed, and prepared by Douglas B. Killings.",
