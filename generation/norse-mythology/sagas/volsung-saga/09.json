Then she flayed off the kirtle so that the skin came off with the sleeves, and said that this would be torment enough for him; but he said--\n\n\"Full little would Volsung have felt such a smart this.\"\n\nSo the lad came to Sigmund, and Sigmund bade him knead their meal up, while he goes to fetch firing; so he gave him the meal-sack, and then went after the wood, and by then he came back had Sinfjotli made an end of his baking. Then asked Sigmund if he had found nothing in the meal.\n\n\"I misdoubted me that there was something quick in the meal when I first fell to kneading of it, but I have kneaded it all up together, both the meal and that which was therein, whatsoever it was.\"\n\nThen Sigmund laughed out, he said--\n\n\"Naught wilt thou eat of this bread to-night, for the most deadly of worms [1] hast thou kneaded up therewith.\"\n\nNow Sigmund was so mighty a man that he might eat venom and have no hurt therefrom; but Sinfjotli might abide whatso venom came on the outside of him, but might neither eat nor drink thereof.",
