Then they went their ways, nor was it long or ever Hamdir stumbled, and thrust down his hand to steady himself, and spake therewith--\n\n\"Naught but a true thing spake Erp, for now should I have fallen, had not hand been to steady me.\"\n\nA little after Sorli stumbled, but turned about on his feet, and so stood, and spake--\n\n\"Yea now had I fallen, but that I steadied myself with both feet.\"\n\nAnd they said they had done evilly with Erp their brother.\n\nBut on they fare till they come to the abode of King Jormunrek, and they went up to him and set on him forthwith, and Hamdir cut both hands from him and Sorli both feet. Then spake Hamdir--\n\n\"Off were the head if Erp were alive; our brother whom we slew on the way, and found out our deed too late.\" Even as the Song says,--\n\n\"Off were the head\n If Erp were alive yet,\n Our brother the bold,\n Whom we slew by the way,\n The well-famed in warfare.\"\n\nNow in this must they turn away from the words of their mother, whereas they had to deal with stones. For now men fell on them, and they defended themselves in good and manly wise, and were the scathe of many a man, nor would iron bite on them.\n\nBut there came thereto a certain man, old of aspect and one-eyed, [1] and he spake--\n\n\"No wise men are ye, whereas ye cannot bring these men to their end.\"\n\nThen the king said, \"Give us rede thereto, if thou canst.\"\n\nHe said, \"Smite them to the death with stones.\"\n\nIn such wise was it done, for the stones flew thick and fast from every side, and that was the end of their life-days.\n\nAnd now has come to an end the whole root and stem of the Giukings. [2]\n\nMAY THE GRIEF OF ALL MAIDENS\n\nFOR THIS TALE OF TROUBLE\n\nSO TOLD TO ITS ENDING.\n\n[1] Odin; he ends the tale as he began it.\n\n[2] \"And now,\" etc., inserted by translators from the prose Edda, the stanza at the end from the Whetting of Gudrun.",
