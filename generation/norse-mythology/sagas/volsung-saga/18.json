So when Grifir had told him all even as he would, he went back home; and a little after he and Regin met.\n\nThen said Regin, \"Go thou and slay Fafnir, even as thou hast given thy word.\"\n\nSigurd said, \"That work shall be wrought; but another is first to be done, the avenging of Sigmund the king and the other of my kinsmen who fell in that their last fight.\"\n\n[1] Called \"Gripir\" in the Edda.",
