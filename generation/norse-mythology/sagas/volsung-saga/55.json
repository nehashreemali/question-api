  "content": "There was a king hight Heidrik, and his daughter was called Borgny, and the name of her lover was Vilmund. Now she might nowise be made lighter of a child she travailed with, before Oddrun, Atil's sister, came to her,--she who had been the love of Gunnar, Giuki's son. But of their speech together has this been sung:\n\nI have hear tell\n In ancient tales\n How a may there came\n To Morna-land,\n Because no man\n On mould abiding\n For Heidrik's daughter\n Might win healing.\n All that heard Oddrun,\n Atil's sister,\n How that the damsel\n Had heavy sickness,\n So she led from stall\n Her bridled steed,\n And on the swart one\n Laid the saddle.\n She made her horse wend\n O'er smooth ways of earth,\n Until to a high-built\n Hall she came;\n Then the saddle she had\n From the hungry horse,\n And her ways wended\n In along the wide hall,\n And this word first\n Spake forth therewith:\n \"What is most famed,\n Afield in Hunland,\n Or what may be\n Blithest in Hunland?\"\n\n\"Here lieth Borgny,\n Borne down by trouble,\n Thy sweet friend, O Oddrun,\n See to her helping!\"\n\n\"Who of the lords\n Hath laid this grief on her,\n Why is the anguish\n Of Borgny so weary?\"\n\n\"He is hight Vilmund,\n Friend of hawk-bearers,\n He wrapped the damsel\n In the warm bed-gear\n Five winters long\n Without her father's wotting.\"\n No more than this\n They spake methinks;\n Kind sat she down\n By the damsel's knee;\n Mightily sand Oddrun,\n Sharp piercing songs\n By Borgny's side:\n Till a maid and a boy\n Might tread on the world's ways,\n Blithe babes and sweet\n Of Hogni's bane:\n Then the damsel forewearied\n The word took up,\n The first word of all\n That had won from her:\n \"So may help thee\n All helpful things,\n Fey and Freyia,\n And all the fair Gods,\n As thou hast thrust\n This torment from me!\"\n\n\"Yet no heart had I\n For thy helping,\n Since never wert thou\n Worthy of helping,\n But my word I held to,\n That of old was spoken\n When the high lords\n Dealt out the heritage,\n That every soul\n I would ever help.\"\n\n\"Right mad art thou, Oddrun,\n And reft of thy wits,\n Whereas thou speakest\n Hard words to me\n Thy fellow ever\n Upon the earth\n As of brothers twain,\n We had been born.\"\n\n\"Well I mind me yet,\n What thou saidst that evening,\n Whenas I bore forth\n Fair drink for Gunnar;\n Such a thing, saidst thou,\n Should fall out never,\n For any may\n Save for me alone.\"\n Mind had the damsel\n Of the weary day\n Whenas the high lords\n Dealt out the heritage,\n And she sat her down,\n The sorrowful woman,\n To tell of the bale,\n And the heavy trouble.\n \"Nourished was I\n In the hall of kings--\n Most folk were glad--\n 'Mid the council of great ones:\n In fair life lived I,\n And the wealth of my father\n For five winters only,\n While yet he had life.\n \"Such were the last words\n That ever he spake,\n The king forewearied,\n Ere his ways he went;\n For be bade folk give me\n The gold red-gleaming,\n And give me in Southlands\n To the son of Grimhild.\n \"But Brynhild he bade\n To the helm to betake her,\n And said that Death-chooser\n She should become;\n And that no better\n Might ever be born\n Into the world,\n If fate would not spoil it.\n \"Brynhild in bower\n Sewed at her broidery,\n Folk she had\n And fair lands about her;\n Earth lay a-sleeping,\n Slept the heavens aloft\n When Fafnir's-bane\n The burg first saw.\n \"Then was war waged\n With the Welsh-wrought sword\n And the burg all broken\n That Brynhild owned;\n Nor wore long space,\n E'en as well might be,\n Ere all those wiles\n Full well she knew.\n \"Hard and dreadful\n Was the vengeance she drew down,\n So that all we\n Have woe enow.\n Through all lands of the world\n Shall that story fare forth\n How she did her to death\n For the death of Sigurd.\n \"But therewithal Gunnar\n The gold-scatterer\n Did I fall to loving\n And should have loved him.\n Rings of red gold\n Would they give to Atli,\n Would give to my brother\n Things goodly and great.\n \"Yea, fifteen steads\n Would they give for me,\n And the load of Grani\n To have as a gift;\n But then spake Atli,\n That such was his will,\n Never gift to take\n From the sons of Giuki.\n \"But we in nowise\n Might love withstand,\n And mine head must I lay\n On my love, the ring-breaker;\n And many there were\n Among my kin,\n Who said that they\n Had seen us together.\n \"Then Atli said\n That I surely never\n Would fall to crime\n Or shameful folly:\n But now let no one\n For any other,\n That shame deny\n Where love has dealing.\n \"For Atli sent\n His serving-folk\n Wide through the murkwood\n Proof to win of me,\n And thither they came\n Where they ne'er should have come,\n Where one bed we twain\n Had dight betwixt us.\n \"To those men had we given\n Rings of red gold,\n Naught to tell\n Thereof to Atli,\n But straight they hastened\n Home to the house,\n And all the tale\n To Atli told.\n 'Whereas from Gudrun\n Well they hid it,\n Though better by half\n Had she have known it.\n\n\"Din was there to hear\n Of the hoofs gold-shod,\n When into the garth\n Rode the sons of Giuki.\n \"There from Hogni\n The heart they cut,\n But into the worm-close\n Cast the other.\n There the king, the wise-hearted,\n Swept his harp-strings,\n For the might king\n Had ever mind\n That I to his helping\n Soon should come.\n \"But now was I gone\n Yet once again\n Unto Geirmund,\n Good feast to make;\n Yet had I hearing,\n E'en out from Hlesey,\n How of sore trouble\n The harp-strings sang.\n \"So I bade the bondmaids\n Be ready swiftly,\n For I listed to save\n The life of the king,\n And we let our ship\n Swim over the sound,\n Till Atli's dwelling\n We saw all clearly.\n Then came the wretch [1]\n Crawling out,\n E'en Atli's mother,\n All sorrow upon her!\n A grave gat her sting\n In the heart of Gunnar,\n So that no helping\n Was left for my hero.\n \"O gold-clad woman,\n Full oft I wonder\n How I my life\n Still hold thereafter,\n For methought I loved\n That light in battle,\n The swift with the sword,\n As my very self.\n \"Thou hast sat and hearkened\n As I have told thee\n Of many an ill-fate,\n Mine and theirs--\n Each man liveth\n E'en as he may live--\n Now hath gone forth\n The greeting of Oddrun.\"\n\n[1] Atli's mother took the form of the only adder that was not lulled to sleep by Gunnar's harp-playing, and who slew him.",
