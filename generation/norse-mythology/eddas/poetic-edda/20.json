  "content": "As the general nature of the Helgi tradition has been considered in the introductory note to Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar, it is necessary here to discuss only the characteristics of this particular poem. The second Helgi Hundingsbane lay is in most respects the exact opposite of the first one: it is in no sense consecutive; it is not a narrative poem, and all or most of it gives evidence of relatively early composition, its origin probably going well back into the tenth century.\n\nIt is frankly nothing but a piece of, in the main, very clumsy patchwork, made up of eight distinct fragments, pieced together awkwardly by the annotator with copious prose notes. One of these fragments (stanzas 13-16) is specifically identified as coming from \"the old Volsung lay.\" What was that poem, and how much more of the extant Helgi-lay compilation was taken from it, and did the annotator know more of it than he included in his patchwork? Conclusive answers to these questions have baffled scholarship, and probably always will do so. My own guess is that the annotator knew little or nothing more than he wrote down; having got the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay, which was obviously in fairly good shape, out of the way, he proceeded to assemble all the odds and ends of verse about Helgi which he could get hold of, putting them together on the basis of the narrative told in the first Helgi lay and of such stories as his knowledge of prose sagas may have yielded.\n\nSection I (stanzas 1-4) deals with an early adventure of Helgi's, -in which he narrowly escapes capture when he ventures into Hunding's home in disguise. Section II (stanzas 5-12) is a dialogue between Helgi and Sigrun at their first meeting. Section III (stanzas 13-16, the \"old Volsung lay\" group) is another dialogue between Helgi and Sigrun when she invokes his aid to save her from Hothbrodd. Section IV (stanzas 17-20, which may well be from the same poem as Section III, is made up of speeches by Helgi and Sigrun after the battle in which Hothbrodd is killed; stanza 21, however, is certainly an interpolation from another poem, as it is in a different meter. Section V (stanzas 22-27) is the dispute between Sinfjotli and Gothmund, evidently\n\nin an older form than the one included in the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay. Section VI (stanzas 28-37) gives Dag's speech to his sister, Sigrun, telling of Helgi's death, her curse on her brother and her lament for her slain husband. Section VII (stanza 38) is the remnant of a dispute between Helgi and Hunding, here inserted absurdly out of place. Section VIII (stanzas 39-50) deals with the return of the dead Helgi and Sigrun's visit to him in the burial hill.\n\nSijmons maintains that sections I and II are fragments of the Kara lay mentioned by the annotator in his concluding prose note, and that sections IV, VI, and VIII are from a lost Helgi-Sigrun poem, while Section III comes, of course, from the \"old Volsung lay.\" This seems as good a guess as any other, conclusive proof being quite out of the question.\n\nWere it not for sections, VI and VIII the poem would be little more than a battle-ground for scholars, but those two sections are in many ways as fine as anything in Old Norse poetry. Sigrun's curse of her brother for the slaying of Helgi and her lament for her dead husband, and the extraordinary vividness of the final scene in the burial hill, have a quality which fully offsets the baffling confusion of the rest of the poem.\n\nKing Sigmund, the son of Volsung, had as wife Borghild, from Bralund. They named their son Helgi, after Helgi Hjorvarthsson; Hagal was Helgi's foster-father. Hunding was the name of a powerful king, and Hundland is named from him. He was a mighty warrior, and had many sons with him on his campaigns. There was enmity and strife between these two, King Hunding and\n\nKing Sigmund, and each slew the other's kinsmen. King Sigmund and his family were called Volsungs and Ylfings. Helgi went as a spy to the home of King Hunding in disguise. Hæming, a son of King Hunding's, was at home. When Helgi went forth, then he met a young herdsman, and said:\n\n1. \"Say to Hæming | that Helgi knows Whom the heroes | in armor hid; A gray wolf had they | within their hall, Whom King Hunding | Hamal thought.\"\n\nHamal was the name of Hagal's son. King Hunding\n\nsent men to Hagal to seek Helgi, and Helgi could not save himself in any other way, so he put on the clothes of a bond-woman and set to work at the mill. They sought Helgi but found him not.\n\n2. Then Blind spake out, | the evil-minded: \" Of Hagal's bond-woman | bright are the eyes; Yon comes not of churls | who stands at the quern; The millstones break, | the boards are shattered.\n\n3. \"The hero has | a doom full hard, That barley now | he needs must grind; Better befits | his hand to feel The hilt of the sword | than the millstone's handle.\"\n\nHagal answered and said:\n\n4. \"Small is the wonder | if boards are splintered By a monarch's daughter | the mill is turned;\n\nOnce through clouds | she was wont to ride, And battles fought | like fighting men, (Till Helgi a captive | held her fast; Sister she is | of Sigar and Hogni, Thus bright are the eyes | of the Ylfings' maid.)\"\n\nHelgi escaped and went to a fighting ship. He slew King Hunding, and thenceforth was called Helgi Hundingsbane.\n\nHe lay with his host in Brunavagar, and they had there a strand-slaughtering, and ate the flesh raw. Hogni was the name of a king. His daughter was Sigrun; she was a Valkyrie and rode air and water; she was Svava reborn. Sigrun rode to Helgi's ship and said:\n\n5. \"Who rules the ship | by the shore so steep? Where is the home | ye warriors have? Why do ye bide | in Brunavagar, Or what the way | that ye wish to try?\"\n\nHelgi spake: 6 \"Hamal's the ship | by the shore so steep, Our home in Hlesey | do we have; For fair wind bide we | in Brunavagar, Eastward the way | that we wish to try.\"\n\nSigrun spake: 7. \"Where hast thou, warrior, | battle wakened, Or gorged the birds | of the sisters of Guth? Why is thy byrnie | spattered with blood, Why helmed dost feast | on food uncooked?\"\n\nHelgi spake: 8. \"Latest of all, | the Ylfings' son On the western sea, | if know thou wilt, Captured bears | in Bragalund, And fed the eagles | with edge of sword. Now is it shown | why our shirts are bloody, And little our food | with fire is cooked.\"\n\nSigrun spake: 9. \"Of battle thou tellest, | and there was bent Hunding the king | before Helgi down; There was carnage when thou | didst avenge thy kin, And blood flowed fast | on the blade of the sword.\"\n\nHelgi spake: 10. \"How didst thou know | that now our kin, Maiden wise, | we have well avenged? Many there are | of the sons of the mighty Who share alike | our lofty race.\"\n\nSigrun spake: 11. \"Not far was I | from the lord of the folk, Yester morn, | when the monarch was slain; Though crafty the son | of Sigmund, methinks, When he speaks of the fight | in slaughter-runes.\n\n12. \"On the long-ship once | I saw thee well, When in the blood-stained | bow thou wast,\n\n(And round thee icy | waves were raging;) Now would the hero | hide from me, But to Hogni's daughter | is Helgi known.\"\n\nGranmar was the name of a mighty king, who dwelt at Svarin's hill. He had many sons; one was named Hothbrodd, another Gothmund, a third Starkath. Hothbrodd was in a kings' meeting, and he won the promise of having Sigrun, Hogni's daughter, for his wife. But when she heard this, she rode with the Valkyries over air and sea to seek Helgi. Helgi was then at Logafjoll, and had fought with Hunding's sons; there he killed Alf and Eyolf, Hjorvarth and Hervarth. He was all weary with battle, and sat under the eagle-stone. There Sigrun found him, and ran to throw her arms about his neck, and kissed him, and told him her tidings, as is set forth in the old Volsung lay:\n\n13. Sigrun the joyful | chieftain sought, Forthwith Helgi's | hand she took;\n\nShe greeted the hero | helmed and kissed him, The warrior's heart | to the woman turned.\n\n14. From her heart the daughter | of Hogni spake, Dear was Helgi, | she said, to her; \"Long with all | my heart I loved Sigmund's son | ere ever I saw him.\n\n15. \"At the meeting to Hothbrodd | mated I was, But another hero | I fain would have; Though, king, the wrath | of my kin I fear, Since I broke my father's | fairest wish.\"\n\nHelgi spake: 16. \"Fear not ever | Hogni's anger, Nor yet thy kinsmen's | cruel wrath; Maiden, thou | with me shalt live, Thy kindred, fair one, | I shall not fear.\"\n\nHelgi then assembled a great sea-host and went to Frekastein. On the sea he met a perilous storm; lightning flashed overhead and the bolts struck the ship. They saw in the air that nine Valkyries were riding, and recognized Sigrun among them. Then the storm abated, and they came safe and sound to land. Granmar's sons sat on a certain mountain as the ships sailed toward the land. Gothmund leaped on a horse and rode for news to a promontory near the harbor; the Volsungs were even then lowering their sails. Then Gothmund said, as is written before in the Helgi lay:\n\n\"Who is the king | who captains the fleet, And to the land | the warriors leads?\"\n\nSinfjotli, Sigmund's son, answered him, and that too is written. Gothmund rode home with his tidings of the host;\n\nthen Granmar's sons summoned an army. Many kings came there; there were Hogni, Sigrun's father, and his sons Bragi and Dag. There was a great battle, and all Granmar's sons were slain and all their allies; only Dag, Hogni's son, was spared, and he swore loyalty to the Volsungs. Sigrun went among the dead and found Hothbrodd at the coming of death. She said:\n\n17. \"Never shall Sigrun | from Sevafjoll, Hothbrodd king, | be held in thine arms; Granmar's sons | full cold have grown, And the giant-steeds gray | on corpses gorge.\"\n\nThen she sought out Helgi, and was full of joy He said:\n\n18. \"Maid, not fair | is all thy fortune, The Norris I blame | that this should be; This morn there fell | at Frekastein Bragi and Hogni | beneath my hand.\n\n19. \"At Hlebjorg fell | the sons of Hrollaug, Starkath the king | at Styrkleifar;\n\nFighters more noble | saw I never, The body fought | when the head had fallen.\n\n20. \"On the ground full low | the slain are lying, Most are there | of the men of thy race; Nought hast thou won, | for thy fate it was Brave men to bring | to the battle-field.\"\n\nThen Sigrun wept. | Helgi said:\n\n21. \"Grieve not, Sigrun, | the battle is gained, The fighter can shun not his fate.\" Sigrun spake: \"To life would I call | them who slaughtered lie, If safe on thy breast I might be.\"\n\nThis Gothmund the son of Granmar spoke:\n\n22. \"What hero great | is guiding the ships? A golden flag | on the stem he flies; I find not peace in | the van of your faring, And round the fighters | is battle-light red.\"\n\nSinfjotli spake: 23. \"Here may Hothbrodd | Helgi find, The hater of flight, | in the midst of the fleet; The home of all | thy race he has, And over the realm | of the fishes he rules.\"\n\nGothmund spake: 24. \"First shall swords | at Frekastein Prove our worth | in place of words; Time is it, Hothbrodd, | vengeance to have, If in battle worsted | once we were.\"\n\nSinfjotli spake: 25. \"Better, Gothmund, | to tend the goats, And climb the rocks | of the mountain cliffs; A hazel switch | to hold in thy hand More seemly were | than the hilt of a sword.\"\n\nHelgi spake: 26. \"Better, Sinfjotli, | thee 'twould beseem Battles to give, | and eagles to gladden, Than vain and empty | speech to utter, Though warriors oft | with words do strive.\n\n27. \"Good I find not | the sons of Granmar, But for heroes 'tis seemly | the truth to speak; At Moinsheimar | proved the men That hearts for the wielding | of swords they had, (And ever brave | the warriors are.)\"\n\nHelgi took Sigrun to wife, and they had sons. Helgi did not reach old age. Dag, the son of Hogni, offered sacrifice to Othin to be avenged for his father's death; Othin gave Dag his spear. Dag found Helgi, his brother-in-law, at a place which is called Fjoturlund. He thrust the spear through Helgi's body. Then Helgi fell, and Dag rode to Sevafjoll and told Sigrun the tidings:\n\n28. \"Sad am I, sister, | sorrow to tell thee, Woe to my kin | unwilling I worked; In the morn there fell | at Fjoturlund The noblest prince | the world has known, (And his heel he set | on the heroes' necks.)\"\n\nSigrun spake: 29. \"Now may every | oath thee bite That with Helgi | sworn thou hast, By the water | bright of Leipt, And the ice-cold | stone of Uth.\n\n30. \"The ship shall sail not | in which thou sailest, Though a favoring wind | shall follow after; The horse shall run not | whereon thou ridest, Though fain thou art | thy foe to flee.\n\n31. .    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .     .    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    . \"The sword shall bite not | which thou bearest, Till thy head itself | it sings about.\n\n32. \"Vengeance were mine | for Helgi's murder, Wert thou a wolf | in the woods without, Possessing nought | and knowing no joy, Having no food | save corpses to feed on.\"\n\nDag spake: 33. \"Mad art thou, sister, | and wild of mind, Such a curse | on thy brother to cast; Othin is ruler | of every ill, Who sunders kin | with runes of spite.\n\n34. \"Thy brother rings | so red will give thee, All Vandilsve | and Vigdalir;\n\nTake half my land | to pay the harm, Ring-decked maid, | and as meed for thy sons.\"\n\nSigrun spake: 35. \"I shall sit not happy | at Sevafjoll, Early or late, | my life to love, If the light cannot show, | in the leader's band, Vigblær bearing him | back to his home, (The golden-bitted; | I shall greet him never.)\n\n36. \"Such the fear | that Helgi's foes Ever felt, | and all their kin, As makes the goats | with terror mad Run from the wolf | among the rocks.\n\n37. \"Helgi rose | above heroes all Like the lofty ash | above lowly thorns, Or the noble stag, | with dew besprinkled, Bearing his head | above all beasts, (And his horns gleam bright | to heaven itself.)\n\nA hill was made in Helgi's memory. And when he\n\ncame to Valhall, then Othin bade him rule over every thing with himself.\n\nHelgi said: A \"Thou shalt, Hunding, | of every hero Wash the feet, | and kindle the fire, Tie up dogs, | and tend the horses, And feed the swine | ere to sleep thou goest.\"\n\nOne of Sigrun's maidens went one evening to Helgi's hill, and saw that Helgi rode to the hill with many men, The maiden said:\n\n39. \"Is this a dream | that methinks I see, Or the doom of the gods, | that dead men ride,\n\nAnd hither spurring | urge your steeds, Or is home-coming now | to the heroes granted?\"\n\nHelgi spake: 40. \"No dream is this | that thou thinkest to see, Nor the end of the world, | though us thou beholdest, And hither spurring | we urge our steeds, Nor is home-coming now | to the heroes granted.\"\n\nThe maiden went home and said to Sigrun:\n\n41. \"Go forth, Sigrun, | from Sevafjoll, If fain the lord | of the folk wouldst find; (The hill is open, | Helgi is come;) The sword-tracks bleed; | the monarch bade That thou his wounds | shouldst now make well.\"\n\nSigrun went in the hill to Helgi, and said:\n\n42. \"Now am I glad | of our meeting together, As Othin's hawks, | so eager for prey, When slaughter and flesh | all warm they scent, Or dew-wet see | the red of day.\n\n43. \"First will I kiss | the lifeless king, Ere off the bloody | byrnie thou cast; With frost thy hair | is heavy, Helgi, And damp thou art | with the dew of death; (Ice-cold hands | has Hogni's kinsman, What, prince, can I | to bring thee ease?)\"\n\nHelgi spake: 44. \"Thou alone, Sigrun | of Sevafjoll, Art cause that Helgi | with dew is heavy; Gold-decked maid, | thy tears are grievous, (Sun-bright south-maid, | ere thou sleepest;) Each falls like blood | on the hero's breast, (Burned-out, cold, | and crushed with care.)\n\n45. \"Well shall we drink | a noble draught, Though love and lands | are lost to me; No man a song | of sorrow shall sing, Though bleeding wounds | are on my breast;\n\nNow in the hill | our brides we hold, The heroes' loves, | by their husbands dead.\"\n\nSigrun made ready a bed in the hill.\n\n46. \"Here a bed | I have made for thee, Helgi, To rest thee from care, | thou kin of the Ylfings; I will make thee sink | to sleep in my arms, As once I lay | with the living king.\"\n\nHelgi spake: 47. \"Now do I say | that in Sevafjoll Aught may happen, | early or late, Since thou sleepest clasped | in a corpse's arms, So fair in the hill, | the daughter of Hogni! (Living thou comest, | a daughter of kings.)\n\n48. \"Now must I ride | the reddened ways, And my bay steed set | to tread the sky; Westward I go | to wind-helm's bridges, Ere Salgofnir wakes | the warrior throng.\"\n\nThen Helgi and his followers rode on their way, and\n\nthe women went home to the dwelling. Another evening Sigrun bade the maiden keep watch at the hill. And at sunset when Sigrun came to the hill she said:\n\n49. \"Now were he come, | if come he might, Sigmund's son, | from Othin's seat; Hope grows dim | of the hero's return When eagles sit | on the ash-tree boughs, And men are seeking | the meeting of dreams.\"\n\nThe Maiden said: 50. \"Mad thou wouldst seem | alone to seek, Daughter of heroes, | the house of the dead; For mightier now | at night are all The ghosts of the dead | than when day is bright.\"\n\nSigrun was early dead of sorrow and grief. It was believed in olden times that people were born again, but that is now called old wives' folly. Of Helgi and Sigrun it is said that they were born again; he became Helgi Haddingjaskati, and she Kara the daughter of Halfdan, as is told in the Lay of Kara, and she was a Valkyrie.",
