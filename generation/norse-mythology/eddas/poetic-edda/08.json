  "content": "The Harbarthsljoth is found complete in the Codex Regius, where it follows the Skirnismol, and from the fourth line of stana 19 to the end of the poem in the Arnamagnæan Codex, of which it occupies the first page and a half.\n\nThe poem differs sharply from those which precede it in the Codex Regius, both in metrical form and in spirit. It is, indeed, the most nearly formless of all the Eddic poems. The normal metre is the Malahattr (cf. Introduction, where an example is given). The name of this verse-form means \"in the manner of conversation,\" and the Harbarthsljoth's verse fully justifies the term. The Atli poems exemplify the conventional use of Malahattr, but in the Harbarthsljoth the form is used with extraordinary freedom, and other metrical forms are frequently employed. A few of the speeches of which the poem is composed cannot be twisted into any known Old Norse metre, and appear to be simply prose.\n\nHow far this confusion is due to interpolations and faulty transmission of the original poem is uncertain. Finnur Jonsson has attempted a wholesale purification of the poem, but his arbitrary condemnation of words, lines, and entire stanzas as spurious is quite unjustified by any positive evidence. I have accepted Mogk's theory that the author was \"a first-rate psychologist, but a poor poet,\" and have translated the poem as it stands in the manuscripts. I have preserved the metrical confusion of the original by keeping throughout so far as possible to the metres found in the poem; if the rhythm of the translation is often hard to catch, the difficulty is no less with the original Norse.\n\nThe poem is simply a contest of abuse, such as the early Norwegian and Icelander delighted in, the opposing figures being Thor and Othin, the latter appearing in the disguise of the ferryman Harbarth. Such billingsgate lent itself readily to changes, interpolations and omissions, and it is little wonder that the poem is chaotic. It consists mainly of boasting and of references, often luckily obscure, to disreputable events in the life of one or the other of the disputants. Some editors have sought to read a complex symbolism into it, particularly by representing\n\nit as a contest between the noble or warrior class (Othin) and the peasant (Thor). But it seems a pity to take such a vigorous piece of broad farce too seriously.\n\nVerse-form, substance, and certain linguistic peculiarities, notably the suffixed articles, point to a relatively late date (eleventh century) for the poem in its present form. Probably it had its origin in the early days, but its colloquial nature and its vulgarity made it readily susceptible to changes.\n\nOwing to the chaotic state of the text, and the fact that none of the editors or commentators have succeeded in improving it much, I have not in this case attempted to give all the important emendations and suggestions. The stanza-divisions are largely arbitrary.\n\nThor was on his way back from a journey in the East, and came to a sound; on the other side of the sound was a ferryman with a boat. Thor called out:\n\n1. \"Who is the fellow yonder, | on the farther shore of the sound?\"\n\nThe ferryman spake: 2. \"What kind of a peasant is yon, | that calls o'er the bay?\"\n\nThor spake: 3. \"Ferry me over the sound; | I will feed thee therefor in the morning; A basket I have on my back, | and food therein, none better; At leisure I ate, | ere the house I left, Of herrings and porridge, | so plenty I had.\"\n\nThe ferryman spake: 4. \"Of thy morning feats art thou proud, | but the future thou knowest not wholly; Doleful thine home-coming is: | thy mother, me thinks, is dead.\"\n\nThor spake: 5. \"Now hast thou said | what to each must seem The mightiest grief, | that my mother is dead.\"\n\nThe ferryman spake: 6. \"Three good dwellings, | methinks, thou hast not; Barefoot thou standest, | and wearest a beggar's dress; Not even hose dost thou have.\"\n\nThor spake: 7. \"Steer thou hither the boat; | the landing here shall I show thee; But whose the craft | that thou keepest on the shore?\"\n\nThe ferryman spake: 8. \"Hildolf is he | who bade me have it, A hero wise; | his home is at Rathsey's sound. He bade me no robbers to steer, | nor stealers of steeds, But worthy men, | and those whom well do I know. Say now thy name, | if over the sound thou wilt fare.\"\n\nThor spake: 9. \"My name indeed shall I tell, | though in danger I am,\n\nAnd all my race; | I am Othin's son, Meili's brother, | and Magni's father, The strong one of the gods; | with Thor now speech canst thou get. And now would I know | what name thou hast.\"\n\nThe ferryman spake: 10. \"Harbarth am I, | and seldom I hide my name.\"\n\nThor spake: 11. \"Why shouldst thou hide thy name, | if quarrel thou hast not?\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 12. \"And though I had a quarrel, | from such as thou art Yet none the less | my life would I guard, Unless I be doomed to die.\"\n\nThor spake: 13. \"Great trouble, methinks, | would it be to come to thee, To wade the waters across, | and wet my middle; Weakling, well shall I pay | thy mocking words, if across the sound I come.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 14. \"Here shall I stand | and await thee here; Thou hast found since Hrungnir died | no fiercer man.\"\n\nThor spake: 15. \"Fain art thou to tell | how with Hrungnir I fought, The haughty giant, | whose head of stone was made; And yet I felled him, | and stretched him before me. What, Harbarth, didst thou the while?\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 16. \"Five full winters | with Fjolvar was I, And dwelt in the isle | that is Algrön called; There could we fight, | and fell the slain, Much could we seek, | and maids could master.\"\n\nThor spake: 17. \"How won ye success with your women?\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 18. \"Lively women we had, | if they wise for us were; Wise were the women we had, | if they kind for us were; For ropes of sand | they would seek to wind, And the bottom to dig | from the deepest dale. Wiser than all | in counsel I was, And there I slept | by the sisters seven, And joy full great | did I get from each. What, Thor, didst thou the while?\"\n\nThor spake: 19. \"Thjazi I felled, | the giant fierce, And I hurled the eyes | of Alvaldi's son To the heavens hot above; Of my deeds the mightiest | marks are these, That all men since can see. What, Harbarth, didst thou the while?\"\n\nHarbarth spoke: 20. \"Much love-craft I wrought | with them who ride by night, When I stole them by stealth from their husbands; A giant hard | was Hlebarth, methinks: His wand he gave me as gift, And I stole his wits away.\"\n\nThor spake: 21. \"Thou didst repay good gifts with evil mind.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 22. \"The oak must have | what it shaves from another; In such things each for himself. What, Thor, didst thou the while?\"\n\nThor spake: 23. \"Eastward I fared, | of the giants I felled Their ill-working women | who went to the mountain; And large were the giants' throng | if all were alive; No men would there be | in Mithgarth more. What, Harbarth, didst thou the while?\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 24. \"In Valland I was, | and wars I raised, Princes I angered, | and peace brought never; The noble who fall | in the fight hath Othin, And Thor hath the race of the thralls.\"\n\nThor spake: 25. \"Unequal gifts | of men wouldst thou give to the gods, If might too much thou shouldst have.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 26. \"Thor has might enough, | but never a heart; For cowardly fear | in a glove wast thou fain to crawl, And there forgot thou wast Thor; Afraid there thou wast, | thy fear was such, To fart or sneeze | lest Fjalar should hear.\"\n\nThor spake: 27. \"Thou womanish Harbarth, | to hell would I smite thee straight, Could mine arm reach over the sound.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 28. \"Wherefore reach over the sound, | since strife we have none? What, Thor, didst thou do then?\"\n\nThor spake: 29. \"Eastward I was, | and the river I guarded well, Where the sons of Svarang | sought me there; Stones did they hurl; | small joy did they have of winning; Before me there | to ask for peace did they fare. What, Harbarth, didst thou the while?\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 30. \"Eastward I was, | and spake with a certain one, I played with the linen-white maid, | and met her by stealth; I gladdened the gold-decked one, | and she granted me joy.\"\n\nThor spake: 31. \"Full fair was thy woman-finding.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 32. \"Thy help did I need then, Thor, | to hold the white maid fast.\"\n\nThor spake: 33. \"Gladly, had I been there, | my help to thee had been given.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 34. \"I might have trusted thee then, | didst thou not betray thy troth.\"\n\nThor spake: 35. \"No heel-biter am I, in truth, | like an old leather shoe in spring.\"\n\nHarbarth spoke: 36. \"What, Thor, didst thou the while?\"\n\nThor spake: 37. \"In Hlesey the brides | of the Berserkers slew I; Most evil they were, | and all they betrayed.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 38, \"Shame didst thou win, | that women thou slewest, Thor.\"\n\nThor spake: 39. \"She-wolves they were like, | and women but little; My ship, which well | I had trimmed, did they shake; With clubs of iron they threatened, | and Thjalfi they drove off. What, Harbarth, didst thou the while?\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 40. \"In the host I was | that hither fared, The banners to raise, | and the spear to redden.\"\n\nThor spake: 41. \"Wilt thou now say | that hatred thou soughtest to bring us?\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 42. \"A ring for thy hand | shall make all right for thee, As the judge decides | who sets us two at peace.\"\n\nThor spake: 43. \"Where foundest thou | so foul and scornful a speech? More foul a speech | I never before have heard.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 44. \"I learned it from men, | the men so old, Who dwell in the hills of home.\"\n\nThor spake: 45. \"A name full good | to heaps of stones thou givest When thou callest them hills of home.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 46. \"Of such things speak I so.\"\n\nThor spake: 47. \"Ill for thee comes | thy keenness of tongue, If the water I choose to wade; Louder, I ween, | than a wolf thou cryest, If a blow of my hammer thou hast.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 48. \"Sif has a lover at home, | and him shouldst thou meet; More fitting it were | on him to put forth thy strength.\"\n\nThor spake: 49. \"Thy tongue still makes thee say | what seems most ill to me, Thou witless man! Thou liest, I ween.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 50. \"Truth do I speak, | but slow on thy way thou art; Far hadst thou gone | if now in the boat thou hadst fared.\"\n\nThor spake: 51. \"Thou womanish Harbarth! | here hast thou held me too long.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 52. \"I thought not ever | that Asathor would be hindered By a ferryman thus from faring.\"\n\nThor spake: 53. \"One counsel I bring thee now: | row hither thy boat; No more of scoffing; | set Magni's father across.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 54. \"From the sound go hence; | the passage thou hast not.\"\n\nThor spake: 55. \"The way now show me, since thou takest me not o'er the water.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 56. \"To refuse it is little, to fare it is long; A while to the stock, and a while to the stone; Then the road to thy left, till Verland thou reachest; And there shall Fjorgyn her son Thor find, And the road of her children she shows him to Othin's realm.\"\n\nThor spake: 57. \"May I come so far in a day?\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 58. \"With toil and trouble perchance, While the sun still shines, or so I think.\"\n\nThor spake: 59. \"Short now shall be our speech, for thou speakest in mockery only;\n\nThe passage thou gavest me not I shall pay thee if ever we meet.\"\n\nHarbarth spake: 60. \"Get hence where every evil thing shall have thee!\"",
