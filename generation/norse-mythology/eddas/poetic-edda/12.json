  "content": "No better summary of the Alvissmol can be given than Gering's statement that \"it is a versified chapter from the skaldic Poetics.\" The narrative skeleton, contained solely in stanzas 1-8 and in 35, is of the slightest; the dwarf Alvis, desirous of marrying Thor's daughter, is compelled by the god to answer a number of questions to test his knowledge. That all his answers are quite satisfactory makes no difference whatever to the outcome. The questions and answers differ radically from those of the Vafthruthnismol. Instead of being essentially mythological, they all concern synonyms. Thor asks what the earth, the sky, the moon, and so on, are called \" in each of all the worlds,\" but there is no apparent significance in the f act that the gods call the earth one thing and the giants call it another; the answers are simply strings of poetic circumlocutions, or \"kennings.\" Concerning the use of these \"kennings\" in skaldic poetry, cf. introductory note to the Hymiskvitha.\n\nMogk is presumably right in dating the poem as late as the twelfth century, assigning it to the period of \"the Icelandic renaissance of skaldic poetry.\" It appears to have been the work of a man skilled in poetic construction,--Thor's questions, for instance, are neatly balanced in pairs,--and fully familiar with the intricacies of skaldic diction, but distinctly weak in his mythology. In other words, it is learned rather than spontaneous poetry. Finnur Jonsson's attempt to make it a tenth century Norwegian poem baffles logic. Vigfusson is pretty sure the poem shows marked traces of Celtic influence, which is by no means incompatible with Mogk's theory (cf. introductory note to the Rigsthula).\n\nThe poem is found only in Regius, where it follows the Thrymskvitha. Snorri quotes stanzas 2c, and 30, the manuscripts of the Prose Edda giving the name of the poem as Alvissmol, Alsvinnsmol or Olvismol. It is apparently in excellent condition, without serious errors of transmission, although interpolations or omissions in such a poem might have been made so easily as to defy detection.\n\nThe translation of the many synonyms presents, of course,\n\nunusual difficulties, particularly as many of the Norse words can be properly rendered in English only by more or less extended phrases. I have kept to the original meanings as closely as I could without utterly destroying the metrical structure.\n\nAlvis spake: 1. \"Now shall the bride | my benches adorn, And homeward haste forthwith; Eager for wedlock | to all shall I seem, Nor at home shall they rob me of rest.\"\n\nThor spake: 2. \"What, pray, art thou? | Why so pale round the nose? By the dead hast thou lain of late? To a giant like | dost thou look, methinks; Thou wast not born for the bride.\"\n\nAlvis spake: 3. \"Alvis am I, | and under the earth My home 'neath the rocks I have;\n\nWith the wagon-guider | a word do I seek, Let the gods their bond not break.\"\n\nThor spake: 4. \"Break it shall I, | for over the bride Her father has foremost right; At home was I not | when the promise thou hadst, And I give her alone of the gods.\"\n\nAlvis spake: 5. \"What hero claims | such right to hold O'er the bride that shines so bright? Not many will know thee, | thou wandering man! Who was bought with rings to bear thee?\"\n\nThor spake: 6. \"Vingthor, the wanderer | wide, am I, And I am Sithgrani's son; Against my will | shalt thou get the maid, And win the marriage word.\"\n\nAlvis spake: 7. \"Thy good-will now | shall I quickly get, And win the marriage word; I long to have, | and I would not lack, This snow-white maid for mine.\"\n\nThor spake: 8. \"The love of the maid | I may not keep thee From winning, thou guest so wise, If of every world | thou canst tell me all That now I wish to know.\n\n9. \"Answer me, Alvis! | thou knowest all, Dwarf, of the doom of men: What call they the earth, | that lies before all, In each and every world?\"\n\nAlvis spake: 10. \" 'Earth' to men, 'Field' | to the gods it is, 'The Ways' is it called by the Wanes;\n\n'Ever Green' by the giants, | 'The Grower' by elves, 'The Moist' by the holy ones high.\"\n\nThor spake: 11. \"Answer me, Alvis! | thou knowest all, Dwarf, of the doom of men: What call they the heaven, | beheld of the high one, In each and every world?\"\n\nAlvis spake: 12. \" 'Heaven' men call it, | 'The Height' the gods, The Wanes 'The Weaver of Winds'; Giants 'The Up-World,' | elves 'The Fair-Roof,' The dwarfs 'The Dripping Hall.'\"\n\nThor spake: 13. \"Answer me, Alvis! | thou knowest all, Dwarf, of the doom of men.: What call they the moon, | that men behold, In each and every world?\"\n\nAlvis spake: 14. \"'Moon' with men, 'Flame' | the gods among, 'The Wheel' in the house of hell; 'The Goer' the giants, | 'The Gleamer' the dwarfs, The elves 'The Teller of Time.\"\n\nThor spake: 15. \"Answer me, Alvis! | thou knowest all, Dwarf, of the doom of men: What call they the sun, | that all men see, In each and every world?\"\n\nAlvis spake: 16. \"Men call it 'Sun,' | gods 'Orb of the Sun,' 'The Deceiver of Dvalin' the dwarfs; The giants 'The Ever-Bright,' | elves 'Fair Wheel,' 'All-Glowing' the sons of the gods.\"\n\nThor spake: 17. \"Answer me, Alvis! | thou knowest all, Dwarf, of the doom of men: What call they the clouds, | that keep the rains, In each and every world?\"\n\nAlvis spake: 18. \"'Clouds' men name them, | 'Rain-Hope' gods call them, The Wanes call them 'Kites of the Wind'; 'Water-Hope' giants, | 'Weather-Might' elves, 'The Helmet of Secrets' in hell.\"\n\nThor spake: 19. \"Answer me, Alvis! | thou knowest all, Dwarf, of the doom of men: What call they the wind, | that widest fares, In each and every world?\"\n\nAlvis spake: 20. \"'Wind' do men call it, | the gods 'The Waverer,' 'The Neigher' the holy ones high;\n\n'The Wailer' the giants, | 'Roaring Wender' the elves, In hell 'The Blustering Blast.'\n\nThor spake: 21. \"Answer me, Alvis! | thou knowest all Dwarf, of the doom of men: What call they the calm, | that quiet lies, In each and every world?\"\n\nAlvis spake: 22. \" 'Calm' men call it, | 'The Quiet' the gods, The Wanes 'The Hush of the Winds'; 'The Sultry' the giants, | elves 'Day's Stillness,' The dwarfs 'The Shelter of Day.'\n\nThor spake: 23. \"Answer me, Alvis! | thou knowest all, Dwarf, of the doom of men: What call they the sea, | whereon men sail, In each and every world?\"\n\nAlvis spake: 24. \" 'Sea' men call it, | gods 'The Smooth-Lying,' 'The Wave' is it called by the Wanes;\n\n'Eel-Home' the giants, | 'Drink-Stuff' the elves, For the dwarfs its name is 'The Deep.'\n\nThor spake: 25. \"Answer me, Alvis! | thou knowest all, Dwarf, of the doom of men: What call they the fire, | that flames for men, In each of all the worlds?\"\n\nAlvis spake: 26. \" 'Fire' men call it, | and 'Flame' the gods, By the Wanes is it 'Wildfire' called; 'The Biter' by giants, | 'The Burner' by dwarfs, 'The Swift' in the house of hell.\"\n\nThor spake: 27. \"Answer me, Alvis!
