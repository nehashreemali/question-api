  "content": "The two poems, Grougaldr (Groa's Spell) and Fjolsvinnsmol (the Ballad of Fjolsvith), which many editors have, very wisely, united under the single title of Svipdagsmol, are found only in paper manuscripts, none of them antedating the seventeenth century. Everything points to a relatively late origin for the poems: their extensive use of \"kennings\" or poetical circumlocutions, their romantic spirit, quite foreign to the character of the unquestionably older poems, the absence of any reference to them in the earlier documents, the frequent errors in mythology, and, finally, the fact that the poems appear to have been preserved in unusually good condition. Whether or not a connecting link of narrative verse joining the two parts has been lost is an open question; on the whole it seems likely that the story was sufficiently well known so that the reciter of the poem (or poems) merely filled in the gap with a brief prose summary in pretty much his own words. The general relationship between dialogue and narrative in the Eddic poems is discussed in the introductory note to the Grimnismol, in connection with the use of prose links.\n\nThe love story of Svipdag and Mengloth is not referred to elsewhere in the Poetic Edda, nor does Snorri mention it; however, Groa, who here appears as Svipdag's mother, is spoken of by Snorri as a wise woman, the wife of Orvandil, who helps Thor with her magic charms. On the other hand, the essence of the story, the hero's winning of a bride ringed about by flames, is strongly suggestive of parts of the Sigurth-Brynhild traditions. Whether or not it is to be regarded as a nature or solar myth depends entirely on one's view of the whole \"solar myth\" school of criticism, not so highly esteemed today as formerly; such an interpretation is certainly not necessary to explain what is, under any circumstances, a very charming romance told, in the main, with dramatic effectiveness.\n\nIn later years the story of Svipdag and Mengloth became popular throughout the North, and was made the subject of many Danish and Swedish as well as Norwegian ballads. These have greatly assisted in the reconstruction of the outlines of the narrative surrounding the dialogue poems here given.\n\nSvipdag spake: 1. \"Wake thee, Groa! | wake, mother good! At the doors of the dead I call thee; Thy son, bethink thee, | thou badst to seek Thy help at the hill of death.\"\n\nGroa spake: 2. \"What evil vexes | mine only son, What baleful fate hast thou found, That thou callest thy mother, | who lies in the mould, And the world of the living has left?\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 3. \"The woman false | whom my father embraced Has brought me a baleful game; For she bade me go forth | where none may fare, And Mengloth the maid to seek.\"\n\nGroa spake: 4. \"Long is the way, | long must thou wander, But long is love as well; Thou mayst find, perchance, | what thou fain wouldst have, If the fates their favor will give.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 5. \"Charms full good | then chant to me, mother, And seek thy son to guard; For death do I fear | on the way I shall fare, And in years am I young, methinks.\"\n\nGroa spake: 6. \"Then first I will chant thee | the charm oft-tried, That Rani taught to Rind; From the shoulder whate'er | mislikes thee shake, For helper thyself shalt thou have.\n\n7. \"Then next I will chant thee, | if needs thou must travel, And wander a purposeless way: The bolts of Urth | shall on every side Be thy guards on the road thou goest.\n\n8. \"Then third I will chant thee, | if threatening streams The danger of death shall bring:\n\nYet to Hel shall turn | both Horn and Ruth, And before thee the waters shall fail.\n\n9. \"Then fourth I will chant thee, | if come thy foes On the gallows-way against thee: Into thine hands | shall their hearts be given, And peace shall the warriors wish.\n\n10. \"Then fifth I will chant thee, | if fetters perchance Shall bind thy bending limbs: O'er thy thighs do I chant | a loosening-charm, And the lock is burst from the limbs, And the fetters fall from the feet.\n\n11. \"Then sixth I will chant thee, | if storms on the sea Have might unknown to man: Yet never shall wind | or wave do harm, And calm is the course of thy boat.\n\n12. \"Then seventh I chant thee, | if frost shall seek To kill thee on lofty crags: The fatal cold | shall not grip thy flesh, And whole thy body shall be.\n\n13. \"Then eighth will I chant thee, | if ever by night Thou shalt wander on murky ways: Yet never the curse | of a Christian woman From the dead shall do thee harm.\n\n14. \"Then ninth will I chant thee, | if needs thou must strive With a warlike giant in words: Thy heart good store | of wit shall have, And thy mouth of words full wise.\n\n15. \"Now fare on the way | where danger waits, Let evils not lessen thy love! I have stood at the door | of the earth-fixed stones, The while I chanted thee charms.\n\n16. \"Bear hence, my son, | what thy mother hath said, And let it live in thy breast; Thine ever shall be the | best of fortune, So long as my words shall last.\"\n\n17. Before the house | he beheld one coming To the home of the giants high.\n\nSvipdag spake: \"What giant is here, | in front of the house, And around him fires are flaming?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 3. \"What seekest thou here? | for what is thy search? What, friendless one, fain wouldst thou know? By the ways so wet | must thou wander hence, For, weakling, no home hast thou here.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 19. \"What giant is here, | in front of the house, To the wayfarer welcome denying?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: \"Greeting full fair | thou never shalt find, So hence shalt thou get thee home.\n\n20. \"Fjolsvith am I, | and wise am I found, But miserly am I with meat; Thou never shalt enter | within the house,-- Go forth like a wolf on thy way!\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 21. \"Few from the joy | of their eyes will go forth, When the sight of their loves they seek; Full bright are the gates | of the golden hall, And a home shall I here enjoy.\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 22. \"Tell me now, fellow, | what father thou hast, And the kindred of whom thou camst.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: \"Vindkald am I, | and Varkald's son, And Fjolkald his father was.\n\n23. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know:\n\nWho is it that holds | and has for his own The rule of the hall so rich?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 224. \"Mengloth is she, | her mother bore her To the son of Svafrthorin; She is it that holds | and has for her own The rule of the hall so rich.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 25. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know: What call they the gate? | for among the gods Ne'er saw man so grim a sight.\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 26. \"Thrymgjol they call it; | 'twas made by the three, The sons of Solblindi; And fast as a fetter | the farer it holds, Whoever shall lift the latch.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 27. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know:\n\nWhat call they the house? | for no man beheld 'Mongst the gods so grim a sight.\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 28. \"Gastropnir is it, | of old I made it From the limbs of Leirbrimir; I braced it so strongly | that fast it shall stand So long as the world shall last.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 29. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know: What call they the tree | that casts abroad Its limbs o'er every land?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 30. \"Mimameith its name, | and no man knows What root beneath it runs; And few can guess | what shall fell the tree, For fire nor iron shall fell it.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 31. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know:\n\nWhat grows from the seed | of the tree so great, That fire nor iron shall fell?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 32. \"Women, sick | with child, shall seek Its fruit to the flames to bear; Then out shall come | what within was hid, And so is it mighty with men.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 33. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know: What cock is he | on the highest bough, That glitters all with gold?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 34. \"Vithofnir his name, | and now he shines Like lightning on Mimameith's limbs; And great is the trouble | with which he grieves Both Surt and Sinmora.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 35. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know: What call they the hounds, | that before the house So fierce and angry are?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 36. \"Gif call they one, | and Geri the other, If now the truth thou wouldst know; Great they are, | and their might will grow, Till the gods to death are doomed.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 37. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know: May no man hope | the house to enter, While the hungry hounds are sleeping?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 38. \"Together they sleep not, | for so was it fixed When the guard to them was given; One sleeps by night, | the next by day, So no man may enter ever.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 39, \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know:\n\nIs there no meat | that men may give them, And leap within while they eat?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 40. \"Two wing-joints there be | in Vithofnir's body, If now the truth thou wouldst know; That alone is the meat | that men may give them, And leap within while they eat.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 41. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know: What weapon can send | Vithofnir to seek The house of Hel below?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 42. \"Lævatein is there, | that Lopt with runes Once made by the doors of death; In Lægjarn's chest | by Sinmora lies it, And nine locks fasten it firm.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 43. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know: May a man come thence, | who thither goes, And tries the sword to take?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 44. \"Thence may he come | who thither goes, And tries the sword to take, If with him he carries | what few can win, To give to the goddess of gold.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 45. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know: What treasure is there | that men may take To rejoice the giantess pale?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 46. \"The sickle bright | in thy wallet bear, Mid Vithofnir's feathers found; To Sinmora give it, | and then shall she grant That the weapon by thee be won.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 47. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know: What call they the hall, | encompassed here With flickering magic flames?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 48. \"Lyr is it called, | and long it shall On the tip of a spear-point tremble; Of the noble house | mankind has heard, But more has it never known.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 49. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know: What one of the gods | has made so great The hall I behold within?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 50. \"Uni and Iri, | Bari and Jari, Var and Vegdrasil, Dori and Ori, | Delling, and there Was Loki, the fear of the folk.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 51. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know: What call they the mountain | on which the maid Is lying so lovely to see?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 52. \"Lyfjaberg is it, | and long shall it be A joy to the sick and the sore; For well shall grow | each woman who climbs it, Though sick full long she has lain.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 53. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know: What maidens are they | that at Mengloth's knees Are sitting so gladly together?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 54. \"Hlif is one named, | Hlifthrasa another, Thjothvara call they the third;\n\nBjort and Bleik, | Blith and Frith, Eir and Aurbotha.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 55. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know: Aid bring they to all | who offerings give, If need be found therefor?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 56. \"Soon aid they all | who offerings give On the holy altars high; And if danger they see | for the sons of men, Then each from ill do they guard.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 57. \"Now answer me, Fjolsvith, | the question I ask, For now the truth would I know: Lives there the man | who in Mengloth's arms So fair may seek to sleep?\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 58. \"No man there is | who in Mengloth's arms So fair may seek to sleep, Save Svipdag alone, | for the sun-bright maid Is destined his bride to be.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 59. \"Fling back the gates! | make the gateway wide! Here mayst thou Svipdag see! Hence get thee to find | if gladness soon Mengloth to me will give.\"\n\nFjolsvith spake: 60. \"Hearken, Mengloth, | a man is come; Go thou the guest to see! The hounds are fawning, | the house bursts open,-- Svipdag, methinks, is there.\"\n\nMengloth spake: 61. \"On the gallows high | shall hungry ravens Soon thine eyes pluck out, If thou liest in saying | that here at last The hero is come to my hall.\n\n62. \"Whence camest thou hither? | how camest thou here? What name do thy kinsmen call thee? Thy race and thy name | as a sign must I know, That thy bride I am destined to be.\"\n\nSvipdag spake: 63. \"Svipdag am I, | and Solbjart's son; Thence came I by wind-cold ways;\n\nWith the words of Urth | shall no man war, Though unearned her gifts be given.\"\n\nMengloth spake: 64. \"Welcome thou art, | for long have I waited; The welcoming kiss shalt thou win! For two who love | is the longed-for meeting The greatest gladness of all.\n\n65. \"Long have I sat | on Lyfjaberg here, Awaiting thee day by day; And now I have | what I ever hoped, For here thou art come to my hall.\n\n66. \"Alike we yearned; | I longed for thee, And thou for my love hast longed; But now henceforth | together we know Our lives to the end we shall live.\"",
