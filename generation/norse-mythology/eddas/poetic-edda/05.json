  "content": "The Vafthruthnismol follows the Hovamol in the Codex Regius. From stanza 20 on it is also included in the Arnamagnæan Codex, the first part evidently having appeared on leaf now lost. Snorri quotes eight stanzas of it in the Prose Edda, and in his prose text closely paraphrases many others.\n\nThe poem is wholly in dialogue form except for a single narrative stanza (stanza 5). After a brief introductory discussion between Othin and his wife, Frigg, concerning the reputed wisdom of the giant Vafthruthnir, Othin, always in quest of wisdom, seeks out the giant, calling himself Gagnrath. The giant immediately insists that they shall demonstrate which is the wiser of the two, and propounds four questions (stanzas 11, 13, 15, and 17), each of which Othin answers. It is then the god's turn to ask, and he begins with a series of twelve numbered questions regarding the origins and past history of life. These Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin asks five more questions, this time referring to what is to follow the destruction of the gods, the last one asking the name of his own slayer. Again Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin finally propounds the unanswerable question: \"What spake Othin himself in the ears of his son, ere in the bale-fire he burned?\" Vafthruthnir, recognizing his questioner as Othin himself, admits his inferiority in wisdom, and so the contest ends.\n\nThe whole poem is essentially encyclopædic in character, and thus was particularly useful to Snorri in his preparation of the Prose Edda. The encyclopædic poem with a slight narrative outline seems to have been exceedingly popular; the Grimnismol and the much later Alvissmol represent different phases of the same type. The Vafthruthnismol and Grimnismol together, in deed, constitute a fairly complete dictionary of Norse mythology. There has been much discussion as to the probable date of the Vafthruthnismol, but it appears to belong to about the same period as the Voluspo: in other words, the middle of the tenth century. While there may be a few interpolated passages in the poem as we now have it, it is clearly a united whole, and evidently in relatively good condition.\n\nOthin spake: 1, \"Counsel me, Frigg, for I long to fare, And Vafthruthnir fain would find; fit wisdom old with the giant wise Myself would I seek to match.\"\n\nFrigg spake: 2. \"Heerfather here at home would I keep, Where the gods together dwell; Amid all the giants an equal in might To Vafthruthnir know I none.\"\n\nOthin spake: 3. \"Much have I fared, much have I found. Much have I got from the gods; And fain would I know how Vafthruthnir now Lives in his lofty hall.\"\n\nFrigg spake: 4. \"Safe mayst thou go, safe come again, And safe be the way thou wendest! Father of men, let thy mind be keen When speech with the giant thou seekest.\"\n\n5. The wisdom then of the giant wise\n\nForth did he fare to try; He found the hall | of the father of Im, And in forthwith went Ygg.\n\nOthin spake: 6. \"Vafthruthnir, hail! | to thy hall am I come, For thyself I fain would see; And first would I ask | if wise thou art, Or, giant, all wisdom hast won.\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 7. \"Who is the man | that speaks to me, Here in my lofty hall? Forth from our dwelling | thou never shalt fare, Unless wiser than I thou art.\"\n\nOthin spake: 8. \"Gagnrath they call me, | and thirsty I come From a journey hard to thy hall; Welcome I look for, | for long have I fared, And gentle greeting, giant.\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 9. \"Why standest thou there | on the floor whilst thou speakest? A seat shalt thou have in my hall;\n\nThen soon shall we know | whose knowledge is more, The guest's or the sage's gray.\"\n\nOthin spake: 10. \"If a poor man reaches | the home of the rich, Let him wisely speak or be still; For to him who speaks | with the hard of heart Will chattering ever work ill.\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 11. \"Speak forth now, Gagnrath, | if there from the floor Thou wouldst thy wisdom make known: What name has the steed | that each morn anew The day for mankind doth draw?\"\n\nOthin spake: 12. \"Skinfaxi is he, | the steed who for men The glittering day doth draw; The best of horses | to heroes he seems, And brightly his mane doth burn.\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 13. \"Speak forth now, Gagnrath, | if there from the floor\n\nThou wouldst thy wisdom make known: What name has the steed | that from East anew Brings night for the noble gods?\"\n\nOthin spake: 14. \"Hrimfaxi name they | the steed that anew Brings night for the noble gods; Each morning foam | from his bit there falls, And thence come the dews in the dales.\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 15. \"Speak forth now, Gagnrath, | if there from the floor Thou wouldst thy wisdom make known: What name has the river | that 'twixt the realms Of the gods and the giants goes?\"\n\nOthin spoke: 16. \"Ifing is the river | that 'twixt the realms Of the gods and the giants goes; For all time ever | open it flows, No ice on the river there is.\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 17. \"Speak forth now, Gagnrath, | if there from the floor\n\nThou wouldst thy wisdom make known: What name has the field | where in fight shall meet Surt and the gracious gods?\"\n\nOthin spake: 18. \"Vigrith is the field | where in fight shall meet Surt and the gracious gods; A hundred miles | each way does it measure. And so are its boundaries set.\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 19. \"Wise art thou, guest! | To my bench shalt thou go, In our seats let us speak together; Here in the hall | our heads, O guest, Shall we wager our wisdom upon.\"\n\nOthin spake: 20. \"First answer me well, | if thy wisdom avails, And thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now: In earliest time | whence came the earth, Or the sky, thou giant sage?\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 21. \"Out of Ymir's flesh | was fashioned the earth, And the mountains were made of his bones; The sky from the frost-cold | giant's skull, And the ocean out of his blood.\"\n\nOthin spake: 22. \"Next answer me well, | if thy wisdom avails, And thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now: Whence came the moon, | o'er the world of men That fares, and the flaming sun?\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 23. \"Mundilferi is he | who begat the moon, And fathered the flaming sun; The round of heaven | each day they run, To tell the time for men.\"\n\nOthin spake: 24. \"Third answer me well, | if wise thou art called, If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now: Whence came the day, | o'er mankind that fares, Or night with the narrowing moon?\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 25. \"The father of day | is Delling called, And the night was begotten by Nor; Full moon and old | by the gods were fashioned, To tell the time for men.\"\n\nOthin spake: 26. \"Fourth answer me well, | if wise thou art called, If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now: Whence did winter come, | or the summer warm, First with the gracious gods?\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 27. \"Vindsval he was | who was winter's father, And Svosuth summer begat;\" .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    . .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n\nOthin spake: 28. \"Fifth answer me well, | if wise thou art called, If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now: What giant first | was fashioned of old, And the eldest of Ymir's kin?\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 29. \"Winters unmeasured | ere earth was made Was the birth of Bergelmir; Thruthgelmir's son | was the giant strong, And Aurgelmir's grandson of old.\"\n\nOthin spake: 30. \"Sixth answer me well, | if wise thou art called, If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now: Whence did Aurgelmir come | with the giants' kin, Long since, thou giant sage?\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 31. \"Down from Elivagar | did venom drop, And waxed till a giant it was;\n\nAnd thence arose | our giants' race, And thus so fierce are we found.\"\n\nOthin spake: 32. \"Seventh answer me well, | if wise thou art called, If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now: How begat he children, | the giant grim, Who never a giantess knew?\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 33. \"They say 'neath the arms | of the giant of ice Grew man-child and maid together; And foot with foot | did the wise one fashion A son that six heads bore.\"\n\nOthin spake: 34. \"Eighth answer me well, | if wise thou art called, If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now: What farthest back | dost thou bear in mind? For wide is thy wisdom, giant!\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 35. \"Winters unmeasured | ere earth was made Was the birth of Bergelmir; This first knew I well, | when the giant wise In a boat of old was borne.\"\n\nOthin spake: 36. \"Ninth answer me well, | if wise thou art called If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now: Whence comes the wind | that fares o'er the waves Yet never itself is seen?\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 37. \"In an eagle's guise | at the end of heaven Hræsvelg sits, they say; And from his wings | does the wind come forth To move o'er the world of men.\"\n\nOthin spake: 38. \"Tenth answer me now, | if thou knowest all The fate that is fixed for the gods:\n\nWhence came up Njorth | to the kin of the gods,-- (Rich in temples | and shrines he rules,--) Though of gods he was never begot?\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 39. \"In the home of the Wanes | did the wise ones create him, And gave him as pledge to the gods; At the fall of the world | shall he fare once more Home to the Wanes so wise.\"\n\nOthin spake: 40. \"Eleventh answer me well, |  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

That forth o'er the sea shall fare?\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 49. \"O'er Mogthrasir's hill | shall the maidens pass, And three are their throngs that come; They all shall protect | the dwellers on earth, Though they come of the giants' kin.\"\n\nOthin spake: 50. \"Much have I fared, | much have I found, Much have I got of the gods: Who then shall rule | the realm of the gods, When the fires of Surt have sunk?\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 51. \"In the gods' home Vithar | and Vali shall dwell, When the fires of Surt have sunk; Mothi and Magni | shall Mjollnir have When Vingnir falls in fight.\"\n\nOthin spake: 52. \"Much have I fared, | much have I found, Much have I got of the gods:\n\nWhat shall bring the doom | of death to Othin, When the gods to destruction go?\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 53. \"The wolf shall fell | the father of men, And this shall Vithar avenge; The terrible jaws | shall he tear apart, And so the wolf shall he slay.\"\n\nOthin spake: 54. \"Much have I fared, | much have I found, Much have I got from the gods: What spake Othin himself | in the ears of his son, Ere in the bale-fire he burned?\"\n\nVafthruthnir spake: 55. \"No man can tell | what in olden time Thou spak'st in the ears of thy son; With fated mouth | the fall of the gods And mine olden tales have I told; With Othin in knowledge | now have I striven, And ever the wiser thou art.\"",
