  "content": "Star Wars: Visions is an animated anthology television series[2] of non-canonical[8] short films.[2] Its initial release comprised nine anime-inspired original short films from various Japanese animation studios that present a different cultural perspective of Star Wars.[2] The series premiered on the video streaming service Disney+ on September 22, 2021.[2] The novel Ronin ties into the short \"The Duel.\"[9] Each short film of Visions has a corresponding featurette called Star Wars: Visions Filmmaker Focus that details its making and goes behind the scenes.[10] On May 29, 2022, a second volume of Star Wars: Visions was announced, shifting focus for a showcase of animation studios from around the world.[11] It debuted on May 4, 2023.[5] On November 19, 2024, it was announced a third volume of Star Wars: Visions will release in 2025. Volume 3 is intended to return to the series' original focus on the anime genre, with four returning animation studios, along with five new ones.[12]\n\nPresenting all-new, creative takes on the galaxy far, far away, Star Wars: Visions will be a series of animated short films celebrating Star Wars through the lens of the world's best anime creators. The anthology collection will bring fantastic visions from several of the leading Japanese anime studios, offering a fresh and diverse cultural perspective to Star Wars.[4]\n\nSo as to ensure the storytellers had the most freedom possible in developing their Visions shorts,[8] Lucasfilm allowed the shorts to break from the pre-existing Star Wars timeline.[2] Matt Martin of the Lucasfilm Story Group clarified this means all shorts are non-canon. While shorts like \"Tatooine Rhapsody\" could theoretically fit within canon,[8] no source at this time has brought a Visions story into the canonical Star Wars timeline.\n\nThe episodes \"The Elder\", \"Lop & Ochō\", \"The Ninth Jedi\" and \"THE TWINS\" were adapted as a manga series published by Square Enix in Japan in the Big Gangan magazine from May 25, 2022[14] to August 25, 2022.[15] The episode \"T0-B1\" was adapted in the young readers book T0-B1: The Droid Who Became a Jedi published on September 20, 2022 by Golden Books[16] and \"I Am Your Mother\" and \"Aau's Song\" in the young readers graphic novel I Am Your Mother/Aau's Song published in the Screen Comix series on April 2, 2024.[17]\n\nThe world and story of \"The Duel\" and The Ronin have been expanded in multiple pieces of media. Ronin: A Visions Novel (Japanese:『浪人』), written by Emma Mieko Candon, was published by Del Rey on October 12, 2021[18][19] and two prequel one-shot comic books, written and illustrated by the episode's writer Takashi Okazaki, Visions 1 and Visions – Takashi Okazaki 1, were published by Marvel Comics on October 12, 2022[20] and March 20, 2024 respectively.[21]\n\nVisions – Peach Momoko 1, an original one-shot comic book written and illustrated by Peach Momoko was published by Marvel Comics in November 15, 2023.[22]\n\nAnother original manga, titled Star Wars: Visions: Tsukumo,[23] written by Eiichi Shimizu, illustrated by Tomohiro Shimoguchi, and published by Viz Media was also announced during the New York Comic Con on October 9, 2022.[24]",
