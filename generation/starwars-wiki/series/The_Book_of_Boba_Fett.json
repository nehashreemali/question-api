  "content": "Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett is a live-action television series that focuses on the character Boba Fett taking place after the events of the second season of The Mandalorian but before the events of the third season of The Mandalorian. Its first episode was released on December 29, 2021. It was first teased, with both its title and release window, in a post-credits sequence of the season two finale of The Mandalorian.\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett, a thrilling Star Wars adventure, finds legendary bounty hunter Boba Fett and mercenary Fennec Shand navigating the galaxy's underworld when they return to the sands of Tatooine to stake their claim on the territory once ruled by Jabba the Hutt and his crime syndicate.[9]\n\nBoba Fett made his live-action return to Star Wars in Star Wars: The Mandalorian's \"Chapter 14: The Tragedy,\" an episode directed by Robert Rodriguez. Series executive producer Jon Favreau originally approached Rodriguez to direct the important episode because he loved Rodriguez's interpretation of the character. He also decided to pitch to Rodriguez and the studio the idea of creating more episodes centering around the character. Although Rodriguez usually avoided franchises, that changed with Boba, as Rodriguez felt that he was an underdeveloped character and that it was as if he was an original character Rodriguez could expand.[13]\n\nReports of a Boba Fett–centered Disney+ miniseries first surfaced online in early November 2020. The reports also mentioned that the series' filming had begun.[14] On December 10, 2020, Kathleen Kennedy teased that the \"next chapter\" of Star Wars: The Mandalorian would arrive on Christmas of 2021.[15] Although many fans perceived this to be the third season of The Mandalorian,[16][17] \"Chapter 16: The Rescue,\" the Season Two finale of The Mandalorian released on December 18, 2020, teased that The Book of Boba Fett would be the show to arrive in that timeframe instead.[18]\n\nThe following Monday, show producer Jon Favreau appeared on Good Morning America on the ABC Television Network. He clarified that the two were separate shows, with The Book of Boba Fett arriving first.[19] A StarWars.com post later that day reiterated this and stated that The Mandalorian Season Three would go into production in 2021.[1] Filming officially wrapped on June 8, 2021,[20] and the series was still in post-production as of September of that year.[21]\n\nOn September 22, 2021, it was reported that Ludwig Göransson would be composing the music for the show.[22] The show is scored by Joseph Shirley, while Göransson composed the music themes, including the title theme.[4] The soundtrack of the first four episodes was released digitally on January 21, 2022.[23] The soundtrack of the last three episodes was released digitally on February 11, 2022.[24]\n\nAll the parts of the main title theme were sung by Göransson himself. The theme was inspired by Björn Isfält's score to the Swedish 1984 movie Ronja Rövardotter.[25]\n\nThe first teaser trailer was released on November 1, 2021.[12] The promotional trailers mainly used the first minutes of the series premiere as, according to Rodriguez, the second half of the episode gave too much information.[13][4]\n\nDisney Gallery: The Book of Boba Fett, a special which focused on behind-the-scenes aspects of The Book of Boba Fett, premiered on May 4, 2022.[26]",
