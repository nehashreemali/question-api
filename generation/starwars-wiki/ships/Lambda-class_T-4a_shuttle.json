  "content": "The Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, also known as the Lambda-class shuttle, Imperial Lambda, Imperial Transport or the Imperial Shuttle, was a multi-purpose transport with a trihedral foil design used by the Galactic Empire, and was considered an elegant departure from the standards of brutish Imperial engineering. The shuttles were often used by dignitaries and high-ranking officers, but were more commonly found ferrying stormtroopers or cargo.\n\nSome Lambda-class shuttles were retained in service by both New Republic and remaining Imperial remnants during the New Republic Era, being used primarily to transport prisoners.\n\nA hyperdrive-equipped multi-purpose transport, the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle was developed by Sienar Fleet Systems for use in the Imperial Navy.[1] Measuring 20 meters in length, the Lambda-class could attain a max speed of 850 kph, and was one of the more common Imperial ships found throughout the galaxy—along with its nearly-identical counterpart, the Sentinel-class landing craft. It had three wings: one tall, dorsal stabilizer that remained stationary, and two lower articulated flanking wings. While in flight, the wings folded outwards for greater stabilization, while during landing procedures the wings folded inward, reducing the vessel's silhouette. This triangular shape was considered elegant and a departure from the Empire's usually crude designs.[5]\n\nAlthough Lambda-class craft could be flown by a single pilot, the presence of a copilot/navigator made it much easier, especially when traveling through hyperspace.[12] Additionally, in order to prove that the shuttle crew was working for the Empire, Lambda-class T-4a shuttles utilized special transponders to transmit secret codes to Star Destroyers.[7] Through a switch in the cockpit, the cockpit could detach as an emergency escape pod.[11]\n\nDespite the elegance of the Lambda-class's outer design, the inside of many shuttles often reeked of stale sweat owing to the numerous perspiring stormtroopers they hauled across the galaxy. Moreover, bored troopers were known to scratch their operating numbers on every available surface.[17] A well-armed vessel, the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle was equipped with two forward-facing double laser cannons, two forward-facing wing-mounted double cannons, and a retractable rear-mounted double laser cannon.[7]\n\nThe Imperial Lambda-class shuttle was the conceptual and engineering offspring of the Nu-class transport, a versatile craft that saw use during the Clone Wars.[18] Even the top members of the Empire's hierarchy, including Emperor Palpatine himself and his Sith apprentice Darth Vader, traveled in their own private Lambda-class T-4a shuttles;[5][13] with the Emperor's shuttle distinguished by a gray stripe on its nose.[19] Governor Wilhuff Tarkin and his death trooper guard arrived at Landing Pad 13 of the Imperial security complex on the planet Scarif aboard a Lambda.[20]\n\nTo escape the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station and reveal its existence, undercover Crimson Dawn agents Jon Melton and Bevelyn killed Imperial Security Bureau Major Sharin and stole her Lambda-class shuttle[21] Scopium. Although they were soon chased by TIE/IN interceptors, they escaped to a location the Empire would not expect, the Imperial capital of Coruscant, and abandoned the ship.[11] During the Battle of Jakku, Lambda-class shuttles acted as evacuation shuttles from downed Imperial vessels, as well as troop transports to deliver Imperial ground forces to firefights across the surface.[22] During the battle, New Republic pilot Norra Wexley and former Imperial Grand Admiral Rae Sloane used a Lambda-class shuttle while tracking down Gallius Rax.[23]\n\nDuring the New Republic Era, the shuttle would see use by the New Republic[15] and Gideon's Imperial remnant, which used Shuttle 2743. Doctor Penn Pershing was traveling on it when it was raided by Din Djarin and his allies to capture the doctor. They then used it to crash aboard Gideon's light cruiser. After Moff Gideon was captured[24] for the New Republic Tribunal,[25] he was transported aboard a Lambda by the New Republic officers, but he escaped.[15]\n\nDecades later, the Empire's successor state, the First Order borrowed design philosophies exuded from the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle into their newer Xi-class light shuttle[26] and Upsilon-class command shuttle.[27]\n\nThe shuttles first appeared in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.[13] In the 1997 Special Edition rerelease, a Lambda-class shuttle was added to the Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back.[28]\n\nThe shuttle's classification comes from the Greek letter Lambda (uppercase Λ, lowercase λ), whose lowercase form resembles the ship in flight mode. The Lambda-class shuttle's name began a trend of naming shuttles after Greek letters, even if the particular letter's shape does not necessarily resemble the ship in question. This continued to Revenge of the Sith with the inclusion of the Theta-class T-2c shuttle, and later Star Wars Legends works. The trend was brought into Canon with the introduction of the Beta, Gamma, Delta, Zeta, Eta, Mu, Nu, Xi, Omicron, Rho, and Upsilon-class shuttles, some of which were inspired by Legends counterparts.",
