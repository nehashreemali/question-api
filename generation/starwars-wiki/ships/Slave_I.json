  "content": "Slave I, also spelled Slave One and also known as Boba Fett's starship and Jango Fett's starship, was a modified Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft used by the infamous Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett before the Clone Wars and later his unaltered cloned son, Boba Fett, just prior to the Fall of the Republic and during the reign of the Galactic Empire. The ship in its original form was produced by a subsidiary company of Kuat Drive Yards, based on the planet Kuat.\n\nSlave I was a Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft[3] that was modified as far back as its time under Jango Fett. During this time, the only overt weapon systems leftover from its standard layout were the tail blaster cannons, but he still made sure to upgrade them, allowing these cannons to be fired with greater precision.[27]\n\nAlready during its time under Jango, Slave I was a very effective and customized ship, armed with superior shielding technology, high levels of endurance, and an arsenal of hidden and overt weapons. When his son, Boba Fett, took on the ship, he made his own modifications, so Slave I was filled with heavy-duty shield generators, several new weapons systems, and various types of auxiliary sensor systems. Additionally, a secret military sensor, which could be used for jamming and masking, allowed Slave I to disappear from the majority of scanning systems. The craft was equipped with overwhelming weaponry that could take out other heavily armed ships. However, with the exception of the twin blaster cannons, the weapons systems remained hidden to make the ship appear as if it was lightly armed.[27]\n\nJango put Slave I through extensive modifications after several harsh battles in space. Because the original fit of Firespray patrol craft was only furnished for short-term patrol runs, he added spartan crew quarters due to the long hunts he partook in. He also altered the previously police-regulation cages into coffin-like cabinets that were less-humane but better controlled his prisoners. By the ship's use under Boba, Slave I had what were described as \"prisoner cages,\" which had six immobilizing bunks. In the cockpit, sensor scopes displayed readouts for the starship's navigation, atmospheric data, and weapons systems.[27]\n\nThe interior of Slave I included a deck situated on a gyro system, allowing the occupants to stay upright no matter what position the ship was in. The ship also had a holoprojector in the main cabin as well as six chairs for passengers.[10] The artificial gravity on each deck re-oriented, depending on the flight mode the ship was in.[27]\n\nJango Fett stole Slave I whilst undertaking a job on Oovo IV,[28] a prison moon that Firespray attack craft were used to guard,[29] outfitting the craft with a number of weapons, including laser cannons, projectile launchers, and seismic charges.[30] While under Jango's ownership, the ship was used throughout his many adventures, including to rescue the criminal mastermind Phaedra,[31] throughout the search for the Hope of Glee Anselm statue,[32] during the heist in the Outer Rim Territories and subsequent effort to bring his wounded friend Tarr Kligson to the Haven space station,[13] to travel to Ord Mantell,[14] and in a dogfight over Geonosis against a Jedi starfighter piloted by Obi-Wan Kenobi.[8]\n\nAfter Jango's death during the First Battle of Geonosis,[8] the craft came into the possession of his son, Boba, who used it throughout his failed quest to kill the Jedi Master who had beheaded his father, Mace Windu. Boba, his ally turned mentor Aurra Sing, Castas, and Bossk traveled to the planet Florrum to meet with Sing's friend, spice pirate Hondo Ohnaka in the ship. After the arrival of the Jedi Master Plo Koon and Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Fett and Bossk were captured. When Sing tried to escape on Slave I, Tano leaped onto the ship's hull and sliced off a wing with her lightsaber. After this, Sing lost control of the ship and it crashed,[15] with the Jedi believing Sing to be dead. Ohnaka pulled her out of the crash site[33] and took ownership of Slave I for a short period of time,[16] before it returned to Fett's ownership near the end of the Clone Wars.[17]\n\nThe ship became well-known to the galaxy's fugitives, who recognized it as the ship owned by one of the galaxy's deadliest bounty hunters.[30] During the Imperial Era, the ship was once repaired at the Gall Imperial spaceport.[35] During the Galactic Civil War, the adult Boba flew Slave I to rendezvous with the Imperial fleet, where Darth Vader tasked Boba and a group of bounty hunters to capture Han Solo. Boba tracked Solo and his ship, the Millennium Falcon, to Cloud City, landing the Slave I on the East Platform. After Solo's capture, Boba transported the carbon-frozen rebel to bring him to Jabba the Hutt's custody at his palace on Tatooine.[18]\n\nDuring Fett's journey, however, he became sidetracked upon learning about the return of Nakano Lash,[36] using Slave I during his search for his former ally to end his personal vendetta. After returning to his mission to bring Solo to Jabba, certain that Lash would die,[37] Fett eventually took Slave I to the \"smuggler's moon\" of Nar Shaddaa, taking Solo to Doc Ragon to ensure he would survive his carbonite imprisonment. Low on credits, Fett agreed to kill pit warrior Wyrmen Lictor in exchange for the work, but, while Fett was away, Ragon was killed and Solo was taken[38] by agents of Crimson Dawn.[34]\n\nAfter the new head of the organization, Qi'ra, sent a message showing Solo to Jabba, the Hutt believed Fett had double crossed him and put a bounty on Fett. On Nar Shaddaa, Slave I was the site of trap launched by bounty hunters Zuckuss and 4-LOM, yet Fett defeated them both. Hacking into 4-LOM's head, Fett used Slave I to return to Tatooine, where he learned Jabba was offworld and that Crimson Dawn had returned.[34] During the Attack on the Executor, Fett finally regained possession of Solo and traveled to Tatooine to receive his payment. He also had a carbon-freezing chamber installed on the ship in case Solo thawed again and used it against IG-88B. After defeating the assassin droid,[39] Fett finally sold Solo to Jabba and received his payment.[40]\n\nAfter the war, with Fett believed dead at the skirmish at the Great Pit of Carkoon, Slave I was kept in a hanger at Jabba's Palace, now under the control of Bib Fortuna. Eventually, Fett and his new partner Fennec Shand infiltrated the palace and retrieved Slave I. Fett then used the ship to track down and destroy the Kintan Striders. From there, Fett flew to the Pit of Carkoon with the hopes of finding his lost armor. As the Slave I descended into the pit, the sarlacc attacked them, latching onto the craft with its tentacles. Shand dropped a seismic charge into the sarlacc's maw, killing the creature and freeing the ship.[41]\n\nSometime later, Fett and Shand flew Slave I to the planet Tython, where they had tracked the Mandalorian Din Djarin and his Force-sensitive foundling, Grogu. After Grogu was kidnapped by dark troopers belonging to Moff Gideon, Fett flew his ship into Tython's upper atmosphere to identify Gideon's light cruiser. With Djarin's own ship destroyed and Fett now in Djarin's debt to help protect Grogu, Fett agreed to fly Djarin to Nevarro aboard Slave I as part of his plan to retrieve the child.[20]\n\nDeparting from Nevarro, Fett took Djarin and Cara Dune to the Karthon Chop Fields to retrieve Migs Mayfeld. He then flew the party to Morak, where Djarin and Mayfeld infiltrated an Imperial rhydonium refinery and Djarin accessed a computer terminal giving him the coordinates to Gideon's vessel. After the two men finished the mission, Fett rescued them from the roof of the refinery. As Slave I was flying away from the scene, it was targeted by two TIE fighters. Fett used a seismic charge to destroy the fighters.[10]\n\nFollowing the Morak mission, Slave I was used to attack Imperial shuttle 2743 carrying Dr. Penn Pershing, a scientist working for Gideon. Slave I then transported Djarin to Lafete to recruit Bo-Katan Kryze and Koska Reeves in the rescue of Grogu. After tracking down Gideon's cruiser and attacking the ship, Fett jumped into hyperspace per the group's plan. Sometime after the mission's success, Fett collected Shand and landed Slave I on Tatooine. There, the two invaded Jabba the Hutt's former palace, killed Bib Fortuna, and took over the remnants of Jabba's criminal empire.[21]\n\nFett had Slave I stored in the palace's hangar during his gang war with the Pyke Syndicate.[23]\n\nDecades later, the Slave I was mentioned in the Galactic Explorer's Guide, a survival guide written by Hondo Ohnaka and DK-RA-43. It included a blueprint showing various features of the ship.[26]\n\nIn the 2015 reference book Ultimate Star Wars, Slave I was mistakenly named as Clone 1 on two occasions.[3] Since 2021,[42] Slave I has been referred to as \"Boba Fett's starship\" in official media, with this description appearing in merchandise,[43] individual works,[44] and reference material.[24] The last media to use the Slave I name before[45] the widespread[46][47] change was the book The Odyssey of Star Wars: An Epic Poem published on September 28, 2021,[45] although it has since been used in several Star Wars Day-at-a-Time Calendar releases.[48][49][50] In June 2021, a then-upcoming LEGO set of the ship set was renamed \"Boba Fett's Starship\",[46][42] and the URL for the ship's entry on the official StarWars.com Databank was similarly changed,[51] though the entry itself remained titled Slave I.[52] On September 19, 2024, the Databank entry was renamed to \"Boba Fett's Starship\" to match its URL, with no mention of the name Slave I. Despite this,[47] the ship has yet to be officially renamed in canon.",
