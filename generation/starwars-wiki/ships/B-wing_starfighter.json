  "content": "The B-wing starfighter was originally designed by the Mon Calamari Quarrie, who was convinced by Hera Syndulla to let the rebel group Phoenix Squadron use his creation to fight against the Galactic Empire.[8] The B-wing was often the most heavily armed starfighter in the skies and it took inspiration from the T-6 shuttle and the V-19 Torrent starfighter. The B-wings were known as the \"blade wing\" line.[9] During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance used A/SF-01 B-wing starfighters in many battles, including the Battle of Endor.[3] The New Republic used them at the Battle of Jakku.[10] During the First Order-Resistance War, the Resistance used a newer variant at the Battle of Exegol.[7]",
