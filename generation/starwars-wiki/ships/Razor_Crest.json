  "content": "The Razor Crest, also designated M-111,[2] was an ST-70 assault ship used by the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin. Prior to the rise of the Galactic Empire, it served as a military patrol craft. The vessel eventually fell into the hands of Din Djarin, who lived and worked from it as he hunted bounties in the Outer Rim Territories in the early years of the New Republic. He used it throughout the search for the child named Grogu, and continued to use it on the quest to find Grogu's species in 9 ABY. The Razor Crest was destroyed by a single shot fired by Gideon's light cruiser during a skirmish on Tython.\n\nThe Razor Crest, owned by Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin,[5] was built as a gunship[3] military craft[8]—specifically a model officially known as a ST-70 assault ship[2] but commonly nicknamed a \"Razor Crest\"[16]—at some point before the formation of the Galactic Empire[8] in 19 BBY,[9] and was used to patrol local territories.[8] The starship had two laser cannons,[17] which Djarin replaced with more powerful ones than the original,[1] two engines, and a hyperdrive. It could be piloted by one individual and had room for two others.[17] A variety of equipment in the cargo hold could be found, including a vacc tube, a weapons locker, and a carbonite freezing chamber.[5] According to Djarin, one could initiate \"ground security protocols\" from inside the ship, providing a high degree of protection.[18]\n\nThe Razor Crest was built before the rise of the Galactic Empire[5] in 19 BBY[9] and survived the ensuing Imperial Era. Still functional during the reign of the New Republic, the Razor Crest had come into the possession of Mandalorian bounty hunter[7] Din Djarin[19] by circa 9 ABY.[10] Djarin used it as his personal living quarters as well as a transport for captured fugitives in the Outer Rim Territories.[8]\n\nAround that year,[10] Djarin traveled to the ice planet Pagodon where he captured a Mythrol and returned to the ship via a ferry. Upon spotting the ship, the Mythrol told Djarin that it was junk and that he would be happy to spend his credits to hire a better ship for transport. Djarin ignored him, but as they were about to depart, a ravinak attacked the ship's landing gear, dragging it down. Djarin, though, repelled the beast with his Amban phase-pulse blaster. After the Mythrol was found attempting to escape, Djarin subsequently froze him in carbonite.Djarin then returned to Nevarro to turn in his bounties to the Bounty Hunters' Guild leader, Greef Karga. After accepting his next bounty from the Client, he traveled to the desert planet Arvala-7.[5]\n\nArriving on Arvala-7, Djarin acquired his bounty,[5] returning to the ship with the target in hand. However, the Razor Crest had been scavenged by a Jawa tribe for parts, rendering the ship unable to take off. Djarin tracked down the tribe with the help of the Ugnaught Kuiil and negotiated for the parts, agreeing to acquire a mudhorn egg. Exchanging the egg for the parts, he rebuilt the ship with the help of Kuiil and departed the planet.[12]\n\nDjarin returned to Nevarro with Grogu in hand and turned in the bounty. After a change of heart, he rescued Grogu and made his way back to the ship, but was stopped when the Bounty Hunters' Guild intervened. Djarin later escaped to his ship with the help of his tribe. Karga, who had sneaked on board during the gunfight, threatened him at gunpoint, but was shot and knocked out of the ship, after which Djarin left Nevarro with Grogu.[13]\n\nThe bounty hunter set his sights on the forest planet of Sorgan and landed some distance away from the local town. Deeming the locale unsafe for Grogu, Djarin returned to the Razor Crest, but was approached by krill farmers Caben and Stoke, who asked him to defend their village from raiders. The farmers helped Djarin unload supplies from the ship. Following the battle at the village, Djarin was forced to depart the planet with Grogu after discovering that the Guild was still hunting him down.[20]\n\nWhile in space, the Razor Crest was attacked by bounty hunter Riot Mar in his fighter. The gunship sustained damage to one of its engines, causing a fuel leak. Djarin braked his ship so that Mar overflew him, allowing him to shoot down Mar from behind. Djarin was forced to make an emergency landing in Hangar 3-5 on Tatooine. The bay's mechanic, Peli Motto, and her crew of DUM-series pit droids, repaired the gunship while Djarin went to Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina to look for work, meeting and teaming up with rookie bounty hunter Toro Calican to take the bounty on the mercenary Fennec Shand. While Motto was making repairs, Grogu wandered out of the ship, causing the curious Motto to begin to look after him. After Calican betrayed him, Djarin returned to the bay and found the rookie holding both Motto and Grogu hostage at the Razor Crest's entrance ramp. After killing Calican, Djarin boarded the gunship with Grogu and left Tatooine, paying for the repairs with the money he acquired for killing Shand.[17]\n\nDjarin took the Razor Crest to a space station hangar bay where he was convinced by Ranzar Malk, known as \"Ran,\" to join a crew of mercenaries to rescue an imprisoned ally from a New Republic Correctional Transport, the Bothan-5. Ran told Djarin that only reason he wanted him for the job was his ship. The team, led by the ex-Imperial sharpshooter Migs Mayfeld, included the Devaronian Burg, the droid Q9-0, better known as \"Zero,\" and the Twi'lek mercenary Xi'an. When Mayfeld saw the Razor Crest, he immediately expressed his concern with the ship, saying he could not believe it could fly and comparing it to a \"Canto Bight slot machine.\"[7]\n\nDjarin reluctantly agreed to let Zero pilot his ship during the mission. While checking the Razor Crest's systems, Zero encountered a garbled hologram transmission from Karga and reported the ship to be a mess. Zero questioned using Razor Crest, saying that despite the modifications, the ship had leaking power lines, intermittent navigation, and the hyperdrive was operating at 63.3% efficiency. However, Ran replied that the gunship was off both Imperial and New Republic grids and that it could jam New Republic codes. Ran went on to explain that the plan was to board the space station through its blind spot, which was why Zero would be piloting.[7]\n\nDjarin and the crew then departed the space station aboard the Razor Crest. During the journey, tensions grew between Djarin and Burg and they began to fight, accidentally opening a compartment with Grogu inside in the process. Mayfeld and the others examined, theorizing its origin. Mayfeld joked about taking Grogu away as his own pet. The Razor Crest then exited hyperspace directly above the New Republic prison ship and maneuvered to land on top of the ship's hull, shaking the crew around in the process. Djarin opened a hatch beneath the Razor Crest to enter the prison ship.[7]\n\nZero remained on the Razor Crest and redirected the security alert while the rest of the searched for Ran's ally the aboard prison ship. During the mission, a tracking beacon was set off by Lieutenant Lant Davan, a New Republic soldier of the New Republic Correctional Corps, and Zero warned the crew that they had twenty minutes before New Republic reinforcements arrived. After finding Ran's ally, Xian's brother, Qin, Mayfeld, and his crew betrayed Djarin and locked him in a cell. Zero, meanwhile, looked through Djarin's transmissions and discovered his troubles with the Bounty Hunters' Guild and Grogu's importance to the Guild. Djarin, having escaped his cell, blocked communications from Zero. Zero then found the Grogu standing outside the cockpit. Zero got a blaster and began looking for Grogu, who had fled.[7]\n\nZero found Grogu, but Djarin, who had returned to the ship after defeating the rest of Mayfeld's crew, shot him in the back. Djarin flew the Razor Crest back to Ran's space station with Qin as his prisoner and collected the reward for Qin's rescue from Ran. As Djarin quickly left in his ship, Ran waved farewell to his old friend before ordering his men to kill him. However, as a gunship began to take off, Qin realized that Djarin had put a New Republic tracking beacon in his pocket. Several New Republic X-wing starfighters arrived and attacked space station before Ran and Qin could launch a ship to defend themselves.[7]\n\nWhile aboard the Razor Crest, Djarin watched a hologram transmission from Karga, who insisted that the Client was their mutual enemy and requested that the Mandalorian helped the Bounty Hunters' Guild in taking the Client out. Karga proposed that if Djarin brought Grogu back to Nevarro and as bait to eliminate out the Client, then Karga would clear his name and Djarin could keep the infant. Before returning to Nevarro, Djarin took the Razor Crest back to Sorgan and enlisted the help of Cara Dune, an ex-shock trooper for the Alliance to Restore the Republic who had helped on Sorgan. Back on the Razor Crest, Djarin and Dune discussed the mission and prepared for the coming battle in the cargo hold. In the cockpit, Grogu played with the ship's controls and causes the Razor Crest to veer sharply.[18]\n\nDune pointed out that they needed someone to watch over Grogu, so they returned to Arvala-7 to recruit Kuiil and his recently reprogrammed droid IG-11. Kuiil also convinced Djarin to let him bring his three blurrgs. During the flight to Nevarro, Djarin and Dune had a game of arm wrestling. Grogu, thinking the Mandalorian was in danger, Force choked Dune before being stopped by Djarin. Kuiil helped Djarin create a new pram for Grogu in order to keep him safe and out of sight.[18]\n\nWhen the Razor Crest arrived on Nevarro, Djarin and his team were greeted by Karga and three other bounty hunters. The team agreed that Djarin, Kuiil, and Dune would ride the blurrgs, while IG-11 stayed behind to guard the ship and Grogu. Later, after the plan to overthrow the Client's forces failed and the team was exposed, Kuiil attempted to flee with Grogu back to the Razor Crest, but was gunned down shortly before reaching the ramp by two scout troopers on 74-Z speeder bikes. The scout troopers kidnapped the infant[18] and attempted to return him to the Client's superior, Moff Gideon. IG-11 thus left the ship in order to pursue them and rescue Grogu. After a successful rescue and escape from Gideon's forces, Djarin and his crew returned to the Razor Crest with Grogu where Djarin buried Kuiil and gave the infant his mythosaur necklace. Dune and Karga remained on Nevarro while Djarin left with Grogu.[19]\n\nDin Djarin returned to Tatooine in pursuit of a Mandalorian rumored to be living in the town of Mos Pelgo, but found only an impostor, Cobb Vanth, who had been using Mandalorian armor to defend the town.[22] After Djarin took hold of the gear, Peli Motto was able to provide him with a fresh lead through her connections, though at a cost: in exchange for the information, Djarin was obliged to transport a passenger and her clutch of eggs to the estuary moon of Trask, a journey which had to be made at sublight to protect the eggs.[14]\n\nWhat would have otherwise been a slow and uneventful trip was interrupted near Maldo Kreis by a New Republic patrol. Pilots Carson Teva and Trapper Wolf hailed the Razor Crest for a routine inspection, but soon realized that the ship had been involved in the raid on Bothan-5. In an attempt to escape the New Republic pilots, Djarin steered the Razor Crest into Maldo Kreis' atmosphere and canyons, and a harrowing maneuver through a glacial passage seemed to do the trick. Luck was not Djarin's side, however, and the Razor Crest proved too heavy for the patch of ice it had come to rest on. It gave way and ship plummeted into an ice cave, sustaining significant structural damage to the hull and engine nacelles during the fall.[14]\n\nExhausted from the chase and lacking the resources needed to fully repair his ship, Djarin wanted to rest, but his passenger insisted that he fulfill his promise to deliver her and her brood to Trask safely. Time was of the essence, as the eggs were vulnerable to cold. While Djarin attempted to get the Razor Crest back into some semblance of working order, the passenger wandered deeper into the cave and discovered a natural hot spring, forcing Djarin to seek her out with Grogu in tow. The group then came under attack from a swarm of knobby white ice spiders, who had made their nest near the hot spring. Taking refuge in the Razor Crest's cockpit, the trio were surrounded and vastly outnumbered, but they were saved by the timely arrival of Teva and Wolf. The New Republic pilots decided to let Djarin go free since he had tried to protect Lieutenant Davan back on the Bothan-Five and forfeited the bounties on three priority criminals he had detained there, but refrained from assisting in repairing his ship and departed. The Razor Crest still had a ruptured main hold and battered engines, but not wanting to stay in the ice cave any longer than necessary, Djarin sealed himself, Grogu, and the passenger in the cockpit of the Razor Crest, the only compartment that was still airtight, and lifted off.[14]\n\nThe Razor Crest limped to Trask sometime later, but landing there was almost the ship's undoing. After hurtling through the atmosphere at dangerous speeds, unavoidable due to the Razor Crest's decrepit state, Din Djarin narrowly averted a catastrophic crash into a landing platform, but the ship still tumbled into the sea and sank when an engine suddenly died just before touchdown. After the craft was recovered by a heavy industrial crane transport, Djarin's first order of business was to pay a dock worker 1,000 credits for repairs. When the Mandalorian returned after encountering Bo-Katan Kryze and two of her Nite Owls, and helping them capture an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser that belonged to Moff Gideon's fleet, the Razor Crest was space-worthy once more, though much the worse for wear. As a resigned Djarin guided the scarred vessel back into space, it shed various parts and panels.[21]\n\nWhile attempting to reach the planet Corvus, where Din Djarin had been told by Bo-Katan that a Jedi named Ahsoka Tano could be found, the hyperdrive of the Razor Crest failed. Djarin had Grogu climb into a narrow duct to try and rewire the mechanism, but the infant was too inept, and Djarin was left with little choice but to detour to Nevarro for more thorough repairs. Upon landing at the city, Djarin was greeted by Cara Dune and Greef Karga. Karga assured the Mandalorian that repairs for the Razor Crest could be arranged, and promptly ordered two workers to restore the vessel to its prime. In the meantime, Karga recruited Djarin for a raid on an Imperial base that still threatened the safety and prosperity of Nevarro.[15]\n\nDuring the raid, Djarin learned that not only was Moff Gideon still alive, but he was in need of Grogu's blood and was still searching for him. Fearing for Grogu, Djarin departed the Imperial base ahead of his companions and rushed back to the city. Karga, Dune, and a Mythrol fought their way out of the base and escaped aboard a Trexler 906 Armored Marauder, drawing pursuit from five scout troopers and four Outland TIE fighters. Karga used the Marauder's turret to take out the scout troopers and one of the TIEs, but the latter's debris destroyed the turret and the other three TIEs were poised to strike. At that moment, the Razor Crest, now fully-repaired, crept up from behind the TIEs and blasted them from the skies. Karga invited Djarin to land for a drink and payment for his timely assistance, but the Mandalorian declined, accepting the repairs to his ship as payment enough, and immediately set off for Corvus. However, Djarin was unaware that the Mimbanese worker who had fixed the Razor Crest was an Imperial collaborator and had concealed a tracking beacon on it, giving Moff Gideon a new opportunity to procure Grogu for his experiments.[15]\n\nDin Djarin subsequently visited Corvus and encountered the former Jedi Ahsoka Tano, who revealed the Child's name was Grogu, but declined to train him. Instead, Tano directed the Mandalorian to Tython, where Grogu could use a Seeing stone to reach out with the Force and possibly contact another Jedi who would be willing to train him.[23]\n\nAt Tython, Djarin landed the Razor Crest at the base of the mountain that held the temple, since the mountain's peak had no area large enough to accommodate the ship. As Djarin did not expect any visitors, he left the ship open and unsecured. Shortly after Grogu began meditating in the temple, Djarin was alarmed by the arrival of another vessel, Slave I, and headed down the mountain to intercept the possible threat. Djarin found himself outgunned by Boba Fett and Fennec Shand, though the two only sought to reclaim Fett's armor, which Djarin had taken from Cobb Vanth on Tatooine. Before they could negotiate a trade, an Imperial troop carrier descended from the skies and touched down next to the Razor Crest.[11]\n\nA battle ensued, as Fett and Shand focused on eliminating the stormtroopers while Djarin tried in vain to retrieve Grogu from his meditation. As a second troop carrier landed with reinforcements, Fett made his way to the Razor Crest and donned his armor in time to return to Djarin and Shand, who had become surrounded. In short order, Fett drove the stormtroopers into a headlong retreat, then destroyed both fleeing troop carriers with a single well-placed missile. The trio's victory was short-lived, however, as a single blast from a turbolaser fired by Moff Gideon's light cruiser blasted the Razor Crest into pieces, and a contingent of dark troopers arrived and captured Grogu.[11]\n\nVery little survived of the Razor Crest. Djarin sifted through the remains, which had been scattered across a crater, but only recovered the beskar spear he had acquired on Corvus and the control knob that Grogu had been fond of playing with. Djarin did not dwell long on the loss of his ship, and left Tython with Fett and Shand aboard Slave I, heading for Nevarro in an attempt to find a way to rescue Grogu.[11]\n\nAfter losing his ship, Djarin would contact Peli Motto, seeking a replacement of a similar model. When Motto informed Djarin that she had found a replacement, he was disappointed to learn that it was not in fact another ST-70 Assault Ship, but instead an N-1 starfighter still undergoing repair by Motto. However, Djarin soon agreed to help repair the starfighter and fashioned it to his liking and specifications. When taking the fighter for a test spin, Djarin initially controlled it as if it was a gunship, as he was used to the way the Razor Crest had handled. However, he soon learned to pilot it in a manner more suitable for a starfighter.[24]\n\nThe Razor Crest was first mentioned in the video The Mandalorian Panel - Sunday, uploaded by the official Star Wars YouTube channel on April 4, 2019.[3] The gunship made its first appearance in \"Chapter 1: The Mandalorian,\" the first episode of The Mandalorian Season One, directed by Dave Filoni.[5] The episode released on November 12, 2019.[26]\n\nThe craft was conceived by Jon Favreau, and was designed by Lucasfilm veteran concept artist Ryan Church. Favreau's design brief was the A-10 Thunderbolt 'Warthog'[25] It was created as both practical and computer-generated models.[27] The designers drew inspiration from World War II plane aesthetics, military style aircrafts, and derelict planes seen in airport graveyards.[28]\n\nThe Razor Crest is mentioned in the non-canon LEGO Star Wars Awesome Vehicles, which establishes that it has a length of 25 meters (80 ft), a top speed of 800 kph (497 mph), and was manufactured by Belsmuth Consolidations Ltd.[29]",
