  "content": "Astromech droids, also referred to as astro droids or mechs, were a type of repair droid that served as an automated mechanic on starships. These compact droids used tool-tipped appendages stored in recessed compartments. Many starfighters relied on astromech copilots to control flight and power distribution systems.[2] Sitting in an astromech socket exposed to space, the droid, in addition to its piloting duties, could calculate hyperspace jumps and perform simple repairs.[3] The astromedic was a mix between an astromech and a medical droid.[4]\n\nMost astromechs were only able to communicate in writing, conveyed via another computer system, or through a special code of clicks, bleeps, and similar sounds, known as binary. However, certain other droids, such as the protocol droid C-3PO, could understand the binary code of astromechs, and often translated from binary to other languages.\n\nAstromech droids averaged 0.93 meters in height,[5] while R-series droids from the R2 line forward had a height of just over a meter.[6] However, the astromech P2 stood around the same height as a human.[7] R-series droids had three wheeled legs.[5] The later BB-series astromech droids were spherical, giving them the ability to roll.[8] Some astromechs, such as OC-JK14, were moved on treadwells. Though this style was once popular in the Outer Rim Territories, it had fallen out of favor by 35 ABY.[9] The R2-series unit R2-D2 was perhaps the most famous astromech droid in galactic history.[10]",
