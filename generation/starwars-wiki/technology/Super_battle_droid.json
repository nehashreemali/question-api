  "content": "B2-series super battle droids,[14] also known as B2 super battle droids,[15] were an advanced[16] battle droid used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. Although one model of the B2-series was only equipped with wrist blasters on their right forearm,[4] another was outfitted with wrist blasters on both forearms.[8] Super battle droids were also equipped with wrist rockets and a rapid fire function for their wrist blaster.[17]\n\nSuper battle droids were much stronger than their predecessors, and like the updated B1s used by the Confederacy, they did not require a command system to operate, which gave the droids limited independence. Another improvement was their thick armor casing, which contained their fragile sensors. However, B2s were designed with simple processors, limiting their ability to formulate strategies. As a result, they relied on organic commanders or tactical droids in order to effectively operate.[18] The B2 was much stronger than the B1s, with enough strength to lift a clone trooper off the ground.[8]\n\nHaving been developed before the onslaught of the Clone Wars, the first batch of B2 super battle droids was put into operation on Geonosis, during the battle that started the conflict.[20] The droids could take more hits and could stand up better to their enemies than the B1-series battle droid could, and it saw greater production after the Battle of Geonosis.[21] However, the super battle droid cost more than the B1, and their higher cost made it so that there were often one hundred B1 battle droids for every B2 on a battlefield.[22]\n\nWith the Clone Wars spreading across the galaxy,[8] Separatist officers worked to ensure B2 units became part of their armies, as they had seen how well the new droids had fought on Geonosis.[23] Early into[24] the long lasting defense of Dantooine,[25] B2s fought against[26] a Republic defense.[27] Jedi General Mace Windu once cut down[26] an overwhelming wave of B2s[24] and fought back against seismic tanks on Dantooine.[26]\n\nIn the Battle of Christophsis, B2s reduced their targets to wreckage, which proved to be a common role for the super droids.[23] Nevertheless, B2s failed to ensure a Separatist victory on Christophsis, ultimately falling with the rest of the invasion army. Concurrently, B2s were among the battle droids stationed on the Wild Space planet Teth, where they ensured Rotta the Huttlet remained in custody until a Republic counterattack.[8]\n\nIn 21 BBY,[28] B2 super battle droids and other droid units were being constructed on Geonosis,[29] which the Separatists had taken back from the Republic,[1] in the[29] largest droid foundry ever constructed.[30] To reconquer the planet and shut down Poggle the Lesser's factories, the Republic launched an invasion, and, during their push to reach Point Rain, Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and his 501st Legion confronted the super droids and B1 battle droids stationed at the eastern barrier. Once Skywalker and his Padawan, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, made their way to the top of the wall, Clone Captain Rex ordered that blaster fire be focused on the droids.[31]\n\nUltimately, Skywalker and Tano, who were joined by Rex once he reached the top, successfully took down a pair of droidekas and the barrier.[31] After Republic forces were reinforced by the 41st Elite Corps, they made an attack on Poggle's primary droid factory and fought its B1, B2, and Geonosian defenders. However, the entire attack was a distraction to allow Jedi Commanders Tano and Barriss Offee to enter and destroy the factory. Using a Separatist super tank, the two Padawans successfully destroyed the foundry.[29]\n\nOne super battle droid was G21, who once gave a report to a superior that the planet it was stationed on was secured and that the population was under control.[1] The destroyed remains of B2s were among the wreckage strewn around the ancient temple used as a base by the Death Wind.[32]\n\nThe B2 super battle droids continued to see action until the end of the Clone Wars.[33] Thus, they served in the Outer Rim Sieges, fighting in events like the Battle of Anaxes[34] and Battle of Yerbana.[35] A number of units also served aboard Grievous' flagship Invisible Hand during the Battle of Coruscant. All B2 units were shut down following the execution of the Separatist Council, ending the Clone War in a victory for the newly-formed Galactic Empire.[33]\n\nAfter the Clone Wars at least one B2 fell into the hands of scrappers on a planetoid. This B2 was saved by C1-10P, and would join a droid group dedicated to helping other droids.[37] Sallowpink was the name of a modified B2 scheduled to take part in a Pit Fight Night against Rheen the Powderizer[38] between 10 BBY and 3 ABY.[39] While on the planet of Aloxor, Major Dayja Collerand of the Imperial Security Bureau, working under the alias \"Mole,\" told Sisay's gang and several undercover operatives—Lieutenant Eli Vanto of the Chiss Ascendancy, Imperial Assistant Director Brierly Ronan, and death troopers Waffle and Pik—about a narrow and unofficial backdoor to an Imperial docking area. Stating no large droids would be able to fit through, he claimed to have heard that someone had tried to get a super droid through.[40]\n\nOn the planet Koboh, B2-HA super battle droids and other former Separatist forces were reprogrammed and used as soldiers by the Bedlam Raiders.[12]\n\nAlso after the war, some B2s fell into the hands of Quarantine World III. These units were reprogrammed and were used as security for the location, and several of these droids confronted the Archaeologist Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra during her mission to steal the Triple-Zero protocol personality matrix from the planet. The droids that encountered Aphra were destroyed later in the mission by Darth Vader, who had come to recruit the archaeologist.[41] One droid bounty hunter active during the Imperial Era was made from the body of a B2 and the head of a BX-series droid commando, yet the unit was nevertheless destroyed during a skirmish on Arbiflux.[42] Several B2s were part of the Second Revelation.[43]\n\nA large amount of B2 battle droids were acquired by the Plazir-15's government and were repurposed for civilian duties, with a large number of them being used as loader droids at the loading docks. One of these droids was infected with spiked Nepenthé, causing it to go rogue. The droid was later destroyed by Kryze and Djarin, who had been hired by the government to investigate reports of droids going haywire.[13] A Mandalorian scout who survived in the ruins of Mandalore after the Great Purge made use of a B2 faceplate as a pauldron.[44]\n\nDuring the Cold War, a number of B2 units served as security on Cato Neimoidia.[45]\n\nNot too long before the Battle of Exegol[46] in 35 ABY,[47] the pirate Sidon Ithano made a substantial sale of a vintage cache of super battle droids to the pirate Kragan Gorr and his Warbird pirates,[48] who bought them in an attempt to seize control of the supertanker fuel depot Colossus. However, as the droids were considerably outdated, Gorr recruited the aid of the Colossus resident, Neeku Vozo to aid him in upgrading the droids to a more efficient state. Vozo upgraded the droids, but was wary of Kragen's intentions and reprogramed a single B1 battle droid to become the designated commander of the B2s and use him to take control of the B2s.[36]\n\nB2 super battle droids first appeared in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.[4] Originally, as seen in animatics for the film, the super battle droids were to dual wield E-5 blaster rifles instead of having a built-in wrist blaster.[53]\n\nB2 super battle droids were later featured in Star Wars: The Clone Wars[19] and Star Wars Resistance.[36] The droids had a similar stylized appearance in both shows.[19][36] In the novel The Legends of Luke Skywalker, an image depicting the rescue of R2-D2 features a droid that resembles a B2.[54] The manga adaption of this story later confirmed a B2 was indeed present for its events.[55]\n\nAn unfinished Clone Wars episode had Rex and R2-D2 encounter a B2 super battle droid who they eventually grow attach to.",
