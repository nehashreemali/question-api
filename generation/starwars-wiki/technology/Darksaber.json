  "content": "The Darksaber was an ancient and unique black-bladed lightsaber created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order, around 1050 BBY. The weapon was kept in the Jedi Temple after Vizsla's passing, but members of House Vizsla stole the saber in a conflict with the Jedi during the fall of the Old Republic. The Darksaber was passed down, generation to generation, by the ancestors of Pre Vizsla, who held onto the weapon even after the pacifist ideals of the New Mandalorians replaced the warrior ways of Mandalore.\n\nBy 21 BBY, the Darksaber was in the possession of Pre Vizsla, the leader of Death Watch and House Vizsla during the Clone Wars. He used the blade during his conflicts with the New Mandalorians, including his successful takeover of Mandalore. After the coup, renegade Sith Lord Maul killed Vizsla in a duel and took the Darksaber as his own, becoming the leader of Death Watch. However, Maul's old master, Darth Sidious, soon arrived on Mandalore to confront his former apprentice. Maul used the Darksaber to fight him but was ultimately bested in combat, taken prisoner and held at a Separatist prison, the Spire, on Stygeon Prime.\n\nMaul was soon rescued from the Spire at the behest of Prime Minister Almec, whom Maul had chosen as the public leader of Mandalore. After being freed, Maul returned to Zanbar, the location of a Death Watch camp, and was given back the Darksaber, which had been recovered from the Sundari Royal Palace, the site of Maul's duel with Sidious. Shortly after his return, Zanbar was attacked by the Separatist Droid Army, led by General Grievous, and Maul made use of the Darksaber against the cyborg general, although he was forced to retreat. Maul continued to use the Darksaber in several subsequent battles, such as the battle on Ord Mantell, the assault on Vizsla Keep 09, and the Second Battle of Dathomir.\n\nDuring the Imperial Era, the Mandalorian weapons expert and rebel Sabine Wren retrieved the Darksaber from the Nightsister lair on Dathomir. At the urging of Mandalorian Protector Fenn Rau and her fellow Spectres, Sabine agreed to undergo training with the Darksaber under the tutelage of Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus. Later, Sabine brought the Darksaber along with her rebel companions during a mission to Krownest, where she sought the support of her family for the rebellion. Sabine became the rightful wielder of the Darksaber after defeating Imperial Viceroy Gar Saxon in a duel.\n\nAfter rescuing her father from Imperial custody and destroying the superweapon she had built while an Imperial cadet, Sabine offered the Darksaber over to Lady Bo-Katan Kryze, the sister of the former Duchess, whom she deemed to be the rightful person to lead the Mandalorians against the Empire. Bo-Katan was reluctant to accept the mantle of leader, but with the support of the other clans, agreed and accepted the Darksaber.\n\nAfter the Night of a Thousand Tears, the Empire desecrated Mandalore and Bo-Katan surrendered the Darksaber to Moff Gideon, hoping that the Empire would stop the Great Purge of Mandalore. However, the Empire continued with the Purge. She fled the planet, but continued to lead the Nite Owls and was intent on eventually reclaiming the Darksaber and Mandalore. By circa 9 ABY, after the fall of the Empire, Gideon still possessed the Darksaber, and was the leader of an Imperial remnant on the planet of Nevarro. During his rescue of the Force-sensitive foundling Grogu from Gideon, the Mandalorian Din Djarin won the Darksaber from Gideon in combat. He attempted to pass the Darksaber on to Bo-Katan, but she declined, knowing that being once more gifted the Darksaber would make her claim to the throne illegitimate. Later, Djarin was challenged for the right to wield the weapon by Paz Vizsla, a descendant of Tarre Vizsla, on Glavis Ringworld. Djarin won the fight but was formally expelled from the Children of the Watch following the duel. Djarin continued to wield the Darksaber as his own.\n\nWhile exploring the ruins of Mandalore in search of the Mines of Mandalore, in order to bathe in the Living Waters and be redeemed from his exile, Djarin was ambushed, rendered unconscious, and captured. Grogu obtained the assistance of Bo-Katan in rescuing Djarin, during which she engaged and defeated his attacker using the Darksaber while he was restrained. Upon Djarin regaining consciousness, he continued to wear the Darksaber on his belt, using it on a few subsequent occasions, such as to engage a rogue forensic droid on Plazir-15. Following Bo-Katan's defeat of Axe Woves in a formal challenge for leadership of the Mandalorian force serving as mercenary security on Plazir-15, Axe objected to her claim to leadership of all Mandalorians, on the grounds that only the wielder of the Darksaber could fill that role. Djarin presented the Darksaber to Bo-Katan, who initially rejected it, saying that the Darksaber could not simply be given, but Djarin recounted the events on Mandalore to the assembled Mandalorians, and they accepted that Bo-Katan was the rightful owner due to having defeated the foe who had defeated Djarin. Djarin asserted he was returning it to its rightful owner, and she reluctantly took it, igniting the blade as the assembled forces accepted her leadership.\n\nShortly afterward, it was discovered that Moff Gideon had constructed a secret base beneath the surface of Mandalore where he was conducting experiments in cloning a body for himself with Force potential, as well as mining beskar to construct armor for a new version of Dark Troopers, along with a suit of powered armor for himself. When the combined Mandalorian forces launched an attack on Gideon's base, Bo-Katan engaged Gideon in combat, pitting the Darksaber against his electrostaff. Though she fought valiantly, Gideon's new armor gave him a physical edge that she could not overcome, and he ended their fight by crushing the Darksaber's hilt as she grasped it, breaking her hand in the process.\n\nThe Darksaber was an ancient black-bladed lightsaber.[16] It had a unique blade that was shorter than that of most lightsabers, and shaped like a traditional sword. Its overall profile was distinctly Mandalorian with an angular pommel, hand guard, and slit-shaped blade emitter, all of which was made out of beskar.[11] The sound emitted by its blade was also higher pitched than other lightsabers when ignited or swung, sounding more like a screech than a hum. The Darksaber had a crystal which served as a conduit for Force energy. The wielder's thoughts and actions guided the blade's current of power, with the blade often producing an electrical effect in response to a heightened emotional state.[3] The Darksaber would attempt to connect with its wielder on a subconscious level, with the blade feeling proportionately heavier or lighter depending on the wielder resisting or embracing the connection.[3][11]The Darksaber was also capable of parrying a blow from a lightsaber, with the blades being drawn to each other in an almost magnetic pull.[17] Like other typical lightsabers, the Darksaber could not cut through pure beskar, however, it was capable of heating it to the point of turning red.[10] Also, it could not penetrate a Personal Combat Shield, though it could overwhelm and dissipate it with prolonged contact[11] and a deflector shield used by a Scorpenek annihilator droid.[18]\n\nIt was respected by the Mandalorians as a symbol for the leadership of House Vizsla, and later Death Watch.[15] According to the ways of the Nite Owls and the Mandalorian fleet, the ruler of Mandalore must possess the Darksaber.[19] According to Mandalorian custom, one could only obtain the Darksaber by defeating the previous owner in combat. Should they have claimed it any other way, their claim was considered illegitimate.[15][10] However, when Bo-Katan received the Darksaber from Sabine Wren without the fight, she was accepted by other clans—an act that she would later be shunned for after the events of the Great Purge of Mandalore. At least one element of Mandalorian society, the Children of the Watch, believed that the Darksaber carried a terrible curse that would lead to the destruction of Mandalore and its people if it was acquired outside of combat.[11] The Children of the Watch also did not follow the wielder of the Darksaber, even if it was won by combat.[20]\n\nAround 1050 BBY,[4] the Darksaber was created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order. After his passing it was kept at the Jedi Temple. However, during the Old Republic's fall, it was taken by Mandalorians of House Vizsla, who raided the Jedi Temple.[3] Descendants of House Vizsla used it to murder many Jedi[2] and rule all of Mandalore for many years.[3]\n\nBy the time of the Clone Wars, the Darksaber had come into the possession of Pre Vizsla, Governor of Concordia and leader of Death Watch. Vizsla kept it on his back when he wore his armor.[2]\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan Kenobi of the Jedi High Council discovered Death Watch's camp near the planet's mines. Using the Darksaber, Vizsla fought Kenobi as his troops evacuated. Though he boasted some skill in combat, Vizsla was unable to defeat Kenobi or prevent his escape with Duchess Satine Kryze.[2]\n\nFollowing Vizsla's fallout with the Separatists and Count Dooku, Vizsla and his fellow Death Watch troops made camp on Carlac. After the arrival of Senator Lux Bonteri, Vizsla attempted to murder Chieftain Pieter with the Darksaber but instead struck down his granddaughter when she threw herself in front of him as his men destroyed Ming Po Town. After Bonteri's friend, Padawan Ahsoka Tano, revealed herself as a Jedi and tried to defend the Ming Po, she was subdued and Vizsla intended to murder her with the Darksaber, citing it as \"justice\" for the Jedi's past \"crimes\" against Mandalore. However, Tano freed herself with the help of her astromech droid, R2-D2. She then slew multiple Mandalorian warriors and dueled Vizsla until she slashed his jetpack, allowing her and Bonteri to make their escape.[21]\n\nFollowing the discovery of the rogue Sith Lord Maul and his brother Savage Opress near their camp on Zanbar, Vizsla agreed to an alliance between Death Watch and Maul's Shadow Collective. Vizsla used the Darksaber on Nal Hutta against the Hutt Clans' Grand Council's Nikto guards, cutting down all in his way. Vizsla then led the Council's leader, Jabba, to agree to join their alliance.[22]\n\nOn Mandalore, following the Shadow Collective's attacks on the police in Sundari, Vizsla and his Death Watch Warriors stepped in to \"protect\" against the Collective's forces. However, this was actually staged with the intention of overthrowing Duchess Satine's government. Vizsla used the Darksaber in a staged duel against Opress and then arrested him. Thanks to his efforts, Vizsla and the Death Watch were hailed as heroes in the eyes of the Mandalorian populace.[7]\n\nVizsla then betrayed Maul and Opress and had them imprisoned. After their escape, Maul challenged Vizsla for leadership of Death Watch. Vizsla used the Darksaber against Maul. Despite putting up an impressive fight with the use of both the Darksaber and his armor's numerous weapons, Vizsla was disarmed, defeated, and summarily executed by Maul with the Darksaber. Maul then claimed the Darksaber and leadership of Death Watch, much to the chagrin of Vizsla's lieutenant, Nite Owl Bo-Katan Kryze, who refused to follow a leader who was not a Mandalorian despite him winning the fabled blade fairly in combat.[7]\n\nAfter Maul lured Kenobi back to Mandalore, Maul used the Darksaber to kill Duchess Satine in front of Kenobi as part of his revenge against the Jedi Master. After Kenobi made his escape thanks to Bo-Katan, Maul and Opress were confronted by Maul's former master, Darth Sidious, who came to eliminate his former apprentice before he grew even more powerful. Together, Maul and Opress fought Sidious, but they were no match against the Sith Lord. After Opress was killed, Maul drew the Darksaber and wielded it in tandem with his red blade against his former master, but was unable to defeat him. Sidious tossed aside the Darksaber as he subdued and tortured Maul with Force lightning. As his former apprentice begged for mercy, Sidious simply replied that there was no mercy as he continued to torture him.[17]\n\nPrime Minister Almec and the Mandalorian super commandos recovered the Darksaber following Maul's capture by Sidious. After being freed from the prison known as the Spire by Gar Saxon and Rook Kast, Maul reclaimed the Darksaber and used the weapon against General Grievous's forces and MagnaGuards when they came to Zanbar to attack their base. Maul fought Grievous until his forces were forced to retreat.[23]\n\nMaul again used the Darksaber when he boarded Grievous's dreadnought to keep him in check during the battle on Ord Mantell.[24] Maul then threatened to kill Dooku with the Darksaber as a means of revenge against Sidious. However, Maul freed Dooku and the two used their weapons against Kenobi, Mace Windu, Aayla Secura, Tiplee, and their forces as they battled at Maul's secret asteroid outpost Vizsla Keep 09. He then used the Darksaber against Secura and Windu whilst Dooku killed Tiplee.[25]\n\nAfter Maul returned to Dathomir to help Mother Talzin regain her physical form, Maul was confronted by Sidious and Grievous at the Nightbrothers' village. He, along with Talzin, who had possessed Dooku, fought Sidious and Grievous. Maul used the Darksaber in the battle until he and Talzin were overwhelmed. He fled the battle as Talzin sacrificed herself and was killed by Grievous.[26]\n\nThe Darksaber was still on Dathomir during the reign of the Galactic Empire, kept by Maul in the Nightsister lair. Sabine Wren used it against Ezra Bridger while she was possessed by a Nightsister spirit. Ezra used his lightsaber and the Darksaber to destroy the altar from which the spirits rose. Sabine then picked up the Darksaber as she, Ezra, and Kanan Jarrus left the planet.[27] Upon their return to their base on the planet Atollon, Sabine gave the lightsaber to Kanan for safekeeping because she was hesitant to use it herself.[3]\n\nLater, Kanan showed the saber to Fenn Rau, suspecting that the Mandalorian Protector knew something about it, as Sabine had refused to speak of the weapon since their return from Dathomir. Rau told Kanan the legend of the saber's creation, as well as how it was used to unite House Vizsla and, eventually, all of Mandalore. Rau and Hera Syndulla convinced a reluctant Sabine to learn how to use the saber so she could attempt to use it to unite Clan Wren and form an alliance with the rebellion. Sabine was willing to try, but was unsure she would be successful, due to her estranged relationship with her family. Kanan, Ezra, and Sabine traveled to a secluded location on the planet Atollon to train. Ezra taught Sabine the basic lightsaber forms using wooden training sabers, and after several days, Kanan allowed Sabine to wield the Darksaber. During the duel, Kanan was able to convince Sabine to talk about why she left Mandalore. Sabine revealed she left to fight the Empire and save her planet. She felt responsible for weapons the Empire used to enslave her people. In doing this, Sabine was able to process her emotions, which allowed her to decide that she was worthy of wielding the saber.[3]\n\nFollowing her trials, Sabine, along with Kanan, Ezra, Chopper, and Rau, traveled with the Darksaber to Clan Wren's domain on Krownest. Their mission was to solicit Clan Wren's support for the rebellion. After crash landing on the planet, Sabine, Kanan, and Ezra sought an audience with Sabine's mother Ursa Wren, the leader of Clan Wren. While Ursa was shocked that her daughter had obtained the Mandalorian weapon, she later disputed Sabine's claim to the weapon since she had not wrested it from Maul in single combat. Later, Ursa tried to trade the Darksaber, along with Kanan and Ezra, to Viceroy Gar Saxon, the Emperor's Hand and the puppet ruler of Mandalore, in exchange for Sabine's safety. Saxon had no intention of keeping his word and ignited the Darksaber as a signal to his men to massacre Clan Wren. While the Super Commandos fought with the Clan Wren warriors and the Jedi, Saxon tried to murder Ursa with the Darksaber from behind but Sabine, wielding Ezra's lightsaber, intercepted the blow. The two then engaged in a fierce duel outside the Wren Stronghold. Although Saxon nearly overpowered Sabine with sheer force, Sabine managed to use her newfound skills to wound him and recover the Darksaber, holding both the black and green blades to his throat and demanding he yield. After Ursa killed Saxon, Sabine became the rightful new owner of the Darksaber. She stayed behind with her family and Rau to reunify the Mandalorian people and find the true leader of Mandalore.[15]\n\nSabine eventually led a mission to Mandalore to rescue her father, Alrich Wren, from Imperial custody. She wielded the Darksaber during the fighting, first at a remote prison and later attacking the convoy taking her father back to Sundari. During the mission, Sabine met Bo-Katan and offered her the sword, but Bo-Katan turned it down as she felt she was unworthy and had already had her chance to rule. Later, Sabine and Bo-Katan led a raid on then-Mandalorian governor Tiber Saxon's Star Destroyer in order to destroy the Duchess, the superweapon Sabine had built during her days as an Imperial cadet. Sabine used the Darksaber to breach the Duchess' core, causing a chain reaction that led to the Star Destroyer's destruction and Tiber's death. After the raid, she finally persuaded Bo-Katan to accept the weapon by showing her that other clans were willing to follow her and stating that the Force had brought the saber to her so she in turn could pass it on to Bo-Katan. Bo-Katan accepted the sword in memory of her sister, Satine, and for the honor of her clan and Mandalore itself.[8]\n\nSome time after Kryze claimed the Darksaber, the Empire set out to annihilate the Mandalorians, enacting a genocide that would become known as the Great Purge of Mandalore. After the Night of a Thousand Tears, most of Mandalore's forces were defeated. Bo-Katan was contacted by the Imperial Security Bureau. She met with Gideon and surrendered the Darksaber, in return for the Empire stopping the Purge. The Empire broke the promise and continued killing Mandalorians.[20]\n\nIn 9 ABY,[29] Moff Gideon still possessed the Darksaber. He later used it to escape from the wreckage of his Outland TIE fighter after a confrontation with Din Djarin on the planet of Nevarro.[9]\n\nBo-Katan continued to lead the Nite Owls and remained focused on eventually reclaiming her homeworld as well as the fabled weapon that signified her leadership. She was hunting for Gideon. Aboard an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser, Kryze, accompanied by Axe Woves, Koska Reeves, and Djarin, threatened an Imperial captain and demanded to know the location of the Darksaber. The captain bit a suicide shocker, killing him. This move left Kryze clueless about its whereabouts, but sharpened her will to earn back what was rightfully hers.[28]\n\nFollowing the Battle of Tython, the Mandalorian foundling Grogu was captured by Gideon and brought to his command ship. While visiting the child in his cell, Gideon ignited the Darksaber, and asked him if he remembered other weapons of its kind from his past. When Grogu reached towards the saber's blade, Gideon pulled it away, telling him that he was not yet ready to play with such things.[30]\n\nAfter Grogu's capture, Djarin located Kryze and Reeves and recruited them to help rescue him. Kryze agreed to help after Djarin promised her the Darksaber. After a successful raid of Gideon's cruiser by Djarin, Kryze, and their associates, Djarin encountered Gideon in Grogu's cell, holding the ignited Darksaber over the helpless youngling. After giving a brief exposition on the weapon's history and significance in Mandalorian culture and seemingly agreeing to let Djarin take Grogu in exchange for never crossing paths again, Gideon attempted to strike him down from behind with the Darksaber but was foiled by the Mandalorian's beskar-plated jetpack which the blade could not cut through. He then engaged Djarin in a duel, Gideon's Darksaber against Djarin's beskar spear, but was defeated and disarmed.[10]\n\nDjarin brought the captured moff to the bridge and tried to give the weapon to Kryze, but she refused to take it. Gideon laughed at Djarin's ignorance as Kryze explained that she had to win it in battle. Djarin attempted to yield, intending to make good on his promise and wanting to avoid trouble, but Kryze only stared at him coldly and yet again refused. However, before their conflict could continue, the group was forced to arm themselves to repel Gideon's dark troopers. Eventually, the Jedi Luke Skywalker arrived to save them, taking Grogu with him to be trained in the ways of the Force.[10]\n\nAfter successfully delivering Grogu to Skywalker, Djarin kept the Darksaber, continuing to utilize it in his bounty hunting activities. Eventually, he began searching for the new covert of his Tribe on the Glavis Ringworld, where he used the Darksaber to collect the bounty of Kaba Baiz for information on their whereabouts. Due to his lack of familiarity and training with the weapon, Djarin accidentally slashed his own thigh with the Darksaber whilst battling Baiz's thugs. After locating the covert, the Armorer explained the past of the weapon to Djarin, as well as Kryze's failure to follow Mandalorian traditions and Mandalore's downfall under her rule during the Night of a Thousand Tears. The Armorer also trained Djarin in using the weapon, telling him that he was fighting against the Darksaber rather than his opponent, making the weapon seem heavier in nature the more he swung it.[11]\n\nAfter training with the Armorer, Djarin was challenged for the Darksaber by Paz Vizsla, who viewed the weapon as rightfully his birthright due to its origins within his own clan. Djarin narrowly defeated Vizsla in single combat, but was soon ostracized by the Armorer, who learned that he had removed his helmet during his mission with Grogu. Following his unceremonious ex-communication, Djarin left the covert, taking the Darksaber with him unhindered. When departing to Tatooine, Djarin was temporarily separated from the weapon when it was placed in luggage, as he was unable to take it on board the transport ship he had boarded.[11] After being called upon by his friend Boba Fett, Djarin used the Darksaber in battle against Scorpenek droids in Mos Espa. Though the saber was unable to pierce the droids' energy shields, coordination between Djarin and Fett allowed the former to sneak within shield range of a Scorpenek and severly damage it with the Darksaber.[18]\n\nDjarin later took the Darksaber with him to Mandalore on his mission to redeem himself by bathing in the Living Waters in the Mines of Mandalore. On his journey in the wreckage of the Civic Center of Sundari, he struggled to use the Darksaber while fighting Alamites that had attacked him, but eventually he was able to kill them. Later, a cyborg trapped and captured Djarin. The being disarmed Djarin while showing no interest in the saber, taking and throwing it to the ground. Grogu was able to escape the ruins to Kalevala, where he found Kryze. Grogu led Kryze to Djarin's location, so that she could save Djarin from the crisis. She grabbed the disregarded Darksaber with her whipcord, using it to defeat one of the cyborg's forms. The cyborg was able to get out of the destroyed droid and crawl to a Spider Tank, but Kryze prevailed with the saber again, destroying the Tank and killing the cyborg. After freeing Djarin, she returned the saber to him.[31]\n\nFollowing her time with the watch, Kryze and Djarin went to the planet Plazir-15 in order to reclaim command of the Mandalorian fleet she had gathered from Axe Woves. She had challenged Woves to duel for the leadership of the fleet, and defeated him in single combat. Although his defeat, Woves said that she would never be their true leader without the Darksaber. Djarin presented the blade to her, over her initial objections, asserting that her actions on Mandalore meant she was the rightful owner of the blade. The assembled Mandalorians accepted her ownership, recognizing her as the rightful wielder.[19]\n\nDuring the reconquest of Mandalore launched as a joint operation between the Children of the Watch and Kryze's followers to reclaim Mandalore, Kryze wielded the Darksaber, coming to use it in battle once it was discovered Moff Gideon was using Mandalore as a base for his Imperial remnant. The Darksaber's hilt was heavily, if not irreparably, damaged by Gideon using the grip of his strength-enhancing armor, leaving it abandoned on the ground before the destruction of his base.[6]\n\nThough it had originally been intended for Pre Vizsla to fight using a vibroblade, a familiar weapon in the Star Wars Expanded Universe, the weapon was later altered at the request of George Lucas who opposed to the idea that a non-lightsaber can block a lightsaber and came up with an archaic, one of a kind black-bladed saber called the Darksaber.[33][34]\n\nThe Darksaber first appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"The Mandalore Plot,\"[2] which premiered on Cartoon Network on January 29, 2010.[35]\n\nIn an interview with The Star Wars Show, Sam Witwer explained that the production of Solo: A Star Wars Story originally planned to reintroduce Maul's original lightsaber during his scene with Qi'ra. Witwer suggested using either the Darksaber or his Rebels lightsaber. Ultimately, the latter was chosen for the film.[36] The saber made its live-action debut in the eighth episode of the 2019 Disney+ television show Star Wars: The Mandalorian, wielded by the series' antagonist Moff Gideon played by Giancarlo Esposito.[9] For The Mandalorian Season Two, Esposito wielded the Darksaber in combat as Gideon and ended up breaking the props he was given several times.[32]",
