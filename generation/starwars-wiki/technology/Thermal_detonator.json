  "content": "Thermal detonators, also known as thermal charges or thermal devices, were palm-sized, spherical devices that were used as extremely deadly explosive weapons.\n\nA military-grade weapon, a thermal detonator[3]—alternatively known as a thermal charge[12] or thermal device[13]—was a grenade-like explosive that held a great amount of power for a small sphere[3] that fit within someone's palm.[5] While identified as a grenade-like weapon,[3] they could be called grenades as a shorthand.[14] In addition to being surprisingly powerful for their size, they could only be deactivated by whomever turned them on.[15] They would only explode when they were activated, and therefore a secure and stable weapon to carry.[16] They could also be programmed to explode after a set amount of time.[6]\n\nMost thermal detonators contained baradium, a highly unstable chemical compound that could blow a two-meter-deep hole in pure permacite. The chemical compound was so unstable that, in certain situations, some detonators have exploded after being accidentally dropped to the ground. This, was due to them having been exposed to too much heat or manipulated harshly. The power of the thermal detonator made it highly sought-after in the criminal underground, which made its price climb to 2,000 credits on the black market.[6]\n\nThroughout the galaxy, thermal detonators were used by militaries and bounty hunters.[3] All the same, their usage was heavily regulated, and owning one illegally could earn its owner the capital punishment in many star systems.[6] An actively beeping thermal detonator was an effective way to quickly clear people out of a tavern.[17] At one point in galactic history, a V-1 Thermal Detonator sank within a body of water.[18]\n\nIn 382 BBY during the High Republic Era,[20] as a path to peace emerged during the Eiram and E'ronoh War through the possible union of Eirami Prince Phan-tu Zenn and E'roni Princess Xiri A'lbaran, a delegation from Eiram attended the funeral of Jerrod Segaru on E'ronoh, where the radical Children of E'ronoh threw rocks at the visiting Eirami. Afterward, Eirami Queen Adrialla voiced her fear that such protesters would move from rocks to thermal detonators, and then to even worse weapons, yet the wedding preparations continued on until completion.[21] Later that year[20] during the so-called Night of Sorrow, as the Path of the Closed Fist cult fought against members of the Jedi Order, cult leader Elecia Zeveron provided Littles Boolan and Utalir with thermal detonators and told them to plant the explosives across the Path caves, claiming she would drop rocks upon the Jedi. In reality, she intended to escape and destroy the Path, who would become martyrs as she left to continue her rise to power. While fellow Little Tromak was too scared to agree to plant the bombs, Boolan and Utalir carried on their mission until the intervention of cousins Marda Ro and Yana Ro, who prevented their actions.[13]\n\nDeprived of the charges, Boolan ran off into the caves repeating the Path mantra[13] and would later emerge as a major enemy of the Jedi during his adult life.[22] Alternatively, Utalir—who, unknown to all, was Force-sensitive—was targeted by one of the Nameless until the intervention of the cousins, who demanded she return to the surface. After Marda revealed Zeveron's duplicity to fellow Path leader Werth Plouth, who was mortified she would use the Littles to carry out her plot, Marda, who had grown disgusted of the Nameless as the battle dragged on, gathered the Nameless in one place with the Rod of Power and ordered Yana to activate the thermal charges with a detonator Marda had claimed from Zeveron. The explosion opened cracks in the caves that allowed water to rush in, causing a flood that swept away and drowned the Nameless, with the exception of the Leveler. Marda herself was caught in the flood but survived.[13] The explosion, however, had[17] the unintended[13] effect of collapsing the cave system, flooding and destroying the Path's underground network.[17]\n\nBetween 252 BBY and 242 BBY,[23] Lourna Dee, the former princess of the planet Aaloth, mined the hold her own ship, the Tycoon Trader, with thermal detonators as a trap for the Nihil pirates. After defeating the boarding Nihil party, Dee herself would join the organization and eventually arise to become one of its Tempest Runners.[8] In 232 BBY,[20] after confirming her friend Geode knew of people who could sell such weapons, Affie Hollow used a thermal detonator against the Nihil during the mission on the Amaxine station. The weapon's weight had felt strange in her hand due to the danger it posed and how unfamiliar she was with actually using one, yet she resolved to use it in order to save her friends. To use it, she set it to ten seconds and threw it against an airlock being used by the boarding Nihil.[24] During the Battle of Galov[8] of 231 BBY,[20] Dee would fake her death for a time by disguising the droid H7-09 in her armor, which she also placed a thermal charge within.[8] The former Nihil Krix Kamerat had created the latch-on thermal detonator[25] by 228 BBY[26] and plotted to use one against Ro at a supposed peace summit. Indeed throwing the weapon once Ro rejected Kamerat's attempt to rejoin the Nihil, Kamerat's plan was ruined when one of Ro's She'ar bodyguards, Arathab Fal, took the blow for Ro and rushed Kamerat, who was killed alongside Fal in the explosion.[25] In 200 BBY,[20] the bounty hunter Sun Xi wielded a fake detonator, which he threw in the presence of Jedi Padawan Sean. Initially assuming the hunter had thrown a real detonator, Sean would instead be faced with it playing the popular Huttese song Joh Blastoh as one of the ways Xi tried to taunt him.[27]\n\nIn the late Republic Era,[20] the clone troopers of the Republic Military carried N-20 Baradium-core thermal detonators on their persona via the belts of their clone trooper armor.[7] Clones also had access to Class-A thermal detonators for use,[28] as did the B1-series battle droids[9] and BX-series droid commandos of the Separatist Droid Army.[29] The Duros bounty hunter Cad Bane carried thermal detonators.[10]\n\nDuring the Battle of Kamino, maintenance duty clone 99 gathered Class-A thermal detonators and ammunition to help his clone brothers defend their homeworld. Reaching clone troopers Echo and Fives during their defense of a bridge area, 99 and the two troopers were quickly ambushed by a group of B1 battle droids, only for 99 to reveal the thermal detonators he had brought with him. Echo quickly used one of 99's thermal detonators to wipe out the droids. Later, as 99 helped his clone brothers prepare to defend a barracks, he gathered more Class-A thermal detonators from a nearby armory with Clone Commander Cody and Clone Captain Rex, who applauded 99's quick thinking. During their defense, Cody and Rex were supplied with these Class-As by 99 to use against an invading B1 group. When Cody was handed their final detonator by Rex, who urged his comrade to make the grenade count, 99 rushed to gather more explosives. The B1s took advantage of 99's appearance out in the open and successfully shot the maintenance duty clone, whose death saddened Rex, Cody, Fives, and Echo. The four would remember 99 as a true soldier.[14]\n\nThe stormtroopers of the Galactic Empire used thermal detonators,[3] with stormtrooper armor retaining the N-20 detonator[31] once carried by clone troopers.[3] The bounty hunter Caij Vanda carried a thermal detonator on her person.[30] In 9 BBY,[32] Vanda found herself cornered by fellow bounty hunter Boba Fett, who was hunting her for a bounty on her head, and surviving Jedi Knight Cal Kestis, whom she had just betrayed in an effort to claim his own bounty. Vanda threatened both men by pulling out her thermal detonator, but Kestis managed to use the Force to tear it from her grasp and threw it away before it exploded.[30]\n\nPrincess Leia Organa, disguised as the bounty hunter Boushh, threatened the crime lord Jabba the Hutt with a Class-A thermal detonator in order to negotiate a deal.[5] The pirate gang called the Warbird gang use the thermal detonators to lure out the jakoosk to hunt it down, and feed the people of the Colossus.[11]\n\nThermal detonators first appeared in the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, the first installment of the Star Wars original trilogy.[31] They were first identified in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, the final installment of the trilogy.[5]\n\nIn the Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi television series, the thermal detonator used by Tala Durith took inspiration from the one held by Leia Organa in Return of the Jedi. Propmaster Brad Elliott bought a Master Replicas thermal detonator and then dismantled it. His team rewired the electronics to behave the way director Deborah Chow wanted it to work in the series. Elliott found that using real merchandise was more efficient than having to resculpt, remold, and repaint something new.[33] The hero version was interactive and could light up.[34]",
