  "content": "Beskar, also known as Mandalorian iron or Mandalorian steel, was an alloy that was used in Mandalorian armor and was notable for its high tolerance to extreme forms of damage. In its purest forms, the metal was durable enough to withstand a direct blaster shot and could repel lightsaber strikes. A superweapon created by the Mandalorian Sabine Wren and used by the Galactic Empire, called the Arc Pulse Generator, was capable of superheating the metal to the point that it would burn everything it was protecting to a crisp, such as Mandalorian warriors encased within their beskar armor. However, Wren destroyed her weapon during the Mandalorian Civil War.\n\nBeskar in its pure form[6] was one of the toughest and most legendary metals in the galaxy.[2] The purest form of beskar[10] was capable of repelling the strikes of a lightsaber[1] for brief amounts of time,[10] and could withstand direct blaster fire.[11][12][13][14] Pure beskar could still be damaged by weapons also made out of beskar; because of this, making weapons out of beskar was considered illegal by the Children of the Watch.[9] The metal could also be reforged to any warrior's liking.[2] Beskar was found only on Mandalorian worlds. In ingot form, beskar was silver with wavy patterns.[10]\n\nBeskar was a material used by the various groups,[16] clans[17] and houses[18] of Mandalore's people, such as the clans Wren, Vizsla,[2] Saxon,[19] and Kryze; and the Nite Owls,[2] as well as the Children of the Watch. \"The Armorer\" used a cryo-furnace, magnetic tongs, and a gravity hammer in her workshop to forge armor from beskar.[20] Her tools were made from beskar, and were able to repel strikes from the Darksaber.[9] The Mandalorian method for forging beskar was a closely guarded secret, a skill passed on through generations to keep ancient armor intact and impervious.[21]\n\nAccording to Mandalorians, all beskar belonged to them,[13] but, over the course of history, many other parties claimed it.[20] It was also used for weapons, such as in spears,[9] cudgel blades,[22] traditional beskad swords, kal daggers,[8] munit'kad halberds,[7] and the hilt of the Darksaber. Beskar weapons were considered taboo by the Children of the Watch, as they could injure or kill other Mandalorians that had beskar armor.[9] Beskar plates were also used to reinforce strength-enhancing gloves known as crushgaunts that were capable of shattering bones as well as turning the blade of a lightsaber.[8] On the planet Ferrix, citizens tracked time by the ringing of a beskar anvil that was ritually struck by the Time Grappler.[23]\n\nIn the days of the Old Republic, Tarre Vizsla created the Darksaber, and its hilt was made from beskar.[9] Due to its unique properties, beskar was used to forge armor capable of repelling Jedi lightsabers during the Mandalorian-Jedi War.[1] Armor forged from beskar was used as early as 500 BBY.[2] Before joining the Nihil, the future Tempest Runner Lourna Dee took part in bar fights while wearing beskar armor, making her appear Mandalorian whenever her lekku were not exposed.[24]\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Death Watch[16] continued to use beskar for their armor.[10] Members of Death Watch continued using their armor when their faction split in two; one portion of Death Watch became part of Maul's Shadow Collective as the Mandalorian super commandos, while another banded under Lady Bo-Katan Kryze to become the Mandalore resistance.[25] During her time with the resistance, former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano was given a Mandalorian-designed combat outfit with beskar plates.[26]\n\nAt some point in the Clone Wars, the assassin Ochi of Bestoon had a deadblade made of beskar. On Sidious's orders, he attempted to assassinate Depa Billaba on Malathon IX but was disarmed of the blade by Mace Windu.\n\nBeskar was among the profitable cargoes recommended to fellow smugglers by Platt Okeefe in the pirate Maz Kanata's Smuggler's Guide, along with corusca gems, quella gems, and prismatic crystals.[27] An Arcona bounty hunter wore a set of beskar armor.[28] Enfys Nest had beskar gauntlets.[29]\n\nWhile a cadet at the Imperial Academy of Mandalore, Sabine Wren constructed the Arc Pulse Generator. Invented as a challenge, the \"Duchess\" was designed to target the beskar in Mandalorian armor and heat it up to the point where it got so hot that it vaporized the wearer. Upon realizing that the Galactic Empire had tested the weapon on her own people and intended to keep using it, Wren sabotaged the weapon, destroyed the plans, and fled, eventually joining up with the Spectres, a band of rebels who later became part of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Although Wren believed she had destroyed her weapon, the Empire salvaged and rebuilt it, although they were unable to restore it to its full power. Rumors spread that the Empire had tested such a weapon, but there was never confirmation among other Mandalorian clans that the Duchess was real.[2]\n\nEventually, a civil war broke out after Clan Wren rebelled against Clan Saxon, which had been placed in power by the Emperor, and Governor Tiber Saxon attempted to use the Arc Pulse Generator, fitting it onto the AT-DP Arc Cannon Prototype. After Grand Admiral Thrawn suggested that Saxon capture Wren to restore the weapon to its full capacity, Saxon laid a trap for Wren and the Mandalorian resistance aboard his Star Destroyer. However, Wren and Bo-Katan Kryze destroyed the weapon for good after Wren reprogrammed it to target the plastoid in stormtrooper armor, and the weapon's detonation also killed Saxon.[2]\n\nDuring the Great Purge of Mandalore, the Empire took beskar[3] as spoils[20] after killing the majority of the Mandalorians.[30] After the fall of the Empire, beskar was harder to come by.[31] In 9 ABY, an Imperial known as \"the Client\" gave bounty hunter Din Djarin a piece of the beskar imprinted with the Imperial crest taken from the Mandalorians during the purge, which he then used to forge a new shoulder plate for himself and gave the excess to the Armorer for future foundlings.[3] Later, after capturing a child of the same species as Jedi Grand Master Yoda, the Client gave a camtono of beskar to Djarin in payment. He then used the Beskar to forge a new set of armor for himself and once again gave the excess to The Tribe's foundlings.[20] Morgan Elsbeth had in her possession a beskar spear which she used in combat against Ahsoka Tano. The spear was then gifted to Din Djarin after the liberation of Calodan.[6] The spear was later reforged into armor for Grogu, as the armorer considered it dangerous to Mandalorians.[9]\n\nGideon later created the next-generation armor for the Dark Trooper from beskar alloy.[5] The former Imperial Sentinel, who played the part of a loyal stormtrooper in the Hunters of the Outer Rim competition,[32] owned a suit of beskar snowtrooper armor identified as the \"Beskar Buckethead\" suit. Sentinel claimed to deserve the armor and remarked that it felt very good.[33]\n\nThe name \"beskar\" originated in the Star Wars Legends article The Mandalorians: People and Culture, published in Star Wars Insider in 2006 and written by Karen Traviss.[34] Before that, it was known as Mandalorian iron. It was first introduced unnamed, in the form of Mandalorian manacles, in the Legends comic Tales of the Jedi 5,[35] and was later named Mandalorian iron in the comic Freedon Nadd Uprising.[36]\n\nBoba Fett's armor was previously stated to be made of durasteel.[37] However, \"Chapter 14: The Tragedy\" of The Mandalorian retconned the Fett armor into being made of beskar.[38]",
