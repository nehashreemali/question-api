  "content": "Wookiees, known in their own language of Shyriiwook as \"the People of the Trees,\" were a species of tall, hairy humanoids that were native to the planet Kashyyyk. A notable member of this species was the warrior Chewbacca, Han Solo's best friend and co-pilot, who played a vital role in the Clone Wars during the Battle of Kashyyyk, the Galactic Civil War by aiding the Rebel Alliance in their fight against the Galactic Empire, and the war against the First Order. They were quite strong, and were known to rip people's arms out of their sockets when provoked. Though being from a temperate planet known for its swamps and forests, Wookiees were perfectly comfortable on icy worlds like Ilum and Hoth, not requiring any additional protective clothing, i.e. gloves or boots.\n\nWookiees were a tall species of furry humanoids from the planet Kashyyyk, who could grow to a height of nearly three meters.[10] They were covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of hair with water-shedding properties[1] that notably came in shades of brown,[4] black,[5] gray, and white. The species had two sexes, female[6] and male. The latter grew long beards in adult life.[11] The average male weighed 150 kilograms while the average female weighed 100 kilograms.[1] The Wookiees' eye color ranged from blue[4] to brown.[7] Wookiees were big eaters, with the average adult requiring 3,500-6,000 calories a day of food.[12] Their diet consisted of wild plants, berries, meat, and spices. They preferred their spices to be hot.[1]\n\nWhile Wookiees did not like eating blosphi extract, it provided them with enough nutrition to survive.[13] The \"Wookiee flu\" was a sickness that affected Wookiees. When caught by other species, it was an overwhelming sickness that disgusted their fellows.[14] The literary collective term for Wookiees was a grove of Wookiees.[15] Many of their kind were known to understand Galactic Basic but were unable to speak it due to their species' vocal structure.[16]\n\nWookiees had extendable claws which they used for climbing; using them for anything else violated the Wookiee honor code.[17] Despite their fearsome appearance and volatile temperament, Wookiees were regarded as intelligent, sophisticated, loyal and trusting. When angered, Wookiees were known to descend into a berserker rage.[10] Wookiees had an average lifespan of 400 standard years,[1] and they appeared not to age over a span of fifty years.[18] Their lifespans dramatically decreased due to the harsh working conditions in the spice mines of Kessel.[19] During their prime growing years, Wookiees were often hungry, forcing them to eat whenever they could.[20] One Wookiee, Lohgarra, lived healthily for centuries—the only distinction being her white fur.[6]\n\nThey could learn to understand other languages, like Galactic Basic Standard, but they were physically unable to speak them[21] due to their strange vocal chords that prevented them from speaking verbal languages.[1] To those who had not learned to understand Shyriiwook, the Wookiee language,[21] it appeared they spoke in a series of growls and purrs. Although a rare phenomenon, Force-sensitive Wookiees were possible, and some joined the ranks of the Jedi, becoming a source of great pride for their people.[22] Such Wookiees included the Jedi Master Kelnacca,[23] Jedi Master Arkoff,[24] Jedi Knight Burryaga Agaburry,[20] Jedi Master Tyvokka,[25] and the youngling Gungi.[22]\n\nWookiees originated on the Mid Rim forest planet of Kashyyyk. In the ancient past, they invented and crafted weapons that fired poisoned darts and arrows.[19] During the Clone Wars and the reign of King Grakchawwaa,[27] the Wookiees remained fiercely loyal to the Galactic Republic and fought alongside them in several star systems.[11] Towards the end of the conflict, Wookiee forces also defended their homeworld from a Separatist invasion with the help of Galactic Republic forces led by Jedi Master Yoda, who had good relations with them.[26]\n\nAt the end of the Clone Wars, numerous Wookiees were slaughtered by the clone troopers they allied with in the ensuing chaos of the anti-Jedi Order 66,[26] and soon after the establishment of the Galactic Empire, their homeworld of Kashyyyk was blockaded by the Empire. The softening and repeal of anti-slavery laws ultimately led to the Empire classifying the Wookiees as non-sentient.[29] The Empire enslaved the Wookiees not because they were a meaningful threat to the Empire but because their massive, robust physiology allowed them to work long and hard in extreme conditions.[30]\n\nAs a result, many Wookiees were enslaved and made to build much of the Imperial war machine,[30] sent to be worked to death in the dangerous spice mines of the planet Kessel,[11] or on construction sites such as the Death Star, though a number escaped this fate.[31] Numerous Wookiees were bred for use in medical experimentation, and some were used as playthings for Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck, Imperial governor of Kashyyyk, who occasionally hunted live Wookiees for sport.[30]\n\nTo keep them in line, all of the Wookiees on Kashyyyk were fitted with inhibitor chips that caused them great pain if activated. The Empire also quickly learned the most efficient way of preventing any wide-scale uprisings was by threatening clan and family members, particularly the younglings. Normally, a Wookiee would quite willingly rip a stormtrooper limb from limb regardless of their own safety, but could not bear to see other Wookiees subjected to the agony instead.[30]\n\nDespite these grave circumstances for their race, the Wookiees nonetheless found ways to help others. In the early days of the Empire, the Outer Rim planet of Lasan, home to the Lasat, was brutally sacked and devastated by the Empire for daring to question the new regime. Unable to stand by and watch, many Wookiees went to Lasan and fought the Empire with weapons forged from the wroshyr trees of their homeworld, in many cases giving their own lives to save the Lasats. Because of their actions, a few Lasats (including Garazeb Orrelios) were able to escape the genocide and survive in the wider galaxy.\n\nIn 14 BBY, Wookiees who were being held prisoner by the Empire and forced to work at an Imperial refinery in Kashyyyk, were freed by the Partisans led by Saw Gerrera and the Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis, who joined them during the attack on the refinery. Kestis went to Kashyyyk in search of Tarfful, a Wookiee chieftain he believed might have information that could be useful in his mission to rebuild the Jedi Order. Kestis left the world while the Partisans searched for Tarfful and returned when he was informed they had found him. Tarfful told Kestis to search the top of the Origin Tree, where he figured out where to go.[28]\n\nDuring the Age of the Empire, the-then Commodore Thrawn and Lieutenant Commander Eli Vanto discovered evidence that the Empire was transporting enslaved Wookiees after responding to a distress transmission from the troop transport Sempre. The Wookiee slaves were liberated by a task force consisting of the frigate Castilus and two squadrons of V-19 Torrent starfighters, which then attacked the space station Lansend Twenty-Six, where more Wookiee slaves were held. Thrawn commanded the operation to reinforce Baklek Base and forced the insurgents to surrender. When Vanto objected to slavery, Thrawn tried to rationalize the Empire's enslavement of Wookiees.[32]\n\nAbout fourteen years after the establishment of the Empire,[11] the 212th Attack Battalion led by General Kahdah quelled a Wookiee revolt on Kashyyyk. Civilian travel to the planet was restricted and access was granted only for official government business.[33] Shortly later, the Empire transported several captives including Wullffwarro and his son Kitwarr to the spice mines of Kessel. The Spectres, a rebel cell based on the Outer Rim world of Lothal, rescued the prisoners and escaped Kessel.[34]\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, several Wookiees, including Chewbacca[4] and Lohgarra, fought for the Alliance to Restore the Republic[6] and its successor government, the New Republic.[31] One year following the Battle of Endor, the Wookiee homeworld had become an Imperial remnant known as Imperial territory G5-623 led by Grand Moff Tolruck. Kashyyyk was later liberated by the New Republic forces. Working with a group of rebels led by Han Solo and Chewbacca, the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus, used a hyperspace transceiver to neutralize Tolruck's inhibitor chips. This enabled the Wookiees to rise up en-masse against the Imperial occupiers and take their well-earned revenge, with Grand Moff Tolruck himself being killed by his personal slave, Cracktooth. The Imperial forces attempted to orbital bombard Kashyyyk but were defeated by a New Republic fleet led by Leia Organa and Admiral Ackbar.[30]\n\nWookiee and New Republic forces then conducted mopping-up operations against the remaining Imperial holdouts on Kashyyyk. During one of these skirmishes, Chewbacca reunited with his son, Lumpawaroo, who had escaped from a slave labor camp run by Commandant Dessard.[35]\n\nDuring the New Republic era, Kashyyyk's forests including the Black Forest grew back. Many Wookiees including Chewbacca and Chief Karasshki lived in villages. About two years after the Battle of Jakku, the rogue Pau'an surgeon Fyzen Gor began kidnapping and killing Wookiee younglings to use as spare parts for his droid followers, the Original Dozen. Due to his shadowy appearance, he earned the nickname the \"Long Man.\" Chewbacca agreed to help Han Solo and Lando Calrissian retrieve the Phylanx Redux Transmitter in return recovering the limbs of the murdered Wookiees for funeral rites.[36]\n\nThe name for their species was known to translate[16] from Shyriiwook into Galactic Basic Standard[37] literally as \"the People of the Trees\".[16] Living in a great harmony with the nature of Kashyyyk,[38] the Wookiees placed great value upon the wroshyr trees of their home planet; they considered the mighty trees the true owners of the land, themselves merely coexisting with them, and would consult them before every battle by bowing their heads against their wood to listen to their wisdom.[39]\n\nWookiees were expert craftsmen who blended off-world technology like blasters and lightsabers with traditional materials such as wood, precious stones, and metals.[1] Most Wookiees carried bowcasters as weaponry, which were handcrafted.[19]Chewbacca's bowcaster broke Wookiee tradition due to its automatic cocking system. Wookiees believed that seeing a can-cell brought good luck, and Wookiees often kept them as pets.[1] The Wookiee people by and large hated Trandoshans, great hunters[40] who turned their talents against the Wookiees and hunted them.[41] The highest way a Wookiee could compliment someone was to groom them.[6] Wookiees were not known to be subtle.[42]\n\nIn Wookiee society, loyalty and courage were valued as sacrosanct tenets.[10] It was typical for Wookiees to value honor and friendship above all else.[19] It was considerably rare to find Wookiees with criminal tendencies.[43] When male Wookiees turned 12 years old, they would undergo initiation rituals to enter adulthood. Wookiees spoke three languages: Shyriiwook, Thykarann, and Xaczik.[1] Shyriiwook had 150 words for \"wood\"[19] but no word for \"artist\" because Wookiees viewed their carving skills as a survival skill and not a talent.[44]\n\nWookiees were referred to as mongrels by others.[46] Notable Wookiees included Chewbacca, the navigator and long-time companion of Han Solo.[18] Other noteworthy Wookiees included the chief and general Tarfful (who fought alongside Master Yoda during the Battle of Kashyyyk),[26] the warrior Wullffwarro, and his son Kitwarr.[34] Force-sensitive Wookiees included the Jedi Master Arkoff,[24]Jedi Master Kelnacca, and Jedi Padawan Burryaga Agaburry, all of whom lived in the High Republic Era,[20] as well as the Jedi youngling Gungi, who lived during the Clone Wars.[22] During the Age of the Empire, Krrsantan was a Wookiee who worked as a bounty hunter for both Jabba the Hutt and Darth Vader.[5]\n\nThe first Wookiee Leia Organa ever met was a guest at one of Senator Bail Prestor Organa's state dinners, with the Wookiee leaving an impression on the young Leia.[47] Drokkatta was a Wookiee who served in the Coruscant rebel cell.[48] The Wookiee Greybok played an important role in turning the tide of the Battle on Sevarcos by freeing several rancors, which rampaged the Imperial lines.[31] He later took part in Han Solo and Chewbacca's campaign to liberate Kashyyyk.[30] While serving as a senator in the New Republic's Galactic Senate, Leia Organa once saw two Wookiee commuters in front of her on an automated sidewalk at the New Republic senatorial complex on Hosnian Prime.[49]\n\nThe word \"Wookiee\" originated in George Lucas's first movie, THX 1138, in a line ad-libbed by actor Terry McGovern: \"I think I just ran over a Wookiee.\"[50] A Wookiee later appeared through Chewbacca in the first Star Wars film.[4]\n\nIn the rough draft of the script for A New Hope, Wookiees (spelt \"Wookees\") inhabit Yavin and fly some of the starfighters in the Battle of Yavin.[51] According to  Much to Learn You Still Have: 8 Things You Might Not Know About Wookiees on StarWars.com (backup link), in early drafts of the script for Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, the second Death Star was to be built in orbit around Kashyyyk and the construction would be done by Wookiee laborers,[44] but Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays and The Making of Return of the Jedi contradict this, instead saying that Ewoks and the forest moon of Endor were present in George Lucas's earliest notes and scripts for Return of the Jedi while Kashyyyk and Wookiees other than Chewbacca were never present.[51][52]\n\nThe Wookiees also appeared in the non-canon LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures episode \"Peril on Kashyyyk,\" which premiered on Disney XD on June 27, 2016. In the episode, the scavenging Freemakers family helps Chief Attiburra rescue his son Tantarra from a Trandoshan island fortress.[53]",
