  "content": "Trandoshans, also called T'doshok, were large, bipedal reptilian sentient humanoids from the planet Trandosha, and were renowned as great hunters. Trandoshans relished the thrill of a hunt, and were known to embark on a hunting related rite of passage. They were also famous for their ability to regenerate limbs and heal effectively. Garnac was a Trandoshan hunter who operated a game preserve on the moon Wasskah, and oversaw his son's fatally failed rite of passage, which was done in the form of hunting a Jedi Padawan. One of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy was a Trandoshan known as Bossk, who pulled jobs for various organizations, including the Galactic Empire. Other notable Trandoshans included the Jedi Master Sskeer and the information broker and cantina owner Ciddarin Scaleback.\n\nTrandoshans were sentient humanoids with smooth, scaly skin. Trandoshans ranged from being tall and fairly gaunt, to being short and more rotund. Trandoshans were powerful beings, and had long thin arms that ended in either three thick digits, or four thin digits, including a thumb. Trandoshans had a pair of eyes set back on a pointed skull, and a jaw filled with pointed teeth.[1] Some Trandoshans even had a crown of feathers atop their skulls.[12] They hatched from eggs, with individuals who shared a hatch of eggs calling each other clutchmates.[13] Trandoshans used their sharp claws to climb tall trees in the forest or jungles they naturally inhabited.[9]\n\nThe base urges of a Trandoshan brain included rage, fury, and aggression, but a Trandoshan could rise above those tendencies. However, the rare Magrak Syndrome would bring them back out over time.[14] Trandoshans often walked barefooted, and had feet with three digits each. A Trandoshan's skin color could vary wildly, and Trandoshans could be found with green, red, orange, brown, or yellow skin. Some Trandoshans, such as one named Smug, had brownish-orange skin with red stripes on his face.[15] They were able to regrow their limbs if they were severed[16] and regrow lost scales. However, a plasma blast could prove so damaging that a Trandoshan's scales were never able to regrow.[17]\n\nTrandoshans came from the planet Trandosha[1] in the Kashyyyk system of the Mid Rim Territories Mytaranor sector.[18] As a people, they were hunting enthusiasts,[1] tracking down creatures such as frist wolves[19] and even other sentients.[5] They worshiped a goddess called the Scorekeeper.[20] The Trandoshans would also assume control over Wasskah,[5] a moon of their homeworld.[9] The Trandoshans shared their star system[18] with the planet Kashyyyk, homeworld of the Wookiees,[21] whom the Trandoshans would come to hunt[22] and battle in a long-standing, interspecies conflict.[23]\n\nThe hunter Garnac had control of the island hunting preserve designated as Island Four on Wasskah by the time of the Clone Wars. He ran a hunting guild based out of a floating fortress above the island. Garnac's scouts traveled to different worlds and collect other sentient beings before delivering them to Wasskah and dumping them on Island Four, where the prisoners would be hunted for sport. During the Clone Wars, at least three Jedi younglings had been captured and brought to Wasskah. For a long time, the trio of younglings managed to avoid the Trandoshans, who continued to deliver other prey to the island. Eventually, the Trandoshan Lo-Taren captured the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano on the planet Felucia and brought her to island four alongside several other prisoners. Once delivered to the island, Tano escaped and discovered the other younglings.[5]\n\nGarnac's son, Dar, later set out to kill Tano himself as part of an important rite of passage, but was instead killed by the Jedi. Garnac gave chase, killing the youngling Kalifa.[5] Later, other Trandoshan scouts abducted the Wookiee Chewbacca, but before Chewbacca could be successfully delivered, the Trandoshan transport ship was damaged and it crashed on the hunting island. Tano killed the two man crew, and escaped the wreckage with Chewbacca. The Wookiee was able to craft a communications device with some of the scavenged wreckage, and was able to contact the Wookiee General Tarfful. Tano, the remaining younglings, and the Wookiee forces engaged Garnac's guild on their fortress, and killed all of the Trandoshan hunters.[15] However, Garnac was the only one to survive the confrontation and ultimately came under the service of the gangster Grini Millegi on Serolonis.[24]\n\nMeanwhile, the bounty hunter Bossk took on numerous jobs, and eventually acted as a bodyguard to the upcoming bounty hunter Boba Fett. In time, Bossk would be revered as one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy. On one occasion, Bossk visited the planet Lothal to collect a bounty on the Dug criminal Gronson Takkaro. This brought him into contact with the young Force-sensitive human youth Ezra Bridger and into conflict with the corrupt Imperial Security Bureau Lieutenant Jenkes, who was in league with Takkaro. With the help of Bridger, Bossk succeeded in exposing Jenkes' criminal dealings.[25]\n\nDuring the Imperial Era, five Trandoshans were part of an acquisition crew working for the Xonti Brothers. Led by Noka, they went to Kashyyyk to capture Wookiees. Kootan was keen to kill one but Noka reminded him of the job at hand. Noka used his scanner to locate a Wookiee and they found one which was sleeping. Kootan shot a stun at it to realize it was bleeding and left for dead. The Trandoshans then found themselves under attack by Krrsantan who killed the other three Trandoshans and pinned down Noka and Kootan. Kootan tried to kill Krrsantan and was knocked out by the Wookiee before being thrown into a tree, killing him. Krrsantan then demanded that Noka brought him to the Xonti Brothers. Noka did so and lived on to tell his story to two journalists.[26]\n\nFeresk Tssat served as a member of the New Republic's Vanguard Squadron during the Galactic Civil War following the Battle of Endor, and fought against the Galactic Empire's Titan Squadron.[27]\n\nThe species had a poor history with the Wookiees, who hated the reptilian people.[28] Indeed, the tense Separatist Crisis period of galactic history saw the port authorities of Coruscant Eastern Spaceport regularly step into disputes between Trandoshans and Wookiees.[29] Some Trandoshans found other outlets for work, as opposed to hunting. By the time of the Clone Wars one was Gha Nachkt, who lived life as a salvager. He was eventually hired by the Confederacy of Independent Systems to scour the sites of damaged ships owned by the Galactic Republic and find any useful data or scraps. Nachkt eventually recovered the R2-series astromech droid R2-D2 from a Republic Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor, but the droid was eventually recovered by the Jedi General and Knight Anakin Skywalker, while Nachkt was killed by Confederate General Grievous.[30]\n\nTrandoshan Jedi were rare because the culture of their homeworld was the opposite of that of the Jedi. One notable Force-sensitive Trandoshan was Sskeer, who lived during the High Republic Era.[31] Sskeer was a Jedi Master, who was renowned as both a scholar and tactician. His Padawan was the human Keeve Trennis.[32] Sskeer saw action against the Nihil pirates and carnivorous dark side sentient plants known as the Drengir.[33][32] However, Magrak Syndrome took root in his brain, which limited his connection to the Force[14] but therefore spared him the effects of the Nameless.[34]\n\nOther Trandoshans during the High Republic era were the Ganguls pirate gang leader Sellaccc Orryak and her nephew Daynaal.[35] Orryak took over the pirate stronghold Yarrum Tower[36] and later attempted to destroy the Tenoo Jedi Temple during the Battle of Tenoo.[37] Daynaal, however, rejected his aunt's piratical ways and foiled her plot to sabotage an upcoming Life Day feast.[35] The Trandoshan Sslanno, meanwhile, was a Nihil in Pan Eyta's Tempest who lost his scales in a plasma blast, which ended up being so damaging those scales never regrew.[17]\n\nThe Trandoshan Bossk's bounty hunting career brought him to various locales across the galaxy, and was for a time involved with the bounty hunters Aurra Sing and Castas. Bossk and Fett worked with the other bounty hunters in an attempt to avenge Fett's fallen father, Jango, by killing Mace Windu, the Jedi who fought and killed Jango. Sing later killed Castas, while Bossk and Fett were arrested by Republic authorities after a failed assassination. However, during a prison riot, both Bossk and Fett escaped the Republic prison they were sent to. They later formed a team of bounty hunters on the planet Tatooine and accept a job posted by the Belugan government on the planet Quarzite. Although Bossk was subdued by adversaries during the mission, team member Asajj Ventress was able to complete the mission, to a degree. When Ventress discovered that the cargo they were hired to protect was Pluma Sodi, a native Kage female, Ventress swapped the imprisoned girl with Fett, and was paid for the job's completion before the change was discovered.[38]\n\nNack Movers was a Trandoshan assassin who was well known in the Coruscant underworld, and at some point during the Clone Wars he bought a lightsaber. He was later murdered by his girlfriend, Ione Marcy, who then took the lightsaber for herself.[39]\n\nCiddarin Scaleback was a Trandoshan information broker and cantina owner who owned a parlor on Ord Mantell. Following the establishment of the Empire, Scaleback hired the services of a group of rogue Clone commandos known as the Bad Batch. In return for providing them with shelter and funds, Scaleback hired them as mercenaries for various missions including rescuing the rancor Muchi,[40] recovering the head of a tactical droid,[41] and the former Separatist senator Avi Singh. Scaleback also developed an affectionate relationship with the female adolescent clone Omega, helping her hone her potential as a tactician and dejarik player.[42] Scaleback and the Bad Batch gradually established a mutually beneficial relationship, with the latter helpiner her to reclaim her parlor from the Devaronian crime lord Roland Durand.[43]\n\nIn 1 BBY,[44] Trandoshans Seevor and Proach served the Mining Guild as captain and foreman respectively on the Ore crawler, Crawler 413-24, until they were both killed during the hijacking of the vessel by the rebel group known as the Spectres.[45] In 3 ABY,[46] Bossk encountered his long-presumed dead sister Doshanalawook, who wanted to usher in a new era of Wookiee-Trandoshan cooperation. While he promised to stop hunting Wookies during their meeting,[22] Bossek then accepted a job from the Galactic Empire to find the rebel freighter known as the Millennium Falcon, the crew of which included the Wookiee Chewbacca,[47] whom he was eager to slay.[48] He did not complete the job as he was beaten to it by the now adult Boba Fett.[47]\n\nThe Strassi family, crime family of Trandoshans, was part of Jabba the Hutt's criminal empire, with their leader, Dokk Strassi, serving as one of Jabba's captains. Following Jabba's death, in 4 ABY, Bib Fortuna,[49] the Hutt's majordomo,[50] took over the criminal empire, leading the Trandoshan family to break off and attempt to take his place, to no avail.[49] Additionally, the family became protectors of the city center and business districts of Mos Espa on Tatooine,[10] having an uneasy alliance with Fortuna.[51]\n\nBy 9 ABY,[52] during the era of the New Republic,[53] several Trandoshans served within the Bounty Hunters' Guild after the collapse of the Galactic Empire[54] in 5 ABY.[55] One of these bounty hunters accompanied Greef Karga, the leader of the guild, to meet with Din Djarin, a bounty hunter who had gone rogue after rescuing a child of the same species as Jedi Grand Master Yoda. After the group set up camp for the night, a group of native reptavians attacked them. One of these creatures picked up the Trandoshan with their feet and carried him off into the night.[54]\n\nWhen Boba Fett, who had retired from bounty hunting, overthrew Bib Fortuna and started his own gotra from the late Jabba's empire,[49] Strassi of the Trandoshan family paid tribute to the new Daimyo[10] and agreed to neutrality when the Pyke Syndicate challenged Fett's territories. In the meantime, some Trandoshan gamblers were attacked by Krrsantan in the Sanctuary cantina in Mos Espa. Despite the proprietor Garsa Fwip's intervention, Krrsantan ripped the one of the Trandoshan's arm off.[49] When the Pykes attacked Mos Espa, the Trandoshan family betrayed Fett and a number of them attacked Krrsantan, who was working for the Daimyo. Krrsantan killed a number of them and escaped, with Fett's assassin Fennec Shand going on to assassinate Strassi.[56] Also in 9 ABY,[52] the Trandoshan Charr was part of the Hunters of the Outer Rim competition.[57]\n\nA Trandoshan named Skreek worked for a gang of pirates under Kragan Gorr, the Warbird gang, in the late New Republic Era.[58] After Gorr allied his gang with the Colossus due to their mutual enemy in the First Order,[59] tensions rose between the pirates and Captain Imanuel Doza. In an effort to wrestle control of the Colossus from Doza, Skreek and his fellow pirates enlisted[60] a battalion[61] of B2-series super battle droids from pirate Sidon Ithano, only for the reprogrammed B1-series battle droid \"B1\" to take control of the force. Skreek and his fellow pirates were then exiled from the Colossus.[60]\n\nThe Trandoshan species first appeared in the 1980 movie Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back in the form of a cameo appearance by the bounty hunter Bossk. The Trandoshans also appeared in numerous Legends products including the Star Wars Marvel Comics, the Young Jedi Knights young adult novel series, and Dark Horse Comics' Knights of the Old Republic comics. The species have also appeared in several Canon products including the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Ryder Windham's young reader novella Ezra's Gamble, and the Marvel comic series Star Wars Darth Vader.\n\nTrandoshans have also appeared as the secondary antagonists of the non-Canon LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures episode \"Peril on Kashyyyk,\" which premiered on Disney XD on June 27, 2016. In this story, the Trandoshans and Wookiees are depicted as having an antagonistic relationship with the former acting as proxies for the Galactic Empire. The Trandoshans take Chief Attiburra's son Tantarra and hold him hostage in an island fortress. The Freemakers, a scavenging family, rescue him in return for obtaining a piece of wroshyr wood from the Wookiees.",
