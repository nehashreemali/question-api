  "content": "Rodians were reptilian humanoids native to the planet Rodia. During the Clone Wars, Rodia was represented by Senator Onaconda Farr in the Galactic Republic's senate. He briefly sided with the Trade Federation during the war, under the promise of food and protection from pirates. Rodia was betrayed, and fell back in line with the Republic. A number of Rodians acted as bounty hunters, including Greedo and Jakoli. Greedo was an amateur eventually killed by the smuggler Han Solo, while Jakoli was a skilled bounty hunter who only killed his targets. Some Rodians also worked as informants, such as Tsoklo, who worked for the Galactic Empire.\n\nRodians were a species of reptilian humanoids. They possessed large pupil-less eyes that could see in infrared spectrum.[14] Indeed, the Pantoran Kevmo Zink suspected the Rodians and his people saw different spectrums of light, but he was not sure what the exact divide was.[15] They also had twin saucer-like antennae that detected vibrations[14] and twitched[15] atop their head. Rodians had slender snouts, pointed ears, and a ridge of spines cresting their skulls.[14] Their snouts were said to resemble those of tapirs.[16]\n\nGreen—but sometimes red, yellow, or turquoise—scales covered their bodies, and their skin had a rough, pebbly texture, except on the snout and hands. They were cold blooded and had green blood.[17] Females were physically distinguished by their mammary glands, and some of them, like Greeata Jendowanian, were capable of growing long tresses.[18] The Rodian hand featured five long, dexterous fingers with suction cups at the ends.[14] The pads helped them cope with the variety of conditions associated with living in a swamp, and could be used to help them climb aquatic vegetation.[11] The shape of the Rodian hand, however, was as such that if an object was designed for their species, it would be uncomfortable for a human to use.[19] Their toes were a lot like their fingers: long and tipped by suction cups.[13]\n\nAlthough they were oxygen breathers, Rodians could breathe an air saturated with Clouzon-36 without the assistance of a respirator.[20] Rodians smelled rank to humans.[21]\n\nRodians spoke the languages Rodian[12] and Galactic Basic Standard.[6] Rodians greeted or showed respect to others with a salute consisting of an open-palmed hand across the chest, either with one or both arms. Before the Galactic Civil War, it was common for groups of Rodians to hunt ghests, slithering creatures that preyed on Rodians, though there were often casualties. Rodians were self-aware, and some Rodians used perfume to create a pleasant environment for humans.[21]\n\nRodia's jungles fostered an idealization of hunting in Rodian culture. Many unqualified rookies became bounty hunters to gain respect and accolades.[7]\n\nRodians evolved on the planet Rodia. At some point in their past, a faction of Rodians was known to have made war with another faction on Rodia. Eventually, one of the factions made a pilgrimage to the stars and created a settlement on Maldroth, where they used the stories of the war as a cautionary tale to promote peace amongst themselves.[22] The Rodians eventually joined the Galactic Republic and spread across the galaxy.[23] Jabba the Hutt, a crime lord, employed various Rodians as bounty hunters, including one named Greedo. Rodia eventually received representation in the Galactic Senate by means of Senator Onaconda Farr. He eventually made friends with Ruwee Naberrie, a senator from Naboo, and worked closely with him. Eventually, the senator's daughter,[24] Padmé Amidala, became the senator for Naboo.[25]\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Rodia's space vessels were attacked by pirates, leaving the Rodian people impoverished and starving for offworld food. Farr, distressed by his people's suffering, appealed to the Republic for aide, but received none. Desperate, he turned to the Trade Federation and made a deal with their viceroy, Nute Gunray, who was to deliver supplies to Rodia in exchange for control of the planet and Senator Amidala, who was an enemy of Gunray's. Amidala went to Rodia in an attempt to work out her own deal, but was captured by Gunray's battle droids. As the situation progressed, Farr had second thoughts and sided back with Amidala. Gunray was later fooled into thinking a Jedi was attacking his forces, who in actuality was the bumbling Gungan Jar Jar Binks. The viceroy admitted to Farr that he had brought no provisions for the Rodian people with him. Gunray was eventually arrested by the Republic,[6] only to escape at a later date.[26] Farr was later murdered during the war by his aide Lolo Purs, who blamed him for bringing the war to Rodia.[27]\n\nWhen Rodia was brought into the Galactic Empire's fold, many Rodians opposed the Empire and as such, many were recruited by the Alliance to Restore the Republic.[28] During the Galactic Civil War, the Betu continent of Rodia was ruled by the Chattza clan. It was opposed by the Chekkoo clan. Shortly after the Battle of Yavin, Luke Skywalker went on a mission to recruit the Chekkoo clan into the Rebel Alliance.[19] Rodia would go onto join the New Republic forged by the Rebellion after its great victory over the Empire at the Battle of Endor, with the Rodian Dor Wieedo representing the planet in the New Republic Senate by the time of the Battle of Jakku that formally ended the Galactic Civil War with Imperial defeat.[29]\n\nDuring the High Republic Era, a child Rodian named Hallisara was a Little within the Path of the Open Hand cult on the planet Dalna. While within the town of Ferdan with her fellow Littles under the care of Marda Ro, Hallisara met the Jedi Padawan Kevmo Zink, who let the child touch his lightsaber, although he was unsure if she would see the colors the same as him, before the cult learned he was a Force user.[15]\n\nGreedo was a Rodian bounty hunter active during both the Clone Wars[17] and the Galactic Civil War, who eventually met his end at the hands of Han Solo on the planet Tatooine.[31] Jakoli was a bounty hunter hired by Count Dooku during the Clone Wars, who died during a subsequent test in the Box.[32] Jakoli had a reputation of only taking assignments where he was allowed to kill his target.[7] Tsoklo was a Rodian who lived on the planet Lothal, and worked as a factory worker. He doubled as an informant working for the Galactic Empire, reporting to Supply Master Yogar Lyste on the activities of rule-breaking citizens or unproductive workers.[33] Some Rodians, like Bolla Ropal, were sensitive to the Force. Ropal was a Jedi Master who acted as the keeper of the Kyber memory crystal. He was murdered by the bounty hunter Cad Bane.[34] Another Rodian Jedi, Huulik, was killed as a result of Order 66.[19] At least one Rodian was a member of Enfys Nest's Cloud-Riders and fought alongside her on Savareen.[35]\n\nRodians also made it as far as Lothal, where a number of them worked for the Galactic Empire. Some of these Rodians lived in Lothal re-settlement camp 43, nicknamed \"Tarkintown,\" which housed farmers who had been dispossessed by the Empire.[36] Tseebo was a Rodian who worked for the Imperial Information Office,[37] although after stealing a large amount of Imperial data he tried to escape the Empire, and was eventually rescued by a band of rebels.[38] Another Lothal Rodian, Frid Kelio, played grav-ball for the AppSci SaberCats in Capital City.[39]\n\nRodians were created for the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, the first installment of the Star Wars original trilogy.[31] The Rodians' gigantic dark eyes, dual antennae, and suction-cupped fingertips evoked aliens of old science-fiction classics.[21] Costume Designer John Mollo's sketches for the three Rodians present in the Mos Eisley Cantina referred to them as \"Martians.\" At one time, the Rodian masks were to fit a four-armed body, which would eventually be known as a Morseerian, but the heads were switched before filming.[41] Although the terms \"Rodian\" and \"Rodia\" were first developed for the Star Wars Legends roleplaying sourcebook Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope in 1989,[42] the name stuck, and saw its way into production for the prequel trilogy.[41]\n\nDirector George Lucas called upon sound desginer Ben Burtt to come up with a voice for Greedo, the first Rodian in Star Wars. Linguist Larry Ward provided the voiceover, and it was Burtt's job to make the voice interesting. At first, the word \"oink\" was going to be manipulated with \"the right rhythm and electrical equipment\" to make a bizarre-sounding language, but they were unhappy with the result. Burtt and a UC Berkeley grad student went through multiple languages including the Quechua, and they created their own. A combination of multiple languages paired with expert editing were used to create Greedo's voice.[21]",
