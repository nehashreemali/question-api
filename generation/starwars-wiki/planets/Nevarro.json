  "content": "Nevarro was a volcanic planet located in the Dalicron sector of the Outer Rim Territories connected to the Hydian Way. It was covered with vast regions of lava fields as well as volcanic rivers, and had a capital city which became a port and a trading hub in the Outer Rim.\n\nDuring the Imperial Era, the Galactic Empire controlled Nevarro, though they lost control of the planet after the end of the Galactic Civil War. In its aftermath, Nevarro became lawless and was a haven for bounty hunters working for Greef Karga, an agent of the the Bounty Hunters' Guild, and Guild Master of the Nevarro Hunters, which was headquartered inside a cantina. Nevarro saw brief conflict when the bounty hunter Din Djarin rescued Grogu, an infant that he had delivered to a member of an Imperial remnant in a previous job, betraying the Guild.\n\nAfter Djarin's escape from Nevarro, the planet was taken over once more by Imperial forces who were led by Moff Gideon. Karga eventually tricked Djarin into returning to Nevarro with the Child, though later changed his mind about allowing the Child to be given to the Imperials, and worked alongside Djarin to defeat them. Despite the arrival of Gideon, Djarin and his associates managed to defeat the Imperial remnant, giving Karga and soon-to-be Marshal Carasynthia Dune the chance to turn the planet into one of respectable business.\n\nDjarin continued on his journey with his small companion before returning to Nevarro for repairs. After reuniting with Karga and Dune, Karga set his mechanics on the repairs and the two showed him the city. Karga then requested that Djarin help them destroy an Imperial base on the planet. There, they discovered that Moff Gideon was alive and was trying to retrieve the Child to use his blood for experimental research. They eventually destroyed the base, and Nevarro became free from Imperials.\n\nLater, Nevarro became an independent trade port of the Hydian way under the leadership of the Karga, who became High Magistrate and had declined to join the New Republic. After being attacked by Gorian Shard's pirate gang, Pirate King Gorian Shard took control of the planet. Karga asked Captain Carson Teva for the help of the New Republic, but New Republic Requisitions refused to help, as the planet was independent. Teva instead obtained the help of the Children of the Watch, who liberated the planet and were granted land on it.\n\nA terrestrial planet,[12] Nevarro was situated within the Dalicron sector[2] of the Outer Rim Territories,[1] in a system with a singular star[5] and asteroid fields.[3] Its orbit caused its sun to set quickly.[5] An ashen world of black sands,[7] Nevarro had rocky and volcanic terrain that consisted of regions of rocky flats and hills[6] along with vast fields of lava, which contained lava rivers both on the surface[5] and underground.[12] Its atmosphere was breathable to individuals of various species,[6] though the atmosphere of Nevarro's lava rivers was burning and sulphuric.[14]\n\nThough Nevarro's lava plains were inhospitable to most species,[15] the planet was home to a number of different creatures,[5] including a reptavian that would attack unsuspecting beings under the cover of night,[16] able to lift their prey into the air or incapacitate them with venom. Qartuums could be found on the planet's lava fields,[5] while lava meerkats resided in the fiery terrain[15] of the underground lava rivers.[12]\n\nNevarro had a rich history for a planet located in the Outer Rim. It had a substancial population with a vibrant culture.[2] In the era of the New Republic, Nevarro was an anchor point of the Hydian Way trade route,[3] and Nevarro City, its capital city, was a popular trading point for commerce.[2]\n\nDuring the Imperial Era, Nevarro was under the control of the Galactic Empire, who were based in[5] its capital city[2] on the planet.[5] During the Imperial expansion, the Empire established a military base on Nevarro.[10] At some point during the Galactic Civil War, forces of the Rebel Alliance attacked the Imperial-controlled city. However, the lack of cover in the surrounding terrain caused the Rebellion to suffer heavy casualties, and the planet remained in Imperial control until the end of the war.[5] Between 3 ABY and 4 ABY,[17] the bounty hunter Vukorah accepted a bounty to be delivered to Nevarro.[18]\n\nFollowing the fall of the Empire[6] and during the early New Republic Era, the Bounty Hunters' Guild resided on Nevarro[7] led by the agent Greef Karga, who operated from a cantina within Nevarro's city. At some point by the time of the New Republic, a tribe of Mandalorians came to reside in a covert in the sewers of the city.[6]\n\nIn 9 ABY,[20] the Mandalorian bounty hunter[6] Din Djarin[12] worked for the Bounty Hunters' Guild, returning a number of bounties to Nevarro. After capturing several such bounties, including a Mythrol[6] who had worked for Karga on Nevarro before fleeing with stolen money,[21] Djarin landed his starship Razor Crest in a spaceport outside Nevarro's city. Djarin met with Karga in the Nevarro Hunters cantina, where, unsatisfied with the state of the Guild's regular jobs, he took a job that required directly meeting the Client—a member of an Imperial remnant faction. The Mandalorian bounty hunter met the Client in a facility elsewhere on Nevarro, learning of the Client's target. Following the meeting, Djarin visited the Mandalorian enclave, using his down payment of beskar to have a pauldron forged by the tribe's Armorer. Djarin left Nevarro for the planet Arvala-7, where his target was located.[6]\n\nAfter successfully acquiring the target, the Force-sensitive infant known as the Child,[22] Djarin returned to Nevarro to deliver the bounty to his client, taking the beskar he had been given as a reward to his tribe's enclave in order to create more armor, where he was was confronted by fellow Mandalorian Paz Vizsla for taking a job from Imperials. Djarin met Karga in Nevarro's cantina for his next job, but before he could leave the planet, he felt remorseful for delivering the Child to the Imperials, and returned to the facility to rescue him.[13]\n\nThe bounty hunter managed to eliminate many of the Client's stormtroopers and rescue the Child, but, upon attempting to leave, was confronted by Karga and the Guild hunters, who had been notified of his betrayal. When he refused to hand over the Child, Djarin was attacked by the other bounty hunters, but was saved by the intervention of the Mandalorians of his tribe, including Vizsla. Djarin escaped Nevarro, but not before being forced to shoot Karga, who survived.[13]\n\nOnce Djarin left the system with the Child, the skirmish between the hunters and Mandalorians concluded, with many hunters leaving once they realized the Client's target had been taken.[12] Following Djarin's escape from Nevarro, additional forces of the Imperial remnant led by the former Moff Gideon,[5] who was thought to have been executed for war crimes,[12] took control of the planet. The Imperial rule of Nevarro's city impeded the operation of the Bounty Hunters' Guild.[5] The Imperials also attacked the Mandalorian covert for revealing themselves and assisting in Djarin's escape, which left many of the Mandalorians dead, though the Armorer speculated that some survived and escaped the planet.[12]\n\nSome time later, Karga attempted to trick Djarin into bringing the Child back to Nevarro, claiming he had a plan to kill the Client, though the Guild's true plan was to kill Djarin and return the Child. Djarin assembled a team of accomplices, consisting of the former rebel shock trooper Cara Dune, the moisture farmer Kuiil, and the reprogrammed assassin droid IG-11, and landed in a remote region of Nevarro to meet with Karga and several Guild hunters. Once night fell, the team set up camp, but were attacked by the planet's species of winged predators, who killed one of Karga's hunters and injured Karga himself. The Child healed Karga's wounds with the Force, and the team continued toward the city after sunrise.[5]\n\nHaving had his life saved by the Child, Karga had a change of heart and instead killed the Guild hunters, revealing his previous plan to Djarin and offering to help defeat the Imperials. While Kuiil protected the Child, Karga and Dune brought Djarin into the city, pretending that they had captured him and had come to return the Child. They were met by the Client, but he was contacted by Gideon, who revealed Karga's ruse. Having surrounded the cantina with the forces of his Imperial remnant, Gideon had the Client and his stormtroopers shot and killed through the window of the cantina. While attempting to return the Child to the Razor Crest, Kuiil was shot down[5] and killed,[12] and the Child was taken by two Imperial scout troopers.[5] However, before the troopers could return the Child to Moff Gideon, IG-11 killed them and rescued the Child.[12]\n\nTrapped in the cantina, Djarin suggested escaping through the sewers to the Mandalorian covert. Gideon threatened to raze the cantina with an E-Web heavy repeating blaster unless Karga and his associates surrendered. IG-11 entered the city, shooting down a number of Imperial stormtroopers, including many of Moff Gideon's forces. Djarin was injured in the ensuing skirmish, and his associates retreated into the cantina. Karga and Dune entered the sewers with the Child, while Djarin allowed IG-11 to heal him, and the two followed their accomplices to the Mandalorian covert, finding it deserted except for the Armorer, who explained what had happened to the Tribe. The Armorer provided the fugitives with an escape route and equipped Djarin with a jetpack and a supply of munitions.[12]\n\nDjarin and his accomplices escaped through the sewers to an underground lava river, while the Armorer was confronted by the Imperials, who she managed to defeat. As the fugitives attempted to travel down the lava river aboard a keelboat, Djarin detected a stormtrooper platoon at the exit of the tunnel. IG-11 sacrificed himself to kill the stormtroopers, allowing Djarin, Dune, and Karga to escape with the Child. When the team exited the tunnel, Gideon attacked in his TIE fighter. Djarin used his jetpack to latch onto the starfighter and destroy it, causing Gideon to crash into the lava fields. With the Imperial remnant defeated, Karga mused that Nevarro could become a haven for bounty hunters once again, Dune decided to remain with the Guild on the planet, and Djarin left to search for the Child's home. However, Moff Gideon had survived the crash, and broke out of his TIE fighter using the Darksaber.[12]\n\nRather than allow the planet to become, as Djarin had called it, a \"bounty hunter hive\" again,[12] Karga took over the operations of the city as Magistrate with Dune serving as the Marshal, mopping up criminals, including a group of Aqualish thieves. Karga turned the old cantina into a school and saw the city return to a respectable place for a variety of citizens. The city streets became teeming with vendors, gathering places, and potted plants. The Armorer, meanwhile, fled the planet[10] and established a new covert with Paz Vizsla, the only other Mandalorian she knew who had survived the massacre, on the Glavis Ringworld.[23]\n\nAt one point, Djarin returned to Nevarro for repairs and happily reunited with Karga and Dune outside the city. Karga told his two mechanics to work on Djarin's ship while he and Dune brought their former companion through the new-look city. Noting that Djarin had some time on his hands while repairs were done, Karga brought him to his office and proposed a mission to take out the Imperial base located close by. Djarin agreed to the mission and traveled to the base in a landspeeder with Karga, Dune, and the Mythrol he had captured earlier.[10]\n\nThe group infiltrated the base to destabilize the coolant system that allowed the base to coexist with the landscape's lava features. However, as they exited, the group realized that it was a laboratory and noticed several individuals suspended in tubes as well as a hologram that involved Dr. Pershing communicating with Gideon. Realizing the transmission was from three days ago, they realized Gideon was still alive. Djarin used his jetpack to quickly return to the city, where he had left the Child, while Karga, Dune, and the Mythrol blasted their way out in a Trexler 906 Armored Marauder.[10]\n\nThe New Republic pilot Carson Teva questioned Karga and Dune. Karga refused to cooperate, denying the involvement of the Razor Crest. Dune did not want to join the New Republic, but was given a badge and became Marshal[10] and a ranger of the New Republic,[24] and worked with the Nevarro authorities.[25] She later left the planet and was recruited into the New Republic Special Forces.[3]\n\nThe planet later became an independent trade anchor and Outer Rim Hyperlane port of the Hydian Way under the leadership of Karga, who became High Magistrate. A construction boom was going on in the city, and money was made from belters that mined the asteroid fields at the edge of the system. Kowakian monkey-lizards resided peacefully on trees instead of being roasted.[3]\n\nDjarin returned to the planet, looking to repair IG-11, as he needed a droid to explore Mandalore. During his visit, Karga attempted to convince him to become the marshal of the planet, offering him a land, but Djarin refused. They later had a showdown with the pirate Vane and some members of Gorian Shard's pirate gang. They let Vane escape the planet.[3]\n\nGorian Shard returned to the planet and bombed it with his Corsair, and briefly took control of it away from High Magistrate Karga. However, Shard and most of his gang were killed when Karga received aid from the Children of the Watch under Djarin and Lady Bo-Katan Kryze. Together, they were able to take back control of the city. As a reward Karga ceded all land stretching from the western lava flats to Bulloch Canyon to the Mandalorians. While they did not have a home planet, he told them that they now have a home on Nevarro, to which the townsfolk cheered and celebrated.[8]\n\nA number of individuals of various species resided on Nevarro during the era of the New Republic, including many operatives of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. Members of the Imperial remnant led by Moff Gideon also operated on Nevarro,[6] which was eventually taken over by the former Moff himself. After Djarin rescued the Child from Nevarro, a large number of Guild hunters left the planet.[5] Species who had been present within Nevarro's city and the Bounty Hunters' Guild cantina included humans, Jawas, Melbu,[6] Onodones,[13] Rodians, Suertons, Trandoshans,[6] Twi'leks,[13] Wickwar,[6] and Zabraks.[13]\n\nA Mandalorian tribe resided in hiding within the sewers of Nevarro's city,[6] but they were eventually attacked by Moff Gideon's forces, resulting in the deaths of many and forcing any survivors to flee the planet, though the Armorer planned to stay behind until the work of forging beskar was finished.[12] Din Djarin later questioned if the Mandalorians on the water moon of Trask the \"Frog Man\" knew of were survivors from Nevarro,[26] but they were actually a group led by Lady Kryze of Mandalore.[27] Outside of the city, Nevarro's lava fields were inhabited by a number of Jawas[5] who had adapted to their surroundings on Nevarro[28] and would attempt to dismantle starships in the area.[12]\n\nThe planet later became more respectable as a trade port of the Hydian Way, which attracted some of the best droidsmiths of the Outer Rim.[3]\n\nSparse settlements were situated on Nevarro within vast stretches of cooled volcanic rock.[29] The capital[8] city cut into Nevarro's terrain hosted a cantina that was home to the[6] Nevarro Bounty Hunters Guild[30], as well as the facility where forces of Moff Gideon's Imperial remnant were based.[6] A bazaar[12] was located near the city's entrance, hosting a number of the city's residents[6] and merchants selling wares.[29] Within a sewer beneath the city,[12] the Mandalorian group known as the Tribe resided in a hidden enclave.[6]\n\nAn area designated for starships to land was located outside of the archway that led into the city. The Twi'lek healing baths were also located elsewhere on Nevarro.[13] A region of lava fields was located in the vicinity of the city,[5] while one underground lava river led between the city's sewer and the fields.[12] Upon Nevarro's lava rivers, ferry droids operated keelboats in order to provide safe passage for travelers.[14]\n\nNevarro first appeared in Chapter 1 of the 2019 television series Star Wars: The Mandalorian,[6] which premiered on Disney+ on November 12, 2019.[32] It was not named until it received a mention in the fifth episode,[19] released on December 6, 2019.[32] Prior to the release of The Mandalorian, Nevarro was pictured in a preview of the series on StarWars.com on October 4, 2018.[33]\n\nNevarro's terrain was inspired by the dry and hard-packed lava flows of Kailua-Kona in Hawaii, while its city's stone streets and archways were influenced by the architecture of the Roman ruins of Pompeii. Its markets referenced those found in Morocco and the Middle East.[34]\n\nScenes on Nevarro were shot using a practical set surrounded by a 360-degree LED screen. Backdrops would be projected onto the screen in real time during filming to give the illusion of a physical environment.[35] Image Engine was responsible for creating the computer-generated backgrounds on Nevarro, including views angled into the city and toward the landing bay at its entrance. A fully digital set of Nevarro was created, which Image Engine used to integrate effects such as blaster bolts.[31]\n\nThe landscape of Nevarro was digitally constructed based on photogrammetry scans taken from locations in Hawaii and Iceland. Using a style guide created by the Lucasfilm art department, Industrial Light & Magic created a library of assets to be used for Nevarro. The library was used by Hybride to create assets for Nevarro's city and landscape based on set pictures and Lidar scans. These assets were used to generate locations within the digital model of the Nevarro city.[36] Nevarro was placed within galactic grid coordinate J-19 by the Star Wars Galaxy Map.[37] After \"Chapter 17: The Apostate\" established its proximity to the Hydian Way,[3] it was later moved to K-20 by Star Wars: Complete Locations, New Edition.[4]",
