  "content": "Cloud City, originally known as Floating Home Mining Colony, was a tibanna gas mining colony floating in the clouds of the planet Bespin, located in the Anoat sector of the Outer Rim Territories. Under the auspices of Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian, the city attempted to avoid unwanted Imperial attention. Eventually, Imperial forces occupied the station and installed a garrison. However, after the Emperor's apparent death, the Imperial Garrison was abandoned during the Iron Blockade, and the planet was soon liberated.\n\nCloud City,[3] originally known as Floating Home Mining Colony,[15] was a completely man-made tibanna gas mining colony staff hovering over the gas giant Bespin, occupied by millions of workers, tourists and support staff. Located in Bespin's Life Zone, the station had no need for airlocks or life support systems, with the atmosphere comprised mostly of oxygen and acceptable levels of gravity and temperature. The station was situated 59,000 kilometers above Bespin's core, while its disk was approximately 16.2 kilometers in diameter. 36,000 repulsorlift engines and tractor beam generators kept the giant city floating above the planet. It contained 392 levels, along with platforms and rooms for residents and visitors.[6][10] The city had a controlled environment that meant residents did not have to worry about the weather.[16]\n\nCloud City contained 392 levels, along with platforms and rooms for residents and visitors.[6] the top fifty levels of the city were used as a luxury resort, renowned for its famous casinos such as Yarith Bespin and Pair O'Dice, while the lower levels housed workers and catered for the mining and processing of tibanna gas.[10] The city had a controlled environment that meant residents did not have to worry about the weather.[16]\n\nOn the lower levels of Cloud City, workers and catered for the mining and processing of tibanna gas.[10] As such, the lower city was built around the production of tibanna gas, containing gigantic gas processing vanes, transportation docking bays, tibanna block warehouses, and conveyors to facilitate the production process.[15]\n\nGenerators on the underside of the city emitted tractor beams that converged below the gas mine's reactor bulb, creating a funnel of energy that mined tibanna gas from Bespin's lower atmosphere, at depths of more than 23,000 kilometers. The gas was forced up into an opening at the bottom of the bulb, where it traveled up the reactor stalk and finally into one of several smaller reactor shafts, where it was then filtered through a processing vane. Each processing vane maintained a carbon-freezing chamber, where tibanna gas was mixed with carbonite for flash-freeze preservation.[18] One of the chambers was used on the smuggler Han Solo after he was captured by Imperial forces who had recently arrived at the station.[3] Work areas in these lower levels were primarily operated by the sentient Ugnaughts, who performed the monotonous and sometimes dangerous work while bathed in red light, which was the preferred color for the species and also increased their productivity.[10] Many of these tunnels could only be navigated by the Ugnaughts.[19]\n\nCenturies before the New Republic Era,[11] Cloud City was built by the eccentric explorer Lord Ecclessis Figg of Corellia, who offered the freedom of the city to three Ugnaught tribes if they agreed to build the city.[19] With the Ugnaughts having been sold into slavery long ago, the tribes agreed, creating the first iteration of Cloud City.[2] Cloud City was constructed using minerals from the Bespin system's innermost planet Miser.[18] Its construction was kept somewhat secret, to avoid attention by the Mining Guild and later the Galactic Empire.[11]\n\nAround 1 ABY,[20] years after gambling away his starship, the Millennium Falcon, the young smuggler Lando Calrissian gambled big and won control of Cloud City.[2] Sometime during the Age of the Empire, the Devaronian smuggler Gev Hessan did work for Lando to help him build Cloud City.[12]\n\nEarly on in his rule, Calrissian had the Cantonarive crown coin stolen from him. Calrissian was going to give the coin to a grand slicer who would, in exchange keep the Cloud City off the Galactic Empire's radar and in turn protect his people. Calrissian tracked down the individuals who stole the coin and convinced them to return before the individuals would sell the coin to the gangster Wonn Ionstrike.[8]\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and Alliance to Restore the Republic, in 3 ABY,[21] a rebel base on the planet Hoth was discovered by the Galactic Empire, resulting in Empire launching an assault on the base, during which the humans Han Solo and Leia Organa, alongside the Wookiee Chewbacca and the protocol droid C-3PO, narrowly escaped Imperial capture by escaping aboard the latter human's starship, the Millennium Falcon.[3] Despite the YT-1300fp light freighter's[22] less-than-ideal state, the rebels aboard the ship managed to evade capture and eventually hide from the Empire in the Hoth asteroid field, though unable to escape due to a malfunctioning hyperdrive. As a result, the rebels decided to make their way at to the nearby planet Bespin's Cloud City, with Han hoping Lando Calrissian, the baron administrator of the facility and former colleague of his, would help the group and allow them to repair their ship. Simultaneously, several bounty hunters were hired to by the Galactic Empire to track down the rebels, resulting in the bounty hunter Boba Fett, piloting his starship Slave I, quickly locating the rebels hiding amongst trash dumped from a Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, before secretly tailing the rebels and informing the Empire of the rebel's likely destination of Cloud City. Simultaneously, the Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, who had gone to the Dagobah to train as a Jedi with Jedi Master-in-exile Yoda, received visions of his friends in danger at Cloud City, and as such left soon after to save them without completing his training.[3]\n\nAs a result of Fett's work, the Imperial forces under the command of the Sith Lord Darth Vader, arrived to Cloud City before the Millennium Falcon, informing Baron Administrator Lando Calrissian of the imminent arrival of the ship and giving Lando Calrissian a choice between setting a trap for his old friends or facing the wrath of the Empire.[23] Calrissian chose the former, thus allowing the Empire to being laying a trap to capture the rebels, with Boba Fett being promised Han Solo to bring as a bounty to crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure by the Empire, while the Galactic Empire would take the other rebels aboard the ship, which included Leia Organa, a leader of the alliance. Additionally, Vader hoped to lure Luke Skywalker, who he had discovered to be his son, to the city to capture and bring to the Emperor.[3]\n\nUpon the arrival of the Millennium Falcon to Bespin, the ship was briefly escorted by two Storm IV Twin-Pod cloud car piloted by law enforcement officers for Bespin Wing Guard, before being cleared to land at Platform 327 at Cloud City. Upon landing, the ship's crew was briefly greeted by an eerie emptiness until Lando Calrissian, after briefly conversing with Lobot, walked out onto the platform alongside Lobot and officer from the Bespin Wing Guard. Following this, Han attempted to warmly embrace his old friend, only to be told coldly by Calrissian that he had a lot of guts to come after winning the Millennium Falcon (which Han had won from Lando), before the baron administrator seemingly dropped the façade and greeted Han warmly. Shortly after, Lobot ordered the Bespin Wing Guard to return inside the building connected to the landing platform while C-3PO noted to Leia how friendly Calrissian appeared to be, which Leia agreed with. Lando still slightly sore about the losing the Millennium Falcon, asked what happened to the ship while implying it was still his, before Han reminded Lando about who owned the ship. Calrissian then greeted Chewbacca, asking if he was still flying with Han, to which Chewbacca responded to. Following this, Calrissian then noticed Leia before smugly introducing himself to her and kissing Leia's hand after Leia introduced herself in turn. Han then broke the two up before C-3PO tried to introduce himself to Calrissian, though failing as the baron administrator, along with the crew of the Millennium Falcon, began walking off the landing platform, with Calrissian and Han discussing the ship's current issues which Calrissian said he'd get his best people to work on.[3]\n\nAs the group continued indoors, Han asked how running Cloud City was going, to which Calrissian explained that it was not going as good as he wanted as the small colony was not quite self-sufficient and that he'd had many supply problems of all types and labor difficulties, causing Han to laugh. Confused, Calrissian asked what was funny, to which Han said Calrissian sounded like a businessman and a responsible leader, which was unexpected for him. Calrissian responded that seeing Han brought back some memories, which Han tried to use to make himself appear responsible to Leia. As the crew continued to walk, a door opened next to C-3PO with another protocol droid on the other end, only for the droid to hurl huttese slur at C-3PO as it left the room, prompting 3PO to exclaim how rude it was. However, C-3PO then heard the sound of an R2 unit and decided to enter the room and investigate. Upon entering, 3PO was confronted by Imperial Stormtroopers who asked the droid who they were. In response, 3PO unsuccessfully attempted to apologize and back away before was still shot, causing their parts to go flying in multiple different directions. As Chewbacca came to investigate where C-3PO had went, the blast doors to the room C-3PO had entered closed, stopping Chewbacca from investigating further and leaving the wookiee to let out little cry. C-3PO's parts were then given to some Ugnaught garbage disposal workers[3]\n\nA little while later, Leia paced in an apartment[3] decorated in an Alderaanian style, further fueling he unease. As she paced, a cloud car that had been flying around Cloud City flew past the apartment's window window, before Han entered the room and explained the Millennium Falcon was nearly finished and only a few more things needed to be done before the ship was in good condition again. Leia responded that it was better they left sooner as she felt something was wrong, and the C-3PO had been gone too long to have got lost. Han then kissed Leia's forehead to calm the princess down, before saying he'd ask Lando, to which Leia said she did not trust Lando. Han responded that he also did not trust the baron administrator but they were still his friend, adding that they would leave soon anyways, causing Leia to state that Han was as good as gone.[3]\n\nShortly after, Chewbacca found C-3PO's parts moving along a conveyor belt towards an incinerator. As one Ugnaught garbage disposal worker grabbed 3PO's head, Chewbacca grabbed all other parts of C-3PO, before trying to get the head back. Despite the Ugnaughts attempting to hold onto the head by passing it between themselves, Chewbacca eventually grabbed the head after it hit some metal bars between two Ugnaughts. Soon after, Chewbacca brought C-3PO's parts to Han and explained how he had found the parts at a junk pile. Leia exclaimed how C-3PO was a mess and asked Chewbacca to repair it, before the wookiee explained he could not, prompting Han to state that Lando had engineers who could fix up C-3PO, to which Leia refused to let happen.[3]\n\nAs if to answer Han's mention, Calrissian then entered the room and asked if he was interrupting anything. Leia said he was not, before Lando then complimented Leia's appearance and stated that she belonged in Cloud City among the clouds. Leia thanked Calrissian for the compliment, before the baron administrator then invited the Leia to a have a meal with him, before then adding that everyone could join. Calrissian then noticed C-3PO's parts and inquired about if they group was having trouble with them, to which Han said he they were not. The group then left the apartment, leaving behind C-3PO's parts in the room.[3]\n\nAs the group continued through a hallway of Cloud City, Calrissian explained that since the colony was a small mining operation, it did not fall under the jurisdiction. Leia inquired if that meant Cloud City was under the jurisdiction of the Mining Guild, which Calrissian then explained was also not the case as they colony was too small to be noticed by the guild, which was advantageous for everyone since the colony's customers did not take kindly to attention. As the group neared the dining hall, Han asked Calrissian if he was nervous that the Empire would discover the city's existence and shut down Calrissian's mining operations. As the group passed Lobot, Calrissian responded that it was always a looming danger, though things had developed the would ensure the colony's continued existence. Calrissian continued that he'd made a deal to keep the Empire out of Cloud City forever, before opening the door to the Rinetta dining room, revealing the presence of Darth Vader. Taking only a second to react, Han quickly fired his pistol at Vader from across the room as Chewbacca let out a roar, which Vader deflected using his hand before using the Force to grab Han's pistol from across the room. Once the pistol was in his hands, Vader stated that the Empire would be honored if the group would join them as Boba Fett revealed himself from behind a pillar and Stormtroopers alongside Lobot surrounded the only way out. Calrissian then apologized to the group, explaining that he had no choice since the Empire arrived just before the Falcon did, to which Han, after giving a look to Leia, returned the apology, before Calrissian and the group entered the dining room as Vader sat back down.[3]\n\nUpon being thrown in a prison cell as siren went off, Chewbacca yelled out repeatedly until the siren stopped. However, upon finding C-3PO's parts also in the cell, Chewbacca began to reassemble the protocol droid. As Chewbacca adjusted a nob on C-3PO's head, C-3PO spoke in multiple languages until turning off and finally speaking in Galactic Basic Standard. Upon being awoken, C-3PO spoke about the stormtroopers he'd seen and said that he had to tell the others before exclaiming how he'd been shot. Meanwhile, in another cell, Vader tortured and interrogated Han Solo as Calrissian, Fett, and Lobot as well as two stormtroopers waited outside the cell. As Calrissian began to walk towards a wall, Vader then left the room, prompting Calrissian to address the Sith Lord, though he was ignored as Vader instead addressed Fett, informing the bounty hunter that they could take Han to Jabba after he had captured Luke Skywalker. Fett then reminded Vader that the captain was no good to him dead, to with Vader stated that Solo would not be permanently injured. Calrissian then asked Vader what was to become of Chewbacca and Leia, to which Vader responded that the pair were never again to leave the Cloud City. Calrissian responded that those conditions as well as Han being given to bounty hunter was never part of the pair's agreement, to which Vader asked Calrissian if he thought they were being treated unfairly, to which a scared and nervous Calrissian said he was not, with Vader then threatening to leave a garrison in the city. After Vader entered a turbolift, Fett and Calrissian walked away, as the ladder exclaimed that the deal just kept getting worse.[3]\n\nAs Chewbacca continued to fix up C-3PO, the droid's head ended up backwards, causing the droid to complain until Chewbacca once again shut off the droid. Soon after, two stormtrooper brought a barely conscious Han Solo into Chewbacca holding cell, throwing Han to the ground as the did so, with one stormtrooper's helmet getting knocked as they did so. As soon as they left, Chewbacca helped his captain up, who told his wookiee friend that he felt terrible. Chewbacca then brought Han and to a slab to rest on, as Leia was simultaneously brought  and thrown in the same cell by stormtroopers, who closed the doors as soon as Leia was in. Leia then walked over to Han and asked why the Empire was even doing it, to which Han added that he never even got asked questions before being tortured. Leia leaned in to give Han a kiss before Lando Calrissian suddenly entered the prison cell alongside two police officers. Upon his entrance Chewbacca growled at the backstabber, with Han joining in to tell Calrissian to leave, before the baron administrator told the prisoners to shut up and listen. Lando explained that Vader had agreed to run over Chewbacca and Leia to him, which prompted Han to ask what that meant, to which Lando explained that they had to stay in Cloud City, but they would be safe. Leia asked what was to happen to Han, to which Lando revealed that Han was to be handed over to Fett. Leia, skeptical, responded that Vader wanted them all dead, to which Lando responded that he did not care for them, and was instead after someone with the last name of \"Skywalker,\" causing the group to realize that Vader was after Luke. Lando continued to explain that Vader had set a trap, with Leia adding that they were the bait before Lando continued that Skywalker was on his way. Han then stood up and pointed out how Calrissian had set them all up before hitting Lando in the face, causing the officers to pull out their weapons. Before the officers shot however, Lando told everyone to stop while putting his cape back on. As he fixed his cape, Lando continued that he was sorry that he could not do more but he had his own problems that he had to deal with. Han, lying on the floor simply sarcastically replied that Lando was a \"real hero\", before Calrissian left the cell.[3]\n\nSoon after, Calrissian, accompanied by Lobot, showed a Carbon-freezing chamber to Vader as a group of Ugnaughts worked on various aspects of the facility. As Vader walked around the facility, he remarked that despite the facility's crude nature, it was still acceptable to freeze Skywalker to bring to Darth Sidious the Emperor. As he finished his comments, an Imperial officer informed Vader of an inbound X-wing class starship. In response, the Dark Lord of the Sith informed the officer to monitor Skywalker but allow the ship to land. As soon as Vader finished and the officer had walked off, Calrissian told Vader that the facility was only used for carbon-freezing and that freezing Skywalker there might have be deadly. In response, Vader stated he'd test the process on Han Solo to ensure the process worked and Skywalker could be brought to the Emperor safely.[3]\n\nAs Luke made his final approach to Cloud City, the crew of the Millennium Falcon were escorted down to a Carbon-freezing chamber. As they entered, C-3PO, still only partially put together, sat on Chewbacca's complaining his legs not yet being reattached and saying Chewbacca had a responsibility to not do anything foolish. As the group stood before the freezing spot, surrounded by stormtroopers and Boba Fett, Vader entered the chamber. As Vader did so, Han asked Calrissian what was happening, to which Calrissian informed Han of his impending carbon freeze. Across the room, Fett asked Vader what was to happen if Solo did not survive, to which Vader stated that he would be compensated if the prisoner did not make it, before ordering Solo to be frozen. As stormtroopers came to put Solo in, Chewbacca pushed both into the pit surrounding the chamber. In response, Fett quickly raised his blaster before Vader lowered it. As Chewbacca pushed a third Stormtrooper over, Solo tried to calm the wookiee down as C-3PO began to beg for Chewie to stop as well as they did not want to die. Eventually, Solo convince Chewbacca to calm down, telling the wookiee to save his strength to protect Leia, and that there would be another time to fight. Moments after, Han and Leia briefly kissed, before had was brought into the freezing spot. As Han stood awaiting his freezing, Leia confessed her love for the smuggler, to which Han simply smugly stated that he knew. Han was then lowered into the freezing pit as Chewbacca screamed, and was frozen as C-3PO asked what was happening as he was facing the wrong direction while sitting on Chewbacca's back. Solo's carbon block was removed from the freezing pit and pushed onto the floor as a deafening silence took hold of the room an many in the room stared. Lando soon made his way over to the block as C-3PO explained the Han should be alright while encased in the block if he survived the freezing process. Shortly after, Vader asked the baron administrator if Han survived, to which Lando confirmed, before Vader handed Vader off to Fett and ordered the chamber be reset of Skywalker.[3]\n\nFollowing Vader's orders, an Imperial officer informed Vader that Luke had landed, to which Vader ordered that Luke be lead to the chamber. As Vader finished, Calrissian made his way to Leia and attempted to grab her, though was nudged off. As it happened, Vader then ordered Calrissian to take the prisoners to his ship. When Calrissian protested how it went against their deal, Vader responded that he had altered the deal, and that Calrissian should pray that it not be altered further before walking off.[3]\n\nAs Luke, alongside his astromech droid R2-D2 made his way off his X-wing starfighter and snuck his way into the city. Along the way, he witnessed Fett walk by, followed by two Bespin Wing Guard accompanying Han's carbon-block and followed by an additional two stormtroopers. As soon as the escort moved by, Skywalker ran closer to see what was happening, before R2-D2 attempted to get Luke's attention. However, Luke nudged the droid to stop and tried to move closer only for Fett to begin shooting at him and as such Luke drew his blaster pistol. As Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO were escorted nearby, they heard the blaster fire and looked back, with Leia noticing Luke's presence as Fett ran off. As the prisoners of Vader made their way to Vader's ship escorted by stormtroopers, Lando transmitted a message to Lobot via a device on his wrist. Soon after, Luke made his way towards the prisoner escort and attempted to free his friends, only for the troopers to get the prisoners into a secure room. As Leia was forced in, Leia yelled to Luke that he was entering a trap, though Luke still followed the escort into the secure room, only to find the blast doors closed behind him, locking R2-D2 out, and finding himself brought to a carbon-freezing chamber.[3]\n\nUpon being brought up to the carbon-freeze chamber, Luke stood for a moment before drawing a pistol the vent he'd be brought up throw was closed. Soon after, Luke put his blaster away as the lights in the chamber turned on and Vader spoke to Luke, telling him that the force was with him, revealing his location before adding that Luke was not a Jedi yet. Following Vader's statement, Luke turned an slowly walked up the steps to Vader, standing for a moment before drawing his lightsaber, with Vader doing the same shortly afterwards before engaging in a duel. Vader quickly knocked Luke back after only two strokes, before the Jedi then stood up again. Luke then tried again, with Vader fighting single-handed while Luke used both hands to hold his lightsaber.[3]\n\nSimultaneously, members of the Bespin Wing Guard lead by Lobot ambushed and surrounded the stormtroopers guarding Calrissian and the prisoners from the Millennium Falcon, catching the officer in command by surprise. Lando then removed the blasters that the stormtroopers were carrying, before ordering Lobot to quitely bring their new prisoners to the Security Tower for imprisonment. As soon as the guards left, Leia asked Lando what he was doing as Lando freed Chewbacca, to which Lando responded that they were escaping. In response Leia, asked if Lando really thought that she would trust him after what happened to Han, with Chewbacca grabbing Lando by the neck as soon as he could. Barely breathing, Lando responded that he had no choice as C-3PO begged his companions to trust Lando, with Leia responding to Lando that they understood perfectly what Lando was doing. In response, Lando, still barely breathing said he was only trying to help, to which Leia said that they did not need any. As Lando continued to be choked, Lando barely spoke out Han's name, which neither Leia nor Chewbacca understood until C-3PO explained what was being said, with Lando then explaining that there was still a chance for Han to be saved at the East Platform. Leia and Chewbacca then both left, with the ladder releasing Lando from his stranglehold as C-3PO apologized on the wookiee's behalf.[3]\n\nAt the East Platform of Cloud City, Boba Fett ordered Han be put in the cargo hold as the carbon block was brought onto the bounty hunter's ship Slave I. As a Bespin Wing Guard officer loaded Han onboard, Fett followed closely behind. As Chewbacca, Leia, and Lando made their way to the platform, they passed R2-D2 who quickly rejoined their friends, with C-3PO asking where the astromech had been as Chewbacca turned around to greet the droid against the wishes of the protocol droid. As the wookiee began moving again, C-3PO explained that they were attempting to save Han from a bounty hunte, which R2-D2 acknowledged, before the two droids momentarily began to bicker again. However, upon the group's arrival to the East Platform, they found Fett's ship taking off and flying away, with their blasters useless to stop it. Just as the group realized what had happened, stormtroopers suddenly appeared from behind, which C-3PO quickly informed the group of as the group fought back before making an escape from the area.[3]\n\nBy the duel between Vader and Luke's conclusion, Luke learned that Darth Vader was his father and  jumped down one of the city's reactor shafts in order to avoid joining the dark side of the Force. Meanwhile, Lando Calrissian, upset by the Empire's refusal to abide by the terms of their arrangement—which stipulated that Cloud City was to remain autonomous—warned citizens over an intercom that Imperial forces had invaded the city while his local security forces overwhelmed Imperial forces, allowing Leia Organa, Chewbacca, the two droids, and himself to escape the city, picking up an injured Luke Skywalker dangling on a[3] weather scanner vane[10] along the way.\n\nAfter the capture of the rebels, the Empire took over Cloud City, establishing a skeleton garrison to ensure that the citizens would pay proper taxes and fines to the regime. After the Empire suffered a major defeat at Endor, the Cloud City garrison was pulled to support more strategic targets, and there were celebrations in the streets.[24] In the absence of a baron administrator, a council of business representatives came to run the city.[6]\n\nBefore word of the Emperor's death could reach the city, Imperial Governor Ubrik Adelhard established the Iron Blockade over the entirety of the Anoat sector, shutting down travel and communications in and out of Cloud City. The city also served as the location of Governor Adelhard's personal headquarters located within the prime tower. Ultimately, a militia led by Lobot succeeded in relaying messages to the New Republic, and with the aid of the Uprising, successfully liberated the city from Imperial control.[6]\n\nIn the years leading up to the Battle of Jakku, Lando Calrissian and Lobot led a joint New Republic and Bespin Wing Guard mopping-up operation against Imperial troops who had taken up position in the casino level's Bolo Tanga room. Calrissian managed to convince a dozen of the Imperials to surrender. However, one of them refused to stand down. The Baron Administrator was forced to shoot him dead with his Rossmoyne Vitiator. Calrissian and Lobot then chatted about sending a nuptial gift to Princess Leia Organa's then-newborn son. They settled on sending a Vantillian catamaran that was being stored in the western skipdock.[14]\n\nIn 35 ABY, following the Battle of Exegol, the inhabitants of Cloud City rose up against the First Order after the final death of Darth Sidious.[25]\n\nAlthough the atmosphere had been mapped for many generations, gas prospectors still searched the skies for pockets of tibanna gas and other valuable gases before major contractors find them. However, this was a risky business for cloud storms were highly unpredictable and deadly.[18]\n\nPopular tourist activities included gambling, hiring a cloud car for sightseeing the city and occasionally touring the local mining operations. The high-end accommodations were exclusive, with luxury resorts often charging as much as 5,000 Imperial credits a night.[3][10] The Ivax Syndicate also maintained gaming houses on the station.[6] In the months following the Battle of Endor, Cloud City had become the destination to procure rare implants such as brand new oculars and custom-made hands, or entire organ systems for a multitude of alien species. However, following the Empire's occupation of the Anoat sector and subsequently, Cloud City, the distribution of implants was temporarily put on hold.[12]\n\nCloud City was notable enough to warrant the existence of postcards that included such phrases as \"Wish You Were Here\" in Aurebesh. One such card found its way to Rey while scavenging on the planet Jakku.[26]\n\nThe head of mayor of Cloud City held the title of Baron Administrator. At some point during the Age of the Empire, Lando Calrissian was given the position. However, the day-to-day affairs of the facility were mostly overseen by the cybernetically enhanced human Lobot[10] Following the departure of Calrissian, a council of business representatives ran the city.[6]\n\nThe need for security was great on Cloud City due to the mining and tourism business. Strict visa procedures were in place and any unidentified vessels were located and intercepted long before they reach the docks. A shield generator protected the city from near-space bombardment. Vigilance was overseen by the Bespin Wing Guard, who patrolled the skies around the city.[18]\n\nCloud City first appeared in both current Star Wars canon and Star Wars Legends in the 1980 film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, the second installment of the Star Wars original trilogy.[3]\n\nConcepts of what would eventually become Cloud City date back to George Lucas' 1974 rough draft and it's concept art by Ralph McQuarrie for what would eventually become Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. In the rough draft, a city known as the \"Imperial City of Alderaan,\" located on the gas giant \"Alderaan,\" served as the capital city for what was then called the \"New Galactic Empire.\"[28] The Imperial City of Alderaan subsequently appeared in the second,[27] and third drafts of the film,[29] before eventually being removed in the film's fourth draft due to budget constraints, with scenes originally set in the city being moved to the Death Star. Eventually, the design of the Imperial City of Alderaan in Ralph McQuarrie's concept art was recycled for the look of Cloud City, differing only in minor respects from the city as seen in The Empire Strikes Back.[30] The 1987 first edition rulebook of Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game by West End Games later depicted Cloud City in an In-universe advertisement for the \"Grand Galactic Tour\" using Ralph McQuarrie's concept art of the Imperial City of Alderaan.[31]\n\nIn LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy - Pieces of the Past, Cloud City appears in a mixed-up galaxy, where it is on Hoth and called Snow City.[32]\n\nA toy model of Cloud City appeared in \"Yuko's Treasure,\" an animated short film produced by Kinema Citrus and released as part of the third volume of the non-canon Star Wars: Visions series[33] on October 29, 2025.[34] In \"Yuko's Treasure,\" the toy Cloud City hangs at a stall in the city Mos Eisley on[33] the planet[2] Tatooine alongside several toy starships. A toy cloud car hangs from beneath the Cloud City model.[33]",
