  "content": "Starkiller Base, also known as the Starkiller, was a series of First Order military installations and bases built into and on the ice planet of Ilum in the Unknown Regions. The installations were commanded by an unofficial triumvirate of General Armitage Hux, Kylo Ren, and Captain Phasma, and as such the installation was considered the unofficial capital of the First Order.\n\nThe base's main installation was a powerful superweapon, capable of destroying entire star systems halfway across the galaxy using hyperspace tunneling powered by Dark matter quintessence, a substance originally researched as part of Project Celestial Power, a Galactic Empire project that had ultimately lead to the creation of other superweapons, known as 'Death Stars'. despite this, the First Order viewed the weapon as an evolution of the planet-destroying capabilities of the Galactic Empire's Death Star designs.\n\nThe base and planet were ultimately destroyed by a Resistance attack due to a weak point exploited by pilot Poe Dameron, causing the implosion of the entire planet as the superweapon was firing upon the Resistance base on D'Qar. The stored stellar energy then expanded, causing the planet to turn into a star.\n\nThe superweapon housed in the base bore some similarities to the DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station and the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station, the two planet-destroying battle stations built by the Galactic Empire, but it possessed far more power than its predecessors and was more than twice the size, as it was built into a planet. Starkiller Base represented a technological step forward in power, as the First Order believed that they needed to become more powerful than the fallen Galactic Empire if they were to succeed in enacting their goals. Starkiller Base drew its power from the energy of stars, a possible reason for its name.[13]\n\nStarkiller Base, also called \"the Starkiller,\"[4] was a base[15] located on[4]—and, in fact, created out of[5]—the forested ice planet of Ilum,[4] which was rich in kyber crystals,[16] that was located in the Unknown Regions.[12] The First Order, a regime that believed themselves to be the successors to the ideals of the Galactic Empire,[13] converted the planet into a base of operations owing to its unique energy-transmitting crystalline deposits,[17] and used it to house a superweapon capable of destroying entire star systems.[12] The superweapon consumed suns as a power source.[2] Its mobility was provided by rocket ports on the far side of the base.[15] Starkiller Base also served the First Order as a major shipyard.[3]\n\nThe weapon was powered by a type of dark energy called \"quintessence,\" which was ubiquitous in the universe, and offered a practically unlimited power source to the First Order. Using a star as a power source, an array of collectors on one side of the planet would gather dark energy in stages, redirecting it to the planetary core, where it was held in place by the natural magnetic field of the planet, as well as an artificial containment field maintained by the machinery the First Order had installed within the crust. As the planetary magnetic field would not be enough to contain the amount of energy that the weapon required, a thermal oscillator[2] was built into the planet. It generated an oscillating containment field which allowed the installation to expend considerably less energy at containing the dark energy than would be required using a steady containment field.[18]\n\nA colossal hollow cylinder, embedded within the massive trench left by the Empire's mining and large enough to dominate the view of the planet from orbit, penetrated the containment field to a predetermined distance, in order to direct the blast towards its target, and also to absorb its energy, which would otherwise cause catastrophic groundquakes. This design made the weapon vulnerable when it was fully charged, as the destruction of the containment field oscillator the moment before the weapon fired would release the accumulated energy not through the firing cylinder, but throughout the planetary core where it was being held, leading to the gradual collapse of the surface into the core.[18]\n\nAs Starkiller Base was charged through the power of stars, it gradually blocked out sunlight until, running at full capacity, it extinguished it completely, leaving the surface in darkness.[2] In order for the weapon to fire, its weapons engineers would induce a breach in the containment field, allowing the collected dark energy to escape the core through the hollow cylindrical opening on the antipodes of the planet relative to the stellar collector. During this process, the dark energy transformed to a state known as \"phantom energy,\" and left the planet behind, tearing a hole through hyperspace along a perfectly linear path. The beam of energy was specifically designed to be seen across the galaxy, meant to encourage surrender to the First Order.[18]\n\nThe people stationed at the base called the dimension through which the phantom energy beam traveled \"sub-hyperspace,\" and this method of delivering the payload was near-instantaneous across vast distances. The rotation and inclination of the planet had to be taken into account for the weapon to target something, and also the lack of obstacles between it and the target, as the phantom energy beam would only be intercepted by an object of sufficient mass (like a planet). When the phantom energy struck a planet, the interaction produced enough heat to ignite the planet's core, creating a pocket nova. The space-time disruption caused by the phantom energy's passage would make the nova instantaneously visible thousands of light years away, for a short time.[18]\n\nStarkiller Base was protected by a planetary shield that was strong enough to deflect any bombardment,[17] and could not be penetrated by any ship traveling at sublight speeds. The shield had an exploitable flaw, however; a fractional refresh rate necessary for a shield of its size, which could be exploited by a single ship exiting hyperspace inside the shield, with barely a second to right itself before crashing on the planet's surface. The shield control was also localized, which meant that, in case it was disabled via malfunction or sabotage, the planet would be unprotected in the time it took technicians to arrive at shield control and reestablish its operation. If shield control was damaged beyond repair, shield control had to be overridden, which was a time-consuming process. These flaws were utilized by the Resistance to destroy the base. The Millennium Falcon entered the shield after traveling through hyperspace and crash-landed on the edge of a cliff.[2]\n\nIn addition to the primary weapon and shield control, Starkiller Base's facilities included numerous ship hangars, sanitation infrastructure, amenities for the garrison of stormtroopers, flooding tunnels and a room dedicated to communications with Supreme Leader Snoke via hologram. Snowtroopers utilized Light Infantry Utility Vehicles to help maintain the vast technological accomplishment that was Starkiller Base, as its technology penetrated the entire planet. Crew and support staff helped maintain this vast technological terror in both surface and subsurface facilities, while the sheer size of the planet meant that droid workers were essential in maintaining the base. Sentry droids utilized rolling casters to travel through the base's interior, while patrol droids utilized long-range communications antennae to survey the wilderness above. The planet was also host to the largest known deployment of First Order military forces by the time of its destruction, with its command and operations crew drawing from both Army and Navy ranks.[17]\n\nThe planet that would host Starkiller Base, Ilum, was once a remote and mysterious world known only to a handful in the galaxy. During the age of the Galactic Empire, Ilum was mined for kyber crystals for use in the Death Star's superlaser.[16] The resultant over-mining of kyber crystals caused the planet to bear an equatorial trench[19] that would eventually host the Starkiller superweapon.[2]\n\nAfter the Empire's fall at the Battle of Jakku, the founders of the First Order secured research logs from secret Imperial laboratories detailing the planet.[16] Choosing Ilum to build their new superweapon, the First Order would arrive on the planet soon after the battle and began construction.[4] The planet was initially scouted by snowtrooper teams who eliminated any native life forms that could have posed a threat to the extensive future excavation and construction project.[17] Ilum soon became known as Starkiller Base,[12] and became the unofficial headquarters of the First Order. Mining operations were conducted in order to harvest the planet's kyber crystal deposits for use in the First Order's war machine, and after sufficient excavation was completed, the Order converted Ilum into a mobile superweapon platform, with the colossal superlaser array embedded in the massive trench in the planet's crust.[16] The conversion of the planet into a superweapon was made easier by the earlier Imperial mining.[19]\n\nAfter the Empire's fall at the Battle of Jakku, the founders of the First Order secured research logs from secret Imperial laboratories detailing the planet.[16] Choosing Ilum to build their new superweapon, the First Order would arrive on the planet soon after the battle and began construction.[4] The planet was initially scouted by snowtrooper teams who eliminated any native life forms that could have posed a threat to the extensive future excavation and construction project.[17] Ilum soon became known as Starkiller Base,[12] and became the unofficial headquarters of the First Order.

Its ability to concentrate dark energy in this manner gave Starkiller Base access to a practically unlimited source of energy.[18]\n\nAt some point prior to the mission to the Dassal system, the system's sun was drained by Starkiller Base. Additionally, the planet Najra-Va was cored in a test attempt to construct the base.[20] The First Order used ships to transport trash off of the planet and dump it on the Garbage Moon of Maher. On Starkiller Base, stormtroopers, such as FN-2187 and FN-3761, kept the floors clean with the use of mops.[6] After being stranded on a remote planet with Kylo Ren, General Hux and Captain Phasma confronted Admiral Brooks on Starkiller Base, whilst it was under construction, where he killed the admiral.[21]\n\nThe first test of the base's weaponry, which had already been charged by draining a star before moving into position,[22] happened right before the Battle of Takodana. After gaining Supreme Leader Snoke's approval, General Hux commanded the base to fire on the capital of the New Republic, Hosnian Prime, and four other planets in the Hosnian system, utterly destroying the planets and a significant portion of the New Republic's fleet.[2] This event became known as the Hosnian Cataclysm.[4]\n\nDuring the Battle of Takodana, the scavenger and Resistance ally Rey was captured by Kylo Ren and taken to Starkiller Base, where he attempted to interrogate her. She was able to resist upon realizing that she was Force-sensitive.[2]\n\nAs Starkiller Base prepared to destroy the planet D'Qar, the site of the Resistance's headquarters, the Resistance planned an attack of their own. Using information from Finn, a defected First Order Stormtrooper, Resistance pilot Temmin Wexley flew a reconnaissance mission to the Starkiller Base system, acquiring detailed scan data on the base. Using the data, Finn revealed a critical weak point—Starkiller's thermal oscillator—that, if destroyed when the weapon was fully charged, but before it fired, would eliminate the planet.[18]\n\nSquadrons of X-wings engaged TIE fighters defending the base, while the Millennium Falcon bypassed its shields and deployed a ground team to disable the shield generators. When the X-wings tried to take down the thermal oscillator but failed, Han Solo and his team delved deeper into the Starkiller's subterranean complex, with the aim of reaching the weak point themselves. Along the way they re-encountered Rey, who had freed herself. Chewbacca detonated explosives on columns supporting an access tunnel that led into the thermal oscillator's conduit. With the tunnel open, Poe Dameron, a commander in the Resistance Starfighter Corps, entered it and destroyed the conduit, starting a chain reaction of explosions across the planet's surface. The planet imploded and then exploded, the stored material from the drained sun expanding to create a new micro-star in the planet's place,[2] turning the star system into a binary.[18] The new star was unofficially named \"Solo\" in honor of Han's passing.[4]\n\nDespite the loss of Starkiller Base, the First Order, having decimated the government of the New Republic, began to reign. Confident enough to emerge from the shadows, Snoke decided to command his forces himself from his flagship, the Mega-class Star Dreadnought Supremacy. Acknowledging that their headquarters had been discovered, the Resistance was forced to evacuate D'Qar. The Resistance was nearly decimated by the First Order Navy. With a handful of survivors remaining, including General Leia Organa, the remains of the Resistance fled to Crait and then escaped from certain defeat aboard the Millennium Falcon thanks to the efforts of the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and Rey.[23]\n\nWhile talking about their adventures, Dameron revealed to Rey that when Starkiller Base destroyed the Hosnian system, he initially thought they were finished, assuming that the laser was to hit Takodana. He then stated that even the Resistance wasn't sure about what Starkiller was, as they only knew its location from following the trajectory of the lasers.[24]\n\nThe zealous Enric Pryde, who had witnessed the fall of the Galactic Empire and later obtained the rank of Allegiant General within the First Order, viewed the Starkiller as a costly mistake. In his eyes, blame for the base's destruction belonged to Hux, the young general who had long championed the weapon's power.[25] One year after Starkiller Base's destruction,[26] Kylo Ren informed his First Order Supreme Council that their forces would merge with the Sith Eternal, the secret cult of Darth Sidious hidden away on Exegol. Although General Domaric Quinn voiced skepticism at the idea, Pryde viewed the proposition as an essential correction to Hux's errors with Starkiller Base.[27]\n\nThe Sith Eternal's fleet, the Final Order, bolstered the resources of the First Order's navy and supplied them with Xyston-class Star Destroyers, capital ships equipped with planet-killing axial superlasers. While unable to destroy entire systems at once as the Starkiller once did, the massive Sith fleet had the potential to spread across the galaxy and subjugate countless worlds. After the Star Destroyer Derriphan annihilated the planet Kijimi, the Resistance fought a decisive battle against the Sith Eternal at Exegol, where they destroyed the Sith fleet and ended their planet-killing capabilities for good.[27]\n\nStarkiller Base was created for the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens, the first installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy.[2] The film's director, J.J. Abrams, stated that the superweapon's similarities to the two Death Stars from the original trilogy were intentional, as the new generation of Imperials within the First Order would want to prove that they were stronger and more advanced than their predecessors in the Galactic Empire. The base's name harkens back to the original name of Luke Skywalker, who George Lucas originally called Luke Starkiller.[13]\n\nAccording to Pablo Hidalgo of the Lucasfilm Story Group, the sub-hyperspace rip caused by the base's firing allowed the light from the novas to be temporarily visible as it happened on the surface of Takodana.[28] Hidalgo also stated that the base was mobile,[29] and that it had consumed a star before destroying the Hosnian system.[22]\n\nBased on information from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Star Wars Super Graphic: A Visual Guide to a Galaxy Far, Far Away, it is heavily implied that Starkiller Base is actually the planet Ilum. Both depict Ilum as strip-mined for kyber crystals by the Empire, resulting in a striking resemblance to Starkiller Base.[19][30] The connection between Ilum and Starkiller Base was officially confirmed in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary.[4]\n\nIn Star Wars Legends, there existed a space station called the Star Forge, which, like Starkiller Base, also drew in energy from a star to convert it into energy. However, instead of redirecting it through a destructive beam, the Star Forge converted the stellar matter into raw material to manufacture starships and war material meant for conquest.[31]\n\n\"Starkiller\" is the surname of the protagonist Annikin in the first draft of the original 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.[32]\n\nStarkiller Base, specifically Precinct 47 and the Command center, appears in the 2017 videogame, Star Wars Battlefront II. In the game's Galactic Assault mode, one of the game scenarios consists of players fighting for the Resistance landing on the surface, with the overall goal of freeing prisoners inside the base's detention block. They are presented with three sets of objectives, with each set needing to be completed to move on. Meanwhile, First Order players are given only one objective: kill 100 Resistance players before they can complete a set of their objectives, otherwise the kill quota will raise by 50, maxing out again at 100. For the first set of objectives, the Resistance players are tasked with planting bombs at a fuel station and turbolaser nearby the base's main gate. If successful, the Resistance must then capture a command post at the main gate of the base. Finally, if completed, they must override both the base's cell door and gate controls. If the Resistance wins, they are shown boarding transports and escaping. If the First Order wins, Starkiller Base fires.[8]\n\nThe base also appears as a potential map in the Heroes vs. Villains and Hero Showdown modes, along with the Strike mode. In the latter, Resistance players are tasked with rigging two TIE fighters with explosives.[8]",
