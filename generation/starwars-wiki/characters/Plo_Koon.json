  "content": "Plo Koon was a Force-sensitive Kel Dor Jedi Master who served as a noble member of the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Galactic Republic. He served as a respected Jedi General during the Clone Wars, a pan-galactic conflict between the Republic and its splinter state, the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the war he frequently undertook dangerous missions with the soldiers under his command, the 104th Battalion. Koon wore a breath mask to filter the air around him so that it matched his home planet of Dorin, and wore goggles to prevent his eye fluids from evaporating.\n\nAfter training his Padawan Bultar Swan to Jedi Knighthood, Koon fought in and survived the First Battle of Geonosis, which claimed the lives of nearly two hundred Jedi and became the opening salvo of the Clone Wars. Early in the war he embarked on a mission to track down the Separatist warship Malevolence. Following several attempts to destroy the weapon, Koon and several of his peers managed to take it down. Among the Jedi he often worked with was Ahsoka Tano, whom he had discovered years before the war and shared a special bond with. During the war he played vital roles in the First and Second battles of Felucia, the Battle of Lola Sayu, and the Battle of Kadavo. As the conflict thickened, Ahsoka was framed for a terrorist attack on the Jedi Temple and was subsequently removed from the Jedi Order. When the true culprit was discovered, Koon and the Council offered her a chance to rejoin, but she refused and left the Jedi Order.\n\nIn the last days of the Clone Wars, after the battles of Coruscant and Utapau, Koon led the 442nd Siege Battalion in the Battle of Cato Neimoidia. As he and a squadron of ARC-170 starfighters flew over the bridge cities following their victory, he perished in the crash when he was shot down by his troops during the issuance of Order 66, during which the Jedi were massacred across the galaxy by their own soldiers. Shortly later, Anakin, who was serving Darth Sidious would murder Viceroy Gunray and end the Clone Wars upon shutting down the battle droids.\n\nPlo Koon was born on the planet Dorin.[1] At some point, Koon was discovered by the Jedi Order and was selected to be the Padawan of Jedi Master Tyvokka.[11]\n\nAfter Warlord Guattako kidnapped several children to make them part of his army on the planet Oosalon, Jedi Master Mace Windu was sent in 34 BBY[14] to find and rescue them. Eventually Windu was able to defeat all of Guattako's army, Guattako was shot by one of the children. Shortly after Koon, Depa Billaba, and Qui-Gon Jinn arrived to help.[13]\n\nIn 33 BBY,[15] while on a mission to the planet Shili, the homeworld of the Togruta, Koon found a three-year old girl named Ahsoka Tano, who was sensitive to the Force[16] and had recently avoided a individual who pretended to be a Jedi to enslave Tano. That false Jedi had intercepted her village's signal to the Jedi and scared Tano, but she knew she could trust Koon as soon as her eyes laid upon him.[17] Koon brought Tano back to the Jedi Temple so she could be trained as a Jedi. The two kept in touch over the years, maintaining a close bond and friendship.[9][16]\n\nBy that year,[18] Koon had achieved the rank of Jedi Master and was elevated to the Jedi High Council. At that time, Koon was assisting with the refit of the Jedi's fleet of surface vehicles alongside Master Saesee Tiin. Koon was present at a council meeting in which Qui-Gon Jinn challenged the council to pay more attention to individuals in the galaxy and the living Force, stating that the Jedi Order was so focused on large-scale issues that they had lost sight of the smaller things in front of them. When it was suggested that the next closure would be the outpost on the planet Kwenn, which had been open for 200 years and was the result of significant Jedi effort, the council determined to meet in person on Kwenn before making the decision. They would plan an anniversary celebration for the people of Kwenn, in an effort to meet Jinn's challenge.[19]\n\nKoon and Tiin traveled to Kwenn together on a Jedi shuttle, landing at the spaceport on Capital Key. Koon found that he had to adjust his breathing unit for Kwenn's atmosphere, which had worsened since his last visit, but which was still better than Coruscant. With no mission other than a vague aim to render aid, the two hailed a Kwikhaul landspeeder taxi driven by the droid SK-89. Koon directed the droid to take them to the Bivall Colony on Parva Key, which he had visited long before, as it was likely that the Bivall refugees there could use some sort of aid. When SK-89 sped through an intersection and nearly hit another vehicle, Tiin and Koon discovered that this was her first time ever driving. Halfway through their trip, while they were on Zyboh Key, four other speeders boxed them in and began bumping them. At this point, Tiin took over driving and attempted to escape their attackers, but more speeders joined the chase. Koon stood on the back of the speeder, but hesitated to draw his lightsaber, sensing that something was off. Suddenly, the speeder was autopiloted back to the Kwikhaul depot. At the depot, the drivers and passengers of the other speeders formed a mob around them, and SK-89 informed them that it was she, not the Jedi, who were the target of their anger.[19]\n\nKoon and Tiin discovered that they had stumbled into the middle of a labor dispute at Kwikhaul. The owner, Fraxa, had replaced all the drivers with droids that morning, and the former employees had stormed the compound and destroyed the droids inside. Fraxa demanded that the Jedi arrest the workers for destroying private property. Instead, they listened to both points of view. Fraxa argued that she could no longer afford to employ organic drivers. The workers argued that the droids she was using were unsafe, and that Fraxa had plenty of money for herself. She replied that tourism and industry were waning on Kwenn, leaving less business for Kwikhaul. Koon, known for being an organizer of people, was somewhat stumped until suggesting that this was actually Tiin's area of expertise. Tiin halted the argument by pointing out that Kwikhaul's landspeeders could easily be repurposed to run on the water, allowing them to be used as water taxis and oceanic tourism craft. He offered to help with the retrofit. Then, he noticed the fleet of unused touring buses, and suggested they be modified and used by the droids to collect garbage off the streets. He offered to contact the droid mechanic Heezo at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to assist with repairing the droids which the workers had destroyed. These new initiatives satisfied both Fraxa and the Kwikhaul workers, and the two Jedi helped get the work started.[19]\n\nDuring the Jedi Council's time on Kwenn, Koon and Tiin continued working with Kwikhaul. Koon sent a speederbus to transport the group of teens which Master Even Piell had taken charge of. Koon and Tiin helped with Master Oppo Rancisis' rescue of a beached oroko; Tiin used girders to connect several repulsorcraft engines together into an open-framed flying platform and attempted to lift the oroko with cables. This idea failed because the terrified creature's grip on the ground increased as the cables were pulled. Koon suggested they bring the water to the oroko instead. He and Tiin set the hovering platform to spin and sabotaged the engines before swimming away. The platform crashed into the ocean, sending up a plume of water which the Jedi directed toward the beach with the Force, allowing the oroko to follow the wave back into the water. Although Tiin was pessimistic about the possibility of bringing prosperity back to Kwenn, Koon believed that the Jedi could teach the people of Kwenn to heal themselves.[19]\n\nThanks to various sources of intelligence, the Jedi were aware ahead of time that the allied pirate gangs led by Zilastra planned to attack Kwenn on Celebration Day. Koon prepared the staff of Kwikhaul, whom he and Tiin had been working with throughout their time on Kwenn, to provide rescues during the upcoming fighting. The taxis were stationed near the Gala Key Arena, and when violence broke out, Koon and SK-89 acted as dispatchers for the whole fleet. They helped move attendees to safety and transport various Jedi to where they were needed. The drivers also relayed information about the action back to Koon, including the movements of the casino barge Pelagic, which was acting as a headquarters for the pirates.[19]\n\nKoon's fleet of drivers also provided Master Depa Billaba with Zilastra's whereabouts when she went to the Jedi outpost to destroy it. As Billaba and her rescued charge Kylah Lohmata escaped the outpost later, the rolling library cart they used fell apart and sent the two flying. Luckily, Masters Koon, Windu, and Yoda had arrived just in time to break their fall with the Force. Koon joined the rest of the Jedi Council members to speak with Zilastra after her arrest.[19]\n\nBefore returning to Coruscant, Koon and Tiin restored the ARC-8 starfighter that Tiin had borrowed from Fraxa during the battle. Koon felt very satisfied with all the work the Jedi had done on Kwenn, but Tiin only looked ahead to all the work still left for him back on Coruscant. Koon expressed to Tiin that despite Tiin's gruff and sometimes antisocial nature, he was good at telling people the unadorned truth when they needed to hear it, and should make sure he wasn't always holed up in a hangar or meeting.[19]\n\nDuring the blockade of the planet Naboo by the Trade Federation, the Jedi were asked by Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum to send Jedi to resolve the blockade. Master Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi were sent to negotiate, but the Trade Federation attempted to kill them. After escaping Naboo with Queen Padmé Amidala and reaching Coruscant, Jinn came before the Jedi Council and described a lightsaber duel he had on Tatooine with a Zabrak, whom Jinn believed to be a Sith. Jinn also presented Anakin Skywalker, a young slave he had freed on Tatooine, before the Jedi Council, stating that he believed him to be the Chosen One. The boy had a high midi-chlorian count and a good grasp on the Force, but Koon, along with the rest of Council, was skeptical about the return of the Sith and denied Jinn's wishes to train Skywalker as a Jedi, due to his age. Eventually Kenobi took the job of training young Anakin after the brutal death of his master.[6]\n\nFollowing the death of Jinn at the hands of the warrior Darth Maul, during the liberation of Naboo from the Trade Federation, Koon traveled to the world along with most of the other Jedi Council members, for Jinn's funeral. The Jedi Council then decided to elevate Obi-Wan Kenobi to the rank of Jedi Knight and allowed him to take Skywalker as his Padawan in order to honor the dying wish of Master Jinn.[6]\n\nKoon still served on the Council ten years after the Invasion of Naboo.[8] Koon also trained a Padawan of his own, Bultar Swan.[11] With Koon training her well,[12] Swan became a Jedi Knight shortly before the First Battle of Geonosis.[20]\n\nDuring this time thousands of star systems joined a secessionist movement who wanted independence from the Galactic Republic. The council feared that if a pan-galactic war to break out they wouldn't have enough manpower to defend the Republic from the Separatist threat. Around this time, the life of Senator Padmé Amidala was threatened by an assassination attempt, causing the Council to assign Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker as protection for the Senator. Koon also sat in on a meeting between the Jedi Council and Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, who discussed the growing influence of the Secessionist Movement and the threat of an imminent war between them and the Republic. Later, Koon was present in Chancellor Palpatine's office along with other senators and Jedi as the issue of whether Palpatine should take emergency powers was debated.[8]\n\nKoon was one of the[8] 212 Jedi[21] who formed an assault team to rescue Kenobi from Geonosis, along with his Padawan Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, who had been captured attempting to free Kenobi. Koon and his fellow Jedi revealed themselves during their allies attempted execution in the Petranaki Arena. A battle soon erupted between the Jedi and the Geonosians, who were reinforced by a massive droid army. As the strike team's numbers dwindled, Koon was one of several Jedi survivors who gathered in the middle of the arena. Dooku ordered the droid army to halt its attack and offered the Jedi a chance to surrender, but they refused to stand down. As the droids prepared to execute them, Koon and the other survivors were saved by the arrival of Yoda and the clone army, which had been secretly funded and created by the cloners of Kamino a decade before at the behest of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas.[8]\n\nKoon and his fellow Jedi escaped the arena aboard several Republic attack gunships. The Jedi joined the clone army in assaulting the droid army and Confederate vessels stationed on the planet. Although Koon and the Republic forces emerged victorious from Geonosis, more than a hundred Jedi died during the battle while Dooku and the Confederate leaders escaped. The fight on Geonosis was only the first battle of the galactic conflict that soon became known as the Clone Wars.[8]\n\nNow a Jedi General, Koon was given command of the 104th Battalion, also called the Wolf Pack Battalion,[22] which also earned him command of the Wolfpack squad subunit[23] and the callsign of Wolf Leader for starfighter operations.[24] In the early stages of the war, Koon and Clone Commander Wolffe led a fleet of three Venator-class Star Destroyers from his flagship Triumphant while searching for a mysterious Separatist warship, the Malevolence, that had been destroying Republic fleets under the command of General Grievous. After tracking down the vessel to the Abregado system, Koon ordered his fleet to engage the enemy while he contacted General Anakin Skywalker and his apprentice Ahsoka Tano, whose forces were stationed in the nearby Bith system, to request reinforcements. While conversing with them, the Malevolence jammed Republic communications and fired its secret weapon, a giant ion cannon that disabled all three of Koon's vessels and left them vulnerable to attack. He ordered an evacuation as the Malevolence began destroying the ships, and escaped in an escape pod alongside Wolffe, Sergeant Sinker, and Boost.[9]\n\nAs they waited for rescue, Koon and his men worked to fix the damage to the pod while searching the debris field for other survivors. After Sinker noted that it would not make strategic sense for rescue to be sent for them, Koon reassured his men that their lives mattered and that he was sure rescue would come. They spotted another pod which had been broken into by a boarding pod, resulting in the death of its survivors. They picked up a distress call from another pod under attack from the boarding pod, and witnessed it get destroyed.[9]\n\nThe craft then noticed Koon's pod, and moved into position to attack them. Koon led Sinker and Boost outside of the pod to engage the rocket battle droids outside of the boarding ship, ordering Wolffe to keep the signal alive. After a brief firefight, Koon pushed Sinker forward after the hunter pod began crushing their own, who destroyed two of the droids while the remaining droid took cover with the hatch. Koon then destroyed the hunter pod before it could crush their own, restoring communication, but also alerted the Malevolence to their presence. Before they could be destroyed, Skywalker and Tano arrived in the Twilight and rescued Koon and his men before escaping the system.[9]\n\nWith the nature of the Malevolence now revealed, the Jedi began making plans to destroy it. Koon attended a briefing where Anakin Skywalker outlined his plan use Shadow Squadron to fly past the defenses of the massive vessel and destroy its bridge, ridding the galaxy of both the ship and General Grievous in one move. Koon was uneasy about the aggressive and difficult nature of the mission, but when word arrived that the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center was the next target, he resolved to aid the mission by flying escort in his Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor, the Blade of Dorin,[25] which had been gifted to him by Skywalker.[26]\n\nIn order to beat the Malevolence to the medical station, the Jedi and clone pilots headed through a shortcut in the Kaliida Nebula. When Skywalker mentioned that the shortcut was called the Balmorra Run, Koon realized that the nebula was also the breeding ground of the space-faring neebrays and advised Skywalker to find another route. They were soon caught in a massive herd of the giant creatures, and had no choice but to fly through them to the other side. The squadron managed to make it through the nebula, with a few ships suffering only minor damage.[25]\n\nThey arrived at the medical station just before the Malevolence, and quickly began their attack run against the Separatist warship. Fighting through a wave of vulture droids, Koon and half of Shadow Squadron avoided a blast from the Malevolence's ion canon. With half of their force destroyed or disabled, Koon noted that they no longer had the firepower to take out the bridge of the enemy warship. After he and Tano urged Skywalker to change their plan, they targeted the warship's ion cannon instead as it prepared to fire upon the medical station. They severely damaged the weapon, which malfunctioned and caused explosions to go off across the Malevolence, subsequently disabling the ship's hyperdrive. Koon and the surviving members of Shadow Squadron docked with the medical station as Master Obi-Wan Kenobi pursued the crippled Separatist vessel with his taskforce.[25]\n\nMaster Koon, Skywalker, and Tano soon joined Kenobi on the Resolute to help command the pursuit of the Malevolence. Although the enemy flagship was heavily damaged, it was still able to withstand the firepower of the present Republic forces. Koon suggested summoning reinforcements to help finish off the ship, but Skywalker informed him that that the closest ships were Master Luminara Unduli's, which were currently engaged with a Separatist force and could not join them until they had been defeated. The Jedi were then forced to stop firing on the Malevolence when it captured the vessel of Naboo Senator Padmé Amidala. Kenobi and Skywalker departed the bridge to launch a rescue mission, and Koon noted to Tano that her master always seemed to crave such adventure and excitement. Koon then contacted Unduli, who informed him that she was on her way to join them and would be ready to aid in the Malevolence's destruction once the senator had been rescued. Once Amidala was safely off the ship, Koon ordered the fleet to open fire once more. The Malevolence ended up destroying itself by crashing into a nearby moon after Skywalker sabotaged it by reprogramming the ship's navigation computer before escaping.[27]\n\nIn 21 BBY,[29] Koon took part in the evacuation of Felucia, where Separatist forces had trapped Republic forces led by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Tano. As his fleet engaged the enemy vessels surrounding the jungle world, Koon lead a group of fighters to protect several gunships aiding in the evacuation. He ordered his wingman Warthog to defend the gunships while he took out the Separatist fighters in their path. After punching a hole through the enemy vessels, they reached the atmosphere but were followed by a group of Vulture droids.[28]\n\nWarthog was pursued by two of the fighters, but Koon saved his wingman and shot both droid ships down. The transports landed and successfully evacuated Kenobi and Skywalker's soldiers, but Tano only reluctantly retreated, putting her troops and the evacuation at risk. Koon's fighters escorted the transports back to the fleet, which successfully escaped the system and returned to Coruscant. Koon then attended the Jedi Council hearing regarding Tano's reckless behavior during the battle. The Council decided to place her on guard duty at the Temple Archives to reflect on her actions and remove her from the battlefield.[28]\n\nWhen Jedi Council member Eeth Koth was captured by General Grievous, Master Koon attended a gathering of Jedi via hologram to view the message Grievous sent the Jedi Order. Grievous vowed to destroy the Jedi and make Koth suffer before killing him. As the Jedi debated what to do, Koon was informed by Commander Wolffe that he had discovered a message in the recording from Koth. They replayed the message, and the other Jedi noticed Koth using hand signals to give them his location in the Saleucami system. The Jedi sent a strike team led by Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Master Adi Gallia, and Jedi Anakin Skywalker to rescue Master Koth. They succeeded, but Grievous managed to escape from the battle.[30]\n\nWhile Koon was giving a briefing in the Jedi Temple regarding reinforcing Republic positions along the Hydian Way to counter Grievous' forces, Anakin Skywalker's astromech droid R2-D2 burst into the conference room and knocked Koon's droid out of the way. Koon ordered R2 to give them the urgent message he was carrying, and R2 showed the gathered Jedi a message from Skywalker and Master Mace Windu, who were trapped in the wreckage of Windu's ship, the Endurance, on Vanqor after an assassination attempt by a group of bounty hunters led by Boba Fett, who sought vengeance on Windu for killing his father on Geonosis. Koon ordered for his ship to be prepared immediately, and he traveled to Vanqor with Ahsoka Tano and the Wolfpack to rescue his fellow Jedi. Koon and Tano used the Force to hold the wreckage steady while his men rescued Windu and Skywalker.[32]\n\nThe Jedi soon received a message from Boba and his mentor, Aurra Sing. Koon showed the message to Windu and Skywalker, who were recovering from their injuries in the Jedi Temple. The bounty hunters revealed they had taken three hostages, Admiral Kilian, Commander Ponds, and another clone officer, from the Endurance. They threatened to kill all three if Windu did not come to them, and Sing murdered Ponds to prove their intent. Windu wished to find and rescue the remaining hostages, but Koon told him that his presence would only further anger Fett. He volunteered to hunt down Fett and his accomplices with the aid of Tano.[31]\n\nKoon and Tano began their investigation by heading to the Coruscant Underworld. He explained to Tano that they needed to locate associates of Jango Fett who Boba may have made contact with, as he had done with Sing. They started in a area where Jango was said to have frequented, and Koon warned Tano to be cautious. They investigated several bars, and as they headed for the fifth one, Koon advised Tano to be more subtle, noting that she had picked up many of her master's more straightforward ways. They entered Tiggs Leo's tavern, where Koon began to question Tiggs Leo while Tano eavesdropped on the crowd. She overheard a Nautolan named Fong Do mention that his friend Castas had just been killed on Florrum by Sing, but she was caught and attacked by the thug and his friends. Koon activated his lightsaber, and the two Jedi slowly backed out of the bar before Tano distracted the patrons by tossing money into the crowd, allowing them to escape. Koon noted that was not very subtle, but congratulated her on finding out the location of Sing.[31]\n\nTraveling to Florrum, Koon and Tano landed at the base of the notorious Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka, who greeted them and escorted the Jedi to the bar. Koon guessed he was leading them into a trap, which Ohnaka confirmed, but he informed them that he had no part in whatever Sing and Fett had planned. Koon entered the bar and sat at a table with Sing, while Fett came up behind him with a blaster and demanded to know where Windu was. Koon offered to settle things peacefully, but Sing contacted the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk and told him to execute the hostages if she gave the word. She was prepared to kill all of them to get Fett his revenge, but Koon noted that she seemed to want them dead more. Tano then struck off Sing's antenna, severing her link with Bossk, and held her lightsaber to Sing's throat. Koon and Tano attempted to convince Fett to stand down, but the two bounty hunters attacked. Koon destroyed Sing's blasters, but Fett used an explosive to make everyone take cover. As Sing and Fett attempted to flee, Koon used the Force to pull Fett back to him while Tano pursued Sing. Koon began interrogating Fett about the location of the hostages with the aid of Ohnaka, who convinced Fett to tell them by noting that it was the honorable thing to do and that it would be what Jango would have wanted. Fett gave up the location of the hostages, who were rescued by Tano. Fett and Bossk were taken into custody by Koon and taken to prison on Coruscant, while Sing was believed dead after she crashed in Slave I.[31]\n\nAfter the arrest of Fett, Tano went on several more successful missions. Koon was among the Jedi Council members who congratulated the Padawan on her successes after her mission to Mandalore helped uncover a Mandalorian black market conspiracy.[34]\n\nFollowing an assault on the Temple of Eedit, a small Jedi Temple located on the planet Devaron, Plo Koon joined fellow Jedi Council members Obi-Wan Kenobi, Adi Gallia, and Saesee Tiin in meeting the clone commando Delta Squad on a landing platform of the Jedi Temple. The commandos brought with them the bodies of Jedi Master Halsey and his apprentice Knox, who had been brutally killed alongside their clone troopers defending the Temple of Eedit. The four masters debated who had the skill to so thoroughly defeat two Jedi, and Gallia wondered if Count Dooku's assassin Asajj Ventress, thought dead since the Battle of Sullust, was still alive. Koon suggested that this was potentially a new threat to the Jedi Order, and could perhaps be a new Sith Lord.[33]\n\nWhen Master Even Piell and members of his crew were captured by Separatist forces seeking the coordinates of the secret hyperspace lane known as the Nexus Route, Master Koon briefed the team that would be rescuing him from the dreaded Citadel, a prison built specially for fallen Jedi located on the inhospitable world of Lola Sayu. Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Anakin Skywalker would lead a select group of clone troopers into the prison by using carbon-freezing to hide their lifesigns. Following the briefing, Koon was approached by Tano, who was being kept off the mission by Skywalker. Koon noted that he had the ability to do so, but Tano felt he was simply being overprotective of her. As the strike team departed, Koon watched their vessel leave the Jedi Temple and wished the Force to be with them. Unbeknownst to Koon, Tano had also been frozen in carbonite and arranged to go on the mission.[35]\n\nAs the strike team progressed through their mission, Koon monitored coded transmissions sent by them to the Jedi Temple. The team successfully freed Piell and his officers from their cells, but had to split up into two groups. Koon informed Masters Windu and Tiin of the situation and the locations where the two groups were planning to be extracted. Windu questioned what would happen if their extraction failed, and Koon claimed that they would need an entire fleet to get the team free from the Citadel. Kenobi soon contacted the Temple and informed Koon that while the two groups had rejoined, their shuttle had been destroyed and they were now fleeing on foot from the Separatist garrison. Koon told him that they would be deploying a fleet to rescue the team from Lola Sayu.[36]\n\nKoon led a fleet to Lola Sayu, along with Jedi Masters Tiin, Gallia, and Kit Fisto. En route the planet, Koon laid out his strategy to rescue the strike team. He ordered Tiin to lead the fighter attack on the enemy fleet to create a hole in their defenses, through which Koon would escort gunships down to pick up the team. Gallia noted that if the team was not at the extraction point Koon would have to leave them behind or put the fleet at risk, but Koon was sure that they would be waiting for them. When the fleet emerged from hyperspace, Koon wished his comrades good luck from his gunship. After some difficulty they managed to break through the Separatist defenses, and Koon's dropship reached the extraction point, where they found the remaining members of the strike team and captives waiting. Piell had been killed during the battle, but passed his information onto Tano. As they fled back to the fleet, Koon ordered Admiral Barton Coburn to recall their fighters and prepare the fleet to jump to hyperspace. After safely landing aboard one of the ships, Koon gave the order for the fleet to leave the system.[37]\n\nAfter returning to Coruscant, Koon and the surviving strike team members landed at the Jedi Temple. Koon and his fellow Jedi mourned the loss of Piell, and he noted that Piell's sacrifice secured the Nexus Route for the Republic. However, Captain Wilhuff Tarkin, who had memorized one half of the coordinates, stated he would only share them with Supreme Chancellor Palpatine while Tano would only give her half to the Jedi Council. Yoda stated he would speak with the Chancellor about the situation. As the others left, Skywalker asked Koon if he had assigned Tano to the mission. Koon covered for Tano by claiming that he had.[37]\n\nKoon soon returned to Felucia alongside Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano to secure the planet for the Republic. They planned for a attack against a outpost on the planet that was receiving reinforcements from General Grievous. Watching from a nearby ridge, Koon planned to divide their forces into three groups to assault the base. He decided to assault the left flank while Skywalker assaulted the base's front gate and Tano led a team over the back wall. Once all the teams were in position, Koon ordered the attack to begin. As Skywalker assaulted the front gate, Koon leapt up the left wall of the base, followed by Commander Wolffe and his troopers on jetpacks. They quickly cut through the enemy forces, with Koon and Skywalker's forces meeting in the middle with Tano's men. Tano was not with her men, having been guarding their flank as they scaled the wall. She did not respond to calls over her comlink, having been captured by Trandoshan hunters who kidnapped beings to hunt down for sport.[38]\n\nKoon and Skywalker's men searched the nearby jungle for Tano, but found no trace of her. Koon let all Republic forces throughout the Outer Rim, as well as spies within the Confederacy, know of Tano's disappearance so they would be alerted if anyone found her. He then noted that with their mission on Felucia over, he and Skywalker needed to return to Coruscant. Skywalker was unwilling to abandon the search for his padawan, but Koon told him that his emotions were clouding his judgment and that it was time for them to depart. After returning to the Temple, Skywalker continued to oversee the search for his missing padawan. Koon talked to him about how strong Tano was, and that her determination, which she shared with her master, would help her survive. He also cautioned that Skywalker might not be able to find Tano, but that she would instead use her training to make her own way back to the Jedi.[38]\n\nTano was returned to the Jedi Temple by the Wookiee General Tarfful and the bounty hunter Sugi alongside two Jedi younglings, Jinx and O-Mer. She and her fellow Jedi had fought back against the Trandoshans with the aid of another Wookiee named Chewbacca. Koon and Skywalker were among the Jedi who welcomed the three young Jedi back to the Temple. Koon expressed his relief in seeing Tano safe before moving to converse with Yoda, Windu, Tarfful, Sugi, and several other Wookiees.[39]\n\nAfter Master Gallia was captured by General Grievous, Master Koon led a fleet to rescue her from Grievous' ship. Koon boarded the vessel with soldiers from the Wolfpack, with Commander Wolffe successfully freeing Gallia while Grievous fled. Koon and Gallia reunited after ending resistance aboard the vessel, and were surprised by two droids, C-3PO and R2-D2, who claimed to belong to Senator Padmé Amidala. Wolffe recognized the two droids and confirmed their identity. C-3PO began talking about how he and his companion had just been on a adventure, which prompted Koon to suggest that they tell Wolffe all about it, much to his second-in-command's dismay.[40]\n\nWhen the Togruta colony of Kiros was occupied by the Separatists, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano were dispatched to free the neutral world. They reported to the Jedi Council that the Zygerrians were behind the occupation, and that they had taken all of the colonists to be sold as slaves. The council was troubled by this news, and Koon speculated that the Zygerrians were likely siding with Dooku and the Separatists so they could rebuild their slave empire, which had been destroyed by the Jedi centuries before. Koon noticed that Yoda looked particularly concerned and questioned what troubled him. Yoda told the rest of the council he sensed a greater hand in this affair, noting that slavery was a powerful tool to aid in the rise of the Sith.[41]\n\nIn order to find the missing Togruta colonists and stop the reemergence of the Zygerrian slave empire, the Jedi Council sent Kenobi, Skywalker, Tano, and Clone Captain Rex to infiltrate the Zygerrian homeworld Zygerria. Although they were exposed and enslaved, Skywalker and Tano managed to escape and let the Republic know that Kenobi, Rex, and the colonists were being held at a slave processing facility on the planet Kadavo. Plo Koon led a small taskforce to the system to liberate the slaves, leading a group of fighters to cover his dropships and a Arquitens-class light cruiser. Koon shot down several Zygerrian fightercraft, but could not destroy the ray shielded cannons which defended the facility which were preventing the cruiser from rescuing the imperiled colonists. Anakin managed to destroy the towers, allowing the cruiser to move into position below the facility and rescue the slaves. Once all the slaves and Republic forces had been rescued, Koon ordered his gunships to destroy the slaving facility.[24]\n\nWhen a plot was uncovered suggesting that the Separatists were going to try to kidnap or assassinate Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the Jedi Council decided to fake Obi-Wan Kenobi's death so he could go undercover as Rako Hardeen and get close to Moralo Eval, the plot's supposed mastermind. After the fake assassination occurred, Koon attended the \"funeral\" of his fellow council member. During the funeral, Ahsoka Tano expressed her concern to Koon about the behavior of her master Anakin Skywalker, who was not aware of the council's plan.[42] Kenobi managed to earn Eval's trust and get a place on his team to kidnap the Chancellor at the Festival of Light on Naboo. Koon and the rest of the council brought Skywalker and Tano in on their plot. They and most of the council put together a plan to stop the attempt and capture the conspirators. They succeeded, and Kenobi and Skywalker also stopped another attempt by Count Dooku to capture Palpatine.[43]\n\nIn 19 BBY,[45] following the bombing of one of the Jedi Temple's hangars, Koon and the Council recalled Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano from the defense of Cato Neimoidia so they could investigate. Koon and the others were worried that a Jedi was responsible for the attack, and thus needed someone who had not been present at the Temple and were thus above suspicion.[46] Skywalker and Tano soon arrested Letta Turmond for feeding her husband, a worker at the Temple, nano-droids that turned him into the bomb, but they suspected that someone, possibly a Jedi, had given her the orders to do so. Koon then attended the funeral for the six Jedi killed in the bombing.[47]\n\nHowever, Tano herself was accused of being behind the bombing after Turmond was choked to death by the Force while Tano was in her cell. She was arrested, but soon escaped from the prison with several clone troopers being killed by a lightsaber during her escape.[47] The Jedi Council called an emergency meeting to discuss the situation, with Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin attending via holocam. Tarkin was leading the Republic military's investigation of the incident and was pushing for Tano's capture and prosecution for the murder of the clone troopers. Koon refused to believe that Tano was responsible for killing the troopers, but Tarkin dismissed the beliefs of the Jedi Council as \"irrelevant\" and ended the transmission. Koon and Skywalker were both sent with teams of clones to search the lowers levels of Coruscant, where Tano had fled, to find and bring her back to the Temple so the Jedi could discover the truth.[44]\n\nAs they arrived in the lower levels, Koon and Skywalker witnessed Tano with Ventress. The two of them fled from the Jedi and their clones, who spread out to search the level for them. Koon was soon contacted by Commander Wolffe, who reported to him that his team had found Tano, but she and Ventress had defeated them, albeit without killing any of the clones. Skywalker and Wolffe later tracked down Tano again, this time successfully stunning her. In the warehouse where they found her they discovered the same type of explosives used in the bombing of the Jedi Temple. As they transported Tano back to the Temple, Koon reported to Yoda what they had discovered, but that they were still unsure of where Ventress was or her connection to the situation.[44]\n\nThe Jedi Council attempted to insist that they try Tano in accordance with Jedi tradition, but Tarkin and the Senate demanded that she be expelled from the Jedi Order and turned over to them for trial in a military court. The Council decided to do as the senate asked, although there was disagreement within the Council over the decision. Koon was one of five council masters present in the Chamber of Judgment, where Tano was formally expelled from the Order. Koon questioned Tano's association with Ventress while on the run, and Tano claimed that she believed Ventress had been trying to help her clear her name. After the expulsion was completed, Tano was turned over to Tarkin and put on trial. Koon was one of several Council members present during the proceedings, and witnessed Skywalker arrive with Barriss Offee in custody near the end of the proceedings, revealing that he had discovered she was the one who had masterminded the bombing and framing of Tano. Offee confessed before the court that she was responsible and that she had done so to expose the failings and corruption of the Jedi Order through the Clone Wars, claiming that the Order had fallen to the dark side and that the Republic was failing.[48]\n\nWith Tano's name cleared, she was released by the Republic and returned to the Jedi Temple. Koon was one of several Council masters who gathered to welcome Tano back. On the Council's behalf, he offered their most humble apologies to Tano, solemnly stating that they had been wrong to accuse her of treachery. However, Tano refused to accept their invitation to rejoin the Order. Koon watched mournfully as Tano left the Council chamber, and held Master Kenobi back from following Skywalker as he went after his former apprentice.[48]\n\nLater that year, a distress signal was picked up by the Jedi Temple from a ship belonging to the long dead Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas and Koon was dispatched by the Jedi Council to locate the source. Tracking the signal to the desert moon of Oba Diah, Koon and the Wolfpack began searching for the vessel. After some difficulty with a sandstorm, they located the wreckage of a T-6 shuttle. Inside, Koon discovered the lightsaber of Sifo-Dyas. He order his men to clear the area and take all of the wreckage back to Coruscant. He contacted the Jedi Council and informed them of his findings. The Council discussed Sifo-Dyas' role in the formation of the clone army, with Koon noting that prior to the Clone Wars, Sifo-Dyas had claimed to have seen a great war coming which would require the Republic to have an army. Following this meeting, Koon holographically attended a briefing by Master Jocasta Nu as she explained how Sifo-Dyas had perished on Felucia while trying to negotiate a peace treaty between two tribes. Koon inquired about what had become of his body, but Nu informed him that she did not know, as information about the mission had been sealed by the Office of the Supreme Chancellor.[49]\n\nKoon then returned to Coruscant, where he met with Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Anakin. The four Jedi discussed new evidence related to the mysterious presence of a second Jedi on Felucia and the missing Silman, a aide to former Chancellor Valorum who had accompanied Sifo-Dyas on a mission to meet with the leaders of the Pyke Syndicate. Koon noted that the Pyke's headquarters was located on Oba Diah, which the moon where he had found Sifo-Dyas's ship and lightsaber orbited. Obi-Wan and Anakin were dispatched to Oba Diah, where they discovered that Silman was still alive as a prisoner of the Pykes, but he was murdered by Count Dooku before he could tell them much. They did learn that Count Dooku was Darth Tyranus, and that he had been responsible for the creation of the clone army. Koon and the other Council members were disturbed by this revelation, but resolved to cover it up to prevent the Republic from losing faith in the loyalty of the clone army.[49]\n\nPlo Koon later attended a Jedi Council meeting where they viewed a transmission from Jedi Master Chubor, who was commanding the Republic's evacuation of civilians from Mahranee, which had fallen to the Separatists. He and the other Council members in attendance, along with Anakin Skywalker, watched in dismay as Count Dooku ordered his fleet to open fire on the refugee convoy, killing Chubor and the thousands of innocent civilians aboard his ships, while droid forces on Mahranee were ordered to exterminate any remaining Mahran. Dooku claimed that the responsibility for the tragedy rested with the Jedi for continuing to resist his cause and supporting the Republic. The Council lamented that the Jedi were stretched too thin to adequately defend every world under threat of Separatist invasion. Koon bemoaned that they could barely count the number of dead from the war, but that the near-extinction of the Mahran was one of the greatest tragedies yet. Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi placed the blame for all the deaths in the war on Dooku, but Koon noted that they were using the same words that Dooku had in pinning the blame for the deaths on the Jedi. Windu then wondered if perhaps they did earn some of the blame by not doing all they could to end the war, and proposed assassinating Dooku. While Kenobi was against at the idea and Yoda was reluctant, Koon and the rest of the Council members eventually agreed that they should send a Jedi to assassinate the former Jedi Master turned Sith Lord. The Council decided to send Jedi Master Quinlan Vos to carry out the mission with the aid of Dooku's former apprentice Asajj Ventress.[50]\n\nA few months into the mission, Vos ceased reporting to Kenobi after claiming that he had won Ventress' trust and aid in the attempt to kill Dooku. Koon speculated that Ventress may have discovered that Vos was a Jedi and killed him for deceiving her, but Kenobi did not think that was likely, as Ventress would have made sure the Jedi Order would know of her anger over such an action. Ventress eventually contacted Kenobi and informed him that she and Vos had failed to kill Dooku and that Vos had been captured and turned to the dark side. Over the next several months, Vos emerged as Admiral Enigma and led Separatist forces to victory in several battles. As Koon and several other Council members met to determine what to do about Vos, they were surprised when Kenobi, Skywalker, and Jedi Knight Akar-Deshu brought Ventress into the Council chamber. Koon reached for his lightsaber, but Kenobi informed the Council that he had promised Ventress safe passage into the Temple and that she was there to aid them in finding and defeating Vos. Koon was skeptical that she was telling the truth, but Kenobi convinced them to listen to her. Ventress admitted she had taught Vos to use the dark side and that the two of them had become lovers. The Council dismissed Ventress and the knights to discuss Ventress offer, and Kenobi suggested that they could capture and redeem Vos. Koon sadly noted that not all who fell to the dark side could be saved. When word arrived that Taris was about to come under attack by Vos' forces, the Council decided to offer Ventress a pardon in exchange for her aid in capturing Vos.[50]\n\nThe mission was successful, and the Jedi discovered that Vos had not fallen to the dark side, but had instead been a captive of Dooku for several months after pretending to serve him. Ventress was convinced that Vos had fallen to the dark side, but the Council tested him on several small missions over the next month and concluded that he was trustworthy. Koon and several other Council members met to determine if Vos could be returned to duty. Kenobi reported that he believed Vos was ready, although Koon wondered if Dooku could have broken him, noting that a former Jedi Master under Dooku's influence would be a great threat to the Jedi Order. Kenobi reassured them that he was satisfied by Vos' account of his time with Dooku, which Koon and the rest of the Council, with the exception of Windu, accepted. They decided to utilize the knowledge of Separatist operations Vos had gained during his captivity, and dispatched Kenobi, Vos, Skywalker, and Desh to capture a Separatist supply storage base. They successfully destroyed the forces defending the base, but had to abandon it after Vos discovered the asteroid in which the base was located was rigged with explosives. Koon and the Council then sent Kenobi, Vos, and Skywalker to destroy a listening post on Vanqor, but they discovered that it was abandoned and all useful information deleted upon their arrival.[50]\n\nGrowing suspicious, Yoda, Kenobi, and Windu determined that Vos had indeed secretly fallen to the dark side and was warning Dooku about the Jedi's operations. Koon and Master Ki-Adi-Mundi joined the three other Masters at an emergency meeting to determine how they should deal with Vos. Windu suggested that they execute him for his betrayal of the Order and the extreme risk of attempting to imprison a fallen Jedi Master, which Koon and Ki-Adi-Mundi supported. Kenobi instead convinced them to test Vos by sending him once again to kill Dooku and hope that he would take this opportunity to reject the dark side. Vos accepted the mission, not knowing of the Council's plan to have Obi-Wan and Anakin shadow him with a task force that included Desh and Jedi Knight Kav Bayons, and Vos once again recruited Ventress to aid him in assassinating Dooku at the Second battle of Christophsis. The mission ended with the death of Desh and Bayons at the hands of Dooku and Vos, who had indeed fallen to the dark side in an attempt to learn the identity of Darth Sidious, Dooku's Sith Master.[50] Ventress was apparently[51] killed by Dooku by Force lightning, but her death caused Vos to reject the dark side and submit to capture by Kenobi and Skywalker, who returned him to the Jedi Temple, where he admitted all his crimes before the Jedi Council and submitted himself to them for judgment. The Council allowed Vos to work alongside Yoda to redeem himself, and eventually Koon and the others gained enough trust in Vos to place him in Kenobi's care and allow him to return Ventress' body to her homeworld of Dathomir.[50]\n\nSometime after,[52] Koon was present at a meeting during which the Council heard Yoda's report of a devastating weapon known as Operation: Titan that would turn the tide of war in favor of the Confederacy. However, the available information on the enemy project was insufficient and Obi-Wan Kenobi mentioned that Anakin Skywalker's forces had recently captured a Separatist frigate, suggesting that they sweep the vessel's databanks. Yoda agreed, deciding to go join Skywalker himself. Yoda and Skywalker followed their leads and learned that Operation: Titan involved the construction of a new droid army containing \"megadroids.\"[53] The two later reported to the Council that the megadroids were under construction on the planet Golatha and informed them that they planned to destroy the factory there before the megadroids could be deployed on the battlefield,[54] a task that they were ultimately successful in completing.[55]\n\nAround the time of the Battle of Yerbana, Plo Koon had been dispatched to Cato Neimoidia[57] to coordinate the efforts of the 442nd Siege Battalion.[10] He attended multiple meetings of Jedi and clone leadership via hologram, including one as he piloted his Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor into battle.[57] Koon helped secure a Republic victory at Cato Neimoidia. Following the battle, he was flying on a patrol flight[22] but was caught unaware when Darth Sidious initiated Order 66, which caused all the clone troopers to turn on the Jedi under the influence of their inhibitor chips. Koon was shot down in his Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor by clone pilot Jag, perishing as his fighter exploded and crashed.[56]\n\nAround a year after Order 66, Tano met the Sullustan woman Malat in Selda's cantina on Raada. The compassionate woman slightly reminded her of Koon. She also felt a natural trust towards the Togruta bartender Selda, who was also kind to her, like she had felt towards Koon.[59] Alternatively, Skywalker, who had become the Sith Lord Darth Vader, counted Koon as one of the people from his past who he rarely thought of. During his mission to Ryloth, Koon's name was one of several memories that impacted him.[60]\n\nShortly after the Battle of Fortress Vader, Vader entered a portal constructed by Darth Momin to resurrect his wife Padmé Amidala. While walking through visions, he encountered Koon along with many Jedi with their lightsabers ready to battle him. However, Vader killed all the illusions, impaling Koon through the chest along with Shaak Ti as the words \"Let the past die\" resounded in his mind.[61]\n\nPlo Koon was a Kel Dor male[1] Jedi Master, who stood at 1.88 meters, or 6 feet 2 inches.[4] He[1] was 80 kilograms[5] and had orange skin.[6]\n\nKoon was considered level-headed and unflappably calm and was among the wisest members of the Jedi Order. He was deeply concerned with every form of life. Although he didn't consider himself particularly personable and was aware that his appearance could be frightening to other species, Koon was generally optimistic, and believed in the Order's ability to do good.[19] Koon also had shared a special bond with Ahsoka Tano, whom he brought to the Jedi Order as a toddler and continued to be an important mentor to her throughout her time as a Jedi.[3] Koon always thought about how to help others, even if he himself was tired or busy.[59] His bond with the clone troopers under his command was particularly strong, with each and every member of the Wolfpack knowing that Koon cared deeply for them and would risk his life again and again to save theirs.[4] Koon had a generally reassuring presence, which a young Ahsoka Tano could sense immediately upon meeting him.[59]\n\nAlthough Koon was not Tano's master, they maintained a close relationship throughout her time as a Padawan learner.[16] When Tano was framed for murder and treason, Koon found it difficult to believe that the girl he'd brought into the Jedi Order could have fallen into darkness. However since the evidence against Tano seemed overwhelming and the Galactic Senate demanded that Ahsoka stand trial before them, he joined the Council in expelling her from the Order. After her innocence was proven and the real traitor apprehended, Koon apologized on the council's behalf to Tano and inviting her to rejoin the Order. He was deeply saddened when Tano instead chose to walk away from the only life she'd ever known.[62] However, the choice helped to save Ahsoka's life, and she went on to survive Order 66[16] and serve the Rebellion.[63]\n\nPlo Koon was one of the best pilots in the Jedi Order and his skills were often praised by fellow Jedi such as Anakin Skywalker when he and Obi-Wan Kenobi crashed on Carnelion IV[64] and Mace Windu when he assembled his team for one of his first missions in the Clone Wars and compared the pilot skills of Rissa Mano with Plo Koon.[65] Koon was also known for his strategic mind and skills in organizing logistics for large groups of people, and preferred to lead by example.[19]\n\nPlo Koon was known for his Force-sensitivity.[9] He was also skilled in lightsaber combat and an expert pilot.[4] While abiding in an escape pod after the Malevolence blew up his fleet, he used the Force to telekinetically flip another pod to face him, hoping to be able to communicate with whoever was inside, only to find the front of the vessel had been ripped out. While fighting in the deep of space, he was still able to smash a battle droid with a Force push and telekinetically move his clone companions to strategically attack the droids before pulling them back to safety. Once he was not under fire, Koon hacked the Droch-class boarding ship off his escape pod and sent it floating away with a thrust of the Force.[9] His power to push was enough to break a dwarf spider droid.[38] He had the power to blast out electric shocks at his enemies.[67] Koon could leap extremely high, such as over the walls of a Separatist base, and use the Force to dash ahead into battle.[38] Working with Ahsoka Tano from atop a Low Altitude Assault Transport, the two used their powers to hold the ruins of the Endurance's bridge steady so that the clones could rescue Skywalker and Windu from the wreckage.[32] Soon after, he would open a lock with the Force, shove and pull Boba Fett, and fling a table at Aurra Sing.[31] Koon was able to telepathically contact Tano when she was flying with Skywalker to help them locate Koon and his men, giving her a sense of where he was while out in the void.[9]\n\nPlo Koon wielded a blue lightsaber in combat.[8] He also wore a mask to protect him from oxygen which was poisonous to Kel Dors.[4]\n\nPlo Koon was played by Alan Ruscoe in The Phantom Menace, and by both Ruscoe and Matt Sloan in Attack of the Clones.  Sloan reprised the role once more in Revenge of the Sith. During production on Phantom Menace, Plo Koon's mask was designed, sculpted and painted by Howard Swindell.[69] The character had no speaking lines in any of the prequel trilogy films, and was essentially a background character. Also, his segment in the Order 66 montage was originally going to be that he would survive the shooting down of his starfighter and eject from his cockpit, but he would later be inevitably shot by the clone pilots.\n\nPlo Koon was voiced by James Arnold Taylor in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series. In an interview with the Aggressive Negotiations podcast, Clone Wars writer Henry Gilroy stated that the Jedi Master was planned to have a Japanese accent early in the show's development, with the intent to portray the character as a samurai-like warrior with the Clone Wars team writing Koon's dialogue with Japanese inflections in mind. They intended to portray the Jedi with a gruff exterior hiding a softer interior, with Gilroy likening him to Toshiro Mifune's character in Seven Samurai, and had considered pursuing actor Sonny Chiba for the role. George Lucas, however, felt that this characterization came across as cold and uncaring, suggesting that the team find a comedic actor in the vein of Jim Carrey instead. It was Dave Filoni who ultimately took Plo Koon into the direction of a Gandalf-like character, which Gilroy later thought of as the perfect route for the Jedi's personality. Koon's nickname for Ahsoka Tano, \"little Soka,\" is a remnant of his samurai characterization.[68]\n\nFor Star Wars: The Mandalorian television series, the appearance of Luke Skywalker in the second season's finale episode was initially kept discreet, with Plo Koon being used as the stand-in character for the script and even for some of the concept art and raw footage.[70] Koon is featured on the cover of the \"First Contact\" Mission Pack for Star Wars: Shatterpoint, which depicts Koon joining Tano in a city environment to battle against several destroyer droids.[71]\n\nDuring construction and planning, Plo Koon was known as \"Plonkoon,\" after the nickname of Nick Dudman's son. It was amended by Lucas before filming to \"Plo Koon.\"[72]\n\nThe old Star Wars database has an image of Plo Koon without his goggles exposing his closed eyes. The canon status of this is, however, in question, as the image appears in the Behind the Scenes section as a pre-production concept model and does not necessarily reflect the reality of the character.[3]",
