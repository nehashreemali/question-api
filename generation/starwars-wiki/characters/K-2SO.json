  "content": "K-2SO was a modified KX-series security droid who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Originally created for the Imperial Army, the droid was deployed in 2 BBY as part of the Galactic Empire's efforts to quell protests on the planet Ghorman. After the Ghorman Massacre and encountering the Axis network operative Cassian Jeron Andor, K-2SO was incapacitated by Samm, a member of the Ghorman Front, and salvaged by Andor. Upon their return to the Great Temple rebel base on Yavin 4, K-2SO was repaired and reprogrammed to serve the Rebel Alliance. The droid became a friend and companion to Andor on various missions for the Alliance. In 1 BBY, K-2SO participated in the rescue of the Axis network rebel Kleya Marki, along with the rebel Ruescott Melshi. Marki would pass along intelligence about a secret Imperial weapon that the Alliance would soon learn was the Death Star battle station, a moon-sized superweapon.\n\nK-2SO was then sent to Wobani to help rescue the Imperial prisoner Jyn Erso, who the rebels believed could help them locate the Imperial scientist associated with the weapon, namely Galen Erso, Jyn's father. After K-2SO assisted in the rescue, he joined Andor and Jyn in visiting the moon Jedha, where they would attempt to use Jyn as a mediator to speak with the extremist rebel Saw Gerrera, as he had taken the Imperial pilot Bodhi Rook prisoner after they had defected at the behest of Galen. Although K-2SO initially was ordered to stay with the ship, he assisted his companions during a fight between Gerrera's Partisans and local Imperial forces.\n\nAfter extracting Rook and also being joined by the Jedha citizens Chirrut Îmwe and Baze Malbus, K-2SO rescued Andor, Jyn, and their new companions as the Death Star destroyed Jedha City with its superlaser. En route to the planet Eadu to locate Galen, K-2SO helped pilot the ship but nonetheless crash-landed outside the Eadu Flight Station. While Andor and Rook approached the Imperial installation, K-2SO discovered that a squadron of Alliance starfighters was approaching. As a battle commenced, K-2SO and the others extracted themselves with a stolen Imperial shuttle.\n\nAfter the incident on Eadu, Alliance High Command refused to act on the intelligence that Jyn had received on Jedha: her father had set a trap in the Death Star, which the rebels needed the Death Star plans to exploit. However, Andor had other ideas. He assembled a team of rebels, which included K-2SO to steal the plans from the Empire's Citadel Tower on the planet Scarif. K-2 would infiltrate the base with Andor and Jyn as their allies engaged the Imperial forces in battle, with the goal of finding the plans. At the Scarif vault, K-2SO sacrificed himself so that Andor and Jyn could steal the plans and transmit them to the Alliance fleet.\n\nK-2SO was a KX-series security droid built in 12 BBY on the planet Vulpter.[1] K-2SO would serve the Galactic Empire. At some point, he took part in an Imperial parade on the planet Coruscant among two hundred total KX-series droids. The droid noticed the Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine's presence at the parade as well.[14] During his Imperial service, K-2SO conducted a series of directives aimed at quelling resistance to the Empire, ranging from telemarketing to killing.[13]\n\nIn 2 BBY, as the Empire began to arrange the conditions for a protest on the planet Ghorman, Imperial Security Bureau Major Lio Partagaz assigned Captain Kaido and a crisis team to Ghorman. K-2SO was one of several KX units sent to Ghorman. The droids were kept inside the Imperial office complex in the main plaza of the planet's capital city, Palmo, as the Imperial forces withdrew to the complex, an action that invited a force of hundreds of Ghormans to peacefully yet determinedly assemble in the plaza to resist the Empire's oppressive reign. When Imperial Bureau of Standards employee Syril Karn entered the building and stumbled upon the droids, who were waiting to be deployed, Karn became concerned.[11]\n\nWhen a team of Imperial security troopers advanced into the crowd, an Imperial sniper fired on one of their own men, causing the squad, thinking the Ghormans had attacked them, into turning their weapons on the protestors. As what would become the Ghorman Massacre broke out, the droids were let loose. K-2SO personally killed several individuals, and as the protestors began to flee, he eventually made his way out of the plaza and onto the surrounding streets. There, he began to pursue Axis network operatives Wilmon Paak and Cassian Jeron Andor. Andor fired several shots at the security droid in an attempt to stop him, but was fruitless in his efforts. Before K-2SO could reach Andor, however, Samm—a member of the insurgent group Ghorman Front—arrived on a repulsorcraft, ramming into K-2SO and incapacitating him.[11]\n\nBefore Andor, Paak, and Samm fled, Andor[11]—who had been taught by his adoptive father, the salvager Clem Andor, to never overlook the possibilities of seemingly useless, abandoned equipment[15]—requested that they help him salvage K-2SO's remains, which were quickly placed within the repulsorcraft before Andor used it to escape the city.[11] After returning to Yavin 4 following both the Ghorman Massacre and the extraction of Chandrilan senator Mon Mothma from the Imperial Senate on the planet Coruscant, Andor turned K-2SO's remains over to Alliance to Restore the Republic technicians so the droid could be rebuilt and reprogrammed. The following morning, the technicians informed Andor that they were about to attempt to reactivate K-2SO. Andor and multiple other rebels aimed their blasters at K-2SO as he was reactivated. After spasming for a moment, K-2SO focused on Andor, apologized for offending him, and requested he stop aiming at him.[12]\n\nK-2SO and Andor were sent to the F'tzner system to undertake a raid on an Imperial freighter. Andor used gas to trick the Empire into thinking that smugglers stole the cargo, as smugglers were known to use gas to raid transports. When they got to the cargo room, they found three Wookiees named D'Koetaa, D'Lylaa, and Wyhyatt, and took them instead of the cargo. Andor then took them to the monastery moon of Charissia in the Bartahn sector. There, he left K-2SO to look after the three Wookiees while Andor undertook a raid.[16]\n\nAt some point K-2SO and Athex were sent to an Imperial base near Fortress Vader on Mustafar. There, they assisted a team of rebels posing as stormtroopers in recovering for the Rebel Alliance. After the rebels stole the Proto-saber, K-2SO picked up the rebels before Darth Vader could stop them from making their escape.[17] At some point while stationed at the rebel base on Yavin 4, K-2SO had a run-in with R2-D2 and C-3PO, droids belonging to the pilot of Senator Bail Organa.[18]\n\nIn 1 BBY,[19] K-2SO was playing a game with Andor and Ruescott Melshi in Andor's abode. Melshi had just outsmarted K-2SO in the game, making the droid nervous—though K-2SO attempted to deny it. Immediately afterward, Paak arrived and revealed to the group that he had just received a coded transmission from Axis network liason Kleya Marki. After confirming the legitimacy of the signal and concluding that the leader of the Axis network, Luthen Rael, was in danger, Andor, Melshi, and K-2SO departed to rescue Rael and Marki—though K-2SO expressed reservations regarding the unauthorized nature of their mission. Upon arriving to the apartment complex housing the Axis network safehouse on Coruscant, Andor ordered K-2SO to remain in their U-wing.[14]\n\nHowever, as Andor and Melshi worked to extract Marki—who confirmed that Rael had already died—a group of Imperial Security Bureau tactical agents arrived, catching K-2SO's attention. In order to aid his allies, the security droid exited the U-wing and began to make his own way to the safehouse, dispatching multiple tactical agents[14] and the pilot of their shuttle on his way there. Entering the apartment complex, K-2SO traveled through its halls and continued to take out multiple ISB agents, including their leader, Supervisor Avril Heert, whom he utilized as a human shield. Upon reaching the safehouse, K-2SO and the group—a now-stunned Marki in tow—retreated to the U-wing and departed from Coruscant.[20]\n\nUpon their return to Yavin 4, Andor's commanding officer, General Davits Draven, ordered K-2SO to power himself down as punishment for the group's excursion. The next day, however, K-2SO was put back into service when Andor received orders to investigate a claim made by Partisan spy Tivik regarding a superweapon being constructed by Imperial architect Galen Erso—the Death Star. As such, the duo departed to the Ring of Kafrene to correspond with Tivik.[20] After Tivik relayed the intel to Andor[5]—which had earlier been corroborated by Marki[20]—he was killed, and the duo left the Ring of Kafrene.[5]\n\nAfterwards, Andor[21] and K-2SO accompanied Extraction Team Bravo, which helped Galen's daughter, Jyn Erso, escape from the Wobani Labor Camp. As Erso ran outside to escape, K-2SO seized Erso, threw her to the ground, and told her not to resist as she was being rescued.[5] Bravo Team's U-wing transport, Bravo One, encountered a minor technical setback and was unable to jump to hyperspace. The team took refuge in an asteroid field in Wobani's star system, and K-2SO sent a priority transmission to all available Rebel vessels. An X-wing starfighter squadron called Red Flight answered their call and saved them from incoming Imperial forces.[9]\n\nLater, K-2SO accompanied Andor and Jyn on a mission to rescue Galen so that they could gather information about the Death Star. In secret, Cassian had received orders to kill Galen in order to prevent the weapon from being built. The Alliance had learned about the Death Star from the Imperial defector Bodhi Rook, who had been taken by men working for Saw Gerrera. K-2SO was uncomfortable that Jyn had been given a blaster since she disliked him.[5]\n\nK-2SO and his companions traveled to the moon Jedha in order to find Saw Gerrera and acquire Bodhi's message so that they could locate Galen. Under orders from Cassian, Kaytoo stayed aboard their U-wing while his human companions infiltrated the Holy City of Jedha. Despite his instructions, K-2SO ventured into the Holy City during a battle between Imperial forces and Saw's Partisans. K-2SO narrowly avoided being shot by Jyn, who instead shot another KX-series security droid. Kaytoo also intercepted a stormtrooper's grenade in midair and threw it at a group of advancing stormtroopers. K-2SO slipped away following the fighting and returned to their U-wing transport. Meanwhile, his companions were captured by Saw's Partisans, who brought them to the rebel leader's base in the Catacombs of Cadera.[5]\n\nAfter the Death Star destroyed Jedha City during a test firing, K-2SO picked up Cassian, Jyn, Bodhi, and their new companions Chirrut Îmwe and Baze Malbus in his U-wing before Saw's base was caught up in the Death Star's blast. Due to the mission, the rebels learned that Galen had incorporated a design flaw into the Death Star. Having learned from Saw that Galen was on the storm-stricken planet of Eadu, Kaytoo helped Cassian fly the U-wing there. Despite a powerful storm, the rebels managed to crash their ship near the Imperial Flight Station where Galen and the other scientists were being housed.[5]\n\nK-2SO and the others stayed aboard the wrecked U-wing while Cassian ventured outside to find Galen. During that time, Kaytoo disclosed to Jyn that Cassian was going to assassinate her father. Jyn left to find her father before Cassian could kill him, only to be caught up in a rebel attack on the station. During that attack, Galen was killed by a stray X-wing proton torpedo. Amidst the fighting, K-2SO, Rook, and the others managed to steal an Imperial cargo shuttle and rescue Jyn and Cassian. The rebels then returned to Yavin 4.[5]\n\nAfter the Rebel Alliance was unable to reach a consensus on the Death Star, K-2SO accompanied Jyn, Cassian, and their companions on an unsanctioned mission to steal the Death Star plans from the planet Scarif. This rebel strike team became known as Rogue One. Kaytoo and Rook piloted the stolen cargo shuttle they had obtained on Eadu. When the air traffic controller claimed that there was no such group with the designation Rogue One, K-2SO replied \"there is now\" before taking off. After exiting hyperspace, Kaytoo and the rest of his team managed to travel through the Shield Gate and land at the planetary Imperial security complex.[5]\n\nWhile the rest of the Rogue One unit staged a diversionary attack on the base, Kaytoo accompanied a disguised Jyn and Cassian inside the security complex. During the course of the mission, K-2SO accosted another KX unit and accessed its databanks to retrieve a map of the complex. The three rebels then made their way to the data vault, where the Death Star plans were stored. After incapacitating the technician, Kaytoo assumed control of the computer and opened the door into the vault. At that point, K-2SO received news that the rebel fleet had arrived over Scarif and that the Empire had locked the Shield Gate.[5]\n\nSince they were trapped, Kaytoo suggested transmitting the plans, but told them that the size of the data files meant that the shield would have to be taken down in order to transmit them to the orbiting rebel fleet. Since the two had gained each other's respect during their adventures, Jyn gave K-2SO an SE-14C blaster pistol to defend himself. Kaytoo expressed surprise at her change in behavior. While Jyn and Cassian were combing through the files for the plans, several stormtroopers approached K-2SO, who immediately closed the vault door to stop them looking inside. Kaytoo tried to divert the Imperials away, but his cover was blown when Cassian spoke through the intercom asking why he had shut the door.[5]\n\nK-2SO engaged the stormtroopers in a blaster battle while relaying the location of a data-tape titled \"stardust,\" which was the codename for the Death Star plans. Before Cassian could retrieve the file, the door control was hit and the device's power was knocked out. K-2SO implored his comrades to climb through the vault before succumbing to stormtrooper fire. K-2SO gave his final farewell to the pair, and at the cost of his life, he destroyed the door control panel so the stormtroopers could not open it again.[5] In his last second before shutting down permanently, K-2SO created a simulation in which Cassian escaped alive. He knew it was impossible, but it gave him joy.[22]\n\nDespite K-2SO's disintegration, Jyn and Cassian managed to retrieve the Death Star plans and transmit them to the orbiting rebel fleet. The rest of Rogue One were killed when Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin used the Death Star's superlaser to destroy the Imperial security complex in a desperate effort to prevent the plans from escaping Scarif. This set the stage for the Battle of Yavin.[5]\n\nK-2SO was remembered long after the Galactic Civil War and was mentioned alongside Erso and Orson Callan Krennic by a member of the Whills as someone to be remembered in galactic history.[23]\n\nWhile most KX-series droids were effectively emotionless drones, minor errors and glitches in K-2SO's reprogramming led to the development of a fully self-aware personality; he was cynical, prone to sarcasm, and stoic, often mentioning that he had calculated the poor odds of success in any given situation, which Andor would then refuse to hear. His sarcasm extended to the point where he would disobey minor orders and prove his ability in given missions, as seen on Jedha.[5] The droid was also modified.[21]\n\nAs a KX unit, K-2SO was also equipped with two olfactory sensors on his chest, which provided K-2SO with an astute \"sense\" of smell.[10] His chest plate was able to resist certain types of blaster fire, but not of the magnitude of the forces stationed on Scarif.[24]\n\nHe was fairly independent and frequently disobeyed orders he felt were counterproductive, scolding his organic compatriots for ignoring his advice. He genuinely regarded Andor as a friend, however, and felt no hesitation in sacrificing himself in order to protect him and Jyn Erso during their mission to steal the plans to the Death Star.[5]\n\nK-2SO is voiced and portrayed in motion capture by Alan Tudyk in the Star Wars anthology film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,[5] becoming one of the film's breakout characters.[26] During Disney's 2025 FYC Fest, Tudyk recollected how an early draft of Rogue One included a scene in which a general ordered K-2SO to carry bags, to which the droid replied, \"No.\" This scene informed Tudyk of the character's childish personality.[27] His name was revealed in a preview of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story: The Official Visual Story Guide, though the source listed him as both \"K-2SO\" and, incorrectly, \"K-250.\" The magazine in question was later cancelled before its release.\n\nBy 2018, Lucasfilm had begun developing a television series set before Rogue One that starred Cassian Andor and K-2SO. They would be similar to the film characters Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and they would storm the Citadel. After viewing the script sent by Lucasfilm,[28] Rogue One writer[5] Tony Gilroy thought the material was fine but hard to sustain over a long run. He then wrote a forensic manifesto explaining why the idea would not work and what Lucasfilm should do instead. Gilroy's idea was the Andor television series.[28] Gilroy's story did not include K-2SO until later in the storyline.[29] In 2022, he hinted that Season Two may show how Andor and K-2SO met,[30] which was subsequently depicted in \"Who Are You?\", the eighth episode of the second season.[11] K2's return was first teased in a trailer for the season shown at D23 in August, 2024.[31]\n\nThe comic Rogue One - Cassian & K-2SO Special 1 provides an alternative explanation of how K-2SO and Cassian Andor met[32] from Andor Season Two.[11] As Lucasfilm has yet to rationalize the discrepancy, the main body of this article currently documents the episode, while the comic is documented below.\n\nIn the events of Rogue One - Cassian & K-2SO Special 1, K-2SO was one of the KX-series security droids assigned to the Imperial stormtrooper detachment on the planet Wecacoe. K-2SO heard a noise near a decommissioned Imperial cruiser. There he encountered Rebel agent Cassian Andor and arrested him. K-2SO and Andor then fought each other until Kertas and Rismor found his kill switch. Cassian then attempted to wipe K-2SO's memory clean.[32]\n\nHowever, only 29.73% of K-2SO's memory had been erased, and he then strangled Cassian. Kertas and Rismor were able to turn him off again. Cassian gave K-2 new orders to lead him, Kertas, and Rismor back to their ship. K-2 stated he would \"take out\" anyone who interfered with them. He escorted Cassian and the twins as his prisoners, but came under attack by several stormtroopers. He, the twins, and Cassian attacked the troopers.[32]\n\nAs the K-2SO's group got to their vehicle, stormtroopers surrounded it, and K-2 attempted to arrest Andor again. As Rismor drew the troops away, Kertas told Cassian to take K-2SO because he had the intel they needed. After Cassian's ship was destroyed, K-2 still had 8.3% of his memory and tried to decide to either terminate or arrest Cassian. Cassian removed the base layer of his programming and shut him down. K-2 turned on and took out the stormtroopers. K-2 and Andor then found a ship. Together, they made their escape.[32]\n\nGilroy later admitted that he was aware of the story told in the Cassian & K-2SO Special but decidedly ignored it when creating his own version of the events for Andor Season 2. Furthermore, Gilroy stated that there existed another, elaborate version of the K-2SO origin that took an entire episode. Dan Gilroy, a writer for the show and the brother of Tony, had contributed to a \"horror movie episode\" that was later scrapped for budget reasons. Gilroy purposefully waited until near the end of the series to introduce K-2, something that he noted Tudyk, who returned for the show to voice the character, became impatient about.[33]",
