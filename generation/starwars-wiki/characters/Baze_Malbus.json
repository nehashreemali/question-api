  "content": "Baze Malbus was a human male born on the desert moon of Jedha fifty-three years before the Battle of Yavin. Once a devoted member of the Guardians of the Whills, Malbus became a freelance assassin during the age of the Galactic Empire. Nevertheless, he maintained a deep friendship with Chirrut Îmwe, who also served with the Guardians. Following the destruction of Jedha City, Malbus and Îmwe became part of the Rebel Alliance group known as Rogue One. After Îmwe's death in an explosion during the Battle of Scarif, Malbus rushed the Imperial death troopers with his MWC-35c \"Staccato Lightning\" repeating cannon and was killed by a C-25 fragmentation grenade.\n\nBaze Malbus was a human male[5] born in 53 BBY[3] on the desert moon of Jedha. As a child, Malbus would take great joy from watching the rare but powerful torrents of rain that would hit Jedha.[8]\n\nHe later joined the Guardians of the Whills alongside Chirrut Îmwe,[5] his close friend since childhood.[9] As members of the religious order, they were tasked with guarding the Temple of the Kyber in Jedha City.[5]\n\nIn the aftermath of the Proclamation of the New Order, the holy city of NiJedha was occupied by the armed forces of the Galactic Empire.[5] The harsh conditions of Imperial occupation transformed Malbus into a cynical soldier. At some point, he moved away from the vestments of the Guardians, exchanging them for combat armor and a flight suit delivered by an offworld visitor to Jedha.[1] Although Malbus lost his faith in their religion,[7] he remained lifelong friends with the spiritual Îmwe despite their differences.[6]\n\nIn 1 BBY, Malbus was present in the streets of NiJedha while Îmwe spoke with Silvanie Phest, an Anomid who once sang prayers in the Temple of the Kyber. When Phest told Îmwe that she believed a Jedi was at the Temple, Malbus immediately shot down the idea. He had lost his faith in the Force many years prior and was under no illusion that Phest’s story would be correct. Though he rejected the idea of helping, he nonetheless followed Îmwe as he headed to the Old Shadows and the Temple to investigate.[7]\n\nAs he walked the busy streets, Malbus thought of how the Empire had brought nothing but disorder to Jedha, and he carried true anger at what they had done to the planet and its inhabitants. Reaching the Old Shadow, Malbus immediately told his friend that the man waiting for them was no Jedi, but instead a man with an unconcealed zealousness. When the man, who identified himself as Wernad, approached Îmwe for assistance, Malbus stepped in to prevent him, but Îmwe softly intervened and spoke with Wernad.[7]\n\nAs they left to return to their shared room off of the Old Market, Malbus heard that at least half a dozen people had been killed by stormtroopers following a small insurgent uprising near Gesh's Tapcafe. In their room, he had to make do with tarine tea for dinner, a drink Malbus was not fond of, though he liked the fact it removed the taste of dust from his mouth. Îmwe suggested he should sleep as they had a small heist mission planned for later that evening, but Malbus refused. Instead, he told Îmwe that he believed Wernad was right to feel rage at the Empire for destroying their home and the homes of so many others, and understood the reasons why the man was angry - a remark that Îmwe quietly agreed with.[7]\n\nWhen that evening came, the pair were stationed atop a building near LZ-Cresh, a small landing zone erected by the Empire, and watched as a Zeta-class Heavy Cargo Shuttle landed. Malbus was unsure if this was the vehicle they had expected, though Îmwe confidently told him it was the correct one. Malbus knew if his friend was wrong, they would be up against an entire platoon of stormtroopers. He watched as a combat assault tank pulled up with its contents full of mined kyber. While Îmwe was becoming impatient at their delay, Malbus said his friend should practice what he preaches in terms of having patience. When Malbus confirmed that the ship was the one they had come for, the pair made their way into their positions. They had not come for the kyber, instead, they were there to ambush a stormtrooper-driven landspeeder to steal its cargo of weapons, medicine, food, and tea.[7]\n\nWhen the time was right, Imwe left to take his position and Malbus began purposefully vaulting from rooftop to rooftop before eventually jumping to the streets below. After a heavy landing, he felt a stabbing pain that traveled through his legs to his knees, causing him to reflect on past times when his body could have handled such a jump. He thought of the times when he had called himself a Guardian of the Whills and when his faith in the Force had been as unshakable and constant as Îmwe’s. He steadied himself and prepared his E-5 blaster rifle for use. He had modified the weapon to be more powerful at the expense of its ammo capacity and the stun setting, and he knew the latter would have bothered him more as a younger man. Though the Imperial violence made him angry, he knew that many believed in the beauty NiJedha once harbored and that mattered to him despite his lack of belief - he saw the pain the Empire had caused in his friends, strangers, hungry children in the streets and beneath Îmwe’s smile. He knew that there was still enough of the Guardian’s influence in him to make him not want to kill in anger if he could help it. But, whilst his balance had been lost long ago, and whether or not the Force was still truly with him, Malbus knew that he was no longer with the Force.[7]\n\nHe moved into position as Îmwe stood in the front of the landspeeder and diverted the stormtrooper's attention away from his friend. As the four troopers readied the speeder to run Îmwe down, Malbus shot three of them from his position behind them as Îmwe finished the fourth Imperial off with his staff. The pair jumped into the speeder and headed to Denic's garage, where they would provide their confidant with the weapons and ammo. At Denic's, Malbus was forced to discard his E-5 after its capacitor system had melted down. He knew the Empire would punish the Holy City for the theft the next day but hoped their heist was worth it.[7]\n\nLater at the Gimm sisters' orphanage, the pair shared the food and medicine they had stolen with Killi Gimm and her sister Kaya. To show her gratitude, Killi served tarine tea for them to enjoy, and, this time, Malbus did not air his dislike for the beverage. After hearing Killi cough violently, Malbus was quick to show concern, telling her to sit whilst he finished preparing the tea. Despite her mild protestations that the dust was the cause of her cough, he told her to slowly drink the tea to soothe her chest. Îmwe suggested that she take some of the medicinal Respitic, and Malbus insisted that there was enough for both her and the children to have. When she refused and told the pair the children's needs came first, Malbus claimed she sounded like Îmwe and told them both that the Empire had enough supplies to aid the orphanage. He brushed off Kaya’s words when she asked if they had had any trouble with the Imperials, but she thanked them nonetheless.[7]\n\nMalbus promised to return with further supplies before their current levels depleted, but Kaya worried about how the Empire would respond to the thefts. Malbus told her that the Empire created the problem of thieves on the planet, so they would need to solve it as well. Kaya told the pair she did not want them to stop, but worried what the endgame would be. Malbus promised they would continue for as long as they could, and asked what she would have them do instead. It was Killi who replied saying that, for as long as the Empire occupied Jedha, they were trapped in a cycle of suffering. Îmwe posited that they should break the cycle with Kill agreeing, stating they should break it before it broke them.[7]\n\nMalbus and Îmwe argued over the former's weaponry with Malbus claiming he needed a new weapon as he could not fight with an archaic lightbow - the weapon of a Guardian. After their argument ended amicably, Malbus realized a Twi'lek and a Sabat were following the pair. They began walking through the Old Market and Malbus could tell their pursuers were competent, though the appearance of a Sabat puzzled him as he had not encountered one in years. When the pair entered Hopper Town, Îmwe sensed a squadron of stormtroopers in the vicinity and they were swiftly spotted. Malbus was unsure whether the Imperial presence was a result of their heist the previous night, a show of force or simply bad luck. He instructed Îmwe to escape through the narrow alleyways to ensure he was not captured by the stormtroopers for questioning and ran in the opposite direction to draw the Imperials away.[7]\n\nMalbus made his way to Denic's garage, passing multiple stormtrooper patrols and AT-DPs en route. Reaching the garage, Denic was not pleased with his arrival and blamed him and Îmwe for the Imperial presence. She revealed to him that their recent heist had resulted in the theft of heavy munitions. Malbus inspected the haul and was excited to find a MWC-35c \"Staccato Lightning\" repeating cannon hidden amongst the loot. He asked Denic to rig the coolant tank to allow him to carry it on his back, but Denic told him that the weapon was for support and not personal use. She quickly relented upon realizing Malbus would not be deterred and told the ex-Guardian that the powerful weapon was originally set to be used for devastating crowd control.[7]\n\nThat night, Malbus' new arsenal was completed - the rig was a combination of a harness and body armor, the coolant tank, and the rifle. Malbus knew the weapon was impossible to conceal, but believed its benefits far outweighed any potential issues. When he returned home, he found Îmwe drinking tea with the Twi'lek and Sabat that had followed them earlier in the day, The Twi'lek introduced himself as Beezer Fortuna and his Sabat ally as Leevan Tenza, and stated they had an invitation for the pair. Malbus was aware that factions were fighting the Empire across the galaxy as he had heard rumours of uprisings at Cherridan and Winter's Edge, as well as a garbled defiant transmission from Lothal. Malbus sneered that the pair were rebels, but they posited themselves as emissaries of someone eager to meet the pair.[7]\n\nThe pair were transported outside of the Holy City and taken far into the deserts of Jedha. During the journey, Malbus told Îmwe he was eager to test his new weapon. When they arrived near their destination, Malbus argued that Fortuna and Tenza did not trust them enough to take them straight to their base of operations. When Tenza attempted to hurry the pair, Malbus said whoever was waiting would have to continue to do so until they were ready. Malbus followed Îmwe as they headed towards the Three Faces and described the weathered old monuments to his friend.[7]\n\nWhen they reached a canyon, a man was waiting for them in the shadows. Malbus raised his weapon at the stranger and demanded he show himself. Îmwe stepped between the man and Malbus' rifle after Malbus stated he would wait and see before deciding whether to fire on the stranger. Malbus again demanded the man reveal himself and he eventually did so, introducing himself as Saw Gerrera and stating that he fought for the galaxy. Malbus told him Jedha already had an insurgency, but Gerrera told him they were battle-hardened partisans whose goal was to tear down the Empire and invited the pair to join them, telling them he had seen freedom stolen on countless worlds, and faiths and innocent lives destroyed with them. Malbus shifted as he absorbed the passion in Gerrera's words, and felt himself listening more intently. When the pair left, Gerrera asked them to consider his invitation.[7]\n\nWhen they arrived home, Malbus asked Îmwe if knew what he was thinking. Îmwe replied that he knew Malbus believed the time had come to fight. Malbus told him the time to fight had been upon them for a while, and that while Îmwe tried to uphold his faith and traditions, Malbus tried to keep Îmwe from becoming so lost in the spiritual that he forgot the physical. He told his friend that the Empire would kill everyone on the planet before they left, and informed Îmwe what the Empire planned to do with the Morellian 35c repeaters. He told Îmwe that the fight was there with them and they must enter it, and stated they stood a better chance alongside Gerrera. Malbus told Îmwe that while he did not trust Gerrera, he believed him, an assessment Îmwe agreed with.[7]\n\nThe pair went back to the Gimm's orphanage to find it had been raided by stormtroopers. Malbus told his friend that the scene did not look good, and scoped out the surrounding buildings and the narrow street they occupied for any signs of Imperials. When Îmwe declared they must look inside, Malbus used his brute strength to pry the damaged door apart for them to enter. As he checked the building for any occupants, Malbus felt a strong desire to test his new weapon on any stormtroopers he encountered.[7]\n\nLeaving the orphanage, they were met by five stormtroopers whom Malbus noted did not raise their blasters. He did his best to conceal his new weapon in case the troopers recognized it as stolen Imperial property, though he had no intention of giving it back, and he told them they did not want to be taken in for questioning as to why they were in the now-closed orphanage. He carefully watched Îmwe's grip on his staff for a sign of his intentions as his friend feigned ignorance to the band of Imperials, and confirmed the streets were empty before his friend attacked the stormtrooper sergeant. Malbus blasted the remaining stormtroopers with his new cannon and immediately took a liking to it upon seeing the damage it dealt.[7]\n\nThat evening, the pair found the evicted Gimm sisters and orphans in the northwest part of the Holy City, in an abandoned house Malbus had found years earlier and noted as a potential home for the orphans. Upon seeing the tearful and fatigued Kaya, Malbus wrapped his arms around her and hugged her, apologizing that they had not been there to help at the orphanage. He noticed the fear in Killi and the orphans and felt a surge of anger upon being told a stormtrooper had struck one of the orphans, B'asia. He stared at Îmwe as the sisters explained that the Imperials took everything from the orphanage, including food, water, and blankets. Îmwe asked the sisters to step outside while Malbus spoke with him freely. Malbus could feel the Holy City settling into another frightened night and felt the weight of the Dauntless in orbit above Jedha - for a moment he felt pure dread before returning to a state of anger. After a short silence, Îmwe gave him the communication device Beezer Fortuna had previously provided him, telling Malbus to contact him and request food, water, medicine, heating units and beds for the orphans in exchange for their help fighting alongside Gerrera. Malbus did as he was instructed and made the call he had wanted to make.[7]\n\nOver the following two months, Malbus taught the partisans the back alley paths of the Holy City. In doing so, he spent less time with Îmwe due to Gerrera's crusade against the Empire with the partisans leader seemingly favoring Malbus' abilities over his blind comrades, and he helped to execute the destruction of an All Terrain Scout Transport in the Square of Stars.[7]\n\nAlong with Îmwe, he later met a Meftian named Kullbee Sperado, another of Gerrera's trusted partisans, who had accompanied Beezer to a meeting between them where they discussed how to assault the kyber mines to prevent the Empire from further excavating them. Malbus agreed with Beezer's idea to attack one of the speeder runs from the mines into city, stating there were at least a dozen places along the route where they could easily strike.[7]\n\nFor the mission, Malbus and Îmwe took positions along one side of a cliff outside of the city, as Speradi and two further partisans, a Talpini and a human male, took positions on the opposite side. When Îmwe asked Malbus how his new cannon was working, Malbus replied he was testing with overcharging single shots, though his idea ran the risk of his cannon exploding in his hands, an idea which slightly worried Îmwe. As Malbus fired on the oncoming speeder, the group were able to destroy the Imperials and retrieve the cargo from the disabled speeder.[7]\n\nTwo months later, the pair were still engaging in guerilla combat against the Empire. Malbus was growing increasingly comfortable with the actions of the partisans, despite Îmwe's concerns. Malbus told his friend that the Imperials were free to leave Jedha if they did not want to lose their lives. Îmwe retorted that the Empire was not receiving their clear messages of intent, and Malbus invited him to share other ideas to get their enemy to leave. Îmwe did not have a solid answer, and after hearing his friend talk of the Empire’s growing oppression of their world, Malbus decided he would seek out and engage with Gerrera directly.[7]\n\nMalbus met Gerrera in the shadow of the Three Faces, as was customary. As Gerrera approached, Malbus was glaring at the Star Destroyer in orbit above the city. Gerrera congratulated Malbus on his work that day, though Malbus replied that all of Jedha will feel the repercussions. As he listened to Gerrera talk about the Empire's fear of losing control, Malbus wondered how much of a reflection of his future self he was possibly seeing. Gerrera offered Malbus a drink and the pair agreed on their shared dislike for tarine tea. Instead, they shared a flask of Bahkahta, a drink from Onderon that Gerrera had brewed. The drink stung Malbus' tongue and throat but he did not find it unpleasant.[7]\n\nGerrera explained that the ways of life, cultures, and beliefs of Onderon were gone, though Malbus reminded him the planet remained. The partisan leader stated if you did not join the faceless ranks of the Empire, then you would be eliminated. Malbus told him that the deserts of Jedha were hardly worth fighting over, but Gerrera reminded him they were extracting the planet's kyber. Malbus told Gerrera that many on the planet thought the Empire's occupation would not last as they thought they had come because of the planet's temples. The citizens believed the Empire had come to crush belief, as belief led to hope, and hope could topple monsters. Malbus explained that hope can be a small thing that does not need much to survive - only an occasional breath of air or a flicker of warmth, and that hope could live in a vacuum. After Gerrera told him he sounded like Îmwe, Malbus grinned and replied only when his friend was not around.[7]\n\nGerrera asked Malbus whether he still carried hope, and though Malbus did not know entirely what he had, he would fight for his home and loved ones, and fight against injustice. Gerrera told him that the Empire had taken so much from him that his hope was not all it once had been, but he admired Îmwe’s continued faith. Eventually, Gerrera asked Malbus the reason why he had requested their meeting, to which Malbus informed him he was there to talk about the rising numbers in the orphanage. Though Gerrera agreed to arrange for greater supplies, Malbus told him his plan for solving the problem entirely. When he had finished, Gerrera let out a sharp laugh and agreed to Malbus' plan.[7]\n\nIn the days following, the Empire unleashed waves of TIE fighters and stormtroopers across Jedha, tightening security and enforcing curfews. Malbus had again been separated from Îmwe due to the ongoing skirmishes but reunited with him back at the orphanage. The pair shared chav tea and Malbus enquired who the young Rodian child, Althin, was that Îmwe had returned with. When Îmwe informed him the boy's parents had been killed in a partisan attack, Malbus mused that nowhere was safe. Malbus offered a new solution to Îmwe, the children should leave Jedha. Îmwe believed it to be an interesting idea but believed there was no way they could acquire a ship and have the children leave the planet safely. Îmwe also questioned where they would go, but Malbus told him there were worlds the Empire had not reached, and that the children would not be escaping the Empire, they would be escaping their predicament on Jedha. He then informed his friend that Gerrera had agreed to help get them a ship.[7]\n\nThe pair approached Killi and Kaya with the plan, intending that the sisters also evacuate off-world, though Killi informed Kaya that she would be staying behind on the planet as she was dying. The same night, in Denic's garage, the pair requested Denic be the one to fly the ship and transport the orphans. After she requested they approach Woan Barso instead, she eventually relented and agreed to pilot the craft. Gerrera suggested the children walk to the spaceport, rather than the craft collect them from the orphanage. Malbus was sceptical of this plan, but everyone involved agreed it was the best idea.[7]\n\nA week later, Malbus went to a cantina at the Jedha City spaceport. There, he watched ships approach and be scrutinized by squads of stormtroopers accompanied by heavy-duty KX-series security droids. After a Sentinel-class landing craft docked in bay eighteen, Leevan Tenza and Wernad - who the Partisans had recruited - joined him at his table and confirmed the ship was the one Gerrera had commandeered. Beezer Fortuna had obtained information that the ship did regular drop-offs to the spaceport but did not originate from the Star Destroyer above Jedha. Malbus then placed credits on the table for the rehydrated noodles he had consumed, gathered his weapon and promptly stepped out of the cantina and opened fire on the Imperials and security droids assessing the ship. With the aid of Tenza and Wernad, he cleared a path to the ship and awaited Îmwe's arrival with the children. Before Îmwe could arrive, Tenza murdered the Imperial pilot against Malbus' wishes. Malbus moved the body out of sight of the oncoming children and saw Fortuna and Sperado approaching the ship. Malbus asked why they were not watching the orphans approach in case they required support, and Fortuna told him Gerrera's true plan - to steal the craft and attempt to destroy the orbiting Star Destroyer. Malbus attempted to draw his cannon on the pair, but Sperado aimed his blaster at him, causing him to freeze. He told Sperado to lower his weapon before the children arrived, before heading towards Îmwe to inform him of Gerrera’s treachery.[7]\n\nThe pair confronted the partisans at the craft, who warned them not to let the children aboard. As crowds grew in the spaceport to see what was happening, Malbus told Sperado that more stormtroopers would soon be there. Fortuna stood at the top of the ramp and argued that the citizens of Jedha needed a symbol of hope, one that Gerrera could offer them. Malbus shot back that the children were the symbol of hope. He argued the shuttle would not be enough to destroy a Star Destroyer and Îmwe told the partisans that they knew their plan would not free Jedha or stop the Empire. Malbus told Fortuna to think of everyone watching them and carefully think about what Gerrera would want him to do next. When Fortuna told him Gerrera would never forgive them for their actions, Malbus told him their relationship with Gerrera was over. As Fortuna stepped aside, the orphans boarded the shuttle and Malbus confirmed to Denic that the bombs were no longer on the ship following Tenza, Sperado, and Wernad’s departure.[7]\n\nAs the ship prepared to take off, Malbus told Îmwe he would miss him, believing his friend would be leaving with the orphans. When Îmwe stated he was staying and that Malbus should accompany the children, Malbus told him the children would need his guidance. Ignoring Îmwe's words, he told his friend that he would walk into walls if left unattended without guidance. Killi eventually broke up the dispute, stating that neither could leave the other and that they would both stay on the planet. Malbus joked that he thought this was how he would finally be rid of his friend before the pair watched as the shuttle lifted off and accelerated to safety. As they made their way home, Îmwe asked if Malbus would care for tea, causing him to enquire if it would be tarine. When Îmwe confirmed it would be, Malbus grunted in acceptance as they made their way through the city.[7]\n\nMonths later,[10] Malbus was with Îmwe in the streets of Jedha City when he caught the attention of Jyn Erso and Captain Cassian Andor of the Rebel Alliance after he had sensed her kyber crystal necklace.[5] Thinking him to be a con artist, Erso asked Malbus how he knew she was wearing a necklace, but he shook his head and snorted in reply.[8]\n\nMalbus aided in rescuing Erso and Andor after they had been arrested following a deadly skirmish in Tythoni Square. After Îmwe had dispatched a squad of stormtroopers, Malbus took out the second wave of troopers with precision blasts of his cannon. He did not apologise for nearly shooting a dismayed Îmwe before blasting the final stormtrooper in the head. After Andor enquired whether they were Jedi, Malbus told him there were no Jedi on the planet anymore, just dreamers like Îmwe. He shot back at Îmwe that he had protected him rather than the Force, as his friend had declared. Before they could continue their argument, the group were taken hostage by Gerrera’s partisans. Malbus, along with the others, was blindfolded and taken to Gerrera.[5]\n\nMalbus was imprisoned in the Catacombs of Cadera along with Îmwe and Andor while Erso was taken to Gerrera for questioning. He mocked Îmwe's prayers, and his friend told Andor that Malbus was once the most devoted Guardian of them all.[5] After an hour,[8] the group identified that the man in the next cell was Bodhi Rook, who had been captured by the Partisans after he brought a message to Gerrera from Galen Walton Erso, Jyn's father that provided information regarding a fatal flaw within the Death Star. Seeing an Imperial pilot enraged Malbus, who threatened to kill the man if he could reach him.[5]\n\nUnbeknownst to Malbus, the Death Star had arrived over Jedha and fired a single reactor blast on the Holy City, which would eventually destroy the city[5] and a chunk of the planet.[11] Malbus originally believed the shockwaves to be proton bombs.[8] Andor was able to open the cell door, and instructed the pair to retrieve the pilot[5] and meet him on the surface.[8] Malbus collected his blaster at aimed it at Rook in his cell, before blasting the door controls and freeing the defector.[5] As they sprinted towards the entrance, Rook told Malbus the partisans would kill them before they could leave, but Malbus simply laughed at the irony of someone else wanting Rook dead more than him.[8]\n\nAs they reached the surface, Malbus watched in shock and horror as he laid eyes on the destruction inflicted by the battle station above. When Andor's U-wing, piloted by his reprogrammed Imperial KX-droid K-2SO, flew into view, he instructed Îmwe to run and together they sprinted toward the ship. As they entered the ship. Malbus watched nervously out of the window and observed his devastated home for the final time. As the ship travelled through hyperspace, Malbus barked to Îmwe that the entire city was gone, and snapped at Rook that his attempts to do something about the superweapon came too late. Jyn, however, claimed they could beat the people responsible as she had seen her father's message detailing how to destroy the Death Star. Malbus asked her what trap Galen had laid with the structure, offering her support when Andor would not.[5]\n\nThe new crew headed to Eadu on a mission to extract Galen Erso and deliver him to Alliance High Command, though Andor had been told privately to assassinate Jyn's father. As the ship fought against the stormy weather, Malbus silently attempted to keep his balance before the ship crash-landed on the planet's surface near the Eadu Flight Station.[5]\n\nAs Andor gave orders to Rook and Jyn, Malbus smiled sardonically as the rebel agent declared his hope that an Imperial shuttle could be stolen to allow them to escape.[8] Once Andor and Rook had left the ship, Malbus confirmed to Îmwe that Andor had the face of a friend, not a killer, though Îmwe was cautious about the spy's actions. As Jyn raced to find her father, Malbus remained with Îmwe and K-2SO on the crashed U-wing.[5] Malbus found himself watching Eadu’s rain and comparing it to the rare but powerful torrents on Jedha that had given him joy as a child. He noted that the Eadu rain smelt far worse than that on his homeworld, but reckoned he would eventually forget the smell of Jedha’s rain.[8]\n\nWhen Îmwe left the ship to find Jyn, Malbus wished him luck but eventually joined him after Îmwe stated he did not need luck when he had his friend.[5] Malbus allowed Îmwe to lead him up the steep ridges of the planet's canyons before he noticed a gathering on the Imperial facilities landing pad in the distance. Through the scope of his cannon, he saw stormtroopers and officers assembled and a shuttle descending. He prepared to open fire on each of them as the grief and trauma of Jedha directed his actions, before Îmwe calmed him slightly by reminding him that was not the purpose of their mission. Malbus hit back stating that if they had not come for vengeance against those who destroyed their home, then they had become lackeys of the Rebellion. After Îmwe denied this, Malbus pressed on asking his friend why were they specifically following Jyn on this mission. Îmwe told him it was because she shone, and following his friends words, a peace came over the pair briefly until an Alliance starfighter squadron roared through the skies above them.[8]\n\nFollowing the Alliance attack on the Eadu Energy Conversion Laboratory, the pair were still stationed on the ridge above the landing pad. Malbus saved the lives of Andor and Jyn by taking out a squadron of stormtroopers who approached them on the devastated landing pad before making his way to the stolen Zeta-class Heavy Cargo Shuttle Rook had commandeered for their escape.[5]\n\nAboard the shuttle and aware of Galen’s death on the landing pad, Malbus wore a bleak expression as he kept his gaze on Jyn. His expression turned to disgust as Jyn accused of Andor of intending to assassinate her father.[8] When Andor and Jyn’s bitter argument ended, Malbus remained silent when the spy asked if anybody else wanted to contribute.[5]\n\nUpon landing at the Alliance headquarters on Yavin 4[5], Malbus, along with Îmwe and Rook, was taken for questioning by Alliance Intelligence officers.[8] Following the debrief, he and Îmwe headed to the hangar bay where they eventually met Jyn and Rook, who had unsuccessfully lobbied Alliance High Council to launch an attack on the Imperial Center of Military Research on Scarif to retrieve the schematics of the Death Star. Upon seeing Jyn, Malbus stated she did not look happy. After she informed him that the Rebellion preferred surrender over fighting, he asked what she preferred. After Îmwe and Rook declared their intentions to fight, Malbus directed Jyn's attention to a large collection of rebel soldiers, including Andor, standing behind her. Andor told her that he and the soldiers would accompany her, Rook, Îmwe and Malbus to Scarif to steal the plans. Together, the squad boarded SW-0608 and adopted the improvised callsign of Rogue One as they departed the jungle moon.[5]\n\nDuring the journey to the remote tropical planet, Malbus stayed with Îmwe and the rebel soldiers in the cabin beneath the cockpit.[5] Eventually, Jyn joined them and sat beside the pair[8] as they descended towards their designated landing pad. As the ship came in for landing, she delivered a speech to the troops before Andor took over and designated Malbus, Îmwe, the Drabatan soldier Pao and Sergeant Ruescott Melshi to take the main squad east and wide of the ship. He instructed them to find a position between the shuttle and the Citadel Tower that would be used to transmit the stolen plans. Once there, the plan was to distract the waves of troopers to allow Andor and Jyn to infiltrate the Tower, a plan that caused Malbus to smile.[5]\n\nBefore the battle began, Malbus successfully attacked and incapacitated Imperial technician Kent Deezling and Lieutenant Colin Hakelia in the shuttle's cabin, which allowed Andor and Jyn to steal their uniforms and pose as the pair to gain access to the Tower.[5]\n\nMalbus did not know or trust the rebel soldiers he would be fighting alongside, he did not respect their loyalties nor could he rely upon their skills. He fought alongside them because Jyn had accepted them into her own revolution that had risen from the ashes of Jedha. Malbus trusted Jyn's fury, and he had faith in her because Îmwe did. He trusted whomever Îmwe did as he found life more convenient that way, believing eternal wariness to be exhausting.[8]\n\nAfter Rook gave the main squad the all clear to begin their mission, Malbus and the squad poured onto the landing pad and into the jungle. He thought of Rook aboard the ship and thought that, in another life, he would have prayed for the pilot. He knew that Rook's fate would be decided instead by skill or chance, and believed the latter to be more likely.[8]\n\nAs they ran through the jungles, one of the rebels asked Malbus if Îmwe would be able to keep up. At this, Malbus told the rebel to hide his tracks in the sand better to allow Îmwe to keep pace. He was surprised that the rebel had not asked whether Îmwe was a Jedi. Far into the jungle, Malbus stooped to touch the pale sands beneath him. He smelt and tasted the sand, and felt frustrated that even the dirt tasted different to that of Jedha. However, Malbus recognized that he would more than likely never return to his home, and reckoned that Scarif was as much his home as anywhere.[8]\n\nReaching a low hillock, Malbus noticed a barracks ahead of them. A rebel began passing detonators to the squad, but Malbus declined one. When questioned about this by Melshi, Malbus smiled at him and told him someone needed to keep his men alive.[8] The pair hunted shoretroopers and stormtroopers stationed around the barracks,[5] and Malbus ensured he kept one eye on Îmwe, thinking that if the Force failed his friend, he would not. As he incapacitated troopers with his fists, the butt of his cannon, and shock stick, Malbus' arms grew tired and sore quickly, he knew he was aging and could not use his cannon during the initial advance. As the rebel squad took position and watched the barracks, Malbus thought that maybe he could trust them after all.[8] Shortly after, the instruction to detonate the charges from Andor was received and the battle began.[5]\n\nMalbus cut down initial swathes of stormtroopers, and, in the opening minutes, the rebels held the advantage. Malbus took satisfaction in the cries of alarm from the Imperial squads falling around him. He thought of when someone once told him that the Jedi considered anger an abomination that led to the dark side of the Force, but he knew he was no Jedi, and he believed his anger towards the Empire was righteous. Knowing his anger had not sufficed on Jedha, Malbus determined he would be twice as fierce on Scarif to provide Jyn with the distraction she needed. As rebel soldiers began to die around him, Malbus realised he did not know their names and that the fallen would not receive proper death rites. He decided that if anyone were to live through the battle, he would honor them with his fellow survivors.[8]\n\nWith stormtroopers closing in, Malbus was alerted to incoming AT-ACTs by Îmwe.[5] Hearing his friends’ voice reassured him greatly as he feared he had lost Îmwe in the battle.[8] Realizing the grave danger he was in, Malbus ran towards the shoreline alongside Îmwe away from the advancing walkers.[5] He knew that death did not mean failure, but instead failure lay in the shadow of the walkers; with this, his thoughts turned to Jyn and he willed her on in his mind.[8]\n\nReaching the shore, Malbus and the retreating rebels took position in trenches that ran near the ocean.[5] Whilst he knew that a mound of sand would not protect them from the walkers, he took solace knowing that even if he could provide Jyn with a fraction of an instant to aid her mission, it would be better than nothing at all.[8] Taking a Special Forces HH-12 rocket launcher from a nearby rebel, Malbus lined up a shot at one of the walkers and fired. However, the rocket did not disable the vehicle which left the rebels exposed. Malbus[5] bared his teeth in defiance, knowing death had chased him for a long time.[8] Before the walkers could annihilate them, Alliance X-wings appeared and fired upon the transports, saving the rebels - Malbus found himself surprised to be laughing along with the rest of the jubilant squad and directed a thumbs up to the pilots.[5]\n\nAs the battle raged on, Malbus waded through the inferno around him in silence, untouched by fear, grief, or particle bolts. He felt no responsibility for the allies he could not save, nor had he made any oaths or promises of safety to anyone. Though he became more fatigued, he continued to fight and told himself he would fight through the night if that was what Jyn required. He believed that if the mission failed, he had found redemption through killing, if such a thing was possible.[8]\n\nUnder fire from advancing death troopers, Malbus, Îmwe, Melshi - who had been struck by a blaster bolt - and Taidu Sefla, the last members of the main squad, found limited shelter in the narrow embrasures of a bunker complex. They had been tasked with finding a master switch that would allow Rook to transmit a signal to the Rebel Alliance fleet above the planet.[5] Malbus grimly marveled that the fate of planets might be altered by something so trivial as a switch. Pinned down under heavy fire, Malbus knew they could only hold off the Imperials for a matter of minutes.[8]\n\nUpon hearing over Melshi's comlink that Andor and Jyn had retrieved the plans, Malbus snarled in satisfaction.[8] A quickly-expiring Melshi informed him that the master switch was located ten meters from their position in the kill zone. He knew it would be impossible to reach it, and his fears were proved correct when Sefla was instantly gunned down after attempting to reach the console. Shortly after, Melshi succumbed to his fatal wound.[5] Malbus thought maybe it would have been better to have been killed by the walkers, believing that dying cowering in sight of an unachievable victory was a humiliation. He raised his cannon to slaughter the nearby troopers, hoping he could buy time for reinforcements to reach the master switch. He reckoned a final slaughter was all he could offer Jyn and the dead of Jedha, and saw it as one final torment to the Empire.[8]\n\nBefore he could fire, Îmwe rose from the bunker beside him and began striding towards the master switch. The sight terrified Malbus, who screamed for Îmwe to return to the bunker, but his friend continued forward and successfully activated the master switch. Malbus watched on in horror as Îmwe was sent hurling into the dirt from an explosion, and darted across the kill zone to his fallen friend. Taking Îmwe by the hand, Malbus pleaded with his friend not to die, though Îmwe calmly told him that he if he looked for the Force, he would always find him. As his friend died in his arms, Malbus began repeating Îmwe's mantra, “I am one with the Force, and the Force is with me.” As he cradled Îmwe, Malbus witnessed the destruction of SW-0608 in the far distance[5] and realized that Rook, too, had died. He did not know whether Rook had transmitted his message or if Îmwe's sacrifice was pointless, and his anger toward the Empire swelled once more. As he repeated Îmwe's mantra, the words did not bring him comfort, instead he felt conviction, as if they provided a key to the forgotten faith of his youth. He once more felt the significance of the Force in each breath he took and wept in his heart for the Guardian of the Whills he had been and the man he became.[8]\n\nHe rose and strode towards the regrouped death troopers, blasting and killing any that came into his view.[5] He continued to advance on the people who had taken his past, his home, his friend, his hope, and his faith.[8] As he continued, he was struck in the chest plate by a blaster bolt, but rose from his knees despite the pain.[5] His body was caked in ash and he embraced the nightmare as he stumbled forward and continued to eliminate the few death troopers that remained, despite knowing it would never be enough to restore Îmwe or the years he had lost.[8] As a final death trooper emerged into view holding a fragmentation grenade, Malbus blasted them. However, upon death, the trooper relinquished their grip on the live grenade, causing it to roll downhill toward Malbus.[5] He knew he could barely stumble forward, let alone run for cover,[8] and instead used his final moment to turn and face his friend, Chirrut Îmwe, one last time.[5] In his final moments, Malbus thought of how he had faced the threat of death from the walkers with defiance, whereas at the end he faced it with grief but without fear.[8] As the grenade detonated[5], Malbus died in pain, but the feeling did not last long.[8]\n\nThough the remaining members of Rogue One also perished, their sole mission ended in the successful transmission of the Death Star plans to the Alliance Fleet. The superweapon would be destroyed days later by Luke Skywalker leading to the start of the Galactic Civil War that would end with the total defeat of the Empire five years later at the Battle of Jakku. Skywalker later spoke of the crew of Rogue One and his admiration for their sacrifices,[12] and the starfighter group Rogue Squadron was named in honor of Malbus and the fallen squad.[13]\n\nBaze Malbus was a human male who stood at 1.80 meters.[1] He had brown eyes, long black hair, and tan skin.[5] Malbus was a strong man, but he knew how to move himself with speed when needed, and with purpose at every moment.[8] Unlike the deeply spiritual Chirrut Îmwe, whom he regarded as his best friend and moral compass, Malbus had lost his sense of spirituality, including his belief in the Force, as a result of enduring the harsh conditions of Imperial occupation on Jedha. In contrast to Îmwe, Malbus developed a pragmatic viewpoint[6] but ultimately reaffirmed his faith in the Force after his friend's death on Scarif.[5]\n\nMalbus was highly adept at combat. He used an E-5 carbine before switching to his preferred weapon of the MWC-35c \"Staccato Lightning\" repeating cannon; which was good at both long-range sniping and close-quarters combat, and he was strong enough to operate it with relative ease, utilize it with expert marksmanship,[6] killing several Stormtroopers from a long distance and later several death troopers at close range[5] - despite the cannon not being designed for handheld operation.[7]\n\nMalbus wore a chest plate made of quad-folded plastoid polymer armor, a bandolier, a Galven circuit flexible charge belt, and carried high-density power cells held in a carriage frame.[1] He also carried a shock-stick for close combat.[5]\n\nBaze Malbus is portrayed by Jiang Wen in the Star Wars Anthology Series film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Wen's casting in the film was first announced on August 15, 2015. At this time, the first photo of the character was released as well.[14] The first footage of the character was shown in the Rogue One teaser trailer on April 7, 2016.[15]\n\nBaze and Chirrut replaced another pair featured in early treatments of the story—that of the aliens Senna and Lunak. Lunak was cut entirely from the final version of the movie, while Senna eventually became the mercenary Moroff.[16]",
