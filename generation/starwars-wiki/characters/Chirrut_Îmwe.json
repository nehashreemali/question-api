  "content": "Chirrut Îmwe was a blind human male born on the moon Jedha in 53 BBY. He used a uneti-wood staff and handmade lightbow in addition to being a master Zama-shiwo martial artist. One of the Guardians of the Whills, an order of spiritual warrior-monks, he was active during the days of the Galactic Empire and worked as an itinerant preacher in Jedha City. Alongside his close friend, partner, and protector, Baze Malbus, he went to Eadu with Cassian Andor, K-2SO, Jyn Erso, and Bodhi Rook. Îmwe became part of a volunteer group of Rebels tasked with stealing the plans of the first Death Star. Îmwe died during the Battle of Scarif in 1 BBY after assisting Erso and Andor in breaking into the Imperial archives. Chirrut's valiant sacrifice along with the rest of Rogue One ensured the success of the mission and the eventual destruction of the Death Star.\n\nBorn in 53 BBY,[2] Chirrut Îmwe lived on the moon Jedha where he became a member of the Guardians of the Whills alongside his longtime friend Baze Malbus.[4] Towards the end of the Clone Wars,[6] a galactic war fought between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and Galactic Republic that lasted between 22 BBY and 19 BBY,[7] Îmwe was sought out by Steya, who asked him to teach her the ways of zama-shiwo, a fighting style Îmwe had achieved a level of mastery in. For several years, they would meet outside the Temple of the Kyber to practice the forms.[6] However, the Clone Wars ended with the rise of the Galactic Empire, which replaced the Republic and began to impose its will upon the galaxy.[7]\n\nAround 14 BBY,[7] Îmwe responded to a disturbance in a tunnel leading to the Temple of the Kyber. He confronted the individuals Dok-Ondar and Hondo Ohnaka after the latter's protege had been killed and they stole a kyber crystal statue. Îmwe remarked to the pair that their rushed escape did not sound like the footsteps of the pious and could sense they were carrying the stolen item. He introduced himself and informed them that he could not allow theft to occur in such a holy place. When Ohnaka told him he would be easy to defeat as he was blind, Îmwe retorted that there were other ways to see without eyes as he leapt to defend himself.[8]\n\nThe pair continued to duel until Dok-Ondar interrupted, telling Îmwe of his respect for the Guardians and that he was tuned in to the Force enough to know the Ithorian's motivations were not nefarious. He told Îmwe that the statue was one of exactly 2,304 that lined the Temple's tunnels and that the artefact was priceless to him as it could aid in solving the mystery of his parent's murder. He pleaded with Îmwe to let him take the statue out of the dark and back into the light and, after a brief pause, Îmwe relented and allowed the pair to leave the tunnel with the statue.[8] In 1 BBY,[7] Padawan Ezra Bridger entered the World Between Worlds, a place that existed between time and space, and heard Îmwe's voice within.[9]\n\nIn 1 BBY, in the streets of Jedha City, Îmwe, along with former Guardian Baze Malbus, met the Anomid Silvanie Phest, whom he would give charity in the streets to so she could obtain food and water. Îmwe smiled at hearing her soft, modulated voice as it reminded him of the days when her harmonic voice would sing prayers at the Temple of the Kyber, something Îmwe missed greatly. He had spent years at the Temple previously, and he knew that only a handful of Disciples of the Whills, Malbus and himself were all that remained to guard the city and their home. She informed Îmwe that a man was stationed along the Old Shadows near the Temple who was frightening the devoted and claiming to be a Jedi. She feared he was there to bring danger and violence which would alert the Empire and lead to the end of the Disciples and Guardians of the Whills.[6]\n\nÎmwe was intrigued, but Malbus did not believe Phest's claim - something Îmwe did not find surprising. He once believed Jedha held a balance, though knew when the Empire arrived, they had ruptured it in the name of order. It made him sad, and all the more determined to keep his faith in the Force and to find a way to ease the suffering of those around him. Îmwe agreed to help, and despite Malbus' grumblings, the pair followed Phest. In the streets and marketplaces, Îmwe smelt fear in the air. Occasionally, he himself felt fear but he never caught the scent from Malbus. Reaching their destination, Îmwe heard the man claiming to be a Jedi. He softly told himself he was one with the Force and stretched out with his feelings - though he was not a Jedi nor was he able to utilize Force abilities,[5] he could feel the Force around him. Sometimes it was effortless, and other times it was difficult, but he felt the Force moving around him, binding him and the galaxy together. He felt the warmth of the light and the chill of the dark, and the further he stretched out, he felt like he could almost see. When the feeling slipped away, it did not leave him entirely, instead feeling like a lingering memory. His connection to the Force around him only increased his feeling of pain at Malbus' lack of faith.[6]\n\nReaching out again through the Force, he felt the man was no Jedi. The man, Wernad, implored Îmwe to stand with him against the Imperials. Îmwe took the man's hand and asked for his name, then held out his palm and felt Wernad's face before telling the man that his desire to fight the Empire went against what he claimed to be. As Wernad began to argue, Îmwe silenced him by asking how long he had worked in the kyber mines, a question the man had not expected. Wernad confirmed to Îmwe that his clutchmates had passed away during their time working and that he desired to make the Empire pay. Imwe told him he could not involve innocents in his plan and instructed everyone to sit. When Wernad stated he had to do something, Îmwe told him that by keeping the faith, they were doing just that.[6]\n\nReturning to the room they shared near the Old Market, Îmwe sat in his usual space in the room and smiled to himself as he meditated. After serving them both tarine tea, Malbus told Îmwe that he believed Wernad was not wrong with his words. Îmwe suggested that maybe Wernad was the wrong man to lead the fight, to which Malbus retorted that it was not his friend's place to decide that. Îmwe simply replied that it was no more his place than it was Malbus' to watch over him. When Malbus described the destruction the Empire had brought to Jedha, Îmwe agreed that he understood the reason for Wernad’s rage.[6]\n\nLater that night, Îmwe and Malbus hid in the darkness of midnight near the LZ-Cresh landing bay, where they eventually intended to steal weapons, medicine, food, and tea from a landspeeder that would be approaching a specific Zeta-class Heavy Cargo Shuttle. When the hauler arrived, Îmwe identified it immediately and became frustrated at Malbus who wanted to wait for confirmation. When Malbus said he was being particularly annoying that night, Îmwe remarked that there was plenty of night left to go. Eventually, Îmwe made his way into position to attract the attention of the stormtroopers in the speeder. The four stormtroopers in the speeder did not believe that Îmwe was an innocent civilian and threatened to run him down. Before they could, Malbus shot three of them before Îmwe eliminated the final trooper with his staff. The pair leapt into the speeder and Îmwe joked that he should drive as they headed to meet Denic, a local insurgent, and provide her with the stolen weapons and ammo.[6]\n\nThe pair headed to the Gimm sisters' orphanage where they delivered the food and medicine to Killi Gimm and her sister Kaya, who looked after the city's orphans. A grateful Killi served the two men tarine tea, which Îmwe gladly accepted. He rested on a stool and heard the sounds of children's laughter coming from the common room. Îmwe smiled at hearing this as it was a sound he had not heard in a long time. His smile vanished at the harsh sound of Killi coughing, which she blamed on the dust. When she told the pair her cough was only bad on some days but better on others, Îmwe asked what day it was then. She told him not to make her laugh as her cough would return. Îmwe took her hand, telling her the Force was with him and he was one with the Force. In reply, she told him she feared nothing, for all is as the Force wills. He then felt Malbus' sorrow for Killi through the Force. Îmwe informed her that there was enough Respitic for her to take, but she refused, saying the children's needs were more important. She joked that Îmwe had adopted her stubbornness over time.[6]\n\nÎmwe thought about how the city had not needed an orphanage until the Empire arrived and knew the Imperials had everything the orphanage needed in terms of supplies. The necessity of procuring the cargo weighed on Îmwe, but he did not feel guilt or regret for his behavior, instead, he felt sadness. He knew their actions were undertaken with the best intentions but he knew that the stormtrooper he had killed would not be the last life he took. He was at peace with the necessity of his actions though he took no pleasure from them, and took no small comfort in knowing Malbus felt the same way.[6]\n\nÎmwe continued to listen for the sound of the children's joy and laughter to lift his spirit. When Kaya and Killi returned to the room, he asked how long the supplies would last. Kaya replied positively but was worried about how the Imperials would respond. Îmwe told her the Imperials saw their actions as theft and not charity, therefore they would target the thieves, but heard the resignation in her voice when she said the Empire would realize what was happening eventually. Malbus asked the pair if they wished for them to stop their supply runs, and Killi stated she was worried about what would happen in the long run. When she said they would be trapped in the cycle they were in as long as the Empire was around, Îmwe declared they find a way to break the cycle. Killi agreed, saying they must do so before the cycle broke them.[6]\n\nLeaving the orphanage, Îmwe and Malbus argued over the latter's damaged weapon. When the pair agreed that they knew of no one who would put up with the other, the argument ended in good spirits. Malbus quickly informed Îmwe that they were being followed, a suggestion that amused Îmwe who told his friend to quiz the strangers on why they were following the pair.[6]\n\nAs they entered Hopper Town, Îmwe sensed a large stormtrooper presence in the area and halted Malbus in his stride. He told his friend that violence was coming and that they should move. When they reached the town's narrow alleyways, the pair bickered over who would go first after Îmwe realized Malbus would not fit. Their discussion was cut short when Malbus was spotted by the troopers, who advanced upon him. Malbus pushed Îmwe into the alleyway and told him he would catch up before running in the opposite direction.[6]\n\nÎmwe made his way back home where a Twi'lek named Beezer Fortuna and a Sabat named Leevan Tenza met him. The pair had been the ones following Îmwe and Malbus earlier in the day. He served them tarine tea, thinking it was the polite thing to do. When Malbus returned after nightfall with a new MWC-35c \"Staccato Lightning\" repeating cannon, Îmwe calmly told him to resist the urge to use it upon their visitors. Îmwe remained silent as his friend confronted the strangers as to their motives, and when they were offered an invite to meet with someone keen to meet them.[6]\n\nÎmwe and Malbus were taken by speeder to a base an hour outside of the Holy City. He could sense that Fortuna, Tenza, and the driver were warriors who had taken lives, and would be willing to do so again, and reckoned they were no different to him and Malbus in that particular sense. When they arrived at their destination, Îmwe centered himself and could feel that they were far into the frigid desert. He felt they were in an aged place and could sense memories and stories buried around him, and realized he had not been there before. He asked Malbus what he could see, and his friend replied that the Three Faces were surrounding them as they ventured further to meet with the mysterious person who had summoned them. As they entered a canyon, Îmwe sensed a presence waiting for them and stepped in front of Malbus, who had raised his new weapon at the man in front of them.[6]\n\nÎmwe informed the man that they had come at his instruction, and, if they were in an executioner's field, the gesture was too much effort to spend on the likes of him and Malbus. The man said he lived with caution and those who fight the Empire would understand. The stranger's raspy breathing made Îmwe think of Killi as he reached out to sense the man through the Force but found only emptiness, sadness, grief, pain, and rage with only a small ember of light. He eventually introduced himself as Saw Gerrera, and Îmwe told him they were not familiar with him. Gerrera invited the pair to fight alongside him and his Partisans to end the Imperial presence on Jedha, though Îmwe questioned why Gerrera needed their help specifically. Gerrera told them he chose them as they knew Jedha intimately and that the planet was the perfect site to hurt the Empire. Îmwe could sense Malbus responding to Gerrera’s words and knew the passion answered to passion. It nearly proved enough for him to ignore his instinct that Gerrera's motives were not as altruistic as he declared them to be. The pair left the canyon with Gerrera asking them to consider his offer.[6]\n\nWhen they were transported back to their home in the Holy City, Fortuna gave Îmwe a small communication device to contact him. Entering their home, Îmwe challenged Malbus on his belief that fighting the Empire alongside the Partisans was better than not fighting at all. His friend believed the time to fight had come and Îmwe agreed that the Empire would not allow Gerrera's Partisans any foothold on the planet. Îmwe questioned whether Gerrera was all he said he was, and believed he had lied to the pair by omission rather than declaration. When Malbus admitted he did not trust Gerrera but believed his words, Îmwe sighed and told his friend he felt the same.[6]\n\nThe pair later headed to the orphanage to find it had been raided and emptied by the Imperials. When Malbus informed him the orphanage was not in a good state, Îmwe called inside for the Gimm sisters but met no reply. They made their way inside the empty building, and Îmwe surmised that no one was there and that no blasters had been used as the air did not smell like blasterfire. Accepting that everyone had been evicted, the pair left the orphanage and were met by five stormtroopers outside. Îmwe smiled and enquired whose company they were in to emit an air of innocence. After Malbus informed him that they were stormtroopers, he raised his staff in the air and declared his support for Emperor Palpatine. After feigning ignorance of his surroundings, Îmwe enquired where the residents of the orphanage were taken. After the stormtrooper sergeant stated she did not know, Îmwe enquired whether the street was empty before splitting the sergeant's helmet in two with his staff as Malbus dealt with the remaining troopers using his new cannon.[6]\n\nThey later located Killi, Kaya, and the orphans at an abandoned house Malbus had found years prior. Inside, the sisters and the children were gripped with fear and sadness. The sisters did not blame the pair for the Empire's actions in evicting them, and Îmwe asked whether anyone was hurt. When Kaya confirmed B'asia, a young Togruta, was struck by a stormtrooper, Îmwe could feel Malbus' strong glare on him as he told her he worried about the cold night ahead and the lack of supplies. He asked to be alone with Malbus, though the pair sat in silence for a short while after the sisters left. Îmwe began to repeat the Guardian's Mantra to himself before passing Fortuna's communication device to Malbus. He instructed his friend to request food, water, medicine, and beds for the orphans in exchange for their help with Gerrera's cause, a request that Malbus completed.[6]\n\nAfter allying with the Partisans, Îmwe participated in smaller missions in the initial months but believed Gerrera thought his blindness was a liability. He also thought he made the Partisan leader uncomfortable.[6]\n\nTwo months into their partnership, as part of his latest mission, Îmwe was positioned a kilometer away from the intersection between Blessing Way and the Square of Stars in Jedha City. There he waited as an All Terrain Scout Transport headed towards an area where the Partisans would ambush it on Îmwe’s signal. While waiting for the transport to reach its position, Îmwe thought of Gerrera and the secrets he was hiding, though he could not blame the Partisan leader for being paranoid as he knew the Empire wanted him dead at any cost. He reflected on the effects that his and Malbus' actions had had - stealing supplies from the Empire had led to the loss of the orphanage and how for every insurgent who struck at a stormtrooper, another trooper had arrived to strike back. Îmwe was unsure whether Gerrera’s war against the Empire had changed that or simply accelerated the escalation, but he knew the Imperials would continue to mine the planet’s kyber if they could get away with it. He thought of how the Empire had no respect for the lives of the citizens, and Gerrera's war had not changed that, believing that when a bully turned angry, only innocents suffered.[6]\n\nAfter sensing that the transport had reached its position, Îmwe alerted Benthic, a Tognath and one of Gerrera's most trusted warriors. He felt the vibrations as the walker exploded in the ambush and knew the Partisans would be merciless in their approach. He was all too aware that he had made this happen as part of the mission and knew neither side would show mercy.[6]\n\nÎmwe and Malbus later met Fortuna and Kullbee Sperado, a male Meftian, in a Tapcafe near the Old Shadows. After being introduced to Sperado and having sensed the churning cold left in his wake, Îmwe told him that he was weighed by his past, causing the Meftian to ponder his words. Sperado took Îmwe's hand and asked if he would pray for him, but Îmwe denied this and instead replied he would show him how to pray for himself. At that moment, Îmwe felt a warmth returning to the Meftian. Together, they created a plan to halt the Empire’s pillaging of the planet's kyber, and Îmwe was quick to ensure the lives of the miners would be safe. The plan was made to ambush a speeder run from the mines to the city and obtain the crystals. Fortuna enquired whether Îmwe would be joining the mission due to his blindness, causing him to jokingly scold Malbus for not telling him he was blind. After the meeting ended, Îmwe walked Sperado to the Old Shadows. He told the Meftian that everybody had a place and that it could not be lost as it was inside of him, and if it were misplaced then the task was to find it again. He introduced Sperado to Angber Trel, a member of the Disciples of the Whills, and departed. The following day, he wished the Meftian luck in continuing to find his place.[6]\n\nWhen the mission began, Fortuna still had doubts over Îmwe's ability to contribute. He and Malbus took up positions on one side of a cliff outside of the city, and opposite them were a Talpini and a human male that Fortuna had brought with him. For the mission, Îmwe used his lightbow, and even though it had been years since he had used it, it still carried an air of familiarity to him. The pair joked about Malbus' cannon exploding before the call to action from Fortuna came. Îmwe felt the detonation of explosives in the ravine below and sensed shots echoing from opposite. He sensed a stormtrooper in the speeder aiming to fire on the Partisans but he eliminated him with a shot of his lightbow, an action that brought an apology from Fortuna for initially doubting him.[6]\n\nTwo months later, the pair had participated in more operations to wound and enrage the Empire than Îmwe could count. He was growing wary of the impact he and the rest of the Partisans were having and of Gerrera's motivations. He argued with Malbus stating that given the number of stormtrooper deaths and reclaimed kyber crystals, the message they had sent to the Empire had not been received as the Partisans had wished. Malbus challenged him to come up with a better way, and while Îmwe could not, he told his friend that the wrong people were suffering as a result of their actions. He revealed that the number of children in the orphanage had doubled due to the escalated conflict, and knew in himself that Gerrera's arrival on Jedha had made the situation far worse. He was aware that others aside from him and Malbus had been recruited to Gerrera's cause and that every attack against the Empire grew more significant and coordinated. After a period of silence, Malbus told his friend that he was going to speak directly with Gerrera regarding a solution.[6]\n\nÎmwe's fears proved correct as the Empire upped its presence across the planet in terms of personnel and weaponry the day following Malbus' leaving to meet with Gerrera. In the ensuing skirmishes, Îmwe found Althin, the son of Steya and Tok, amongst the carnage. The young Rodian had suffered a broken arm, and Îmwe carried him to safety while repeating the Guardians mantra. He had known Althin since the day he was born having been friends with his parents, and the knowledge that Steya and Tok had died in the skirmish left Îmwe with a feeling of deep, powerful anger within him, a feeling he had not felt in many years. He felt anger at the Force's will, at Gerrera, the Empire, and Malbus, but also for himself. His anger toward himself was due to his arrogance in believing he could end Jedha's suffering when he believed he could not escort a grieving child to safety. He continued towards the orphanage, all the while not being able to coerce Althin into speaking with him. When they reached the orphanage, Îmwe promised the Rodian he would not be far from him. He met Malbus there and the pair shared chav tea. Îmwe told his friend he grew concerned for his well-being as he had begun to miss his nagging. When Kaya told Îmwe that Althin was receiving attention, he replied that the boy needed love, peace, quiet, and time. His concern at the rapidly diminishing space in the orphanage was felt also by Malbus, who told his friend that the children should be taken off the planet. Îmwe was sceptical of the plan given the number of potential hurdles to overcome, but Malbus informed him that Gerrera had agreed to provide them with a ship. They posited the plan to Killi and Kaya, with Killi opting to stay as she was dying from her ailments, something Îmwe had felt and predicted.[6]\n\nThat night, the pair headed to Denic's garage where they explained the plan in the hope of recruiting her to pilot the ship Gerrera would supply. She believed the plan was impossible given the Imperial presence on and above the planet, but Îmwe told her that there was a space between 'next to impossible' and 'impossible' and that is where they would fit. Her efforts to persuade them to recruit Woan Barso were unsuccessful after Îmwe stated it would be foolish to trust the children to a pilot who did not trust himself. Eventually, Denic relented and agreed to be a part of the plan.[6]\n\nOne week on, Îmwe, along with Killi, Kaya, and Denic led a procession of thirty-four children to the Jedha City spaceport where Malbus would meet them. The sight drew much attention from the locals and the Imperials, who did not know how to respond. When the party arrived at the spaceport, over five hundred locals joined them in solidarity and curiosity. The plan had been Gerrera's idea, he believed even the Empire would not open fire on a group of children, though Îmwe referred to the plan as a test of faith. He held Althin's hand as they entered the spaceport but felt a chill emanating from Malbus, who informed him that Gerrera instead intended to use the Sentinel-class landing craft he had commandeered to destroy the Dauntless in orbit above the city.[6]\n\nÎmwe centered himself and strode towards the ship, telling Sperado, who had been in on Gerrera's plan, that the children had walked the length of the city having been promised a place on the shuttle. The Meftiak attempted to dissuade Îmwe and Fortuna claimed the people of Jedha needed a symbol of hope and that was Gerrera. Îmwe questioned him on how big of an explosive was needed to take down a Star Destroyer and asked whether Gerrera would trade the children's futures to strike a minor blow to the Empire. He stated that Fortuna, Gerrera, and everyone present knew that attacking the Star Destroyer would not free Jedha. He questioned Wernad and Sperado on their actions before lifting Althin and striding up the shuttle's ramp, with the Partisans eventually leaving the ship reluctantly and bringing an end to the pair's relationship with Gerrera.[6]\n\nAs the shuttle began to power up, Îmwe and Althin hugged as the young Rodian recited the Guardian's mantra to Îmwe, which pleased him immensely. He then argued with Malbus as to which of them would stay with the orphans, with Îmwe telling his friend he must leave Jedha as his anger would only continue to grow. Eventually, Killi interrupted and told them both to stay on Jedha as she knew neither would leave the other. He believed the Empire would never know who was responsible for what they had done, concluding that they would blame the Partisans and Gerrera would claim it to be a blow struck against the Empire.[6]\n\nÎmwe and Malbus slipped into the throng of bystanders and made their way home. Îmwe offered to make his friend a tarine tea when they arrived, an offer Malbus begrudgingly accepted.[6]\n\nMonths later, in the streets of Jedha City, Îmwe encountered Jyn Erso and Rebel spy Cassian Jeron Andor after he sensed her kyber crystal necklace. He had been chanting to the bustling crowds when he asked Jyn if she would trade the necklace for a glimpse into her future, and told her she must pay for the knowledge of how he knew she was wearing a necklace. He asked her what she knew of kyber crystals, and nodded approvingly when she told him that her father would say they powered Jedi lightsabers. Before they could continue their conversation, Andor pulled her away. As he did, Îmwe shouted to her, \"The strongest stars have hearts of kyber\".[4]\n\nAfter a skirmish between Gerrera's Partisans and Imperial forces in Tythoni Square, Îmwe and Malbus came to the aid of Jyn and Andor after they had been accosted by stormtroopers. Îmwe instructed the troopers to let Jyn and Andor pass in peace, and declared, \"The Force is with me, and I am with the Force. And I fear nothing, all is as the Force wills it\". He positioned himself in the center of the troopers and, using a combination of his heightened senses, his staff, and his mastery of Zama-shiwo martial arts, he was able to take out the squad of stormtroopers. However, he was saved by Malbus who eliminated a second wave of onrushing troopers, though he was aggrieved that his friend nearly shot him in the process. He told Andor that the Force protected him after Malbus denied that they were Jedi. The group were then taken captive by Benthic and the Partisans. Îmwe reasoned with them that they were not friends of the Empire, though Benthic responded that Andor had killed his men. The group were taken to Gerrera, and Îmwe was incredulous as he was blindfolded for the journey.[4]\n\nÎmwe and his companions were taken to the Catacombs of Cadera and imprisoned while Jyn was taken directly to Gerrera. He repeated the Guardian's mantra in their cell, and Malbus mocked him as he prayed for the cell door to open. Îmwe told Andor that Malbus was bothered as he knew it was possible, saying his friend was once the most devoted Guardian of them all. He then told Andor to relax, saying there is more than one sort of prison and believed the spy carried his wherever he went.[4]\n\nAfter nearly an hour,[10] Îmwe asked Andor who was in the next cell. Andor ascertained that it was Bodhi Rook, an Imperial defector who had brought a message describing the Death Star to Gerrera from Galen Walton Erso, Jyn's father and an Imperial scientist. While they were in the cell, the Death Star had arrived over the planet and fired a single reactor beam on the Holy City, beginning a chain reaction that obliterated the city[4] and a large chunk of the planet.[11] After Andor was able to open the prison door, he told the pair to extract the pilot[4] and meet him on the surface.[10]\n\nUpon reaching the surface, Îmwe asked his friend what he saw, but Malbus could not find the words. Instead, Malbus instructed him to run towards Andor's incoming U-wing. After reaching the ship, Andor's reprogrammed KX-series security droid K-2SO piloted them to safety and away from Îmwe's destroyed home for the final time.[4]\n\nWhile the ship was in hyperspace, Îmwe asked his friend if the whole city was gone, and Malbus sullenly confirmed it was. Later, as Andor pressed Jyn as to whether she had retrieved Galen's message that described how to destroy the superweapon, Îmwe stated he believed Jyn's statement that her father had rigged a trap, despite her not having the hologram.[4]\n\nÎmwe and his new companions set a course for Eadu. Andor had been tasked with extracting Galen so he could testify in front of the Galactic Senate, though privately he was ordered to assassinate the scientist by General Davits Draven. Upon entering Eadu's atmosphere en route to the Eadu Energy Conversion Laboratory, the U-wing battled the stormy weather on the planet, and Îmwe prayed to himself before the ship crashed into the mountainous planet below.[4]\n\nAfter Andor and Rook had departed the ship, Îmwe asked the group whether Andor looked like a killer. Though Malbus replied that he did not, Îmwe told Jyn that the Force moved darkly around a creature that was about to kill. This prompted Jyn to leave the ship to search for her father, leaving Îmwe, Malbus, and K-2SO still aboard. After a short while, Îmwe left the ship and told Malbus he was going to follow Jyn as her path was clear. When Malbus wished him good luck, Îmwe replied that he did not lead luck as he had his friend with him. Îmwe led Malbus up a treacherous ridge overlooking the facilities landing pad.[4] After Malbus scoped out the activity on the pad, Îmwe sensed anger in his friend and reminded him that they were not there to exact revenge on Imperials. Malbus argued as to why they were participating in the mission, and Îmwe told his friend he followed Jyn because she shone. Placing his hand on his friend's bulky shoulder, the pair enjoyed a moment of peace in the rain before the approaching Alliance starfighters above them shattered the silence.[10] As the X-wings attacked the Imperial facility, Îmwe successfully destroyed a TIE/LN starfighter using his lightbow.[4]\n\nThe assault ended following a proton torpedo being dropped by a rebel starfighter, killing Galen Erso and causing the Imperials, including Director Orson Callan Krennic, to fall back. During the skirmish, Rook had commandeered a stolen Zeta-class cargo shuttle, SW-0608, and Îmwe rejoined the rest of the crew onboard as they escaped the planet.[4] With a newfound respect, Andor praised Îmwe for eliminating a TIE Fighter with his lightbow.[10]\n\nWith the ship in hyperspace en route to the Rebel base on Yavin 4, Îmwe sat motionless and listened as Andor and Jyn fought over the spies intention to assassinate her father.[4]\n\nUpon landing at the Base One, Îmwe reminded Malbus to show courtesy to the waiting rebels as they were guests in their home. Îmwe was taken for questioning by Alliance Intelligence Officers, but was discharged after.(R1 novel) He reunited with Malbus in the base's hangar and, shortly after, met Jyn and Rook following their unsuccessful attempt to rally Alliance support to retrieve the Death Star plans from the Imperial Center of Military Research on Scarif. Îmwe knew Jyn wanted to fight despite the Alliance High Command's ruling, and knew the Force was strong with their intentions. After Andor, along with a small group of rebel soldiers, pledged his support for the mission, Îmwe joined the band of rebels aboard SW-0608 as they prepared for the journey to Scarif.[4]\n\nAboard the ship, Îmwe tapped his stick enthusiastically following Jyn telling the troops, \"May the Force be with us.\" As the stolen ship embarked on the unsanctioned mission, the motley crew adopted an impromptu callsign from Rook - Rogue One.[4]\n\nÎmwe remained in the lower cabin during the journey,[4] and allowed himself to laugh at Jyn's incredulity at being made a sergeant by Taidu Sefla.[10] Following a speech from Jyn to inspire the soldiers, Andor assigned Îmwe with Malbus, Ruescott Melshi and the Drabatan Pao with the instruction to take the main squad and move them clear of the ship towards the Citadel Tower. Once they found an ideal location, they were to begin the assault and draw the fighters away from Andor and Jyn, who would be infiltrating the vault with K-2SO. Before they departed to begin their task, Îmwe felt Jyn's warm smile towards him as she wished him a silent farewell.[4]\n\nÎmwe and the main squad headed through the jungle,[4] and of one of the rebel soldiers questioned Malbus as to whether Îmwe could keep pace with them. Malbus scolded the soldier and Îmwe snapped that he could hear him too. As he hid his tracks, Îmwe began to chant, \"May the Force of others be with you\".[10]Eventually, they arrived near a barracks, and while the rebel soldiers began placing detonators around the site, Îmwe and Malbus began silently hunting and eliminating any stormtroopers in the area - Îmwe utilizing his stick to down his enemies. After Andor gave the instruction, the rebels began detonating the explosives and the battle began.[4]\n\nUsing his lightbow, Îmwe successfully took down many stormtroopers as Rogue One held firm in the initial stages of the battle. However, the stormtroopers reinforcements began to overwhelm the small band of rebels. During the intense fighting, Îmwe sensed the presence of incoming All Terrain Armored Cargo Transport walkers and immediately told Malbus to run. The pair, along with the surviving soldiers, headed to the shoreline and bunkered down in trenches along the oceanfront. Îmwe watched as a rocket launched by Malbus did not stop the walkers approach, but the squad was saved from certain death by Alliance X-wing fighters, who were part of the larger rebel fleet that had amassed over the planet to support Rogue One.[4]\n\nÎmwe later made his way to a bunker near the Citadel Tower after Melshi received instruction from Rook that they needed to find and activate a master switch to allow him to contact the Rebel fleet.[4] He leapt between blaster bolts as he made his way to the bunker, where he found himself panting following the exertion of battle.[10] He was joined by Malbus, Sefla, and Melshi - who had taken a blaster bolt and was quickly expiring - and began firing his lightbow at the stormtroopers who had taken position around the bunker. Before succumbing to his wound, Melshi informed the trio that the master switch was located on a console ten meters away, though Sefla was immediately killed when he attempted to reach it.[4]\n\nSensing the dire situation at hand, Îmwe rose and stepped out of the bunker.[4] He felt the warmth of an alien star on his skin and the sea breeze pawing at his robes. Around him, he smelt jungle flowers and the sweet stink of dirt beetles amongst the conflagaration and death, and heard the chittering of an unknown beast beyond the sounds of blaster bolts.[10] He added his own voice to the noise and he began repeating his mantra, \"I am one with the Force, and the Force is with me\".[4] He was aware that without the temple he could not truly be a Guardian of the Whills, without joy and frivolity he could not be a source of humour to his peers, and without the Holy City he could not be a protector of how beloved world but he truly knew that he was not a warrior at heart and the events of the battle had eroded his spirit. Îmwe had fought and killed because it was necessary, but he felt in that moment the necessity was no more.[10] As he continued striding towards the console and repeating his mantra, he ignored the pained cries of Malbus to come back to him. He felt blaster bolts whip past him as he approached the console, listening for telltale echoes with his staff as to its location.[4]\n\nHe had questioned his own wisdom before leaving the bunker - how might he separate the will of the Force from his own will and ego, but as he approached the console, he felt no doubt or fear in his heart. He had felt the Force express itself and it had simply asked him to walk.[10] As he reached the console, he found the master switch and activated it,[4] and began to smile as he thought of Rook in that moment. Following this, his path became obscured[10] and he was aware of Malbus crying out for him again. He turned and began to make his way back to the bunker,[4] but the rhythm of his breathing was off and the sensations around him failed to coalesce.[10]\n\nBefore he could continue, a death trooper caused an explosion that violently propelled Îmwe forward.[4] He felt pain flash through his bones and every injury he had ever suffered ignited once more. As he hit the ground, he could not feel his staff or his hand, only a throbbing and a numb weight at the end of his arm. Recalling how zama-shiwo taught one to control pain, Îmwe permitted his blood to spill onto the sands of Scarif without experiencing suffering. He believed that the violence inflicted upon his body troubled him less than the violence he had inflicted upon others, and he knew he was dying. As he heard Malbus approach, he decided against telling his friends that he could not see following the explosion as he knew Malbus had always needed comfort more than humour. He allowed himself to wonder how Malbus had crossed the battlefield to reach him, but knew in his heart that the Force had reunited them before the end.[10] Malbus cradled Îmwe and pleaded with him not to die, but Îmwe used his last words to softly reassure his friend that it was okay, and if he looked for the Force, he would always find him. Before he died, Îmwe heard Malbus repeat his mantra,[4] and the words echoed in his heart once more.[10]\n\nWith his final words, Îmwe was able to remind Malbus of his connection to the Force and to reconnect with his teachings as a Guardian of the Whills. Though the entire crew of Rogue One died on Scarif, their mission was ultimately successful as the stolen plans were transmitted to the Rebel fleet.[4] With this information, the Rebel Alliance were able to destroy the Death Star with help from Luke Skywalker,[12] who spoke with admiration for the members of Rogue One upon learning of their sacrifices.[13]. The starfighter group Rogue Squadron was later named in honor of Îmwe and the fallen squad.[14] The Rebel Alliance obtained greater support following the destruction of the battle station, and eventually scored a decisive victory over the Empire at the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, ushering in the era of the New Republic.[15]\n\nIn 32 ABY, the remnants of Îmwe's staff found their way to Merokia, and the home of Force-sensitive teenager and Jedi artifact hunter Karr Nuq Sin. The bottom of the staff had shattered and fragmented, and was completely blackened and charred, but Nuq Sin knew that something had kept it from crumbling entirely. Explaining his abilities in psychometry to his friend Maize Raynshi, Nuq Sin explained that he was able to see visions through the Force upon coming into contact with certain objects. Upon touching the staff, he said that the owner did not wear traditional Jedi attire and did not carry a lightsaber. Instead, he clutched the staff and mumbled about the Force in the middle of a large battle.[16]\n\nChirrut Îmwe was a blind human male, with pale blue eyes, black hair, and tan skin. Although he lacked Force abilities,[5][6] Îmwe was a strong believer in it and the Jedi way,[17] carrying a simple staff[18] and traditional lightbow bowcaster,[19] contrasting greatly with his partner's more pragmatic personality. His devotion to spirituality helped him overcome his blindness and become a formidable warrior.[17] Îmwe's mastery of the martial art form known as Zama-shiwo were said to have given him supernatural powers that would alter his heart and oxygen intake.[20] Îmwe always kept the cause of his blindness a close secret.[21]\n\nChirrut Îmwe is portrayed by Donnie Yen in the Star Wars stand-alone film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Director Gareth Edwards allowed Yen to flesh out the character as he saw fit. One of the traits that Yen created for his character was Îmwe's blindness.[22] According to Yen's interview with Apple Daily, the actor also suggested that his character uses a blind man's walking staff that doubles as a weapon for fighting stormtroopers.[23] According to a social media post by Phil Szostak, the character's blindness in Rogue One inspired by the Japanese fictional character Zatoichi, a blind masseur and samurai.[24]",
