  "content": "Rex, designated CT-7567, was a veteran Clone Captain, Clone Commander, and Advanced Recon Commando who commanded the Grand Army of the Republic's famed 501st Legion of clone troopers during the Clone Wars. Rex later served as a captain and commander within the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Rex participated in many battles over the course of the Clone Wars. As the captain of the 501st, Rex served as third-in-command to Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, whose bravery and unconventionality in battle he came to share. In addition to being a close friend of Skywalker, he also became friends with Skywalker's apprentice, Ahsoka Tano. He was close with Marshal Commander Cody, with their relationship mirroring that of their respective Jedi Generals, Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, whom Rex was also well acquainted with. Rex and his companions often worked together during the front-line campaigns against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\n\nThroughout his career, Rex proved to be an effective leader who truly cared for the men under his command, even as he began to doubt his own future—and those of his clone brethren—in the Republic. His leadership was put to the ultimate test at the Battle of Umbara, when he was forced to lead the 501st Legion under the obstinate and aggressive Jedi General Pong Krell, who was secretly a Separatist agent. Rex's experiences with Krell forced him to reappraise his rigid adherence to orders—however, this had not been the first time Rex had questioned his purpose and orders. A notable example had been during the Battle of Saleucami, when he allowed the clone deserter Cut Lawquane to stay out of the war. Rex used his combat skills and training to help train local insurgents on Onderon to emancipate their world. Rex's faith in the Republic was sorely tested by events such as the framing of Tano as well as the death of his longtime friend and comrade Fives, who had gone rogue after unearthing an anti-Jedi directive known as Clone Protocol 66 that had been bred into all the Republic's clone troopers.\n\nFives's death led him to uncover his inhibitor chip, which enabled him and his longtime friend Ahsoka to escape Order 66 after the Siege of Mandalore. After living on Seelos with fellow Clone Commanders Gregor and Wolffe, Rex joined the Phoenix Cell and reunited with his old friend Tano. Rex also became a reliable ally of the Spectres rebel cell and forged enduring friendships with the Great Jedi Purge survivor Kanan Jarrus and his apprentice Ezra Bridger as well as the rest of the Ghost crew. During the early stages of the Rebellion, Rex would use his skills and knowledge to help advance the Rebel Alliance's cause. He was eventually promoted to the rank of commander and fought in the climactic Battle of Endor, which saw the first death of Emperor Palpatine, the redemption of his former Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, and the destruction of the second Death Star.\n\nThe clone trooper originally known by the number CT-7567,[18] only to be later[19] and better known by his adopted name of Rex, was,[3] like the rest of his clone brothers, created from the genetic template[4] of the Mandalorian[20] bounty hunter Jango Fett[4] in the clone factories of the planet Kamino.[21] He was amongst the first generation of clones created for the Grand Army of the Republic.[9] Grown to be among the greatest soldiers in the galaxy[19] and a leader,[22] Rex was given additional command training and was promoted to be a Clone Captain in the Grand Army of the Republic.[19][23] Like other clone trooper officers, Rex was given ARC training.[24] After his training was complete, Rex was assigned command of the 501st Clone Battalion's Torrent Company.[22] Rex's instructors also bestowed his helmet with Jaig Eyes, a Mandalorian[25] combat honor.[26]\n\nRex served in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic to protect its citizens[28] as part of his loyalty to the Republic.[17] He participated in the First Battle of Geonosis, fighting the Confederacy of Independent Systems' massive force of battle droids.[29] Rex and his clone troopers fought well and earned veteran status in the Republic Army.[19] Throughout the war, Rex's reputation continued to grow, eventually resulting in the captain becoming considered the hero of the clone army.[30] Despite only being a captain, Rex was assigned leadership of the 501st itself.[5] In the aftermath of the Battle of Geonosis, the 501st Clone Battalion was reorganized[31] and sponsored by Republic Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, eventually turning it into the 501st Legion,[32] and placed under the command of the recently-knighted Jedi General Anakin Skywalker,[33] with Rex being assigned as Skywalker's first-in-command.[18]\n\nRex participated in the Battle of Arantara, where he led his soldiers to the frontline without Skywalker. Injured and knocked out, with Rex's armor also damaged in the conflict,[27] Rex's life was in danger until he was saved by Skywalker.[34] Awaking later, Rex expressed surprise that Skywalker had come back for him, to which Skywalker responded that it should have been him in his place and that a leader always leads from the front.[27] Rex soon developed a respect for his general, with Skywalker also quickly coming to respect the captain.[34] The two even became friends.[27] Rex was eager to follow orders early in the war but became less tightly wound in time.[18]\n\nRex also worked alongside Commander Cody at incidents such as Tibrin.[8] He also came to meet and befriend clone commando Gregor.[35] At one point during his service, Rex and his fellow clones encountered dekamites, which they dubbed \"swamp spiders,\" but defeated them.[36] At another point,[6] Rex[37] and other clones were confronting a large force of enemies. The clone captain ordered Squad 2 to pick their targets and, after another clone exclaimed that there were too many opponents, warned Gold Six to watch their stabilizer. Rex also ordered another individual to watch out for what was happening at their left.[6]\n\nRex, Skywalker, and several of his men undertook a mission to Benglor. There, they ran into a creature that ate several droids and clone trooper Bellow. Rex ordered a retreat, but clone trooper Hardcase disobeyed orders and turned his Z-6 rotary blaster cannon on the creature. Skywalker later saved Hardcase.[38]\n\nRex, along with his 501st, Cody's 7th Sky Corps, and Commander Wolffe's 104th Battalion were sent to Hisseen. There, they protected the Hisseenians from the Separatist Droid Army. After Generals Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Plo Koon finished the last of the droids, Rex and the rest of the Republic forces continued to protect the Hisseenians.[38] Rex and his troops continued to handle the droids while Cody and Wolffe's troops rescued the Hisseenian parliament.[39]\n\nSometime after the siege of Hisseen,[38] Rex accompanied Skywalker, Kenobi, Cody, and the rest of the Republic forces in their effort to liberate Christophsis from Confederate forces under General Whorm Loathsom and Count Dooku's assassin, Asajj Ventress. The captain took part in setting up an ambush on the approaching Separatist forces, but Kenobi and Cody were ambushed themselves. Skywalker rushed to his master's aid with Rex and his men alongside him. Fleeing to the rooftop, they held off the battle droids until evac arrived in the form of a LAAT/i gunship, with clone trooper Gus removing the commanding tactical droid's head before departing. Rex assisted Cody in performing a robolobotomy on the droid's head, discovering that it contained all of their intelligence. Surmising that this meant there was a spy in their midst, Skywalker and Kenobi departed to investigate the Confederate headquarters, hoping this would reveal the spy's identity. Rex and Cody were instructed to conduct their own search at the Republic base.[40]\n\nAs they were leaving the command center, Cody noticed that someone had left their comlink on; their entire conversation had just been broadcast to the Separatist spy. Rex spotted someone in the corridor, and he and Cody gave chase. However, they lost him in the busy mess hall. They now realized the spy was a clone. Unable to reach the Jedi as a result of blocked communications, Rex had R2-D2 analyze the communication history to see if anyone had sent any unauthorized transmissions. He noticed irregular wavelengths that were too low and infrequent to be detected normally, wavelengths that were coming from Sergeant Slick's barracks. They proceeded to question Slick's men, all of whom had an alibi except Chopper, who lied about collecting battle droid fingers. However, Slick slipped when he revealed that he knew the Jedi were gone, drawing the suspicion of the entire group. Slick realized he was blown and fled, evading Rex and Cody while also blowing up the nearby weapons depot as well as many of the LAAT/i gunships and AT-TE walkers.[40]\n\nFollowing a lead from Gus and Chopper, Rex and Cody ventured back to the command center. There, they noticed boot prints that trailed up towards the vents. Without a word between the two of them, Rex and Cody devised a trap; Rex pretended to leave the room, while Cody stood with his back to Slick's hiding spot as well as his blaster. Slick slid out of the vents and pointed the weapon at the back of Cody's head, but is shocked to learn that the blaster was empty, as Cody took the clip out beforehand. After a short fistfight, Rex and Cody subdued Slick, just as the Jedi returned from their fruitless trip to the Separatist headquarters. Skywalker verbally rebuked Slick for placing his brothers at risk, and Slick replied with an attack on the Jedi's enslavement of his brothers, the clones. Despite Slick scorching the entire weapons depot, Rex and Cody noted that they were able to save the heavy cannons.[40]\n\nAs Loathsom's droid army moved in on their positions, Rex and his men accompanied Skywalker as he took on the tri-droids. Soon after, Rex met Skywalker's new Padawan apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, laughing as she called Skywalker \"Skyguy.\" For laughing, he was told to show her the ropes as a commanding officer, offering her advice and valuable leadership experience. He also stated that while she may outrank him, experience outranks everything.[6]\n\nRex soon spotted the deflector shield being used by the incoming Confederate forces, rendering their cannons useless. After conferring with Kenobi, Cody, and Rex, Skywalker and Tano left to destroy the deflector shield, while Rex assisted Kenobi in holding back the droids before they could destroy the heavy cannons. As Kenobi led a charge against the droids, Rex and his men drew the droids into the buildings, making the fight more manageable for the clones. Despite this, most of Rex's unit was wiped out, and he was soon ordered to pull back his forces in order to protect the cannons. As Kenobi delayed Loathsom with a drawn-out surrender, Rex noticed the shield drop just in time and ordered the cannons to finish off the tanks, ending the battle.[6] The battle had only been the beginning of the long partnership between Rex and what would prove to be a tightly knit group of Jedi consisting of Kenobi, Tano, and Skywalker. Through this partnership, Rex would learn his opinions were valued.[22]\n\nRex, alongside Skywalker, Tano, and the rest of Torrent Company, went to Teth to rescue Jabba the Hutt's son, Rotta. They used their ascension cables to climb the cliffs to the monastery under fire from two droid battalions. Rex and his men secured the monastery. After Skywalker and Tano found Jabba's son, Separatist vulture droids attacked as two Separatist landing craft deployed more battle droids under the command of Ventress. Rex and his men retreated into the monastery.[6]\n\nRex and his men stayed behind to keep the battle droids busy. After Ventress cut the door's lock, Rex and his men fought the droids, but the droids subdued his men. Rex picked up his pistol and tried to shoot Ventress, who disarmed and Force-choked him, demanding the location of Skywalker. Rex refused, but Ventress tried to use a mind trick to make him contact Skywalker.[6] However, Rex managed to resist the mental attack[41] and, upon contacting his general, chose to break protocol by calling Skywalker by his first name, resulting in Skywalker realizing that Ventress was coming.[6]\n\nAfter the clone captain and his surviving troops were taken to the courtyard, Skywalker contacted Rex, so a battle droid came over to investigate. Rex punched the unit and took its weapon. Rex and his troops then fought the droids guarding them. As they were surrounded, help arrived from Kenobi and Cody. After destroying a spider droid with a detonator, Rex told Skywalker they could take care of themselves and that the mission came first. Rex then went with Kenobi, Yoda, and Cody to pick up Skywalker and his apprentice from Jabba's Palace on Tatooine.[6]\n\nRex later fought in the Battle of Mimban along with the Mud Jumpers of the 224th Division and his troopers in the 501st. Jedi General Laan Tik led Republic forces in the battle until he was killed. Afterward, Junior Representative Jar Jar Binks became the highest-ranking member despite having no combat experience, and the chain of command fell to him.[27]\n\nAfter the Republic fell back to their camp, Rex spoke with several of his troopers about the location of the droids' shield generator. Knowing that it was a suicide mission, Rex decided to call in an exfil shuttle to pull his men out. Rex decided to undertake the mission by himself but was followed by one of his troopers and Representative Binks. Rex then attacked and fought the battle droids for several hours until he was shot and pushed to the ground. He was saved by Representative Binks, who used Tik's lightsaber. Despite saving his life, Rex took Tik's lightsaber and gave a blaster to Binks. The two of them continued to fight the droids.[27]\n\nRex went with Cody on an inspection tour on the Nu-class transport Obex. After inspecting the tracking station at Pastil, Rex and Cody went to the Rishi Moon station. En route, Rex contacted the station. Rex noticed something odd about the trooper's reluctance to their inspection. After landing, Rex and Cody were greeted by another trooper who said that the base was fine and asked them to leave. Rex demanded to be taken to the sergeant in command after the disguised droid said \"roger roger.\" When the survivors of the station launched a droid attack flare, Rex realized that the clone trooper in front of them was actually a droid and promptly shot it in the head, much to Cody's surprise. Rex told him to relax and removed the clone trooper's helmet, revealing it to be Unit 26 , a BX-series droid commando. They then came under attack by more commando droids that cut them off from the Obex. Rex and Cody jumped off the platform as the commando droids threw detonators at them. They used their ascension cables to climb down.[8]\n\nThey met the surviving troopers, Fives, Hevy, and Echo, who at first they ordered to remove their helmets to prove they weren't droids. After removing their helmets, they came under attack by a Rishi eel, but Rex shot it in the eye. Rex marked Echo with the eel's blood and realized that they were \"shinies,\" clones that had not fought before. He wanted to show them a taste of battle and brought them back up to the platform. As they did not have the equipment to bypass the blast doors, Rex devised a plan to act as a malfunctioning droid commando; Cody believed that the plan was absurd, but Rex persuaded the droids inside to open the door. Rex, Cody, and the rest of the clones then stormed the command center, taking out the commando droids. They spotted a Confederate fleet approaching, but were unable to contact the Republic.[8]\n\nWhen a landing craft came down, Rex said they would blow up the station so that the Republic fleet would arrive to investigate. Rex rigged the gas detonators as Cody and others held up the battle droids. However, the remote detonator was not working. Rex and the others left while Hevy fixed the detonator. However, Hevy refused to leave, intending to set the gas off manually. Rex and the others tried to go back for him, but Hevy blew up the station along with himself. Rex and the others were rescued by a gunship. After Echo and Fives received medals for their bravery, Rex accepted them into the 501st Legion.[8]\n\nAfter the loss of the Falleen battle group, Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and their fleet were sent to protect Bothawui. Rex and the fleet's AT-TEs were deployed on the asteroids surrounding Bothawui. As General Grievous's fleet moved in to attack Skywalker's fleet, Rex and the AT-TE opened fire on the rear of the enemy fleet. Rex saved Skywalker when his fighter was damaged, then stayed with Ahsoka as Skywalker searched for Grievous's spy station. When Rex and Ahsoka detected Skywalker's tracking signal, they took the Twilight and rescued Skywalker from Grievous's forces.[42]\n\nRex assisted Skywalker in his search for the listening post. After receiving a message from R2, Rex, Denal, and his squad accompanied Skywalker in destroying the station in the Ruusan system. Rex also carried R3-S6 down to the station. Rex, Ahsoka, R3, and the rest of the squad were sent to destroy the station's reactors while Skywalker searched for R2. However, R3 slowed them down, leading to a confrontation between super battle droids. They subdued the droids, but Rex, Ahsoka, and the squad were then confronted by General Grievous. Rex and his squad tried to shoot, but all were killed except Rex and Denal. As Rex was about to be killed, he was saved by Ahsoka, who ordered Rex and Denal to complete their mission without her. Rex and Denal rigged the reactors and rendezvoused with Skywalker and the Twilight in the landing bay. However, Rex and Skywalker realized that R3 was a spy when he summoned super battle droids and vulture droids to attack them. Rex destroyed the reactors, and they were joined by Ahsoka and made their escape, with Skywalker rescuing R2.[43]\n\nLater during the conflict, Rex joined Skywalker, Tano, Admiral Wullf Yularen, and several other clone troopers on a mission to the planet Quell, where Jedi General Aayla Secura and her clone commander, Bly, were fighting a Separatist opposition. With Secura's cruiser damaged, the Republic forces were in a hurry. After breaking through a line of rocket super battle droids, they landed on Secura's ship, where Skywalker was injured in an explosion on the exploding ship. With fellow troopers Cameron, Flash, and Lucky, Rex, Tano, Secura, Bly, and Skywalker escaped on a transport vessel. However, they were hit and entered hyperspace. Their ship then crash-landed on the planet Maridun.[44]\n\nRex stayed behind to look after Skywalker while Secura, Bly, Ahsoka, and the other troopers went to look for help. Rex fought the mastiff phalones alongside Skywalker until Bly, Ahsoka, and the Lurmen healer Wag Too came to his aid. Rex and his fellow clones and Jedi quickly discovered that Maridun was home to a Lurmen village.[44]\n\nRex watched for any spacecraft, hoping for rescue. Rex soon spotted a Confederate landing ship coming toward the village. He informed Bly of this, and they escaped from the village before the battle droids arrived. Rex and the others planned to steal a shuttle but were spotted by a recon droid. They pursued it until Secura destroyed it. Rex and the others then watched as General Lok Durd prepared to test his weapon. Rex went with Bly to get a closer look at the weapon. Rex and Bly then ran to avoid the weapon's shock wave using their grapnel lines.[45]\n\nAfter Durd left, Rex worked with Bly and Skywalker to infiltrate Durd's base, where they stole a shuttle and shield generators. Rex and the group returned to the village, where Skywalker, Bly, and he built a wall to withstand, much to Tee Watt Kaa's disapproval. Rex and Bly activated the shield as the Defoliator fired its weapon. Rex and the others stood their ground until the droids breached the shields and destroyed it. Luckily, Rex, Bly, and the others then had help from the Lurmen, and subdued and captured Durd. As Rex was taking Durd, Republic cruisers arrived to rescue them.[45]\n\nRex accompanied Generals Kenobi and Skywalker, Pantoran Senator Riyo Chuchi, and Chairman Chi Cho to Orto Plutonia. There, they investigated Glid Station to ascertain what happened to the troopers. Rex and the Jedi went to a Confederate outpost, where they saw a hologram of a creature attack the battle droids. Rex returned to the station, where he and his troops waited for the Jedi's return. Rex and his troops then went with the Jedi, Chairman Cho, and Senator Chuchi to speak with the Talz Chief, Thi-Sen, at the Confederate base. After the meeting, Rex was charged with protecting the Chairman when he decided to attack the Talz. Rex, his troopers, Cho, and his guards were surrounded by the Talz. When Cho was mortally wounded, Rex and his men retreated, carrying the Chairman with him. Rex formed a defense line near a cliff and held out until Skywalker, Kenobi, Chuchi and the rest of the troops arrived.[28]\n\nRex was sent to Naboo to assist Skywalker and Kenobi to stop Confederate scientist Dr. Nuvo Vindi from deploying bombs laden with the Blue Shadow Virus. Rex fought alongside Commander Tano in fighting their way through Vindi's lab. They stopped Vindi's droid from unleashing the virus.[47]\n\nHowever, LEP-86C8 stole a vial and triggered one of the bombs, contaminating the labs. Though Rex and his troopers sealed the lab, they were infected with the virus. Alongside Senator Padmé Amidala and Binks, they destroyed all the droids and stopped them from unleashing it on Naboo. Skywalker and Kenobi administered a cure to them and saved them.[46]\n\nRex, along with Skywalker, Tano, and Yularen, took the Resolute and their fleet to Ryloth to break the Confederate blockade. After their failed first attack, Rex and Skywalker gave Master Windu their progress report. After telling Tano that Skywalker wished to speak with her about their next attack, he oversaw the evacuation of the Defender. Skywalker left Tano in command of the Resolute. Rex and one of the navigation officers worked with Ahsoka to plan a way to eliminate the remaining blockade forces. At first, Rex and the officer were worried that Tano's maneuver would not work but went along when Yularen agreed to it. After Skywalker destroyed the Confederate command ship, Rex, Yularen, and the navigation officer maneuvered the Resolute into the attack position. They watched as Tano and her bombers destroyed the remaining forces. Rex sent a ship to pick up Skywalker's and R2's pod as Kenobi's and Windu's forces landed.[48]\n\nRex, Cody, Kenobi, Skywalker, Tano, and their forces eventually found themselves combating the droid army on the strategic planet of Felucia. Republic forces became based in a jungle clearing, and Tano was tasked with a jungle patrol to combat the Separatist forces. As Tano led her troops against droid forces, the droid army located and surrounded the Republic position. Republic forces were soon overwhelmed, and their only hope for survival became a group of Republic gunships called to evacuate them under the command of General Plo Koon. As droid forces surrounded Rex and the others, Koon, his starfighters, and his gunships fought through the Separatist blockade.[49]\n\nThe ships were followed to the planet by vulture droids, and the destruction and crash of one of the droid starfighters alerted Rex and the others to the arrival of the gunships. The clones fired at the approaching droids as Rex and the other Republic leaders led them to the ships. Rex called for all troops to leave, and after all of the forces boarded, they went to locate Tano. Tano did not want to leave, and she said the Separatists were retreating. Skywalker argued that the droids were regrouped and about to overrun her as Rex and the others did their best to fight out the droids. Skywalker ordered her and her clones to evacuate, and as all Republic forces lifted off, the regrouped droid army decimated Tano's abandoned vehicles.[49]\n\nRex went with Skywalker and Tano to Devaron to stop the bounty hunter Cad Bane from taking the Kyber memory crystal from Master Bolla Ropal. Rex gathered three brigades to board Bane's ship. Rex approved of Skywalker's idea of using the AT-TEs to board Bane's ship. Rex, Skywalker, Tano, and their troops were successful in boarding the ship, though they did not save Master Ropal. Rex and the others found Bane on the gun deck. Rex and his men fought the battle droids while Skywalker and Tano pursued Bane. They secured a shuttle and waited for Skywalker and Tano to return. When they returned, Rex watched as \"Denal\" shot Bane.[50]\n\nAfter returning to the Resolute, one of Rex's men spotted blood. Rex told Skywalker the blood was not from one of his men. Rex and Skywalker then realized that Denal was actually Bane in disguise, but he escaped.[51]\n\nRex accompanied Skywalker, Windu, and Commander Ponds to oversee the Republic's defense of the beleaguered planet, as the Grand Army coveted its vital fuel reserves. The Supreme Chancellor Palpatine responded by authorizing the use of the electro-proton bomb, a creation of Doctor Sionver Boll that would generate an electron field capable of deactivating the entire droid army. Rex was tasked with shoring up the fortifications of the Doge's Palace—the residence of Doge Nakha Urus, the leader of the Dugs—until the bomb was detonated, and he proceeded to the front of the palace's defense lines to command the Republic troops, monitoring the massive droid army's approach with a set of electrobinoculars. Rex held the line with his men, working in tandem with squads of insectomorph-mounted Dug cavaliers to repel the droid infantry.[52]\n\nA starfighter squadron dropped the electro-proton bomb in the middle of the droid army, producing an explosion that transformed into an electromagnetic pulse. The enlarging pulse disabled all of the droids and disrupted the clone troopers' helmet systems for a short time. The bomb also destabilized the surrounding ground, and Rex nearly fell into the expanding sinkhole when he became trapped on an unstable plateau, but managed to jump to higher ground with the help of his troops. While rescue teams searched for the Republic personnel trapped in the crater, Rex joined Skywalker, Windu, Urus, R2-D2, and Doctor Boll at the Doge's Palace, where they reestablished holographic communications with Palpatine. After Windu and Urus conferred with Palpatine on the status of the Republic's fuel treaty with the Dugs' council, Rex reported that they had lost contact with the rescue team in the crater.[52]\n\nAs night fell, Rex met with Skywalker, Windu, and Boll at Urus's palace to discuss the problem of the uncontrollable Zillo Beast with Palpatine. While the Dugs wanted to kill off the Zillo Beast, the Jedi wanted to preserve the creature, as it was one of the last of its near-extinct species. Skywalker devised a plan to knock out the creature with the Republic's RX-200 Falchion-class assault tanks and then transport it off-world. The Republic forces rendered the Zillo Beast unconscious with Skywalker's strategy, Rex returned with Skywalker and Windu to the Doge's Palace, where Urus and the other Dug leaders signed the fuel treaty. Later, Palpatine ordered they bring it to Coruscant for study before its release into the wild.[52]\n\nRex returned to Coruscant with Skywalker, Windu, and Boll aboard an Acclamator-class transport. The Zillo Beast broke out of the Science and Technical Center and began to rampage across the ecumenopolis of Coruscant. As the creature headed for the Republic Executive Building, Rex joined an LAAT/i gunship force led by Kenobi and Windu that had set out to contain the beast. He contacted Skywalker through R2-D2, both of whom were with Palpatine and Padmé Amidala in the Chancellor's Suite at the Executive Building, and confirmed that he was to serve with Kenobi for the time being. Yet when Rex, Kenobi, and Windu reached the Senate Plaza with their detachment of clone troopers and stun tanks, they found that the Zillo Beast had taken hold of the H-2 executive shuttle that Palpatine, Skywalker, and Amidala had been using to flee from the Executive Building with R2-D2 and C-3PO.[53]\n\nRex, monitoring the Zillo Beast and its captives through a pair of macrobinoculars, noticed that Skywalker was cutting the shuttle in half with his lightsaber and notified Windu. Kenobi deduced that Skywalker intended to free himself and the other passengers by severing the ship in two. While the recently arrived Yoda and Aayla Secura ran interference to distract the Zillo Beast, Skywalker finished slicing the shuttle in half, freeing himself and the others from the creature's grip. Kenobi and Windu quickly used the Force to stabilize the section of the shuttle carrying Palpatine and a Senate Commando, preventing them from falling off the dome of the Executive Building. While the stun tanks targeted the Zillo Beast, the LAAT/i gunships launched with Rex, Kenobi, Windu, and their men aboard and also opened fire, though neither approach proved effective in subduing the rampant beast. Palpatine ordered the gunships to release toxic gas bombs that Boll had developed to kill the creature. The next morning, the slain Zillo Beast was transported back to the Science and Technical Center. Rex and his comrades met with Palpatine in the Senate Plaza to debrief the disaster, mourning the loss of the creature. While Rex and the others departed from the Senate Plaza aboard the gunships, Palpatine secretly gave Boll orders to clone the Zillo Beast.[53]\n\nRex fought with Skywalker, Tano, and his troops when the Republic returned to Geonosis. After Skywalker's gunship was shot down, Rex and the others continued towards Kenobi's position on foot. Rex assisted Skywalker and Tano in taking out a droid fortress blocking their path. After the fortress was destroyed, Rex, Skywalker, Mundi, Tano, and the rest of their forces rendezvoused with Kenobi and Cody.[54]\n\nRex fought alongside, Skywalker, General Luminara Unduli, and Commander Gree and their troops to distract Poggle's forces while Tano and Barriss Offee infiltrated the droid foundry. At first, they drove back the battle droids. However, Rex, Gree, and their troops were forced to fall back when Poggle sent in Super tanks to finish them off. After the foundry was destroyed, Rex brought in their tanks and gunships to search for Tano and Offee.[55] Rex then saw Tano and Offee leave to recuperate.[56]\n\nRex accompanied Skywalker, Kenobi, Unduli, and Mundi to deliver Poggle to Coruscant. Rex stayed alert when Tano and Offee failed to check in on time. Rex then contacted Tano and informed Skywalker of this.[57]\n\nRex accompanied Skywalker and Master Gallia to the Saleucami system to rescue Master Eeth Koth from General Grievous. Despite their rescuing Master Koth, Grievous escaped to the surface of Saleucami.[58] Rex went with General Kenobi and Cody to track him down.[17]\n\nRex and several of his troopers investigated the remains of Grievous's landing ship. Rex took Jesse, Hardcase, and Kix through the wetlands to find Grievous. However, Rex was shot by a commando droid sniper. He survived, but needed a bacta patch and to be left behind at a farm to recover. He discovered that the owner of the farm was a clone deserter named Cut Lawquane. At first, Rex was disgusted by Lawquane's lack of commitment to the Republic. Despite this, Rex accepted his children's invitation to dinner. Rex talked about how he would stay in the army, no matter what happened. Cut told Rex why he left the army, as his squad had been ambushed and killed off shortly after the First Battle of Geonosis; as the only survivor, he fled. During the night, Cut's children accidentally reactivated a pod of disabled commando droids, so he and Cut defended the house from them; Cut saved him from one of them. The next morning, Rex prepared to leave, stating that he did not see Cut as a coward anymore and would not report him to the Republic. While Lawquane offered Rex a chance to stay with his family, Rex declined, saying that his family was elsewhere. With this, he left to rejoin Kenobi and his other clone brothers.[17]\n\nFollowing Kenobi's investigation on Mandalore,[59] Rex, Cody, Skywalker, and several troopers were requested to protect the Duchess Satine Kryze and her entourage from the Death Watch and the Separatists aboard the Coronet.[60]\n\nRex, Cody, and their troops were briefed on the importance of protecting the Duchess. They stayed in the cargo bay. Rex saw that R2 was spooked by something and that two of his troopers were missing. Rex, alongside Skywalker, found an open container. They continued the search until Skywalker was attacked by an assassin probe. Rex and Cody took it out. However, they came under attack by SD-K4a mini-assassin droids. After defeating them, Rex and Cody continued their search, taking out the last probe killer. Rex was attacked by the last assassin probe but held off its claws before Skywalker took it out. Rex then fought off super battle droids boarding the Coronet alongside Cody, their troopers, and the Duchess' royal guards.[60]\n\nWhen the Jedi High Council chose Ahsoka Tano to teach students at the Royal Academy of Government to help break the cycle of corruption on the planet, Rex accompanied Skywalker and Tano to the planet. While the two Jedi spoke with Duchess Satine and Prime Minister Almec, Rex and another clone trooper stood by their ship. After Skywalker took Tano's lightsaber, due to a recent law passed that no offworlders could bring weapons to Mandalore, Rex approached Skywalker, and Rex informed him that it was time for them to go. Skywalker departed the planet for a meeting with Jedi Master Kit Fisto, and Tano stayed on the planet to teach her class about corruption, and when on the planet she helped uncover a conspiracy led by Almec.[61]\n\nIn an attempt to force Pantora to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems, members of the Trade Federation loyal to the Separatists, such as administrator Sib Canay, arranged the blockade of Pantora. During the debate around the blockade, Rex stood with Skywalker as he spoke with Padmé Amidala, who noted that the situation reminded her about the blockade Naboo had undergone. Suddenly, Tano ran up to the group, informing them that the daughters of Chairman Notluwiski Papanoida had been kidnapped. As Rex stood by silently, Skywalker told Tano that, due to Separatist involvement, she could technically perform a private investigation. Amidala asked if it was a good idea to go against the wishes of the Jedi Council, but Skywalker simply responded that they did it all the time.[62]\n\nWhen the planet Balith fell into a large-scale civil war, the planet requested Republic assistance. Rex and Skywalker were assigned to help the Third Legion on the planet, but Tano was to stay behind on Coruscant to give a full report on recent events. As they were departing, Tano argued that she should go with the group, but Skywalker said that she had to finish her studies. Along with another 501st trooper, Rex and Skywalker then departed for Balith on a Nu-class transport.[63]\n\nRex, Cody, and their troopers returned to his homeworld of Kamino when a message between Grievous and Ventress was discovered. Rex and Cody joined Fives, Echo, 99, and several young cadets in the barracks. Together, they fought off the battle droids, but 99 was killed. Following the battle, Rex promoted Echo and Fives to be Advanced Recon Commandos.[64]\n\nOne year and nine months after the First Battle of Geonosis,[66] when Jedi Master Even Piell was captured, Rex, appearing via hologram, Cody, Fives, Echo, Kenobi, and Skywalker attended a briefing held by Plo Koon for a mission to rescue Piell from the Citadel on Lola Sayu, where he was imprisoned by the Separatists. In order to get on the planet undetected, Skywalker had the entire rescue team, including Rex, carbon-frozen; before being frozen, Rex confided in Skywalker that he had never gone through the process before, only for Skywalker to admit it was his first time as well.[67]\n\nDespite Rex and Fives's reservations, the team was successfully frozen, surviving the process and being brought aboard Shuttle 81572. The frozen team was smuggled by R2-D2 and three reprogrammed battle droids in a stolen Separatist shuttle. This tactic fooled the life-form scanners of the blockade around the planet, and its crew and the droids landed the shuttle in a cave close to the Citadel prison. After landing, Rex and the others were unfrozen, only to discover that Tano had secretly joined the team, despite having been ordered not to. Since there was no other option, Tano came along, and the team began the mission.[67]\n\nTo get into the facility, the team had to free-climb a wall covered with electromines. This went well until clone trooper Charger stepped on a loose rock and fell straight into a mine, alerting the prison crew of the team's presence. On the way to Piell's cell, the team had to evade several booby traps, one killing another clone trooper, Longshot. The team made it to Piell's cell and destroyed the droids that were guarding Piell, with Rex taking care of the interrogator droid. On the way to rescue Piell the group was located by the Citadel's warden, Osi Sobeck, who activated a large magnet in the ceiling of the hall that pulled all the team's weapons away, as well as Skywalker, due to his cybernetic arm. The team was surrounded by droids.[67]\n\nSkywalker, being attached to the magnet, reclaimed his lightsaber and destroyed the magnet, allowing the team to reclaim their weapons and destroy the droids. Rex shot a surveillance camera, much to Sobeck's frustration, before moving along. After retrieving Piell's officers the group split into two groups while escaping the facility, as both Piell and his captain, Tarkin, knew half of the vital hyperspace coordinates, called Nexus Route. Splitting them up during the escape would make it more difficult for the Separatists to get the full information. Rex joined the group consisting of Skywalker, Tano, Tarkin, Echo, Fives, and two rescued clones. While Kenobi and the other group wreaked havoc on the upper levels, Rex and his group escaped the tower into a series of tunnels on the lower levels.[67]\n\nRex and the others made their way through tunnels fighting off the super battle droids and commando droids. He also defended Ahsoka when Tarkin questioned her experience. They met up with Kenobi's and Piell's team at the airfield. However, their shuttle was destroyed,[65] and ARC trooper Echo was believed to have been killed.[68]\n\nRex and the others headed for a rendezvous point as they were pursued by STAPs and anoobas. During their trek, one of the anoobas killed Piell, and Rex and the others gave him a brief funeral. Upon reaching the rendezvous point, they fought Commandant Sobeck and his droids until Koon arrived. Rex and the others were then taken back to Coruscant.[69]\n\nRex went with Skywalker, Tano, Koon, Wolffe, and their men to take out a resupplied Separatist outpost. With the aid of Felucian scouts, Rex and Skywalker assaulted the outpost while Tano and Koon attacked the outpost from the sides. However, Skywalker noticed that Tano had gone missing. Rex and his men searched the outpost and the surrounding area for her to no avail, with Republic forces pulling out of the area soon after.[70]\n\nRex oversaw the deployment of General Fisto's, Ahsoka's, and Commander Monnk's SCUBA troopers at Mon Cala to assist Prince Lee-Char.[71]\n\nBy the time of the Battle of Horain, Rex was equipped with Phase II clone trooper armor. Rex participated alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Battle of Horain. During the fighting, a B1-series battle droid named B1-0516 was hit by a blaster bolt that bounced off of Kenobi's lightsaber. It started to shoot other battle droids. When the battle droid revealed his name, Rex renamed him \"Bats\" because his name was a mouthful. When Rex and Kenobi returned to the Republic Evacuation Point, Bats joined the Republic.[72]\n\nRex, along with Skywalker, Fives, and the rest of the 501st were sent to Umbara to help Masters Tiin, Krell, and Kenobi take its capital, while Tano and Offee fought the space battle. After the initial landing and fighting with the Umbaran militia, Rex and the 501st were placed under the command of Krell when the Chancellor requested Skywalker return to Coruscant. As the troops were pushed hard on a long march, Krell denied them rest despite Rex's protests. When Krell ordered a full-frontal assaults on the capital, he denied Rex's request to carry out Skywalker's plan. During the first attack on the road to the capital, the clones were surrounded, and without cover, suffered heavy losses. As Rex was forced to order a retreat, Krell disdainfully ordered reinforcements and angrily confronted Rex for disobeying him. When Krell roared at Rex, Rex retorted by reminding him that he had a duty to protect the men under his command.[18]\n\nRex, Krell, and the 501st were sent to capture an airbase that was resupplying the capital. Rex was ordered to go through a gorge that would leave them exposed. Rex tried to reason with Krell to no avail. Despite the objections of Fives, Jesse, and the rest of the 501st, Rex convinced his men to carry out Krell's orders. As they made their way through the gorge, they were attacked by the Umbarans' crawler tanks, which they destroyed. They were then confronted by the Umbarans' MHCs, which had heavy armor impervious to their rocket launchers. To combat them, Rex sent Fives and Hardcase to infiltrate their base and use their own Zenuas 33 Umbaran starfighters on the MHCs. Despite Krell's orders to push the attack, Rex and his men held them off until Fives and Hardcase destroyed the MHCs. The base was taken and secured despite the heavy losses.[73]\n\nWhen Kenobi contacted them about the capital's long-range missiles being supplied by a Dual Hemisphere-Omni Support Vessel, Rex proposed that they attack the ship to cut off the supplies. However, Krell proposed attacking the capital despite the missiles, much to Rex's and Kenobi's surprise. Rex was ordered to prepare the men for the attack, despite the heavy casualties. Rex at first complied but was then told of an idea by Fives to use the starfighter codes to infiltrate and destroy the supply ship. However, Krell objected to it. Following a mishap in a hangar, Rex gave Fives, Jesse, and Hardcase permission to carry out the mission. However, he told them that if they were caught, he would not be able to protect them. Rex watched as they took off on their mission and stopped Dogma and Tup from informing Krell. Krell later confronted Rex, who told him that he authorized a reconnaissance mission to make his strategy more efficient. Rex then saw the supply ship's explosion. Rex, Fives, and Jesse were brought before Krell, where he reprimanded them. Despite Rex's objections, Krell had Fives and Jesse taken to the brig for insubordination.[74]\n\nRex spoke with Krell to convince him to spare Fives and Jesse, telling him that the men were with him despite his reckless tactics. Despite this, Krell ordered Rex and his men to execute them, but they refused to do so. Rex and Krell were then contacted by a trooper who informed them that they were ambushed by the Umbarans disguised as clones. Rex was sent to attack the Umbarans. Rex and his men, armed with mortars, went into the jungle, where they were attacked by the troopers. However, Rex examined one of the troopers and discovered they were clones. Rex ran in front of both his men and the troopers, revealing the deception. Rex then spoke with the 212th Attack Battalion platoon leader, Waxer, who revealed that it was Krell who ordered the attack before dying of his wounds.[16]\n\nRex gathered his men and the remainder of Waxer's platoon and told them that they would arrest Krell for treason. Rex and the men confronted Krell, who was surprised that he had figured it out. Krell, believing Rex and his men to be committing mutiny, refused to be arrested and ignited his lightsabers. After a short fight, Krell leapt from the tower and quickly incapacitated the force of clones that was waiting outside, fleeing into the jungle. Rex and his men pursued the Besalisk. Rex was alerted by a trooper that had located him, but Krell tore through several clones with ease, taunting Rex all the while. However, after many casualties, Krell was tricked by Tup into walking towards a vixus, giving them an opportunity to stun Krell. Rex and his men placed Krell in the brig. During his questioning, Rex learned that Krell was trying to undermine the Republic so that Dooku or his master would make him his new apprentice and rule Umbara. When news came that Kenobi and 212th had taken the capital, Rex and the others decided to execute Krell. At first, Rex hesitated but Krell was then killed by Dogma. Dogma was then taken into custody, but he and Rex shared a nod. Fives informed the Clone Captain that the last Umbaran holdouts had been defeated and the fight for Umbara was over, but Rex wondered aloud about what the point of the suffering was and what would happen to him and his brothers when the war ended.[16]\n\nTen rotations after Master Yoda's last communication with Kiros's governor, Gupat Roshti, Rex, along with Skywalker, Kenobi, Ahsoka, and their men, were sent to free Kiros from the Separatist occupation forces. Rex rode with Kenobi as his gunner on his BARC speeder. Rex finished off the last of the AATs with his rocket launcher as they approached the Separatist headquarters inside the governor's tower.[76]\n\nFollowing the capture of Commander D'Nar, Rex went with Skywalker, Kenobi, and Ahsoka to Zygerria using the Tecora. Rex, disguised as a Zygerrian guard, went with Kenobi to find the colonists. Rex spotted Governor Roshti and attempted to escape with Kenobi and Roshti, but they were captured. Rex then went to a slave auction still posing as a guard. When Skywalker whipped Kenobi, Rex saw his signal and attacked the guards. However, he and the others were captured. Rex, Kenobi, and Roshti were taken to Kadavo, to its slave-processing facility.[77]\n\nThere Rex worked in the facility's mines alongside Kenobi and the Togrutas as a slave. He and Kenobi were then brought before Keeper Agruss, who was ordered by Count Dooku to execute them. However, Rex and Kenobi freed themselves when Skywalker, Tano, and Plo Koon came to free the slaves. When Agruss tried to escape and taunted Kenobi for not being able to bring himself to kill a defenseless person, Rex threw Agruss' electrostaff at him, impaling the slaver and killing him. Rex and Kenobi then made their way to a gunship and left the facility before it was destroyed.[75]\n\nFollowing the battle, Rex was assigned by Skywalker to guard the Supreme Chancellor against bounty hunter Moralo Eval's kidnapping plot. He covered for Skywalker and Tano when they went after Eval, Bane, and Rako Hardeen.[78]\n\nRex went with Kenobi, Skywalker, and Tano to Onderon to help train its rebels in fighting the Confederacy's occupation forces. Rex taught Onderon rebels on how to use weapons such as the droid poppers against the battle droids and how to use teamwork to take down Separatist tanks.[79] Rex then left with Skywalker and Kenobi to report on the rebels' progress against the Confederate forces in Iziz while Tano stayed behind to act as an advisor.[80]\n\nRex was with Skywalker and Tano when they defended Cato Neimoidia from the Confederacy.[82] Rex then returned to Coruscant, where he worked with Skywalker to prove Tano's innocence in the Jedi Temple bombing and Letta Turmond's murder. He went with him to the military base, where Commander Fox told him that Tano killed several clones. Rex, Skywalker, and Fox searched for her. Rex followed Skywalker to a tunnel, where they witnessed Tano escaping from them.[81] Rex assisted Skywalker, Koon, Commander Wolffe, and a team of shock troopers in searching for Tano.[83] Tano was ultimately proven innocent, but she left the Jedi Order.[84]\n\nAt some point following Tano's departure from the Jedi Order,[86] Rex went with Skywalker to Ringo Vinda to take its space station back from the Confederate forces under Admiral Trench. During the battle, Tup fired upon and killed Jedi General Tiplar. In the chaos, the 501st were forced to retreat. While Tup appeared to be unaware of his actions, he continued to display strange behavior and lash out violently towards Jedi. Both Jedi and clone leadership determined that Tup should be sent to Kamino for further evaluation. However, in the process, Tup was temporarily captured by Separatist forces on his departure from the station. Together Fives, Rex, and Anakin Skywalker retrieved a still-unconscious Tup before Trench's droids could abscond with him. Concerned for his friend's safety, Fives requested that he accompany the troubled clone to Kamino. Although Rex was required on the front lines, he allowed Fives to stay on Kamino, telling him to take care of Tup and himself.[87]\n\nBy the time the 501st had returned to Coruscant, Fives had been named a fugitive, having been accused of attempting to assassinate the Chancellor. Through Kix, he gave Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex coordinates to rendezvous with Fives so that the three of them could speak privately.[85]\n\nTo Fives' surprise, both Skywalker and Rex appeared at his requested meeting spot. Fearing that neither of his superiors would listen to his version of events, Fives requested that Skywalker and Rex go unarmed themselves and then trapped both in a ray shield. Agitated by his experience and prior drugging by conspiring Kaminoans, Fives struggled to explain his actions and his discoveries. Fives stated that artificially designed organic chips were planted into clones during the early stages of their development as sanctioned by the Chancellor and that, when activated, these chips compelled clones to strictly follow orders without question. When Skywalker too accused Fives of trying to assassinate the Chancellor, tension escalated.[85]\n\nMidway through the conversation, Commander Fox and a squad of Coruscant guards arrived to arrest Fives, on direct orders from Palpatine. Desperate not to be captured, a terrified Fives reached for one of Rex's discarded blasters, prompting Fox to shoot him through the heart. Fives spent his final moments in the arms of Rex where he spoke his last words, reciting Tup's, having finally found peace. A distressed Rex then mourned over the body of his close friend.[85] Though he was skeptical of Fives' warning, Rex felt he owed it to Fives to submit a grievance report on the chips. Even as he was recording it, Rex knew the report would be ignored. The report was classified and encrypted in the Republic archives.[88]\n\nRex participated in the Battle of Scipio, a battle in response to the Separatist invasion of the InterGalactic Banking Clan planet of Scipio, which had been considered a neutral world. While General Anakin Skywalker and other members of the 501st Legion made their initial descent on the planet, Skywalker requested that Rex determine the location of Senator Padmé Amidala, who was on Scipio due to the exchange of power in the banks from the corrupt leaders to Rush Clovis. Rex said he could not pinpoint her exact location, but that the initial scan indicated she was still alive. Upon reaching the planet's surface, Skywalker ordered Rex to hold the line as he searched for Amidala. Rex, along with the rest of the 501st, successfully held their position and regained control of the planet from the Separatist forces.[89]\n\nIn the final years of the Clone Wars, Rex joined fellow troopers, including Cody and Jesse, to a mission to prove the redemption of the Jedi Master Quinlan Vos. Once the clones began to unload equipment, it was discovered that the asteroid they were on was about to explode. Quickly, the Jedi and clones escaped the asteroid, thanks to Vos. However, the Jedi was simply fooling all of them and was still an agent of Count Dooku.[90]\n\nAfter the Separatist Admiral Trench made advances against Republic forces during the Battle of Anaxes, Rex theorized that the Separatists had captured his comrade Echo, who was presumed dead, and that the Separatists were combating his strategies through him. Rex and Commander Cody joined forces with an elite squad called Clone Force 99 (known as the \"Bad Batch\"); which consisted of Sergeant Hunter, the giant demolitions expert Wrecker, the sniper Crosshair, and the equipment specialist Tech. The clones raided a Separatist Cyber Center on Anaxes and discovered that it was receiving an audio signal from Skako Minor that was beeping Echo's clone trooper number. This confirmed Rex's suspicions that Echo might still be alive.[91]\n\nArmed with this information, Rex traveled to Skako Minor with Clone Force 99 and Anakin Skywalker on the Marauder. Before going, however, Skywalker spoke with his wife, Padmé Amidala, and had Rex stand by to make sure no one knew. Although General Kenobi asked where Skywalker was, Rex tried to lie about what his General was doing. After Skywalker was done speaking with her, he and Rex left for Skako with the Bad Batch. After landing, Skywalker was kidnapped by a large flying reptile called a keeradak which deposited him in a Poletec village. Rex and the Bad Batch traveled to the Poletec village where they made peace with the villagers and convinced them to release Skywalker. With the aid of Poletec scouts, the clones and Skywalker traveled to the Techno Union city of Purkoll. During the journey, the clone troopers traced Echo's signal. When Crosshair disdainfully said that Echo was \"just another reg,\" Rex attacked the commando. Anakin broke up the fight and dismissed the others to counsel Rex alone, saying that he had to face the reality that Echo may be dead. Rex told his general that he tried never to dwell on the death on a friend and brother, but that he was certain that he had heard Echo.[68]\n\nThe clones traced Echo's signal to a tower and infiltrated it. Inside, they received a hologram message from the Techno Union leader Wat Tambor, who announced that he had used the algorithm to lure them into a trap. When Tambor charged them with violating the Techno Union's neutrality, Rex responded that Tambor had already breached the Union's neutrality by bringing a Republic prisoner to Skako Minor. Tambor sent several D1-series aerial battle droids to attack them, but the clones and Skywalker defeated them. Rex and Tech forced their way inside a stasis chamber and found Echo. Echo was alive, but many of his body parts had been replaced with prosthetics, and he was kept in an induced coma.[68]\n\nRex and Tech freed Echo from the chamber after some difficulty. However, the clones and Skywalker were surrounded by Techno Union forces and unable to call for help since they were on an unsanctioned mission. When Tambor dispatched a Decimator to destroy the intruders, Rex, the other clones, and Skywalker fled through an exhaust pipe. Wrecker then planted several detonators which destroyed the Decimator and the chamber. While crossing a pipe, the clones and Skywalker escaped on four-winged Keeradaks and returned to the Poletec village.[92]\n\nAt the village, the clones, Skywalker, and the Poletec villagers joined forces to destroy several D-wing droids and octuptarra tri-droids that Tambor had dispatched after them. During the battle, Rex disabled one octuptarra by firing into its eye sensor. Following the battle, Echo thanked Rex for returning for him, but Rex simply stated that it was what brothers did and apologized for the time it took. Rex also expressed his hope that things would be just like their old times together. The clones and Skywalker then headed back to Anaxes.[92]\n\nAfter returning to Anaxes, Echo devised a plan which involved infiltrating Admiral Trench's dreadnought and feeding the Separatist systems with false information in order to secure a Republic victory on Anaxes. Rex, Echo, Skywalker, and Force 99 infiltrated Trench's warship using the Marauder while Republic forces under Jedi Generals Windu and Kenobi attacked the Separatist assembly plant. The clones and Skywalker infiltrated the dreadnought's interface unit and fed false information to Admiral Trench. Echo brought all Separatist forces to the assembly plant and then used a feedback pulse to shut them down.[93]\n\nWhen Admiral Trench realized the deception, he activated a time bomb in the factory's fusion generator. Rex and his fellow clones fought their way through several battle droids and returned to the Marauder. Meanwhile, Skywalker killed Admiral Trench while Mace Windu used the Force to deactivate the bomb with the help of information supplied by Echo. Rex, his fellow clones, and Skywalker then fled Trench's dreadnought before Wrecker detonated it. At Fort Anaxes, Rex supported Echo's decision to join the Bad Batch and forfeit the medals which had been prepared for them and Echo, with his new squad-mates, saluted the Clone Captain.[93]\n\nNear the end of the Clone Wars, the 212th Attack Battalion and the 501st Legion, led by Jedi Generals Kenobi and Skywalker, fought in a battle on the planet of Yerbana, with the two battalions fighting on different fronts. Rex, along with Anakin and the 501st, had won their battle and came to help the 212th overcome Separatist forces blockading a city. While Anakin went to talk to Obi-Wan, Rex and the 501st hanged under the bridge they were fighting on. When Skywalker distracted the tactical droid who commanded the enemy forces, R2-D2 warned Rex that it was almost time for them to attack. Rex led the 501st in a surprise attack once the droid was destroyed, using jetpacks to fly out from under the bridge and decimating the droid blockade.[94]\n\nBy that time, the former Sith Lord Maul had taken control of Mandalore with the help of the Death Watch and his Shadow Collective, a syndicate of crime organizations that swore allegiance to Maul.[95][96]\n\nAfter the battle of Yerbana, Ahsoka Tano came into contact with the Jedi Order and, along with Bo-Katan Kryze, requested the help of the Jedi in retaking the planet. While she was there, Rex showed her the 332nd Company, a unit of clones in a new division that Ahsoka would command. They had all wore painted helmets with a stylized version of Tano's facial markings. Rex commented that the painting was \"crude\", but that it got the point across, and although Ahsoka said that he did not have to call her Commander, he chose to ignore that.[94] Skywalker and Kenobi traveled to Mandalore, but were forced to return to Coruscant since Chancellor Palpatine had been kidnapped by General Grievous.[97][98]\n\nSkywalker left Rex, who had been promoted to Commander, and the 332nd on Mandalore to aid in the capture of Maul. Upon arriving on the planet, Rex received a message from Prime Minister Almec, who attempted to stop the invasion, though Bo-Katan was not fooled, stating that his time had come. Soon after, they were attacked by Mandalorian super commandos, which forced everyone on the ship to leave on jetpacks. Rex apologized for not thinking of bringing Ahsoka one, but she dismissed the need of one and challenged the Commander to a race to the surface, jumping off the ship as Rex laughed. Despite having a jetpack, he still arrived second. Tano simply said she beat him, while he retorted that some things didn't change.[94]\n\nMaul led Tano into a trap, thinking she was Skywalker or Kenobi.[94] Tano activated a beacon, allowing Rex and his men to trace her signal and free her from Maul and his Mandalorian super commandos. Maul and his followers escaped the scene, however, and lost the clones in the sewers.[99]\n\nRex continued to oversee the 501st troopers and comforted Jesse after he was captured and mind-probed by Maul. The battle eventually wound down to a Republic victory. Rex and his men brought Gar Saxon and the remaining super commandos into custody, and Tano successfully captured Maul after defeating him in a duel.[99] After the siege, Maul was brought on board the Venator-class Star Destroyer[88] Tribunal.[5]\n\nOn the way back to Coruscant to deliver Maul into custody, Rex and Ahsoka met at the bridge of the Star Destroyer and watched as it entered hyperspace. Noticing she seemed thoughtful, Rex asked if something was on her mind. Ahsoka was distraught that while the Jedi were meant to be keepers of the peace, yet the war had turned them into soldiers, including her. Rex agreed—but reminded her that without the war, the clones would not exist. Ahsoka replied that perhaps the war had brought some good, such as the friendship between them. Both of them then saluted each other. Right then, an officer called Rex away to listen to the latest briefing. Rex tried to make Tano join him, but she denied the offer.[88]\n\nAt that moment, via hologram, Darth Sidious ordered all clone troopers to execute Order 66[88] and gave Rex special orders to execute Tano despite her no longer being a Jedi, which Rex agreed to do.[100]Ahsoka came into the room then, feeling through the Force that something terrible had happened to Anakin. Rex, trembling, dropped his helmet, and to the Togruta's confusion, two other clones present aimed their blasters at her, prompting Rex to order them to stand down, stating that he'll execute her. However, at that moment he remembered what Fives had been trying to tell him about the inhibitor chips and he was briefly able fight his programming, and telling her to \"find him,\" but inevitably succumbed and shot at Ahsoka. Ahsoka defended herself against Rex and the other present clones before escaping. Rex ordered the clones to hunt down Ahsoka, the captive Maul, and any who opposed the clones. Ahsoka had a plan, however, and she eventually stunned Rex into unconsciousness with the help of some astromech droids—one of which was Tano's astromech that had served alongside her on many occasions in the duration of the Clone Wars.[88]\n\nAfter sneaking herself and Rex's unconscious body into the Venator's medical bay, Ahsoka engineered a defense against the closed bay door with the droids and located Rex's inhibitor chip in his brain using the Force. Ahsoka ordered the droids to surgically remove the chip while she prepared for the imminent door breach. When the clones finally breached through the door, Ahsoka was nearly overwhelmed by the blaster fire. However, Rex's operation completed just in time for him to regain his true consciousness and shoot down a few threatening clones. Rex apologized to Ahsoka for nearly killing her, and As Ahsoka asked him, how widespread the inhibitor chips were, Rex crushingly admitted they were in every single clone; thus, the entire Grand Army of the Republic had turned against the Jedi Knights.[88] Rex and Ahsoka fought their way through the Star Destroyer, stunning the brainwashed clones along the way. Maul, on the other hand, advanced towards the ship's hyperdrive core, where he killed all the clones stationed inside. Using the Force to tear it apart, Maul destroyed the hyperdrive mid-jump and crippled the Star Destroyer beyond repair, killing many troopers sent to engage the renegade Sith Lord. The damage caused the Venator to lose lateral controls and to plummet towards the surface of a moon, being ensnared within the moon's gravitational pull and quickly descending while tearing apart.[100]\n\nRex and Ahsoka made their way to the hangar bay controls and opened the main hangar doors, where they found they were awaited by a large force of clone troopers led by the ARC trooper Jesse. Ahsoka told Rex to not kill the clones, prompting him to reply that the clones wouldn't care and wouldn't hesitate to execute them. After a pause, Ahsoka removed Rex's helmet revealing that the clone has begun to cry, devastated with the current dilemma. Ahsoka comforted the clone, while revealing her plan, which as to try to bargain that since she was no longer a Jedi, Order 66 did not apply to her. This plan failed however, with Jesse announcing that Rex shall be demoted and then executed along with Tano, causing Rex to quip that he never much cared for being a commander. With the help of the astromech droids, they avoided the clones and made their way towards a Nu-class shuttle until Maul, escaping from the doomed ship, commandeered the shuttle and used it to escape the Destroyer. Meanwhile, Rex, piloting a Republic Y-wing bomber, which he took from the maintenance bay, exited the doomed Star Destroyer and saved Tano, who was plummeting towards the moon's surface.[100]\n\nCrashing onto the surface of the moon, the Star Destroyer was destroyed along with all personnel aboard the starship. Rex, salvaging parts of the Star Destroyer, prepared to depart the moon. He watched as Ahsoka dropped her lightsabers on the ground in front of the field of the clone trooper helmets belonging to the fallen, to make it look like they too had perished in the crash.[97][100] Imperial reports would note that Rex had been killed in action.[101]\n\nAs they had dug the graves, Rex and Tano agreed to part ways, but both informed the other they would head into the chaos of the Outer Rim Territories.[97] However, they first traveled to Naboo, where Senator Padme Amidala's funeral was being held. Rex remained with the Y-wing while Tano infiltrated Theed and attended the funeral incognito. She managed to avoid discovery and returned to Rex without incident, after which they departed the planet.[102]\n\nAfter parting ways with his former Commander, Rex was able to keep a low profile due to Imperial records listing him as having been killed in action[9] even though Tano was presumed to have survived.[103] Rex returned to Saleucami to meet with his old friend Cut Lawquane and his family. He informed them about Order 66 and the inhibitor chips before moving on, not revealing where he was going. Clone Force 99 arrived at the Lawquane farmstead the following day, where Cut informed them of his appearance and statements, information that was of great importance particularly to Rex's old comrade Echo.[104] Deciding to fight for what remained of the Republic[9] and to help his clone siblings,[105] Rex made it his mission to strike against the Empire[106] and help his fellow clones where he could,[105] forming his own resistance[106] and clone-help network, the Clone Underground.[107]\n\nHe recruited Trace and Rafa Martez[108]—two sisters whom Tano had befriended prior to the Siege of Mandalore[109]—to his new movement, and the rebuilt R7-A7 came into the sister's possession as well. Understanding that the data collected by a Separatist tactical droid would be useful against Imperial tactics, Rex tasked the Martez sisters and R7 with retrieving the head of a T-series unit in a decommissioning facility on Corellia. Upon infiltrating the facility, the Martez sisters met the members of the Bad Batch,[108] who had remained mostly unaffected by Order 66[14] and had begun to perform mercenary work for the Trandoshan Ciddarin Scaleback. Although the droid head was destroyed in the skirmish, Hunter gifted the sisters a copy of its data before parting ways. Contacting Rex once they were in space, the sisters informed him via hologram that their mission was a success and that they knew the location of a rogue clone squad.[108]\n\nNotified by the sisters that Clone Force 99 was on Ord Mantell, Rex traveled there to find the Bad Batch, wearing a large cloak to disguise himself. He quickly discovered the Bad Batch at Cid's Parlor. After a quick reunion, including seeing Rex earn a big hug from Wrecker, meeting the group's newest member Omega, and reuniting once again with his old comrade Echo, Rex explained what he had been up to over drinks. However, the mood turned dark when Rex realized that the group had not had their inhibitor chips removed. Rex became very alarmed and reached for his blaster, but he was eventually talked down by Hunter. Rex warned them about the dangers of the inhibitor chips and convinced the group to meet with him on Bracca so they could be removed.[9]\n\nOn Bracca, Rex led them to the inside of a Star Destroyer that was being scrapped. Avoiding Scrapper Guild patrols, they made their way inside and Tech began to scan the group to locate their chips and have them removed in a similar manner as to how Ahsoka had helped Rex remove his. However, as Tech prepped Wrecker to be the first to go, since he had been having recurring headaches due to his chip, Wrecker's chip activated and he grabbed Tech by the throat. Throwing his companion into a wall, he then set upon the others. Rex, Echo, and Hunter led him out of the room so Wrecker did not damage the equipment. They set a trap for him, with Rex springing out of a hallway to stun Wrecker, but he incidentally hit Echo when Wrecker tossed his fellow trooper at him. Rex was downed, but he eventually rose and pursued Wrecker, stunning the larger clone as he had cornered Omega.[9]\n\nAfter Wrecker was subdued, the group performed the extraction. Rex and the others waited for Wrecker to wake up to see if they had been successful, and when they found Wrecker alive and well, they set to work removing the rest of the group's chips. Rex left to go outside and communicate to someone on his comlink. He was soon joined by Hunter, and Rex told the clone that his squad would be welcome to keep fighting for the Republic as he was. Hunter told Rex that the Republic was gone and that he needed to do what was best for his squad, and when Rex asked what that was, he nodded understandingly when Hunter replied that he was still unsure of what that was. Rex departed then, telling Hunter to say goodbye to the boys for him and contact him when they figured themselves out. As Rex began walking away, Hunter told him that if he was ever in trouble, that they would be there for him, and Rex gratefully nodded before departing.[9]\n\nAlthough Hunter felt that the Bad Batch was on a different path compared to Rex, Echo believed the squad should have left with his old friend, knowing it would mean they would not need to work for Scaleback and that it would let them be soldiers.[110]\n\nSometime later, while Rex was on a mission of his own, he received a distress signal from his old friend Gregor; the clone commando had tried to desert from the Empire while training the first generation of the Stormtrooper Corps on the world of Daro, yet he had been captured after planting the distress signal. Unable to go after Gregor himself, Rex instead contacted the Bad Batch as they traveled through hyperspace on a mission for Scaleback. After asking the commandos to liberate his friend but realizing he needed to cut his transmission short, Rex sent them Gregor's signal and ended his call.[35]\n\nIn the ensuing debate amongst the Bad Batch, Echo remained steadfast in his devotion to help his former captain, understanding that Rex would only contact them if it was important. Although it meant they may not get paid by Scaleback for their current mission, the squad ultimately decided to travel to Daro, where Echo, Tech, and Hunter departed from the Marauder. After analyzing the Imperial base they needed to break into, Hunter realized that the odds were against them, making him consider leaving and telling Rex that the mission was not possible. However, Echo implored Hunter and Tech to continue the mission, remembering their mission to Skako Minor to rescue him. Convinced, the three broke into the facility and rescued Gregor, who trusted them upon learning Rex had sent them, but Hunter was ultimately left behind and captured by the Empire.[35]\n\nLeaving[111] the injured[35] Gregor on Ord Mantell with Scaleback, the Bad Batch traveled to Kamino to rescue Hunter, ultimately learning he was being held by Crosshair in the Tipoca City Training Facility. Ordering Omega to stay behind with droid AZI-345211896246498721347, Echo instructed her to return to the Marauder and contact Rex if they sent her a warning signal. Upon receiving the signal, she instead decided to activate training droids, which freed the Bad Batch and allowed them to capture Crosshair.[111] Meanwhile, Ahsoka had moved to the world of Thabeska before moving to the small farming moon Raada around a year later. On Raada, she sometimes thought about Rex.[97]\n\nWhen Rex was contacted by the clone trooper Slip, who sought to escape Imperial service and get offworld, he returned to Coruscant to help his brother. However, when he arrived at their agreed-upon rendezvous, he heard blasterfire and ran to investigate, finding Senator Riyo Chuchi being pursued by an assailant. Rex stunned the attacker and helped up Senator Chuchi, who recognized him[105] from their time together during the Clone Wars.[28] When Rex removed the attacker's helmet, he saw the face of a clone. Together, they decided to question the individual, with Rex bringing them to a repair shop that belonged to his associates, namely Trace and Rafa Martez. Rex questioned the trooper, but he used a suicide shocker to kill himself rather than reveal any information.[105]\n\nSenator Chuchi explained to him that Slip had been caught up in a conspiracy regarding the destruction of Tipoca City and the subsequent cover-up by Vice Admiral Rampart. She also described the context of the incident, namely that the Imperial Defense Recruitment Bill that would see the decommissioning of all clones without pensions or any form of compensation. In response, Rex contacted the Bad Batch to help them acquire evidence to use in the Imperial Senate to charge Rampart. Having learned from Slip that such proof could be located in the bridge Rampart's Star Destroyer, Chuchi told Rex of this and when the Bad Batch arrived, Rex led them on an infiltration mission while Omega joined Chuchi in the Senate building.[112]\n\nRex led the Bad Batch into the Imperial shipyard where Rampart's ship was docked by accessing a maintenance tunnel that found them near the ship. During their journey, Rex told Echo about how more and more of their brothers were waking up to the Empire's treatment of them and needed help, something he was trying to provide them. After sneaking onboard the ship, Tech rerouted power to the bridge so they could access the data, although this triggered a security alarm. Rex and the other clones fought off the clone stormtroopers advancing on them and eventually escaped the ship by crashing it and using an escape pod to the maintenance tunnel. They then piloted a landspeeder to Omega and one of Chuchi's guards, who relayed the data to Senator Bail Organa, who presented it in the Senate. Rampart was subsequently arrested, although the Defense Recruitment Bill would pass following a statement by Emperor Palpatine. Back at the repair shop, Rex lamented that Palpatine was always steps ahead of them making the outcome of the situation unchanged. Senator Chuchi declared that she will continue to fight for clones as their representative in the senate before the Bad Batch departed without Echo who declared his intentions to join Rex in his quest to aid their clone brothers across the galaxy.[112]\n\nEventually, Rex met with Commander Wolffe, the former commander of Wolfpack, and Gregor, and the trio began living in a modified AT-TE on the desert planet of Seelos.[7]\n\nSeveral years prior to the Battle of Yavin, Tano tried to contact Rex, but her transmissions had gone unanswered since Wolffe had hidden their existence from Rex, fearing that the Empire would come for them if they were found colluding with a former Jedi. When Rex was unresponsive, Tano sent a group of rebels that included the Great Jedi Purge survivor Kanan Jarrus and his apprentice Ezra Bridger to find Rex and obtain information from him on abandoned bases that the growing rebellion could use in their struggle against the Empire.[7]\n\nRex and his comrades' first encounter with the Ghost rebels almost ended in violence when Kanan thought the clone troopers were a threat and ignited his lightsaber. Rex's timely intervention broke up the fight between his comrades and Kanan. When Kanan's apprentice Ezra mentioned that he and his rebel companions had been sent by Ahsoka, Rex quickly realized that the rebels were friends and introduced himself and his companions. While meeting with the rebels inside the walker, Ezra tried to convince Rex and his companions to join the fight against the Empire. Rex laughed and declined, saying that his days as a soldier were over. After discussions with Kanan, Rex agreed to create a list of bases that the rebels could use but invited the four rebels to participate in a hunt for joopas as payment for supplying them with this information.[7]\n\nTo allay Kanan's distrust of clone troopers, Rex revealed that he, Gregor, and Wolffe had managed to remove their control chips. The rebels reluctantly participated in the joopa hunt with the Lasat Garazeb Orrelios acting as both the \"hunter\" and the \"bait.\" Zeb was swallowed by the joopa but succeeded in killing the creature. Having completed their side of the deal, Kanan wanted his rebel companions to leave but Rex invited them to stay for dinner. While dining, the Mandalorian teenager Sabine Wren discovered that Wolffe had secretly alerted the Empire to their presence and hid the messages that Ahsoka had sent them.[7]\n\nWolffe, who distrusted the Jedi, had informed the Empire in the mistaken belief that he was protecting himself and his fellow clones. Rex was shocked by this revelation and confronted Wolffe. He convinced Wolffe that the rebels were their friends and that the Empire was their enemy. Shortly thereafter, the clones and rebels were visited by an Imperial probe droid which damaged their auxiliary ship, the Phantom; preventing them from rendezvousing with their fellow crew aboard the Ghost, which was waiting in space. After destroying the probe droid, Rex and his companions prepared for the arrival of the Empire.[7]\n\nDespite Ezra's efforts to encourage Rex and his companions to join the Rebellion, Rex was adamant that the clones would stay behind to hold back the Empire while the rebels escaped on the Phantom. A force of AT-AT walkers led by the Imperial Security Bureau agent Alexsandr Kallus, a perennial foe of the Ghost crew, landed on Seelos. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, Rex and his fellow clones stood their ground. At the urging of Ezra, the rebels intervened in the fight and defeated the Imperials. Without air support, Kallus and his surviving AT-AT pilots were forced to retreat into the desert. Honored that Kanan and Ezra would return to save them, Rex and his comrades saluted the Jedi and agreed to join the Rebellion.[11] Meanwhile, Gregor and Wolffe stayed behind and turned the remaining AT-AT into their new home.[114]\n\nHera then arrived with the Ghost to pick them up. Later, the rebels returned to meet Ahsoka and revealed that Rex had joined them. Rex proudly strode forward, and Tano smiled as she walked up to him. Rex playfully joked that she had gotten old, and after Tano smiled that it had to happen sometime, she embraced her old friend. Rex returned the hug warmly.[11]\n\nAfter joining the Rebellion, Rex became part of the Phoenix rebel cell, which operated a fleet in space.[115] At some point after joining the rebels, Rex piloted a TIE fighter[116] that had been captured by the Spectres sometime prior. The fighter had been repainted by Wren[117] and was used by Rex in combat, firing its cannons.[116] During one of Ezra's levitation lessons, Rex exposed Sabine and Chopper's trick that involved locking the astromech droid Chopper's feet to the floor, preventing Ezra from levitating him. When Ezra was upset about the trick, Rex told the young Padawan about how a Jedi General he had once fought alongside became a great warrior by combining the Force with his wits. In response, Kanan told Rex that the boy had a lot of wits but needed more discipline.[115]\n\nWhile Rex and Kanan argued about how to train Ezra, the young Padawan sneaked away with Sabine, Chopper, and Zeb on a mission to salvage supplies from an Old Republic medical base. Rex had provided the rebels with the codes to this station. Unknown to the rebels, two Inquisitors known as the Seventh Sister and the Fifth Brother were waiting for them. The rebels barely escaped with their lives. Rex was present with Kanan and Hera when the younger rebels returned with news that the Empire had more Inquisitors.[115]\n\nLater, Rex oversaw target practice with Ezra, who was using a DC-15A blaster carbine to try and hit a stormtrooper helmet that Chopper was moving around. Kanan came out, sternly reminding Ezra about his Jedi training, which sparked a minor debate between Rex and Kanan until Sabine informed them that Hera had called for a mandatory group meeting. The rebels then participated in a mission to scour Garel City for power generators and Fuel Cells to alleviate an energy crisis on the planet Rinn.[15]\n\nAn opportunity for Rex to resolve his differences with Kanan Jarrus arose after Ezra Bridger and Commander Jun Sato's CR90 corvette Liberator were captured by an Imperial Interdictor during a mission to the Del Zennis system. Prior to their capture, Sato had warned the other rebels that the Empire had a new warship capable of pulling ships out of hyperspace. Under the orders of Phoenix Leader Hera, Rex along with Kanan and Chopper were to infiltrate the Imperial warship and rescue Bridger and Sato. For this mission, Rex and Kanan were to disguise themselves as stormtroopers while Chopper was painted black to mimic an Imperial communications droid.[118]\n\nWhen Kanan expressed unease about working with Rex, he reassured him that he knew which side he was on. After Zeb brought two captured sets of stormtrooper armor, Rex complained that the new armor was junk compared to the armor he had worn during the Clone Wars. For their mission, Rex, Kanan, and Chopper used a stolen Sentinel-class landing craft to travel to the Del Zennis system, which they learned had been classified by the Imperial authorities as a restricted testing area. While traveling through hyperspace, the two men argued about their mission. While Kanan wanted to find their people and get them out of Imperial custody, Rex insisted on disabling the new ship as well since it could pose a threat to the Rebellion.[118]\n\nUpon approaching the Imperial Interdictor, Rex conned the Imperial scanners by telling them that his shuttle was having engine problems. Using emergency protocols he and Commander Cody had invented, they gained permission to dock in the Imperial Interdictor. After landing, Kanan used a Jedi mind trick to convince the stormtroopers guard in the hangar to let them through. Accessing a terminal, they learned through Chopper that Ezra was being transferred to a secure cell; meaning that the Empire had learned his identity. Disguised as stormtroopers, the three rebels made their way to Ezra's cell only to discover that the young Jedi had already broken free and locked his captors in his holding cell.[118]\n\nMistaking Rex and Kanan for stormtroopers, Ezra stunned them with his lightsaber-blaster. When Rex and Kanan recovered, Ezra tried to save face by claiming that they had been involved in a big firefight. Chopper, however, played a holographic recording of what actually happened. While Kanan was furious, Rex laughed it off and suggested that Ezra should have set his blaster to kill in case it was not them. When Rex and Kanan broke into an argument about whether to limit their mission to rescuing their rebel comrades or destroying the ship as well, an irritated Ezra broke off and accompanied Chopper on a mission to sabotage the Imperial Interdictor's gravity well projectors.[118]\n\nDisguised as stormtroopers, Rex and Kanan continued their mission to rescue their rebel comrades. When they stumbled on a stormtrooper patrol, Rex advised caution but Kanan decided to attack them. During the firefight, Rex complained that he could not see through his stormtrooper helmet and threw it at one of his opponents, knocking him out. After braving heavy fire, Rex and Kanan finally reached the detention cell holding Commander Sato and his crew. They decided to make their way back to Commander Sato's CR90 corvette Liberator. On the way, they were attacked by more stormtroopers. Rex decided to buy his rebel comrades more time by holding off their pursuers and locking the blast doors.[118]\n\nRex took on the remaining stormtroopers in single-hand combat only to be stunned. Captured, Rex was brought before the Interdictor's commanding officer, Admiral Brom Titus. Recognizing Rex based on his code number, Titus tried to win Rex over by offering him immunity and reinstatement at an Imperial Academy if he would convince his compatriots to surrender. However, Rex rejected Titus' terms and the Admiral ordered an interrogator droid to torture him to death while two stormtroopers pinned him down over a round portal. Meanwhile, the other rebels reached Sato's corvette safely. After hearing Rex being tortured through the Force, Kanan decided to rescue Rex.[118]\n\nBefore Admiral Titus could finish Rex off, Kanan entered the command bridge disguised as a stormtrooper and opened fire on Titus' men. After freeing Rex, the two men escaped on an escape pod and boarded Commander Sato's corvette. They attempted to flee into hyperspace but were again pulled out by the Imperial Interdictor. However, Chopper had rigged the Interdictor's gravity well projectors to draw in everything nearby including two escort light cruisers. These light cruisers crashed into the Interdictor; destroying it in a fiery explosion. Rex and the other rebels escaped into hyperspace in the nick of time. Following their escape, Commander Sato praised Rex, Kanan, and Ezra for rescuing him and his crew. Rex also thanked Kanan, who had finally overcome his animosity towards clone troopers. As a gesture of reconciliation, the two men saluted each other before they parted company.[118]\n\nDue to an accidental leak by Ezra Bridger on Takobo, the Seventh Sister and the Fifth Brother learned that the Phoenix rebel cell was hiding on Garel. The two Inquisitors informed their Imperial colleagues Agent Kallus and Admiral Kassius Konstantine, who sent an Imperial fleet from Lothal to attack Garel City. During the escape, Rex was with Commander Sato when their CR90 corvette was caught in the tractor beam of the Imperial Star Destroyer Relentless, Konstantine's ship. However, Phoenix Leader Hera freed Rex and Sato by using the Ghost to ram into the Star Destroyer's tractor beam projector. This enabled the remaining Phoenix rebel ships to escape into hyperspace.[119]\n\nRex was present during a meeting with Commander Sato and the crew of the Ghost to discuss the establishment of a new hyperspace route to the Lothal sector. With the Empire hunting them down throughout the Outer Rim, the rebels were in need of a new hyperspace route that would allow them to bypass Imperial forces. During the meeting, Sabine suggested that the rebels try penetrating the Concord Dawn system, which was home to a Mandalorian colony known as the Mandalorian Protectors. Rex advised his fellow rebels that the Mandalorians who inhabited the planet Concord Dawn had helped train clone troopers during the Clone Wars. At the end of the meeting, the rebels decided to send a diplomatic mission led by Hera, the leader of Phoenix Squadron, to negotiate for safe passage with the Protectors.[120]\n\nHera's diplomatic mission failed since the Protectors led by Fenn Rau had aligned themselves with the Empire. Under Rau's orders, the Protectors' Gauntlet fighters engaged Hera's RZ-1 A-wing interceptors in a vicious dogfight above Concord Dawn. Several rebel A-wings were destroyed, and Hera was badly injured. Following the dogfight, Rex was present during a briefing where Sabine, one of the survivors, reported on the dogfight with Fenn Rau. Rex recalled that Rau had served as an instructor in the Grand Army of the Republic. With Commander Sato's permission, Kanan along with Chopper and Sabine took part in a mission to destroy the Protectors' starfighters on the third moon of Concord Dawn.[120]\n\nRex accompanied the crew of the Ghost to investigate an Imperial construction module above the planet Geonosis. As a veteran of the Clone Wars and a participant of the second battle that took place on the planet, Rex was aware that Geonosis was home to billions of Geonosians. Thus, he was surprised when Chopper picked up no sign of life on the planet. Ezra then sensed through the Force that all life on Geonosis had been extinguished. Upon landing in the seemingly abandoned module, Rex stayed aboard the ship with Hera and Chopper while the other rebels went to explore the station. Shortly, they discovered that they had stumbled into a trap set by the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus.[121]\n\nWhile Rex helped Hera to man the Ghost's defenses against Imperial All Terrain Defense Pod walkers, Chopper freed the other rebels by unlocking the blast doors from the control console. Rex and the other rebels escaped the Imperial module aboard the Ghost. However, Zeb was separated and escaped in an escape pod with Kallus. After escaping Imperial TIE fighters, Rex and his fellow rebels began looking for Zeb. Despite sweeping through the system, they were unable to find Zeb, which led Rex to remark that the Lasat had a slim chance of survival.[121]\n\nMeanwhile, Zeb and Kallus landed on Bahryn, one of Geonosis's moons. After working together to fight off Bonzami predators, the two struck an unlikely friendship. Zeb activated his transponder, and the crew of the Ghost rescued him. Rex and the other rebels except Chopper greeted Zeb at the ship's gangplank after landing on Bahryn.[121]\n\nLater, Rex and several other rebels including Commander Sato, the Spectres, and Ketsu Onyo, Sabine's friend, attended a briefing aboard the rebels' captured Imperial fighter carrier to discuss their plans to set up a new rebel base. By cross-referencing several Republic and Lothalian star charts, the rebels had identified the planet Berzite's moon as a prospective candidate. Since the rebels' fighter carrier was low on fuel, Ketsu recommended stealing fuel from the Imperial depot at Horizon Base.[122]\n\nAs a result of the meeting, Commander Sato sanctioned a mission by the Spectres to steal fuel from Horizon Base. Rex stayed aboard the rebel flagship during the Imperial attack on the Phoenix rebel fleet. After Chopper and the former Imperial inventory droid AP-5 relayed information about an Imperial trap in the Yost system, Rex accompanied the rest of the Phoenix rebel fleet to Atollon; a safe world with no Imperial presence.[122]\n\nFollowing the discovery of Atollon, Rex was placed in charge of the establishment of Chopper Base on the planet. From the base's command center, Rex commanded operations to deliver shipments to the base and to establish sensor beacons that would serve as warning beacons for intruders. While Rex found the planet hot, dry, and unpleasant, he conceded that there was nothing trying to kill them. Later, he and Wren ventured to the base's northern perimeter to investigate the disappearance of Lieutenant Dicer, who had disappeared after planting her sensor marker.[123]\n\nUnder Hera's orders, Rex and Wren traveled there on the shuttle Phantom. Upon arriving, they found Dicer's helmet but saw no sign of the rebel. Soon, the two rebels were attacked by several large spidery creatures called krykna. Wren held off the creatures, but Rex was taken captive. The krykna carried him down to their underground lair where he was held in the mandibles of a sleeping krykna which hung suspended from the top of the cavern. Sabine and the Spectres freed him but were pursued back to the surface by the krykna.[123]\n\nRex and his companions made it back to the Ghost, but the starship was held down by a large web woven by the krykna. As the rebels fought to break their way out of the web, Rex and Chopper aided in the defense of the ship by fighting off a krykna intruder trying to breach the rear hatch. While Rex kicked and pushed the creature out, Chopper closed the rear doors. After escaping the krykna, Rex suggested reporting to Commander Sato that the base was unsafe. However, Syndulla responded that they had poured much effort into finding the base and should not give up. At Jarrus's suggestion, the rebels erected a fence consisting of sensor markers around the base the following day.[123]\n\nWhile Rex remained on Atollon[124] as the overseer of Chopper Base's operations,[125] he kept in contact with Ahsoka Tano as she traveled with Bridger, Jarrus, and Chopper to the planet Malachor to seek answers on how to defeat the Sith. Holding Tano in high regard, Rex offered to come to her aid within two rotations. Tano declined the offer and reiterated that this mission was Jedi business. When Tano joked that she outranked Rex, he replied that experience always outranked everything. Tano replied that she had more experience than him due to her experiences during the Clone Wars and Jedi Purge. Rex remained at Chopper Base for the duration of the Jedi mission to Malachor.[124]\n\nIn Rex's absence, the Jedi and Tano came into conflict with the Inquisitors and forged a tenuous alliance with the former Sith apprentice Maul to obtain a Sith holocron which purportedly contained the knowledge needed to defeat the Sith. After destroying the Inquisitors, Maul turned on the Jedi and blinded Kanan with his lightsaber. Later, the Sith Lord Darth Vader arrived, and the Jedi and Chopper managed to flee but Ahsoka chose to stay behind.[124]\n\nFollowing the mission, Rex and the other Spectres were present on the runway when the Phantom landed at Chopper Base. They watched in silence as Jarrus, now blind, and Bridger disembarked from the ship. When Rex saw that Tano was not with them, he bowed his head in sadness at the thought of having lost his good friend.[124]\n\nAfter Ezra and his team rescued the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka from the Imperial prison at Naraka, Rex attended a briefing where Hondo shared information on the Imperial floating junkyard Reklam Station inside the planet Yarma to the Phoenix rebels and Spectres. After Hondo revealed that the Imperials were dismantling Old Republic Y-wing starfighters there, Rex told his fellow rebels that the Y-wings were reliable combat fighters. In the end, the rebel leaders agreed to dispatch a recon mission to Reklam Station.[126]\n\nRex accompanied Ezra's team and Hondo on the Phantom to Reklam Station. On the way, the rebels exited hyperspace at Sereeda Waypoint where they were intercepted by a Mining Guild patrol. After escaping the Mining Guild patrol, the rebel team continued their journey to Yarma. While traveling inside Yarma's gassy atmosphere, the Phantom was pursued by two Imperial DTS-series Dismantler Droids. While Chopper shot down one, Rex opened the Phantom's rear hatch and fought with the second dismantler droid. He almost fell out but was pulled back into the ship by Zeb. In the end, Rex managed to shoot the droid but the Phantom sustained damage. Fortunately for Rex and his team, Sabine regained control of the ship.[126]\n\nAfter parking the Phantom beneath the station, Rex and his team convinced the local Ugnaught laborers to help them steal the Y-wings in return for their freedom. After stopping the conveyor belt, Rex and the other rebels began refueling the starfighters. Rex commented that refueling the fighters would not be their first nor last complication. After the Imperial Commander Brom Titus activated the magnetic locks on the Y-wings, Rex and Ezra departed to attack the Imperial control tower. Rex was forced to return when a third dismantler droid attacked Chopper, Sabine, and Zeb.[126]\n\nRex used a magnetic crane to trap the dismantler droid against a metal container before pushing it down into Yarma's volatile depths. The dismantler droid erupted in flames. After Ezra cut off the station's power, Rex and the other rebels departed on the Y-wings. Chopper used the relay navigation system to remotely pilot the other craft. Rex then traveled in the same Y-wing as Chopper, and the rebels escaped into the space above Yarma. The rebel Y-wings were intercepted by an Imperial Star Destroyer commanded by Governor Arihnda Pryce. However, they were saved when the Phoenix fleet arrived with the fighter-carrier Phoenix Nest and evacuated the fleet. Due to the efforts of Rex and his team, the Phoenix rebels obtained five Y-wings which were then transferred to General Jan Dodonna's unit.[126]\n\nFacing a shortage of supplies, Rex, Kanan, Ezra, Chopper, and Zeb traveled to Agamar to obtain proton bombs from a wrecked Separatist supply ship that had crashed on the planet during the Clone Wars. After landing on Agamar, Rex took the opportunity to tell the other rebels about his Clone Wars experiences. When Ezra opined that the B1 battle droids did not look dangerous, Rex responded that these droids had killed many of his friends. Rex and the other rebels soon found the munitions depot and discovered that it was full of proton bombs. Before they could proceed further, they were trapped in a ray shield and stunned by several battle droids led by B1-268.[29]\n\nAfter awakening, Rex and his fellow rebels found themselves prisoners of the super tactical droid Kalani. Kalani informed the rebels that he presumed the master control shutdown command issued to the Separatist Droid Army at the end of the war to be a Republic trick, and prevented it from disabling his battalion. Despite Rex insisting that the Clone Wars had ended and demanded that he and his friends be released. Kalani refused, stating that he would have one last battle; a victory for the Separatist Alliance. Zeb was the only one excluded from the battle on account that his species had not been involved in the Clone Wars. Though Rex, Kanan, and Zeb expressed their opposition to the war game, Ezra struck a bargain with Kalani. If the rebels made it back to the command center, Zeb would be free, and they would take all of the proton bombs in the hangar. Kalani accepted these terms, and the \"simulation\" began.[29]\n\nUnknown to the rebels or the Separatists, Chopper had evaded the battle droids and sent a distress call through a Neimoidian escort shuttle. However, the Empire picked up the distress signal, and Governor Pryce gave the order for the nearest Imperial fleet to deploy forces on Agamar to wipe out the rebels. Back outside the supply ship, Rex, Kanan, and Ezra began the \"simulation\" as a large force of battle droids marched on their position. Utilizing a \"sword and shield\" maneuver whereby Rex would fire and the Jedi would deflect incoming shots, as well as using two thermal detonators to wipe out large sections of the droid attack wave, the trio made short work of the first group of battle droids. They reached the hangar bay only to find that Kalani had deployed three droidekas to intercept them.[29]\n\nUnable to breach the droidekas' deflector shields, Rex and the rebels were forced to retreat. Rex and Kanan agreed to provide covering fire while Ezra headed into the hangar to collapse a catwalk over the droidekas. Ezra was delayed by an unexpected reunion with Chopper but still managed to collapse the catwalk with the Force. Meanwhile, Rex was hit in the chest by a blaster bolt from a battle droid but survived due to his clone trooper armor. While continuing their mission to the command bridge, they encountered Ezra. Rex chastised Ezra for his tardiness and warned him that one soldier's move affected everyone else in the team. In Rex's view, they needed discipline and strategy to succeed. Kanan counseled Ezra not to take the clone trooper's words personally because Rex was determined to finish the battle.[29]\n\nAfter Rex knocked out another droideka with his helmet, the rebels managed to enter Kalani's command center and declared victory. However, Kalani disagreed on technical grounds and prepared to execute Rex. Before any further violence could break out, Ezra interceded and convinced the two sides to put aside their differences. After Imperial forces landed on Agamar and attacked B1-268 and a battle droid patrol, Ezra won over Kalani to their side by pointing out that the Empire was the successor to the tyranny of the Old Republic. Kalani accepted Ezra's logic and agreed to help the rebels formulate an escape plan.[29]\n\nWorking together, Kalani, Rex, and the rebels improvised a strategy that involved rolling the proton torpedoes onto the feet of the advancing Imperial AT-AT and AT-DP walkers. When Kalani admitted never attempting such a desperate strategy, Rex responded that was why the clone troopers won; prompting Kalani to reply \"not always.\" After knocking out one of the AT-AT walkers, the rebels and droids fled aboard three Neimoidian escort shuttles while under fire from the Imperial walkers. One of the shuttles was shot down but the rebels' and Kalani's shuttles escaped into space.[29]\n\nOnce in space, Rex and the rebels corresponded with Kalani by hologram. When Kalani opined that their joint effort was a successful strategy but not a victory, Rex opined that it was a victory and thanked Ezra for finding a middle ground that allowed the clones and droids to end the Clone Wars. Both Rex and Kalani also accepted Ezra's explanation that both sides could not win the Clone Wars. Despite departing on friendly terms, Kalani thought that the rebellion had a poor chance of success and parted for parts unknown. Rex and the other rebels were later contacted by Hera. Despite not obtaining the proton bombs, they acquired a new transport for the Ghost.[29]\n\nRex and the Phoenix Squadron took part in a mission to evacuate rebel sympathizers from the planet Mykapo prior to an Imperial crackdown. After the Ghost and a local rebel cell called the Iron Squadron destroyed an Imperial advance patrol, Rex and the crew of a Sphyrna-class Hammerhead corvette evacuated the rebel sympathizers to safety. Rex contacted Hera and Kanan to inform them that he would be rendezvousing with the rebel fleet. Later, Rex corresponded with Hera and her crew by hologram while discussing a plan to rescue the Iron Squadron captain Mart Mattin from Imperial forces. This mission was ultimately successful, and Mart reunited with his uncle Commander Sato.[127]\n\nRex along with the Spectres and other members of Phoenix Squadron attended a briefing chaired by Hera Syndulla to discuss a planned strike against the Imperial Armory Complex on the planet Lothal. During the meeting, Ezra saw the former Sith apprentice Maul sneak past Rex. Using the dark side of the Force and Nightsister magick, Maul haunted Ezra and caused him to faint. As a result, Hera proceeded on the Lothal mission without Ezra.[128]\n\nRex accompanied the crew of the Ghost on a mission to find Saw Gerrera and investigate the apparent disappearance of the Geonosian species on Geonosis at the request of Senator Bail Organa; a key ally of the rebellion. Rex explained to the Spectres that he and Saw had fought as allies during the Clone Wars. He also warned his fellow rebels to be worried about what Saw did not find on Geonosis. The rebels landed near the Geonosian structure that Saw had last entered before losing contact with Rebel Command.[129]\n\nWhile exploring an underground labyrinth, Rex along with Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper found several discarded helmets belonging to Saw's team. Kanan and Chopper wanted to leave but Ezra and Rex were determined to find Saw and to complete their mission. After reaching a dead-end, the rebels were cornered by several battle droids and a droideka. Before the battle droids could finish off the rebels, Saw arrived and eliminated most of them with a grenade.[129]\n\nAfter greeting his former comrade in arms, Rex and his fellow rebels agreed to help Saw find the lone Geonosian, who had ambushed and killed his group. Saw believed that the Geonosian held the key as to why the Empire had wiped out the entire population of Geonosis. Rex, the Spectres, and Saw eventually reached the central air shaft. After Kanan contacted Hera to warn about the operational battle droids, the rebels discovered the lone Geonosian on the other side of the shaft.[129]\n\nWhile Ezra and Chopper pursued the Geonosian, Kanan used the Force to levitate Rex and Saw on a stone bridge over to the other side. Following a protracted pursuit, Rex and his comrades captured the Geonosian. While Saw was hostile to the Geonosian due to his animosity towards the Separatists, Ezra befriended the Geonosian, who was nicknamed \"Klik-Klak.\" While making their way to an energy reading picked up by Chopper, Rex explained that Saw was still affected by the death of his sister Steela at the hands of the Separatists.[129]\n\nThe rebels soon discovered that the source of the energy reading was Klik-Klak's nest, which contained a working transmitter. While Rex and Chopper worked to establish contact with Hera, Saw and Ezra argued about Klik-Klak; who revealed that he was the custodian of the last Geonosian queen's egg. While Saw wanted to interrogate Klik-Klak offworld, Ezra insisted that Klik-Klak belonged on Geonosis since he was one of the few surviving members of his species. When Saw expressed his dislike for the Geonosians, Rex reminded him that his mission was to find out what had happened to the Geonosian species. In the end, Kanan brokered a compromise that involved bringing Klik-Klak to Chopper Base for interrogation and returning him to Geonosis once they had finished with him.[129]\n\nAfter establishing contact with Hera, the rebels arranged to rendezvous with her at the central air shaft. After boarding the Ghost, Rex and the Spectres became involved in an argument with Saw over the treatment of Klik-Klak. Saw broke his agreement with Kanan and demanded that the rebels let him leave with Klik-Klak and the Geonosian egg. During the argument, Saw electrocuted Klik-Klak with an electro-shock device, which prompted Ezra to lunge at him. Rex tried to restrain Saw but the other rebel knocked him to the ground. When Saw threatened to destroy the Geonosian queen egg, Rex reminded him that doing so would sully the memory of his sister.[129]\n\nThe rebels' argument was interrupted by the arrival of an Arquitens-class command cruiser commanded by Captain Brunson. Rex and his fellow rebels and Saw joined forces to repel a boarding party of Jumptroopers. During the skirmish, Rex used the Ghost's laser cannon to blast several of the Jumptroopers. The Ghost then fled into the depths of Geonosis. There, the rebels and Saw discovered several Imperial poison canisters which the Empire had used to exterminate the Geonosians. Having found compelling evidence of the Imperial genocide, Saw experienced a change of heart and let Klik-Klak flee with the Geonosian queen egg into the depths of Geonosis.[129]\n\nThe rebels fought their way out of the air shaft by blasting Brunson's light cruiser with proton torpedoes. They informed Senator Organa and Commander Sato about their successful rescue of Saw, their acquisition of a deflector core, and their discovery of the Imperial genocide against the Geonosians.[129]\n\nAfter the rebels learned that Grand Admiral Thrawn was monitoring the rogue ISB Agent Kallus's Fulcrum transmissions, Rex took part in a rebel mission to rescue Kallus before the Empire captured him. As part of the mission, Ezra, Chopper, and AP-5 stole a shuttle from the planet Lothal's Capital City spaceport and allowed themselves to be captured by Kallus' Imperial light cruiser, which was captained by Lieutenant Yogar Lyste. Disguised as stormtroopers, Rex and Kanan traveled in the Sentinel-class landing craft TY997 to Lyste's light cruiser to facilitate the extraction.[130]\n\nThe rebel mission was complicated when Grand Admiral Thrawn requested an audience with Kallus and Lieutenant Lyste aboard his Imperial Star Destroyer Chimaera. After reaching the Chimaera, Chopper informed Rex and Kanan about the change of plans. While Rex expressed shock, Kanan told Chopper to get them a fresh set of coordinates for the Chimaera since their current coordinates would only work on the Imperial light cruiser. Chopper complied and obtained the new set of coordinates with the help of Kallus and Ezra.[130]\n\nAfter exiting hyperspace, Rex and Kanan discovered Thrawn's Seventh Fleet orbiting Lothal. When Kanan asked which ship, Rex told him to transmit the coordinates at random. TY997 was cleared for landing aboard the Chimaera. However, Thrawn had discovered that rebel infiltrators were aboard the shuttle and sent Governor Pryce to apprehend the intruders. Pryce saw through their stormtrooper disguises and ordered Rex and Kanan to surrender. When Kanan protested, Pryce stunned him.[130]\n\nRex shot one of Pryce's stormtroopers before fighting hand to hand with the governor. Pryce overpowered Rex and knocked him to the ground. However, Lieutenant Lyste, mistaking Pryce for Fulcrum, stunned her. Before Lyste could attend to Rex, Kallus tackled him to the ground. Rex and his fellow rebels then fled aboard their landing craft. Kallus opted to stay behind in order to continue helping the rebellion. He also framed Lyste as Fulcrum in an effort to draw attention away from himself, but Thrawn was not fooled.[130]\n\nRex along with Commander Sato and AP-5 were present at the Chopper Base command center when the former Imperial Senator Mon Mothma gave a live HoloNet speech denouncing the Empire and urging the galaxy to rise up in rebellion.[10]\n\nAfter Ezra Bridger heard Kanan Jarrus' holocron and the Malachor Sith holocron warning that the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi was in danger, Rex attended a meeting with Bridger, Commander Sato, and the other Spectres including Phoenix Leader Syndulla. During the meeting, Rex expressed sympathy for Bridger's desire to find Kenobi, but believed that Kenobi had perished, citing a report from Senator Bail Organa. Bridger disagreed and traveled with Chopper on a mission to find Kenobi. Bridger found that Kenobi was indeed alive and that Maul was no longer a problem, as Maul was finally killed by Kenobi shortly after meeting him.[131]\n\nRex took part in the Battle of Atollon. Before the Phoenix Squadron and General Jan Dodonna's Massassi Group could launch a coordinate attack on the Imperial TIE Defender factories on Lothal, Grand Admiral Thrawn learned the location of Chopper Base and invaded the Atollon system. In response, Hera devised a plan to sneak Ezra and Chopper out of the system aboard the Gauntlet fighter Nightbrother while launching a frontal attack on Thrawn's Seventh Fleet. Prior to the battle, Zeb and Rex joked about hunting joopas with Rex remarking they were hard to hunt but tasty.[132]\n\nDuring the space battle, Rex and Zeb manned the guns aboard the Ghost. After Commander Sato sacrificed his life and command ship Phoenix Nest by ramming Admiral Konstantine's interdictor vessel, Ezra and Chopper escaped and sought reinforcements from Clan Wren. However, the rebel forces sustained heavy casualties at the hands of Thrawn's fleet and were forced to retreat to Atollon. Rex and Zeb managed to activate Sabine's prototype deflector shield generator, creating an umbrella above Chopper Base and the remaining rebel ships.[132]\n\nDespite the shield generator taking heavy damage, Rex and Zeb were pleased when the shields appeared to hold up. After Thrawn deployed ground forces, Dodonna theorized that Thrawn would send his forces through the narrow canyon leading to Chopper Base. Rex proposed guarding the passes, which Hera approved. Rex destroyed several of Thrawn's AT-DP walkers with detonators while Zeb destroyed the last one with a rocket launcher. However, the two rebels were forced to retreat when Thrawn deployed several AT-AT walkers, which were protected by shield generators.[132]\n\nAfter reuniting with Kanan, the three rebels fled into the caves under the Atollon Coral Mesa and fought Thrawn's death troopers and stormtroopers. After reuniting with Hera, General Dodonna, and AP-5, they tried to flee to the Ghost but were surrounded by Thrawn and his death troopers. Before Thrawn could take them prisoner, Kanan's mysterious friend Bendu, the enigmatic Force-wielder, unleashed a thunderstorm which devastated the base. Rex and his rebel comrades fled aboard the Ghost and joined the rebel fleet in space.[132]\n\nBy that stage, Ezra had returned with Mandalorian reinforcements led by Sabine and Fenn Rau. The Mandalorians destroyed Thrawn's second interdictor cruiser, allowing the rebel remnants to flee into hyperspace. Under the orders of Hera, the rebel convoy set a course for Yavin 4. When AP-5 proposed doing two jumps to cover their tracks, Rex recommended a third jump.[132]\n\nFollowing the Battle of Atollon, Rex and the other surviving members of Phoenix Squadron joined the Massassi Group, a Rebel Alliance unit based on the jungle moon Yavin 4. Rex, several Spectres, and rebel ground crew were present at the airfield outside the Great Temple when Hera's squadron of Y-wings landed. Since the fighters had sustained damaged, the Y-wings including Hera's starfighter had trouble landing. Rex remained on Yavin 4 while the Specters undertook a mission to destroy the Imperial relay on Jalindi.[12]\n\nLater, Rex and the former Imperial Security Bureau Agent Alexsandr Kallus accompanied the Specters on an undercover mission to the Imperial-occupied planet of Lothal. Hera placed Rex in charge of looking after the Ghost while the Spectres infiltrated Lothal aboard Cikatro Vizago's freighter Broken Horn.[133]\n\nFollowing the Spectres' mission to the Lothal Jedi Temple, Rex accompanied Syndulla and Kallus on a trip to the planet Seelos to recruit several old friends of Ezra to assist in the liberation of Lothal. As the Ghost entered Seelos' atmosphere, Rex contacted his fellow Clone veterans Gregor and Wolffe; who had settled in a former AT-AT walker known as Joopa Base that was roaming G872.[134]\n\nAt Joopa Base, Rex and his rebel comrades encountered Gregor, Wolffe, the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka, his Ugnaught companion Melch, and the Mandalorian bounty hunter Ketsu Onyo. Rex, Hera, and Kallus recruited the group to participate in the liberation of Lothal as a favor to Ezra.[134]\n\nWhile traveling back to Lothal, the rebels waited in space at Hondo's suggestion to catch a ride on an Imperial Class four container transport. As they waited, Rex doubted that Ezra and the others could hold out against Governor Pryce's forces. Shortly, the container transport arrived, and the rebels latched the Ghost onto the ship. Upon arriving at the Lothal cliff dwelling, Rex along with Gregor, Wolffe, and Kallus helped the other Spectres and Ryder's rebel forces defeat Pryce's remaining troops and capture the Imperial Governor.[134]\n\nCaptain Rex participated in an operation to infiltrate the \"Dome\" alongside Wolffe, Gregor, and multiple other allies. The center of Imperial power on Lothal, the Dome was a mobile Imperial Planetary Occupation Facility that was equipped with thrusters. The rebels used two captured patrol transports to fly to the Dome. For the operation, Rex disguised himself as a stormtrooper. During the flight, Rex reassured a skeptical Gregor that Ezra's plan would work because he was a Jedi.[135]\n\nWith the help of an unwilling Governor Pryce, the rebels landed at the Dome's executive landing pad. Following a brief battle, the rebels captured the command center. With the help of Ryder Azadi, the rebels issued a faux Protocol 13 which caused the Imperial garrison on Lothal to evacuate aboard the Dome. Before the rebels could launch the mobile base, Grand Admiral Thrawn returned aboard the Chimaera and blocked their path. Since Thrawn's Noghri assassin Rukh and the Imperial forces had disabled the Dome's deflector shield generator, the Chimaera was able to bombard Capital City.[135]\n\nEzra stopped the bombardment by offering to surrender himself. When Zeb proposed using the Dome's cannons to blast the Chimaera, Rex advised against it since their weaponry was no match for the Star Destroyer's firepower. Despite Rex and Hera's objections, Ezra escaped on a patrol transport and went up to face Thrawn aboard the Chimaera. In Ezra's absence, the rebels endorsed Sabine's plan to recapture the north and south power terminals in order to restart the Dome's shield generators.[135]\n\nRex along with his fellow Team A members Hondo and Ketsu Onyo were assigned to the north power terminal. Despite fierce Imperial resistance, the rebels reached the north power terminal after Ketsu used a manual override to extend the bridges. Sabine also aided Rex's team by sealing a blast door so that they could proceed with their mission to reactive the power terminal. When Hondo's Ugnaught companion Melch arrived with a stormtrooper hot in pursuit, Rex shot the trooper. Rex was distraught when his Clone comrade Gregor was shot in the chest while taking part in the assault to secure the south tower. After restarting the north power terminal, Rex attended to his fallen comrade. Gregor told him it was a pleasure fighting alongside him for a greater cause before dying in his arms.[135]\n\nAfter Ezra summoned a pod of purrgil to carry him, Thrawn, and the Chimaera into uncharted space, Rex and the other rebels watched in shock in the command center. The rebels then launched the Dome into Lothal's upper atmosphere. As stormtroopers tried to storm the command center, Rex and the other rebels evacuated aboard the Ghost, which was being flown by Rex's fellow clone trooper Wolffe, Mart Mattin, and Cikatro Vizago. Once safely airborne, the rebels detonated the Dome, wiping out the Imperial garrison on Lothal and ending Imperial rule on the planet.[135]\n\nGeneral Syndulla told Rex to bring out every star chart along Ezra's last known trajectory. However, they received a pre-recorded message by Ezra telling him that he made a difficult decision and thanking the Spectres for being his family. Rex warned that the Empire would return to the planet, an assessment shared by Kallus who hoped that the Rebel Alliance would finally send support. He and his allies decided to help defend Lothal but in addition to that, he continued to work with the Rebel Alliance with General Syndulla. Despite Rex's fears, the Empire never returned to Lothal.[135]\n\nIn the years following the Battle of Atollon, Rex continued to serve in the Rebellion and work alongside its leaders.[125] Rex, who had since been promoted to the rank of commander,[135] was selected by General Han Solo and Major Bren Derlin to be part of the strike team to bring down the Death Star's shield generator on the moon of Endor. While on the moon, Rex encountered R2-D2, who was delighted to see his old comrade-in-arms as part of the team.[13] Rex served in the Battle of Endor,[135] fighting to ensure Emperor Palpatine could never hurt his clone brothers, or anyone else, ever again.[136] Indeed, the battle proved to be a major victory for the Rebel Alliance; in addition to the destruction of the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station, Palpatine was killed by none other than[137] Rex's former Jedi General,[6] Anakin Skywalker, who redeemed himself back to the light side of the Force to save his son, Luke Skywalker. The man now formerly known as Darth Vader died shortly afterward, and Luke gave him a funeral on Endor.[137]\n\nRex continued to fight against the Galactic Empire after the Battle of Endor.[113]\n\nRex was mentioned in a collection of hand-drawn maps with a focus on the Skywalker family and its exploits[23] done by the artist Gammit Chond, whose work would later be published by the Graf Archive as the Galactic Atlas.[139] Rex was pictured in Chond's maps of Geonosis, Christophsis, which further described his actions in its battle, and Kamino, where he was referred to as an Advanced Recon Commando. The Graf Archive was unsure about the accuracy of all of Chond's writings;[23] indeed, Rex had once remarked that he was not an ARC trooper but Fives was,[87] yet Rex had also been given ARC training[24] and affirmed in his text The Secrets of the Clone Troopers he had received the honor of ARC status.[113]\n\nRex was remembered by a member of the Whills, as someone to be remembered in galactic history. The Whill mentioned Rex and the others when they learned that the Whill tasked with writing about galactic history in the Journal of the Whills intended to start with the Galactic Civil War. The writer clarified Rex and the others' stories would be told, but the other Whill protested that it was being done out of order.[138]\n\nA legend amongst his clone brothers,[30] Rex was a dedicated veteran soldier[140] and brave Clone Captain,[33] later a Clone Commander. Rex was produced from the template of the bounty hunter Jango Fett. Rex even had adapted Jango's blaster-spinning routine with his pistols. [6] As with all of his fellow clone troopers, Rex lived to serve the Galactic Republic[17] and to protect its citizens.[28] While he was eager to follow orders, Rex adopted a less rigid approach as the Clone Wars wore on.[18] Indeed, while he was someone with an absolute loyalty to the Republic and his Jedi leaders, even he would find himself plagued with doubt as the Clone War dragged on, taking more lives and ruining more planets.[140]\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Rex would work alongside the Clone Commander Cody,[8] the Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, and the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano.[6][88] He was also loyal to his men, feeling that protecting them was one of his primary duties as a leader.[18] He tried not to dwell on any of the deaths of his countless friends and brothers, but when he had reason to believe that his comrade Echo was alive, he clung on to this belief.[68]\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Rex's priorities were first and foremost to his clone brothers,[74] whom he loved deeply. He was disgusted by Clone Sergeant Slick's betrayal of the Republic during the Battle of Christophsis,[40] and was greatly anguished having to defend himself and shoot his own men during the execution of Order 66.[88] Rex was particularly close to Commander Cody, as well as ARC troopers Fives and Echo. He greatly mourned the sacrifice of clone trooper Hevy; despite not having known the clone for very long, Hevy made a significant impression on the captain.[91] Rex was also devastated by Fives's death[85] and the apparent death of Echo, whom he was determined to rescue when it was discovered that he was alive.[68] At some point, a photograph was taken of Cody, Fives, Echo, and Rex, which Rex treasured greatly.[91] He was close with many other members of the 501st as well, including clone medic Kix, ARC trooper Jesse, and troopers Hardcase and Tup, among others.[18][88]\n\nRex allowed the clone deserter Cut Lawquane to continue living his life away from the war.[17] Rex and Lawquane's wife, Suu, were also friends.[141] He was also close with Commando Gregor—whom he considered an old friend[35]—and Commander Wolffe, living with the two of them for many years following the Clone Wars.[7] However, despite his love for his brothers, when they were controlled by their inhibitor chips during Order 66, Rex was willing to kill them if it meant saving Ahsoka's life. It was not a decision Rex made lightly, with the Clone Officer crying at the thought that his brothers had been brainwashed to lay down their lives to kill him and Tano. Although in the end Ahsoka told him not to kill them, the clones were killed in the crash of the Tribunal, but Rex and Tano made sure to bury their bodies to honor their former friends.[88]\n\nRex was very close with his Jedi General Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars, harboring deep respect and friendship for the man. The two trusted each other with their lives on a near-constant basis,[54] and Skywalker even trusted Rex to know about his secret marriage and to act as lookout whenever he wished to talk to her via hologram.[91] The two were close enough that friendly teasing was commonplace in their conversations.[87] Rex trusted Skywalker despite some of his risky plans, noting that Skywalker always led from the front and appreciating his commitment to his troops.[73]\n\nRex also developed a friendship[94] and close bond[125] with Skywalker's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, even becoming a mentor to her by offering her advice and valuable leadership experience, teaching her that experience outranked everything.[6] When Tano was framed for murder and treason, Rex doubted that she had committed the crimes, but followed the order to arrest her nonetheless. Despite this, the two would maintain a deep respect for each other after the Clone Wars. Rex and many of the other clones repainted their armor when Tano returned to their ranks shortly before the Siege of Mandalore. Although Tano told him that he did not have to refer to her as commander anymore since she had left the Jedi Order, Rex did so anyway.[94]\n\nWhen Order 66 was issued, Rex managed to resist his programming long enough to warn Ahsoka, before succumbing to the order. Under the influence of order 66, Rex's goal was to kill Ahsoka. However, after Ahsoka had Rex's inhibitor chip removed, his loyalty to Ahsoka returned, and he was willing to kill own brothers to save her life.[100] During the Imperial Era, Tano recalled her clone trooper friend when she saw the farmer Kaeden Larte, whose skin she noted to be darker than Rex's, albeit lighter than Mace Windu's. Later, she refused to imagine two stormtroopers as sharing Rex's face.[97] Later during the Age of the Empire, Rex reunited with Tano by joining the rebellion. His knowledge of former Republic military bases,[11] combat skills, and military tactics would help the rebellion in its fight against the Galactic Empire.[118][120] He was devastated when he learned about her presumed death on Malachor.[124]\n\nSurviving the execution of Order 66, one of Rex's first priorities was to warn Cut Lawquane about the control chips[104] before he made it his mission to fight the Empire. Even though he knew the government he had once served was gone, Rex believed elements of the Republic, like his clone brothers, still survived, convincing the captain to continue his life's mission to defend it. Nevertheless, he admitted to Hunter that he was still trying to find his place in the galaxy.[9] Echo believed Rex's resistance allowed clones like them to be soldiers without serving the Empire.[110] Upon learning that the Bad Batch had not removed their inhibitor chips, a concerned Rex warned them about what the chips do to the clones.\n\nAlthough Hunter had promised his squad would help Rex whenever he needed it,[9] Rex ensured he only contacted them in cases of extreme importance, such as the rescue of Gregor.[35] Later in the Imperial Era, Rex was willing to stay out of affairs[11] until he decided to join with the Rebellion.[7] He recognized that the Rebels helped people in the galaxy, while he saw that the Empire brought pain to the lives of many.[142]\n\nWhile Rex initially had a difficult relationship with the Jedi Purge survivor Kanan Jarrus and argued over strategies and Ezra Bridger's priorities, the two put aside their differences following a mission to rescue Ezra and Commander Jun Sato from an Imperial Interdictor. Rex was staunchly loyal to the Old Republic and refused to recognize the authority of the Galactic Empire after his inhibitor chip was removed by Tano. Rex's fortitude led him to resist torture at the hands of the Imperial officer Brom Titus. He also regarded Imperial stormtrooper armor as inferior to the clone trooper armor he wore during the Clone Wars,[118] just as he viewed the stormtroopers themselves as inferior to clone troopers. Especially compared to the other rebels, Rex was much more disciplined and by-the-book due to his military background.[126]\n\nDue to his Clone Wars experiences, Rex harbored a significant antipathy for battle droids.[29] However, he had a friendly relationship with Anakin Skywalker's astromech R2-D2[43] and a respectful relationship with the Lothal rebel cell's astromech droid Chopper.[121] Additionally, he showed respect and even some compassion toward a turncoat B1 battle droid nicknamed Bats during the Clone Wars.[72] His animus towards battle droids led him to reject Kalani's demand that Rex and his Jedi comrades Jarrus and Bridger take part in a reenactment of the Clone Wars. As a clone trooper, Rex was bred to fight and wanted to finish his mission to destroy his battle-droid opponents. However, Bridger convinced Rex and Kalani to put aside their past differences in order to fight the Empire.[29]\n\nRex harbored considerable respect and loyalty to his former Clone Wars comrade Saw Gerrera, whom he had first met during the Onderon campaign. While Rex was unwilling to abandon his former comrade, he still expressed discomfort with some of Gerrera's harsh methods including brutalizing the Geonosian captive Klik-Klak and threatening to destroy the last Geonosian queen egg. Still, Rex was empathetic to Gerrera's pain and realized that his comrade was still grieving the loss of his sister Steela. Rex's belief in the sanctity of life led him to fight with Saw when the latter threatened to destroy the last Geonosian queen egg.[129]\n\nRex had a deep respect for Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi due to their shared experiences during the Clone Wars. However, despite wanting to believe Kenobi was alive, he believed Bail Organa's word that the Jedi Master had perished. Rex was proven wrong when Bridger encountered Kenobi during an errant mission to Tatooine.[131] Rex and his friend Zeb also had a sense of humor, even during the rebellion's difficult times. During the Battle of Atollon, they traded jokes about joopa and quipped about Sabine's prototype shield generator.[132]\n\nBy the time that the Spectres returned to Lothal, Rex had become acquainted with his former Imperial foe Kallus. General Syndulla placed Rex in charge of looking after the Ghost in her absence.[133] Rex used his knowledge of Gregor and Wolffe's whereabouts to help Ezra find them, Ketsu, Hondo, and Melch in order to recruit them for Ezra's mission to liberate Lothal.[134] Rex later used his military experience and combat skills to help the rebels capture the Dome during the Liberation of Lothal. As a warrior, Rex believed that the rebels needed to be on guard should the Empire return to Lothal.[135]\n\nRex was a skilled military commander and a respected leader who won the respect of his men and peers.[7] Due to his combat experience with battle droids, Rex was familiar with robolobotomy. While he was trained to wield firearms, Rex was also proficient in unarmed combat.[40] Besides fighting droids and Imperials, Rex also had some experience dealing with the spider-like krykna which lived near Chopper Base, the Phoenix rebel base on Atollon.[123] Rex also knew how to handle machinery,[126] fly a Y-wing starfighter with ease,[100] and resist mind tricks.[41]\n\nRex put his combat and technical skills to good use when he escaped the Tribunal with Ahsoka Tano in a Y-wing bomber.[100] Avoiding mediocre Imperial security on Raada, Tano understood that, if Rex were in charge of the operation, the security would be more effective; the stormtroopers were solely focused on patrolling the construction workers, while she knew Rex would have had his troops patrol through the streets, even if it made building more difficult. Comparing the lackluster security measures to Rex's standards convinced her the officers in charge were young.[97] Lending the leadership skills he had developed in the clone army to the Rebel Alliance,[125] Rex became a successful rebel. He also demonstrated his skills in a successful rebel operation to infiltrate and launch the Dome during the Liberation of Lothal.[135]\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Rex wore both Phase I and heavily customized Phase II clone trooper armor. In the days of Phase II, he wore a unique armor set composed of phase II with phase I elements welded on, including his phase I helmet visor.[6][71] His armor was customized with a set of distinctive markings in blue,[144] the color used across the 501st for gear colorization. Rex also utilized a jetpack during various battles.[94]\n\nDuring the Imperial Era, Rex also took to wearing a cloak over his armor, allowing him to hide his face.[9] His helmets were known for sporting Jaig Eyes, a Mandalorian symbol of honor.[29] Someone who enjoyed wielding two blaster pistols at once,[144] Rex used dual DC-17 blaster pistols in combat during the Clone Wars and continued to use them after the fall of the Republic.[29] Rex also made use of a modified ARC-170 starfighter during the Clone Wars[145] and escaped Order 66 aboard a Y-wing bomber,[100] which he went onto use during the Imperial Era.[9]\n\nRex was created for the Star Wars: The Clone Wars film and television series, which ran from 2008 to 2013 on Cartoon Network, on Netflix in 2014, and on Disney+ in 2020. He was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, who reprised his role in the second, third and fourth seasons of the Disney XD television series Star Wars Rebels. Temuera Morrison would later play Rex in \"Part Five: Shadow Warrior,\" the fifth episode of Star Wars: Ahsoka. He has also appeared in several Star Wars Legends and non-canon media including the Dark Horse Comics Slaves of the Republic story arc and LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars.\n\nAccording to the The Clone Wars film DVD commentary, the series' creators originally intended to use the Legends clone trooper Alpha-17 of the Star Wars: Republic comic book series as the series' prime clone character. However, Star Wars creator George Lucas objected to Alpha's inclusion as it would have made too much alliteration (Anakin, Artoo, Ahsoka, and Alpha), leading to the conception of Rex. Later in the commentary, Dave Filoni stated Rex's use of twin blaster pistols was a direct reference to clone template Jango Fett. Filoni claimed Rex was more like Jango than some of his fellow troopers.[146]\n\nBefore the cancellation of The Clone Wars series, Brent Friedman wrote scripts for a four-episode arc starring Rex and R2-D2. A heated rivalry between the Clone Army's general ground forces and pilots and their droids would ultimately result in Rex flying a starfighter with R2 as his copilot. They would crash and be stranded together on one of the moons of Ryloth,[147] where most of the episodes would take place.[148] Rex and R2 reprogrammed a B2 super battle droid that they would grow attached to,[149] and at some point, Rex was injured.[150]\n\nDave Filoni speculated that Rex might be Nik Sant, one of the members of the Endor strike team from the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. \"I really do think that Rex is that guy on Endor,\" he said, \"I really do. Why else is there a bearded old guy on Endor, Tano? Why? It makes no sense. If you don't want that to happen, do you know what that means? I'm gonna make that happen, I'm getting like Palpatine, I'm getting power crazy.\"[151] The Rebels series finale, which aired on March 5, 2018, confirmed that Rex did fight in the Battle of Endor, though it did not confirm whether he and Sant were the same character.[135]\n\nSix months after the episode's airing, Filoni revealed in an interview with IGN he ultimately chose to not canonize the theory because he felt that laying down an already established character prior to his coming to Star Wars wasn't correct, adding that Rex could have been present at Endor and not be Sant, even though some fans could choose to believe that Rex and Sant are the same individual while other choose to not do so.[152] In 2019, Rex was depicted in recreations of shots from Return of the Jedi, as well as original shots, in the Star Wars Galaxy of Adventures short \"Han Solo - From Smuggler to General.\"[153] As Galaxy of Adventures is not meant to be a literal depiction of canon,[154] no source has currently stated that they are the same character.\n\nBefore the release of The Clone Wars season seven,[88] many sources wrongly assumed Rex removed his control chip before the execution of Order 66[156][157][158][159] after Rex seemingly said as such in Rebels. Filoni later clarified that Rex only told Kanan Jarrus \"the point of view Kanan needs to understand who Rex is and what he's really about.\" Filoni noted that Rex probably filled Jarrus in on the full story offscreen.[155]\n\nWhile season seven and subsequent stories have established Rex was quickly freed from his chip[88] and then fought against the Empire,[9] The Official Star Wars Fact File Part 118 erroneously claimed Rex served with the Empire for years, despite removing his chip, to stay with his brothers. According to the issue, Rex did not enjoy being a stormtrooper but underwent years of Imperial indoctrination, which made trusting Jarrus and Ahsoka Tano hard.[157] Due to the lore laid out since this issue's release, this article assumes Fact File Part 118 is incorrect.\n\nRex was incorrectly identified as CC-7567 in Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Character Encyclopedia - Join the Battle!.[5] The mistake was repeated in Rex's \"Databank Download\" article for Star Wars: Shatterpoint, with the title further misidentifying his number as CC-7667.[160]\n\nRex's Rebels-era Kit Reveal for Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes stated he was not a core member of the Phoenix cell.[161] While Rex was indeed not a member of the Spectres team, Rex was depicted as an important part of the larger Phoenix cell within Star Wars Rebels, even being depicted as someone who was able to join its command room.[10] Indeed, even Rex's recruitment to the Phoenix cell grew out of the many skills and leadership he could offer the group.[7] As such, this article assumes the Kit Reveal is incorrect.\n\nRex appears in several LEGO comics. In \"Escape from the Imperial Factory,\" Rex joins Han Solo in infiltrating an Imperial factory during the Galactic Civil War.[162]",
