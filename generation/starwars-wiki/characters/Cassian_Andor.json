  "content": "Cassian Jeron Andor was a human male operative of the Alliance to Restore the Republic who was remembered as a hero after his sacrifice to secure the Galactic Empire's Death Star plans at the Battle of Scarif. An accomplished spy and assassin, Andor was well-respected within the Rebellion and was trusted with leading Alliance Intelligence missions by Alliance High Command.\n\nOriginally a Kenari boy named Kassa, the human was rescued by smugglers Clem and Maarva Carassi Andor after a Republic vessel had crashed on his Mid Rim homeworld of Kenari prior to the Clone Wars. Thereafter, the boy was named Cassian Andor, given a forged identity as an individual born on the planet Fest, and settled with his adopted family, including the droid B2EMO, on the Free Trade sector world Ferrix. After the execution of his adopted father, Andor came into conflict with Imperial authorities. Before officially joining the Rebellion, he was contacted by the leader of the Axis network, Luthen Rael, and participated in the Aldhani heist. For a brief period of time, using his share of the money stolen from Aldhani, he lived as a tourist on the planet Niamos using the alias Keef Girgo, before being arrested and becoming a prisoner in the Narkina 5 Imperial Prison Complex. Upon breaking out, Andor received news that Maarva had passed away, and returned to Ferrix, where, following a riot induced by his mother's final recorded message, Andor eventually joined Rael's network and made his way into the war against the Empire. During his time in the Rebellion, Andor worked as a skilled spy, assassin, soldier, and pilot, operating many rebel missions with aliases such as Willix, Aach, Joreth Sward, Varian Skye, Ronni Googe, Clem, and the codename Fulcrum.\n\nBy 1 BBY, Andor was a captain for Alliance Intelligence and was assigned to assist in Operation Fracture: to extract Imperial scientist Galen Walton Erso, responsible for the development of a secret Imperial \"planet-killer\" superweapon. Erso had tasked cargo pilot Bodhi Rook with delivering a message about the weapon to renegade rebel leader Saw Gerrera on the moon Jedha. Andor, alongside his droid companion, K-2SO, and Galen's daughter Jyn Erso, traveled to Jedha City and made acquaintances with two local Guardians of the Whills: Chirrut Îmwe and Baze Malbus. Together, they recovered Rook from Gerrera's enclave of rebel Partisans, and Jyn Erso watched her father's holographic message about the superweapon—named the Death Star. After narrowly escaping the test firing of the Death Star on Jedha, the crew traveled to the planet Eadu, where Galen Erso was stationed at an Imperial laboratory. Andor was secretly instructed by Alliance Intelligence's General Davits Draven to assassinate Galen Erso, and to that end, the rebel operative kept his intentions to himself and lied to Jyn Erso that they would retrieve her father.\n\nHowever, Andor was conflicted as Jyn Erso claimed that her father, per the message she received, was deceiving his Imperial superiors and had installed a fatal flaw within the Death Star—one that the rebels could exploit to utterly obliterate the weapon. Andor hesitated while Galen Erso was within his sniper rifle's scopes, and rebel reinforcements bombed the Imperial facility, killing Jyn's father. After Andor pulled Jyn Erso away from the ruined facility and their crew hastily fled aboard a stolen Imperial transport, the rebels gathered to discuss the threat of the Death Star at their hidden fortress on the moon Yavin 4. When Alliance High Command rejected Jyn Erso's plea to steal the Death Star plans from an Imperial installation on Scarif, Andor assembled a team of soldiers willing to act of their own accord, having been inspired by Erso's assertion that rebellions were built on hope and determination against all odds.\n\nThe rebel team, designated Rogue One, was comprised of Andor, Erso, K-2SO, Rook, Îmwe, Malbus, and Sergeant Ruescott Melshi, and aimed to steal the plans themselves. Andor, Erso, and K-2SO snuck into the Scarif base's Citadel Tower vault, while Melshi led the bulk of their forces to cause chaos around the base by planting detonators and engaging the Imperial garrison. Upon the arrival of the Alliance Fleet in Scarif's orbit, Andor and Rogue One requested the fleet to disrupt the planetary shield so that they could beam the Death Star plans to the fleet. Although the rebels succeeded in transmitting the plans, the Death Star itself came to Scarif and fired upon the Imperial base: Cassian Andor and Jyn Erso embraced each other on the shores of Scarif in their last moments, satisfied that Jyn's father would be proud. Thanks to Rogue One's efforts, the Rebellion used the plans to identify the weak point planted by Galen Erso, and the Death Star was soon destroyed.\n\nA human male, Kassa was born[1] on the planet[16] Kenari[1] in 33 BBY[3] in the later years of the Galactic Republic, prior to the start of the Clone Wars.[17] He lost his mother at a tender age. There was little else in Kassa's life aside from constant battle.[7] However, the many struggles he faced were largely undocumented. According to what he personally confirmed, he had fought as a revolutionary since he was only six years old.[18] After managing to survive the mining efforts—which had been carried out by groups like the Republic and commercial interests—that exploited Kenari and left the world toxic,[19] Kassa made a life for himself as part of a small village tribe of youths alongside his little sister Kerri,[1] living in the forest and surveying deforested ruins that were caused by the massive mining operations[20] that had left children such as himself the only survivors on the planet.[19]\n\nAt the age of nine years old,[21] when a Republic[22] transpo corsair crashed near his village,[17] Kassa wished to join the party of fellow youths to investigate the wreckage. While some of Kassa's peers had wanted to exclude the boy, their group leader personally allowed him to don their camouflage markings and join their party. Each armed with a blowgun, the Kenari trekked through the jungles and approached the crash site.[1] After their group leader was killed by the lone survivor of the transport with blaster fire—technology alien to the Kenari—the youths promptly sullied the crash victim with poison darts and carried their late leader's body away.[23] A shocked Kassa stayed behind and went inside the ship, where he lashed out his frustrations at the alien technology that lined the vessel's walls. Suddenly, a trio[8] of scavengers—Maarva Andor, her husband Clem,[24] and their droid B2EMO—entered the ship in search of salvageable technology and came face-to-face with Kassa.[8]\n\nSubsequently, he was taken offworld and adopted by Maarva, who did not want him to be in danger by those who would come for it next.[8] The Republic ship bore a symbol closely related to the eventual Confederacy of Independent Systems,[17] which waged the Clone Wars against the Republic later in 22 BBY until 19 BBY.[25] Moving to the[17] planet[26] Ferrix with his new adoptive parents,[17] Kassa then took on the name Cassian Jeron Andor, with official records stating his origin to be the[23] planet[5] Fest.[23] While questions about the truth of that claim did emerge, the haze caused by covert operations and war left it plausible and kept the truth hidden. Like many other rebels of his generation, conflict was a constant throughout Andor's life.[18] Although he left his home planet of Kenari behind, he never forgot about his sister.[22]\n\nAndor's Rebel Alliance file,[27] something that would be of questionable accuracy because of the haze of war and covert missions,[18] made several allegations about his life during the Clone Wars. It alleged that[27] his birth father was killed at the Carida Academy in a protest against the expansion of Republic militarism[5] during the Clone Wars.[28] The file further alleged that[27] Andor joined an insurrectionist cell backed by the Confederacy in the wilds of the Outer Rim Territories and fought against the Galactic Republic. While he never became a formal Separatist, Andor saw combat experience in the cell as a child soldier.[5] While he did not have specific duties during his time as a child soldier, limiting his experience[7] to tossing rocks and bottles at Republic walkers and clone troopers,[5] his life remained one full of conflict.[7] Whether it was true or not,[27] Andor would ultimately continue to live on Ferrix with his adoptive parents even as[29] the war ended in 19 BBY[25] with the defeat of the Confederacy.[30] Andor at one point told Arvel Skeen that,[31] during his turbulent childhood on Ferrix,[2] he spent three years in a youth center on Sipo, beginning at the age of thirteen. It was there that he learned about prison tattoos, including Krayt Head and By The Hand tattoos.[31]\n\nThe Republic, meanwhile, was restructured into the Galactic Empire under Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, who became the state's Galactic Emperor.[30] In 19 BBY,[32] the Empire moved to assert control over Ferrix, deploying a formation of clone stormtroopers under an Imperial officer. Andor and Clem stood with many other members of their community as the clones marched down Rix Road through Ferrix City, with Clem urging the boy to remain calm and wait for the Imperials to leave. When a few citizens began to protest and throw rocks at the soldiers, Andor was ordered by Clem to not intervene while he went to diffuse the situation. The officer, however, assumed Clem was part of the demonstration, leaving Andor to watch as a blaster was aimed at his adoptive father. Clem was taken away by the Imperials and hanged for his supposed defiance at Rix Road.[29]\n\nEnraged at the execution of his father, Andor traveled to Rix Road while his father's body still hung to confront four clone stormtroopers with a baton.[29] At some point, Andor spent time with anarchist groups that defied the Empire.[5] Alongside the destruction of Imperial property, Andor had a charge for attacking an Imperial soldier on his record.[23] Andor claimed that he was forced to fight for the Empire on the swampworld Mimban after leaving prison when he was sixteen years old, although when he said this to Luthen Rael after they met[12] in 5 BBY,[33] Rael retorted by saying that he had only spent six months on Mimban and served as a cook, before deserting.[12] Andor eventually entered a relationship with salvage yard owner Bix Caleen,[29] but their relationship became broken due to Andor's actions.[34]\n\nBy 5 BBY, Andor lived with Maarva and B2EMO in a house on Ferrix.[1] At one point, he stole an Imperial N-S9 Starpath Unit from the Empire from the Imperial Naval Base on Steergard.[8] Despite having a new family, Andor did not forget about his long-lost sister and had begun[1] a galaxy-wide search[35] for her. After learning of a girl from Kenari working at a brothel on Morlana One, he traveled to the planet's Leisure Zone in search of her. Upon entering, he ordered a drink at the bar and was soon approached by a hostess, which angered two other patrons who had not been served yet. The hostess dismissed them and turned her attention back to Andor. He calmly refused her services and asked her if there was in fact a girl from Kenari working there. When the woman left to check, the two men began making snide remarks at Andor. Upon the hostess returning, Andor learned that a girl from Kenari had indeed been working there, but had left several months earlier. Andor asked for her name and if she knew where the girl had gone, whispering that he was searching for his sister when the hostess inquired about his relation to the girl. She then said that people came and went all the time and that he should leave. Andor asked if she knew the girl's name, but the hostess replied that nobody used their real names at the establishment.[1]\n\nAs Andor walked through the rain of Morlana One back to his ship, the two men from the brothel, who were guards for the Preox-Morlana enforcement division, followed him, stopping him from returning to his ship. When Andor said that he had three hundred credits in his pocket and did not want any trouble, the first man, Kravas Drezzer, smiled and said that three hundred was exactly the amount owed for illegally parking his ship past the causeway. He then held his blaster to Andor's head while his compatriot, Verlo Skiff, rummaged in his coat to take his credits. It was then that Andor sprung into action, headbutting Skiff and brawling with Drezzer, wrestling his blaster away and aiming it at the man. On his knees, Drezzer realized that Skiff was not breathing and told Andor that he had killed him. He then begged for his life, offering to help corroborate a story that would excuse Andor of murder. However, Andor decided to kill Drezzer before fleeing back to his ship and returning to Ferrix.[1]\n\nReturning to Ferrix, Andor first stopped at his hideout, which was a downed ship located in a junkyard outside the city. He was later awakened by B2EMO. As he ate, he inquired if anyone had come by the house looking for him, to which B2EMO responded that his friend Brasso had. He then asked B2EMO to help him lie and form a cover story for his whereabouts the previous night. When the droid agreed, Andor hustled to the mines, where he met Brasso after he returned from his shift. After Brasso inquired as to where Andor had been the previous night, Andor launched into a false account of the events, telling Brasso to help cover for him. Two two agreed to a story that the two had wanted to go out drinking, and after deciding against going to Cavo's, ended up falling asleep at Brasso's home with a bottle of nog. Afterward, Andor traveled to[1] Caleen Salyard[36] to meet with his friend Bix Caleen. He told her of the Starpath unit he had acquired, knowing she had a contact who would want to buy the item. Caleen begrudgingly agreed to contact the buyer on his behalf.[1]\n\nLooking to use the money to leave Ferrix, he arranged a meeting with the buyer, a rebel named Luthen Rael. Wanting to buy the unit but being more interested in Andor's skills, Rael tried to recruit Andor to his growing efforts. When Rael revealed that he knew a lot of information about Andor, including about his father's death, Andor became angry and pulled his blaster on the man, but before their conflict could escalate, the two were attacked by the Preox-Morlana. Andor got grazed in the shoulder by a blaster shot. Working together, the pair managed to escape back to town, commandeer a speeder, travel to Rael's ship, and leave Ferrix.[8]\n\nLater, Rael tried to convince Andor to join his nascent rebellious movement, but Andor insisted that, while despising the Empire, he only sought his own freedom and comfort. Thus, Andor agreed to participate in a mission on Aldhani for a reward of 200,000 Imperial credits. Adopting the alias \"Clem,\" the name of his adoptive father, he shaved off his facial hair and met with the rebel Vel Sartha. Rael introduced Andor to Sartha and told her that she had to incorporate him into her team. Sartha was displeased, but Rael told her that he would call her operation off if she did not accept. He then told her to lie to the others and say that Andor had always been supposed to join them. Rael then departed, leaving Andor and Sartha to return to the rebel camp. During their trip, Sartha told Andor not to mention Rael to any of the others.[12]\n\nAndor arrived at the team's camp and was greeted with suspicion by the rest of the team. The rebels Arvel Skeen and Taramyn Barcona were angered by the addition, with the former regarding Andor with a particular scorn. Andor had his wound treated by Cinta Kaz and later spoke with Karis Nemik, who was much more amicable than the others.[12] The evening before the operation, Andor was briefed on the plan, which was to infiltrate the Aldhani dam, steal a Max-7 Rono box freighter, and load the Imperial payroll onto the ship before flying away. Andor was confused by certain elements of the plan and eventually realized that none of the other rebels were familiar with the specific freighter and did not know how to fly it. Andor demanded to fly it due to their unfamiliarity, and although she initially objected, Sartha agreed to let him fly.[31]\n\nAndor continued to learn details about the plan and learned that he, Barcona, Nemik, and Skeen would be impersonating Imperial Army troopers under the command of Lieutenant Gorn, an Imperial double-agent who the team was in league with. He inquired as to what Sartha and Kaz would be doing, but got no response. As the four men drilled, Andor suggested that Barcona and Skeen switch sides, and although Barcona reacted with hostility, Sartha stopped him and prompted Andor to explain why he had suggested it. Andor explained wanting Skeen on the opposite side due to his dominant left hand, and Sartha accepted the suggestion.[31]\n\nThe crew executed the plan soon after, taking the Aldhani Garrison commandant Jayhold Beehaz and his family hostage to enter the vault and steal the Imperial payroll. To escape the garrison, Andor flew the Max-7 Rono freighter, piloting the ship through the celestial event known as the Eye of Aldhani in order to flee an assignment of TIE fighters deployed to intercept them. During the escape, Karis Nemik was crushed by a payload of credits, critically injured, he continued to provide basic directions to Andor who piloted the freighter. After escaping the planet, Skeen and Sartha commanded him to change course to the remote nearby moon of Frezno to tend to Nemik's injuries. While Quadpaw operated on Nemik in a medical establishment, outside, Skeen offered Andor in his plan on bailing out on his crewmates and split the entire payroll for themselves after fleeing towards a nearby moon via the freighter. Andor, disgusted and deciding to stay committed to the cause, immediately shot Skeen dead. Later entering the establishment and holding Quadpaw and Sartha at blasterpoint—Andor announced Skeen's death, and briefed on the man's planned betrayal of the crew as well as confirming his own share of the credits, some of which Andor intended to spend on purchasing Quadpaw's ship in his barn to return to Ferrix. Before leaving, Sartha gave Andor Nemik's manifesto.[37]\n\nAfter leaving Frezno, Andor returned to Ferrix to find it under Imperial occupation. He hoped to convince Maarva and B2EMO to leave Ferrix for a fresh start elsewhere to evade Imperial rule using his share of the payroll. However, Maarva refused, having been inspired by the news on the Aldhani heist to join the rebellion. Andor also encountered Caleen, injured when she hit a wall while being held captive previously. He gave her twelve thousand credits for Caleen to pay off the debt he owed to people.[29]\n\nDespite his efforts of convincing Maarva to join him, Andor left Ferrix alone and traveled to Niamos,[29] a tropical world that had once been a popular site for fugitives who needed to lie low but since had fallen under Imperial occupation.[38] There, he went under the alias Keef Girgo and stayed in a hotel with the woman Windi. After a run-in with a shoretrooper, who accused him of being involved in anti-Imperial activity, Andor was arrested and brought to the Niamos Courthouse. Waiting in a long line of citizens waiting to be heard by a judge and prosecutor. Under the Empire's recently enacted Public Order Resentencing Directive, a measure implemented due to the Aldhani heist, Andor was sentenced to six years in prison on Narkina 5 and given no chance to protest.[29]\n\nAndor was incarcerated in Imperial factory facility part of the Narkina 5 Imperial Prison Complex on Narkina 5 and was assigned to Unit Five-Two-D's Table Five, consisting of six other inmates who constructed Imperial machinery[39] known as the EP-N5 fastener,[19] although Andor himself never learned of the machinery's name nor purpose.[40] Each of the tables were put in competition with each other and supervised by a floor manager, the prisoner Kino Loy. Across day shifts, Andor formed bonds with fellow inmates, particularly those of his own table. Whenever Andor had thoughts of beginning an uprising, he was shut down by Loy, who preferred to finish his sentence which was nearing completion. Despite this, Andor and another teammate of his level, Birnok, conspired to disable the Tunqstoid steel-charged flooring to enable the chance of an uprising. Their sabotage involved gradually cutting a water supply tube with a make-shift knife across shifts. When Andor and Loy learned of prisoners being re-sentenced instead of set free at the end of their sentence,[39] they led a successful uprising on the facility and escaped by swimming across the lake onto nearby land.[41]\n\nWhen Andor and fellow prisoner Melshi reached land, they ran and climbed away to evade incoming patrols. After successfully evading them, the two conspired to steal a distant parked quadjumper guarded by two fisherman, Dewi Pamular and Freedi Pamular. Melshi attempted to steal the ship, which led to him and Andor being caught in a net trap. Despite this, the two were later freed by the fisherman, who were sympathetic to their plight, and agreed to drop them back on Niamos.[41]\n\nAfter arriving on Niamos, Andor retrieved his case containing his personal belongings from his previous hotel room and contacted Xanwan on Ferrix to ask him to pass on his assurances to Maarva. Xanwan, shocked that Andor was unaware, informed him that she had recently passed away. Devastated, he silently grieved her death watching the sun set on the coastside, though he did not tell Melshi. After Melshi wondered whether they were the only ones who escaped, Andor gave Melshi a pistol and the two split up to convey the story of their imprisonment at the Narkinian facility to others.[41]\n\nAfter returning again on Ferrix to attend his mother's funeral, Andor learned Caleen was captured by Imperials. After Pegla, a local shiplot employee, arranged for Andor to meet with Brasso in an underground tunnel, he made the decision to rescue her from captivity. As a riot erupted outside during Maarva's funeral, Andor navigated his way through the hotel-turned-prison and rescued Caleen from her cell. Escorting her out, they join Pegla who helped Brasso prepare a shift for take-off to transport Wilmon away from Ferrix. Cassian bids B2EMO, Caleen, Pegla, and Wilmon farewell and promised to meet with them again later on.[11]\n\nLater as Rael returned to his ship, he discovered Andor who was waiting for him, offering his blaster. Andor offered Rael to end his life then and there for how much of a nuisance he became for him, or to spare him and take him in as he seeks to join the fight against the Empire. Rael, smiling, accepted his offer,[11] bringing Andor into his rebel network[19] and the[42] currently-informal[43] Rebel Alliance.[42]\n\nAndor joined the early Rebellion[7] as a member of Luthen Rael's Axis network. In his capacity as a rebel agent, Andor could be deployed to carry out missions and meet with Rael's clients, such as the rebel leader Maya Pei. In the year following the Ferrix uprising, Andor would also re-establish a degree of contact with Brasso, B2EMO, Caleen, and Wilmon Paak, who had taken up life on the farming world Mina-Rau as undocumented workers. In 4 BBY, a year after the Ferrix conflict, Andor agreed to a mission to steal[44] a prototype Imperial starfighter known as the TIE Avenger[45] from the Sienar Fleet Systems-controlled[44] planet Sienar TF73.[46] Leaving his Breon HOY-39 Dayvan on[44] the Outer Rim moon[19] Yavin 4 with his Bryar pistol aboard,[47] Andor departed for 73, leaving with the understanding that another pilot, Porko, would take the Avenger forward once he returned to Yavin.[44]\n\nWearing the garb of a Sienar test pilot,[48] Andor infiltrated Sienar Test Facility 73 and waited for the rebellion's contact in the base,[44] a Sienar worker named Niya,[49] in an empty cafeteria at night. He waited by a window when Niya approached him and told him the starfighter was ready for a test drive and the password was Kafrene. Andor asked for the key, and Niya explained they had to wait for her supervisor to leave as he did not stay late. She suggested a cover story of them flirting, and was nervous about the operation, but Cassian reassured her. Niya admitted to having had fun at the villa and her fear of change; Andor told her she was brave. Andor then watched as Niya lied to another colleague who thought that Andor was cute. Niya continued to be afraid of dying and the mission not meaning anything, so Andor reassured her again and said she made the correct decision.[44]\n\nAfter giving Niya a 20 minute head start, Andor made his way to the hanger unobstructed and boarded the Avenger. However, being unfamiliar with the starfighter's unusual controls, he accidentally launched himself in reverse, setting off the alarm and forcing the hanger doors to close. He struggled to move the Avenger towards the exit, instead firing the rotary blaster cannons wildly and colliding with the ceiling. As a stormtrooper squad arrived and opened fire on the rogue starfighter, Andor resorted to firing on them. He then swerved around and narrowly evaded a rocket fired by a ranger trooper. As his opponent began reloading his weapon, he attempted to fire the underbelly heavy laser cannon, resulting in the trooper's disintegration, blowing a hole in the door in the process. Andor then repeated the process, creating a large enough opening for him to accelerate into the outside and skid down a frozen slope. The starfighter briefly lost power upon coming to a stop, before Andor evaded two incoming missiles and dove into the canyon with two TIE/ad v1s in pursuit. After a brief chase while repeatedly colliding with the canyon walls, he managed to collapse a tunnel with a spread of torpedoes, crushing his pursuers, allowing him to flee 73.[44]\n\nAndor traveled back to Yavin and landed back at his rendezvous point where he left his Breon HOY-39. Observing no sign of Porko, Andor exited the starfighter to investigate, only to be ambushed by a group of 15 humans, who assume him to be Imperial because of his uniform and take him prisoner. As the group's two contentious leaders, Bardi and Gerdis tried interrogating him, Andor tried insisting he was with the Rebellion and asked for Porko's whereabouts, and learned that his friend had been killed for opening fire on the group. Andor was then taken back into the TIE Avenger as his captors' only pilot, Rika, tried figuring out its control system. He tried warning her against touching any instruments. Upon giving a sarcastic reply when asked how he arrived, provoking Gerdis into grabbing him, Andor insisted there was no instruction manual.[44]\n\nWhile his captors were busy bickering among themselves, Andor unsuccessfully tried convincing his guard, Crab, to escape with him. He then played on his emotions, guessing his group had only arrived two days ago, as he himself had left three days prior. He then approached the group, identifying them as the Maya Pei Brigade. Learning that the Brigade had narrowly escaped an Imperial ambush and they assumed Pei to be deceased, he tried convincing them he was an ally, explaining that his group was responsible for supplying them, but refused to identify which rebel cell he belonged to; Crab tried to attack him in retaliation for being tricked but was restrained by Gerdis.[44]\n\nBy nightfall, tensions amongst the Maya Pei Brigade inevitably boiled over as Crab shot Rika, resulting in the splintering into two sub-factions between Bardi and Gerdis. Andor was taken hostage by Gerdis' group and hid in the wrecked Breon HOY-39 while Bardi's faction took the TIE Avenger.[44]\n\nLeft chained up, Andor opened his mouth for dripping rainwater as Gerdis' scout, Snee was searching the foliage between the two ships, before a blaster fight broke out forcing her back to the Breon HOY-39. As Snee informed her comrades that she found what was left of Crab's foot, leading them to presume the remains were eaten by animals, Andor interrupted them and advised they use the tarp to converse rainwater.[47]\n\nCome morning, Andor leaned over to drink water from a bowl as Gerdis' group took stock of their rations. As Plug suggested feeding Andor a moldy meal bar, he pointed out that Bardi's group had gone silent and advised they set up a perimeter; Gerdis defended he was about to do that, so Andor acted like it was his idea. Subsequently, Plug was sent to scout the area and he hastily returned to report that Bardi's people were working to move the TIE Avenger to train its weapons on their hideout. As his captors tried to calculate how long it would take, he responded that if Bardi was lucky, they would've shifted the starfighter about 5 meters by midnight, prompting Gerdis to order a barrage to slow their progress.[47]\n\nBy nightfall, Gerdis and Bardi agreed to settle their turf war with Five Hands under Roski rules; the winners get Andor to fly them off planet while the losers would stay. While his guard Flek was distracted by the contest, Andor waited for the overhead thunder to mask the sound of him kicking open a compartment concealing his Bryar pistol, which he used to shoot his restraints and force Flek's silence as he bound and gagged him. Retrieving his hyperwave communicator from an overhead compartment, Andor then made his way through the trees as cover. While chaos erupted as a Yavinian doodar devoured Bardi and Gerdis with the Maya Pei Brigade firing wildly into the jungle, Andor ran back to the Avenger and killed the rebel sitting inside, before taking the starfighter into the air and departed the moon, leaving the 10 remaining survivors behind.[47]\n\nOnce safely in deep space, Andor got to work hotwiring his hyperwave communicator to the Avenger's power supply, only to accidentally ignite the starboard thruster, sending him spinning out of control. After remaining upside-down for two days, he managed to get in contact with Kleya Marki. Speaking in code, he informed her that he was in transit and that he failed to make the rendezvous with Porko. When pressed for his location, a frustrated Andor vented that he couldn't fly the Avenger and asked if she or anyone else knew that, and requested a new drop-off location. Subsequently, he made his intent to call his friends on Mina-Rau, only for Marki to forbade him, cryptically claiming the planet had become \"crowded\". Confused, he pressed her for an explanation and was told that Mina-Rau was under a frequency blockade. Fearing the worst, Andor cut off contact and plotted a course for Mina-Rau.[50]\n\nUpon arriving in orbit, Andor spotted an Imperial cruiser orbiting the planet, and proceeded to perform a nosedive through the atmosphere. Arriving the airspace over Council 436, Andor spotted an Imperial troop transport, and quickly destroyed it with a missile, causing confusion amongst a squad at the Mina-Rau General Store, indirectly providing a distraction for Brasso to dash for his speeder bike. As the Imperials proceeded to open fire on Brasso, Andor responding by strafing them, eventually taking out the remaining 3 stormtroopers by destroying a grain silo and spilling its load onto them.[50]\n\nSpotting that Brasso's speeder had crashed, Andor proceeded to land the Avenger and ran to his friend, only to find that he had already been killed. Andor briefly held his friend in his arms before hearing Bix Caleen and Wilmon Paak calling out for him. After a moment of hesitation, he rejoined them and informed them of Brasso's demise. Realizing they couldn't stay on Mina-Rau, Andor led his friends into the Avenger and proceeded to flee the planet, leaving Brasso's body behind.[50]\n\nIn 3 BBY, Andor was living on Coruscant with Bix Caleen at Luthen Rael's safehouse in Tomkip Towers, and the two had rekindled their relationship. However, Caleen was still suffering from the trauma she endorsed at Dr. Gorst's hands to the point where she had trouble sleeping and would frequently hallucinate Gorst. One such night, Andor woke up to find Caleen pointing her blaster at empty air and gently pried it from her hands before embracing her, unable to get her to open up about her trauma.[51]\n\nThe next day, Andor and Caleen go out to Samo's, a bodega they visited the month before, to purchase food. Andor silently hung back while Caleen, passing him off as her husband, made the purchase. When they later returned to the safehouse, Caleen asked if he intended to tell Rael about the Imperial soldier he killed on their last mission. Andor replied that Rael only cared for results and rationalized that he had to kill that soldier because they were at war. But later, as they were having dinner, hearing Caleen request going out for a walk in the big park, he deemed it risky, given that the Imperial had placed cameras all over the place. They soon got into an argument over his overprotectiveness of her. When he threw back her difficulties sleeping, she retorted that she was not Maarva or Kerri and added that the whole reason he killed that Imperial soldier was because he saw her face.[51]\n\nA few nights later, Andor found Caleen awake and assumed she was seeing Gorst again, only to be passed her macrobinoculars, allowing him to spot a beacon flashing a code from Rael wanting a meeting. Andor later met with Rael the next day, and was told that he was to travel to Ghorman and make contact with the Ghorman Front and perform an assessment of their leader, Carro Rylanz. Though Andor promised to think about taking the mission, Rael pointed out that the Empire was choking Ghorman so hard that even Rylanz was willing to actively oppose them.[51]\n\nAndor later visited the Niki-Bon Travel Agency, who provided his alias \"Varian Skye,\" a Coruscanti fashion designer, before traveling to Ghorman. After checking into the local hotel in Palmo Plaza, he inquired with his porter, Thela, about the Tarkin Massacre, and apologized to the young man who painfully recalled that his father died saving him when Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin landed his cruiser and killed 500 unarmed Ghormans.[52]\n\nLater, while sitting at a cafhouse, Andor was approached by Enza Rylanz, who had decided to make contact with him first. After exchanging pleasantries, Enza recalled how popular the cafhouse used to be before the Empire's oppression. Disappointed with the manner in which she casually approached him, Andor briefly toyed with her, suggesting that he might be an Imperial spy or a snitch looking to sell out the Ghormans for a payday and cautioned her against rushing into causes. A nervous Enza refuted that patience was a luxury when one's world isn't falling apart, adding that her father was very proud. Resuming his pleasant demeanour, Andor expressed his enthusiasm to meet with Carro and arranged to meet at the House of Rylanz next morning. As he got up to leave, he whispered to Enza that the people she had following him were merely drawing attention and advised sending them home.[52]\n\nThe next day, Andor visited the Rylanzs' twillery and met Carro Rylanz. After receiving assurances that the Ghormans sweep for listening device daily, the two men got to business. After confirming that the Front was responsible for rescuing a rebel pilot who crashed in the mountains, Andor passed Carro a special code crystal for the radio the pilot gave the Ghormans. Carro recalled corresponding with Rael but had no idea of his ally's identity. Andor maintained Rael's anonymity, saying it was for everyone's benefit.[52]\n\nThe Ghormans then told Andor of the suspected Imperial armory being constructed in Palmo and that they had been investigating its purpose, eventually gaining an inside source, whom, unknown to Andor, was Syril Karn. Responding with skepticism that they turned an Imperial to their cause, Andor suggested that their source might be feeding them false information, though Dilan insisted their source was reliable. The Ghormans then explained their plan to hijack an Imperial transport they suspected to be carrying weapons and expose the Empire's oppressive actions, but acknowledged that they lacked the tactical expertise to pull it off. Andor requested tour of Palmo at night, during which Enza and Dilan explained their plan to disable a lone cargo carrier and drop the weapon crates into the spillway to be collected by their transport.\n\nAndor met with Carro Rylanz at the cafhouse. Hearing the Ghorman leader eager to learn if Andor was leaving to bring back reinforcements, he replied that it wasn't his decision, especially since he had more questions than recommendations. He judged that while their plan is feasible with outside support, the fact that they intend to advertise what they had done while living at the scene of the crime is a bad idea. His response earned Carro's disappointment, who departed with the bitter message to pass onto Rael that he was unimpressed with Andor.[52]\n\nAndor later traveled to Port Steergard to meet up with Rael, arriving late to the rendezvous as a result of a pre-flight inspection. As they traveled back to Coruscant aboard Rael's Haulcraft, Andor recommended avoiding getting involved with the Ghorman Front. Rael responded with disappointment that Andor would just give up after spending a day on the planet, having been informed by the Ghormans of his reluctance. Andor insisted that the Ghormans weren't ready to fight the Empire and were carelessly rushing. As he explained the Ghormans' plan, he judged that it would pointless and that the Empire would crush them. Rael disagreed, believing that the potential for violence on Ghorman could galvanize the Rebel cause, and criticized Andor for thinking like a thief than a leader; Andor insisted he was thinking like a soldier and refused to get involved.[53]\n\nAndor later returned to the safehouse and reunited with Caleen, sharing an intimate kiss and embrace. As they got to talking about his mission, he learned that Rael visited her while he was away to ask for a weapons appraisal. This news upset Andor, as Rael did not disclose his meeting with Caleen.[53]\n\nTraveling to Galactic Antiquities and Objects of Interest, Andor confronted Rael in his shopkeeper persona for going behind his back and talking to Caleen. However, Rael, eager to get Andor to leave to avoid prying eyes, told him to leave immediately with the improvised cover story that he was returning a Darvian Medallion that Kleya Marki misplaced. As Andor questioned what was wrong with him, Rael stated this was the second time he had let him down today and that he thought it would have been more interesting if Caleen didn't tell Andor, and now they both disappointed him.[53]\n\nAndor took offense what he viewed as Rael's self-important goals, but the spymaster asserted that \"The Cause\" mattered more, reminding Andor of the words he said back on Ferrix where he was given the choice to kill or recruit him, and he chose the latter. Rael further mocked him for being too soft on Ghorman yet willing to protect Caleen at any cost. Andor defended that he gave him everything, but was reminded that he was the one who recklessly risked exposing them out of anger and lack of self-control. Rael stated that Caleen had to pull herself together or risk becoming a liability. Andor retorted that his relationship with Rael worked better with Caleen left out, reminding that he joined him to be a part of something and suggested that he wanted him to keep fighting, Rael will find a way to work things out, and departed.[53]\n\nThe next night, Andor woke again to find Caleen out of bed, staring out the window. As she drew his attention to the signal beacon on the horizon indicating a new mission, she insisted on joining him. Turning her to face him, he agreed to bring her along.[53]\n\nThe pair infiltrated an Imperial Intelligence facility where Dr. Gorst was heading a new Imperial interrogation programme. Caleen awaited Gorst in one of the interrogation rooms and ambushed him, leaving him strapped to the same torture device he used on her. Andor later rejoined her after she left Gorst and killed a security guard, before they blew up the building.[53]\n\nIn 2 BBY, Andor was recruited by General Davits Draven,[5] having chosen to leave Rael's singular cell to instead join[10] the growing,[14] formalized rebellion[54] on Yavin 4.[10] Draven became Andor's case officer.[18] Andor and Caleen lived together on the jungle world in a treehouse not far away from the Rebel base. They were approached by Wilmon Paak with a mission from Rael—to assassinate ISB Supervisor Dedra Meero, now stationed on Ghorman, to put an end to her hunt for Rael and the three Ferrixians present. Andor refused, believing the time for lone actions had passed. Later that night, Caleen brought Andor to the Force healer to treat his injured shoulder. Initially reluctant, Andor is persuaded by Caleen to visit the healer, despite his skepticism. He recalled a negative experience with a Force healer years ago, making him wary of such practices. However, Caleen insisted, arguing that his untreated blaster wound needed attention. The healer, an older woman with silver hair, immediately sensed Andor’s injury without being told, demonstrating her Force sensitivity. She gently placed her hand on his shoulder, closing her eyes as she channeled the Force. Andor, visibly uncomfortable, tried to dismiss the experience, but the healer's words strike a chord.[source?]\n\nShe told Caleen that Andor is not merely a soldier or pilot—he is a \"messenger,\" someone with a destined path. She described him as someone who gathered purpose as he moves forward, rather than being defined by his past. This revelation unsettled Andor, who had spent much of his life resisting the idea of fate. He abruptly left, but Caleen stayed behind, seeking further insight. The healer explained that Andor carries pain, fear, and need, but unlike most beings, he is moving toward something significant. She cryptically suggested that there is a place he needs to be.[source?]\n\nLater, Andor noticed that his shoulder wound has begun to heal, reinforcing the healer's abilities. Caleen shared the healer's words with him, calling him a \"messenger.\" Though he initially dismissed it, the idea lingered in his mind. Influenced by both the healer and Caleen, Andor makes the decision to leave Yavin IV without authorization. Alongside Wilmon Paak, Cassian returned to Ghorman using a U-Wing to complete Rael's mission for them, much to the annoyance of Draven. Andor returned to the hotel in Palmo under the alias \"Ronni Googe,\" a journalist for the Mid-Rim News, reuniting with Thela, and began listening to Imperial comms.[source?]\n\nThe next morning, Andor assembled his blaster rifle in his hotel room, preparing to assassinate Meero. He contacted Wilmon Paak, who was stationed at the Ghorman Front Headquarters, and together they assessed the Imperial Army's movements. Andor quickly realized that the Empire was constructing a fortress around the Memorial to the Fallen, making any attempt to strike at Meero increasingly difficult. As protests began to swell in Palmo Plaza, Andor watched from the shadows, trying to determine his next move.[source?]\n\nBefore heading into the plaza, Andor had a quiet but significant conversation with Thela. As Andor prepared to leave, Thela revealed that he never officially registered Andor's stay, protecting his cover. In response, Andor offers him a blessing, prompting Thela to reply, \"Rebellions are built on hope.\"[source?]\n\nAs the Ghorman resistance gathers, tensions reach a boiling point. Andor blends into the crowd, observing the Imperial forces as they prepare for confrontation. The protesters, led by Enza Ryland, chant their defiance and sing the Ghorman National Anthem, refusing to back down. The Empire, however, has set a trap. A rooftop sniper fires into the crowd, sparking chaos. Believing the protesters initiated the attack, Imperial forces open fire, turning the plaza into a warzone.[1]\n\nAmid the massacre, Andor attempts to take out Meero, but his efforts are thwarted when Syril Karn unexpectedly intervenes. The two engage in a brutal fight, with Karn nearly overpowering Andor. As Karn raised Andor's own blaster rifle on him, Andor failed to recognize him, stating, \"Who are you?\" As a stunned Karn lowered the rifle in response, Carro Rylanz shot Karn in the head, ending the struggle. Andor, shaken but determined, escapes with Paak, witnessing the devastation left in the massacre’s wake. During his escape, Andor encounters a KX-series security droid deployed by the Empire to suppress the uprising. The droid grabs Andor by the throat and lifts him off the ground, nearly crushing him. Struggling against its grip, Andor manages to disable the droid when a Ghorman rebel Samm crashes a heavy-duty speeder into it, cutting it in half. Recognizing the potential value of the damaged droid, Andor salvages its parts. Paak stayed behind to help the remaining members of the Ghorman Front, and the sons of Ferrix bid each other farewell.[1] Cassian drove away in the speeder with the KX droid parts. Tears welled in his eyes as he listened to Dreena's emergency broadcast.[55]\n\nCassian headed straight from Ghorman to Coruscant, where he waited in Rael's shop alongside Kleya Marki. As Marki forged a press pass, she informed Andor of Senator Mon Mothma's plan to deliver a power speech which condemned the actions of the Emperor, and how they needed him to evacuate her afterwards. Andor took on the false identity of Ronnie Googe, a reporter, and told Marki he intended to leave the Rebellion after the job. Marki stated his job was not done, although Andor responded that he wanted to make his own decisions.[14]\n\nThe following day, Andor met with Marki and Rael at a public walkway. Rael informed Cassian of the plan following Mothma's extraction, and Cassian was surprised that Rael intended to stay on Coruscant. Rael insisted that they still worked together and cited all prior times Andor helped him, although Andor seemed to be losing trust in him.[14]\n\nAndor mingled with reporters at the press gallery and was joined by Mothma's aide Erskin Semaj, and exchanged the code phrase 'I have friends everywhere'. Andor and Semaj headed to Mothma's pod chute whilst she delivered her speech from inside the senate. The pair separated, and Andor approached Mothma under the guise of being a reporter, before using the code phrase as identification. Mothma was suspicious, and Andor revealed he was friends with Vel Sartha and was part of the Aldhani heist, before stating his own frustrations with Rael. The pair exited the turbo lift together, and were confronted by a group of reporters who Semaj attempted to send away. Organa's agents, Beska and Selko approached the pair, and Beska revealed herself to be an Imperial spy. Semaj shouted that she was a rebel spy, which gave Cassian the distraction to shoot her dead. Andor and Mothma escaped through the atrium, and left Semaj to control the crowd. Mothma was shocked, but Cassian just welcomed her to the Rebellion. Mothma's driver, Kloris, approached them as they fled down a bridge, and Cassian also shot him dead when Mothma identified him as ISB. The pair then escaped in her limousine airspeeder.[14]\n\nAndor and Mothma arrived at the safehouse where Semaj was waiting for them. Marki arrived later and expressed surprise at Cassian's survival. He found a heavily injured Wilmon and Dreena in the bedroom, having successfully evacuated Ghorman. Mothma thanked Andor for saving her, and he said to make it worth it.[14]\n\nAndor, Dreena, and Wilmon took a starship to Yavin IV, where he spoke to Draven. Draven expressed doubt about Dreena, but Andor reassured him that she would fit in, being a survivor of the massacre. [14]\n\nAndor would subsequently reunite with Bix Caleen and told her of his plans to leave the Rebellion and start a new life with her. However, the next morning, Andor discovered a video recording from Caleen, stating that she could never forgive herself if she was the reason he left the Rebellion, so she chose to leave so he could remain focused on the cause with the promise to come find him once they had defeated the Galactic Empire. Andor would then race to the spaceport, only to be told that Caleen had already left[14]\n\nAndor would subsequently preside over the reprogramming and reactivation of the KX droid he recovered, K-2SO, cautiously training his blaster rifle along with several rebel troopers as he was reactivated.[14]\n\nHolding the rank of captain, Andor served as an officer in the Alliance's Intelligence branch which he spent most of his Alliance service in. He established a reputation as an agent who was willing to die in the name of taking down the Empire.[18] He often worked alone on missions where he had little hope for backup. He was also involved in scrappy, but nevertheless vicious, battles waged for unclear goals.[7]\n\nBecoming a veteran spy of the Rebellion[6] who took on many missions that could be deemed morally questionable,[18] Andor maintained a network of contacts throughout the galaxy who kept him informed about the Empire's activities.[6] Throughout his career as an intelligence agent, Andor also worked undercover and used several aliases[5] in locations under Imperial control, taking on the dangerous tasks to secure intel on Imperial actions. During one of his missions, Andor needed to impersonate government agents on[18] the planet[56] Ord Mantell. While working as one government agent, he went by the name Willix. As a senatorial contact on Darkknell, he was Aach. Andor used the name Joreth Sward when he was an assistant to Admiral Grendreef. Andor also used the code name Fulcrum when he worked as a Rebel recruiter in the Albarrio sector.[5]\n\nHe worked to recruit several new agents during that operation. Under the Fulcrum codename, he also funneled intelligence to many rebel cells. By virtue of spending so much of his service undercover in star systems that were under Imperial control, he was able to see firsthand how ruthless Imperial occupation could be towards the people they controlled, with the spy often being stationed on moons and planets that the Empire was strip-mining. Ultimately, Andor decided to take many morally questionable options instead of doing nothing against the Empire over the course of his career. While most of his fellow undercover Rebels did not survive their own missions,[18] Andor managed to survive[6] but recognized that his successes, like those of other agents, did not bring about major victories for the struggling rebel cells. During that time, Andor came to rely on the fact that he was following orders to justify the actions he carried out in the name of the Rebellion.[18]\n\nK-2SO was modified and came under Andor's ownership,[18] with the rebel spy developing a friendship with the reprogrammed droid as they continued to work together.[6] Following this, Andor and K-2SO were sent to the F'tzner system to undertake a raid on an Imperial freighter. Andor used gas to trick the Empire into thinking that smugglers stole the cargo, as smugglers were known to use gas to raid transports. When they got to the cargo room, they found three Wookiees named D'Koetaa, D'Lylaa, and Wyhyatt, and took them instead of the cargo. Andor then took them to the monastery moon of Charissia in the Bartahn sector. There, he left K-2SO to look after the three Wookiees while he undertook a raid, which was successful.[57]\n\nIn 1 BBY,[4] Andor sent K-2 to Coruscant to infiltrate the Aloo family. The rebels believed that Imperial advisor Sim Aloo and his daughter Alinka were collecting Sith artifacts for Emperor Palpatine. Under the guise of a cargo droid named K-2SB, K-2SO spied on the operations until a ship he was on was stolen by the Wookiee Chewbacca and the young bounty hunter Mayvlin Trillick, both of whom had been blackmailed into assisting Alinka recover an artifact from the planet Ushruu. K-2 had been tasked by Alinka to pilot the ship there, and when he communicated the situation to Andor, Andor ordered him to assist them but to recover the artifact himself and not allow it to return to the Aloos.[58]\n\nAndor often went to great lengths to recover information about threats to the Rebellion, with the man developing a particular focus on retrieving intelligence about weapons development.[18] Andor began working to surveil Imperial kyber crystal shipments, with his contacts confirming that the Ring of Kafrene was a hub for undercover Imperial transportation of the dangerous crystals. Although he could not discover the magnitude of the operation due to the fact that the Empire was using civilian ships to do the bulk of the movement, he reported the development to General Draven.[59]\n\nAndor, K-2SO, and Melshi were playing a game of chips, something they did regularly, and were playfully arguing over K-2SO's predictions of their moves, when Paak suddenly interrupted them. Paak showed his Fractal radio, which was banned from Yavin 4, which was receiving a transmission. Andor believed it was erroring, but Paak was insistent that someone was calling for help. Andor, Melshi, and a reluctant K-2SO decided to answer the distress call. They discovered that Kleya Marki was the one who sent the distress signal, as her identity had been revealed to the Empire. Marki revealed Luthen Rael's death, and attempted to pass on a secret message with the intention to remain behind and die. Andor promised her that Yavin 4 would accept her, but she accused him of betraying Rael due to joining the Rebel Alliance;[60] however, he continued to reassure her of Yavin's safety. Avril Heert and his Imperial troupes arrived to arrest and torture Marki, so Andor and Melshi fought them off. Marki was knocked unconscious, and K-2SO ultimately saved the trio when they were cornered. Andor and Melshi chose to take Marki with them to Yavin 4.[10]\n\nAndor successfully convinced the suspicious rebels that they were also rebels and not imperials. He then admitted to Draven that he was intending to rescue Rael, who was now dead. Andor explained the secret energy project that Rael died to expose, but the council were suspicious of the lack of information, especially due to Rael's duplicitous nature. Andor was especially annoyed with Bail Prestor Organa. He visited Marki in the infirmary and apologized for the lack of a positive welcome, before he then reunited with and embraced Paak. Vel Sartha later visited Andor in his hut, where they drank revnog and Sartha toasted to the people they met in the journey. Andor toasted to Cinta Kaz after Sartha was unable. Sartha admitted to having been sent by Mothma to get confirmation on Marki's story, which Andor stated was true. When Sartha left, she advised Andor to reconnect with Caleen, as she knew where she was living, but Andor was reluctant.[10]\n\nThe next day, Andor dreamt of his sister before being woken by K-2SO. Organa visited Andor, and informed him that he was approved to confirm Marki's story by going on a mission to the Ring of Kafrene. Andor noted Organa's more positive attitude, before stating he would have got along with Rael. Organa stated \"May the Force be with you\". Andor walked through Yavin 4 and observed all of the people he had met and befriended throughout the years: Melshi, Paak, Dreena, Sartha, Mothma, and the Force Healer. He and K-2SO took off in their ship together.[10]\n\nAndor met with Tivik—an injured member of Saw Gerrera's Partisans[6] whom Andor had turned into his contact within Gerrera's forces[10]—in section nine. Through Tivik, Andor learned[6] vital information[18] about how the Empire had built a superweapon, which his informant—a defecting cargo pilot named Bodhi Rook—described as a planet killer. As he continued to try to coax information out of Tivik, two stormtroopers advanced towards them.[6] The stormtroopers surrounded them,[18] having become suspicious of the exchange, and the two troopers before them demanded to see scandocs.[6] Despite deeming it to be a terrible moral choice, Andor realized there was a chance Tivik would be taken prisoner and interrogated until he revealed what he had told his fellow Rebel, which would mean he would need to kill the informant to protect what he had learned from getting out.[18]\n\nAndor only had a few moments to consider the options before him.[18] As the stormtroopers demanded answers, he feigned awkwardness before quickly drawing a blaster pistol, gunning down the two troopers. Another trooper noticed the incident and called for reinforcements to section nine. Realizing their clandestine meeting location was also a dead end, Cassian deduced the quickest escape path was to climb out, but Tivik revealed he would be unable to escape the area because of his injured arm. Although Andor calmed Tivik, he quickly decided to shoot Tivik in the back[6] to ensure he would not be captured by the Empire. Visibly upset but deciding to wait before he reflected on what he had done,[18] Cassian stowed his pistol in his belt, left the bodies, and climbed away before more stormtroopers,[6] who were closing in,[18] could arrive.[6]\n\nOn orders from Mothma, Draven, and[18] Senator[6] Bail Prestor Organa, Andor took part in the liberation of Jyn Erso[18] on the planet Wobani. Erso was a former close associate of Saw Gerrera and the daughter of scientist Galen Walton Erso, who had been pressed into working on the secret project Tivik had warned Andor of.[6] Andor had identified Erso despite being entered into the Imperial prison system underneath the alias Liana Hallik. Andor also confirmed she had operated under several under aliases.[59] He was given further orders by the three Rebel leaders to help convince the younger Erso into helping them retrieve a message from Galen that had fallen into Gerrera's hands[18] thanks to Rook,[6] as Gerrera would not be willing to work with them alone.[18] Indeed, Andor was then stationed at the Rebel base on Yavin 4 as Erso arrived at the base, having been rescued by rebel forces that included K-2SO.[6]\n\nDuring a briefing with Mothma, Draven, and Erso, Andor explained that Gerrera had the Imperial cargo pilot, who defected at the behest of Erso's father, captive before revealing that the Empire was building a planet-killing superweapon. Erso ultimately joined the mission Andor was set to led to meet with Gerrera,[6] with Andor's mission, according to what Erso was told, being to confirm the message was real before finding Galen, if that was possible.[18] Andor was ordered to travel to the moon of Jedha,[6] which was the last known location of the Partisans[18] but also an active war zone due to their actions. As Erso got aboard Andor's U-wing, LMTR-20, Andor was pulled aside by Draven, who told him to keep an eye on Erso due to her reckless and potentially volatile nature as well.[6]\n\nRevealing there would be no extraction carried out, Draven then changed Andor's mission[6] with a questionable command that was designed for its ends to justify its means: while Mothma indeed hoped Gerrera could convince Galen to testify in front of the Imperial Senate to stop the superweapon's development, Andor was secretly ordered by Draven to kill Galen, who was vital to the secret weapon's completion, on sight.[18] In truth, however, the weapon—known to its developers as the Death Star—was already operational. When Andor returned to the U-wing, he attempted to confiscate the A-180 blaster that Erso had armed herself with, but ultimately allowed her to keep it. They then departed to Jedha to find Gerrera[6] and learn more about the secret weapon the Empire was developing.[18]\n\nOnce they landed outside of Jedha City, he and Jyn left K2 with the ship and proceeded towards the Temple of the Kyber, where they would contact one of Gerrera's Partisans and request a meeting with him. Going to his various sources, the two got stuck in the middle of Tythoni Square, where an Imperial patrol was ambushed by the Partisans, attacking and causing heavy casualties on both sides. When the Imperial TX-225 GAVw \"Occupier\" combat assault tank destroyed a building with several of the Partisans still inside, Andor shot and killed the tank commander. However, when Jyn took cover behind the tank as more stormtroopers arrived, Andor then fired on a Partisan that was about to throw a grenade at the tank, which would have killed Jyn, an act that was noticed by the other Partisans. When the last troopers were eliminated, the Partisans advanced and looted the tank of the stolen kyber. However, Imperial reinforcements, including an AT-ST, soon arrived. As the fight continued, the two escaped and ran into K-2SO. However, the two were then mistaken for his prisoners and were detained by troopers.[6]\n\nJust then, Chirrut Îmwe and Baze Malbus stepped in, defeating the entire group of troopers. However, as Andor and his new companions were then immediately captured by Saw's forces, with their leader, Benthic, noting that Andor had killed one of their own. They were blindfolded with sacks over their heads and were taken to Saw's hideout outside the city before being thrown in cells.[6] Arriving at the base meant Andor had a chance to see Gerrera face-to-face.[18] While imprisoned, he found the Imperial pilot Rook was imprisoned beside him and asked him of the location of Jyn's father. However, Rook, who had just been interrogated by Bor Gullet, was incoherent and unable to communicate with Andor. Shortly afterward, the Death Star arrived over Jedha and fired its superlaser for the first time, targeting Jedha City. The city was instantly annihilated, with the destruction progressing quickly outward. Andor was able to free himself and led Îmwe, Malbus, and Rook outside as the rest of the Partisans descended into chaos as they attempted to escape the blast. Andor located Jyn and brought her outside as K2 brought the U-wing to load their crew. As the blast continued to radiate, Andor and K2 were forced to jump to hyperspace while still in atmosphere, but miraculously escaped.[6]\n\nHaving learned Galen Erso was on the planet Eadu, Andor contacted Draven via a coded communication, telling him \"Weapon confirmed. Jedha destroyed. Mission target located on Eadu, please advise.\" He was advised to proceed with haste, and while they were in hyperspace, a conflicted Andor directed K2 to plot a course for Eadu. Jyn spoke up and told the group that she had seen the message from her father. She told Andor that her father had built the weapon with a trap inside it that would allow it to be destroyed. Andor asked to see the message, but it had been destroyed on Jedha. He asked Bodhi if he had seen the message, but the pilot shook his head. Andor told Jyn that there might be problems trying to convince Alliance High Command to act on her word with unverifiable evidence. Jyn demanded that he tell the Alliance that the Death Star plans were on Scarif, and they could use the plans to find the way to destroy the reactor and therefore the entire station, but Andor refused as they were in the heart of Imperial territory. Jyn said that they would have to find her father so he could testify himself, and while he outwardly nodded, Andor knew that his orders were to eliminate Galen if they found him.[6]\n\nDespite the crew[18] they had suddenly gathered,[6] Andor kept up the appearance that he would be rescuing the elder Erso, even though he was grappling with the moral dilemma of killing the man.[18] The group arrived on Eadu, flying low and through bad weather attempting to avoid Imperial detection. After they crashed some distance away from the Imperial facility, Cassian and Rook left so that he could get in position to take out Galen, with Cassian preventing Jyn from joining them and lying to the group, saying he was simply doing reconnaissance. However, before he departed, he put his weapon in the sniper configuration, which K2 noticed and caused Jyn, Chirrut, and Baze to later follow them.[6]\n\nWhen they reached a vantage point with a view of the landing pad, Cassian sent Rook leave to find a ship to escape with. When Rook asked what Cassian would be doing, he sent Rook on his way without offering an explanation. He then watched a meeting between Galen and Director Orson Krennic as the later arrived in a shuttle with a squad of death troopers. Missing several opportunities to take him out,[6] Cassian hesitated to fire[18] and realized there was more to the situation than what met the eye, ultimately deciding there must be another way as[6] he lowered his blaster. His change of heart either came from his murder of Tivik finally catching up to his conscious or his adventure with Erso, and meeting with Gerrera, having changed his way of thinking.[18]\n\nHowever, the Rebellion's Blue Squadron came and attacked the facility. The squadron had been launched by Draven when he lost contact with Cassian following their crash. Rebel X-wings bombed the platform, killing Galen in the process. He made his way to the platform and rescued Jyn, who had ascended the platform to find her father herself, and the group left on a stolen Zeta-class Heavy Cargo Shuttle and returned to Yavin 4.[6]\n\nAs they proceeded back to base, alerting Alliance Command that they were in a stolen shuttle, an angry and sorrowful Jyn confronted Cassian, telling him that she had figured out that he was planning on killing her father.[6] Although Cassian was defensive[18] and reminded her that he even had a chance to pull the trigger and did not, Jyn retorted that he may as well have, since he ended up being killed by Alliance forces.[6] Revealing the buried anguish that fueled his fight against the Empire,[18] Cassian quickly grew angry at her accusations and reminded her that he had been in the fight for much longer than she had and that she was not the only one that had lost everything doing so.[6]\n\nJyn tried to convince the alliance to attack Scarif in order to retrieve the plans to the Death Star, but many of the council members were despairing, lamenting how they had already lost the war and talking about disbanding. Mon Mothma told Jyn that they could not proceed with her proposed attack without more support, so Jyn stormed away from the meeting. However, knowing this would happen, Cassian began assembling a squad of Rebel assassins, mercenaries, and soldiers to go and fight on Scarif to retrieve the plans, going directly against the wishes of High Command. Meeting Jyn in the hangar, Andor confessed that neither he nor the rebels he gathered could live with themselves if they turned back now and said that they were willing to go with her to fight. Baze, Chirrut, Bodhi, and K-2SO also joined them. Together, they took the stolen Imperial shuttle and left for Scarif, with Rook piloting. When an air traffic control officer contacted Rook and asked what he was doing flying the ship, which had not been authorized for takeoff, Andor told him that he had to lie, and although Rook temporarily stumbled, he eventually said that their squad, \"Rogue One,\" was lifting off.[6]\n\nRook was able to use Imperial clearance codes to pass the Shield Gate that protected the planet and steered the shuttle to Landing Platform Nine. There, Andor gave command of the troops to Sergeant Ruescott Melshi, instructing them to place explosives around the landing sites that surrounded the Citadel Tower. Meanwhile, after ambushing a trio of Imperials who came aboard to inspect their ship, Andor joined Jyn in stealing their uniforms, dressing as an Imperial officer, and infiltrating the facility with K-2SO.[6]\n\nInside, K-2 accessed another droid to find a map to reach the plans. When they neared the area where the plans were kept, Andor was contacted by Melshi, who told him that the soldiers outside were ready to go. Andor gave the command to blow the charges, and a widespread firefight began outside as a full garrison on Imperial troops were deployed to fight the invaders. Meanwhile, as Andor and Jyn attempted to retrieve the plans, a group of stormtroopers arrived and discovered that K-2, who was left outside to watch, was an enemy. K-2 sealed Andor and Jyn inside to protect them and sacrificed himself in a fight against several stormtroopers.[6]\n\nAs troopers began to attempt to breach the doors, Andor and Jyn decided to retrieve the plans by hand instead of using the mechanism and began to climb to reach them. When Krennic made his way inside, he shot Andor, who fell as Jyn continued to climb upwards to escape through a hatch. Andor survived and limped his way after Jyn, who had ascended to the top of the citadel to transmit the plans to the rebel fleet that had arrived over Scarif. After Jyn avoided a TIE, she was about to transmit the plans when Krennic arrived again. However, before he could kill Jyn, Andor saved her and shot Krennic, wounding him and escaping with Jyn.[6]\n\nSeeking to ensure the plans would fall into the hands of those who could change the tide of the struggle against the Empire,[18] Andor and Jyn beamed the plans to the fleet and went back to the beach where many of their rebel comrades lay dead. As they knelt on the sand, they watched as the Death Star fired at Scarif and destroyed the base. Cassian told Jyn that her father would be very proud of her. The two then accepted their fate and shared a final embrace before they were killed in the resulting blast.[6]\n\nWith his bravery having helped to turn the tide of the conflict between the Empire and the Rebellion, Andor became a hero to the Rebel Alliance. Although the path towards victory was littered with the emotional costs soldiers like Andor had paid by compromising on their morals, he had helped change the course of the Rebellion[18] and history as a whole.[61] After Rogue One transmitted the plans to their fellow rebels,[6] the intel was used to eventually destroy the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin[61], ironically the station he had indirectly helped create during his time on Narkina Five.[11] As the Galactic Civil War wore on, Luke Skywalker, the pilot who had destroyed the Death Star, named a new starfighter group Rogue Squadron in honor of Andor's team.[62]\n\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, a rebel group known as the Shrikes were ambushed on Taanab by agents of the ISB. The Alliance captured a transmission from Hutt Space from the sole survivor, Caluan Ematt. In a memo to Mothma, Draven wished Andor were alive, as he would have been Draven's first pick to extract Ematt and bring him to safety for his knowledge and expertise of the Hutt underworld.[59]\n\nA good rebel agent who held dark secrets,[7] Andor was a human male standing at 1.78 meters tall,[5] with brown-black hair and brown eyes.[6] He held a reputation for having striking good looks, which he used to lure in the unsuspecting during his service as a Rebel spy.[63]\n\nAs a young man, Andor kept his origins close to his chest, officially denoting that he hailed from the planet Fest instead of revealing the true nature of his childhood on Kenari. However, he did trust some close friends and romantic partners with the truth, including Bix Caleen. He did not tell many, but he also did not keep track of everyone that he told.[23] Although he had needed to leave her behind[22] years prior,[1] Andor also never forgot his sister Kerri[22] and actively searched for her. He was prone to owing various individuals money, at one point being in debt to Nurchi and Brasso, the latter of whom he was more keen to pay back due to being good friends with the man.[1]\n\nHe also had a reputation of being something of a womanizer. When trying to explain away a mysterious injury to Caleen, the latter wondered if it may have been caused by a jealous husband.[1] When Andor's mother Maarva was trying to figure out who knew that Andor was born on Kenari, she stated that she was worried about \"all his women,\" naming some of them before admitting that there were some names that even she did not know.[23] Arvel Skeen was quick to inform Andor that their fellow Aldhani rebel infiltration team member Cinta Kaz was already \"sharing a blanket.\"[31] Andor eventually developed into[64][65] a selfless man, which set him apart from other, more extreme rebels who blurred the same lines as him.[18]\n\nAs a Rebel, Andor was a committed, steady, practical, and by-the-book intelligence officer with a fair amount of combat experience,[6] but that experience grew from missions that sometimes blurred the line between what was morally wrong or right. Despite his selflessness,[18] he was cold and distant to others.[7] Andor often kept quiet and reserved, a trait he had acquired due to his experience in war. Although fighting on the side of the Rebel Alliance, he'd been hardened by war to the point that he did not hesitate to commit morally questionable acts when necessary.[6] During those days of the early rebel movement, he relied on the excuse that he was following orders to justify what he had done.[18]\n\nAlthough he displayed some degree of remorse and regret after some of his actions—such as his choice to execute Tivik during the mission to the Ring of Kafrene—it was never enough to convince him to seek redemption until his adventure with Jyn Erso.[6] Nevertheless, he was more morally conflicted than fellow insurgent Saw Gerrera, who also went to great lengths to uncover intelligence on topics, particularly weapons, that threatened the Rebels.[18] In a briefing to Mothma, General Draven described Andor as \"one of the most capable agents within Rebel Intelligence,\" with the ability to handle a wide range of missions, from reconnaissance to assassination and sabotage. Draven also said that Andor was capable of analyzing intelligence and acting on that intelligence without the need to contact superiors. Draven indicated that, since Andor worked for the rebellion since childhood, that the Alliance was like his family and that his loyalty was unwavering. Mothma, however, worried about the terrible things Andor and other Rebel agents were asked to do in the name of the Rebellion.[66] Indeed, many of the missions he carried out for the Alliance were morally questionable.[18] Mothma wondered if the command was doing enough to help agents like Andor to cope with the psychological damage inflicted by their actions.[66]\n\nComprising on their morals in the name of victory was dreadful for the emotional health of Rebels like Andor. In truth, Andor had been driven to the extremes he carried out by the anguish he carried inside him. Having lost everything in his life, Andor was able to hold back thinking about his morally questionable actions[18] until his time with Erso.[6] Whether it was due to killing Tivik or a change in his outlook due to the adventure he had with Erso,[18] he disobeyed orders to kill Galen Erso[6] before revealing his internal anguish by arguing with Jyn; she compared him to a stormtrooper for following orders he thought were wrong,[18] which made him burst out in anger because of all he had done in the name of rebellion.[6] In the end, Andor's selflessness[18] and regret for his past actions[6] led to him joining the ragtag Rogue One mission.[18] Meeting Erso and joining that mission helped Andor remember why he became a Rebel agent in the first place.[7] Paying the ultimate sacrifice he could in the apogee of his selfless devotion to the Rebel Alliance[18] and wanting to bring a new hope to the galaxy, Andor willingly gave his life[7] to ensure the Death Star plans were given to those who could use them to win the war.[18]\n\nAndor found that gathering intelligence required more than spying alone. He was an expert in espionage, sabotage, and assassination throughout his missions.[18] Andor was a committed soldier and fighter, rebelling against various regimes over the course of his life. Although sometimes he questioned his actions, he accepted that he did what had to be done in the name of a good cause. He was prepared to double-cross allies to get the job done. On one occasion, he killed his informant Tivik instead of risking letting him be captured by Imperial forces.[6]\n\nAndor was often an unassuming man that his opponents would underestimate. After killing two Corpos on Morlana One, the Preox-Morlana sent a squad after him, with Linus Mosk warning the group not to underestimate Andor.[23]\n\nPrior to joining the Rebellion, Andor wielded an MW-20 Bryar pistol, which was wielded by his adopted father Clem Andor years earlier.[8] Andor carried Karn's blaster for a time. During the preparation for a mission on Aldhani, Arvel Skeen became suspicious of Andor after seeing the corporate-issue blaster and questioned Andor as to whom it belonged to.[31] After the mission, Andor stashed the weapon away in a hidden box on Niamos, where it was left after he was arrested and detained in the Narkina 5 Imperial Prison Complex.[68] When Andor later returned to the planet with Ruescott Melshi after their escape from Narkina 5, he retrieved the box and handed the blaster off to Melshi before the two parted ways.[41]\n\nAs a member of the Rebellion, Andor wore a brown Corellian-cut field jacket that depicted his military rank and also held a personal identifier transponder that concealed a suicide pill. He also wore brown military fatigues. On Jedha and Eadu he used a blue-colored coat with fur lining. Andor owned a UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft called the LMTR-20.[6]\n\nHe carried a canvas bag over one shoulder on the Ring of Kafrene and a backpack on Jedha. Andor carried an A-180 blaster before Erso stole it.[6] Due to his years of law-bending, Andor had honed his escapology skills, and he carried a compact security kit hidden inside one of his boots.[5]\n\nCassian was capable with a variety of blasters. He primarily wielded a BlasTech A280-CFE blaster—a versatile, modular heavy blaster pistol that could be reconfigured into an assault rifle or sniper rifle by adding a barrel and stock attachments, which he carried in a thigh holster. On the Ring of Kafrene, Andor killed Tivik and a pair of stormtroopers with a concealed blaster pistol of unidentified model. He used the same weapon to dispatch Krennic during the Battle of Scarif.[6]\n\nCassian Jeron Andor, portrayed by Diego Luna, is a character created and developed for the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Luna's casting in the film was first announced on August 15, 2015. At this time, the first photo of the character was released,[69] and the first footage of the character was shown in the Rogue One teaser trailer on April 7, 2016.[70]\n\nLuna spoke with his natural Mexican accent while playing Andor.[71] When Luna jumped to the tower[72] in the Scarif vault,[6] he broke his rib but did not notice it. He did not tell anyone about his injury.[72] After Rogue One's release, Luna shared a story from a fan who took her Mexican father to see the film because of his accent, which he said made him emotional.[71]\n\nThe younger Cassian Andor as seen in the episode \"Kassa\" was played by Antonio Viña.[1]\n\nBy 2018, Lucasfilm has begun developing a television series set before Rogue One which starred Andor and K-2SO. They would be similar to the film characters Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and they would storm the Citadel. After viewing the script sent by Lucasfilm,[74] Rogue One writer[6] Tony Gilroy thought the material was fine but hard to sustain over a long run. He then wrote a forensic manifesto explaining why the idea would not work and what Lucasfilm should do instead.[74] Gilroy explained that the show should have a large hole that Andor climbs out of over the course of five years. Gilroy added that Andor's journey should not involve escapades with K-2SO because it could get repetitive.[75] Gilroy's idea became the Star Wars: Andor television series,[74] which was called \"The Education of Cassian Andor\" during early development.[76] The show would explore Andor's backstory, revealing how he changed from a nihilist into a selfless martyr. Gilroy wanted the first season to explain why Andor sacrificed himself in Rogue One.[77] When Gilroy was conceptualizing Andor's larger story arc, he started to map out a narrative journey for Andor that would feel compelling and complete. This included showing Andor at a low point in his life at a time when the Empire was gaining power across the galaxy.[78] Gilroy used Andor's story to depict the intertwining lives of common people as they orbit around the formation of the Rebel Alliance.[74]\n\nTo create a 24-episode series spanning five years, the show's directors worked in blocks of three episodes with Season One having four blocks.[79] Gilroy realized that maintaining the show's scope for four more seasons would be overwhelming, so he and executive producer Sanne Wohlenberg decided to use the same structure used in Season One.[74] For Season Two, Gilroy and the crew decided to use each block to represent a year, which Gilroy found to be very exciting from a narrative point of view.[79]\n\nGilroy was drawn to the idea of a story spanning Andor's childhood origin and a five-year history that takes him to a revolution.[80] The show had Andor stop pretending he is not affected by the Empire and choose who he is going to be. Gilroy used Andor's line about being in this fight since he was six years old as a jumping off point to create Kenari.[76] Andor's murder of[81] Kravas Drezzer and Verlo Skiff in the episode \"Kassa\"[1] was meant to show that he is a survivor in an oppressive galaxy with no sense of justice. Andor's decision to spare Syril Karn was meant to show that he learns from his mistakes.[81] Giloy wanted to have Melshi in the show, so he figured that the Narkina 5 prison was a great place to show where and how they met.[82] During the writers' room in November, 2019, Gilroy told the writers he was interested in seeing Andor escape during a prison sequence.[83] In an early iteration of the story, Andor and the prisoners would steal the guards' boots to escape the prison[84] on Narkina 5.[39] Writer Beau Willimon said the goal of the prison episodes was to make Andor feel the Empire's oppression in a serious, sustained, and inescapable way. He viewed Andor as a recruiter for Kino Loy in a similar way to how Luthen Rael recruited Andor.[85] Concept art depicting Andor was created by concept artists Vincent Jenkins, Chester Carr, Peter McKinstry.[86] and Luke Hull.[87]\n\nIn mid-2019, Gilroy called Diego Luna and told him the full plan for an Andor-focused story. Luna was glad that Gilroy's proposal included details that resonated personally with him[77] and he was convinced by Gilroy's ground-level approach.[74] At the end of the call, Luna agreed to reprise his role in the series.[77] He then talked about returning for two or three years before shooting started.[88] Luna was excited to explore the darker side of Andor's psyche, as well as to show the nuance and complexity of a younger version of the character.[78] To prepare for reprising his role, Luna imagined aspects of Andor's history that never made it into Rogue One, and he used that as background to bring the character to life. He and Gilroy discussed this as the scripts came together, helping to personalize Andor for the actor. Luna thought about people who are forced to run due to outside pressures, but decide to stop and make a stand.[89]\n\nCostume designer Michael Wilkinson was tasked with making Andor someone who can disappear by hiding in his clothes but still be compelling, have \"some swagger,\" and be something the audience is drawn to. Wilkinson decided that the arc of Andor's costumes would begin with him hiding in his clothes due to being a mess-up. As the series progressed, Andor shed his layers a little bit and his silhouette became more tailored with longer lines, and his shoulders became square. This was intended to show Andor is subtly becoming the character he is in Rogue One.[90] The Aldhani rebels' disguises were made using natural fabrics. Wilkinson made the costumes very dark, textural, and organic.[91]\n\nProduction began in late November of 2020.[92] Scenes on Ferrix were filmed in an intricate set in Little Marlow, Buckinghamshire.[78] According to Tony Gilroy, everything on Ferrix was filmed first.[93] As Luna spent more time on set, he started to enjoy the process more and fall in love with his character,[73] and he did not enjoy playing the role until the third or fourth day. He felt that his costume was either too big or too small.[88] The actor managed to embody a rash and more impulsive Andor with a younger mindset.[78] Luna aimed to let audiences understand his character and explain how six-year-old Andor got wrapped up in a rebellion. He said that the trick is in telling a story that people can connect with and explaining how Andor got to where he was in Rogue One.[73] Luna found it very important to understand that the show depicts a childish version of Andor who is unaware of the consequences of his actions.[81]\n\nThe rehearsals between Luna and Fiona Shaw, the actress who played Maarva Andor, were limited to what could be conveyed through a mask due to COVID-19 production protocols. One of the first scenes filmed with Luna and Shaw was an argument between their characters in the Andor household.[94] Luna found it very important for young Andor to be played by a Mexican actor to show that the two actors shared something.[81] Young Andor was played by Antonio Viña in flashback scenes.[1] When Viña flew to London for his last session, Luna made sure that he was the right actor for the role. Luna noticed that Viña does a lot with his eyes, which Luna found very important for the role.[81] Scenes on Aldhani were filmed at the Cruachan Dam and the surrounding mountains in the Scottish Highlands.[78] According to Faye Marsay, Vel Sartha's actress, the scenes were filmed during the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.[95] According to Sanne Wohlenberg, the Narkina 5 prison scenes were filmed last before the wrap of Season One.[96] When Andor and the other prisoners arrived at the prison, all of the actors choreographed their convulsions to happen when the lights changed.[97] Andy Serkis, the actor that played Kino Loy, said that all of the actors would walk on metal plates for with bare feet, which drained their energy.[98]\n\nSpeaking at Celebration Anaheim, Luna stated \"You're not going to recognize Cassian Andor in the beginning. I cannot wait for you to meet him\" when discussing his character's journey,[99] revealing that Andor would start off the show as a selfish character before undergoing an awakening that transforms him into the man seen in Rogue One.[64] The series' logo, title, and a behind the scenes video for the series was revealed on December 10, 2020 at a Disney investors meeting.[92][100] Tony Gilroy had a long-game plan of how the season would get to the fifth year in terms of Andor's story.[83] The show's two seasons will be the last time Luna plays Andor in Star Wars.[101] Michael Wilkinson worked on Andor's new look in the second season.[91] On December 9, 2022, Luna announced on Twitter that he was currently filming the second season of Andor.[102] For his performance in Andor, Luna was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Actor - Drama Series.[103]\n\nAndor has multiple equivalent characters in the Star Wars Legends continuity. 2016's Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide mentions that Andor used the codename \"Aach\" as a senatorial contact on Darkknell.[5] The codename originated in the 1999 Legends short story \"Interlude at Darkknell\" by Timothy Zahn and Michael A. Stackpole, where it was used by a Human male agent of Senator Bail Organa who met with Senator Garm Bel Iblis and informed him about Organa's discovery of the construction of the Death Star.[104] The 2008 Star Wars Roleplaying Game supplement The Force Unleashed Campaign Guide mentioned that a bodyguard had escorted Mon Mothma[105] into hiding from Coruscant,[106] a role that Cassian would play in the 2025 Andor episode \"Welcome to the Rebellion.\"[14]\n\nStar Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide states that Cassian Andor was born on Fest, 26 years before the events of Rogue One,[5] which corresponds to 26 BBY.[25] This was repeated in later sources.[107][108][7][109][110][111] However, with the release of Andor in 2022, the titular character's place of birth was confirmed to be Kenari.[1] Thereafter, Andor's updated Databank entry on StarWars.com states that the character was nine years old when he was taken off Kenari,[21] while the StarWars.com Episode Guide for the \"Reckoning\" episode of Andor, released on September 21, 2022, states that the Confederacy of Independent Systems had yet to be formed and the Clone Wars was yet to be fought at the time of the character's departure from Kenari.[17] Since previous sources establish that the Confederacy was formed in either 24 BBY or 22 BBY and the Clone Wars started in 22 BBY,[112] this article assumes that Cassian Andor must have been born no later than nine years before 24 BBY, or 33 BBY, making the previously stated birth year of 26 BBY impossible. Indeed, the later reference book Star Wars: Dawn of Rebellion: The Visual Guide helped narrow down Andor's birthdate to 33 BBY.[3]\n\nAndor Season 2 provides its own explanation of how Andor met the droid K-2SO[14] that disregards the story told in the one-shot comic Rogue One - Cassian & K-2SO Special 1.[113] Series creator Tony Gilroy was aware of the comic, however chose not to adapt the events, instead choosing to write a new origin for K2.[114] In that comic, Cassian proposed a mission to Draven to recover Imperial protocols on Wecacoe. Draven suggested that Cassian take the twins Kertas and Rismor, who were renowned for their skill in gathering Imperial intelligence. However, the twins did not speak much, as they communicated via smell. The team expected a limited Imperial presence due to the fact that Wecacoe was a backwater planet, but upon arriving, they found the facility guarded by swarms of KX-series security droids and stormtroopers, Cassian imagined Alliance High Command ordering him to turn back, but, determined not to end up empty-handed, decided to proceed. The team slipped into a sewage pipe and entered the storage facility to find an abandoned Imperial cruiser. Unfortunately, they were spotted entering the tunnels and stormtroopers began investigating the area using surveillance cameras.[113]\n\nWhile they were hurriedly searching for data, Cassian looked for another way out. Suddenly, an alarm rang out and the team was forced to flee. Since there were too many troops along the perimeter, Cassian decided to distract one of the security droids, K-2SO, and then shut him down. The droid pinned him, but then the twins shut him down and removed his memory. K-2SO escorted the spies to their ship, but they were soon intercepted by stormtroopers. When they arrived at their ship, they found it surrounded by troopers. Both of the twins ran off, telling him that K-2 had all the info they needed. Suddenly, their ship exploded. Cassian realized that he had to get rid of the base programming to have the droid as an ally, and deleted the last memories. The pair than ran to a ship and hijacked it. Then, Cassian took the droid back to ship to learn the new Imperial security protocols.[113]",
