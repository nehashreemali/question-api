  "script": "1 My planet Arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low. Rolling over the sands... you can see spice in the air. At nightfall, the spice harvesters land. The outsiders race against time to avoid the heat of the day. They ravage our lands in front of our eyes. Their cruelty to my people is all I've known. These outsiders, the Harkonnens, came long before I was born. By controlling spice production, they became obscenely rich. Richer than the Emperor himself. Our warriors couldn't free Arrakis from the Harkonnens, but one day, by Imperial decree, they were gone. Why did the Emperor choose this path? And who will our next oppressors be? It's good you're up early. Your father wants you in full dress before the Emperor's Herald arrives. Full dress? Military? - Ceremonial. Why do we have to go through all this when it's already been decided? Ceremony. Mm. Thank you. If you want it, make me give it to you. Use the Voice. Mom, I just woke up. Give me the water. The glass can't hear you. Command me. Give me the water. Almost. Almost? Bene Gesserit skills take years to learn, Paul. - Mm-hmm. - You look tired. More dreams? No. Extreme temperatures and treacherous weather events make life outside the cities of Arrakis truly hostile, with sandstorms powerful enough to cut through metal. Only the native tribes known as the Fremen have adapted well enough to survive. Preferring to inhabit the remotest regions of Arrakis, the Fremen share the deep desert with the giant sandworms known to the Fremen as Shai-Hulud. Long exposure to spice has given the tribe their characteristic blue eyes, the Eyes of Ibad. Little else is known of the Fremen, except that they are dangerous and unreliable. Fremen attacks make spice harvesting extremely hazardous. For the Fremen, spice is the sacred hallucinogen which preserves life and brings enormous health benefits. For the Imperium, spice is used by the navigators of the Spacing Guild to find safe paths between the stars. Without spice, interstellar travel is impossible, making it by far the most valuable substance in the universe. Smile, Gurney. I am smiling. How much will it cost them, traveling all this way for this formality? Three Guild Navigators. A total of 1.46 million, 62 solaris, round trip. By the grace of Shaddam IV of House Corrino, ascendant to the Golden Lion Throne of Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe, I stand before you as Herald of the Change. We are witnessed by members of the Imperial Court, representatives of the Spacing Guild and a sister of the Bene Gesserit. The Emperor has spoken. \"House Atreides shall immediately take control of Arrakis and serve as its steward.\" Do you accept? We are House Atreides. There is no call we do not answer, there is no faith that we betray. The Emperor asks us to bring peace to Arrakis. House Atreides accepts. Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Your seal. So, it's done? It's done. How was it? Stabilizers are too loose. - We'll dial it in. - Thank you, my friend. Got it. Duncan. My boy. - Hey. Hey. Paul, my boy. So, you're going to Arrakis tomorrow. With the advance team. Yes, I'm going to Arrakis tomorrow with the advance team. I'd like you to take me with you. You would? Well, that's too bad. 'Cause no. Duncan. Are you trying to get me court-martialed? What's going on? Can I trust you with something? Always. You know that. I've been having dreams. About Arrakis and the Fremen. Okay. So? I saw you. With the Fremen. Ah. So, I do find them. There you go. That's a good omen right there, right? Lanville! I saw you lying dead. Fallen in battle. It felt like if I had been there, you'd be alive. First off, I'm not gonna die. You're not taking me seriously. That's why you want to come with me. Listen. Dreams make good stories, but everything important happens when we're awake. 'Cause that's when we make things happen. Look at you. Put on some muscle? I did? No. Hey. See you on Arrakis, my boy. Father, I'd like to ask to join Duncan Idaho on his scout mission to Arrakis tomorrow. I've studied the Fremen language, I'd be an asset. Out of the question. You'll travel in a few weeks to Arrakis, like the rest of us. I've been training my whole life. What is the point if I'm not allowed - to face some actual risk? - You know why, Paul. You're the future of House Atreides. And Grandfather fought bulls for sport! Yes. And look where that got him. I need you by my side. When we get to Arrakis, we'll face enormous danger. What danger? The Fremen? The desert? Political danger. The Great Houses look to us for leadership, and this threatens the Emperor. By taking Arrakis from the Harkonnens and making it ours, he sets the stage for a war which would weaken both houses. But if we hold firm, and tap the true power of Arrakis, we could be stronger than ever. What does that mean? Mining spice, keeping the Fremen in their place? - We'd be no better than Harkonnens. - No. By making an alliance with the Fremen. That's what I've sent Duncan Idaho to arrange. Here on Caladan, we've ruled by air power and sea power. On Arrakis, we need to cultivate desert power. I want you sitting in on my Council. Learn what I do. What if I'm not, Dad? Not what? The future of House Atreides. I told my father I didn't want this either. I wanted to be a pilot. You never told me that. Your grandfather said, \"A great man doesn't seek to lead. He's called to it, and he answers.\" And if your answer is no... you'll still be the only thing I ever needed you to be... my son. I found my own way to it. Maybe you'll find yours. In their memory... give it a try. Don't stand with your back to the door. How many times do we have to tell you? I could tell it was you by your footsteps, Gurney Halleck. Someone might imitate my stride. I know the difference. Are you the new Weapons Master? With Duncan Idaho gone, I must make do as best I can. Choose your blade. I've had quite a day, Gurney. Give us a song instead. That's rude. Come on. Come on. Old man. Ah, the slow blade penetrates the shield. I guess I'm not in the mood today. - Mood? - Yeah. What's mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises, no matter the mood. Now fight! Come on! - I have you. Aye. But look down, my lord. You'd have joined me in death. I see you found the mood. Will it be that bad? You don't get it, do you? You don't really understand the grave nature of what's happening to us. For 80 years, Arrakis belonged to House Harkonnen. 80 years of owning the spice fields. Can you imagine the wealth? Your eyes. I need to see it in your eyes. You never met Harkonnens before, I have. They're not human, they're brutal! You have to be ready. Lord Baron. Rabban. The last of our ships have left Arrakis. It's done. Very good. Uncle, how can we let this happen? How can the Emperor... ...take everything we've built and give it to that Duke? How? Don't be too sure it's an act of love. What does he mean? When is a gift not a gift? The Atreides' voice is rising, and the Emperor is a jealous man. A dangerous, jealous man. Paul. Paul, wake up. What's wrong? Get dressed and come with me. What is this? The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is here. She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. She's now Truthsayer to the Emperor himself. She would like to meet you. Why? She wants to know about your dreams. How does she know about my dreams? And why is Dr. Yueh here? He only needs a moment. Hello, young master. Your mother asked me to check your vitals. What's happening? His heart is strong as ever, my lady. Paul... Who are you? Defiance in the eyes. Like his father. Leave us. You must do everything the Reverend Mother tells you. You dismiss my mother in her own house. Come here. Kneel. How dare you use the Voice on me? Put your right hand in the box. Your mother bade you obey me. I hold at your neck the Gom Jabbar. A poison needle. Instant death. The test is simple. Remove your hand from the box and you die. What's in the box? Pain. - No need to call the guards. Your mother stands behind that door. No one would get past her. Why are you doing this? An animal caught in a trap will gnaw off its own leg to escape. What will you do? - Silence. I must not fear. I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings obliteration. And I'll face my fear and I'll permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past... I will turn the inner eye and see its path. And where the fear has gone, there will be nothing. Only I will remain. Enough. Like sifting sand through a screen, we sift people. If you had been unable to control your impulses, like an animal, we could not let you live. You inherit too much power. What, because I'm a duke's son? Because you are Jessica's son. You have more than one birthright, boy. Jessica? You've been training him in the Way. Tell me about these dreams. - I had one tonight. - What did you see? A girl. On Arrakis. Have you dreamt of her before? Many times. Do you often dream things that happen just as you dreamed them? Not exactly. Goodbye, young human. I hope you live. Did you have to go that far? You chose to train him in the Way, in defiance of our rule. He wields our power. He had to be tested to the limits. So much potential, wasted in a male. You were told to bear only daughters. But you, in your pride, thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach. Was I wrong? You're lucky he didn't die in that room. If he is The One, he has a long way to go. His Sight is barely awakened, and now he goes into the fire. But our plans are measured in centuries. We have other prospects if he fails his promise. Do you see so little hope? On Arrakis, we have done all we can for you. A path has been laid. Let's hope he doesn't squander it. Paul. What does it mean? That I could be The One? You heard. The Bene Gesserit serve as powerful partners to the Great Houses, but there's more to it. You steer the politics of the Imperium from the shadows. I know. You don't know everything. For thousands of years, we've been carefully crossing bloodlines - to bring forth... - The One? A mind... powerful enough to bridge space and time. Past and future. Who can help us into a better future. We think he's very close now. Some believe he's here. All part of a plan. Shield. \"My lungs taste the air of Time, Blown past falling sand...\" Thufir Hawat. Young master! How does it feel to walk on a new world? Exciting, to say the least. My lord. How are you, old friend? My advance team has secured the city. We're still smoothing out a few rough spots. My lady. Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Don't be fooled by the welcome. They follow their old masters' rules. Mandatory attendance. That's Harkonnen love out there. Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Let's get you out of the sun. The heat can kill in this place. They were pointing at us. What are they shouting? Lisan al-Gaib. \"Voice from the Outer World.\" It's their name for \"messiah.\" It means the Bene Gesserit have been at work here. Planting superstitions. Preparing the way, Paul. These people have waited for centuries for the Lisan al-Gaib. They see you, they see the signs. They see what they've been told to see. We're good to go. Shield Wall. Protects the city from the weather and the worms. The locals call the big one the Hand of God. Well, the Hand of God is wreaking havoc on our comms system. It's so quiet. Yeah. That's what worries me, too. There's the spaceport and that plume of dust there is the spice refinery. Our two most vulnerable points. I want you guarding them. If we can't refine spice and ship it off-world, - we're dead here. - My lord. The sun's getting too high. We need to seal the doors. What do they say about this hellhole again? \"To shower, you scrub your ass with sand,\" my lord. That's what they say. That's what they say. Candidates for a housekeeper, my lady. What is your name? Shadout Mapes, my lady. The rest of you may go. Thank you. Shadout. It's an old Chakobsa word. \"Well-dipper.\" You know the ancient tongues? I know many things. I know that you have a weapon concealed in your bodice. If you mean to harm me, I must warn you, whatever you're hiding, it won't be enough. The weapon is meant as a gift if you are truly The One. Do you know this? It's a crysknife. Do you know its meaning? It's a maker... A maker of the deep desert. When you have lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock. Lisan al-Gaib. The mother and the son. It is yours. Tooth of Shai-Hulud. Lisan! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Hello. You shouldn't be out here at this hour of the day. They're out here. Hmm. Fremen pilgrims. They don't care about heatstroke. I didn't know date palms could even be found out here. Oh, these aren't indigenous. They can't survive without me. Each one of these drinks every day the equivalent of five men. Twenty palm trees. A hundred lives. Should we remove them? Save the water? No, no, no. These are sacred. Old dream. The largest and most dangerous organism on Arrakis is the sandworm, capable of reaching 400 meters in length. To avoid making rhythmic noises, which attract the sandworms, the Fremen cross desert spaces using the sandwalk, a dance-like motion with irregular rhythm which emulates the natural sounds of the desert. What scant plant life exists on Arrakis is thanks to the Fremen, who have cultivated deep-rooted terranic plants such as saguaro, burrobush, sand-verbena and incense bush. The shepherd's tree has the deepest documented roots, stretching more than 450 feet deep. These plants cling to life in a parched, nutrient-poor landscape. It's a hunter-seeker. The operator must be nearby. The Harkonnen agent was cemented into that hole six weeks ago. Ran the hunter-seeker through a waterpipe inside the walls. Sire, I failed you today. There's no excuse. You have my resignation. You would deprive us of your talents at this time? Sire, my honor demands... They tried to take the life of my son! I don't give a damn about your honor. You want absolution? Go catch some spies. Your Grace. The thing must leave. You can speak without fear. Our pet doesn't understand your language. Get out. It understands. Activate silence. It must never be known. There's no satellites over Arrakis. The Atreides will die in the dark. On that matter, Duke Leto Atreides means nothing to our order. But his wife is under our protection and by extension, her son. Allow them the dignity of exile. House Harkonnen would never dream of violating the sanctity of your order. I give you my word. We will not harm them. If the Duke's son lives... No Atreides will live. My lord, you gave your word to the witch. She sees too much. I said I would not harm them. And I shall not. But Arrakis is Arrakis. And the desert takes the weak. My desert. My Arrakis. My Dune. Your first strategy meeting. Paul Atreides, who catches hunter-seekers in his bare hands like a hero of old. Thanks for the humiliation, old man. Gotta keep an eye on you. Attention! Let's get started. Thufir. Operations. I secured a copy of the Harkonnens' account books. The Harkonnens were taking 10 billion solaris out of here every year. \"They shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and the treasure hid in the sand.\" We won't see profits like that for a while. Not with the equipment they left us. How bad is it? These are spice silos. We're meant to fill every crate. All of them? Every 25 standard days. Harkonnen sabotage slows us down. But who's meant to arbitrate? Isn't there a Judge of the Change to oversee the transition? Who did the Emperor appoint? Dr. Liet Kynes. Imperial Ecologist. Been here 20 years. Eccentric, from what I'm told. I want to see these harvesting fields myself. I wouldn't recommend it, my lord. Have this Judge of the Change accompany us. A meeting's long overdue. And we'll get a bit of Imperial protection. A hostage. I love it. Hmm. - He's here, my lord. Take care of them. They are friends. Duncan! Ah! My boy! I swear you're getting taller. Well, you smell much worse. For four weeks, I lived with the Fremen. Hidden in the desert, in a community called a sietch. Stilgar, the leader of that sietch, has come with me to meet you, sire. This sietch, how is it hidden? It's underground. Arrakis is filled with caverns. How big was the place? I'd say 10,000 people. And there are hundreds of sietches. Millions of Fremen. You were right. The Harkonnen estimate was 50,000 on the whole planet. The Fremen watched me search for them for days. I never saw them. Finally, they sent a warrior out to kill me. And I gotta tell you, I have never come so close to dying. There's no finer fighter in the Imperium. They fight like demons. Desert power. Duncan. - Well done. - Thank you, my lord. Sire. Their leader has a knife he won't surrender, sire. It's a crysknife. It's sacred to his people. Let him pass. Stop there. Hey! Hey! Mm. Stilgar. Welcome. Sir, I respect the personal dignity of any man that respects mine. Hmm. Hold. Thank you, Stilgar, for the gift of your body's moisture. We accept it in the spirit in which it was given. I'm glad you've come. I believe your people and mine have much to offer one another. No, no, you are Outworlders. You come here for the spice, you take it, giving nothing in return. That's true. I know you've suffered at the hands of the Harkonnen. Name what you want. If it's in my power to grant, I'll give it and ask for nothing. Mm. I ask for this. Do not seek our sietches. Do not trespass in our lands. The desert was ours long before you came. So, come and dig your spice, but when you have it, go back to this side of the Shield Wall and leave the desert to the Fremen. You will address the Duke as \"my lord\" or \"sire.\" Gurney, just... just a moment. The Emperor has given me Arrakis as my fief to rule and protect. I cannot promise not to travel into the desert if duty compels me. But your sietches will be yours forever. And you will never be hunted while I govern here. That's very honorable. I must go. That's all I have to say to you. Won't you stay? We would honor you. Honor requires that I be elsewhere. I don't like him. Our plan bears fruit. But it will take time? Yes. It will take time. Here, this is for you. It's a paracompass. The moons here have a magnetic field, so... a simple compass needle won't point north. Takes a clever piece of clockwork to sort it out. The Fremen make these? And stillsuits, and sand compactors, and all kinds of ingenious things. What the hell is a sand compactor? That's a sand compactor. My God, man, you've gone native. You admire them. I do. They're fierce but loyal. They're attuned to the desert. Part of it. It's part of them. You wait till you see it. It's beautiful out there. Sunrise warning, all workers. Temperature today will reach 140 degrees. We are currently 90 degrees, and in 10 minutes, we will hit 120 degrees. Last warning call. The Judge of the Change, sire. Dr. Liet Kynes. My lord Duke. Welcome to Arrakis. You're the Imperial Ecologist. Thank you for the stillsuits. They are of Fremen make. The best. With your permission, sire, I must check the integrity of your suit... Whoa. It's all right. It's all right. Dr. Kynes, we're in your hands. A stillsuit is a high-efficiency filtration system. Even this early in the morning, you wouldn't survive two hours without one of these. It cools the body and recycles the water lost to sweat. Your body's movements provide the power. Inside the mask, you'll find a tube to allow you to drink the recycled water. Mm. In good working order, your suit won't lose more than a thimbleful of water a day. Most impressive. Let's have a look at you, lad. You've... worn a stillsuit before? No, this is my first time. Your desert boots are fitted slip-fashion at the ankles. Who taught you to do that? It seemed the right way. Are you Fremen? I am accepted in both sietch and village. Now, come and see the spice sands on which your livelihood depends. What would you do if your ornithopter went down out here? You wouldn't want to go down out there. It's worm territory. Dust cloud. I see it. That's one of your harvesters. You can see the spice scattered over the surface. A rich spice bed by the color. If you get a little higher, you'll have a better view. You see these spotter aircraft looking for wormsign. Wormsign? A sand wave moving toward the crawler. Worms travel deep but get closer to the surface when they attack. If you are patient, we should see one. A worm always comes? Always. They're drawn by rhythmic noises. Why don't we just shield the crawlers? A shield's a death sentence in the desert. It attracts the worms and drives them into a killing frenzy. Is that a worm? Big one. You have good eyes. Calling crawler Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Acknowledge. Who calls Delta Ajax niner? Over. They seem pretty calm about it. Unlisted flight. Imperium business. Wormsign north and east of you. 3.7 kilometers. Delta Ajax niner, this is Spotter One. Wormsign confirmed. Stand by for contact fix. Worm is on intercept course to your position. Contact in five minutes. So, what happens now? They'll call a carryall to lift the crawler. They'll harvest right up to the last minute. Calling carryall Alpha Zero. Ready for docking sequence. Contact five minutes. Over. Anybody got a visual on the carryall? There it is. This is carryall Alpha Zero to Delta Ajax niner. Approaching from your east. Correcting altitude and preparing docking equipment. Copy, Alpha Zero. Initiating docking sequence. T-5. Copy that. Prepare to be airborne in 30 seconds. Docking sequence initiated. Brace yourselves. Alpha Zero, we're short one point of contact. What is going on? It's one of the anchors. It's dead. Shit. Carryall unable to proceed. Unable to lift without that anchor. All call! All call! Any carryall in the sector, please respond! Spotter One, give us an update. Over. Hydraulics are dead. We won't make it. You have to evacuate. Contact in four minutes. Try it again! How many men on that crawler? Crew of 21. Our ships can take six each. That's still three short. We'll find a way. This is Duke Leto Atreides. We're coming down to extract the crew of Delta Ajax niner. We'll set down on the west. Shield generators weigh 100 kilos each. Yes, Gurney, have our escorts throw out the shield generators. Yes, sire. And, Paul, I want you at the back of the thopter. Guide them in. Delta Ajax niner, put seven men each in my ships now. Contact in two minutes. Getting close, guys. We better abandon ship now. Where are they? Sir, there's protocol for a reason. If we take one step out there, we're as good as dead. Besides, we've got a full load of spice. - We can't just leave it. - Damn the spice! I want every man off that crawler now! Hey! Hey! Seven over here, seven over there. Go! Go! Go! Kwisatz Haderach. Kwisatz Haderach awakes. Hurry! Get on! It's here! Paul! Paul! I recognize your footsteps, old man. Get up! Let's go! What's the matter with you? Come on! Let's go! Run! Hey! Bless the Maker and His Water. Bless the coming and going of Him. May His passage cleanse the world and keep the world for His people. Hey! - You cannot take such risks. - Yes, sir. You have responsibilities. I... I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again. Go. Dr. Kynes. You saw it. With your own eyes. It's plain to see. Everything they've left us is in shambles. We've been set up to fail. That carryall was just old. The desert isn't kind to equipment. You know what will happen if I don't get spice production back on track. I'm not here to take your part. Arrakis has seen men like you come and go. Take good care of your family. The desert's not kind to humans either. Spice is a psychoactive chemical. You seem to be sensitive. You'll be fine. Thank you, Dr. Yueh. That wasn't an allergic reaction. I had a vision. My eyes were wide open. What did you see? Kwisatz Haderach. You can see. It's confusing. I thought I saw my death, only it wasn't. I know a knife is important, somehow. Someone will hand me a blade, but I don't know who, or when, or where. Some things, though, are crystal clear. I can feel it. I know you're pregnant. You can't know that. I barely know that. It's only been a few weeks. Atreides legions are the finest in the Imperium. Trained by Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho. Just so. Three battalions. As agreed. There is something you need to know about Paul. No. Don't think I want to know. Ever since you brought him before your Reverend Mother, he hasn't been the same. He's distracted. Jessica, you gave me a son. And from the moment he was born, I never questioned you. I trusted you completely. Even when you walked in shadows. Now I'm asking you this one thing. If anything happens... will you protect our son? With my life. I'm not asking his mother. I'm asking the Bene Gesserit. Will you protect Paul? Why are you having these thoughts? Leto, this is not you. I thought we'd have more time. Have a good night, Master Paul. Good night, Dr. Yueh. You need to sleep. No. Not like that. I should have married you. Hawat. Security. Security. Sir. Sir. The shield's come down. God in heaven. Get everything with guns off the ground! Go! Go! Go! Go! With me! With me! Atreides! Atreides! - Sardaukar! - Sardaukar! I'm sorry, my lord. But I've made a bargain with the Baron. Why? I had no choice. The Harkonnens have my wife, Wanna. They take her apart like a doll. I will buy her freedom. And you are the price. For Paul. I will do what I can. And you will kill a man for me. I'm going to replace your peg tooth. If you bite down hard, this tooth will crush. Breathe out, and you will fill the air with poison. It will be your last breath. But if you choose your moment well, it will also be the Baron's. Paul. To hell, dogs! I've never had a highborn. You? Bene Gesserit ain't all highborn. She's highborn enough for me. Let's feed the kid to the worms. And give her a long goodbye. Don't you dare touch my mother. Don't talk. Remove her gag. Shut up. Remove her gag. Kill him. Set us free. Stop! Cut the rope. Give me the knife. Your pitch was too forced. It's a fremkit. They've crippled the ship. Mmm. Ah. You have a wonderful kitchen, cousin. This is Dr. Yueh's handwriting. \"If anyone makes it out of Arrakeen alive, there's an Atreides beacon in the fremkit. God willing, they'll be able to find you.\" My lord Baron. Dr. Yueh. The traitor. What do you want? I jammed their comms and lowered their shields. Hmm. I delivered the Duke and his family. The bargain to the letter. And what was I to do for you? Deliver my wife from her agony. Yes. I said I'd set her free. That you could join her. So, join her. What do you think is next? It's a thumper. No stillsuits. The one thing we actually need. For hundreds of years, we've traded blood for blood. But no more. Your son is dead. Your concubine is dead. Tonight the House of Atreides falls. And your bloodline ends forever. What did you say? Here I am... here I remain. Kynes! It's not safe for you here. Will you tell the Great Houses of the Landsraad how we were betrayed? How the best of them were murdered? I am commanded to say nothing. To see nothing. The Emperor sent us here to die. There's spice in the tent. That's the future. It's coming. Holy war spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire. Paul, you're scared. I can see it. Tell me, please, what do you fear? Somebody help me, please. Paul. It's coming. I see a holy war spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire. A warrior religion that waves the Atreides banner in my father's name. Paul. Fanatical legions worshipping at the shrine of my father's skull. A war in my name! Everyone's shouting my name! Paul. Paul Atreides. You are your father's son. You are my son. You are the Duke Paul Atreides. You know who you are. You know who you are. Get off me! You did this to me! You Bene Gesserit made me a freak! My father is dead. Someone's near. You need to drink. It's recycled water from the tent. Sweat and tears. All right, let's get out of here. That's Duncan. My lady. Paul. I'm so sorry. Your father... We know. My lord Duke. Here. Drink this. Harkonnens hit every population center on the planet at once. There must have been ten legions, hundreds of ships. There were Sardaukar with them. - At least two battalions. - What? Are you sure? You cross swords with a Sardaukar, you know it. So, the Emperor's taken a side. What says the Judge of the Change? The Emperor forbids me from saying anything at all. And yet you risk your life to help us. Storm's coming. The storm will be here in a few hours. We'll be safe here. Do you know what this place is? It's an old ecological testing station. They were meant to tame the planet. Free the water locked beneath the sands. Arrakis could have been a paradise. The work had begun, but then the spice was discovered. And suddenly no one wanted the desert to go away. Tanat, will you find stillsuits to fit our visitors? Yes, Liet. Shamir, a coffee service, please. Of course, Liet. - Who are you to the Fremen? You know what the Great Houses fear most, Dr. Kynes? Exactly what has happened to us here. The Sardaukar coming and picking them off one by one. Only together can they stand a chance against the Imperium. Would you bear witness? Testify that the Emperor has moved against us here? If they believe me, there would be general warfare between the Great Houses and the Emperor. Chaos across the Imperium. Suppose I presented the Emperor with an alternative to chaos. The Emperor has no sons. And his daughters have yet to marry. You'd make a play for the throne? The Emperor feared the Atreides. He brought you here to kill you. What don't you understand? You're a lost boy hiding in a hole in the ground. The Fremen speak of the Lisan al-Gaib. Careful. The Voice from the Outer World who will lead them to paradise. Superstition. I know you loved a Fremen warrior and lost him in battle. I know you walk in two worlds and are known by many names. I've seen your dream. As emperor, Dr. Kynes, I could make a paradise of Arrakis with a wave of my hand. Sardaukar! No! Duncan! Paul, no! - Duncan, no! - No! - No! - Paul, no! Duncan, no! - He's locked the door. - Duncan! No! He's gone. Duncan! We have to go. We have no choice. Paul, go! Paul! Come on. Come on, come on! Follow the light. You'll find a thopter ready to fly. That storm out there is your best shot. Above 5,000 meters, it's mostly dust. Climb into it. Stay on top. Head south. Find the Fremen. Are you not coming with us? It only seats two. I'll go to the next station and report this attack to the Landsraad. How? I'm Fremen. The desert's my home. Good luck. Good luck. I serve only one master. His name is Shai-Hulud. There are jet flares behind us. Paul. We're not high enough! I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings obliteration. See the friend. See the friend. The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve... but a reality to experience. A process that cannot be understood by stopping it. We must move with the flow of the process. We must join it. We must flow with it. Let go. Let go. We chased them into a Coriolis storm. Winds at 800 kilometers an hour. Nothing survives such a storm. They're dead. It's a certainty. So, it's done. Finally. Send word to Giedi Prime to begin selling our spice reserves. But slowly. We don't want the price to fall. You have no idea how much it cost me to bring such a force to bear here. Now I only have one requirement. Income. So, squeeze, Rabban. Squeeze hard. Yes, Uncle. And the Fremen? Kill them all. We're above 5,000 meters. As soon as we land, run for the rocks. And breathe through this. Now we have to find the Fremen. Are you good? Yeah. Paul... Don't be frightened. Even a little desert mouse can survive. Don't be frightened. You'll need to face your fears. A friend... A friend will help you. Follow the friend. You have much to learn. And I will show you the ways of the desert. Come with me. The sietch where Duncan lived is somewhere off that way. I can see greenery over there. There. That means Fremen live there. We'll cross after dark. That's how the Fremen do it. We're about to enter worm territory. We can't walk like regular humans. If we do, we're dead. We'll have to walk like the Fremen do. It's called a sandwalk. At least according to the filmbooks back home. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay. Follow me. Do the same moves. I think this is the right direction. It's close by. Let's get out of here. - Wait. - It's drum sand. - Run. Go! Go! It's a thumper. Someone set off a thumper. Paul! Run! How big are they? That was insane. Someone called it. Do not run. You will only waste your body's water. Hold. Stilgar. - Hey! You know me. I was there when you came to my father's Council. Oh. This is the Duke's son. Why are you waiting? We need their water. This is the boy I told you about. We can't touch him. They are weaklings. Jamis. That was a brave crossing they made in the path of Shai-Hulud. He does not speak or act like a weakling. Nor did his father. My thumper saved his life. Go back to reason, Stilgar. He's not The One. We have powerful friends. You help us off-world, to Caladan, you will be well rewarded. What wealth can you offer beyond the water in your flesh? Hmm... The boy is young. He can learn our ways. He may have sanctuary. But the woman is untrained... and too old to learn. - Back, you dogs. She'll cut my throat. Why didn't you say you were a weirding woman? And a fighter? Conversation ran short. Peace, woman. Peace. I judged hastily. I would not have let you hurt my friends. They say you're the Mahdi. But you look like a little boy. You chose the hardest way up. Follow me. Give it to me. You will have your own maula pistol when you've earned it. Give it to me. Chani, take charge of the newcomers. See that they are safe on the journey. Let's go. I will not have them. Jamis, I have spoken. Be still. You talk like a leader. But the strongest leads. She bested you. I invoke the amtal. You may not challenge a Sayyadina. Then who will fight in her name? Jamis, don't do this. Don't. The night is fading. Then the sun will witness this death. Where is her champion? I accept her champion. Paul Atreides must die... for Kwisatz Haderach to rise. Don't be frightened. Don't resist. When you take a life, you take your own. I don't believe you're the Lisan al-Gaib. But I want you to die with honor. This crysknife was given to me by my great aunt. It's made from a tooth of Shai-Hulud. The great sandworm. This will be a great honor, for you to die holding it. Where is the Outworlder? Jamis is a good fighter. He won't let you suffer. Chani... Um... Never mind. May thy knife chip and shatter. You should welcome my blade. This world will kill you. Quicker this way. - Do you yield? The boy doesn't know our rule. There's no yielding under the amtal rule. Only death is the test of it. - Is he toying with him? - No. Paul has never killed a man. Kwisatz Haderach. Kwisatz Haderach. Climb up. Rise. You're one of us now. A life for a life. Come with us to Sietch Tabr. No. Paul needs to get off-world. You must have ways. You have smugglers, you have ships. - No. - You have... The Emperor sent us to this place. And my father came, not for spice, not for the riches, but for the strength of your people. My road leads into the desert. I can see it. If you'll have us, we will come. Desert power. This is only the beginning.",
