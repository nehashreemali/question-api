  "script": "1 Since the beginning of time... Since the birth of the first girl... There were the dolls. But dolls have always been... Babies. The girls who played with them always played the role of the mother. Which is funny... At least for a while. Ask your mother... This continued until... Yes, Barbie changed everything. And then he did it again. These are all Barbies. And Barbie is all of those. She may have started as a lady in a bathing suit, but something much bigger happened. She has her own money, house, car and career. Since Barbie can be anything, so can women. And this is reflected to today's girls in the real world. Girls become women who can achieve anything they put their minds to. Thanks to Barbie all the problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved. Or so the Barbies think. After all, they live in Barbie Country. Who am I to spoil their fairy tale? And here's one of those Barbies now. She lives her best day, every day. Hello! When you play with Barbies do not use stairs and doors etc. You just put them where you want them. You use your imagination. -Hey, Skipper! -Hey, Barbie! Midge was Barbie's pregnant friend. We won't show her because Mattel pulled her because a pregnant doll would be too weird. Anyway, Barbie has another big day ahead of her. -Hey, Barbie! -Hey, Barbie! Hello, misses. Tell everyone next to you how much you love her, give her a compliment. -Ask whatever you want. -How are you so impressive? No comment. Seriously, no comment. I love you guys. The Nobel Prize in Journalism go to barbie! I worked very hard. I deserved it. The Nobel Prize for Literature goes to Barbie. -You are the voice of an entire generation. -I know. Money is not words and companies don't even have free speech. So when they invoke this right they are trying to make our democracy plutocracy. This makes me emotional and I express it. I can be both logical and emotional at the same time. And it doesn't diminish my powers. It develops them. Hello, Barbie! What can't Barbie do? Hello, Barbie! Hello, space! Barbie has a perfect day every day. But Ken only if Barbie looks at him. -Hello, Barbie! -Hello, Ken! -Hello, Barbie! -Hello, Barbie! -Hello, Ken! -Hello, Ken! Hi, Ken! - I got ice creams. - Fine. -Hello, Barbie! -Hello, Barbie! -Hello, Barbie! -Hello, Barbie! -Hello, Barbie! -Hello, Ken! -Hello, Barbie! -Hello, Barbie! Hello, Barbie! -Hello, Barbie! -Hello, Barbie! -Hello, Barbie! -Hello, Alan! He's got no brains, he's just Alan. Yes... This confuses me. Barbie, look here. Ken! -Ken? -Hey, Barbie! -Hello. -What did you see; We've seen it all. Let's get you up. - You are strong. -Put some power. -Are you ok; -Yes just fine. I guess the sea was still rough for you, Ken. If I hadn't knocked, I'd have kicked you out right now, Ken. -I kick you out whenever I want, Ken. - Hold my ice cream, Ken. Come on, Ken, show me. Let's fight. You'll have to fight me first. I have you both together. You can't leave here, do you want to kick us out together? Why are you getting emotional? Come on, Ken. No one will expel anyone. Okay; Let's go. Come on, okay. - You did well. -Do you still hurt; You will be fine. - Let's go! - Let's go! -Barbie, hold my hand. -All good. Stay with me, Barbie. It's not even broken. You're fine. - After all, the waves are more dangerous. - You are very brave, Ken. Thank you, Barbie. I'm not even a surfer. -I know. -Not even a lifeguard. -As many think. - Indeed, they think so. My job... - It's the beach. -Correctly! -And you are so good at it! - You'll be fine soon. Basically, by the time I say this, you're healed. -Fantastic. -Perfect. -Barbie; -Yes; -Should I come to your house tonight? -Of course. I'm not doing anything. Only one dance and song party, for all Barbies. Come too. -Cool. -Yes! -Goodbye! -Goodbye! -Hello, Barbie. - Hello, Ken. -You're fine, Barbie! -Thanks, Ken! -Hello, Ken! -Hello. What does he say, Ken? Barbie, look here! You can't do a somersault like that. What; - Party hard, Barbie. -Thanks! -This night is perfect! -Beyond perfect. And you're gorgeous, Barbie. -Thanks. I feel beautiful. -Me too. -The most perfect day! - She's really perfect. Like yesterday and tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and generally every day from now on. Have you ever thought about death? I don't know why I said that. I'm dying to dance! You can go. - I was going to stay here tonight. -Why; - Because we are a couple. -What to do; I do not know. But I don't want you here. - She's related to Ken. -He's just a friend. And this is Barbie's Dream House, not Ken's, right. -Correct as always. -And it's ladies' night. Come on, Barbie! Pajama Party! - Run, the President is here. -Here I am. Does nothing. - Is every night ladies night? -Every night. Forever. -Every night? -Forever. -Good night. -Good night. I love you too. I can not. Need to go. Good night, Barbie. I certainly don't think about death. Hello, Barbie! Hello, Barbie! Hello, Barbie! IT'S OVER! Are you okay, girl? Hello, Barbie! I am fine. Fine! -You got it, Barbie! - Let's go, Barbie! Perfect stand. Let's run to the sea, Barbie. Okay. My legs! No... -Hey, Barbie! -Are you ok; Yes, I just fell. And I'm ashamed. -Barbie is not shy. -I know. I have no idea what happened... but my feet, my heels... they touch the earth. -I don't walk on my toes anymore. -To see. Flatfeet! Stop it, Ken. Sorry, sorry. I know that as Stereotypical Barbie I don't make assumptions about the causation of sequential events, but things are happening lately that might be related. Bad smell in the morning, cold shower, I burned the waffles and fell off the roof. - You're malfunctioning. -What; No! Simply... -Indeed; - I've never seen it before. It usually affects the hair. You have to see Weird Barbie. -I never needed her. -Because you weren't malfunctioning. I've heard she was the prettiest Barbie ever, until someone went too far with her in The Real World. And now her eternal destiny is to make the other Barbies perfect while she herself falls apart more and more. And we all call her Weird Barbie behind her back and in front of her. She is very curious. Why does he always do spaghetti? I would never wear heels if my feet were like this. Hello. Barking. Barking. What does he say, beautiful? -Hello. -Welcome. Welcome to my Dream Home. -Hi how are you; -Nice to met you. Sorry for the mess. How can I help; I was told to see you about my feet. Is... Flat! Yes. - I've never seen it before. -Seriously; You can... fix them? Stereotypical Barbie aren't you? This one of yours... - It's very tasty. -I assume... I'd like to see what's under those jeans. -What did you do before you got it? -Nothing. We were playing volleyball... -Just that; I was thinking about death... What did you say; May... - Was I thinking about death? -Death? It's bad; -What; -I've heard it before. Of course I didn't believe it, but it's true. You did indeed. You opened a portal. -I did not do it. -Someone did. And a rift was created in the boundaries between Barbie Land and the Real World, and if you want to be perfect again, you have to fix it. Or you'll get uglier. Look at your thigh. -What is this; -Cellulite. It will spread everywhere. And you will be upset and emotional. No! What should I do; You're going to the Real World. And you will find the one who plays with you. -Is he playing with me? -They play with all of us. Normally there is a separation. Thanks. We have the girl and the doll and these two do not intersect. - Now they cross paths? -Yes. And this girl... rather it is sad, and her thoughts and her human nature interfere with your nature. Why should he be sorry? We made it all so that real women can be happy and strong. I don't know, but something tells me you put your hand in there too. -I; -How did you open the portal? It's not possible, I wanted everything to stay exactly as it was. Either way, a strong bond is created between you. You have to help her to be helped. So you have to... So what do you choose? The old life and forget it all or the truth about the universe? You pick and take. The first. The heel. No. Let's go again. -You need to know the truth. -I do not want. You have to learn, okay? Let's go again. I'm the Stereotypical Barbie, not the Adventurer. I'm what someone thinks of when they hear \"Barbie\". This is me. You disappointed me. -I am disappointed. -Okay. - I'm ready to forget. -No, you will choose this. I gave you choice so you could have a sense of control. - So there is no first option? - No, you have to fix the rift. It's not my fault, Mattel makes the rules. -But I don't want... -Sit with the cellulite then. No, no... Fine, fine. Send me to the portal. Basically there is no portal. It was a figure of speech. You will go in a convertible, then a speedboat, a rocket, a two-seater bicycle, caravan, snowmobile. So you will cross the state of Los Angeles and then skate to the city of California. I know, weird. Don't overthink it. And when I arrive, how will I find her? You will understand. Nice. -And how will I return? -As you go, but in reverse. Going forward just in reverse order... -Don't overanalyze it. -Okay. Why, you see... If you don't find her and fix things, the bad will get uglier and the weird, even weirder. And you will become like me. Sorry. I understand. I'm good to go. Anyway, I believe in you. -Thanks. -Go. Take care. I love you. -Goodbye. -Hello. Have a nice trip to reality and good luck resetting the boundaries who separate our world from theirs so that cellulite goes away! - He left without you. -You don't know what's happening to you. He literally begged me. -And I said \"I prefer to stay\". -What thing; - Are you afraid? -No. Bet you're scared and she doesn't even want you with her. You fell both ways out, and I'm betting on the opposite. -Yes; -Yes. What are these; You do not know. I do not want to live. I'm looking for reasons not to live. I will miss you very much. I wish you could come. But I have to go alone. What bird am I thinking? -Parrot. -Dolphin. I mean bird. Pelican. Bugger. -We will miss you. -I'll be back soon with perfect legs as if this never happened. And you will see how we made the world with what we did. You will be a hero to them. All powerful women will owe their lives to Barbie. Every woman will thank you and hug you. Yes you are right! So I'm going. Goodbye! -Goodbye, Barbie. -Hello! Goodbye, Barbie. Good luck actually. Watch out for cellulite! I went to the doctor I took the mountains I looked at the children Softly from the spring These questions have many answers And they show me a wrong way And the less I seek the truth I am so close to joy -I'm getting so close... -I'm getting so close... -What are you doing here; -I will come with you. - No, get out. -I can not. We made a bet with Ken and... he must think I'm cool. - Ken is not cool! -It is for me. -You're going to make me late. -What if there is a beach there? You need a professional. Did you bring your skates? I don't go anywhere without them. Please. Okay. Let's go. Should I sit in the front? REAL WORLD And so Barbie and Ken began their adventure for the Real World. Hello! Barbie! It's the Real World! Barbie, I told you it would have a beach. Yes. -What's up; - Smile at us, blonde. -Why are these men looking at me? - Yes, me too. I like. I feel a bit awkward... I'm at a loss for words, it's... like i'm conscious but... consciousness of myself. I don't feel that. Only something I would call admiration. I don't like it. -And there is no trace of violence. - I feel a little. Look, a construction site! We need some feminine energy. Hello girls! -Do you also make a frappe as you shake it? -Would it be my fault if I said you have a nice body? Do you have a mirror in your pocket? Because I can see me in your shorts. I don't know what all these lines mean, but I feel like they are similes with innuendo and I want to let you know that I don't have a trick. And he doesn't have a penis. -We don't have genitals. -Does not matter. I have all the instruments. I thought there would be women at the construction site break. This was very... masculine. Everything is kind of... upside down here. See! -The Supreme Court. -They are very smart. BARBIE AND KEN - I like the bodysuit. - Me the elbow pads. We should probably change. We are nice. -Nice fringes. -And the jeans. Friend! You have to pay them. -She's even better with lots of clothes. -You imagine more. Do you know something? Keep them. Barbie told me I'll figure it out when I find her, but I have no idea. What would Smart Barbie do? I have to think clearly. Who is playing with me? I hate it when they think. I am bored. The sooner I find her, the sooner we leave. -What should I do; -Ken. Go for a walk. On my own; Where; Anywhere. - Should I go there? -Yes. Nice. - Don't go far. -Okay! Sorry... Thanks dude. What does he say, man? - Let's go guys. - Nice workout. Men, men, men! -You are a man! -No you are. Men, men, men! Based on earnings, we exceeded expectations. Flawless. I'm not worried about that. Later, Margaret. Let's wrap it up. We are also officially important. Yes! That's it... painful... but nice You are very beautiful. I know. Barbie! Barbie! Yes! - I found her! -I found it! -What did you find? -You first. -At the same time. -Okay. -Are in school! - Men rule! -What; -Is he at school? What did you say; -Nothing. -Good. -Let's go to school. - Nice! Come. MATTEL HEADQUARTERS LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA -You are welcome; -Dan from the FBI. - I'm the... - I don't care who you are. -What are you; Practitioner? -No... -You missed two dolls. -Impossible. How do you know that? Don't be presumptuous. Blonde hair, their names are Barbie and Ken. On roller skates in Santa Monica. We need Mattel's help. -Don't do it to yourself. -Okay. This is bad. Very bad. -What; -It's happened again. What; Never; About 10 years ago, a woman, Skipper, showed up at a home in Key West and wanted to watch the kids. Try going surfing with the toddler. They managed to keep it under wraps, but this is now serious. - I'm going all the way up. -No one goes there. -Must. - You may not come back. I know. -Hello. - Hi, Aron. -New paintings? -Yes. I started some strange plans. -Are different. -Suicide Barbie. Barbie with Cellulitis. The Barbie of Shame. Listen, I have to speak to the higher ups. -No. -Must. Go. Aron, they have an important meeting, no one is coming. We've always given girl power! But what are we really selling? We sell dreams. And imagination. And shine. I have become passionate. And when you think of glitter, what comes to mind? Feminine spontaneity. Sorry. -Who are you; -Aaron Dinkins. We have an important discussion, Aaron Dinkins. - I think you are interested. -Send it by e-mail by TTM. End of the day. Can I whisper it? Okay, put it that way. No. Take the chair. All good. -You are OK; -It's OK. Whatever happened to Skipper then. And with all due respect... Then there was Skipper. Now is... Barbie. If he finds out that our dolls are walking around Los Angeles as real versions of themselves... roam the Earth... This will be very bad. Barbie in the real world? It can not be done. We have a problem. Destruction! - I stress it! -What; -How did we call you? -Aaron Dinkins. -Dinkinson? - Dinkins. Yes. Barbie Land is an alternate reality or a place that... -Your imagination... -Yes. Imagine it like a city in Sweden. Aaron Dinkinson. Sweden. Correctly. How much do you weigh; Does not matter. We will need the box. No one leaves until this doll is put back in the box. - Here, the school I saw in the vision! -A horseman. I'm starting to feel weird. Like I'm scared for no reason. -What is this; -Anxiety. I have it too. It's awful at such an age. - I feel great. -Children do not lash out at their fathers. It should be in here somewhere. I have to find her fast. I'm going to the library to find a book about trucks. -Just don't mess around. -Okay! Where are you going; What's her name? Sasha. -Hello SASA! -Don't talk to her. Sasha may talk to you but you never talk to her. -It will tear you apart. -Do not worry. Everyone loves me and thinks I'm pretty and cool. I thank you. Hello girls. Sasha! What it says; Who are you; Your favorite woman of all time. Barbie! -Do you really think you are Barbie? -Yes! -She's crazy. -Did he get out of a mental hospital? So you're like a professional goofball? No, Barbie is a doctor, lawyer, senator... -Nobel winner. -Did you win a Nobel? Not me, but... Barbie. Won't you thank me, won't you hug me? Where am I your favorite doll? At five we left the Barbies. -I hated dolls with hair. - It was my last choice. I liked it. Anyway, it was awful. Horrible; Why; - Come on, Sasha. - Break it up. Well, Barbie... I will tell you. You always made women feel bad about themselves. -I think the opposite is true. -You represent all the wrong values. Sexualization of capitalism, utopian body ideals... No, no... You are describing something stereotypical. Barbie is... - Something much more. - See how you are. - Basically, I'm a stereotype. -You took feminism back 50 years. You are destroying the morale of girls and the whole planet by glorifying capitalism. My purpose is to help you and make you happy and strong. I am strong. And until you appeared here as Barbie, I had forgotten about you for years, fascist. Okay. Here it is again. Sorry. Nice talking to you. Nobody listens to me. Excuse me, do you have time? -You respect me. - Do you know what time it is? NO I do not know. Why didn't Barbie tell me about the patriarchy? That is, if I understood correctly, that the horsemen have power. Of course. - I'm going to chase my fortune. - Fine. I want a job with good salary with influence. You need a master's degree. Some even have PhDs. -Isn't it enough that I'm a man? - Probably the opposite now. You're not doing patriarchy very well either. Not us... We apply it. We just hide it better, you know. No, you won't have an appendectomy. -I am man. - No doctor. -You are welcome; -No. -Should I talk to a doctor? - You are talking to a doctor. -I want coffee. -No. -And a pen. -No. -And something sharp. -No. -There he is. Doctor! -Bring the insurance! -I came to the beach for work. - So lifeguard? I'm not trained to go there. Just to stay at this point. - No one is in danger here. - Anyway, I don't know how to save them. -Then I can't take you. -I can't even be at the beach! Does he consider me a fascist? I do not control the trade flow trains. - Here you are. -No... It went bad. I have to find somewhere to start the patriarchy all over again. - Miss Barbie? - Purely \"Barbie\". You must come with us. -Who are you; - Mattel. Mattel? Thank God. I need to speak to someone in charge. Everything is upside down here. Men see me as an object... girls hate me, get weird and keep picking on me. -From here. - I also learned to cry. At first it was a tear and then a river. What to do; Should I follow her to the suspicious car? I would like such a car, to tell the truth. You are right. All good. It's from Mattel. -Yes. -I found it. I'll be back to tell the Kens what I learned. It will be great. -Okay. Let's go from there. -Back to Barbie Land. - Hello, bunny. -Don't call me that. Sorry. I left early because something happened and I said let's go for ice cream. Fortunately, they caught the shopping. The one from some reality show. She thinks she's Barbie. -Sit down, what did you say? -She thinks she's Barbie. He has believed it. What are you doing; Where are you going; Mum. Mum! Mom, come in. Seriously; Mum! Of course the reason I came here was Mattel! It certainly wasn't Sasha. Thanks, it was fun. The mother ship! Barbie! We are glad to see you! -Hello! -You want water; Yes thank you. I'm used to it being empty. -Thanks. - We were looking forward to meeting you in person. Of course. What can I do to close the gap and get rid of cellulite and these legs? and generally not end up like Weird Barbie? That's exactly what we were talking about. If you don't mind, it would help us a lot if you would... to get into this huge box. Get in the box and you'll be back. And everything will be as before. First let's find Ken. - Ken? -Yeah, you know, Barbie and Ken. Yes, Ken! That's what they call him. Back to Barbie Land! I'm going to throw up, I'm dizzy. We weren't worried about Ken. Never. -Okay, then let's get in the box. - Nice! Yes! Since I've come this far, can I see the boss? The CEO? I am. The Finance Director? The General Manager? -President of Barbies? -Here. I don't have a position, maybe I'm a woman? Are there any women in charge? Listen... I know exactly where you are going with this and I have to tell you that it makes me very sad. The company is literally made up of women. We had a director in the 90s. And another one... some other period. So I already found you two. Women are the foundations of this huge phallic edifice. We have toilets everywhere for both sexes, they all love women. I am a mother's son. I am a mother of a son. I am the niece of a female aunt. I have Jewish friends. What I'm trying to say is... Get in the box, tightrope. -Can't I say \"string\" anymore? - I have years to get into a box. You see; It is easy. Good. God, I remember that smell. Reminiscent of Proust times. Do you remember Barbie Proust? It didn't sell well. Do you know something? Before entering the box can I go to the bathroom to do my hair? Good. Can you hurry? -From here; - In the hallway straight ahead. -Thanks. -To the right. It probably doesn't hold. Catch Barbie! Don't you dare step on it. I'll do it. I said, get the barbie. Where is; I'm reaching you. I will catch you. It's faster to go over the top. -Faster. -For sure. Catch the barbie. I will catch you! Don't worry, you are safe here. What is here; I always concentrate best at kitchen tables. Tea; Yes please. So a woman also works here. Honey, we don't just do business here. What; -Because I don't know how to drink tea? -No. You look different. I'm not like that normally. I'm usually perfectly fine. I do not know. You look fine to me. The Real World is not what I expected. It never is. Isn't it wonderful? Who are you; Where did he go; If you go into that closet there are stairs leading to the lobby. Okay. Thanks... Ruth. Ruth. Thank you, Ruth. Please, Barbie. We found her! There she goes! The card! I lost my card. Get in! Now! Get in! Come! No... We'll never catch her. We don't need it. Barbie! Let's make a plan. I usually sit in the passenger seat. I will enter the first one. Wait! I hope no one sees us with a real Barbie in the car. -How did this happen; -I do not know. how are you here You are something of an idea. A perfect idea. I've been feeling a little lonely lately... -And I found the Barbies... -I thought you had thrown them away. I started playing with them and drawing like I used to, remember? - I thought it would be pleasant. -It was; No. I felt bad and weird and then so did the drawings and because I couldn't look like you, I made you look like me? Did any painting have melancholic tendencies and cellulite? Yes! Suicide Barbie! -Oh my god! -And cellulite. - I came for you. - You came for me. It was your own memories. Yes; Is anyone listening? Do you communicate telepathically? - No, nothing to do with it. -Do you have telepathy with a real Barbie? No! I mean, maybe a little. I don't even know what to say you wanted to make her real. Listen, Sasha. I'm a boring mom with a boring job and a daughter who hates me. Is it bad to want to have fun for a while? The fools must lose me. Mum! I owe you an apology. I thought Barbie made your world better, but in the end it's broken and there's no saving it. Yes, he's not perfect, but you gave me hope! I love women. I want to help them. Come on, everyone hates them. Both women and men. Everyone knows that. -Truth; -About. The \"hate\" is heavy. Wake up, mom! I'm awake, Sasha! Mom, where did you learn to drive like that? -A guy taught me. -The dad; Yes, yes... Dad. Bend over. -You are beautiful. -Do not look at me. Sorry. We can't hide forever. Where can we go? I have an idea. Will you take us to Venice Beach? Of course. I love rollerblades. Where are we going; - In Barbie Country! -What; Mum! Will you let her take us to a fantasy land? Yes, because I never do anything. I didn't even go on the cruise I won because I didn't have a license and dad is allergic to the sun. -You can't leave dad. - It will be fine. -That's right. -Ready for fun? Yes! Let's go! Come and feel the magic. Where are we; -Where did we find these clothes? -Where did we find the vehicle? I had lost my boots when I was little and my mother wouldn't buy me another Barbie -Only for the boots. - They work for you! Thanks! -She was always my favorite Barbie. - You are my favorite person. Don't tell him, but I never had a Ken. Because he is completely unnecessary. I didn't say that. Women hold all the positions of power control the money, which is what men actually do. -Sounds nice. - Look, Sasha, dolphins! I am so close to joy I am so close to joy Which song is it; We have a female president and we are all work, fun and femininity all day. -Are you playing giant hands? -No, that's crazy. Excuse me, did you see any women on roller skates? A blonde, a brunette and a teenage girl skated over there. No... It always starts with roller skates... -Sorry; -They went to Barbie Land. - No... - He also brought people. - Extreme things can happen. -Like what; We could never have imagined. A podcast from two wise trees. Or a choir of 2,000 young fathers. Not even. We have to go to Barbie Land. Go find skates. Run in one direction. I can already feel my heels kicking up! This is what I have to do. Bring you here. Sounds about right. This is... Strange. I brought beers. The one with the beer is the President and the cheerleaders are the Supreme Court. It's much better than being President. Something is wrong today. Hello, Barbie. Good. Hi, Ken! Have a beer. The kid is thirsty. Anyway... Where to see my Dream Home. Everything there will inspire you. And we can change clothes again! The Capitol! -Is it pink? -Pink! And here... Here are the Dream Homes. I live here. You can see inside the houses. Does every Barbie have her own house? Cool. Where do the Kens live? I do not know. At first I thought it was dominated by men out there. Then for a while I thought the horses dominated. Then I realized that horses are extensions of men. I had this tree house! I saved up to buy it. I've never seen a car like this before. What happened here; In essence, everything exists to enhance the male existence. -Amazing. -Beautiful. -I know. - Barbie has arrived. Ken? what have you done What are you wearing; Don't question me, just follow, little one. -Don't call me little girl. -Miniature; Like this mini fridge? No, Ken. It's my Dream Home, it's mine! It's Not Your Dream Home Anymore -You don't need a dojo and a home. - And cash. But it sounds nice. Try it. - Mojo Dojo. -Don't say it. Mojo Dojo Casa Home! How weird is that? These Mojo Dojo Casa Houses literally fly off the shelves. The kids are asking for them like crazy. We got Ken t-shirts, mugs... -It is the most popular tattoo. -No... Warner has started auditions for a Ken movie and it's already a blockbuster. It happens. What we didn't imagine. -If we don't find the one who writes... -Secretary. She, along with her daughter. If we don't bring them back to close the portal, the worlds will be changed forever. What do we care about Barbie and Ken? Money flows in abundance. Shame on you, Executive No. 2. Have I spent my whole life in meetings to care about money? No! I did it all for little girls and their dreams. In the least weird way. Let's go faster. We don't have time. Look, I'm just drinking beers at Dojo Mojo Casa House. -Ken! - You can stay if you want. As a bride or as a long distance relationship with no strings attached. -What; -What do you think; Shall we drink together? No, I won't drink with you. Very well. You barbies don't control everything, we make the wool the way we want it. I have hats. Where are my hungry boys? Who wants snacks? Barbie, nice to see you. Can you believe this is happening? Yeah, isn't that great? Anyone want a beer? What are you doing; Are you a doctor. I like being a useful pot. Alan likes to help with the foot massage. -No I do not like it. -We love it. I am so blind right now. And I. I like that I don't think about anything. It's like a spa day for the mind. Forever. What happened to them? We explained to them the infallible logic of patriarchy and they collapsed. It's like the 1500s with the locals and the smallpox, they had no defense against it. Yes! Buckle up, love. Because Barbie Country is now Ken Country. And it will be like Century City Los Angeles because everything is perfect in Century City. As soon as you arrive, you're like, \"I can't believe how perfect it is here!\" No, not everything is perfect there because we let them down! No, you let me down! Out there I was somebody. And when I was walking down the street... people respected me for who I am. A lady... he asked me the time. -No way! - And yet. What if there weren't details like... Bachelors and Masters and I don't even know what... And swimming lessons. I would rule the world. But I don't need those here. Here I am a simple guy. And you know something? That's enough for me. Remote control? Which one do I press? That there. Call me President Ken. Let's see all the changes and innovations that Ken brought. The Nobel Prize for horses... go to ken! And now the changes are being made permanent, with elections to change the Constitution. That's right, in 48 hours the Kens will vote to change the Constitution for a government with Kens, for the Kens by the Kens! You can not do that. It's Barbie Country. We worked hard and dreamed for everything that exists now... You can't cancel it in a day. Look at me, figuratively and literally. And now... Sorry... Mojo Dojo Casa is my home. Is not... Barbie's Mojo Dojo Casa House. Okay; What do you think; No fun, huh? It's men's night! Every night is men's night. Barbie! Take women's fashion with you. Get the \"Disco Celebration\" bell bottoms. And the Skating Practice Outfit along with a Snowsuit. -These are ancient. -Your pajamas from Amsterdam! And the Palazzo Pants with Lahouria. - Not the Palace! -And give it to him! Maybe he'll do that to me. Sweetheart. Why did you wish me to come into your miserable world... with your thoughts and feelings? -What; -Barbie Country was perfect. I was perfect too. Sorry, I didn't mean to... Don't apologize. Don't blame mom. Sasha, so sweet! Maybe you wished for it. Maybe it's your fault. I didn't wish for anything. I never wanted anything to change. Sweetie, that's life. It keeps changing. This is scary. I do not want it. Not in my life. No thanks. No, I don't want that. I'll just sit here and wait and hope some more dynamic barbie... come to his senses and do something about this mess. I understand you completely. It's like being human all the time. Please go back to your damn world and leave me alone. - So you give up? -Yes. Nice. I feel a little sorry for you, but you are exactly what I expected. Let's go, my love. -How would you... -Do it all backwards. Unbelievable. Let's go, mom. You don't deserve her. I haven't fallen any lower. Emotionally and physically. So guys, it's time to get your new Suicide Barbie. He wears overalls all day. Today she spent 7 hours looking at her bestie's engagement photos on Instagram, eating a bag of jelly beans. Now her jaw hurts and she will see Pride and Prejudice for the seventh time until she fell asleep. Any alliance between our families is considered a reprehensible relationship. Anxiety and panic attacks sold separately. Barbie, wake up. Now I'm like you. Ugly and unwanted. Thanks. Let's put her back. -It's not perfect; -Yes! - Where to see the boat! -The boat! Beautiful countryside. He said he could see into me I spent 4 years Bowing to knowledge I got my degree and I was free I went to the doctor I took the mountains I looked at the children Softly from the spring We interrupt to announce our new station which only plays Ken's favorite. Shut it, for God's sake! -Who you are; - Alan. -You are indeed Alan, perfect! -Don't tell them, I blew it. I can't stand another leather couch. It breaks my spirit. Once they figure out how to build horizontal walls as well, no one will be able to get in or out. -So we have to run. -Alan, you can't leave. The real Barbie caused all of this in the first place. No one will care about me. It's happened before. All NSYNC, Alan. Yes still, him too. Let's go. You there! -What are we doing; -Come in and sing. -Come on dude. Be ready. -What; -Who are you; - Alan. Ken's friend. They make all his clothes for me. Get in. - But you don't have a diploma. -He doesn't even have a car. Good. KINGDOM OF KEN -What are you doing; We have to go. - We have to go back. We have to save Barbie Country. And Barbie. - But you hate her. -You no. You always believed in her. I was wrong. He quited. The Kens won. You have to try. And let's not do everything perfectly, even better. Nothing I can do better. I messed it up with my silly drawings... They're not dumb, they're beautiful. You like; They are strange and dark and absurd. Everything you pretend you're not. I am. Weird and dark and absurd. Calm, calm... -Do you want more Alan? -No! -We have to leave immediately. -Shut up, Alan! We're going back. Let's go get my doll. I will never leave here... -Where will we find her? - It can only be in one place. You are a writer. The Nobel is yours. Do you remember when you won it? -It doesn't make sense, I tried everything. -Oh my god... I don't even know how I got here. I do not deserve it. I want to thank... Ken. Thank you, Ken. I love you, Ken. What I'm wondering is why didn't the brainwashing work for you? I would become immune to exposure to the Real World. Either they wash you or you are ugly. There is no middle ground. Say that again. Get ready, because in 48 hours it will be Ken Land. Let's go guys. Above will be Barbie. The Kens found us. Ken! Ken? Is anyone listening? People. We are fine. And Alan. Go to the Strange House. I'm Weird Barbie, I wear spaghetti, I have a funky haircut and I stink. Oh my god, I had a Weird Barbie too! -Of course you did. -They get weird when you play a lot. Sugar Daddy Ken! And Ken with the Magic Earring. They withdrew them. - Sugar daddy? - No, I'm not a sugar daddy. This is Sugar. I'm her dad too. I have an earring too. Magical. There were indeed those Kens. And other retired Barbies. -The Mature Skipper? Can; -Of course. See this. -She puffs out her chest! -Why would they do this? And Video Barbie. I have a TV in the back. Do you know whose dream it is? Nobody. Nobody wants it. And this is classic Barbie, of course. He's alive, he's just having an existential crisis. Come on, get up. What you got; I'm not... beautiful now What do you think; You are beautiful. I'm not like the Stereotypical Barbie. To the creators: Margot Robbie can't believe she's saying this. But you are beautiful. It's not just that. I'm not... smart enough to be interested. -You are very smart. - I can't operate. I've never flown a plane. I'm not the President. I'm not on the Supreme Court. I'm not... pretty good... in nothing. It is literally impossible to be a woman. You're so beautiful. And brilliant, and it kills me that you think like that. As if... we must always be something special. But for some reason we always get it wrong. You need to be thin, but not too thin. And don't say you want to be thin, but that you want to be healthy. But at the same time you have to be subtle. You must have money, but not ask for it. Because it's rude. You have to be bossy, but not mean. Lead without invalidating the ideas of others. Love being a mom, but don't talk about the kids all the time. Care about your career, but also care about others. Accountable for men's bad behavior, but if you bring it up, they tell you that you're complaining. Be beautiful to men, but without tempting them or threatening other women because you have to show solidarity but always stand out. And always be grateful. Don't forget the system is rigged, so find a way to admit it, but always be grateful. You must never grow old, be rude, show off, to be selfish, to fail, to be afraid, Never cross the line. It's tough. It's counterintuitive and no one is giving you an award or a \"thank you\". And it turns out that not only did you do it all wrong, you were at fault. I am tired... to see myself and every other woman to be distressed to please the world. And if all this... they also apply to a doll... representing a woman... then I don't know what to say. Wait... I did write a book. It's like I'm in a dream where I'm really into Zack Snyder's Justice League. But what you said woke me up. -Truth; -Yes. You're back! He's back! By expressing the woman's cognitive dissonance within the patriarchy, you weakened her! Yes. Did I say that? Well done, White Savior Barbie! No, your mom did. She saved us. We have to stop the Kens. And tell this to the other Barbies. -This is. -I've got this. How are we going to get them from the Kens? We have experience from such a world. Do you have a map of Barbie Country? What do you say; - Thanks, I made it. -Listen up... It doesn't matter how we see them, but how they see themselves. Ken's Country already contains the seeds of its own destruction. First we get them away from the Kens. We'll have a lie-brainwashed Barbie, it'll be you. Look helpless and confused. They can't resist a desperate girl. They need to believe that you are resting. That they have the power. And once the defenses are down... you will get the power back. The influence that the Porsche 356 has as a whole in the motoring circle is unsurpassed. Very difficult to Photoshop, I can't find how to select areas. Honey, it only works on the selected layer. To show you. My little head is losing with all this technology. Color spectrums and magnetic lasso and bitmaps... You, with strong hands, can you... -What's up; -Alan, from around. - Ken? -No no... - But I love him! - Come on, Alan. What will become of Ken? Just listen. Be their mom, but don't remind them of theirs. Hide your strength with laughter. What happened; One moment I was President and the next moment I was cutting Ken's steak? Welcome, President. Then we will use the Barbies with a conscience. It will be the new bait. Tell them you haven't seen The Godfather and you want them to explain it to you. -Do you see the No.? -The Godfather. -I have not seen it. -Are you serious; It's a rich mix of Coppola's aesthetic and a triumph of Robert Evans and the studios of the 70s. Do you want to start it and talk while it plays? You have to reject men's flirting without insulting their ego, because if you say yes, you're a slut, if you say no, you're a slut. -I don't want to touch feet. - No, you don't want it. One more thing, messing around with finances. I have all my money in a bank account. This is incorrect! You need bonds, CDs... Nobody has a CD anymore! Sweetie, you're so cute when you're confused. No music CDs. CDs are term deposits. Stephen Malkmus took advantage of Lou Reed's scathing lyricism with post-punk influences like Wire and The Fall. -What am I wearing? I would never choose that. -Because you're a natural. -Do you want pants? -Yes. Welcome, Barbie. I'm so embarrassed and I don't feel pretty at all. Will anyone ever like me? Or do the classic trick. Wear glasses to discover your beauty. -Can; - Yes, freely. Here you go. Now we see your beautiful face. And then you can pretend you're bad at every sport there is. Come I will show you. Come I will show you. -Come I will show you. -Come I will show you. Let's show you. We will until all the Barbies are deprogrammed to take back Barbie Country. Yes! Tomorrow the Kens vote to change the Constitution. -We have to catch up with them. -The final part of the plan. To turn one against the other. Now that they think they have power over you, you will make them question whether they have power over each other. What if it doesn't work out? And if not... if he doesn't like me anymore? -He likes you. -He took it badly. Because he likes you. And because inside he knows it... -That you don't like it that much. - Again, I don't want to hurt him. He took your house. He brainwashed your girlfriends, he wants control of the government. Correctly. -My girl. -Yes. It's like I'm already a woman. Welcome. So is; -Time has come. -I am ready. I thank you. Go. Hello! Hello. I was studying. -I was thinking, Ken Country? -Kingdom. -Kingdom; -Country of the Kingdom of Ken. - The Land of the free and men. -This place, at least, is... very nice. And the Kens are better at power than the Barbies. We took patriarchy and made it patriarchy. - Yes, I was thinking... - Yes? I am ready to be your long term casual no strings attached long distance girlfriend, if you still want me -Give me a minute. -Okay. Miracle! I don't know, I want to think about it. You are welcome. Okay. Come in. - I'll play the guitar for you. -Perfect! This is the final stage of the plan. Make their dream come true. And at the height of joy, when they think you care about the song... You will get it back from them. Who are you talking to? -What; - I said, who are you talking to? -With noone. -To see. -With Ken! - Sorry, I'm coming. Nice song you play. You wrote it; Yes. Do you want to hear it while I stare awkwardly into your eyes for four and a half minutes? Of course. Sorry, I'm coming. I am coming. You take advantage of their selfishness and stupid jealousies and you create discord among them. Half. Sorry. As long as they fight, we'll take back Barbie Country. Does the title of long-term casual girl mean nothing? -What are we going to do; - We will throw them out of the Beach. No. We will start a war. -With Barbies? -With the Kens. -We are. -The others. Let's call them otherwise so we don't get confused. - But we know what we mean. -If you say \"Ken at 4\"... -How will I know who you mean? - Because we attack at 10. We take advantage of the morning waves. But not too early, because we also want to sleep. What will we fight? We have no weapons. With rackets and volleyballs. -And cuffs. -And exclusions. See you on Malibu Beach! You can Ken, you can Ken... And now they destroy each other. I say restore our Constitution. -Yes! -Perfect idea! It's literally a hornet's nest here. Watch out to the side! - I ate a bullet. -No way. -Do they have real guns? -No. -Ken! -Yes; -Weren't we going to vote today? -What thing; -For the Constitution. - Today was, huh? Well, ladies, let's go! Those who want Barbie Country to remain as it is to say \"Ai\". I am very happy. Let's go, Barbie! Let's go, Barbie! Is it my imagination or have Mojo Dojo Casa Houses just gotten dreamier? Because they are Dream Homes, old... Exactly, we have restored the Constitution as it should be. And we brought back the brains and autonomy of Barbies. And we disinfected all the houses. What are we doing; Ken! -Where are we attacking? -No... Don't look at me! Cries; Give us a minute. Ken? -Are you ok; -Yes. Fine. It's okay if you cry. I cried too and it was perfect. I'm set free, I know it's not weakness. Okay... Do you want to stand up a bit? All this was difficult. I did not like it. I understand. And the mini fridges are too small. It only held a six pack of beer and was practically useless. To tell you the truth, when I learned that the patriarchy has nothing to do with horses, I lost interest. Does not matter. I always thought this would be our home. Ken... I think I owe you an apology. Sorry for taking you for granted. Not every night needed to be a women's night. Thank you for saying that. Thanks. I did not mean... I don't know who I am without you. You are Ken. It's \"Barbie and Ken\". There is no pure Ken. That's why they made me. I only exist... to the warmth in your gaze. Without this... i'm just an ordinary blonde who can't do somersaults. Maybe it's time to find out who Ken is. Ok, I think I got it. No, that's not the answer. I feel stupid. I look so stupid. I look so stupid! -No! -You are very cool! Ken, you have to find who you are without me. -Why; - You are not your girlfriend. Not your house, not your mink. -The beach; - No, not the beach either. Maybe what you thought that made you who you are, it's not really you. Maybe it's Barbie and... and also Ken. Ken... I am... -I; -Yes! I'm Ken! Me too Barbie. Ken... it's me! - Ken is me! - Ken is me! I don't care about being Ken anymore, I miss Barbie. -Fine! -Barbie! Here I am. Ken! I want you to take it. That's nice. We were fighting because we didn't know who we were. Ken I am... I! Ken is right. It's hard to be a leader. -You know; -He's my boss. Midge. Hadn't we withdrawn her? Listen, you know how many times i wanted to stand up in a meeting and say \"do you want to tickle?\" -Truth; -Let's tickle each other. Me too. Me too. I love to be tickled. No no. Don't hug me. Thanks to Barbies, can I too relieve the burden of life by remaining true to the true role of Director. And we can put everything back in Barbie Land exactly the way it was. -K. Mattel... - Please. - Call me mother. -No thanks. I don't think they should go back to the way they were. No Barbie or Ken should live in the shadows. And the Alans. -I; -Yes. -Hello. - I wanted to apologize... that we called you weird behind and in front of your back. Does not matter. I have accepted it. Do you want to work for the Government? Can I be a cleaner? -Of course! -Thank you. - Nice! - Madam President. Can we have a Supreme Court? This is not possible. Maybe a lower district court... OK, as long as we're wearing tights! They had to start somewhere. And one day they will have the power and influence in Barbie Country that women also have in the Real World. I do not want. -Come on! -I can not. -Act mature. -I have an idea. Tell me your dream, my child. How about an Everyday Barbie? She is not unusual. He's not the president. Maybe it is. Maybe she's a mother, maybe not. Because it's normal to just want to be a mother, or to be president, or both, or neither. She wears a flattering t-shirt and wants to go about her day feeling okay about herself. Very... - Terrible idea. - But it will bring money. Everyday Barbie, I love it! Fantastic. - Fine. -Yes. -Perfect. -Yes. All complete, right? Let's start closing the portal between the two worlds. -And Barbie? -What do you mean; What will be the end? What will he win? Easy. She falls in love with Ken. That won't happen. I'm not in love with Ken. What do you want; I do not know... I'm not sure where I belong anymore. I don't think I have an end. That was always the goal. I made you to have no end. You... Ruth from Mattel. My love, I'm Mattel. Until the IRS came, but that's another matter. -So you're the... -Ruth Hedler. The creator of Barbie. Wonderful! Her ghost has an office on the 17th floor. -What; -What; Guys, did you think the creator of Barbie looks like Barbie? I am a short old woman with a double mastectomy and problems with the IRS. None look like Barbie. Except for Barbie, of course. Bow down, honey. I don't feel like Barbie anymore. Let's walk. I thank you. Thank you, Barbie. Thanks. I don't know what to do now. I've always been the Stereotypical Barbie... and I'm not good at anything else. -You saved the country from the patriarchy. -It was a team effort. And you brought that mother and daughter together. They found it on their own. Are you the Invisible Barbie? Or I'm not even a Barbie anymore. You realize that people only have one end. Ideas live forever. People not so much. You know that, right? Yes. Being human can be very uncomfortable. I know. People make up things like the patriarchy and Barbie to endure how uncomfortable it is. I understand. And then you die. Yes. Yes. I want to be with people too that create meaning. Not something made up. I want to imagine. I don't want to be the idea. Makes sense; I knew Barbie would surprise me, but I never expected this. You give me permission to... to become human? -You don't need my permission. - But you made me. Don't you control me? I have as much control as I have over my daughter. I named her after you, Barbara. And I always wanted for you what I wanted for her. We mothers stand still so our daughters can look back and see how far they've come. So being human isn't something that should... to look for it... or want it? Simply... Am I just finding out that I am? I can't let you do this without knowing the consequences. Take my hand. Close your eyes... And now, feel. So Barbie left behind the pastels and plastics of Barbie Country for the pastels and plastics of Los Angeles. Nice. Thanks for bringing me. -You got it. -I'm proud of you. This is! Very close. You are the best. Thank you. -This is a political statement. - It's a loan. We will wait for you here. We love you! Hello. -Name; -My name is... Hendler, Party, Barbara. And what are you here for? I came to see my gynecologist.",
