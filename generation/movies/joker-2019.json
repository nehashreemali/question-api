Here's what's happening. It's day eighteen of the garbage stall, with 10,000 tons of garbage piling up every day, even the nicest sections of the city are looking like swamps. Health commissioner Edward O'Roark is declaring a citywide state of emergency for the first time in decades. There's no need to wait until somebody dies or comes down with typhoid fever. It's already a serious situation. It's something that affects almost everyone in the city, no matter who they are or where they live. You can't go down no one avenue without seeing nothing but garbage and rats. It's starting to affect my business when customers can't get in here because of garbage situation. When out there, not just smell it, but I think to look at it, its terrible. It don't affect me, except for the the very bad smell, it's horrific. The mess. I've been in this country for 50 years and I've never seen anything like it. What is this world coming to? Put them in the room there and sit there and talk 'till they got it over with. 24 hours, 48 hours, how long it takes. The Idea of the National Guard pulling in and cleaning up, it's good idea! In other news the Building Industry of Landlords today expressed concern over the latest increase in heating oil prices. Rangers in the Metro area are searched to fill them in... Let's get it. - Yo, what's up with your shoes, bro? - Nice outfit, huh? If you're gonna be a clown, at least you can be a bill-boy, you know that, right? - Hey! - Stop it! - Go! Go! Go! - Hey! - Come on, Kyle, let's go! - We've got the sign! Let's go! - Stop there! - Come on! Watch your go! Watch your go! Make me stop, clown. Hey! C'mon clown, you are not catching up. Stop them! Come on! - Come on! - Get out of the way! Stop them! Hey! You bastards. Come on, beat his ass up. Come on, this guy's weak, can't do nothing. Harder! Harder! Beat him up. Take his stuff. - Let's go, let's go! - Come on, come on, come on! - Let's go, let's go, let's go! Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there? It is certainly tense. People are upset. They're struggling. Looking for work. These are tough times. How 'bout you? Have you been keeping up with your journal? Yes, Ma'am. Great. Did you bring it with you? Arthur... last time I asked you to bring your journal with you for these appointments. Can I see it? I've been using it as a-- as a journal, but also as a joke diary. Funny thoughts or observations. I think I told you I'm pursuing a career in stand-up comedy. No, you didn't. I think I did. \"I just hope my death makes more cents than my life.\" How does it feel to have to come here? Does it help to have someone to talk to? I think I felt better when I was locked up in a hospital. And having thought more about why you were locked up? Who knows? I was wondering if you could ask the doctor to increase my medication? Arthur, you're on seven different medications. Surely, they must be doing something. I just don't want to feel so bad anymore. Can you please stop bothering my kid? - Sit! - I wasn't bothering him... - Just stop! - I was... What, you think that's funny? I'm sorry, I have a co... \"It's a medical condition causing sudden, frequent and uncontrollable laughter that doesnt match how you feel. It can happen in people with a brain injury or certain neurological conditions.\" I'm sorry. Happy? Did you check the mail before you came up? Yeah, mom. Nothing. And finally tonight, just when you thought it couldn't get any worse. Authorities are saying the city is under siege by scores of rats. - And not just any rats - super rats. - More hard to kill. He must not be getting any of my letters. It's Thomas Wayne, mom. - He is a busy man. - Oh, please. I worked for that family for years. The least he could do is write back. Here, all worked up. Eat. - You need to eat. - You need to eat. How skinny you are. He will make a great mayor. Everybody says so. Oh, yeah? Everybody who? - Who do you talk to? - Well, everybody on the news. He is the only one who could save the city. He owes it to us. Come, sit. It's starting. Oh, my! From NCB studios in Gotham city! It's Live with Murray Franklin! Tonight Murray welcomes, Sandra Winger, comedian Skip Byron and the piano styling of Yeldon & Chantel! Joining Murray as always, Ellis Drane and his Jazz Orchestra. And now, without further ado, Murray Franklin! Thank you. Thank you. We've got a great looking audience today. - Yeah! - Murray! Wow. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So, everybody's heard about the super rats stutter in Gotham now, right? Well, today, the mayor said he has a solution. You ready for this? Super cats. - But no, serious it is, I mean these guys are... - I love you, Murray! I love you, too. Hey, Bobby, will you put the lights on? Who is that? Was that you? You wanna stand up, please? Stand. Stand up for me. There. What's your name? Hi, Murray. Arthur. - Arthur? - My name is Arthur. Ah, okay, well, there is something special about you, Arthur. I could tell. - Where are you from? - I live right here in the city. With my m--mother. Okay, hold on. Hold on. There is nothing funny about that. I lived with my mother before I made it. Just me and her. I'm that kid who's father went out for a pack of cigarettes. And he never came back. I know what that's like, Murray. I've been the man of the house for as long as I can remember. I take good care of my mother. All that sacrifice, she must love you very much. She does. She always tells me to smile and put on a happy face. She says I was put here to spread joy and laughter. Wow! I like that. I like that a lot! Come on down. Come on! For that, you've got to come down. Come on! Come on! Come on! Okay, we've got a big show tonight. Stay tuned. We will be right back. That was great, Arthur. Thank you. I mean, I loved hearing what you had to say, it made my day. Thanks, Murray. You see all this, the lights, the show, the audience, all that stuff? I'd give it all up in a heartbeat to have a kid like you. You're such a jerk. - What's up, ladies? - Hey, Randall. What's up? Another day in chuckle town. You okay? I heard about the beat-down you took. Fucking savages. It was just a bunch of kids. I should've left them alone. No, they'll take everything from here if you do that. All the crazy shit out there? They're animals. You know what? Here. What is it? Take it. It's for you. You gotta protect yourself out there, otherwise you're gonna get fucked. Randall. I'm not supposed to have a gun. Don't sweat it, Art. No one has to know. And you can pay me back some other time. You know you're my boy. Arthur... Hoyt wants to see you in his office. Hey, Gary, you know what I've always wondered? No idea. Do you people call it miniature golf, or is it just golf to you? Punch him in the dick, Gary. Hello, Hoyt. Gary said you wanted to see me? How's the comedy career? You're a famous stand-up yet? Not quite. Just been working on my material. No, don't sit. This will be quick. Look. I like you, Arthur. You know, lot of the guys here think you're a freak, but I like you. I don't even know why I like you. But I got another complaint. And it's starting to piss me off. Kenny's Music. The guy said you disappeared. Never even returned his sign. Because I got jumped. Didn't you hear? For a sign? It's bullshit. It doesn't make sense, just give him his sign back. He's going out of business for God's sake, Arthur. Why would I keep that sign? How the fuck do I know? Why does anybody do anything? If you don't return the sign, I got to take it out of your pay check. Are we clear? Listen, I'm trying to help you. Okay? Now I tell you something else. The other guys, they don't feel comfortable around you, Arthur. Because people think you're weird, okay? And I can't have that around me. I want it-- I want it to work out--- Wait, wait, wait! Wait! Thank you. This building is so awful, isn't it? This building is so awful, right, mommy? Yeah, sweetie. I hear you, GiGi. It's so awful, mommy. Right, mommy? - It's fine. - This building's so awful, isn't it? Hey. Come on. Head up. Maybe the mailman is throwing them away. Mom, why are these letters so important to you? - What do you think he's gonna do? - He's gonna help us. You worked for them, what? 30 years ago? Why would he help us? Because Thomas Wayne is a good man. If he knew how we were living, if he saw this place, it would make him sick. I can't explain it to you any better than that. I don't want you worrying about money. Or me. Everybodys telling me that my stand-up is ready for the big clubs. But, Happy, what makes you think you could do that? - What do you mean? - I mean... don't you have to be funny to be a comedian? Hey, what's your name? Arthur. Hey, Arthur. You're a really good dancer. I know. And who is not? Him. Happy! What was that? Are you okay? Mom, what? That noise! Did you hear that noise? I'm-- I'm watching an old war movie! Turn it down! It's hard, mom. It's nice to see these couples are at my show. I have a wife, we love to role play. Yes. Yes, very sexy. My favorite one right now is... professor and senior who really needs to pass my class to graduate. Yes. So I tell you how I operate. I'm a professor at a prestigious New England university. And my wife is a senior in my intro to western civ. I know, I know, why is she-- why is she a senior in intro? I didn't buy it either. So she comes to me during my office hours, Monday and Wednesday 3:00 to 5:00, and she says, - excuse me, professor Lewis. I can't use my real last name at this collage 'cause they don't hire Jews. Something I'll address once I have a tenure, but for now. She says, - excuse me professor Lewis. I think I might be in danger of failing intro to western civ. and I just want you to know I'm willing to do anything to pass. I said \"anything?\", and she says \"Aah\". Oh. Hey. Hey. Were you following me today? Yeah. I thought that was you. I was hoping you'd come in and rob the place. I have a gun. I'll come by tomorrow. You're so funny, Arthur. Yeah... You know, I--I do stand-up comedy. You should maybe come and see a show sometime. I could do that. Yeah? Yeah. You let me know when? Yeah. If you're happy and you know it, wiggle your ears If you're happy and you know it, wiggle your ears Ifyou're happy and you know it, and you feel it, well, just show it If you're happy and you know it, wiggle your ears If you're happy and you know it, stomp your feet If you're happy and you know it, stomp your feet If you're happy and you know it, and you feel it, well, just show it If you're happy and you know it, stomp your feet If you're happy and you know it, shout \"Hooray\" If you're happy and you know it, shout \"Hooray\" If you're happy and you know it, and you feel it,--- Hoyt, please. I love this job. Arthur, I need to know why you brought a gun into a kids hospital. It's a part. It's part of my act now. That's bullshit! Bullshit! What kind of a clown carries a fucking gun? Besides, Randall told me you tried to buy a .38 off him last week. - Randall told you that? - You 're fuck up, Arthur. And a liar. You're fired! I'm telling you, she wanted my number. We should have just stayed. You're dreaming, man. She wasn't interested... at all. Are you nuts? Did you see how close we were dancing!? She was in love, bro. She couldn't wait to get away from you. Ryan. Ryan, am I crazy? Tell him what you saw. Hey. You want some french fries? Hello....? - I'm talking to you. Hey. - No, thank you. You sure? They're really good. Don't ignore him. He's being nice to you. Is something funny, asshole? Bitch! Isn't it rich? Are we a pair? Me here, at last on the ground You in mid-air Send in the clowns. Isn't it bliss? Don't you approve? Please. Don't. One who keeps tearing around, One who can't move. Where are the clowns? There ought to be clowns. So, buddy, tell us. What's so fucking funny? Nothing. I--- I have a--- I have a condition. I'll tell you what you have, asshole. We've got a kicker, huh? Hey, hold him steady, hold him steady. Stay down, freak! No! No! Hey! Help! Help! Hey! Stay clear of the closing doors. I read it was a guy in a full make-up. No, it says right here it was a mask. Either way, I think it's good for business. They got clowns in front of every newspaper. - Big man, what's the good word? - Hey. Hey, Arthur. I heard what happened. Sorry, mate. Yeah, it doesn't seem fair, you get fired like that. Did you really bring a gun to the children's hospital, Arty? What the fuck would you do that for? Is that part of your new act, Arthur? If your dancing doesn't do the trick, you just gonna shoot yourself? Why don't you ask Randall about it? It was his gun. - What? - I still owe you for that, don't I? What the fuck are you talking about? Stop talking outta your ass, Art! Oh, no! I forgot to punch out. And as our city tries to make sense of the brutal triple murder on the subway last week. We're joined by Thomas Wayne. - Happy, look. Thomas Wayne's on TV. - He has a personnel connection - Yes, mother. - this tragedy. Thanks for having me on show. They're asking him about those horrible subway murders. Thank you, Thomas. I know this is a difficult time for you. - Why him? - These young men all were... Looks like his compaign. Yes, all three of them worked for Wayne investments. Good, decent, educated, although, I didn't know any of them personally. Like all the Wayne employees, past and present, they were family. You hear that! I told you. We're family. There now seems to be a a groundswell of anti-rich sentiment in the city. It's almost as if our less fortunate residents are taken the side of the killer. Yes and it's a shame. It's one of the reasons why I'm considering a run for mayor. Gotham has lost its way. What about the eyewitness report of the suspect being a man in a clown mask? Well, it makes total sense to me. What kind of a coward would do something that cold-blooded ? Someone who hides behind a mask. Someone who is envious of those more fortunate than themselves, yet they're too scared to show their own face. And until all those kind of people change for the better.. those of us who've made something of our lives, will always look at those who haven't as nothing but clowns. Thomas Wayne, thank you for coming in this morning. It's not funny. I heard this song on the radio the other day. And the guy was singing, that his name was Carnival. - Arthur. - It's just crazy, because that's my clown name. At work. But until a while ago it was like nobody ever saw me. Even I didn't know if I really existed. Arthur, I have some bad news for you. You don't listen, do you? I don't think you ever really hear me. You just ask the same questions every week: \"How was your job?\" \"Are you having any negative thoughts?\" All I have are negative thoughts. But you don't listen. Anyway, I said, for my whole life I didn't know if I even really existed. But I do. And people are starting to notice. They've cut our funding. We're closing down our offices next week. The city's cut funding across the board, social services is part of that. This is the last time we will be meeting. Okay. They don't give a shit about people like you, Arthur. And they really don't give a shit about people like me, either. Oh, fuck. How am I supposed to get my medication now? Who do I talk to? I'm sorry, Arthur. I think, uh-- I think most women look at sex like buying a car. You know, like, \"can I see myself in this long term?\" Is it safe. Is it reliable? Could it kill me? Most guys look at sex like parking a car. We're like \"there's a spot\". \"There is another spot, that would work.\" \"Oh, I have to pay? Never mind.\" \"Handicapped? Hope no one sees us.\" Alright that's my time. Thank you very much, guys. One more time, ya' all. Alright, this next comic describes himself as a lifelong Gotham resident who from a young age was always told that: \"his purpose in life was to bring laughter and joy into this cold, dark world.\" Umm.. okay. Please help me welcome Arthur Fleck, ya' all. Arthur Fleck. Hello, it's good to be here--- I hate-- I---I hated school as a kid. I hated school as a-- as a kid. But my mother would always say, - \"you should enjoy it. One day you'll have to work for a living.\" \"No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a comedian!\" Here is one. You know, I was just thinking the other day, why are the rich people so--- Do you believe that shit? Fuck 'em! I think the guy that did it is a hero. Three less pricks in Gotham city, only a million more to go. I know what you're gonna be thinking. And buddy, as always thanks for the laughs. Sure, will see you again. You will be here, right? I hope. Tomorrow night, we have Diana Hudson, Grieg Gordon, and animal expert Hugh Little. Thanks for watching. Good night. And always remember \"That's Life\". That's life. Mom, time to wake up. We go to bed. No, Happy. I wrote him a new letter. Come on, dance with me. For Thomas Wayne. That's important. You smell like cologne. Because I just had a big date. Just don't forget to mail it. You're gonna kill me! You're gonna give me a hard time! - I won't give you a--- - No! No! I'm not talking to you until you stop being angry! Okay. Okay. I'm not angry, mom. I'm not angry. Please. Mom, is this real? He is an extraordinary man, Happy. He is a very powerful man. We were in love. He said it was best if we would not be together because of appearances. And I couldnt tell anyone because, well, I signed some papers. And besides, you can imagine what people would say about Thomas and me and... what theyd say about you. What would they say, mom? Hi. What's your name? I'm Bruce. Bruce. I'm Arthur. That's better. Bruce! Bruce! - Get away from that man. - It's okay. I'm a good guy. What are you doing? Who are you? I'm here to see Mr. Wayne. Well, you shouldn't be speaking to his son. - Where did you get him these flowers? - No, they're not real. It's...magic. - I was just trying to make him smile. - Well, It's not funny, is it? Do I need to call the police? No, please. My mother's name is Penny. Penny Fleck. She used to work here years ago. Can you please tell Mr. Wayne I need to see him? You're her son? Yeah. Did you know her? I know about the two of them. She told me everything. There's nothing to know. There is no \"them\". Your mother was delusional. - She was a sick woman. - Don't say that. Just go. Before you make a fool of yourself. - Thomas Wayne is my farther. He left me! Let go! Keep your respirations around 15. Slow, there're some stairs coming up. Mom? - What happened? - Who are you? - I'm her son. - Oh, great. - What happened? - You can probably help us out to decide. - We don't know what happened yet. - Hop in the back of the ambulance. Come on. We have one more left. I'm getting a little resistence here. Come on, give her a lift. Position her head. Lift. Excuse me, sir. - Does your mother take any medications? - No. - Excuse me, I can't hear you. - No. - Sir, what was the last time you spoke to her? - I don't know. Mr. Fleck. Sorry to bother you. I'm detective Garrity. This is my partner detective Burke. We had a few questions for you, but you werent home. So... we spoke with your mother. Oh. What did you say to her? - Did you do this? - What? No. No, no. No, we just asked her some questions. And she got hysterical.. hyperventilating, then collapsed and hit her head pretty hard. Yeah, the doctor said she had a stroke. We're sorry to hear about that. But like I said, I still has some questions for you. They're about the subway killings that happened last week. - You've heard about them, right? - Yeah. - It's horrible. - Right. So with spoke with your boss over at...Ha-Ha's. He said you were fired for bringing a gun into the children's hospital. - Is that true, Mr. Fleck? - It was a prop. It was part of my act. I'm a party clown. Alright, so why were you fired? They said I wasn't funny enough. Can you imagine that? If you don't mind, I have to go and take care of my mother. Your boss also gave us one of your cards. This condition of yours, laughing. Is it real, or some sort of a clown thing? - \"A clown thing?\" - Yeah. I mean, part of your act? What do you think? It's exit only. She's gonna be okay. I'll get a coffee. - You want one? - Yeah. So, the other night I told my youngest son, Billy, you know, the new one, the-- not so bright one, I-- I told him the garbage strike is still going on, Billy,.. and he says, and I'm not kidding, Billy says, \"So where are we gonna get all our garbage from?\". And finally, in a world where everyone thinks they could do my job, we got this video tape from Pogo's comedy club right here in Gotham. Here's a guy who thinks if you just keep laughing, it'll somehow make you funny. Check out this joker. Oh, no! I hated school as a kid. But my mother would always say, \"You know, you should enjoy it. One day you'll have to work for a living.\" \"No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a comedian!\" You should have listened to your mother. And one more. One more, Bobby. Uh...let's see one more. I love this guy. It's funny. When I was a little boy and told people I was gonna be a comedian, everyone laughed at me. Well, no one's laughing now. You can say that again, pal. Alright, - We've got a great show for you tonight. - Sure. --here actress Joan Mulligan, and new music from Melruban and the stiff. As tensions mount around the metro area mayor Stokes has pleaded for cooler heads to prevail. City services has been affected and some businesses have decided to remain closed amid the unrest. Chuck Stevens filed this report. The anger and resentment that's been building in the city for weeks seem close to exploding. Protesters, many dressed as clowns, took the streets today in one of the several demonstrations taking on the city's elite, including a massive rally outside the Wayne home. What's the point of all this? Fuck the rich! Fuck Mr. Wayne. That's what this all fucking thing was about. Fuck all this system! Wayne, who recently announced his running for mayor will be attending the benefit. You might remember, it was Thomas Wayne who first referred to many of Gotam's residents as \"clowns\". Today, he offered little in way of an apology. Well, what I will say is, there's something wrong with those people. And I'm here to help them. I'm gonna lift them out of poverty, help make they're lives better. That's why I'm running. They may not realize it, but I'm their only hope. Down with Wayne! Down with Wayne! - Down with Wayne! - Down with Wayne! - Down with Wayne! - Down with Wayne! Can I help you, pal? I don't know what to say. Do you want an autograph or something? No. My name is Arthur. Penny Fleck is my mother. Jesus. You're the guy that came to my house yesterday? Yes. I'm sorry I just showed up. Well, my mother told me everything. And I had to talk to you, - you know? - Look, pal, I'm not your father. I mean, what's wrong with you? Look at us. - I think you are. - Well, that's impossible. Because you were adopted and I never slept with your mother. What do you want from me, money? No. I don't want. - I wasn't adopted. - Jesus. She never told you? Told me what? Your mother adopted you while she was working for us. That's not true. Why are you saying that? Because she was arrested and committed to Arkham State Hospital ..when you were just a little boy. Why are you saying this? I don't need you to tell me lies. I know it seems strange. I don't mean to make you uncomfortable. I don't why everyone is so rude, and I don't why you are, I don't want anything from you. Maybe a little bit of warmth, maybe a hug dad! How much as a little bit of fucking decency? What is it with you people?! Did you see the way suffer my mother? - She's crazy. - She's-- huh-huh! - You think this is funny? - Yeah---huh-huh! Dad, it's me! Come on---huh--huh! You touch my son again, I'll fucking kill you! Hello, Mr. Fleck. This is detective Garrity. We met the other night at the Gotham General. My partner and I had a few more questions for you. We stopped by your apartment today, but you weren't at home. Please, give me a call when you've heard this message. Again, this is detective Garrity. My number is 212---99. Uh, this message is for Arthur Fleck. My name is Shirley Woods, I work on the Murray Franklin show. I don't know if you're aware, but Murray played a clip of your stand-up on the show recently and we've gotten an amazing response from our viewers. And Mr. Murray asked me to give you a call and see if you're--- Who is this? Oh. Hi, this is Shirley Woods. I'm the show-booker from Live With Murray Franklin. Is this Arthur? Yes. Hi, Arthur. Well, and as I was saying, we've gotten a lot of calls about your clip, amazing responses. And, Murray asked if I would reach out to you to see if you would come on as his guest. Murray wants me to come on the Murray Franklin show? Yeah. Isn't that great? He'd love to talk to you, maybe do some of your act. Does that sound good to you? Yeah, that's sounds great. Can we set up a date right now? Are you available next Thursday? Hey. Wooh. Man. Sorry about that, my man. All our records that are 10 years or older are stored in the basement and you're talking about something' 30 years ago, so. Can I ask you a question? Sure. How does someone wind up in here? Have they all--- all the people committed crimes? Oh, yeah. Some have. Some are just crazy and pose a danger to themselves or others. Some just got nowhere else to go. Don't know what to do, you know? - Yeah, I hear you, brother. Sometimes, I don't know what to do. Last time I ended up taking it out on some people. I thought it was gonna bother me but, it really hasn't. What's that? I fucked up. I've done some bad shit. Um... You know what I'm talking about. Its so hard just to try and be happy all the time. Hey, um, listen, man... I'm just an administrative assistant. Like a clerk, you know. All I do is file paperwork, I don't know what to tell you, but you should see somebody. They have programs, city services, stuff like that. Oh, yeah. They cut all those. All right. Here it is. Fleck. Penny Fleck. I see. Diagnosed by Dr. Benjamin Stoner... Oh, the patient suffers from delusional psychosis and narcissistic personality disorder...hm. Was found guilty of endangering the welfare of her own child-- What? You said she's your mother? I'm sorry,man. Like I said, I can't release these records, you know, without the proper forms. I--I could get in trouble. Look, if you wanna bring your mom in here to sign, that would be much easier, but, I can't-- I can't let this go without a signature, okay? I'm sorry. No, man! Come on, man! Give it to me! Hey! Hey! We went over this, Penny. You adopted him. We have all the paperwork right here. That's not true. Thomas had them all made up, so it stayed our secret. You also stood by as one of your boyfriends repeatedly abused your adopted son and battered you. Penny, your son was found tied to a radiator in your filthy apartment, malnourished, with multiple bruises across his body and severe trauma to his head. I never heard him crying. He's always been such a happy little boy. Shh...it's time for bed. Oh, my god! What are you doing in here? You're in the wrong apartment. Your name is Arthur, right? You live down the hall. I really need you to leave. My little girl is sleeping in the other room. Please. I've had a bad day. Can I call someone? Is your mother home? Hi, Penny. Penny Fleck. I always hated that name. You know, you used to tell me that my laugh was a condition, that there are something wrong with me. There isn't. Thats the real me. Ha--appy \"Happy\". Funny. I haven't been happy for one minute of my entire fucking life. You know what's funny? You know what really makes me laugh? I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realize that's a fucking comedy. A very fine actor. He's got a new movie called 'American Playboy', opening this week across the country. Will you please welcome a good friend of the show, Mr. Ethan Chase. Good to see you, Ethan. You looking great. Thank you very much. You look good yourself. Ah, can't complain.

I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly Hey, Arthur. How's it going? Oh, hi, guys. Come on in. Did you, uh, get a new gig? No. Oh, you must be going down to that rally at City Hall.

Uh, I don't know if you're heard, but.. the cops had been calling around the shop talking all the guys about those subway murders. They didn't talk to me. That's because the suspect was a regular sized person. If it was a fucking midget you'd be in jail right now. Anyway, um... Hoyt said that, um... they talked to you and now they're looking for me--- I just want to know what you said.

Two officer on the train were violently confronted by the crowd tonight and they're in serious but stable condition at Gotham Metropolitan. We're going live now to co-anchor Courtney Weathers who's standing by outside the Bedford park station near where the shooting took place. Courtney, what's the scene there? - Murray! - Hey, hey, hey! - It's \"Mr. Franklin!\". - Oh, come on, Gene. That's all bullshit. Thank you, Murray. I feel like I know you. I've been watching you forever. Thank you. What's with the face? That mean that you we're part of the protest? No. No. No, I don't believe in any of that. I don't believe in anything. I just thought it would be good for my act. For your act? Didn't you hear what happened on the subway? - Some clown got killed. - He's aware of that, yeah. No, I haven't heard. - Yeah? - You see ,this is what Im telling you. the audience is gonna go crazy if you put this guy on. Maybe-- maybe for a bit, but not a whole segment. Gene, It's gonna work. It's gonna work. We're gonna go with it. Thank you, Murray. Couple of rules though: No cursing, no off-color material, - we do a clean show, okay? You go on right after Dr. Sally. - I love Dr. Sally. - Good! Good, good. - Well, someone will come and get you, okay? - Okay. Perfect. - Good luck. - Thanks, Murray. Okay. Hey, Murray... one small thing. - Yeah? - When you bring me out can you introduce me as \"Joker\"? What's wrong with your real name? That's what you called me on the show. A Joker. Do you remember? - Did I? - Yeah, I don't know. Well, if you say so, kid, you know, joker it is. - It's good. - Thanks, Murray. I would try it, you know, but I'm not sure my wife would let me do it. Maybe my next wife. You gotta see our next guest for yourself. I'm pretty sure this guy can use a doctor. Oh, does he have a sexual problem? He looks like he's got a lot of problems. Alright, Let's show that clip one last time. I hated school as a kid. But my mother would always say, \"You should enjoy it. One day you'll have to work for a living.\" \"No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a comedian!\" Okay, you may have seen that clip of our next guest. Now, before he comes out, I just want to say that we're all heartbroken about what's going on in the city tonight. But, this is how he wanted to come out. And, honestly, I think we could all use a good laugh. So, please welcome \"Joker\". Are you alright, doctor? Well, that was... quite an interest. You okay? Oh, yeah. This is exactly how I imagined it. Well, that makes one of us. So, can you tell us about this look? When we spoke earlier, you mentioned that this look is not a political statement, is that right? That's right, Murray. I'm not political. I'm just trying to make people laugh. And how's that goin' for ya? It's alright. It's alright. So, I know you're a comedian. Have you been working on any new material? You want to tell us a joke? Yeah? Okay. He's got a book. A book of jokes. Take your time. We go all night. Okay. Okay. Here's one. Knock-knock. And you had to look that up? I wanted to get it right. Knock-knock. Who's there? It's the Police, ma'am. Your son has been hit by a drunk driver. He's dead. Oh, no, no, no! No, you cannot joke about that. Yeah, that's not funny, Arthur. That's not the kind of humor we do on this show. Okay, I'm s-- Yeah, I'm sorry. It's just, you know, it's been a rough few weeks, Murray, ever since I killed those three wall-street guys. Okay. I'm waiting for the punchline. There is no punchline. It's not a joke. You're serious, aren't you? You're telling us you killed those three young men on the subway? - M-hm. - And why should we believe you? I've got nothing left to lose. Nothing can hurt me anymore. My life is nothing but a comedy. Let me get this straight, you think that killing those guys is funny? I do. And I'm tired of pretending it's not. Comedy is subjective, Murray. Isn't that what they say? All of you, the system that knows so much, you decide what's right or wrong the same way that you decide what's funny... or not. Get him off! Well, okay, I--I think I might understand that you did this to start a movement, to become a symbol. Come on, Murray, do I look like the kind of a clown that could start a movement? I killed those guys because they were awful. Everybody's awful these days. It's enough to make anyone crazy. Okay. So that's it, you're crazy. That's your defense for killing three young men? Nah. They couldn't carry a tune to save their lives. Oh! Why is everybody so upset about these guys? If it was me dying on the side-walk, you'd walk right over me. I pass you everyday and you don't notice me! but these guys, what, because Thomas Wayne went and cried about them on TV? Well, you have a problem with Thomas Wayne,too? Yes, I do. Have you seen what it's like out there, Murray? Do you ever actually leave the studio? Everybody just yells and screams at each other. Nobody's civil anymore! Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy. You think men like Thomas Wayne ever think what it's like to be someone like me? To be somebody but themselves? They don't. They think that we'll just sit there and take it like good little boys! That we won't werewolf and go wild. You finished? I mean, there is so much self-pity, Arthur. You sound like you're making excuses for killing those young men. Not everybody- and I'll tell you this- not everyone is awful. - But you're awful, Murray. - Me? I'm awful? Oh, yeah? How am I awful? Playing my video, inviting me on the show--- You just wanted to make fun of me. You're just like the rest of 'em. You don't know the first thing about me, pal. Look what happened because of what you did, what it led to. There are riots out there. Two policemen are in critical condition and you're laughing. You're laughing. Someone was killed today because of what you did. I know. How about a another joke, Murray? No, I think we got enough of your jokes. - What do you get.. - I don't think so. ..when you cross a mentally-ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? Call the police, Gene. - I'll tell you what you get. - Call the police! You get what you fucking deserve! Good night. And always remember. That's-- Breaking news. Popular TV talk show host Murray Franklin was shot dead tonight on the live telecast of his program by one of his guests. --the man who was introduced by Franklin as \"Joker\" is currently under arrest-- -- The police led the suspect handcuffed out of the studio-- - ...when asking him what he did.. - ...merely just a punchline to a joke... - Would you like another joke? - I don't think so. ...with the society that abandons him and treats him like trash. If it was me dying on the side-walk, you'd walk right over me! To all of those who have been ignored by the system-- --and as you can see, Gotham is burning--- Stop laughing you freak. This isn't funny. We have the whole fucking city's on fire because of what you did. All units, fire reported. North of ally. I know. Isn't it beautiful? Let's go over there. Hey, Wayne. You get what you fucking deserve. No, pal! Joker! Joker! What's so funny? I just think-- --just thinking of this joke. You wanna tell it to me? You wouldn't get it. --that's life. (that's life) and as funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stompin' on a dream But I don't let it, let it get me down 'Cause this fine old world it keeps spinnin' around I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate A poet, a pawn and a king I've been up and down and over and out And I know one thing Each time I find myself laying flat on my face I just pick myself up and get back in the race - That's life - (that's life) That's life and I tell ya, I can't deny it Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it But if there's nothing shakin' come here this July I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die My, my Subtitled By Nilnuwan ( With the help of Leaked Script)",
