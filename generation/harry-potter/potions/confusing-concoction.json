  "content": "The Confusing Concoction,[1] also known as Confusing Draught,[2] was a potion which caused confusion in the drinker. Its known ingredients were scurvy grass, lovage, and sneezewort.[2]\n\nIn 1994, Harry Potter and his classmates had to brew some for his third-year Potions exam, but was unable to get his batch to thicken, as was required. He thought he saw Severus Snape giving him a zero.[1]\n\nIn 1995, Harry Potter read about Confusing Draughts while trying to complete homework one night in his fifth year. His mind was so consumed by worried thoughts that he repeatedly read the same passage of text and then fell asleep with the book still in his hands.[2]",
