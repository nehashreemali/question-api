  "content": "The Sleeping Draught,[2] also known as the Sleeping Potion,[6] was a potion that caused the drinker to fall almost instantaneously into a deep but temporary sleep.[2][1] A standard Sleeping Draught differed from the Draught of Living Death, which was much more powerful, long-lasting, and difficult to brew. Hermione Granger referred to the Sleeping Draught as \"simple, but powerful\".[7] Its recipe could be found in Magical Drafts and Potions[1] and the Book of Potions.[6]\n\nIts usual ingredients included Flobberworm Mucus, lavender, Valerian sprigs and Standard Ingredient. One could identify the concentration, and therefore the strength, of a Sleeping Draught based on its consistency and the shade of purple; when brewed correctly, the potion should have had an even consistency and turned a dark purple colour,[1] however the potion wasn't dangerous at all, even when brewed incorrectly, as different concentrations of the potion would only affect how long the drinker was asleep for.[8]\n\nAt some point in history, the wizard Norville Bezerko spiked the Butterbeer mug belonging to his love rival Perseus Ecklington with Sleeping Draught, so he could marry Daisy Twemlove instead. He was presumed dead, and was buried in a coffin. However, at his \"funeral\", he awoke as the potion had worn off, and fought and defeated Bezerko in a duel.[6]\n\nDuring the 1984–1985 school year at Hogwarts, Penny Haywood helped create a Sleeping Draught for Jacob's sibling to use on Mrs Norris in order to break into a locked room where they were looking for the Cursed Vaults.[3]\n\nJacob's sibling later successfully used the Sleeping Draught to subdue Mrs Norris outside the locked room, allowing them, Rowan Khanna and another friend of theirs undisturbed entry. Mrs Norris drank the Sleeping Draught in a pool on the floor, and fell asleep immediately.[4]\n\nDuring the 1986–1987 school year, Penny brewed a Sleeping Draught to help catch a Demiguise which had stolen sweets from Hogsmeade and Hogwarts. She and her friends used the potion to coat some candies which they used as part of a trap. Putting it to sleep made it visible, allowing its capture.[9]\n\nOn 25 December 1992, Hermione Granger spiked two, plump chocolate cakes with Sleeping Draught for use on Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, so they could be impersonated with Polyjuice Potion. Harry Potter and Ron Weasley left these cakes out for Crabbe and Goyle to find, and the two Slytherins greedily ate them, unquestioningly, and soon fell unconscious, with frozen expressions on their faces. Harry and Ron then hid Crabbe and Goyle in a broom cupboard and took some of their hairs for the Polyjuice Potion.[2]\n\nThe four dragons used in the first task of the Triwizard Tournament in late 1994 were given Sleeping Draught to make the trip from the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary to Hogwarts easier. Charlie Weasley stated that he thought it would be better for the dragons to awake in a tranquil setting, but, upon waking in the Forbidden Forest, the beasts were as vicious as ever. In Charlie's words, the team of dragonologists used \"a Sleeping Draught\" to knock out all four dragons, suggesting that a normal dose of the potion might be potent enough to have an effect on a creature as large and powerful as a dragon.[10]\n\nOn 31 August, Ginny Weasley asked Harry Potter if he wanted to take a Sleeping Draught in order to help him get back to sleep.[11]\n\nGethsemane Prickle made this potion for Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner to prevent a band of Muggle construction workers from entering a forest full of magical beasts during their search for Bethany Harrison.[12]",
