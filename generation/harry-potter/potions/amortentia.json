  "content": "Amortentia was the most powerful love potion in existence. It caused a powerful infatuation or obsession from the drinker. It had a distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen, and steam rose from it in characteristic spirals. Amortentia was considered an incredibly dangerous potion, as one should have never underestimated obsessive infatuation.[1]\n\nAmortentia was kept in a fountain or well in the Love Room in the Department of Mysteries, which Unspeakables would study.[3]\n\nIn February 1988 at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, around the time of Valentine's Day, Professor Severus Snape showed this potion to fifth-year students in Potions class in a large cauldron, as part of the school's celebration of the holiday.[4]\n\nIn September 1996, Professor Horace Slughorn introduced this potion to sixth-year students in Potions class, along with other advanced potions, such as Veritaserum and Polyjuice Potion, in order to show his students what kind of potions they would be able to brew after finishing their N.E.W.T.s in their seventh year. Hermione Granger identified all of Slughorn's potions correctly, including Amortentia, which very much earned his approval.[1]\n\nAmortentia was the most powerful love potion in existence. It was considered to be a powerful and highly dangerous potion. As stated, it was dangerous to underestimate a powerful infatuation. However, although certainly powerful, Amortentia did not create actual love, as it was impossible to manufacture or imitate love. The person under the effect of the potion would only hold an obsession for the person who administered it.[1]\n\nIt had a different aroma for everyone who smelt it, reminding each person of the things that they found most attractive, even if the person did not acknowledge or was unaware of their fondness for the object of their affection themselves; e.g. Hermione Granger smelt fresh cut grass, new parchment,[1] and Ron Weasley's hair.[5]\n\nHarry Potter smelt treacle tart, the woody scent of broomstick handle, and \"something flowery that he thought he might have smelled at The Burrow\" (which he later realised was the smell of Ginny Weasley).[6]\n\nAmor is a Roman god of love, and the word \"amour\" in French means \"love\". The word \"amor\" also means \"love\" in Spanish and Portuguese. \"Tentia\" is also Latin for \"held\".",
