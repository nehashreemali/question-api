  "content": "Veritaserum was a powerful Truth Serum.[1][2] The potion effectively forced the drinker to answer any questions put to them truthfully,[1][2] though there were certain methods of resistance.[6][7] Use of this potion was strictly controlled by the British Ministry of Magic.[1]\n\nDuring the 1989–1990 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Severus Snape was brewing this particular concoction when two of his students, Jacob's sibling and Merula Snyde, came to visit him in the Potions Classroom.[8]\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year at Hogwarts, seventh-year students in Potions class were taught by Professor Snape how to brew this advanced potion.[3] He also taught them how to brew the antidote to Veritaserum that school year as well.[9]\n\nLater during this year, Dolores Umbridge attempted to coerce Jacob's sibling to drink tea spiked with Veritaserum before the trial of Kazuhiro Shiratori in her office, although if they drank it or not is unknown. Their brother Jacob drank her horrible tea and fell under the potion's effects, being unable to tell lies when speaking to their sibling and Corey Hayden in Courtroom Ten. Not wanting him to testify under Veritaserum, Corey distracted and delayed the Wizengamot by saying a Doxy was present in the room, and the three went outside the courtoom so the potion's effects could wear off on Jacob before re-entering the trial.[10]\n\nVeritaserum was used on Barty Crouch Jnr in June of 1995, when Albus Dumbledore discovered that Crouch was disguised as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Alastor Moody.[2] Severus Snape also threatened Harry Potter with it earlier that year because he suspected that Harry had been stealing supplies from his storeroom necessary to brew the Polyjuice Potion.[1] This was prior to the discovery that Barty Crouch Jnr was in fact the one who had been stealing the ingredients to keep up his disguise as Alastor Moody.[2]\n\nDolores Umbridge attempted to use Veritaserum on Harry the following year, but to no effect. In actuality, Snape had presented her with a fake potion, and Harry only pretended to drink it, instead dumping it in one of her plants while she was occupied. Umbridge later asked for more Veritaserum after Harry broke into her office to contact Sirius Black, but Snape said it would take a month to make more. Instead, he suggested she use poisons on Harry if the situation were very grave. Snape also taunted her about using the entire bottle during one dosage rather than using the necessary three drops. As a result, Dolores put Snape on probation and tried to use the Cruciatus Curse on Harry. However, Hermione Granger, who was also present, intervened and pretended to tell Umbridge the truth, thus sparing Harry from the curse.[5]\n\nAt the beginning of the 1996–1997 school year, Horace Slughorn, the Potions Master, brewed Veritaserum as an example of the type of potion they should be able to make after completing their N.E.W.T.S.[4] Later, Harry suggested using it on Slughorn to collect a memory. Dumbledore discouraged this idea since he knew that Slughorn would not be fooled easily and could resist the potion with the antidote. Additionally, Dumbledore did not want to use force or coercion on the Potions Master, as betraying his trust in such a way would most likely result in his memory never being collected by Harry.[6]\n\nIn 1996, the Rosenfeld case fell apart after the Veritaserum used was accused of being tainted.[11] Later in 1997, Rita Skeeter used Veritaserum on Bathilda Bagshot while interviewing her for Albus Dumbledore's biography.[12]\n\nVeritaserum was clear and colourless, as well as odourless and tasteless. It was almost indistinguishable from water. According to Severus Snape, the potion had to mature for a full lunar cycle, and was quite difficult to produce;[5] it was something Horace Slughorn expected his students to be able to produce once they finished their N.E.W.T.-level Potions.[4]\n\nIt could be mixed with pretty much any drink, and three drops was a sufficient dose to make the drinker \"spill out his innermost secrets\".[1] Thus, the potion forced the drinker to tell the complete truth to any question put to them, according to what the drinker perceived as true.[2]\n\nSince some wizards and witches could resist its effects while others could not, Veritaserum was \"unfair and unreliable to use at a trial\", and would have been difficult to use as definitive proof of guilt or innocence.[citation needed]\n\nAnother problem was that the victim stated what only they believed to be true, so the victim's sanity and perception of reality were also factors during interrogations. Therefore, while the drinker's answers were sincere, they were not necessarily true. This was the main reason why Barty Crouch Jnr's testimony was only partially credible,[2] as some of his answers were true in his mind, but known to be false by his interrogators.[2] Cornelius Fudge believed that Crouch being a \"raving lunatic\" was a mitigating factor on the Veritaserum's full effectiveness, thus he chose not to believe half of his testimony.[13] However, despite Crouch's sociopathic and unhinged tendencies, his grip on reality and testimony was just.[14]\n\nUsing Veritaserum on a student was strictly forbidden, at least in Hogwarts, a prohibition that Severus Snape considered \"regrettable.\"[15]\n\nDespite being the most powerful truth serum in existence, it could still be resisted through different methods, including the taking of its antidote[6][9] and Occlumency.[7]\nThe potion's effects could also wear off over a short period of time.[10]\n\nThe name comes from the Latin words veritas, meaning \"truth\", and serum, meaning \"fluid\" or \"liquid\".\n\nJ. K. Rowling has said that Veritaserum \"works best upon the unsuspecting, the vulnerable and those insufficiently skilled (in one way or another) to protect themselves against it... just like every other kind of magic within the books, Veritaserum is not infallible.\"[14] For this reason, she explained that even if Sirius Black had been given the opportunity to testify to his innocence under Veritaserum, the Wizengamot likely still would have found him guilty by claiming that Sirius was using trickery to be immune to it.[16]",
