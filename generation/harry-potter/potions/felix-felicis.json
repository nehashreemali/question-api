  "content": "Felix Felicis, also called \"Liquid Luck\", was a potion that made the drinker lucky for a period of time, during which everything they attempt would be successful. It turned an ordinary day into an extraordinary one.[1][2] It was very difficult to make, disastrous if made wrong, and required six months to brew before it was ready to be consumed.[4]\n\nIt was meant to be used sparingly, as it caused the drinker to succumb to giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence if taken in excess. It was also highly toxic in large quantities. Felix Felicis was a banned substance in all organised competitions, such as Quidditch, along with all other methods of cheating.[1][2]\n\nZygmunt Budge invented this potion in the 16th century and deemed it his greatest accomplishment ever, dubbing it \"the crowning achievement of [his] career\".[2]\n\nIn the 19th century, Asuka used Felix Felicis to ensure that she and her friend Chiyo Kogawa would flawlessly perform during their try-outs to join the Toyohashi Tengu Quidditch team. However, Chiyo realized what her friend had done upon noticing that their results far exceeded their usual abilities and felt ashamed that her success was due to Felix Felicis. She thus withdrew from the try-outs, but never revealed that Asuka had cheated and secured her place among the Tengu thanks to Felix Felicis.[5]\n\nHorace Slughorn claimed that he used the potion twice in his life: once when he was twenty-four years old, and again when he was fifty-seven, each resulting in a perfect day.[1]\n\nDuring the 1989–1990 school year, Beatrice Haywood, following Ismelda Murk's advice, stole Ashwinder eggs, Murtlap Tentacles and Occamy Eggshells from Professor Snape's personal stores in order to secretly brew Felix Felicis in Classroom 3C, with Merula Snyde and Penny Haywood as well, as they believed it would be necessary for the Circle of Khanna to possess and use if needed.[6]\n\nOn 2 September 1996, Harry Potter won a small vial of Felix Felicis from Professor Slughorn for brewing the best Draught of Living Death in Potions (using the instructions of his textbook). The bottle would give Harry twelve hours of luck.[1]\n\nHarry later pretended to add a small amount to Ron Weasley's drink at breakfast before a Quidditch game so that Ron would feel more confident about his abilities. Hermione noticed what Harry did, and believing that he had actually put something in Ron's drink, warned Ron not to take a drink. He ignored her and drank the pumpkin juice, and he then went on to play a nearly perfect game. Following the game, Hermione berated Harry for what he had done, and Harry told her and Ron that he had not given Ron the potion at all, and that Ron played that well all by himself.[7]\n\nThe first real use of the potion by Harry was in attaining an important memory from Slughorn when Ron suggested it; he was originally hesitant in using it, as he wanted to use it to win Ginny Weasley's affections. He took only a small dosage, for roughly three hours worth.[8] Along the way to Rubeus Hagrid's hut, he inadvertantly caused the breakup between Ron Weasley and Lavender Brown, while also causing the death blow to Ginny Weasley's relationship with Dean Thomas. The second use was distributed between Ron, Hermione Granger, and Ginny in the battle against the Death Eaters in their invasion of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[9]\n\nIn between the potion's first and second use, Harry suggested using some to discover what Draco Malfoy was up to in the Room of Requirement, but Hermione advised against it as it would be a waste on using it on a powerful defensive location such as the Room. When Ron suggested they brew more for themselves, Harry found the potion's complexity and time-consumption to be too much of a hassle.[4]\n\nThis potion had been stated to greatly resemble molten gold, with droplets leaping out at intervals like goldfish soaring from their bowl. It was noted that the drops of potion that leapt across the surface never spilt and that the potion splashed about merrily when in a cauldron.[3]\n\nFelix Felicis caused the drinker to have good luck for a limited period of time, during which they were likely to to succeed in all endeavours in which success was possible. The more of it the drinker ingested the longer their good luck would last, one small vial would be about twelve hours worth.[1][2] They had a strong perception of this effect, including a high level of confidence and a \"sensation of infinite opportunity\". This was accomplished not through direct application of force or granting the drinker any extraordinary powers, but by inspiring the drinker with a favourable pathway through the circumstances.\n\nWhen Harry Potter took the potion, he had the sensation that 'Felix' knew what it was doing and that he needed only follow its inspiration, however unlikely the approach seemed as a means of accomplishing his goal. It indeed led him into a near-freakish but plausible set of circumstances in which all the right choices seemed obvious to him. Along the way, without even meaning to, he also accomplished some minor side goals, such as breaking up Ron Weasley's bad relationship with Lavender Brown, and destabilising Ginny Weasley's relationship with Dean Thomas to give Harry more of a chance with her.[8]\n\nIt could be said that Felix Felicis allowed the drinker to become somewhat in tune with their own fate, enlightening the user with the ability to intuitively tell what actions they need to take in order to lead to their desired consequences.\n\nA person under the potion's inspiration would likely prove highly adaptable to any unexpected change in the circumstances. There were always infinite possibilities in any situation, some of which doubtless lead to the desired outcome, and Felix could highlight them no matter what happened.[8]\n\nThough Felix Felicis conferred no extra powers on the user, it seemed capable of drawing out the best reserves of their ability if needed. Harry was able to use Refilling Charms non-verbally, even though he had not yet managed it in his previous classroom practice.[8]\n\nThere was a period of 'coming down' when Felix Felicis wore off. During this time, the user's sense of confidence faded, and unlucky circumstances could quickly catch up to them if they were not vigilant.[10]\n\nA slight alteration to the potion caused the drinker to have bad luck instead of good luck. Professor Severus Snape, aware of how tempting Felix Felicis was to students, kept a vial of this unlucky Felix Felicis and deliberately made the security around it lax so that anyone attempting to steal it would wind up with bad luck instead of good luck.[11]\n\nAs Hermione Granger pointed out, the potion was not able to better the chances of the drinker against particularly powerful enchantments,[4] since members of Dumbledore's Army were not able to bypass the Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder that Draco Malfoy used.[12] Hermione also claimed that Harry's usage of the potion to help discover what Draco was up to in the Room of Requirement would be a waste, as the Room was too powerful for the potion to help penetrate.[4]\n\nThe potion's effectiveness seemed to wane after a certain amount of time, as it did in Harry Potter's situation when he made his way back to the Gryffindor common room and he ran into Peeves, but was only just barely able to dodge him with the potion's influence.[8]\n\nOverdosing was dangerous, as it was highly toxic in large quantity,[1][2] and over-reliance on it may have led to dangerous overconfidence, giddiness, and recklessness. The potion was very difficult and time-consuming to brew, and disastrous if concocted incorrectly. Due to its effects, it was considered a tool of cheating and therefore prohibited in organised events such as Quidditch and academic examinations.[2]\n\nBrewing the potion itself was also an arguable challenge, since even with the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion Making at hand, Harry noted that concocting his own batch of Felix Felicis was \"seriously complicated\". And given how Hermione reacted when Slughorn confirmed the potion's identity during their first Potions class along with how inadvisable it was to excessively imbibe it, it can be assumed that the potion was indeed very rarely, if ever, successfully brewed even by skilled potioneers - making Slughorn's ability to do so particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe potion could also turn foetid if left to sit for too long, resulting in the drinker undergoing wild misadventures rather than its intended purpose.[13]\n\nWhen Harry Potter used Felix Felicis, several events occurred that were beneficial to Harry and his friends; the main being Harry obtaining the memory from Slughorn. Harry only took a small portion, for roughly two-to-three hours of effect. Harry obtained the uncorrupted memory from Horace Slughorn about Horcruxes. During this adventure, evidence of luck was following him.[8]\n\nHarry was able to keep his word to his friend Rubeus Hagrid and attend Aragog's funeral.[8] Filch had left the front doors of the castle unlocked, so he was able to wonder the grounds.[8] Slughorn was tempted to accompany Harry to Hagrid's by the possibility of obtaining valuable Acromantula venom.[8]\n\nHarry was able to use a nonverbal Refilling Charm, even though he had not completely mastered this charm nonverbally, so Slughorn would not run out of drink (in order to get him drunk).[8]\n\nHarry bumped into Ginny as they passed each other at the portrait entryway, making Ginny think that her boyfriend Dean Thomas was trying to help her into the portrait hole. This incident, compounded by others, eventually resulted in them breaking up with each other.[8]\n\nHarry also initiated the breakup of Ron Weasley and Lavender Brown by donning his Cloak of Invisibility before leaving the boys' dormitory. When Ron descended the stairs after him with Hermione Granger, Lavender assumed the worst about the pair of them and dumped Ron.[4]\n\nHarry was able to sneak out and back into the castle undetected by unwanted forces; even when the potion's effect was about to dissipate, he was able to evade Peeves.[10]\n\nBefore leaving with Dumbledore to search for one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, Harry gave the rest of the Felix Felicis to Ron and Hermione with the instruction that they were to share it with Ginny, as he believed Draco Malfoy was ready to act on his mission from Voldemort. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny split the potion between themselves and effectively used it in the ensuing battle to dodge the curses sent their way by Death Eaters, many of which were Unforgivable Curses.[15][12]\n\nFelix is the Latin word meaning happy or lucky. 'Felicis' is from the same root, but declined in the genitive case. It is translated as 'of luck'. Therefore, Felix Felicis means 'Luck of Luck', 'Lucky Luck' or 'Luck's Luck'. Another translation might be 'Happy Luck'. In Latin, nouns and adjectives are usually cited by saying their nominative followed by their genitive, so a dictionary entry for the word \"felix\" could start as \"felix, felicis ...\"",
