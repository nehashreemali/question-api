  "content": "The Draught of Living Death was an extremely powerful Sleeping Draught, sending the drinker into a death-like slumber. Its effects are similar to suspended animation. This draught was an advanced potion, taught to sixth-year N.E.W.T. students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[1]\n\nA wizard prince once used the Wiggenweld Potion to awaken a princess who had been given the Draught of Living Death by the hag Leticia Somnolens. The prince first put some of the Wiggenweld Potion on his lips and then kissed the princess, causing her to awaken from her death-like slumber.[7]\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Severus Snape taught seventh-year Potions students how to brew this advanced potion.[2] Also during that school year, Olivia Green told Jacob's sibling that she remembered Duncan Ashe's accidental death was caused by an exceptionally potent brew of this potion that he made. Jacob's sibling thought this to be an incorrect memory, as they knew Duncan's death was instead caused by an Erumpent Potion.[8]\n\nLater in this school year, Barnaby Lee feared failing his Potions N.E.W.T. due to his inability to brew an effective Draught of Living Death. Snape harshly reprimanded his ineffective brew during a lesson where he tasked his seventh-years with making a flawless draught. Jacob's sibling helped him learn the recipe from Advanced Potion-Making in the Hogwarts Library and then had Penny Haywood helped him brew it in the Potions Classroom. Penny deemed the brew he made with them to be strong enough to put them all in a deathlike slumber. He was able to brew a passable draught in class, satisfying Snape.[9]\n\nOn 1 September 1991 at Hogwarts, Professor Snape interrogated Harry Potter in his first Potions class with him over the ingredients needed for this potion, to see if Harry was paying attention in his class. Harry Potter did not know the answer to Snape's questions, much to Snape’s amusement, as Snape disliked Harry.[4]\n\nAt Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry students were required to attempt this potion in their sixth-year N.E.W.T. class. In 1976 Severus Snape and his classmates attended this potion, as in 1996 Horace Slughorn commented on the excellent job he did. In 1996 Harry Potter's attempt at brewing this potion went rather well, as at the time he had the assistance of the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Harry succeeded in turning the potion to the idealistic shade of pale lilac that signals the half-way stage. None of his other classmates succeeded in this, which hints at the complexity and advanced nature of the potion.[1]\n\nAt some point, Gethsemane Prickle brewed a Draught of Living Death to help subdue a Mountain Troll that had escaped from Percival Shacklehorn's tent into London, England.[10]\n\nConstance Pickering kept her grandfather Matthias Pickering subdued using this potion in her flat, hidden in a large trunk.[11]\n\nThe potion was difficult to concoct, since Hermione Granger, a very talented potion-maker, who managed to concoct Polyjuice Potion (which was in no small way a difficult potion to make) in her second year, had trouble doing it in her sixth. Indeed, Horace Slughorn stated that only once before in his career was a student able to brew a mostly finished draught in only a single hour.[1]\n\nThe following recipe could be followed to brew this potion:",
