  "content": "The Swelling Solution was a potion which caused whatever it touched to swell in size.[1] Its three ingredients were bat spleens, dried nettles, and puffer-fish eyes.[2] Fermentation was needed before it could be considered a proper stable potion.[4]\n\nDuring the 1985–1986 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Severus Snape taught his second-year Potions students how to brew this potion.[3]\n\nThe trio decided to steal some ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Professor Snape's private stores in their second year the day the class tried to make this potion. Harry Potter set off one of his fireworks as a diversion for Hermione Granger to get the necessary ingredients; whether intentionally or accidentally, the firework landed in Gregory Goyle's cauldron, causing the solution to explode across the class, most notably affecting Draco Malfoy, who got it in the face and endured his nose swelling to the size of a melon, and Goyle himself, whose eyes expanded to the size of dinner plates; other afflictions included arms like clubs and gigantic puffed-up lips which rendered speech impossible. Those splashed had to go to Snape for a Deflating Draught.[1]\n\nIn the 2010–2011 school year, Professor Slughorn taught his third-year students how to brew the Swelling Solution.[5]",
