  "content": "The Mandrake Restorative Draught[2] was a powerful healing potion used to restore those who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.[1][2][3] Quite advanced, it required Mandrakes that had been matured past adolesence to brew.[2] It was the only known cure for the extremely malignant and dark affliction known as Petrification.\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year at Hogwarts, Professor Snape taught his seventh-year Potions students how to brew this potion in class.[3]\n\nThe Mandrake Restorative Draught was particularly useful at Hogwarts during the events surrounding the re-opening of the Chamber of Secrets in the 1992–1993 school year.[2] The Basilisk was released from the Chamber of Secrets and attacked numerous members of the Hogwarts community by petrifying them,[2] including Colin Creevey,[4] Justin Finch-Fletchley,[5] Hermione Granger,[6] Mrs Norris,[2] Penelope Clearwater[6] and Nearly-Headless Nick.[5]\n\nThese individuals suffered complete and total paralysis, almost mirroring death, and were restored to their normal state of being when Madam Pomfrey gave them this potion.[7] This particular potion was brewed by Severus Snape using Mandrake plants raised by Professor Sprout and the second year students at Hogwarts at that time. Gilderoy Lockhart had volunteered to make the potion, claiming that he must have done it a hundred times and could do it in his sleep. Snape, however, shot him down, icily commenting that was he was the school's Potions Master, not him.[2]",
