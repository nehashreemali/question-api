  "content": "The Elixir of Life was a potion procured from the Philosopher's Stone that made the drinker immortal, as long as they consumed the potion on a regular basis.[1]\n\nThe Elixir of Life would extend the lifespan of those who drank it, and so long as they keep drinking it regularly, they would remain immortal.[1][2]\n\nThe Elixir was also able to restore a disembodied but earthbound soul to full life, creating a body. Indeed, Lord Voldemort, surviving as a lingering spirit due to his Horcruxes, planned to steal the Philosopher's Stone to use the Elixir for that purpose, but was thwarted by Harry Potter in 1992.[2]\n\nOne of the three main goals of alchemy was to create panacea, a remedy that would cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely.[3] The creation of the Elixir of Life could be considered to be the success of this goal, as the potion extended life if drunk for eternity,[1] and could bring a disembodied soul back to a physical form.[2]\n\nIts ingredients were unknown, but a Hogwarts student wondered if phoenix tears may have been an ingredient in the Elixir of Life, whilst researching alchemy.[4]\n\nThe Elixir of Life was not infallible. If a person used the Elixir to age beyond their natural lifespan, they would become completely dependent on it, and ceasing its consumption will lead to death.[2][5] Furthermore, while the Elixir extended one's lifespan, it did not stop one's body from ageing, and if using it to reach an exceptionally advanced age, it would leave them with a decrepit appearance.[6] For example, Nicolas Flamel, who created the Philosopher's Stone, lived for a little over six-hundred and sixty years, along with his wife Perenelle, and took on a senile and ancient appearance, dying when he and his wife decided to have the Stone destroyed which subsequently depleted their supply of Elixir.[2]\n\nIn addition, the supply of Elixir could become contaminated, which may have either annuled the drinker's immortality or outright become poison.[5]\n\nAccording to Albus Dumbledore, Lord Voldemort refused to rely on the Elixir of Life for his immortality, as he would have been required to drink it for eternity, and the possibility of contamination or the stone's loss would result in his death. Additionally, his streak of independence made it intolerable for him to rely on the Elixir to survive, and only desired it to recreate his body.[5]\n\nAt some point during the 14th century, Nicolas Flamel became the only known creator of the Philosopher's Stone and subsequently the Elixir of Life, using it to extend his and his wife's lifespan.[1]\n\nThe Elixir of Life was a banned subject of study at Hogwarts, as the staff were fearful that a student's search for the Elixir might eventually consume them.[7] Despite this, details about the stone were available in the Alchemy section of the Hogwarts Library.[4]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year, Jacob's sibling's date became fearful of their mortality after researching love stories for their date with Jacob's sibling and attempted to find the Elixir of Life in order to \"control the ending of their story\". Whilst trying to track down their date, Jacob's sibling ran into Mundungus Fletcher, who claimed to be selling the Elixir of Life for 600 Galleons, but eventually confessed that it was a fake when Jacob's sibling caught them giving wrong information about the Elixir. He believed it came from a fruit, when it actually came from the Philosopher's Stone. After admitting that he was selling a fake, he confided in Jacob's sibling that he believed that the Elixir was a myth, with the reasoning that, if there was a way to achieve immortality, then everyone would be immortal.[7]\n\nBy the 1990–1991 school year, Dumbledore and Flamel came to believe that Gringotts' security wouldn't be enough and made arrangements to protect it at Hogwarts.[8] On 1 September, 1991, Rubeus Hagrid removed the stone from Vault 713 and brought it to Hogwarts, where it was stored in the Underground Chambers. After Voldemort nearly managed to steal the stone, Nicolas decided to destroy the stone, and thus the only method of producing the Elixir of Life, however he had enough in reserve to \"get his affairs in order\", according to Dumbledore.[2]",
