  "content": "The Wit-Sharpening Potion was a potion which allowed the drinker to think more clearly.[3] Due to this, it acted as an antidote to the Confundus Charm.[1]\n\nDuring the 1986–1987 school year, Merula Snyde stole Penny Haywood's Wit-Sharpening Potion and presented it as her own before Professors Dumbledore and Snape, both of whom deemed it an exceptional concoction and felt that Merula deserved special recognition.\n\nPenny, however, enlisted Jacob's sibling help to expose Merula's fraudulency and reclaim the ownership of her Wit-Sharpening Potion, which ultimately resulted in the successful revelation of Merula's transgression and Penny being duly awarded her special recognition.[7]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Severus Snape taught his fifth-year Potions students how to concoct this particular brew, in preparation for their Ordinary Wizarding Levels that year.[3]\n\nDuring the 1994–1995 school year, Severus Snape taught his fourth-year Potions students to make this potion shortly after the second task of the Triwizard Tournament in 1995. While working, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger discussed an article by Rita Skeeter that had recently been published in Witch Weekly. Snape found the trio reading the magazine, and, much to their humiliation, read it aloud to the entire class (the article falsely accused Hermione of toying with the hearts of both Viktor Krum and Harry).[6]\n\nSnape split the group up, telling them to concentrate on their potions, but Harry found it difficult to do so, as Snape continued to goad him personally. The class was further interrupted by the entrance of Igor Karkaroff. Harry purposely spilled his armadillo bile so that he could linger after the class was done and try to find out what Karkaroff wanted to tell Snape.[6]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the late 2010s and early 2020s, this potion was brewed heavily by members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, who used it help them combat enemies in Fortresses.[2]",
