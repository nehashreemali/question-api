  "content": "The Polyjuice Potion was a potion that allowed the drinker to temporarily assume the physical form of someone else. It was a highly complicated, challenging, and time-consuming potion. Polyjuice Potion was so complicated that even adult witches and wizards struggled to brew it correctly.[3]\n\nThe potion was so incredibly advanced that it had two separate parts, each part had contained steps. When its brewing was complete, the potion had to stew for a month before usage.[4][2]\n\nWhile it could account for both age and gender, Polyjuice Potion could not be used for a human to take an animal form, nor could it be used on non-humans or half-humans.[2]\n\nNotably, the Polyjuice Potion was used many times in the events leading up to, and during, the Second Wizarding War (and possibly the First Wizarding War, although there were no documented instances of it). The potion also played a crucial role for Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley in their second and fourth years.[4][2][6]\n\nPolyjuice was also used in Draco Malfoy's plot to smuggle Death Eaters into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1997,[7] in the Battle of the Seven Potters,[8] and in Harry, Ron and Hermione's Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic and their break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank in 1998.[9]\n\nPolyjuice Potion was among the products sold by the Apothecarium of Horace E. F. Slughorn.[10]\n\nIndependent of its actual brewing process, the Polyjuice Potion required a good deal of preparation prior to making it. For example, the lacewing flies must be stewed for twenty-one days prior to making the potion, and only fluxweed picked during a full moon is acceptable. The total process took approximately one month to complete.[11]\n\nA piece of the person who was to be imitated — usually a strand of their hair, but other things like toenail clippings, dandruff, or worse could be used — was needed for the transformation. The potion was technically incomplete without it. Apparently, the person one wished to change into must be alive when the piece was taken, as Barty Crouch Jnr kept Alastor Moody alive to continue harvesting his hair.[6]\n\nBefore this final ingredient was added, Polyjuice looked like thick, dark mud that bubbles slowly. When the piece of the person to be imitated was added, the potion changed colour; it seemed to react according to the nature of the person to be imitated, once even described as the 'essence' of the person.[2]\n\nGood-hearted people result in more attractive colours and tastes, while mean people caused the opposite effect. Harry Potter's was a pure golden colour,[8] whereas Gregory Goyle's tasted like \"overcooked cabbage\"[2] and \"looked like bogies\",[8] Bellatrix Lestrange's tasted \"disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots\"[9] and Mafalda Hopkirk's was a pleasant heliotrope colour.[12] It was likely that the taste differed from potion to potion.\n\nThe effects of a single dose lasted anywhere from ten minutes to twelve hours, depending on how well the potion had been brewed.[13] Drinking more prior to the transformation wearing off extended the form's duration until the next dosage was required.[6] The complexity of the potion was such that the one Hermione brewed in her second year only lasted one hour per dosage.[2] The effects could be removed prematurely by certain magical defences, such as the Thief's Downfall.[9] It also did not fool the Marauder's Map.\n\nIf a person died while under Polyjuice Potion, as Mrs Crouch did, then they would retain the form of whoever they had transformed into, rather than reverting back to their original shape (although it might be possible that the effects of the potion had not worn off at the time of her death and burial, as she was careful in taking it to the end, and Barty Snr could not retrieve his wife's body in fear of exposing the jailbreak, possibly meaning her body reverted after her burial).[6]\n\nPolyjuice could be used by a person to transform into someone of the other gender.[8] It appeared to adapt to account for the age of the person being turned into, as well as any injuries they have acquired, as Barty Crouch Jnr needed a magical eye and wooden leg when he used the potion to turn into Alastor Moody, as the real Moody had lost them.[6] In addition, congenital conditions of the person would apparently be replicated: Harry Potter did not need to use his spectacles to see clearly for the hour he was transformed into Gregory Goyle, while Hermione Granger and five others required them after turning into Harry shortly before the Battle of the Seven Potters.[8]\n\nThe potion was complicated and could go awry. For example, when Hermione brewed Polyjuice in her second year, she intended to take the form of Millicent Bulstrode, but she mistook her cat's hair for Millicent's. The resulting potion caused Hermione to partially transform into a cat, complete with ears and a tail. As the Polyjuice Potion could not be used to successfully transform into an animal, Hermione's change did not reverse after an hour.[2] She went to the Hospital Wing and did not recover until after the winter holidays.[14] A similar incident happened to Merula Snyde, who was transformed into a half-frog creature when Sir Ribbithe jumped into her batch of Polyjuice Potion. In her case, it caused lasting psychological damage that couldn't be reversed, as she gained a preference for eating insects and other parts of a frog's diet despite her appearance being back to normal.[15]\n\nLikewise, the potion was not designed to be used by a non-human or half-breed, as Remus Lupin informed the half-giant Rubeus Hagrid.[16] Presumably, it was likely that it could not be used to transform into a half-breed either.\n\nIn the 1890–1891 school year, an unidentified 19th-century Hogwarts student was tasked by Professor Eleazar Fig to disguise themselves as Phineas Nigellus Black, the incumbent Headmaster of the school. This was done with the aim of obtaining the password to the Headmaster's office to conduct the Trial of Niamh Fitzgerald.[17]\n\nThe student spoke to various people, including Aesop Sharp, who informed them about Black's Cure for Boils being ready; and Chiyo Kogawa, who petitioned the student for Quidditch to be reopened (for it had been cancelled that school year). The student eventually reached Scrope, who told them, after much deliberation, that the password was toujours pur, at which point the potion started to wear off and the student hurried for an escape.[17]\n\nAfter the potion wore off, the student snuck into the Headmaster's office, and spoke to the portrait of Niamh Fitzgerald, who directed them to her book within the study. After opening it, the student started her Trial.[17]\n\nIn September 1927, the Obscurial Credence Barebone was sighted in France while he was looking for his true identity. Albus Dumbledore met with magizoologist Newt Scamander in London and ordered him to head to Paris to find and save Barebone from the Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, as he did on December 1926 in New York. Due to events in the United States, Scamander headed to the British Ministry of Magic to appeal in revoking a foreign travel ban, which he received from the Ministry for the destruction of half of New York City, which is what Barebone's Obscurus really did.\n\nHe left England illegally using the Portkey, but the rumours about his departure reached the British Ministry. Newton, like everyone else, wanted to find out who Credence really was and to get this information he had to get to the Records Room in the French Ministry of Magic where the family box would tell him the truth. Being watched, he used Polyjuice Potion to assume the identity of his brother, Auror Theseus Scamander, to get inside unrecognised. While going through the ministry headquarters with Auror Tina Goldstein, they were spotted by Theseus. When the polyjuice potion stopped working and Tina stunned Theseus, they entered the Records Room, but the family box has been taken to the Lestrange Mausoleum on Pere Lachaise Cemetery.[18]\n\nDuring the 1986–1987 school year, three students, a Gryffindor, a Hufflepuff, and a Ravenclaw, attempted to brew a batch of Polyjuice Potion for their own use so they could go to Hogsmeade. They ended up failing in the creation of the potion, and subsequently attempted to pin the blame for it on Barnaby Lee and Slytherin House.\n\nThe conspiracy was unravelled by Jacob's sibling and Draco Malfoy, however not before the Gryffindor student drank a vial of Polyjuice Potion given to them by their cousin that contained one of Barnaby's hairs. The student attempted to confess as Barnaby, but the potion wore off before they were able to.[19]\n\nIn their second year, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger came to suspect that Draco Malfoy was the Heir of Slytherin. To investigate this, Hermione suggested the use of Polyjuice Potion to enable them to take on the form of Slytherin students and question Malfoy.[1]\n\nMasterminding the effort, Hermione obtained the advanced potion's recipe (by getting Professor Lockhart to sign a note authorising her to borrow the book Moste Potente Potions from the library's Restricted Section),[4] pilfered two of the rarer ingredients from Snape's cupboards,[20] and undertook the complex and lengthy brewing of the base Polyjuice Potion.\n\nShe also directed how the trio were to acquire the final ingredients — hair from their targets — as well as clothing to complete the disguise. Ultimately, however, though Harry and Ron successfully assumed the appearances of Goyle and Crabbe respectively, Hermione's own attempt to take on the guise of Millicent Bulstrode went awry when Hermione used a cat hair that she had mistaken for Millicent's hair from a hair brush.[2]\n\nWhen Barty Crouch Jnr was sent to Azkaban for life by his father, his mother requested that her husband allow her to switch places to save their son. Barty Crouch Snr agreed to the switch out of love for his wife. The switch was made with Mrs Crouch and Barty Jnr each taking a dose of Polyjuice Potion with each other's hair. Mrs Crouch was careful in drinking her remainder of the potion, until she died, so she could keep the prisoners fooled by maintaining her false appearance.[6]\n\nBetween September 1994 and June 1995, Barty Crouch Jnr used Polyjuice Potion to take on the appearance of Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, Hogwarts's new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, in order to enter Harry Potter into the Triwizard Tournament as part of Lord Voldemort's plot to return to power.[6] Throughout the year, Crouch stole the potion's ingredients from Severus Snape's cupboards,[6] leading Snape to suspect that Harry himself was behind the theft.[21]\n\nCrouch drank the potion periodically from Alastor Moody's hip flask, to prevent suspicions. In regards to the piece of the person he was impersonating, he also kept the real Moody within easy reach as a prisoner in his own trunk, as the potion could not impersonate deceased people. Later that year, when Crouch cornered Harry, he forgot to take the potion in excitement, and was eventually exposed.[6]\n\nAfter Horace Slughorn showed a cauldron of the Polyjuice Potion to his first N.E.W.T. Potions class,[22] Draco Malfoy stole some, and forced Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe to use it continuously throughout the 1996–1997 school year. They would stand watch outside the Room of Requirement disguised as young girls while Malfoy repaired a Vanishing Cabinet inside, as part of his assignment to assassinate Albus Dumbledore and let Death Eaters into Hogwarts.[7][23]\n\nThe Order of the Phoenix made use of Polyjuice Potion in 1997 in order to safely remove Harry Potter from 4 Privet Drive before his seventeenth birthday. Six people — Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Fleur Delacour, Fred and George Weasley, and Mundungus Fletcher — impersonated Harry in order to act as diversions when they were ambushed by Death Eaters despite Harry's initial protests.\n\nSoon after, Harry himself used it to disguise himself as \"Barny Weasley\" at Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding.[8] Luna Lovegood was the only one who saw through this disguise, recognising him by the expression on his face.[24]\n\nThe trio used Polyjuice that they stole from Moody to infiltrate the Ministry of Magic to search for Salazar Slytherin's Locket in September of 1997. Dolores Umbridge a high-raking Ministry official was in possession of the item. Harry, Ron, and Hermione disguised themselves as Albert Runcorn, Reginald Cattermole, and Mafalda Hopkirk, respectively.[12]\n\nThe plan, although full of mistakes and not as well thought out as previously believed, proved to be successful as the trio accomplished their mission. They retrieved the locket and escaped the Ministry with minimum injuries.[25]\n\nThe following year, Hermione used the remaining Polyjuice Potion again as part of the trio's plan to break in to Gringotts in order to retrieve Helga Hufflepuff's Cup from the Lestrange Vault. Using a strand of Bellatrix Lestrange's hair that had fallen on her sweater while Bellatrix interrogated her at Malfoy Manor, Hermione assumed her form. However, there wasn't enough, so Ron had to simply use cosmetic design to disguise himself. The effects of the potion were washed away by the Thief's Downfall at the bank.[9]\n\nAlbus Potter, Scorpius Malfoy, and Delphi used Polyjuice Potion to disguise themselves as Ron Weasley, Harry Potter, and Hermione Granger respectively and sneaked into the Ministry of Magic. Albus, as Ron, convinced Hermione to go elsewhere while they searched her office for a Time-Turner. Solving a series of puzzles from Hermione's bookcase, they finally discovered and stole the Time-Turner.[26]\n\nThe name \"Polyjuice\" probably comes from the Greek poly, meaning \"many\". This is supported by the fact that in the Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese translations, it is called, respectively, \"multijugos\" and \"polissuco\", both literally meaning \"multi juice\".",
