  "content": "Skele-Gro[1] (alternately spelled Skelegro)[7] was a dreadful-tasting potion which restored and caused growth to bones.[1] It was able to mend broken bones,[7] or even regrow entire bones that have vanished or been otherwise lost. For regrowing entire bones, the process was notably slow and painful and could take over a full day.[1]\n\nThe potion was extremely effective when it came to regrowing, growing, and mending bone, but smelled and tasted terrible and it often caused pain. When regrowing an entire bone, Harry Potter described the sensation as having large splinters lodged in his arm. The potion came in a large bottle and smoked as it was dispensed. Swallowing it burned the throat, and, according to Harry, it tasted awful and made him cough and splutter. For a magical treatment, Skele-Gro was surprisingly slow working when regrowing whole bones, taking most of the night to regrow the bones in Harry's arm. However, since he required thirty-three bones to be regrown outright, it is likely that its effects vary with the amount required to be healed or regrown.[1]\n\nLinfred of Stinchcombe, an ancestor of the Potter family, was known for having created many medicinal potions, one of which would be used as the basis for Skele-Gro.[5]\n\nThough she usually bought it, Madam Pomfrey had to brew Skele-Gro herself in the 1985–1986 school year, and was assisted by Jacob's sibling.[8]\n\nDue to a Skele-Gro shortage in the 1987–1988 school year, Madam Pomfrey tasked Professor Severus Snape with producing more for her supplies. Hence, the Potions Master conscripted his fourth-years to concoct this particular brew in Potions class and taught them how to do so, warning them that Madam Pomfrey would not accept subpar Skele-Gro from them.[4]\n\nLinfred's descendant Harry Potter needed a dose of Skele-Gro after the bones in his right arm were broken during a Quidditch match in the 1992–1993 school year. Despite Harry's wishes, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart foolishly attempted to mend the bones, accidentally causing them to disappear instead.[1] Later that school year, when Lockhart completely redecorated the Great Hall as a morale-booster for Valentine's Day, Professor Severus Snape, being one of the teachers, was disgusted by this action, and his disgusted reaction was stated to have looked as though he was fed a large beaker of Skele-Gro.[9]\n\nDraco Malfoy mentioned in the 1994–1995 school year that he had previously attributed Rubeus Hagrid's giant-like stature to a possible accidental overdose of Skele-Gro as a child. However, it is unknown if the potion could have such an extreme growth effect, even when overdosed, and it is known that Hagrid's size is as a result of being Half-Giant.[10]\n\nGriphook was administered Skele-Gro by Fleur Delacour after escaping from Malfoy Manor in 1998, at her home Shell Cottage.[11]\n\nIn the early 2010s, St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries ran out of Skele-Gro after a disaster at a Quidditch exhibition. They needed the public to help provide fully grown harvested Fanged Geraniums so they could produce more Skele-Gro.[12]\n\nOn 22 May 2014, during the final match of the first round of the 427th Quidditch World Cup between Wales and Germany, the quick administration of Skele-Gro saved German Seeker Thorsten Pfeffer's life after he failed an attempt at the life-threatening Wronski Feint. Pfeffer collided with the ground at what onlookers estimated to be sixty miles per hour, broke most of his bones and due to head injury, his memory was flawed and he was left believing himself to be a budgerigar called Klaus.[7]",
