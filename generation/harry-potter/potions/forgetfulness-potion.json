  "content": "The Forgetfulness Potion was a potion which caused an unknown degree of memory loss in the drinker.[1] The recipe for this potion could be found in Magical Drafts and Potions; its key ingredients included Lethe River Water, mistletoe berries, and Valerian sprigs.[1][3]\n\nDuring the 1890–1891 school year, a Hufflepuff student asked a fellow student whether they had any valerian sprigs, as they had wanted to brew the potion but had misplaced their sprigs.[4]\n\nDuring the 1986–1987 school year, Penny Haywood asked Jacob's sibling to brew the potion with her in secret, intending to drink it herself to erase a painful memory.[3]\n\nSince this potion was of beginner's level, Professor Severus Snape had his first-year students brew this potion for their final exam in 1992.[2]\n\nSecond-year students studied this potion in the 2009–2010 school year.[5]",
