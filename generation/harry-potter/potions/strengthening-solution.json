  "content": "Strengthening Solution was a potion that granted the drinker immense strength. It was brewed in at least two stages, requiring several days to mature in between, and two of the ingredients used to make it were salamander blood and powdered Griffin claw.[1]\n\nDuring the 1985–1986 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Severus Snape taught his second-years how to concoct this particular brew in Potions class.[3]\n\nProfessor Snape however had his fifth-year Potions students brew Strengthening Solution in 1995.[2] When Dolores Umbridge inspected Snape's class, she did not like the idea of students being taught such a potion, remarking that she thought the Ministry of Magic would prefer that it not be included in the syllabus.[1]\n\nHarry Potter watched this exchange between Umbridge and Snape, and was so distracted by it that he almost added pomegranate juice to his potion, but Hermione Granger stopped him in time. By the end of the lesson, however, Harry's potion was completely spoiled, being a foul, congealed mess that gave off an odour like burnt rubber. Professor Snape vanished the potion and gave Harry the remedial assignment of writing an essay on how to properly brew Strengthening Solution.[1]",
