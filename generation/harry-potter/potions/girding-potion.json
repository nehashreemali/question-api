  "content": "The Girding Potion was a potion that gave the consumer prolonged endurance. The maximum dosage was two vials.[1] It had a rather foul odour.[2]\n\nThis was a potion learned in the third year in Potions at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Professor Severus Snape had his third-year class brew this potion during the 1993–1994 school year.[1] It was also one of the many potions that Hogwarts students could brew in the Potions Club in the Hogwarts greenhouses during the 1996–1997 school year.[2]\n\nThe following recipe could be used to successfully make the Girding Potion:\n\nFrom the English \"to gird\" which can mean one of three things: to encircle or bind with a belt or band; to surround, enclose or hem in; to prepare oneself for action.[3] The last is probably the intended meaning, a reference to its effects.",
