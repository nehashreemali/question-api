  "content": "A Calming Draught was a potion that was used to calm a person down after they have suffered a shock, trauma, or emotional outburst.[1] Even if it worked fine in majority of the situations, sometimes it may have given a disastrous outcome, for instance, if animals like cats and dogs drank it.[3] Adding too much peppermint oil could give the drinker a burning sensation in their mouth and cause watery eyes or uncontrollable sobbing.[4][5]\n\nDuring the 1985–1986 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Jacob's sibling took Penny Haywood's help to brew a calming draught for Rubeus Hagrid's dog Fang, though Jacob's sibling's cat spilled it and drank the potion instead, which didn't work well on the cat.[3]\n\nDuring the 1987–1988 school year, Professor Severus Snape taught his fourth-years how to concoct this particular brew in Potions class.[2]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year, Penny Haywood helped Jacob's sibling brew some Calming Draught before the performance of Equinox Enchanted to prevent stage fright.[6]\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, several people were admitted to the hospital who had consumed Calming Draught made with too much peppermint oil, causing them to uncontrollably sob. Jacob's sibling and Healer Miriam Strout fixed the problem together at the hospital.[5]\n\nIn 1996, Madam Pomfrey administered a Calming Draught to Hannah Abbott in her fifth year after she burst out crying in a Herbology lesson, claiming to be too stupid to take her exams.[1]\n\nWhen Muggle monster hunter Laura Thorn's Obliviated memories of witnessing a Troll resurfaced after smelling Percival Shacklehorn's dirty socks, Ministry witch Mathilda Grimblehawk had St Mungo's Healer Omar Abasi bring her a Calming Draught, passing it off for a brew.[7] Despite being confined to the Leaky Cauldron during the investigation, Thorn later escaped to look for the Troll while Abasi was busy brewing another Calming Draught.[8]",
