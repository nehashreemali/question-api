  "content": "The Shrinking Solution,[1] also known as the Shrinking Potion,[4] was a potion that caused the drinker to shrink to a smaller form.[2] It was bright green when brewed correctly and, if prepared incorrectly, it could apparently be poisonous.[1]\n\nOne practical use of this potion was in the transportation of livestock — it allowed for a wizard to carry an entire herd of pigs in the pocket.[2]\n\nSometime throughout wizarding history, wizard Samuel Plunkett, who was persecuted by a Muggle village, poured Shrinking Solution down the village well and terrorised the shrunken villagers by chasing them around in hobnail boots.[5]\n\nIn the 1500s, accomplished potioneer Zygmunt Budge developed his own version of this potion, which, in his words was \"the best you will find\". According to Budge, part of the potency of his variation came from stirring the potion after adding the Shrivelfigs, an unorthodox step. It proved so powerful that, when he accidentally split a small amount on the grass outside his house, it caused an entire flock of sheep to shrink to lambs the size of woolly mice (Budge went on to use the shrunken lambs as ear-warmers in the chilly winters at Hermetray).[6] Budge also sent the potion to the two brothers of Tertius. Both of them shrank to the size of beetle, and, so the story goes, spent several days hiding under a cupboard while their cat tried to scoop them out and eat them.\n\nSimon Talmadge told the house-elf Cosa that he died because of having been eaten by a toad that thought he was a fly after he drank the Shrinking Solution incorrectly.[7]\n\nDuring the 1987–1988 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Severus Snape taught his fourth-year students how to concoct this particular brew in Potions class.[3]\n\nProfessor Severus Snape assigned his then-second-year students a \"particularly nasty\" essay on shrinking potions during the summer holidays,[4] and when they returned that fall, the first potion he had them brew was this one.[1]\n\nWhen Draco Malfoy, who had injured his arm being attacked by Buckbeak the Hippogriff, returned to class, Snape had Harry Potter and Ron Weasley brew his potion for him. In the same lesson, Neville Longbottom added too much leech juice and rat spleens to his potion, and Professor Snape threatened to poison Neville Longbottom's pet toad, Trevor, with the botched potion at the end of class. Luckily, however, Hermione Granger helped Neville fix it and when it came time for Snape to test the potion, Trevor turned into a tadpole.[1]\n\nWhen Harry brewed it in 1996 for Ginny Weasley at the Potions Club, he commented that Vincent Crabbe should take some of it; presumably to lose weight.[8]\n\nZygmunt Budge's recipe for this potion, as set down in his masterpiece, Book of Potions, was thus:\n\nSeverus Snape, however, in his personal copy of Advanced Potion-Making, preferred the following recipe:",
