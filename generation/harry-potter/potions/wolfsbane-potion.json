  "content": "The Wolfsbane Potion was an innovative and complex potion that relieved, but did not cure, the symptoms of lycanthropy.[9] The main ingredient was wolfsbane, also referred to as aconite or monkshood.[4]\n\nThe way one must imbibe it was very unique among potions, in that a goblet full of Wolfsbane Potion must have been taken each day for a week preceding the full moon; missing one dose alone, during such a night, was enough to invalidate all those that preceded it.\n\nThis potion was extremely difficult to make, as Slughorn believed that even Damocles Belby couldn't have invented it without immense effort on his part.[8] The ingredients were also very expensive, which made it difficult for some werewolves to brew it themselves, as they usually lived in poverty due to their difficulty in finding stable careers.[10]\n\nThe completed potion exuded a blue smoke.[3][4] According to Remus Lupin and Chiara Lobosca, it had a \"disgusting\" taste that was very difficult to get used to,[5][11] and adding sugar to remedy this was impossible as that substance would render it ineffective.[5]\n\nThe drinker had to take a goblet of the potion once a day for a week prior to the upcoming full moon, and missing even one dosage would render it ineffective.[12]\n\nThe potion did not cure lycanthropy, but rather eased the condition's psychological symptoms, allowing one to hold on to their mental faculties after transformation (which would otherwise not be possible) and thus retain their human consciousness whilst in animalistic physical form, rendering the otherwise dangerous beast into an ordinary, sleepy wolf.[10][1]\n\nThey usually stayed somewhere hidden and slept through the transformation. However, it could have disastrous side-effects if the recipe was tampered with, as Lupin told Harry in 1996.[2]\n\nWolfsbane Potion was invented by Damocles Belby at some point before the 1993–1994 school year.[13][8] It was developed in the second half of the twentieth century and was the most successful treatment for werewolves.[14] It was invented before or during the werewolf Chiara Lobosca's attendance at Hogwarts (1984 to 1991).[11]\n\nWhen this discovery was made, Remus Lupin thought it was a faint ray of hope, but his hopes were dashed when he found the potion formula's complexity (as potions were not his strongest suit) and the ingredient list being very expensive.[10]\n\nWhile unable to afford the potion nor its ingredient, Lupin thought to search for the latter in the Forbidden Forest, where he ran into Hogwarts student Chiara Lobosca, whom he was able to get the potion from on a few occasions. They would meet on the night before a full moon, with Lobosca then giving Lupin a bottle of the potion.[15] During the 1985–1986 school year, Jacob's sibling and Ben Copper witnessed a potion transaction between the two;[16] upon inquiry, Lobosca admitted that, unknown to Lupin, she was giving Lupin potions made for her since the ingredients were only enough to make the dosage for one person. Lupin refused any more Wolfsbane Potion from Lobosca in advance after hearing the revelation.[15]\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Severus Snape taught his seventh-year Potions students how to brew the Wolfsbane Potion for the Werewolf Capture Unit for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, as a fugitive werewolf was on the loose.[6] Again during this year, Jacob's sibling helped Healers at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries brew Wolfsbane Potion after a witch was admitted to the hospital with a werewolf bite, as part of their work experience at the hospital.[4]\n\nLupin returned to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1993 as a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher solely because Albus Dumbledore offered a limitless supply of the Wolfsbane Potion,[10] which was brewed by Potions Master Severus Snape.[5][2] Harry believed Snape was poisoning Lupin and later told his friends about it after they came back from Honeydukes, on 31 October (Hallowe'en) 1993; Hermione dismissed the thought, reasoning that Snape wouldn't do something so audacious and certainly not with a student, like Harry, close by for all eyes would turn accusingly at the Potions Master if anything ill were to happen to Lupin by the provided potion's influence.[5]\n\nDuring the confrontation with Sirius Black in the Shrieking Shack, Lupin forgot to take a goblet during the night of the full moon, which led to him to transforming into a full-fledged werewolf.[12]\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Second Wizarding War, the British Ministry of Magic made new efforts to help werewolves, including an outreaching programme to have them to become more inclusive. Harry, who helped create this programme, originally proposed free Wolfsbane Potion to any werewolf who desired it. However, due to issues with regulations and protocols, the free potion section was apparently excluded.[17]\n\nWhen she was growing up, Abigail Grey and her father Gerard, who were both werewolves, couldn't afford to brew the Wolfsbane Potion for themselves. They also didn't have the skills needed to brew something that difficult. Her father's inability to brew it was what led to him biting and infecting her with lycanthropy because he could not keep his human mind during a transformation. When she was attending Hogwarts, Professor Slughorn helped her brew the potion and taught her the recipe. However, when ingredients were hard to find, Abigail had to find them in the wild. Her friend once brewed the potion for her while she told them what to do. Around the same time, there were several break-ins in Hogsmeade. Abigail realised the only things being stolen were ingredients for the Wolfsbane Potion.[7]",
