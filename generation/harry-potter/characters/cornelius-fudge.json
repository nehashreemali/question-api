  "content": "Minister Cornelius Oswald Fudge, O.M. (First Class), was a British wizard who served as the thirty-second Minister for Magic of the British Ministry of Magic, in office from 1990 to 1996.[11] Although reliant on the advice of Albus Dumbledore at first, by the height of his power, he had complete control of the Ministry of Magic,[12] as well as extensive influence over the publishing of the Daily Prophet.[13]\n\nFudge began his career in the Ministry as Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.[14] He was chosen to succeed Millicent Bagnold as Minister for Magic,[11] after Albus Dumbledore declined the position and Bartemius Crouch Senior was refused it on the account of his poor popularity.[15] He thus had the responsibility of meeting with the Muggle Prime Minister when necessary, which became increasingly frequent with the advent of the Second Wizarding War.[10]\n\nFudge's tenure saw a marked increase in pure-blood supremacy both within the Ministry of Magic and throughout the larger British wizarding community, all directing towards the eventual Return of Lord Voldemort in 1995.[16] When Ginevra Weasley was possessed by Tom Riddle's Diary to commit attacks on Muggle-born students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Fudge was involved in suspending Dumbledore and incarcerating Rubeus Hagrid, the suspected attacker.[17] Later, he was forced to deal with the escape of the assumed Death Eater and mass-murderer Sirius Black, who was also innocent.[18] Although Fudge and the Ministry came close to apprehending Black, Black ultimately escaped from Fudge's fingers.[19]\n\nDeath Eater activity heightened after the 422nd Quidditch World Cup, hosted in Great Britain, where the celebrations were followed by a Death Eater terrorist attack and where the Dark Mark illuminated the skies for the first time in thirteen years.[20] This activity only heightened during the subsequent Triwizard Tournament, but Fudge refused to believe Harry Potter's claim that Cedric Diggory's had been murdered at the hands of Lord Voldemort.[21] Fudge leveraged the Daily Prophet to silence Potter,[13] fired Ministry staff who supported Dumbledore,[12] and grew increasingly paranoid that Dumbledore was attempting to overthrow him.[13][8]\n\nHowever, following the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Fudge saw Voldemort with his own eyes and was forced to admit that Harry and Dumbledore had been telling the truth the whole time, causing the wizarding community to protest and scream for his resignation. He made several desperate attempts to retain his position but was eventually sacked from it in complete disgrace. He was replaced as Minister for Magic by Rufus Scrimgeour but stayed in an advisory capacity and communicated news of the Second Wizarding War to the Muggle Prime Minister if Scrimgeour was unable to.[10]\n\nCornelius Oswald Fudge was born before 1964[1] in presumably Great Britain to either a half-blood or pure-blood family.[2] During his childhood and teenage years, Fudge attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[22] It is unknown what house he was sorted into.\n\nBy 1981, Fudge was the junior minister in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. After the attack at Godric's Hollow, he was one of the first on the scene after Sirius Black seemed to kill Peter Pettigrew, but, unknown by anybody else, Black had been framed by Pettigrew himself. Fudge watched Sirius laughing maniacally, and twelve years later, he still remembered the giant crater in the street.[14]\n\nAlbus Dumbledore was the top candidate to succeed Millicent Bagnold as the next Minister for Magic, as many people requested him to accept the position, but he refused multiple times. Therefore, Bartemius Crouch Senior was favoured to be the next Minister for his effective methods of fighting the Death Eaters, but it was Fudge who finally replaced Bagnold when Crouch lost popularity following his son's trial. However, Fudge never forgot how much popularity and support Dumbledore received during the election. He also never forgot how much Crouch was admired in the Ministry, leaving him so jealous and with a strong dislike of Crouch that his very first act as Minister of Magic was to have Crouch reassigned to the Department of International Magical Cooperation.\n\nIn late 1990, Fudge was appointed Minister for Magic. In his first days as the Minister, he asked for an urgent report on magical transportation, which was completed by Alastor Moody based on Jacob's sibling's research.[23] He then talked to Jacob's sibling in person and informed them of the upcoming trial of the white-robed wizard. Shortly afterwards,[24] he had his first meeting with the Muggle Prime Minister to introduce himself and to explain the existence of the wizarding world. Fudge cheerily hoped that the pair would never need to meet again due to the Prime Minister trying to throw Fudge out of his office window, as he believed their meeting was an attempt at the hands of the opposition to sabotage his career and position in the Muggle world.[10]\n\nIt was said that he was not very self-confident in his early days and constantly sent letters to Albus Dumbledore, asking for advice.[25]\n\nAccording to the magazine The Quibbler, Fudge desired to conquer Gringotts Wizarding Bank, and in order to do so, he allegedly had goblins killed in ludicrous ways such as drowning them, dropping them off buildings, poisoning them, and cooking them in pies, earning him the epithet \"Goblin-Crusher\".[26] However, as The Quibbler was a tabloid magazine, this theory was extremely debatable and almost certainly false. Similarly, according to Luna Lovegood, daughter of the editor of The Quibbler, Cornelius had a private army of Heliopaths, spirits of fire whose existence was doubted by almost everyone else.[27]\n\nAt some point early on during his Ministerial career and before 1995,[28] Fudge arrogantly and controversially awarded himself the Order of Merlin, First Class award.[29] This caused a good deal of muttering among the wizarding community since the common view was that his career was \"less than distinguished\", thus subverting the worth of this award (which was given out \"for acts of outstanding bravery or distinction\").[29]\n\nAfter four attacks on Muggle-born witches and wizards, Fudge arrived at Hogwarts in the spring of 1993 to bring Rubeus Hagrid to Azkaban prison, mainly because Hagrid's record was against him. Dumbledore tried to convince Fudge that taking Hagrid would make no difference, but Fudge was quick to cite that out of dutiful obligation he had no other choice. However, Fudge had his doubts and reassured Hagrid that if another person was found to be responsible, he would be released immediately. At the same time, Lucius Malfoy, a then school governor, had Dumbledore suspended, which Fudge tried to protest against but in futility.[17] Eventually, when it was proven that Hagrid was indeed innocent, Fudge was as good as his word and immediately released him.[30]\n\nThat summer, Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban. A few weeks prior to Black's escape, Fudge had visited him while on a tour of Azkaban prison and was unnerved at how normal Black seemed relative to the other prisoners.[14]\n\nConvinced Black would be caught quickly, Fudge alerted the Muggle Prime Minister of the situation[10] and asked that the Muggles keep an eye out for Black, as well; the Ministry set up a special hot line for the Muggles to call with any information.[31] Because of Black's connection to Harry Potter, Fudge was reluctant to inform Harry of the truth, something to which Arthur Weasley voiced his opposing opinion.[32]\n\nWhen Harry left the Dursleys' after blowing up Dudley's Aunt Marge, Fudge intercepted him outside the Leaky Cauldron after disembarking from the Knight Bus during his misguided attempt to go on the run. Fudge assured Harry that the problem had been dealt with; Marge had been punctured by members of the Accidental Magical Reversal Squad and her memory modified by Obliviators. When Harry asked what would happen to him, Fudge told him not to worry and that he would not receive punishment since the circumstances had changed.\n\nThe truth was, Fudge had let Harry off because he had been relieved to find him alive and told him that running away at night while a killer was on the loose was very irresponsible. Fudge then asked that for his protection, Harry stay at the Leaky Cauldron for what remained of the summer and not to venture back into Muggle London. Harry agreed and then asked Fudge if he would consider signing his Hogsmeade permission slip, to which Fudge uncomfortably declined, as he was not a parent or a guardian. Fudge then bid Harry goodbye, and he left the room.[18]\n\nAs a misguided attempt to protect the students, Fudge posted Dementors around the school,[33] which nearly produced tragic results. The teachers, as well as Madam Rosmerta in Hogsmeade, found the creatures' presence distracting and highly unpleasant, and due to his tragic past, Harry was a frequent target of the Dementors' actions.[14]\n\nIn October, Fudge was alerted to Black's entry into Hogwarts on Hallowe'en night. Convinced Black was hiding either in or around Hogsmeade, Fudge had the Dementors search the area, calling it a necessary precaution. In December, he journeyed to the school, and stopped at the Three Broomsticks with Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Hagrid. Inviting Rosmerta to join them, Fudge proceeded to explain Black's connection to Harry Potter and that all evidence pointed out that Black told Voldemort where the Potters were hidden almost a week after he was appointed their Secret-Keeper. Fudge then admitted that he believed Black's eventual plan was to find Voldemort and return him to power. After this, Fudge left the pub for a meeting with Dumbledore. Unbeknownst to him, Harry Potter overheard this conversation and was greatly affected by it, hoping for the opportunity to kill Black.[14]\n\nIn June, Fudge arrived at Hogwarts again, this time for two reasons: first, to check on the Black situation, and second, to witness the execution of Buckbeak the Hippogriff. At two o'clock, Fudge attended Buckbeak's appeal, but the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures did not reverse its decision. At five that evening, Fudge returned to Hagrid's cabin to witness the execution, but when Macnair stepped outside to perform the act, he noticed that Buckbeak had disappeared.\n\nWhen Severus Snape returned Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Black to the school after the events in the Shrieking Shack, Fudge informed him that for his actions, Fudge would try to wangle an Order of Merlin, Second or First Class for him. Moments later, Fudge entered the hospital wing after hearing Harry's shouts; Harry and Hermione attempted to convince Fudge that Peter Pettigrew was still alive, to no avail. Several minutes later, when Professor Dumbledore arrived to speak privately with Harry and Hermione, Fudge decided to meet the Dementors and rendezvous with Dumbledore later. While talking to Snape soon after, he said he suspected that once Harry was back in his right mind, he would want to tell the Prophet exactly how Snape saved him.\n\nWhen they learned Black had escaped again, Fudge returned with Snape and Dumbledore to the hospital wing, where Snape furiously ordered Harry to explain his involvement. However, Fudge seemed to think Harry being involved was impossible and left to inform the Ministry about the situation but not before agreeing to remove the Dementors from the grounds due to their attempt to use the Dementor's Kiss on Harry the previous night.\n\nDuring the summer holiday, Fudge had two tasks to organise with help from Ludo Bagman and Bartemius Crouch: the final of the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament.[34]\n\nFudge met again with the Muggle Prime Minister to inform him of the magical creatures he was bringing into the country for the Tournament.[10]\n\nAt the World Cup, Fudge greeted Harry in a fatherly fashion and introduced him to several foreign wizards, including the Bulgarian Minister for Magic. Fudge also extended friendly greetings to the Malfoy family.[34]\n\nAfter the match ended, Fudge was irritated to learn that the Bulgarian Minister could speak English and that his own need to communicate through sign language had not been necessary. Along with the Bulgarian Minister, Fudge then shook hands with the two teams.[34]\n\nIn the spring of 1995, Fudge was summoned to Hogwarts after Barty Crouch was seen going mad and then disappeared. Fudge decided to cover up this embarrassing situation, and also refused to believe anything Crouch said, believing it to be the words of a lunatic. Fudge even suggested that Olympe Maxime had murdered him due to her being a half-giant since the incident occurred near the Beauxbatons Carriage that night. When Dumbledore expressed his belief that Fudge's accusation was due to his personal prejudice towards so-called 'half-breeds,' Fudge, in turn, believed that Dumbledore's friendship with Rubeus Hagrid, another half-giant, was clouding his judgement. Harry also pointed out that Madame Maxime would have had a difficult time hiding due to her abnormal size, which left Fudge feeling embarrassed.[35] Fudge was later asked to fill in for Mr Crouch as a judge of the 1994 Triwizard Tournament since his assistant, Percy Weasley, was hauled in for questioning regarding the incident and was unable to attend.\n\nWhen Harry exited the Triwizard maze holding Cedric Diggory's dead body, Fudge informed the crowd and then tried to get Harry to release him. After an injured Harry released Cedric's corpse, Fudge suggested that he go to the hospital wing. Dumbledore refused the suggestion, wanting Harry to remain where he was. When Fudge was informed the Death Eater responsible had been caught, and feeling his personal safety was in jeopardy, he summoned a Dementor to accompany him into the castle, disregarding both Dumbledore's obvious dislike for the creatures and the fact that the culprit was already restrained; said Dementor then sucked out Barty Crouch Jnr's soul, leaving him an empty shell of his former self and unable to give testimony about Voldemort's return. This lack of testimony helped Fudge discredit both Harry and Dumbledore the following year.[36]\n\nParanoid that Dumbledore may have had designs on the role of Minister himself, Fudge refused to believe the warning that Voldemort had returned. Fudge's decision was also partially influenced by one of Rita Skeeter's articles about Harry. In the article Skeeter wrote that Harry's scar had long-term negative effects on his mental health. This led Fudge to suggest that Harry may have been hallucinating. This made Harry an unreliable witness in Fudge's mind; when Harry started naming the identities of the Death Eaters who returned to Voldemort's side, he could only identify those who had been cleared by the Wizengamot, which Fudge claimed Harry could have looked up in old copies of the Daily Prophet, and took it as a great offence.\n\nDumbledore, however, insisted that the situation was still salvageable if they took the necessary precautions; they needed to remove Azkaban from the control of the Dementors and send peace envoys to the giants. Fudge was horrified at the mere prospect of both of these, stating it would mean the end of his career if he did either one. Dumbledore, in turn, countered that Fudge was blinded by the love of his office and his own prejudices. He provided a warning that the decision Fudge made here and now would affect how he was remembered in the future: if Fudge took the necessary measures, he would be hailed as a hero throughout the ages, whether he remained in office or not. If he did nothing, then he would be immortalised as a coward who allowed Voldemort the opportunity to try and destroy the world they tried so hard to rebuild.\n\nHowever, Fudge saw Dumbledore's suggestions as ludicrous (fearing he would be forced out of office for even suggesting it). As such, he and Dumbledore acknowledged that they had reached a parting of the ways; Fudge was left to act as he saw fit, while Dumbledore acted immediately to reactivate the Order of the Phoenix. Even a screaming argument with Minerva McGonagall and seeing Severus Snape's reactivated Dark Mark branding did not convince Fudge in the very least; if anything, he was increasingly angry at Minerva and revolted at Severus. Before leaving the school, Fudge was courteous enough to hand Harry his winnings for the Tournament, though he cancelled the award ceremony due to the circumstances.[37]\n\nOver the summer, Fudge used his influence at the Daily Prophet to create a campaign designed to slander and discredit both Albus Dumbledore, who Fudge thought was after his job, and Harry Potter.\n\nHe made it clear that anyone in league with Dumbledore could consider themselves dismissed from the Ministry, leading to many members of the Order of the Phoenix to become more discreet with their meetings. He also changed many laws in an attempt to stop Dumbledore and Potter from gathering supporters and reaching sympathetic ears, turning a simple case of under-age magic into a trial by the entire Wizengamot; in his great haste to withhold certain laws, he ended up neglecting a few, as well. He also invited Percy Weasley to become his Junior Minister in an attempt to spy on the Dumbledore-loyal Weasley family. Even though Percy accepted, he defected from his family due to a quarrel, though Fudge was allegedly gracious of this (at least, according to Percy).\n\nWhen Harry was accused of using magic illegally in the presence of a Muggle, Fudge took a leading role in Harry's prosecution before the Wizengamot. He actively sought to discredit Harry, going so far as to change the time and location of the hearing in an attempt to make him miss it. During the actual hearing, he introduced irrelevant considerations and highly biased accusations based around Harry's past offences which included offences he himself had excused, while at the same time seeking to deny Harry's right to a fair trial and present his side of the events. Only the intervention of witness Arabella Figg and Dumbledore himself spared Harry from expulsion, though Fudge attempted to deny their testimonies and unfairly voted for Harry's conviction himself. After the hearing, Fudge outright ignored Harry and Arthur Weasley as he walked past them.\n\nDriven by paranoia, Fudge sought to undermine Dumbledore's credibility and authority both at Hogwarts and at large in the wizarding world, which he accomplished, first by ensuring that Dumbledore was presented in the news as a crackpot. Soon afterwards, Fudge's Senior Undersecretary, Dolores Umbridge, was installed at Hogwarts as the school's new Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor. Fudge had Umbridge teach Hogwarts students to read their textbooks instead of practising defensive spells, out of a paranoid belief that Dumbledore intended to train his students into an army to overtake the Ministry. By means of numerous Ministry decrees, Fudge gradually extended her powers while suppressing Dumbledore's and Harry's freedom of expressing their claims.\n\nFudge eventually handed full control of Hogwarts to Umbridge when, one evening, Harry was caught violating Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four. Umbridge had found Dumbledore's Army's meeting place and had quickly aprehended Harry. She found its location because of the information that was provided to her by Marietta Edgecombe. Dumbledore took the blame for the organisation and escaped after swiftly defeating Fudge, Umbridge, Kingsley Shacklebolt and John Dawlish, thus being dismissed as headmaster and became a wanted criminal.[36]\n\nAfter the mass breakout of Azkaban in 1996, Fudge continued to disbelieve Voldemort's return, instead suggesting that Sirius Black was the leader of the breakout, due to the fact that he and Bellatrix Lestrange were cousins, either unaware or neglecting that Sirius had been disowned by his family and the two were mortal enemies. Throughout all of this, Fudge unknowingly became an ally to Voldemort, giving him an entire year to rebuild his forces uninterrupted. Because Fudge ignored Dumbledore's previous warnings, Voldemort was also able to convince the Dementors, Giants and other factions mistreated by the Ministry to join him. The Dementors' defection also allowed Voldemort to free the majority of his loyal followers, including Bellatrix. Lucius, amongst other falsely-reformed Death Eaters, remained in Fudge's trust while discreetly manipulating him to assist their master and their own benefits. While the Order and Harry considered the possibility of Fudge being under the Imperius Curse, Dumbledore believed otherwise, which was of no comfort. Within a year of his return, Voldemort had a sizeable, still-growing army at his disposal and was ready to begin his conquest.\n\nFudge's term ended in 1996 when, shortly after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, he and several other Ministry officials saw Voldemort for themselves in the Ministry Atrium.[38] Forced to accept the truth, Fudge was pressured by the public and media and was ultimately sacked within a fortnight of the incident, on 2 July, 1996, for failing to see the danger at hand and act on it. The whole of Great Britain were not prepared for the open warfare that followed. Because of Fudge's ineffective leadership, Voldemort and the Death Eaters had an entire year of uninterrupted planning.[10]\n\nPrior to Fudge's dismissal, he made desperate attempts to remain in office and tried to have Dumbledore arrange a meeting with Harry to persuade him to tell the wizarding world that the Ministry was doing a good job in maintaining order and security (in short, Fudge wanted Harry to lie to the wizarding world, which is ironically what Fudge accused Harry of prior). This failed, as Dumbledore refused to make the arrangement, knowing that Harry would think the idea outrageous, but the idea did not die out when Rufus Scrimgeour took over. Indeed, when Harry was notified by Dumbledore that this idea was originally Fudge's, Harry expressed his disgust at the disgraced former Minister's shamelessness. Also, prior to his dismissal, Fudge was threatened by Voldemort to stand aside as Minister or a mass murder of Muggles would take place. Fudge refused, which resulted in the collapse of the Brockdale Bridge.[10]\n\nFudge stayed on as an adviser and messenger to the Muggle Prime Minister for Scrimgeour, as Scrimgeour was too busy to contact the Muggle Minister himself.[10] It remains unknown if he complied with the new regime, was forced to go on the run, or was incarcerated alongside the Death Eaters' political enemies after Voldemort took over the government, but he did survive to at least 2022 and apparently did not fall towards the dark side enough to warrant an arrest.[39]\n\nWhen the full consequences of Fudge's actions (or rather, lack thereof) after Lord Voldemort's return became known, the wizard community issued a virtually unanimous condemnation of his tenure. Fudge would later comment sadly that he had never known the wizard community to be so united on any other issue during his administration.[10] Given this universal disapproval, he was likely memorialised, like Dumbledore warned, as one of the least effective Ministers in British history.\n\nIn 1997, Fudge was one of the many wizards attending the funeral of Albus Dumbledore.[40] It is unknown what happened to him after Lord Voldemort took over the Ministry of Magic or his later life after Voldemort's final defeat. Whatever was the case, his most prized possession: his reputation and image, had been completely destroyed, as endangering the entire world, both Magic and Muggle, made him as Dumbledore had warned him; the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy what the wizarding community tried so hard to rebuild.\n\nDespite Fudge's actions costing him his position and reputation, as well as endangering the community as a whole, the Ministry at the time did not learn any moral lessons from it, as his idea of persuading Harry to lie for the Ministry was taken up by his successor, Rufus Scrimgeour, who also made similar mistakes of worrying about the bureaucracy's reputation over actual security. Fudge's corruption initiated a downward spiral that allowed Voldemort and his forces to eventually overthrow the Ministry, and Scrimgeour was killed because he walked the same political path as Fudge did. Only when the Ministry was retaken after Voldemort's death was Kingsley Shacklebolt able to undo all the damage that Fudge and his administration had started.\n\nIn 2022, he did an exclusive interview with the Daily Prophet.[39]\n\nFudge was described as a \"portly little man\", with rumpled grey hair. He was recognisable by his lime green bowler hat, which he usually wore or held and often wore a pinstriped cloak, but not exclusively. When Harry Potter first saw him, Fudge was wearing a pinstriped suit, scarlet tie, long black travelling cloak, pointed purple boots, and lime green bowler hat.[18] On another occasion, he wore a bottle-green suit. For the execution of Buckbeak, he had a gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat.\n\nThe nationwide revelation that Voldemort has returned led Fudge to be stressed out, reflected in his careworn appearance when he met with the Muggle Prime Minister. Fudge was noticeably thinner, grayer, and balder, and with a crumpled look on his face, something the Prime Minister noted to be telltale signs of trouble for a politician.[10]\n\nDuring his tenure as Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge appeared in the early years as a bumptious, good-natured wizard trying to manage and smooth over the occasional crisis, such as Harry Potter's accidental misuse of magic to inflate his Aunt Marge in 1993.[18] Several people, including Rubeus Hagrid, considered Fudge a well-meaning, but ineffective, bumbler while he was in office.[25]\n\nAlbus Dumbledore perceived Fudge as prejudiced towards those with purity of blood,[37] a trait which he shared with other Ministry officials such as Dolores Umbridge[41] and Lucius Malfoy, both of whom Fudge favoured and patronised.[42] While Fudge favoured those with high status and blood purity, he overlooked and disapproved of people such as Arthur Weasley, on the account that he \"lacked wizarding pride\" and had a \"fondness for Muggles\".[43] He was also disinterested in Squibs such as Arabella Figg.[44] In two cases, he irrationally accused half-giants of murder; first Rubeus Hagrid of opening the Chamber of Secrets,[17] and later Olympe Maxime of killing Barty Crouch on account of her species.[45] When Dumbledore offered to summon the house-elf Dobby to the hearing of Harry Potter for testimony, Fudge stated that he had no time to listen to house-elves.[44] He overlooked Lucius Malfoy's past association with the Death Eaters after Malfoy had been cleared, having claimed to be under the Imperius Curse, as well as his vaunted position in wizarding society and financial contributions to the Ministry.\n\nFudge could be quite tactless, using exaggerated gestured to communicate with Oblansk, the Bulgarian Minister for Magic,[34] and revolted aloud upon seeing Marietta Edgecombe's disfigured face.[8] Later in his career, Fudge awarded himself the Order of Merlin, First Class, a decision that sparked controversy within the wizarding community, where critics argued his tenure had not warranted such recognition.[29]\n\nFudge ultimately tried to maintain a semblance of peace, though this was achieved through controversial and illiberal methods, leveraging the Daily Prophet for a smear campaign on his rivals and publicly disgracing them to protect his own reputation. Preferring to tell the public what they wanted to hear instead of what they needed to hear, and deluding even himself in the process, Fudge would use virtually any means to cover up the truth.[13] At times, he was happy to bend the laws in his favour, including temporarily pardoning Willy Widdershins for his crimes because he made a deal with the Ministry for his release to provide testimony against Harry Potter for forming Dumbledore's Army, showing that he was even willing to make deals with criminals if it meant discrediting those who opposed him.[8] By installing Dolores Umbridge as his puppet Headmistress at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he created several new rules and regulations at Hogwarts to increase control over the school, many of them unfair.[46] Ultimately, his refusal to accept the truth of Lord Voldemort's return put the British wizarding community at further risk.\n\nFudge also appeared to be more reactive than proactive. He could also be quite indecisive, and would often ask Dumbledore for advice in his early days as Minister.[25] When Fudge did take the initiative to make decisions, they were often misguided. When he placed Dementors at Hogwarts to recapture Sirius Black, this led to students being traumatised and a number of near-death experiences involving Harry Potter.[47][48] He later insisted on summoning a Dementor to Bartemius Crouch Junior's interrogation for his own protection, despite knowing that Barty had been restrained and guarded by Professor McGonagall, and the possibility that the Dementor would attack the prisoner on sight, which did happen, resulting in the destruction of their most critical piece of evidence at that time.[37]\n\nAlthough his behaviour between 1995 and 1996 made him appear irrational, Fudge was not a totally unreasonable man and was more reasonable than Dolores Umbridge or Voldemort by nature, as he simply buried himself in his own self-denial, love of office, delusions and paranoia. He was capable of admitting when he was wrong, but only with damnable and solid evidence which he could see with his own eyes. After witnessing Voldemort's return with his own eyes, Fudge could no longer bury himself in lies and cleared Dumbledore's and Harry's names alongside the names of notable members of the Order of the Phoenix unjustly persecuted by the Ministry (most notably Rubeus Hagrid, Arthur Weasley, and Sirius Black), at the price of him being removed from his position. For instance, he was able to admit to the Muggle Prime Minister, with somewhat humility, that starting a ruthless manhunt for Sirius Black may have been aimless since he was in fact innocent all along, which Fudge realised when he learned that Black was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries (despite incorrectly believing earlier that the two were working together).[10]\n\nAlthough being willing to admit his mistake to the public, Fudge was desperate in maintaining the position of Minister. He refused to resign despite pressure from the community and a legitimate threat from Voldemort, and made a ridiculous attempt to revitalise his popularity, by bombarding Dumbledore with letters trying to get him to persuade Harry to lie to the public on Fudge's behalf (which Fudge hypocritically accused Harry of doing a year prior), a failed attempt that was picked up by his successor with equal unsuccess. Because Fudge refused to step down willingly, the wizarding community dismissed him unanimously; Fudge was greatly saddened to see the entire world being so united against him. After his failed attempt to recruit Harry to be his poster boy, Cornelius bitterly wished his successor, Rufus Scrimgeour, to have better success in the endeavour.[10]\n\nDespite rarely being shown to use magic, Fudge was shown to use some rather advanced, or at least difficult, spells. However, he seems to be limited with certain areas of magic, as he could not remove Hermione's \"SNEAK\" jinx off of Marietta Edgecombe's face.[49] He also had very little political skills, as he would bombard Dumbledore for advice in his early years,[25] while making very poor choices in the last few years of his tenure.\n\nIn Fudge's early days as Minister for Magic, he was forever bombarding Albus Dumbledore for help and advice. In return, he expressed confidence in Dumbledore. When Lucius Malfoy had an Order of Suspension for Dumbledore due to his failure to prevent petrification-attacks on students, Fudge was against the suspension, saying it was the \"last thing we want just now\", and \"if Dumbledore can't stop them... who can?\".\n\nBesides advice, it seems that Albus Dumbledore informed Fudge of important events at Hogwarts, such as Sirius Black's and Buckbeak's escape from there being due to \"a reversal of time.\" Apparently, he did not inform Fudge that Harry Potter was a Parselmouth, and learned of it after Rita Skeeter's article in the Daily Prophet.\n\nOver the years, though, Fudge became paranoid that Dumbledore was seeking the Minister position for himself, despite Dumbledore clearly showing lack of interest in the position, rejecting it at least three times. This paranoia was kept suppressed, as Fudge continued to respect Dumbledore over the years and accepted his decisions, despite their eccentricity. Despite constantly seeking advice from the more able wizard, Fudge would nevertheless succumb to the public's views and sometimes go against Dumbledore's insistence on certain issues, such as sending Hagrid to Azkaban or placing Dementors around Hogwarts as guardians. Fudge was only successful in gaining the people's confidence because they knew he was willing to accept Dumbledore's advice.\n\nHowever, in 1995, after Dumbledore told him that Voldemort had returned, Fudge refused to believe him, even when Severus Snape showed him the reactivated Dark Mark, as he finally succumbed to his paranoia. As a result, Fudge started a smear campaign to discredit and ruin Albus's reputation, ungratefully rejecting and forgetting all the assistance and advice he received from Dumbledore for the past years. As an attempt to wrest control of Hogwarts from Dumbledore, he appointed Dolores Umbridge as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher against the headmaster's will, and empowered her greatly and eventually attempted (in failure) to arrest Dumbledore on a trumped-up charge.\n\nAfter seeing Voldemort's return in the Ministry, Fudge was forced to accept it all as well as reinstate Albus's reputation. Following this, Fudge was kicked out of office in disgrace because he refused to take the steps Dumbledore offered him. When Fudge requested Dumbledore to persuade Harry Potter to lie for his behalf to the wizarding world in a last ditch effort to cling onto his position, Dumbledore refused, seeing no more desire or purpose in helping Cornelius.\n\nIn 1997, Fudge attended Dumbledore's funeral, with a miserable expression on his face and twirling his green bowler. Harry had wondered whether any of the Ministry officials who showed up were genuinely saddened by Dumbledore's death or simply putting up a façade.\n\nInitially, Fudge treated Harry Potter like an honorary nephew and gave him lenience when the underage wizard accidentally inflated his aunt Marge from his anger, rather than expel him, despite a previous offence (which was actually Dobby's doing). This was partly due to the Azkaban escapee Sirius Black, who Fudge believed to be seeking to return to Voldemort. However, in a misguided attempt to protect Harry, Fudge was too reluctant to tell the boy about Black's supposed goals as well as Harry's importance as Black's godson. In addition, Fudge refused to listen to Harry and Hermione's attempts to explain Sirius's innocence, instead going with Severus Snape's suggestion that they might have been confunded. Harry initially thought fairly well of Fudge, regarding him as a somewhat blustering and pompous, but essentially good-natured person.[19]\n\nThis kindly relationship continued until the end of the Triwizard Tournament, when Harry brought back Cedric Diggory's corpse and explained Voldemort's return to Dumbledore. Fudge, in fear that this would jeopardise the peace of his community and his seat as Minister for Magic, refused to believe Harry and Dumbledore and spread a smear campaign to make it look like they were liars and nutters who were trying to gain attention as well as take over the Ministry; his decision had partly been influenced by Rita Skeeter's writings, believing Harry to be hallucinating and that being a Parselmouth made him even more untrustworthy. Because of this, Fudge transformed Harry's disciplinary hearing of underage magic used to defend against Dementors into a heavily biased full-court trial, made the Daily Prophet print slander stories against him as though he was something of a slip-in joke, and granted Umbridge many new privileges to extensively punish and torment the boy. One of Fudge's ultimate goals was to expel Potter from Hogwarts and oust him from the magical community as an untrustworthy troublemaker.\n\nAt first, Harry was shocked by Fudge's blatant denial and somewhat desperate in regaining recognition during the trial, which did not occur, while, in extension, unsuccessfully trying to persuade his right-hand woman Umbridge. However, as Fudge's antagonism continued, Harry lost faith in the Minister and began to feel more disgusted at Fudge's increasingly tyrannical hold; Harry only felt more angry when Fudge chose to blame the Azkaban mass breakout on Sirius instead of accepting that Voldemort had returned. When Fudge came to Hogwarts to deal with the Dumbledore's Army business, he sneered at the captured Harry, who replied with the dirtiest look he could muster and thought it was worth watching Fudge's blood pressure rise from anger by denying his transgression of Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four.\n\nWhen undeniable evidence of Voldemort's return was finally given, Fudge, in a last ditch effort to remain in office, tried to persuade Harry to lie to the wizarding world (which ironically was what he had accused Harry of for a whole year) that the Ministry was doing a good job in security. This failed, as Harry hated Fudge for his actions and held him in contempt. When Harry was notified that Fudge had the gall to attempt to even ask him for such a favour, he expressed anger and disgust at the former Minister's shamelessness.\n\nDolores Umbridge was Fudge's right-hand woman, being his Senior-Undersecretary, and he trusted her greatly to place her into Hogwarts to control it. He granted her many powers through his Educational Decrees, and full-heartedly agreed with all of her comments and mockeries against Dumbledore and Harry. It is unclear whether Fudge knew the extent of Umbridge's sadistic and dark nature, but Umbridge was loyal to Fudge only because of the power he was offering her, and felt no true attachments to the misguided man.\n\nShe was also willing to break the law behind the Minister's back to get what she wanted, such as summoning Dementors in an attempt to either incapacitate Harry or force him to produce a Patronus Charm as an excuse to have him expelled as well as using the illegal Cruciatus Curse for interrogation, all the while stating that \"what Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him\".\n\nCuriously, however, in spite of believing Fudge would draw a line there, and in spite of Umbridge often and unfairly receiving far more blame (mostly from Hogwarts) than Fudge for everything that happened that year, both of them were immoral in very similar ways. Still, Umbridge ultimately used Fudge to further her lust for power, making him think she was a mindless extension of his own hunger. When Fudge was dismissed, Umbridge stood beside the new Ministers instead.\n\nFudge had a close professional association with Lucius Malfoy who was a wealthy and respectable pure-blood. (Lucius was cleared in 1981 of serving Lord Voldemort, claiming to have been under the Imperius Curse, which Fudge believed absolutely.) This association may have encouraged Fudge's own belief in the superiority of pure-bloods over those with mixed parentage, as well as \"half-breeds\" and creatures with \"near-human intelligence\" which his senior assistant, Umbridge, expressed. Fudge admired Lucius for giving donations of gold to the right causes.\n\nIn return, Fudge granted him many privileges, such as personal access to him, favours in delaying laws and revealing classified information (e.g. the Triwizard Tournament). Fudge gave Lucius tickets to sit in the top box for the Quidditch World Cup final after his generous gift to St Mungo's. Fudge first met Narcissa Malfoy and Draco there in the top box, which suggests the Malfoys and Fudges did not meet socially prior to that. Despite receiving the Minister's favours, Lucius caused him great embarrassment by secretly leading the unconvicted Death Eaters and anti-Muggle supporters in a riot that night.\n\nFudge did have disagreements with Lucius and his views. For instance, Fudge did not oppose Arthur Weasley's Muggle Protection Act, and allowed Ministry officials to conduct raids on wizard homes (later including Lucius's), searching for artefacts harmful to Muggles. This may have turned Lucius back to the Dark Arts as his plot to re-open the Chamber of Secrets and discredit Arthur came about when he did not get his way. Then, when the twelve school governors suspended Dumbledore for not being able to prevent the Chamber of Secrets incident, Fudge said it was the wrong thing to do but did not use the law to interfere with the running of Hogwarts as he would later.\n\nAfter Harry survived Voldemort's rebirth and reported to him that Lucius was one of the Death Eaters who came to the re-gathering after receiving the Dark Mark invitation, Fudge took this as a great personal offence and absolutely refused to believe it, continuing to treat Lucius with great respect and meeting him at the Ministry. He said Harry was just throwing out names of people who were cleared thirteen years previously and began a campaign to discredit Harry and Dumbledore. The next year, when Lucius's son, Draco, captured Harry for being in the illegal organisation calling itself Dumbledore's Army, Fudge commented that his father must be informed of this achievement.\n\nFudge was completely oblivious to Lucius's dark nature. Lucius, in turn, used this to his advantage and manipulated the gullible Minister to delay laws and other factors that would benefit the Death Eaters. By the time Lucius was caught red-handed as a renewed Death Eater, Lord Voldemort had a year to regain power and followers while being unopposed by the Ministry, making it that much harder for his successor to protect the wizarding world even with Lucius being locked up in Azkaban. As a result, Fudge suffered almost exactly the same consequences as Lucius: both lost their positions of influence while desperately and unsuccessfully trying to reclaim it.\n\nFudge's relationship with Amelia before he had launched an unjustified smear campaign against both Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter is unknown. But it is quite reasonable to assume that they had a mutual respect towards each other. Despite this, when Fudge had begun his campaign against Dumbledore and Harry, misusing his power, attempting to twist the laws and even threatening to dismiss members of the Ministry who supported them, Amelia's trust and respect for him began to diminish.\n\nDuring Harry's disciplinary hearing, Amelia finally saw Fudge for who he truly was: an arrogant, cowardly, corrupt, dishonourable, delusional, dishonest, incompetent, selfish and tyrannical hypocrite. Amelia was completely enraged and disgusted by Fudge's mistreatment of Harry, who was falsely accused and wrongfully expelled from Hogwarts for alleged underage use of magic in the presence of a Muggle.\n\nDespite Fudge's attempts to intimidate and purge anyone at the Ministry who supported Harry or Dumbledore, Amelia successfully maintained fairness and impartiality during the trial. She did so by disregarding Fudge's threats and ensuring that Harry was given a voice, countering the biased accusations stemming from his past actions and behaviour at school. Also, Amelia did not allow Fudge to dismiss Arabella Figg's testimony simply because she was a Squib, as Fudge hoped to discredit Harry's claims about Voldemort's resurrection.\n\nBut unfortunately for Fudge, Amelia had coldly reminded him about the operational guidelines of the wizarding world laws. She highlighted the accused's entitlement to speak up, provide witnesses, and present evidence in their defence. Also, Amelia made it clear that Harry's past actions and behaviour at school were not relevant to the current trial. She proved that Harry's use of magic in the presence of a Muggle was purely an act of self-defence. Amelia further pointed out the laws of the wizarding world, which allowed underage wizards or witches to use magic in the presence of Muggles if the circumstances were presented as a threat to everyone's safety.\n\nAfterwards, almost all the other members of the ruling court, including Amelia, voted in favour of Harry's complete exoneration from the accusations. Fudge, who was left with no choice, was compelled to reluctantly acquit Harry since he, Umbridge, and a few other members of the court were completely out-voted, much to Fudge's complete dismay and humiliation.\n\nAfter the trial, Amelia completely lost any trust and respect that she once had for Fudge, particularly because she knew that Dumbledore and Harry were being honest about Voldemort's return, while Fudge had delusionally constructed stories to protect his own reputation. Fudge claimed that Dumbledore was after his job and that Harry was an attention-seeker. Fudge's baseless claims were nothing but complete and utter nonsense, as he knew deep down that Voldemort had indeed returned, especially considering evidence like Severus Snape's Dark Mark becoming active once again. But he had still ignored the truth because he prioritised his position as Minister for Magic over the safety of the wizarding community.\n\nAfter Voldemort's public revelation of his return, Fudge was ousted from office as Minister, and his reputation was damaged beyond repair. Amelia did not have any compassion, empathy or sympathy towards the ex-Minister. As far as she was concerned, Fudge got exactly what he deserved for his misdeeds.\n\nSometime later, after Amelia had died in a battle against Voldemort, Fudge was saddened by her death. He viewed Amelia's passing as an immense tragedy, implying that he still had respect left for her despite the role that Amelia had played in his own humiliation during Harry's disciplinary hearing.\n\nAs Arthur was a lower-class person and having a poor family, Fudge always neglected him while having a manipulated friendship with his wealthy rival, Lucius Malfoy, due to Fudge's swaying of money and power. As Arthur was considered an odd duck due to his fascination with Muggle culture, Fudge was able to use that as an excuse that Mr Weasley \"did not fit\" into the Ministry norm and that he was unfit for promotion to higher office. However, despite his disapproval and neglect of Arthur, Fudge did not oppose Arthur's Muggle Protection Act, as he was also accepting towards Muggles, and he once allowed Arthur and his family to sit at the Top Box during the Quiddich World Cup.\n\nWhen Lord Voldemort had returned, Fudge suspected Arthur being in league with Dumbledore since he was aware that the two of them were friendly. He even invited Arthur's son Percy to become his Junior Assistant in an attempt to spy on the Weasley family and Dumbledore, which led to Percy defecting from his family after a row with Arthur. Fudge ignored Arthur and Harry's existences when he and the Wizengamot exited Courtroom Ten. After Fudge was ousted from office in disgrace, Arthur was instantly promoted by Fudge's successor.\n\nBecause of his position, Fudge was able to contact the Prime Minister of Muggles whenever the wizarding world faced a crisis most likely affecting Muggles. In 1996, when Lord Voldemort returned and Fudge had been forced out as Minister for Magic, he went to alert the Muggle Minister concerning the return of Voldemort. He also visited when the Prime Minister was elected, when Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban.\n\nPercy Weasley and his family were originally looked down on by Fudge due to their lack of wealth and having more affiliation with Muggles.\n\nHowever, in 1995, Fudge promoted Percy to become his Junior Minister. This was an attempt to spy on the Weasley family, but Percy's defection from his family made it pointless. However, Percy commented in his letter to his younger brother Ron that the Minister would not be more gracious to him for this defection, and he agreed with Fudge on that Harry was violent and disturbed and Dumbledore was plotting to overthrow Fudge when the Ministry began publishing articles, leading to a quarrel with his family. By Percy's claim, Fudge was actually glad that Percy left his family for the sake of the Ministry. This may have been a contradiction, as this meant Percy was no longer a source of information of the Weasley family's involvement with Dumbledore and Harry.\n\nOver the final year of Fudge's term as Minister, he kept using Percy as the court scribe for both Harry's disciplinary hearing and the discovery of Dumbledore's Army. Percy, during both moments, heartily agreed with Fudge's decisions and even laughed when Fudge made insulting mockeries at Harry and Dumbledore. When Fudge's folly had been eventually exposed and he was ousted from office in disgrace, Percy remained loyal to the Ministry but did not show any sympathy for Fudge after his dismissal.\n\nFudge had a huge hatred for Barty Crouch Snr. This was because of Barty being one of his main competitors during the election for Minister of Magic in 1990, where he was jealous of how much Crouch was admired in the Ministry. Despite winning, the election left Fudge with such a strong dislike of Crouch, so much that, Fudge's first act as Minister of Magic was to have Crouch reassigned to the Department of International Magical Cooperation, using Crouch's falling popularity after Crouch's son's trial to his advantage. Fudge's dislike of Crouch was strong to the point where he refused to take Crouch seriously when Crouch vanished after trying to warn Dumbledore about his son and Voldemort despite being in a delusional state, Fudge simply dismissed his warnings as the ramblings of a lunatic, and refused to believe the real reason he was gone until he was forced to acknowledge Voldemort's return the following year.\n\nThis dislike also extended to Crouch's son, as he believed Crouch Jnr was not a true Death Eater and that he only acted through insanity rather than his loyalty to Voldemort, calling him as a lunatic just like his father, and had no regret about Crouch Jnr receiving the Dementors Kiss and therefore ending the Crouch family line, even though Crouch Jnr could no longer testify Voldemort's return as a result. Despite his dislike of Crouch Snr, Fudge apparently required Crouch for translating foreign wizards and creatures who didn't understand English, as he struggled to communicate with the Bulgarian Minister of Magic (who was pretending to not understand English in order to prank Fudge) during the Quidditch World Cup while Crouch was absent.\n\nIt is unknown what Crouch thought of Fudge, although given his serious and rule abiding nature, he likely disliked Fudge in turn for his bumbling and incompetent nature and for reassigning him to the Department of International Magical Cooperation, which permanently ruined any further chances of Crouch becoming Minister of Magic despite his fall in popularity.\n\nWhen Fudge first ascended his ranks to the Minister for Magic, his bumbling nature failed to worry the citizens as long as he was willing to take advice from more able people such as Albus Dumbledore. However, Fudge never forgot how much the community supported Dumbledore to become the Minister in the past. As his position was the leader of the entire government, he was nevertheless highly influenced and affected by the opinion of the people as a whole. When a few people would oppose his rule which threatened his administration, he would abuse his powers to discredit such people to maintain his hold on the likings of the rest of them as well as threatening any employees with dismissal for not supporting his rule; ironically, Fudge only became popular because he took Dumbledore's advice to begin with. When Fudge awarded himself with the Order of Merlin, First Class medal, it caused controversies throughout the community, as it was common view that Fudge's career was \"less than distinguished\".[29]\n\nHowever, by ignoring Dumbledore's and Harry's warning of Voldemort's return, Fudge endangered the entire world, and despite his increasingly tyrannical hold on them, about half of the British wizard community chose to believe Dumbledore and Harry instead. When undeniable evidence of the truth finally came out, the entire community issued a virtually unanimous condemnation of Fudge's tenure, while Fudge made one last (unsuccessful) attempt to lie to them to regain their trust, which would have further endangered them by denying more preparation. Fudge was ultimately removed from office after two weeks of pressure and was remembered by history, as Dumbledore had warned him, \"as the man who stepped aside, and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild\".\n\nAs with the majority of the wizarding world, Fudge deeply feared Lord Voldemort, to the point of being unable to say his name aloud, using the evasive alternatives or writing it out. Fudge preferred the peace and tranquillity that came with Voldemort's first downfall that he refused to spoil it as long as there was insufficient evidence of his return. His fear and self-denial led him to campaign to discredit those who tried to say Voldemort was back, instead of making preparations of ensuring their victory and safety in the upcoming war. Cornelius continuously sought excuses of the increasing disappearances and the Azkaban mass breakout instead of accepting the fact that the most evil Dark Wizard has came back.\n\nOnly when seeing Voldemort in the flesh did Fudge accept the Dark Lord's return. Voldemort was able to take full advantage of Cornelius's besotted moves to rebuild his forces with no interference, and by the time the truth came out, it was too late for the disgraced Minister to defend the community. Despite his fear, Cornelius refused to stand aside when Voldemort threatened him with mass murder of Muggles. Voldemort followed through with his threat, destroying the Brockdale Bridge, leading to many Muggles' deaths, which caused more trouble for Fudge's administration.",
