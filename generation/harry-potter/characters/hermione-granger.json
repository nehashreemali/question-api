  "content": "Minister Hermione Jean[28] Granger (b. 19 September 1979)[1] was an English Muggle-born[3] witch born to Mr and Mrs Granger. At the age of eleven, she learned about her magical nature and was accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hermione began attending Hogwarts in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. She possessed a brilliant academic mind and proved to be a gifted student in almost every subject that she studied, to the point where she was nearly made a Ravenclaw by the Sorting Hat.\n\nHermione first met her future best friends Harry Potter and Ron Weasley aboard the Hogwarts Express, and initially they found her unfriendly and somewhat of an 'insufferable know-it-all', an impression reinforced by her constant correct answers and eagerness to please the professors. However, she stepped in to take the blame from the boys after they had saved her from a troll on Hallowe'en in 1991, surprising them in a grateful way, which led to them quickly becoming friends. She later played a crucial role in protecting the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort.\n\nIn her second year, Hermione had a key role in the discovery of the Chamber of Secrets, before falling victim to the Basilisk unleashed upon Hogwarts following the opening of the Chamber. However, she recovered from the petrification under the care of Madam Pomfrey with Professor Sprout's Mandrake Restorative Draught. The next year, Hermione was granted permission to use a Time-Turner from the Ministry of Magic to facilitate her volition to study far more subjects than were possible without time travel, though she and Harry later used it to rescue Sirius Black from the Dementor's Kiss and Buckbeak the hippogriff from execution.\n\nDuring her fourth year, Hermione became an advocate for the better treatment of house-elves, forming the association S.P.E.W., and helped in Harry's preparation for the Triwizard Tournament. In her fifth year, Hermione was the driving force behind the creation of Dumbledore's Army and fought alongside fellow D.A. members in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. In her sixth year, Hermione continued her role as Prefect and fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.\n\nHermione played a significant role in many other battles of the Second Wizarding War, as well. In 1997, she fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters, alongside the Order of the Phoenix. Hermione and Ron decided not to return to Hogwarts for their final year of studies, instead choosing to accompany Harry on his quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, a quest in which several of her actions were essential. She destroyed Hufflepuff's Cup, a Horcrux, with Ron using a Basilisk fang found in the Chamber of Secrets. Hermione then fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, helping in the defeat of the Death Eater who tortured her: Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\nFollowing the Second Wizarding War, Hermione went back to Hogwarts to complete her education. She later found employment with the Ministry of Magic, furthering the cause for the better treatment of house-elves. Afterward, she was promoted to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, where she dedicated herself to eradicating old laws that were biased in favour of pure-bloods. Hermione eventually married Ron Weasley and together they had two children, Rose and Hugo. She became the godmother of Harry and Ginny Potter's eldest son James. By the year 2019, Hermione had become the thirty-sixth Minister for Magic.\n\nHermione Granger was born to Mr and Mrs Granger, both dentists, on 19 September 1979. She was their only child and daughter.[29] The couple chose 'a nice, unusual' first name for her because they wanted to establish how educated and intelligent they were, while also knowing that she would be unique and special.[30] Mr and Mrs Granger were 'a bit bemused' by the oddities displayed by their daughter, but they were proud and accepting of her nonetheless. The couple gave Hermione a bedroom on the first-floor of their house,[31] and they lived happily for many years.\n\nUpon turning eleven, Hermione was happily surprised to learn that she was a witch and was therefore invited to attend Hogwarts. She eagerly accepted and took to studying magic even before she began her first year at Hogwarts in the September of 1991, learning all the set spell books by heart and even managing to perform 'a few spells' at home successfully. In addition to the texts set by the school, Hermione brought with her several other books for reference and to further her understanding of the wizarding world,[3] to the point that she had looked at books and had more knowledge of the wizarding world than some of her pure-blood and half-blood classmates.\n\nHermione enjoyed her years as a pupil at Hogwarts and took assignments, classes, and school rules very seriously. She was often described as brilliant, to the point of being said to be 'the brightest witch of her age'. Her favourite subject was initially Charms, and later Arithmancy. Given her keen mind, some students — such as Terry Boot — wondered why Hermione was Sorted into Gryffindor rather than Ravenclaw, and she admitted that the Sorting Hat did consider putting her in Ravenclaw. It is likely that the Sorting Hat ultimately put her in Gryffindor after stalling for about 4 minutes because Hermione chose to be in it, just like Harry chose to not be in Slytherin; this is reinforced by how on the train earlier she stated that 'Gryffindor... sounds by far the best.'\n\nShe later proved her rightful place in Gryffindor with her steadfast bravery and loyalty to her friends, Hogwarts, and Dumbledore's Army. After being Sorted into Gryffindor, Hermione shared a dormitory with Lavender Brown, Parvati Patil, Fay Dunbar and an unnamed ginger-haired girl.[32]\n\nIn spite of always wanting to follow the school rules, after Hermione became friends with Harry and Ron, she would disobey the rules along with them in order to successfully complete their group affairs. For example, she went with Ron and Harry into the third-floor corridor in their first year, which students were temporarily forbidden from entering, in order to save the Philosopher's Stone; she assisted in creating the Polyjuice Potion in their second year; and although Harry was the one who taught Dumbledore's Army in their fifth year, she was the one who came up with the idea.\n\nHermione was a couple of weeks away from turning twelve when she boarded the Hogwarts Express in 1991, where she met Harry Potter and Ron Weasley while helping Neville Longbottom find his pet toad, Trevor. Hermione demonstrated knowledge and talent with magic beyond most of those her age, despite having only recently discovered that she was a witch. She wished to be a Gryffindor or a Ravenclaw, and her wish was granted considering she did get sorted into Gryffindor.\n\nHermione soon proved to be the best in all her classes, eager to please the professors and to help others learn, albeit in a bossy way that made it difficult for her to make friends. Although she was a know-it-all, Hermione did often help Neville Longbottom, who struggled in most classes other than Herbology.[3]\n\nHermione strictly followed all school rules and tried to prevent other students from breaking rules and getting into trouble. On one night, she followed Harry and Ron as they were leaving Gryffindor Tower to duel Draco Malfoy. They were chased by Argus Filch, acting on a tipoff by Malfoy, into the third-floor corridor — forbidden to students — where they came face-to-face with Fluffy, a three-headed dog belonging to Hagrid. Later on, she argued that her spying was to their benefit when she pointed out the dog had been standing on a trapdoor, which neither Harry nor Ron had noticed.[3]\n\nThe friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione was solidified when, on Hallowe'en in 1991, the three were forced to confront a mountain troll, which had been secretly let into the school by Professor Quirinus Quirrell. Unaware that a troll was on the loose in the school, Hermione had spent that day crying in the girls' bathroom after overhearing Ron making unkind comments about her.\n\nThe troll made its way into the bathroom she was in, and Harry and Ron came to her rescue, saving her. When Professors Minerva McGonagall, Severus Snape and Quirinus Quirrell arrived at the scene, Hermione covered for the boys, claiming she was fighting the troll because she had thought that she could manage, having read a great deal about them and that Ron and Harry had merely come to help her escape. From then on, the three students reconciled and were best friends and spent large amounts of time together.[3]\n\nThe incident with the troll was by no means her only adventure in that first year. During the first Quidditch match, Hermione set Professor Snape's robes on fire when she thought he was jinxing Harry's broom. In the spring of 1992, Hagrid, now a friend of Hermione's through Harry, managed to procure a Dragon egg, the unlicensed possession of which was illegal. The three children secretly helped Hagrid care for the beast, which he'd named Norbert. When the dragon was discovered, she and Harry smuggled it out of the school to some friends of Ron's elder brother, Charlie Weasley, who worked as a dragon-tamer.\n\nOn their way back to the dormitories they were caught by Argus Filch, who escorted them to Professor Minerva McGonagall. Along with Neville Longbottom and Draco Malfoy, they received detention and had fifty points deducted each from their respective houses.[3]\n\nAfter their run-in with Fluffy, Harry deduced that whatever Hagrid had retrieved from Gringotts was beneath the trapdoor. Hagrid let it slip that '... What's under that trapdoor is strictly between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel'. After much research turned up nothing, Harry was given a Dumbledore Chocolate Frog Card by Neville, which mentions Dumbledore's work in Alchemy with Flamel. This led Hermione to look at a large book on Alchemy which she had borrowed from the library for 'a bit of light reading'. After consulting the book, she realised that Fluffy was guarding the Philosopher's Stone.[3]\n\nFearing that Lord Voldemort would return if he stole the stone, and believing that Snape was acting as a double agent and attempting to steal it, Harry decided to steal it first. When he told Hermione that he could go on alone, she rebuffed him. After the trio passed Fluffy, it was Hermione who freed Ron from a patch of Devil's Snare he had dropped into by conjuring Bluebell Flames. She later got herself and Harry through a challenge involving a potion riddle in order to obtain the right potion between many of them. Hermione used her logic to figure out the riddle and let Harry go forward without her, as there was only enough potion for one person.[3]\n\nLater, at the Farewell Feast in the Great Hall, Hermione, Harry, Ron, and Neville were all awarded extra House points for bravery and heroism, allowing Gryffindor to win the House Cup. Hermione earned fifty points for Gryffindor by correctly solving Professor Snape's potion riddle.[3]\n\nBefore she started her second year, Hermione wrote several letters to Harry at Privet Drive, all of which were intercepted by Dobby, as the house-elf wanted Harry to believe that his friends had forgotten him in order to prevent his return to Hogwarts. She and her parents also accompanied Harry and the Weasley family to Diagon Alley to shop for school supplies.[4]\n\nIt was during her second school year that Hermione first encountered the prejudice and hatred surrounding her blood status, when Draco Malfoy called her a 'filthy little Mudblood' after she told him off for insulting the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Hermione had never heard the highly offensive term but looking around at everyone around her, it was an obvious fact. Fred and George Weasley lunged at him, and Ron even tried to hex him, but it backfired, as his wand had been damaged. To help Hermione feel better about the incident, Hagrid urged her not to think about it, pointing out that she was a talented witch, regardless of what bigoted people said about her Muggle-born status.[4]\n\nHarry and Ron were surprised, and Ron annoyed, by Hermione's obvious crush on Gilderoy Lockhart, who became that year's Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. She scored full marks on the first quiz in his class, which consisted entirely of questions pertaining to Lockhart's books, including a question regarding his favourite colour (lilac) that most of the class had answered incorrectly. In fact, she went as far as to doodle hearts on her DADA assignments, not knowing until later that he was, in reality, a self-obsessed fraud.[4]\n\nOn Hallowe'en 1992 Hermione attended Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday Party with Harry and Ron. Whilst heading back upstairs, she followed Harry in a detour, after he claimed to be hearing voices. They discovered the caretaker's cat, Mrs Norris, petrified and the walls vandalised. Hermione began spending all her free time in the Hogwarts Library after she saw the writing on the corridor walls, which had said that the Chamber of Secrets had been re-opened. Despite hoping to read about the legend, she could not, as all the books had been previously checked out.[4]\n\nHermione shocked everyone when she actually interrupted Professor Binns during a History of Magic class, asking about the Chamber of Secrets. This was the only known time when a student had asked the boring professor a question, and the class was interested in what he had to say. Professor Binns had stated that Salazar Slytherin had hidden a chamber which consisted of a horrible monster. It had been unleashed before once by an 'Heir of Slytherin', petrifying many Muggle-born and had also killed a Ravenclaw girl, named Myrtle Warren, who began haunting the girls' lavatory and became known as Moaning Myrtle. Slytherin, a pure-blood loyalist, was against Muggle-born children being allowed to attend Hogwarts, but he was outnumbered by the other founders and Muggle-borns like Hermione were permitted as students. Slytherin fled the school, but rumours spread that he had built a hidden chamber; it was said that the school had been searched many times, but no such chamber had been found.[4]\n\nWhen Harry proposed the theory that Draco Malfoy was the Heir of Slytherin, Hermione and Ron agreed. Hermione suggested that they brew Polyjuice Potion, and temporarily transform themselves into Slytherin students in an attempt to find out the truth. She went even further by daring to check Moste Potente Potions out of the library using a note from Professor Lockhart — who had no idea what the book was — in the desire to research the potion. The book was in the Restricted Section and therefore unavailable to younger students without permission from a teacher. She hoped that they would be able to obtain a viable confession from Malfoy, if he was unaware he was being interrogated. She brewed the potion in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, as no one used it due to Myrtle herself being highly irritating. She also risked serious consequences when she stole potion ingredients from Professor Snape's personal cupboards that were needed for the difficult potion, which took a month to brew.[4]\n\nUnfortunately, Hermione was unable to join Harry and Ron in the ruse with Polyjuice Potion because the hair she obtained from Slytherin Millicent Bulstrode during their scuffle in the Duelling Club was actually the hair of Bulstrode's cat. Hermione grew fur and a tail and remained in the Hospital Wing for weeks as she did not transform back when the normal duration of effectiveness — one hour — was up. Harry and Ron, however, were able to use the potion she brewed to transform into Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe, respectively. They entered the Slytherin common room, and through conversation with Draco Malfoy, realised that he was not the Heir of Slytherin, and was not involved in the opening of the Chamber after all.[4] Meanwhile, Hermione continued to complete her school work from her bed in the Hospital Wing while she recovered.[33]\n\nMonths after her recovery from the Polyjuice complication, Hermione suffered another accident. Drawing the connection between Harry hearing voices in the walls and him being a Parselmouth, she came to the conclusion that the creature attacking students must be a Basilisk, and rushed to the library to conduct further research. On her way back from the library, she warned the first person she saw, Penelope Clearwater, and advised her to look around corners with a mirror before going anywhere. It saved both their lives, because they were both petrified when they spotted the Basilisk's eyes through the mirror instead of dying immediately as they would have done if they'd looked straight into its eyes.[4]\n\nThough she was petrified for the rest of the school year, Hermione was still able to assist Harry and Ron, for she had torn out the page on Basilisks and scribbled on it 'pipes', referencing the manner in which the creature had moved around the school undetected. Harry and Ron found it clenched in her hand when they were finally allowed to visit her in the Hospital Wing. Using this note and other information they had gathered, Harry and Ron were able to successfully put an end to Lord Voldemort's plans to resurrect his body through his memory stored in an old school diary.[4]\n\nHermione was later cured with a Mandrake Restorative Draught created by Professor Sprout. Upon arriving at the Great Hall, she was immediately greeted by Nearly Headless Nick. After hugging Harry she exchanged an awkward greeting with Ron. Hermione was disappointed to learn that, as a special treat for the school, Professor Dumbledore cancelled the students' end of year exams, but she was intensely proud that her friends had solved the mystery.[4] That summer, Hermione went on holiday to France with her parents.[34]\n\nJust before she began the 1993-1994 school year, while visiting Diagon Alley with Harry and the Weasley family, Hermione met and adopted a ginger part-Kneazle cat named Crookshanks from the Magical Menagerie. However, her new bond with her cat caused friction with Ron and his pet rat Scabbers, as Crookshanks was always trying to catch the rat. Also at the beginning of this school year, Hermione obtained a Time-Turner from Professor McGonagall so she could double up on classes, though this was kept secret from everyone, even Harry and Ron.\n\nWhen Harry received a Firebolt for Christmas with no note, Hermione reported it to Professor McGonagall, thinking it was sent by Sirius Black, whom everyone believed to be a dangerous murderer who was after Harry. His broom was taken away to be inspected, which caused a temporary rift between the two friends. There was a further social strain for Hermione when Ron accused Crookshanks of eating Scabbers, who had disappeared.\n\nHermione poured herself into defending Buckbeak, the hippogriff on trial before the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures for attacking Draco Malfoy during a Care of Magical Creatures class. Once the trio reconciled, after Hagrid told Harry and Ron how disappointed he was when they selfishly put the Firebolt and Scabbers over their friendship with Hermione, they apologised. Their initial attempt to save Buckbeak failed, as Lucius Malfoy frightened the Committee into deciding that the creature would be executed. Hermione was extremely upset by this news and grew furious to the point of slapping Draco Malfoy when he dared to mock Hagrid for his tears and being upset over Buckbeak's fate.\n\nThat year, Hermione was among the students who found Remus Lupin to be the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher they have ever had. She cleverly deduced that Professor Lupin was a werewolf, based on his Boggart taking the form of a full moon, the timing of his unexplained absences from class, and Professor Snape changing a lesson he took over to the subject of werewolves even though it wasn't due on the syllabus for weeks. However, she didn't expose Lupin, presumably because she believed he was a good teacher and didn't agree with the prejudice many hold against werewolves.\n\nDivination, on the other hand, turned out to be a subject Hermione had no respect or interest in. She considered it a 'woolly subject' and mocked it to Harry and Ron. She also considered it less interesting then the subject of Ancient Runes. She also believed that Divination was an imprecise branch of magic, an opinion she and Professor McGonagall shared.[34] She soon dropped the subject after Professor Sybill Trelawney told her that she did not possess the Second Sight.\n\nOn the day of Buckbeak's execution, the trio ventured down to console Hagrid. While in his cabin, Hermione discovered Scabbers, Ron's lost rat. Hagrid urged them to leave and they witnessed from a distance what they believed to be Buckbeak's execution. Before they could return to their dormitory, Scabbers bit Ron and fled. While chasing after the rat, they were attacked by a black dog, which pulled Ron by the leg into a tunnel beneath the Whomping Willow, which then attacked them.\n\nAfterward, Hermione and Harry hurried after them eventually arriving in the Shrieking Shack, where Sirius Black, whose Animagus form was the black dog, confronted them. They were soon joined by Professor Lupin who was acting strangely, and Hermione told Harry and Ron of her belief that he was a werewolf, which he then confirmed. It was revealed that Sirius had been framed for the betrayal of James and Lily Potter, and that the true traitor was Peter Pettigrew, who had been hiding from the world as Ron's pet rat. Hermione also cast Expelliarmus on Snape when he discovered them, knocking him out, at which she was horrified.\n\nOnce it had been decided that Pettigrew would be turned over to the authorities rather than murdered, the motley group left the Shrieking Shack. When the full moon appeared, chaos ensued as Lupin transformed into a werewolf as, due to the chaotic turn of events, he hadn't taken the Wolfsbane Potion that Professor Snape produced for him monthly in order for him to retain his humanity. In the chaos, Pettigrew attacked Ron and escaped, and Sirius had to transform into his dog form in order to protect Harry, Ron, and Hermione from the werewolf. After Lupin was eventually distracted by a howl from the Forbidden Forest, Hermione and Harry rushed to Sirius' aid when they heard him moaning, but hundreds of Dementors descended on them, come to recapture Sirius who quickly fainted, and Harry told Hermione to think of something happy and attempt to cast a Patronus as he was trying to himself, but she was unable to cast one.\n\nAs Harry conjured an incorporeal Patronus, Hermione passed out, leaving Harry to fight the Dementors alone. Harry held them off for a while but was eventually overwhelmed. The Dementors were about to perform the Dementor's Kiss on Harry, Hermione, and Sirius when a mysterious figure in the distance cast a very powerful Patronus Charm to repel the Dementors. Unable to see properly in the resulting blinding light, Harry thought he glimpsed his father just before he, too, lost consciousness.\n\nHarry and Hermione awoke in the Hospital Wing after being rescued by Severus Snape, who conjured stretchers for Hermione, Harry and Sirius. After realising that Sirius' soul was to be destroyed by the Dementor's Kiss and receiving vague, though instructive and useful, instructions from Dumbledore, Hermione used her Time-Turner to return herself and Harry to a time earlier in the evening. It was a very difficult task and Harry had to be constantly reminded by Hermione to stay concealed as being seen could cause irreparable damage to their timelines. Hermione agreed with Harry that it was difficult to watch their problems again, but she strictly said that they could do nothing about it, as bad things happened to wizards who tried to meddle with their past and future lives.\n\nThe two did, however, successfully use the opportunity to rescue Sirius and also Buckbeak, as it was hinted by Dumbledore that more than one innocent life could be spared that night.[34] Whilst waiting, she discussed their saviour with Harry, and when Harry realised that it was not his father he saw but himself having travelled back in time, she claimed that none but a powerful wizard could have conjured a Patronus to drive away that many Dementors. As evidenced by her assertion that time-travelling was extremely dangerous, Hermione took great personal risk to save Sirius and Buckbeak. At the end of the year Hermione returned her Time-Turner, claiming it caused too much trouble and that she would drop a few subjects instead, which was a very big surprise to everyone.\n\nBefore her fourth year at Hogwarts, Hermione spent much of the summer holidays at The Burrow with Harry and Ron, sharing a room with Ginny Weasley. With the other Weasleys (excluding Molly Weasley), they attended the 1994 Quidditch World Cup in August. After the game, the communal campsite was set upon by Death Eaters. Hermione, Harry, and Ron fled into the woods and witnessed the casting of Morsmordre. Initially caught up in the chaos surrounding the effort to catch the caster, she took exception to the accusations levelled against Harry, and the many wizards' treatment of the house-elf Winky who had also been at the scene.\n\nOnce at Hogwarts, it was revealed to the students that former Auror Alastor Moody (who was, in fact, a polyjuiced Barty Crouch Jnr) was to be the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Lupin having left at the end of the previous year due to Snape outing his werewolf status. Moody was a hands-on professor who believed in a practical approach when it came to defence. One of his earliest lessons was on the Unforgivable Curses. Hermione and her fellow classmates witnessed the curse's effects on a spider.\n\nHermione began a crusade for the liberation of house-elves by beginning the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, or what she and the group called S.P.E.W, (or, as Ronald Weasley called it, 'spew') having been appalled by Bartemius Crouch's abusive treatment of his house-elf Winky. This did not earn her any popularity, as most believed that house-elves enjoy their work; indeed, even the house-elves did not like her campaigning. At one point, she began writing a journal about the group.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Neville only reluctantly joined S.P.E.W., mostly in order to prevent Hermione from nagging them about it. Hagrid as well as Fred and George Weasley refused to join on the grounds that it would upset the house-elves. Despite this, Fred did tell Hermione how to get into the Hogwarts kitchens. One morning she (along with Harry and Ron) visited the kitchens, where she spoke to Dobby and Winky. Dobby was pleased to see Harry and his friends and proceeded to tell them his struggles as a freed elf.\n\nWhile the trio were within the kitchen it was revealed that Winky was so saddened by the lose of her previous job that she had taken to drinking Butterbeer, as a means to get drunk and numb her pain. Hermione considered Dobby to be a good example of a free elf and tried to comfort Winky about being sacked by Crouch. This did little good, however, as Winky soon became upset by Hermione's claims that house-elves deserved to have holidays and wages. Winky was not the only elf bothered by this, as the other elves stated that proper house-elves would never need such things and to want them is considered very shameful.\n\nAfter the events surrounding Harry's name coming out of the Goblet of Fire, Hermione was the only student who believed Harry's innocence. In fact, she 'accepted his story without question'. Even Ron was suspicious that Harry had cheated in order to gain more glory, creating a rift between the two for some time. Hermione helped Harry prepare for the first task of the Triwizard Tournament by helping him learn useful spells. Some of the spells were Stupefy, Impedimenta, Accio, the Shield Charm, and the Four-Point Spell. She also tried to get Harry and Ron to talk to one another multiple times.\n\nHermione unknowingly attracted the interest of Durmstrang Triwizard Champion and Bulgarian International Seeker, Viktor Krum. He was attracted to her due to her intelligence, unconventional beauty, and the manner in which she declined to hound him for autographs, unlike other girls. Krum began following Hermione to the library and other places around Hogwarts, including the library. This was something that Hermione found very irritating, as she couldn't work when surrounded by giggling girls, who had taken it upon themselves to follow Krum throughout the castle and the school grounds. Krum even bizarrely asked Harry if it was all right for him to pursue Hermione. He eventually asked her to attend the Yule Ball with him, and she accepted, not telling anyone but Ginny Weasley that she was his date.\n\nThus, when the pair arrived, many were stunned and jealous. Hermione wore robes of a 'floaty, periwinkle-blue material', and her hair in an 'elegant knot at the back of her head'.[35] The attention to her appearance was unusual, and she received many positive remarks on it. Even Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson had nothing negative to say. Hermione commented that she had used Sleekeazy's Hair Potion, but that it was too much work to use it every day.\n\nUpon seeing Hermione with Krum, Ron was overcome with jealousy. Hermione had hoped for Ron to ask her, but his invitation was insensitive and at the last minute due to him not being able to find anyone else. The two rowed about it in the common room after the ball, in which she revealed that he should have asked her properly and not 'as a last resort', but Ron misunderstood the point. After that, the two were seemingly more polite to each other, although more distant for a time and Ron continued to show dislike and distrust towards Krum.\n\nHermione was chosen as a 'kidnap victim' for Krum during the Tournament's second task, something that she subsequently endured teasing over. She was taken to the bottom of the Black Lake to await rescue from Krum, who donned a half-shark Transfiguration. While in the Black Lake Harry was conflicted and wanted to retrieve her as much as he wanted to retrieve Ron. He stated that 'she was his friend too'. Krum managed to rescue her and carried her to the surface, where he revealed to her later that he 'never felt this way about any other girl' and asked her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer.[35]\n\nKrum was jealous of Hermione's relationship with Harry Potter, thinking that there may have been something romantic between them that went beyond just plain friendship. The jealousy was founded based on the lies in the Daily Prophet and Harry was quick to inform Krum of these lies.\n\nRita Skeeter, a journalist for the Daily Prophet and unregistered Animagus, was hiding in beetle form in Hermione's hair during her conversation with Viktor. Hermione had previously reprimanded Skeeter for printing horrible lies about Harry and Rubeus Hagrid. This angered the journalist, who wrote a scathing article on 'the devious Miss Granger', claiming that she was toying with both Harry and Krum's affections and that she had developed a taste for famous wizards.\n\nSkeeter even went so far to claim that Hermione was possibly brewing love potions. In the words of Ron, Skeeter was making Hermione out to be a 'Scarlet Woman', a phrase which made Hermione laugh. She called Hermione 'plain' in the article, in spite of previously reporting Hermione as Harry's 'stunningly pretty... girlfriend' by likely twisting and sensationalising the words of Colin Creevey and thus using this as the basis for the article.\n\nAlthough Hermione found the lies ridiculous, some people believed them and started sending Hermione hate mail, including one filled with Bubotuber Pus, and even Molly Weasley treated her coldly until Harry corrected her. Hermione vowed to get revenge on Skeeter for her libel, and wondered how she was getting her information, as several things Skeeter knew had only been discussed in private conversations. This led her to come to the realisation that Skeeter was an illegal unregistered Animagus, who took the form of a beetle to secretly witness confidential exchanges.\n\nThe students were shocked when Harry returned at the end of the third and final task with Cedric Diggory's dead body. Hermione was relieved to see Harry when he was brought to the infirmary by Professor Dumbledore. She was upset with Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge when he refused to believe Harry and Dumbledore about the truth of Voldemort's return. During her time with Harry in the Hospital Wing, she noticed Skeeter on a windowsill, attempting to eavesdrop, and captured her in the process. Hermione did not go against Harry's story when she finally heard it, sticking by her best friend.\n\nOn the ride home on the Hogwarts Express, Hermione happily revealed to Harry and Ron that she uncovered Skeeter's status as an unregistered Animagus and had trapped her in a jar. She as an unregistered beetle Animagus that used her tiny size to come onto school grounds and listen to private conversations. She was not allowed onto school grounds and Hermione caught her on a windowsill in the hospital wing. Hermione also noticed the markings around Rita's antennae were exactly like the foul glasses she wore. She kept Skeeter from writing for a year by threatening to expose her to the authorities.\n\nShe single-handed drove Skeeter into poverty, gaining revenge for the pain caused to Harry and her other friends. However, with the return of Lord Voldemort and the murder of Cedric Diggory at the end of the school year,[35] there were much more serious challenges ahead for Hermione and her friends. Hermione along with her friends and school mates attended the Memorial Feast for Cedric.\n\nFollowing the death of Cedric Diggory, the Ministry of Magic refused to accept Harry and Dumbledore's claims that Lord Voldemort had returned, and the Daily Prophet labelled them either liars or nutters. However, Hermione and Ron believed Harry and defended him against the criticism of doubtful classmates. Though occasionally Harry vented his frustration at them, the two stuck by him. The trio also wanted to become members of the reconvened Order of the Phoenix but were not allowed to because they were underage. Hermione helped exterminate 12 Grimmauld Place, which served as headquarters for the Order, and was immensely relieved when Harry was acquitted of the charge of having used underage magic in the presence of a muggle, after him and Dudley Dursley were attacked by a Dementor in Little Whinging.\n\nBefore returning to Hogwarts, she and Ron learned that they had been appointed prefects for Gryffindor house, to the secret consternation of Harry, who couldn't believe Ron had been chosen over him. She took her position very seriously. Once the school year began, Hermione resumed some of her activism on behalf of house-elves, though she was not as intense about S.P.E.W. as she had been the previous year.\n\nShe learned how to knit socks and hats for the house-elves and hid them in Gryffindor Tower, disguising them with crumpled rubbish in an attempt to trick the house-elves into accidentally freeing themselves. The elves found this attempt insulting, and they stopped cleaning the Tower at all. Dobby was the only one who enjoyed the gifts, took everything Hermione had made, and cleaned the Tower by himself, a fact which Hermione didn't know.\n\nHermione was challenged in more ways than one that year when she met Luna Lovegood, whose belief in many things without logical grounds baffled Hermione. However, the two became friends after accepting one another's differences.[32]\n\nMeanwhile, it was not long before Hermione realised that the Ministry of Magic had decided to interfere at Hogwarts. Dolores Umbridge, a cruel, falsely sweet Ministry employee with a personality like 'poisoned honey', was appointed as the new professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts and Hermione, like Harry and Ron, disliked Umbridge for many reasons, one of which being that she refused to teach students practical defence, focusing only on theory, despite their OWLs being later that year.\n\nWith this being the case, Hermione decided that Hogwarts needed a competent teacher and, together with Harry and Ron, founded Dumbledore's Army, a secret organisation in which students would gather after classes and be taught practical defensive spells. She suggested that Harry be the teacher; though he originally thought the idea ridiculous, he consented to teach the class. The name was suggested by Ginny, who recalled the conversation they'd had about Fudge's greatest fear being that Dumbledore would form an army of students if the Ministry did not intervene at Hogwarts.\n\nOne of the many advanced spells Hermione learned was the Patronus Charm; hers took the corporeal form of an otter.[23] Hermione became one of the few people brave enough to call Voldemort by his actual name. However, Hermione made the mistake of arranging the first meeting to take place in the Hog's Head, as opposed to the Three Broomsticks, which Sirius, appearing in the Gryffindor Common Room fire, said would have made it a lot harder for anyone to overhear. Willy Widdershins, who was in the Hog's Head, went to Umbridge, who instituted Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four to forbid any type of students groups from being formed under her watchful eye.\n\nHalfway through the year at Hogwarts, Harry had a vision of Voldemort's snake, Nagini, biting Mr Weasley during his task for the Order of the Phoenix. Mr Weasley was carried into St Mungo's Hospital, where Mrs Weasley screamed at him for trying to stitch his wound instead of healing it with magic.\n\nHermione was one of the few who visited him and stayed at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place for a couple of weeks until Mr Weasley was nursed back to health. Hermione had managed to convince her parents by telling them that skiing wasn't really her thing and that people who were serious about their exams stayed at Hogwarts and studied.\n\nThe D.A. brought Harry into greater contact with Cho Chang. After a meeting, Harry kissed Cho, and when he returned to the Gryffindor Common Room Hermione immediately guessed, asking if Cho had cornered him after the meeting. When Harry told them that Cho has been crying, she explained to Harry and Ron that Cho was having a hard time since Cedric Diggory, who she used to go out with, was killed by Lord Voldemort. Hermione later gave Harry advice on Cho and girls in general.\n\nIn an effort to combat the lies being told about Harry, Hermione arranged for an interview during a Hogsmeade visit with Rita Skeeter to be printed in The Quibbler telling his side of the story, blackmailing Skeeter into penning it in a sympathetic tone. Despite being banned — or maybe because it was banned — it became the magazine's best-selling issue of all time.[32]\n\nIt was Hermione's brilliant spell-work that ensured the security of Dumbledore's Army. She created coins enchanted with the Protean Charm, an advanced spell, as a method of communication, and jinxed the club's attendance sheet to give any tattler a horrendous rash on the face, which would spell out 'SNEAK' in painful boils. This is exactly what happened to Marietta Edgecombe, a reluctant member of the D.A., having been brought to the meetings by Cho. Shortly before Easter, Marietta finally caved under the pressure from her ministry mother who worked in the the Floo Network Office and betrayed the D.A. to Umbridge. When Harry learned that they could not find a counter-curse to heal her face, he swelled with pride at Hermione's jinxing ability.\n\nDobby the house-elf learned of this turn of events and rushed to the Room of Requirement to warn Harry and the D.A. They immediately scattered, and most members escaped, but Harry was caught by Umbridge and several Slytherin students who were members of the Inquisitorial Squad. A search of the room uncovered the parchment that each member of the D.A. had signed, headed Dumbledore's Army. Finally having 'proof' that Dumbledore was building an army to challenge the Ministry, Umbridge immediately contacted Cornelius Fudge. Dumbledore fled the school and Umbridge became Headmistress. Hermione was not exposed at that time, but later she was brought to Umbridge's office by the some members of the Inquisitorial Squad.\n\nLate in the fall of that year, Hagrid, who had been missing for the entirety of the school year, returned to Hogwarts. Hermione, Harry, and Ron ventured down to see him immediately even though it was after curfew. Hermione was aghast at the injuries Hagrid had sustained and greatly curious as to his story. Hagrid told the trio about his mission with Madame Maxime to try and recruit the giants in the fight against Voldemort. They were almost caught when Umbridge called on Hagrid that night, but hid under the Invisibilty Cloak.\n\nMonths later, Hermione and Harry learned why Hagrid was perpetually bruised and cut; he had brought his giant half-brother Grawp back to Hogwarts, as he was getting severely bullied, and was trying to teach him human ways. After Grawp, who had the mental age of a human toddler, picked her up, Hermione forcefully told him to put him down. He subsequently became enamoured with Hermione, calling her 'Hermy'. It was one of the few words he could pronounce.\n\nJust after their class took their O.W.L.s, Harry had a vision of his godfather being tortured by Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries. Hermione was worried that it was a trap and convinced Harry to try to contact Sirius before doing anything rash. To that end, she accompanied Harry in an act of solidarity as he sneaked into Umbridge's office to use the Floo Network, with the assistance of Ron, Ginny, and Luna Lovegood, but they were ultimately caught. When Umbridge threatened to use the Cruciatus Curse on Harry during questioning, Hermione interceded. She came up with a lie that she and her fellow D.A. members had been building a weapon for Dumbledore, thus stopping Umbridge's sadistic interrogation and attempted torture of Harry.\n\nHermione successfully lured Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest by saying that's where the weapon was hidden, where Umbridge was carried away by a herd of centaurs. She had predicted that the centaurs would let her and Harry go, since they did not insult the centaurs and were young enough to be considered 'foals'. However, the centaurs were already enraged by Umbridge and were further angered when Hermione admitted that she had hoped that they would drive Umbridge off, being insulted that they were thought of to do the bidding of humans. The centaurs were about to carry the two students off as well, but Grawp stumbled onto the scene and a fight broke out between the giant and the herd. This allowed Hermione and Harry to escape and meet up with Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Neville, who had escaped from the Inquisitorial Squad.\n\nAfter a brief argument between Harry and Neville over whether or not the others were going to travel with Harry to London, an understanding was reached. The six students flew on Thestrals (which the majority, Hermione included, could not even see) to the Ministry of Magic to try to save Sirius from Voldemort and his Death Eaters.\n\nHermione's fear turned out to be justified, as Harry's vision was a ruse planted in his brain by Voldemort designed to lure him to the Ministry to obtain a prophecy Voldemort sought. As soon as Harry did this, the six D.A. members were surrounded by Death Eaters, and a battle ensued. Hermione stunned Nott when he grabbed Harry, thus freeing him and causing Nott to be injured by the collapsing shelves of prophecies. She later stunned another Death Eater and Silenced Antonin Dolohov before he could alert the other Death Eaters to the group's location. She was critically injured by the curse Dolohov subsequently struck her with, but made a full recovery.[32]\n\nHermione achieved high academic prestige when she obtained ten O.W.L.s, in Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Care of Magical Creatures, Arithmancy, History of Magic, Herbology, Astronomy, Potions, and Ancient Runes. She received 'Outstanding' marks on each of them, except Defence Against the Dark Arts in which she received an 'Exceeds Expectations'. In total she achieved 10 O.W.L.s. Ron found it amusing that she actually seemed disappointed by this.[36]\n\nBy the time they arrived in Hogwarts, Hermione's romantic feelings for Ron had become obvious. According to Harry the two seemed on their way to a romantic relationship. Hermione and Ron's relationship suffered greatly in their sixth year, when Ron became envious of both Hermione and Harry, who were invited to be members of the Slug Club, a group of students favoured by Potions professor Horace Slughorn, while he was ignored. Hermione strongly disapproved of Harry using the textbook of the 'Half-Blood Prince' to get ahead in Potions unfairly, though she did not turn him in and indirectly found a clue about the book owner. She was particularly alarmed by the increasingly Dark nature of the magic in the book, such as the spell Sectumsempra.\n\nHowever, during an argument with his sister, Ginny mocked Ron about his inexperience with the opposite gender and told him that Hermione had kissed Viktor Krum during their earlier romance. Ron subsequently began treating Hermione coldly, much to her bewilderment. She was upset when he and Lavender started flirting. When she found out about Ron's relationship with Lavender, she conjured a flock of wild birds to attack Ron for his insensitivity regarding her feelings. He became even angrier with her when she believed that Harry slipped Ron Felix Felicis to assist in his Quidditch-playing abilities; despite having believed it initially himself, he accused her of having no faith in him when it was discovered that he had not been slipped the potion at all.\n\nAfter this, Hermione attended Slughorn's Christmas party with Cormac McLaggen to get back at Ron, but it did not go well due to the former's impoliteness. Afterwards, Ron (who was relieved that Hermione and McLaggen's date did not go well) attempted to speak to Hermione, but she ignored him, still upset and angry over his previous treatment of her.[36] This behaviour persisted for quite sometime.\n\nThe two reconciled after Ron was hospitalised due to consuming poisoned mead, an event that left Hermione shaken and frightened. After the incident she remained unusually quiet and subdued. Whilst sitting at Ron's bedside, Ron subconsciously muttered Hermione's name. By this time, Ron was visibly disillusioned with his relationship with Lavender, who had become possessive of him and called him by the annoying nickname 'Won-Won'. He was also pleased whenever Hermione visited him in the hospital wing.\n\nHe began avoiding Lavender, who soon became suspicious of his relationship with Hermione, ultimately leading to an argument about her. After Lavender saw Ron and Hermione come down alone from the boys' dormitories (Harry was present also, but under the invisibility cloak), she had a fight with Ron and broke up with him. When Ron told Harry and Hermione about breaking up with Lavender, Harry could have sworn he saw Hermione smirk.\n\nAfterwards, Hermione and Ron were more comfortable together, and their relationship improved considerably, although a romantic relationship remained out of their reach. Hermione comforted Ron after he failed his Apparition test because he Splinched half an eyebrow, while he teased her about the instructor's praise for her flawless performance. That year, Hermione also quickly mastered nonverbal magic, the first in her class to do so.\n\nThroughout the year, Hermione and Ron were both sceptical of Harry's theory that Draco Malfoy had been branded with the Dark Mark and was up to something. Moreover, she was confident that Malfoy couldn't have brought any Dark objects into Hogwarts without alerting Filch. These claims were heard by Draco himself, who used these details and Hermione's previous plan of communication to accomplish his own.\n\nNear the end of the school year, Harry's suspicions would be proven right. Malfoy let Death Eaters into the school by means of a pair of vanishing cabinets. One cabinet resided in Borgin and Burkes and the other in the Room of Hidden Things (as it had been presumed broken, but Malfoy managed to fix it). This infiltration of Death Eaters resulted in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. Hermione fought in the battle and remained unscathed thanks to some Felix Felicis.[36] This was a gift from Harry, who had won it in a Potions competition and had a preconceived notion of what was going to happen. He told Hermione, Ron, and Ginny to drink it beforehand in case his worries proved true.\n\nThroughout the school year, Hermione and Ron had been informed of the content of Harry's private lessons with Dumbledore. Through these lessons Harry, and in turn Hermione and Ron, learned about the existence of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes. During the funeral of Albus Dumbledore, who had been killed by Snape in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Hermione was comforted by Ron and cried on his shoulder. Afterwards, Harry told them about his desire to drop out of Hogwarts to hunt Horcruxes, which were the key to defeating Lord Voldemort. Despite his protests, Hermione and Ron promised to forgo their seventh year at Hogwarts in order to assist Harry. Before leaving the school, Hermione was able to Summon books about Horcruxes so as to learn how to destroy the items. She found them in Dumbledore's office, where the late headmaster had kept them after the subject had been banned at Hogwarts.\n\nHermione began planning for her journey with Harry and Ron immediately. Concerned for the safety of her family, she altered her parents' memories to make them think they were Wendell and Monica Wilkins and sent them to hide in Australia, no longer aware of their original identities, the existence of their daughter, or anything she had told them about Harry. She also withdrew all of her savings at her building society account, in event of a need for Muggle money.[10].\n\nHermione then joined the Order of the Phoenix in the operation to remove Harry from 4 Privet Drive before his 17th birthday, taking Polyjuice Potion to become one of the 'seven Potters'. Hermione flew on a Thestral with Kingsley Shacklebolt. The two fought off at least five Death Eaters, possibly killing one, injuring two, and were pursued by Lord Voldemort himself at one point. In time, they arrived safely at The Burrow, where Hermione was immensely relieved to see Harry alive and ran to him and hugged him tight, but she was greatly worried when Ron did not show up on time. When he landed, she ran and nuzzled him in relief. She was saddened by the news of Alastor Moody and Hedwig's murders and disturbed by Harry's vision of Garrick Ollivander being tortured.\n\nLater on, the Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, interrupted Harry's birthday celebrations to execute Albus Dumbledore's will and bequeath some of his belongings to the three friends. Hermione received The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a book of children's stories written in runes. Even before Hermione understood the priceless quality of the gift, she was moved to tears by Dumbledore's great act of friendship. During the reading of Dumbledore's will, she also displayed her incredible store of general knowledge when she mentioned that 'Snitches have flesh memories', surprising both Ron and Harry, who had both believed her to know little to nothing of Quidditch.\n\nAt Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding on 1 August 1997, Hermione wore a 'floaty, lilac-coloured dress with matching high heels' and made her hair 'sleek and shiny'. She was amused by Fred and George's stories about their late uncle Bilius and shared a friendly exchange with Viktor Krum, to the frustration of Ron. She was happily surprised when Ron quickly asked her to dance, and when Krum asked a disguised Harry whether the two were together, Harry replied 'Er... sort of.'[10]\n\nThe wedding was interrupted by Kingsley Shacklebolt's Patronus who told the guests of the fall of the Ministry of Magic. Hermione was prepared to make a quick escape, immediately Disapparating herself, Harry, and Ron away from the danger. Hermione also showed great foresight and magical talent when she revealed a small beaded purse on which she had placed an Undetectable Extension Charm. Within it she had packed, amongst other things, clothing, a tent, healing supplies, Harry's Invisibility Cloak, and several useful books. They arrived on the Muggle street, Tottenham Court Road, where Hermione suggested they enter a café, as a means to get out of the open.\n\nHowever, minutes later Hermione unknowingly triggered the Taboo jinx that was placed on Voldemort's name, and the trio were thus tracked down by Antonin Dolohov and Thorfinn Rowle. After a brief but violent skirmish, the Death Eaters were subdued, and Hermione modified their memories to throw them off the scent and to maintain Ron's cover story that he was sick with spattergroit and bedridden at home. At Harry's suggestion the three then made their way safely to 12 Grimmauld Place, as they could not hide anywhere within the wizarding world.[10]\n\nAfter learning from Mundungus Fletcher that Dolores Umbridge had Tom Riddle's mother's locket - one of the seven Horcruxes - in her possession, the trio formed a plan to infiltrate the Ministry and reclaim the locket. Hermione imbibed Polyjuice Potion and transformed to look like Mafalda Hopkirk, a prominent Ministry official. She was forced to sit through the trials of Alderton and Mary Cattermole, innocent Muggle-borns, right alongside Umbridge and Death Eater Yaxley. Hermione tricked Umbridge into telling her about the locket, which she claimed was a Selwyn family heirloom.\n\nWhen Harry attacked Umbridge in a rage, their cover was blown, but she and Harry managed to free the Muggle-born prisoners and encouraged them to flee the country while Voldemort was in power. Hermione took the locket from Umbridge, replacing it with a copy using the Geminio spell. They met up with Ron again and fled the Ministry, but Yaxley grabbed onto Hermione's arm while they were Disapparating. This meant that he was unwittingly brought inside the enchantment making Grimmauld Place undetectable, and forced Hermione to use a Revulsion Jinx to free herself from him, and then to take the trio away from Grimmauld Place.[10]\n\nThe locket caused great pain among the three friends due to the negative energy within. They began arguing over petty issues such as cooking, and growing moodier. The negative energy from the locket caused Ron to accuse Harry of poor leadership. They fought physically, resulting in Hermione having to stop them before they could start casting spells by casting a Shield Charm between them. Ron also accused Hermione of choosing Harry over him, causing him to be jealous and feel left out by his two friends' growing friendship. He declared he was leaving and stormed out of the tent.\n\nBy the time she got rid of the shield charm, all Hermione could do was scream for him to come back, without success. Hermione then cried over Ron for more than a week after his departure, although she tried to hide it from Harry. Both were deeply saddened and hurt by their friend's departure, Hermione more than Harry, as she cried over Ron's departure for weeks. With Ron gone, Hermione and Harry's evenings were spent in mostly silence, while they contemplated Ron's abandonment and the places Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes might be hidden.\n\nHermione and Harry soon decided to go to Godric's Hollow, to see the graves of Harry's parents and to speak to historian Bathilda Bagshot. They believed Bathilda might be holding onto Godric Gryffindor's Sword for Harry, as they thought Dumbledore might have left it with her as an old family friend, knowing it was the only method the trio knew for destroying a Horcrux. Hermione comforted Harry in the graveyard when they found the Potters' graves; she nuzzled her head in to the crook between his head and shoulders and conjured roses for the graves. On their way out of the graveyard they came into contact with what appeared to be Bathilda.\n\nThe pair then went to Bathilda's house; whilst in the house they were separated. Harry witnessed a giant snake pouring from the neck of Bathilda's body and was attacked by Nagini upstairs. Nagini had been waiting for them in the guise of the old woman, whose corpse had been animated like an Inferius by Voldemort. Hermione rushed to Harry's aid and proceeded to save his life by casting a Blasting Cure, which ricocheted around the room. The two of them barely escaped before Lord Voldemort himself arrived at the cabin in an attempt to capture Harry.\n\nHermione Apparated to the Forest of Dean, while Harry was overcome with pain and visions of Voldemort's attack on his parents and him in 1981. She used a Severing Charm to remove the locket from Harry and healed the bite Nagini had given him with dittany. Harry's wand had also been broken in the foray, most likely by the Blasting Curse Hermione cast at Nagini. Hermione was very upset a the thought that it was her curse that broke Harry's wand. Harry was heartbroken, but not angry with her, knowing that it was an accident and that Hermione had saved his life and therefore could not hold it against her.[10]\n\nRon reunited with Harry and Hermione in the Forest of Dean, after Ron heard them talking through the Deluminator Dumbledore had left him. Ron destroyed the locket Horcrux with Godric Gryffindor's Sword, which had been left by an unknown assistant in a pool in the Forest, saving Harry's life and thus receiving forgiveness from Harry for leaving. Before he destroyed it, however, the locket revealed some of Ron's deepest fears, including that Hermione preferred Harry to him. Hermione, however, was unaware of this, as she had been in the tent while this occurred.\n\nUpon seeing Ron, she screamed at Ron despite Harry trying to tell her that Ron just saved his life, and punched him until Harry cast a shield charm between them with Hermione's wand. She was furious with Ron for days for his abandonment, but gradually warmed up to him again.\n\nThe trio then travelled together to Xenophilius Lovegood's home to ask him about the strange symbol in The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which Xenophilius had worn on a chain around his neck at Bill and Fleur's wedding. They had thought it to be the sign of the Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald after Krum recognised it at the wedding (Grindelwald being a former Durmstrang student), but Xenophilius informed them it was the symbol of the Deathly Hallows. Shortly after making this discovery, Harry realised that Luna wasn't at home, despite it being the Christmas holidays, and had been away for a long time. Xenophilius revealed to them that Luna had been taken prisoner by Death Eaters and that he planned to betray them in order to get her back.\n\nHowever, in attempting to capture them, Xenophilius made the Erumpent horn in his living room (which he had insisted was a Snorkack horn, much to Hermione's annoyance) explode, giving the trio the chance to hide just as Death Eaters Selwyn and Travers arrived. They threatened to kill Luna if they found that Xenophilius had lied about Harry Potter's presence in his home. In a remarkable show of mental and magical dexterity, Hermione concocted the trio's escape while safeguarding Ron's feigned illness and allowing the Death Eaters to glimpse Harry, so that they would not carry out their threat to kill Luna.[10]\n\nIn the spring of 1998, Harry accidentally triggered the Taboo jinx and Hermione, Harry, and Ron were tracked down and captured by a group of Snatchers, which included the werewolf Fenrir Greyback. Greyback had developed cannibalistic tendencies when out of werewolf form and was eager to bite Hermione. After a brief and violent interrogation by the Snatchers, the captives were brought to Malfoy Manor and turned over to Bellatrix Lestrange. Bellatrix immediately panicked at the sight of Godric Gryffindor's Sword and incapacitated the Snatchers with ease, as she was too quick for them. She then ordered them moved to the courtyard where she would deal with them later.\n\nBellatrix gave away that what she believed to be the sword and another Horcrux were hidden in her vault at Gringotts in her panic. She proceeded to isolate Hermione and then brutally torture her with the Cruciatus Curse repeatedly along with taking a dagger and cutting the word Mudblood into her arm as interrogation methods. Ron (who had tried to take her place unsuccessfully) was reduced to sobs from hearing Hermione scream in pain. However, Hermione came up with a fake story that the sword was merely a copy of the real thing; a lie that Harry persuaded the imprisoned goblin Griphook to go along with.\n\nHermione was soon tortured into unconsciousness. With Hermione's moans and screams of pain echoing throughout the manor, Harry and Ron saw no possible hope left. Suddenly, Dobby came to the rescue of the prisoners in the dungeon, with audible crack as he apparated. Harry and Ron fought off Peter Pettigrew, who had been sent to investigate the noise. Harry snarled at him that Pettigrew owed him for Harry's sparing of his life with Lupin and Sirius, and the momentary relaxing of Pettigrew as a result caused him to be choked to death by his own silver hand (created by Voldemort) for showing Harry mercy.\n\nThey raced upstairs and were forced to drop their wands when Bellatrix held a silver knife to Hermione's throat. Bellatrix cut through some skin, leaving a thin cut on the front of Hermione's neck. Right when Bellatrix was about to slit her throat, Dobby returned and sent the chandelier crashing to the floor, knocking Bellatrix over and enabling Harry to grab their wands from Draco and Disapparate with Hermione, Ron, Griphook, and Dobby to Shell Cottage, where Bill and Fleur Weasley took up residence after their marriage. Unfortunately, Dobby was killed during this escape, by a knife Bellatrix threw.\n\nHermione, Harry, and Ron stayed at Shell Cottage for some time, whilst Fleur helped Hermione recover from her trauma. Ron didn't leave Hermione's bedside throughout this time. The trio formed a plan to break into the Lestrange Vault at Gringotts to retrieve the Horcrux Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, with the reluctant assistance of Griphook. The goblin only agreed to help them in exchange for Gryffindor's Sword; although lothe to lose it, Hermione was strongly against deceiving or double-crossing Griphook, who was startled by the care she and Harry had shown for house-elves, since most wizards do not think highly of non-human beings. The trio reluctantly agreed to Griphook's terms.\n\nOnce more, Hermione used Polyjuice Potion, containing Bellatrix's hair. She was also forced to use Bellatrix's wand, as her wand had been confiscated by Snatchers. She very much disliked this, as the wand in question had caused so much suffering, such as contributing to Sirius' murder. She stated that the wand felt wrong and Harry speculated that it was because Hermione had not won the wand's intelligence.\n\nIt was determined that Hermione was 'too polite' to really impersonate Bellatrix, as she did not treat those around her like scum. Despite this, the group managed to get into the vault, mainly because of Harry's use of the Imperius Curse. After many harrowing challenges, and Griphook betraying them out of a belief that they would not have kept to their agreement, Hermione, Ron, and Harry escaped on the back of the half-blind dragon that was guarding the vault, with another Horcrux in their possession.[10]\n\nThe trio finally returned to Hogwarts on 2 May 1998, with the assistance of Aberforth Dumbledore, after Harry had a vision that the remaining Horcrux they had not identified (but suspected was something formerly belonging to Rowena Ravenclaw) was hidden at the school. They were reunited with their friends in the reformed Dumbledore's Army, who declared their wish to fight the encroaching Death Eater army. Whilst Harry and Luna went to Ravenclaw Tower, Hermione and Ron retrieved Basilisk fangs from the Chamber of Secrets in order to use them to destroy Horcruxes, and Hermione destroyed Hufflepuff's Cup.\n\nSoon after reuniting with Harry, Ron expressed concern for the house-elves in the Hogwarts kitchens, prompting Hermione to kiss him for the very first time. Ron responded with great enthusiasm, but they quickly broke apart when Harry reminded them of their objective.\n\nThe trio then entered the Room of Requirement in search for Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem, but were ambushed by Draco Malfoy, Gregory Goyle, and Vincent Crabbe. Hermione dodged a Killing Curse and managed to stun Goyle, and then she and Ron dragged him out of the room on a broomstick as it went up in flames due to Crabbe's cursed Fiendfyre, which also destroyed the Horcrux. Harry rescued Draco, but Crabbe was killed by his creation.\n\nHarry, Hermione and Ron then witnessed the death of Fred Weasley, which devastated them all. Despite their grief, the trio continued with the effort to track down Nagini, the last Horcrux (that they knew of). On their way, Hermione incapacitated two Death Eaters who were pursuing her, Harry and Ron, and blasted Fenrir Greyback away from an injured Lavender Brown. Lavender unfortunately still tragically died afterwards from her injuries.\n\nThe trio was swarmed by Dementors and all had difficulty summoning their Patronuses because of the horror of their recent experiences, but Luna, Ernie Macmillan, and Seamus Finnigan came to their assistance. Under Harry's Invisibility Cloak, the three made their way to the Shrieking Shack, where they witnessed Voldemort have Nagini kill Severus Snape, as he had (ultimately incorrectly) assumed that the Elder Wand's loyalty lay with Snape.\n\nDuring the brief pause in fighting, when Voldemort issued an ultimatum to Harry, Hermione comforted Ginny Weasley over Fred's death. When Voldemort and his army approached with a supposedly dead Harry, Hermione screamed in horror and denial.\n\nThe Battle of Hogwarts soon resumed, and Hermione fought Bellatrix Lestrange alongside Ginny and Luna, despite being hindered by using Bellatrix's own wand against her. When Bellatrix nearly killed Ginny, Molly Weasley took over the fight and killed Bellatrix. Hermione witnessed Harry's final defeat of Lord Voldemort, and she and Ron reached him first, overjoyed. Hermione survived the battle relatively unscathed, only suffering minor injuries and burns she received from entering the Lestranges' Vault shortly before the battle.[10]\n\nAt some point, Hermione found her parents in Australia and restored their memories. In 1998, Hermione went back to Hogwarts to attain her N.E.W.T.s.[37]\n\nDuring the trial of Dolores Umbridge shortly after the war, Umbridge managed to escape and ally with some Death Eaters (Corban Yaxley, the Carrows, and Walden Macnair). Together, they planned a plot involving Time-Turners to bring back the dictatorship that had existed in the British Ministry of Magic from 1997–1998. They were stopped, however, by Hermione, Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley.[38]\n\nAt some point between 2010 and 2011, Hermione travelled to Diagon Alley, where she accidentally bumped into a Hogwarts student, causing both of them to drop their belongings. After the two apologised to each other, Hermione noticed that the spine on one of the student's books was broken, watching as they used the Mending Charm to fix it. Hermione asked if the student was enjoying their time at Hogwarts, which the student confirmed, although they admitted feeling somewhat overwhelmed on account of being Muggle-born. Hermione, herself a Muggle-born witch, reassured the student that they didn't have to learn everything in their first year, before asking them what their favourite class was.\n\nUpon hearing their answer, she explained that Study of Ancient Runes was one of her favourite classes, to which the student, who hadn't previously recognised Hermione, revealed that they had just purchased a copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard newly translated from Ancient Runes by Hermione Granger, noting that the picture of the author looked just like her. Hermione explained that she was indeed the author of the book and thanked them for buying a copy, asking them to send her an owl when they had finished in order to hear their thoughts on it. Hermione then wished the student luck in their studies, asking them to say hello to Neville Longbottom and Rubeus Hagrid for her as well.[33]\n\nOn 19 September, her birthday of a certain year, Hermione went back to Hogwarts in reminiscence. While at Hogwarts she visited the Library, as it was one of her favourite locations within the school. During her school days she spent extensive amounts of time within its walls. While in the library she encountered the same student. She noticed the book they were holding and told her story that involved it.[39]\n\nHermione also came to Hogwarts's aid when the school fell under attack by Dementors and other Dark creatures, and joined the big battle at the end. When it was over, she discussed the possible cause of the attacks with Harry, Ron and the Hogwarts staff, noting that the other creatures couldn't have been swayed by the Dementors to join the attacks, since they were not easily affected by them as humans would be.[40]\n\nWhen Ron Weasley asked Hermione to help him sell joke products and compete against his brother George, who had already invited Harry, she couldn't say no, and so she came to Zonko's Joke Shop when they were having a sale there, though she didn't really care for pranks and found that she was not good at promoting the products with passion. She was having a conversation with Harry in the shop when they met the Muggle-born student, who was surprised to see Hermione was the important guest that Ron claimed to have invited, seeing as she didn't seem to be the kind of person that was interested in joke products. Hermione agreed and talked about her feelings with them, and gave them some tokens to buy products with to save herself from doing her promotion speech.[41]\n\nBy 2017, Hermione and Ron were married with two children: Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley. She had several nieces and nephews through her marriage to Ron. Hermione was also the godmother of Harry and Ginny Potter's eldest child, James Sirius.[42]\n\nHermione attained a high position in the Ministry of Magic, first through the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. There, she continued her work with S.P.E.W., working for the rights of underprivileged non-humans such as house-elves. She tried to get his house elf Gaby to take temporary possession of the Bewildering Bloom after Yubert Thorne was imprisoned, and to send scarves and other items to house elves at Hogwarts through a student friend of hers.[43]She then went on to become Deputy Head[12] of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and assisted the Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt in eradicating the old laws biased in favour of pure-bloods. Along with Harry and Ron, she helped to revolutionise the Ministry and reform the wizarding world. At some point, Hermione, Harry, and Ron were all featured on Chocolate Frog Cards for their accomplishments.[44]\n\nHermione also eventually translated The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the original, which had been written in runes and which Albus Dumbledore bequeathed to her in his will in 1997. Her new translation was published in 2008 and included notes on each tale written by Dumbledore before his death; these notes were lent to Hermione by her former professor, Hogwarts Headmistress Minerva McGonagall.[45]\n\nBoth Hermione and Ron attended the 2014 Quidditch World Cup and sat in VIP Box Two. Rita Skeeter noted that Ron had become catatonic at the appearance of the Bulgarian Veela and Hermione had to elbow him in the ribs.\n\nOn 1 September 2017, Hermione and Ron brought their children to King's Cross Station to see Rose off for her first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and met Harry, Ginny, and their three children there.\n\nAt some point between 2019 and 2020, Hermione was elected as Minister for Magic.[46] In the summer of 2020, Hermione had to visit Harry to ask him to complete his paperwork and the other tasks he was yet to do. She talked about her concerns for recent activity similar to ones which happened when Voldemort was alive. Harry reminded her that he did just find a Time-Turner and he would get round to the rest of the tasks in his own time. They agreed that the Time-Turner should be destroyed and Hermione hid it away.\n\nA few months later, Hermione was returning to her office when she was stopped by Ron, who was really Albus Potter transfigured to look like Ron. Albus was trying to stall her while Scorpius Malfoy and Delphi stole the Time-Turner. Hermione found Ron annoying although he stalled her long enough for the others to find the Time-Turner and they left.\n\nHermione had found out about Harry's nightmares and how his scar was hurting again and she called a meeting. However, no one thought it was a threat.\n\nHermione's life was changed by Albus and Scorpius when they meddled with time. In one alternate reality, she did not marry Ron and became the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. In another alternate reality where Harry died, Hermione was in hiding as a member of what remained of Dumbledore's Army with Ron and Severus Snape. When Scorpius turned up with information about the original timeline where they won, Hermione agreed to help put time right again by time-travelling to the moment Scorpius changed time and use a Shield Charm to stop him. Hermione was the one to use the charm first, but when they returned to the present, it was still changed. They were attacked by Dementors and Hermione and Ron professed their love for each other and sacrificed their souls to the Dementors to give Scorpius time to escape.\n\nWhen time was right again, Hermione visited Hogwarts to attend a meeting with Professor McGonagall. Hermione, along with Ron, Harry, Ginny and Draco were very forgiving of what Albus and Scorpius did, but McGonagall reminded them of great dangers that happened, and could still have been, because they meddled with time.\n\nWhen Albus and Scorpius were kidnapped by Delphi and made to travel in time again to 31 October 1981, Hermione travelled in time again with Ron, Harry, Ginny and Draco Malfoy to save them. Hermione helped transfigure Harry to look like Voldemort to trick Delphi who hopes to save him, and then later helped Harry duel Delphi. She and Draco then apprehended her and took her back to the present where she was sent to Azkaban.\n\nDuring the Calamity, Hermione acted as one of the apparent leading members of the newly-created Statute of Secrecy Task Force and would introduce members who had proven to be qualified to Professions after complimenting on their impressive combination of determination and ability. She would also help the members personally, instructing those who pursued a professorship on the Proficiency Charm after returning from a sojourn overseas while giving Aurors a retrospective regarding her experiences in the Second Wizarding War to help them in fighting Death Eaters.[13]\n\nHermione sent a Calamity Investigator working for the Task Force to reverse the accidental shrinking of several tea shops in Dagenham by George Weasley as a result of testing one of his new joke products, a Tea Snug, a task which they quickly completed. Hermione later gave an impromptu talk about the Calamity at the Leaky Cauldron, which was attended by the same Calamity Investigator. From this talk, the Calamity Investigator learned about the ineffability of the Calamity, from which they figured out a new way to improve their Trace Charm.[13]\n\nHermione later learned that the same Calamity Investigator had discovered a large number of fire-breathing chickens beneath an inn in Brondby, Denmark, and brought them back to the Ministry, as they had recently become a noted wizarding delicacy. Hermione thanked the Calamity Investigator by securing them higher-energy meals at wizarding bed and breakfast inns. She later hosted a practical class on localised casting of the Sunlight Charm, which was attended by the same Calamity Investigator. As part of the class, Hermione demonstrated that the volume of light produced could be modulated with specific wrist motions, which the Calamity Investigator used to improve their use of the Greenhouse Charm. Hermione also presented the same Calamity Investigator with the then-newly-created Green Wand award for their painstaking gathering of greenhouse ingredients every day.[13]\n\nIn the spring of 2021, The Unforgivable threatened Harry Potter and Hermione after the two began wrenching control of Calamity surges away from the cabal. The two feared that their children would be targeted, but Harry insisted on continuing to fight against the Unforgivable. Harry redirected a Calamity surge and controlled it using memories of the Marauders. When Minerva McGonagall was uncharacteristically late in reporting to the SOS Task Force, Constance Pickering, Harry Potter, and Hermione Granger feared she had been attacked. By April, it became apparent that while Minerva was unharmed, Ginny had been attacked and Ron had been abducted.[47]\n\nFollowing their attack on Harry's wife and Hermione's husband, the Unforgivable unleashed a surge of Dragon Adversaries. While this was disastrous, it allowed Harry to tap into somebody's memory of being forced to abduct Ron.[48] Shortly after, the Unforgivable unleashed a surge of Foundables related to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes where Ron worked. While the Unforgivable succeeded in intimidating Harry and Hermione, Harry even enlisted the help of MACUSA in the hopes of finding his best friend, this attack only made Hermione even more determined to bring the cabal to justice.[49] The Unforgivable began a campaign of harassment and manipulation to secure their position preceding negotiations for Ron's returns, including implanting false memories in Molly Weasley of Ron crying and begging her to tell Harry and Hermione to listen to the Unforgivable so that he could return home. Molly instead instructed Hermione to 'give them Hell'.[50]\n\nBy the end of April, the Unforgivable had delivered their list of demands via notes dispatched within Foundables. In exchange for Ron's safe return, they not only wanted full command of the Calamity but for London Five victim Kit Gerrard and the defector informant Flavius Flint to be delivered to them. Hermione decided that she and Constance should use Polyjuice Potion to take the places of Gerrard and Flint as a means to infiltrate the Unforgivable, with Harry delivering them in exchange for Ron. It seemed the Unforgivable were aware of this deception, as well as where the Ministry's defences were weakest, however.\n\nWhilst duelling against members of the cabal, Constance was hit with a Blasting Curse but luckily came away with only mild burns. While Ron was recovering, albeit unconscious, the real Flavius and Kit were taken. When Constance returned from having her injuries healed at St Mungo's, she reported that Ron had woken up and his memories had been completely Obliviated, to the point where he could not even recognise his wife.[48] Hermione wondered if everything, including rescuing Ron, had been part of the cabal's plans all along. She and Harry considered the possibility of a mole in the Ministry or a Legilimens among the Unforgivable's ranks.[50]\n\nIn May 2021, Calamity surges surrounding baby magical creatures created the impression that the Unforgivable were involved in illegal poaching and trading of rare beasts. Fragments of a note apparently from Grim Fawley contained co-ordinates to a location in Cape Town, to where Harry Potter led a team of Aurors in order to stop a potential auction, and to find members of the cabal. Unfortunately, no auction took place, adding weight to the theory of a mole in the Ministry. The return of mountain troll and Acromantula fragments caused Ron Weasley to remember events from his past, though he still could not remember the names of people close to him.[51] Following this, Hermione resorted to drugging various Ministry members with Truth Serum then erasing their memories of being interrogated by her. This method outed Gareth Greengrass as not only the mole but a high ranking member of the Unforgivable.[52]\n\nHermione hoped that the detention of Gareth Greengrass would put a stop to the appearance of Adversaries, however instead the SOS Taskforce was inundated with an unprecedented surge of all known Feared Adversaries over the course of a week (14–21 July 2021). Hermione speculated that perhaps Greengrass was capable of manipulating the Calamity without a wand, though Constance thought it might be that Greengrass was not the one responsible. Hermione also claimed that 'anyone who could bring Darkness like this into the world must be capable of powerful magic'.[53]\n\nFollowing his detention, Gareth Greengrass repeatedly proclaimed innocence and his colleagues in the Department of Mysteries called for his release, even going so far as to accuse Harry and Hermione of using the Imperius Curse to obtain a false confession. As testimony procured under Veritaserum was inadmissible and there was no paper trail or actual evidence of Greengrass's involvement with the Unforgivable, Hermione turned her attention to helping Ron recover his memories of the 1992–1993 school year. During this time, an Auror discovered that Gareth's strange habit of delivering Interdepartmental Memos via owl was part of a ruse. Gareth's owl was a Transfigured potions cabinet containing Polyjuice Potion. When tested, those who imbibed the potions turned into Hermione and the editor-in-chief of the Daily Prophet, linking Gareth Greengrass to the abductions of Ginny and Ron. A complication arose, however, when it became apparent one of the Polyjuice Potions had been tampered with during the month that Gareth was detained. Hermione concluded that this was part of an escape attempt and alerted Harry.[54]\n\nGareth Greengrass was eventually caught out and taken into custody in an official capacity, but remained tight-lipped until Harry rose the issue of Gareth's daughter. It was discovered that Cereus Greengrass suffered a blood malediction. Gareth and Harry formed an Unbreakable Vow, sealed by Constance Pickering, whereby Harry would find a cure for Gareth's daughter and in turn Gareth would help Harry uncover the identities of the Unforgivable. Harry visited St Mungo's and placed a large donation, securing special care for Cereus. By the time he returned, however, Gareth Greengrass was dead. During these events, Hermione contemplated the likelihood of Gareth hiding information in their conversations, and concluded that Penelope Fawley might be trapped in an image much like Kit Gerrard had been. She went to check a photograph of Grim and Penelope that was on Gareth's desk, only to find it had gone missing. A mysterious male figure was implicated but not identified.[55]\n\nHermione had a light complexion, bright brown eyes, lots of bushy brown hair (once described as a 'long mane of brown hair'),[36] and — as a child — rather large front teeth.[15][16] She possessed a 'bossy sort of voice' that would become slightly shrill when she was angry.[32]\n\nHermione generally wore plain black work robes. Otherwise, she dressed casually. She usually kept her hair long and sometimes tied it back in a plait.[10] Hermione never gave much attention to her appearance, usually hiding her potential to be considered extremely pretty under her bushy hairstyle and a large pile of books, which she kept slung on her back.[3]\n\nIn 1994, after Hermione was accidentally struck with a Densaugeo spell, Madam Pomfrey magically shrank her front teeth and told Hermione to alert her when her teeth had returned to their original size. Hermione deviously let the spell continue a little longer, evening them out and making it unnecessary for her to receive the braces that her parents — both dentists — had originally intended for her. Hermione later confessed that she had previously considered fixing her teeth with magic but resisted out of respect for her parents.\n\nDuring the Yule Ball, Hermione revealed that when she put her mind to it, she could look quite pretty — she used Sleekeazy's Hair Potion to fix her hair, making it sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head. She wore robes made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she held herself differently. Harry himself failed to recognise her initially, and was shocked when he did, for she didn't look at all like her usual self. Even Pansy Parkinson gaped at Hermione when she saw her, and Draco seemed unable to find an insult to throw at her.[35] A similar transformation was seen during the wedding of Bill and Fleur — her hair was again 'sleek and shiny', and she wore a floaty, lilac-coloured dress with matching high heels.\n\nHermione was noted for both her exceptional work ethic and insatiable curiosity, coming out on top in most of her classes and continuously aiding Harry and Ron in their adventures. She was so studious that the Ministry allowed her a Time-Turner in her third year, a device that rewinds time so that she could take extra courses.[34] Because of her efficiency and compassion, Hermione often had time to do hobby work on the side, such as preparing a defence for Buckbeak to save him from execution and creating S.P.E.W., an organisation promoting the freedom of house-elves.[35] Such acts demonstrated her social conscience and tenacity.\n\nUnlike most wizards who depended solely on their magical ability, Hermione readily relied on logic, which often helped her to cleverly deduce information that many others missed, such as Remus Lupin's lycanthropy.[34] However, her emphasis on logic made her sceptical about accepting anything without proof, as opposed to Harry who would come to intuitive conclusions, such as completely dismissing the idea of the Deathly Hallows, refusing to believe in them without physical evidence.[10] Hermione's logic had limits, putting her beliefs before all else at the same time in a way that made her ignore reality when it contradicted what she believed, no matter how strong or overwhelming the evidence was.\n\nAn example of this was the reality of the house-elves, she insisted that they wanted to be free, have wages and only seemed happy because they were under educated and brainwashed when her friends told her that they like their lot in life even after the elves themselves told her they were happy and didn't want her help because they don't usually think the way humans do.[35] Even though Hermione knew a lot about the wizarding world, she was not well informed about the children's culture of the wizarding world until Albus Dumbledore gave her his copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, as she grew up in a Muggle household and did not know she was a witch until her pre-teens.[10]\n\nHermione was quite blunt with her opinions, sometimes to the point of being tactless. For example, her attempt to comfort Lavender Brown about the death of her rabbit did not go over well,[34] and her honesty when dealing with centaurs in 1996 nearly landed her and Harry in serious trouble.[32] Despite this, Hermione was generally sensitive to others' emotions and would lie when she had to, though she wasn't a skilled liar.[32] She also gave her friends advice rather often, such as in trying to make Harry understand Cho Chang's behaviour on their date,[32] and in helping Ginny deal with her crush on Harry.[36] These actions once prompted Ron to advise her to write a book to translate all the 'mad things' girls do so that boys could understand them.[32]\n\nHermione was very responsible, a strict perfectionist and well put-together who often attempted to act as the voice of reason among her more impulsive friends, to varying levels of success. These traits led to her being made a prefect during her fifth year. Throughout her entire school career, Hermione was insistent on order and steadfastly devoted to the rules, often at the expense of her popularity. Her sense of humour was limited, frequently expressing disapproval over Fred and George's practical jokes and threatened to put them in detention for selling prank items in the common room.\n\nHermione was very determined and focused, in that she 'always [kept] her attention focused on the job that must be done'.[56] Her refusal to break under torture shows her strength of willpower.[10] She wasn't afraid to stand up to her friends when she thought it was in their best interests, or when she felt they were wrong; risking to anger Harry by getting his Firebolt confiscated because she feared it might be jinxed,[34] and arguing with both him and Ginny over his use of the shady Half Blood Prince's textbook.[36]\n\nIn spite of her strait-laced disposition, she wasn't above using coercion and threats to get what she wanted, achieve results or protect herself and those she cared about in the long run. This is evidenced by her blackmailing Rita Skeeter into writing a good article about Harry,[4] as well as slapping Draco Malfoy when he insulted Hagrid and drawing her wand on him, using a Confundus Charm on Cormac McLaggen for insulting her friends and placing a jinx on the list of DA members that would cause them to sprout boils all over their face in the word 'SNEAK' if they betrayed the organisation. Malfoy, Rita Skeeter and Marietta Edgecombe all served as examples of Hermione's ferocity.\n\nBecause of her opinionated, interfering nature, Hermione had the reputation for being a bossy know-it-all. Her sometimes abrasive attitude masked deep insecurities and fear of failure, as personified by her Boggart.[57] She felt the need to prove herself, perhaps partly because of how many people in wizarding society looked down on Muggle-borns. However, she didn't let anyone bully her about this and ignored bigots like Draco Malfoy. Despite her growing confidence in her abilities, Hermione wasn't arrogant or conceited, and helped her classmates with their schoolwork whenever she could. In her fifth year, she also became one of the few people to call Voldemort by name.[32]\n\nThough she initially showed a tendency toward mild panic in sudden situations,[3] in time she was able to overcome this trait of hers, and demonstrated her bravery and extreme loyalty to her friends many times when facing danger, risking her life frequently to help them and standing by Harry even when no one else did. Although she wasn't as short-tempered as her friends, Hermione displayed a formidable fury on several occasions, such as slapping Draco Malfoy in defence of Hagrid,[34] sabotaging Cormac McLaggen's tryout as a Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team after he insulted Ron and Ginny, conjuring a flock of canaries to attack Ron in their sixth year[36] and physically attacking him when he briefly abandoned her and Harry during their hunt for Horcruxes.[10] She also tended to be rather argumentative, a trait most evident in her interactions with Ron.\n\nHermione proved to be an extremely powerful and talented young witch. Even before she began her education at Hogwarts, she practised some simple spells which all worked.[3] Remus Lupin claimed that Hermione was the cleverest witch of her age he had ever met.[34] Her magical capability easily surpassed almost every single student in her year, challenged only by a select few.\n\nMr and Mrs Granger were Muggle dentists who seemed proud of their witch daughter. They appeared to be accepting of the wizarding world, as they went shopping with Hermione in Diagon Alley and allowed her to spend several holidays with the Weasley family,[4] but did not approve of their daughter using magic as a quick-fix, as indicated by their not allowing Hermione to magically fix her teeth.[35] They correspond by owl post with their daughter throughout the school year,[32] but other than one holiday in France with her parents, Hermione spent almost all of her time in the wizarding world. In 1995, she planned to go skiing with them during the Christmas holidays, but ended up going to 12 Grimmauld Place to try to cheer Harry up instead. Hermione told her parents that the reason for her cancelling was to study for exams, indicating that her parents expected her to do well in school and were probably not aware of the extent of their daughter's involvement in activities relating to the Second Wizarding War.[32]\n\nTo protect them during the height of the war, Hermione modified her parents' memories in 1997 to make them believe they were entirely different people, and they left the country.[10] After the war, she found them in Australia and restored their memories.\n\nAfter the Second Wizarding War, Hermione had two children with Ron Weasley: a daughter named Rose and a son named Hugo.\n\nRose started her first year at Hogwarts in 2017, along with her cousin, Albus. Ron stated that Rose had inherited her mother's brains. Hermione was probably very close to Rose because she was also described as smart, yet not a complete know-it-all.\n\nHugo was born in 2006 or 2007. He most likely inherited his father's Quidditch skills, as he was noted to fly a lot with his cousins Albus Potter and James Potter. He also appeared to have a quiet demeanour.\n\nAs four of Ron Weasley's five surviving siblings were married by 2017, Hermione had quite a few nieces and nephews through her husband: Harry and Ginny had three children (James, Albus and Lily), as did Bill and Fleur (Victoire, Dominique and Louis), while George and Angelina Johnson had a son and a daughter (Fred and Roxanne), and Percy Weasley had two daughters (Molly and Lucy) with his wife, Audrey. Victoire Weasley, one of Fleur and Bill's daughters, was seen kissing Teddy Lupin at King's Cross Station, by James Potter, Hermione's nephew and godson. Hermione visited them all on many occasions. It can be assumed that she was closest with Harry's children.\n\nBecause of her friendships with Ron and Ginny Weasley, Hermione became friendly with the entire Weasley family. She spent a portion of many of her summer holidays at their home of The Burrow, and attended some family outings with them, such as shopping for school supplies in Diagon Alley and attending the 1994 Quidditch World Cup with them. Arthur Weasley was fascinated by the Muggle world and thus Hermione's background, and even invited Hermione's parents for a drink upon first meeting them. Molly Weasley was fond of Hermione, though she treated her coldly for a brief time after Rita Skeeter printed lies about Hermione toying with the hearts of Harry Potter and Viktor Krum, much to Hermione's bewilderment. After Harry explained that the stories were false, Mrs Weasley once again warmed up to Hermione. Also, she and Percy Weasley were considered to be on good terms until their fight over elf rights.\n\nFred and George Weasley seemed to regard Hermione and Harry almost like other younger siblings, teasing them as well as being protective of them. When Draco Malfoy called Hermione a 'Mudblood' in 1992, the twins were outraged, and attempted to attack him.[4] Although Hermione disapproved of some of their antics, trying to use her status as a prefect to keep them in line, she still got on well with them. Hermione once argued with them that the Ageing Potion they planned on using to trick the age line protecting the Goblet of Fire wouldn't work because Dumbledore would have already thought of a foolish ageing potion. They didn't listen and tried to cross the line which resulted in them being thrown back and grow long, white beards.The only time she was notably angry with them was when they tested out their Skiving Snackboxes on unsuspecting first year students; though the twins initially scoffed at her concerns and her ability to make them stop, they backed down when she threatened to tell their mother.\n\nHowever, Hermione still admired the cleverness and creativity of their spell work,[32] once remarking that they could do some 'extraordinary magic,' which Fred was flattered enough by to offer Hermione material from their joke shop free of charge.[36] Fred and George also tried to get Hermione to relax, joking around with her about things such as their late uncle Bilius's penchant for making mischief at weddings.[10] Hermione was devastated when Fred was killed during the Battle of Hogwarts. Hermione was not as close to the other Weasley siblings, though she was invited to Bill's wedding to Fleur Delacour in 1997.\n\nWith her marriage to Ron, Hermione became a part of the Weasley family herself.\n\nWhen Hermione first met Fleur Delacour, an incredibly beautiful, French, part-Veela witch, in 1994, during the Triwizard Tournament. Hermione disliked Fleur almost immediately, as she was given to fussily and loudly criticising nearly everything at Hogwarts, from the weather, to the decoration and food. The fact that Ron had a little bit of a crush on Fleur didn't help, but he eventually got over it.\n\nHermione, like Ginny and Mrs Weasley, was infuriated by Fleur's arrogance and constant complaining when Bill Weasley sent Fleur, his then fiancée, to The Burrow to get to know his family. However, when Fleur responded to Bill becoming permanently disfigured by Fenrir Greyback with indignant denial that Bill's appearance would in any way effect their marital plans, Hermione most likely set her feelings aside.\n\nDespite seeming rather inconsiderate and self-centred, Fleur proved to be courageous and ultimately caring, even selfless, in her own way. She put her life in danger by posing as one of Harry's decoys in the Battle of the Seven Potters, and after the Battle of Malfoy Manor, Hermione, Harry and Ron, along with Luna Lovegood, Dean Thomas, and an injured Garrick Ollivander and Griphook, stayed with Bill and Fleur for a month at Shell Cottage, where Fleur took care of them all like a mother. Later, Fleur became Hermione's sister-in-law through her marriage to Bill Weasley, and Hermione's marriage to Ron Weasley.\n\nRonald Weasley was, essentially, the love of Hermione's life. Although their relationship would have many ups and downs, Hermione and Ron Weasley were good friends for most of their years at Hogwarts, and of course, were best friends with Harry Potter, who was usually a mediator in their disputes. They tended to argue frequently, though they usually got over their arguments, which tended to be minor or about trivial issues, although there were a few times when it seemed as if their friendship would be irreparable. As they grew older and matured, Ron and Hermione tended to fight less often and become more in touch with their feelings for each other. Hermione sometimes had the tendency of calling Ron 'Ronald'. Their first major falling-out was in their third year, when Ron accused Hermione's pet cat Crookshanks of eating his pet rat Scabbers.[34]\n\nHints of her feelings for Ron were shown as early as their first year, when she was badly hurt emotionally when he made fun of her for not having friends due to her bookish and bossy nature. According to Neville she spent the whole afternoon crying in the loo before the incident with the troll took place. In their third year Ron saw Sirius Black standing over him with a knife, Hermione was shocked and scared the most and even cried. They were both very awkward and embarrassed at times, being insecure with their own feelings for each other. Ron was used to always being in Harry's shadow and did not want the girl he loved to be also taken from him by his best friend. Hermione was greatly offended when Ron initially didn't ask her to the Yule Ball as his partner until he got rejected by Fleur Delacour. When it is revealed Viktor Krum was Hermione's date, a jealous Ron got into a heated row with Hermione, which she ended by making clear that she would go as Ron's date in future if only he asked her as his first choice. Ron and Hermione's relationship again suffered when Ron began dating Lavender Brown in 1996, though the two reconciled after Ron was accidentally poisoned, leaving Hermione shaken. Ron's relationship with Lavender ended soon after, and both he and Hermione were more content for it.[36]\n\nHints of romantic feelings between the two could be seen as early as their second year, as Ron was particularly protective of Hermione and disgusted by her crush on Gilderoy Lockhart. Also During the second year when Malfoy insulted Hermione calling her a mudblood an enraged Ron attempted to punish him with a curse, but as his wand was broken, the curse backfired on him injuring him.[4] During the Yule Ball in 1994, Hermione was affronted by Ron's clumsy attempt to ask her to go with him, and Ron was jealous of her attendance with Viktor Krum; this jealousy would persist for years. In turn, Hermione was jealous of Ron's crush on Fleur Delacour, though expressed it in a subtler way.\n\nIn her fourth year while Harry and Ron were not in speaking terms following Harry's name coming out of the goblet of fire, Hermione defended Ron to Harry reminding him that despite him not wanting it he always gets all the attention while Ron had to live up competing with his five older brothers and Ron is always made to feel second to him.\n\nIn their fifth year, Hermione kissed Ron on the cheek before the Quidditch Tournament, to which he reacted by being 'puzzled' and touching the spot where she kissed him. During Gryffindor's Quidditch try-outs in their sixth year, Hermione also Confunded Cormac McLaggen to increase Ron's chances of being made the team's Keeper. Also, Hermione became jealous (but she tried to conceal it) when Ron began dating Lavender Brown and kissing her frequently.\n\nBy the summer of 1997, the two were closer than ever and 'sort of' together, according to Harry. They danced together at Bill and Fleur's wedding, and were generally kinder to one another. During the hunt for the Horcruxes, Ron comforted Hermione several times by putting his arm around her, and Harry believed that they might have fallen asleep holding hands. When Harry was briefly shouting at Hermione who was confronting him about his fallout with Remus Lupin, Ron defended Hermione from Harry by angrily saying ''Don't you start on her!' Hermione was extremely upset when Ron temporarily left her and Harry, crying often, and she was absolutely furious with him when he returned. It was also revealed, through a vision caused by the locket Horcrux, that one of Ron's deepest fears was that Hermione preferred Harry to him.\n\nThe two eventually made up, and Hermione initiated a kiss during the Battle of Hogwarts, when Ron suggested saving the house-elves and not ordering them to fight for wizards. Hermione, who had been a promoter of house-elf rights since her fourth year and even started her own society to help house-elves (the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare) was so delighted at Ron's unexpected display of sensitivity that she kissed him on the lips, something that was met with surprise, eagerness and enthusiasm, but caused the pair to become embarrassed after Harry asked them to 'hold it in'.\n\nSome people had expected Ron and Hermione to become more than friends much sooner and Harry Potter had even thought that they would start dating in their sixth year. In the fifth year while Hermione and Harry were arguing about Harry's decision to talk to Sirius, Hermione asked Ron's advice in a manner that 'reminded irresistibly of Mrs Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry's first dinner in Grimmauld Place.' In 1997, when the Trio was captured by Snatchers and brought to Malfoy Manor, Fenrir Greyback mistakenly called Ron Hermione's boyfriend when she tried to protect him. Also, Ron screamed and yelled and was in terrible distress when he heard Hermione being tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange in Malfoy Manor. The pair eventually married and had two children, Rose and Hugo Weasley.[10]\n\nThey were rather young when they were married, and their relationship evolved over time. By the time that Hermione was elected Minister For Magic, Ron had become more the stay-at-home-dad due to the convenience it placed on their respective careers, as Ron's entrepreneurial exploits could be more easily conducted than Hermione's careers in law enforcement and eventually politics. Their combative relationship eventually subsided for a more affectionate one, as Ron was seen to kiss Hermione in public extremely often as noted by their nephew, Albus Potter. Hermione was initially wary when Ron spoke of how early they had married and was jokingly suspicious that he wanted a break from their marriage, but was deeply moved when Ron told her that he wanted to renew their vows and marry her all over again after reading about how Muggles occasionally did such a thing. Hermione was so touched by her husband's suggestion that they began to kiss passionately over her mountain of paperwork in her office. This shows how Ron had matured into a startling romantic over the years and how it helped to temper their initially rocky relationship that begun 31 years prior.\n\nViktor Krum, a renowned professional Quidditch player and student of Durmstrang, came to Hogwarts in 1994 for the Triwizard Tournament, in which he was a Champion. He took to following Hermione into the library, watching her and trying to 'pluck up the courage' to speak to her. Eventually, he asked her to be his date to the Yule Ball, and Hermione accepted. Their arrival together caused something of a stir, given Viktor's fame and Hermione's exceptional, and rather unexpected, beauty.\n\nHermione was Viktor's 'hostage' during the Second Task of the Tournament. After he pulled her from the lake, Viktor told Hermione that he had never felt about someone the way he felt about her, and invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer.[35] At some point, it is alleged by Ginny Weasley during a confrontation with her brother Ron, that he and Hermione shared a kiss during that period.[36] Whether or not Ginny was just trying to get under Ron's skin or if this actually happened is unknown. What is known is that their relationship never became serious enough for her to visit him in Bulgaria, they kept in contact through letters over the years.[32] They met again at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour in 1997, where Viktor complimented Hermione and was disappointed to learn that she had 'sort of' begun a romance with Ron Weasley.[10]\n\nHermione became friends with Harry Potter after they as well as Ron Weasley took down a Mountain Troll together in their first year.[3] They tended to get along very well on a day-to-day basis, though Harry occasionally became annoyed by Hermione's nagging, while she occasionally became annoyed by his lack of discipline and conviction in his schoolwork. Their only notable row was over Hermione getting Harry's Firebolt confiscated in their third year, which she felt it might be a trap. Harry and Ron reconciled with Hermione after Hagrid scolded them for their treatment of her. Harry and Hermione were quite similar in their dour, brooding tendencies in times of trouble, and often needed Ron's humour and levity to counterbalance their intense personalities.\n\nHarry, Hermione, and Ron spent nearly all their time together during their years at Hogwarts, and shortly afterwards, Hermione led Harry through time-travel, and together they rescued Sirius Black and Buckbeak; Hermione breaking the rules of using her Time-Turner, something she admitted was incredibly dangerous, demonstrated the strength of her friendship with Harry.[34] The following year, Hermione was the only student who believed Harry when he told her he had not put his name in the Goblet of Fire, and spent much of the Triwizard Tournament teaching Harry useful spells and trying to reconcile him and Ron.[35]\n\nWhile Harry and Hermione typically argued less than Ron and Hermione, they had the most philosophical and moral disagreements with one another. Ron typically deferred to Harry's opinions on important decisions, and tends to hold back when Hermione confronts Harry about them, letting them battle it out. For example, Harry and Hermione fought about how best to deal with Dolores Umbridge when she infiltrated Hogwarts, whether or not Sirius's judgement could be trusted, whether or not Harry should have tried to use Occlumency to block out his mental link with Voldemort, whether Dumbledore's past made him an unworthy leader, and whether they should have pursued the Hallows or the Horcruxes. Hermione expressed immense displeasure to Harry during the sixth year after he started obtaining better results than her at Potion by the help of the 'Half Blood Prince's potions book'. Harry tended to be dismissive of Hermione's opinions, and could even grow angry when she tried to argue her point, but many times realised later that she was right. For example, Harry was often dismissive of Hermione's insistence that all house-elves deserve respect and kindness, and was neglectful towards Kreacher because of his bigotry until he finally realised the horrifying nature of his enslavement.\n\nWhile Harry tended to have more fun with Ron, Hermione was consistently his place of refuge when others abandoned him, from Ron's jealous withdrawal during the Triwizard Tournament, to Harry's discovery of Dumbledore's past during the war. Despite their differences, Harry and Hermione tended to support one another at the expense of others when necessary. Hermione repeatedly chose to help and support Harry in his fight against Voldemort, regardless of personal cost. Examples include breaking the laws regarding time travel in order to help him save Sirius, teaching him defensive magic in preparation for the Triwizard Tournament, blackmailing Rita Skeeter in order to give him a way to tell the public about Voldemort's return, protecting him from torture by Dolores Umbridge, and Obliviating her parents in order to go on the run with him. She notably chose to support him even when Ron did not. Smaller acts of friendship included helping him with homework and cheering him on at Quidditch games.\n\nHarry was similarly protective and supportive of Hermione. Much like Hermione, Harry was often a place of refuge for Hermione when others leave her. Harry often comforted Hermione and showed her kindness and care when she was upset. On the occasion that Buckbeak the Hippogriff was executed, Harry consoled her as she cries.\n\nHe was also quick to defend Hermione from Cho Chang, Draco Malfoy, and others who insulted her for her looks or parentage, which showed his pride in her intellect on numerous occasions. He consistently praised her intelligence and magical skills to teachers, asked her for help in dangerous situations, and defended her against bullies. On one occasion, he even choose to side with her over Ron when he was dating Lavender. But he expressed outrage when Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen.\n\nHarry also defended Hermione physically on instinct. This showed his willingness to put her before himself as well as his unconditional brotherly love for her. For example, when Lupin turned into a werewolf and attacked Hermione and Harry in 1994, Harry shielded her from the danger.\n\nMany people, including Ron, Cho Chang, Viktor Krum, Mrs Weasley, have occasionally mistaken Harry and Hermione's relationship to be a romantic one, given their closeness and expressions of physical affection, such as kisses on the cheek, staying by one another's bedsides when hurt or injured, embracing each other, and holding hands.[35][75] Harry eventually explained to Ron that he and Hermione were like brother and sister.[10] They shared similar upbringings as being only children raised in the Muggle world, and showed each other unconditional love despite their many differences and disagreements. During their time alone during the war, Ron and Harry maintained a distance, with Hermione mostly crying for Ron and Harry observing Ginny's dot at the Marauder's map. They did exchange a comforting moment during their brief embrace after Harry visited his parent's grave.[76]\n\nHermione and Harry remained best friends into adulthood, and eventually became co-siblings in-law when Hermione married Ron Weasley and Harry married Ginny Weasley. Hermione was also the aunt and godmother of Harry's three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus and Lily Luna. They were also coworkers for many years as employees of the Ministry of Magic in law enforcement.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Albus Dumbledore's final plan to defeat Lord Voldemort, in which Harry would learn the story of the Deathly Hallows in time to use them against Voldemort, revolved not only around Harry himself, but Hermione as well. Dumbledore knew that Harry was too passionate and angry to be able to keep from attempting to become Master of Death, and so entrusted The Tales of Beedle the Bard to Hermione, so that she would learn of the Hallows' symbol first and would be able to caution and guide Harry down the path of reason.\n\nGinny Weasley was Hermione's best female friend and Ginny's confidante. The two grew close when Hermione stayed in Ginny's room at The Burrow during her many summertime visits. Ginny was the only one Hermione told about being asked to the Yule Ball by Viktor Krum,[35] while Hermione was the only one who knew that Ginny had been learning to fly in secret for years.[32] She also gave Ginny advice about dealing with her feelings for Harry — advice that eventually led to the two dating,[36] and eventually marrying.\n\nHermione comforted Ginny after an encounter with Dementors upset her in 1993,[34] and after the death of her brother Fred in 1998.[10] However, Hermione would not have been afraid to stand up to Ginny when she felt that Ginny was wrong. The two remained very close after the war and eventually became sisters-in-law when Hermione married Ron, making her an aunt to Ginny's three children, James, Albus, and Lily, as well as being chosen to be godmother to Ginny's eldest son James, and making Ginny Rose and Hugo's aunt and almost certainly Rose's godmother.\n\nHermione was good friends with Neville Longbottom. They met on the train to Hogwarts during their first year and she helped him search for his toad Trevor.[3] Hermione helped Neville many times with their school work, particularly with Potions, as Professor Snape noted that she was often 'hissing instructions in his ear.'[34] In their fourth year, Hermione noticed Neville's horrified reaction to witnessing the Cruciatus Curse be performed on a spider by Professor Alastor Moody (actually Barty Crouch Jnr), and shrieked for the teacher to stop. That same year, Neville asked Hermione to attend the Yule Ball with him, as she had 'always been really nice' to him, though she had already agreed to accompany Viktor Krum.[35]\n\nHermione often fiercely defended Neville when others insulted him, and her friendship and support, as well as that of other D.A. members, likely contributed to Neville gradually gaining self-confidence and courage.[10] Neville was obviously very fond of Hermione, and appreciative of her kindness and all the help she had given him. It was hinted that he spoke of her frequently to his grandmother, Augusta Longbottom, who seemed to already know a good deal about Hermione when they first met at Saint Mungo's in 1995. Following the war, they kept in touch.\n\nAlthough Hermione rarely saw eye-to-eye with Luna Lovegood due to their very different world views and beliefs, the two became very good friends through Dumbledore's Army. Hermione first met Luna on the Hogwarts Express in 1995; she insulted The Quibbler, but backtracked when Luna told her that her father was the editor. Hermione was frustrated with Luna's belief in all manner of things without proof or logical grounds, but eventually simply accepted their differences, telling Luna that her planned trip to Sweden in search of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack sounded 'lovely'.[32]\n\nThe following year, Luna comforted Hermione when she was upset over her fight with Ron.[36] Hermione was one of the five portraits Luna painted — along with Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Neville — and hung from her bedroom ceiling, the word 'friends' linking them in gold writing. When Xenophilius Lovegood attempted to turn Harry, Ron, and Hermione over to Death Eaters in exchange for his daughter's safety, Hermione engineered their escape so that the Death Eaters saw Harry briefly, thus ensuring that both Luna and her father were not harmed. Despite disagreeing with Luna on many things herself, Hermione defended her when others insulted her; for example, she tried to kick Ron for teasing Luna about Gurdyroots at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour, and snapped at the portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black for calling Luna an oddity. The two girls remained close friends in adulthood and saw each other regularly. Luna may be one of the best female friends of Hermione (along with Ginny), as she was only seen with these girls during her school-time at Hogwarts.[10]\n\nHermione first learned about Sirius Black in 1993, when he escaped Azkaban. The wizarding world at large knew of him as the wizard who murdered twelve Muggles and a wizard (Peter Pettigrew) with a single curse. Very few knew of his affiliation with the Potters and those who did also believed that Sirius had betrayed James and Lily Potter to Voldemort by revealing their location at Godric's Hollow. During the events at Hogwarts in 1993, Hermione along with Harry, Ron and Lupin discovered that, contrary to their previous beliefs, Sirius Black had never committed the murders for which he had been incarcerated, nor had he betrayed his closest friends.\n\nThe trio managed to save Sirius and Lupin from being subjected to the Dementor's Kiss at the hands of Severus Snape by firing three simultaneous Disarming Charms at him. Snape was blasted off his feet and knocked unconscious, allowing Harry, Ron and Hermione to continue their interrogation of Sirius who later revealed that Pettigrew had disguised himself in his rat Animagus form for twelve years in order to escape justice and the wrath of Voldemort's remaining Death Eaters. However, upon exiting the Whomping Willow's secret passageway together, Pettigrew shrewdly used Lupin's werewolf transformation as a distraction and escaped. Sirius was soon apprehended and locked in Filius Flitwick's office to await the Dementor's Kiss. Harry and Hermione would later use the latter's Time-Turner to rescue Sirius, who became deeply grateful to both of them.\n\nIn 1994, Hermione, Harry, and Ron visited Sirius at the cave off Hogsmeade village he was hiding in, bringing him food. Here they discussed the many mysteries that had occurred during that year, the trio learning valuable pieces of information regarding the imprisonment of Barty Crouch Jnr After the events of the Third Task, Sirius (while in his Animagus form) joined Hermione, Ron and Molly Weasley at Harry's bedside, each indicating their affections for the latter.\n\nHermione and Sirius would not meet again until the summer of 1995, at the Headquarters of the second Order of the Phoenix. Sirius was obliged to remain in 12 Grimmauld Place for his own safety (his innocence not yet recognised by the Ministry). Sirius was rather disappointed when Harry was allowed to return to Hogwarts, Hermione pointing out that he had probably been secretly wishing that Harry had been expelled from school so that they could both stay at Grimmauld Place and be 'outcasts together'. Hermione expressed an even deeper understanding of Sirius's emotions when she stated her opinion to Harry that Sirius was attempting to relive his happier school days through his godson. Harry ignored this and became slightly agitated at the suggestion that Sirius might be guilty of such a crude, selfish mentality. However, she severely disapproved of his indifferent and occasionally cruel treatment of his house-elf, Kreacher, despite the fact that Kreacher initially appeared to be disgusted by her and addressed her as 'the Mudblood' (which Hermione often attributed to Kreacher being senile due to his old age.)\n\nShe also thought that Sirius was attempting to live vicariously through her, Harry and Ron when he encouraged them to form Dumbledore's Army, but the two boys became angry and snapped at her when she expressed this belief. Sirius was eventually killed by Bellatrix Lestrange in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, much to the dismay of his friends and loved ones. Hermione was devastated by his death, and often tried to provide comfort to Harry, who had been even more deeply affected by the tragedy. At the end of the Second Wizarding War, Hermione became godmother to Harry's eldest son, James Sirius, whose first and middle name was derived from James Potter and Sirius Black respectively.\n\nCrookshanks was Hermione's large, bandy-legged, half-Kneazle, ginger-coloured pet cat since she bought him from the Magical Menagerie in Diagon Alley, in 1993. She seemed to think he was gorgeous, although no one else had wanted to buy him when he was still being sold at the Menagerie. She was proud of his cleverness. The latter proved to be quite true during the 1993–1994 school year.[34]\n\nCrookshanks recognised that Hermione had left him at The Burrow before Bill and Fleur's wedding in 1997,[10] most likely had been left in care of Mrs Weasley or Ginny, but it is possible that they were reunited after the Second War given the deep care and affection they had for each other.\n\nHermione's roommates at Hogwarts were fellow Gryffindors Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil as well as Fay Dunbar and another girl. While Lavender and Parvati swiftly became best friends, Hermione was not very close to either of them. Although the girls did not dislike each other, they had very different interests and sometimes clashed as a result.\n\nFor example, Hermione scorned Divination, Lavender and Parvati's favourite subject, and accidentally upset Lavender with her clumsy attempt to comfort her over the death of her rabbit.[34] Hermione was also angry with Lavender for doubting Harry Potter's assertion that Lord Voldemort had returned in 1995 and snapped at her about it.\n\nWhen Lavender began dating Ron Weasley, she was very upset and confided in Harry about her feelings. Once they broke up however, Hermione chose to not display open affection towards Ron so Lavender's feelings would not get hurt. She also came to Lavender's rescue during the Battle of Hogwarts, blasting Fenrir Greyback away from her.[10] Unfortunately Lavender was mortally wounded by Greyback and was already dead by the time Hermione reached her. It can be assumed that Hermione was at least saddened by Lavenders death.\n\nHermione had a less tumultuous relationship with Parvati, although the two were not close. During Hermione's first year at Hogwarts, she hugged Parvati after Harry caught the Snitch at a Quidditch game. Parvati was noted to feel guilty after laughing at Ron's cruel teasing of Hermione in Transfiguration, and the two discussed Hermione's attendance of the Slug Club Christmas party with Cormac McLaggen. As Parvati looked 'positively agog' at Hermione confiding in her,[36] it can be assumed that Hermione seldom discussed personal matters with her room mates.\n\nCormac McLaggen was a Gryffindor student one year above Hermione. The two became acquainted in 1996 through the Slug Club, of which they were both members, though Hermione did not think highly of McLaggen. When she overheard him insulting Ron and Ginny during Quidditch try-outs, Hermione struck him with the Confundus Charm, undermining his abilities as a Keeper.\n\nLater in the year, when Hermione was furious with Ron for dating Lavender Brown, she decided to attend Professor Slughorn's Christmas party with McLaggen because she knew Ron despised him. McLaggen was apparently interested in Hermione, as he escorted her to the party and was very forward with her romantically while there. This, as well as his tendency to boast about himself, put Hermione off, and she soon abandoned him for the company of Harry and Luna before leaving the party altogether to avoid him.[36] It can be assumed that the party was the end of their interaction.\n\nHermione had a two sided history with Cho; while Hermione offered Harry advice for making his relationship with Cho successful, Cho thought that Hermione's friendship with Harry was romantic and got increasingly jealous of her since Harry spends so much time with her. Hermione has no grudges for Cho however and was not angry at her when Harry told Hermione that Cho insulted her, instead rather cross at Harry for messing up his own relationship. When Harry arrives at the Room of Requirement with Ron and Hermione, shortly after the Battle of Hogwarts all hard feelings seemed to have been forgotten or forgiven as Cho greeted Hermione in a friendly way, probably since Cho had long broke up with Harry. The two seemed to be on neutral terms.\n\nHermione first learned about Lord Voldemort, the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time, after reading about him sometime before she began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. During her first year, she and Ron Weasley helped Harry Potter reach the Philosopher's Stone and protect it from Voldemort.\n\nA year later, Hermione, after fully recovering from her Polyjuice mishap, was shown T. M. Riddle's Diary by Harry. At first enthusiastic that the book might have 'magical powers', Hermione first came up with the theory that it was Tom Riddle who originally 'caught' the 'Heir of Slytherin' when the Chamber of Secrets had been opened fifty years prior. She also correctly guessed that the Diary contained the answers to the Chamber's location, how to open it, and the true identity of Slytherin's monster. Thinking that the Diary was written in invisible ink, the attempted to use the spell Aparecium, and then a Revealer, on the object, but to no effect. Later on, when Harry went to the trophy room to try to learn more about Tom Riddle, he was accompanied by an 'interested' Hermione. When Ron compared Riddle to Percy 'in disgust', mentioning the former as being 'Prefect, Head Boy... probably at the top of every class', Hermione responded in a 'slightly hurt' voice, 'You say that like it's a bad thing.'\n\nLater on, she also correctly deduced that Riddle had 'caught the wrong person', and that 'it was some other monster [not Hagrid's Acromantula, Aragog] that was killing people'. Later on, after Harry mentioned 'hearing the voice' again before the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, Hermione ran immediately to the Library to research, where realised that Slytherin's monster was a Basilisk. Tearing the page out of the book, and putting it in her right hand, she left the Library, where she warned the first person she met, Penelope Clearwater, to look around corners with her mirror. However, both Hermione and Penelope were petrified by Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk, which was controlled by Tom Riddle's memory.\n\nIn 1995, she learned that the Dark Lord had returned and supported Harry against the Ministry's denial and smear campaign. She also fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries to prevent Voldemort from obtaining a vital prophecy, but was severely injured and rendered unconscious. In 1997, she left Hogwarts to help Harry and Ron find and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. She personally destroyed Helga Hufflepuff's Cup using a Basilisk's fang. She later witnessed Harry's defeat of Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nHowever, Hermione made very little direct contact with Voldemort, truly seeing him for the first time during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Possibly the closest connection Hermione and Voldemort shared was through the former wearing Salazar Slytherin's Locket whilst travelling with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley in 1997. The Horcrux locket was worn by all three for regular, though limited, periods of time, inadvertently allowing the portion of soul within to access the wearer's thoughts, emotions and deepest fears. The Horcrux had learned enough about Hermione to use hers and Harry's likenesses in emotionally torturing Ron, reflecting Ron's deepest fears of Hermione preferring Harry to him. Because the Horcrux had become so disconnected from the once whole soul of Tom Riddle, the physically bodied Voldemort was not aware of any of these events, nor of the information the Horcrux had gained dangling around the necks of Harry and his closest friends.\n\nAlthough they had very little direct contact, Hermione and Voldemort are sometimes similar: both are 'model students' who achieved outstanding grades in NEWTS. Both were Prefects, although Voldemort was Head Boy while Hermione skipped school during what would have been her seventh year due to political persecution, preventing her from being Head Girl that year (it is possible that Hermione became Head Girl when she went back to finish her seventh year after Voldemort's final destruction). They both came from Muggle backgrounds, but Voldemort was raised in an orphanage while Hermione was brought up in a loving Muggle family.\n\nBellatrix Lestrange was one of Voldemort's most fanatically loyal followers; Hermione initially knew her as one of the Death Eaters involved in torturing and permanently incapacitating Frank and Alice Longbottom, though she also witnessed Bellatrix murder Sirius Black at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, in 1996.\n\nDuring the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor, Bellatrix chose to torture Hermione, who, as a Muggle-born, Bellatrix felt was most dispensable (though, as a 'blood traitor,' Ron Weasley was a close second), in order to discover where and how the trio had managed to acquire Godric Gryffindor's Sword. During the interrogation, Bellatrix used her knife to carve the word 'mudblood' on Hermione's arm,[74] as well as torturing her sadistically with the Cruciatus Curse.[10] Hermione later used one of Bellatrix's hairs obtained in the skirmish to make Polyjuice Potion and break into the Lestrange Vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank. She expressed disgust at having to use Bellatrix's wand knowing the crimes Bellatrix committed with it. Hermione, Ginny, and Luna duelled against Bellatrix during the final battle, but were made to stand aside by Molly Weasley, who eventually killed Bellatrix herself, avenging Frank and Alice Longbottom, Sirius Black, Nymphadora Tonks, and Dobby the house-elf in the process, among others.\n\nDraco Malfoy, of an old and wealthy pure-blood family with Death Eater ties, was raised to believe in the inferiority of Muggle-borns, and thus treated Hermione with disdain. This was probably exacerbated by Hermione's friendship with Harry and Ron, who shared a strong enmity with Draco from virtually the moment they met, and her beating Draco in school marks, for which his father berated him.[4] Draco frequently called Hermione the disparaging term 'Mudblood,' which usually set off the tempers of her friends — and the entire Gryffindor Quidditch team when he first said it to her face in 1992[4] — but Hermione tended to ignore Draco and urged Harry and Ron to do the same.\n\nOccasionally she would snap back at him, and in their third year, she even slapped him when he mocked Rubeus Hagrid for being upset over the impending execution of Buckbeak, for which Draco was largely responsible.[34]\n\nIn spite of his prejudice and dislike toward Hermione, Draco was reluctant to confirm her identity when he was asked to do so by his parents and aunt Bellatrix in 1998, avoiding even looking at her. As an adult sobered by his wartime experiences, Draco was civil towards Hermione and her friends, and friendly with her nephew, Albus Potter.[10] He even found the idea of taking orders from her during their ambush in 1981 of Delphini to be darkly humorous. Draco's civility towards Hermione during this time was likely reinforced due to her being the Minister for Magic in Britain at the time, and possibly due to her relations to Albus Potter, the best friend of his own son, Scorpius.\n\nPansy Parkinson was more or less Hermione's polar opposite: where Hermione was compassionate (as seen when she founded SPEW), independent, and incredibly helpful to nearly anyone who needed it, Pansy was petty and spiteful, who mocked just about every non-Slytherin student she encountered (as well as Hagrid), and was little more than one of Draco Malfoy's more sycophantic lackeys. Pansy had a tendency to taunt and snipe at Hermione, Harry, and Ron at any given opportunity, though Hermione rarely seemed more than slightly irritated by her comments; the major exception to that most likely would have been Pansy's attempt to surrender Harry to Lord Voldemort shortly prior to the start of the Battle of Hogwarts. Hermione had a scathing opinion of Pansy, believing her to be be a 'cow', and 'thicker than a concussed troll'.[32]\n\nWhile covering the Triwizard Tournament in Hermione's fourth year, Daily Prophet journalist Rita Skeeter wrote a number of exaggerated and slanderous stories about Harry Potter and his friends, including one that outed Rubeus Hagrid as a half-giant. Harry and Hermione angrily confronted Rita about this. After Hermione insulted her, Rita published another article that portrayed Hermione as manipulative and ambitious, claiming that she was toying with the emotions of both Harry Potter and Viktor Krum. This resulted in Hermione receiving several letters of hate mail, including a few Howlers and at least one envelope filled with bubotuber pus.\n\nHermione became obsessed with getting back at Rita and uncovering how she was getting all of her information. Finally, near the end of the school year Hermione realised that Rita Skeeter was an unregistered Animagus. She caught Rita in her beetle form attempting to eavesdrop on Harry in the Hospital Wing after the Third Task. Hermione sealed her inside a small bottle. Hermione blackmailed Rita into giving up writing for one year, otherwise her unregistered status would be revealed. As the penalties are apparently quite severe, Rita had no choice but to comply.\n\nWhen the Ministry of Magic began using the Daily Prophet in its smear campaign against Harry, Hermione was again able to blackmail Rita, this time into writing an article for The Quibbler that would allow Harry to tell his side of the story. After her one year punishment was over, Rita went back to writing with as much enthusiasm and as little scruples as she had before, although it's unknown if she ever crossed Hermione again. Given her notable lack of commentary regarding Hermione during the 2014 Quidditch World Cup in Egypt, it is likely that Rita remained extremely wary of Hermione's wrath 19 years following her being blackmailed by the prodigious witch.\n\nDumbledore's Army was essentially Hermione's brainchild, though she co-founded it with Ron and Harry during the 1995–1996 school year. After Dolores Umbridge informed her Defence Against the Dark Arts students that they would not be using any magic, claiming a theoretical education would suffice, a furious Hermione (fearful of being ill-equipped to deal with the reborn Lord Voldemort and the upcoming O.W.L.s) conceived of the organisation as a means of allowing any student interested in actually practising defensive magic to do so. Though the secret classes were taught by Harry, Hermione arranged the initial meeting at the Hog's Head, created the DA's method of covert communication, and jinxed their member list to reveal any betrayal.\n\nAll of the DA members grew closer over the course of the year (with the exceptions of Marietta Edgecombe, who betrayed the DA to Umbridge, and later Zacharias Smith, who deserted them), as evidenced by their reunion in 1997, and their enthusiasm in supporting Harry and mobilising against the invading Death Eaters during the Battle of Hogwarts. Moreover, the DA truly cemented Hermione's friendships with Luna Lovegood and Neville Longbottom, who were the only members, aside from Ginny Weasley, to fight alongside Hermione, Harry, and Ron at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.\n\nHermione first heard about the Order of the Phoenix in 1995, when she, Harry and Ron spent several weeks at the Order's headquarters. Through her time at Grimmauld Place, Hermione got to know Alastor Moody, the most famous Auror of modern times, known for rounding up several Death Eaters after the First Wizarding War and for his growing paranoia. He and Hermione fought together in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, and later, in the Battle of the Seven Potters, where Moody was killed by Voldemort's own hand. Hermione, like the rest of the Order, was shocked and horrified by the death of such a skilled Auror, 'the consummate survivor,'[10] and disgusted by Mundungus Fletcher's desertion. Hermione, who had known Fletcher as a petty criminal who had stolen a number the Black family heirlooms shortly after Sirius Black's death, aside from being a member of the Order, took part in interrogating Fletcher, when she, Harry and Ron realised Salazar Slytherin's Locket had been among the items stolen from Grimmauld Place.\n\nHermione had great respect for Kingsley Shacklebolt, a skilled Auror and eventual Minister for Magic, who was known as 'Royal' on Potterwatch, and who saved countless lives (including Hermione, Ron and Harry's) when he sent his Patronus to warn the attendees of Bill and Fleur's wedding that the Ministry had fallen, and with it, the protections surrounding The Burrow. Another member of the Order responsible for saving the trio was Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus' younger brother. Though Hermione, Harry and Ron had known him for some time as the owner of the Hog's Head Pub, they finally met him in 1998, just before the Battle of Hogwarts, when he just barely managed to get them out a trap set by Death Eaters. Prior to that, he sent Dobby to rescue them, along with Dean Thomas, Luna Lovegood, Garrick Ollivander and Griphook the Goblin, from the Malfoy Manor; as it turned out, Aberforth had acquired Sirius Black's two-way mirror from Mundungus Fletcher, and been keeping an eye out for Harry.\n\nNymphadora Tonks, a funny, Metamorphmagus witch, who had become a good friend of Hermione's, died along with her husband and fellow member of the Order, Remus Lupin, during the Battle of Hogwarts. As their son, Ted Lupin, was Harry's godson and was also dating Hermione's niece, Victoire by 2017, it's likely Hermione remained quite close to him.\n\nAs with most aspects of the wizarding world, Hermione read about Albus Dumbledore shortly after learning that she was a witch. Hermione on her very first train journey revealed she wanted to be in Gryffindor because it was the house that Dumbledore belonged to. She first met the Hogwarts headmaster during her her first year at the school, in 1991, and quickly came to respect Dumbledore's immense power and seemingly infinite wisdom. Although Dumbledore was not as close with her as he was with Harry Potter, he showed great insight into her character very early on. She was one of only three students Dumbledore bequeathed a personal item, as he believed her to be, along with Ron Weasley, trustworthy of accompanying Harry on his mission to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes.\n\nHe respected her intellect, perspicacity, and level-headedness, admitting to Harry that he had counted on Hermione to keep things in perspective when the trio finally discovered the existence of the Deathly Hallows. Hermione was devastated when Dumbledore was killed, and visited his portrait with Harry and Ron after the Battle of Hogwarts to determine the fate of the Hallows.\n\nRubeus Hagrid was the gamekeeper and Care of Magical Creatures professor at Hogwarts, as well as a member of the Order of the Phoenix during the First and Second Wizarding Wars. Since Hagrid had met Harry Potter prior to the start of Hermione's first year at Hogwarts, Hermione grew closer to Hagrid as her friendship with Harry developed, eventually coming to visit him in his hut regularly with Harry and Ron Weasley. In their second year, Hagrid comforted Hermione when she was called a 'a filthy little mudblood' by Draco Malfoy.\n\nThough she disapproved of Hagrid's penchant for collecting dangerous pets, she tended to more pro-actively support him in his efforts to care for them than Harry and Ron, as when Hagrid was attempting to appeal the execution of Buckbeak and raise his half-brother Grawp. In turn, it was Hagrid who encouraged Ron and Harry to re-think their treatment of Hermione when the three had a brief falling out over Hermione getting Harry's new Firebolt confiscated in their third year. When Dolores Umbridge threatened Hagrid's job during the 1995-1996 school year, Hermione advised him to teach only materials related to their O.W.Ls, so as not to give Umbridge any excuse to fire him, and worked tirelessly to keep him on track.\n\nHagrid remained close to the trio throughout their time at Hogwarts, and fought various battles in the course of the Second Wizarding War. In 2017, Harry's sons planned to meet Hagrid in his hut for tea soon after arriving at school, and it's very likely that Hermione and Ron's daughter would have been joining them.\n\nHermione was among the students who were very impressed by Remus Lupin's teaching in 1993, when he was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Hermione deduced he was a werewolf during the school year, yet chose to keep it a secret in order to respect his privacy. Towards the end of the year, however, Lupin admitted that he was a werewolf to Harry, Ron and Hermione whilst in the Shrieking Shack. Following the events in this dilapidated building, Lupin became fully prepared to help Sirius Black kill Peter Pettigrew, the wizard who betrayed James and Lily Potter to Voldemort.\n\nHowever, thanks to Harry's intervention, they chose not to commit the murder, inadvertently allowing Pettigrew to escape. Lupin had referred to Hermione as the cleverest witch of her age he had ever seen before to this. Hermione, meanwhile, did not concern herself with Lupin's lycanthropy, she judged him only by his good nature and the content of his character.\n\nHermione met Lupin again in 1995 at the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. She and Lupin both fought against the Death Eaters during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996, and survived (despite Hermione being side-swiped by Dolohov's curse). They also fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of the Seven Potters alongside, both emerging alive and relatively unscathed on the two occasions. Hermione was pleased to learn that Lupin had married Nymphadora Tonks before the Battle of the Seven Potters began, and became even more joyful at the news of Lupin's son, Ted Lupin, being born; joining in on the celebratory festivities at Shell Cottage. Hermione was devastated by Lupin's and Tonks' deaths in 1998, becoming friendly with their orphaned son, Teddy Lupin, later on in life.\n\nProfessor Minerva McGonagall took a shine to Hermione from the first class she had with her, granting the first-year student in her house one of her 'rare smiles' when Hermione successfully transfigured a match into a needle early on in the lesson and long before any other student. She had high expectations for Hermione, and was thus disappointed in her when Hermione claimed she tried to fight the troll that entered the school in 1991 on her own, in order to cover up for Harry and Ron. Whenever Hermione and her friends would get into trouble, McGonagall almost inevitably looked to Hermione to be the most sensible one.[3]\n\nMcGonagall was noticeably upset when Hermione was Petrified in 1993, even granting Harry and Ron permission to skip a class so they could visit Hermione in the hospital wing.[4] The following school year, she helped arrange for Hermione to be granted a Time-Turner to take extra classes.[34] When the professor was injured with four Stunning Spells in 1996, Hermione was very upset and worried for her.[32] Hermione seemed to regard her head of house as a role model, while Professor McGonagall, in spite of her sternness, was obviously quite fond of Hermione and expected great things of her.\n\nLater, after McGonagall became headmistress of Hogwarts and Hermione became a member of the Ministry of Magic, McGonagall granted her permission to use notes left to the Hogwarts Archives, written by Albus Dumbledore, in her re-translation of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, demonstrating McGonagall's trust in her former pupil.\n\nSeverus Snape was the Potions Master during most of Hermione's time at Hogwarts. He was also the Head of Slytherin House, and tended to openly show preferential treatment for the students of his own house, while being quick to criticise and deduct points from Gryffindor students. He was particularly unpleasant towards the trio, and regularly punished and verbally assaulted Harry and Ron for their poor to mediocre performances in his class. He could not do the same to Hermione, as she was the best student in the year and instead mocked her for things like being an 'insufferable know-it-all,'[34] once even snidely insulting the size of Hermione's teeth.[35]\n\nDespite his pre-existing dislike for Gryffindor,[10] Snape's treatment of Hermione likely had more to do with her close friendship with Harry. Despite this, Hermione was still seen to defend Snape on occasion when Harry and Ron blamed him for evil deeds which occurred in Hogwarts, like setting the troll in the dungeon and trying to steal the Philosopher's Stone in Harry's first year. In her fifth year she defended Snape while Ron expressed distrust of him, citing the number of times they were wrong about Snape wanting to harm them. After Dumbledore's death, she like many, believed that Snape was a coward who killed a man who trusted him more than anyone. It is unknown exactly how she reacted to learning of Snape's true motives and allegiance, but given her personality, it is highly likely that she came to both forgive her former Professor's cruelty and even admire him for his bravery. Later, in an alternative timeline where she and Snape led the resistance against Voldemort after Harry Potter's death, Hermione seemed to respect her former teacher and, after discovering that in the mainstream reality Snape had perished, she expressed her sorrow.\n\nDolores Umbridge was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor by the Ministry of Magic, in 1995. She was a sadistic woman who enjoyed punishing and torturing students using the Black Quill, most notably when she forced Harry Potter to carve 'I must not tell lies' into the back of his own hand. Umbridge was as obsessed with blood-status as the Death Eaters, and had a particular hatred of what she called 'half-breeds.' Hermione, like most of the students and staff at Hogwarts, hated Umbridge. Hermione was one of the first to pick up on the true motives behind Umbridge's appointment at the magical school. In turn, Umbridge was not too fond of Hermione, who was not only Muggle-born, but was also probably far too perceptive for her liking, as well as being outspokenly opposed to a purely theoretical defensive magical education. Despite this, Umbridge could not help but be impressed, however reluctantly, when Hermione effortlessly quoted a phrase from Defensive Magical Theory.\n\nWhen Umbridge planned to use Veritaserum and then the Cruciatus Curse on Harry, Hermione was the one who came up with the lie that led to them venturing into the Forbidden Forest and Umbridge eventually being dragged away by a herd of offended centaurs.\n\nHermione next met Umbridge a second time at the Ministry of Magic in 1997, when Hermione was disguised as Mafalda Hopkirk through the usage of Polyjuice Potion. Umbridge was, at the time, interrogating 'Mudblood' witches and wizards, prior to sending them to Azkaban. Harry stunned Umbridge and retrieved Salazar Slytherin's Locket, one of Voldemort's Horcruxes which Umbridge had taken from Mundungus Fletcher and was attempting to pass off as a family heirloom and proof of her relation to the Selwyn family. Hermione replaced the locket by duplicating it with the Geminio spell so Umbridge would not know that it had been taken from her. The trio proceeded to free all the Muggle-Borns awaiting interrogation.\n\nSuffice it to say that Umbridge personified everything that Hermione detested and loathed in Wizarding society, including but not limited to racial prejudice, sadism, malicious misuse of power, authoritarianism, and pure-blood supremacy.\n\nHermione also had a good relationship with her Arithmancy Professor Septima Vector. Many students disliked Vector because of her strictness. However, Hermione said Arithmancy was her favourite subject at Hogwarts. She also never complained about Vector's strictness. During her third year, Hermione joined her class and used a time-turner to get to one of the lessons.[77] Then in her fourth year, Hermione and the other students got no homework from Septima Vector on the first day of term,[78] and she adamantly refused to skive Arithmancy.[58]\n\nRowling took Hermione's name from William Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale,[79] saying that she wanted it to be unusual, since if fewer girls shared her name, fewer girls would get teased for it.[79] Rowling's knowledge and interest in Greek mythology may have also influenced her choice in regards to Hermione's name. In 1988, Rowling wrote a short essay about her time studying classics entitled 'What was the Name of that Nymph Again? or Greek and Roman Studies Recalled'; it was published by the University of Exeter's journal Pegasus.[80] The name 'Hermione' is derived from 'Hermes', who was the messenger of the Greek gods, as well as the god of wit, eloquence and quick thinking.\n\n'Hermione' is the female derivative of 'Hermes', a messenger god known for his sharp wit and ability to transition between worlds. Quite fittingly, Hermione transitioned between the Muggle and wizarding worlds, delivered information, and was pretty sharp-witted herself.\n\nHermione is also the name of another figure from Greek mythology, who was the princess of Sparta and the only daughter of Helen of Troy and King Menelaus. The name also appears in Jean-Baptiste Lully's play Cadmus et Hermione, based on the story of the goddess of harmony, Harmonia, who married the founder of Thebes.\n\nIn order to ensure that fans could correctly pronounce Hermione's name, a scene was created between Hermione and Viktor Krum in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in which they discuss the correct pronunciation; however, the closest Krum got was 'Herm-own-ninny'.[81]\n\nIn the will of Albus Dumbledore, Hermione's middle name was listed as 'Jean'; however, in previous interviews, Rowling had stated that her middle name was 'Jane'. Rowling cleared this up in a later interview by stating that she had decided that she did not want Hermione to share a middle name with Professor Umbridge, and thus changed it to Jean, which is a female variant of the name John, meaning 'God is gracious'.[82]\n\nGranger is another word for farmer; specifically, it was the title of a farm bailiff, who oversaw the collection of rent and taxes from the barns of a feudal lord. It is a surname of English and French origin, derived from the Anglo-Norman grainger and the French grangier, both of which come from Latin granica, meaning 'granary'. It recalls Hermione's Muggle roots. Her original last name was 'Puckle', but Rowling later decided this didn't suit her character.\n\nHer initials are the chemical symbol for Mercury, another name for Hermes.[83]\n\nThe reason of choosing such an uncommon name as Hermione for the character is because, according to Rowling, she did not bear getting any child mocked because of sharing a name with an 'insufferable know-it-all' such as Hermione.\n\nJ. K. Rowling has claimed that she loosely based Hermione at the age of eleven on herself at the same age, though an exaggerated version:\n\nRowling has gone on to say that Hermione, Harry, and Ron are all 'a bit like different parts of my personality' as well as her favourite characters, along with Rubeus Hagrid, Albus Dumbledore, Fred and George Weasley, and Luna Lovegood,[89] and that Hermione and Dumbledore were the most useful characters for exposition.[90] She also identified Hermione as 'the most brilliant' of her group of friends and confirmed that 'Harry needs her badly.'[98] Rowling has also said that she considers Hermione to be 'a very strong female character,' as well as 'the brightest character.'[99]\n\nRowling has also stated that, from a feminist point of view, she is very proud of Hermione. In her words, Hermione does not 'play the game' in refusing to sacrifice parts of herself as she grows from a girl to a woman. Hermione never makes Ron 'feel better' by pretending to be less than she is; she always preserves who she is and waits for Ron to catch up. In general, Rowling regards her as a heroine, but isn't sexy nor entirely sexless, but a 'real girl.'\n\nRowling admitted in an interview conducted by Emma Watson for the magazine Wonderland in February of 2014 that, with hindsight, she initially had some second thoughts on the suitability of Ron as a partner for Hermione and believes that in some ways, Harry might have made a better romantic partner for her:\n\nShe went on to say that she found the attraction itself plausible, but that the combative side of it might cause problems in an adult relationship as there was too much fundamental incompatibility. However, according to Rowling, they could 'probably be alright' with a bit of marriage counselling, as Ron needed to work on his self-esteem issues while Hermione needed to learn to be less critical. She concluded with the statement that just like herself, the uptight Hermione had a real weakness for a funny man. Ultimately, Rowling stated she had no regrets putting them together and stated the two balanced each other out and truly love one another.[100]",
