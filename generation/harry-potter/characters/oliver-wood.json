  "content": "Oliver Wood (born c. 1975 or 1976) was a wizard who was the Keeper and Captain for the Gryffindor Quidditch team during his time as a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which he attended from 1987 to 1994.\n\nOliver was known for his determination and skill on the playing field, and his long lectures before practices. He led the Gryffindor team to victory in the Quidditch Cup in his seventh year.\n\nAfter leaving school, Oliver joined Puddlemere United as a reserve player (presumably as Keeper). In 1998, Oliver returned to Hogwarts to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts against Voldemort and his Death Eaters, alongside his former school friends and teammates.\n\nOliver was born in Great Britain or Ireland in 1975 or 1976, likely into a wizarding family.[2]\n\nOliver Wood attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1987 to 1994. He was Sorted into Gryffindor and presumably shared a dormitory with Percy Weasley.\n\nHe joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team as a Keeper.[5] During his first game he took a Bludger to the head two minutes in, and woke up a week later in the Hospital Wing. He mentioned this to Harry Potter when Oliver was in his fifth year, as Harry was nervous for his first Quidditch match. Oliver also mentioned that he didn't really remember his first match because of this.[6]\n\nHe also attended Hogwarts with Charlie Weasley (Gryffindor) and Nymphadora Tonks (Hufflepuff) for four years before they graduated. Oliver would frequently talk about Charlie's superb Quidditch skills and showed appreciation for them, as he was a huge Quidditch fan himself.[5]\n\nSometime before 1991, Oliver was given an \"award for effort\".[7] Oliver once borrowed Quidditch Through the Ages from the Hogwarts Library and was due to return the book on 9 April in an unknown year.[8]\n\nOliver became Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team in either 1990, his fourth year[9] or 1991, his fifth year.[10]\n\nIn the 1991–1992 school year, despite assembling a good team, he was unable to find anyone skilled enough to play as Seeker for the team after the departure of Charles Weasley in the previous year. However, his search was ended when his Head of House, Professor McGonagall, observed Harry Potter catch Neville Longbottom's Remembrall on a broomstick from a fifty foot dive. McGonagall claimed that it was a move that even Charlie Weasley couldn't have pulled off, convincing Oliver that Harry was indeed something special. He immediately saw that Harry's build was perfect for a Seeker, and impressed upon McGonagall the need for Harry to have a decent broom to fly.\n\nOliver gave Harry his first Quidditch lesson in private, immediately seeing that Harry was a natural flyer on a broomstick.[11] Wanting to use Harry as a secret weapon during the first match of the season against Slytherin, Oliver tried to keep his presence on the team under wraps. Despite his best efforts, however, word got out about Harry's presence, although his skill level was a secret from everyone outside the team.\n\nCaptaining the side against their nemesis, Slytherin, in the first game of the season, Oliver was delighted when Harry captured the Golden Snitch in his first match, winning the game for Gryffindor. However, the second game of the season, against Hufflepuff, gave Oliver cause for concern, when he found out that Professor Snape would be refereeing the match in place of Madam Hooch. Fearing that Snape would not be fair to Gryffindor following their defeat of Slytherin, he urged Harry to catch the Snitch as soon as possible. When he caught it within five minutes, Oliver was overjoyed. If Gryffindor could beat Ravenclaw in the final match of the season, then they would surely capture the Quidditch Cup.\n\nShortly after, Gryffindor House lost one hundred and fifty house points due to the actions of three first year students, including Harry Potter. Harry offered his resignation to Oliver, who declined it, his reasoning being that if they didn't win at Quidditch, they had no chance to recoup the lost points. Despite this, Oliver likely felt somewhat irked towards Harry, as, during team practice sessions, his angry teammates simply referred to Harry as \"the Seeker\".\n\nThe final match of the season against Ravenclaw was a disaster. Harry was in the hospital wing after facing Professor Quirrell and Lord Voldemort, and recovering the Philosopher's Stone. Without Harry and his Nimbus 2000 broomstick, the Gryffindor team suffered its biggest defeat[5] in three hundred years.[12]\n\nOliver spent the summer of 1992 devising an entirely new training schedule that included early morning practice sessions. He was determined to win the Cup, and his enthusiasm for regular training sessions knew no limits. He was annoyed that his team did not seem to be taking it as seriously as he was, but that may have been a result of getting them all up earlier than they expected on the day of their first training session.\n\nOn the first Saturday back at school, he booked the Quidditch pitch to begin training earlier than the other teams. His plan was cut short by the arrival of the Slytherin team, who had been given permission to use the pitch by Professor Snape in order to train their new Seeker, Draco Malfoy.\n\nGryffindor won their first match of the season against Slytherin, but the unexplained attacks on Muggle-born students (later found to be caused by the reopening of the Chamber of Secrets and the freeing of the monster within) forced the cancellation of the year's remaining matches. When Minerva McGonagall announced the good news that the school would not be closing, many students shouted \"Dumbledore's back\" or \"The heir of Slytherin has been caught\". Wood instead showed his intense love for Quidditch by shouting \"Quidditch matches are back on.\"[12]\n\nIn his final year, Oliver Wood was especially desperate to win the Quidditch Cup. He knew that he had the best team in the whole school, and he felt that the Cup would have been Gryffindor's for the past two years if events hadn't so conspired against them. Training his team hard for the first match against Slytherin, he was shocked to find out that Slytherin had managed to postpone the match owing to an injury to their Seeker, Draco Malfoy. Malfoy, injured by a hippogriff after insulting it during a Care of Magical Creatures lesson, was overplaying his injury to get out of playing the match during such extremely bad weather. Gryffindor were to then play Hufflepuff instead.\n\nDuring the match, Harry was overcome by Dementors, who were attracted to the large gathering. He fell from his broom while chasing the Golden Snitch and it was captured by the Hufflepuff Seeker, Cedric Diggory. When he realised what had happened, Cedric immediately offered Oliver a rematch, but Oliver declined it, knowing that Cedric had caught the Snitch fair and square, and assuring Harry that he didn't blame him for failing to catch the Snitch despite his previously impeccable record.\n\nHowever, Oliver knew they still had a chance to win the Cup if they won their remaining matches and other results went their way. He urged Harry to buy a new broom, since his Nimbus 2000 had been destroyed by the Whomping Willow after the last match, and was also worried about the Dementors appearing again and affecting Harry. Harry assured him that Professor Lupin was teaching him to deal with Dementors, and that he had received a Firebolt broomstick for Christmas.\n\nOliver was amazed, then disappointed to learn that Professor McGonagall had confiscated it to check for signs of tampering or sabotage, as she feared that Sirius Black may have sent it to harm Harry. Oliver tried to appeal to McGonagall, telling her that having the Firebolt would greatly enhance their chances of winning the Quidditch Cup. McGonagall, however, accused Oliver of placing victory above Harry's life in his order of priorities. Finally, though, the Firebolt was given a clean bill of health, and returned to Harry, much to Oliver's joy.\n\nIn the run up to the second match of the season against Ravenclaw, Oliver upped the training sessions to five times a week, and monitored the status of the Ravenclaw Seeker, Cho Chang. Knowing that she had a lot of trouble with injuries, he hoped that she would not be fit to play, and was disappointed to learn that she was able to. During the match, Oliver told Harry to stop being a gentleman and knock Cho off her broom if he had to.\n\nGryffindor beat Ravenclaw, and other results went their way, meaning that, in the final game of the season against Slytherin, if they could win by two hundred points, they would win the Cup. Oliver took to constantly reminding Harry that he must not catch the Snitch unless they were ahead by at least fifty points, and ordering that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he went, to prevent anyone from harming him before the game, which numerous Slytherins made it clear was a clear and present danger.\n\nDuring the match against Slytherin, Oliver took two Bludgers to the stomach early in the game. Eventually, Harry managed to capture the Snitch when Gryffindor were ahead by at least sixty points, resulting in Gryffindor winning the Quidditch Cup. Oliver, overjoyed and ecstatic at finally having achieved his dream, watched Harry lift the Cup aloft.[13]\n\nAfter leaving Hogwarts, Oliver became the Keeper for Puddlemere United's reserve team. In the summer of 1994, he attended the Quidditch World Cup, along with his old classmates. It was at the World Cup that he saw Harry and introduced him to his parents and told Harry of his new career.[14]\n\nIn 1995, Harry made a joke with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger about how the new Gryffindor captain, Angelina Johnson, seemed to be channelling Oliver's intense competitiveness, and that perhaps they should check with Puddlemere United that Oliver is still alive and hadn't been killed during a training session.[15]\n\nIn 1998, Oliver returned to Hogwarts along with former Gryffindor Quidditch players Angelina Johnson, Katie Bell, and Alicia Spinnet to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters.[16] During a lull in the battle, which was granted to them by Lord Voldemort as time to gather the dead, he assisted Neville Longbottom in carrying the dead bodies of Colin Creevey and others into the Great Hall.[17]\n\nFollowing the defeat and death of Voldemort at the hands of Harry Potter at the end of the Battle, Wood survived the battle, as his name was not mentioned among the Fallen Fifty. Afterwards, he likely continued with his career as a professional Quidditch player.\n\nOliver was well built and burly, and had a commanding presence, especially to those in his team. He was known to get a maniacal look in his eyes when he was enthusing about Quidditch.[5]\n\nWood was described as an intensely driven, competitive personality. He was singularly focused and determined to creating the best Quidditch team in the school. His ambition and dedication to the sport was such that he forced his players to train relentlessly, including early morning starts and all-weather training. Wood's obsession with winning occasionally became somewhat maniacal.\n\nIn 1992 he told Harry to \"catch the Snitch or die trying\" and in 1993, Fred and George Weasley declared, with only mild exaggeration, that Wood was attempting to drown himself in the showers after a defeat as he refused to come out when they did. They also said in 1996 that \"Wood might have done the Slytherins if he could have,\" after someone asked who would try to kill off a Quidditch team. He regularly scheduled three practice sessions a week, rising to five a week before an important match. His overriding ambition was to win the Quidditch cup before he graduated, a dream which he finally achieved in 1994.[5][12][13]\n\nDespite this, Wood was remarkably humble concerning his own skill, putting the team's success down to the other members of the team. He would often be more concerned about his teammates than himself, like urging them to eat breakfast before a match, yet touching nothing himself. He was also extremely loyal to Gryffindor and saw the success of the Gryffindor team as Gryffindor House's success as a whole. He was also very fair; it was said by others that he didn't accept a replay after Harry fell off his broom against Cedric Diggory in 1993 since he felt that Diggory had caught the Snitch fairly, although it is unknown if this is true. He also assured Harry that he didn't blame him for the loss as he respected that there had to be at least one game where Harry wouldn't win.[5][13]\n\nAlthough he was fair-minded and approachable, Wood (which is an irony given his position as Captain of his team) appeared to struggle with interpersonal skills, as he often seemed oblivious to the way in which he came across to people. He never seemed to realise that his long-winded pep talks did not engage the rest of the team, and indeed frequently disgruntled them, possibly decreasing their motivation. After Harry's Firebolt was confiscated, Wood protested to Professor McGonagall that he didn't care if it threw Harry off as long as he caught the Snitch on it first, apparently not understanding that this implied that he cared more about winning than about Harry's welfare. Despite this, he generally had a good relationship with the rest of the team.\n\nAside from his Quidditch skills, Oliver had the trademark courage and bravery of a true Gryffindor as, despite having graduated and having no obligation to do so, Oliver returned to Hogwarts to participate in the battle against Voldemort, and led fellow former Gryffindor Quidditch players Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson, and Alicia Spinnet into the battle with their brooms.\n\nThe olive branch often is a symbol of peace. The olive tree's symbolism also includes a great harvest and long life. Wood is a place name (like Brooks or Field) and suggests ancestors who lived near or in a forest, or who were woodcutters. It is possible that Wood was meant to be the opposite of the name Flint, the name of the Slytherin Quidditch team captain and Wood's rival.",
