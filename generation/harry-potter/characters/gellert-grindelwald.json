  "content": "Gellert Grindelwald (1882/1883 – March 1998) was a pure-blood Dark wizard who was considered to be amongst the most powerful and notorious wizards of all time, his only superiors being Albus Dumbledore and Lord Voldemort.[13] A student at Durmstrang Institute, Grindelwald was expelled for twisted, dark experiments and near-fatal attacks on students.\n\nAfter leaving Durmstrang, he fostered a romantic relationship with a young Albus Dumbledore, making plans to find the Deathly Hallows and lead a Wizarding revolution to end the International Statute of Secrecy, and create a new wizard-led order that would dominate Muggles. At seventeen, their partnership fell apart after the two were involved in a three-way duel with Dumbledore's brother Aberforth that resulted in the death of Dumbledore's sister Ariana. Grindelwald left Britain and later stole the Elder Wand from Mykew Gregorovitch, proceeding alone with the revolution he and Dumbledore had planned.\n\nGrindelwald was a complex figure, highly idealistic and talented, dedicated to achieve his ends at any cost. A revolutionary operating outside the law, he and his followers committed numerous crimes, including several murders. With violent acts in both the United States and Europe, Grindelwald ultimately established a power base at Nurmengard Castle in Austria.\n\nIn 1945, at the height of Grindelwald's power, Dumbledore confronted and defeated him in a legendary duel. He was subsequently imprisoned in his own fortress for decades, and was finally slain there by Lord Voldemort in 1998 when he refused to give up the location of the Elder Wand.\n\nGellert Grindelwald was born around 1882 or 1883,[1] and was educated at Durmstrang Institute during his formative years, where he excelled in various fields of magic and absorbed much of the school's strength-obsessed, Dark Magic-oriented culture. He was an extremely talented wizard who possessed an attractive and winsome personality, which was coupled with a \"merry, wild\" disposition.\n\nAt some point in his youth, Grindelwald, who was a natural born Seer, had a vision where he saw himself rise to dominance over the wizarding world,[14] and when he learned of the fabled Deathly Hallows; three fabled objects which, if united, would make the possessor the Master of Death, he quickly came to see the Quest as instrumental to fulfil the aforementioned prediction.\n\nOver the course of his school career, Grindelwald grew increasingly obsessed with learning whatever he could about the three items in question, to the point of appropriating the runic symbol that represented them as his own personal emblem; and even engraved it on the walls of Durmstrang prior to his departure. These engravings persisted for many generations, and Rita Skeeter's book The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore explains that Grindelwald's 'twisted experiments' and dangerous attacks on other students that almost resulted in their deaths had been the reasons for his expulsion at 16 years old from Durmstrang before he could graduate. This was an ominous and troubling sign, as it meant that Grindelwald performed experiments that were too disturbing even for a school with a notably high tolerance of the Dark Arts.\n\nAfter his expulsion from Durmstrang, Grindelwald's quest for information about the Hallows led him to Godric's Hollow, England, where Ignotus Peverell, said to have been the first owner of Death's Cloak of Invisibility, had been laid to rest. Conveniently, his great-aunt, acclaimed wizarding historian Bathilda Bagshot, lived there and provided a place for him to stay, complete with a treasure trove of books and documents and a minimum of supervision. It was in Godric's Hollow in the summer of 1899 that Grindelwald met and befriended Albus Dumbledore.[15]\n\nThe two teenagers had a lot in common: they were intellectuals and talented young wizards, who were also idealistic and ambitious. The pair even became lovers during the two months that they knew one another.[16] Following these “two months of insanity,” as Dumbledore would later recall them to be, the two teens shaped one another's ideas, powers, as well as destinies from that day forth and became intertwined with each other. Whilst they were staying at Bathilda Bagshot's house, they also made a blood pact, swearing never to fight each other.\n\nThe pair shared two preoccupations: The first was their search for the Deathly Hallows toward the goal of acquiring all three and wielding their power to become a Master of Death, which they believed to mean immortality and invincibility. They also dreamed of overturning the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy and creating a new order in which wise and powerful wizards and witches were the benevolent overlords of their world, including Muggles. Dumbledore coined the phrase \"For the Greater Good\" that would be used to justify the necessary use of force required to achieve their goals, and Grindelwald would later adopt as his motto.[17]\n\nHowever, Dumbledore's motivations and intentions were different from Grindelwald's: as a young man, he had been powerless to stop a group of Muggle boys tormenting his younger sister, Ariana, to the point that the sweet-natured girl suffered an emotional breakdown and her repressed magic resulted in her becoming an Obscurial. Dumbledore's father was sent to Azkaban for taking revenge on the boys and his mother was killed in one of Ariana's accidents. Dumbledore wanted the power to protect his loved ones (and by extension the whole world) against cruelty and xenophobia like that shown by the Muggles. He viewed the Resurrection Stone as a way of returning his parents to life and relieving him of his new familial obligations, while Grindelwald mistakenly viewed it as a tool to amass an army of Inferi.[18]\n\nTheir plans to leave Godric's Hollow, acquire power, and begin their revolution turned serious. When Dumbledore's brother Aberforth became aware of this, he was both concerned about and disgusted with Albus's ambition, knowing that he and Ariana would need to be brought along as she would not receive the care and attention she needed to keep her stable. The tense situation boiled over into a confrontation and Grindelwald, enraged, inflicted the Cruciatus Curse on Aberforth. Albus moved to defend his brother, igniting a vicious three-way duel in which Ariana was killed. Grindelwald fled the country and received putative blame for Ariana's death, thus confirming his place on the wrong side of the law and touching off his career as a Dark revolutionary, which would last until 1945.\n\nGrindelwald delved into his research on the Deathly Hallows and uncovered the location of the Elder Wand. Rumours had been circulating that the renowned Wandmaker Mykew Gregorovitch was in possession of the wand and was trying to duplicate its properties.\n\nGrindelwald broke into Gregorovitch's workshop, lay in wait for the Wandmaker, stunned him, and stole the wand, thereby becoming its new master. Grindelwald's research may have uncovered this unconventional path to ownership of the wand as the common interpretation was that ownership passed only by murder.[11][18]\n\nFollowing his acquisition of the Elder Wand, in November 1926, he launched several devastating attacks across Europe, committing mass slaughter, and garnering international attention from wizarding authorities. Several of the attacks also drew the attention of the Muggle world, risking exposure and war. In response to Grindelwald's actions, an international wizardhunt ensued and was reported on in periodicals such as the Daily Prophet and The New York Ghost.[19] Whilst doing this, Grindelwald hid in a derelict château.[20]\n\nOn 28 November 1926, while staying in the château, the International Confederation of Wizards discovered this place and almost captured him, but he was able to kill his pursuers. On 2 December, Grindelwald began amassing an army of followers, after realising the danger of being captured. President Seraphina Picquery of the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) would later lay the blame for Grindelwald's escape on Heinrich Eberstadt, claiming that he had let the dark wizard \"slip through his fingers\".[21]\n\nHe also established a prison in Austria, Nurmengard, to serve as a form of containment for his enemies. During this period, he was also known to have personally murdered several people; one victim was identified as Viktor Krum's grandfather.[22]\n\nAs Grindelwald's power grew, he began to make plans for the confrontation he knew would happen one day; a confrontation with his old friend and the only wizard in the world believed to be powerful enough to defeat him: Albus Dumbledore. Unknown to the rest of the wizarding community, neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald could fight each other directly, which was the result of the blood pact they had formed in their youth. However, Grindelwald knew that Dumbledore was powerful enough to compromise his plans without fighting him directly, a threat he made clear to all his followers.\n\nSeeking a means to defeat Dumbledore without having to fight him personally, Grindelwald saw visions in which an Obscurial \"killed the man he feared above all others\"[23] which was his former lover. Knowing that an Obscurus of such destructive capability could be the only being apart from himself possibly powerful enough to kill Dumbledore, Grindelwald left Europe for America to find and recruit the child to his cause.[3]\n\nGrindelwald's disappearance was noted by many newspapers around the wizarding world, who were concerned at the absence of news about the Dark wizard.[24]\n\nIn December of 1926, unbeknownst to Picquery, Grindelwald had already infiltrated MACUSA by assuming the identity of her right-hand man Percival Graves using human transfiguration, whom Grindelwald managed to subdue. Grindelwald believed mysterious attacks occurring in New York City to be the work of a powerful Obscurial, which he felt would be a great asset for his plans of world domination.\n\nUsing his disguise as Graves, Grindelwald came into regular contact with Credence Barebone, believing him to be connected to the Obscurial due to a vision he received. Thinking Credence was an orphaned Squib, Grindelwald emotionally manipulated him into helping him find the Obscurial with the promise of protecting him from his abusive adoptive mother and teaching him magic.\n\nDuring this time, Grindelwald (as Graves) arrested Newt Scamander, whose escaped beasts were believed by MACUSA to be the cause of the Obscurial's attacks. During his interrogation, Grindelwald discovered the Obscurus within Newt's suitcase, and in an effort to hide his tracks, had him and Tina Goldstein sentenced to death.\n\nHe then approached Credence after Mary Lou Barebone was killed by the Obscurial and had him track down his adoptive sister Modesty, believing her to be the source of the Obscurus. Once they found Modesty, Grindelwald cruelly rejected Credence, as he had no further use of him. This angered Credence, who then revealed that he was the Obscurial, much to Grindelwald's surprise, as no Obscurial had survived to more than 10 years old, more than 15 years younger than Credence's age.\n\nGrindelwald wanted to use him to expose the North American wizarding community, and create a weapon against Dumbledore. He attempted to convince Credence that he had nothing to fear anymore and to join his ranks, but this further angered Credence, who began rampaging through the city. Grindelwald was not easily deterred, however, and continued to try to recruit Credence, clashing with Tina and later Newt, both of whom he easily overpowered. When Grindelwald, Newt, and Tina were finally close to calming down Credence, Picquery and her Aurors appeared on the scene and immediately attacked the Obscurus.\n\nWith Credence being seemingly destroyed at the Aurors' hands, Grindelwald was so beside himself with rage that he, led by his extreme idealism, began to break his disguise while expressing his utter disgust for being forced to hide from the Muggles. Picquery subsequently ordered the other Aurors to bring \"Graves\" in, but Grindelwald, no longer suppressing his tremendous magical prowess, started to overwhelm them despite being outnumbered at least twenty to one. However, Newt finally managed to catch him off-guard with his Swooping Evil and restrained Grindelwald's hands from behind, while Tina used a Summoning Charm to take Graves' wand.\n\nNewt then cast the Revelio Charm, making Grindelwald's disguise fade away while revealing his identity. Even apprehended, Grindelwald was unfazed, arrogantly questioning Picquery's ability to contain a wizard of his reputation and power. As he was led away, Grindelwald met Newt's gaze and mysteriously asked him: \"Will we die, just a little?\"[25]\n\nSix months after Grindelwald was captured by Newt Scamander, he was supposed to be transported from MACUSA Prison to Europe by Rudolph Spielman and Aurors to answer for crimes he committed. Because of his gift of persuasion, they had his tongue cut out, as several guards had sided with him. Unbeknownst to Picquery, Spielman and several others, Abernathy, a MACUSA employee, was already one of Grindelwald's acolytes.\n\nA few moments before escorting the dark wizard, Abernathy went to Grindelwald's cell and they both assumed each other's identities, possibly via Human Transfiguration. When the carriage with the false Grindelwald set off, Grindelwald (as Abernathy) Disapparated from the Woolworth Building rooftop and Apparated underneath the carriage. When the two wizards reverted back to their true identities, Grindelwald Apparated onto the carriage and killed the Aurors escorting the carriage.\n\nHe filled the carriage with water to stop the ongoing struggle inside as they realised that Abernathy had taken Grindelwald's place. Grindelwald killed Aurors who had followed them, and then entered the carriage, with Spielman and Abernathy. Stunned as Grindelwald plays tricks with his pet Antonio, he played a trick with Rudolph Spielman's wand, which ultimately lead to Gellert sending him into the waters of New York Bay, before flying to Paris with his second lieutenant, Abernathy.\n\nThree months later, Grindelwald, alongside his acolytes, travelled to Paris to search again for Credence Barebone, who had survived the the battle in New York, in order to utilise his abilities to kill Albus Dumbledore. They walked on Boulevard Haussmann, where he pointed his cane at an apartment and waited patiently, tapping his cane on the street, for his subordinates to assassinate a couple in order to take over their apartment as a temporary headquarters.\n\nHe watched as his acolytes carried out two coffins containing the couple, putting them into a horse-drawn hearse carriage. Stepping inside with his most trusted follower, Vinda Rosier, Grindelwald stated that the place was \"suitable\" before sending one of his acolytes, Nagel, to the Circus Arcanus to seek out Credence. He also reminded Vinda that death was not to be the fate of all non-magic people. Soon after, they then heard a toddler calling to his parents and directed Carrow to kill him.\n\nLater on, he used his skull-hookah to show the Alliance what Credence looked like. Krall questioned Gellert and got personally interrogated regarding his loyalty to his revolution.\n\nDuring this time, Grindelwald urged Queenie Goldstein and bounty hunter Gunnar Grimmson to join his cause, which worked on Queenie due to her relationship with No-Maj Jacob Kowalski and due to Vinda emotionally exploiting her beforehand. Grindelwald ordered Grimmson to kill Irma Dugard in order to keep Credence's identity a secret from him. After the murder, he met with Grimmson in an alleyway and talked about how Credence took the murder of Irma and how he should join the Alliance.\n\nGrindelwald himself later found Credence on the rooftop of the attic of 18 Rue Philippe Lorand and offered him a chance to find out his true parentage, and gave him a map to the Père Lachaise Cemetery.\n\nOne evening, Grindelwald called a meeting for his followers in the Lestrange Mausoleum. There, he gave a rousing speech, in which he shared his idealist perspective of Muggles, as well as his vision of the future, which he warns of another great and terrible war, with images of the London Blitz and Hiroshima punctuating his rhetoric. Grindelwald, openly recognising the battalion of Aurors that had infiltrated the rally, told his followers to remain calm as he revealed their presence and invited them into the circle and he described how the Aurors have fought him so mercilessly, killing his followers simply for believing.\n\nWhen a young witch, who had been motivated by Grindelwald's speech to lash out, went for her wand, the Auror killed her in response, much to the rage of Grindelwald and the rest of the attendees. Grindelwald knelt to the girl's dead body and martyred her, asking the brave young witch to be taken back to her family by her friends. While kneeling, in Grindelwald's ignorance, Newt's Niffler, having escaped its owner's suitcase, lurked near him and stole from him a vial of blood pact protecting him from Dumbledore. After getting up from the body he commanded his followers to Disapparate from the scene while he faced off against the Aurors.\n\nWhen Theseus Scamander set his men on Grindelwald, he responded by conjuring a circle of protective fire around himself, and added an enchantment designed to test the loyalty of his followers: those who entered with complete fidelity and believed in his cause would survive; those who did not, would be engulfed and perish. Vinda Rosier, Abernathy, Nagel, Credence, and Queenie joined Grindelwald into the circle and apparated to safety (bar Rosier, who remained by his side), while many of the Aurors died either fleeing or fighting when Grindelwald manipulated the fire to work as a weapon as well, sending balls and bursts of black fire towards his enemies, thereby killing them. Ultimately, about half a dozen of the fifty Aurors Theseus had brought along accepted his offer and joined him in the circle as well.\n\nThen Grindelwald, mocking Newt by asking whether he thought Dumbledore would mourn for him, battled him and Theseus Scamander. Leta Lestrange screamed to him to stop, which he did and, in response, offered her to join his ranks. She refused, however, and cast a powerful spell at Rosier that blasted to pieces his skull hookah. Leta was then engulfed by the flames, killing her, though not before telling the others to evacuate. Grindelwald let out his fury over losing such a valuable tool by unleashing the dark fire, allowing the flames to assume the form of giant bestial entities (similar to Fiendfyre), letting it run rampant, with the intent on destroying the entirety of Paris, and all of those present along with it, before he disapparated.\n\nSometime later, at Nurmengard Castle, Grindelwald spoke with Queenie Goldstein about what he must do to make Credence stop being afraid of him. Then he revealed to Credence that the baby bird he has been caring for is actually a phoenix. According to legend, a phoenix will appear to anyone of a certain wizarding family in dire need. Grindelwald then presented him with a wand, as well as mistakenly mentioning, that his brother, Albus sought to kill him through, Gellert's plan to use him to murder Albus, unknowing what truly happened that Summer in 1899, he also stated his birth name: Aurelius Dumbledore.\n\nSometime in or before 1932, Gellert wanted to meet with his past boyfriend, which they did. Gellert came late to this meeting.[26] The two distant lovers, discussed their common past and goals. There, Grindelwald expressed his distaste for the Muggles present, but he did acknowledge that they knew how to brew a good cup of tea. He informed Dumbledore of his intention to destroy their world, with or without Dumbledore's help. Gellert left after dismissing the conversation and wishing him that he enjoyed his cup of tea.[27]\n\nSometime before the 1932 International Confederation of Wizards' Supreme Mugwump election, the German Ministry of Magic ceased to be a fighting force against the Alliance and fell under the control of Gellert Grindelwald and his acolytes, under whose direction the governing body became little more than a puppet structure with which to facilitate their victory in the Global Wizarding War. Since Anton Vogel was also a secret supporter of Gellert Grindelwald, his decisions as the Supreme Mugwump may have been corrupted or influenced by Gellert Grindelwald to some extent. He may have also taken Gellert Grindelwald's suggestions and made them law in Germany.[27]\n\nIn 1932, Grindelwald wanted to campaign for the position of Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, running against the likes of Liu Tao and Vicência Santos. During elections, the Qilin, a Chinese creature, would bow to the future Mugwump. Grindelwald ordered his acolytes: Credence Barebone, Vinda Rosier and Carrow to get a Qilin in China.[27] By then, Grindelwald had appeared on a wanted poster for \"serious and vicious crimes against the wizarding world\".[28]\n\nCredence brought the Qilin calf to Nurmengard, where Grindelwald explained to him why the Qilin was so special, congratulated him and told him to get some rest. Alone in the courtyard with the Qilin, Grindelwald waited to see whether it would bow to him. When it didn't, he cut the calf's throat. The animal's blood spilled on the floor, and in its reflection, Grindelwald saw a vision of Albus Dumbledore inspecting their own blood pact. The next vision was of Newt and Theseus Scamander heading towards Hogsmeade on the trails.[27]\n\nSoon after, in Nurmengard, Grindelwald watched through the window intensely as Credence played with his own phoenix. Looking out the window, Grindelwald suddenly had a vision of Yusuf Kama heading to the castle, then of Albus in the Hog's Head Inn. When Rosier informed Grindelwald that he had been cleared by Vogel of all alleged crimes, he told her that they should prepare to leave the castle the next night, as they would have a visitor in the morning. As the phoenix flew over Credence, Rosier rose upon him and watched, asking if Credence could really kill Dumbledore. Grindelwald concluded by saying that the phoenix was probably supposed to protect Credence in connection with his assigned task, and Credence's pain was the only way he could defeat Dumbledore.[27]\n\nSoon Kama came to Nurmengard and told Grindelwald that he was his admirer. Grindelwald didn't remember Kama, so Rosier and Kama explained to him that he killed Kama's sister, Leta Lestrange. When Grindelwald remembered that Kama and Leta had a common ancestor, Kama said that was the only thing he had in common with Leta. Grindelwald guessed that it was Dumbledore who sent Kama to Nurmengard, so Kama told him that Dumbledore was afraid that Grindelwald had captured the Qilin and that he knew how he would use it, and explained that had been sent by Dumbledore to spy on Grindelwald, and asked him what report he was to pass on to Dumbledore of this visit. Grindelwald sent Credence to find Dumbledore and kill him, and ordered Queenie to check with legilimency whether Yusuf was telling the truth. Queenie had read Kama's mind and saw that he was filled with anger at Grindelwald, after the dark wizard killed Leta. Grindelwald cast a spell upon Kama with the Elder Wand, in order to supposedly erase his painful memory of his sister's death, altering his memories. Grindelwald stated that after removing the unpleasant memory, Kama was probably feeling better now and explained to him that when people allowed their anger to be consumed by it, then they become victims themselves, before allowing him to join the Alliance and inviting him inside to talk about Dumbledore.[27]\n\nGrindelwald alongside his trusty hand Rosier went to Berlin to attend the Candidates' Dinner. The fans of him crowded the streets while they drove through the German Ministry of Magic headquarters entrance. Looking out of the car's window, Grindelwald suddenly had a vision of Jacob Kowalski pointing his wand at him during dinner. Their car was surrounded by crowds, so Rosier ordered the driver to drive round to the rear entrance to the Ministry, however Grindelwald, loving the attention his fans fed him, insisted that the window be rolled down to allow him to breathe in the screams of love towards him. The dark wizard exited the car and as he emerged from the car, he was surrounded by a huge crowd of his supporters who carried him in their arms to the end of the street. Anton Vogel and some world leaders watched, and one Ministry official cried out that Grindelwald intended to start a Muggle-wizard war, which Vogel secretly supported.[27]\n\nWhile at the Candidates' Dinner at the German Ministry of Magic, Grindelwald greeted Vicência Santos by saying that her supporters were very loud, to which Santos replied that so were his fans. Later, when Credence had arrived at the Ministry, Grindelwald told Queenie to go to console him after he lost the duel with Dumbledore.  Jacob drank a glass of wine to build up the courage to approach Grindelwald, and he pulled out his coreless wand to point at him. Jacob ordered Grindelwald to release Queenie, and Grindelwald simply smirked as he remained unconcerned with Jacob's threat. The Norwegian Minister for Magic saw the altercation between the two with Jacob holding Grindelwald at wand point, and yelled \"assassin!\", prompting the dinner to break into a frenzy. Eulalie Hicks, who was with Jacob and thwarted the assassination attempt on Santos, cast a spell with her wand, making it appear as if Jacob's wand was actually magical, creating a weather storm within the hall, which made all the wizards present, including Grindelwald, exit the dinner quickly unharmed, though enjoying the foolery.[27]\n\nThe next day, when Grindelwald returned to Nurmengard with his acolytes, he gave a short speech to many of the fans gathered outside the castle. He said that their time is close, that the days of hiding are over and that the world will hear their voice, which will be deafening. Suddenly, Grindelwald turned to Kama, saying that he did not come here to betray Dumbledore and told him that Kama's pure-blood heart knew where it belongs, and told Kama that if he will believe in him, he will believe in himself, and then ordered him to prove his loyalty.\n\nShortly after, Grindelwald set out to reanimate the Qilin he earlier killed. In Nurmengard, Grindelwald stood in a pool with the dead Qilin calf, and used necromancy to resurrect the creature before the eyes of Vinda Rosier, Anton Vogel and Credence Barebone. Grindelwald told Credence to approach and watch the reanimated Qilin closely and explained that this was what made wizards special, and that concealing magical powers was not merely an affront to themselves, but also sinful. Seconds later, Grindelwald saw in the water a new vision - Dumbledore with a second Qilin calf. Grindelwald asked Credence if there was another Qilin, but he replied that he had no idea. Gellert became furious and pounced on him, saying that the boy had disappointed him twice, because he could get him into trouble, and that he did not kill Dumbledore during their fight in Berlin, though he gave him one last chance and ordered him to find the second Qilin.[27]\n\nBy attempting to use the walk of the Qilin to his advantage in the election, Grindelwald let the reanimated Qilin be brought to the ceremony, during which the Qilin bowed to him, making him successful in becoming the Supreme Mugwump, after which he immediately declared war on Muggles. Grindelwald briefly tortured Jacob Kowalski with the Cruciatus Curse before the gathered witches and wizards, but his lie was exposed by Newt Scamander and Credence Barebone, the latter of whom had discovered that he was actually Aberforth Dumbledore's son. With the help of Bunty Broadacre, Newt released the real Qilin, who bowed first to Dumbledore and then to Vicência Santos. Enraged, Grindelwald cast a green spell (possibly the Killing Curse) at Credence, only to have it blocked by the Dumbledore brothers.[27]\n\nAs a result, the blood pact between Dumbledore and Grindelwald broke, later suggested by Dumbledore to have been because he cast to protect while Grindelwald cast to kill. Transported into another dimension, Grindelwald and Dumbledore duelled briefly until they reached a stalemate, their wands at each other's heads and their hands on each other's hearts, and stopped fighting, with Dumbledore turning his back on the heartbroken Grindelwald, who bitterly reminded Dumbledore no other person but him could fully understand and love him. With everyone gathered turning on him, Grindelwald declared that he hadn't been and still wasn't their enemy, before jumping off a ledge outside the Eyrie and Disapparating.[27]\n\nEventually, the Second World War began just as Grindelwald foretold. Around this time, he declared open war upon the world, leading to the eventual ousting of Minister for Magic Hector Fawley. During these six years of utter chaos, even after stating he'd go after Gellert years before, Dumbledore hesitated to confront Grindelwald, despite the belief held by many, including quite possibly both men themselves, that he was the only wizard skilful enough to stop his former friend. The reason Dumbledore was so afraid to confront his old lover was because he couldn't bring the courage to end Grindelwald's reign alongside the fact he knew better than he did who exactly was responsible for killing Ariana and he didn't want to find out, so he stood by for more years until.\n\nIn 1945, Grindelwald and Dumbledore engaged in a duel of such legendary proportions that eyewitnesses stated that it was the greatest duel ever fought between wizards. Those who witnessed it in person, reacted with fear and awe.\n\nDespite Grindelwald's mastery of the Elder Wand, Dumbledore had ultimately triumphed over Grindelwald due to being, in his own admission, a \"shade more skillful\", thus becoming the master of the Elder Wand in the process.\n\nWith Grindelwald defeated, Dumbledore brought him to the authorities of the magical world, resulting in Grindelwald ironically being imprisoned in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, which would serve as his residence for the remainder of his life.[18]\n\nTowards the later years of his life, Grindelwald re-evaluated his actions and his revolution and it was thought that he expressed shame and remorse for the horrors he and his followers had inflicted on the magical and non-magical worlds. In 1998, fifty-three years after his defeat, Grindelwald woke to find he was not alone in his prison cell; the prison had been infiltrated by Lord Voldemort, who was searching for the Elder Wand for himself.\n\nDespite being unarmed and defenceless against the most powerful Dark wizard to have ever existed and the only Dark wizard more powerful and dangerous than himself, Grindelwald refused to give up the location of the Elder Wand, taunting Voldemort by name and mocking his desire for the wand. Growing more and more impatient, Voldemort's fury exploded when he felt his Death Eaters summoning him in tandem with Grindelwald's final taunts that he could kill him if he wanted but the Elder Wand would never be his, and thus Voldemort ended Grindelwald's life with the Killing Curse.[29]\n\nIt was speculated by Harry Potter and Dumbledore in Limbo that Grindelwald had given his life to prevent Voldemort from desecrating Dumbledore's tomb, perhaps indicating that despite all that happened, Grindelwald still retained some care and respect for his old boyfriend. Dumbledore's acknowledgement of Grindelwald's attempt to achieve redemption also indicated he believed Grindelwald was capable of changing out of some possible remaining affection for him.\n\nIn the end, Grindelwald's prediction of Voldemort never fully mastering the Elder Wand would become reality, and would cause Voldemort's own demise during his final duel with Harry Potter. Although unknown, it is highly likely that after Voldemort's final defeat and the end of the Second Wizarding War, Grindelwald's assassination was exposed to the wizarding world. It is unknown what became of his body or whether it received a proper burial or was simply disposed of.\n\nEven decades after his defeat and despite Voldemort's recent uprising, Grindelwald's reign of terror was still quite remembered, as Harry, despite being more familiar with Voldemort, counted him alongside Voldemort as the examples of the flaws of Constance Pickering's beliefs in the abolishment of the International Statute of Secrecy.\n\nAs a young man, Grindelwald had golden-blond hair and a \"merry, wild\" and \"handsome\" face. Harry Potter thought he had \"a Fred and George-ish air of triumphant trickery about him\".[30]\n\nBy the time he was middle aged, Grindelwald's hair was light blond, and he had blue eyes since he was young.[7] He also had a thin white moustache.[3]\n\nBut during his triumphant days, as a political figure, his hair grew grey and he wore it combed over, he no longer had a moustache, and his skin became somewhat wrinkled. He mostly wore suits.[27]\n\nNear the end of his life, when Voldemort found him at the top of Nurmengard, Grindelwald was severely emaciated - a frail skeletal figure with a skull-like face, great sunken eyes, wrinkled cheeks, and most of his teeth were gone.[29]\n\nGrindelwald was a driven, charismatic, determined and brilliant individual, even in his youth. Albus Dumbledore himself confessed that Grindelwald was extremely charming, so much so that it had induced the former to fall in love with him, and it was partly the reason Dumbledore had been initially blind to just how dangerous Grindelwald truly was.\n\nDuring his formative years, Grindelwald also proved himself highly intelligent, magically talented, idealistic, as well as ambitious to the point of ruthlessness, with a ferocious temper; when Aberforth Dumbledore challenged his and Albus's plans and tried to convince his brother to abandon them, Grindelwald \"lost control\" and used the Cruciatus Curse on Aberforth, showing his willingness to cause pain to people who challenged him.[18] Grindelwald resorted to physically striking Credence Barebone when he grew impatient with the boy, briefly shedding the soft and comforting facade that he adopted earlier. Later on, when Grindelwald duelled Newt Scamander, he swiftly overpowered his opponent but in his rage of Newt's interference, he fiercely unleashed bolts of lightning upon the Magizoologist in order to first incapacitate him in a painful manner. After his skull-hookah was destroyed, Grindelwald's rage prompted him to try to destroy all of Paris, remarking that he hated that city.\n\nHe also showed a sadistic streak, as during his battle against the Aurors in Paris, Grindelwald called after them \"Play by the rules. No cheating, children\", shedding his charming nature entirely. Dumbledore himself expressed horror in what Grindelwald truly was, stating that he had always (unconsciously) sensed something dangerous in him. He was also not above killing Muggle infants, although he seemingly didn't like to do it, such as after arriving in Paris, Grindelwald heard the cries of a Muggle toddler, and after a brief moment of consideration, walked out of the room and left him to be murdered by one of his acolytes.\n\nAs a revolutionary operating outside the law, Gellert Grindelwald was a man who lived in service to his ideals and, as he saw it, in humanity. Fully convinced that his revolution to bring wizardkind out of hiding and \"rise up and take [their] rightful place in the world\" above the non-magical population was truly For the Greater Good, he tirelessly endeavoured to fulfil this vision.[31] Clever and composed, as well as an extremely persuasive orator, Grindelwald had a phenomenal command of the art of public speaking, allowing him to mystify and terrify his audiences, allies and enemies alike; inspiring fanatical loyalty with each word, and gaining widespread following for his cause, followers whom he affectionately referred to as his \"brothers and sisters\" and \"friends\". When appearing in front of an audience at a rally, Grindelwald was treated as a revered celebrity, as was expected of someone with his charisma.\n\nBy the 1930s, Grindelwald had become much more serious, ruthless, harsh, reserved and aggressive, becoming more adamant than ever with his extremist ideas about the supremacy of Wizards over Muggles, to the point of killing newborn living beings just to achieve his goals, as is the case with the Qilin that he resurrected via necromancy and used to rig the Supreme Mugwump election in his favour.[29]\n\nHe did recognise, however, that while a brilliant wizard, he was not infallible, and thus Grindelwald openly confided in a carefully selected group of Acolytes that constituted the innermost circle of the army of Dark witches and wizards that he marshalled to his side. Additionally, while escaping his Incarceration Carriage and killing all of the accompanying Aurors, Grindelwald went out of his way to let Rudolph Spielman live, seemingly in order for the frightened Head of Incarceration to tell the International Confederation of Wizards how great of a threat he truly was.\n\nGrindelwald could also work very independently when he had to, however, such as when he seemingly single-handedly infiltrated the MACUSA, and was able to mimic the personality of Percival Graves for an extended period time without arousing suspicion — even when having his followers denounced as fanatics by Newton Scamander, Grindelwald was mostly unfazed and only chuckled the only time he truly aroused anyone's suspicion was when he interrogated Newt Scamander and labelled the hostless Obscurus as \"useless\", which roused Newt to angry disbelief, and appeared to baffle former Auror Tina Goldstein. Thus, Grindelwald either momentarily lapsed in his façade at this point, or incorporated his own ruthlessness and calculative nature into that of Percival Graves. Still, Grindelwald was quick enough to quell their realisation by sentencing them both to death, before the conversation could go any further.\n\nGrindelwald showed himself to be immensely charismatic — he effortlessly exploited Credence Barebone by appealing to the boy in a way nobody else tried to and offering to accept the boy into his ranks. Even after it became clear that Credence, as an Obscurial, was extremely powerful and phenomenally dangerous, Grindelwald calmly continued to try and exploit him, and was outraged when the MACUSA President opted to have her Aurors seemingly destroy him. Grindelwald was idealistic to an extreme,[32] having absolutely no complaints about the murder of hundreds of innocent people as long as that accomplished his long-term goals. Indeed, Grindelwald's idealism even prompted him to truly break his disguise in New York, expressing his disgust for being forced to hide from Muggles, and then proceeding to attack the MACUSA Aurors who had seemingly killed Credence.\n\nEven then, however, his anger was not expressed on his own behalf, but rather on that of the cause he was fighting for, which more or less spurred his life and deeds. Grindelwald spoke scornfully towards President Picquery when she insisted the Obscurial's destruction was on her orders, mocking the fact that history would note this, and that it wasn't right. Grindelwald noticeably paused before engaging the Aurors, indicating that he couldn't see any other way out of it. Throughout all of this, Grindelwald maintained a stern pride in his own skill: even as he was unexpectedly apprehended by the Aurors after Newt Scamander had attacked and subdued him from behind, Grindelwald was unfazed, and simply questioned President Picquery's ability to contain a wizard of his reputation and power. He did not even blink when faced with the President, fixing her with a fierce stare until she was out of his sight, showing his unwillingness to show fear to his enemies.\n\nAs shown at his Paris rally, Grindelwald inspired great loyalty in attendees by praising wizardkind for being \"rare souls\", and only labelled tyrannical Muggles as the true enemy, claiming that what he and his For the Greater Good revolution were actually opposing was the future Second World War that the Muggles would start, and that it was the Aurors, rather than his Acolytes who were the truly violent wizards.\n\nIndeed, Grindelwald even persuaded the peaceful, kind, and compassionate Queenie Goldstein to join his cause by promising to abolish such laws as Rappaport's Law, thus promising to bring Queenie and others a newfound freedom to love whomever they please. Grindelwald also showed a great trust in his followers, as seen by his trusting Alliance to \"spread the word\" of his ideology across the wizarding world. Grindelwald was extremely persuasive even in his time in prison, where he kept convincing his jailers to join his side, forcing the MACUSA to change his guards three times, and to cut out Grindelwald's tongue.\n\nGrindelwald was a bigoted man, who viewed Muggles as disposable creatures, fit to be nothing more than thralls in the new world he sought to create. He also placed great value in the so-called \"purity\" of magical blood, denouncing relationships with Muggles as a threat to wizarding lineages.[27] This proved he was a hypocrite, as he'd previously claimed part of his revolution was to allow wizards and witches to love whomever they chose, which seemingly included Muggles (and is how he originally won over Queenie Goldstein), but later showed his true colours in mocking and torturing Jacob Kowalski for loving a witch, and thus proving his depraved bigotry and wizarding supremacy, and that his earlier claims that he did not hate Muggles and did not regard them as lesser but other and of a different disposition to be more lies, and that he ultimately sought to oppress Muggles and likely enslave them under wizarding rule.\n\nHe demonstrated his manipulative skills and the willingness to use them for his own purposes. Judging by Aberforth Dumbledore's testimony, Grindelwald had little interest in, or patience with, those he considered beneath him. He considered Albus Dumbledore an equal, and praised the tremendous potential of the Obscurial Credence Barebone, for instance, but was dismissive of the less talented and intelligent Aberforth, the permanently damaged Ariana, and also, initially, Credence, whom Grindelwald initially callously discarded when he seemingly became no longer useful, mistakenly believing Credence to be a Squib, whom it would be impossible to magically train.\n\nIn addition, while disguised as Percival Graves, Grindelwald questioned Newt Scamander, who he seemingly found to be an average wizard, in an interrogation as to why Dumbledore would have such faith in Newt, indicating an interest in further understanding both Dumbledore and Newt's abilities. Grindelwald's dismissal of Credence as a Squib suggested that Grindelwald, in his (somewhat arrogant) awareness of his own brilliance, was so secure in his own Seer judgement as to having grown a weakness for jumping to conclusions. Grindelwald was also criticised by Newt for deeming magical creatures too simple to raise his interest, being only turned towards more complex forms of magic, unaware that one such creature, a Niffler, actually stole his blood pact vial.\n\nHowever, Grindelwald was ultimately not a complete amoral man, as shown by how he was capable of feeling remorse for past wrongdoings and the fact that his lengths he was willing to go to reach his goals were fuelled by ambition and a fanatical sense of self-purpose, rather than evil intent. Grindelwald's decision to stun, not kill Gregorovitch, when he acquired the Elder Wand from the latter, and also not bother finishing off Porpentina Goldstein even though he could have easily done so, hints at a willingness not to kill simply as a matter of course. However, this might have been a calculated decision, perhaps considering that people were more likely to give credence to Gregorovitch's claims that he'd had the Elder Wand if he was murdered, as that was the traditional method of passing it on,[33] while his sparing of Tina was likely because Grindelwald didn't view her worth the time he could instead have used to try to persuade Credence.\n\nAfter all, Grindelwald killed his own pet Chupacabra Antonio after deeming him \"too needy\", he killed numerous Aurors while escaping the MACUSA, he ruthlessly killed many people who did not display enough loyalty to him to enter his circle of blue fire (disintegrating his own inadequately loyal Acolyte Krall), although while he did not spare Krall, he sombrely closed his eyes, indicating some regret and remorse at seeing Krall painfully die as he tried to reach out to Grindelwald.\n\nIn addition to also offering the Aurors who attacked him a chance to join his army rather than just simply immediately massacring all of them and when Leta Lestrange asked him to stop, Grindelwald seemed rather willing to spare Newt and Theseus had Leta joined him, having stopped his attempts to burn them alive and only having the black flames thwart them instead of killing them, and Grindelwald even had no objections to Vinda Rosier and Carrow murdering a family of Non-Magiques, including their infant son, to secure a temporary headquarters for the Acolytes in Paris, although he seemed a bit reluctant in killing the baby and chose not to witness his acolytes kill him.\n\nProof of his lesser dark nature, when compared to that of Lord Voldemort, was how that while Voldemort was completely without empathy and unable to feel remorse, Grindelwald seemed to genuinely pity Credence for the greatly unjust treatment he was exposed to not only by his own mother, but also by the magical community, as displayed by his rage of Credence being seemingly destroyed by MACUSA. He later expressed sympathy for how Mary Lou Barebone had nearly destroyed her own adopted son.\n\nAfter many years of imprisonment in Nurmengard, as he sat alone in his former fortress, Grindelwald was reportedly known for having contemplated his past misdeeds and felt remorse and shame for the horrifying things he had committed during his attempted rise to power over the magical and non-magical worlds. This clearly influenced his decision to hide the location of the Elder Wand from Voldemort, despite being confronted and certainly about to die at the hands of the only Dark wizard more powerful and dangerous than himself, which Dumbledore acknowledged to be out of a desire to achieve a shred of redemption. This remorse and redemption is in stark contrast to Voldemort, who showed not an ounce of remorse for the countless atrocities he committed.\n\nGrindelwald was also proven to be capable of fear, judging from the fact that he fled in fear of his life after the intense duel between himself, Dumbledore, and Aberforth that resulted in Ariana's death, and how he resorted to being more cautious around Credence upon realising that he was the Obscurial (in the knowledge of how dangerous and volatile Obscurials were). He never attempted to extend his power to Britain for fear of facing Dumbledore (most likely due to the circumstances of their last encounter, and the fact that he recognised how powerful Dumbledore was), but notably also due to their blood pact making Grindelwald unable to directly confront Dumbledore.\n\nNot only does this suggest that Grindelwald was actually capable of contemplating Dumbledore being equivalently powerful or dangerous as himself, but that he was also capable of respecting Dumbledore. It would seem that despite Dumbledore being the cause of his downfall, Grindelwald still genuinely considered Dumbledore his friend in the end to an extent, as Harry Potter noted Grindelwald had also intended to prevent Dumbledore's tomb from being desecrated when he lied on the Elder Wand. It should also be noted that despite his claims of wanting to unleash Credence upon Dumbledore, Grindelwald was never known to attack Britain even after he had Credence, as Britain was always acknowledged as the only place safe from Grindelwald, which seemed to imply Grindelwald, even at his worst, did not want Albus dead unless he had interfered in his plans.\n\nWhen trapped and unarmed in Nurmengard, facing certain death at the hands of the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, Grindelwald was openly defiant towards him, even mocking, goading Voldemort into killing him by saying that he welcomed death, but that it would not \"bring him what [he] sought\", saying there is so much he \"doesn't understand\". Indeed, he seemed to exhibit a grotesque remnant of the \"merry, wild\" temperament of his youth. Grindelwald's last words consisted of the dressing-down of Voldemort, and a rather enthusiastic outlook on \"the next great adventure\", all of which seems clear in its connection to his old flame, Albus Dumbledore.\n\nGrindelwald was an outstandingly talented wizard even in his youth while still a student. As an adult, Grindelwald became a very powerful and accomplished wizard and was admired and feared by many others of outstanding magical talent. Indeed, it is not without good reason that Grindelwald went down in history as among the most dangerous Dark wizards of all time, maintaining the top spot for a long period of time until the arrival of Lord Voldemort, who earned the top title on the list a generation later. Indeed, even Albus Dumbledore, who was considered by many to be the greatest wizard of all time and whose past friendship with him meant that he knew Grindelwald better than arguably any living person, acknowledged Grindelwald to be evenly matched, with Dumbledore describing himself as perhaps a shade more skilful. As a former master of the Elder Wand, Grindelwald's already formidable abilities were further enhanced by the artefact's legendary powers, allowing him to perform spells that would be more powerful than otherwise magically possible.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore first met Grindelwald when he was seventeen. They were introduced by Grindelwald's great aunt, Bathilda Bagshot. They got along almost instantly, according to Bagshot. They had much in common, including the quest for the Deathly Hallows and edgy ideals about the structure of a wizard-led society. Eventually, their relationship developed further into one that went beyond mere friendship, one that was romantic, intense and passionate, as well as sexual. The two young lovers made plans to find the Deathly Hallows and lead a wizarding revolution with themselves as leaders, but Albus neglected his younger siblings, Aberforth and Ariana, as a result. When Aberforth confronted the pair over this, Grindelwald lost his temper and attacked Aberforth. Albus rushed forward to defend his brother, and during the duel Ariana was killed. Grindelwald fled, his relationship with Albus over, although their feelings for one another would not subside.\n\nOver the next few decades, Grindelwald caused considerable havoc on behalf of his revolution but due to a past Blood Pact between them, neither Grindelwald or Dumbledore could directly fight one another, which frustrated Grindelwald as it prevented him from attacking Britain, which was essentially Dumbledore's protectorate and operates on behalf of in his duties outside of Hogwarts. Grindelwald  acknowledged and respected the extraordinary magical and intellectual capabilities of his former lover, noting Dumbledore far outclassed any of his followers and with his equal intelligence and magical capability, he had the ability to subtly intervene anyway in his revolution, and this respect made Dumbledore the only wizard Grindelwald was wary of. Grindelwald feared Dumbledore as he recognised that Dumbledore would be capable of defeating him. This made Grindelwald seek out Credence Barebone in order to be able to use him as a weapon in case Dumbledore attacked him.\n\nDespite this, however, Grindelwald remained interested in and deep down still in love with Dumbledore, his taking time to question Newt regarding why Dumbledore would be fond of him while disguised as Graves and seeming reluctance to stop questioning him and sentence him and Tina to death after making a mistake, later being clearly spiteful that Newt was Dumbledore's favourite. He also was willing to reach out to him and try to make him stop opposing him, even lightly flirting with him in a restaurant. Eventually, however, their blood pact was abolished when Dumbledore shielded Credence from his spell, and they finally fought one another. The duel ended in a stalemate, and Grindelwald attempted to reach out once more, but Dumbledore had given up on him completely and solemnly left him, clearly devastating Grindelwald, who bitterly asked who would love Dumbledore now. He still attempted to justify himself with Dumbledore by saying he never saw Dumbledore as an enemy, but they would presumably continue to oppose one another until finally in 1945, they had a final legendary duel, one to be marked as perhaps the greatest ever fought between two wizards. However, Dumbledore's greater power and skill ultimately defeated Grindelwald despite his mastery of the Elder Wand during their duel, and Grindelwald was imprisoned in his own prison, Nurmengard.\n\nMany years later, in 1998, Grindelwald refused to give any information to Lord Voldemort about the Elder Wand despite the fact that he was imprisoned, wandless, and face-to-face with the only Dark wizard ever considered more dangerous than himself. This seems to indicate that Grindelwald no longer held the views of those who practised the Dark Arts and had felt remorse for his actions. It was speculated by Harry Potter that Grindelwald had given his life to prevent Voldemort from desecrating Dumbledore's tomb, perhaps indicating that despite all that happened, Grindelwald still respected and loved his old friend and lover. Dumbledore also clearly still loved Gellert to the end, being clearly grateful that Gellert tried to stop his tomb from being desecrated and acknowledging he truly hoped that by sparing Gellert, he would have come to see the wrong of his ways and wish to repent.\n\nAberforth disliked Grindelwald immensely, as he was Albus's friend after Hogwarts, and Grindelwald was dismissive of him due to how much he was outshined by Albus. While Aberforth was taking care of Ariana, Albus and Grindelwald were planning to enslave the Muggles. As the two boys were planning to travel around the world, they also planned to take Ariana with them. Aberforth opposed them, telling them that he would be able to take care of Ariana once more.\n\nGrindelwald became very angry and used the Cruciatus Curse on Aberforth; Albus then defended his brother and the three boys had a duel, in which Ariana was accidentally killed. Grindelwald escaped and left the country. Aberforth retained bitter memories towards Grindelwald for many years after their fateful encounter, and when he recounted the events that led to his sister's death Harry noted the \"positively dangerous\" look that came over his face when Grindelwald's name was mentioned.[34]\n\nGrindelwald was dismissive of the permanently damaged Ariana yet was willing to tolerate her to an extent for his old friend, allowing her to be brought in his and Dumbledore's plans for revolution. However, Ariana tragically died when interfering in Grindelwald's duel with Albus and Aberfoth, and Grindelwald fled immediately.\n\nVinda Rosier was arguably Grindelwald's most trusted and loyal acolyte, therefore being the Dark wizard's anonymous lieutenant. Grindelwald trusted her with consoling Queenie Goldstein to soften her up for Grindelwald to convince her to his side, and also with keeping his skull-hookah, displaying his deep trust for Vinda. When Vinda spoke of eliminating non-magic people and how they would flee their cities in their millions, Grindelwald told her that they don't say such things out loud, that they only want freedom to be themselves and that they wouldn't eliminate all non-magic people as the beast of burden would always be necessary.\n\nVinda was still Grindelwald's sergeant when he tasked her and the other acolytes with capturing a Qilin from Newt Scamander's hands in the Tianzi Mountains in China so that Grindelwald could be elected Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards.\n\nRosier later travelled to the German Ministry of Magic, where she showed her loyalty to her master by burning Vicência Santos's banners alongside the other members of the Alliance. It was Vinda who later personally informed Grindelwald that he had been absolved of all the criminal allegations against him by Anton Vogel. When Grindelwald told her that they should prepare to leave Nurmengard the following night, Vinda asked Grindelwald, who was carefully watching Credence and his phoenix from the window, if Credence could kill Dumbledore, and Grindelwald only replied that the phoenix was to protect Credence during his fight with Dumbledore, and that the boy's pain would give him strength so that Barebone would defeat Dumbledore.\n\nRosier later drove with Grindelwald to the Candidates' Dinner at the German Ministry of Magic. When the car they were riding in was surrounded by a crowd of Grindelwald's supporters, Vinda was clearly concerned, although Grindelwald was not bothered at all and got out of the car to drown in the embrace of his supporters, despite Vinda's clear objections.\n\nGrindelwald trusted Rosier enough to be one of the few acolytes present when Grindelwald revived a dead Qilin that he would use to win the election for Supreme Mugwump. Vinda also witnessed Grindelwald's outburst of rage towards Credence when he discovered through his vision that Newt and Dumbledore had a second Qilin.\n\nVinda also accompanied Grindelwald to the elections in the Eyrie in Bhutan, where she and the other acolytes followed Queenie Goldstein on his orders, who was caught by them with Jacob Kowalski. When the revived Qilin bowed to Grindelwald and Grindelwald was named the new Supreme Mugwump, Rosier took Kowalski's fake wand on Grindelwald's orders, showing contempt, and handed it to her master, while he exposed the No-Maj in a bad light and began torturing him with the Cruciatus Curse in front of everyone. Vinda also witnessed how Newt revealed the second Qilin, exposing Grindelwald's deception and forcing the Dark wizard and his henchmen to retreat. However, both Grindelwald and Vinda managed to escape before they could be captured by the wizards present.\n\nGrindelwald once trusted Krall enough to make him one of his acolytes but at some point, he began to sense Krall's loyalty had began to waver and had no qualms confronting him over it, bluntly asking whether he would stand by him as he collected Credence to use against Albus Dumbledore and not looking convinced when Krall tried to assure him. When Krall tried crossing Grindelwald's Protego Diabolica, he died due to his inadequate loyalty.\n\nGrindelwald was reassuring and tender with Credence, giving him the affection the boy had craved and been denied all his life; however, this was mainly in order to use him to find the Obscurus and he coldly tossed him aside when he thought he had obtained his goal, believing him to be no more than a Squib. Considering Credence unteachable in the ways of magic as a result despite promising to teach him previously, Grindelwald told the boy that the death of his mother was his reward instead, although at least he did not just kill Credence to cover any traces. When it was revealed soon after that Credence was in fact the Obscurial, Grindelwald was surprised but quickly recovered and reassumed his old treatment of Credence and tried to recruit him to help expose the North American wizarding community, and create a weapon against Albus Dumbledore.\n\nHe continued trying to appeal to Credence, telling him that he wanted him to be free from hiding and repressing his power, until he vanished after being attacked by many Aurors. This resulted in Grindelwald furiously lashing out at MACUSA for what he truly felt was an act of injustice on a fellow magical individual, going so far as to drop his disguise as a faithful Auror in a passionate speech against the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy and Muggles. As such, because of his magical heritage, Grindelwald showed genuine empathy for how badly and unjustly Credence was treated, not only being upset and resentful of how Picquery had coldly ordered Credence to be destroyed just because he threatened to expose wizardkind, but also pitying how Mary Lou nearly destroyed her own adopted son just because he was magical.\n\nUpon learning that Credence had survived and was searching for his true heritage, Grindelwald sought the young man out, and gave him the freedom to come to his rally at the Lestrange family Mausoleum, acting as if he was close to Credence just as he did with Graves, although he did it with even more kindness, saying he only wanted what was best for Credence. At that rally, Grindelwald's persuasive speech induced the desperate Credence to finally choose his side in the Global Wizarding War by passing through the loyalty testing blue fire and joining Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes. Grindelwald was true to his word this time, finally giving Credence a wand, and revealing the young man's birth name: Aurelius Dumbledore, while also encouraging Credence by saying together they would change the world, seemingly being successful in having the latter convinced in breaking the Blood Pact and killing Albus Dumbledore.\n\nCredence subsequently became a devoted acolyte of Grindelwald, but his allegiance faltered after he duelled Dumbledore and learned of his true heritage as Aberforth's son. Credence's failure to kill Dumbledore soured Grindelwald towards him as did his attempt to lie about the number of Qilin. Credence ultimately turned on Grindelwald completely, helping Newt to expose his plot at The walk of the Qilin. Enraged, Grindelwald tried to murder the weakened and dying Credence, but he was blocked by Albus and Aberforth, resulting in the blood pact breaking.\n\nUltimately, Grindelwald never cared about Aurelius at all. The young man had only ever been a weapon Grindelwald wanted to exploit to kill Dumbledore without breaking the blood pact. Even more despicable, Grindelwald had stoked Aurelius' rage, swayed him to embrace his pain and make it his power despite knowing that an Obscurial like him needed love in order to save them from their Obscurus. Instead, Grindelwald imperilled Aurelius' well-being rather than actually help him be saved from the Obscurus that would ultimately kill him, proving that Aurelius was never anything more than a pawn to Grindelwald, and one that would inevitably be disposed of one way or another.\n\nGrindelwald, while disguised as Percival Graves, met the gifted Magizoologist in New York in 1926. Grindelwald, not finding Newt's unique personality or magical skills impressive, questioned him on why Dumbledore would be fond of him. Newt at one point was outraged and disgusted when Grindelwald implied Newt was serving the Greater Good and coldly told him he was not one of the his acolytes, which actually impressed the Dark wizard, causing him to smirk. He seemed to have been interested in talking more about it but upon having made a slip up of how he considered the Obscurus without a host useless, he ultimately did everything in his power to have Newt take the blame for the Obscurial deaths and nearly had him executed, albeit reluctantly, although it remained unknown what he would have done to Newt had the conversation continued.\n\nGrindelwald also revealed to Tina Goldstein that Newt had been expelled from Hogwarts for nearly killing a student in an incident involving a magical beast. When Newt intervened in Grindelwald's plan to acquire Credence Barebone, Grindelwald dropped all pretence and ferociously attacked Newt, duelling and even torturing him with lightning spells in a rage. Newt managed to capture Grindelwald by use of a Swooping Evil and revealed his true identity to MACUSA, but before being carried off Grindelwald turned to Newt and said mysteriously \"Will we die, just a little?\", possibly as a message for Dumbledore due to his knowing Newt's closeness to Dumbledore.\n\nGrindelwald encountered Newt in Paris a year later and tried to kill him and his allies, mocking Newt whether Dumbledore would mourn for him. Newt, however, survived the battle and out of hatred towards Grindelwald for having murdered Leta Lestrange, gave Dumbledore the blood pact vial, which would doom Grindelwald many years later. Grindelwald's actions towards Newt seemed to suggest he hated the younger man not only because he had thwarted him once, but also because he is infuriatingly jealous of Dumbledore's admiration of Newt's selfless qualities. It appears that Grindelwald, ever the narcissist, wanted to remain the centre of attention and admiration in his former lover's mind in spite of his Dark deeds, their now opposing views, and Grindelwald's own stated desire to have Dumbledore killed.\n\nGrindelwald and Newt met again in 1932 in Bhutan during the walk of the Qilin ceremony, where the Dark wizard's revived Qilin bowed to him, fraudulently winning him the election for Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards. Newt, however, revealed his lie by retrieving the second, living Qilin out of the suitcase, which bowed to Vicência Santos.\n\nGrindelwald had interacted with Tina while disguised as Percival Graves, and held a low opinion of her, due to Tina's prim personality. During Newt's interrogation, he sentenced him and Tina as well to death for her participation without hesitation. Grindelwald was later very furious at Tina for distracting him from Credence, telling her angrily she always turned up when he least wanted her, implying she may have intervened with his attempts to find the Obscurus previously, and while he did not bother to finish her, he threw a car at her without hesitation, thus beating her without using lethal force but still endangering her life.\n\nA year later, while convincing Queenie to join his ranks, Grindelwald painted Tina in a negative light by telling Queenie that it wasn't her fault for having an Auror as a sister. He then ruthlessly tried to burn Tina alive with his cursed flames and would have succeeded had Leta not intervened.\n\nGrindelwald had interacted with Queenie in Paris. When she met him, Queenie was clearly frightened due to his reputation as the greatest dark wizard of the age, and drew her wand in his direction nervously. While he resented Tina, Grindelwald did not extend this to Queenie and calmly manipulated her to join his ranks, taking advantage of Queenie's loving, altruistic, and peaceful personality, by promising her that his For the Greater Good revolution would fight against the future Second World War, and would bring about an era where others would be free to love whomever they pleased.\n\nThus, during the rally in the Lestrange family Mausoleum, Queenie passed through the loyalty-testing circle of blue fire, officially joining Grindelwald. After escape from Paris, Grindelwald took Queenie with him to his Austrian residence of Nurmengard Castle, and asked her advice about how to appeal to Credence's current feelings, showing he acknowledged Queenie's expertise in handling the emotions of others.\n\nQueenie later became remorseful over her actions and attempted to warn Jacob to leave The walk of the Qilin without success. Grindelwald denounced Queenie's desire to love whoever she pleased and tortured Jacob in front of her, ignoring Queenie's pleas for her to stop.\n\nJacob first encountered Grindelwald in New York when he arrested Kowalski, Newt Scamander and Tina Goldstein in MACUSA, posing as Percival Graves.\n\nWhen they met again in Paris a year later, Grindelwald convinced Queenie to join the Alliance, assuring her that in a new, better world she would be able to love Jacob openly, while he later tried to kill Jacob in the Lestrange Mausoleum with magical flames, but he was saved by Tina.\n\nKowalski was devastated by the loss of Queenie, but he attempted to get Queenie back and joined Dumbledore's first army to do so. When he, Newt, Theseus and Lally reached the German Ministry of Magic and learned that Grindelwald had been cleared of the crimes he was accused of, Kowalski did not hide his anger.\n\nLater, he and Lally went to the German Ministry of Magic for a Candidates' Dinner, where Grindelwald soon arrived with Queenie and the other acolytes. Jacob called out to Queenie, but to no avail, as she did not respond to his pleas. When Queenie went outside, Jacob drank something stronger, then approached Grindelwald, pointed his fake wand at him and ordered him to let Queenie go, but Grindelwald did not care and only laughed. Jacob was however called an assassin and a commotion broke out, so Lally quickly saved Jacob and escaped from the German Ministry of Magic with him.\n\nJacob later travelled to the Eyrie in Bhutan, where the elections for Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards were being held, which Grindelwald wanted to win. Jacob managed to find Queenie, but they were discovered by Grindelwald's henchmen. When Grindelwald was elected the new Supreme Mugwump, Jacob's wand was taken away and Kowalski was brought to the forefront. Grindelwald painted Jacob in a bad light, then declared war on the Muggles and began torturing him with the Cruciatus Curse. Eventually, Newt exposed Grindelwald's lie, and Vicência Santos became the new Supreme Mugwump, while Grindelwald escaped.\n\nAs Grindelwald began to amass his army and launch devastating attacks across Europe, Theseus was tasked as an Auror to track down the Dark wizard, but to no avail. In 1926, Theseus corresponded with Percival Graves about strange occurrences in New York, unaware that he was actually speaking to Grindelwald himself.\n\nLess than a year later, Theseus met Grindelwald in person in Paris at the Lestrange Mausoleum, when the Dark wizard organised a rally for his supporters, which was interrupted by the arrival of the Aurors. Grindelwald then painted the Aurors in a bad light, saying that they had killed many of his followers, as well as tortured him in New York. When Grindelwald sent his supporters away, Theseus ordered the Aurors to arrest the Dark wizard, but he conjured a circle of protective fire around himself. Grindelwald also controlled the deadly flames in such a way that it killed many of the Aurors, and some of them joined him out of fear. At one point, Grindelwald tried to kill Newt, and Theseus did not want to let his brother be hurt and wanted to protect him, so Grindelwald attacked them both. However, they were saved by Leta Lestrange, Theseus's fiancée, who sacrificed herself so that the Scamander brothers and the rest could escape the mausoleum.\n\nTheseus was distraught over the loss of Leta, but soon decided to join Dumbledore's first army, where Dumbledore presented him with a plan to defeat Grindelwald, who wanted to be elected the new Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards.\n\nTheseus, however, could not continue the mission, as at one point he was captured by Grindelwald's men in the German Ministry of Magic and imprisoned in the Erkstag, so Newt had to rescue him. However, when he and Newt miraculously managed to survive and return to Hogwarts, Theseus did not hide his amusement when he learned that Jacob had been labelled an assassin for attempting to attack Grindelwald during the Candidates' Dinner at the German Ministry of Magic. Theseus, however, was shocked when he learned that Grindelwald had been allowed to run for Supreme Mugwump.\n\nTheseus later travelled with the others to the Eyrie in Bhutan, where the elections for the Supreme Mugwump were taking place. Theseus witnessed Newt's successful exposure of Grindelwald's deception, allowing Vicência Santos to become the new Supreme Mugwump. Theseus, along with the others present, attempted to capture Grindelwald, but to no avail, as the Dark wizard escaped again.\n\nLeta met Grindelwald at her family's mausoleum in Paris when he organised a rally for his supporters. At one point, a fight broke out, during which Grindelwald tried to kill Newt and Theseus. Leta could not watch this and yelled to Grindelwald to stop it. Grindelwald recognised Leta, and despite her sad past, appreciated her courage and offered her to join the Alliance, telling her to \"go home\". However, Leta attacked him, giving the Scamander brothers and the rest of their friends time to escape. Grindelwald was furious and murdered her in retaliation, much to Newt and Theseus's despair.\n\nYusuf met Grindelwald during a rally of his supporters at the Lestrange Mausoleum in Paris. When a fight broke out, Grindelwald attempted to kill Yusuf as well, and Kama himself later witnessed the death of Leta Lestrange, his half-sister. When Grindelwald conjured fire monsters and sent them to destroy Paris, Yusuf helped stop them by casting a General Counter-Spell along with Newt, Theseus, Tina, and Nicolas Flamel.\n\nYusuf was distraught by Leta's death and soon decided to join Dumbledore's first army. His mission was to infiltrate Grindelwald's army of followers in order to distract the Dark wizard from the actions of Newt and the others. When Kama arrived at Nurmengard, Grindelwald was certain that Kama had been sent by Dumbledore. With the help of Queenie, who was skilled in Legilimency, Grindelwald discovered that Kama was filled with rage at him for killing Leta, so the Dark wizard removed the memory of Leta's death from him. Grindelwald thought that Kama would certainly feel better after having the memory removed, and added that one must not let oneself be consumed by anger, as then one becomes the victim, and invited Yusuf into the castle to talk about Dumbledore.\n\nKama later accompanied Grindelwald along with other members of the Alliance to the Candidates' Dinner at the German Ministry of Magic, where he witnessed Jacob attempting to attack Grindelwald.\n\nAs Grindelwald gave a short speech to his followers gathered at Nurmengard, he suddenly turned to Kama, saying that Yusuf had not come to betray Dumbledore at all and ordered him to believe in Grindelwald's cause and prove his loyalty.\n\nLater, Kama arrived with a group of Grindelwald's supporters at the Supreme Mugwump election in the Eyrie in Bhutan, where Theseus and Lally Hicks were waiting for him. Kama almost immediately attacked the group of Grindelwald's men he was leading, and then went with Theseus and Lally to the Eyrie. When Grindelwald's lie was exposed by Newt and Grindelwald was forced to retreat, Yusuf was one of the wizards who tried to capture the Dark wizard, but was unsuccessful as he escaped.\n\nIt is unknown if the two had ever met prior; however, by the time Voldemort visited Grindelwald in his Nurmengard prison in 1998, Grindelwald seemed to know all about him, and claimed that he knew that Voldemort would one day visit him to seek out the Elder Wand. Despite Grindelwald's past revolution to dominate Muggles and status as one of the most powerful Dark wizards to have ever lived, considered second only to Voldemort himself, he seemed to have no praise or respect for Grindelwald, and Voldemort likely saw him as an inferior and treated him as merely another person to interrogate in his search for the wand.\n\nGrindelwald likewise showed no fear toward the Dark Lord, and laughed, scornfully challenging Voldemort to kill him and using the younger wizard's chosen feared name as a mockery of his great power, much to the latter's fury. Grindelwald refused to tell Voldemort the Elder Wand's location and taunted him by telling him that he would never be able to master the wand. Furious at his inability to gain information from the former master of the Elder Wand, Voldemort murdered Grindelwald with the Killing Curse.\n\nUltimately, Grindelwald's prediction of Voldemort never fully mastering the Elder Wand would become reality, and would cause Voldemort's own demise during his final duel with Harry Potter. However, in an alternate timeline created by Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy where Cedric Diggory joined the Death Eaters in spite of being humiliated during the Triwizard Tournament and killed Neville Longbottom during the Battle of Hogwarts, Grindelwald's prediction would become false, and Voldemort would kill Harry and successfully master the Elder Wand's allegiance while also conquering the wizarding world.",
