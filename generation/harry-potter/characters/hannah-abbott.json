  "content": "Hannah Abbott (b. 1979/1980)[1] was a witch and a member of the Abbott family. In September 1991, she started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Hufflepuff House.[7] Hannah was in the same year as the famous Harry Potter.[7]\n\nIn her fifth year, she became both a prefect and a member of Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter. In 1996, Hannah was pulled out of school after her mother was murdered by Death Eaters, but she returned the following year and was once again a member of the D.A. She fought in the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May, 1998.\n\nLater in life, Hannah married fellow classmate Neville Longbottom and became landlady of the Leaky Cauldron, which the couple lived above. She eventually trained as a healer and applied for the job of Matron at Hogwarts.[3]\n\nHannah was born in Great Britain or Ireland in 1979 or 1980.[1] She was a member of the pure-blood wizarding Abbott family that was one of the so-called Sacred Twenty-Eight,[12] though she herself was a half-blood,[2] indicating she also had some Muggle heritage.\n\nHannah began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on 1 September 1991, along with Harry Potter.[7]\n\nSince Hannah's surname, Abbott, was the first alphabetically, she was the first new student in her year to be sorted into her house during the Start-of-Term Feast. She was Sorted into Hufflepuff House, along with other new students Ernie Macmillan, Susan Bones, and Justin Finch-Fletchley.[7] She shared a dormitory with her fellow Hufflepuff classmates; Megan Jones, Susan Bones, and others.\n\nIn 1992, Hannah's second year, when the Chamber of Secrets had been reopened, Hannah was one of the many students who believed that Harry Potter was the Heir of Slytherin after it became known that he was a Parselmouth. She was initially sceptical, saying that Harry 'always seemed so nice', but was eventually convinced by her friend Ernie Macmillan that Harry was the one that had attacked Muggle-born students around Hogwarts, including her housemate and friend Justin Finch-Fletchley, which didn't go down well with Hannah, unsettling her.[13]\n\nWhen Hermione was attacked by the Basilisk, Ernie and Hannah apologised, knowing Harry would never harm her. Ernie asked Harry if he believed that Draco Malfoy was the Heir of Slytherin, to which Harry replied with a quick no, causing both Ernie and Hannah to stare.[14] It was later revealed that Malfoy was not the culprit after Harry defeated Tom Riddle, destroying his diary horcrux and Slytherin's basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets. Hannah was present at the Leaving Feast, after all the students who were petrified were returned to their normal state.[15]\n\nIn 1993, her third year, when news got out that Sirius Black had escaped from Azkaban, Hannah held the belief that Black could transform himself into a flowering shrub to avoid detection, and would tell this theory to anyone who would listen.[16]\n\nEven though her theory of transforming into a shrub was incorrect, Sirius Black did in fact use a transformation to avoid detection and escape Azkaban; however, his transformation was into the form of a dog. Hannah's belief that Sirius could transform into a flowering shrub was likely to have originated from her liking of Herbology and the Professor of Herbology, Pomona Sprout, who was her Head of House.\n\nDuring 1994, Hannah's fourth year, Hannah helped collect Bubotuber pus in Herbology, which Madam Pomfrey used for treating acne to prevent students from taking more desperate measures. Hannah noted that Eloise Midgen had tried to curse her pimples off.[17]\n\nThis year, Hogwarts hosted the Triwizard Tournament and Hannah's fellow Hufflepuff Cedric Diggory was one of the Triwizard finalists. Hannah fully supported him during the tournament's tasks, as he was also in Hufflepuff. Hannah was among the many Hufflepuffs who were displeased when Harry appeared to be usurping Cedric's rightful place, by becoming the second Hogwarts champion during the Triwizard Tournament, and she showed support only for her fellow Hufflepuff.[18] This was because Hufflepuff never received much attention, and she, along with many others, felt Harry was taking the glory away from Diggory.[18] To show her support, she wore a Support CEDRIC DIGGORY — the REAL Hogwarts Champion! badge that was able to change to read POTTER STINKS.[19]\n\nAgain, as in her second year, Hannah spent a lot of her free time revising in the Great Hall with Ernie Macmillan, presumably studying for her O.W.L.s which were coming up the following year. The two of them also attended at least one Hogsmeade weekend and were swapping Chocolate Frog Cards at a table at The Three Broomsticks.[18]\n\nLater in this same year, Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort, and Harry won the Triwizard Tournament, but this did not matter to Hannah, as Cedric's death made the winner rather irrelevant. Hannah was then presumably amongst the students that believed Harry Potter's claims that Lord Voldemort had indeed returned, and that the Second Wizarding War had really broken out.\n\nIn 1995, her fifth year, Hannah was made a prefect for Hufflepuff House, along with Ernie Macmillan.[5] Shortly after the beginning of term, it became apparent that Dolores Umbridge was not going to be teaching practical means of Defence Against the Dark Arts, and Hannah decided to join Dumbledore's Army, a secret Defence Against the Dark Arts group started by Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.[20]\n\nShe was also one of the minority who believed that Lord Voldemort was back, likely due to the fact that Cedric Diggory, a student of her house, was claimed by Harry Potter to have been murdered by the Dark Lord in the previous year.\n\nThe pressure of studying for her O.W.L.s had definitely got to Hannah, and she broke down in tears during a Herbology class, after claiming to be too stupid to take her exams. She was then taken to the Hospital Wing, where Madam Pomfrey treated her with a Calming Draught.[21] Despite being treated, Hannah still managed to let pressure get the better of her and during her Transfiguration practical exam, she accidentally multiplied a ferret into a flock of flamingos.[22]\n\nHannah made it through the rest of her exams, and, approaching the end of the year, Hannah was one of the D.A. members who aided Harry when he was attacked by Draco Malfoy, Gregory Goyle, and Vincent Crabbe at the end of their fifth year, proving her loyalty and friendship still to Dumbledore's Army, even after its initial purpose had been rendered redundant.[23]\n\nAt some point within the school year, she was a Charms Tutor, providing a service to fellow classmates to teach them charms.[6]\n\nIn 1996, Hannah returned to her sixth year at Hogwarts. Early on during her sixth year, Hannah was told during a Herbology lesson that her mother, Mrs Abbott, had been murdered earlier in the day, presumably by Death Eaters. As a result of this, Hannah was subsequently pulled out of Hogwarts and did not return for the rest of the year.[9] She was not in school at the time of Headmaster Albus Dumbledore's demise at the hands of Severus Snape.[24] It is possible, as a result of missing most of her sixth year, Hannah would be required to retake the year's courses.\n\nHannah was compelled to return to Hogwarts in 1997, as Lord Voldemort had taken over the Ministry of Magic and attendance at Hogwarts had become mandatory for all pure or half-blood students; Muggle-borns had to go before a Muggle-Born Registration Commission prior to being admitted to Hogwarts. It is possible, as Hannah had missed her previous year of education, she would be made to resit the year, making her technically a sixth year student once again.\n\nHannah was present on the train when it was stormed by Death Eaters in search of Harry Potter. She also witnessed fellow classmate Neville stand up to them and inform them that Harry was not aboard the train.[25]\n\nWhilst back at Hogwarts, Hannah became a member of the revived Dumbledore's Army, now operating under the leadership of Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, and Ginny Weasley in the absence of Harry, Ron and Hermione. United once again, Dumbledore's Army continued to train students in battle and defence, and the group ran riot around Hogwarts, making the life for new Headmaster Severus Snape and Death Eaters Amycus Carrow and Alecto Carrow difficult.[26]\n\nWhen Harry Potter returned to Hogwarts on 1 May 1998, Hannah stayed at the school and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. She battled against Death Eaters and Lord Voldemort. Initially, she was part of the group of students led by Fred and George Weasley. Hannah's group was charged with defending the secret passages into Hogwarts from invading Death Eaters.[27]\n\nDuring the second stage of the battle, she witnessed Voldemort and his Death Eaters gloating over Harry's 'dead body'. She was then forced into the Great Hall, along with the other defenders of Hogwarts. Harry saved her and Seamus Finnigan with a Shield Charm when Lord Voldemort sent a curse their way. Hannah stood witness to Harry's final defeat of Voldemort, thus surviving the Second Wizarding War.[28]\n\nSome time before 2014, Hannah married her former classmate and leader of the student rebellion, Neville Longbottom. She became the landlady at the Leaky Cauldron, replacing Tom, and the couple lived together above the pub. Neville's students considered the fact they lived above the pub \"cool\".[29]\n\nHannah eventually gave up being landlady of the Leaky Cauldron and decided to train as a Healer. She applied for the job of Matron at Hogwarts. On 8 July 2014, Rita Skeeter scathingly reported that she and Neville enjoyed 'a little more Ogden's Firewhisky than most would expect from custodians of our children'.[3] Since Rita enjoyed fabricating information to slander people, it is likely that her statement was untrue.\n\nHannah was described as a pink-faced girl with blonde hair. In her younger years, she usually wore pigtails.[8]\n\nHannah appeared to have a naive streak since she was easily convinced by Ernie that Harry might be the Heir of Slytherin, despite having always considered him to be nice.[13] She also believed that Sirius Black could turn into a flowering shrub (although, given that he was, in fact, an Animagus, the belief wasn't too far from the truth).[16]\n\nHannah was easily flustered and appeared to lack self-confidence, as was evidenced by her breakdown in Herbology and her claims of being stupid.[21] It seemed that, when under pressure, she was prone to making mistakes.[22] Despite this, Hannah was a loyal friend and showed her bravery firstly by joining Dumbledore's Army,[20] and then fighting in the defence of Hogwarts.[27]\n\nAlthough it appeared that Hannah and Neville Longbottom were rarely ever together during their school days, and given that Hannah supported Cedric Diggory in their fourth year, their friendship probably evolved from their time in Dumbledore's Army together, and during the student rebellion during their seventh year, as well as just being in the same year and sharing classes for so long — particularly Herbology, Neville's best subject, which the Gryffindors shared with the Hufflepuffs.\n\nIt is possible that Hannah and Neville both found comfort in each other during their seventh year, since in the previous year Hannah's mother had been killed by Death Eaters, and Neville would understand how she would be feeling as Death Eaters tortured his parents into insanity. Hannah joined Dumbledore's Army under the leadership of Neville, and in the absence of Harry, and proved her loyalty to him throughout the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nFollowing the Second Wizarding War, Hannah and Neville became closer and eventually married. Neville became the new Professor of Herbology at Hogwarts, taking over from Professor Sprout, whilst Hannah became the new landlady of the Leaky Cauldron, taking over from Tom. The couple lived together above the pub, a fact that Neville's students thought was 'cool'.[29]\n\nHannah eventually applied for the job of Matron at Hogwarts, which could have brought her closer to Neville, if she managed to gain the position.\n\nHannah and Ernie Macmillan were close friends during their time at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, both having been sorted into the house of Hufflepuff during their first year. During their second year they both discussed the possibility of Harry being the Heir of Slytherin after the Chamber of Secrets had been declared open. Hannah had her doubts, as she thought Harry was nice, but Ernie was easily able to sway her opinion.[13]\n\nBoth Hannah and Ernie shared the hobby of collecting Chocolate Frog Cards.[18] They also both supported Cedric Diggory as the School Champion during the Triwizard Tournament, as many Hufflepuffs and even Ravenclaws did, and both shared a certain irritation with Harry Potter, the other champion.[18] In 1995, they both became the Hufflepuff prefects[5] and joined Dumbledore's Army.[20] Unlike Hannah, Ernie was able to keep his cool during his O.W.L.s.[22]\n\nHannah and Justin Finch-Fletchley were close friends during their time at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, both having been sorted into the house of Hufflepuff during their first year. During their second year they both discussed the possibility of Harry being the Heir of Slytherin after the Chamber of Secrets had been declared open.[13] Both Hannah and Justin joined Dumbledore's Army.[20]\n\nHannah and Susan were roommates and friends during Hogwarts, and sat together in the train while going to Hogwarts.[25] Both joined Dumbledore's Army and both fought in the Battle of Hogwarts.",
