  "content": "Blaise Zabini (b. c. 1980) was a wizard[6] and a student in Harry Potter's year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was Sorted into the Slytherin house,[5] and was on friendly terms with multiple fellow Slytherins, including Draco Malfoy and his gang, as well as Pansy Parkinson.[6]\n\nBlaise Zabini was the son of a famously beautiful witch who had been widowed seven times over by 1996. Each husband's death occurred both under suspicious circumstances and left the already wealthy Ms Zabini and her son with more money. Blaise was incredibly vain as a child and did not befriend Muggles or blood traitors.[6]\n\nIn 1991, Blaise started his magical education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was the last student to be Sorted in his first year and was Sorted into Slytherin House.[5] He was prejudiced against Muggle-borns and \"blood traitors.\"[6] Blaise seemed to get along with fellow Slytherins Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle and Pansy Parkinson — he was willing to sit with them on the train journey to Hogwarts — but other than that, he was not known to be a member of Draco's gang.[6]\n\nBlaise was one of the students who received an invitation from Professor Horace Slughorn for lunch on the Hogwarts Express journey, which might imply that none of Blaise's relatives were Death Eaters, as Slughorn wanted nothing to do with them (it was the reason why he chose not to invite Theodore Nott to join the Club). Slughorn was sizing up the student body for potential new members of his famous Slug Club, which he started when he last taught at Hogwarts.[6]\n\nDuring the meeting Blaise seemed quiet as usual and did not join in the discussions. However, he did give a little cough of \"amused scepticism\" when Slughorn told the group that he thought Harry Potter had powers beyond the ordinary. This caused him to provoke Ginny Weasley to snap at him, and Slughorn jokingly warned Blaise not to annoy Ginny, remembering how well she could cast a Bat-Bogey Hex. When questioned on his family, Blaise talked about his mother and the line of husbands she had who had all left her large amounts of gold in their wills after their suspicious deaths.[6]\n\nAfter the lunch meeting ended, Blaise retired to his compartment on the Hogwarts Express in which Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson were also sitting. Harry Potter followed Blaise back to this compartment under his Invisibility cloak in an attempt to hear Draco's conversation, and give him some perspective as to what Draco had been planning over the summer.[6] Once they arrived at Hogwarts, Blaise apparently passed the litmus test that Slughorn had set, as he continued to receive invitations to Slughorn's parties after the school year began.[9] He did not seem to have a high opinion of his fellow members, if his comments to Draco Malfoy on the train were any indication, but, in spite of this, he continued to accept the invitations. He did not appear to have a high opinion of Draco either.[6]\n\nDuring his sixth year, Blaise took Potions as a N.E.W.T. class,[10][11] and played as Chaser for the Slytherin Quidditch team.[4] He also on at least one occasion went to the Three Broomsticks Inn in Hogsmeade, where the trio noticed him lolling against a pillar there.[12]\n\nBlaise attended his seventh year at Hogwarts.[13][7] It can be assumed that his time under the Carrows regime was not as trying as others, as he was a Slytherin and not a Muggle-born. Blaise was present on the Hogwarts Express when the Death Eaters raided it looking for Harry Potter.[13]\n\nWhen evacuation started moments before the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May 1998, Blaise presumably left with the other Slytherins through the passageway to Hog's Head Inn in Room of Requirement.[14] Given how he presumably did not fight in the Battle of Hogwarts, along with most of Slytherin, he would have survived the Second Wizarding War, but what happened to him later in life is unknown. However, he may have been among the Slytherins that returned to defend Hogwarts in the final part of the battle.\n\nBlaise was a tall, black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes. He was described as attractive, and also was vain about the attractive looks in question.[6]\n\nBlaise seemed to be a highly arrogant individual, who looked down on nearly everyone and everything. He rarely expressed his often disdainful opinions in a confrontational manner, and preferred to simply scoff or show disbelief when someone said something he disagreed with. This was shown when he reacted with scornful amusement when Professor Slughorn praised Harry Potter's power. When warned not to anger Ginny Weasley (who insulted Blaise's vanity) he also reacted with contempt.[6] He also insulted most of his fellow Slug Club members and the parties themselves, though he continued to attend the meetings. He also did not seem to respect Draco Malfoy very much.[6]\n\nBlaise was prejudiced against Muggles, Muggle-borns, and those who were accepting of them. This was made clear when Pansy Parkinson accused him of finding Ginny attractive. Blaise in response said he would never touch \"a filthy blood traitor like her\". However, he also did not seem to hold a high opinion of followers of Voldemort, as he taunted Draco on his father being outed as a Death Eater. It seemed he was so arrogant that he was more or less indifferent and dismissive of everyone, regardless of status.[6]",
