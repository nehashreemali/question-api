  "content": "The Fat Friar was a wizard, who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in his youth, and was Sorted into Hufflepuff. He was a jolly man and very forgiving. He devoted his life to religion and, after his death, returned to the school as the house ghost of Hufflepuff House.\n\nThe Friar was born no earlier than 982,[1] presumably somewhere in the British Isles.[4]\n\nAt the age of eleven, the Friar became a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Scotland. He was Sorted into Hufflepuff House and was taught by Helga Hufflepuff in the magical arts the seven years that followed.[7]\n\nAt some point in his life, he joined the clergy as part of a mendicant religious order, meaning that he spent his life begging in the name of charity.[6] Apparently, given his physically large appearance, he indulged in the pleasures of food[4] and drink.[5]\n\nThe Fat Friar's kindness was to be his undoing. He was executed because senior churchmen grew suspicious of his ability to cure the pox merely by poking peasants with a stick, and his ill-advised habit of pulling rabbits out of the communion cup.[6]\n\nThe Friar returned from the dead as a ghost, and returned to Hogwarts Castle, where he became the house ghost of his former House, Hufflepuff.[4] He has thus far spent the majority of his afterlife within the castle walls along with the other Hogwarts ghosts.\n\nAfter his death, the Fat Friar retained his kind and joyful demeanour. He eagerly welcomed new students to the school and offered assistance whenever needed.\n\nThe Fat Friar participated in planning Sir Nicholas's 493rd deathday party when Erling, a friend of his, visited Hogwarts. When he knew that Sir Nicholas and Erling had the same deathday, he suggested eagerly for the two to hold a party together, but it was rejected by Erling. Nevertheless, the Friar guided Erling through a tour in Hogwarts, including the Charms Classroom and the dungeons.[8]\n\nDuring their parties, when he saw neither of them was going on well, he gathered them together and asked again for a collective party, which they agreed. He attended the party and a dance.[9]\n\nDuring this school year, Penny Haywood and Jacob's sibling consulted with the Fat Friar in the Great Hall to inquire if he knew anything about Duncan Ashe or the Marauder's Map. He recommended they seek Sir Nicholas for help finding the map, as he himself was unaware.[10]\n\nLater during this school year, Jacob's sibling and Merula Snyde spoke to him in the Hufflepuff common room to ask if he had seen Peeves. He offered to help but sadly could not give much help as to find Peeves, with him commenting he would know more about curing peasants of the pox.[11]\n\nShortly before the Start-of-Term Feast on 1 September 1991, the ghosts came across the first years waiting for Professor McGonagall, while discussing whether Peeves should be allowed to attend the Feast (for he had given the house elves quite a bit of trouble, throwing food and breaking dishes). The Friar was excited to see the new students, and smiled around at them. He later attended the Feast, and waved merrily at students being Sorted into Hufflepuff, notably Hannah Abbott.[4]\n\nOn 2 September, the Friar haunted the Charms corridor, chanting aloud as he hovered around.[12]\n\nIn the evening of 31 October 1992, the Friar attended Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party, where he engaged in conversation with a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead.[13]\n\nThis year, the Friar could be usually seen strolling around the Grand Staircase.[14]\n\nIn the afternoon of 1 September 1994, the Hogwarts ghosts gathered to decide whether Peeves should be allowed to attend the Start-of-Term Feast. The Fat Friar wanted to give him another chance, but both Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington and the Bloody Baron decided against it, as it was Peeves and he could not and did not want to change, and therefore did not deserve a second chance. As a result, Peeves wreaked havoc in the kitchens, spilling soup all over the place and scattering pots and pans everywhere, scaring the house-elves that were present.[15]\n\nBy 1995, there was a tetraptych of the Friar hung in the first-floor corridor.[16] He would frequently haunt this area during this school year. It is unknown what he did with the rest of his time.\n\nAfter the Educational Decree Number Twenty-Eight was passed on 21 April 1996, the Fat Friar saw Dolores Umbridge fruitlessly trying to get access to the Headmaster's Tower, as the tower had sealed itself against her and later told Ernie Macmillan about it.[17] It is safe to assume that like all other residents of Hogwarts that the Friar did not like Umbridges's presence in the school.\n\nThe Fat Friar was present in the castle on 30 June 1997 when Death Eaters invaded the school. It is unknown if he assisted in the ensuing battle or not. Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, was killed at the hands of Severus Snape in the former's plan on top of the Astronomy Tower.[18] The Hogwarts ghosts were some of the known attendees of his funeral in early July, which most likely included the Friar.[19]\n\nOn 1 August 1997, the Ministry of Magic was taken over by Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters.[20] By 1 September 1997, Severus Snape was made Headmaster of Hogwarts while two of his fellow Death Eaters, siblings Alecto Carrow and Amycus Carrow became the Muggle Studies and Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers respectively.[21]\n\nThe Carrows were put in charge of all discipline and punishments, which were violent.  Many students had bruises, cuts, scars, or other forms of injuries from the two evil siblings. It is likely the Friar, as did the Heads of House, tried to protect the pupils from Alecto and Amycus.[22]\n\nOn 2 May 1998, the Battle of Hogwarts ensued after Lord Voldemort learned Harry Potter was in the premises. The ghosts, likely including the Friar, attended a gathering in the Great Hall, in which Professor McGonagall gave instructions on evacuation of underage students and Kingsley Shacklebolt organised the participants for battle.[23] Later on, the ghosts gathered at the Great Hall, joining the mass mourning over the dead.[24]\n\nWhen the Second Wizarding War came to an end, it is possible that the ghosts (including the Friar) celebrated Harry's victory and Voldemort's demise.[25]\n\nDuring a Calamity surge in December 2020 focused on Grim Fawley's memories of Christmases spent at Hogwarts with ghosts and portraits of the Hogwarts founders, the Fat Friar became a Foundable, with members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force managing to return him to his original time. After his Foundable was returned, the Friar suddenly developed a clear memory of Grim advising him to \"mind the portraits\". Believing that he had just had this conversation with Grim in the present due to the clearness of the memory, the Friar informed Professor Minerva McGonagall, although she informed him that there was no sign of Grim or any other intruder at Hogwarts despite his insistence that the conversation had just taken place. Minister for Magic Hermione Granger theorised that Grim had attached a false memory to the Friar's Foundable, realising that the target didn't need to be alive to receive such messages.[26]\n\nAs a ghost, the Friar was pearly-white and slightly transparent, like all other ghosts.[4] He had short brown hair, which he wore with a small tonsure.[5] At first sight a monk,[4] he was dressed in a habit held by a rope belt.[5] He was fat and short,[4] and usually carried a mug with him.[5]\n\nThe Friar was very cheerful and welcoming, and happily greeted new students at Hogwarts.[4] He also tended to find something to value in anyone and look past their faults, as he always insisted with the other ghosts to let Peeves attend the Start-of-Term Feasts despite his many wrongdoings.[4][15] He also appeared to be quite sociable, meeting and engaging in conversation with fellow ghosts during Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party.[13] He also seems to have some House pride, as he happily reminisced about his \"old House\" when welcoming first-years.[4] Despite this, he was always resentful of the fact that he was never made a cardinal.[6] His overly kindness has proven to be his undoing, as he would heal the pox simply by poking with a stick, and pull rabbits out of the communion cup, showing recklessness in terms of concealing his wizardry.",
