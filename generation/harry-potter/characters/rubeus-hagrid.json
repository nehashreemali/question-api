  "content": "Professor Rubeus Hagrid (b. 6 December 1928)[14][15] was an English half-giant wizard, son of Mr Hagrid and the giantess Fridwulfa, and elder half-brother of the giant Grawp.\n\nHagrid attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1940 and was Sorted into Gryffindor house. In Hagrid's third year, he was framed by Tom Riddle for the crime of opening the Chamber of Secrets and using his pet Acromantula to attack several Muggle-born students and eventually killing one of them. Though Hagrid's wand was snapped and he was expelled, he was trained as gamekeeper of Hogwarts and allowed to live on the school grounds at the request of Albus Dumbledore.\n\nIn 1991, Hagrid was given the task of reintroducing Harry Potter to the wizarding world. In 1993, Hagrid would assume the post of Care of Magical Creatures professor after the retirement of Professor Silvanus Kettleburn. As a member of both the original and the reinstated Order of the Phoenix, Hagrid fought in several battles of the First and the Second Wizarding Wars, including the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.\n\nIt can be assumed that Hagrid kept in contact with the trio after the war. By 2017 he was still living, and presumably still teaching and tending to his gamekeeping duties at Hogwarts. When Harry's son, Albus Severus, started school he invited him for tea, just as Hagrid had done for his father and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.\n\nHagrid was born on 6 December 1928 to Mr Hagrid, a wizard, and Fridwulfa, a giantess, and grew up in the West Country of England, near the Forest of Dean, where he acquired his distinctive accent.[16][17]\n\nWhen Hagrid was about three, his mother returned to her giant colony, leaving his father to raise him alone. Hagrid said he had very few memories of his mother from his childhood, but remembered his father fondly; as a half-giant, he overtook his father in size by the age of six, and amused the \"tiny\" wizard by picking him up and setting him on top of a dresser when Hagrid was annoyed with him. Later, when talking to Harry, Ron, and Hermione about the death of his mother, Hagrid admitted that she was not a great mother at all.[18] He eventually grew to a height of eleven and a half feet tall, immense by human standards but very small by giant standards.\n\nHagrid's father was thrilled when his son was accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Hagrid began his education in 1940 in which he was Sorted into Gryffindor House.[13] In the 1942–1943 school year, during his third year, Hagrid acquired one in what would be a long line of dangerous pets: a young Acromantula which he named Aragog.\n\nThat same year, fifth-year student Tom Marvolo Riddle, who would go on to become Lord Voldemort, opened the Chamber of Secrets and unleashed another monster, which Riddle used to attack and petrify a number of Muggle-born students until he finally caused the death of a girl named Myrtle Warren. When the school was threatened with closing, a consequence highly undesired by Riddle, the boy found out about Aragog and turned Hagrid in as the culprit.\n\nIt likely didn't help that Hagrid had a habit of getting into trouble every other week; he'd once tried raising werewolf cubs under his bed and was known to sneak off into the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls (both of these statements were likely exaggerations on Riddle's part however). Hagrid protected Aragog and helped him flee to the Forbidden Forest; however, he was shortly thereafter expelled from Hogwarts,[19] a fate that he was relieved that his father never knew of, having died during Hagrid's second year.[20]\n\nFollowing his expulsion, the Ministry of Magic forbade Hagrid from practising magic and destroyed his wand. The then-Transfiguration teacher Albus Dumbledore, who was convinced that Hagrid was innocent, nonetheless convinced then-Headmaster Armando Dippet to have Hagrid trained for the job of Gamekeeper and allow the orphan to remain a resident of the school. Hagrid continued to do magic using his pink umbrella, which most likely contained the broken fragments of his wand, with varying degree of success.\n\nAt some point after he came of age in 1945, Hagrid was entrusted the responsibility of helping out with the security of the school when he was named the school's Keeper of the Keys, in which capacity he was tasked with, among other things, opening the Entrance Gates to let visitors in and out of the school grounds and escorting new students to the castle for their first-ever arrival at Hogwarts school.[21]\n\nAt some point following the graduation of Molly Weasley around 1968, Gamekeeper Ogg retired or otherwise left the position, and Hagrid officially succeeded him in the role as gamekeeper of the school and took over his duties full-time.\n\nSometime in the 1970s, Hagrid joined the original Order of the Phoenix. It was a secret organisation founded by Albus Dumbledore to oppose Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. The Order was constructed after Voldemort returned to England from abroad and started his campaign to take over the Ministry of Magic and persecute Muggles and Muggle-borns.\n\nVoldemort's first reign of terror lasted years and turned friends against each other. It was said that during this time it was difficult to trust one another, as you did not know for sure who had gone over to the dark side, partly due to the Death Eaters' access to the Imperius Curse. The Order worked with the Ministry to oppose the Dark Lord and his followers, even allowing Aurors the use of Unforgivable Curses. Voldemort also had a number of magical dark creatures under his command as well, such as giants.\n\nAt the abrupt end of the First Wizarding War, Albus Dumbledore sent Hagrid to rescue a one-year-old Harry Potter from the ruins of his house in Godric's Hollow, after Lord Voldemort murdered both James and Lily Potter in 1981. Using Sirius Black's motorcycle, he brought Harry Potter to Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall, who were waiting to deliver the boy to his only remaining family — Lily's Muggle elder sister, Petunia, and her husband Vernon Dursley. Hagrid was very sad at the thought of James and Lily Potter being dead.[7]\n\nEarly in the 1984–1985 school year, Hagrid rescued Jacob's sibling from Devil's Snare.[22] He also met Ben Copper.[23] Around this time, he also got a puppy, which he later named Fang.[24] Shortly before one of his birthdays, Hagrid lost one of his pets and stopped being as cheerful as he usually was.[23] Around this time, Dumbledore recruited Jacob's sibling to help throw him a huge birthday party to cheer him up and show just how much everyone appreciated him. At some point before this, he saved a seventh-year's life, made a first-year feel welcome at Hogwarts, and baked rock cakes to cheer up a third-year.[25]\n\nDuring the 1985–1986 school year, he invited Jacob's sibling to care for Needlefingers.[26] Hagrid showed them Needlefingers and told them information about him and his species.[26] Jacob's sibling then got to talk to Needlefingers.[26]\n\nDuring the 1986 summer holidays, he bred an excess amount of Flobberworms in his hut, which he was unsure what to do with. He informed Jacob's sibling of this at the start of the 1986–1987 school year, before they asked him about Boggarts on the school grounds. He told them Boggarts had not been seen at Hogwarts since Jacob's school days.[27] During the 1987–1988 school year, Hagrid's hut became infested with Bundimuns. Jacob's sibling helped Hagrid clear out the infestation with the Scouring Charm, for which Hagrid was extremely grateful.[28]\n\nIn the 1990–1991 school year, Hagrid was bitten by an Acromantula from the Forbidden Forest and had to receive treatment in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. As part of their seventh-year career assignments at the hospital, Jacob's sibling and Penny Haywood attended to his bedside. They even brought him a Pumpkin Pasty to eat.[29]\n\nAfter Harry was accepted to Hogwarts in 1991, Hagrid was given the task of finding Harry, as Harry's uncle Vernon and aunt Petunia were doing everything in their power to prevent their nephew from receiving his Hogwarts acceptance letter. On Harry's eleventh birthday, Hagrid found the Dursleys and Harry in an isolated Hut-on-the-Rock, and accidentally broke the door down from the force of his knocking. Vernon threatened him with a gun, only for Hagrid to contemptuously seize the gun and twist it into a knot.\n\nHagrid gave Harry a birthday cake, cooked some sausages for him and revealed that Harry was a wizard and a famous one at that. He also, much to Vernon and Petunia's ire, told Harry the truth about his parents and how he came to live with the Dursleys. Vernon repeatedly attempted to interrupt Hagrid, who came very close to losing his temper. At the end of the story, Vernon and Hagrid got into a final argument with each other. Harry's uncle insisted that his nephew would never attend Hogwarts, whilst the giant countered that he could not stop James and Lily Potter's son. The confrontation ended when Vernon made the mistake of calling Albus Dumbledore, a \"crackpot old fool\". Pushed beyond his limit, Hagrid pointed his umbrella at Harry's spoiled cousin, Dudley, attempting to turn him into a pig. He only managed to give the boy a pig's tail, but it was enough to drive the Dursleys out of the room and into the master bedroom, where they would remain until Hagrid left the next morning. Hagrid credited the spell's failure to Dudley being \"so much like a pig already, there was not much left to do\".\n\nOnce it was confirmed that Harry would be attending Hogwarts, after Hagrid decidedly ignored the Dursleys' protests, he helped Harry find his bearings in the magical world by taking him to Diagon Alley, through the Leaky Cauldron, to buy his school books and other necessities.\n\nWhile in Diagon Alley, Hagrid took Harry to Gringotts Wizarding Bank to withdraw some funds from the Potters' vault, and to retrieve the Philosopher's Stone from high-security Vault 713, to be transported to Hogwarts for even safer keeping. Hagrid also bought Hedwig, a snowy white owl, for Harry's eleventh birthday. He comforted Harry about his upcoming attendance at Hogwarts school and provided him with a ticket detailing the date, time and place that he would need to catch the Hogwarts Express.\n\nWhen news got out that Vault 713 had been broken into (shortly after it had been emptied by Hagrid), Harry, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger quickly realised that whatever Hagrid had moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts was being hidden in the off-limits third-floor corridor and guarded by a massive three-headed dog. Hagrid refused to disclose what the vault had contained, but he mentioned that the secret was \"between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel\".\n\nIn the spring of 1992, Hagrid met a hooded man (Quirinus Quirrell in disguise) at the Hog's Head and was enticed to play a game of cards when the mysterious person bet a dragon egg. Assuming the man was a dragon dealer and fellow dangerous creature enthusiast, and under the influence of a fair amount of mead, Hagrid was convinced to divulge details about Fluffy, the three-headed dog Hagrid had lent to Dumbledore to help guard the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nHarry, knowing that Hagrid had always wanted a dragon and thinking it far too much a coincidence that a man just happened to bring a rare dragon egg to the local pub, questioned Hagrid alongside Ron and Hermione about what had exactly happened during the card game. This time, Hagrid let slip to the trio what he had told the hooded man: the secret to calming Fluffy was that one simply had to play music and Fluffy would fall asleep. This allowed the trio to pursue the potential thief.\n\nOnce the dragon egg hatched, Hagrid lovingly named the hatchling Norbert. Hagrid was initially blind to the chaos that the hatchling caused, but eventually, Harry, Ron, and Hermione convinced him to allow Norbert to be taken to a dragon sanctuary by friends of Ron's brother, Charlie, who worked with dragons. After learning that Voldemort had attempted to steal the Stone using the information Hagrid gave him while drunk, Hagrid was distraught with guilt, but Harry assured Hagrid that he did not blame him. As an apology, Hagrid spent the time that Harry was unconscious sending off owls to some of his parents' old school friends, assembling an album full of wizarding photos of Harry's parents for him.\n\nDuring the 1992–1993 school year, Hagrid showed public disdain for the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart, although he never did so for any other teachers.\n\nIn 1993 Hagrid was sent to the wizarding prison, Azkaban, when the Chamber of Secrets was re-opened. It was assumed he was the one who reopened the Chamber because his expulsion from Hogwarts was for the same occurrence. Even with Dumbledore backing Hagrid, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge insisted on taking Hagrid anyway. So on the same night Dumbledore was asked to step down as Headmaster by the school governors, Hagrid was escorted to Azkaban. However, he was able to help Harry and Ron solve the mystery surrounding the Chamber, by advising them to \"follow the spiders.\"\n\nFollowing the spiders led the boys to Aragog, the Acromantula believed to have attacked students during the 1942-1943 school year, and his family. Though Harry and Ron barely escaped the encounter with their lives, they managed to obtain some valuable information over the course of their conversation with Aragog: the monster within the Chamber had nothing to do with Hagrid, and the girl it had killed in the 1940s had died in a bathroom. Harry was thus able to find the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets, slay the basilisk within, and destroy Tom Riddle's diary.\n\nAs it turned out, the actual perpetrator had been the person who had turned Hagrid in in 1943. Hagrid was exonerated and released from Azkaban. He returned to Hogwarts at three o'clock in the morning and joined in the ongoing celebration of the closure of what had been a terrifying incident, accidentally knocking Harry and Ron face-first into their plates of trifle when he cuffed them on the shoulders.[19]\n\nIn the 1993–1994 school year, Hagrid became a professor of the Care of Magical Creatures. For his first lesson, Hagrid taught his third-year students about hippogriffs. After explaining the proper way to greet a hippogriff and choosing Harry to demonstrate, Draco Malfoy caused trouble by insulting the hippogriff Buckbeak, even though Hagrid had just warned the class to treat the creatures with respect.\n\nBuckbeak attacked Draco, and the Ministry of Magic issued an order for Buckbeak's execution after a hearing in which Lucius Malfoy's pull at the Ministry was demonstrated, the incident also damaging Hagrid's self-confidence; later lessons focused on tamer creatures like flobberworms. Buckbeak's attack on Malfoy was later used during the Triwizard Tournament by Rita Skeeter to give Hagrid a very bad reputation.\n\nAn appeal took place on 6 June 1994, but this was to no avail, and Buckbeak was to be executed at sunset that night. Before the execution, Harry, Ron, and Hermione visited Hagrid to console him. The trio offered to stay with him, but Hagrid declined. He did not want them getting in trouble as well. So they left just before the executioner arrived.\n\nKnowing Buckbeak's position, and the exact timing of the start of the execution, Harry and Hermione were able to save Buckbeak by going back in time with Hermione's Time-Turner, allowing them to rescue Buckbeak after the Ministry team sent to execute him had confirmed his location while Hagrid and Dumbledore were under observation, thus guaranteeing that neither would be blamed for Buckbeak's rescue/escape.[30] Delighted at the escape of his beloved pet, Hagrid spent the whole night celebrating with a large bottle of what may have been Firewhisky.\n\nDuring the 1994–1995 school year, the Triwizard Tournament was held at Hogwarts. Students from the Durmstrang Institute and the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic attended Hogwarts starting in October, and Hagrid was tasked with taking care of the Beauxbatons' Abraxans, which drank only single malt whiskey and required forceful handling.\n\nOver the course of the year, he performed various tasks essential to the workings of the tournament: in November, he helped Charles Weasley take care of the dragons used in the First Task of the tournament, which he showed Harry at the suggestion of Professor Moody (who was really Barty Crouch Jnr); he also bred Blast-Ended Skrewts as a project for his fourth years, which were to be used in the Third task of the tournament.[31]\n\nThroughout the year, Hagrid and Olympe Maxime, the half-giantess headmistress of Beauxbatons, had a budding romantic relationship, which included dancing during the Yule Ball. Hagrid confided in her his life story, revealing to her that he is a half-giant, assuming her to be one as well because of her massive size. She was offended by the insinuations that she was part giant, and left him heartbroken.[31]\n\nRita Skeeter, in her Animagus beetle form, overheard Hagrid's confession and reported it in the Daily Prophet. After receiving a fair amount of hate mail, Hagrid hid in the seclusion of his hut, while Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank temporarily took over Care of Magical Creatures, and attempted to resign from his position as Professor. Dumbledore refused to accept Hagrid's resignation, and he was eventually convinced to come back and teach by Harry, Ron, and Hermione.[31]\n\nBefore the events of the third task, Hagrid was called by Dumbledore to escort Harry back to the castle after he and Viktor Krum encountered Barty Crouch Snr at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. When it appeared that Krum had been attacked by Crouch (really it was his son hiding in the trees), Igor Karkaroff accused Dumbledore of treachery and spat at his foot. This caused Hagrid to lose his temper with Karkaroff and pin him to a tree, demanding an apology. He was talked down by Dumbledore, and saw Harry back to his common room, reprimanding him for being in such a situation and warning him against the foreign students.[31]\n\nFollowing the return of Lord Voldemort, Hagrid attempted to comfort Harry after his ordeal and admitted that he had believed Voldemort would have returned eventually, echoing something he had told Harry at their first meeting; that Voldemort did not have enough humanity left to die. He admitted to Harry and his friends that he and Madam Maxime had important business to attend to over the holidays but refused to say more. He also imparted some wisdom to Harry, helping him accept that what would come would come.[31]\n\nWhen Albus Dumbledore learned of Voldemort's rebirth, he sent Hagrid and Madame Maxime as envoys to the giant colonies of north-eastern Minsk, in the hopes of dissuading the giants from joining Lord Voldemort's side in the coming war. Bearing gifts of eternal Gubraithian Fire and a goblin-made battle helmet, they eventually won over the Gurg, Karkus.\n\nHowever, two Death Eaters that Voldemort had sent on the same mission engineered an uprising. This uprising was led by the giant Golgomath, who beheaded Karkus and usurped his position. Golgomath then ordered his subordinates to attack Hagrid and Maxime and forced them to flee. Golgomath was far more keen towards the Death Eaters and got on well with Walden Macnair, both of whom enjoyed killing and had shared a dislike toward Hagrid.\n\nHagrid subsequently found that his mother had died years ago, and the existence of his half-brother Grawp, who was having a hard time within his colony as he was considerably smaller than most giants. Hagrid insisted on bringing Grawp back to Hogwarts due to this and presumably to prevent Grawp from being enslaved by Voldemort alongside the other giants. Grawp, however, was highly resistant to the idea and had a general tendency to be violent. Thus Hagrid and Grawp made the journey back to Scotland separately from Madam Maxime.[20]\n\nAbout halfway through the school year, Hagrid returned from his mission for Dumbledore with his half-brother, Grawp. In 1995, Dolores Umbridge was brought in as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, and later became the first and only Hogwarts High Inquisitor. Hagrid barely excused himself for his long absence from Umbridge's tyrannical questioning and was surprised that he would be subjected to her inspection soon afterwards.\n\nHagrid resumed his teaching post, beginning with a lesson about Thestrals. Despite their rather off-putting appearance and the inability of most of the class to see them, Hermione found these lessons far more useful than Hagrid's typical classes. Regardless, early in 1996, Professor Umbridge put Hagrid on probation after supposedly finding his lessons unsatisfactory by her standards, despite Hermione's every effort to make sure Hagrid's curriculum was geared toward preparing students for the upcoming O.W.L.s.\n\nUmbridge's harsh judgement was largely due to her distaste for \"half-breeds,\" and it was only the resistance she met from Headmaster Dumbledore that kept her from firing Hagrid altogether. When confronted by the trio about this revelation, Hagrid attempted to make light of it (nearly concussing Professor Vector with his fist as she went past) but was consistently jumpy and nervous at the prospect of being sacked.\n\nHowever, once Dumbledore was forced to leave in order to shield Harry from punishment for establishing Dumbledore's Army, Hagrid feared that he would be driven out by the new Headmistress Umbridge. In preparation for this, he introduced Harry and Hermione to Grawp. Grawp took an immediate liking to Hermione, whom he called \"Hermy,\" and Hagrid asked the two of them, along with Ron, to take care of Grawp in his absence.\n\nUpon Dumbledore's departure, general chaos reigned within the school, as the students became determined to make Umbridge's job as hard for her as possible; Lee Jordan even released a couple of nifflers into her office, for which she blamed Hagrid. Umbridge finally attempted to have Hagrid forcibly removed from the premises, and possibly arrested, when she brought several Ministry officials to his hut in the middle of the night so as not to cause a commotion with the students due to their earlier presence at Sybill Trelawney's dismissal. Hagrid refused to go quietly and took on the officials, whose attempts to Stun him proved fruitless thanks to his giant blood. Fang came to his master's aid until one of the wizards Stunned him, prompting Hagrid to lift the culprit bodily from the ground and throw the unfortunate soul ten feet away.\n\nWhile all of this was being witnessed by the trio's Astronomy exam, Professor Minerva McGonagall came charging out of the castle demanding that Hagrid be left alone and, in a disgustingly cowardly move by the officials, was seriously injured after being hit by four simultaneous Stunning Spells without warning.\n\nEnraged at this dishonourable conduct and the injury of his friend and colleague, Hagrid knocked out two more of his assailants before fleeing with his unconscious dog. Aurors were sent to search for Hagrid, but he successfully evaded capture by hiding in the same cave that had previously proved a useful hiding place for Sirius Black. Once Dumbledore was reinstated as the Headmaster of Hogwarts and Umbridge permanently removed from the school, Hagrid was welcomed back to his post.[20]\n\nHagrid accompanied the trio and some members of the Weasley family to Diagon Alley as security for Harry, as these were dark and dangerous times. When Hagrid found out that none of his sixth-year Gryffindor students chose to continue past their O.W.L. level of Care of Magical Creatures, he initially misinterpreted this as a reflection of his students not liking him, as opposed to his questionable teaching.[32]\n\nHagrid eventually came to forgive Harry, Ron, and Hermione, understanding that their N.E.W.T. classes were difficult with massive work loads (and after Hermione confirmed that they could not have managed his classes with Time-Turners, as they had all been smashed during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries); his anger abated completely when he was overcome with worry about the failing health of Aragog.[32]\n\nWhen Aragog died in 1997, he asked Harry, Ron and Hermione to help him bury the dead Acromantula's body, though the heightened security around the castle with Voldemort's confirmed return made that difficult. Ultimately, spurred on by Felix Felicis, Harry went to Hagrid's anyway and met Professor Horace Slughorn on the way. Hagrid, along with Harry and Professor Slughorn, buried Aragog near the pumpkin patch, and then gave him a tearful salute involving a good deal of mead. Harry used the situation to his advantage in retrieving a memory of Tom Riddle asking about Horcruxes from a very inebriated Slughorn.[32]\n\nDuring the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Albus Dumbledore was killed by Severus Snape (on Dumbledore's orders). Near the end of the battle, he confronted Death Eater Thorfinn Rowle who attempted to curse him only to realise that Hagrid's giant blood protected him. Rowle proceeded to set Hagrid's Hut on fire while the Death Eaters were fleeing the school grounds. Hagrid and Harry Potter, who had chased Snape out of the castle, put it out before the hut burned down.\n\nHagrid was grief-stricken about Dumbledore's death, having been one of his strongest supporters. Hagrid carried Dumbledore's body to be interred at his funeral, almost breaking down several times. Hagrid placed the body carefully upon the table. Then he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalised looks from some, Dolores Umbridge for example. Later Hagrid and Grawp were seen comforting one another.[32]\n\nHagrid was among the thirteen members of the Order of the Phoenix, led by Alastor Moody, that made up the Advance Guard. The Advance Guard was in charge of moving Harry Potter out of the Dursley home before his seventeenth birthday; the plan to do so included having five of Harry's friends (Ron, Hermione, Fleur Delacour, and Fred and George Weasley), as well as Mundungus Fletcher, impersonate Harry to act as decoys, with an Order of the Phoenix member protecting each of them, and fly to six safe houses before taking portkeys to The Burrow.\n\nKnowing that any Death Eaters watching out for them would assume the most skilled Auror would be moving with the real Harry, Alastor Moody took Mundungus Fletcher, while Hagrid was given the important task of protecting the real Harry in the side-car of Sirius Black's motorcycle.\n\nArthur Weasley had helped Hagrid make several adjustments to the bike, including adding a button that produced dragon's fire, one that produced a net, and another that produced a solid wall, all of which materialised behind the bike by expanding out of its exhaust pipe. As it turned out, the Death Eaters had found out about the plan to move Harry earlier than rumoured (as the Order had purposely released false information about moving him at a later date) and the seven Harrys, with their Order protectors, were ambushed.\n\nHagrid was able to keep the Death Eaters at bay with the help of the modifications on his bike and Harry's wand-work, but when Harry discovered one of the attacking Death Eaters was an imperiused Stanley Shunpike, he made the unusual move of using the Disarming Charm. As he had done the same unexpected thing in Little Hangleton graveyard in 1995, Harry was identified as the real deal, and Voldemort came after him personally. In the struggle that followed, the motorcycle was torn apart and Hagrid dove off the bike at a Death Eater, falling a great distance to the ground. He survived, however, as did Harry, when it turned out they had fallen into the protection surrounding the Tonks house.\n\nNymphadora Tonks's parents, Ted and Andromeda healed their injuries, as Hagrid comforted Harry over the death of his beloved pet owl Hedwig, saying she had lived a \"good old life\". Since Hagrid had a history of having trouble keeping secrets, Fleur Delacour suspected Hagrid was the one who had unintentionally leaked the date of the intended move. Harry refused to blame anyone even before that was revealed not to be the case. That same night, Hagrid and all the other members of the Order mourned the death of Alastor Moody, who had been targeted immediately by Voldemort, exactly as Moody anticipated.\n\nDuring the summer of 1997, Hagrid was present at Harry's seventeenth birthday party. He gave him a mokeskin pouch which held objects retrievable only by the owner. Hagrid also attended Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding, accidentally sitting in the wrong spot (and destroying a number of chairs) before finding the correct place to sit.[33] During the wedding, Kingsley Shacklebolt warned the crowd that Voldemort had taken over the Ministry. It is unknown if Hagrid fought the Death Eaters that attacked The Burrow.\n\nOnce back at Hogwarts, Hagrid continued his jobs as gamekeeper and Professor of Care of Magical Creatures. At the request of the new headmaster, Severus Snape, Hagrid was placed in charge of students who had been assigned detention.[citation needed]\n\nDetention with Hagrid consisted of work in the Forbidden Forest, which was far safer than detention with Amycus and Alecto Carrow. Later that year, Hagrid narrowly escaped arrest after holding a Support Harry Potter party in his hut. He then went into hiding, presumably in the mountains, with his half-brother, Grawp. His escape was reported hours later on the radio programme Potterwatch.\n\nHagrid returned to Hogwarts with Grawp for the final battle. He rushed out onto the grounds to prevent injury being done to the Acromantula who had swarmed out of the Forbidden Forest and were climbing up the walls of the school. He was taken captive by the Death Eaters. When Harry appeared in the forest Hagrid shouted for him to run, though was silenced by Rowle and was forced to watch as Harry sacrificed himself.\n\nAfter Harry's apparent death at the Dark Lord's hands, Hagrid was forced to carry his body back to the castle, sobbing and crying non-stop, devastated over the loss of Harry. As the supposed \"victory party\" approached the castle, Hagrid yelled at the centaurs for refusing to involve themselves in the battle and help, but he burst into tears again before he could finish his scolding.\n\nWhen fighting resumed at the arrival of reinforcements, which included Buckbeak and Hagrid's herd of tame Thestrals, as well as the centaurs he had scolded earlier, Hagrid couldn't find Harry, as he used the Invisibility Cloak during the confusion. He then fought against the Death Eater Walden Macnair, presumably recognising him from both Buckbeak's trial and the mission to recruit the giants and threw him against the wall of the Great Hall, knocking him out. Hagrid was among the first to approach and congratulate Harry after Voldemort's ultimate defeat.[33] He was seen in the Great Hall among the other survivors of the battle.\n\nHagrid continued working at Hogwarts in the 21st century. Before 31 July in 2008, he took on the role of special messenger and delivered the Hogwarts acceptance letter to an unidentified Muggle-born student in their home. He also picked them up and helped them purchase school supplies in Diagon Alley, which included buying them their own owl.[34]\n\nOn 1 September, he led the first-year students across the Great Lake to the Hogwarts Castle on boats as usual. During the Sorting Ceremony, he brought in Ivy Warrington, who had been distracted by the bushes outside the castle and gotten lost.[35]\n\nThe next day, he picked up a copy of The Monster Book of Monsters and calmed it down after it went out of Robyn Thistlethwaite's control in the library. Robyn was frustrated at not being able to cast her spells right, so Hagrid suggested that she visit the Duelling Club. There, he watched Robyn and the unidentified student practise spells against Cassandra Vole and Fischer Frey.[35]\n\nDuring the 2009–2010 school year, a group of students came to Hagrid for help with the assignment given by the visiting History of Magic professor Jakub Gorski, which was to uncover a mystery about a lost treasure within the castle. At the time, he was preparing a butter-fly pie for his half-brother Grawp, and a Swooping Evil flew out of it due to the pie not having been completed. The students helped him capture the creature and finish the pie, and Hagrid told them about a map leading to a lost family heirloom, which were often whispered about by the portraits in the halls.[35]\n\nGrawp stayed with Hagrid until winter, during which he caused some disturbance at the school. Hagrid arrived in time when some students, who didn't know who Grawp was, were beginning to fight Grawp, and properly introduced him to them. Around Christmas, Hagrid wanted to give Grawp a present, and talked about what to choose with the unidentified Muggle-born student. They inspired Hagrid to come up with the idea of taking a picture with Grawp, so Hagrid went and got a camera, possibly from Argus Filch.[36] He had trouble getting it to work, though, so he summoned the student again to let them help him with it. The three eventually took the picture together.[35]\n\nDuring the 2010–2011 school year, before a Care of Magical Creatures class, Hagrid heard his students discussing their sightings of something in the Great Lake and talked about what he thought it might've been. Later, when the unidentified student provided enough evidence to let Hagrid believe it was a Kelpie, he talked to them about the creature's temperaments and offered suggestions on what spells to use when dealing with one, such as the Placement Charm for putting a bridle on it, and the Bubble-Head Charm to breathe underwater while riding it. After the substitute Study of Ancient Runes professor Elspeth MacGillony was arrested, Hagrid met with the involved students by the Great Lake and discussed the Kelpie, encouraging the unidentified student to take a ride.[35]\n\nAt some point, Hagrid was joined by Hogwarts alumna Luna Scamander for his investigation of the mysterious appearance of Manticores on the school grounds. They watched students playing on the Quidditch pitch, where they sighted baby Manticores heading towards the Forbidden Forest. Later in front of his hut, Hagrid introduced Luna to the unidentified Muggle-born student and talked about their mission of locating the potentially existing Manticore mother. After Luna went into the forest, Hagrid pointed the student to where she was, and welcomed them back when they exited the forest. Before Luna left, she entrusted her Magizoology suitcase to Hagrid and the student.[35]\n\nWhen a Dementor attacked Neville Longbottom and his students near Hagrid's hut, Hagrid arrived in time to check out the situation. He and the unidentified student brought Neville to the Hospital Wing and went to see Headmistress McGonagall to report the event. When more and more Dark creatures were preparing to attack, Hagrid helped other staff members and students put up a defensive barrier around the castle. He presumably also fought in the subsequent all-out battle against the creatures.[35]\n\nAround Hallowe'en, Hagrid prepared pumpkins in his patch to be used for the Hallowe'en feast, but they were accidentally destroyed by a Blast-Ended Skrewt went rogue. The students then sought to replant the pumpkins without letting Hagrid know, and after they succeeded, they revealed the big pumpkins to him. After the feast, Hagrid was playing the flute in his hut when he was heard by the unidentified student, and they played together. The students also talked to him about their dream of finding Hagrid having disappeared, and he assured them he would always be at Hogwarts.[37]\n\nOne year, he invited his good friend Long Shouren, a dragonologist, to help teach special Care of Magical Creatures lessons in a Dragon Paddock.[38]\n\nHe was still working at Hogwarts by 2017, at 89 years old, owing to the natural longevity of wizardkind, which also meant that he would likely have an extremely long life by Muggle standards. He invited Harry and Ginny's youngest son, Albus, to his hut for tea, just as he had done during Harry's first year.[33] Hagrid never married, despite his reciprocated attraction to Madame Maxime, as she was ultimately too sophisticated for them to be a good match.[2]\n\nIn 2019, Hagrid led the members of the then recently established Statute of Secrecy Task Force seeking a career as Magizoologists, welcoming them by saying that he could sense they were going to sign in as he was able to see that they shared a curious spirit and ensuring them that, although being a Magizoologist was far from easy, they could succeed if they had the spirit to withstand the difficult trials and could recover. He first took them to the Diagon Alley to buy several robes and other essential pieces of equipment required to handle beasts and creatures for increased durability before proceeding to successfully teach the Stamina Charm (despite his own being \"less-than-perfect\"), and allowed them to help him handle several live Fire Crabs. The primary takeaway they got from this, however, was a boost in their tolerance of pain. Hagrid also allowed task force members pursuing a Magizoologist career to work with his Blast-Ended Skrewts in an effort to increase their ability to withstand both mental and physical pain and gave those who chose to became an Auror an elective to raise their defences against beasts.[39]\n\nAfter undergoing hours of positive reinforcement through the use of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans, Hagrid was able to train fire-breathing chickens to hold their fire at a consistent temperature and to change the flames' temperature on command, enabling them to heat up cauldrons much quicker, with only the occasional burn risk. This technique helped enable members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force to increase the duration of the Baruffio's Brain Elixir brewed within these cauldrons.[40]\n\nHagrid later sent a \"lucky\" rabbit's foot to a Calamity Investigator working for the task force, claiming that it could hold Confoundables in place. The Calamity Investigator tested Hagrid's claims, finding that Confoundables seemed strangely drawn to the trinket, decreasing the chance of them fleeing. He also hosted a talk on creature care and quirks in the Ministry auditorium, bringing along several unusual, theoretically domesticable creatures. The talk was attended by the same Calamity Investigator, who became determined to own a pet Clabbert afterwards. Hagrid also lent the same Calamity Investigator his personal copy of The Monster Book of Monsters, which turned out to be more violent than the typical book, destroying the investigator's favourite mug, eating a chair leg, and shredding several pages.[40]\n\nHagrid later took the same Calamity Investigator on a trip into the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts to search for signs of the Calamity there, finding that the forest seemed to show no signs of the disaster, as it was rarely entered by humans. He also approached the same Calamity Investigator with the claim that the Calamity seemed to avoid taking Blast-Ended Skrewts as Confoundables, indicating that less common objects seemed to be shielded from the Calamity's effects. Hagrid later contacted the same Calamity Investigator again to help him deal with a sickness affecting the Hippogriff population in the Forbidden Forest. Although the situation initially seemed bleak, the Calamity Investigator was able to quickly turn it around, saving many Hippogriff lives.[40]\n\nHagrid was born to a wizard father and a giant mother, making him a half-giant. As a half-giant, Hagrid possessed great physical strength and endurance, including a resilience against some spells, though his ability to withstand spells was not as great as that of full giants. He was about twice as tall as an average man, standing at eleven feet, six inches tall[8] (too big for an ordinary-sized broomstick) and three times as wide, with a long mane of shaggy black hair and a beard that covered most of his face.\n\nHagrid's hands were as big as dustbin lids and his feet in their boots were like baby dolphins.[9] He had dark eyes that glinted like black beetles.[10] Hagrid's size often makes it difficult for him to enter rooms or buildings that are designed for ordinary sized people or not built with airy or grand designs, such as him not being able to fit easily into the Hospital Wing or The Burrow yet having no trouble moving in the Great Hall.\n\nHe often wore an exceptionally large moleskin overcoat with several pockets that held many things, though that sometimes caused him to spend a lot of time searching for what he wanted to find. Objects within the pockets have included any number of items, such as mouldy dog biscuits, the key to Harry Potter's Gringotts vault, peppermint humbugs, a squashy package of sausages, a copper kettle, a fire poker, wizard money, a birthday cake, birthday presents, a dirty spotted handkerchief, slug pellets, and a living owl. Hagrid's clothing is largely hand-made due to the descriptions of his clothing as being crafted of animal skin and far too large for a full-blooded or non-hybridised human being. Despite his love for beasts, Hagrid was allergic to cats.[41]\n\nHagrid was an incredibly warm, kind-hearted, intelligent, perceptive man, and would often forget his exceptional size and strength when patting people on the back. Another of Hagrid's greatest traits was his courage. He was also very loyal to his friends and was ready to defend them or fight for them if necessary. He was particularly loyal to Albus Dumbledore, describing him as a \"great man\". He would react with fury if anyone dared insult the headmaster and wouldn't hesitate to magically assault or rough up the offender. However, despite his loyalty, Hagrid was not good at keeping secrets and accidentally told Quirinus Quirrell, Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger, the secret of how to get past his three-headed dog, Fluffy, which all four of them used to get through to the Philosopher's Stone.[42] This was again shown when he revealed his half-giant status to Olympe Maxime, which Harry, Ron and Rita Skeeter all overheard, with the latter exposing it to the wizarding world by an article in the Daily Prophet.[31]\n\nHagrid had a great love of magical creatures, including cross-breeds such as the Blast-Ended Skrewt, and had a better relationship with most of the inhabitants of the Forbidden Forest than most people, including the centaurs, though he had little interest in tame magical creatures due to the lack of a challenge they offered. Despite this, he did show a good understanding of such creatures when he returned to his post as Care of Magical Creatures teacher, continuing lessons on unicorns after Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank.[20] Unfortunately he tended to overlook the dangers behind certain magical creatures, such as his dragon Norbert,[43] and his pet Acromantula Aragog, which was alleged by Tom Riddle to be the monster of Slytherin in 1943,[30] resulting in Hagrid's expulsion from the school. Hagrid never spoke about why he was expelled and would ignore any inquiries about it. Hagrid was fond of creatures in general and seemed to want to own any creature was even slightly fierce — his desires included a warthog and any dragon that he could get his hands on. He tended to give his pets ironic names, such as Fluffy for a vicious three-headed dog, and Fang, an affectionate Boarhound.\n\nDespite his gentle nature, Hagrid was still sometimes known to be aggressive, especially when people insulted or dishonourably attacked those he cared about. After Vernon Dursley claimed that James and Lily Potter deserved their fates and called Albus Dumbledore a \"crackpot old fool\",[44] Hagrid threatened Vernon with his pink umbrella. When Igor Karkaroff accused Dumbledore of treachery and spat at his feet, Hagrid lifted Karkaroff off the ground and slammed him against a tree, roaring at him to apologise to Dumbledore.[31] When some Aurors stunned Fang and Minerva McGonagall, he was so outraged and disgusted that he attacked the Aurors, furiously denouncing them as cowards[20] and when he was younger, threw Tom Riddle to the ground when he framed Aragog of opening the Chamber of Secrets.[19]\n\nDespite this, Hagrid was a very sensitive person and was known to burst into tears when someone close to him was harmed or killed, or when he felt responsible for something that put his friends in peril, such as drunkenly telling Quirinus Quirrell how to get past Fluffy and reach the Philosopher's Stone.[42]\nHis courage also concealed a deep fear of rejection and insecurity which was notably shown when he isolated himself after he was revealed as a half-giant and he attempted to resign from his position as the Care of Magical Creatures teacher until he was convinced otherwise by Dumbledore, Harry, Ron and Hermione.[31]  \nWhen he was teaching, he also had a tendency to lose his self-confidence if his classes were disrupted such as when Buckbeak attacked Draco Malfoy, or if he believed people disliked his classes,[30] which he mistook for people disliking him.[32] Although he overlooked certain dangers, Hagrid also avoided doing anything against the Wizarding Law when he was under pressure such as when he avoided setting Buckbeak free, fearing he would be put back in Azkaban,[30] and when he tried hard to avoid getting dangerous creatures when under probation by Dolores Umbridge.[20]\n\nHagrid was also a good and caring brother to Grawp, insisting on bringing him back to Hogwarts on finding he was being picked on for his (relatively) small stature by the other giants in his colony, and hiding in the forest, despite the frequent injuries and the trouble doing so caused him.[20]\n\nHagrid also had a fondness for drinks and enjoyed cooking for his friends. However, his tendency to mostly cook foods suitable for himself and a lack of understanding of what his friends preferred eating meant that his cooking was usually turned down politely.[45]\n\nFor a man who was expelled during his third year and rarely used magic as a result, Rubeus Hagrid was a rather good wizard, being considerably advanced, with some of his abilities even comparing to the N.E.W.T.-level academical difficulty. Being a Half-Giant, he also had magical abilities which stemmed from his giant blood, such as great superhuman strength and endurance along with a certain degree of spell resistance. Hagrid's hands-on and outdoor style of living allowed him to acquire other skills such as looking after magical creatures, craftsmanship, arbalist (crossbowman) skills and social networking within the magical community.\n\nRubeus Hagrid was born to Mr Hagrid, a wizard, and the giantess Fridwulfa. Fridwulfa left the family because her son was \"too small\" for her liking, though Hagrid never seemed to resent her for abandoning him, generally appearing relatively indifferent about his lack of relationship with her. His father, on the other hand, seemed to be a very caring man who was heartbroken when his wife left, and was amused by the fact that, at the age of six, Hagrid was large enough to be able to set him on top of a dresser.[18] Mr Hagrid died when his son was twelve years old, and by the time Hagrid tried to find his mother in 1995, she too had died, although he dismissed the issue on the grounds that he barely remembered her. On the other hand, he was saddened by his father's death, though he was at least glad that his father did not live to see Rubeus expelled from school.\n\nDuring his travels to the Northern giant colonies that same year, Hagrid found his maternal half-brother: an undersized giant called Grawp. As Grawp's size made it difficult for him to function within his colony, Hagrid brought him back to Hogwarts and hid him within the Forbidden Forest. As Hagrid and Maxime's mission had failed, it is extremely likely that Hagrid also brought Grawp back to prevent his half-brother from being enslaved by Voldemort alongside the other giants. Hagrid's attempts to raise and socialise Grawp initially appeared completely pointless; Grawp's progress in picking up English, or in curbing his violence, which often left Hagrid with a number of painful looking injuries, seemed almost non-existent.\n\nHowever, over the course of the year, Grawp grew increasingly attached to his older brother and was distressed by Hagrid's disappearance after Dolores Umbridge attempted to have Hagrid arrested in 1996.[20] By Albus Dumbledore's funeral, Grawp was relatively calm and presentable, and he even attempted to comfort Hagrid by patting him (though a bit too hard) on the head and later embracing him.[32] Grawp spent the first part of the Battle of Hogwarts stumbling around, yelling for \"Hagger,\" but eventually jumped into the fray, fighting the giants brought to the battle by Voldemort.[33]\n\nHagrid had a good relationship with most of his pets and other magical creatures, most notably Fang, Aragog,  Buckbeak, and Norberta. His relationship with most magical creatures was arguably better than the ones most other wizards had.\n\nFang was usually Hagrid's companion most of the time, although he was cowardly. Fang demonstrated some protectiveness towards Hagrid in spite of his cowardly nature such as when he attempted to protect Hagrid when Dolores Umbridge and some Auror's attempted to sack and arrest him. Hagrid, in turn, was also protective of Fang as he was enraged when the Aurors had stunned him, carrying his unconscious body as he fled Hogwarts, and immediately went after Fang when he was afraid during the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nHagrid had a huge friendship with Aragog, whom he had hatched in an egg when he was a student at Hogwarts. Hagrid protected Aragog when he was suspected to be the monster that opened the Chamber of Secrets, throwing Tom Riddle to the ground when he tried to curse him and sending Aragog to live in the Forbidden Forest. Hagrid managed to find Aragog a wife, Mosag, which allowed Aragog to have a family in the forest. Aragog, in turn, was grateful for Hagrid's friendship and protection to the point that he never directly harmed a human out of respect for Hagrid and commanded his family not to harm Hagrid while he was alive. However, this did not stop Aragog from letting his children and descendants attempt to eat Harry and Ron even though they were friends of Hagrid, claiming that he could not deny them fresh meat when it wandered into their midst. Hagrid was devastated when Aragog died and, along with Professor Slughorn, buried him near his Hut. Although Aragog's children and descendants did not hold back in attempting to devour Hagrid after Aragog's death, Hagrid attempted to protect them during the Battle of Hogwarts in honour of his friendship with Aragog, even though the Acromantulas were attacking both Death Eaters and Hogwarts defenders.\n\nHagrid cared greatly about Buckbeak as he tried hard to prevent his execution by the Ministry of Magic and was overjoyed when he managed to escape with Sirius Black, unaware at the time that Harry and Hermione helped him escape. Hagrid was later reunited with Buckbeak and looked after him when Sirius was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange. Hagrid briefly had a pet dragon named Norbert, whom he had acquired from a disguised Quirinus Quirrell in exchange for knowledge on how to get past Hagrid's three-headed dog Fluffy. However, since dragons were illegal, Hagrid reluctantly allowed Norbert to be sent to Charlie Weasley in Romania and was devastated to let her go. When inquiring about Norbert from Charlie six years later, Hagrid was shocked to learn that Norbert was a female dragon, having mistaken her for a male dragon, and of her being renamed Norberta. Although the full extent of Hagrid's relationship with Fluffy is unknown, Hagrid used Fluffy to guard the entrance of the Underground Chambers where the Philosopher's Stone was being kept and before he accidentally told Quirrell, was the only one apart from Dumbledore who knew how to calm him.\n\nHagrid also had a cordial relationship with the Forbidden Forest Centaur colony, especially with Bane, Ronan, Magorian and Firenze, and sometimes visited them whenever he went inside the Forest. However, Hagrid had a falling out with the centaurs when he defended Firenze from them as they believed Firenze had betrayed them by accepting the teaching post of Divination at Hogwarts, which was further complicated when he brought Grawp into the Forbidden Forest. During the Battle of Hogwarts, when Hagrid carried Harry, believing he was dead, back to Hogwarts, he was furious when the centaurs did not fight in the first half for Harry, accusing them of cowardice, which convinced them to fight in the second half of the battle. While Hagrid remained on good terms with Firenze, it is unknown whether Hagrid made peace with the other Centaurs after the battle ended.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore placed great trust in Hagrid, which Hagrid returned with fierce loyalty and unwavering admiration. This loyalty always flared up whenever someone insulted Dumbledore, one time causing Hagrid to give Dudley Dursley a pig's tail, and causing him to choke Igor Karkaroff another time. Hagrid would often describe Dumbledore as a \"great man\".\n\nWhile a professor, Dumbledore believed in Hagrid's innocence when he was accused of opening the Chamber of Secrets, and convinced then-Headmaster Armando Dippet to train Hagrid as the Gamekeeper and allow him to remain at Hogwarts.[19] Hagrid went on to join Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix as an adult, and he was the one tasked with bringing Harry Potter to Dumbledore after James and Lily Potter were murdered in 1981.\n\nDumbledore also trusted him to move the Philosopher's Stone from Gringotts Wizarding Bank to the school and believed Hagrid could offer Harry as much protection as \"a bunch\" of Ministry Aurors could while shopping in Diagon Alley, in 1996.[32] In 1995, Dumbledore gave Hagrid the difficult task of approaching the giant colonies of the North and dissuading them joining forces with Lord Voldemort, knowing Hagrid was fully capable of the delicate handling required to court the Gurg.[20]\n\nDumbledore additionally was the only one who supported Hagrid's decision to bring his giant half-brother Grawp with him back to Hogwarts after his mission to recruit the giants failed, allowing Grawp to stay in the Forbidden Forest and later having him sent to the mountains near Hogsmeade. After Albus Dumbledore's death, Hagrid was so devastated to the point that he was inconsolable, despite the best efforts of Olympe Maxime and even his half-brother Grawp.\n\nHarry Potter and Hagrid shared a special relationship. Hagrid was one of the first people (if not the first) Harry could remember showing him genuine kindness and appearing to truly care for him. Hagrid was the one who introduced Harry back into the wizarding world, and he empathised with Harry's situation, as they were both a bit different from wizarding norm and were orphans who had been more or less left to fend for themselves.\n\nHagrid was Harry's first true friend, and the two helped each other get through many difficult situations and constantly looked out for one another. Though Harry often took issue with Hagrid's penchant for collecting dangerous pets, as well as the fact Hagrid decided to bring his giant half-brother to Hogwarts,[20] he never failed to support Hagrid in his efforts to protect and care for all of them.\n\nWhen Harry learned about Hagrid's half-giant status, he never showed any concern about it, citing his relationship to the Dursleys as an example of how people should not be judged by who they were related to but who they were themselves. Hagrid's kindness and friendship allowed Harry to come to terms with how being an orphan never leaves you, as Harry witnessed Hagrid still mourning his father's death even over fifty years since he passed. This bond between two orphans and Hagrid's reassurance that Harry's parents would be proud of him helped Harry to live with pride in his family. Hagrid was also the one who first told Harry about who his parents were and gave him his first true look at his heritage and family.\n\nHagrid was shocked and horrified when Harry came to Voldemort to be sacrificed and yelled at him to run. Hagrid was devastated when he thought Harry was dead and openly sobbed in front of the Death Eaters and rebuked the centaurs for not helping Harry. Hagrid returned Harry to the forest and was very gentle with his body. Hagrid was delighted when he found Harry was alive and was among the first people to congratulate Harry after he defeated Voldemort for the final time.\n\nHagrid also met Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley through Harry, and he presumably remained in touch with all three of them well after their time at Hogwarts, as in 2017, Harry reminded his son, Albus, that he had been invited to Hagrid's Hut for tea upon his arrival at Hogwarts.[33] In many ways, Hagrid served as a pillar of strength for Harry, giving him his first look at just how kind people can be, and gave Harry his first taste of kindness, which caught on like wildfire and served to groom Harry into the selfless guardian and warrior he became. Suffice it to say, were it not for Hagrid, Harry could have ended up a profoundly different person.\n\nLike Harry, both Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley had a close relationship with the half-giant. Though Ron was openly outraged by some of Hagrid's more dangerous pets, particularly Aragog, Hermione was more reserved with her comments and tended to be more proactive than either Ron or Harry when it came to helping Hagrid protect his creatures. She tried desperately to help him appeal Buckbeak's death sentence in 1994,[30] and in her fifth year, she made every effort to ensure sure Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures curriculum would give Dolores Umbridge no excuse to sack him.[20]\n\nWhen Rita Skeeter revealed that Hagrid was half-giant in the Daily Prophet, both Ron and Hermione stood by him and convinced him that despite all the prejudice he faced, there were still people who loved him and wanted him to stay at the school. Hagrid was on the point of resigning, but with their encouragement, remained at Hogwarts and continued teaching. Ron did show a certain level of concern upon learning of Hagrid's shock, given wizarding history regarding giants; Hermione, on the other hand, noted in an unsurprising tone that she suspected it long ago, seeing as his size fit the profile.[31]\n\nThough Hagrid was himself a supporter of magical creatures, he disagreed when Hermione decided to create SPEW. Hermione pointed out how unhappy Dobby was being with Lucius, but Hagrid also pointed out that other house-elves considered him to be crazy.\n\nHagrid came to Hermione's defence during her third year when she was in conflict with the boys (as Ron believed her cat had eaten his rat Scabbers, and Harry was angry that she had gotten his Firebolt confiscated). Hagrid was able to convince Harry and Ron of how poorly they were treating their friend, and eventually, he succeeded in getting the two to reconcile with Hermione.[30] He also encouraged Hermione during her fourth year to ignore the hate mail as he had following Rita Skeeter releasing a nasty article about Hermione in Witch Weekly.\nIt is possible that Hagrid was close with Ron and Hermione's daughter, Rose Granger-Weasley and their son Hugo Granger-Weasley, as he was planning to have tea with Harry's son, Albus, in 2017.\n\nDuring the Triwizard Tournament, Hagrid began a romantic relationship with Madame Olympe Maxime, Headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy. They were often seen together, talking and walking around the grounds, and they danced together at the Yule Ball. Though the two had a minor falling-out when Hagrid implied (correctly) that Maxime, like him, was part-giant, they eventually reconciled and travelled together to appeal to the giants of the Northern colonies and dissuade them from joining forces with Voldemort. Maxime was also seen comforting Hagrid during Albus Dumbledore's funeral. The current status of their relationship is unknown, but as Hagrid never got married, it can be assumed that their relationship did not work out.[2]\n\nHagrid was two years below Tom Riddle at Hogwarts, and in Hagrid's third year, Riddle opened the Chamber of Secrets, unleashing a Basilisk on Muggle-born students. After the death of Myrtle Warren, Hogwarts was in danger of closing, and to prevent that happening, Riddle framed Hagrid and his pet Acromantula, Aragog, for the crime. Hagrid protected Aragog from Riddle, throwing him to the ground when he tried to curse Aragog, making Hagrid the only person to challenge Riddle while he was a student. Despite this, Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts and had his wand snapped in half by the Ministry of Magic.[19] Believing in Hagrid's innocence, however, Professor Albus Dumbledore convinced then-Headmaster Armando Dippet to allow Hagrid to stay on at Hogwarts as gamekeeper.\n\nTom Riddle never felt remorse for framing Hagrid and ruining his life. As Riddle went on to become Lord Voldemort, Hagrid joined the Order of the Phoenix to fight against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. In 1981, Hagrid was devastated by the murder of his friends James and Lily Potter but was relieved when the Dark Lord disappeared after failing to kill young Harry Potter. Although many thought that Voldemort was dead, Hagrid, agreeing with Dumbledore, believed that he would return one day, as he believed that he did not \"have enough human left in him to die\". As with most of the wizarding community, he refused to speak Voldemort's name, and generally referred to him as \"You-Know-Who.\" However, when he first explained Voldemort's background to Harry, he reluctantly said Voldemort's name. When Voldemort was searching for the Philosopher's Stone, he took advantage of Hagrid's love and knowledge of magical creatures and through Quirinus Quirrell, gathered the secret of subduing Fluffy through music from a drunken Hagrid, who was remorseful afterwards. Since Voldemort had a certain respect for Hogwart's professors, it is not known if that included Hagrid, who taught Care of Magical Creatures. This is unlikely considering Hagrid's half-giant status.\n\nIn 1995, after his resurrection, Voldemort dispatched his Death Eaters to convince the giants to join their side, while Dumbledore had sent Hagrid and Olympe Maxime to do the same. While Hagrid and Maxime were on good terms with the Gurg, Karkus, the Death Eaters supported the giant Golgomath in an uprising that resulted in Golgomath beheading Karkus and taking over the giant colony. The giants then attacked Hagrid and Maxime, who were forced to retreat.\n\nIn 1998, Hagrid fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and was captured by the Death Eaters. After Harry sacrificed himself to be killed, Voldemort ordered a grieving Hagrid to carry his friend's \"dead\" body in his arms, where it would be clearly visible to Harry's supporters. On the way back to the school, Hagrid expressed his fury with the centaurs for staying out of the fight, prompting them to join in soon after.[33] Hagrid was among the first to congratulate Harry after his defeat of Voldemort, showing his disdain for the Dark Lord.\n\nAlthough Hagrid's expulsion, and much of his later reputation for clumsiness, was originally Tom Riddle's fault, Riddle at least did not attach any special importance to his relationship with Hagrid, and at the Battle of Hogwarts, made no mention of their past. Hagrid, in turn, is never seen to admit to having known Riddle in their youth, and never referred to him except as 'You-Know-Who', or (once) by his preferred alias of Voldemort; indeed, Hagrid is terrified of him in the Battle of the Seven Potters, in spite of having known him. It was never confirmed if he ever knew that his former classmate and the Dark Lord were one and the same; however, since Hagrid said to Harry in 1991 that Voldemort was in Slytherin, it is likely that Hagrid knew.\n\nHagrid was on good terms with Molly and Arthur Weasley, who had both attended Hogwarts during the 1960s, while still Hagrid served as an assistant to his predecessor Ogg.[46]  He met them again in 1992, at Flourish and Blotts, when Arthur got into a fist fight with Lucius Malfoy. Hagrid broke up the fight and told Arthur that he should have ignored Malfoy, though he clearly sympathised with Arthur on acting the feelings Malfoy went out of his way to inspire. Hagrid was fond of the Weasley's due to their kind nature, immense courage, and their fair-minded views on Muggle-borns and half-humans like himself.\n\nTwins Fred and George Weasley were friends of Hagrid since their time at Hogwarts. Hagrid seemed to be one of their favourite members of the staff, as he had a sense of humour and was not anywhere near as strict as many of the professors, though he mentioned that he spent \"half his life\" chasing the twins away from the Forbidden Forest.\nHagrid also knew Charles Weasley quite well; Charlie had been one of the best Care of Magical Creatures students in his time at Hogwarts, and Hagrid described him as being \"great with animals\". He went on to study dragons in Romania, and Hagrid helped him with the dragons imported to Scotland for the Triwizard Tournament in 1994. Two years earlier, Hagrid had sent his pet dragon, \"Norbert\" to Charlie in Romania, and Charlie later informed Hagrid that \"Norbert\" was, in fact, actually \"Norberta\".\n\nBill Weasley also attended Hogwarts before working in Egypt with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, and Hagrid encountered him numerous times when he moved back to England. Bill arrived with the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, where he was attacked by Fenrir Greyback. Hagrid was invited to Bill's wedding to Fleur Delacour, in which Ginny, the youngest child and only daughter of the Weasley family, was a bridesmaid. Hagrid was quite fond of Ginny throughout her time at Hogwarts, and she was among the students who never even considered turning her back on Hagrid when she found out he was half-giant. Hagrid also knew she had a crush on Harry Potter, and playfully teased Harry about the fact in 1992.\n\nHagrid did not appear to have much of a relationship with Percy Weasley, though it is unlikely they would have been very close before the Battle of Hogwarts, even if they had had more contact. When Percy was employed by the Ministry of Magic, he did not show any sign of protesting against the Ministry's criticism of Dumbledore's decision to employ Hagrid, as he was a half-giant and Percy disbelieved Dumbledore's claims of Voldemort's return. He also tried to persuade his younger brother Ron to support the Ministry of Magic in favour of Dumbledore, to whom Hagrid was fiercely loyal. However, Percy abandoned the Ministry once it fell to Lord Voldemort, apologised to his family, and fought against the Death Eaters at the Battle of Hogwarts, after which Hagrid would have undoubtedly thought better of him.\n\nHagrid had been a good friend of Harry Potter's parents, Lily and James, since the time they attended Hogwarts. Hagrid admired them for being amongst the best wizards and witches of their age. Hagrid became a member of the Order of the Phoenix around the same time as James and Lily, and they fought together throughout the First Wizarding War. Hagrid was beside himself when Lily and James were killed in 1981; Albus Dumbledore sent him to rescue their infant child, Harry, from the wreckage of their home in Godric's Hollow, and Hagrid later reintroduced Harry to the wizarding world in 1991.\n\nHagrid knew them very well and conveyed the truth about them to their son, who had been lead to believe insulting lies about them and their deaths, restoring and preserving their legacy in their son. Hagrid also kept a leather-bound family album of them which he gave to Harry, which Hagrid came into possession of through unknown circumstances, but might have been entrusted to him by Lily and James to give to their son. Hagrid was known to respect them for their desire to fight for what was right.\n\nThough Hagrid described Sirius Black as having been a \"trouble-maker\" in his youth, Hagrid had clearly been fond of him, as well as his best friend, James Potter, when they were students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After graduating, Sirius, along with James, Lily Evans, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew, joined the Order of the Phoenix around the same time as Hagrid.\n\nWhen James and Lily discovered they were Voldemort's next targets, they went into to hiding with the use of the Fidelius Charm; Peter Pettigrew had been made their Secret-Keeper, unbeknownst to anyone else, and betrayed the Potters to Voldemort, framing Sirius for the crime. For many years, everybody, including Hagrid, believed Sirius was the betrayer. The night James and Lily died, Hagrid met Sirius in Godric's Hollow, where Hagrid had been sent to rescue the infant Harry Potter from the wreckage of the Potter's destroyed home, and Sirius lent Hagrid his flying motorbike to deliver Harry to Albus Dumbledore. By 1993, Hagrid was horrified to think that he comforted the \"murdering traitor\" that very night and deeply resented him for his betrayal, raging that had he knew, he would have attacked Black in retaliation.\n\nHagrid learned the truth in 1995 once Voldemort returned, a year after Sirius escaped from Azkaban and exposed Pettigrew as having been in hiding as Ron Weasley's pet rat, Scabbers. When Harry and Hermione Granger helped Sirius avoid the fate of receiving the Dementor's Kiss, they also saved Buckbeak, who was poised for execution as ordered by the Ministry of Magic, and in doing so, provided Sirius with transportation to make his escape.[30] Dumbledore re-instated the Order of the Phoenix in 1995, and following Sirius' tragic death during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996, Harry inherited Buckbeak, whom he sent back into Hagrid's care at Hogwarts.[32] Hagrid was saddened by Sirius's death and tried to comfort Harry the best he could, saying that having known Sirius, he was confident that Sirius wanted to go down the way he did, which he truly deemed a valiant way to die.\n\nHagrid would have known Remus Lupin for about as long as he knew the Potters and Sirius Black, though they did not appear to be particularly close until 1993 when Lupin was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, and they became co-workers. Both Hagrid and Lupin knew what it was like to be within the wizarding community, yet still considered outsiders and face its prejudices, as Lupin was a werewolf and Hagrid was a half-giant.\nIn 1995, they both joined the re-instated Order of the Phoenix and worked together throughout the Second Wizarding War to protect Harry Potter and bring about the end of Lord Voldemort.\n\nHagrid greatly respected Minerva McGonagall, the Transfiguration professor and Head of Gryffindor House. They attended Hogwarts around the same time (Hagrid having been expelled a few years before she started) and they later became members of the Hogwarts staff. As one of the most strict professors at Hogwarts, McGonagall sometimes disapproved of Hagrid's lack of refined behaviour, especially during the Sorting Ceremony. However, they were close friends and fellow members of the Order of the Phoenix in both wars.\n\nIn 1995, when Dolores Umbridge brought several Ministry officials to either have Hagrid forcibly removed from the school grounds, arrested, or both, McGonagall immediately came to Hagrid's defence; she took four simultaneous stunners straight to her chest as she rushed to Hagrid's aid, and was incapacitated for some time at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. Hagrid was disgusted and outraged when McGonagall got stunned to the point that he attacked the Ministry officials who injured her, furiously denouncing them as cowards.\n\nAfter Albus Dumbledore's death, McGonagall stated that she appreciated Hagrid's opinion very much, as Dumbledore had, and took it into consideration when determining the best time to close the school. McGonagall later became Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Hagrid was still living by 2017. Also, McGonagall showed no disdain when Hagrid drunkenly kissed her on the cheek at a Hogwarts Christmas celebration. On the contrary, she began to giggle and blushed. McGonagall was touched by Hagrid's defence of wanting to bury their mentor, Albus Dumbledore on Hogwarts's grounds, citing that no other Headmaster had given more to the school, and as such defended his stance on the matter.\n\nHagrid always stoutly defended Severus Snape against Harry's doubts and allegations, on the basis that Albus Dumbledore trusted Snape completely. When Snape killed Dumbledore, Hagrid initially disbelieved the fact and told Harry he must be mistaken but was later furious to learn that Snape had indeed killed the late Headmaster. Hagrid openly opposed Snape when he became the Headmaster of Hogwarts by holding a Support Harry Potter party (unaware Snape was secretly still on their side), an act which almost resulted in his arrest and forced him to go into hiding until the final battle. Before Hagrid fled, Snape put students in detentions with Hagrid, ensuring that they were protected from the harsher and torturous punishments from the Carrows. However, Hagrid eventually learned of Snape's true loyalties during the final confrontation of the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nHagrid and Argus Filch regularly found themselves at odds; Filch thought that Hagrid was \"an oaf,\" and even told Mrs Norris, his cat, to keep an eye on the Gateskeeper. Filch did not seem to care or even really acknowledge when Hagrid became a professor, possibly because he was a half-giant, and Hagrid, for his part, called Filch a \"sneakin' Squib\", when the latter insulted him.\n\nHagrid had been very familiar with Divination Professor Firenze, long before he began working at Hogwarts, and when the centaur's herd turned on him for entering into \"the servitude of a human\" by accepting the position at Hogwarts as a favour to Headmaster Dumbledore, it was Hagrid who saved him from being killed at their hands. Of all the centaurs Firenze seemed to be the most active in working against Lord Voldemort and was not above allowing Harry Potter to ride on his back in the process of saving Harry's life — a taboo among centaurs — both of which elicited great respect and gratitude from both Harry and Hagrid.\n\nHagrid also seemed to be on good terms with Horace Slughorn, the Potions master in 1996. It is possible that Slughorn was one of Hagrid's teachers at Hogwarts, but they later became co-workers. Slughorn attended Aragog's funeral and comforted Hagrid, and while this was mostly because he wanted to extract some of Aragog's valuable venom, Hagrid was touched nonetheless, and the two enjoyed a drunken salute to the late Acromantula.\n\nHagrid initially held Quirinus Quirrell in high regard, considering him a very talented and clever wizard, and initially seemed to have a good relationship with him, especially when he introduced Quirrell to Harry in the Leaky Cauldron. However, due to his loyalty to Voldemort, a disguised Quirrell later took advantage of Hagrid's love for magical creatures and manipulated a drunken Hagrid into revealing the secret of getting past Fluffy in exchange for a dragon egg. Hagrid was later horrified and guilt-ridden when he learnt of Quirrell's true nature after his death, calling him an \"evil git\" and blaming himself for Harry's injuries during his encounter with Quirrell and Voldemort.\n\nHagrid had a mixed relationship with Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank as while she worked as a substitute for Hagrid in Care for Magical Creatures and his gamekeeping duties when Hagrid was absent or had a mission to do, he slightly envied her teaching skills, which made other students (including Harry, Ron and Hermione) consider her a superior teacher to him for Care of Magical Creatures. This also made him accept Harry, Ron and Hermione's untrue claims of Grubby-Plank being a \"terrible teacher\" when they attempted to reassure him that they still cared for him despite not taking the subject for their sixth year. Grubbly-Plank on the other hand seemed to respect Hagrid for his skills and abilities despite the students considering her a better teacher than him, as she complimented Hagrid's training of the school's Thestrals and also kept silent about his mission to recruit the giants when Harry inquired her about his whereabouts, understanding the importance of his classified mission.\n\nHagrid disliked Gilderoy Lockhart, as did the other teachers, due to him being an annoyingly obnoxious and an incompetent teacher. Hagrid did not read any of Lockhart's books, rejected his ideas of Harry trying to hog the spotlight, and openly criticised him, something that he would normally not do to a teacher.\n\nThe professor with whom Hagrid had the most difficult and antagonistic relationship was, by far, Dolores Umbridge, who was a pure-blood supremacist with a particular dislike for what she called \"half-breeds.\" Throughout the 1995–1996 school year, she made Hagrid's life miserable with her disruptive evaluations of his teaching (part of her role as Hogwarts High Inquisitor, during which she was unabashedly condescending and critical.)\n\nWhen a student released two Nifflers in her office, following Headmaster Dumbledore's departure from the school, she blamed Hagrid, although he had a rock solid alibi. She later brought Ministry officials to Hagrid's Hut in the middle of the night, either to arrest or forcibly remove him from the premises, though Hagrid was able to resist with the help of Minerva McGonagall and go on the run.\n\nHagrid was disgusted by Umbridge's and the officials attack on McGonagall, attacking the Ministry officials in retaliation, although he refrained from attacking Umbridge in order to escape from Hogwarts. Following the Skirmish in the Forbidden Forest, Umbridge was eventually suspended from Hogwarts in 1996 and Hagrid was reinstated as a teacher. She was also imprisoned in Azkaban two years later for her crimes against Muggle-borns because of her actions as Head of the Muggle-Born Registration Commission.\n\nApart from Harry, Ron and Hermione and the other Weasley children (excluding Percy), Hagrid seemed to have a good relationship with Lee Jordan who was a friend of Fred and George Weasley as he once shook Hagrid's hand, along with Fred and George, when he returned after his mission to find the giants. Apart from them, the other students had a mixed relationship with Hagrid which was especially evident while he taught Care of Magical Creatures.\n\nAlthough many of the students had a relatively civil relationship with Hagrid outside his teaching, most of them considered Professor Grubbly-Plank a more qualified teacher for the subject since Hagrid sometimes lost his confidence and preferred teaching dangerous creatures.[31] The Gryffindor students expressed the most enthusiasm when he assumed the post but after Draco Malfoy caused Buckbeak to attack him by insulting him and when Hagrid preferred teaching monstrous creatures over creatures which were tame, their enthusiasm on the subject reduced.[30] Despite this, Hagrid arguably had the best relationship with the Gryffindor students as he was once a Gryffindor himself and was regularly seen supporting Gryffindor during Quiddich matches alongside the other Gryffindor students. Luna Lovegood believed that Hagrid was a poor teacher and said that Ravenclaw students considered him a joke.[20] It is unknown what relationship Hagrid had with the Hufflepuff students, although it is possible their relationship was also mixed like the other students. However, while the other students mostly disapproved his teaching methods, Hagrid had an antagonistic relationship with the Slytherin students as they, encouraged by Draco Malfoy, were also prejudiced against Hagrid due to his status as a half-giant,[20] and Draco's attack by Buckbeak, without caring that Draco did not listen to Hagrid in the first place.[30]\n\nHowever, despite Hagrid's mixed relationship with them, most of the students with the exception of Slytherin opposed Dolores Umbridge alongside Hagrid and disapproved of Umbridge's harsh and critical treatment of Hagrid due to her prejudice against part-humans. They also believed that Hagrid had improved in his teaching by the time he was temporarily sacked by Umbridge although many of them did not take the subject for N.E.W.Ts due to their past experiences with the dangerous creatures he taught. They were also extremely angry when Hagrid was attacked by Umbridge, again excluding the Slytherin students. Hagrid also opposed the Death Eater's control of Hogwarts alongside many of the students, including holding a Support Harry Potter Party in his Hut, and also fought alongside them against Voldemort and the Death Eater's during the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nHagrid was sent by Albus Dumbledore to inform Harry Potter of his true identity on Harry's eleventh birthday in 1991 after it was revealed that Hogwarts's letters to him were getting blocked by his uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, both Muggles who hated and feared magic.\n\nEventually, Hagrid found Harry and his family in an old shack out at sea (Vernon Dursley had become paranoid with the amount of Hogwarts letters arriving at their home, so he had temporarily vacated their home in the hopes that they would throw off any wizards possibly following them.) After giving Harry a birthday cake, he introduced himself to Harry, believing him to know everything about the wizarding world (from the letter left by Albus Dumbledore.) Upon learning that Harry knew nothing, Hagrid became furious at the Dursleys for not telling him anything.\n\nWhen Hagrid proceeded to tell Harry that he was a wizard, Vernon became angry and admitted that they had known for years and had been trying to \"stamp it out of him\", including admitting that they lied to Harry in telling him that his parents had really been killed in a car crash. This further enraged Hagrid, but Vernon continued to try and keep Harry from going to Hogwarts, going so far as to call Albus Dumbledore a \"crackpot old fool\". This, however, sent Hagrid over the edge; he lost his temper and used his pink umbrella to give Dudley Dursley a pig's tail. This terrified Vernon and Petunia enough to let Hagrid take Harry. Eventually, they would remove the pig tail, but the encounter added a newfound fear of magic to the Dursleys' hatred of it. The incident scared Dudley so much that he instinctively grabbed his bottom when meeting the Weasleys, despite them being friendly wizards.\n\nHagrid was disgusted by the Malfoy family's pure blood supremacist values, their open ill-treatment of Muggle-borns and \"blood traitors\", their allegiance to Lord Voldemort and their disrespect towards Albus Dumbledore; even going so far as to accuse them of 'bad blood', rather against the principles espoused by Dumbledore. In turn, the Malfoys disliked Hagrid, regularly mocking him and doing nearly everything in their collective power to get him sacked from his post at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\nIn 1992, Hagrid broke up a fight between Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy in Flourish and Blotts, though Hagrid was more sympathetic to Arthur. During the 1992–1993 school year, Lucius was indirectly responsible for reopening of the Chamber of Secrets, as he had used the earlier scuffle with Arthur Weasley to slip Tom Riddle's diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron full of books. Hagrid was blamed for the attacks, just as he had been fifty years earlier when he was framed by Tom Riddle for the Chamber's first opening. Hagrid was arrested as a precautionary measure by Cornelius Fudge, where Hagrid reacted angrily to Lucius's unnecessary presence and ordered him out. Lucius mocked Hagrid by wondering how his small hut could be considered a \"house\" and claimed he was only there to inform Dumbledore that he and the other governors had voted on his suspension. Hagrid saw through Lucius and accused him of threatening the other governors, which later proved to have been exactly the case.\n\nHagrid did not get along any better with Lucius's son Draco. Even before meeting Hagrid for the first time, Draco slandered him when talking to Harry Potter for the first time, describing him as \"...a sort of savage - lives in a hut in the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed\". Hagrid first met Draco in 1991 when he was Sorted into Slytherin. During that year, Draco was put in detention with Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Neville Longbottom. Hagrid called Draco an \"idiot\" when he scared Neville, and in 1992, was outraged when he heard Draco called Hermione a Mudblood. Draco was in Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures class in 1993 and ignored Hagrid's advice on how to handle Hagrid's hippogriff Buckbeak. Draco insulted Buckbeak, causing the hippogriff to lash out and cut Draco's arm. Hagrid took Draco to the Hospital Wing, but Draco swore revenge, and deliberately exaggerated his injury to get Hagrid into trouble. Lucius was furious when he found out and took legal action against Hagrid and Buckbeak. Hagrid tried hard to defend Buckbeak, but the court ruled in favour of Lucius, largely due to his influence at the Ministry, and Buckbeak was sentenced to death, but later freed by Harry and Hermione.\n\nIn Draco's fourth year, he openly disobeyed Hagrid by saying that he would not be coming down to look after the blast-ended skrewts, saying that he spent too much time with them during regular class. Hagrid, hearing about the previous punishment 'Moody' gave Draco, threatened to turn him into a ferret. Later that year, Draco happily provided Rita Skeeter with skewed details about the events of the previous year and delighted when Hagrid temporarily went into hiding following Skeeter's publication of the article revealing that Hagrid was half-giant. In his fifth year, Draco spoke negatively regarding Hagrid during Dolores Umbridge's inspection of a Care of Magical Creatures class conducted by Professor Grubbly-Plank, likely hoping that Hagrid would be placed on probation when and if he returned to Hogwarts, an outcome that did indeed come to pass.\n\nGiven that Draco's wife Astoria helped to raise their son to be a kinder man than Draco was in his youth, it can be assumed that Scorpius Malfoy had a better relationship with Hagrid than his father did. This is also likely due to Scorpius being best friends with Albus Potter who was already a good friend of Hagrid's before his first year.\n\nHagrid was friendly with most members of the Order of the Phoenix. Some of them were Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, the Weasley family, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, James and Lily Potter, Severus Snape, and Minerva McGonagall.\n\nHagrid also knew and greatly admired Alastor Moody, and Moody's protege, Nymphadora Tonks. They fought together in several battles, including the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of the Seven Potters, where Hagrid was devastated by Moody's death. Tonks later married Remus Lupin, and their son, Teddy, would attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry after both his parents were killed at the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nHagrid was also familiar with Dedalus Diggle, whom he introduced to Harry Potter at the Leaky Cauldron in 1991.\n\nAs Hagrid was a member of the Order of the Phoenix, he disliked the Death Eaters and tried to thwart their plans most of the time. The Death Eaters whom Hagrid knew the most were Severus Snape, Lucius Malfoy and his son Draco, clashing with Lucius before he was put in Azkaban, and had clashes with Draco while he taught Care of Magical Creatures.\n\nSnape, on the other hand, defected from Voldemort, and Hagrid defended him whenever Harry, Ron and Hermione criticised him, except when he temporarily believed that Snape had betrayed Dumbledore at the Astronomy Tower.\n\nApart from the Malfoys, Hagrid also had an antagonistic relationship with Walden Macnair, who was a polar opposite to Hagrid's love and admiration for magical creatures. They first clashed when Buckbeak was going to be executed, with Macnair being Buckbeak's intended executioner, then for a second time when Macnair persuaded the giants to join Voldemort and as a result foiled Hagrid and Olympe Maxime's own attempt to convince the giants to join Dumbledore, and a third time when Hagrid threw him across the Great Hall during the Battle of Hogwarts, knocking him unconscious. Hagrid also knew Igor Karkaroff, as he once choked Karkaroff against a tree and told him to apologise to Dumbledore for accusing him of complicity in an attack on Viktor Krum. Thorfinn Rowle also tried to attack Hagrid following the Battle at Astronomy Tower and set his hut on fire. He later angrily silenced Hagrid when the latter tried to discourage Harry from sacrificing himself.\n\nRubeus in Latin means \"red\".[47] The name suited Hagrid, as red could be for passion or emotion, \"an earthy, warm and physical man, lord of the forest\".[48]\n\nHagrid is the archaic past participle of the verb \"hagride\",[49] which means \"harass or torment with dread or nightmares\", and its etymology in turn is \"hag\" and \"ride\".[50] A hag is a nightmare spirit in English folklore. According to folklore, the Hag sat on a sleeper's chest and sent nightmares to him or her. When the subject awoke, he or she would be unable to breathe or even move for a short period of time. This state is now called sleep paralysis, but in the old belief the subject had been \"hagridden\".[51]\n\nHagrid also may mean \"hung over,\" as from alcohol.[citation needed]",
