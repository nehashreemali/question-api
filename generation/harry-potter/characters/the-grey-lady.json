  "content": "Helena Ravenclaw (c. late 10th century–early 11th century), also known as the Grey Lady,[8] was a witch and Rowena Ravenclaw's daughter. She attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Ravenclaw house.[5]\n\nAt some point after starting her education, Helena stole her mother's diadem and ran away to Albania. Her mother became fatally ill while she was away and, hoping to see her daughter one last time, sent the Bloody Baron, a man who harboured an unrequited love for Helena, to find her. In a fit of rage, the Baron murdered her when she refused to return with him, before he committed suicide out of regret for what he had done.[5]\n\nHelena and the Baron eventually returned as ghosts to Hogwarts Castle, where she became the house ghost of Ravenclaw House.[5] The Grey Lady Corridor was named after her.[9]\n\nHelena was born into the wizarding Ravenclaw family, to Rowena Ravenclaw, no earlier than 982 somewhere in the British Isles.[1]\n\nAt the age of eleven, Helena became part of one of the first generations of students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Scotland, which, at that time, was still being run by its original Founders. She was Sorted into Ravenclaw House and was educated in the magical arts by her mother during her time there.[6]\n\nAround this time, Helena met the Baron of Slytherin House. He fell in love with her, though she always rejected his advances.[5] She never found true love, as she never found anyone that lived up to her high standards for a partner.[10]\n\nEnvious of her mother's cleverness and importance, Helena, still during her school years,[11] stole her diadem and ran away, leaving Scotland forever and believing the item could help her become wise enough to surpass her mother. Ashamed of her daughter's betrayal, Rowena never admitted her daughter's treachery, hiding the fact that the diadem was no longer in her possession.[5]\n\nWhen Rowena fell fatally ill and ended up on her deathbed while Helena was gone, Rowena desperately asked the Baron, who was deeply in love with Helena, to find her daughter and bring her back to her so that she could see her one last time. Helena tried to hide from him, but the Baron managed to track her down to a forest in Albania. When she heard the Baron blundering through the forest toward her, she hid the diadem inside a hollow tree.[5]\n\nHelena refused to come with the Baron and rejected his affections again. Furious at her refusal and envious of her freedom, he stabbed her in a fit of rage with a knife. After seeing the full affect of what he had done, remorseful of his action, he stabbed himself to death.[5]\n\nHelena, now known as the \"Grey Lady\", returned from the dead as a ghost along with the Baron. They both returned to Hogwarts Castle, where they became the house ghosts of their former Houses, Ravenclaw[5] and Slytherin.[8] The Baron has been remorseful of his actions ever since, and carries heavy chains as a sign of penance.[5] Nobody else seems to know why both of them died nor why the Baron is covered in blood, not even the other Hogwarts ghosts.[8]\n\nAccording to Ravenclaw Prefect Robert Hilliard, while the most of the school sees the Grey Lady as a timid ghost, she maintains a good relationship with members of her own House and is particularly useful if they were lost, or had mislaid something.[12]\n\nDuring the last few years of Tom Riddle's education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he became interested in the subject of Horcruxes. Planning to create some in an effort to become immortal, Riddle favoured objects worthy of the honour.[13] He had apparently heard of Ravenclaw's Diadem and questioned the Grey Lady about it. Unaware of Riddle's true intentions, the Grey Lady found him flattering and understanding, revealing the secret about the magical item.[5]\n\nTom then travelled to Albania in order to turn the diadem into a horcrux. The Grey Lady seemed to regret revealing her secret to him after his atrocities in the First and Second Wizarding Wars.[5]\n\nWhen searching for information on Olivia Green, a previous student in Ravenclaw, Jacob's sibling sought her out, accompanied by several Ravenclaws (Tulip Karasu, Andre Egwu, and Talbott Winger). Tulip mentioned she once wept when Tulip talked about playing a trick on her own mother.[14]\n\nLater during the school year, Merula Snyde and Jacob's sibling spoke to her in the Ravenclaw common room to ask if she had seen Peeves. She was hostile when asked and refused to help them with Peeves.[15]\n\nWhen Tulip was having doubts about whether she had been Sorted into the right house, she allowed her to read the books in her personal archive for comfort.[7]\n\nOn 1 September 1991, the Grey Lady attended the Start-of-Term Feast. She arrived accompanied by the ghost of the Cavalier[16] and glided in through the ceiling near the Slytherin table. She stayed by the Ravenclaws during the Sorting Ceremony and watched as the new students were placed in their respective houses.[17]\n\nLater in the year, Nearly Headless Nick told the Grey Lady how a student in his own house named Harry Potter had been made Seeker for the house, Gryffindor.[18]\n\nOn 26 December, Harry Potter took Ronald Weasley with him to the storeroom containing the Mirror of Erised. On their way and under Harry's Invisibility Cloak, they passed the Grey Lady.[19]\n\nOn 4 June 1992, the Grey Lady seemed to have attended an advanced-students' Transfiguration class, and sat taking notes on one of the desks after the class was dismissed while Professor McGonagall wrote some notes of her own on her desk.[20]\n\nThe Grey Lady attended Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party. A party that featured numerous guests such as, the Headless Hunt and Moaning Myrtle. Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley were in attendance as well, the only living guests.\n\nThe Grey Lady was seen talking to another ghost near a table of mouldy food. Other house ghosts were there as well. The Fat Friar was seen talking to a man talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead and the Bloody Baron, whom the other guests steered clear of.\n\nOn the evening of 14 February, the Grey Lady sat in the common room of Gryffindor Tower at a table reading a book. She left when Harry Potter sat down at the table, who was investigating Tom Riddle's diary.[21] The Grey Lady presumably found another part of the castle in which to read her book. It can be assumed that she attended the End-of Term Feast, during which the students and staff welcomed Hagrid back from his short stint in Azkaban.\n\nBy 1995, there was a tetraptych depicting Helena Ravenclaw hung in the hallway outside the Hogwarts Library. The Grey Lady could be usually seen strolling along this corridor this school year.[22]\n\nIt is unknown if Helena helped the staff and students in their attempts to make Dolores Umbridge's position as the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor and later Hogwarts High Inquisitor increasingly difficult. It is also unknown if she believed Harry Potter's claims of Lord Voldemort's return.\n\nOn 1 March 1997, after Ronald Weasley was in the Hospital Wing after drinking poisoned mead, Harry Potter, Rubeus Hagrid and Hermione Granger passed by the Grey Lady, who \"drifted serenely past\" while talking about the Board of Governors and the closure of the school given the recent attacks on Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley.[23]\n\nAlbus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, was killed at the hands of Severus Snape in the former's plan on 30 June 1997.[24] The Hogwarts ghosts were known attendees of his funeral in early July; this likely included Helena Ravenclaw.[25]\n\nOn 1 August 1997, the British Ministry of Magic was taken over by Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters.[26] By 1 September 1997, Severus Snape was made Headmaster of Hogwarts while his fellow Death Eaters, Alecto Carrow and Amycus Carrow became the Muggle Studies and Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers respectively.[27]\n\nThe Carrows were put in charge of all discipline and punishments, which were violent. It is likely that the Grey Lady, as did the Heads of House, tried to protect the pupils from Alecto and Amycus.[28]\n\nOn 2 May 1998, the Battle of Hogwarts ensued after Lord Voldemort learned Harry Potter was in the premises. The ghosts, including the Grey Lady, attended a gathering in the Great Hall, in which Professor McGonagall gave instructions on evacuation of underage students and Kingsley Shacklebolt organised the participants for battle.[29]\n\nHarry Potter, needing information on the whereabouts of Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem, asked Nick who the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower was. Although he was initially slightly hurt that Harry needed another ghost rather than him, he pointed her out to him. She was initially reluctant to convey any information on the diadem's whereabouts, thinking that Harry sought the diadem in a desperate (and vain) attempt to sharpen his wits and thus increase his chances of defeating Lord Voldemort.\n\nHowever, letting it slip that she was Ravenclaw's daughter and learning that the diadem could be effectively used in Voldemort's destruction, she conveyed to Harry all necessary information for him to be able to figure out where Voldemort had hidden the diadem, therefore destroying nearly all the Horcruxes.[5]\n\nLater on, the ghosts gathered at the Great Hall, joining the mass mourning over the fallen.[30]\n\nAfter the death of Lord Voldemort and the end of the entire Second Wizarding War, the Grey Lady might have joined the party alongside other ghosts to celebrate Voldemort's demise. As for Harry himself, he is presumed to have kept the Grey Lady's true identity as a secret.\n\nDuring a Calamity surge in December 2020 focused on Grim Fawley's memories of Christmases spent at Hogwarts with ghosts and portraits of the Hogwarts founders, the Grey Lady suddenly developed a clear memory of Grim in which he asked her to \"help him search\" for something in the Grand Staircase when her Foundable was returned to her proper time.\n\nWhile patrolling the staircase, she encountered a Ravenclaw student and told them what she was doing, with the student informing Professor Minerva McGonagall of the situation. However, after this conversation, the Grey Lady completely disappeared, with McGonagall unable to locate her. Eventually, after extensive searching, the Grey Lady was located, with the ghost returning to her usual activities.[31]\n\nHelena was a tall[19] witch with waist-length hair. Harry Potter \"supposed that she was beautiful,\" but had trouble seeing through her proud and haughty appearance.[5] She carried herself in a serene manner.[23] Helena wore a floor-length cloak.\n\nA highly intellectual young lady, Helena was a scholarly, literary, and cultured woman, possessing a personal archive of books well after she had died.[10][7] Close to one-thousand years after her death, she still maintained her curiosity, enjoying attending Transfiguration classes[20] and reading.[21]\n\nHelena had high standards and never succeeded in love due to this.[10] Despite her evasive attitude, she had a thirst for importance and notability, therefore being very envious of her mother.[5] Despite this, Helena was evasive, as she didn't appear to like telling others about her past, not even that she was Rowena Ravenclaw's daughter. She was remorseful of what she had done, but also extremely angry at the defilement of the artefact and her mother's legacy, referring to the corrupted diadem as an abomination.\n\nHelena was serene yet somewhat taciturn. She had a preference to secluded places: she hid in a forest when she ran away from her mother,[5] hung around in deserted classrooms,[20] and chose a deserted Gryffindor Tower as a reading spot.[21] Though she claimed that generations of students had accosted her for the whereabouts of her mother's diadem and that she had dismissed them all, Helena was unable to resist the charming Tom Riddle and told him where it was, perhaps indicating a weakness or a desire to be loved. This led to the diadem being turned into a Horcrux, allowing Riddle to return and wreak havoc on the wizarding world.[5]",
