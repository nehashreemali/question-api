  "content": "The Bloody Baron (d. 11th century) was a wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the Founders' time and was Sorted into Slytherin House.\n\nAfter Hogwarts, he fell in love with Helena Ravenclaw, but she did not love him in return. He was sent by Rowena Ravenclaw to find Helena in Albania, but Helena refused to return with him and so he killed her in a rage. When he realised what he had done, the Baron committed suicide with the same knife.[8]\n\nAfter his death, he became one of the ghosts that haunts Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the house ghost of Slytherin House. Covered in Helena Ravenclaw's blood to this day, he earned himself the moniker of \"Bloody Baron\".[8]\n\nThe Baron was born into nobility, no earlier than 982.[1]\n\nAt the age of eleven, the Baron became part of one of the first generations of students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Scotland, which, at that time, was still being run by its original Founders. He was Sorted into Slytherin House and was educated in the magical arts by Salazar Slytherin for the seven years that followed.[7]\n\nSometime around this time the Baron met Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, whom he fell in love with, though she always rejected his advances.[8]\n\nLater on in his life, Helena, after stealing a diadem belonging to her mother that increased the intelligence of the wearer, ran away to Albania. Around this same time, Rowena fell fatally ill,[8] although legend has it that it was a broken heart,[9] possibly caused by her daughter abandoning her. Rowena ordered the Baron to go after her, which he did, eventually finding her hiding in a forest.[8]\n\nAfter he had found her, the Baron tried to compel her to return with him, but she refused, and, in a fit of rage, he killed her. Overcome with grief, he proceeded to take his own life with the same weapon he used to stab Helena.[8]\n\nThe Baron, as well as Helena, now known as the Grey Lady, both returned from the dead as ghosts, and returned to Hogwarts Castle, where they became the house ghosts of their former Houses, Slytherin and Ravenclaw respectively.[5]\n\nThe Baron had been remorseful of his actions ever since, and carried heavy chains as a sign of penance.[8] Nobody else seemed to know why he was covered in blood, not even the other two Hogwarts ghosts.[5] For unspecified reasons, presumably related to his apparently violent, dangerous nature, the Baron had gained Peeves's respect and was the only one, besides Professor Dumbledore, who could give him orders.[5]\n\nAccording to Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, groaning and clanking in the Astronomy Tower was a favourite pastime of the Baron's.[10] Also according to Sir Nicholas, the Bloody Baron had many times frightened a young Slytherin student in the Slytherin common room.[11]\n\nIn their search for the Marauder's Map, Jacob's sibling, along with Slytherin students Merula Snyde, Ismelda Murk, Barnaby Lee and Liz Tuttle, went to the Potions Classroom to ask the Bloody Baron about Duncan Ashe. The Baron revealed that Duncan was a ghost.[12]\n\nLater during the year, Merula and Jacob's sibling spoke to him in the Slytherin common room to ask if he had seen Peeves. However, he refused to part with any information about Peeves and was not much help to them.[13]\n\nOn 1 September 1991, the Baron attended the Start-of-Term Feast, where he sat next to first year Draco Malfoy, who did not look too pleased with the seating arrangements.[5]\n\nA while before midnight on 12 September 1991, the Bloody Baron passed twice by the Fat Lady's Corridor, frightening Neville Longbottom, who was sleeping in the corridor because he had forgotten the new password to get into Gryffindor Tower.[14]\n\nShortly prior the Hallowe'en feast on 31 October, the Baron haunted the Dungeons.[15]\n\nIn the evening of 4 June during their quest to save the Philosopher's Stone from Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger, all under the Cloak of Invisibility, were intercepted by Peeves who threatened to call Argus Filch if whoever that was there did not show themselves. Harry Potter, in a hoarse whisper, proceeded to impersonate the Baron.[16]\n\nIt can be assumed that the Baron attended the Start-of-Term Feast with the other ghosts, as they seem to do every year.\n\nOn the evening of 31 October 1992, the Baron attended Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party. The other ghosts appeared to avoid him during the celebration.[17] This was most likely due to his ghoulish blood-stained appearance and the shackles he wore.\n\nHe spent Christmas day strolling the dungeons by the Slytherin Dungeon.[18]\n\nIn the afternoon of 1 September 1994, the Hogwarts ghosts gathered to decide whether Peeves should be allowed to attend the Start-of-Term Feast. The Fat Friar wanted to give him another chance, but both Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington and the Bloody Baron decided against it. As a result, Peeves wreaked havoc in the kitchens, spilling soup all over the place and scattering pots and pans everywhere.[19]\n\nLater in the year, the Baron encountered Harry Potter and Ron Weasley in the North Tower, while they were talking about Sybill Trelawney's alleged predictions of Harry's death.[20]\n\nBy 1995, there was a tetraptych of the Baron hung in the dungeon cupboard. He would frequently haunt this area of the Dungeons during this school year.[21]\n\nDuring the Start-of-Term Feast, on 1 September 1995, Ronald Weasley managed to inadvertently insult Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, by saying the ghost was afraid of the Bloody Baron when he said he would never dream of seeking an argument with the Baron.[22]\n\nA week later, on 7 September, Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington looked for the Baron to see if he could dissuade Peeves from dropping a bust of Paracelsus on top of anyone who passed the corridor in which the bust stood.[23]\n\nIn the early hours of 22 April, 1997, the Bloody Baron saw Albus Dumbledore return to the Castle from one of his missions to find Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, and reported it to Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington. He later retreated to the Astronomy Tower where he liked to groan and clank.[10]\n\nOn 2 May 1998, the Battle of Hogwarts ensued after Lord Voldemort learned Harry Potter was in the premises. The ghosts, likely including the Baron, attended a gathering in the Great Hall, in which Professor McGonagall gave instructions on evacuation of underage students and Kingsley Shacklebolt organised the participants for battle.[8]\n\nLater on, the ghosts gathered at the Great Hall, joining the mass mourning over the dead.[24]\n\nIn December 2020, during the Calamity, the Bloody Baron suddenly developed a clear memory of Grim Fawley after the return of the Baron's Foundable to his original time. He grumbled that Grim had \"invaded his mind\", being overheard by Neville Longbottom, who sent an owl to Harry Potter regarding the situation. However, the Baron refused to speak any further about the issue when questioned by Harry.[25]\n\nAs a ghost, the Baron was very pale,[6] pearly-white and slightly transparent.[5] He had wide, staring,[20] black eyes[5] and a gaunt face.[5] He dressed in robes covered in silver bloodstains,[19] and carried chains in a final act of penitence for having murdered Helena Ravenclaw.[8]\n\nHe sported a curly powdered wig, fashions closer to the 17th century than the 10th, and carried his sword.[26] He spoke in a hoarse whisper.[16]\n\nDuring his lifetime, the Baron was described by Helena Ravenclaw as a \"hot-tempered man\". He insisted on having his way in interactions, responding with violent uncontrolled anger when contradicted.[8] As a ghost, he was frightening and most people did not seem to enjoy his presence,[5] not even his fellow ghosts.[17]\n\nHowever, he seemed to have a cordial, if not friendly, relationship with the ghost of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington,[10] despite Ronald Weasley's allegations of the latter being \"terrified\" of him.[22] The Baron seemed to be intolerant towards Peeves, who was scared of him,[16] and could not bear his lack of civilisation, putting \"his foot down\" over the Poltergeist's potential presence at the 1994 Start-of-Term Feast.[19]\n\nHe also seemed to have a great deal of House pride; before Harry Potter's arrival at Hogwarts, Slytherin had won the House Cup for six years in a row, and the Baron had become \"unbearable\" according to Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington.[5]",
