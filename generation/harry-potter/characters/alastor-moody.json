  "content": "Auror Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody (died 27 July 1997)[12] was a pure-blood[4] wizard, considered to be one of the best Aurors of all time.[11] He was a pivotal member of the Order of the Phoenix during the First and Second Wizarding Wars. Moody served with distinction during the first conflict, gaining a reputation as a skilful battler against the Dark Arts and sacrificing an eye, a leg, and part of his nose during the conflict.[13]\n\nAs an Auror, he played a role in the imprisonment of many of the inhabitants of Azkaban. According to Charlie Weasley \"half the cells in Azkaban are full because of him.\" This activity led to his gaining many enemies and resulted in his becoming overly-cautious and paranoid about his security later in life.[11]\n\nIn 1994, he agreed to Albus Dumbledore's request to become the new Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts.[11] However, he was kidnapped just prior to taking up the position by Bartemius Crouch Junior, who subsequently disguised himself as Moody as part of a plan to kidnap Harry Potter on the instructions of Lord Voldemort.[14]\n\nFollowing his rescue from Barty Crouch Jnr, Moody joined the second Order of the Phoenix and fought in a number of the Second Wizarding War's battles, including the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996[15] and the Battle of the Seven Potters in 1997,[12] dying during the latter.[2]\n\nHis magical eye was later used by Dolores Umbridge to spy on her subordinates in the Muggle-Born Registration Commission. It was later retrieved by Harry Potter when he infiltrated the Ministry of Magic in 1997,[16] and was given a proper burial by Harry in the forest close to the location where the 422nd Quidditch World Cup had been held three years prior.[17]\n\nAlastor Moody was born into the pure-blood Moody family. The precise date of his birth is unknown.[4] His father and mother were both Aurors,[8] as were many of his ancestors - the Moody family gained a reputation for producing many \"renowned Aurors.\"[4]\n\nMoody bought or inherited his wand at some point before his formal magical education began. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but his House is unrecorded in Ministry records.[4] He was known to be an excellent student, however, gaining at least an 'Exceeds Expectations' mark in five N.E.W.T. subjects.[18]\n\nHe eventually became an Auror,[11] and would have had three years of training like every other Auror.[6]\n\nMoody, during his time as an Auror, served the Ministry of Magic, fighting Death Eaters under Lord Voldemort's command. He was a key member of the Order of the Phoenix, led by Albus Dumbledore, in the struggle to defeat Voldemort, and his efforts were said to have led to half the cells in Azkaban being populated by Death Eaters he captured.\n\nAs the war continued, and the situation grew more fraught, the Ministry of Magic authorised their Aurors to use Unforgivable Curses against Death Eaters, a practice which continued for a time after Voldemort's fall from power. Moody was known to have killed a number of Voldemort's followers, including Evan Rosier in 1980 and possibly Wilkes around the same time.[19] However, he did not kill if not necessary, and, having spent six months tracking Igor Karkaroff, managed to capture him alive around the same time.[13]\n\nIt is believed that it was his activities during the First Wizarding War and his time as an Auror that led to Moody losing a leg (replaced by a wooden prosthesis). His work also led to significant facial scarring, including losing a piece of his nose in his fight with Rosier.[13]\n\nIgor Karkaroff was sent to Azkaban and held there until he offered to give up the names of a number of his fellow Death Eaters in exchange for a lighter sentence. Moody was present at Karkaroff's trial held sometime after Voldemort's fall on 31 October 1981, where he made his dislike of the defector very clear. The former Death Eater offered in vain the names of Antonin Dolohov, Evan Rosier, Travers, Mulciber, and Severus Snape, all of whom seemed to have already either been killed, captured, or defected.\n\nHowever, he successfully named Augustus Rookwood, an Unspeakable, and a double-agent spying on the Ministry for Voldemort. This was news to the Ministry, but Karkaroff was sent back to Azkaban, pending a review into Rookwood's case. When Karkaroff's allegations proved true, he was released, and he went on to take the position of Headmaster of Durmstrang Institute.[13]\n\nMoody likely continued hunting down straggler Death Eaters. In the years after the war, he had some kind of battle that made him lose his left eye, and it was replaced with a magic prosthetic.[13] Moody later wrote a report about the incident, detailing how he lost his left eye and managed to defeat his foes despite his physical impairment.[20] By the late 1980s,[21] Moody had retired from active Auror service.[22] Later, he took Nymphadora Tonks under his wing and helped in her Auror training.[6]\n\nIn June 1989, Moody Apparated to the Three Broomsticks Inn and told Jacob's sibling they had much to talk about. He then Disapparated with the student and swore them to secrecy. The two returned to the Three Broomsticks several hours later, when everyone except Rowan Khanna had left to graduation.[21]\n\nAfter the summer holidays, Moody and Jacob's sibling met up at the Hog's Head Inn, where Moody revealed more information about R, including Patricia Rakepick's membership in it and the group's goal to locate the final Cursed Vault.[23] Later, Moody heard about the student's plan to sneak into the Ministry of Magic with an Invisibility Cloak to get to Rakepick's artefacts and went after them to stop them. Moody found Jacob's sibling in the Hog's Head Inn under an Invisibility Cloak and informed them that it would not be enough to fool the Ministry. Moody told Jacob's sibling to prepare to fight for their life.[24]\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year, he met with Jacob's sibling again when the student and Nymphadora Tonks were assigned to him during their participation in the Ministry of Magic student programme, a Ministry-sponsored programme that allowed seventh-year Hogwarts students to experience various careers first-hand. During their time with the Auror Office, the students helped Moody track down a rogue alchemist whose fake panacea gave several victims boils.[25]\n\nIn mid-1994, Albus Dumbledore convinced Moody to come out of retirement and serve as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry's latest Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Around this time, Moody violently tore apart a birthday present, paranoid that it might have been a cleverly disguised Basilisk egg, but it turned out only to be a carriage clock.[26]\n\nBefore the school year began, however, Moody was attacked in his home by Bartemius Crouch Junior and Peter Pettigrew, at Voldemort's order. Moody proved more difficult to overcome than initially thought and put up a significant fight, which alerted his Muggle neighbours, but was overpowered and imprisoned in his own magical trunk. This was done as part of Voldemort's plan to regain power.[14]\n\nTo this end, Crouch used Polyjuice Potion to take on Moody's form to replace him at Hogwarts, successfully fooling staff and pupils alike. He imitated many of Moody's normal habits, including regularly drinking Polyjuice Potion out of Moody's hip flask. Doing this allowed him to impersonate Moody for almost the whole year without raising suspicion.[14]\n\nAll the while, Crouch did his part in Voldemort's plan. Moody's life was spared due to Crouch needing his hair to create the Polyjuice Potion and wanting to question Moody for his behaviour, patterns, and such so Crouch could successfully imitate him, all the while keeping Moody captive under the Imperius Curse.[14]\n\nWorking hard and using all of his cunning, Crouch, as Moody, ensured that Harry Potter would get into the Triwizard Tournament and ascend to the Third Task. Upon doing so, Voldemort used Harry Potter to return to life in a body of his own with all his powers once again. When Crouch learned of this upon Harry's return, he tried to murder him, but Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, and Severus Snape stopped him.\n\nThe professors waited patiently for the Polyjuice Potion to wear off, revealing Crouch's true form. Under the influence of Veritaserum, he admitted everything and Moody was freed from his trunk.[14] After recuperating in the Hospital Wing, Moody returned to health in time to sit at the staff table for the Leaving Feast, as he was the designated DADA teacher, though he hadn't actually taught many (if any) classes due to his unfortunate predicament.[27] In his own opinion, Moody certainly didn't consider himself a \"professor\" because of his lack of actual teaching.[6]\n\nThough he physically recovered completely from his ordeal, he was (if possible) even more paranoid for his safety than before.[27] In the aftermath, his eye occasionally got stuck in mid rotation as a result of Crouch having worn it, necessitating regular cleaning.[6]\n\nIn 1995, Moody joined the reformed Order of the Phoenix. He was part of the Advance Guard that took Harry Potter from 4 Privet Drive to the Order of the Phoenix's headquarters in 12 Grimmauld Place. While in 4 Privet Drive, he remarked that his magical eye had developed a tendency to stick as a result of Barty Crouch Jnr having worn it for a year.[6] He later showed up for the party Molly Weasley threw for Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger to celebrate their becoming prefects.\n\nHe mentioned that Albus Dumbledore must have assumed Ron was good at resisting spells, or he would not have put him in authority. He, along with Sirius Black and Remus Lupin, checked that something inside a writing case in a spare room was indeed a boggart. Moody also showed Harry an old picture of the original Order of the Phoenix and described the members. He seemed to think it was very interesting, although Harry was a little disturbed to hear about Moody's descriptions of many of the original members' deaths.[28]\n\nLater on in the summer, Moody was one of the guards tasked with escorting Harry to the Hogwarts Express along with Nymphadora Tonks in order to ensure Harry's safety, as Lord Voldemort had returned to power.[6] Moody was constantly vigilant during this outing and was keen to get Harry on the train as quickly as possible.\n\nDuring the Christmas of 1995, Moody along with Tonks accompanied Harry, Hermione, and the Weasleys to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries to visit Arthur Weasley, who had been attacked by Lord Voldemort's snake, Nagini.[29]\n\nHarry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, and Ginny Weasley all went to the Ministry of Magic in 1996 in an attempt to rescue Sirius Black, who they believed was being tortured by Lord Voldemort. This was actually a lure to get Harry into the Department of Mysteries to retrieve a prophecy, and, after discovering this, the members of Dumbledore's Army fought back against the Death Eaters and attempted to escape.[15]\n\nAfter his friends were injured, Harry was about to surrender the prophecy to Lucius Malfoy, who had been leading the group of Death Eaters, but then Sirius, Nymphadora Tonks, Remus Lupin, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Moody himself, all members of the Order of the Phoenix, arrived and the battle resumed. During the battle Moody duelled with Antonin Dolohov and was injured. Sirius was killed by his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, when she hit him with a spell that knocked him through the Veil in the Death Chamber.[15] Following this battle, Albus Dumbledore arrived and duelled Voldemort himself. Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge witnessed Voldemort fleeing the scene and was forced to finally admit the Dark Lord had returned.[30]\n\nAfter having recovered after the battle, Moody, Tonks, and Lupin came to King's Cross Station to tell the Dursleys to start treating Harry with respect at their home. When an intimidated Vernon Dursley asked if Moody was threatening him, Moody showed him his magical eye, which frightened Vernon very much.[31]\n\nIn June 1997, Hogwarts was invaded by Death Eaters in an attempt to assassinate Albus Dumbledore,[32] although they were once again opposed by several members of Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix.[33] Severus Snape was believed to be a traitor after killing Dumbledore[34] (although it had actually been on Dumbledore's own orders)[35] and Moody personally put extra protections on 12 Grimmauld Place to prevent Snape and the other Death Eaters from entering.[36]\n\nMoody also attended Dumbledore's funeral along with several other members of the Order of the Phoenix, various Hogwarts students, and other employees of the Ministry. After the funeral, he became the new leader of the Order of the Phoenix.[37]\n\nAs it turned out, Moody's over-protectiveness of Harry Potter would be his doom. Shortly before Harry's seventeenth birthday, Moody and a team of seven Order of the Phoenix members tried to move Harry away from 4 Privet Drive to The Burrow, using broomsticks, Thestrals, and a flying motorcycle to reach a network of carefully-placed Portkeys, when the original plan proved useless following Pius Thicknesse's subversion. Moody was partnered with a reluctant Mundungus Fletcher, who didn't want to participate in the move out of fear.[12]\n\nThe team was ambushed by Death Eaters on take-off. Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour witnessed and reported what had happened. Moody and Fletcher were heading north, close by Bill and Fleur, after the Order members scattered.[12] Voldemort, using his ability to fly, went straight for them, as he believed Harry would be flying with the most skilled witch or wizard in the Guard, which was Alastor Moody. Fletcher panicked, crying out, and Moody tried to stop him, but Mundungus Disapparated, leaving Moody vulnerable to attack.\n\nVoldemort fired a Killing Curse when Mundungus Disapparated, which hit Moody in the face, killing him. Moody fell backwards off his broom and about a thousand feet to the ground. Because half a dozen Death Eaters were on their own tail, Bill and Fleur could do nothing.[2]\n\nThe Ministry, meanwhile, did not report Mad-Eye's death, as Rufus Scrimgeour did not want to admit the truth about Voldemort's power, or the recent Azkaban breakout (which had resulted in the large numbers of Death Eaters attacking the Order).[38]\n\nMoody's broken body was quickly retrieved by the Death Eaters, who were prompt in tidying up after themselves. Bill Weasley and Remus Lupin left to recover it but failed, as it had been difficult to know where Moody might have fallen, given the darkness and the confusion of the battle. As a result, the Order could not hold a funeral for Moody, although they did hold a brief toast for him once they were all safely at The Burrow. Ron Weasley held out hope for Moody's survival, but Harry and Hermione Granger promptly pointed out the flaws in his logic, and so all, in the end, accepted the truth, but the shock and sadness were great for everyone.[38]\n\nMad-Eye's magical eye was salvaged by the Death Eaters and then, after the fall of the Ministry, given to the Muggle-Born Registration Commission's Head, Dolores Umbridge, possibly as a gift. It was set in the wood of her office door and used to aid her in spying on her workers. When Harry, Hermione, and Ron infiltrated the Ministry to find the locket Horcrux, Harry discovered the eye and, disgusted by how it was being used, stole it. Doing so, however, raised the alarm.[16]\n\nAfter escaping, Harry, early the next morning and before the other two were awake, left the tent they were staying in to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled and resilient-looking tree he could find. Then, in its shadow, he buried the eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. While it wasn't much, Mad-Eye Moody was given a proper burial.[17] As a result of his influence, the members of the Order seemingly adopted Moody's paranoia-based caution, as Lupin asked Harry a security question after they made it to The Burrow,[2] and Harry later did the same on Lupin in 12 Grimmauld Place.[39]\n\nAfter the final defeat of Voldemort, Harry followed in Mad-Eye's footsteps by becoming an Auror,[40] and, sometime after becoming the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement in 2007,[41] he ensured that a long line of successive Dark wizard catchers at the Ministry got to benefit from Moody's example by including assignments inspired by the life and ways of Mad-Eye on the Auror recruitment programme. This included a series of participatory training exercises that required Aurors in training to be on their feet and continuously defend themselves for over an hour aimed at increasing the amount of damage they would be able to withstand in combat, a lesson on his myriad career accomplishments and his by then famous mantra.[42]\n\nBy the 2008–2009 school year, a portrait of him had also been mounted on the wall at the Grand Staircase at Hogwarts in commemoration of the fallen warrior, hung on high alongside those of hundreds other distinguished alumni of the school.[43]\n\nDuring the 2010s, Mad-Eye appeared as a Foundable during the Calamity. Volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force were able to free him, allowing Mad-Eye to return to his original time.[20]\n\nAuror members of the task force were shown a series of training techniques inspired by Mad-Eye, requiring them to stay on their feet and defend themselves for over an hour and increasing the amount of damage they could withstand in combat. These task force members also attended a lesson on Moody's work, including his creed of always remaining on guard. A Calamity Investigator working for the task force also read through his report on the battle which cost him his left eye, inspiring them to utilise pain as power and increasing their chance of landing Critical Casts on Adversaries in Feared Chains.[20]\n\nMoody was described as having a growling voice and looking as though his face was roughly carved from wood. Due to injuries from his long career as an Auror, it was covered with scars, and a chunk of his nose was missing. He had dark grey, grizzled hair. He also had a wooden leg that was described as having a clawed foot.\n\nHis eyes, however, were described as his most shocking feature: one was small and dark while the other was a vivid, electric blue magical eye that moved around independently from his normal eye, giving him the nickname of \"Mad-Eye Moody\", or simply \"Mad-Eye\". This eye could see through objects, Invisibility Cloaks, and the back of his own head.\n\nAlastor Moody was tough, brave and a consummate survivor, as well as an excellent fighter. He had a gruff, surly disposition. Having encountered many dangerous experiences throughout his career, he was hyper-paranoid and thought of by many as being delusional.[11][26]\n\nMoody prepared all of his own meals and drank only from his personal flask in case someone tried to poison him.[14] He was also very distrusting of most people, being very careful whom he relayed facts about his personal life to. He kept what he considered to be important information back even from his colleagues and superiors in the Ministry of Magic, such as his birthplace and which House he was Sorted into during his attendance at Hogwarts. The latter was probably due to him keeping in mind that the House could identify some of his more essential personality traits, making it easier for the enemy to find weaknesses in his psychological defences.\n\nDespite his paranoia, Moody was a brave individual. He never hesitated to go up against powerful Dark wizards, including Lord Voldemort himself. Indeed, his plan for getting Harry Potter to safety involved using himself as a decoy knowing that Voldemort would likely go after him. This demonstrated both confidence in his own skill and a willingness to protect the rest of the Order members from Voldemort.[12] It's likely that he knew that he could easily be killed during this encounter, suggesting that he didn't fear death. Indeed, he seemed to see being killed in battle as something to be proud of, as shown by his proud descriptions of the deaths of members of the previous Order of the Phoenix.\n\nAt the same time, he was far from being devoid of attachment towards his allies and comrades. He was visibly saddened by the insanity of Alice and Frank Longbottom, noting how being dead would have been better than having to live the rest of their lives insane, and openly acknowledged he was never able to find it easy to get over the loss of a comrade and that only by turning the sadness he felt into motivation to get justice was he able to move on, as seen by his expressing sympathy towards Jacob's sibling after they lost Rowan Khanna and even acknowledging he should have trained them well enough to properly defend Rowan.\n\nHe also had a well-known habit of being set off by sudden noises or movements in his presence, even attacking a witch who shouted \"boo\" at him on April Fools' Day. He even destroyed a birthday present carriage clock, believing it was a cleverly disguised Basilisk egg,[26] and was described in a Daily Prophet article as having left the Ministry when deemed \"Unable to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder.\"[22] This only intensified after he was freed from nine months of being imprisoned inside his own trunk.[14]\n\nMoody was a great wizard in his day and the most effective Dark wizard hunter that the Ministry of Magic ever had. Nearly half of the cells in Azkaban were full because of Moody.[11][13] He had the ability to think like a Dark wizard, which helped him track so many down. This also allowed him to outwit Voldemort during the Battle of the Seven Potters, where he accurately predicted that Voldemort would believe Harry to be guarded by the most powerful members of the Order.[12] He was also a staunchly loyal friend and supporter of Albus Dumbledore and one of the Order of the Phoenix's most powerful and reliable allies.[6][37] He despised those who practised the Dark Arts, labelling such people as \"filth\", and relished the idea of Dark wizards being left at the mercy of the Dementors.[13]\n\nAlastor Moody was said to be the most skilled Auror in the British Ministry of Magic. Despite his skills being somewhat diminished by the Second Wizarding War, he was still a highly valued and respected member of the Order of the Phoenix. Even Lord Voldemort acknowledged Moody as one of the most powerful members of the Order following Dumbledore's death.\n\nMoody was Nymphadora Tonks's mentor during her time training as an Auror and later during their time together in the Order of the Phoenix. Despite Moody's surly attitude and behaviour, Tonks was always at ease with him. She was constantly making jokes about his opinions and lectures. The night the Advance Guard escorted Harry Potter to 12 Grimmauld Place, she commented on the lecture he gave Harry on elementary wand-safety. For his part, Moody was openly fond of Tonks. Harry Potter once noted that she had been his favourite during their time together at the Ministry.\n\nMad-Eye crawled his way to Tonks's side after she was injured duelling Bellatrix Lestrange in the Department of Mysteries despite having been injured himself by Antonin Dolohov. Tonks was devastated by Moody's death in 1997 and was seen crying.\n\nAlastor Moody was one of Albus Dumbledore's closest friends. They fought alongside each other in many battles, but Moody teased Dumbledore for hating Dementors. In 1994, Moody accepted Dumbledore's offer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts for a year, but was captured and imprisoned by Bartemius Crouch Junior, who impersonated him during the 1994–1995 school year, in order to send Harry Potter to Lord Voldemort. Dumbledore was able to deduce the impersonation once Crouch lost his composure from over-excitement. Dumbledore and Moody fought together in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Moody was the next member of the Order to die after Dumbledore.\n\nHarry originally met Moody a year after he was impersonated by Bartemius Crouch Junior when Moody came to 4 Privet Drive with other Order of the Phoenix members known as the Advance Guard. Upon first meeting the real Moody (which made Harry feel strange due to having spent so much time with an impostor), Harry thought that Moody was a little mad and overprotective, as he suspected everybody and didn't even let Harry carry his wand in his back pocket, saying that better wizards than him had lost buttocks from doing so.\n\nWhen Moody was murdered by Lord Voldemort during the Battle of the Seven Potters, Harry was devastated by his death, as were the other Order of the Phoenix members. Later, when Harry, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger infiltrated the Ministry of Magic in order to steal Salazar Slytherin's Locket from Dolores Umbridge, Harry found Moody's magical eye in Umbridge's office door and stole it back, later burying it under a tree and marking the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. While it wasn't much, Harry felt that Mad-Eye Moody was given a proper burial and would have appreciated this act of kindness. Harry avenged Moody when he killed Voldemort at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nWhile Harry's first impression of the real Moody was that he was overly paranoid with the extra security, he would later adopt this mentality during the rising stakes of the Second Wizarding War, questioning those around him to ensure they were not impostors.\n\nAlastor Moody was always on good terms with the Weasley family. He was friendly with Arthur Weasley, whom he had met through the Ministry of Magic. Arthur had a high opinion of Moody and thought that, while he was a little mad, he was a great wizard and the most famous Auror of his time. Arthur and Moody fought together in the Battle of the Seven Potters. When Moody was killed by Lord Voldemort, Arthur was very sad.\n\nMoody also seemed to be friendly with Molly Weasley. Although they didn't have a close relationship, Molly knew about him and knew Moody was a great Auror. It could well be that, as a member of the original Order of the Phoenix, he had at least known her brothers, Fabian and Gideon Prewett, reasonably well, whether or not they were truly friends. Fred and George and Ron also thought Moody was a great wizard and thought he taught them great magic. However, in fact, it wasn't Moody, but Bartemius Crouch Junior, who was disguised as Moody. It is also possible that it was the kind of magic that the real Moody would teach.\n\nHe was also friendly with Bill, Charlie, and Ginny. After he was killed, the Weasley family was devastated. Bill, along with Remus Lupin, went to search for Moody's dead body.\n\nMoody was a member of the Order of the Phoenix in both wizarding wars. He was friendly with his most fellow members of the Order, despite his overprotective behaviour and his madness. Aside from Nymphadora Tonks, Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter, and the Weasley family, Moody was also a friend of Remus Lupin. Lupin and Moody met each other during the First Wizarding War, but they also fought together in several battles of the Second Wizarding War. When Moody was killed, Remus was devastated and attempted to search for his dead body.\n\nMoody was also a friend of Kingsley Shacklebolt. They fought together at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Battle of the Seven Potters. Kingsley was also devastated by Moody's death and became the leader of the Order after the battle.\n\nSirius Black also spoke highly of Moody, respecting him for his abilities and for not killing Death Eaters unless necessary. The two fought together in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, where Sirius was killed. Moody was likely saddened by his death.\n\nHe was also friendly with Hermione Granger. Hermione and Moody fought at several battles together, but, when Moody was killed, Hermione was devastated.\n\nHe might have also been a friend of Dedalus Diggle, Emmeline Vance, Hestia Jones, Sturgis Podmore, Elphias Doge, Mundungus Fletcher, Rubeus Hagrid, Arabella Figg, and Fleur Delacour. Vance was killed by Death Eaters in 1996, while Podmore was imprisoned in Azkaban for attempting to open the door of the Department of Mysteries. Moody didn't know it and was angry with Podmore, because he had taken his Invisibility Cloak.\n\nMundungus was paired along with Moody during the Battle of the Seven Potters.[12] When Voldemort attacked them, Mundungus was frightened and disappeared, abandoning Moody, who was killed by Voldemort.[2]\n\nEven though Severus Snape was a member of the Order of the Phoenix after defecting from his role as a Death Eater and Dumbledore trusted him completely, Moody was sceptical over Snape's true loyalties to Dumbledore and the Order. Moody was visibly displeased when Dumbledore defended Snape during Igor Karkaroff's trial, but, due to his friendship and loyalty with Dumbledore, never questioned Dumbledore directly about his trust for Snape. Due to Moody's distrust of Snape, Bartemius Crouch Junior used that knowledge while impersonating Moody to intimidate Snape and told Snape that, while Dumbledore trusted him, there were \"spots that don't come off\", presumably referring to Snape's Dark Mark and his former position as a Death Eater. After Snape killed Dumbledore, Moody's distrust and hatred for Snape increased, unaware that Dumbledore had secretly planned for Snape to kill him and that Snape was still loyal to the Order, and he was responsible for setting up protective enchantments against Snape in 12 Grimmauld Place, which lasted even after his death.\n\nSome of the members of the order were killed during the First Wizarding War. These included Marlene McKinnon, who was killed along with her family, Caradoc Dearborn, who was murdered by Death Eaters and his body was never found, Benjy Fenwick, who was killed and mutilated, Edgar Bones, who was killed along with his family, Dorcas Meadowes, who was murdered by Voldemort himself, Gideon and Fabian Prewett, who were killed by five Death Eaters, and James and Lily Potter, who were killed by Voldemort. However, Alice and Frank Longbottom were tortured into insanity by four Death Eaters: Bellatrix Lestrange, Bartemius Crouch Junior, and Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange. Moody was evidently saddened by their fates and noted that death would have been better and much easier to handle than the lack of sanity with which they would have to live until they died.[28]\n\nMost members of the Order of the Phoenix were devastated after Moody was killed,[2] and many of them were killed, too, by the end of the Second Wizarding War.\n\nAlthough originally some members of the Order thought Moody was being overly paranoid with his extra security and simply humoured him passively, during the rising stakes of the Second Wizarding War,[6] especially after Alastor was killed, the other members took after his methods, mainly asking questions that only other members would be aware of. Lupin even acted violently and cautiously when asking Harry such a security question.[2]\n\nDuring his years as an Auror, Moody captured and defeated many Death Eaters, such as Evan Rosier. According to Sirius Black, Moody was very cruel with the Death Eaters he fought against, but he never killed if he could avoid it.\n\nMoody captured Igor Karkaroff after Voldemort's downfall. He also participated in Karkaroff's trial and told Dumbledore that they should take information from Karkaroff and then send him back to the Dementors.[13] However, Dumbledore refused. Moody and Karkaroff met again in 1994, during the Triwizard Tournament. In fact, he wasn't the real Alastor Moody, but Bartemius Crouch Junior, a Death Eater. After Harry Potter was chosen for the Tournament, Karkaroff got very angry, because Hogwarts had two champions. When Barty (disguised as Moody) told him how the Goblet of Fire might have been fooled, Karkaroff told him that he thought like a Dark wizard. Barty answered that it was his job to capture Dark wizards and perhaps he remembered, meaning that Moody and Karkaroff knew each other well.[26] It is unknown how the real Moody reacted when he learned that Karkaroff was killed by Death Eaters.\n\nMoody also held a grudge against Barty Crouch Jnr for abducting, imprisoning, and impersonating him, and was furious that Crouch damaged his magical eye by wearing it, causing it to get stuck from time to time.[6] It is possible, though never confirmed, that Moody disapproved of Crouch's teaching style and methods, though, in the opinions of the students (and presumably the faculty), they were virtually indistinguishable.\n\nPeter Pettigrew was another Death Eater who attacked and subdued Moody.[14] Both Peter and Moody fought against the Death Eaters together during the First Wizarding War, though it's unknown what kind of relationship they had. It's also not known how Moody reacted upon learning that Peter was alive and actually a Death Eater.\n\nAccording to Bill Weasley, Alastor earned himself many enemies, mainly the families of the criminals he arrested. Voldemort saw Moody as the most potent threat among the Order of the Phoenix, and, during the Battle of the Seven Potters, personally killed him.",
