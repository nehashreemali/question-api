  "content": "Theodore Nott was born to an elderly wizard, Mr Nott and his wife. After the death of his mother, Theodore was raised by his father, who was a Death Eater.[2]\n\nTheodore started at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on 1 September 1991,[5] and was sorted into Slytherin house.[6][7]\n\nDuring a Care of Magical Creatures lesson in his fifth year, he was one of only three students present who could see Thestrals. This suggested that he may have witnessed his mother's death firsthand.[8][9] He found the creatures rather distasteful and unpleasant as he watched one eating.[8]\n\nHermione Granger pointed out Theodore's name to Harry Potter for the first time in 1996. She did this when Theodore was gathered in the school library with fellow Slytherins: Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle, and Draco Malfoy. All four boys had fathers who had recently been outed by Harry as Death Eaters in an article published in The Quibbler. Theodore was the only member of the group whose reaction to seeing Harry was not specifically noted as being either negative or threatening, as it was not noticeable at all.[6]\n\nAt the end of the year, Theodore's father was captured in the Department of Mysteries as one of the Death Eaters who participated in the raid on the Department and exposed as an escaped Death Eater. With his father incarcerated and his mother dead, it is unspecified who cared for Theodore Nott during the school holidays.\n\nWhile on the Hogwarts Express in 1996, Horace Slughorn waylaid Blaise Zabini and inquired after Theodore's father. Blaise replied that Mr Nott was a Death Eater imprisoned in Azkaban for breaking into the Department of Mysteries the previous June. Slughorn, not wanting any association with Death Eaters, was not pleased and thus invited Blaise, not Theodore, to join the Slug Club.[10]\n\nTheodore was one of four Slytherin students who progressed to the N.E.W.T.-level in Potions. During his first lesson with Professor Slughorn, he sat next to Draco, and they both sniggered when Hermione revealed that she was a Muggle-born. They also were sceptical about the effects of Amortentia.[7]\n\nTheodore attended his seventh year at Hogwarts. Due to being a pure-blood Slytherin, as well as the son of a Death Eater, he was likely treated better than most. Shortly before the Battle of Hogwarts, students were being evacuated from the school including the Slytherins. It is unknown if he was one of the few students to join Lord Voldemort, or if he simply joined those who evacuated.\n\nIn 2020, Nott duelled Harry Potter, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and was defeated and then arrested by him for the illegal possession of an unregistered and advanced Time-Turner.[11]\n\nNott had created at least two Time-Turners for Lucius Malfoy. The prototype, which was restricted by a boundary of five minutes, was seized by Potter and used by his son to travel to the past. The improved Time-Turner, which gleamed gold and allowed the traveller to stay in the past for an unlimited time, was kept by Lucius who never used it. Draco Malfoy then used it to save his son in the past.[11]\n\nTheodore was \"weedy\" and \"stringy\", indicating that he was tall, thin, and perhaps weakly built.[8][6] He was also considered to be \"rabbity\" in appearance by some.[9]\n\nTheodore was a solitary boy who never felt compelled to join \"gangs\", such as the one headed by Draco Malfoy.[2] He was seen as a loner who preferred to do things by himself, although he did join in when Malfoy laughed at Hermione Granger's status as a Muggle-born,[7] which suggests he was a pure-blood supremacist like Malfoy and their fathers.\n\nTheodore was particularly clever and inventive, best demonstrated by his cunning and secretive creation of two illegal Time-Turners, a spectacular feat not many others, including many British Ministry of Magic officials, were capable of doing.[11]\n\nTheodore is an English name that comes from the Greek name Theodοros, which is derived from the words theos, meaning \"God\", and dōron, meaning \"gift\". Thus, it is often considered to mean \"gift of God\". It was the name of many early Christian saints. The Welsh version of the name, Tewdwr, was anglicised to Tudor, the name of a royal dynasty of England that ended with Elizabeth I. It could imply that Theodore was \"God's gift\" to his parents, if the version of his mother being an older woman are true and she was already out of age to get pregnant.\n\nIn Norse mythology, Nótt is the personification of night. Also, Josiah C. Nott was a nineteenth century American physician who advocated and popularised polygenist theories about the inherent superiority of Caucasians.",
