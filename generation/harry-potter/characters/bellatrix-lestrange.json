  "content": "Bellatrix \"Bella\" Lestrange (née Black) (1951 – 2 May 1998) was a British pure-blood Dark witch and a member of the noble House of Black. She was the eldest daughter of Cygnus and Druella Black, the elder sister of Andromeda Tonks and Narcissa Malfoy, and the older cousin of Sirius and Regulus Black. Bellatrix started her education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the early sixties (either 1962 or 1963), and was Sorted into Slytherin.\n\nAfter graduating from Hogwarts, Bellatrix became a Death Eater. She was fanatically loyal to Lord Voldemort and was among the most dangerous and sadistic of his followers. All the Black sisters married pure-blood wizards, except for Andromeda who married Muggle-born Ted Tonks and was disowned by the family.\n\nAfter Voldemort's fall from power, Bellatrix, her husband Rodolphus Lestrange, her brother-in-law Rabastan Lestrange, and Barty Crouch Jnr captured and brutally tortured the Aurors Frank and Alice Longbottom, seeking information about Voldemort's whereabouts which eventually drove the two Aurors insane. The four Death Eaters were caught and sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban. Voldemort eventually returned to full strength in 1995 and Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan escaped from Azkaban in the 1996 mass breakout, along with seven other Death Eaters.\n\nBellatrix participated in several battles of the Second Wizarding War, making it a particular goal to murder any relatives who were members of the Order of the Phoenix. She successfully murdered two, her cousin Sirius Black and niece Nymphadora Tonks. She also murdered the Malfoy family's former house-elf, Dobby, who had become a firm ally of Harry Potter. During the final battle, Bellatrix was the last Death Eater standing. She was eventually killed in a duel by Molly Weasley after her attempted murder of Ginny Weasley.\n\nBefore her death, Bellatrix secretly gave birth to an illegitimate daughter named Delphini, whom she conceived with her beloved master, Lord Voldemort. Delphini was conceived sometime after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996 and before the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor in 1998.[18]\n\nBellatrix was born in 1951 to Cygnus Black (III) and Druella Rosier, who gave her a rich lifestyle and raised her to be proud of her pure-blood heritage. She was the elder sister of Andromeda and Narcissa Black.[1]\n\nBellatrix attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Slytherin House, a pattern followed by her sisters. Whilst at Hogwarts the three sisters were very close, and they shared their most prized possessions in a keepsake box which had been given to them by their parents just before they went to Hogwarts. Bellatrix would eventually curse this box with powerful Dark Magic to prevent intruders from accessing the contents, and before she left school she would destroy her keepsakes within the box, reducing them to ashes and hiding the box in the Duelling Club room.[9]\n\nAlong with the rest of her family who held pureblood supremacy beliefs, Bellatrix cut off contact with Andromeda when she married Muggle-born wizard Ted Tonks, causing her to be disowned from the House of Black. Neither she nor Narcissa had \"set eyes on Andromeda since she married the Mudblood Tonks\".[3] She also held her cousin Sirius Black in contempt for being a \"blood traitor\", due to his different opinions on Muggles and Muggle-borns.\n\nBellatrix eventually married Rodolphus Lestrange, a fellow wealthy pure-blood and Slytherin, marrying out of obligation of fulfilling her family's pro pure-blood mentality and tradition. Unlike her sisters, she never displayed any love nor affection for her husband whatsoever, never even mentioning him in conversations nor bearing him any children.\n\nWhen the First Wizarding War broke out, Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus along with her brother-in law Rabastan became Death Eaters and fought for Voldemort. At some point, she received training in the Dark Arts from Voldemort himself. The pair remained loyal to the Dark Lord throughout the war, even after he was \"defeated\" by the infant Harry Potter.\n\nAfter the Dark Lord's fall on 31 October, 1981, Bellatrix and a group of Voldemort's followers, including Rodolphus, her brother-in-law Rabastan, and Barty Crouch Jnr, managed to avoid capture or execution by Aurors. Seeking to find and revive their master, the group kidnapped Aurors and Order of the Phoenix members Alice and Frank Longbottom, just new parents to Neville Longbottom. She and her partners used the Cruciatus Curse to torture the couple for information on Voldemort's whereabouts, until the two captives were driven into insanity.\n\nThis incident happened when Neville was only a baby. Frank and Alice were placed in the Janus Thickey Ward for irrevocable spell damage at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries and, due to them undergoing extreme torture, were rendered unaware that they had a son together.[19][4]\n\nThis crime caused a wave of fury upon the wizard community of such ferocity that the Ministry of Magic were critically pressured to find the culprits. When the four were captured, they were tried before the Council of Magical Law and sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban. Unlike many other Death Eaters, Bellatrix didn't lie about her loyalty — she proudly claimed that she was loyal to Voldemort and that she would wait for his return.\n\nMarked as Prisoner 93, Bellatrix was sentenced to life in Azkaban with no possible chance of release. For her actions, she later described herself as the Dark Lord's most loyal follower and even Lord Voldemort, whom she admired the most, gained a considerable amount of respect for her. As it did with so many, her captivity in Azkaban took a toll on her mentality and hollowed out her appearance until only the faintest traces of her familial beauty remained.[4]\n\nHarry Potter later witnessed Bellatrix's trial in 1995 in a memory of Professor Dumbledore's.\n\nWhen Voldemort returned to power in June 1995, he said that Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan Lestrange were faithful members of his inner circle and should be rewarded, as they didn't denounce him even after they were captured and tried.[19]\n\nIn January 1996, a mass breakout from Azkaban set ten long-imprisoned Death Eaters loose. Bellatrix was one of the ten who escaped in the mass breakout and rejoined Voldemort.[4] The Daily Prophet reported that the escaped criminal Sirius Black must be responsible for the incident. These ten were considered to be some of the most dangerous and highly guarded convicts due to their crimes being incredibly brutal. As a result, Bellatrix and her allies became wanted witches and wizards, living in hiding to avoid being captured by the Ministry.[4]\n\nLater that same year, Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan were all members of a Death Eater task force led by Lucius Malfoy. They participated in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, a plot to steal a prophecy regarding Harry Potter and the Dark Lord. She was enraged when Harry spoke Voldemort's real name and mentioned his status as a half-blood. This enraged her so much that she actually tried to stun him before Lucius deflected her spell with a Shield Charm, not wanting to inadvertently harm the prophecy they were sent to retrieve.[4]\n\nShe was very condescending when dealing with the six D.A. members. Bellatrix tried unsuccessfully to retrieve the prophecy from Harry Potter via a Summoning Charm, as her efforts were stopped by Harry's quick use of his own Shield Charm. She was willing to do whatever it took to get the prophecy from Harry, including gleefully and sadistically threatening to torture fourteen-year-old Ginny Weasley with the Cruciatus Curse while he was forced to watch.[4] Bellatrix also gleefully tortured Neville Longbottom with the Cruciatus Curse, as a means of having Harry hand over the prophocey.\n\nWhen the Order of the Phoenix members arrived, Bellatrix duelled and defeated her niece Nymphadora Tonks. She then began fighting her cousin Sirius Black, who proceeded to taunt her during the course of their duel, but she then struck him with a spell that sent him through the veil in the Death Chamber, killing him. After Sirius's death, Bellatrix defeated Kingsley Shacklebolt and deflected a spell from the recently arrived Albus Dumbledore before deciding to flee.[4]\n\nDriven into a rage at the loss of his godfather, Harry pursued her all the way to the Atrium in an attempt to avenge him. Throughout the pursuit, Bellatrix continuously mocked Harry’s relationship with Sirius. Harry attempted to use the Cruciatus Curse on her but only knocked her over, causing her a few seconds of pain. Dropping her jeering manner, Bellatrix disdainfully lectured him on his failure to execute the curse properly before resolving to torture him herself with it in order to demonstrate the full potency of the curse. After unsuccessfully attempting to attack Harry, she discovered to her horror that the prophecy had been destroyed and proceeded to panic, repeatedly attempting to summon it in vain from Harry who laughed at her efforts but also was unaware that her master had just arrived at the Ministry.[4]\n\nBellatrix pleaded with her master not to be punished and tried to warn him that Dumbledore was nearby but he ignored her and concentrated on attempting to kill Harry. As the Killing Curse blasted from the end of his wand towards Harry, Dumbledore arrived and enchanted the statues of the Fountain of Magical Brethren to protect Harry, act as reinforcements, and to ensure that Bellatrix couldn't intervene as she was then pinned to the ground by the enchanted witch statue.\n\nBefore duelling Voldemort, Dumbledore summoned Cornelius Fudge and several Aurors to the Ministry by using the statues as messengers via the fireplaces along the Atrium wall. After a failed attempt at possessing Harry, Voldemort grabbed Bellatrix before Apparating away but not before being seen by Fudge and the Aurors. With the rest of the Death Eaters immobilised and caught by the Ministry only moments later, Bellatrix was the only Death Eater not to be apprehended due to Voldemort intervening on her behalf, a testament to his acknowledgement of her loyalty to him.[4]\n\nSometime following this, Bellatrix would secretly engage in a sexual relationship with Voldemort. Out of this union would be born their daughter Delphini, who would be given over to be raised by the Rowle family, a family sworn to Voldemort.[20]\n\nIn July of 1996, Bellatrix reluctantly accompanied her younger sister Narcissa Malfoy to the house of Severus Snape at Spinner's End. Once there, Bellatrix interrogated Snape and voiced her distrust of him. Snape's calm, reasonable, and logical answers to her aggressive questioning rendered her dissatisfied but temporarily without retort. Narcissa proceeded to beg Snape to look after her son Draco's welfare while he attended Hogwarts and tried to fulfil Voldemort's orders to kill Dumbledore. Snape shocked Bellatrix by asking her to bind him and Narcissa with an Unbreakable Vow to assist Draco.[5]\n\nFurthermore, Bellatrix assisted her nephew in his task by teaching him Occlumency, a tool he used against Snape in order to conceal the details of his mission.[21] She showed her obsessive loyalty to her master's cause in telling her sister that she should be proud, instead of being worried, that her son was not \"shrinking away from his duty.\"[5]\n\nBy the next year, Bellatrix was living with Narcissa at Malfoy Manor. She was the only resident of the manor who was actually pleased that Voldemort was staying there, telling him that there was \"no higher pleasure\". Despite her unwavering loyalty, her master humiliated her and the Malfoys by mentioning the marriage of Nymphadora Tonks, the daughter of their sister, to the werewolf Remus Lupin. However, Bellatrix insisted that she and Narcissa didn't consider Nymphadora to be their niece, as they had disowned their sister for marrying a Muggle-born.\n\nVoldemort eventually stopped the teasing and advised Bellatrix to continue to \"prune\" her \"family tree\", which she eagerly agreed to do as soon as possible. Despite her proclaimed loyalty towards her master, even Bellatrix hesitated when Voldemort said that he would need to borrow a wand from them in order to circumvent the problem of his own wand refusing to kill Harry, looking much like her colleagues \"as though he had asked to borrow one of their arms\".[3]\n\nWhen the Death Eaters subsequently attacked the Order of the Phoenix while they were moving Harry Potter from 4 Privet Drive, Bellatrix and her husband pursued a disguised Ronald Weasley and Tonks, whom Bellatrix tried very hard to kill. However, Rodolphus was injured in the pursuit and Tonks escaped. Soon afterwards, a copy of Godric Gryffindor's Sword was secured in Bellatrix's family vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank with Bellatrix and the Death Eaters unaware that it was merely a copy. The goblins who ran the bank noticed at once that it was not the genuine article but neglected to mention it to Bellatrix, owing to their disdain at the new wizard control of their bank.[3]\n\nIn March 1998, when Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger were captured by a group of Snatchers and brought to the manor, Bellatrix was at first eager to make sure that Voldemort was informed right away and she and Lucius briefly argued over who would summon him. When she spotted Godric Gryffindor's Sword amongst the trio's captured possessions, however, she at once flew into a panic because the sword (as far as she knew) was hidden in her vault. This led Harry to deduce that there could be something of great importance in her vault which ended up being one of Voldemort's Horcruxes: Helga Hufflepuff's Cup. Bellatrix, coming out of her panicked state, ordered the Snatcher holding the sword to hand it over to her and stunned the man when he refused.\n\nThe other Snatchers turned on her at once, but even though it was four on one, they were no match for her and she quickly stunned three of them and forced Greyback to his knees, demanding to know where he had found the sword. He then informed her that the sword had been found in the Trio's tent. She then took charge of the situation by resorting to torturing Hermione into revealing how the sword was in the Trio's possession and demanded that the rest of the prisoners be taken into the cellar temporarily, while ordering the Stunned Snatchers to be placed in the courtyard to be disposed of by her personally at a later time.[3]\n\nBellatrix proceeded to brutally torture Hermione with the Cruciatus Curse and a knife, asking her again and again about the Sword and if they had taken anything else from their vault. Even in extreme pain, Hermione managed to lie, claiming the real sword was only a copy.[3] However, Bellatrix doubted this claim, which led to Lucius suggesting that Draco retrieve the goblin prisoner Griphook from the cellar to tell her if the sword was a fake or not. Griphook also managed to lie, obeying Harry's request to not tell Bellatrix the truth, keeping the trio's secret safe. After Peter Pettigrew (who had been sent to check on the prisoners after hearing a suspicious noise) was strangled to death in the cellar with his own silver hand given to him by Voldemort after showing mercy to Harry and Ron, Harry and Ron escaped the cellar and proceeded up the stairs to aid Hermione.[3]\n\nBellatrix threatened Hermione with her knife after Harry stunned Greyback and Lucius, and Ron disarmed her. While holding the knife to an unconscious Hermione's throat, Bellatrix demanded that the prisoners drop their wands and then pressed her Dark Mark, calling Voldemort. However, Dobby (who had been sent by Aberforth Dumbledore to rescue Harry and his friends) created a diversion by causing the chandelier to fall from above Bellatrix's head, making her release Hermione and jump out of the way. She lashed out at the house-elf in complete disbelief of his rebellious action to his \"former masters\". Dobby claimed he was a \"free elf\" and Disapparated. As the house-elf Disapparated with Harry, Bellatrix threw a silver knife at them in a desperate attempt to prevent their escape, and the Apparition sucked up the knife with it, wounding Dobby in his chest, who then died. She also lost her wand in the skirmish.[3]\n\nBellatrix and her relatives were severely punished by Voldemort for allowing Harry to escape. After the incident at Malfoy Manor, Hermione used a hair of Bellatrix that had fallen on her while she was torturing her to change herself into Bellatrix using Polyjuice Potion, therefore letting her sneak into Gringotts, as Diagon Alley was infested with Death Eaters.[3]\n\nDuring the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May 1998, Bellatrix finally succeeded in murdering Nymphadora Tonks, her estranged sister's daughter.[16] When Voldemort called a temporary retreat, waiting for Harry Potter to turn himself in, she waited by his side and offered him help when he was dazed after using the Killing Curse on Harry, but this offer was coldly rebuffed. Bellatrix eagerly asked Voldemort if she could check Harry for signs of life, but she was refused again. Voldemort instead sent her younger sister to confirm his death. When Narcissa had lied and told Voldemort that Harry was dead, Bellatrix and the other Death Eaters followed Voldemort to Hogwarts to announce Harry's \"death\", gloating at the despair of the survivors.[3]\n\nWhen the battle resumed, Bellatrix fought Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood all at once, having become the last Death Eater standing aside from Voldemort, who was also fighting three opponents. It was said that despite all three young witches being skilled and working in tandem, together they did not outclass her. She cast a Killing Curse at Ginny, which narrowly missed its mark by an inch. The act was witnessed by both an invisible Harry, who was infuriated enough to actually target Bellatrix over Voldemort, and Molly Weasley.\n\nThe Weasley matriarch, having already lost one child that night and distraught at the prospect of losing her only daughter, promptly threw off her cloak and shouted a vocal challenge to the Death Eater as she charged forward, causing Bellatrix to cackle with laughter at her. However, Bellatrix's reckless, arrogant laughter quickly turned to rage as Molly began to attack, making her realise her opponent was more formidable than she had expected. The two began to duel with the intensity of their powers being stated as causing the ground beneath them to become hot and cracked due to their intent to finish the other off once and for all.[3]\n\nDespite Molly duelling fiercely, Bellatrix continued to laugh and mock her opponent with sadistic glee. She did this even as Molly's powerful curses missed her by inches, eventually providing an opening for Molly to strike her in the chest with a curse which proved fatal.\n\nAs her body toppled to the ground, an outraged Voldemort turned on Molly, which prompted Harry (who had watched the battle unfold beneath his Invisibility Cloak) to reveal himself. The final showdown between him and Voldemort ensued, but Bellatrix didn't live to find out that her mistrust of Snape had been valid or see her master's final defeat moments later.[3]\n\nDuring the Calamity which occurred in 2010s across the wizarding world, a portrait of Bellatrix escaped Malfoy Manor as one of the many Foundables, for unknown and mysterious reasons.[22]\n\nBellatrix had the classic \"great good looks\" and arrogant bearing common for members of the House of Black. She was a tall woman with long, thick, shiny dark hair. Her face had a strong jaw,[5] a thin mouth,[4] and dark,[13] heavily lidded eyes with long eyelashes.[19]\n\nAs a Death Eater, Bellatrix bore the Dark Mark on her left inner forearm. However, (like her cousin Sirius Black) her lengthy imprisonment in Azkaban took a toll on her appearance. Her face became gaunt and skeletal, but she still managed to retain vestiges of her great beauty.[4]\n\nThere was a remarkable resemblance between Bellatrix and her sisters — at first glance, Harry mistook Andromeda Tonks for Bellatrix; only upon closer observation did he notice the differences (Andromeda had lighter brown hair, a kinder face, and wider eyes). Besides this, Narcissa Malfoy was as fair as Bellatrix was dark.[5]\n\nBellatrix was a criminally insane witch with intensely sadistic and brutally violent tendencies.[4][3] She possessed a fierce and dangerous temper, a trait that she shared with her cousin Sirius and her aunt Walburga and which was likely a result of the inbreeding that plagued her birth family. Bellatrix was one of Voldemort's cruellest Death Eaters, always eager to inflict the Cruciatus Curse on enemies. Harry Potter noted that she was as \"mad as her master.\"[4] Likely for these reasons, Bellatrix was slavishly devoted to Lord Voldemort and was willing to do anything for his cause. She believed to have proven her loyalty by her time in Azkaban, an event which had seemingly furthered her mental decline.[19] Despite her loyalty towards her master, she was able to disagree with him on occasion. She did not trust Severus Snape and believed that Voldemort was mistaken in doing so, though she showed shame and fear when expressing this.[5]\n\nOverall, Bellatrix was obsessed with blood purity and took immense pride in the aristocracy of her family since a young age. Like all the rest of Lord Voldemort's followers, she was vehemently against all half-bloods, Muggle-borns, Muggles, and half-breeds. She had a particular disdain for blood traitors, having no qualms towards killing members of her own family, including her cousin Sirius and her niece Nymphadora, whom she sought to kill with great determination. Given her reaction to Harry's words that Voldemort is a half-blood, it is likely that she didn't know that her master wasn't a pure-blood or at least was in denial.\n\nBellatrix was intelligent and a natural leader, taking charge in tricky situations. These traits were shown during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor. The latter event was a mark of her decisiveness and ruthlessness, as she took no unnecessary prisoners (preferring to kill them instead) as she planned to do with a group of Snatchers who attempted to defy her.[3] However, Bellatrix could be easily distracted and reckless, especially in battle with opponents that appeared to be (or were) weaker than herself.\n\nBellatrix was also egotistical and arrogant, described by Harry as \"treat[ing] everyone like scum\" in a rather taunting way. She had immense confidence in her skills and never hesitated to jump into battle against any auror or Order of the Phoenix member. Furthermore, she was immensely proud of her status as the most loyal and devoted follower of Lord Voldemort. However, Bellatrix chose to flee when Dumbledore arrived, suggesting that, like her master, she held a degree of fear and caution for the powerful wizard.\n\nDespite her cruel personality, Bellatrix was not incapable of caring for a few people. She was obsessively in love with her master, Lord Voldemort. She had a close relationship with her younger sister Narcissa Malfoy, grudgingly going with her to Snape's house to ask his help, and didn't tell her master of her sister's deception. She also showed affection for her nephew and student Draco Malfoy but didn't seem to be too concerned about his safety, as she would \"be glad to give [her own sons] up to the service of the Dark Lord\".\n\nBellatrix took the pure-blood values of her family very seriously, as indicated by her marriage into a known pure-blood wizarding family and her zealous belief in Death Eater ideology. She had no feelings of affection for those in her family deemed blood traitors by disgracing and dishonouring her family by not fanatically honouring the prejudiced values she did, and readily attacked and killed them on many occasions.\n\nBellatrix seemed to have had a fairly close and affectionate relationship with her younger sister Narcissa, whom she called \"Cissy.\" Despite distrusting Severus Snape and attempting to dissuade her sister from approaching him, Bellatrix accompanied Narcissa to Spinner's End to request Snape's help in seeing Draco Malfoy through the task assigned to him by Lord Voldemort in 1996. After Snape agreed to make the Unbreakable Vow, Bellatrix acted as the bonding agent, ensuring that Snape would fulfil his promises to Narcissa.[5]\n\nNarcissa and Bellatrix occasionally clashed over the former's protectiveness towards her son; she argued that Narcissa should be proud that her son was a Death Eater, while Narcissa consistently demonstrated that the safety of her son and husband were her first priorities.[5] At some point, Bellatrix trained Draco in Occlumency to aid him in his mission.[21]\n\nOn the other hand, Bellatrix hated her \"blood traitor\" relatives. After her sister Andromeda married a muggle-born and was disowned, she never saw her again.[3] Bellatrix shared a mutual loathing with her \"dear cousin\" Sirius Black, who had a similar temper. The two taunted each other as they duelled during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. After killing Sirius, Bellatrix sadistically jeered at Harry about the death of his godfather on multiple occasions.[4]\n\nIt is possible that Bellatrix was on good terms with her other cousin, Regulus, who was also a Death Eater during the First Wizarding War. Regulus initially espoused the pure-blood supremacist line associated with his family, and like Bellatrix, was sorted into the Slytherin house during his time at Hogwarts. It is unlikely that he revealed his change of heart to Bellatrix, or anyone else, prior to his death in 1979.\n\nBellatrix eagerly attacked her niece, Nymphadora Tonks, on at least three occasions. This was likely for a combination of reasons, including Tonks' being a half-blood, an Auror, and member of the Order of the Phoenix, the fact that she had married the werewolf Remus Lupin, and Voldemort's comments to her about \"pruning her family tree\". Bellatrix eventually murdered Tonks during the Battle of Hogwarts on the 2nd of May 1998.\n\nHer brother-in-law Lucius was antagonistic with Bellatrix due to usurping his place within the Death Eater ranks despite the fact she had been imprisoned in Azkaban for fourteen years, unlike Lucius. Their differences in loyalty in the Dark Lord fuelled their antagonism for each other even more.[5] When Bellatrix wanted to murder Harry Potter during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Lucius briefly restrained her.[4] After the battle, she told Narcissa that it was Lucius' fault that she couldn't give Voldemort the Prophecy.[5]\n\nHowever, the two fought together during the skirmish at Malfoy Manor. Seeing Lucius's extreme failure and the confiscation of his wand, Bellatrix treated him with disdain and contempt, showing him little to no respect during their argument of summoning Voldemort for capturing Harry.[3]\n\nBellatrix's relationship with Draco seemed to have some affection; though she seemed to disapprove of his inability to kill and his dislike for torture.[3] She taught him Occlumency, non-verbal spells, and several branches of the Dark Arts, making her already talented nephew a powerful wizard.[21] His blood relationship with her was probably the only reason he was remained alive; due to his father's failure and Snape taking over his 1996-1997 task.\n\nBellatrix attended Hogwarts with Rodolphus Lestrange and were part of a gang of other Slytherin students which also included Lucius Malfoy, Evan Rosier, and Severus Snape, all of whom became Death Eaters.[4] She later married him in order to make a \"respectable pure-blood marriage\",[4] as it was expected of her.[16] There is no indication that their relationship went beyond this. She never expressed any love or concern for him. No children appear beneath their names on the Black family tapestry. It could be surmised that she made no attempts to produce children with her official husband, as she adored her master only and concentrated on pleasing only him.\n\nHowever, Bellatrix and Rodolphus did seem to work effectively together as Death Eaters, suggesting they worked well together on a platonic and professional level. Both were some of the most loyal and valued Death Eaters, so it is likely that they would've felt a connection from their mutual devotion to their master. Rodolphus tortured Alice and Frank Longbottom alongside his wife, brother, and Barty Crouch Jnr in 1981.[19] He fought with Bellatrix during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries[4] and the Battle of the Seven Potters. Nymphadora Tonks mentioned cursing him and being pursued by Bellatrix.[3]\n\nBellatrix had an illegitimate daughter with Lord Voldemort, named Delphini, who was born in secret at Malfoy Manor in the late 1990s.[24] Bellatrix didn't live long enough to watch her daughter grow up; this left the infant Delphi an orphan as her father had been. Euphemia Rowle took Delphi in and raised her, allegedly only because she was offered a substantial amount of gold.[25]\n\nBellatrix was obsessively in love with Lord Voldemort, which extended to her being (sexually) attracted to him.[16][26][27] More than just being a fanatic, she shared his ideas of blood purity and fascination with the Dark Arts. Unlike many of the other Death Eaters, Bellatrix never attempted to deny her loyalties when her master fell in 1981. Instead, she proudly claimed that she was his most loyal and trusted servant, and stated that he would rise again. She seemed to view Azkaban prison as a mere place to wait for his return.[19]\n\nBellatrix was described as being slavishly devoted to her master, regarding him with \"worshipful fascination\" and speaking to him in a romantic way.[3] On at least one occasion, during the 1997 meeting of Death Eaters at Malfoy Manor, her cheeks flushed and her eyes welled up with tears when she thought he was praising her. Satisfying him was of the utmost importance to her. She was perfectly willing to kill her niece, Nymphadora Tonks, as a way of \"pruning\" her \"family tree\", though she would most likely have done it without his orders, anyway.\n\nBellatrix was outraged by anyone showing her master even the slightest disrespect. When Harry called him by his name in 1996, she became enraged, feeling that he was unworthy of speaking the name. She was also furious when Harry spoke of Voldemort's half-blood status and Muggle father. Despite agreeing with her master's ideology of blood purity, she apparently didn't care that he himself was a half-blood, if she believed this at all. Voldemort might have falsely told his subordinates that he was a pure-blood, something which Harry Potter suspected. If so, she believed her master's lie over the truth from the enemy.\n\nVoldemort respected her talents and skills and considered her of greater importance than most of his other servants. At the conclusion of the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, he grabbed her and Apparated away with her. She was the sole Death Eater whom he bothered to help, though this may have been done out of convenience, as she was much closer in proximity than the other captured Death Eaters. However, Voldemort didn't reciprocate her romantic feelings, as he didn't know love. Due to his egotistical and self-centred nature, it is possible that he was at least pleased with her desire for him. Their sexual relationship and the honour of bearing his child could have also been a reward to Bellatrix for her loyalty to him, as he believed that he had found a way to cheat death and didn't need to leave an heir behind. When she was killed by Molly Weasley during the final battle, Voldemort's fury was said to \"explode like a bomb\". Her death was the only one that he attempted to avenge before Harry Potter intervened. It is unlikely, though, that he truly cared about her as a person, rather than being angry about losing someone who was very useful to him.\n\nBellatrix was acquainted with Severus Snape, a fellow Death Eater prior to the end of the First Wizarding War, changing sides shortly before Voldemort's 1981 downfall, and becoming a double agent for Albus Dumbledore. Their relationship prior to Snape's defection is unknown,\n\nBellatrix was highly suspicious of him due to Severus's alliance with Dumbledore and his spotty record of fervent loyalty to the Dark Lord.[5] Although she was genuine in her mistrust of Snape, she was possibly also envious of the position of trust and respect Snape enjoyed under Voldemort. It is also possible that Snape's half-blood status was a point of derision on Bellatrix's part.\n\nIn 1996, Bellatrix followed Narcissa to Snape's house, trying to dissuade her from seeking his help in guiding and guarding Draco in the task of killing Albus Dumbledore. She was taken aback by Snape's conformance in making the Unbreakable Vow, for which she acted as a bond-maker.[5] Both she and Snape fought and died at the Battle of Hogwarts. However, Bellatrix's death didn't allow her to discover that her initial mistrust of Snape had been valid after all.[3]\n\nBellatrix wasn't likely to have viewed many of the other Death Eaters as her equals, as she believed both her skill, devotion, and family status exceed that of others. While it is unclear exactly how much genuine respect the other Death Eaters had for Bellatrix, it was clear they were familiar with her view of herself, as Travers became less suspicious of Hermione Granger, disguised as Bellatrix via Polyjuice Potion in 1998, only after Hermione took on a much haughtier personality. Undoubtedly, she considered Voldemort's most loyal Death Eaters to be those who, like her, were imprisoned in Azkaban at some point: namely, Barty Crouch Jnr, her husband and his brother. However, given her fanatical possessive nature towards the Dark Lord, it's highly likely that Bellatrix felt jealousy towards Barty Crouch Jnr, as he was considered just as close (if not more so) to the Dark Lord. Crouch knew aspects of the Voldemort's life Bellatrix was unaware of, and was even willing to say his name without fear, something even she wouldn't dare to do.\n\nWhile in school Bellatrix was part of a gang that included her husband, Severus Snape, Evan Rosier, Wilkes, Avery, and Mulciber. It's unknown how well she got along with these individuals, both as students and Death Eaters. Rosier was likely related to her on her mother's side. She and Mulciber both were sent to Azkaban at the end of the First Wizarding War and both fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.\n\nPeter Pettigrew seemed pleased to see her as well as Narcissa when they visit him and Snape, though Bellatrix didn't acknowledge him. It's possible that she appreciates Peter for his role in bringing back their master or else dislikes him for not attempting to help him sooner.\n\nBellatrix had a disdainful attitude towards the Snatchers. Despite their role in capturing Harry, she treated them like lowly servants and was quick to attack them the moment one of them disobeyed her. Fenrir Greyback showed fear and resentment towards her, though Bellatrix did acknowledge his role in capturing Harry and agreed that he did deserve to be rewarded.\n\nKreacher was the last house-elf of the House of Black, who shared his family's pure-blood supremacist values. Like Walburga Black, he was disappointed with Sirius for not sharing those same values, thus favouring the latter's cousins, Bellatrix and Narcissa. He kept pictures of Bellatrix and some other Black family members in his sleeping area at 12 Grimmauld Place. Bellatrix's picture was his favourite, as he had attempted to repair it with Spellotape and placed it in front of the others.\n\nIn December of 1995, when Sirius yelled at Kreacher to \"get out\" of a room, Kreacher interpreted the words as a command to leave his master's service and exit the house altogether. Because Bellatrix was currently in Azkaban and Andromeda had been disowned, Narcissa was the next family member whom he could serve. He went to her home and gave her information about Harry's godson relationship with Sirius.\n\nAfter Bellatrix escaped from Azkaban, he helped her by injuring Buckbeak, Sirius's hippogriff. He even lied to Harry about Sirius being gone from the house one day, when he had actually only gone upstairs to tend to Buckbeak's injury. Harry went to the Ministry of Magic to \"save\" Sirius, who in turn went there to save Harry. After she killed Sirius in a duel,[4] Kreacher hoped to officially move into her possession, but Sirius's will transferred ownership to Harry.[28] Kreacher eventually gave his loyalty to Harry in 1997, fighting against Voldemort and his Death Eaters, Bellatrix included, during the Battle of Hogwarts.[3]\n\nBellatrix Lestrange saw Harry Potter as her master's most hated enemy and despised him for the inexplicable threat he posed to the Dark Lord, wanting him dead very badly. She thought of him as someone lesser than herself, due to his status as a half-blood and for having less experience than her. Harry had hated Bellatrix ever since he first saw her in the Pensieve due to learning that she was responsible for the attack on Alice and Frank Longbottom. He seemed to have an odd fascination with her which may have been caused by his loathing of her. Harry was immediately drawn to her picture when the news of the ten escaped Death Eaters appeared in the Daily Prophet and experienced \"a little jolt in his stomach\" after seeing her picture in Kreacher's bedroom.\n\nAfter she murdered his godfather in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Harry aggressively pursued Bellatrix after she fled from Dumbledore and attempted to cast the Cruciatus Curse on her. He also taunted her for her failed efforts in achieving the prophecy for Voldemort. At the onset of the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor, the mere sound of her voice when she appeared in the fray was enough to make his fear reach a new high. Bellatrix killed his close friends, Dobby the house-elf and Nymphadora Tonks. When she attempted to murder Ginny Weasley (the girl he loved) during the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry was diverted from his goal of destroying Voldemort in the hopes of attacking her. He was stopped only by the sudden intervention of Molly Weasley.\n\nAfter the fall of the Dark Lord in 1981, Bellatrix along with three her husband Rodolphus, the latter's brother, Rabastan and Bartemius Crouch Junior set out to attack members of the Order of the Phoenix, hoping to interrogate them for information on Voldemort's whereabouts. She personally attacked Alice and Frank Longbottom, torturing them by means of the Cruciatus Curse in her attempt at forcing them to yield the information she wanted. The event rendered the Aurors clinically and permanently insane, therefore condemning them to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries for the remainder of their lives.\n\nPrior to the Longbottoms' capture and torture, Alice had given birth to a baby boy, Neville Longbottom. He was left with parents incapable of even recognising him let alone caring for him, and so he was raised by his grandmother. Bellatrix seemed to find the fact that she had caused Neville's family tragedy highly amusing. Upon realising who Neville was, she proceeded to mock his loss, extremely angering him in the process.\n\nEver since he was old enough to understand why his parents needed to be hospitalised, Neville had despised Bellatrix Lestrange, but given his benign nature, he never sought vengeance against her. Instead, he honoured his parents by showing more bravery than anyone could have expected of him, eventually retaliating when Bellatrix taunted him, rebelling against the tyranny of the Carrows during his seventh year at Hogwarts, and subsequently fighting during the 1998 Battle of Hogwarts against Voldemort's forces.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore knew Bellatrix to be a highly dangerous Death Eater since the First Wizarding War, having witnessed her trial and imprisonment after she tortured Aurors to insanity and beyond. Dumbledore seemed to understand her very well; he admitted to Severus Snape that he would prefer to not fall prey to Bellatrix Lestrange in his weakened state (caused by Voldemort's cursed Horcrux ring), as she liked to \"play with her food before she eats it\"; in other words, inflict unbelievable pain before finally delivering the killing blow.[3]\n\nThough Bellatrix was fanatically loyal to Voldemort and believed that he was greater and more powerful than Dumbledore, she would not brave Dumbledore in a duel, as she recognised him as a far more superior wizard than she was a witch. During the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Bellatrix opted to flee rather than engage Dumbledore in battle, being the only Death Eater in the Death Chamber who succeeded in escaping from him.[4]\n\nIt is possible that Dumbledore knew Bellatrix while she was a student, either being her headmaster or teacher. It's unknown what kind of relationship, if any, the two had at the time.\n\nBellatrix tortured Hermione when the trio were caught by Snatchers. She despised her for being Muggle-born and selected her to be tortured in order to get the truth out of her as to why the trio had Godric Gryffindor's sword. She thought the group had stolen it from her vault, but even through this pressure, Hermione lied that it was a fake and Griphook helped get that across. However, the older witch doubted this statement. Along with her friends, Hermione managed to escape, but her friend Dobby died at Bellatrix's hands.[3]\n\nIn the Battle of Hogwarts, Bellatrix duelled Hermione, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood all at once and proved equal in talent to them together, although Hermione duelled using Bellatrix's own wand. All these events greatly implied that Hermione was viewed as hated, persistent, lowly dirt by Bellatrix.[3]\n\nMost of the Order of the Phoenix knew Bellatrix as one of the most dangerous and sadistic of Lord Voldemort's followers, especially considering Bellatrix managed to kill, seriously injure, or duel and successfully defeat several Order members. She bested Kingsley Shacklebolt at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries,[4] was disgusted by Remus Lupin, as a werewolf, marrying into her family through Nymphadora Tonks, and offered to take Ron Weasley — a member of the Weasley family, well known in pure-blood supremacist circles as \"blood traitors\" — next in her painful interrogation in events in the Malfoy manor. She also found Minerva McGonagall's despair at seeing Harry Potter's seemingly dead body amusing.[3]\n\nDuring the Battle of Hogwarts, Bellatrix cruelly taunted Molly Weasley about the death of Molly's son, Fred. When she tried to attack Molly's daughter, Ginny, she instigated a vicious battle between Molly and herself. This battle ended in the death of Bellatrix, who continued laughing derisively at the efforts of her opponent until the moment she realised Molly had defeated her.[3]\n\nLike many members of the House of Black, Bellatrix's name is derived from that of a star. Bellatrix is the third brightest star in the constellation Orion. It is also known as the Amazon Star, which is one of Orion's seven brightest stars. In fact, it's the twenty-seventh brightest star in the night sky. The Amazons were warrior women in Greek mythology, which is presumably an allusion to Bellatrix being among the most dangerously skilled Death Eaters.\n\nHer name has Latin, French and English origins: Bellatrix is the Latin word for a female warrior, and Lestrange is an Anglo-Norman surname meaning \"outsider\" or \"stranger\". Lestrange is also likely a play on l'étrange, which is French meaning \"the strange one\". Her name thus alludes to her own mental instability, although technically Lestrange came from Bellatrix's husband Rodolphus.",
