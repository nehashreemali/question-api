  "content": "Professor Sybill Patricia[12] Trelawney (b. 9 March[1][3] pre-1962)[2] was a half-blood[1] witch and Professor of Divination at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[6] She is the great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Cassandra Trelawney,[13] who was also a Seer.\n\nIt was Trelawney herself who made the prophecy concerning Lord Voldemort and the one with the power to vanquish him (Voldemort took this to mean Harry Potter) during her job interview with Albus Dumbledore.[14] At the end of the 1993–1994 school year, she accurately predicted the escape of Peter Pettigrew and the return of Lord Voldemort.[15]\n\nIn the 1995–1996 school year, Trelawney was greatly distressed by Dolores Umbridge, who dismissed her and attempted to banish her from Hogwarts Castle, though Dumbledore allowed her to remain at the school,[13] with Umbridge being greatly offended when she later had to teach alongside the centaur Firenze.[14] In the 1997–1998 school year, she participated in the Battle of Hogwarts, dropping crystal balls on Death Eaters' heads[11] and tending to the wounded and dead along with Padma Patil.[16]\n\nProfessor Trelawney continued to teach well into the 2010s, continuing her tradition of predicting the deaths of her students.[17] Although Firenze was welcomed back to his herd,[18] the two continued to share the post of Divination Professor.[19]\n\nSybill was born on 9 March in an unknown year, to a Muggle mother and wizard father,[1] into the half-blood Trelawney family. There were three generations between her and Cassandra Trelawney, who was a renowned Seer. No one in the family since Cassandra had possessed the Second Sight until Sybill was born.\n\nPresumably purchasing or inheriting her wand at the age of eleven, Sybill attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which she referred to as her 'home'. Being Sorted into Ravenclaw by 1973 at the latest, she may have been a member of the Slug Club[10] because of her ancestry. In her third year, Sybill would have taken Divination as one of her elective subjects in her third year, and achieved high grades in her O.W.L and N.E.W.T.\n\nShe married early, but it ended in unforeseen rupture due to Sybill's refusal to adopt the surname Higglebottom. They had no children.[1]\n\nAfter graduating, Sybill drifted through the society in the wizarding world, trying to gain employment based on her ancestry but scorning those who did not offer what she felt was the rightful treatment of a true Seer.[1]\n\nEither late in 1979 or early in 1980,[20][21][22] Sybill, who by this point had begun making false predictions, arranged a meeting with Albus Dumbledore in the Hog's Head where she was staying in the hopes of acquiring the position of Professor of Divination at Hogwarts School. Dumbledore, who was not planning on continuing divination at Hogwarts, agreed to give her a chance because of her ancestry.\n\nSybill displayed none of Cassandra's divinatory skills, which disappointed Dumbledore. After he courteously told her she was not fit for the position, Sybill entered a real trance and made the prophecy about Voldemort's defeat. It so happened that the Death Eater Severus Snape was eavesdropping at the door, which placed Trelawney in great danger from Voldemort. Hoping to protect Sybill, Dumbledore hired her; despite this fact, she did not join the faculty until 1981.[23]\n\nAs a Professor, Trelawney taught in the Divination Classroom on the seventh floor of the North Tower.[15] She presumably also ran the Divination Workshop. Sybill made many predictions over her time at Hogwarts. Minerva McGonagall once claimed that she predicted the death of one of her students every year, none of whom had yet died.[6]\n\nKnowing her magical talents were pale in comparison to her colleagues,[1] Professor Trelawney very rarely attended meals in the Great Hall with the rest of the school, preferring to remain in her tower.[6] She appeared to be acquainted with Camelia but frequently clashed with Professor McGonagall, who believed her to be a fraud.[15]\n\nTrelawney attended the Start-of-Term Feast in 1989.[24] During the 1989–1990 school year, she taught her sixth-year N.E.W.T.-level students in Divination about many different topics in the field, such as Tessomancy,[25] Palmistry[26] Cartomancy,[27] crystal-gazing,[28] Numerology,[29] Xylomancy,[30] Myomancy,[31] dream interpretation[32] and Bibliomancy.[33]\n\nIn her first lesson of the year, Trelawney told Ismelda Murk that a friend's irritating goldfish would soon die, and proceeded to ask other students why they were taking her class. Upon inspecting Jacob's sibling's tea leaves, she told them a vision of murky water, changes swirling around them, final endings, and an ultimate price to pay. She warned them to be careful. When asked what it meant, however, Nymphadora Tonks reminded them that Trelawney was not known for giving accurate prophecies.[25]\n\nDuring one lesson, her Inner Eye interrupted her and she told her sixth-year class that she has just received a vision that a Dark wizard had escaped Auror custody and had been spotted nearby. However, Ismelda Murk pointed out that that was the Daily Prophet's headline with Rita Skeeter having broken the story, but Trelawney responded that she had forseen the headline. She had her class divine new insights from the story rather than read the The Quibbler.[34]\n\nLater on, during a sixth-year lesson in which she revised crystal-gazing with them, she informed the students that Dumbledore had reported that two more students had been petrified with the statue curse, and that volunteers were needed in the Hospital Wing.[35]\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year, she revised Ovomancy with her seventh-year students in preparation for their upcoming N.E.W.T.s. She told the students she could clearly foretell the success of some students, but was uncertain about others, wishing the students good luck.[36]\n\nAt some point in the 1991–1992 school year, Professor Trelawney locked her classroom door, with a notice saying \"Do not disturb, crystal gazing\". Harry Potter, who had just joined the school, attempted to open it without realising that it was locked.[37]\n\nDuring the 1993–1994 school year, Professor Trelawney gained the famous Harry Potter as a student, who had only chosen to take Divination because his friend, Ronald Weasley, had.[38] She opened her lesson with normal fortune-teller practises and vague predictions, including that Neville Longbottom would break at least one teacup, something Lavender Brown was dreading would happen on 16 October, and that, around Easter, one of her students would leave the class forever. During a class on tea leaves, Trelawney saw the Grim — a well-known omen of death — in Harry Potter's cup. This visibly disturbed the class, who went rather shaken to Transfiguration with Professor McGonagall.[15]\n\nAfter Neville broke two teacups, Lavender's rabbit Binky was killed, and Hermione Granger, after being greatly insulted by Professor Trelawney, stormed out of a lesson, Lavender and Parvati Patil became great supporters of Trelawney and her predictions.[15][39]\n\nDuring Christmas, Trelawney decided to join the small dinner in the Great Hall. However, once she saw the amount of people at the table she tried to refuse, claiming that if she joined, they would become a party of the unlucky number thirteen and the first to rise would be the first to die. An impatient McGonagall stated that they would risk it. Two hours later, both Harry and Ron bolted up from their seats, causing Trelawney to shrilly ask which one of them got up first. McGonagall dryly joked that unless there was a mad axe-man waiting in the Entrance Hall to slaughter the first person he saw, it made little difference. However, Ron was accompanied by Scabbers at the time, who unbeknownst to all was actually Peter Pettigrew, thus meaning that thirteen dined at the table. As Dumbledore stood to welcome Trelawney, he was the first to rise from a table of thirteen, and also the first to die, meaning that Trelawney predicted the death of Dumbledore years before the event occurred.[15]\n\nWhile conducting the third year exams with the Gryffindors, Professor Trelawney, while invigilating Harry Potter, entered a trance and made a prediction that Voldemort's servant would be freed, returning to him that night. When she returned to normal seconds later, she could not remember anything that had happened.[15]\n\nHarry later told this to Professor Dumbledore, who jokingly said that he should offer her a pay raise for making a total of two real prophecies.[15]\n\nThe following year, the Triwizard Tournament took place at Hogwarts and Harry Potter was one of the champions. Trelawney continued to annoy him with increased predictions of his death. She guessed that Harry had lost his parents because he was born during midwinter, heralding a tragic life. However, Harry told her he was born in July.[40] Unbeknownst to Harry, who was the final Horcrux, Voldemort was born in December. So, Trelawney's prediction of a tragic life was in fact accurate.\n\nOnce, Rita Skeeter, in the form of a beetle, eavesdropped upon Harry during Trelawney's lesson when Harry had a crisis caused by his scar. Trelawney was very excited and pressed Harry to tell her what had happened, saying that she had experience in these matters and that the clairvoyant vibrations of her room could allow him to see further than he had ever seen before. Unfortunately for Trelawney, Harry refused.[41]\n\nAt the end of the year, Trelawney learned about the death of Cedric Diggory and the return of Voldemort. The Second Wizarding War had begun.\n\nEarly on in the 1995–1996 school year, Dolores Umbridge was made Hogwarts High Inquisitor by Ministry edict, and appeared in Trelawney's classroom with a clipboard, making notes. Trelawney saw this as an intrusion, and was most upset and angered by it. Umbridge asked Trelawney to justify her teaching techniques and required a prediction from her. Trelawney at first was indignant, and haughtily claimed that the Inner Eye did not See upon command. Unimpressed, Umbridge made to leave. Panicked, Trelawney attempted to persuade Umbridge that she could suddenly see great danger in her future, but the High Inquisitor remained unmoved -- whether Trelawney had actually seen Umbridge in danger in the forest at the end of the year or whether she just made it up based on the Defence Against the Dark Arts curse is unknown.[13]\n\nDuring free time that year, Professor Trelawney was visited in her tower by Lavender Brown and the Patil twins, who had additional sessions of Divination with her.[39]\n\nUmbridge later put Professor Trelawney on probation, which greatly distressed and insulted her. She became uncharacteristically brisk and started drinking a large amount of cooking sherry, which she hid in the Room of Requirement.[14] Harry Potter noted that Trelawney became more harassed and bedraggled in appearance, like she was falling apart at the seams. Umbridge would stalk Trelawney during every one of her lectures, interrupting her increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions regarding Heptomology and Ornithomancy, insisting that Sybill predict students' answers before they gave it to her, and demanding she demonstrate her skills at the crystal ball, tea leaves and rune stone in turn. Umbridge states that she saw no improvement in Trelawney's performance to the point that she could not predict tomorrow's weather.[13]\n\nAfter Harry Potter stood up to Professor Umbridge by giving an interview to The Quibbler, edited by Xenophilius Lovegood, Trelawney showed her support by breaking her usual pattern of predicting horrible deaths for Harry, instead predicting that he would have a long life, become Minister for Magic, and have twelve children, a prediction that made Umbridge unhappy.[13]\n\nEventually, Trelawney was dismissed by Umbridge, who almost threw her bodily from the castle, gleefully relishing the fact that Trelawney was in paroxysms of grief over her dismissal. Before she could be chased off the premises, Dumbledore came to her aid and insisted that she stay at Hogwarts, as while Umbridge as High Inquisitor had the the authority to terminate her employment, she did not have the authority to banish her from the school grounds. This was partially to protect Trelawney from Voldemort who would target her for making the prediction concerning Harry and himself. Despite not having much respect for Trelawney, McGonagall comforted her as best she could and helped Filius Flitwick and Pomona Sprout get her back inside to her tower.[13]\n\nTrelawney was replaced by the centaur Firenze, appointed by Dumbledore, much to Umbridge's shock and fury; she hated both the fact that Firenze was what she called a \"half-breed\" and that Dumbledore appointed someone without consulting her (in spite of the fact that Educational Decree Number Twenty-Two does not let her deny such an action). Firenze taught in Classroom 11 rather than the North Tower, where Trelawney remained living.[13]\n\nShe was finally reinstated to her teaching position after Umbridge was suspended. This meant that, since Dumbledore could not ask Firenze to return to the herd that tried to kill him, she would have to share classes with Professor Firenze, a fact she was not pleased with.[13]\n\nDuring the 1996–1997 school year, Professor Trelawney attended the Start-of-Term Feast, and sat next to Professor Rubeus Hagrid, who taught Care of Magical Creatures. That year, Trelawney and Firenze divided the students between them by year. Trelawney taught the fifth[42] and sixth years.[14]\n\nShe continued to drink due to her humiliation of working with a \"horse\" while hiding her cooking sherry in the Room of Requirement. At Horace Slughorn's Christmas party, Trelawney was morosely drunk. She spent the night listening to Luna Lovegood's speeches on the \"Rotfang Conspiracy\" and that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire. She seemed rather interested.[14]\n\nIn mid-March, Professor Trelawney demanded, quite unsuccessfully, that Professor Dumbledore fire Firenze. Their meeting was cut short when Harry Potter arrived for one of his private lessons with the Headmaster.[14]\n\nLater, Trelawney attempted to enter the Room of Requirement, but was thrown out by Draco Malfoy, who apparently used Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder to conceal his identity. Harry Potter found her sprawled on the floor and helped her up. He encouraged her to accompany him to Dumbledore's office to tell the Headmaster what had happened to her. On the way, she started talking about the day she was hired. When Trelawney mentioned that the eavesdropper had been Severus Snape, Harry left her standing in the corridor and ran off to confront Dumbledore with this information.[14]\n\nShe stated that she missed having Harry in her classes, and though he was never much of a Seer, he was a \"wonderful Object\".[43]\n\nDuring the 1997–1998 school year, Voldemort had taken over Hogwarts and made Snape headmaster. Alecto Carrow replaced the murdered Muggle Studies teacher, Charity Burbage, and Amycus Carrow took Snape's position as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, which became simply the Dark Arts. It is possible that she, like all of the other staff members, tried to protect the students from the Death Eaters. Professor Trelawney, being half-blood, was permitted to remain teaching at the school. It is unknown why Voldemort did not attempt to capture her. It is possible that since Voldemort had since turned his attention to finding the Elder Wand, he believed that any prophecy concerning him and Harry would be rendered irrelevant upon its retrieval, of which he was wrong.[11]\n\nLike the rest of the school, Professor Trelawney participated in the Battle of Hogwarts. She fought by dropping crystal balls on enemies' heads, successfully knocking out Fenrir Greyback with one of them, as he attacked Lavender Brown. Unfortunately, she was unsuccessful in saving Lavender, who died from injuries caused by the werewolf. Trelawney continued using her wand to throw crystal balls onto the heads of Death Eaters with a \"tennis-like serve.\" Eventually, the Death Eaters were all defeated, along with Voldemort who was defeated once and for all by Harry Potter.[11]\n\nProfessor Trelawney survived the Second Wizarding War and continued to teach well into the 2010s, continuing her tradition of predicting the deaths of her students.[17] Although Firenze was welcomed back to his herd,[18] the two continued to share the post of Divination Professor.[19]\n\nAround this time, students below the third year started studying Divination in her class as well. Before a second-year class in the 2009–2010 school year, a teapot containing Rubeus Hagrid's Occamy appeared in her classroom and was discovered by some students. When she arrived, she recognised the Occamy and brought it back to Hagrid.[44]\n\nAnother day, she found one of her students in her classroom and asked what brought them there. The student was curious about whether she wanted to replace her old crystal balls, which reminded her that they were the ones used in the Battle of Hogwarts and should've been put away. She recalled knocking the enemies' heads with those balls, which the student took to mean that she was good at aiming her throws.[45]\n\nBy 2020, Trelawney had written a book entitled My Eyes and How to See Past Them.[46] She also predicted that the Chudley Cannons would win their 2020 season by that same year, which was later proven to be inaccurate.[47]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the late 2010s and early 2020s, Professor Trelawney appeared as a Foundable during the Calamity. Volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force were able to free her, allowing Trelawney to return to her original time.[47]\n\nA Calamity Investigator working for the task force was later \"hoodwinked\" into a conversation with Professor Trelawney about Divination. Although the investigator found her difficult to follow, they decided to apply her methodologies to returning Foundables, finding that doing so actually improved their Trace Charm. A member of the task force pursuing a position as a Professor later performed Tessomancy with Trelawney, being reminded that danger was literally everywhere and increasing their focus in combat. The same Professor also attended a Divination session held by Professor Trelawney during which she convinced them to open their mind in battle, enabling them to cast spells more easily under pressure.[47]\n\nIn August 2020, during another surge of the Calamity, fragments were found of a prophecy allegedly made by Professor Trelawney in the 1990s. In it, she predicted the Calamity. She also claimed that the \"Ministry of Fools\" would blame \"the Grim man\" for at least a year. However, since Grim Fawley learned to manipulate the Calamity, this prophecy could have been falsified.[47]\n\nProfessor Trelawney was described as being a thin woman, usually draped in gauzy shawls, and cloaks and bangles all covered with shining sequins and glittering strings of beads.[15]\n\nShe had thick glasses, which hugely magnified her eyes and caused them to appear about ten times their normal size. She spoke in a soft, misty, ethereal voice, though she would become brisk and snappy when she was angry or upset.[15]\n\nDuring Umbridge's constant harassment, Trelawney's appearance became increasingly bedraggled from the stress, with Harry Potter describing her as though she was falling apart at the seams.[13]\n\nTrelawney was extremely eccentric; she had a theatrical presence and frequently spoke in misty, ethereal tones. She saw herself as being a great Seer, although her predictions rarely came true. Much like Gilderoy Lockhart, Trelawney was sometimes unable to understand who liked and who disliked her. She was, however, conscious of her low status amongst the staff, which led to her spending most of her time apart from her colleagues in her office. As a result of her long career at Hogwarts, Sybill was very attached to the school and considered it her home, being distraught when Dolores Umbridge sacked her.\n\nAccording to Professor McGonagall, seeing death omens was a favourite way for Trelawney to greet her class, something that greatly annoyed Harry Potter as he was her frequent target. One of her hobbies was practising doom-laden prophecies in front of the mirror.[1] She became angered when she believed that students were not impressed by nor interested in her subject, such as Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger.\n\nShe took her appearance as a Seer seriously, putting on showy airs of mysticism and veiling her classroom in scented vapours. She could be very defensive in the face of those disbelieving in her abilities, attempting to impress them with false predictions of impending danger. She would claim that those unbelievers had \"lack of Sight\" or that they were simply scared of Seers.\n\nDue to being constantly harassed by the Hogwarts High Inquisitor, Trelawney developed a drinking problem; a number of times Harry detected the smell of old sherry on her, and at one point, she was seen stowing away empty alcohol bottles in the Room of Requirement. This escalated as Umbridge placed her on probation, in which Sybill's stress at being monitored so closely led her to appear more drunk during work hours. Even after being reinstated the following year, Trelawney's alcoholism was milder but continued, as she was storing more sherry bottles in the Room.\n\nShe was very sensitive, most notably when Dolores Umbridge placed her on probation and then dismissed her. Trelawney expressed on how she believed that all of the High Inquisitor's questionings and demands were an insult to a self-proclaimed Seer, but her own inability to cope with the pressure led to a spiralling emotional breakdown that Umbridge considered to be an embarrassment to the rest of the school. Trewlaney's poor control over her emotions led her to behave more unprofessionally when she turned to alcoholism to such an extent that Harry could catch the smell of sherry on her; she was actually holding a bottle of sherry at the time of her dismissal. Sybill was, however, loyal to the school and defended it during the Battle of Hogwarts, showcasing her tremendous fighting spirit by launching fierce attacks against the Death Eaters.\n\nHer first true prediction was made in the presence of Albus Dumbledore at the Hog's Head Inn.[49] Trelawney was in the middle of an interview for a teaching job at Hogwarts when it was made. Dumbledore reported that he had decided not to give Trelawney the job, but changed his mind when he heard the prophecy. Trelawney herself was not aware that she made the prophecy, merely remembering that she came over faint, which she attributed to not having eaten that day.\n\nThis prediction is believed to refer to Voldemort (\"The Dark Lord\") and Harry Potter, who was born on 31 July. At the time of its prophesying, the identity of the child was not known as he had not been born yet. The time of year the prophecy was made is unknown.\n\nIt later became apparent that the prophecy could have applied to either Harry or Neville Longbottom, who was also born at the end of the seventh month on 30 July. Part of the prediction came to pass on the night of 31 October 1981, when Voldemort's body was destroyed after Harry survived an attack from him, using the killing curse, Avada Kedavra. The attack left Harry with an ability to speak Parseltongue, a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, and a mental connection to Voldemort. It was Dumbledore's view that it was Voldemort's choice of Harry as his target from between the two possible boys that caused Harry to have the power to vanquish the Dark Lord. In other words, the only reason Harry had the power to defeat Voldemort is that Voldemort believed he did. By attacking Harry, Voldemort caused the prophecy to become true.\n\nThe prophecy as interpreted by Dumbledore to Harry in June 1996 read: \"Someone (Harry or Neville) with the power to vanquish Voldemort is coming... born to those who have defied Voldemort three times (the Potters or the Longbottoms), born at the end of July... and Voldemort will attempt to kill Harry, but Harry will unexpectedly survive... either Harry or Voldemort must be killed by the other because one of them must die... Harry will be born at the end of July...\".\n\nWhen Harry and the others arrive in the Hall of Prophecy in the Department of Mysteries, Ron found a record of the prophecy that had a tag which read:\n\nS.P.T. stands for Sybill Patricia Trelawney and A.P.W.B.D. stands for Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. The question mark before the Harry Potter is because at the time it was unclear who the prophecy was written about, but when Voldemort sought to murder Harry, the prophecy record was changed to include his name.\n\nDuring her time teaching at Hogwarts, Professor Trelawney made her second true prophecy. It spoke about a \"child of the raven\" (a Ravenclaw student) who would meet their demise in Potton woods. Lenny Pindlebrook, a Ravenclaw student from Potton, believed this prophecy foretold his death.[5]\n\nProfessor Trelawney's third true prophecy prophesised this occurrence subconsciously to Harry Potter in 1994 in her classroom, after he took his final exam. It stated that later that same evening, a follower of Voldemort who had been chained for the past twelve years would escape and set out to rejoin his master and help him to return to power.\n\nThis prophecy came to pass when Ron Weasley's pet rat, Scabbers, was revealed to be Peter Pettigrew, an Animagus who betrayed the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War and sold out the Potter family to Voldemort and framed Sirius Black for his crimes. Pettigrew had been hiding out in his rat form in order to hide from Death Eaters who might have believed he sent their master into a trap, but stayed with the Weasleys, a Wizarding family, so he could keep up with the goings-on of the wizarding world.\n\nInitially, Pettigrew was discovered and captured by Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, but before they could clear Sirius's name, the full moon came out, and Remus's lycanthropy gave Pettigrew the opportunity to escape. Pettigrew was later able to track Voldemort down, and roughly a year after his escape, captured Harry and used his blood in a potion ritual to restore Voldemort to his former glory.\n\nProfessor Trelawney predicted the Calamity that happened in the 2020s during the 1990s, calling the Ministry a \"Ministry of fools\" who would blame it on a \"Grim man\". Although no record of this prophecy was held at the Ministry of Magic, it was rediscovered by Hermione Granger and Constance Pickering, who used it as evidence of Grim Fawley's innocence.[50]\n\nAside from her actual prophecies, Professor Trelawney had made other minor predictions on numerous occasions. She was always making predictions about the deaths of students that never came true, but aside from these death predictions, she had an impressively accurate track record. Whenever she made these predictions, it seemed like she was just making stuff up, trying to make herself seem all-knowing. Possibly her Inner Eye at work without her even realising it.\n\nAccording to Professor McGonagall, Trelawney had predicted the death of one student each year since her arrival at Hogwarts (which was in 1980). As of 1993, not a single one of those had yet died.[51] However, her predictions of death did not give any time frames. Since all people must die eventually, her predictions of death are necessarily accurate 100% of the time, as long as there was no time frame for these predictions to come to pass.\n\nSybill took great pride in her lineage of the great Seer Cassandra Trelawney, and tend to ride on that fact when trying to gain employment, despite showcasing none of her great-great-grandmother's talent.[1]\n\nSybill married a man by the surname Higglebottom, but her refusal to take his surname caused their marriage to end unexpectedly and rather acrimoniously.[1]\n\nLavender Brown and Parvati Patil seemed to have an exceptionally close relationship with Sybill Trelawney; they had an unwavering faith in the reliability of Trelawney's predictions, and were often seen comforting her and seeking out her company. The two girls often spent lunch periods in the North Tower with Trelawney, returning to the other Gryffindors with smug looks as though they knew something the others did not. Both of them even became offended on the Professor's behalf when Hermione made clear her disdain for Trelawney and the subject she taught in 1993. When she was temporarily sacked by Dolores Umbridge, Lavender and Parvati brought Trelawney some nice daffodils to cheer her up.\n\nFor her part, Trelawney seemed to return their genuine affection for her. For example, she told Parvati that she had the makings of a true Seer,[15] and tried in vain to save Lavender from Fenrir Greyback by dropping a crystal ball on his head during the Battle of Hogwarts. Sadly, Lavender died from her injuries caused by the werewolf.\n\nSybill Trelawney strongly disliked Dolores Umbridge, the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor and later Hogwarts High Inquisitor because of the way the pink nightmare treated her during her insulting inspections of Sybill's Divination classes as well as being asked to predict on command. It was during Umbridge's reign at Hogwarts when Harry, who did not like Trelawney very much, felt pity for her.\n\nUmbridge interfered in Trelawney's lessons and soon put the Divination teacher on probation. After receiving this news, Trelawney sobbed and furiously proclaimed dramatically that she had been insulted by the establishment, those whose eyes were clouded by the Mundane, and did not possess the Inner Eye, and that it was, alas, the fate of all Seers to be feared by society and persecuted. Trelawney, very distressed, then began to drink copious amounts of cooking sherry. She became somewhat brisk in her lessons, looking very bedraggled and harassed much of the time, and would sob uncontrollably while teaching.\n\nUmbridge believed that Trelawney was an old fraud and, true to her duties of High Inquisitor to weed out any unsatisfactory teachers, eventually sacked her in a rather unceremonious — and even cruel — way. When Dumbledore defended Trelawney and let her stay at Hogwarts, Umbridge was furious with Dumbledore because he had already picked out a replacement teacher, Firenze. Firenze was a centaur, a creature Umbridge was prejudiced against because of her hatred of \"half-breeds\". Umbridge left Hogwarts in 1996 after the Skirmish in the Forbidden Forest at the end of the school year, and Trelawney resumed teaching Divination along with Firenze, who could not go back to his herd in the Forest as they had banished him for working with humans. Trelawney viewed this as a great insult.\n\nProfessor Trelawney and Minerva McGonagall were colleagues as Professors at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. McGonagall had no use for Trelawney's subject, Divination, politely describing it as an 'imprecise' branch of magic. She also, like many others, believed that Trelawney was a fraud.[15]\n\nDespite her distaste for Trelawney and her teachings, the Professors would grow to understand one another through their shared hatred of Dolores Umbridge during the woman's tenure as the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor. When Dolores sacked Trelawney, McGonagall comforted her and spoke out against Umbridge's behaviour.[13]\n\nIn many ways, McGonagall's relationship with Trelawney was similar to Hermione Granger's relationship with Luna Lovegood.\n\nUpon their first meeting, Albus Dumbledore initially believed that she did not have the gifts of second sight, but when he heard her prophecy about Harry Potter and Voldemort, he hired her in order to protect her from the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters.  Although Dumbledore was sceptical of Divination, he was fond of Trelawney and she, in turn, was loyal to him and presumably approved of his approach to running Hogwarts. He did concede that she made two real prophecies, leading him to lightly joke that he should give her a pay rise.\n\nIn 1996, when Umbridge fired Trelawney, Dumbledore came to her defence, insisting that she remain as a resident of Hogwarts despite no longer being a teacher, and rejected Sybill's attempt to leave. The following term, Trelawney was angry with Dumbledore, as he allowed Firenze to continue teaching Divination alongside her. This made Trelawney think that Dumbledore disliked and insulted her, and she asked him several times to fire her.\n\nDuring 1997, Trelawney predicted Dumbledore's death at the Astronomy Tower several times without realising it.\n\nAfter Professor Trelawney was dismissed, Dumbledore hired the centaur Firenze to replace the vacant spot of Divination teacher. After Umbridge left Hogwarts and Trelawney was reinstated, Dumbledore refused to fire Firenze, as his herd would not take him back. This greatly angered Trelawney.\n\nCo-teaching with him, she called him names, such as \"the Nag\", and \"Dobbin\", among others. She believed that the headmaster preferred Firenze to herself. However, after the Second Wizarding War, she might have changed her opinion.\n\nCharms Master Filius Flitwick and Herbology teacher Pomona Sprout were kind enough to escort Professor Trelawney back to the North Tower after her dismissal, with Flitwick magically carrying her trunks and possessions.[13]\n\nShe disliked the Potions Master and former-Death Eater Severus Snape, most likely because he rudely eavesdropped on her job interview with Albus Dumbledore in the Hog's Head.\n\nProfessor Trelawney appeared to be friendly with a colleague of hers, who taught some unknown subject. She tended to her during the Battle of Hogwarts, but unfortunately, she did not survive the battle. Just before Voldemort summoned his troops back to the Forbidden Forest, the Professor's body was brought to the Great Hall. There were no signs of external damage so they believed she was taken by the Killing Curse.\n\n\"Sibyl\" was a priestess in ancient Roman mythology. A sibyl (one \"l\") is a woman who could look into the future. A sibyl also can be any female prophet. The name is from the Latin sibylla, seer.\n\n\"Sybil\" could also originate from the Sybilline Books, a Roman collection of oracular occurrences.\n\nHer middle name, \"Patricia\", comes from Latin and means \"noble woman\".\n\n\"Trelawney\" is derived from a famous cry of defiance from the south-west of England, a line from The Song of the Western Men, written in 1833 by the poet and parson Robert Stephens Hawker, that has been often shouted at football matches: \"And shall Trelawney live? And shall Trelawney die? Here's ten thousand Cornishmen who ask the reason why!\"\n\nThe name \"Trelawney\" comes from the Cornish phrase tre-lonow, homestead of groves, or tre-launow, farm in clearing.\n\nJ. K. Rowling has stated that she does not believe in magic, and does not intend that her readers should believe in it either. She has hinted that the portrayal of Trelawney (a mystic and fortune-teller, perhaps the kind of \"magic\" that children are most likely to come across) as something of an ineffectual old fraud may be related to this. However, her name and the reference to a grandmother named Cassandra is somewhat contradicting. In Greek mythology, Cassandra was a Trojan seer who received the gift of prophecy from Apollo, but when she spurned his romantic advances, the god in his wrath cursed her that she would be ever correct but never believed. This suggests that perhaps some of Trelawney's pronouncements may be more accurate than is often believed.\n\nShe said that she imagined that Trelawney's pre-Hogwarts existence consisted of drifting through the wizarding world, trying to trade on her ancestry to secure employment, and scorning those who did not offer her what she felt was the status due to a Seer.[1]",
