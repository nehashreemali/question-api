  "content": "Professor Quirinus Quirrell (26 September[5] 1967 or earlier[2] – 4 June[12] 1992) was a half-blood wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Ravenclaw House.[5] He was the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts, though he later became the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor during the 1991–1992 school year.\n\nBefore teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts, Quirrell went out in search of Voldemort, believing he could achieve recognition for finding him and could learn things that would ensure that no one laughed at him again.[4]\n\nHowever, Voldemort, after finding out that he taught at Hogwarts, took over his body, subsequently turning him into a temporary Horcrux, though Quirrell put up some feeble resistance. He died in vain while trying to murder Harry Potter in the Underground Chambers.[4]\n\nQuirinus Quirrell was born on 26 September[1] before or in 1967 somewhere in the British Isles, to a magical and a Muggle parent.[5][13] It is likely that he acquired his wand from Ollivanders when he was eleven.\n\nQuirinus attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he was Sorted into Ravenclaw House.[1] In his youth, he was a gifted student, but also a delicate young wizard who was frequently teased by his peers because of his timidity and nerves. Feeling inadequate and wishing to prove himself, he eventually developed what began as a solely theoretical interest in the Dark Arts. The feelings of insignificance and worthlessness that this bullying fostered embittered him; forging a latent desire to make the world sit up and notice him.[5]\n\nMinerva McGonagall was a professor during this time, and was very kind and helpful to the young Quirrell, encouraging him to value knowledge. He was very grateful towards her, and admired her bravery, wisdom, thirst for knowledge and kindness.[13] He also most likely obtained a high-graded O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. in Muggle Studies and Defence Against the Dark Arts, since not only did he go on to teach both but was also noted to have had a gift for the theory of Defensive Magic.[5]\n\nSometime after he graduated from Hogwarts, Professor Quirrell returned to the school as a teacher, becoming the school's new Muggle Studies professor.[14] During the special Teacher Appreciation Celebration at Hogwarts in the 1985–1986 school year, Merula Snyde was given the task to interview and learn about Quirrell, though she was not too pleased about this due to him being the Muggle Studies professor at the time.\n\nJacob's sibling also went to visit him to learn more about Minerva McGonagall. During their meeting, Quirrell asked them their opinion of Merula, wondering whether they thought she was good or bad or somewhere in between. He also revealed that Professor McGonagall's influence during some of the difficult times in his Hogwarts years were the \"reason he is a teacher today\".[13]\n\nAfter teaching Muggle Studies for some time, he took a year-long sabbatical in 1990 in order to \"gain first-hand experience\"[7] and was succeeded by Arif Sikander,[15] though the real nature of his sabbatical was a 'Grand Tour' around the world in order to hopefully find whatever remained of Voldemort after his first defeat, partly out of curiosity, partly out of that unacknowledged desire for importance from his childhood.[4][5]\n\nAt the very least, Quirrell fantasised that he could be the man who tracked Voldemort down, but at best, might learn skills from Voldemort that would ensure he was never laughed at again. His journey proved successful as he did indeed find Voldemort, though he was no match for the Dark Lord (even in such a weakened state) and when he realised that Quirinus had a position at Hogwarts, Voldemort latched onto Quirrell's body, intending to go back to Hogwarts with him.[5]\n\nQuirrell also adopted a turban for everyday use after this sabbatical, claiming to have received it from an African prince as a reward for the disposition of a zombie.[16] It was also rumoured that he encountered vampires in the Black Forest, in Albania, and had a nasty bit of trouble with a hag.[7]\n\nQuirrell returned to Hogwarts at the end of the 1990–1991 school year and prepared to take on the job of Defence Against the Dark Arts professor in the next year, after his predecessor Olivia Green resigned and returned to the Ministry. He visited what he thought would be his future classroom and began tidying it up, when he met Jacob's sibling again, who was about to graduate and came to see Green.\n\nHe was at the time wearing his turban and stuttered while talking, which Jacob's sibling perceived as him being nervous. He informed them of Green's decision while they were cleaning the room together, and talked about the jinx placed on the job.[17]\n\nQuirrell at some unknown point prior to 1991 came into possession of Vault 998 in the new vault area of Gringotts Wizarding Bank. He kept a small box containing various belongings, a large crate, and a chest containing Circe's Chocolate Frog Card that was given by Cuthbert Binns to James Potter before Quirrell came into possession of it.[18]\n\nQuirrell spent his last year of life attempting to procure the Philosopher's Stone for Voldemort, who used his nervous disposition to his advantage, as his perceived lack of confidence had earned very little respect from the students at Hogwarts and consequently diverted suspicion away from his plans.[16]\n\nQuirrell's first plan was enacted before the school term started and involved going to Diagon Alley in an attempt to steal the Philosopher's Stone from Gringotts Wizarding Bank for Voldemort on 31 July 1991.[4] While in the Leaky Cauldron, he met Harry Potter, who had come with Rubeus Hagrid. Quirrell pretended that he was going to buy a new book on vampires. Quirrell was unsuccessful in his attempted robbery, as Rubeus Hagrid had removed the Stone from its vault earlier that same day on Albus Dumbledore's orders.[7]\n\nAfter this first failure, Voldemort began to share Quirrell's body to ensure no further failure would occur, and as Voldemort's face was sticking out of the back of his head, Quirrell had to wear his turban for the entire school year. Quirrell tried to put up feeble resistance on occasion, but Voldemort was far too strong for him to overpower.[4]\n\nAfter this attempted break-in, he returned to Hogwarts to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts.[7] As the third-floor corridor was out of bounds,[19] he had to use another classroom instead of Classroom 3C.[20] A few of his classes included the Curse of the Bogies,[21] the Knockback Jinx,[22] Lumos,[22] and Verdimillious.[23] The majority of the students found Quirrell's lessons to be a joke, as they did not take him seriously as a teacher.\n\nOn Hallowe'en, Quirrell allowed a troll to enter Hogwarts as a diversion, and sneaked off to the restricted third-floor corridor where the Stone was being hidden. Severus Snape, who suspected Quirrell, followed him and was bitten on the leg by the three-headed dog, Fluffy, in the process of trying to head Quirrell off.[24][4]\n\nLater in the year, during a Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin, Quirrell made his first attempt at Harry Potter's life. He jinxed Harry's broomstick to try to throw him off, but Severus Snape interfered again with a counter-curse. When Hermione Granger observed the crowd through binoculars in an attempt to figure out who was performing the jinx, she caught Snape discreetly uttering the counter-curse incantation but erroneously thought he was performing the actual curse.\n\nShe later managed to run to Snape's stand and set fire to his robes in order to distract him and make him stop, but in her hurry she accidentally knocked Quirrell over, causing him to break the eye contact necessary for performing his spell correctly.[25][4]\n\nAfter the Quidditch match Harry witnessed an intense exchange between Snape and Quirrell. It seemed as though Snape was trying to intimidate Quirrell into handing over information regarding the stone.[25] When Harry, Ron, and Hermione believed that Severus Snape was trying to intimidate Quirrell into helping him steal the Philosopher's Stone, they tried to be supportive and encouraging to Quirrell whenever possible by telling people off for laughing at his stutter, or smiling at him encouragingly whenever they passed him.[26]\n\nAbout a week before Harry's exams, Voldemort ordered Quirrell to try to get the Stone again. Harry overheard this, and mistook the conversation for an argument between Snape and Quirrell.[27] Throughout the year, Quirrell's body weakened drastically from hosting his master's soul, and in order to keep himself and Voldemort alive, Quirrell began to prey on unicorns in the Forbidden Forest and drink their blood.[4] He met Harry, Draco Malfoy and Fang there, and was about to attack Harry until Firenze the centaur rescued the boy and made him flee.[27]\n\nOn 4 June, after Dumbledore had left for London, both Quirrell and the trio went through the obstacles blocking the way to the Stone.[4] To get past Fluffy, Quirrell disguised himself and lured Hagrid into a card game by betting a dragon egg. During the game, he managed to draw out information about Fluffy by convincing Hagrid that he was a dragon dealer, and as such, shared Hagrid's penchant for dangerous pets.[28]\n\nIn Hagrid's enthusiasm, and most likely under the influence of alcohol, he let slip that playing music for the three-headed dog would put him to sleep. Quirrell then sent a forged letter to Professor Dumbledore summoning him to the British Ministry of Magic to get him away from the school. He went after the Stone, but was followed by Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger — though they believed their enemy to be Severus Snape.[28][4]\n\nQuirrell was able to penetrate the first six chambers that protected the Philosopher's Stone, including the chamber in which he himself put a troll. He reached the final chamber only to find the Mirror of Erised, and was unable to figure out how to take the stone from it, going so far as to consider smashing the mirror.[4]\n\nHarry eventually managed to reach the final chamber by himself and was surprised to meet Quirrell instead of Snape. Quirrell non-verbally bound Harry and summoned a wall of fire behind the door to prevent him from escaping, then, on Voldemort's command, forced Harry to look into the mirror.\n\nHarry saw his reflection with the Stone in his own trousers' pocket, and felt it indeed being transferred to his real pocket. When Harry lied about what he saw in the mirror. Harry stated that he saw himself shaking hands with Dumbledore and that he had won the House Cup. Voldemort then asked to speak to Harry and Quirrell unwrapped his turban to reveal Voldemort's face bound to the back of his head.[4]\n\nQuirrell's life ended then, when Voldemort forced him to attempt the murder of Harry Potter (figuring out Harry had the Stone and being unable to persuade him to give it willingly). Unfortunately, the body Quirrell and Voldemort were both sharing manifested in burns and blisters during his fight with Harry due to the protective charm Harry's mother left in his skin when she died for him. Harry collapsed from the pain in his scar, but Quirrell's body was burnt so horribly that Voldemort dispossessed his body and left him to die.[4]\n\nHowever, despite being effectively turned into a living Horcrux for the last year of his life, Quirrell did not ultimately lose his soul, having even tried to put up feeble resistance on occasion (in spite of the fact that Voldemort was far too strong for him).[5]\n\nThree years after Quirrell's death, Lord Voldemort told his Death Eaters during their rendezvous in Little Hangleton that Quirrell was a fool, and that he only allied with him for his position as a professor at Hogwarts.[29]\n\nIn 1995, the then Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Dolores Umbridge mentioned him when she was criticising the past DADA professors for not teaching them things that would pass a Ministry inspection, considering that he was a possible exception due to teaching \"age-appropriate subjects\". Harry then retorted that Voldemort was on the back of his head, earning him another week's detention.[30]\n\nQuirinus Quirrell was a young man with pale white skin.[8]\n\nWhen Quirrell returned from his sabbatical in Albania, one of his eyes developed a twitch and he appeared quite pale and anxious and frequently stuttered. At the start of the term, he was wearing a purple turban.[19]\n\nHe was usually trembling and prone to fainting.[24] Near the end of his life, his reason for wearing the turban became clear. Quirrell had joined with Voldemort and agreed to allow Voldemort's fledgling body to latch on to the back of his head. It was only able to grow into a face and used Quirrell for transportation and sustenance.[4]\n\nIn his youth, Quirrell was gifted, but emotionally fragile. He became interested in travelling as well as pressing wild flowers, stemming from his early enthusiasm in academia, and continued to do so in his adult years. By his own admittance, he was 'full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil'.\n\nAs a young boy, he was teased and neglected for his timid nature, and came to develop a latent desire for recognition and greatness, cynical feeling for society, and was seduced by the Dark Arts, no matter how subtle the lure appeared at first.[5] This led him to foolishly search out for Voldemort's remains in the hopes of fame and knowledge,[4] while exposing his impressionable and naive side to the fallen Dark Lord.[29] Quirinus' journey to capture Voldemort showcased his own overestimation of his own skills, possibly a slight arrogance, as Voldemort easily overpowered him.\n\nWhen Quirrell met Voldemort, he arrived at the conclusion that 'there is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it'. Meeting Voldemort made Quirrell admit himself as a 'foolish young man [he] was then', apparently looking down on his past self, showing his gullibility, and weak will, and was easily corrupted. Quirrell generally did his best to serve Voldemort, though he admitted that his attempts were not always successful, seeing as he was being given rather tall orders.\n\nDumbledore considered Quirrell to be greedy, hateful and ambitious, a reason why Quirrell could not understand the powerful magic of love, which was what heavily injured him during the battle with Harry Potter. Despite Quirrell's continuous descent into corruption, he did not completely submit his existence to Voldemort as he attempted to resist the Dark Lord's soul of possessing his body, feeble and futile though it may have been.[4]\n\nThroughout the school year, Quirrell appeared nervous and timid. He frequently stuttered and was mostly an incompetent teacher. Though his nervousness was probably very real due to the enormous pressure being put upon him by Voldemort, Quirrell had a chillingly sinister side that most people never saw. He was extremely adept at conniving and manipulation; at one point, he disguised himself and tricked Hagrid into revealing crucial information on how to get past one of the obstacles protecting the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nAnother time he let a fully-grown Mountain Troll into the school on Hallowe'en as a diversion while he headed off to the third-floor corridor and tried to penetrate its defences.[24] He even managed to deceive the great Albus Dumbledore by forging a Ministry letter to him to lure him away from school, although Dumbledore was quick to realise that Quirrell had fooled him and returned to Hogwarts.[4]\n\nPresumably because of his constant failures, Quirrell eventually became obsessed with pleasing Voldemort and whenever he looked into the Mirror of Erised he would see himself with the Philosopher's Stone, the object Voldemort desired above all else. Quirrell became very desperate, being willing to slay unicorns in order to drink their blood to keep himself alive, a crime that is noted by Firenze only those who have nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit.[27]\n\nMany people considered Quirrell to be foolish, avaricious, worthless, and tended to look down on him. Severus Snape confided to Bellatrix Lestrange that he considered Quirrell as a mediocre wizard who was greedy and unworthy;[31] many students saw his lessons to be a bit of a joke and saw Quirrell himself as undeserving of respect;[16] and Voldemort deemed Quirrell as a foolish and gullible man who he only allied with for his position.[29] Even Dumbledore himself, who had retained a level of pity and compassion even for his much more incompetent successor, openly acknowledged that Quirell's fate was well-deserved due to his greed, hatred and ambitions without any care.[4]\n\nQuirrell was known to have had an excellent aptitude for theoretical learning, particularly when it came to Defensive Magic.[5] Even so, as Professor McGonagall later pointed out that teachers of Hogwarts generally speaking were rather good at magic,[32] it can be assumed that he also possessed a considerable amount of magical ability.\n\nQuirinus Quirrell first met Lord Voldemort in 1991, in the forests of Albania, where Voldemort subjugated Quirrell into servitude. Quirrell brought him back to Britain, and eventually to Hogwarts. The Dark Lord planned to obtain the Philosopher's Stone and fabricate the Elixir of Life to acquire a body.[29] Quirrell attempted to infiltrate Vault 713 of Gringotts Wizarding Bank, in order to steal the Philosopher's Stone. Quirrell managed to break in, but found the vault had been emptied by Rubeus Hagrid and Harry Potter earlier that day.[4]\n\nFollowing this failed attempt, Voldemort began a parasitic relationship with Quirrell, in which he attached himself to the back of Quirrell's head, to ensure his plans were being followed precisely; throughout the year, Quirrell attempted to resist the possession, feeble and futile though his efforts were. Voldemort ordered Quirrell to kill Harry Potter, though Quirrell's attempts to do so were thwarted by Severus Snape and Hermione Granger. Harry penetrated the Philosopher's Stone Chambers in pursuit of Snape, or so he believed, only to find it was Quirrell in front of the Mirror of Erised.\n\nQuirrell, under Voldemort's orders, demanded Harry draw the Stone from the Mirror; though Harry was successfully able to retrieve the stone, he attempted to conceal the fact by lying about what he saw in the mirror. Quirrell revealed Voldemort, who tried to manipulate Harry into handing over the Stone by offering him the chance to see his parents, and upon Harry's refusal, ordered Quirrell to take the stone by force. Quirrell, sharing his body with Voldemort, found himself unable to touch 'a person marked by something so good' (referring to Lily Potter's sacrificial protection). Voldemort separated his soul from Quirrell's body to escape the pain, and left Quirrell to die, as Albus Dumbledore noted, showing him as little mercy as he did to his enemies.[4]\n\nThree years later, Voldemort told his Death Eaters that Quirrell was a fool, and that he only allied with him for his position.[29] It should be noted that despite his fear of Voldemort and that he was not a Death Eater, Quirrell was one of Voldemort's only followers who referred to him by name,[4] the others being Bartemius Crouch Junior and Peter Pettigrew.\n\nQuirrell first met Harry Potter in 1991, at the Leaky Cauldron, in Diagon Alley. Quirrell greeted Harry in the same way most of the wizarding community did, seeming thrilled to meet 'The Boy who Lived'. Though Harry found Quirrell's twitchy behaviour odd, he was generally pleased to meet Quirrell, as a friend of Hagrid's and as his soon-to-be Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts.[7]\n\nHarry eventually came to believe that Severus Snape was attempting to threaten Quirrell into helping him penetrate the defences surrounding the Philosopher's Stone, for Voldemort. As it seemed like the only thing standing between Snape and a means of restoring Voldemort to power was Quirrell's will, Harry did what he could to encourage Quirrell and help build his confidence.[26]\n\nAs it turned out, Quirrell was a servant of Voldemort, and it was he, not Snape, who was aiming to steal the Philosopher's Stone for the Dark Lord, and, if possible, kill Harry along the way. When they met for the last time in the final of the Philosopher's Stone Chambers, Quirrell's connection to Voldemort rendered him unable to touch Harry without experiencing unbearable pain, due to the enduring power of Lily Potter's sacrificial protection, and he died attempting to steal the stone from Harry by force.[4]\n\nAbout four years after this, when Dolores Umbridge commented positively on Quirrell's teaching methods, Harry sarcastically agreed before pointing out the deceased professor's duplicity.[30] A year after that, when Snape finally took over as the Defence teacher, Harry made a snide comment of Quirrell dying on the job, and hoped that Snape would also die.[33]\n\nWith the exception of Severus Snape, Quirrell generally got along well with most of the faculty at Hogwarts, including Filius Flitwick, Pomona Sprout, Minerva McGonagall and Rubeus Hagrid. Hagrid seemed to think highly of Quirrell, and considered him to be a very clever and talented wizard for his extensive world travels and experience fighting the Dark Arts.[7]\n\nHowever, as Quirrell didn't show his true personality, it is possible he did not like all of them, and it is probable they were all disgusted by Quirrell's actions once his true nature was revealed. Quirrell additionally took advantage of Hagrid's love for magical creatures through getting him drunk and giving him an illegal Dragon egg so that he revealed the secret of getting past Fluffy. Hagrid afterwards was horrified when he learnt of Quirrell's true nature and the fact that he manipulated him for his own ends, calling him an \"evil git\" when he visited Harry in the Hospital Wing after Quirrell's death.\n\nSeverus Snape, however, was the only one apart from Albus Dumbledore who saw Quirrell for what he really was.[34] His contempt partially stemmed from the fact that Quirrell was the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor — a position that Snape had wanted for years.[16] Along with being ordered by Dumbledore to keep an eye on Quirrell,[35]\n\nSnape may have guessed that Quirrell was hiding his true intentions, as he told him to 'decide where his loyalties lie', though Harry Potter and his friends believed that Snape was threatening Quirrell in order to get information about how to get into the Philosopher's Stone chamber.[34] Years later, Snape described Quirrell as greedy and worthless to Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy.[31]\n\nAs Headmaster Albus Dumbledore was a highly intelligent and powerful wizard, he was aware of Quirrell's true nature even though he maintained a relatively civil relationship with him.\n\nThis was further evidenced by the fact he asked Snape to keep an eye on Quirrell.[35] After the events in the Philosopher's Stone chambers, Dumbledore expressed his opinion to Harry that Quirrell, much like Voldemort, was full of hatred, greed and ambition, and was flawed for his inability to understand 'good and evil', and his desire for power.[4]\n\nAbout four years after his demise, Quirrell's theory-based teaching method was praised by the then Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge, due to the Ministry's paranoia of the students training to become Dumbledore's private army.[30]\n\nDuring his one year as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirrell was constantly nervous and stuttering. As a result, he gained very little respect from his students, who looked down on his classes as a joke and did not take him seriously as a teacher.[16]\n\nThe name 'Quirinus' is possibly derived from the Sabine word quiris meaning 'spear'. Quirinus was a Sabine and a Roman god, the reincarnated form of Romulus (Rome's founder) who was later identified with Mars. The name was also borne by several early saints.\n\nQuirinus is also used as an epithet for the Roman god Janus, a god with two faces similar to Quirrell after he was possessed by Voldemort. This could be a clue to the malevolence of his character. Janus was the god of beginnings, and Quirrell was the first one to find Voldemort in Albania, thereby beginning the Dark Lord's return to power, in a way, and was the first Dark Wizard that Harry ever directly confronted.\n\n'Quirrell', which is so nearly 'squirrel' — small, cute and harmless — also suggested 'quiver', is a nod to the character's innate nervousness.",
