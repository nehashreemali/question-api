  "content": "Dobby (28 June (year unknown) – March 1998) was a male house-elf who served the Malfoy family. His masters were Dark wizards who treated him cruelly. In 1992, he disobeyed his masters and tried to warn Harry Potter of the plot to have the Chamber of Secrets reopened. He came to know this via the contact between his masters and Lord Voldemort.\n\nAt the end of that school year, after Harry had vanquished the memory of Tom Riddle and slayed the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, he tricked Lucius Malfoy into freeing Dobby. Harry accomplished this by placing T. M. Riddle's Diary inside his own sock.[14] Lucius disgustedly ripped the sock off the book and threw the sock into the air, where Dobby caught it.\n\nDobby suffered a period of unemployment, during which he was often ostracised for having no \"proper shame\" in regards to being out of work. He was generally pleased to be free, although he did enjoy working as a hobby. Dobby was ecstatic to be out of the abusive hands of the Malfoys, but equally pleased to join the Hogwarts staff. At Hogwarts he could come and go as he liked, did not have many tasks, and those he did have were fairly simple. Dobby requested some compensations for his work and eventually he and Dumbledore came to an agreement.\n\nDobby went on to work in the kitchens at Hogwarts, for which he was paid one Galleon a week and got one day off each month. He had been accompanied to Hogwarts by his friend Winky (who had recently been dismissed) and so began Dobby's new happy life nearby his closest friends: Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\nIn 1997, Dobby helped Harry spy on Draco Malfoy along with Kreacher. In 1998, he went on Aberforth Dumbledore's orders to save the lives of Harry and his companions from Death Eaters at Malfoy Manor. During this rescue he was fatally wounded by Bellatrix Lestrange's knife, but successfully Apparated Harry and Griphook to safety at Shell Cottage. Harry dug Dobby's grave without magic in the gardens of Shell Cottage, and carved into the headstone of the grave \"HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF\". His death was later avenged by Molly Weasley.\n\nDobby was the resident house-elf of Malfoy Manor, serving Lucius Malfoy, his wife Narcissa, and their only son Draco.[5] They treated Dobby with unkindness and cruelty, often reminding him to perform extra punishments on himself whenever he did something disagreeable to them.[3] The Malfoys were harsh and abused Dobby often.\n\nDobby was threatened many times during his time serving the Malfoy family and told Harry Potter that he was accustomed to death threats, because he received them 'five times a day' from the Malfoys.[8] Though he always did as he was told, he knew that their behaviour was wrong and he longed to be free of them.[3][5] He is the first house-elf seen to \"break free\" of his masters' wills, warning Harry of the Chamber of Secrets (Kreacher did this too, however he technically did not disobey any orders, therefore it does not count), and alongside Kreacher, is the only house elf seen who truly dislikes their original master.\n\nDuring the 1985–1986 school year, Dobby befriended Jacob's sibling.[15]\n\nDobby knew of the plan to reopen the Chamber of Secrets during Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts. Presumably, this was because the Malfoys saw Dobby as an insignificant slave, and because they knew that house-elves were not able to break the commands of their masters, never believing he would try to interfere.[3] Dobby spent the summer of 1992 spying on Harry. On the day of his twelfth birthday Harry thought he saw eyes peeking from with the hedges.[16]\n\nDobby went to the Dursley house to warn Harry not to go back to school, revealing that he had been intercepting his mail. The withholding of Harry's letters from his friends was done in an attempt to convince him that his friends had abandoned him. Harry adamantly refused to comply, stating that Hogwarts was his home. Dobby then performed a Hover Charm on Aunt Petunia's pudding and dumped the pudding on top of Mrs Mason's head. This use of magic was detected by the Ministry of Magic through the Trace.[3]\n\nMafalda Hopkirk of the Improper Use of Magic Office sent Harry a warning letter for the apparent transgression by an under-age wizard, informing the Dursleys that Harry was not allowed to use magic outside of school.[3] Harry was then locked in his room.[3] However Ron, Fred, and George Weasley came in their dad's enchanted flying car to free him from the Dursleys.[17]\n\nUnfazed, Dobby covertly watched Harry Potter and magically sealed the barrier to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, preventing Harry and Ron from reaching the Hogwarts Express.[8] This too failed, as the two used the flying car again to get to Hogwarts instead. This, however, almost caused Harry's and Ron's expulsion from Hogwarts, due to their damaging the Whomping Willow after arriving late at the school.[18] Dobby was so shocked to hear that they managed to return to Hogwarts that he accidentally allowed the Malfoys' dinner to burn, for which he was punished.[8]\n\nLastly, Dobby tried his most risky and dangerous plan by tampering with a Bludger to make it attack Harry during a Quidditch match, hoping to send him back to Privet Drive injured, but alive. This plan could not have been too well thought-out, because, under normal circumstances, Madam Pomfrey, the school nurse, would have been able to mend Harry's injuries instantly. However, an unfortunate blunder by Professor Gilderoy Lockhart resulted in Harry losing all the bones in his right arm. Madam Pomfrey was able to regrow the bones by using Skele-Gro, but it took an entire night.\n\nWhile Harry was in the Hospital Wing recovering, Dobby appeared and admitted his acts, enraging Harry to the point that he threatened to strangle him. Dobby implored Harry to leave, accidentally admitting that the Chamber of Secrets had been opened before. Harry demanded to know who had opened it last time, but Dobby refused to reveal any more information and Disapparated when he heard someone coming.[8]\n\nNear the end of Harry's second year, Lucius Malfoy came to the school with Dobby to see if it was true that Headmaster Albus Dumbledore had returned. Here, realising that Dobby belonged to the Malfoys, Harry stuffed Tom Riddle's Diary into one of his socks and handed it to Lucius. Lucius ripped the sock off the diary, only for the sock to be caught by Dobby.[5] This act freed Dobby from the Malfoys.[14]\n\nWhen Lucius tried to attack Harry in retaliation, Dobby blasted him backwards down a flight of stairs. Although house elves are treated as low-class slaves, they have very powerful magic, and even some beyond wizard ability. Harry's only request in return for granting Dobby freedom was for Dobby never to try to save his life again.[5]\n\nAfter becoming a free elf, Dobby struggled to find work, as he wanted to be paid, which was uncommon for house-elves.[19] Eventually, he was hired by Dumbledore to work in the kitchens of Hogwarts for a Galleon a week and one day a month off. Hermione Granger was initially indignant at the amount of pay, but Dobby explained that he requested that amount, as Dumbledore had offered ten Galleons a week and weekends off. It was just before this time that Hermione formed the organisation called S.P.E.W, which Ron often derisively called \"spew\".[7]\n\nWhen Winky, Barty Crouch Snr's house-elf, was given clothes and freed of her servitude, she did not accept it as a reward as Dobby had, but rather as punishment and a shameful failure in the fashion of most house-elves.[7] She took up work at Hogwarts as well, but she became a heavy drinker of butterbeer, and Dobby took care of her.[20] For a time, Dobby was the only Hogwarts house-elf who would clean Gryffindor Tower, because Hermione had hidden woollen hats and socks in with the rubbish with the intention of freeing them. The Hogwarts house-elves refused thereafter to clean the common room, as they viewed the hidden clothes to be insulting.[10] This was a delight for Dobby, though, because it allowed him to see Harry and his friends,[10] including Ron Weasley, whom he called Harry's \"Wheezy.\"[9]\n\nDuring the second task of the Triwizard Tournament, Bartemius Crouch Jnr, who was disguised as Alastor Moody, tricked Dobby into stealing a helping of Gillyweed from Severus Snape's storeroom to give to Harry Potter.[21] This allowed Harry to breathe underwater and retrieve Ron Weasley and Gabrielle Delacour from the lake.[9]\n\nDobby continued to work in the kitchens at Hogwarts, but was an outsider among the other elves in the castle. Over the course of his employment at Hogwarts, Dobby became close friends with Aberforth Dumbledore and spent much time at Aberforth's home in Hogsmeade. Aberforth seemed to have a close attachment to Dobby, since he felt very sorry when he learned of his death.[13]\n\nIn 1995, when Dolores Umbridge banned all clubs at Hogwarts, Harry half-heartedly asked Dobby if he knew of a secret place in which they could have meetings for Dumbledore's Army; Dobby subsequently told him of the Room of Requirement and how to get into it. He knew of this secret room, because he had used it frequently to hide Winky after she became drunk from Butterbeer. Harry successfully made use of the room and thus was able to start holding Dumbledore's Army meetings.[10]\n\nWhen Marietta Edgecombe betrayed Dumbledore's Army to Professor Umbridge, Dobby immediately warned Harry that the Inquisitorial Squad was going to attack, even though the house-elves had been forbidden to tell anyone, but he told Harry as he was far more loyal to him than to Umbridge or Hogwarts in general and also a free elf that was not forced to obey. When he heard, Harry ordered Dobby not to punish himself for disobeying a direct order from Umbridge. Despite Dobby's warning, however, Harry and the other members were still caught and punished.[11]\n\nOn Harry's orders, Dobby, along with Kreacher, formerly the House of Black's house-elf who now belonged to Harry, tailed Draco Malfoy and helped Harry learn that Draco was using the Room of Requirement. Kreacher insulted Harry and stated that Draco would be a better master.\n\nDobby physically fought Kreacher and knocked out several of his teeth and tearfully told him that Harry was a great wizard and that the Malfoys were not good masters for a house-elf. Dobby felt that helping Harry was an honour and didn't even sleep on his job until Harry (not knowing this) said he could.[12]\n\nCaptured by a group of Snatchers led by Fenrir Greyback, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dean Thomas, and the goblin Griphook were taken to Malfoy Manor. There, Bellatrix Lestrange saw that they were carrying the Sword of Gryffindor, and she stopped Lucius Malfoy from summoning Voldemort, afraid they had been in her Gringotts vault. Keeping Hermione upstairs for interrogation and torture, Bellatrix had the others imprisoned in the locked cellar, where they encountered Luna Lovegood and Garrick Ollivander, who were also being held there. Though the new arrivals were tied up, Luna found a nail with which she was able to cut their bonds.[2]\n\nDesperate at hearing Hermione's cries of pain from above, Harry frantically fidgeted with the fragment of the two-way mirror Sirius Black had given him years before and saw a sky-blue eye looking out of it at him. Harry pleaded for help from the owner of the eye, Aberforth Dumbledore, and soon Dobby, sent by Aberforth, Apparated into the cellar. As he was able to Disapparate to and from the Manor, Harry instructed him to first take Luna, Dean, and Mr Ollivander from the cellar, then return. He did so, bringing the three to Shell Cottage, the home of Bill Weasley and his wife Fleur Delacour.\n\nFrom upstairs, where she was now questioning Griphook about whether or not the sword was the real one, Bellatrix heard the noise of Dobby Disapparating and sent Peter Pettigrew to investigate. Harry and Ron managed to overpower Pettigrew when he hesitated, reminded of his life debt to Harry, and his own magical silver hand gifted to him by Voldemort strangled him to death.[2]\n\nAttempting to rescue Hermione and Griphook, Harry and Ron were forced to surrender when a disarmed Bellatrix threatened to cut Hermione's throat with a silver knife. Dobby announced his return by causing a chandelier to fall on Bellatrix. Dobby also disarmed Narcissa Malfoy and informed Bellatrix that he had no masters, as he was a free elf. Harry seized the wands Draco Malfoy was holding and used a stunning spell on Fenrir Greyback. Ron grabbed Hermione and they Disapparated to Shell Cottage, while Harry also Disapparated with Dobby and Griphook.[2]\n\nAs Harry Disapparated, Bellatrix threw her silver knife at him. Harry, not knowing where he was heading, was relieved to find in the midst of his Disapparition, that he could feel Dobby alongside, his fingers gripped tightly in his hand. Arriving at Shell Cottage, Harry discovered that Dobby had been fatally wounded by Bellatrix's thrown knife, which was protruding from the elf's chest. Dobby died moments later in Harry's arms, a peaceful smile on his face, his final words being Harry's name.[22]\n\nHarry, deeply grieving, decided to bury Dobby and dig his grave by hand without using magic. Ron and Dean joined Harry and laboured with him in digging the grave. They placed Dobby's body in the grave, wrapping him in a jacket and giving him socks, shoes and a hat. Standing over Dobby, Luna gently closed his eyes and thanked him for rescuing her and the others. Bill Weasley filled in the grave, while Harry used Draco's former wand and carved \"HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF\" on a flat rock he placed on the burial mound.[22]\n\nGriphook was positively affected by Harry's display of humility and love for the house-elf, aiding him in his decision to help Harry retrieve a Horcrux from Gringotts Wizarding Bank.[23] His death also helped close Harry's mind from Voldemort and gave him greater control over when he could access the Dark Lord's thoughts. Kreacher, Harry Potter's own inherited house-elf, led the house-elves of Hogwarts in the Battle of Hogwarts, moved by Harry's good treatment of house-elves. Dobby's death was later avenged when Molly Weasley killed Bellatrix.[24]\n\nOver a decade later around his birthday in 2011, Dobby was remembered by Winky as a S.P.E.W. activist and a good friend.[25]\n\nIn the years since Dobby's death, Harry continued to regularly visit Dobby's grave at Shell Cottage to pay respects to the elf, bringing along a new pair of socks to leave at the grave each time to let Dobby know how much he was missed.[26]\n\nDobby was a house-elf, much shorter in stature than humans, standing only about 3 and a half feet (1.06 m). He had large, tennis-ball-like green eyes,[4] a pencil-like nose and long,[27] bat-like pointed ears[4] and brown skin.[5] Before he was given freedom, he wore a body-covering pillowcase. Later at Hogwarts, he wore a mismatched variety of jumpers, shorts, and socks.\n\nSocks became his favourite clothing after he was freed by Harry's sock. He preferred colourful, mismatched socks. When Hermione Granger began hiding clothes she made around the Gryffindor Common Room in an attempt to free the Hogwarts house-elves, Dobby kept the clothes and began wearing them, as the other elves thereafter refused to clean Gryffindor Tower.\n\nDobby was a brave, loyal house-elf, willing to put himself in dangerous situations when he knew it to be the right thing to do.[3][2] He was also very loyal to the few friends he had. He considered himself to be a good house-elf, though other house-elves seemed to find his desires and proclamations of being a free house-elf to be shameful. Despite this, he was still a hard worker. When he went to work at Hogwarts he refused Dumbledore's original offer of ten Galleons a week and weekends off, opting instead for one Galleon a week and one day off per month. He explained to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that he liked freedom very much, but he liked work better. Although he enjoyed his freedom, he still showed some nature of a House Elf, showing some form of either disgust or fear in the sign of a little shudder at the sign of too much riches and leisure, such as those of a truly sustainable wage and work schedule, which Dumbledore originally offered. Dobby thought of Harry as his best friend, and Albus Dumbledore as his rightful and true master.\n\nBecause of his loyalty to his friends, Dobby tried everything he could to save them if they were in danger, even if it hurt them, and once attempted to seriously injure Harry Potter, hoping that if he was hurt badly enough he would be sent home (this led to Harry asking Dobby to never try to save him again after setting him free). He did not make the rogue Bludger chase Harry out of malicious intent, but because he was trying to save him from Lucius Malfoy's plot to open the Chamber of Secrets.[8] When Harry found out, he was furious but Dobby explained why he had tampered with the Bludger,[8] and by the end of the year Harry had forgiven him.[5]\n\nRegardless, Dobby displayed a lack of foresight and common sense in his efforts to keep Harry from returning to Hogwarts in that by doing so he was putting Harry in danger in the long run by essentially ending Harry's education, which would have left him vulnerable to his enemies. Not only that, he was unintentionally insensitive to the wishes and feelings of Harry, who loved Hogwarts and his friends, and Dobby was essentially trying to cut Harry off from the things in his life that gave him real joy and purpose.\n\nOne most noticeable trait was his capacity to self-harm whenever he believed he had done something wrong, usually using something to hit his head with and going as far as to iron his own hands. Dobby clearly had a strong conscience, and punished himself even when he had done \"wrong\" things that house elves should not do, even if they were for the right reasons.[3]\n\nDobby's favourite gift to receive was socks, likely because he was freed from his enslavement to the Malfoys with a sock.[5] He would get confused when he would get two of the same style as he preferred to have two brightly coloured or patterned mismatched socks, and would often give socks as gifts as well.\n\nDobby referred to himself in the third person and tended to get his verb conjugations mixed up. Examples of his strange speech pattern include \"I has seven now sir\"[28] or \"Dobby must punish himself most grievously for coming sir\".[3] Dobby also referred to Ron as Harry's \"Wheezy.\"[9]\n\nHe was extremely devoted to Harry after he freed him in 1993,[5] helping him out on several occasions, ultimately at the cost of his own life.[2] He also tried to help Winky after she was dismissed by Crouch, getting her a job at Hogwarts as well,[7] and looking after her whenever she became drunk on butterbeer.[20]\n\nDobby and Harry Potter had a very strong relationship. Dobby loved and respected him very much to the point where he considered Harry to be his best friend. When Harry first met Dobby, he was a bit confused by the elf's devotion to keeping him safe from harm. Harry was furious when he found out Dobby was intercepting all of his friends' letters to him, and demanded them back while refusing to promise him to stay out of Hogwarts.[3] Throughout the year, when Dobby made attempts to drive Harry away from Hogwarts, causing some rather unpleasant results on the way, Harry made some threats that were never followed through.[8]\n\nNear the end of the 1992–1993 school year, Harry freed Dobby from the slavery of the Malfoy family. Lucius became angry and intended to attack Harry but Dobby protected him by using a defensive spell. Dobby may have realised that he underestimated Harry Potter, when Harry managed to stop Lucius's plot and survive the Chamber of Secrets.[5]\n\nDobby was appointed to work at the kitchen of Hogwarts Castle in the paid service of Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, though even as a free elf, his loyalty always laid foremost with Harry. When Harry visited the kitchens and therefore Dobby, Dobby hugged him so tightly that Harry felt as though his ribs might crack. Dobby also asked if it would be alright if he visited Harry from time-to-time, with Harry responding with an of course.[7] Dobby visited Harry on Christmas day and presented him with a present, socks and when Harry tried them on Dobby's eyes misted with tears.[28] In 1994, Dobby also provided Harry with Gillyweed for the second task of the Triwizard Tournament.[9]\n\nIn 1995, Dobby told Harry about the Room of Requirement and how to get inside. It is a secret room inside Hogwarts castle and cannot be seen even on the Marauder's Map. Harry and his friends used the room in Dumbledore's Army's meetings and practises.[10] When Marietta Edgecombe betrayed Dumbledore's Army to Professor Umbridge, Dobby immediately warned Harry that the Inquisitorial Squad was going to attack, even though the house-elves had been forbidden to tell anyone, as he was far more loyal to Harry Potter than to Umbridge or Hogwarts in general. When he heard, Harry ordered Dobby not to punish himself for disobeying a direct order from Umbridge.[11]\n\nIn 1996, Dobby had a fight with another house-elf, Kreacher after Kreacher insulted Harry.[12] In 1998, when Harry, Ron, Hermione, Luna, Dean Thomas, Mr Garrick Ollivander and the goblin Griphook were captured and taken hostage at the Malfoy Manor, Dobby Apparated there to rescue them. As they attempted to Disapparate to Shell Cottage, Bellatrix Lestrange threw her silver dagger, mortally wounding Dobby in the chest.[2] Arriving at Shell Cottage, the house of the newly-wed Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour, Harry discovered Dobby's wound and cried out for help as Dobby died in Harry's arms, leaving Harry devastated. He dug a grave without using magic and held a small funeral for Dobby in the garden of Shell Cottage. Dobby's epitaph read \"HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF\".[22]\n\nDobby was the house-elf of the Malfoy family.[5] Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco Malfoy treated Dobby cruelly and were very sadistic to him.[3] He frequently had to punish himself and received death threats several times a day.[8] Dobby feared them, but did everything they ordered him to. In 1993, Harry Potter freed Dobby by tricking Lucius into unknowingly giving Dobby a sock. Lucius became angry and attempted to attack Harry, but Dobby blasted him down a flight of stairs and forcefully told him to leave, with Dobby finally getting revenge on his former cruel master.[5]\n\nThe last time Lucius and his family saw Dobby was in 1998, when Dobby came to Malfoy Manor to rescue Harry Potter and his friends. Dobby was eventually killed by Bellatrix Lestrange.[2] It is unknown how the Malfoys reacted when they learned of it.\n\nDobby first met Ron Weasley in 1994 in the Hogwarts kitchens, where Dobby worked. When Dobby talked with Harry and Ron about his life as a free elf, Ron started to like Dobby, and offered him a maroon sweater his mother had made, making the house-elf excited.[7] When Ron was used as a \"hostage\" for the Triwizard Tournament, Dobby who had learned of the Second Task from the fake Mad-Eye Moody, became fearful of Harry losing his \"Wheezy\" (Dobby's name for Ron) to the merpeople and was manipulated by the fake Moody into stealing Gillyweed for Harry.[9][21]\n\nRon and Dobby met again three years later, in 1997, when both Harry and Ron were at the hospital wing; Harry wanted Dobby to spy on Draco Malfoy because he believed he was a Death Eater. However, Ron didn't agree with this.[12] In 1998, Harry, Ron, Hermione Granger and others were imprisoned at Malfoy Manor and Dobby came for their rescue. However, he was killed during the battle by Bellatrix Lestrange.[2] Ron then respected Dobby very much and thanked him for saving his life. He also gave Dobby his shoes and socks to be buried in.[22]\n\nHis death seemed to finally drive home to Ron the sorry life that house-elves lived, as during the Battle of Hogwarts, Ron voiced the opinion that they should evacuate the house-elves, or else risk another death like Dobby's. Dobby, as an inadvertent result, thus helped Ron and Hermione begin their relationship. Overcome by his thoughtfulness towards elves, Hermione kissed Ron for the first time.[30]\n\nHermione Granger also met Dobby for the first time at the Hogwarts kitchens, where the latter worked. Hermione appeared to like Dobby, because he loved his freedom and because he wanted to make the other house-elves want freedom too.[7] During her fifth year at Hogwarts, Hermione spent most of her time making clothes and hiding them in many places of the Gryffindor Common Tower. However, the house-elves stopped cleaning those places once they found the first of the clothes, as they didn't want to take them. Thus, Dobby cleaned Gryffindor Tower by himself, taking and wearing all of Hermione's knitted clothes.[10]\n\nDobby and Hermione didn't meet again until 1997, when Harry had sent Dobby to spy on Draco Malfoy. When Dobby came to the Malfoy Manor to rescue them, Hermione was being tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange. Dobby then brought them to Shell Cottage but was killed by Bellatrix by her throwing a knife and stabbing Dobby during the Apparition.[2]\n\nDobby was first seen with Winky, a female house-elf, in 1994. Earlier that same year, Harry had mistaken Winky for Dobby at the Quidditch World Cup. Winky excitedly told Harry that she knew Dobby, too; they evidently were friends previous to 1994 even though their relationship was only first displayed that year. It is likely that they met in the company of their masters, as Winky's master Barty Crouch was a high-ranking ministry official and Dobby's former masters the Malfoy family were well-connected and influential socialites.[19]\n\nUnlike Dobby, who loved his freedom, Winky was depressed and thought she was useless. When Dobby expressed his opinion that his life as a free elf was better than as a servant, he made her believe that he was a \"bad house-elf\". So, Dobby tried in vain to convince her that she could live without serving the Crouch family by finding them both jobs at Hogwarts.[7] It is known that Winky eventually managed to get over the fact that she was fired, although Dobby had died by then. He was remembered by her as a good friend whom she missed over a decade later, even though Winky still considered him a bad elf due to his beliefs on freedom.[25]\n\nDobby presumably met Kreacher, another house-elf, in late 1996 when Harry sent Kreacher to work in the kitchens of Hogwarts, and they did not have a good relationship. Firstly, Kreacher strongly disliked Harry because he was a friend of many Muggle-borns and “blood-traitors\" and because Harry initially wasn't very nice to Kreacher. Dobby loved and respected Harry very much for a variety of reasons; these differing viewpoints on Dobby's hero/best friend was mostly the reason why the two house-elves often fought with each other.[12]\n\nIn 1996, they fought in the hospital wing because Kreacher had badmouthed Harry. Harry attempted to make them stop, but then Peeves appeared and encouraged them to hit each other. During the scuffle, Dobby managed to hit Kreacher in the mouth hard enough to knock out half his teeth – it is unknown how Kreacher grew them back or if he ever did. Furthermore, Harry told both Dobby and Kreacher to go and spy on Draco Malfoy; even then, they argued: When they reappeared to give a report, Dobby was angry that Kreacher hadn't informed him that he was going to Harry. Dobby didn't want it to seem like he hadn't been helping, as Kreacher was trying to make it out.[31]\n\nHowever, Kreacher later started to respect Harry and be less prejudiced in general. It is possible that, since Kreacher had contact with the Hogwarts kitchen house-elves, he had contact with Dobby, too, and their common ground caused a release of the bad blood, but it is unknown. Dobby might not have learned about Kreacher's change before he was killed in 1998. Kreacher looked like Dobby in appearance, but was angry and antagonistic in character.\n\nDobby started his work at the Hogwarts Kitchens in 1994, a year after he was freed by Harry Potter. He loved his life as a free elf, something that the other house-elves who worked at the kitchens did not. They believed Dobby was mad and there was a great difference between their ideology and Dobby's, about a house-elf's life.[7] Thus, he didn't have such a good relationship with his co-workers, as they believed that a house-elf should not have any personal life when they had to work and serve their masters.[7][10]\n\nHowever, their opinion about Dobby might have changed during their later years at Hogwarts. During the Battle of Hogwarts all the house-elves, with Kreacher as a leader, fought against the Death Eaters, without anyone ordering them to do so.[24] This indicates that they learned a house-elf can have a personal opinion, and that they should have as many rights as the humans. Unfortunately, Dobby had died by then.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore, the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was considered by many people (including Dobby) as the greatest wizard of all time. Dobby always admired Dumbledore, because he was kind to everyone, even to the house-elves, as well as how he opposed Lord Voldemort and was against things such as forced labour, cruelty and making someone do something against their will, which Dobby had suffered from all his time working for the Malfoys.[7] Dumbledore met Dobby in 1993, when he was still the servant of the Malfoy family.[5] In 1994, Dobby asked Dumbledore for a job at the Hogwarts kitchens and the headmaster gave him the job, offering a much higher salary than Dobby expected and gaining the house-elf's respect, but Dobby refused and requested a much lower wage and much less time off, as he still bore some nature of a house-elf, such as valuing work, finding the idea of so much money and free time either repulsive or frightening.\n\nHe also permitted Dobby to call him as he wanted (such as \"a barmy old codger\"). Dobby was very fond of Dumbledore and knew he would never insult him, but he was awed by Dumbledore's gift of freedom of speech.[7] When Dumbledore died in 1997, it is unknown how Dobby reacted, or whether he attended his funeral, but he was likely very upset by his death and would remember him as the best and kindest \"master\", for lack of a better term (really more as a boss/supervisor than master, but House Elves referred to those as masters) he had and would ever have.\n\nOver the course of his employment at Hogwarts, Dobby became close friends with Aberforth Dumbledore, and spent much time at Aberforth's home in Hogsmeade, getting to and from the school through a secret tunnel. As Aberforth was an old and grumpy person, he didn't have a good relationship with many people. Despite this, however, Dobby offered him friendship and someone to talk too.\n\nIn 1998, Harry Potter and his friends were captured by Snatchers and imprisoned at the Malfoy Manor cellar. Harry asked for help while looking at a two-way mirror; Aberforth had the other mirror, and sent Dobby to rescue them; the house-elf did so, stating that \"he would always be there for Harry Potter\", but was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange. After learning of this, Aberforth told Harry, Ron and Hermione that he was really sorry, stating that he had liked Dobby.[13]\n\nIn 1998, Dobby saved Luna Lovegood, along with Garrick Ollivander and Griphook, from Malfoy Manor.[2] She attended his funeral later at Shell Cottage, where she expressed much gratitude for him saving her life.[22]\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, a \"dobby\" is an old English word for a benevolent elf that would perform household tasks secretly in the night, like the elves in tales of the elves and the shoemaker. However, just as those elves disappeared when the shoemaker made them shoes, so the dobbies were said to disappear when offered clothing. Also called a Brownie. A dobby is also a small mechanical part in a loom that enables the weaver to create small geometric patterns.",
