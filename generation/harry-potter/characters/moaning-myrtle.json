  "content": "Myrtle Elizabeth Warren[10] (c. 1929[1] – June 1943),[3] more commonly known after her death as Moaning Myrtle, was a Muggle-born witch who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1940 to 1943 and was Sorted into Ravenclaw house.\n\nShe was killed in 1943 by the Serpent of Slytherin, which had been released by Tom Riddle. After the incident, she became a ghost who haunted the second-floor girls' bathroom (and occasionally other bathroom facilities) at Hogwarts.[7]\n\nMyrtle was a witch born circa late 1928 to early 1929[1] to a Muggle mother and father, making her a Muggle-born.[8] As a ghost, she fondly remembered singing Christmas carols with her family during Christmas.[11]\n\nShe started her education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1939 or 1940.[1] When she arrived at Hogwarts, she was Sorted into the house of Ravenclaw.[9] While at Hogwarts she felt that no one missed her[12] and was constantly teased and bullied because of this and her physical appearance, which included glasses and acne.[13]\n\nIn the 1942–1943 school year, sometime into Myrtle's education, the Chamber of Secrets was opened for the first time,[8] which was a legendary chamber built by Salazar Slytherin and inside was a beast that only his heir could control.[13]\n\nIt was believed that Gryffindor student, Rubeus Hagrid had opened the Chamber because he was caught raising Aragog (an Acromantula), but it was actually Tom Marvolo Riddle, a Slytherin student. Hogwarts was soon facing closure as Muggle-born students were being mysteriously attacked by the mythical beast thought to be down inside the Chamber.[8]\n\nOn her final day of her life in early June 1943, at the end of the school year, Myrtle was teased by student Olive Hornby, who made fun of Myrtle's glasses and left Myrtle alone sobbing. Myrtle then ran into one of the bathroom's stalls and started crying. Shortly after Myrtle had entered the bathroom, Tom Riddle entered and started speaking in Parseltongue in order to open the Chamber of Secrets, the entrance of which was hidden behind the sink in front of the very stall occupied by Myrtle at the time. The Serpent of Slytherin (a Basilisk) then emerged from the entrance to the chamber. The monster had been using the pipes as a means of transportation, as to not be seen and therefore never being caught.[4]\n\nMyrtle, still in one of the stalls, recognised the voice as being that of a boy. Opening the stall's door, she was about to yell at Riddle to go away, when the Basilisk stared at Myrtle and her eyes met with the monster's. Since looking into a Basilisk's eyes is a fatal act, Myrtle was killed instantly and her body fell to the bathroom floor, becoming Tom's first victim.[4] Tom (later known as Lord Voldemort) used her murder to make his first Horcrux: the Diary.[14] Myrtle's body was later found by Hornby, something that Hornby would not soon forget.[12]\n\nMyrtle's body was removed from the school after its discovery. After her death, Myrtle returned as a ghost so she could haunt Olive Hornby in revenge for her bullying. Myrtle attended the wedding of Olive's brother uninvited, where she apparently caused a massive scene to remind Olive of how she bullied her, causing a huge mess. Olive went to the Ministry of Magic to restrain Myrtle, who was thereafter obliged to remain at Hogwarts Castle.[12]\n\nEver since, Myrtle haunted the bathroom where she had died, although she was sometimes seen in other bathrooms, and was even flushed into the lake occasionally. As a result of her haunting, her lavatory grave was rarely used, and was thus available for clandestine activities, such as forbidden potion-brewing, as long as one did not mind her company.[15]\n\nBefore 31 October in 1985, Jacob's sibling and Penny Haywood came to Myrtle's bathroom to invite her to Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's 493rd Deathday Party on behalf of Sir Nicholas himself. Before Jacob's sibling could finish their sentence, however, Myrtle, thinking they were just another one of the bullies that would tease her around this time of the year, asked them to leave. After they cleared it up, Myrtle became delighted, having been told that Deathday Parties were fun.\n\nShe admitted she had never been invited to one before since she thought none of the other ghosts wanted her there, but Jacob's sibling pointed out that Sir Nicholas genuinely wanted her to attend this time. She listened to the students explaining the details of the party, and was convinced that she wanted to attend, but thought she needed someone to accompany her because of her shyness. Jacob's sibling said she was allowed to bring a guest, and Myrtle immediately chose Jacob's sibling and Penny Haywood as a thank you for making the effort to invite her.[16]\n\nShortly before the party would start, Jacob's sibling came to pick Myrtle up, but they were informed by Myrtle that she changed her mind and was not going. Nevertheless, after Jacob's sibling gave some encouragement, she was ready to go. They headed towards the Deathday Party Hall and met Sir Nicholas outside in the corridor, who was surprised to see Myrtle. He asked to speak with Jacob's sibling alone, so Myrtle departed.[16]\n\nDuring the party, Myrtle found Jacob's sibling speaking with Professor Sprout. Eager to dance with them, she asked Sprout if she was finished with them, and upon realising that she had taken up enough of Jacob's sibling's evening, Sprout left them with Myrtle. They had a dance in the middle of the dancefloor.[16] They could be seen waltzing by other party quests.\n\nOn 31 October 1992, Myrtle was again invited to Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's Deathday Party, this time being his five-hundredth deathday. During the event, Myrtle was called by Peeves to meet Hermione Granger, who had previously talked about how awful it was to go to the bathroom that she resided in. She believed Hermione was making fun of her and started crying, and when she tried to say nice things about her, Myrtle's crying turned hysterical and she demanded Hermione not to lie to her. At this moment, however, Peeves also angered her with his comment of her being 'spotty', and she fled the room with Peeves pelting mouldy peanuts after her.[7]\n\nThe true importance of Myrtle's bathroom was that it contained the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets, the home of the Basilisk of Salazar Slytherin. In the 1992–1993 school year, the chamber was opened again, fifty years after its previous opening, by a Gryffindor first-year, Ginny Weasley, who was possessed by the diary of the earlier opener, Tom Riddle.[17] After Mrs Norris was Petrified by the Basilisk just outside Myrtle's bathroom, Hermione came with Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley to investigate. Myrtle said she wasn't paying attention at the time due to wanting to kill herself because of Peeves's snarky comment earlier.[13] Myrtle later flooded her bathroom in a fit of pique when Ginny tried to dispose of the diary by flushing it down the toilet in Myrtle's stall.[8]\n\nHermione used Myrtle's bathroom in 1992 to brew Polyjuice Potion, which Harry and Ron used to impersonate Slytherin students Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe.[15] Thus disguised, they entered the Slytherin common room to interrogate Draco Malfoy about the Chamber of Secrets. They learned only that, according to Draco's father Lucius Malfoy, the last time the chamber was open a Mudblood was killed (and that, contrary to their suspicions, Draco was not the Heir of Slytherin).[5]\n\nHarry and Ron later learned from Aragog the Acromantula that the murdered student had been killed in a bathroom, and Harry realised that the student must have been Myrtle.[18] Myrtle was flattered by Harry's request that she tell the story of her death, the manner of which was one of the most important and interesting events of her short life.\n\nMyrtle remembered only having seen a pair of enormous yellow eyes, but neither Harry nor Ron recognised this as a clue that the monster was a Basilisk. Hermione had already deduced the monster's nature by library research before she was Petrified, so Myrtle's clue was of no practical importance. However, her presence in the bathroom, combined with Hermione's clue about the Basilisk's use of pipes, did single the bathroom out as the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.[4] Not long after, Harry killed the Basilisk using Godric Gryffindor's sword, avenging Myrtle's death.\n\nDuring the 1994–1995 school year, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry hosted the Triwizard Tournament. Before the second task, the champions had to solve the mystery behind their golden eggs, which, when opened, emitted a harsh screeching sound. The secret was that the noise became speech when heard underwater.\n\nOne champion, Cedric Diggory, decided to meditate upon the clue in the Prefects' Bathroom. Myrtle spied on Cedric in the tub, admitting to Harry that it took Cedric a long time to figure it out; nearly all the bubbles in the bath were gone by the time he cracked it. Cedric later suggested to Harry Potter that he take his egg to the Prefects' Bathroom. With Myrtle's hints, Harry was able to decipher the riddle.[12]\n\nMyrtle also appeared to Harry whilst he was in the Black Lake. She pointed him in the right direction to find the village of the Merpeople, thereby helping him to reach the Tournament hostages before the other champions.[19]\n\nIn 1997, Harry and Ron encountered Myrtle in the boy's bathroom as they were talking. Myrtle expressed her unhappiness at Harry never coming to see her. Myrtle told them that another boy also came to the bathroom crying and alone (Draco Malfoy), but she refused to tell either of them his identity when they asked her, as she had promised to keep Draco's secrets.[20]\n\nLater on, Draco Malfoy confided in Moaning Myrtle about his failed attempts to assassinate Albus Dumbledore. Myrtle comforted him, feeling that she understood him, though in fact his situation was nothing like hers. When Draco and Harry engaged in a violent duel, Myrtle, as usual, enjoyed the spectacle. The last time Myrtle was seen by Harry Potter was when she was ordered to leave the bathroom by Severus Snape.[21]\n\nOn 31 October 2009, Myrtle was invited to Sir Nicholas's 517th Deathday Party. She talked with an unidentified student there, who asked if it was okay for them to visit her some time.[22]\n\nIn a different year, Myrtle attended another Hallowe'en ball with other ghosts. She noticed Simon Talmadge,[23] whom she had never met before and considered handsome, and thought about saying hello to him.[24]\n\nAt another occasion, the same student noticed that Myrtle was crying and moaning more than usual, and on that day, they visited her in the bathroom. She told them that Peeves recently threw a pudding at her, but noted that no one would care, not even the person she was speaking to, at least not since Draco Malfoy left. She recalled them confiding in each other about everything when he was in school, such as when he told her that he felt like everyone was viewing him as a failure, and she responded that he would need to prove them wrong, and if he couldn't do it, he was welcome to hide with her in the bathroom. Intrigued, the student stayed and listened to more stories about Myrtle and Draco.[25]\n\nDuring the Calamity, Myrtle was interviewed by a Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force. While their discussion did prove useful, it was deeply uncomfortable for the investigator, as Myrtle yelled at them, backed up two toilets, and then left in a huff. Although the investigator believed that Myrtle had done a \"lifetime of emotional damage\" to them, they left with a clearer understanding of her lonely world.[26]\n\nDuring a Calamity surge focused on Harry Potter's memories of the 1994–1995 Triwizard Tournament in January and February 2021, Myrtle became a Foundable, being trapped in a large bell jar Confoundable. Calamity Investigators working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force were able to rescue Myrtle's Foundable using the Bombardment Spell and return her to her original time. However, despite claiming that she had took all the necessary precautions before doing so, one of these investigators was secretly witnessed freeing Myrtle's Foundable by the Muggle reporter Brice Badeaux, who photographed and published an exposé on the event, threatening the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.[27]\n\nIn 2020 in an alternate reality created when interference from Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy resulted in Cedric Diggory badly losing the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament, the two sought a way to reach Hogwarts's Great Lake, unsatisfied with the changes they had made. They hoped to interfere with Diggory in the Second Task as well, but in order to do so, needed a means to reach the grounds. They realised that they could do so from the pipes in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.\n\nUpon seeing them, Myrtle said it had been a while since there had been boys in her bathroom, but noted that she had a soft spot for Potters and was once partial to a Malfoy as well. As such, she helped them by showing them how they could access a pipe to reach the lake.\n\nAfter they did so, Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, Professor McGonagall and Ginny Weasley arrived in the bathroom. At Harry's request, Myrtle explained to him what the boys had told her about their plans to save the life of Cedric Diggory, noting that she could never keep anything from him. She also described him (Harry) as becoming more handsome as he had aged, and taller as well.[28]\n\nMyrtle was a squat student with pimples and thick glasses. She died in 1943 and became a ghost, wearing her school uniform, as well as her glasses, for eternity.[13]\n\nMyrtle was constantly bullied at Hogwarts, for both her physical appearance and her personality. Myrtle's personality itself was being very sensitive; she hardly ever smiled and took great offence at the smallest slight. She usually cried when she got sad, and when she did, she cried very loudly, hence her nickname Moaning Myrtle.\n\nShe was often upset so badly that she tried to kill herself until she realised that she was already dead.[13] Myrtle did tend to be happy when something bad happened to other students, like when Hermione Granger accidentally gained cat fur, ears and a tail after taking a contaminated Polyjuice Potion.[5] The only time she seemed to enjoy herself was when she recalled the moment of death, describing the event with relish.[4]\n\nShe did, however, seem to warm to some male students, including Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.[21] Myrtle also appeared to be a desperate flirt; she constantly flirted with Harry, and showed her desperation to find love by spying on students such as Cedric Diggory whilst he bathed in the prefects' bathroom.[12] Myrtle was likely childish as well, as she liked to take bubble baths when she was alive, due to 'all those pretty bubbles'.[29]\n\nDuring his education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry was nice to Myrtle, so she developed a crush on him. Harry wasn't exactly known to stay out of life-threatening trouble, so Myrtle offered to share her toilet with him in the event that he died.[30] She also was more than happy to help Harry during his studies at Hogwarts, with any task; during his second year she helped him solve the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets by telling him how she died.[4]\n\nIn his fourth year she helped him solve the mystery of the Triwizard Tournament's second task. During his fourth year Myrtle acted, to an extent, sexually towards Harry, while he bathed in the Prefects' Bathroom, causing him to feel uncomfortable when he did not reciprocate her attraction. She acted coldly to Harry when he had not visited her for a while but still remained friendly towards him.[12][20]\n\nIt was found that despite Harry's departure from Hogwarts, Myrtle continued to have a soft spot for Harry and even commented that she could never have kept anything from him, including secrets. Furthermore, she claimed that he had grown more handsome as he aged and got taller when he visited her in 2020 to save his son.\n\nIt was shown that Myrtle did not like Hermione in the least. At Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday Party, Hermione told Harry and Ron how horrible and whiny Myrtle was. Peeves, who overheard this, called Myrtle over. Peeves told Myrtle that Hermione was talking about her. Myrtle knew she must be talking about her meanly like most students did, Hermione, however, who never wanted to hurt Myrtle's feelings, tried to tell Myrtle how she was only saying how pretty Myrtle was looking tonight. However Myrtle did not buy this and yelled at Hermione for lying to her and left the party crying.[7]\n\nTo brew the Polyjuice Potion Hermione was in Myrtle's bathroom quite a lot as she knew nobody would go there because of Myrtle's presence. Myrtle seemed cold to Hermione, probably because of Hermione talking bad about her at the Deathday Party.[15] Myrtle did take great enjoyment in Hermione being upset though (also probably because of her talking behind her back at the party) when Hermione's potion turned her into a cat. Myrtle teased and laughed at Hermione, only making Hermione feel worse about her cat like appearance. Harry had never seen Myrtle happier than when she was teasing Hermione.[5]\n\nRonald Weasley and Myrtle seemed to not have a very good relationship. Ron was very blunt to her in which she would usually get upset and start to cry. Myrtle was initially unhappy to see Ron when Hermione brought him and Harry into her bathroom to ask her about the Chamber of Secrets after Hallowe'en. Whilst Myrtle was telling them of how she tried to kill herself on Hallowe'en, Ron intercepted by saying that she was already dead, which unintentionally upset her deeply, causing her to dive headfirst into a toilet.[13]\n\nRon also bugged her about keeping a secret for a person (Draco Malfoy) claiming where would she take it to the grave or the sewers.[20] Ron also made a comment saying Nymphadora Tonks was starting to look like Myrtle since her cousin Sirius Black died.[31] This was probably not a compliment to Tonks, as Myrtle always looked sad and angry.\n\nIn the year of the Triwizard Tournament, Cedric Diggory was watched by Myrtle in the Prefects' bathroom on the fifth floor. When Harry took his golden egg into the bathroom to work out its clue, Myrtle talked about Cedric and said that he was 'the handsome one'.[12]\n\nMyrtle also got on well with Draco Malfoy, who was Harry Potter's enemy whilst at Hogwarts. Despite Draco being prejudiced against Muggle-borns and constantly bullying and threatening Hermione Granger for being Muggle-born, the two managed to become close as both needed company for comfort (although it is possible that he is unaware of her status as a muggle-born prior to her demise).[20][21]\n\nThey became friends whilst she comforted him during his sixth year at Hogwarts; that year Draco had become a Death Eater and was feeling the strains of it as he was required to murder Albus Dumbledore.[21] She described their friendship herself as an intimate one, as they used to confide in each other about everything.[25] He shared his feelings and thoughts with Myrtle, who listened and comforted him.\n\nAlso she seemed to have taken preference of Draco over Harry as Harry never visited Myrtle when she asked him to.[20] When Harry saw the dots representing Draco and Myrtle together in the bathroom on the Marauder's Map, he ended up crashing into something, as he didn't pay attention to where he was walking due to the sight of the unlikely couple he was seeing on the map.[21]\n\nIn 2020, Myrtle was shown to still have a partial soft spot for Draco.\n\nOlive and Myrtle were arch-rivals when they were Hogwarts students.[32] Olive teased Myrtle about her glasses. When Myrtle was crying in the bathroom and then got killed by the Basilisk, it was Olive who first saw her dead body, something Myrtle's ghost took delight in seeing.\n\nMyrtle chose to be a ghost in perpetuity, with the short-term aim of haunting Olive.[32] She stalked her wherever she went, reminding her that it was her fault she was dead and how horrible she was.[4] Myrtle even went so far as to interrupt her brother's wedding, which irritated Olive enough to inform the Ministry of Magic, who would later demand that Myrtle stay at Hogwarts. Myrtle claimed she didn't let Olive forget her until her dying day.[12]\n\nBoth Peeves and Myrtle resided at the school and were known as bothersome. Myrtle did not like Peeves, who took enjoyment in bothering her as he did to everyone. At Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday Party both Peeves and Myrtle attended, when Peeves heard Hermione Granger complaining about Myrtle he found it as the perfect time to cause trouble. Peeves called Myrtle over, who did not look happy to see him, but Peeves informed her that Hermione was talking about her.\n\nMyrtle, assuming she was talking meanly about her behind her back ran off crying; Peeves seemed to enjoy her pain and began pelting her with peanuts.[7] Myrtle later told Harry, Ron, and Hermione that Peeves made her so upset she wanted to kill herself, but of course, this was impossible as she was already dead.[13]\n\nMyrtle's relationship with Nick is unknown, though he did invite her to his Deathday Party at least thrice.[16][22] Nick probably invited her because either he liked her, felt bad for her or because she was also a ghost.[7] Nick and Myrtle seemed not to have the same point of view on death. Nick, of course, celebrated it, while Myrtle was highly offended and touchy about it, although she sometimes liked to talk about it at length.[4]",
