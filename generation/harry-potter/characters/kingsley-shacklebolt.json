  "content": "Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt was a British pure-blood wizard[2] in the employment of the Ministry of Magic. He worked for the Ministry as an Auror, but joined the reconstituted Order of the Phoenix in 1995 after being convinced of the return of Lord Voldemort. Working undercover within the Ministry, he fed the Order with information, and misdirected the Ministry's efforts to locate Sirius Black by saying he was spotted in Tibet.\n\nIn 1996, he fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, and was later assigned to guard the Muggle Prime Minister, posing as his secretary. Forced into running away following the fall of the Ministry to Lord Voldemort in 1997, Kingsley continued to oppose the new regime. In 1998, he fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, and was named Acting Minister for Magic in the aftermath.\n\nWhen he was eventually officially confirmed in the position of the thirty-fifth Minister for Magic, he, along with Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, worked hard to change the Ministry. They eventually succeeded in greatly reducing the corruption and pure-blood bias within the organisation. By 2019, Kingsley was succeeded as Minister for Magic by Hermione.\n\nNot much has been revealed about Kingsley's life before becoming an Auror. All that is known is that he was born into a pure-blood wizarding family at a point in 1973 or earlier[1] and that he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in his youth, although it is unknown which House he was sorted into.[2] He also apparently met James Potter, as he saw the physical similarities between him and his son Harry.\n\nDuring the 1986–1987 school year, Kingsley was invited to Hogwarts by Albus Dumbledore, who wanted him to advise students on his life as an Auror, as part of the student club challenge programme, as well as teach them some basic martial magic. He did, however, have another reason for inviting Kingsley. Dumbledore had gotten suspicious that someone was trying to sabotage the student club challenge programme, and so asked Kingsley to additionally investigate the matter and to protect the students should anything happen. A group of Dark wizards had gotten wind that Kingsley was going to be at the programme and decided to use it as an opportunity to assassinate him. Knowing that the area where the demonstration would be held would be protected with an impenetrable Shield Charm, the group, which included the con-man Alistair Fidgen, hid in the stands the night before, ensuring they would be covered by the Shield Charm when it was cast. They used a distraction provided by a Gryffindor Dragon Club member as an opportunity to attack Kingsley. Kingsley was forced to defend himself alongside Jacob's sibling, but eventually managed to capture all his attackers.[7]\n\nIn 1991, he was assigned to stake out Knockturn Alley alongside Nymphadora Tonks in the hopes of capturing a Dark wizard who had stolen a wand formerly belonging to Gellert Grindelwald. At the request of Alastor Moody, Jacob's sibling from the Rare, Obscure, and Confounding Case Division was brought in due to the Auror Office being short-handed. After the Dark wizard was arrested and the wand was sent to a secure vault, Kingsley met up with Jacob's sibling in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, where he offered them some advice on working as an Auror before giving them a badge depicting Grindelwald's wand on behalf of Moody to remind them of their great accomplishments and all those that were still to come.[8]\n\nIn 1995, he was assigned to lead the task force for the recapture of the Azkaban-escapee Sirius Black. When rumour of Lord Voldemort's return was denied by the Ministry, Kingsley was convinced of his return, and subsequently joined the Order of the Phoenix. Along with Nymphadora Tonks, he worked as a covert operative, keeping the Order supplied with information.\n\nIn addition, since joining the reactivated Order, Kingsley was informed of Black's innocence as a fellow member of the Order, and so he sidetracked the investigation by feeding the Ministry disinformation that indicated Black was hiding in Tibet.[5] In the August of 1995, after Harry Potter was attacked by two dementors Kingsley volunteered to be a member of the Advance Guard. The Advance Guard were to escort Harry to the Order's Headquarters at 12 Grimmauld Place in London.\n\nKingsley was also present at many dinners that took place at Grimmauld place. He was also at the Ministry on the day of Harry's hearing to answer the charge of using a Patronus Charm in front of his Muggle cousin, on 12 August, and staged an argument with fellow Order member Arthur Weasley to protect their covers as Rufus Scrimgeour was asking questions. During the argument, he slipped Arthur a copy of The Quibbler containing an article that he thought Sirius would find amusing — an article that claimed Sirius was actually Stubby Boardman. He later attended the party at Grimmauld Place to celebrate Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger's appointment as Prefects.[5]\n\nIn April of 1996, Kingsley accompanied Cornelius Fudge, Auror John Dawlish, and Fudge's assistant Percy Weasley to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to confront Albus Dumbledore over Dolores Umbridge's discovery of Dumbledore's Army. Despite his loyalty to the Order, Kingsley was forced to play along with the Minister, although he was able to place a Memory Charm on Marietta Edgecombe to stop her divulging any more secrets regarding Dumbledore's Army, and to agree with Dumbledore's version of events; upon Umbridge attacking Marietta for her sudden change in testimony, Kingsley stood forward to warn Dolores. During Dumbledore's escape, Kingsley was incapacitated along with the Minister, Dawlish and Umbridge to maintain his cover, an action that Albus regretted but deemed necessary.[5]\n\nOn 18 June 1996, Harry was duped into going to the Department of Mysteries on the pretence that Sirius Black was being held captive. Kingsley, along with Nymphadora Tonks, Alastor Moody, Remus Lupin, and Sirius Black, travelled to the Ministry to rescue Harry and several of his friends after being informed about this by Severus Snape.\n\nIn the ensuing battle in the Death Chamber, Kingsley began duelling two Death Eaters at once, then faced Augustus Rookwood. Late in the battle, Kingsley duelled with Bellatrix Lestrange just after she had sent Sirius through the Veil. Kingsley was injured in the duel, falling to the ground with a scream, but recovered from his injuries.[5]\n\nWith the return of Lord Voldemort now publicly acknowledged, Rufus Scrimgeour replaced Cornelius Fudge as Minister for Magic. Fudge was overthrown by the outraged wizarding public after they learned the truth. Following the unsuccessful attempt to place the Imperius Curse on Muggle Junior Minister Herbert Chorley, it was decided that the Muggle Prime Minister needed protection.[6]\n\nIn 1996 Kingsley was assigned to the Prime Minister as a bodyguard, posing as his new secretary. Kingsley's portrayal of a Muggle convinced the Prime Minister, who was shocked to learn the truth from Scrimgeour several days later. The Prime Minister considered him an excellent secretary, capable of doing twice the work of his predecessor.[6] Despite his assignment to the Muggle Prime Minister, Kingsley did attend the funeral of Albus Dumbledore in July 1997.[6]\n\nWith Dumbledore's death, and the Second Wizarding War in full swing, the Order's attention turned to protecting Harry Potter. With the protection he had at the 4 Privet Drive due to expire on his seventeenth birthday, a plan was formed to break the protection early and escort him to safety at the Burrow. Although still assigned to protect the Muggle Prime Minister, Kingsley was chosen to speak with the Dursleys, as his ability to act and dress like a Muggle would offend them less, and he informed them that they too would have to go into hiding for their protection.[4]\n\nOn 27 July, Kingsley was part of the Order task force sent to escort Harry to safety. Acting as a protector, he rode a Thestral with Hermione Granger disguised as Harry by way of the Polyjuice Potion. During the subsequent battle, Kingsley and Hermione were chased by five Death Eaters, injuring two and possibly killing one. They were also briefly chased by Lord Voldemort himself after he murdered Alastor Moody, but he broke off the pursuit once the real Harry was located. His house was one of a dozen safe houses used to confuse the Death Eaters, so that they would be less likely to figure out the real destination to which Harry was being spirited away.[4]\n\nKingsley and Hermione finally made it back to the Burrow, and Kingsley believed that their plan had been betrayed, challenging Remus Lupin with a personal question to ensure his identity. Satisfied, he relayed his news — including the fact that Lord Voldemort could fly unaided — to the rest of the Order that had returned, and waited anxiously for the others. Eventually, though, Kingsley was forced to leave the Burrow and return to his duty guarding the Prime Minister.[4] He was unable to help Remus and Bill search for Mad-Eye's body, as he needed to report back to the Ministry straight away.\n\nOn 1 August, 1997, the Ministry of Magic fell to Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Where Kingsley was on that day, either at the Ministry or still guarding the Prime Minister, is unknown. However, he was aware of the events, and sent his lynx Patronus to the Burrow to warn the guests at Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding of what had occurred. His warning allowed Harry, Hermione, and Ron Weasley to escape the reception without notice.[4]\n\nShortly after the death of Rufus Scrimgeour, the Aurors were also decommissioned, and many of Kingsley's colleagues were stripped of their wands and jobs.[9] Kingsley himself, however, who was a known member of the Order of the Phoenix, was allowed to continue to work for the Ministry in some capacity. However, he was forced on the run after he broke the Taboo about saying Lord Voldemort's name, and had to fight off several Death Eaters. He went into hiding, but remained active in the resistance effort, contributing to the Potterwatch radio broadcast under the alias of Royal, urging Wizards to help protect Muggle neighbours and to keep faith during dark times.[4]\n\nIn May of 1998, Kingsley was alerted to the coming battle at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Apparated to the Hog's Head, and travelled to the school through the secret tunnel joining it to the Room of Requirement. Arriving in the Great Hall, he consulted with Minerva McGonagall and took charge of the situation, dividing the available fighters into groups and assigning them to defend certain areas of the school.\n\nHe, along with Arthur Weasley and Remus Lupin, led groups of fighters into the school grounds to intercept the enemy.[4] Shortly before the Acromantula entered Hogwarts, Kingsley duelled a masked Death Eater while Flitwick duelled Yaxley beside him. Remus was last seen battling Dolohov. Kingsley also fended off Dementors after they entered the battle having allied with Lord Voldemort and his army.\n\nTowards the end of the battle, after Lord Voldemort displayed an apparently dead Harry to the defenders of the castle and Neville Longbottom had slayed Nagini, Kingsley, along with Minerva McGonagall and Horace Slughorn, duelled Voldemort in the Great Hall. After Molly Weasley killed Bellatrix Lestrange, Voldemort screamed in rage and blasted all three of them backwards. When Voldemort attempted to kill Molly, Harry cast a Shield Charm then revealed himself, took up the battle, and killed Voldemort for good. In the aftermath of the battle, Kingsley was named as acting Minister for Magic.[4]\n\nKingsley was eventually appointed as the permanent Minister for Magic and served in the role for roughly two decades, working to eliminate corruption and discrimination within the Ministry. He banned the use of Dementors to guard Azkaban, and made sure they would not be used to torment the opponents of the Ministry. He appointed Harry Potter as the head of the Auror Department, and made Percy Weasley a high-ranking official, reshuffling the Ministry thoroughly and becoming instrumental in the repairs of the wizarding world following Voldemort's reign of terror. He managed to revolutionise the way that the Ministry worked, and with the assistance of Hermione Granger, eradicated the pro-pureblood laws.[10]\n\nMathilda Grimblehawk wrote a letter to him in 2018.[11]\n\nWhen a sudden outbreak of a piece of chaotic magic cut through all of time, space and memory in June 2019 and began whisking away artefacts, creatures, people, and even memories to mysteriously appear in the Muggle world, Kingsley, who was still Minister for Magic at the time, entered a partnership with the International Confederation of Wizards and worked with said organisation to establish an International Task Force tasked with counteracting the surges of magical activity.[12]\n\nHe also set up a new office in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, whom he charged with the task of monitoring the Calamity and report any new surges to the Statute of Secrecy Task Force.[12] Kingsley was also credited with modifying Dark Detectors to help the Calamity Investigators in tracking traces of the Calamity.[13] He also helped instruct members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force who pursued an Auror career on focusing their mind, to help improve their skills in addressing said event.[14]\n\nKingsley was replaced as Minister for Magic by the end of 2019 by Hermione Granger.[15]\n\nIn the 2010–2011 school year, he purchased a Bloom For You plant from Bewildering Blooms, causing him to be affected by the Mysterious Malady. He was later awoken from the malady after the Bewildering Blooms owner Yubert Thorne was imprisoned in Azkaban.[16]\n\nDuring a Calamity surge focused on the Statute of Secrecy Task Force in June 2020, Kingsley became a Foundable, with Calamity Investigators working for the task force helping to return him to his proper time. When his Foundable was returned, Kingsley suddenly developed a memory of Grim Fawley telling him that he had gained the ability to manipulate the Calamity and to \"guide\" the Foundables it stole. Kingsley informed Constance Pickering of this memory when the two ran into each other at the Ministry, with Constance bringing his information to the task force.[13]\n\nKingsley was a tall black wizard and was described as broad shouldered. He was bald, and wore a single gold hoop earring. He had a slow, deep voice that was said to be reassuring.[5] In contrast with many other wizards, he was capable of dressing properly as a Muggle, to the point that the Muggle Prime Minister could not tell the difference.[6]\n\nKingsley was calm and controlled, with a deep reassuring voice and commanding stature. Unlike many wizards, Kingsley mastered the knack of dressing and acting like a Muggle, leading to his assignment to guard the Muggle Prime Minister during the Second Wizarding War.[4][6] Kingsley was known to be level-headed, though his calm demeanour belied his incredible power and quiet fury, as seen after the Battle of the Seven Potters, when he displayed his rarely witnessed temper when interrogating Remus Lupin in order to make sure it was him. This impressive example of his control over his very justifiable suspicions and anger were likely exacerbated by Mad Eye Moody's death at Voldemort's hands. This also showed Kingsley's respect of the legendary Auror.[4]\n\nKingsley was also a good judge of character, and trusted individuals regardless of age, on the basis of his knowledge of their character and abilities. He trusted Fred and George Weasley with the defence of the secret passages during the Battle of Hogwarts,[4] and allowed Harry Potter into the Auror Department at the age of seventeen.[17] When the corrupt Ministry was deeming Harry and Dumbledore as crackpots for claiming Voldemort's return, Kingsley instead sided with the Order of the Phoenix as he could see the sincerity in Harry's and Dumbledore's statements, and even believed that Sirius was innocent, to the point of misleading the hunting squad to a faraway location.[5]\n\nThe opposite of the pure-blood advocates, Kingsley believed in equality and fairness for all wizards and Muggles. He was also brave enough to call Voldemort by his name, though this resulted in him getting discovered by a group of Death Eaters.[4]\n\nAlthough a faithful and devoted individual, Kingsley was not a blindly loyal man, as he acted on his own judgement instead of waiting for orders (contrary to his colleague John Dawlish), and was not afraid to speak his mind. He joined the Order of the Phoenix despite the Ministry's oppression, swiftly acting to modify Marietta Edgecombe's memories in secret simply by looking at the situation at hand, and stood forward to warn Dolores Umbridge not to manhandle students. At the same time, he was skilled in maintaining a facade to the corrupt Ministry to hide his own agenda from them, such as giving the appearance of devoting himself to hunt down Sirius, or speaking rather condescendingly with Arthur Weasley to appear as if they had no dubious allegations, an act that Arthur returned (though the two would quietly exchange friendly comments in between).[5]\n\nAs a high ranking Auror and eventual leader of the Order of the Phoenix, Kingsley was a very powerful wizard with a well balanced set of abilities. His exceptional skills were looked highly upon by his fellow Order members, including fellow Auror Nymphadora Tonks. Even Lord Voldemort himself seemed to regard Kingsley as a powerful wizard. He was also able to produce a corporeal lynx Patronus, a mark of superior magical ability.\n\nKingsley had a good relationship with all the members of the Order of the Phoenix and their allies, including Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, the Weasley family, Alastor Moody, Nymphadora Tonks, and Albus Dumbledore. Because of his beliefs, Kingsley was highly regarded by most members.\n\nHe also seemed to be a friend of Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. After Sirius was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange, Kingsley fought against Bellatrix, although he was defeated. He also appeared to be on good terms with Elphias Doge, Dedalus Diggle, Emmeline Vance, and Sturgis Podmore, as they were all members of the Advance Guard in 1995. He also supposedly knew James Potter personally, as he mentioned that his son (Harry) looked like James.\n\nSeveral members of the Order were killed during battles. It is unknown how Kingsley reacted when he learned about their deaths. After the Second Wizarding War, Kingsley and the remaining members of the Order likely remained in contact.\n\nAs with the other members of the Order, he originally trusted Severus Snape, who was a Death Eater turned to a double-agent on the Order's behalf. When Snape killed Dumbledore, under Dumbledore's secret request to die peacefully and not let Draco Malfoy damage his soul by being the murderer, Kingsley lost his respect and trust in Snape. After Snape's true allegiance was revealed, this was most likely restored.\n\nBoth \"shackle\" and \"bolt\" refer to means of imprisonment. Specifically, a shacklebolt is the threaded pin of a shackle allowing the linking of multiple chains and metal cables. Bolt might also suggest speed which hints Kingsley's capability of working fast during his tenure as an aide for the prime minister of Great Britain.\n\nHis first name, \"Kingsley\" suggests royalty, note the \"King\" in it. This may be the reason that in Potterwatch he was known as \"Royal\".",
