  "content": "Parvati Patil (b. 1979/1980), was a witch of Indian heritage, daughter of Mr and Mrs Patil, and the identical twin sister of Padma. She was sorted into Gryffindor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, while her sister Padma was sorted into Ravenclaw.\n\nParvati became best friends with Lavender Brown, with whom she shared many interests, such as a love for Divination. Parvati attended the Yule Ball with Harry Potter in 1994, and a year later, she joined Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry.\n\nDuring her seventh year in 1998, she continued her studies at Hogwarts when it was under the control of Lord Voldemort. The same year, Parvati fought in the Battle of Hogwarts against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. It can be assumed that she survived the battle, as her name was not listed among the Fallen Fifty. If she did survive, what she did in her later life is unknown.\n\nParvati was born to Mr and Mrs Patil as one of their twin daughters; the other being Padma.\n\nParvati began attending Hogwarts in 1991 and was sorted into Gryffindor House,[10] while her identical twin sister Padma was sorted into Ravenclaw.[11] Parvati shared her dormitory with Lavender Brown, Hermione Granger and two other girls.\n\nDuring her first flying lesson, Parvati came to the defence of housemate Neville Longbottom when Draco Malfoy threw away his Remembrall. Slytherin student Pansy Parkinson made fun of her for this. Later in the lesson, when Harry Potter made a soft landing after recovering the Remembrall and subsequently found himself caught by Professor Minerva McGonagall, she was quick to tell her that the incident was not Harry's fault. Professor McGonagall told both Parvati and Ron Weasley to be quiet and escorted Harry away.[12]\n\nParvati attended the Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff Quidditch match in their first year and joined an excited Hermione in a hug after Harry's speedy capture of the Golden Snitch.[13] Parvati also told Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom after Ron made fun of her after a Charms class.[14]\n\nIn her second year at Hogwarts, during a History of Magic class, she questioned professor Cuthbert Binns on how the use of dark magic would be needed to open the Chamber of Secrets.[4]\n\nIn her third year, Parvati began taking Divination, which soon became her favourite subject. She and Lavender grew close to Professor Sybill Trelawney, who believed that Parvati could be a Seer one day.[15] During their very first lesson, she alarmed Parvati by telling her to beware a red-haired man, making Parvati suspicious of Ron Weasley.[16]\n\nThat year, when Professor Remus Lupin taught his Defence Against the Dark Arts class about Boggarts, Parvati's greatest fear was revealed to be mummies, although this could be translated as a fear of death or a fear of being buried alive.[8]\n\nEarly in the year, Parvati told Dean Thomas to inform Hermione Granger that Rubeus Hagrid was looking for Harry Potter.[17]\n\nParvati attended the Yule Ball with Harry Potter in 1994. She wore bright pink dress robes and gold bracelets. She seemed to enjoy the attention she received for being the date of a famous wizard and was eager to dance. However, the dance she had with Harry went poorly. After being ignored by Harry, who was romantically interested in Cho Chang at the time and spent much of the ball looking at her, Parvati was asked to dance by and spent most of the evening with a boy from Beauxbatons, whom she dated for a time afterwards.\n\nParvati also enjoyed Care of Magical Creatures classes when they were taught by Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank rather than Rubeus Hagrid, as she felt the former was a better qualified teacher. She enjoyed the lesson on unicorns, as did the rest of the girls in class. After the Yule Ball, both Parvati and Padma acted \"very cool\" towards their dates, Harry and Ron, who had basically ignored them in favour of staring at Cho and Hermione and refused to dance.[11]\n\nAt the end of the year, after the final task of the Triwizard Tournament, Hufflepuff student Cedric Diggory was murdered on Lord Voldemort's orders. Parvati was present for Cedric's memorial feast, along with the rest of the student body. She was seen sitting next to her sister and a boy from the Durmstrang Institute.[11] It is unknown if Parvati initially believed Harry's claim that Voldemort had returned to full power.\n\nThe twins joined Dumbledore's Army in their fifth year, and it seemed their attitudes towards Harry and Ron had somewhat mellowed. During one meeting, Parvati produced such a good Reductor Curse that she reduced a wooden table to dust. She and Lavender were quite upset that year by Dolores Umbridge's treatment of Professor Trelawney, whom Umbridge dismissed. However, Headmaster Albus Dumbledore managed to persuade her to stay living in the castle. Parvati and Lavender were both enamoured with the new Divination professor, Firenze, despite the fact that he was a centaur and thus half-horse.[18]\n\nAlso, during her fifth year, Parvati's rebellious side started to show after becoming a member of Dumbledore's Army.[18] With the help of her sister, Padma, and Harry Potter, Parvati started to sabotage the speakers that Umbridge had placed around the castle in an attempt to silence her with Babbling Beverage, causing the speakers to spout nonsense.[19]\n\nParvati and Lavender practised basic Locomotion Charms by making their pencil-cases race each other around the edge of a table in preparation for the upcoming O.W.L. exam. Her experience in the D.A. likely contributed to Parvati achieving an O.W.L. in Defence Against the Dark Arts. She was also known to have achieved O.W.L.s in Divination and Transfiguration.[18]\n\nIn her sixth year, Parvati had to convince her parents not to take her and her twin sister out of Hogwarts. She was disappointed not to be invited to the Slug Club by new Potions professor Horace Slughorn; in particular, to the party he hosted at Christmas, which she discussed with Hermione Granger.[20]\n\nThat year, Parvati also became slightly dismayed by her best friend, Lavender Brown's, romance with Ron Weasley. Although Parvati initially was supportive of her friend's feelings for Ron, as the two seemed to whisper and giggle about him before they began going out, Parvati was put off. She was also very embarrassed by the almost obsessive degree to which Lavender threw herself into the relationship.\n\nLavender and Ron were often seen snogging in public, and she also started getting possessive when he was with other girls. At one point, Lavender pestered Harry with questions about Ron's feelings for her. As a Christmas present, Lavender gave Ron a gaudy and obtrusive necklace that read \"my sweetheart\". Despite this setback, Parvati and Lavender remained as close as ever.[20]\n\nParvati was not among the DA members who fought when Death Eaters stormed the school on 30 June, as she did not make a habit of carrying her Dumbledore's Army coin with her. Parvati was among the students in the courtyard who raised their wands in tribute to their fallen Headmaster Albus Dumbledore after he met his death at the hands of Severus Snape. Parvati and Padma returned home with their parents the morning after Dumbledore's death at the end of the school year.[20]\n\nIn 1998, Hogwarts was under the control of Lord Voldemort and his followers, with students being brutally punished and taught different subjects, like how to use dark magic instead of defending against it. Sensing the need for rebellion yet again, like there had been when Hogwarts was under the control of Dolores Umbridge, Parvati and her sister Padma both joined the reconstituted Dumbledore's Army, standing up against Death Eater control of Hogwarts.\n\nUnlike the last time trouble brewed, Parvati's parents had not attempted to withdraw her and her sister from school, as it had now become compulsory attendance for pure-blood and half-blood students, which the Patil sisters were likely to be.[21]\n\nIn May, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger returned to Hogwarts after taking the year off to destroy Horcruxes. With Harry's return, Dumbledore's Army was stronger than it had ever been. But with this return, Voldemort and his Death Eaters came looking for Harry. Hogwarts staff and students refused to simply hand Harry over without a fight. Parvati participated in the Battle of Hogwarts, fighting alongside her sister and Dean Thomas.[21]\n\nDuring the Battle of Hogwarts, Parvati duelled with Travers, but helped Dean Thomas by shooting a Full Body-Bind Curse at Antonin Dolohov to prevent him from retaliating against Dean for stunning another Death Eater.[21] It is unknown what happened to her after she incapacitated Dolohov. She was in the Great Hall and witnessed Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort.\n\nParvati was not listed among the casualties, and it can be assumed she survived the Second Wizarding War. After the battle, she most likely kept her D.A. coin as a badge of honour, as did other D.A. members. It can be assumed that she attended the 2014 reunion of Dumbledore's Army.\n\nIn an alternate reality created by Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy's meddling, Parvati became an aunt to Padma and Ron Weasley's son Panju. This was reversed later on.[22]\n\nBoth Parvati and her sister had long black hair, though Parvati usually wore her hair in a plait.[5] Both sisters were usually seen wearing silver necklaces with the letter \"P\" hanging from the chains around their necks and over their ties during their Hogwarts years.\n\nIt seemed to be a confirmed fact that they had matured nicely, for they were once described by Dean Thomas to be the two \"best-looking girls in the year\". When Harry met up with Parvati at the Yule Ball, he also observed that she was truly a very pretty girl, being dressed in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmered at her wrists.[5]\n\nParvati could be seen as the less serious and more outgoing of the Patil twins. Like her friend, Lavender Brown, she enjoyed gossip and fashion, and the two were often seen whispering and giggling together. They also shared a great interest in Divination and were relatively close to Professor Trelawney.[23]\n\nBoth girls could also be insensitive to others at times, a Gryffindor trait according to Ravenclaw prefect Robert Hilliard (albeit a stereotypically negative one). This was exemplified when they pointed and laughed at Luna Lovegood's radish earrings[18] and when she did not hesitate to desert Harry Potter during the Yule Ball, something her sister hypocritically frowned at.[11]\n\nStill, Parvati was loyal to those she considered her friends. She stood up to those who treated her friends poorly, such as when she defended Neville Longbottom against Draco Malfoy's taunts,[24] and comforted Professor Trelawney after Dolores Umbridge fired her.[18] Parvati was also very brave, as her Sorting into Gryffindor House and her participation in the Battle of Hogwarts proved her courage and determination.[21]\n\nPadma Patil was Parvati's twin sister. It's unknown how close the two girls were. although it can be assumed that they were very close, as is the case with most twins. The girls were separated once they began attending Hogwarts, as Parvati was sorted into Gryffindor and Padma into Ravenclaw.\n\nBeing Sorted into separate houses indicated differences in their character, as Parvati appeared to be less serious than her studious sister. This could be observed by the fact that Padma was one of the twelve students who was able to advance to N.E.WT.-level potions while Parvati wasn't.[20] Despite this, they had a few things in common. They were both courageous, as they fought in the Battle of Hogwarts alongside their fellow D.A. members.\n\nLavender Brown was one of Parvati's roommates at Hogwarts and soon became her best friend. The two girls shared many interests, including: Divination, gossip, and fashion, and they were both close to Professor Trelawney.[18] They were also emotional and slightly girly, putting much stock in their physical appearances.\n\nThey were often seen around school together, giggling and whispering. Parvati initially supported Lavender in her infatuation with Ron Weasley in their sixth year, but eventually became slightly dismayed with how intensely Lavender threw herself into the relationship.[20]\n\nParvati was described as being bored and embarrassed by her friend's behaviour, however the two remained close. Sadly, Lavender was killed after being savaged by Fenrir Greyback in the Battle of Hogwarts. It is unknown how Parvati took the news, but it can be assumed she was devastated by the loss of her best friend.\n\nParvati and Lavender were not as close to their other roommate, Hermione Granger, as they were to each other. Hermione did not share the girls' interests, such as Divination and gossip, which occasionally led to conflict. For example, Parvati and Lavender were both offended on Professor Trelawney's behalf when Hermione made her disdain for the class clear in their third year.[23]\n\nThe girls did not seem to have disliked each other too strongly. In 1996, when Hermione was jealous of Lavender dating Ron Weasley, Parvati was noted to feel guilty over having laughed at Ron's cruel teasing of Hermione in Transfiguration, and the two girls discussed Hermione's attendance of the Slug Club Christmas party with Cormac McLaggen. Since Parvati looked \"positively agog\" at Hermione sharing this news with her[20], it can be assumed that Hermione seldom confided in her roommates.\n\nParvati Patil was, like most of her fellow Gryffindor students, friendly with Harry Potter. She defended him when an angry Professor Minerva McGonagall scolded Harry for the incident in their first flying class, doing so before even Ronald Weasley did.[24]\n\nIn her fourth year, when Harry was Triwizard Champion and trying to find a date for the Yule Ball, he mustered the courage to ask Parvati following his rejection by Cho Chang. Parvati blushed furiously at being asked but agreed. Parvati seemed excited by having Harry as a date, though Harry had no romantic interest in her. When asked to dance by a boy from Beauxbatons, she asked Harry whether he minded, but when it became clear Harry's attention was on Cho, she left without another word and was considerably colder to Harry for the rest of the year.[11]\n\nParvati's attitude toward Harry mellowed by the following year, and she gave no indication as to doubting his story of Voldemort's return, unlike her fellow Gryffindors Seamus Finnigan and Lavender Brown. She, her sister, and Lavender all joined Dumbledore's Army that year. Parvati learned well from Harry and mastered the Reductor Curse under his tutelage.[18] She and Padma helped Harry to destroy the speakers Dolores Umbridge set up around school with Babbling Beverage.[19] She and Harry interacted regularly during their O.W.L.s (due to their proximity on the alphabetical roster, they frequently sat near each other).\n\nIn their sixth year, Parvati greeted Harry in a friendly manner and they shared mutual embarrassment at Ron and Lavender's exhibitionist romance.[20] Parvati remained loyal to Harry and Dumbledore's Army, and found herself in hiding during her seventh year, later fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nParvati seemed to have a reasonably close relationship with Divination professor Sybill Trelawney; she had an unwavering faith in the reliability of Trelawney's predictions and was often seen comforting or supporting her when she was experiencing difficult times.\n\nShe and Lavender became offended on the professor's behalf when Hermione made her disdain for Trelawney and the subject she taught clear in 1993. When she was temporarily sacked by Dolores Umbridge, Lavender and Parvati brought Trelawney some nice daffodils. Furthermore, Trelawney had told Parvati that she had the makings of a true seer.\n\nParvati became a member of Dumbledore's Army in her fifth year. It was an organisation founded by Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, and led by Harry, in order to teach students Defence Against the Dark Arts, something that the new professor, Dolores Umbridge, did not, as she believed that the students would use their magic to oppose the Ministry of Magic.\n\nShe was a friend of fellow members Ron Weasley, Dean Thomas, and Seamus Finnigan. Dean and Seamus seemed to believe that Parvati and her sister, Padma, were the best-looking girls of their year. Furthermore, the romance between Ron and Lavender made both Parvati and Harry feel uncomfortable in 1996. She was also a friend of Neville Longbottom and defended him during their first year when Pansy Parkinson insulted him.\n\nOther members of Dumbledore's Army included Fred and George Weasley, Ginny Weasley, Luna Lovegood, Lee Jordan, Angelina Johnson, Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Hannah Abbott, Ernie Macmillan, Susan Bones, Terry Boot, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein, Cho Chang, Michael Corner, Zacharias Smith, and Marietta Edgecombe. Their relationship with Parvati is unknown.",
