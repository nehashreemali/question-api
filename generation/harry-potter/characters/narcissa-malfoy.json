  "content": "Narcissa \"Cissy\" Malfoy (née Black) (b. 1955) was an English pure-blood[3] witch and a member of the noble House of Black. She was the youngest daughter of Cygnus and Druella Black and the younger sister of Bellatrix Lestrange and Andromeda Tonks. She married Lucius Malfoy and they had a son: Draco Malfoy.\n\nAlthough never officially a Death Eater herself, Narcissa believed in the importance of blood purity and supported her husband in following Lord Voldemort during the First and Second Wizarding Wars.[17] This changed, however, when her husband was incarcerated in Azkaban and her son's life was put in jeopardy by Voldemort.\n\nNarcissa took necessary measures to protect her family, including lying to Voldemort about Harry Potter being dead during the Battle of Hogwarts, an act which saved the Malfoys from serving time in Azkaban following the Dark Lord's defeat.[17]\n\nNarcissa survived the final battle of the Second Wizarding War and later had a grandson, Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, through her son's marriage to Astoria Greengrass. However, Narcissa was not too fond of Astoria for her stance on blood tolerance, believing her to be somewhat of a disappointment to the Malfoy lineage.\n\nNarcissa Black was the youngest daughter of Cygnus and Druella Black (née Rosier), born in 1955 in the aristocratic House of Black. She had two older sisters, Bellatrix and Andromeda.[18] Narcissa was taught the philosophy of blood purity from a young age and grew up prejudiced in favour of pure-bloods.[14] Thus, like her sister Bellatrix, she cut off contact with her sister Andromeda after the latter was disowned and burned off the Black family tree for marrying Muggle-born wizard Ted Tonks.[16]\n\nWhen she was younger, her mother, Druella Black, sang her a lullaby which was passed down in the Black family.[19]\n\nNarcissa was educated at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from c. 1966-1973. Sorted into Slytherin House, she met her future husband, Lucius Malfoy, whilst at Hogwarts.[13] Whilst she was at Hogwarts she was very close with her two sisters, and the three were almost inseparable. They shared a keepsake box in which they kept their most prized possessions, with Narcissa keeping the Malfoy family brooch that Lucius had given her when he was courting her in the box.[19]\n\nShe may have been aware of the wanderings of the Marauders, the same group to which her first cousin, Sirius Black, belonged. However, as Sirius was considered a \"blood traitor\" by her family, she likely interacted little or not at all with him, just like her older sister.\n\nNarcissa married Lucius Malfoy, who was just as wealthy and pure-blood-inclined as the Black family Narcissa descended from, between 1972 and September 1979.[20] Together, they lived a life of privilege and luxury at Malfoy Manor, located in the southern English county of Wiltshire.[16] Her husband introduced Narcissa to the lifestyle of the Death Eaters, though she never became a Death Eater herself. The couple had one son, named Draco Lucius. In naming Draco, Narcissa continued her family tradition of naming children after stars and constellations, like her sisters (Bellatrix and Andromeda).\n\nNarcissa's cousin Regulus Black was killed in the First Wizarding War, while her other cousin Sirius and sister Bellatrix were both sentenced to Azkaban after Voldemort's fall in 1981.[14] Lucius was able to avoid a similar fate by falsely claiming that he had been under the effects of the Imperius Curse,[21][22] and the Malfoys remained members of the social elite, enjoying close relationships with Ministry of Magic officials such as Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge[22][23] and Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic Dolores Umbridge.[24] In privacy, however, they regretted the downfall of Voldemort as they saw the purification of the wizarding race to have failed completely, regrets that they told their son not to reveal, lest it would bring their family trouble.\n\nAfter her sister, Andromeda Tonks, opened the keepsake box during the 1986–1987 school year, she sent the brooch inside back to Narcissa.[19]\n\nWhen the time came for Draco Malfoy to begin school in 1991, Lucius Malfoy wanted him to attend Durmstrang Institute, which only admitted pure-blood and half-blood students and taught the Dark Arts, closely mirroring the Malfoy family beliefs. Narcissa, however, insisted that Draco attend Hogwarts instead so he would be closer to home, as Durmstrang was located in northern Europe and Hogwarts was in Britain, where they lived.[25] She was very devoted to Draco, sending him sweets and cakes by owl every day during his first year at Hogwarts.[26][27]\n\nNarcissa attended the 1994 Quidditch World Cup in August 1994 with her husband and son, watching the game from Fudge's luxury box.[4]\n\nIn early 1996, following Lord Voldemort's return to power, her sister Bellatrix and brother-in-law Rodolphus Lestrange escaped Azkaban. Later that year, Lucius participated in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in an attempt to acquire a prophecy for Lord Voldemort.[28] Narcissa was able to provide Voldemort with the information needed to lure Harry there after obtaining it from Kreacher, the Black family house-elf, who gave it to her both because she was a Black by birth and because she treated the attention-starved house-elf more kindly than her cousin Sirius Black, the elf's current master, did.[15]\n\nThe effort was thwarted by six D.A. members and members of the Order of the Phoenix.[28] Voldemort was furious with Lucius, who had led the effort, both for failing to obtain the prophecy and for the consequences of that night,[5] which included the Dark Lord's return being formally recognised by the Ministry of Magic[29] and many of his Death Eaters being sent to Azkaban, including Lucius himself.[30]\n\nThough her sister Bellatrix managed to escape imprisonment, Narcissa was distraught over her husband's incarceration, as well as Voldemort's subsequent treatment of her family. That summer, she ventured to Severus Snape's home at Spinner's End, accompanied by Bellatrix, to discuss Voldemort's orders for Draco to murder Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore.[5]\n\nNarcissa was hysterical and theorised that Draco was being sent on a suicide mission to punish Lucius for his numerous failures. Despite Bellatrix's insistence that Snape was not to be trusted, she begged him to make an Unbreakable Vow, which ensured that he would watch over Draco during his efforts. She also made him vow to execute the plan himself, should Draco fail to do so.[5]\n\nLater that month, Narcissa went shopping for school supplies with Draco at Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, where she had a heated confrontation with Harry Potter and his friends. He taunted her about Lucius's imprisonment, and she responded by coldly alluding to the recent death of his godfather, after which she haughtily departed with her son to Twilfitt and Tattings, as she did not wish to shop at Madam Malkin's anymore.[31]\n\nThroughout the school year, Draco enacted a series of unsuccessful attempts to kill Dumbledore, which eventually resulted in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and Snape's fulfilment of his vow to Narcissa.[32]\n\nBy 1997, Malfoy Manor was being used as a headquarters for Voldemort. A meeting of Lord Voldemort's inner circle was held there, and the murder of Charity Burbage took place in the drawing room. The Malfoys were extremely uncomfortable with the arrangements, despite their claims that nothing would please them more than to host the Dark Lord. When Lord Voldemort asked Lucius for his wand, he showed some hesitance in giving away his only weapon and means of defence; however, when Narcissa grasped his hand under the table, silently persuading him to accede to the Dark Lord, he relented. Lucius's wand was soon broken in the Battle of the Seven Potters.[16]\n\nVoldemort was still displeased with the Malfoys for Lucius's earlier failures and delighted in humiliating them by taunting their relation to werewolf Remus Lupin through Narcissa's niece, Nymphadora Tonks.[16]\n\nWhen Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger were caught by a group of Snatchers led by Greyback, they were brought to Malfoy Manor. Narcissa acted coldly and disdainfully towards Scabior but let them in, where she called on her son to identify the prisoners. She herself recognised Hermione from their encounter a year earlier in Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions.[11]\n\nNarcissa clashed with her sister over who had authority in her home, and therefore over the prisoners held in her cellar: Harry, Ron, Dean Thomas, Griphook, Garrick Ollivander, and Luna Lovegood, the latter two of which had been held there for some time. In the end, all the prisoners escaped: Dean, Luna and Ollivander Disapparating with Dobby the house-elf, while Harry and Ron went to save Hermione from Narcissa's sister, Bellatrix, who had used the Cruciatus Curse to brutally torture her. Later, in the brief duel that followed, Narcissa was shocked to see her family's former house-elf, Dobby, openly defying them. He was eventually murdered by Bellatrix as the group escaped the manor.[11]\n\nAfter Harry and his friends escaped to Shell Cottage, Lord Voldemort severely punished the Malfoy family, but did not act as harsh on Bellatrix.[33] By the time of the Battle of Hogwarts, Narcissa had given her son, Draco, her wand to use in lieu of his own stolen wand, leaving both herself and her husband without their original wands, although the two later obtained second wands by the time of the battle.[34] She was also present when Lord Voldemort interrogated and murdered goblins in a fit of anger after learning of Harry Potter's Gringotts break-in and theft of one of his Horcruxes.[35][12]\n\nTowards the beginning of the battle, Draco lost his mother's wand in the Room of Requirement, leaving it to be incinerated by Vincent Crabbe's Fiendfyre.[34]\n\nDuring the final phase of the Battle of Hogwarts, Voldemort attempted to kill Harry Potter in the Forbidden Forest using the Killing Curse. Voldemort demanded that someone check to see if Harry was, in fact, dead, a deed no one wanted to perform. In the end, he forced Narcissa to check. Seeing that Harry was still alive, she used the opportunity to covertly ask Harry if he knew of Draco's well-being. In a whisper, she asked if Draco was alive. When Harry replied quietly that he was, Narcissa betrayed the Dark Lord and asserted that Harry was dead. After this, all the Death Eaters and people on Voldemort’s side laughed besides Lucius and Narcissa. Despite her family's allegiance to the Dark Lord, she knew the only way to reunite with Draco was as part of Voldemort's conquering army, thus proving she loved her family more than she supported Voldemort.[36]\n\nWhen the battle recommenced, Narcissa and Lucius abandoned the Death Eaters to look for Draco. The family was present for Bellatrix's death at the hands of Molly Weasley, and for Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort, thus ending the Second Wizarding War. After the battle, the family was reunited in the Great Hall, where they seemed uncomfortable with their predicament, but did not leave.[36]\n\nNarcissa's betrayal allowed the entire Malfoy family to avoid incarceration in Azkaban.[17] Narcissa would eventually become a grandmother to Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Draco and his wife Astoria Greengrass.\n\nNarcissa Malfoy was described to be the height of Harry Potter, slim, \"nice-looking\", and very pale, with blue eyes, long blonde hair, and a clear, cold voice. She had thin white fingers.[31][7][8][9][4] Her hair colouring thus differed from most of the House of Black, who generally had dark hair, though Narcissa did possess the arrogant good looks that were a common characteristic of her family. Despite her physical differences to her sisters, Bellatrix and Andromeda, Harry Potter did describe her as resembling Bellatrix somewhat, though Narcissa was as fair as Bellatrix was dark.\n\nNarcissa's beauty was somewhat marred by her donning an expression that suggested that she was sniffing dung whenever she was in the company of those she considered her inferiors.[4] Harry Potter once insulted her son Draco by asking if she only had this expression when Draco was with her.[27]\n\nNarcissa was a very proud woman who frequently displayed a haughty and disdainful attitude, looking down upon others as she believed strongly in the importance of blood purity and valued her family's wealth.[4][31] She was prejudiced towards Muggle-borns, other non-pure-bloods such as Fenrir Greyback,[11] and so-called \"blood traitors\".[31] For example, she once rudely exclaimed to the owner of Madam Malkin's that she would rather shop at Twilfitt and Tattings instead since Madam Malkin's served \"scum\" such as Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley.[31] Despite her beliefs and her family's close ties to Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters, Narcissa never joined the organisation herself, nor received the Dark Mark.\n\nWhile she treated most people coldly,[31] Narcissa was very loving towards her family as well as devoted to them.[5] She was willing to do whatever it took to keep her son safe when he was put in danger during the Second Wizarding War, from begging Severus Snape to take an Unbreakable Vow to help him[5] to lying to Voldemort himself.[36] She cared deeply about her husband and son and displayed a fierce and protective temper on their behalf, as well as a ruthless determination to keep them safe.[5][36] Her devotion to her son was such that she insisted on his attending Hogwarts instead of Durmstrang, despite the latter's reputation for blood purity amongst its students, solely for the sake of keeping him closer to home.[25]\n\nNarcissa had a close relationship with her oldest sister Bellatrix despite their differing temperaments and personality traits.[5] Narcissa's alignment with their family's beliefs led her to ignore and disown \"blood traitors\" such as her older sister Andromeda and cousin Sirius Black.[16]\n\nNarcissa and her husband, Lucius Malfoy, were shown to have an affectionate and loving relationship.[5][16] He gave in to her wishes when she wanted their son to attend Hogwarts, rather than Durmstrang.[25] Lucius also allowed his wife to continue the Black Family naming custom of stars and constellations through their son, showing obvious respect for her family and deference to herself. Narcissa and Lucius both enjoyed being members of the social elite, and loved and spoiled their only child. Unlike Bellatrix, who did not hold love for her husband, Narcissa truly loved Lucius.[5]\n\nNarcissa was very upset when he was briefly imprisoned in Azkaban and became defensive when others mentioned his failures.[5] In 1997, when Lord Voldemort took over their home and demanded that Lucius give him his wand, Lucius seemed fearful, and only when she touched his wrist did he turn it over.[16]\n\nNarcissa adored her only child, Draco, and was very protective of him.[5][31][36] She insisted he not attend the Durmstrang Institute because it was so far from home,[25] and frequently sent him sweet and cake packages during his first year at Hogwarts.[26][27]\n\nNarcissa was terrified to the point of hysteria when Draco was ordered by Lord Voldemort to kill Albus Dumbledore. Narcissa suspected that Voldemort meant him to fail as punishment for her husband's failure in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. To help him, Narcissa went to Severus Snape and begged for his assistance, whereupon she asked of him to make an Unbreakable Vow, making him promise to protect Draco and take over his task if he failed.[5] Later on in the war, she tried to shelter Draco as much as possible. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Narcissa lied to the Dark Lord about Harry Potter's death so she and Lucius would be able to search for Draco in the castle.[36] Draco, in turn, held his mother in great esteem, and became extremely angry if anyone insulted her.[27][31]\n\nNarcissa and her husband Lucius did not think highly of Astoria, as she raised their grandson Scorpius to have a more tolerant view on Muggles (and likely Muggle-borns, half-bloods, Squibs or even non-human magical creatures).\n\nBecause of this, family gatherings were often fraught with tension. It is likely they see Astoria as a blood traitor because of this. Narcissa's relationship with Scorpius is unknown.\n\nNarcissa appeared to have a fairly affectionate and close relationship with her older sister Bellatrix. The two fondly called each other by their nicknames of \"Cissy\" and \"Bella\". Bellatrix accompanied Narcissa to see Snape at Spinner's End, in spite of her distrust for Severus Snape and belief that they should not discuss the task Voldemort assigned in secret.[5]\n\nNarcissa was also one of the only people who was able to question Bellatrix's authority without unleashing Bellatrix's anger.[5][11] The two sometimes clashed over Draco, as Narcissa was concerned about his welfare, while Bellatrix coldly stated her belief that he was doing his duty by serving Voldemort and that Narcissa should be proud.[5]\n\nIt is not known whether Narcissa knew about Bellatrix's daughter from Voldemort, but Delphini was born at Malfoy Manor. If Narcissa did know, then it is possible that she continued to keep this a secret for many years to come, to protect not only her niece but also her own family from any public backlash.\n\nNarcissa's relationship with her other late cousin, Regulus Black, Sirius's younger brother, is unknown, though judging by Regulus's inclination towards the pure-blood supremacist ideals of the Blacks, which led him to follow Lord Voldemort and become one of his Death Eaters, the same circle to which her husband belonged, it is likely that she and he had a good relationship and maintained contact, or at least held him in higher esteem than Sirius, who earned his family's repudiation for his rejection of their ideals. It is unknown whether she knew of her cousin's betrayal to the Dark Lord in an attempt to keep the life of his house-elf Kreacher safe. The confidences Kreacher had with her and Bellatrix could also be an indicator of the good relationship she may have had with Regulus.\n\nNarcissa did not hold her late cousin Sirius Black or her older sister Andromeda Tonks in high regard, presumably because they were both \"blood traitors\" who were disowned by the Black family. Bellatrix claimed that she and Narcissa had not seen Andromeda since she married Muggle-born wizard Ted Tonks, which would have occurred in the early 1970s.[16] Narcissa also mercilessly threw Sirius's death in Harry Potter's face when he taunted her about Lucius's imprisonment in 1996.[31] For his part, Sirius held his cousin in contempt for her prejudiced beliefs.[14] Since Narcissa broke all ties with her sister Andromeda, she most likely didn't care either for her niece Nymphadora Tonks and didn't consider her to be a part of the family.\n\nHarry held Narcissa in contempt due to his rivalry with her son and hatred of her husband.[27][31] In the same respect, Narcissa held Harry and his friends in disdain and contempt, especially Hermione Granger, as she was Muggle-born, and Ron Weasley, as he was a blood traitor. Narcissa also held Harry in contempt for being Dumbledore's favourite student and associating with those whom she considered to be inferior.[31]\n\nWhen Voldemort \"killed\" Harry in the Forbidden Forest, she asked him whether Draco was still alive, as she knew that the only way she and Lucius could search for Draco inside Hogwarts would be as part of Voldemort's victorious army. Though she disliked Harry, she placed her family's welfare over Voldemort's goals. On confirming Draco's very much alive status, she plainly lied that Harry Potter was \"dead\". This action of hers was instrumental, not only in Harry's survival but in Voldemort's final defeat as well; thus, Harry's survival was once again ensured by a mother's love, although indirectly.[36]\n\nLike Draco, Narcissa held Severus Snape in high esteem and trusted him due to him being an old friend of Lucius's since their time at Hogwarts. Unlike her son, she continued to invest her faith in him despite Lucius's imprisonment and her older sister Bellatrix's doubts about him. When Draco was made a Death Eater and ordered to kill Albus Dumbledore, Narcissa saw this as a suicide mission and went to Snape for help. Snape, who likewise understood Draco was being set up to fail, agreed to her request to watch over Draco, and take over if it seemed he would fail.[5] It is unknown how she reacted when it was revealed that Snape was a double agent.\n\nLike most of the Blacks except Sirius, Narcissa was held in high esteem by Kreacher, the Black family house-elf. She in turn treated the attention-starved house-elf more kindly than her cousin did. This enabled her to learn about Harry's love for Sirius Black. Thus she was able to provide intel to Voldemort that led to the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.[15] That battle caused many tragedies for Harry and the Malfoys: it led to the death of Sirius Black and Lucius's imprisonment and further loss of favour, which in turn led to Voldemort making Draco a Death Eater. It is unknown how Narcissa reacted to Kreacher accepting Harry as his master, if she ever learned of it, but she was may have been sympathetic due to the fact she and her family, like her cousin Regulus Black, regretted being loyal to Voldemort.\n\nUnlike many others of the House of Black, Narcissa does not appear to be named after a star or constellation.",
