  "content": "Angelina Weasley[8] (née Johnson) (b. 24–30 October 1977) was a witch and a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was also a member of Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter. She was also the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team in her seventh year, which was also Harry's fifth year.\n\nIn 1998, two years after she had left school, she returned and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts against the Dark wizard Lord Voldemort and his followers. Sometime after the end of the Second Wizarding War, she married George Weasley, and the couple had two children, Fred II and Roxanne Weasley.\n\nAngelina was born in late October 1977 on or in between the 24th and 30th. When she was eleven, Angelina was accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and visited Diagon Alley to purchase the required equipment for school, including her wand.\n\nAngelina began attending Hogwarts in 1989, when she was nearly twelve years old, and was sorted into Gryffindor House.[9] At some point in her education, Angelina Johnson borrowed Quidditch Through the Ages from the Hogwarts Library, and was due to return the book on 19 July.[10] She became a Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team by or before her third year. Angelina was a popular student, and friends with fellow Gryffindors Alicia Spinnet, Fred and George Weasley, Katie Bell, and Lee Jordan; the latter appeared to be attracted to Angelina, making various admiring comments about her when he commentated on Quidditch games.[11]\n\nAngelina did not like the way that Oliver Wood referred to his players as \"men\" or \"lads\", as she, along with Katie Bell and Alicia Spinnet were female players and she would often have to correct him whilst he gave motivational speeches before games in the locker rooms. In 1991, the famous Harry Potter would arrive at Hogwarts, and after Professor McGonagall witnessed his flying skills, she appointed him Seeker for the team and Angelina would play alongside him in his first game. During an early Quidditch match, Severus Snape officiated instead of Madam Hooch and he called a penalty against Angelina during a Hufflepuff-Gryffindor game.[9]\n\nWhen playing against Slytherin, Angelina seemed to be an open target for a group take-out: she was boxed in by two players and knocked off her broom during one game. In 1992, Hogwarts was under threat of closure as the Chamber of Secrets had been declared open once again and Muggle-born students were being attacked.[12] As a precaution against this, a Duelling Club was organised and Angelina attended the first gathering with her friends Katie Bell and Alicia Spinnet, and the three fought over Professor Gilderoy Lockhart's cloak when he slung it into the audience.[13]\n\nIn her fifth year, Captain Oliver Wood would put a lot of pressure on the team as this was his final year in education and he wanted to win the Quidditch Cup for Gryffindor. Angelina and Katie discussed Hufflepuff player Cedric Diggory's physical appearance before a game and the two both expressed interest. Angelina commented that he was tall and good-looking and Katie stating he was \"strong and silent\". Gryffindor later won the Quidditch cup that year.[14]\n\nIn 1994, Hogwarts was the holding grounds to the Triwizard Tournament, a tournament required to test the bravery and skills of a wizard that was thought to be too dangerous for wizards under a certain age. Angelina was among the many students who entered their names to the Goblet of Fire, as she was just of age the previous week, but she was not selected as a champion. Her friends, Fred and George also entered, but under the influence of an Ageing Potion because they were still underage, which backfired on them. Due to the Tournament taking place, all Quidditch games and practise had been cancelled, and despite Oliver Wood leaving the previous year, Angelina would not yet take on the position of Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team as it was not required to be filled.[15]\n\nThroughout the Tournament Angelina was a supporter of champion Harry Potter. She was seen cheering loudly with Fred and George during the first task, in which Harry used his flying skills to avoid the Dragon and get the egg. Also in that same year as a requirement of the Triwizard Tournament traditions Hogwarts would hold a Yule Ball. Angelina was asked to the Yule Ball by Fred Weasley, which she accepted.[15]\n\nIn the final task, champions were required to enter a maze and fight their way to the Triwizard Cup to win the tournament. Harry Potter and Cedric Diggory both reached this cup, but it had been turned into a Portkey which transported both of them to the graveyard at Little Hangleton. Cedric was murdered by Peter Pettigrew on Voldemort's orders, while Harry's blood was used to revive the Dark Lord. Harry later returned Cedric's body back to the school grounds and Angelina was amongst the first to notice that all was not well and her short-lived cheers turned to loud screams. At the end of the school year Angelina attended the Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory that Albus Dumbledore held and she appeared quite emotional, after all Cedric was in her year, he was popular and a fan of Quidditch like herself. During this memorial service, Albus Dumbledore told the students, against the wishes of the Ministry of Magic, exactly how Diggory had died and confirmed that Lord Voldemort had returned to power.[15]\n\nIn September 1995, Professor McGonagall appointed Angelina Quidditch captain, which came with a badge, use of an office at the Quidditch Pitch, access to the Prefects' Bathroom and authority to determine the composition of the team (excepting those undergoing punishments). She proved to be at least as demanding of her team as Oliver Wood had been. She attributed this hard-driving attitude to the stress of the job, saying that she regretted having been so hard on Wood when he was Quidditch captain. Angelina had difficulty finding talent and was plagued with a year of practises most of them ending in shambles.[11]\n\nHer first duty as Quidditch captain was managing tryouts on the first Friday of term to fill Oliver Wood's keeper position. Upon learning Harry had to serve detention that day, Angelina was angry at him, deciding that it was his fault, and ordered him to say whatever he had to say to get out of detention and be there for tryouts, something he failed to do. After she had gone, Harry commented that they should check with Puddlemere United and see if Oliver Wood was still alive, as Angelina seemed to be channelling his spirit.[11]\n\nFinding that Harry was not able to convince Umbridge to change his Friday detention, Angelina angrily suggested that people who wanted to stay on the team would find a way to make it to practises. Friday evening, after the try-outs, Angelina apologised to Harry for her earlier curtness, and said that she may have been too hard on Wood; she found managing the team to be a bit stressful. Ron Weasley had not been the best Keeper she tried out; there were two better players, one was not willing to commit the time to practise and the other was a bit of a whiner, and Angelina hoped that Ron, being from a family with excellent Quidditch players, would develop over time. She likely had already decided to keep returning members on the team as she previously called them \"Keeper tryouts,\" stated she wanted to see how candidates fitted in with the team, and didn't require Harry to try out.  Their first practise as a team was marred with jeers and catcalls by Slytherins, including an insult to Angelina's braided hair.\n\nThey drilled by passing the Quaffle. Ron missed it twice, but after catching it passed it so hard to Katie it hit her face and caused a nosebleed. Fred gave her a purple sweet. They released the other balls and took to flying until Angelina blew the whistle to stop, then criticised Ron for wandering off, letting in goals and told him to either stay in centre position or circle the goals.  Katie's nose was still bleeding, and three minutes later Angelina stopped and ended practise; saying Katie needed the hospital wing. Fred realised he gave her a Blood Blisterpod by mistake and, with George, flew her to the castle.\n\nWhen Harry got a week's worth of detentions from Professor Umbridge, causing him to miss one or more practises, Angelina was furious, shouting at him in the Great Hall.  This caused Professor McGonagall to leave her table and take 5 points from Gryffindor, then another 5 points for Harry getting detention, which he thought unfair. She then threatened that if Angelina didn't confine her shouting to the Quidditch pitch, she might lose the team Captaincy.[11]\n\nDuring a Hogsmeade Weekend trip, Angelina, all her Quidditch teammates and others including Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs met at the Hog's Head to learn about a secret study group Harry was forming to learn Defence Against the Dark Arts because Dolores Umbridge wouldn't allow spells to be cast in her class. Angelina was the first to say meetings shouldn't clash with Quidditch practice and again when they were considering a place and time to meet next.  She and all attendees at the table drank butterbeer and signed Hermione's contract agreeing not to tell Umbridge — or anybody else — what they were up to.  Due to the spy, Willy Widdershins overhearing them at the pub, on Monday Umbridge implemented Educational Decree Number 24 to disband all groups, teams and meetings of three or more students, unless approved by her, under penalty of expulsion.\n\nUpon reading the sign, Angelina immediately realised Quidditch was included and on the verge of tears implored Harry to keep his temper with Umbridge in order to get permission to re-form the team. Harry agreed and did so when she was inspecting his Potions class and again in Umbridge's own class. Nevertheless, upon asking Umbridge, she replied she needed time to consider, despite that morning approving the Slytherin team, which meant Gryffindors couldn't practise Quidditch that night. Angelina had intended to teach them the Sloth Grip Roll. The next day, Angelina told Ron and Harry during break that she got permission to reform the Gryffindor Quidditch team after she went to McGonagall who appealed to Dumbledore who insisted Umbridge allow them to play.\n\nHarry did attend that night's practise in the rain, which Angelina said might be the conditions of their first match, though Fred and George wanted to skive off due to the rain and boils from testing a Skiving Snackbox. She insisted they all perform the Impervius charm to keep the rain off their faces, referring to a previous match with Hufflepuff, when Harry used it to keep his glasses from fogging. After an hour of low visibility, Angelina blew the whistle and ended the practise. The day of the next practise Angelina decided to cancel it because of more pouring rain.\n\nShe was taken aback when informing Harry, who said he was having his first Defence Against the Dark Arts study meeting that night, and to spread the word to Katie and Alicia. That night she followed Harry's instruction to a door on the 7th floor opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy and entered the Room of Requirement. As a group they decided Harry was leader, the group's name would be called Dumbledore's Army, or the D.A. for short then Harry taught them Expeliarmus. In later sessions Harry taught them the Impediment Jinx and Reductor Curse. Hermione Granger then gave Angelina and the other members fake Galleons with a Protean Charm to communicate timing of the next meeting.\n\nThe Gryffindor-Slytherin rivalry was particularly intense leading up to their first match. Slytherins' normal taunts affected Ron more than the others, being new. Their Head of House, Professor Snape, booked the pitch so often Gryffindor's had trouble practising. He also ignored Slytherins' attempts to hex Gryffindor players even when Alicia Spinnet was hospitalised. Meanwhile, McGonagall didn't give Transfiguration homework to Gryffindors the week of the match, saying \"I've been accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study... use the extra time to practice.\"[16]\n\nBefore the match Slytherins were seen wearing \"WEASLEY IS OUR KING\" badges. In the locker room, Angelina notified the team that she didn't know much about Slytherin's new beaters, Crabbe and Goyle, to which Harry and Ron said, \"We do.\" She said they were the usual gorillas unlikely to fly very well. As they left the locker room they heard Slytherins singing for the first time \"Weasley is Our King\" having derogatory lyrics to unnerve Ron. When shaking hands with Slytherin captain, Montague, she didn't wince as he tried to crush her hand.  During the match she saw that Harry was stationary in midair watching Ron and the match and had to shout at him to get going. After Slytherin scored 4 goals, Angelina scored Gryffindor's first and only goal and heard the sound of Luna Lovegood's lion hat roar. She then witnessed Crabbe hit a Bludger in Harry's back after he caught the Snitch, knocking him off his broom six feet from the ground.  She landed nearby, asking frantically if he was alright, then after he said he was, informing him who hit him. Ron, shamed by letting in goals, left the pitch.\n\nWhen Draco Malfoy landed and started taunting the Weasley twins, she grabbed Fred's arm and told him to leave it. She, Alicia and Katie then held back Fred, while Harry held back George until Harry lost his temper and they attacked Draco on the pitch with their fists, two-on-one, until stopped by Madam Hooch.  In McGonagall's office, using Educational Decree Number Twenty-Five, Professor Umbridge gave Fred, George, and Harry a lifetime ban from Quidditch for fighting and confiscated their brooms, though Fred didn't fight. (The ban was lifted after Dolores Umbridge was removed from Hogwarts). In the common room, when Angelina heard this, she spoke in a hollow voice, \"What are we going to do?\" Instead of celebrating, Gryffindor's spent the night downcast, while the Snitch Harry captured zoomed around the room, enticing Crookshanks.\n\nAt the last meeting of Dumbledore's Army before the Christmas holidays, Angelina told Harry that she had finally managed to find new Beaters and a Seeker for the Quidditch team. The Seeker was Ginny Weasley, who was surprisingly good, though not a match for Harry. It was Alicia who told Harry the names of the new Beaters: Andrew Kirke and Jack Sloper. Practises next term continued to be intense and frustrating. Angelina then found it even more challenging not to get angry with the new teammates, as Ron couldn't block goals with people watching. Angelina booked the pitch for a full day of practise on Valentine's Day, preventing her team from leaving for the Hogsmeade Weekend trip.\n\nThe following Monday night's practise nearly put her in tears, while Ron and Ginny left the pitch covered in mud. Fred and George watched, and reported Ron, Sloper, and Kirke were so bad they were sure to lose their 2nd match, which happened. During the 22-minute match against Hufflepuff, Ron's 14th failed save was dramatically bad, Sloper hit Angelina in the mouth with his beater's bat, Kirke fell off his broom, and Ginny hesitated catching the Snitch for the win, but then caught it for a 10-point loss, two-hundred forty to two-hundred thirty. Afterwards, Angelina refused to accept Ron's resignation from the team.\n\nD.A. meetings ended when Marietta Edgecombe reported their next meeting to Professor Umbridge. Harry Potter had just started teaching Patronuses after the Shield Charm.  Dumbledore took responsibility for an illegal student group so they wouldn't receive punishment (including expulsion), fought Ministry officials (including Umbridge) and fled Hogwarts. Fred and George released magical fireworks throughout the school during class time on Umbridge's first day as acting Headmistress. Quidditch practises continued to be frustrating for Angelina and the team. One was cut short early when Ron took Sloper to the Hospital Wing after getting knocked out (likely with his own bat). After being caught turning a 5th floor corridor into a swamp, Angelina's friends Fred and George Weasley avoided punishment (whipping) by dropping out with a dramatic exit in front of most of the school, inciting Peeves into tormenting Dolores Umbridge as they left.\n\nThe final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw took place on the last weekend in May.  Ravenclaw Captain Davies scored the first goal of the game, to which Slytherins sang \"Weasley is Our King.\" After that, Ron made many more saves, so when Ginny caught the Snitch, the team won the match, and with the tie-breaker won the Quidditch Cup for a second year during her time at Hogwarts. Gryffindors carried Ron on their shoulders back to the castle, and sang \"Weasley is Our King\" with their own positive lyrics.  It being her seventh year, Angelina sat for her N.E.W.T.s. At the end of exams she did not respond to the message on her fake coin signalling a D.A. meeting to help Harry break into Umbridge's office on the mistaken belief he needed to rescue Sirius at the Ministry. Umbridge was sacked the next day and Albus Dumbledore was restored as headmaster.[11]\n\nDuring the height of the Second Wizarding War, when Hogwarts had been taken over by Lord Voldemort Angelina maintained contact with Dumbledore's Army from the outside via the D.A. coin she had been given by Hermione Granger.\n\nWhen she received the signal that the school was going to make a stand against Voldemort in 1998, she returned to fight against the incoming army of Death Eaters. Angelina also must have kept in contact with her school friends Alicia Spinnet, Katie Bell, and Oliver Wood, as she arrived with the three. Angelina survived the devastating Battle of Hogwarts.[17] She most likely sat with the rest of the Weasley family grieving over Fred's body, as Fred was a good friend of hers.\n\nSometime after the end of the Second Wizarding War, Angelina grew closer to her friend George Weasley. The two eventually married and went on to have two children together: Fred Weasley (II), named after his late uncle who also was Angelina's teenage romance, and Roxanne Weasley.[18]\n\nIn the 2010s, Angelina's younger self appeared as a Foundable in two different instances during the Calamity. In the first, she was hounded by a pair of rogue Bludger Confoundables, requiring volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force to cast the Slowing Charm in order to aid her. She also appeared alongside Fred Weasley as they appeared at the Yule Ball, trapped by a snowstorm Confoundable. With the usage of meteolojinx recanto, the storm was able to be repelled and the pair could be returned back to 1994.[19]\n\nAngelina left her marital home to care for her ailing father shortly before the Quidditch World Cup in July 2014.[20] Nonetheless, Angelina travelled with her husband, son, and daughter to the Patagonian Desert to attend the final of the Quidditch World Cup on 11 July, where the four put on \"a show of togetherness up in the box\".[20] During the match, commentator Rita Skeeter mentioned rumours that Angelina had \"grown restless\" in her marriage to George, and thus chosen to leave her marital home to live elsewhere (presumably with her lover).[20] Her fellow commentator, Angelina's sister-in-law Ginny Potter, quickly refuted these rumours, explaining that Angelina had recently been caring for her father.[20]\n\nAngelina was described to be a tall, pretty witch with dark skin, brown eyes and long black hair that was often braided. Angelina was attractive, receiving romantic advances and affection from multiple classmates, such as Lee Jordan and Fred Weasley. Pansy Parkinson mocked Angelina's appearance (among many other Gryffindors), claiming that her braided hairstyle resembled that of worms, but given Pansy's nastiness and bias, her evaluation was most certainly untruthful.\n\nAngelina Johnson was very driven to succeed, whether it be at Quidditch[11] or in trying out for the Triwizard Tournament.[15] Angelina showed diligence and leadership ability as Quidditch Captain of her team, as well as competitiveness.[11] She was also brave, as shown by her sorting into Gryffindor and her decision to return to Hogwarts to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts alongside old classmates and friends.[17]\n\nGiven her friendship and eventual romantic involvement with both Weasley twins, it is likely that Angelina also enjoyed pranks and had a good sense of humour. However, her sense of humour did not compromise her seriousness about Quidditch. Angelina wouldn't hesitate to give her blunt opinion, telling Harry Potter that Ron Weasley was not a fabulous Quidditch player. She also became enraged at Harry when he kept getting detentions from Dolores Umbridge, but apologised later.\n\nIt is likely that Angelina has a good relationship with her father, as she cared for him when he was sick.\n\nAngelina became friends with both Fred and George Weasley, Gryffindor students in her year who were on the Gryffindor Quidditch team with her. The two attended the 1994 Yule Ball together. When Angelina became the team Captain in 1995, she was upset with the twins for getting banned from Quidditch, since it hurt the team's chances to be without them. The two fought alongside one another during the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nAngelina and George Weasley were good friends throughout their Hogwarts years. Fred's death devastated them both, and it may have been their shared grief that led to the two becoming closer. Angelina and George eventually married and had two children, Roxanne Weasley and Fred Weasley (II).\n\nAfter the Second Wizarding War, Angelina married George Weasley and they had two children; a son, named Fred Weasley (II), in honour of George's brother, and a daughter, Roxanne.\n\nAngelina had also several nieces and nephews through George's siblings: Victoire, Dominique and Louis, Bill and Fleur's children; Molly and Lucy, Percy and Audrey's children; Rose and Hugo, Ron and Hermione's children; and James, Albus and Lily, Ginny and Harry's children. It is supposed that Angelina and George had a good relationship with his nieces and nephews, and that they liked them. James also appeared to take after George, because they both enjoyed doing pranks and teasing their siblings.\n\nLee Jordan had a crush on Angelina and didn't hesitate to let her know it, often showing his attraction to her in his Quidditch commentaries. He also stated that Angelina had been refusing to go out with him, indicating that she didn't feel the same way. However, Angelina and Lee were both close to the Weasley twins, which probably hints they were friends themselves, although this was never made clear.\n\nAngelina became a member of Dumbledore's Army in her seventh year. It was an organisation founded and led by Harry Potter in order to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts to the members since professor Dolores Umbridge did not. Angelina knew most members of the army, and was friendly with them.\n\nAngelina was also friends with fellow Gryffindors Alicia Spinnet and Katie Bell. The three girls were all Chasers on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and joined Dumbledore's Army together in 1995. Angelina was also friendly with, though not very close to, Harry Potter, her team's Seeker (although she, along with Alicia Spinnet and Katie Bell, kissed Harry when he won them a match against Ravenclaw) and Lee Jordan, the Quidditch commentator who repeatedly asked her out, without success. She was friends with mostly everyone on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. She also appeared to be friendly with Ron Weasley, but she was annoyed by his lack of confidence when he was a member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team in 1996. She was also a friend of Hermione Granger, another Gryffindor girl.\n\nShe was also good friends with Oliver Wood, the former Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team before her. Although Oliver was not a member of Dumbledore's Army, as he had left Hogwarts when it was founded, he supported both Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix, fighting with them at the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nOther members of Dumbledore's Army were Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, Parvati and Padma Patil, Lavender Brown, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, Ginny Weasley, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Hannah Abbott, Ernie Macmillan, Susan Bones, Terry Boot, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein, Cho Chang, Michael Corner, Zacharias Smith and Marietta Edgecombe. Their relationship with Angelina is unknown, though it is possible that most of them were friends of hers.\n\nAngelina is a Latin diminutive of the name Angela, which is derived from the Greek άγγελος, angelos, meaning \"messenger\" or \"angel\".[22] Johnson means \"son of John\".",
