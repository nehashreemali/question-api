  "content": "Minister Pius Thicknesse was a British wizard and a Ministry of Magic official in the mid to late 1990s. During the Second Wizarding War, he became Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement as well as, later in the war, the thirty-fourth Minister for Magic under Lord Voldemort's puppet regime while under the Imperius Curse and thus essentially Voldemort's puppet himself.\n\nHe replaced Rufus Scrimgeour as Minister for Magic, who had been murdered by Voldemort. Thicknesse took part in the final conflict of the war, where he fought alongside the Death Eaters, still under the curse.\n\nHe was ousted from power after Voldemort's defeat and was succeeded by Kingsley Shacklebolt in his post of Minister for Magic.\n\nThicknesse was born to the wizarding Thicknesse family.[2] He ultimately became employed by the British Ministry of Magic at some point in his adult life.[3]\n\nWhen Amelia Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, was murdered by Voldemort in the summer of 1996,[8] Thicknesse was appointed her successor, presumably by then-Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour.[3]\n\nIn the summer of 1997, as part of Voldemort's plan to take over the Ministry, Death Eater Corban Yaxley placed the Imperius Curse on Thicknesse. He mentioned that this was more difficult than he had expected and had to do it with \"great effort\" (as Thicknesse's great strength of will allowed him to resist), which made him very nearly late for an important Death Eater meeting at Malfoy Manor. Many of the other Death Eaters were impressed with Yaxley's work, with Antonin Dolohov clapping him on the back in congratulations, but Voldemort pointed out that Thicknesse was only one man, as well as that he needed Minister Rufus Scrimgeour surrounded by his agents before he acted.[3]\n\nThicknesse proved useful, however. As head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, he had regular contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments, making it easier to subjugate the others. Thicknesse proceeded to do just that, remaining undiscovered and using his position to infiltrate the senior ranks of the Ministry, slowly working together to bring Scrimgeour down.[3]\n\nThicknesse also aided Voldemort in trapping Harry Potter at 4 Privet Drive, mainly by making it an imprisonable offence to connect the house to the Floo Network, to place a Portkey there, or to Apparate in or out. Ostensibly, all of this was done for Harry's protection, to prevent Voldemort from getting in at him, but, in reality, it was to prevent Harry from getting out of the house safely; the \"protection\" was pointless, as the bond of blood charm on Harry (from his mother's blood) already made it impossible for Voldemort to harm Harry while he's there, and simply making it illegal to magically enter or leave 4 Privet Drive wouldn't stop Voldemort anyway, but it would give the Ministry an excuse to arrest Harry should he magic himself out or if someone else magics him out. The Trace was also in effect, so, if Harry or anyone around him cast a spell to get him out of there, Thicknesse, and the Death Eaters, would know.[9]\n\nThe Order of the Phoenix, as a result, believed Thicknesse had 'gone over', which made him a big problem with the plan to move Harry. They abandoned the original plan (which was for Moody to take Harry by Side-Along Apparition), because it would have both alerted the Ministry and given them a reason to arrest Harry. They were unable to wait for the Trace to break, because the bond of blood charm would break with it (both spells automatically broke when the person on whom it is placed turned seventeen), leaving the house, and Harry, pregnable. As such, Thicknesse thought he had Harry cornered.[9] Due to this, the Order had to use means of magical transport that were undetectable by the Trace: broomsticks, Thestrals and Sirius Black's motorbike, setting the stage for the flight from Little Whinging,[9] and the murder of Alastor Moody by Voldemort.[10]\n\nEventually, Thicknesse and the other subverted high-ranking Ministry officials launched a 'smooth and virtually silent' coup alongside the Death Eaters,[4] and on 1 August 1997, the Ministry fell.[11] The Daily Prophet was also taken over, with the official version of Scrimgeour's murder being that he resigned and that Thicknesse had replaced him. Only the Order seemed to be aware that he was under the Imperius Curse. As a result, Thicknesse was nothing but a puppet, taking care of everyday business while Voldemort, effectively the true Minister, was free to extend his power beyond the Ministry.[4]\n\nThicknesse, at Voldemort's direction, installed a new regime at the Ministry that was more in line with Death Eater ideology.[4] His actions included having a statue depicting a witch and wizard on top of a throne made from the bodies of crude-looking Muggles inscribed with the motto \"Magic is Might\" set up in the Ministry Atrium, replacing the Fountain of Magical Brethren.[12] Yaxley succeeded Thicknesse as head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,[12] and several other Death Eaters, such as Travers[5] and Selwyn,[13] were appointed to other powerful positions within the Ministry.\n\nMeanwhile, at Hogwarts School, the Dark Arts and prejudiced depictions of Muggles were taught by professors Amycus and Alecto Carrow respectively under the new Headmaster, Severus Snape.[12] Hogwarts attendance became mandatory as well as students having to prove their blood-status, with Muggle-borns removed.[4] Harry Potter was declared 'Undesirable No. 1', wanted for questioning about the death of Albus Dumbledore[5] with a ten-thousand-Galleon reward on his head[12] (which was by March 1998 increased to two-hundred-thousand when attempts to find him all over the country continued to fail).[14]\n\nUsing falsified research done in the Department of Mysteries, the Ministry claimed that Muggle-borns 'stole' their magic from 'real' witches and wizards. As a result, the Muggle-Born Registration Commission was set up to persecute and imprison Muggle-borns,[4] with Dolores Umbridge as its head.[5] To round up any Muggle-borns or blood traitors on the run, the Snatchers organisation was formed.[15] People with known connections to the Order of the Phoenix or sympathies for Muggles, such as Arthur Weasley, were also put under surveillance.[5]\n\nWhen Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley infiltrated the Ministry in search of one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, Harry encountered Thicknesse while in the form of Albert Runcorn, with whom Thicknesse seemed familiar. Thicknesse, at the time, was wearing magnificent robes of black and gold.[5]\n\nHarry witnessed Thicknesse's altered nature while under the Imperius Curse, which showed him having a strong hatred for Muggle-borns, referring to them as 'Mudbloods', as well as blood traitors, whom he claimed to despise just as much. While Harry was searching for the Horcrux in Umbridge's office, Thicknesse arrived momentarily to jot down a note, as well as almost discovered Harry while he was under the invisibility cloak, though he ultimately failed to notice him.[5]\n\nIn late 1997, Xenophilius Lovegood's daughter was kidnapped in order to stop his telling the truth to the public and encouraging support of Harry Potter in his magazine, The Quibbler. Hoping to get her back, he sent an owl to the Ministry when Harry, Hermione, and Ron came to see him. Thicknesse promptly dispatched Travers and Selwyn to investigate. They arrested Lovegood, but failed to capture the trio.[13]\n\nDuring the Battle of Hogwarts, Thicknesse was stationed within the ranks of the Death Eaters and fought with them against the castle's defenders. He was amongst a group of masked and hooded Death Eaters who successfully penetrated Hogwarts and duelled with Percy Weasley. His hood slipped off as he tried to avoid being cursed and Percy mocked his former boss before using a Sea Urchin Jinx, causing Thicknesse to sprout sea urchin-like spikes all over his body. The corridor they were in was then damaged in an explosion that killed Fred Weasley.[16] Thicknesse and his comrades later retreated at Voldemort's command.[17]\n\nWhen the battle later recommenced, moments prior to the duel that ended the War, Thicknesse was \"floored\" by Arthur and Percy Weasley.[18]\n\nIt is uncertain if Thicknesse was killed during the battle or just stunned. The latter seems more likely, as Arthur Weasley, like the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, knew Thicknesse was under the influence of the Imperius Curse.[9] After Voldemort's death, all the people across the country who had been under the Imperius Curse came back to themselves. If he survived the battle, this would include Thicknesse. Right after the battle, Kingsley Shacklebolt was named temporary Minister for Magic, which later became a permanent appointment.[18] If Thicknesse did survive the battle, it is unclear if he rejoined the Ministry or was incarcerated. The latter possibility is unlikely, as he was acting under the Imperius Curse and had no control over his actions.\n\nIn spite of effectively having served as the 34th British Minister for Magic from 1997 to 1998, Thicknesse was omitted from most official records about the Death Eater regime,[19] as his unconsciousness eschewed any responsibility for his actions at the time.\n\nThicknesse was described as having long black hair and a beard streaked with silver, as well as 'a great overhanging forehead' that shadowed his glinting eyes.[5] Harry Potter thought he resembled a crab looking out from beneath a rock.[5]\n\nIt is unknown what Thicknesse was like before the Imperius Curse was placed upon him, or after it was removed when Voldemort was defeated. While under the effects of the Curse, however, his air of lofty authority mixed with his appearance made him generally intimidating and supportive of the way things were being run at the Ministry under himself and the Death Eaters, casually espousing the view that blood traitors were as bad as Mudbloods to Harry Potter, who was disguised as Albert Runcorn at the time.[5]\n\nIt would be unfair to judge Thicknesse solely on his activities during his tenure as Minister for Magic, however, as he was being controlled by the Death Eater Corban Yaxley at the time and was not responsible for his actions. However, since the Death Eaters ended up resorting to the Imperius Curse to get Thicknesse in the position of Minister for Magic and his name was removed from most official records afterwards,[19] it is safe to say that he was likely not a sympathiser of their ideals.\n\nAs Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, the largest department in the Ministry, it can be presumed that he was a fairly capable wizard and law enforcement official. It is implied that he was a strong-willed individual, as he tried very hard to resist the effects of the Imperius Curse.[3]",
