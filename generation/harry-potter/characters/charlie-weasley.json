  "content": "Charles[11] \"Charlie\" Weasley (b. 12 December[1] 1972)[2][3] was an English pure-blood wizard, the second eldest son of Arthur and Molly Weasley (née Prewett), younger brother of Bill Weasley and the elder brother of Percy, the late Fred, George, Ron, and Ginny.\n\nHe attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1984 to 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. He was both a Prefect and Quidditch Captain during his time at school, after which he went to study dragons in Romania.\n\nDuring the Second Wizarding War, Charlie was a member of the second Order of the Phoenix and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, arriving with reinforcements during the final portion of the battle. He was also present when Harry Potter defeated Lord Voldemort once and for all.\n\nCharlie survived the Second Wizarding War and continued his work with dragons. He never married and had no children,[12] but through his siblings and their respective marriages, he had many nieces and nephews.\n\nCharles Weasley was the second of seven children born to Arthur and Molly Weasley.[13] He was a child during the height of the First Wizarding War. In the fighting, his maternal uncles, Fabian and Gideon Prewett, both members of the Order of the Phoenix, were murdered fighting Antonin Dolohov and four other Death Eaters.[14] While he was still a child, the wizarding world became peaceful again (for a time) after Lord Voldemort's first defeat on 31 October 1981.\n\nCharlie and his five brothers — Bill, Percy, Fred, George, and Ron — as well as his younger sister, Ginny,[15] grew up in the Burrow on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon, England. Like all his siblings, he was home educated in reading, writing, and simple maths by his mother.\n\nThe Weasley family was not wealthy compared to other wizarding families. Many other pure-blood families, particularly the Malfoys, disdained them for their \"blood traitor\", pro-Muggle beliefs and their lack of wealth.[16] They tried their best to make up for this with their love. It can be assumed that Charlie had a fairly happy childhood, as all the Weasley siblings did.\n\nCharlie showed a keen interest in dragons from a young age. During a game of truth-or-dare with friends sometime during in 1989–1990, Bill Weasley revealed that, in his youth, Charlie used to try and turn the family pets into dragons. Since this was before he started at Hogwarts and knew any spells, he would settle on sticking paper wings on Scabbers using Spellotape and on making Errol fly around with a dragon mask, and then following them around while jotting down his \"observations of dragon behaviour\".[17]\n\nOn 1 September 1984, Charlie started his first term at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Gryffindor House like the rest of his family, and was in the same year as Hufflepuff Nymphadora Tonks.\n\nBy the end of his second year, Charlie became the Seeker of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.[18] He greatly excelled in the position.\n\nIn his third year, Charlie elected to take Care of Magical Creatures[19] class, since he liked working outdoors, and Muggle Studies.[20] It was around this time that he sneaked into the Forbidden Forest, having become convinced that he could catch a dragon in there. Well aware of the dangerous creatures within, Bill reluctantly accompanied him so his little brother would not have to face such dangers on his own.[21]\n\nHe would later admit to Jacob's sibling how he had been sneaking into the Forbidden Forest more often than Bill or the teachers knew about. In the forest he had met and befriended a centaur by the name of Torvus, though he seldom talked about it because he did not want to brag or know where he sometimes went off to.\n\nIn his fourth year, Charlie was involved in Jacob's sibling's search for the Forest Vault, and joined them many times in searches in the Forbidden Forest.[22] He entered the Forest Vault along with Jacob's sibling, Rubeus Hagrid, Torvus and another student (either Rowan Khanna, Penny Haywood or Bill Weasley). In the vault, he was excited to see a dragon portrait.[23]\n\nBy his fifth year, Charlie was appointed as a prefect.[14] Near the beginning of his fifth year, he joined a study session with his brothers Bill and Percy, as well as Jacob's sibling.[24] That year, he and Jacob's sibling also sold items and worked to get money to buy a dragon egg from the suspicious Alistair Fidgen, although this egg later turned out to be an Acromantula egg. However, as Charlie got a piece of a dragon, he was nonetheless satisfied.[25]\n\nLater that year, Charlie, Bill, Percy and Jacob's sibling asked Nearly Headless Nick questions about the Marauder's Map. Charlie got excited when Sir Nicholas mentioned that Jacob had believed there had been a dragon in the castle. Later, Charlie and Bill went to the Prefects' Bathroom to look for Duncan Ashe. Charlie was disappointed when Duncan left before he had a chance to ask about the dragon.[26]\n\nIn the Buried Vault, when the Hungarian Horntail was out of its portrait, the students there were all terrified, although Charles Weasley was happy and amazed because of seeing this dangerous breed of dragon.[27]\n\nCharlie eventually became Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team[28] at some point in his fifth year or later.[29] After he left Hogwarts, the Seeker position for the Gryffindor Quidditch team was taken by Harry Potter and the Quidditch Captain position was taken by Keeper Oliver Wood.\n\nEarly in his sixth year, Charlie considered dropping out of Hogwarts due to what had happened in the Buried Vault in the previous school year. However, Jacob's sibling convinced him to finish his education.[30]\n\nSometime during the year, Charlie became a founding member of the Circle of Khanna, a group devoted to avenging Rowan Khanna and locating the final Cursed Vault. It was at the groups first meeting in the Hog's Head Inn that he learned of the malevolent organisation \"R\" and it's motives to locate the final Cursed Vault before them.[31]\n\nCharlie that year also met with Jacob's sibling in the Three Broomsticks Inn and agreed to help them talk with the ghost of Duncan Ashe in the Prefects' Bathroom for information about their brother. Ashe told them both in the bathroom that he and Jacob often spent time in the Boathouse, when they then searched for information, eventually finding a letter written to Jacob's sibling from Jacob concealed as a Black Quill.[32]\n\nCharlie took his Apparition test twice. He failed on the first attempt, materialising five miles south of his target location on top of an old woman doing her shopping. He passed on the second attempt. His brothers Fred and George made fun of this, but not to his face.[33]\n\nHe achieved at least one N.E.W.T., having earned an 'Exceeds Expectations' in Care of Magical Creatures.[34]\n\nPrior to his graduation, Charlie was given a Quidditch Trophy.[35]\n\nAfter leaving school, Charlie went to Romania to study dragons.[13] At some point, he acquired a new wand, and his old wand was passed down to his youngest brother, Ron.[15] However, many of his peers believed that, had he chosen to, he could have played Quidditch professionally and would have been good enough to play for the English national side.[36]\n\nAt Christmas in 1991, Charlie was visited by his parents and his sister, Ginny.[37] During the early part of 1992, Charlie received a letter from Ron, asking for help in getting rid of a baby dragon Rubeus Hagrid acquired off a man in a pub. The dragon, a Norwegian Ridgeback named Norbert, was being illegally kept, but Ron — along with his friends Harry Potter and Hermione Granger — did not want their friend to get into trouble. Charlie, who had always got on well with Hagrid because of their shared love of dragons, agreed to help and arranged for some of his friends to pick up Norbert and deliver him to the dragon sanctuary in Romania where he worked.[38]\n\nIn 1993, Charlie joined the rest of his family for a holiday in Egypt after his father won seven hundred galleons in the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw.[39]\n\nDuring the summer of 1994, Charlie returned to the Burrow to attend the Quidditch World Cup with the rest of his family. He also met Harry Potter for the first time.[40] During the Death Eater disturbance in the aftermath of the Irish victory, Charlie, along with his father, Bill, and Percy assisted the Ministry in attempting to stop it.[41] Charlie stayed at the Burrow for the summer and accompanied his siblings, Harry, and Hermione to King's Cross Station to see them off to Hogwarts on 1 September.[42]\n\nDuring the Triwizard Tournament, which took place in the 1994–1995 school year, Charlie assisted in bringing nesting mother dragons to Hogwarts for use in the First Task. They were transported over using a Sleeping Draught, and he did not dare tell his mother about them considering that she was still angry about Harry being allowed to compete in the Tournament.[43] He remained on hand during the Task in case the dragons got out of hand, and congratulated Harry on beating the Hungarian Horntail.[44] He relayed Harry's performance to Bill, saying it was \"incredible.\" He attempted to get time off of work to attend the Third Task, but was unable to.[45]\n\nWhen Albus Dumbledore reconstituted the Order of the Phoenix to oppose Lord Voldemort, Charlie joined alongside his family. While his brother Bill returned to England to better serve the Order, Charlie remained in Romania and was assigned to recruit foreign wizards to the cause.[46]\n\nIn the summer of 1997, Charlie once more returned to the Burrow, to serve as best man at Bill's wedding to Fleur Delacour.[47] During a birthday celebration for Harry the day before the wedding, he informed Hagrid that Norbert was doing well — and was now called Norberta since they had discovered, to Hagrid's surprise, that the dragon was actually a female.[48]\n\nWhen the wedding was broken up by Death Eaters in the wake of the fall of the Ministry of Magic,[49] he was questioned alongside his family but was unharmed. He presumably returned to Romania, as both his father and brothers were allowed to return to work.\n\nWhile the rest of the Weasley family answered Neville Longbottom's call to arms to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts, Charlie did not join them immediately. This was possibly due to being out of the country at the time. During this time, his younger brother Fred was tragically killed during the first half of the battle. This was something Charlie was initially unaware of, as he was not present during the one-hour armistice.[50]\n\nHowever, he did arrive toward the end of the battle alongside Horace Slughorn. He and Horace lead hundreds of reinforcements consisting of the residents of Hogsmeade and the friends and family of all the Hogwarts students who had chosen to stay and fight Voldemort and his Death Eater army. These reinforcements changed the tide of the battle in the favour of the Defenders of Hogwarts.[51]\n\nArriving just as Neville slayed Nagini, he led them into battle against Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters, strengthening the weakened defenders of the castle. With the added fighters the defenders of Hogwarts were able to push Voldemort's army back, until only Bellatrix and the Dark Lord himself were the only two left. He also witnessed his mother killing Bellatrix Lestrange and Harry defeating and killing Lord Voldemort once and for all.[51] It can be assumed that after the battle ended he sat with his family and mourned Fred as well as the others that had fallen.\n\nFollowing the war, Charlie did not marry or have children, as he was more interested in studying dragons than in forming a romantic attachment. However, he had many nieces and nephews through all of his living siblings. Journalist Rita Skeeter wondered what the reasons behind his prolonged celibacy were.[52]\n\nIn 2019, a Magizoologist member of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force visited the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary to study dragons, where they ended up being grouped together with Charlie. While there, Charlie held a course that would allow them to spot weaknesses in dragon's hide, which would later help them in the field during the Calamity,[53] along with aiding them in their study of the creatures to increase the amount of damage they could deal in combat. In addition, he also joined said member in the grand opening of the Chinese Dragon Sanctuary, where they increased their damaging power as a result of witnessing the precision and power of a Chinese Fireball.\n\nCharlie also invited a Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force to the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary, where he informed them that manicured claws were especially potent potion ingredients and agreed to send them a shipment of clipped dragon claws after every pedicure for them to use, helping to reduce the brewing time of their Baruffio's Brain Elixirs. He also hosted a week-long dragon care intensive in Romania, which was attended by the same Calamity Investigator. Charlie taught them dragon-taming techniques and watched them grow fond of several dragons, including one which had had a piece of her stolen and turned into a combat Foundable.[54]\n\nIn September 2019, a Calamity surge focused on dragons, including Common Welsh Greens, Antipodean Opaleyes, Chinese Fireballs, and Peruvian Vipertooths, occurred at White River State Park, endangering the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. Charlie was brought in to help by the British Ministry of Magic due to his expertise with dragons, with Charlie hoping to return the frightened dragon Foundables to their proper places as quickly as possible in order to avoid any potential negative long-term effects. In the process, Charlie instructed several Calamity Investigators that had been sent to address the surge by Constance Pickering on how to safely work with dragons. After clearing the site, Charlie ran each Investigator through a test to determine their levels of determination, cleverness, courage, and cunning to ensure they could safely handle each dragon species in the surge. Once the Investigators had passed Charlie's test, he worked together with the Calamity Investigators to safely return each dragon Foundable back to its proper place.[54]\n\nCharlie was short and stocky, and he had muscled arms. His face was weather beaten from working outdoors and was so freckled that he looked tanned. His fingers were usually covered in calluses and blisters, and, on one occasion during the summer of 1994, he had a large shiny burn on one of his arms.[40]\n\nLike all the Weasley family, Charlie had red hair. It is possible he had long(ish) hair, as in 1997, on the day of Harry's seventeenth birthday, Molly forcefully cut his hair \"brutally short\".[48]\n\nCharlie was described by his brother Percy as being \"always more of an outdoor type.\" During his years at Hogwarts, Charlie liked animals and magical creatures; he later went to Romania in order to study dragons. He also appeared to be friendly with his siblings, Rubeus Hagrid, and Harry Potter, but he did not like the fact that his mother used to cut his hair short.[48]\n\nCharlie was also brave, as he was Sorted into Gryffindor house and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts against Voldemort.[51] During his Hogwarts years, he also participated in many dangerous adventures. After the war, Charlie did not marry or have his own family.[55]\n\nHe was slightly clumsy at times, for example, he had knocked over an expensive display at Zonko's Joke Shop, and only a few days later, he fell from a ladder while decorating the Hogwarts Great Hall. He also failed his Apparition test by accidentally landing on an old woman five miles south from his pre-determined destination.\n\nHe was cool-natured, but didn't like it when people teased him about his obsession with dragons, which was seen when he left his group at the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary and almost got killed by a Hungarian Horntail. He displayed extreme bravery as well during that time, and was sorry for losing his temper.\n\nCharlie had a good relationship with his family. Arthur and Molly Weasley both were pure-blood wizards who loved their children very much and cared about them. However, they were economically poor and were considered by many as \"blood-traitors,\" because they were not prejudiced against Muggles and Muggle-borns. Charlie's childhood might have been happy and friendly with his parents.\n\nHe also had a good relationship with his siblings. He appeared to be closest with Bill, because they were close in age. Bill was a good student, like Charlie; after Hogwarts, Bill worked for Gringotts Wizarding Bank in Egypt, and later married Fleur Delacour. Charlie was the best man at their wedding. It is possible that, after the war, they were as close as they were during their early years.\n\nCharlie appeared to have a good relationship with his younger siblings, too. Percy believed that Charlie was \"more of an outdoor type\"; the reason that he liked studying dragons. Percy seemed to be proud that his brother was a good student, but they were not on good terms during the Second Wizarding War; Percy believed that his family was wrong for supporting Dumbledore. After the war, Percy changed his mind and his relationship with his siblings became better.\n\nFred and George, Ron, and Ginny seemed to like Charlie; they tended to look up to Charlie as much as Bill. During their early years, Charlie might have been close with them, but he left the country, in order to study dragons. Charlie met them again in 1994 and in 1997. They also fought together at the Battle of Hogwarts and survived the war; except for Fred, who was killed in an explosion. Although Charlie was not present when Fred was killed during the first half of the battle, it is very likely that Charlie was devastated by his death, like the other members of the family.\n\nHarry Potter first heard of Charlie in 1991, during his first year at Hogwarts. Harry heard many times that Charlie was a great Quidditch player and was very happy when he and his team lived up to Charlie's reputation. Eventually, Harry became an excellent player and Seeker for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, like Charlie.[36]\n\nThey met each other in 1994, at the Burrow.[40] Harry seemed to like Charlie, who also helped him during his first task of the Triwizard Tournament; he showed the four dragons to Rubeus Hagrid, Olympe Maxime, and Harry (under the Invisibility Cloak).[43] Charlie also attended Harry's seventeenth birthday party, and, along with him, Bill and Fleur's wedding.[49] They later fought together at the Battle of Hogwarts; Charlie also witnessed Harry defeating Lord Voldemort, and they both survived the war.[51] They became brothers-in-law when Harry married his youngest sibling Ginny Weasley and Charlie became the uncle of James Sirius, Albus Severus and Lily Luna Potter.\n\nAfter the Second Wizarding War, Charlie had many nieces and nephews, through the Weasley family; Bill and Fleur's children: Victoire, Dominique, and Louis; Percy and Audrey's children: Molly and Lucy; George and Angelina's children: Fred and Roxanne; Ron and Hermione's children: Rose and Hugo; and Ginny and Harry's children: James, Albus, and Lily. It is very likely that Charlie had a good relationship with all of them.\n\nCharlie was a friend of Rubeus Hagrid. Rubeus Hagrid was the gamekeeper and later Care of Magical Creatures professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He described Charlie as being great with animals and stated that he had missed Charlie, during the time he studied dragons. They both liked magical creatures, and they met each other several times after Charlie left Hogwarts. Charlie invited Hagrid to watch some dragons he and his friends were breeding, during the Triwizard Tournament.\n\nIn 1997, Charlie stayed at the Burrow; both he and Hagrid attended Harry Potter's seventeenth birthday party and Bill and Fleur's wedding. Charlie, Hagrid, and another wizard sang along a song about Odo the hero. They also fought together at the final battle of the Second Wizarding War and survived the war.\n\nCharlie became a member of the Order of the Phoenix during the Second Wizarding War. However, it is possible that he had not met all the members of the order, as he lived in Romania, leading reinforcements for the order. Charlie had already known Nymphadora Tonks during his school years, as they were in the same year and were both members of the Circle of Khanna.[60] It is possible that he knew some other members, such as Remus Lupin, Alastor Moody, and Kingsley Shacklebolt, as Lupin attended Bill and Fleur's wedding with Charlie, and Charlie's father always spoke highly of Moody.\n\nThe name \"Charles\" comes from the Germanic name Karl, which was derived from a Germanic word which meant \"man\". However, an alternative theory states that it is derived from the common Germanic element hari meaning \"army, warrior\".",
