  "content": "Madame Olympe Maxime was a French half-giant witch and was the headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. Maxime's preferred mode of transportation was to travel with her students in a powder-blue carriage drawn by twelve winged Abraxan horses, which she personally bred.[4][3][8][9]\n\nMadame Maxime was a half-giantess, although she claimed merely to have \"big bones.\"[2] This was a necessity, however, as the approach to giants (or part-giants) was generally hostile in the wizarding world.[10]\n\nOlympe Maxime was born to one magical parent and one giant, making her a half-giantess. She kept this heritage hidden, out of fear of the prejudice that would strike her were it to be revealed.[2] She was likely educated at Beauxbatons in France, as she would later become the establishment's Headmistress.[4] It is unknown exactly when she became Headmistress of Beauxbatons.\n\nIn the 1985–1986 school year, she visited Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry along with Beauxbatons student Aurélie Dumont. At Hogwarts, she met Penny Haywood and Jacob's sibling, the latter of whom almost offended her by accident due to remarking on her height, managing to disguise it as a more flattering remark at the last second.\n\nMaxime was highly impressed with the student's rendition of the standard Beauxbatons student grand entrance as well as their ability to handle her rather unruly Abraxan steeds.[8]\n\nIn August 1994, Madame Maxime attended the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup in England with some of her students.[11] When the Dark Mark was conjured by Barty Crouch Jnr, they got separated. While trying to find her, her students asked Ronald Weasley if he had seen her. Ron, who did not speak any French, did not understand the question and was therefore unable to help them.[12]\n\nMaxime and some of her students went to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in October of 1994 for the Triwizard Tournament.[4] She made such an impact on Professor Rubeus Hagrid that he immediately started trying to impress her. Since he was another half-giant like her, he thought she would understand his feelings. He tried to tame his hair, wore his best ill-fitting clothes, and even showed her the Triwizard Tournament dragons while they were still meant to be a secret.[13]\n\nGiven his lack of social graces, however, this was not so successful. It is unclear whether she was impressed by this, but either way, Hagrid scuppered any chance he might have had at the Yule Ball. It was here that he put it to Olympe that she was a half-giant just like him — he was right, of course, but she was not inclined to concede such a point.[2] Because of this line of questioning she avoided his company. However, Harry noticed that she did attempt to re-initiate contact with Hagrid, while he dug in his garden. Apparently Hagrid did not warmly greet her and she left soon after.[10] However the two reconciled eventually.[14]\n\nWhen Harry returned from the Duel in Little Hangleton graveyard clutching the body of Cedric Diggory, Olympe was one of the first to realise that he was dead and clutched her heart in shock,[15]. She also tried comforting Fleur who was also among the first to noticed and screamed at the sight of Cedric's corpse. She was also present during the memorial feast of Cedric Diggory after the end of the Tournament. Afterwards, she and her students returned to France to Beauxtbatons.[14]\n\nDuring the summer of 1995, Rubeus Hagrid and Madame Maxime visited the giant colony in Europe as envoys for Albus Dumbledore. The outreach did not go well, however, due to the deposition of the incumbent Gurg in favour of a more Death Eater friendly one and Madame Maxime was forced to use magic in order to prevent harm from coming to Hagrid, scuppering any chances of stating their case. Hagrid described her spellwork as \"brilliant\". She separated from Hagrid during the return journey, however, because he would not abandon his half-brother Grawp, who proved to be a highly taxing travelling companion; she returned to Beauxbatons alone.[3]\n\nIn 1997, Madame Maxime was among those paying respects at Dumbledore's funeral. She and Hagrid comforted each other during this occasion, though this may have been inspired solely by the emotion of the moment.[9] She also attended the wedding of Bill Weasley and former Beauxbatons student Fleur Delacour later on that same year.[16]\n\nIt is unknown if she and Hagrid ever rekindled their relationship, although ultimately they never married.[17]\n\nDuring the Calamity, Maxime helped members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force who took a short sabbatical to Beauxbatons to study her transformative duelling style to increase the amount of damage they could inflict in combat. She also appeared as a Foundable alongside Hagrid as they appeared together at the Yule Ball, being pelted by snowballs from a Pixie Confoundable. The Foundable of her and Hagrid could be overpowered and released with the Knockback Jinx.[18]\n\nMadame Maxime was described to be a beautiful woman: an olive-skinned face with a beak-like nose and large, black, liquid-looking eyes. Her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck. She dressed from head to foot in black satin, and also wore opal jewellery.[4] Despite her size, she was elegant and graceful, and Dumbledore once stated that she was a wonderful dancer.[10]\n\nMaxime's huge size was due to her half-giant background. Initially, she fiercely denied this, claiming that she merely had \"big bones\".[2] Harry noted he \"had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life, and that was Hagrid; he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights\".[4]\n\nMadame Maxime appeared to have a good relationship with her students.[12][4] She was also shown to have a sense of fair play: she felt it was unjust that Harry Potter had also been chosen for the Triwizard Tournament (which gave Hogwarts two champions), and at first she refused to believe that Harry had not actually put his name in the Goblet of Fire.[19]\n\nHowever, she did not judge Harry unfairly during the Triwizard Tournament's tasks, giving him an 8 out of 10 (though slightly lower than most of the others', it was far fairer than Karkaroff's four) in the first task.[7] Later on, she willingly gave Harry full marks in the second task for moral fibre, despite Karkaroff only awarding him half marks,[20] showing she was a very impartial and reasonable judge of character.\n\nHowever, Olympe was ashamed of being a half-giant, and claimed that she was simply \"big-boned\".[2] Though Hagrid described her as a fine, well-dressed woman, Maxime did not complain once about having to climb over boulders or sleep in caves during her and Hagrid's mission to visit the giants, which in turn implies that — despite her denial of her heritage — she was still a realistic woman who knew how to accept her circumstances for what they were.\n\nShe also had a fiery temper and Hagrid had to restrain her from attacking two Death Eaters during the mission, leading him to speculate that this may be due to the French in her,[3] though it is possible that her hatred and anger towards them stemmed from a dislike of prejudicial beliefs that they had and which she had likely been forced to endure throughout her life.\n\nAs the Headmistress of a prominent European Wizarding school, Madame Olympe Maxime was a highly competent and accomplished witch deserving of the title bestowed upon her.\n\nDuring the Triwizard Tournament, Hagrid began a romantic relationship with Madame Olympe Maxime, Headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy. They were often seen together, talking and walking around the grounds, and they danced together at the Yule Ball.[2] Though the two had a minor falling-out when Hagrid implied (correctly) that Maxime, like him, was part giant,[2] they eventually reconciled and travelled together to appeal to the giants of the Northern colonies and dissuade them from joining forces with Voldemort.[3]\n\nMaxime was also seen comforting Hagrid during Albus Dumbledore's funeral.[9] The current status of their relationship is unknown, but as Hagrid never got married, it can be assumed that their relationship did not work out.[17] However, they likely remained good friends.\n\nAt the outset of the Triwizard Tournament, Madame Maxime was cordial and friendly with Albus Dumbledore.[4] The two later danced at the Yule Ball.[2] After meeting with Dumbledore, she agreed to help with his request to journey to the giant colonies[14] and ultimately attended his funeral.[9]\n\nOlympe is the French word for Olympus, the mountain home of the Greek gods. Maxime is French for \"principle\" (or \"maxim\"), a pun on \"principal\". It is derived from the Latin maxima, the feminine form of \"maximus\", meaning \"greatest\" or \"biggest\".",
