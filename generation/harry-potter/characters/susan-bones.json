  "content": "Susan Bones (b. 1979/1980) was a half-blood witch[2] and a Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1991 to 1998.[5] She was a member of the prominent Bones family, a family with strong connections to the British Ministry of Magic.\n\nMost of Susan's extended family, including her grandparents, uncle, aunt, and cousins were all murdered personally by Lord Voldemort during the First Wizarding War,[8] and her other aunt Amelia Bones was murdered by Voldemort in July of 1996.[9] In her fifth year, Susan became a member of Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter.[5] Susan fought along side her fellow D.A. members in the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nIt can be assumed that Susan survived the Second Wizarding War, as her name was not listed amongst the casualties of the fallen deceased. What happened to Susan afterwards is unknown.\n\nLittle is known about Susan's early life, other than the fact that she was born to at least one wizard parent, and presumably named after her aunt Amelia's middle name. Susan came from a largely magical family background, and also a rather powerful and respected family.\n\nDue to her family's position, they were sought after during the First Wizarding War by Death Eaters and a large majority were killed. Susan was born in or around 1980, a year before the war ended.\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year, the year before Susan started at Hogwarts, her aunt Amelia had her personal assistant at the Ministry sent to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries with Spattergroit; since she was assigned a seventh-year Hogwarts student in the Ministry of Magic student programme to replace the assistant, she found it easier to spend more time with her niece.[10]\n\nSusan Bones started her education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991, the same year as the famous Harry Potter. Susan shared a boat with Seamus Finnigan and Hermione Granger.[11] She was the second student to be called upon by Minerva McGonagall for the Sorting Ceremony and was Sorted into Hufflepuff House[4].\n\nThe Head of Hufflepuff House at the time was Pomona Sprout, the Herbology Professor. She was sorted into this house along with Hannah Abbott, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Wayne Hopkins, Megan Jones, and Ernie Macmillan all of whom she presumably became friends with. It is also assumed that Hufflepuff house is the house that many of her relatives were Sorted into as well.\n\nDuring her first year, Susan would learn all about the basics of magic and spell performance, like her other classmates. She was also present at the Leaving Feast during which Gryffindor won the House Cup breaking Slytherin's seven year winning streak.\n\nDuring her second year, Susan seemed to develop a crush on then-Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, which caused her to be off-task daydreaming during his lessons. She participated in the Duelling Club, as a precaution due to the Basilisk attacks that occurred after the Chamber of Secrets had been opened.\n\nAt the meeting, Susan witnessed her fellow Hufflepuff Justin Finch-Fletchley almost attacked by a serpent, including Harry Potter giving it orders in Parseltongue. Like most present, she did not have the ability to understand the language, and may have assumed that Harry was egging the snake on, as several other students did. In reality, he had successfully ordered it not to attack Justin.[12]\n\nSusan seemed to become good friends this year with Hermione Granger, a Gryffindor. The two shared an interest in the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart. They usually sat together in their Defence Against the Dark Arts classes, listening intently to Lockhart's every word. Both appeared quite giddy when Lockhart passed out his pop quiz at the beginning of the first lesson, giggling to each other when he walked away.\n\nIn Herbology, she and Hermione also worked next to one another when potting Mandrakes. It must have come as a shock when her friends Hermione and Justin Finch-Fletchley, along with Colin Creevey, were all petrified by the Basilisk living in the Chamber of Secrets.[12]\n\nLater in the year, Lockhart was exposed as a fraud. Presumably, after learning the truth that Lockhart was not a great and heroic wizard in the end of the school year, she lost her interest in him. When Hagrid returned to Hogwarts, Susan applauded him along with a majority of the school as they celebrated the close of a terrifying year.[12]\n\nDuring her third year, she would have started taking elective subjects. The school was also believed to be in danger from Azkaban escapee, Sirius Black, who was suspected to be looking for Harry Potter.\n\nDuring Susan's fourth year, Hogwarts held the Triwizard Tournament and Hufflepuff's Cedric Diggory was one of the Triwizard champions. It is likely that Susan Bones supported Diggory in favour of Harry Potter, as he was in her house and both her best friends Hannah Abbott and Ernie Macmillan were strong supporters of Diggory.\n\nCedric Diggory was technically the joint-winner of the Tournament with Harry Potter after he and Harry both reached the Triwizard Cup, thus making them the champions. Sadly, Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort after being taken to Little Hangleton along with Potter. This signified the beginning of the Second Wizarding War. Susan was most likely in the stands when Harry returned with Cedric's body.\n\nThe students were horrified to learn of Cedric's death, especially those of Hufflepuff, who were closest to him. Whether Susan had any closer relationship with Diggory is unknown, but it is more than likely that Susan attended the Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory at the end of the school year. She most likely attended with her Hufflepuff friends Hannah and Ernie.\n\nIn 1995, Hogwarts was to be under the watchful eye of the Minister and his personally appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge. Umbridge worked with Susan's aunt in the Ministry, and both served on the court for Harry Potter's trial. When Umbridge came to Hogwarts, she ensured that no practical defensive spells would be taught in her lessons, despite the claims that Lord Voldemort had returned. Thus she did not teach anything worth learning.\n\nWith the students looking for a teacher, and Harry with the best knowledge of defensive and offensive spells, Hermione Granger pledged the idea of forming an alliance to learn spells and rebel against Umbridge. This organisation would be called Dumbledore's Army, which Susan would become a member of. During the first meeting, Susan was curious to know whether Harry could produce a corporeal Patronus, a fact which she had been told by her aunt; when Harry asked if she knew Madam Bones, Susan confirmed the familial relationship.[5]\n\nHarry later gave lessons on Patronuses, but it is unknown whether Susan produced one or what form it took. Later on in the year, the Death Eaters who murdered her uncle Edgar and his family escaped from Azkaban, the wizarding prison, and many students questioned Susan for information about this.\n\nAfter the Death Eaters' escape, Susan told Harry that she understood how he felt, knowing that the person who had murdered his family was at large and constantly being asked questions about it. Harry finally had someone who could almost relate to his state of mind. Susan was pestered throughout the year by students asking about her family and its murdered members, which she found distressing.[8]\n\nOn top of dealing with the murders of her family members, this year was also her O.W.L. year at Hogwarts, which left her in even greater stress as she attempted to keep it all together and do well in her exams.\n\nAlso, on at least one occasion Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle took it upon themselves to bully Susan, making fun of her aunt and complaining that she was interfering with the Ministry of Magic's agenda. They went so far as to take her wand, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to come to her aid. The trio duelled the two Slytherins, defeating them and forcing them to leave Susan alone. Susan got her wand back and learned about the D.A. meeting in the Room of Requirement.[7]\n\nAt the end of the year, Susan was among the D.A. members who came to Harry's aid when he was attacked on the Hogwarts Express by Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle, her own erstwhile bullies. Susan and her friends all unleashed a volley of jinxes and hexes which reduced the three to gigantic slugs.[13]\n\nDuring the summer holidays before her sixth year at Hogwarts, one of Susan's last living relatives and one of the greatest witches of her time, Amelia Bones, was personally murdered by Lord Voldemort in her own home, though to her credit she did not go down without a fight.[9] Losing her aunt this way would have been especially shocking and tragic for Susan and her parents after most of her extended family had already been killed during the First Wizarding War. With the Second Wizarding War now being fought openly, the remaining members of her family were also under threat of being sought out by Death Eaters.\n\nWhen Susan returned to Hogwarts, she took the Apparition lessons offered to all students of her year. On one occasion she Splinched herself during a lessons, losing one of her legs. Her leg was successfully reattached, but the incident appeared to leave Susan somewhat shaken.[14]\n\nLater on in the school year, Hogwarts fell under attack by Death Eaters. The D.A. members were called to arms via their coins, and despite the murder of her aunt, Susan did not show up for battle. It is possible that since the D.A. meetings were no longer held, Susan no longer carried her coin around with her and did not notice the summons.\n\nSusan returned to Hogwarts for her seventh year, at which point the school was under the indirect control of Lord Voldemort. If she dropped out, she would have been a fugitive. Attendance was compulsory for children of magical families that year. Susan would have been in danger anyway, with her being a member of the Bones family; a wizarding family high on Voldemort's list to eliminate, as most of them were staunch supporters of Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix.[15]\n\nWhile under the control of Lord Voldemort and his followers, students were brutally punished and taught different subjects. For example, how to use dark magic instead of defending against it. Sensing the need for rebellion yet again, Susan joined the reconstituted Dumbledore's Army. She and fellow D.A. members stood up against Death Eater control of Hogwarts.\n\nSusan may have participated in spray painting the walls or helping fellow students who were also suffering. She would hide in the Room of Requirement, as the room had become a sort of sanctuary for D.A. members.[16] She was in the room when Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger returned to Hogwarts.[16]\n\nShe rejoined Dumbledore's Army, which had been reformed in a protest against Snape and the Carrows and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts alongside members of the D.A. and her professors.\n\nShe was most likely in the Great Hall during the second half of the battle and witnessed Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort and therefore the end to the Second Wizarding War, as she was not listed among the deceased.[15]\n\nAfter the battle, she most likely kept her D.A. coin, as a badge of honour, as did other D.A. members. It can be assumed that she attended the 2014 reunion of Dumbledore's Army.\n\nSusan was known for wearing her hair in a long plait down her back.[5] In 1996, Susan splinched herself whilst practising Apparition, and in doing so she lost one of her legs. However Susan was able to have her leg successfully reattached by the Heads of Houses but the ordeal left her confidence somewhat shaken.[14]\n\nNot much is known about the relationship of Susan with her family. Susan was a member of the Bones family, a family of many great witches and wizards. The Bones family supported the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War. That was the reason why the most of them were murdered by Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters.\n\nSusan's grandparents, her uncle, Edgar, his wife and their children were all murdered. Amelia Bones, who participated in Harry Potter's hearing, was Susan's aunt. They seemed to have a close relationship until Amelia was murdered by Voldemort in 1996.\n\nDumbledore's Army was an organisation founded by Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and led by Harry. Susan became a member during her fifth year, in order to be taught Defence Against the Dark Arts by Harry, as Dolores Umbridge, the new D.A.D.A. professor, didn't teach them how to properly defend themselves, thinking they would oppose the Ministry of Magic.[5]\n\nSusan became a member, along with her fellow Hufflepuffs Hannah Abbott, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley and Zacharias Smith.[5] Susan shared a dormitory with Hannah Abbott (a fellow Hufflepuff) and was most probably invited to join Dumbledore's Army by her. She may have been also a close friend of Ernie and Justin. It is unknown if she was a friend of Zacharias, too. Susan and her fellow housemates (except Zacharias) fought for Hogwarts at the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nShe was very impressed by learning that Harry could cast a Patronus, and she also told him how she felt about her relatives' deaths during the First Wizarding War.[5]\n\nShe was also seemed to be a friend of Seamus Finnigan, whom she shared a boat with on her first year and was often seen talking to him in lessons and in Dumbledore's Army meetings.[11]\n\nOther members of the army she possibly knew are Ginny Weasley, Parvati Patil, Lavender Brown, Dean Thomas, Padma Patil, Luna Lovegood, Neville Longbottom, Alicia Spinnet, Angelina Johnson, Katie Bell, Fred and George Weasley, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Terry Boot, Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, Cho Chang and Marietta Edgecombe.[5] The majority of them fought at the Battle of Hogwarts and their fate is ambiguous.",
