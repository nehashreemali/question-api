  "content": "Nicolas was born in the early 14th century. In his youth, Nicolas attended Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in the Pyrenees Mountains of France, and it was there that he met Perenelle, his future wife. It is said that he later funded both the academy's chateau and grounds, and a fountain on the grounds was named after the couple.[3]\n\nFlamel became a noted alchemist of considerable talent.[5] At some point, he created the Philosopher's Stone, an item of immense magical power. With the Stone, he created the Elixir of Life, a potion that made the drinker functionally immortal as long as it was regularly ingested. He and Perenelle regularly used the potion after that time.  Although it is clear that he used the Elixir to greatly extend his life, it is not specified whether he used the Stone's powers to make himself wealthy, as the Stone was also capable of turning any metal into gold.[5]\n\nNicolas was implied to have been in personal combat, but had become inactive in this field by the 1720s.[8] In 1762, he was spotted at an opera house in Paris.[9]\n\nIn the 1890s, Nicolas first came into contact with the brilliant teenager Albus Dumbledore.[7] Dumbledore later moved to Paris briefly to study under him where, according to Flamel, 'he would go on and on about the uses of dragon's blood', and had quite a high opinion of himself.[10] Later at some point, Flamel was briefly mentioned on Albus's Chocolate Frog Card.[11] Immortal, Flamel also became the oldest member of the Club D'Échecs National Gobstones, having been a member for 398 years by 1927.[12]\n\nWhen Albus Dumbledore began to take action to stop the Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, Flamel, as his friend, decided to help him in this, and agreed to let him use his home as a safehouse for any potential allies should the situation require it, and gave him a card leading to the home. Albus gave Newt Scamander the card as Albus was unable to participate in the fight.[13]\n\nIn 1927, Newton Scamander, a Magizoologist, decided to take advantage of the invitation and arrived at the Flamel House alongside two Americans by the name of Porpentina Goldstein and Jacob Kowalski, as well as Yusuf Kama. The three were attempting to track down Credence Barebone, a young wizard important to Grindelwald's plans, though for different reasons.\n\nKama, who was attempting to assassinate Barebone, had tried to take Newt and his friends captive in his sewers, allowing him to track down his target unhindered. However, he had suddenly lost consciousness due to his exposure to the Water dragon parasite venom. Once they had arrived safely at the Flamel House, which was by then well protected by various Protective enchantments, Scamander was able to remove the Water dragon parasite from Kama's eye. Soon after, while Yusuf recovered from the procedure. Newt and Tina travelled to the French Ministry of Magic to retrieve the Lestrange family tree box.\n\nFlamel stood behind a just awoke and hungry Jacob Kowalski which he thought was a ghost, to which he replied that he was an alchemist and therefore, he was immortal. Kowalski quipped that he did not look more than 375 years old and attempted to shake his hand. Because of Nicolas' frail state due to his extremely advanced age, Jacob's firm grip hurt him and he screamed from the pain. Jacob apologised, but Nicolas was okay.[14]\n\nAfter the greeting, Flamel looked over at his crystal ball, which showed, among other things, that Grindelwald was about to host a rally for his followers at the Lestrange Mausoleum at Père Lachaise Cemetery. They also saw Credence Barebone and Nagini heading there, along with Queenie Goldstein, Tina's sister. When Jacob saw Queenie, he asked Flamel where the place in the ball was located and requested Nicolas to look after Kama. However, when Jacob looked at the place where Yusuf should have been laying, Yusuf was gone, making the request obsolete. While Jacob was running out of the house, Flamel demanded Jacob not to go to the Cimetière.[14]\n\nA moment after Jacob left, the vision in the crystal ball changed and presented the upcoming tragic events at Grindelwald's rally. While watching, the alchemist became scared and wanted to warn Albus with the help of his book, he was shocked to see that Dumbledore was not available, so he panickedly flipped a few more pages and found that Eulalie Hicks was there, who advised him to go immediately. Nicolas had doubts, because he had not been in active battle for two hundred years. However, she declared that everyone believed in him, which made him go.[14]\n\nFlamel arrived as Grindelwald had escaped and unleashed Protego Diabolica, a kind of Dark Magic so powerful and unstable that none of the assembled wizards opposed to the Dark wizard knew how to counter it, in an attempt to destroy Paris. When Newt, Tina, Jacob, Yusuf, Nagini and Theseus Scamander ran out of the fire that was consuming everything, Nicolas ordered them to form a circle, plant their wands in the ground and use the General Counter-Spell. This created a cleansing red fire which, directed by Flamel and the others, eliminated the effect of Grindelwald's spell and saved the whole city from destruction.[15]\n\nAfter containing the flames, Nicolas comforted a tearful Jacob, whose fiancée, Queenie, had just left him to join the Alliance.[15] By 1929, he became friends with Auror Lou Ferme.[16]\n\nBy the 1990s, Flamel had moved to Great Britain with his wife and enjoyed a quiet life in Devon.[5] Although he rarely left his new house, Dumbledore persuaded him to do so in the 1990–1991 school year on the pretence of giving a lecture on alchemy at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. Nicolas brought a Failed Stone with him to aid with his lecture, and after the lecture went to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for a tour of the castle. There, the Failed Stone was stolen and ended up being swallowed by Sir Ribbithe, a student's pet frog, who gained the power of chrysopoeia and was let loose around the school, turning everything it touched into gold. This surprised Flamel, who had believed it was impossible for a being to possess the power of chrysopoeia, and he resolved to study the process further once the stone was recovered. During the incident, Dumbledore met with Flamel to discuss his concerns that the Philosopher's Stone wasn't safe at Gringotts Wizarding Bank, and Flamel agreed, giving Dumbledore permission to store the stone at Hogwarts.[10]\n\nAfter the Underground Chambers were completed, Dumbledore tasked Rubeus Hagrid with retrieving the stone from Gringotts, which he did whilst picking up Harry Potter and taking him to Diagon Alley to buy his school things. By sheer coincidence, that same day Professor Quirinus Quirrell was in Diagon Alley to steal the stone from Gringotts (under the orders of Voldemort) and Hagrid retrieved the stone mere hours before Professor Quirrell would attempt to steal it.[17] Voldemort, disembodied after his initial attempt to kill Harry backfired, intended to use the Elixir to restore himself to physical form, however his plan was thwarted by the efforts of Harry, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley.\n\nAfter consulting with Dumbledore, Flamel agreed that the stone should be destroyed. Though they had enough Elixir to set their affairs in order, it was expected that they would die shortly thereafter as their supply ran out. When Dumbledore informed Harry of this, the young wizard initially took the news to be terrible. However, Dumbledore assured him that, for them, it would be like \"going to bed after a very, very long day\", implying that when Nicolas and his wife passed on, their deaths would be dignified and peaceful.[4] Although it is unknown for exactly how long Flamel lived after the stone was destroyed, he and his wife had died by at least 1996.[2]\n\nA kindly old man with a polite disposition, Nicolas Flamel warmly welcomed Newt Scamander, Jacob Kowalski, Tina Goldstein, and Yusuf Kama when they arrived at his home in Paris, treating Dumbledore's \"friends\" like his own.\n\nIn spite of his advanced age, Nicolas was happy to do what he could to help put an end to the Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald's seemingly unstoppable rise to power, and agreed to let his home be used as a safehouse for those who opposed him. Although he appeared to have had some doubts about his own abilities, Nicolas nevertheless proved himself to be a very brave and selfless individual, as he arrived to help Newt Scamander and the latter's allies to fight Grindelwald at the Lestrange Mausoleum when called upon to do so by Eulalie Hicks; though he had not been entirely certain that he was up to the task. Because of his lifetime of achievements, it is likely that he was simply concerned that his advanced age had dulled his abilities.\n\nAlthough he arrived too late to help fight Grindelwald himself, Nicolas nevertheless displayed great courage both by his timely arrival, and by his help in containing the incredibly powerful, rampant black fire their foe conjured, and was, as such, instrumental to the efforts to save Paris from it. Despite making efforts to stop his Philosopher's Stone falling into the wrong hands, by the age of 690, he ultimately viewed death as \"but the next great adventure\" much like his friend Albus Dumbledore. Hence, after Lord Voldemort very nearly succeeded in capturing his Philosopher's Stone, Nicolas willingly had it destroyed, having collected enough Elixir of Life to set his and his wife's affairs in order.[4]\n\nFlamel was also well known for his love of opera.[5]\n\nBelying his frail exterior, Nicolas Flamel was a very powerful and accomplished wizard. Rich in learning and experience, testaments to Nicolas' considerable abilities were his proficiency in alchemy, held to be some of the most difficult Magic known to Wizardkind, and Nicolas helping to save the city of Paris from the rampant, destructive black fire unleashed by Gellert Grindelwald, the most powerful Dark wizard of the early 20th century.[15]\n\nPerenelle Flamel was the wife of Nicolas Flamel. Nicolas Flamel shared the Elixir of Life with Perenelle, making them both functionally immortal until the Stone was destroyed in 1992.[4] They lived happily for the over 600 years that they were together.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore was a close friend to Nicolas. During the Global Wizarding War, Flamel let him use his home as a safe house for allies that opposed the Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, and helped protect Paris from certain destruction at the hands of said revolutionary leader alongside Newt Scamander, Theseus Scamander, Tina Goldstein and Yusuf Kama.[6] The faith and trust he had in Dumbledore was evident, and highlighted by his allowing Albus to put the Stone in Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London in 1991 to prevent Lord Voldemort from stealing it. It was also Albus who moved the stone to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for further protection later the same year.[4]\n\nJ. K. Rowling related that several months into the writing of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, she had a highly detailed and exceptionally vivid dream about Flamel, which was like \"a renaissance painting come to life\". Flamel was leading her around his cluttered laboratory, which was bathed in golden light, and showing exactly how to make the Stone.[23]",
