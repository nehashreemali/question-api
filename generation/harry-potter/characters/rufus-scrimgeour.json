  "content": "Minister Rufus Scrimgeour (d. 1 August 1997) was a British wizard who was a powerful ranking official in the British Ministry of Magic. He originally joined the Ministry of Magic as an Auror, where he became a hardened veteran, spending most of his life fighting Dark wizards. Eventually he rose to become Head of the British Auror Office.\n\nDuring the Second Wizarding War, Scrimgeour was appointed in 1996 to succeed Cornelius Fudge as the thirty-third Minister for Magic, being the third ex-Auror to hold the post.[10] While he appeared to provide a much tougher and resolute stance against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, he made the same mistake of creating the appearance of safety and security, while in truth Scrimgeour's efforts were waning in progress in the war.\n\nThis policy of giving the appearance of false safety would ultimately cost Scrimgeour his life, as it left the Ministry open to infiltration by the Death Eaters, who used several high-ranking Ministry officials, all of whom had been subverted to their control, to launch a successful coup and bring the Ministry under Voldemort's control. Lord Voldemort, wanting the location of Harry Potter, captured and brutally tortured Scrimgeour multiple times in an attempt to make him reveal what he knew, and when Scrimgeour still refused to say anything, Voldemort murdered him.\n\nRufus Scrimgeour was born (possibly in Scotland[11] or Wales)[12] into the wizarding Scrimgeour family on a date no later than 1968. It was highly likely Scrimgeour attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during his youth, where he would have received his magical education. Scrimgeour joined the Ministry of Magic, and completed a stringent series of character and aptitude tests to join the Auror Office.[13]\n\nAt some point before he became Minister, Scrimgeour joined Bertie Higgs, Tiberius, and Cormac McLaggen to hunt recreationally for Nogtails in Norfolk.[14]\n\nEventually, after serving as an Auror for some time and having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life, Scrimgeour rose to the post of Head of the Auror Office, which he occupied at least in the early-to-mid-1990s.[9] In this capacity, Scrimgeour worked alongside John Dawlish, Proudfoot, Savage, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Gawain Robards.\n\nWhen he was the Head of the Auror Office, he often questioned Tonks and Shacklebolt about Sirius Black, as they were in charge of the investigation of his whereabouts after his escape from Azkaban.[9]\n\nWith Lord Voldemort finally out in the open and declaring open war on Britain's wizarding and Muggle communities, it forced the wizarding community to unite and call for Cornelius Fudge's resignation. In the fortnight following the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Ministry's acknowledgement of Voldemort's return in June of 1996,[4] Minister Fudge was, as The Quibbler went on to report, \"chased from his office.\"[15] Fudge left office in disgrace and was replaced by the ostensibly more proactive Scrimgeour, while the position as Head of the Auror Office was given to Gawain Robards.[4][16]\n\nSoon after, Scrimgeour made a speech to the Ministry and the Daily Prophet about \"dark times\", and trying to better protect Britain from Dark wizards than the previous year,[17] as the Ministry under Fudge had denied any evidence of Voldemort's return and branded Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter liars for saying the opposite.[9]\n\nWhen Fudge resigned in the summer of 1996, he and Scrimgeour visited the Muggle Prime Minister in his office via the Floo Network, in which Fudge introduced Scrimgeour as his successor. Scrimgeour informed the Prime Minister of various strange happenings in the country, such as the Junior Minister Herbert Chorley being bewitched with the Imperius Curse, who was subsequently hospitalised at St Mungo's. He expressed the belief to the Prime Minister his security needed to be increased by the Ministry of Magic, in order to prevent similar events occurring, and the Prime Minister was also not too happy with two wizards entering his office so abruptly. He and Fudge bid the Prime Minister farewell and promised to keep him updated about ongoing wizarding affairs.[4]\n\nScrimgeour, though seemingly more capable than Fudge, decided to prioritise appearances over truth in his battle against Voldemort. Apparently, Scrimgeour distrusted Albus Dumbledore in a similar way to Fudge before him, as he assigned Auror John Dawlish to follow Dumbledore during his frequent departures from Hogwarts, ultimately resulting in the Auror being jinxed by Dumbledore.[18] He ordered the arrest of Stan Shunpike, a conductor on the Knight Bus, to give the impression that the Ministry was actively seeking and arresting Death Eaters, even though it was apparent to Harry that Shunpike was innocent and merely foolish.[19]\n\nHe also quarrelled with Dumbledore over the use of Harry Potter, the alleged \"Chosen One\", as a mascot for the Ministry to \"boost morale\".[18]\n\nOn Christmas Day 1996, which Harry spent at The Burrow in Devon, Scrimgeour came to visit him, accompanied by Percy Weasley, whom he used as a pretext. Scrimgeour took Harry for a walk around the garden, during which he tried to get answers out of Harry about what Dumbledore was doing, and suggested that the Ministry would be grateful if Harry was to visibly align himself with them.\n\nHarry, revolted by the Ministry's hypocrisy, refused further assistance, saying that the new Ministry was as bad in its own way as the old one.[16]\n\nAfter Dumbledore's death atop the Astronomy Tower, in the summer of 1997, Scrimgeour and a delegation of Ministry officials came for a short stay at Hogwarts Castle, so that they could attend Dumbledore's funeral. Scrimgeour was seated in the front row, with Minerva McGonagall, looking \"grave and dignified\". After the service, Scrimgeour once more tried to convince Harry Potter to openly support the Ministry's endeavours, and Harry once again refused.[20]\n\nScrimgeour spoke to Harry once more at The Burrow on 31 July, a month after Dumbledore's death, to release the contents of the late wizard's will to Harry, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger, interrupting Harry's birthday party.[6]\n\nScrimgeour appeared to have aged considerably as a result of working to retain control of the wizarding community, which was in a state of open warfare. He had delayed releasing Dumbledore's personal bequests for thirty-one days, under the Decree for Justifiable Confiscation, in order to inspect the items. Scrimgeour bombarded the trio with questions, attempting to discern Dumbledore's intentions, and was highly suspicious of the gifts he had left them: the Deluminator for Ron, a Golden Snitch for Harry, and an original copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard for Hermione. Scrimgeour refused to give Harry Dumbledore's final bequest, Godric Gryffindor's Sword, believing it to be a historical artefact and public property, which Dumbledore therefore had no right to dispose of as he saw fit.[6]\n\nWhen Harry criticised Scrimgeour for wasting his time scrutinising Dumbledore's things, and for covering up the recent escape of dozens of Death Eaters from Azkaban, the two came close to a duel, in spite of Scrimgeour's claim that he in fact sought to work together, in order to fight Voldemort. The arrival of Arthur and Molly Weasley forced Scrimgeour to regain composure and then depart.[6] Scrimgeour correctly guessed that there might be something hidden inside the Golden Snitch, although he never found out what, as Dumbledore had ensured that the Snitch would only open \"at the close\".\n\nThe following day, 1 August 1997, the Death Eaters staged a successful coup on the Ministry, as they now had agents loyal to them surrounding the Minister, and as such were able to make a successful attempt on his life.[2] Pius Thicknesse, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and several other high-ranking Ministry officials had all been placed under the Imperius Curse.[21]\n\nAccording to what Arthur Weasley heard, Scrimgeour was captured and tortured by Voldemort and his allies for information on Harry Potter's whereabouts, before being murdered by Voldemort himself. If true, he would've refused to reveal anything despite knowing where Harry was, in order to ensure Harry's safety was still maintained, allowing Harry to escape instant capture and instead live to ultimately defeat and slay Scrimgeour's killer in the Battle of Hogwarts.[22]\n\nThe official line to Scrimgeour's murder was that he resigned. In his place, the Imperiused Thicknesse was appointed as a puppet Minister, allowing Voldemort to take full control of the Ministry.[22] During Thicknesse's regime, the Muggle-Born Registration Commission was set up to persecute and imprison innocent Muggle-borns,[22] with Dolores Umbridge as its head, while Harry Potter again became a wanted person, being declared \"Undesirable No. 1\", wanted for questioning about the death of Albus Dumbledore.[23]\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione came to respect Scrimgeour after learning of his sacrifice.[22] After Lord Voldemort's defeat, Scrimgeour's assassination was exposed, with the wizarding public remembering him for his heroic sacrifice to protect Harry's life. However, given that Scrimgeour went down the same path of corruption and misguided decisions as Fudge did, he was also remembered for his inability to do much to turn the tide of the Second Wizarding War.[24]\n\nWhen Harry encountered Dumbledore's spirit in Limbo when rendered unconscious by Voldemort's Killing Curse during the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry pointed to Dumbledore that he could have been a better Minister than either Fudge or Scrimgeour to which Dumbledore disagreed due to believing he could not be trusted with power as a result of his past with Gellert Grindelwald and the death of his sister.[25] Only when Harry defeated Voldemort for the final time and when Kingsley Shacklebolt was appointed the new Minister for Magic afterwards where the corruption and misguided decisions by both Fudge and Scrimgeour in the Ministry were truly undone and peace was finally restored to the wizarding world.\n\nIn 2019, Scrimgeour appeared as a Foundable during the Calamity. Volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force were able to free him, allowing Scrimgeour to return to his original time.[24]\n\nScrimgeour was a man with a certain rangy loping grace; he walked with a slight limp, and looked rather like an old lion with grey streaks in his mane of tawny hair and bushy eyebrows. He had keen yellowish eyes and wore wire-rimmed spectacles.[4] He sometimes used a walking stick.[20] With time, the stresses of the failing conflict reached him, and when last seen he appeared badly-shaven, scraggy, and grim.[2]\n\nScrimgeour was, according to Dumbledore, a \"man of action\", having fought against Dark wizards throughout his career as an Auror and climbed ambitiously through the Ministry.[26] He gave an impression of shrewd toughness and was more decisive and forceful than his predecessor, Cornelius Fudge.[4] Scrimgeour did not underestimate Voldemort as much as Fudge did,[26] which he demonstrated by taking more action for the wizarding world to fight Voldemort and the Death Eaters, and cared a great deal about the Ministry's reputation.\n\nHowever, despite appearing more proactive, Scrimgeour appeared to be a selfish individual and possessed a more hypocritical, deceitful and shameless side as even though he took more action against Voldemort than Fudge did, he prioritised appearances over truth and cared more for the Ministry's reputation than the safety of the wizarding community, just as his predecessor had done. As a result of his selfishness, he did not allow the reporting of devastating events which had occurred such as the death of renowned Auror Alastor Moody and the 1997 mass breakout of Azkaban, due to believing it would cause panic and ruin the Ministry's reputation, and to keep an appearance of false security and safety. At the expense of true justice, he even allowed the arrest of innocent people — such as Stanley Shunpike — just for the slightest suspicion about knowing Voldemort's plans in order to give the impression that the Ministry was making progress in the war, similar to what Bartemius Crouch Senior had done.[16]\n\nThis was most likely fueled by a belief that maintaining peace and giving false appearances of progress were important for the Ministry to regain trust from the wizarding community after they unanimously condemned Fudge's tenure as Minister, when in reality it only further endangered the wizarding community by keeping them more oblivious and unprepared of Voldemort's actions and intentions. Due to his own selfishness and corrupt nature, Scrimgeour also appeared ignorant of corruption within the Ministry, as he was oblivious of Dolores Umbridge's tyrannical crimes during her temporary rule over Hogwarts,[16] and the fact that Pius Thicknesse and other Ministry employees were put under the Imperius Curse to serve Voldemort.[21] Along with his tendency to keep an appearance of false security, this would ultimately prove to be Scrimgeour's undoing.[2]\n\nUnder his shamelessness and hypocrisy, he was also willing to gain the trust of those who the Ministry had previously attempted to discredit in order to keep a false pretence of peace. He tried unsuccessfully at various times to convince Harry Potter to work for the Ministry as a \"mascot\" to improve morale: once during the Christmas holidays,[16] and another time after Dumbledore's funeral.[20] Harry strongly disliked his hypocrisy and false pretences, claiming Scrimgeour's actions made him just as bad as Bartemius Crouch Senior and Cornelius Fudge. Harry also acknowledged that Scrimgeour honestly cared nothing for his safety, but that he merely wanted him to become a mascot for the Ministry in order to convince the wizarding public he was doing a good job, showing Scrimgeour's selfishness and disregard.[16]\n\nScrimgeour would also become very irate when someone, such as Harry Potter, criticised the Ministry of Magic's actions under his tenure,[16] and demanded others show him the utmost respect at all times, showing he did not take criticism well and held a very high opinion of his position in the wizarding world. Like Severus Snape, he thought of Harry as arrogant and insolent, and disliked him for it,[6] and when Dumbledore refused to accommodate with his intended use of Harry as a mascot or reveal his plans against Voldemort to him, Scrimgeour had a deep distrust of Dumbledore. This distrust resulted in him attempting to spy on Dumbledore,[16] and trying to control the matter of Dumbledore's will after his death rather than prioritising the fight against Voldemort.[6]\n\nDespite his flaws, Scrimgeour's redeeming qualities were that he was more courageous and less prejudiced in comparison to Fudge. His less prejudiced nature was shown when he promoted Arthur Weasley, who had long been neglected and shunted sideways by Fudge due to his love for Muggles, to be the Head of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects,[27] and also interacted cordially with the Muggle Prime Minister.[4]\n\nThis demonstrated that unlike Fudge, he did not favour people who were born with high status over those with lower class and also did not put as much importance in blood purity, although promoting Arthur may have also been another unsuccessful attempt to gain Harry's trust. In the end, he proved his bravery and strength of character when he refused, under torture, to tell Voldemort of Harry's whereabouts. This showed that in spite of himself and dislike of Harry, he did not wish for Harry to be killed by Voldemort and was willing to risk his own life in order to protect him and the Ministry from the Dark Lord.[2]\n\nRufus is a Latin name meaning \"red\". It was a Roman cognomen as well as the nickname of King William II of England, who had the reputation for being an effective soldier but a ruthless and unpopular ruler. Scrimgeour is a Scottish surname that is believed to probably mean \"skirmish\", from the French escrimeur, meaning \"swordsman\". His name therefore loosely translates to \"Red Skirmish\" or \"Red Swordsman\".[30]",
