  "content": "Molly Weasley (née Prewett) (b. 30 October[1] 1949 or 1950)[2] was an English pure-blood[4] witch and matriarch of the Weasley family after marrying Arthur Weasley. She was born into the Prewett family and was sister to Fabian and Gideon Prewett, members of the original Order of the Phoenix.\n\nMolly attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. Sometime after she graduated, both her brothers were murdered by Death Eaters in the First Wizarding War. Molly and Arthur ended up having seven children, consisting of six sons named Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George and Ron and only one daughter named Ginny Weasley. She also played a large part in the life of the famous Harry Potter, acting as a motherly figure towards him.\n\nMolly was a member of the revived Order of the Phoenix following the return of Lord Voldemort and participated in the final battle of the Second Wizarding War. Her actions during this battle caused her to be known as the witch that defeated and killed the notorious Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\nMolly survived the final battle to see her family expand even further. By 2017, she had twelve grandchildren: Victoire Weasley, Dominique Weasley, Louis Weasley, Molly Weasley (II), Lucy Weasley, Fred Weasley (II), Roxanne Weasley, Rose Granger-Weasley,[12] Hugo Granger-Weasley,[12] James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter, and Lily Luna Potter.\n\nMolly was born on 30 October[1] in 1949 or 1950[2] to Mr and Mrs Prewett. She had two brothers: Gideon and Fabian. It is unknown whether she was the middle child between them, or older or younger. Molly began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the early 1960s and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. She once said that in her youth, she brewed a Love Potion.[13]\n\nIt was at Hogwarts where Molly met Arthur Weasley, whom she fell in love with and began dating. One night, they went out for a night-time stroll and whilst Arthur got caught by Apollyon Pringle, she managed to get back to Gryffindor Tower at four in the morning and was told off by the Fat Lady.[14]\n\nMolly graduated from Hogwarts in the late 1960s. She and Arthur wed soon after.[15] The family lived at The Burrow on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon. Molly and Arthur's first child, William, was born 29 November, 1970.[1] More children followed: Charlie, Percy, and twins Fred and George. After having her first five sons, she longed to have a daughter but when she attempted to have said daughter, she had another son, Ronald, before finally having a daughter, Ginevra.[16]\n\nDuring the First Wizarding War, Molly wasn't mentioned as a member of the Order of the Phoenix, something that was confirmed by Remus Lupin. This is likely because she was having and taking care of many young children at the time. However, her brothers were members of the Order, but were murdered during the war by five Death Eaters in 1981, including Antonin Dolohov, who was subsequently imprisoned in Azkaban for the crime. Given the way she speaks about Gideon and Fabian, Molly was distraught at their deaths and may have inherited their things, as was seen by her keeping Fabian's watch for several years.\n\nIn 1987, Fred, whom along with his brother had a reputation as a prankster, burnt a hole in Ron's tongue by feeding him an Acid Pop. This made Molly outraged enough to wallop the former with her broomstick. Throughout Fred's and George's childhood, they pulled a multitude of other pranks on members of their family.\n\nBy 1991, all her children from Bill to Fred and George had been accepted to Hogwarts and Sorted into Gryffindor House, and Ron's first year at Hogwarts was to begin. Molly and Ginny accompanied Percy, Fred, George, and Ron to King's Cross Station, although her daughter was too young to begin school herself. After Percy, Fred, and George got onto Platform 9¾, another young boy approached her and politely asked how to get onto the Platform. She kindly gave him instructions, and told him to go ahead before Ron.[10]\n\nAfter getting onto the platform with Ginny, Molly learned that the boy they had just met was the famous Harry Potter. When Fred and George wondered if he remembered what Lord Voldemort looked like, she became stern and forbade them from asking him. When last calls for the train came, Molly ushered her children onto the train and called for them to have a good term. She addressed the twins, telling them that she didn't want to receive any more owls sending the message that they had pulled any more of their trademark pranks, for example that they had blown up a toilet, and George quipped that they would send her a Hogwarts lavatory seat.[10]\n\nHaving become friends with Harry, Ron contacted Molly shortly before the Christmas holidays to tell her that Harry wasn't expecting any presents. She came to the rescue, knitting him an emerald green Weasley jumper and making him a box of home-made fudge.[17] For the Christmas holidays, Molly, Ginny, and Arthur also went to Romania to visit Charlie.\n\nWhen Harry and the others returned from Hogwarts for the summer, he thanked Molly for the jumper and fudge, to which she insisted it was no trouble. When Harry's uncle Vernon barked at him to get moving, she tried to engage him in conversation, which ended up going nowhere.[18]\n\nOne night, Molly was scared to death when she found Fred, George, and Ron's beds empty, the family car gone, and no note left behind explaining what the boys were doing. When the trio returned with Harry the next morning, having flown to Surrey and back, her anger exploded and she yelled at them for what, to Harry, seemed like hours. She didn't blame Harry, but threw her sons nasty looks the whole time she made breakfast. To punish them, Molly made them de-gnome the back garden. When she looked up the process in Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Household Pests, Fred implied that his mother had a crush on Lockhart. While she said the thought was ridiculous, her body language told another story — she beamed at his picture and blushed slightly.[19] However, as she was married, this may have just meant she admired Lockhart very greatly.\n\nAbout a week after Harry arrived at The Burrow, Molly and Arthur took the family and Harry to Diagon Alley to buy their school supplies. Before leaving, she and Arthur learned that Harry had never travelled through the Floo Network before. After Harry got lost in Knockturn Alley, she was relieved to find him safe with Hagrid, being grateful to the half-giant for finding him. After getting their money from Gringotts, Molly departed with Ginny to a second-hand robe shop, to meet the others an hour later at Flourish and Blotts. After Arthur got into a fist fight with Lucius Malfoy, she was livid, claiming that his actions were a bad example to set for their children.[20]\n\nAfter dropping the children off at King's Cross Station on 1 September, Molly and Arthur were outraged when they found their car gone. That night, she received a letter from the head of Gryffindor Minerva McGonagall explaining what Harry and Ron had done. The next day, she sent a Howler to Ron, expressing her absolute disgust at his reckless behaviour and the fact that Arthur was now facing an inquiry at work, and warning him that they would have to bring him home if they received word of any further misdemeanours.[21]\n\nIn the spring of 1993, Molly and Arthur arrived at Hogwarts, who were extremely worried after learning that the Monster of Slytherin had taken Ginny into the Chamber of Secrets. When Harry and Ron brought her back safely, she was grateful to Harry and curious as to how he managed it. After Harry explained everything, she accompanied Ginny to the hospital wing.[22]\n\nThat summer, Arthur won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw. He and Molly decided to spend the gold on a trip to Egypt to visit Bill. While Bill took them on tours of the pyramids, she refused to let Ginny come into the last one, which was full of \"mutant skeletons\" of Muggles who had broken in and \"grown extra heads.\"[23] After returning about a week before the new school year, Molly learnt from Arthur that Sirius Black had escaped from Azkaban Prison and that his target was supposedly Harry, as Sirius was muttering \"he's at Hogwarts\" in his sleep. She also heard from Arthur that the former prisoner intended to murder Harry.\n\nAfter meeting Harry in Diagon Alley on 31 August, Molly discussed Black's connection to Harry with Arthur, who wanted to tell Harry the truth about why Black was supposed to be after him. She didn't want to send Harry to school with that hanging over his head, while being convinced that he would be perfectly safe from harm since Dumbledore was stationed at Hogwarts. Arthur then countered that if Black could break out of Azkaban, then he was capable of breaking in to Hogwarts.[24] The next day, Molly and Arthur saw Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the others off to school. The following June, she arrived at King's Cross to pick her family up.[13]\n\nIn August, Molly sent a letter to the Dursleys by the Muggle postman, \"asking\" permission to take Harry to the Quidditch World Cup, though the Weasleys were planning to collect Harry whether the Dursleys said yes or no. Unsure of how much postage to include, she completely covered the envelope with stamps, leaving only a square inch on the front in which she managed to squeeze the Dursleys' address.[14]\n\nWhen she entered the family's kitchen, Molly caught Arthur in the middle of scolding Fred and George for something. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny disappeared upstairs while Arthur was forced to tell her about the Ton-Tongue Toffee the twins had pulled on Harry's cousin Dudley. After she stopped yelling at them, she began preparing dinner, during which she huffed about George and Fred's trouble-making.[14]\n\nOn the morning of the Quidditch World Cup, Molly caught Fred and George trying to smuggle Ton-Tongue Toffees out of the house, in unusual places like the lining of George's jacket and the turn-ups of Fred's jeans. When she read about the Death Eaters' attack on the World Cup grounds, Molly became worried for her family. When the family arrived safely back home, she hugged Fred and George, crying over the thought of the fact that if they had died, the last thing she spoke to them about would be that she yelled at them for not having earned more O.W.L.s.[14]\n\nOn 1 September, Molly, Bill, and Charlie accompanied the trio to King's Cross Station for the return to Hogwarts, wishing all of them a happy term and gave hugs goodbye. The three of them all implied that something special was happening at the school, but wouldn't elaborate. This left the trio and others highly curious as to what it could possibly be, but they didn't find out until the term started what the surprise was.[14]\n\nAccording to Charlie, when Harry's name came out of the Goblet of Fire as a surprise fourth champion, Molly was against letting him compete, believing that Harry was too young. She was \"in floods\" after reading an \"interview\" with Rita Skeeter in which Skeeter claimed Harry still cried about his parents, as she happened to believe every word that Rita Skeeter penned and felt bad for Harry. Considering his mother's already fragile state, Charlie didn't have the heart to tell her what Harry had to do for the First Task.[14]\n\nMolly was horrified when Skeeter reported that Hermione Granger was messing with Harry. As a result, on Easter she sent Hermione chicken-sized Easter eggs containing homemade toffee, whereas the ones she sent to Harry and Ron were the size of dragon eggs.[14]\n\nIn June, Molly arrived at Hogwarts with Bill to watch Harry in the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, in place of his family. While whittling down the hours until the task started, Harry gave her and Bill a tour around the grounds, showing them the Beauxbatons carriage and the Durmstrang ship. Molly was intrigued by the Whomping Willow, which had been planted after she left school. She also reminisced about Ogg, the gamekeeper before Hagrid.[14]\n\nWhen the trio returned to the castle for lunch, Ron was surprised to see his mother and eldest brother there. Fred, George, and Ginny came over to join them, something which Harry enjoyed. When Hermione appeared at the table, having come from the library, she greeted her more stiffly than usual, as Skeeter had been writing articles about the prodigy student supposedly toying with Harry and Viktor Krum's affections. After Harry explained that the stories were false and that he and Hermione had never been romantically involved, she warmed up to her son's friend once again. Molly later defended Harry with a fierce passion against Amos Diggory's accusations of not correcting Rita Skeeter in her original article about Harry, which was supposed to be about the Triwizard Tournament.[14]\n\nAfter Harry returned from Little Hangleton with Cedric Diggory's dead body, Molly, the other Weasleys, and Hermione stayed with him in the hospital wing. When Dumbledore acted to reactivate the Order of the Phoenix, Molly was shocked to learn Sirius Black was in the room, still believing Sirius to be a mass murderer like most of the wizarding world. However, Ron was able to convince her otherwise. Molly and the other members learnt about Lord Voldemort's return, which she believed Harry about. She also comforted Harry after his horrific experience in the Little Hangleton graveyard.[14]\n\nA week into the summer holidays, Molly had her heart broken when Percy broke contact with the family after a row with his father. Percy insulted his parents, believing them to be \"idiots\" for following Dumbledore, and moved out to a flat in London.[25] She went to London to try and talk with Percy, but he simply slammed the door in her face.\n\nMolly and Arthur moved their family to 12 Grimmauld Place in London, the headquarters of the Order. Under Dumbledore's orders, the Weasleys kept Harry Potter in the dark about the Order's goings-on. When the Advance Guard delivered Harry to Grimmauld Place, she was pleased to see him, but quickly ushered him upstairs so he wouldn't interrupt the Order's meeting. When the meeting ended, Molly brought the children downstairs for dinner. Against her wishes, Sirius and Remus gave Harry the general picture of what the Order was doing in the fight against Voldemort, which lead to an intense row between Molly and Sirius involving Harry's welfare.\n\nFor the following weeks, Molly led the charge in making the house suitable for living in, which was not an easy task considering how long it had been without inhabitants or proper housekeeping.[25] When Harry had to go to the Ministry for a hearing regarding his illegal use of under-age magic, Molly was among those who worried about the result. Like the rest of the family, she was relieved when Harry was cleared of all charges, although she did scold Fred, George, and Ginny for parading around chanting \"He got off.\"\n\nWhen Ron was made a Gryffindor prefect, Molly was overjoyed and offered to get him a reward, to which he asked for a new broom, but quickly added that it didn't need to be a good broom upon seeing his mother's face fall. She returned later that night with the children's school supplies and prepared a party to celebrate Ron and Hermione's appointments. When \"Mad-Eye\" Moody arrived, Molly asked him to look at what was in the writing desk in the drawing room. Using his \"mad\" eye, Moody confirmed it was a Boggart and offered to get rid of it, but she declined, commenting she would do it after dinner.\n\nAfter Harry witnessed her inability to vanquish it, she tearfully expressed her concern over her family's safety. Lupin comforted her, explaining that the Order had a better understanding of Voldemort than they did the first time, and that while he couldn't promise no one would get hurt, the Order would do their best to protect her family and Harry from the upcoming danger.[7]\n\nOn the morning of 1 September, Fred and George again got on Molly's nerves when they bewitched their trunks to zoom down the stairs, to save the trouble of carrying them. The trunks managed to knock Ginny down two flights of stairs, to which her mother screamed at the pair that they could have seriously injured her. When Sirius came bounding downstairs in his dog form to see Harry off, Molly reiterated that it was a bad idea, but felt that it was up to him if he wanted to risk his safety.\n\nWhen she got wind of the secret group Harry, Ron, and Hermione were planning to form in order to teach practical defensive magic, Molly was firmly against the idea, believing that they would all have time to learn to defend themselves after they left school. Being assigned that night to assisting in guarding the Hall of Prophecy, she asked Sirius to pass on a message to Ron, which was that he was in no way to continue the group. She also wanted the message passed on to Harry and Hermione, due to accepting that she had no control over the pair's actions, but having their best interests at heart.\n\nDuring the Christmas holiday, Molly was contacted by Dumbledore's phoenix Fawkes to warn her that Arthur had been attacked by Nagini while doing guard duty for the Order. While the Weasley children stayed with Sirius in Grimmauld Place, they wanted to set off for St Mungo's at once. In response, Sirius had to convince them they couldn't until their mother had been notified, as it would look too suspicious otherwise. This caused issues with Fred and George whom wanted to see their father immediately.\n\nBefore setting off for St Mungo's, Molly sent a note to Grimmauld Place, which stated that Arthur was still alive and warned them to stay put. At 5:10 a.m.[25] she arrived at Grimmauld Place to tell them Arthur would be all right and that they could all visit him later, making George and Ginny very relieved before they got up and hugged her. When Sirius began making breakfast, Molly hugged Harry and expressed her gratitude that if not for him Arthur might have died. She proceeded to tell Sirius to go and relax and that she would take over breakfast.\n\nWhen the Weasleys and Harry visited Arthur in St Mungo's, Molly became alarmed when Arthur mentioned one of his room-mates was a werewolf, but he calmed her by pointing out the full moon wasn't for another fortnight. When the twins tried to get information from Arthur about what he had been doing, she got angry and told them that the topic wasn't up for discussion. Molly later fretted over Harry's supposed illness when he was acting strangely after their visit. In fact, Harry was concerned and scared for the well-being of others because he thought he might have been possessed by Lord Voldemort, but she did not know this.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Molly's concern about Percy reached a breaking point when he returned his Christmas jumper unopened. Fred and George \"attempted\" to console her, but soon afterwards Lupin took over. When the family and Harry returned to visit Arthur again, Molly exploded after learning that for his wound, Arthur had tried using stitches, a Muggle remedy for similar Muggle wounds.\n\nIn June, Molly and Arthur arrived at King's Cross Station to pick their children up. The couple also made plans with Dumbledore to take Harry to The Burrow two weeks into the summer holidays, so he wouldn't have to spend the whole summer with the Dursleys, probably guessing that Harry didn't want to spend his entire summer holidays grieving his godfather's death at Privet Drive alone, with only his negative thoughts and unpleasant relatives for company.\n\nWhen Harry arrived in July, Molly revealed that Arthur had been promoted to head a new department for Rufus Scrimgeour. From the tone of her voice, Harry deduced she had been \"bursting\" to tell someone. She made him a bowl of onion soup and remarked on how much he had grown since she saw him last, stating that it looked as though he had a Stretching Jinx placed upon him. Molly and Harry then discussed Horace Slughorn and his return to Hogwarts. When Arthur arrived home from work, he made her ask him their security questions before allowing himself in, as to set an example and in the process revealed that Arthur's private nickname for her was \"Mollywobbles.\"\n\nThe next morning, Molly expressed her disdain at Bill's engagement to Fleur Delacour, whom was staying at the house as Bill had brought her to The Burrow so she could get to know his family better before the wedding. Molly had a low opinion of Fleur and disliked being alone with her, thinking that she was snobbish and rude. She also felt that the engagement was rushed and believed it was due to the fear brought on by Voldemort's return to power. According to Ginny, she kept trying to break up the engagement by inviting Nymphadora Tonks to dinner, hoping that Bill would fall for her instead.\n\nWhen Hermione got a black eye from one of Fred and George's punching telescopes, she went to Molly to try and get rid of it, but she was unable to remove the bruise even with The Healer's Helpmate. When Ron's O.W.L. results arrived, Molly was pleased to learn he had earned seven \"pass\" grades, commenting that it was more than Fred and George both earned, put together. When the school book lists arrived, she refused to go to Diagon Alley without Arthur; when Ron made a joke about Voldemort possibly hiding in Flourish and Blotts, his mother threatened not only to leave him behind and get his things herself, but to hold him back from returning to Hogwarts too, so Ron quickly recanted as he wanted to see Fred and George's new shop.\n\nWhen the family and Hagrid arrived in Diagon Alley, Molly expressed her concern to stay together, while at the same time battling the desire to finish the shopping quickly. Hagrid assured her that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would be fine with him, so she, Arthur, and Ginny headed off towards Flourish and Blotts. When the group reunited, they headed off towards Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Approaching the store, Molly stared in horror at the advertisement for \"U-No-Poo\", an item they sold to help cause constipation. Once inside the store, Ginny asked her mother if she could buy a Pygmy Puff. At one point, she also caught Ron in the middle of making an extremely rude hand gesture at Fred and immediately threatened to jinx his fingers together if she saw him do it again.\n\nOn 1 September, Molly and Arthur ushered the children onto the train back to Hogwarts.\n\nDuring the Christmas holiday, Molly had her hands full, as she entertained many guests that Christmas, some including Harry, Fleur, and Remus. She masked Percy's continued defection from the family by saying he was busy at the Ministry. When Rufus Scrimgeour brought Percy over in an excuse to speak to Harry, the others present tensed at the mention of Scrimgeour wanting to get Harry alone but Molly paid no regard to this, as her main focus was Percy, which was made evident by her overjoyingly crying tears of happiness and hugging her son.\n\nHowever, Percy had no intention of speaking with his family, so his mother was more devastated than ever when Percy stormed out after having mashed parsnips flung at his glasses by Fred, George, and Ginny. She continued to be upset well past Christmas, teary eyed and sobbing when she saw her children and Harry off to Hogwarts via the Floo, bidding them farewell and had them promise to try and be careful, which resulted in her being in slightly higher spirits by the end of the goodbyes.\n\nIn March, Molly and Arthur were called to the school when Ron accidentally drank some poisoned mead. Harry saved his life by the use of a bezoar, a small stone found in the stomach of a goat that acts as an antidote to most poisons. When the pair arrived in the hospital wing, she hugged Harry very tightly, pointing out how many of the family members he had saved. She was very happy that Ron was no longer in danger and would make a full recovery.\n\nMolly and Arthur returned to Hogwarts again in June after learning that Bill had been injured in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. While Arthur was interested in how Dumbledore had died, she only had her eyes on Bill. She commented that Bill had always been handsome and that he was \"going\" to be married, but Fleur took offence to this and shouted that she didn't care what Bill looked like, as her love for him ran deeper than physical appearance. Accepting that the pair truly did love each other, she offered Fleur her great-aunt Muriel's goblin-made tiara to wear at the wedding, and then the two women hugged, which was surprising as Molly had always disagreed with Fleur and Bill's relationship.\n\nIn June, Molly and Arthur attended Dumbledore's funeral along with Bill and Fleur. They were deeply saddened by the tragic death of the Headmaster of Hogwarts, who protected their family members and their comrades in the Order. At some point, Molly learned that Harry, Ron, and Hermione were planning to drop out of Hogwarts. When she approached them to find out why, they refused to divulge any information. While Arthur and Remus also approached the issue and dropped it when they were told it was a secret, she was determined to learn the truth.\n\nWhen Harry and Hagrid arrived at The Burrow after the Battle of the Seven Potters, Molly was relieved that they managed to arrive safely. She hurried from the inside of The Burrow and proceeded to pull Harry into a hug that he felt he didn't deserve. She was worried because a lot of the others had missed their portkeys and Harry and Hagrid were the first to arrive, even thought they were supposed to arrive third. Hagrid then asked if Molly had any brandy, for \"medicinal purposes\", as he was in pain from the battle. Instead of summoning it by magic, she went into the house to collect it herself. Harry knew that this was because she wanted to hide her worry and the blotchiness of her face.\n\nA few moments later, Ginny alerted Molly to the arrival of Lupin and George. Seeing there was obviously something wrong with her son, she soon learned that he was missing his left ear. Molly managed to staunch the bleeding, but was unable to repair the damage. However, she was simply relieved that he was alive. When Arthur and Fred returned safely, Molly cried harder than ever when George turned the injury into a punch line. George then commented that at least from then on, she would be able to differentiate the pair. A few minutes later, Ron and Bill both returned safely. Hugging his mother, Bill told the group that \"Mad-Eye\" Moody had been killed.\n\nWithin a few days, Molly approached Harry under the pretence of determining the owner of a sock, about why he, Ron, and Hermione were planning to leave Hogwarts. Harry refused to say explicitly why, but dropped hints that it was because of something Dumbledore wanted him to do. She argued that she and Arthur deserved to know, and was sure Mr. and Mrs Granger would agree, continuing that Dumbledore had the whole Order at his command if he wanted something done and the three of them were hardly of age. Harry countered that there had been no misunderstanding: the mission Dumbledore left for him was for him alone, and Ron and Hermione were coming along by choice.\n\nSeeing she was fighting a losing battle, Molly then changed the subject by asking if he would help prepare the house for Bill and Fleur's wedding. He agreed, but she made sure to give the trio jobs that kept them away from each other, believing that she could delay their departure if she could prevent them from getting together and planning, as Ginny commented to Harry. When the Delacours arrived the following morning, Molly was somewhat flustered, but pleased to have them there. She and Arthur fervently insisted that Monsieur and Madame Delacour take their bedroom, while she and Arthur slept in the sitting room.\n\nThe following day, which was also Harry's birthday, Molly gave him a watch that had belonged to her late brother Fabian. In the middle of explaining the tradition of giving children a watch when they came of age, her speech was interrupted by a hug from Harry with which he hoped to convey his deep feelings of gratitude and care, which worked as she was taken-aback but very touched. When Charlie arrived that evening, she forced him into a chair at wandpoint and gave him a haircut. Molly then made a scrumptious dinner and made Harry's birthday cake into the shape of a Golden Snitch. Just before the cutting of the cake, she learned that Rufus Scrimgeour was accompanying Arthur home. After the pair arrived, Scrimgeour revealed the reason for his visit: he required a private word with Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\nThe next day was Bill's wedding to Fleur. Molly was once again in tears as Percy didn't show up. During the ceremony, she sat with Apolline Delacour and the pair cried into their tissues. At the reception that followed, she danced with Monsieur Delacour. Soon afterwards, Molly learned with everyone else that the Ministry of Magic had fallen to the Death Eaters' control and that Scrimgeour was dead, shortly before the reception was ransacked by arriving Death Eaters. After the Death Eaters left, she and Arthur sent word to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that the rest of the family was safe.\n\nIn March, the Death Eaters identified Ron as travelling with Harry Potter. Bill was able to get word to his family, and Molly and the rest of the Weasley family vacated The Burrow. They lived with her aunt Muriel during this time.\n\nOn 2 May 1998, Molly and Arthur arrived at the school to take part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Along with several other individuals, she cast protective charms over Hogwarts before the battle. As the combination of the Order and Dumbledore's Army left to gather in the Great Hall, she was adamant about Ginny going home since she was under-age. Ginny insisted she should be there in addition to the rest of her family and because she was a member of Dumbledore's Army. During this argument, Percy entered the room, having learned of the pending battle from Aberforth Dumbledore. He made peace with his family, much to her relief.\n\nWhen the family left to join the others, Molly caught Ginny trying to sneak out with them. Lupin then proposed that Ginny could stay in the Room of Requirement; that way she could remain close to her family while simultaneously being out of harm's way. During a break in the battle, as ordered by Voldemort, Molly grieved Fred's death in the Great Hall. She laid across his chest and wept, while Arthur stroked her hair.\n\nWhen the battle resumed, Molly witnessed Bellatrix Lestrange fire a Killing Curse at Ginny, who was fighting along with Hermione and Luna Lovegood. Distraught at the prospect of losing yet another child as well as her only daughter, she angrily charged right at the infamous Death Eater who at first was beside herself with laughter at the idea of Molly  attempting to fight her but soon became enraged as she bore witness to Molly's fierce assault. Both witches began to battle with such lethal ferocity that the \"floor beneath them turned hot and cracked\".\n\nAs Molly continued her attack, Bellatrix taunted her, asking what would happen to her children when she died. Molly vowed that Bellatrix would never inflict harm on her family again and struck the arrogantly distracted Bellatrix with a deadly blow.[26] In doing so, she avenged Frank and Alice Longbottom, Sirius Black, and Nymphadora Tonks, among countless others.\n\nThe death of his \"last, best lieutenant\" made Voldemort turn his wand on Molly, but Harry shielded her and revealed himself to be alive. She and everyone else watched the interaction between Harry and Voldemort, which ended with Voldemort's final defeat and the end of the Second Wizarding War. Molly joined the other Weasleys in congratulating Harry. She was last seen sitting with Ginny (who had her head on her mother's shoulder) and her other family members at a table in the Great Hall.[26]\n\nIn the years following Voldemort's death, Molly's family grew with the marriages of her children and births of numerous grandchildren. She also served as the namesake of Percy's oldest daughter. However, while she was able to return to her normal personality after the conclusion of the war, she never fully recovered from Fred's death.[27]\n\nIn the 2010–2011 school year, she purchased a Bloom For You plant from Bewildering Blooms, causing her to be affected by the Mysterious Malady. She was later awoken from the malady after the Bewildering Blooms owner Yubert Thorne was imprisoned in Azkaban. Thorne, who had been a supporter of the Death Eaters in the Second Wizarding War, had targeted Molly because of the crucial role she had played in the Battle of Hogwarts by killing the right-hand lieutenant of the Dark Lord himself, Bellatrix Lestrange.[28]\n\nIn April 2020, a massive influx of tourists began visiting The Burrow as a result of its mention as an important historical site in the travel guide One Hundred Historical Sites from the Second Wizarding War, leading to a Calamity surge focused on The Burrow and its residents. In response, Molly and Arthur took charge of managing the tourists and dealing with the Foundables spawned by the surge, although Molly still continued to try to make The Burrow look presentable for the tourists. She was regularly confused by seeing Foundables of a younger Ron appearing at The Burrow, believing that Ron had come to visit them. She also made sure that Arthur continued helping her return Foundables even after he had been attacked by the family chickens following an incident with Decoy Detonators.[29]\n\nMolly also noticed that several tourists were searching The Burrow grounds for \"artefacts of historical value\" that they could pilfer, with Molly making sure that Arthur's shed was under enough protective enchantments to ensure they wouldn't steal any of his Muggle artifacts. She also recruited Ginny to help her with crowd control. However, the tourism influx did also lead to The Burrow's gnomes temporarily vacating The Burrow's garden, with Molly claiming that it was nice to take de-gnoming off of her chore list during the chaos. Eventually, the tourists began to die down, but Molly and Arthur were secretly pleased that some of them had erected a plaque \"in honour of the Weasley family's contributions and sacrifices\" during the Second Wizarding War.[29]\n\nIn the spring of 2021, The Unforgivable threatened Harry Potter and Hermione Granger after the two began wrenching control of Calamity surges away from the cabal. The two feared that their children would be targeted, but Harry insisted on continuing to fight against The Unforgivable. Harry redirected a Calamity surge and controlled it using memories of the Marauders. In response, in April of that year, both Ginny and Ron were attacked by members of The Unforgivable. Although Ginny was able to successfully fend off her attacker, The Unforgivable were successful in abducting Ron.[30]\n\nIn the aftermath of Ron's abduction, Ginny attempted to reassure Molly and Arthur that Ron would be alright. After a Foundable of Molly was returned from another Calamity surge focused on The Burrow, Molly suddenly received an implanted memory of Ron coming to her crying and begging her to convince the Ministry to listen to The Unforgivable so that he could go home. Molly reached out to Hermione to inform her of the memory and made Hermione promise that she would \"give The Unforgiveable hell\" for her. Fortunately, Ron was eventually recovered, but his memories were completely Obliviated, necessitating Harry and Hermione to continue helping Calamity Investigators return Foundables related to the trio's Hogwarts years in order to help return them.[27]\n\nMolly was frequently described as a short, plump, and kindly-looking woman. Like the rest of her immediate family, she had flaming fiery red hair and her eyes were the same shade of warm brown as her daughter's.[31] Harry was shocked to see that she could so easily look \"like a sabre-tooth tiger\" when she was angry with her sons.\n\nMolly was described as \"porky\" by Draco Malfoy[14] and \"dumpy\" by Vernon Dursley (despite the fact that Vernon and his son were much larger than her).[14] Between June and August 1995, she lost a good deal of weight and appeared paler, though she seemed to get a healthier look back by the next year.\n\nMolly was a kind-hearted, gentle, loving, and very motherly woman. It was comfortable for almost everyone to be around such a sympathetic and warm person. Being in the same room with her was very reassuring. Appalled at the mistreatment that Harry suffered at the Dursleys, Molly was delighted to have Harry stay with the Weasleys at The Burrow, where she could offer food, advice, and general mothering. Starved for affection from his own aunt Petunia, Harry found warmth from Molly, who he considered to be his closest mother figure. Molly was also very protective of her children as well, although (especially in Fred and George's case) she could become very annoyed with their antics.\n\nMolly could have even her twin sons cowering before her if she was angry enough. She was fiercely proud of her children's accomplishments, but was also scandalised by their misbehaviour, being particularly frustrated for the twins' antics. She wasn't above sending a Howler to the school to humiliate one of them publicly for stepping out of line, as evidenced by her reaction to the use of the unauthorised Flying Ford Anglia by Ron to reach Hogwarts at his second school year. Ironically, it was high achiever Percy who caused her the most pain, breaking with the family for their unwavering allegiance to Albus Dumbledore.\n\nHarry occasionally found Molly's over-protectiveness somewhat smothering. Along with her eldest son Bill, she came to watch Harry in the Triwizard Tournament and after his ordeal in the graveyard, visited him in Hogwarts' hospital wing, where she hugs him 'how Harry imagined a mother would'. However, Molly sometimes found it difficult to cope with her children heading out in their own, separate directions. Not surprisingly, she considered Fleur Delacour wrong for Bill when they became engaged until the former showed her true feelings.\n\nWhen Harry asked about what the Order of the Phoenix was doing against Voldemort, she continually insisted he shouldn't be told more than he needed to know under Dumbledore's orders. However, his godfather Sirius believed that he had to dealt with more than the Order could imagine and thus deserved to have the whole picture. Though Harry was touched by Molly's actions, he felt Sirius was right in that he wasn't a small child and should be treated as a maturing adult, something which she understood but still worried about.\n\nMolly was born into the Prewett family. Her relationship with her mother and father is unknown, but it is possible that, like the Weasleys, the Prewetts didn't buy into values of pure-blood supremacy held by so many other wizarding pure blood families, as Molly had these same views.\n\nHer brothers, Fabian and Gideon Prewett, were both members of the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War, but were brutally killed by five Death Eaters. It is likely that Molly was close to her brothers, as she kept Fabian's watch until she gave it to Harry Potter for his seventeenth birthday. Their deaths influenced her later protectiveness of her family during the Second Wizarding War.\n\nMolly was close to her other family members as well; her uncle, Ignatius Prewett's first name became her son Percy's middle name, and aunt by marriage Lucretia Prewett (née Black). Her irritable great-aunt Muriel was still alive in the 1990s and associated with her family.\n\nMolly was very close with her husband, whom she was deeply in love with, and seemed to get along well with his family. She pampered her seven children as much as she could afford to, making up for the lack of funds for new books, brooms and robes by showering her loved ones with affection and providing them with abundant and delicious home-cooking and handmade gifts. However, Molly had no qualms about speaking her mind and enforcing discipline when her children put a \"toe out of line\"; the only thing Hermione Granger could do to stop Fred and George testing their Skiving Snackboxes on first years prior to their departure from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was threaten to write to their mother, something which genuinely scared them.\n\nShe constantly tried to pressure Bill into cutting his hair and not dressing as flashily as he liked to. Molly had a strong desire for her children to work at the Ministry of Magic like their father, causing her to scold Fred and George on numerous occasions for their dream of managing a joke shop. In the end, she clearly wanted her children to be happy in their careers, being impressed when Fred and George proved to be skilled businessmen.[15]\n\nThough she was frequently exasperated with her husband's quirky fascination with Muggle artefacts and his seeming inability to act as a firm disciplinarian when it came to many of their sons' shenanigans, Molly clearly loved Arthur dearly and was fiercely proud of all he had accomplished in his career.[15]\n\nMolly's love and sense of protection for her family - especially the youngest members - was apparent in the form her boggart took: Her greatest fear was her family, including Harry, lying dead on the floor. Her fear of seeing her family dead was partially realised when Fred was killed during the Battle of Hogwarts, especially since one of the forms that her boggart took was the dead bodies of the twins.\n\nMolly loved all of her children, but she seemed especially fond of her youngest child and only daughter, Ginny, whom she spent most moments with. When she saw Ginny being fought by Bellatrix Lestrange, the mere possibility of losing her only daughter was enough to make her openly challenge and kill the most dangerous Dark witch of that age. Also, Molly was notable for extending her familial affections to those who weren't related to her, including Ron's best friends.\n\nMolly was heartbroken when the \"high achiever\", Percy, turned his back on his family in favour of pursuing his career at the Ministry. She tried to get him to return several times but to no avail, often crying over his departure and continued to send him gifts like her hand-knitted Christmas jumpers, which he would coldly return without a note. Despite his aloof departure, Molly remained affectionate towards her third son, using his good behaviour as reference when scolding the twins for overusing their magic for the simplest matter and masking his defection by making excuses for him such as being too busy at the Ministry to return home for Christmas. After Percy apologised to the whole family, Molly was not shown to have any problems in forgiving him.\n\nAfter the Second Wizarding War, Molly's family expanded even further, having many grandchildren through her sons and daughter: Victoire, Dominique and Louis, Bill and Fleur Delacour's children; Molly (who was named after her) and Lucy, Percy and Audrey's daughters; Fred and Roxanne, George and Angelina Johnson's children; Rose and Hugo, Ron and Hermione's children; and James, Albus and Lily, Ginny and Harry's children. Based on her affection for her family, it is likely that Molly was a devoted grandmother.\n\nMolly first met Harry while taking her sons to the Hogwarts Express. She took pity on him for being alone, as he seemed to be a sweet and polite boy. Upon being told by Fred and George who he was, Molly was adamant that her children not pester Harry about his past, stating that he would probably get enough attention and instructing them not to add to it. After getting to know more about Harry through Ron, Molly began treating him as another member of the family, whether it be by letting him stay at The Burrow for the school holidays or fussing over the state of his health and making sure he had additional helpings during meals, although she tended to avoid the subject of the Dursleys when Harry brought them up even briefly.\n\nShe also sent Harry a Weasley jumper and a large box of fudge or mince pies every Christmas, even after the two of them had only spoken briefly at King's Cross during Harry's first year, simply because Ron had mentioned that Harry wasn't expecting any presents.\n\nMolly would occasionally forget she wasn't Harry's mother and tended to be as protective of him as if he was one of her own children, a sentiment Harry himself shared. She was deeply affected when Harry was forced to compete in the Triwizard Tournament, to the point that her attitude towards Hermione temporarily became almost hostile because she assumed Rita Skeeter's claims that Hermione was toying with Harry's emotions until Harry himself assured her otherwise.\n\nMolly pushed particularly hard for Harry not to be \"burdened\" with the knowledge of certain aspects of the Order of the Phoenix's business involving Voldemort, which caused her to come into conflict with Harry's godfather, Sirius Black and even her own husband. She showed her over-protective nature again upon discovering that Harry, Ron, and Hermione weren't intending to return to Hogwarts during their final year, demanding to be informed of their intentions and even did everything in her power to prevent them having any opportunity to discuss their plans in secret.\n\nThe form of Molly's Boggart, which reflected her greatest fear of seeing her family dead by appearing as their dead bodies, included Harry's own corpse. In return, Harry was grateful to her for the love and protection he needed and wanted. After Molly killed Bellatrix, Voldemort prepared to attack her in revenge, prompting Harry to reveal his continued existence rather than continuing his attempts to attack from under his invisibility cloak.\n\nSometime after the Second Wizarding War, Harry married Ginny, becoming Molly's son-in-law and officially joining the Weasley family. He was also the father of three of Molly's grandchildren: James Sirius, Albus Severus and Lily Luna Potter.\n\nBecause of her friendships with Ron and Ginny, Hermione became friendly with the entire Weasley family. She spent portions of many of her summer holidays at The Burrow and attended some family outings with them, such as shopping for school supplies in Diagon Alley and the 1994 Quidditch World Cup. Molly was generally fond of Hermione, though she treated her coldly for a brief time after Rita Skeeter printed lies about Hermione toying with the hearts of Harry and Viktor Krum, much to Hermione's bewilderment and dejection. After Harry explained that the stories were false, she once again warmed up to Hermione.\n\nHermione became one of Molly's four daughters-in-law when she married Ron sometime after the Second Wizarding War. Hermione is the mother of two of Molly's grandchildren: Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley.\n\nThe Weasleys' reaction to Fleur (with the exceptions of Ron and Arthur) was initially lukewarm. They became more annoyed with Fleur when she and Bill became engaged, but tolerated her presence for his sake. In particular, Molly didn't like Fleur and was irked by the latter's criticism of her household or even her favourite singer Celestina Warbeck. When Fleur indignantly denied that Bill's disfigurement at the hands of Fenrir Greyback would affect their marital plans in any way, the Weasleys saw how deeply Fleur loved Bill and finally became more accepting of her. Molly convinced her aunt Muriel to lend her future daughter-in-law a tiara for the wedding. Fleur was noted as fussing over and being protective of Harry, Ron, and Hermione in a motherly fashion, similar to Molly.\n\nAfter the Second Wizarding War, Molly had three grandchildren through Fleur: Victoire, Dominique and Louis Weasley.\n\nMolly had a rather close relationship with Auror and fellow Order member, Nymphadora Tonks. Molly often invited Tonks to dine with the Weasley family and the young witch was always a welcome guest at the events held by the Weasley matriarch. Molly would at times get annoyed at Tonks due to her clumsiness, but never out of dislike for her. Rather it was mostly due to the fact that Tonks' attempts at helping resulting in her causing minor annoyances, such as setting off the Portrait of Walburga Black at 12 Grimmauld Place. During these times, Molly would attempt to dissuade Tonks from helping, so as to avoid such accidents.\n\nThough there was a significant difference in age between the two, Molly appeared to be Tonks's closest adult friend: She appeared to be the only person in whom Tonks confided her love of Remus Lupin. Several people suspected that Molly hoped her son Bill Weasley would fall in love with Tonks, rather than marry Fleur Delacour and Harry Potter noted Molly was acting somewhat frosty toward Lupin during the 1996 Christmas holidays, though he misinterpreted the reason why. He believed she was in a bad temper since she was to have Fleur as a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but in reality, she was displeased at him for his treatment of Tonks after she had confessed her love for him, and was annoyed at Remus for not accepting it, and making Tonks feel alone. Molly reacted heatedly to disparaging remarks made by Fleur in regards to Tonks, which is indicative of the high opinion she held for the young Auror. At the conclusion of the Battle of Hogwarts, it was Molly who duelled and killed Tonks' murderer and aunt Bellatrix, therefore avenging Tonks' death.\n\nMolly considered Albus Dumbledore to be the greatest wizard of all time. During the Second Wizarding War, she was technically the first new recruit of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation both founded and led by Dumbledore, having been asked to help battle against Voldemort almost immediately after his return was discovered. Along with most of the wizarding world, Molly was devastated by Dumbledore's death, and attended his funeral in 1997.\n\nRemus Lupin was close with the Weasley family, joined the re-instated Order, and saw Molly on a fairly regular basis. Lupin helped Molly get rid of a boggart that took the form of her family and Harry Potter dead; confessing to him that she was afraid of what would happen to her children and husband. Lupin comforted her, saying that he and the other members of the Order would take care of her family. After Dumbledore's death, Molly expressed her opinion that Lupin and Tonks should be together, as they loved each other, despite Lupin's protests that he was too old, too poor, and too dangerous for Tonks. During the Battle of the Seven Potters, Lupin saved George's life from Death Eaters, for which Molly was incredibly grateful. During the Battle of Hogwarts, Lupin and Tonks were killed, showing Molly grieving near their bodies.\n\nMolly initially believed Sirius Black (her \"cousin by marriage\", as his aunt Lucretia married her uncle Ignatius) was a murderer, who had betrayed the Potter family to Lord Voldemort in 1981, and didn't learn of his innocence until 1995. While both Sirius and Molly lived at 12 Grimmauld Place, they argued over the latter's tendency to be overprotective of Sirius's godson Harry: Sirius reminded her she wasn't Harry's mother, while Molly considered Sirius to be too reckless and reminded him that Harry wasn't his father James. Nonetheless, they got along well for the most part, as Sirius was thrilled at having the Weasley family and Harry Potter stay at Grimmauld place over the 1995 winter holidays. Molly was greatly saddened by Sirius's death in 1996 and was ultimately the one to kill Bellatrix, Sirius's cousin and murderer.\n\nMolly worked fairly closely with the late Alastor Moody and Kingsley Shacklebolt, being on good terms with both of them. She was shocked by Moody's death in 1997. Kingsley was responsible for saving countless lives when he sent his Patronus to warn the attendees of Bill and Fleur's wedding that the Ministry had fallen in 1997 and later became Minister for Magic, employing a number of the members of Molly's family.\n\nMolly was friendly with Minerva McGonagall, the former Transfiguration professor and Head of Gryffindor House, the house into which all the members of the Weasley family had been Sorted. The two discussed Dumbledore's death in 1997. McGonagall would have been Headmistress while several of Molly's grandchildren attended the school.\n\nThe Weasley family were all fond of Rubeus Hagrid, the gamekeeper and later Care of Magical Creatures professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He fought alongside Molly at the Battle of Hogwarts and they both survived the war. He appeared to be friendly with Molly's grandchildren, as seen by his inviting Albus to his house for tea.\n\nMolly seemed to be on good terms with Severus Snape, despite the fact that he disliked her children. However, she and her family obviously turned against him when they learnt he killed Dumbledore, but it was most likely that this changed when she learned of Snape's true loyalties from Harry. In addition, Harry and Ginny would later name one of Molly's grandsons after Snape.\n\nMolly is a diminutive form of Mary, the English form of the Hebrew name Miryam, the meaning of which is unknown, though theories include \"sea of bitterness\", \"rebelliousness\", \"wished for child\", and \"beloved\". In the case of Molly Weasley, however, the name is most likely derived from the term \"mollycoddle,\" meaning to \"to pamper or overprotect.\"\n\nThe surname Prewett is Welsh in origin. It is derived from the Middle English word prou, meaning \"brave\" or \"valiant\", and the suffix \"-et\", which implies smallness. Thus, it is believed to be derived from a nickname for someone small, but brave.\n\nWeasley is derived from the weasel, an animal J. K. Rowling is fond of. The term is especially appropriate for Molly, as a mother weasel is particularly protective of her young to the point that she will willingly take on animals several times bigger than her in defence of her offspring.",
