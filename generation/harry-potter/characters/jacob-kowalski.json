  "content": "Jacob Kowalski (born c. 1900) was a Polish-born[2] American No-Maj, who lived at 435 Rivington Street[7] in New York during the 1920s.[8][9] Jacob fought in the First World War.[10] After returning home to the United States, he found work in a cannery, but dreamt of becoming a baker.[8][9][6] On 5 December 1926, he went to Steen National Bank to apply for a loan of $2300,[1] but was turned down.\n\nWhile at the bank he met Newt Scamander, a British wizard who stopped in New York City on his travels to find and document magical beasts.[8][9][11][12] Through Newt he was exposed to the magical world, but had his memories wiped as was required by wizarding law.\n\nJacob would later go on to own a very successful bakery subconsciously inspired by his experiences with Newt Scamander's beasts and financed through silver from Occamy eggs provided by Scamander.\n\nIt was later discovered that the memory modification largely didn't work and Jacob ended up back together with Queenie Goldstein. Though the two were happy together, Queenie disagreed with Jacob's stance on his not wanting her to take a chance on him by breaking the law in marrying him. She bewitched him to make him want to be engaged to her, but the truth was revealed to him when they paid a visit to Newt Scamander.\n\nFollowing an argument with Queenie, he left with Scamander on another adventure, ultimately reuniting with Queenie, who had fallen under the influence of the philosophy of Gellert Grindelwald. While Queenie felt that Grindelwald's aims would allow the two of them to be together, Jacob was repulsed by Grindelwald, and watched sadly as Queenie joined with the Dark Wizard, leaving him behind, devastated and initially wanting nothing more to do with the wizarding world.\n\nThe urgings of Eulalie Hicks, however, prompted Jacob to re-enter the conflict, joining Dumbledore's first army and playing a role in thwarting Gellert Grindelwald's campaign to become Supreme Mugwump, despite his No-Maj status. In the aftermath of the election, Jacob married Queenie, who had defected back to his and Newt's side.\n\nJacob was born around the year 1900 in Poland.[1][2] He emigrated to the United States when he was young.[2]\n\nHe had at least one brother.[13] He also had a grandfather who kept pigeons,[14] and a grandmother who passed on her recipe for Pączki to him and instilled in him a love of baking.[15]\n\nJacob fought in the First World War.[16][17] He served in France as part of the American Expeditionary Forces, and remained stationed there for six years, not realising the war had ended. He later found out that it ended[18] and returned to the United States in 1924.[17][19] His brother also fought in the war, but was killed at some point.[13]\n\nStill being in Europe, he travelled to his home, Poland and gathered his relatives to a safe place and collected his family recipes from his grandmother and headed straight to United States of America on the first boat.[18]\n\nThe extended length of his military service left him able to find only a menial job at the Moreton Dale Canning Factory in his post-war life.[1][16][17] He thus applied for a loan on 5 December 1926 in the hope of getting the money he needed to realise his dream of opening a bakery.[1][17]\n\nBy late 1926, he was engaged to Mildred, but the engagement ended, as Mildred decided to break up with Jacob after he failed to gain a loan from the bank.[20]\n\nWhile visiting the Steen National Bank to secure a loan to set up his own bakery, Jacob met Newt Scamander when he arrived to find the Niffler that had escaped his suitcase. As Newt left suddenly to chase his Niffler, Jacob noticed that he accidentally left his Occamy egg behind. Before he could return it, Jacob was summoned to banker Gilbert Bingley's office. Jacob presented Bingley with his suitcase full of pastries, but Bingley questioned how Jacob would return the loan and pointed out that his proposed bakery would not produce the same revenue as a factory and thus rejected his application.\n\nAs he left the office, Jacob noticed that the egg was about to hatch and called out to Newt, who pulled the egg, and Jacob accidentally, with a Summoning Charm and Disapparated them onto the stairwell near the bank vault. Just as Newt recaptured his Niffler, Bingley arrived at the vault and, seeing the pilfered deposit boxes, mistakenly assumed that Jacob was trying to rob the bank, and sounded the alarm. Newt quickly placed a Full Body-Bind Curse on Bingley and Disapparated himself and Jacob to the outside of the bank just as the guards arrived. Subsequently, Newt tried to Obliviate Jacob, but the No-Maj unknowingly grabbed Newt's briefcase, hit him with it, and fled.\n\nWhen Jacob returned to his apartment without a bank loan, his fiance Mildred left him.[20] Shortly afterwards, Jacob placed the case down on his bed only to hear something protesting inside. As Jacob approached it, the lid opened and several magical creatures escaped, including a murtlap that attacked and bit Jacob. Following escaped billywigs, Newt and Tina Goldstein arrived at Jacob's apartment, finding it half destroyed and Jacob unwell due to a reaction to the Murtlap bite. Newt repaired Jacob's apartment to its original state, and Tina agreed to take Jacob with them to her place.\n\nAt Tina's house, Jacob met Queenie Goldstein who made them dinner and strudel. He and Queenie instantly connected with each other. In the evening, he watched Newt walk down into his suitcase and followed him after Newt invited him in. He met Newt's collection of creatures and heard about how Newt hoped to care for them as they were rejected by the wizarding world. Jacob wandered through various landscapes as Newt did a headcount of each creature to see which he needed to find. Jacob found an Obscurus which Newt described as a dark entity and advised Jacob not to touch it. They decided they needed to retrieve the missing Erumpent first and left the suitcase.\n\nHowever, Newt soon found out that his Niffler had escaped again. As they passed by a jewellery store, Newt spotted his Niffler inside. While Newt furiously attempted to capture the Niffler, Jacob noticed that a latch on Newt's suitcase had popped off and by the time he sealed it, Newt and the Niffler fell through the store's glass window. Subsequently, they were confronted by a squad of policemen, who were puzzled by the sight of the Niffler. Jacob then directed their attention to a lion wandering right by them, giving him and Newt the opportunity to Disapparate away.\n\nPassing an ostrich in Central Park, they soon discovered the cause of the loose animals: the Erumpent had broke into the Central Park Zoo, setting many of the animals free, in its search to mate with the zoo's hippopotamus. Newt provided Jacob with a helmet and vest to protect himself from the Erumpent and left the No-Maj to hold a vial of Erumpent musk while he performed a mating dance to lure the creature back into his suitcase. Unfortunately, Jacob accidentally spilled musk on himself when he was hit by a fish thrown by an escaped seal, prompting the Erumpent to chase him out of the zoo and into the frozen park pond before Newt managed to contain the Erumpent. However, when they got in the suitcase, Tina, who had followed them, locked them in and took them to headquarters of the Magical Congress of the United States of America, where they, including Tina, were arrested by Seraphina Picquery and Percival Graves.\n\nAs he was being escorted by Sam, an Obliviator, to have his memory erased, Jacob was saved by Queenie, who managed to blackmail Sam. Subsequently, they tried to break into Graves' office to retrieve Newt's suitcase, along with his and Tina's wands; Queenie unsuccessfully tried to use an Unlocking Charm, forcing Jacob to kick down the door. They subsequently ran into Newt and Tina, who had managed to escape execution. Queenie then had everyone hide in the suitcase so she could smuggle them out of MACUSA.\n\nThey journeyed to a wizarding speakeasy, The Blind Pig, where the friends met Gnarlak, a goblin gangster, to find information about Newt's escaped Demiguise named Dougal. While trying to get a drink at the bar, the bartender house-elf asked if Jacob has never seen a house-elf; Jacob blithely retorts that of course he has, his uncle is a house-elf. After discovering that Gnarlak had turned them in to MACUSA for the reward money, Jacob punched him in the face so Newt could retrieve his bowtruckle Pickett. They were forced to apparate away as a group of MACUSA agents mounted a raid.\n\nFollowing up on information gained from Gnarlak, they found the Demiguise at the Ginzberg Delaunay department store. Following it led to a hatched Occamy that was not accounted for, which had expanded itself to fill the entire storeroom. Queenie then hit a Christmas ornament with her foot and caused the Occamy to stress out and move around. Jacob helped to shrink the Occamy by luring it into a teapot with a cockroach.\n\nAfter returning the beasts to Newt's case, Jacob went with the group to investigate the Obscurus that was demolishing the city. Although Queenie wanted Jacob to stay out of the way, he insisted on helping and through her Legilimency skill, she saw the conflicts he endured during the First World War.\n\nFollowing a battle against Graves, Seraphina stated that Jacob's memory needed to be erased and gave Newt, Tina, and Queenie a moment to say goodbye to him. Jacob then stepped into the Obliviating rain, with Queenie giving him one last kiss under an umbrella spell from her wand before leaving him standing there alone and confused.\n\nJacob returned to his job at the Moreton Dale Canning Factory. One day, he bumped into a passerby. Upon trying to lift his now extremely heavy suitcase, he found silver Occamy eggshells provided anonymously by Newt as collateral for a bank loan. By March 1927, Jacob had opened his bakery, Kowalski Quality Baked Goods.[21] He baked various pastries and confections in the form of fantastic creatures, unconsciously modelling them after the beasts he encountered on his adventures with Newt. He was unaware of their origins, claiming that they came to him in dreams. The whimsical treats proved extremely popular and his bakery did a brisk business.\n\nOne day, Queenie visited the shop, possibly sparking Jacob's memories of his time with her.\n\nShortly after, Jacob was bewitched by Queenie and taken by her to Great Britain to get married, as the British Ministry of Magic allowed marriage with non-magical partners. They made their way to 9 Sherringford Square in London, where Newt was living to tell him of the news. Jacob told Newt that he had mostly good and average memories of what happened in New York and Queenie filled him in on what he did forget. Newt quickly realised that Jacob was under a love charm and broke it. Jacob was shocked and Queenie left the apartment in sadness.\n\nNewt informed him that he was in London, much to his shock. He caught up with Queenie and said that he loved her, but he knew that she would be arrested if they get married. His reluctance, and almost calling her crazy caused her to Disapparate, leaving him alone on the street. Devastated, he went back inside Newt's apartment to his friend packing after he found letter from Tina to Queenie. He realised that Tina was in Paris to search for Credence, who survived the battle in New York. He also promised Jacob that he would help him find Queenie, whom he guessed had travelled to France to find Tina.\n\nNext day Jacob travelled with Newt to Dartmoor, where Scamander gave fifty galleons to a Portkey tout and they both left England via Portkey. In Place Cachée Newt located the feather from the hat of a mysterious man and enchanted it to locate the man. Jacob and Newt followed the feather and it brought them to the café, where the French wizard introduced himself to them as Yusuf Kama. Kama took them to the Parisian sewers, where in his hideout he had imprisoned Tina. He also did the same with Newt and Jacob and said that he will release them, when Credence Barebone will be dead. Unfortunately, Kama unexpectedly fainted, so Newt released Pickett to unlock the lock in the gate freeing himself, Tina and Jacob. Coming to the unconscious wizard they heard a powerful Zouwu's roar coming from above their heads.\n\nThey pulled Kama out to the Alexander III Bridge, where Newt caught the beast into his suitcase. Kowalski holding unconscious Kama, seized along with Goldstein, Scamander's hand, thanks to which they apparated on Rue de Montmorency to Nicolas Flamel's house, the \"safe house\" address which Albus Dumbledore had given Newt.\n\nNewt pursued angry Tina, so Jacob stayed at Flamel's house to watch over Yusuf, especially after Scamander used tweezers to pull a water dragon parasite from Kama's eye. Jacob met Nicolas Flamel there and mistook him for a ghost, due to alchemist's age. Flamel's crystal ball informed him and Nicolas that Gellert Grindelwald called a rally for his followers at the Lestrange Mausoleum on Père-Lachaise cemetery, and that Queenie was going there. The ball also showed Credence heading to the Mausoleum when Jacob noticed that Kama had escaped, so he went to the cemetery despite Flamel's strong protests.\n\nIn the mausoleum Jacob was discovered by Yusuf. Kama ordered him to be quiet, because he was hunting Credence. When Credence and Nagini arrived, Kama wanted to kill Credence, but he was interrupted by Newt, Tina, and Leta Lestrange. Jacob witnessed Leta's story about how the Dark wizard Corvus Lestrange put Kama's mother, Laurena, under the Imperius Curse, and married her. She subquently gave birth to a girl named Leta. Jacob also witnessed the story of how Yusuf made the Unbreakable Vow with his father, Mustafa, to kill the person Corvus loved the most; how Corvus married his second cousin, Clarisse Tremblay, who gave birth to his son, who was supposed to be Credence Barebone, and how Leta proved that Credence wasn't Corvus because she switched the babies on the ship, while admitting to unintentionally killing Corvus.\n\nJacob attended Grindelwald's rally, which took place in the mausoleum. When Aurors under command of Theseus Scamander infiltrated the rally and one witch was killed, Grindelwald sent his followers to spread the word and began the fight by conjuring a circle of black flames around himself to divide friend from foe. Despite having seen a horrifying vision of the future Second World War, and being promised that Grindelwald would help prevent it from ever happening, Queenie urging Jacob to join Grindelwald and walk with her. Jacob tearfully refused Queenie, denouncing her new alliance and stood heartbroken. When Grindelwald attacked both Scamander brothers, Leta sacrificed herself to give Jacob and others time to escape. Tina seized Jacob and disapparated outside the mausoleum with him. As Queenie goes with Grindelwald, Jacob witnessed Newt Scamander saving Paris from the Protego Diabolica spell and followed him to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, joining in the alliance against Grindelwald.\n\nAfter Queenie left Jacob and went over to Grindelwald's side, he was left distraught and lost, with no direction.[22] He briefly sought assistance from a therapist, but was ridiculed when he relayed that he had been interacting with witches and wizards.\n\nOne night, while standing in his bakery, Jacob imagined seeing Queenie there. Moments later, across the street, he saw Eulalie Hicks reading a book and men seemingly harassing her. Kowalski left the bakery to help her, but Lally knocked out one the attackers with the Full Body-Bind Curse. It turned out the gang leader was Hicks' cousin Stanley, who owed her a favour. Jacob was furious, saying he was fed up with wizards, but Hicks eventually convinced him that since Queenie was on Grindelwald's side, they would need Jacob's help. The book Lally was reading opened and it turned out to be a Portkey.\n\nLally and Jacob were late for the Great Wizarding Express, so they used a Portkey to get onto it. In the train they met Newt Scamander, Theseus Scamander, Yusuf Kama and Bunty Broadacre. It turned out that Albus Dumbledore had gifted Newt with items that Scamander had given to each of them. Jacob got a wand from Snakewood with no core, so it had no power.[4]\n\nAfter arriving in Berlin, Yusuf and Bunty separated from the group, while Jacob, Newt, Theseus and Lally went to the German Ministry of Magic. There was going to be an event organised by the International Confederation of Wizards. Theseus, however, was kidnapped by Grindelwald's henchmen. Jacob, along with Newt and Lally, was trying to find out where Theseus had been taken. He suddenly spotted Helmut, Grindelwald's acolyte, who had ordered the kidnapping of Theseus. The man, however, was gone.\n\nLater, Jacob, Newt, and Lally met with Dumbledore, who commissioned Jacob and Lally to go to the Candidates' Dinner, as he suspected an assassination attempt might take place there.\n\nJacob and Lally went to dinner at German Ministry. Grindelwald soon arrived with his entourage, including Yusuf and Queenie. Jacob was calling for Queenie, but she didn't even look at him. Kowalski drank a glass of something stronger, ran into Grindelwald, and took out his wand. At the same time, Lally noticed that someone brought a drink to Vicência Santos. Jacob approached Grindelwald and ordered him to let Queenie go. Grindelwald, however, casted a spell on Jacob under the table, which made it look as if Kowalski had attacked him. Hicks saved Vicência's life because she broke a glass, the drink spilled on the wall and burned in it. Grindelwald made Jacob a murderer, telling everyone that he attacked him, and this was precisely the reason why the wizards had to unite against Muggles. Jacob and Lally used the Portkey book again to save themselves.\n\nJacob and Lally waited in the Great Hall. While at Hogwarts, Jacob sat down at the Ravenclaw table and ate with some students. A student tried to grab his wand but he had to describe that it was very dangerous and it shouldn't be touched by anyone.[4] Suddenly, Jacob saw Newt and Theseus who had just entered the Great Hall. Kowalski said how nice the children were and that a bunch of Slytherin students had given him sweets - as it turned out, they were Cockroach Clusters.\n\nJacob, along with Newt, Theseus, and Lally went to Hogwarts. In the Room of Requirement, Dumbledore was waiting there with Bunty. They were to be transported to the ceremony in Bhutan by the Qilin Ceremony Portkey, which was in the centre of the room. There were also five suitcases, one of which contained a Qilin. The remaining suitcases contained enchanted books, Bludgers, or Jacob's pastries. In case of trouble, they were to drop the suitcases, and the enchanted items would attack Grindelwald's henchmen.\n\nAfter reaching Bhutan, he separated from Albus. On the way, he saved Newt from two of Grindelwald's henchmen by hitting them with the suitcase. He also met Queenie, who he wanted to persuade to return, but she insisted that it was too late for that. Moments later, they were covered by Grindelwald's acolytes who are commanded by Vinda Rosier and led to the ceremony.\n\nDuring the ceremony, the reanimated Qilin bowed to Grindelwald, making him the new Supreme Mugwump. Jacob was dragged into the middle by Grindelwald as an example. After Rosier takes from him the wand Dumbledore had given to him and hands it to her master, Grindelwald said that Jacob was a Muggle who dared to fall in love with a witch. Something like that, according to Grindelwald, stained the magic blood and could not be allowed to, so he cast the Cruciatus Curse on Jacob.[23] The curse was stopped by Santos swiftly, however, leaving Jacob panting in Queenie's arms as she tearfully comforts him. When Newt pulled a second Qilin out of the suitcase brought by Bunty, Grindelwald's lie was revealed. The real Qilin bowed to Vicência, and there was a fight between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, which resulted in the latter escaping after he was confronted by the dozens present (bar his own followers of course), Jacob standing beside Queenie as she joins the confronters.\n\nSoon after, Jacob's wedding to Queenie took place at Kowalski's bakery in New York. Their wedding was attended by several friends, including Newt (who Jacob, because of their friendship, asks to be his best man), Theseus, Lally, Bunty and Tina, who has recently been busy in work roles, but had travelled to New York to attend the wedding as her sister's maid-of-honor. They stood in front of a wedding officiant with their friends behind them and took their vows, Jacob becoming husband to Queenie.\n\nMeanwhile, Albus Dumbledore watched them and their wedding from outside the store, before leaving the street.\n\nWhen he was a man in his mid- to late-twenties, he was of average height for a man of his time and had a stocky build. He had dark brown curly hair that was usually kept brushed and a matching moustache. He had dark brown eyes.[5]\n\nJacob was extremely warm, welcoming, compassionate, and friendly, with Newt Scamander noting that people tend to like Jacob, and with Jacob claiming that he wishes to become a baker to make people happy, despising having to work in a canning factory, due to that job being joyless. Hence, Jacob managed to swiftly befriend Queenie Goldstein, the somewhat socially awkward Newt Scamander, the somewhat prim Tina Goldstein, and later even the most famous alchemist in history, Nicolas Flamel.\n\nWhile initially disturbed by magic, Jacob, unlike most No-Majes, quickly came to admire and love wizardry, and was excited to learn more about the Wizarding world during his adventures with Newt, Tina, and Queenie. Jacob seemed to adjust to extreme situations relatively quickly, as he wasn't mentally disturbed after almost getting killed by an Erumpent or contending with an Occamy, and quickly overcame his fear of Nicolas Flamel's gaunt appearance, politely claiming that the ancient alchemist looked young for his age.\n\nJacob seemed to have poor self-esteem, viewing himself as unintelligent, and thinking that there \"are loads [like him],\" but Queenie assured Jacob that he is unique, before their first kiss. Jacob's unique ability to accept other people is a testament to this, as the likes of Henry Shaw Jnr were openly hateful of those lesser than themselves, while Jacob was pleasant and friendly to his fellow men. Moreover, Jacob had a good sense of humour, remarking that Gnarlak reminded him of his foreman after punching the goblin in the face.\n\nJacob was also very selfless, with a strong sense of morality, and an incorruptible spirit, shown when he willingly stepped out into the rain for Obliviation, when he refused to endanger his beloved Queenie by marrying her, and when he wasn't swayed by Gellert Grindelwald's visions of a future Second World War (despite being horrified by them, as a veteran of the First World War), and tearfully refused to join his beloved Queenie among Grindelwald's forces. The incredible bravery and fortitude demonstrated by Jacob in Paris, as well as the loss Jacob suffered, seemingly earned him the admiration and sympathy of Theseus Scamander and Nicolas Flamel.\n\nWhile he initially appeared timid and shy, Jacob is in fact, exceptionally brave, having served in the First World War, willingly braving many adventures at Newt Scamander's side, and even refusing to join Gellert Grindelwald's forces, despite the fearsome black fire threat as the alternative. Indeed, had Jacob been a wizard and attended Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he would have been Sorted into the house Wampus.[24]",
