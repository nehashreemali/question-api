  "content": "Bartemius \"Barty\" Crouch Junior (c. 1962 – c. 1996) was a wizard and the son of Bartemius Crouch Senior. He became an ardent follower of Lord Voldemort in order to become a Death Eater and Dark wizard in his teenage years.[11]  He was the first escapee of Azkaban prison in its almost 300-year history, though only his father, late mother and the family house-elf knew until 1995, when it was revealed to Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter, Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape whilst Crouch was under the influence of Veritaserum.\n\nIn 1981, shortly after Voldemort's first defeat, Crouch allegedly participated in the capture and torture of Frank and Alice Longbottom along with the Lestranges, using the Cruciatus Curse to drive the two Aurors to insanity. Crouch and his comrades were sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban for their crimes by his own father.\n\nCrouch and his parents hatched a plot under which Crouch's mother would take his place in Azkaban, using the Polyjuice Potion to disguise herself. She died and was buried in Azkaban, with the result that the wizarding world believed that Crouch himself was dead. Crouch spent the following years living under his father's Imperius Curse. He eventually broke free with the help of Voldemort, who had learned that Crouch was still alive, making him enter the Dark Lord's service again.\n\nHe then disguised himself as Alastor Moody, former Auror and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts during the 1994–1995 school year. In this role, Crouch fixed the Triwizard Tournament so that Harry Potter was chosen as a champion, and turned the Triwizard Cup into a Portkey that transported Harry and Cedric Diggory to Voldemort. Shortly afterwards, his identity was exposed, and Crouch was given the Dementor's Kiss by a Dementor that Cornelius Fudge had brought along with him.\n\nBarty was born in around 1962 or 1963 into the influential pure-blood Crouch family, which had strong connections to the Ministry of Magic. Bartemius Crouch Senior's intent on catching Dark wizards and becoming Minister for Magic likely played a role in him not paying enough attention to his son. It is very possible that this had an influence on the younger Barty's life choices.[12] His mother, Mrs Crouch, was a \"wispy looking witch\" who dearly loved him.\n\nBarty attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. According to his father, Barty achieved twelve O.W.L.s at Hogwarts, although Crouch Senior was delirious when claiming it.[13] It is possible that he knew many other Death Eaters and their allies at school, such as Severus Snape, Regulus Black and Lucius Malfoy, though his house was unknown.\n\nBarty took the Dark Mark in his late teens, and after Lord Voldemort's first defeat in 1981, he worked with Death Eaters searching for their fallen master.[11] He was captured with Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan Lestrange after they tortured the Aurors Alice and Frank Longbottom with the Cruciatus Curse, driving the couple into insanity.[14] Barty and the other Death Eaters were brought to trial before the Council of Magical Law, over which his father presided.\n\nBarty was insistent on his innocence, claiming he had not taken part in the crimes, and begged his father before the entire assembled Council and witnesses such as Rita Skeeter and his mother to clear him of the charges. Barty's father headed the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the time and was under extreme pressure to appear to be punishing the terrorism perpetrated by Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters. He also generally wanted to punish his son; he was very disappointed with him and it was a big embarrassment for Crouch Snr himself to have a Death Eater for a son. The torture of the Longbottoms was considered one of the most evil crimes recorded and used the trial as nothing more as to condemn his son.\n\nBarty's father chose to make a public example of his son, and sentenced him to a term of life imprisonment in Azkaban at the age of roughly nineteen. According to Sirius Black, the trial was no more than an excuse to show how much the father hated the child, as the elder Crouch went as far as to drown out his son's voice by shouting the announcement of sentencing, and Barty was screaming inside his cell for his mother for the first few days, but then quieted down from the extreme depressive influence of the Dementors, as did many other prisoners. Barty already looked in poor health when he was brought in, as Sirius described.[15]\n\nHis wand was also taken and stored deep in the prison.[9]\n\nIn 1982, his mother's health had deteriorated drastically from the stress of her son's imprisonment, as did Barty's own from the severe depression inflicted by the prison. The couple were allowed to visit due to Crouch Snr's high status in the Ministry and as Mrs Crouch's dying wish. She persuaded her husband to help smuggle their son out of Azkaban by swapping him for his mother. Using Polyjuice Potion, and undetected by the blind Dementors, Mrs Crouch took the place of her son. She died a short time later, and was buried outside the fortress under the guise of her son.[16]\n\nCrouch Jnr was brought back to the family household, where he was nursed back to health by their house-elf Winky. Revitalised, Barty's only goal is to search for his master, which he made no efforts to hide from his father. Crouch Snr, overcame with grief and guilt, sought long and hard to subjugate his wayward son, to protect his son's secret existence from public and to prevent him from searching for Voldemort. In the end, the elder Crouch was forced to use the Imperius Curse on his son when he found no other methods capable of the feat of controlling him, and forced him to hide under an Invisibility Cloak at all times. Winky was assigned to become Barty's caretaker and keeper, where she would constantly try to persuade his father to reward him for good behaviour (even if it was only a byproduct of the Imperius Curse).\n\nBertha Jorkins, a Ministry of Magic employee, accidentally discovered the truth when she came unannounced to the Crouch home with some papers for Mr Crouch to sign, in which she heard Winky talking with someone invisible, enough to deduce who was hidden. Crouch Snr rectified this with a Memory Charm so powerful that she suffered permanent brain damage. Shortly thereafter, Peter Pettigrew ran into Bertha while searching for Voldemort. In the hopes that she would prove useful to him, Peter tricked her into going with him. She ended up proving very useful to Voldemort; not only did he extract the whereabouts of his loyal servant, but also gathered information on the Triwizard Tournament, which was to be held at Hogwarts. Voldemort murdered Bertha, and the Ministry deemed her \"missing\" for months.[16]\n\nBarty was sent to the 1994 Quidditch World Cup under cover of the Invisibility Cloak along with their elf, Winky. Winky knew that Barty had always loved Quidditch and persuaded his father to allow him to go out and have some fresh air. Barty's mother, after all, wanted him to have freedom. Barty's seat, by chance, was in the top box directly behind the seats of Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. During the Quidditch match, Barty broke free of the Imperius Curse his father had placed on him. Denied of free will and magic for so long, he stole Harry's wand, which was in view poking out of the boy's back pocket. Winky did not see this, as she was so afraid of heights in the sky box that she covered her eyes for the entire Quidditch match.\n\nAfter the World Cup was through, Barty launched the Dark Mark into the sky over the campgrounds in reaction to the free Death Eaters making sport of Muggles. His anger stemmed from their lack of initiative in finding their master, which he yearned to do and yet was unable. Ministry officials fired multiple Stunning Spells through the woods, crisscrossing the area where Barty and Winky had been, rendering them both unconscious and breaking the spell Winky had used to bind Barty to her in the chaos. Winky was dismissed for being found with Harry's wand, which was proven to have produced the Dark Mark, as well as her guardianship being proven unreliable due to Crouch Jnr acquiring a wand and nearly escaping. Crouch Snr found his son's unconscious body behind the bushes, and recast the Imperius Curse on him after the other officials left, and the two returned home.\n\nLeft alone in the house with only father and son, one night shortly after the Dark Mark incident, Peter Pettigrew and Lord Voldemort suddenly appeared at the home. Voldemort needed a loyal follower to help him regain power, and easily managed to free Barty from his father's imprisonment. They put Crouch Snr under the Imperius Curse and forced him to keep working at the Ministry as he usually would and act like nothing was amiss.[16]\n\nAs part of his servitude as a Death Eater, Barty was charged with infiltrating Hogwarts Castle, entering Harry's name into the Goblet of Fire and guiding him through the Triwizard Tournament without having appeared to do so. Barty accomplished this by breaking into former Auror Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody's home and kidnapping him aided by Peter Pettigrew. He created Polyjuice Potion from Alastor's hair and concealed the Auror in his own magical trunk. He then proceeded to take over Alastor's job at Hogwarts, pretending to be him with the potion, teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts. He was able to maintain his disguise for months undetected by consistently sipping the potion from a hip flask; he did so in plain view of students and staff, and it was generally assumed that this was due to intense paranoia. He kept Moody alive under the Imperius Curse to continue harvesting hair for the Polyjuice Potion, and to question him about his personality, behaviour and knowledge, in order to make the act more convincing.\n\nUpon entering Hogwarts's Start-of-Term Feast with Moody's appearance, he received applause only from Dumbledore and Hagrid, both of whom stopped quickly after realising that absolutely nobody else clapped, as everyone was too fixated on Barty's scarred facade. Barty then ignored the jug of Pumpkin juice on the High Table and instead took a swig out of Moody's flask, administering a new dosage of the Polyjuice Potion while upholding his disguise's personality of fearing of being poisoned by food prepared by others.\n\nBarty used his time at Hogwarts to gain the trust of the students and staff at Hogwarts. During his first lesson for a group of fourth-year students, he demonstrated all three Unforgivable Curses on three different spiders[17] and controversially, later also the Imperius Curse on the students themselves, although he claimed to have had permission to do so, in order to teach them how to overcome it. As a teacher, Barty (under the guise as Alastor) was actually quite effective. Despite his ulterior motives, his teaching of how to overcome curses such as the Imperius was valuable with Harry Potter, who gained the ability to resist even Lord Voldemort himself as a result of this training. He was also a strict teacher, as he kept his students working until the end of the classes despite most of them being distracted by the Christmas festivities.\n\nDue to his effective teaching style, Barty became very popular among students and teachers alike. He entered Harry Potter's name under a fourth school into the Goblet of Fire, confusing it with a powerful Confundus Charm to ensure Harry's placement for Lord Voldemort's gain under a fourth school, ensuring he would be chosen as he was the only entry for said school. Barty subtly helped Harry throughout the three phases of the tournament. He nudged Rubeus Hagrid into showing Harry the dragons, later suggesting that Harry play to his strengths to pass the task and thus giving Harry the idea of using a broomstick to accomplish it.\n\nIn the middle of the first and second task, he attended the Yule Ball and danced the two step ungainly with Professor Sinistra, who was barely avoiding his wooden foot.\n\nHe complimented Harry's socks which were hidden under Harry's robes, which he saw through with his magical eye, provoking his dance partner, Parvati to call him creepy and say his magical eye shouldn't be allowed in Hogwarts.\n\nHe advised Cedric Diggory into telling Harry how to work out the golden egg clue, knowing that he would repay Harry for telling about the dragons. He also planted the book Magical Mediterranean Water Plants and Their Properties onto Neville Longbottom early on, hoping that Neville would tell him about gillyweed for the underwater task. With Harry's own pride and independent streak standing in the way of the plan, Barty had to improvise. Remembering that Harry mentioned having an elf friend named Dobby who gave him socks for Christmas, Barty called Dobby into the staffroom and staged a loud discussion with Professor McGonagall about gillyweed, right in front of Dobby. The house-elf responded by stealing the plant from Severus Snape's personal stores and giving it to Harry on the day of the task.\n\nDuring the events surrounding the Tournament, Crouch Snr escaped from his home and travelled to Hogwarts, where he wandered in his confusion in search of Dumbledore, planning on confessing about how he smuggled his son from Azkaban. Voldemort immediately sent an owl to Hogwarts warning Crouch Jnr that his father would likely show up at Hogwarts. Crouch Snr came upon Harry and Viktor Krum, but by then, he was so delusional and insane that he was unable to clearly convey anything beyond what appeared to be ramblings about his son and Bertha. The former went to the castle to fetch Albus. Crouch Jnr, having kept an eye on the Marauder's Map he borrowed from Potter, arrived at the scene before anyone else, and waited for Harry to leave before he stunned Viktor, and killed his father. He transfigured his father's body into a bone and buried it in front of Rubeus' cabin.\n\nBefore the third and final task of the Tournament, Barty volunteered to place the Triwizard Cup in a maze through which the contestants were to navigate. He took advantage of this opportunity to turn the Triwizard Cup into a Portkey. As he patrolled around the labyrinth hedge, he stunned Fleur Delacour and used the Imperius Curse on Viktor to get rid of Cedric, but Viktor was stunned by Harry. Nonetheless, Harry got to the Cup, along with Cedric, transporting them to the Little Hangleton graveyard when they grasped it together. It was at this time that Peter performed the ritual to restore Lord Voldemort's physical body, using Harry's blood, Peter's own hand, and Tom Riddle Snr's bone from the grave.[16]\n\nWhen Harry escaped the graveyard and returned to Hogwarts, Barty ushered him away from the panicking crowd to interrogate him about Voldemort's return. He revealed to Harry that it was he all along who guided him through the Tournament; he put his name in the Goblet of Fire, got Hagrid to show the dragons, explained the Golden egg to Cedric knowing he would tell Harry, bewitched Viktor Krum and stunned Fleur Delacour. Barty then planned on killing Harry and being honoured above the rest of Voldemort's followers.\n\nBut before he could, Albus, accompanied by Minerva and Severus, fired a Stunning Spell at him, having realised that he was not Alastor when he removed Harry from his sight — his one slip-up. After the Polyjuice Potion wore off, Barty confessed everything to Albus under the influence of Veritaserum, a strong truth potion.\n\nHowever, before he could testify before the Wizengamot, Barty suffered a fate worse than death, receiving the Dementor's Kiss by a Dementor that Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge brought with him for protection but instead kissed Barty on sight. Cornelius regarded Barty as a raving lunatic, believing that he merely thought that he was acting for Voldemort and thus was not convinced that the Dark Lord was back.[18]\n\nCrouch Jnr's soul removal marked the functional end of the Crouch family bloodline,[18] and what happened to Crouch's empty body following this, is unknown, although it is possible that Crouch died sometime in the mid-1990s; circa 1996.[2]\n\nThe younger Barty's death influenced his family's former house-elf Winky's depression, the motherly creature already mourning the latter's father and shocked further that his son was responsible, and her alcoholism with butterbeer continued for years because of this grief. She never really got over her respective masters' deaths.[19]\n\nDecades after his death, in the 2020s, Crouch Jnr's wand manifested during the Calamity as a Foundable and had to be returned to Azkaban.[9]\n\nIn his youth, Barty was described as being a pale young man with straw-coloured hair and freckles.[15] In his early thirties, he still had pale, slightly freckled skin and a \"mop of fair hair\", but his face was lined, and was much older-looking.[5] During his confession under Veritaserum, Barty's face would alight with diabolical mania. Being a Death Eater, he bore the Dark Mark on his inner left forearm.\n\nFor eight months, Barty disguised himself as Alastor Moody through the usage of Polyjuice Potion. During this time, his face would be covered with scars, with chunks of his nose missing, and dark grey grizzled hair. He also took Alastor's prosthetics, both the magical eye and wooden leg, for his own.\n\nBarty was shown to have been intensely hateful, diabolical, scheming, evil, vengeful, cold, cruel, manipulative, callous, loyal, extremely intelligent, sadistic, shadowy, very arrogant, cunning, selfish and ruthless. He was obviously a rather powerful wizard, having demonstrated sufficient magical ability to bewitch the Goblet of Fire into believing that four schools participated in the Triwizard Tournament in order for Harry to participate in the contest despite the object's power. Barty was also perceptively observant and, as mentioned above, exceptionally manipulative; his keen attention to the habits and motivations of others enabled him to impersonate Alastor Moody so accurately that he even managed to fool Albus Dumbledore.[5]\n\nDangerously clever and fearsomely determined, Bartemius proved capable of orchestrating the events of the Triwizard Tournament so that Harry Potter would be transported to Voldemort, in order to ensure his master's return. Barty's high intelligence also made him bitingly cynical and he remarked how easy some people were to manipulate — he was capable of concern for his plans, and expressed his fear that Harry would have failed the Second Task. He also expressed frustration for how slowly Harry progressed in Barty's plans, citing Harry's weakness of pride as the reason.\n\nBarty was extremely devoted to Voldemort and regarded him as a father figure. His loyalty was matched only by fellow Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange. He also seemed to know much of Voldemort's father, comparing him with his own father. This may imply that Barty was aware of Voldemort's status of being half-blood, but did not care, in contradiction to the Death Eaters' belief of pure-blood supremacy, or that Voldemort simply superseded the blood status. However, Barty's immense loyalty to Voldemort blinded him to those who truly loved him, namely his mother and the family's devoted house-elf Winky. They sacrificed much to give him a second chance at a happy life, which Barty tragically wasted in his obsession to reunite with Voldemort. As with many other Death Eaters, Barty had deluded himself into believing that he alone understood Voldemort, and that they were closest to each other due to their commons, to which was in fact not true as Voldemort never desired a friend nor understood human affections.\n\nOne reason for Barty's behaviour may be the fact that his father neglected him during his childhood and/or teenage years, and later forced him to spend years under the Imperius Curse in relative isolation, possibly affecting his mental stability. The year he spent in Azkaban also furthered his mental decline, due to the effects of the Dementors. He was also likely very sadistic, not only did he participate in torturing the Longbottoms, but forced their son Neville Longbottom to watch a demonstration of the Cruciatus Curse on a spider, despite the latter's bizarre and panicked response. However, this latter act could have been what the real Moody would have done himself, and possibly it was indeed to teach the students the harsh truths about the Curses.\n\nCrouch also loved Quidditch in his youth, a fact mentioned by Winky. Also, as a young man, he was extremely emotional, weeping and screaming before he was sent to the Dementors and pleading violently with his father to grant him leniency. He screamed constantly in Azkaban — but this can be supremely expected among the prisoners of Dementors. This could be seen as hypocritical, as he snarled at Death Eaters for hiding and refusing to brave Azkaban in Voldemort's name, which is what he did himself. However it could have been merely an act in an attempt to escape so he could continue his search for Voldemort, as he was shown to be a talented actor.\n\nBarty was one of the only known wizards to call Voldemort by his name 'Voldemort' instead of using 'the Dark Lord' or a different version of it, saying his name while talking to Harry after the Third Task. He was also the only known Death Eater to do so, besides Peter Pettigrew; even defectors such as Severus Snape and Regulus Black referred to Voldemort as \"the Dark Lord\", while fellow fanatically loyal Death Eater Bellatrix saw it as a sign of respect/fear not to speak the name.\n\nCrouch Junior was also shown to vehemently detest those who he viewed as cowardly, in particular Death Eaters who had abandoned Voldemort in order to protect themselves.[5] He also happily transformed Draco Malfoy into a ferret as punishment for attempting to attack Harry Potter from behind, showing he could be very sadistic towards those he disliked.\n\nBarty Crouch Jnr was very gifted and intelligent, whose potential as a wizard could be matched by only a select few. Armed with only the magical skills he had acquired throughout seven years of Hogwarts education, he successfully demonstrated sufficient magical ability to fool a whole school of learned academicians into believing him to be a seasoned Auror, speaking for his considerable skills. Additionally, Crouch swiftly came up with a feasible strategy to help Harry Potter win the Triwizard Tournament after he placed the boy's name into the Goblet of Fire. His intelligence has been vouched for by even Lord Voldemort, who while reluctant to trust Pettigrew, wholeheartedly entrusted Crouch to be the one to guide Harry to the rebirthing ceremony. During the Calamity, his appearance as an Adversary was what set the framework for the Lethal classification.\n\nCrouch Jnr's father, as a high-ranking Ministry official, spent his entire life dedicated to eradicating the Dark forces, and as such, didn't pay enough attention to his own son. When Crouch Jnr was caught with other Death Eaters at the crime scene of torture of Alice and Frank Longbottom to insanity, his father's parental affection extended to as much as giving him a trial, something he did not always give other suspects. In the end, the trial was merely to make an example out of his own son, and to publicly disown him, making clear he had nothing to do with anyone who would even remotely be connected to the committing of such a horrible crime. Crouch Snr mercilessly sentenced his own son to Azkaban for life.\n\nA little over a year later, the father, as a favour for his dying wife, smuggled him out of prison and kept him under control with the Imperius Curse for years to come. By Crouch Jnr's claim, his father loved only his wife and not him, but this was only in his own perception. The elder Barty's willingness to sacrifice his wife to spend her last days in the horrific Azkaban to rescue their son may be indicating that he retained some paternal affection for him, despite many believed otherwise. It was this sentence that cost Crouch Snr his chance to become Minister for Magic, his position as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and his wife to suffer her last few days in Azkaban. It was also this sentence that caused Crouch Snr to be demoted to the Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation. When the elder Crouch was subjugated by Voldemort and escaped, he decided to tell Dumbledore of everything, including that he smuggled his own son out of prison; it was during this moment that Crouch (in a delusive state) expressed his regret to Harry Potter of mistreating and neglecting his son, blaming himself for the young man's choice of life.\n\nCrouch Jnr, in turn, hated his father, considering him to be a very disappointing parent. Being sent to Azkaban for one year and imprisoned in his own mind for twelve only increased the friction between father and son. Crouch also claimed that he suffered the indignity of being named after his father and had the \"great pleasure\" of finally murdering him. Adding insult to injury, he transfigured his father's body into a bone and buried it, showing callous, but understandable disrespect for the corpse with a crude method of disposing it.\n\nHis mother loved him very much, and persuaded her husband to help him escape Azkaban. He also apparently had some affection for his mother as it is revealed that he was \"screaming for his mother\" during his early days in Azkaban. She was about to die when her son was imprisoned, so she drank Polyjuice Potion and disguised as him to take his place at Azkaban. She died a short time later, and was buried outside Azkaban. However, rather than start afresh and repent for his crimes, he tried to use the opportunity to look for Lord Voldemort and help bring him back to power, apparently his year in prison and hatred for his father caused him to forget his love for his mother, tragically wasting all of her efforts for him.\n\nWinky the house-elf was extremely loyal to the Crouch family, to the point of surpassing the mere house-elf's magical binding. She took care of Crouch Jnr when he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and became his carer and keeper. She was extremely devoted to this duty, and was very motherly towards him, asking his father to reward him occasionally for good behaviour (even though it was no more than a by-product of the Imperius Curse). Winky spent months to persuade Crouch Snr to let his son attend the 1994 Quidditch World Cup, and tried to suppress her acrophobia in order to keep an eye on the hidden convict. This all proved how much she loved him, despite his crimes. She was devastated when she was dismissed for failure, and became horrified when she heard of how Crouch Jnr killed his father.\n\nCrouch Jnr, on the other hand, thought that Winky's motherly nature was only out of pity and magic-bound duty. He launched the Dark Mark in the camp-site in order to scare disloyal Death Eaters, ignoring her efforts to keep him safe and hidden. He also showed no reciprocating affection for her as he ungratefully used her affections to achieve his goal of serving the Dark Lord, and gave a maniacal smile during his interrogation while she was there, the latter terrifying her.\n\nIn contrast with his real father, Crouch saw Lord Voldemort as a father figure of sorts, and after having been disowned by his own father, was fanatically devoted to him. In fact, at that point, Crouch was willing to sacrifice and give absolutely everything to serve the Dark Lord. He also believed that if he finished off Harry Potter, he would be welcomed back, closer than a real son and honoured beyond his dreams. In essence, Barty's loyalty is only matched (though in some ways surpassed) by fellow Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\nCrouch's loyalty had led him to know many things about Lord Voldemort that even other loyal Death Eaters, such as Bellatrix, presumably do not. Barty knew  that Voldemort had a disappointing father, that he suffered the indignity of being named after that father, and that he had the great pleasure of killing his father to ensure the rise of the dark order.[16] These three common threads helped to fuel Barty's loyalty. This also implies that Barty was  aware of Voldemort's blood status as a half-blood, but did not  care,  in contradiction to the Death Eaters' belief of pure-blood supremacy. Crouch was even willing to say Voldemort's name without fear, something even Bellatrix wouldn't do.\n\nIt could very well be that Voldemort told Barty these similarities between the two and used them as a way to get Barty to join him. Voldemort could have simply told Barty about his father being disappointing while neglecting to reveal that Tom Riddle Snr was a Muggle. Voldemort seems to have acknowledged Barty's worth, something his own father failed to do, referring to Barty as \"his most faithful servant\". However, for all of Voldemort's public claims, like all his minions he never truly cared for Barty any more than as a useful servant who is as easily disposable as any other, as Voldemort never wanted a friend. Although it is likely that he missed him for his usefulness and complete loyalty.\n\nEventually Barty held a violent hatred towards the Death Eaters who had abandoned faith in Lord Voldemort. He believed that those who would not brave Azkaban for him and denied their affiliation with him were unforgivable—apparently having completely forgotten that he was once like that himself as he screamed his innocence in the courtroom. Barty practically begged Harry to tell him that Voldemort punished the Death Eaters for their thirteen years of disloyalty, to hurt them for their lack of faith.\n\nDue to this fanatical loyalty held by Barty, he launched the Dark Mark into the 1994 Quidditch World Cup to frighten the Death Eaters who were levitating the Roberts family for fun, in retribution for their faithlessness, despite the risk of being caught. Also, during the year he was disguised as Alastor Moody, he spent a great deal of time intimidating former Death Eaters, Igor Karkaroff and Severus Snape, relishing the thought of being alone with them to kill them. This intimidation extended to Draco Malfoy, the son of another disloyal Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy. It's likely that he respected Bellatrix Lestrange as well as Rodolphus and Rabastan for their own loyalties to Voldemort. Bellatrix mutually respected Crouch for his loyalty to the Dark Lord, but due to her possessiveness towards him it's highly likely she felt jealous resentment towards Crouch. Crouch might have felt a similar respect for other incarcerated Death Eaters such as Mulciber and Travers, and those of his comrades who, like Evan Rosier and Wilkes, had died loyally in Voldemort's service.\n\nDespite his hatred towards them, Barty knew how to control his temper when necessary, and prevented himself from attacking them during his disguise as Moody. He even set aside his differences with Peter Pettigrew, one of the most disloyal Death Eaters, and the one responsible for Voldemort's initial downfall due to the information given about the whereabouts of the Potter family, in order to work together to revive the Dark Lord. Though it's also possible that he appreciated Pettigrew's role in finding their master in the first place, as well as helping to free him from his father's Imperius Curse, Pettigrew's neglect of guarding Crouch Snr may have nevertheless left another negative thought from Barty. Peter on the other hand seemed somewhat resentful that Voldemort compared him unfavourably to Barty in terms of skill and loyalty.\n\nAlthough Harry Potter was Voldemort's most hated enemy, Barty never showed open hatred for him, though this is assumed to have been an act. After Barty became more paranoid and fanatically loyal to Voldemort, Voldemort and Peter Pettigrew found Barty at his house. Voldemort freed Barty from the Imperius Curse and they plotted to murder Harry. Barty was the one who put Harry's name into the Goblet of Fire, while disguised as Alastor Moody. However, Barty didn't show that he was a Death Eater, and played the role of a friendly teacher towards Harry, giving him useful information about how to succeed in the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. He was also the one who taught the Unforgivable Curses to Harry, and the first person Harry saw performing the Killing Curse (besides Voldemort murdering Lily). Over the year Barty taught Harry, he kept the boy safe from harm, and chased away other people who would threaten or get in the boy's way, all for him to serve Voldemort's plan. Harry also saw Barty's trial in the Pensieve, and was told by Albus Dumbledore that it was unknown if Barty was guilty or innocent. It could be that the only reason Barty desired Harry's death was to appease his master, and held no personal grudge. In fact, Barty seemed delighted when Harry proved to be able to throw off the Imperius curse in class; however, this is ultimately debatable, and could have just been part of Barty's act. However, when Crouch exposed himself, he did state how annoyed he was at Harry's pride being a setback for the plan, which forced Crouch to improvise to compensate.\n\nBarty helped Harry with the Tasks of the Triwizard Tournament, because he had turned the Triwizard Cup into a Portkey in order to finalise the plan to resurrect Voldemort and eliminate Harry once and for all. When Harry and Cedric Diggory touched it, they were transported to the Little Hangleton graveyard. Cedric was murdered by Peter Pettigrew immediately, but Harry fought Voldemort and escaped. After that, Barty attempted to murder Harry, but failed, being caught by Albus Dumbledore, Severus Snape and Minerva McGonagall. Barty told them the story of his imprisonment, his escape and his return to Lord Voldemort (he was under Veritaserum at the time). He also told them that Voldemort would honour him as none other Death Eater. After that, Harry learned that Barty was given the Dementor's Kiss, which gave Harry a chill in the stomach at the thought.\n\nBarty would end up moulding Harry's future when he made a comment that Harry had what it took to be an Auror. Though he only said it as part of his facade, Harry took the compliment to heart and made becoming an Auror his ambition, which he followed through with following the defeat of Voldemort.\n\nBarty was one of the Death Eaters who tortured the Aurors Alice and Frank Longbottom into insanity[14] in order to make them tell where the Dark Lord was hidden. After that, the Longbottoms were permanently sent to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, and Barty was imprisoned in Azkaban along with the Lestranges.\n\nIn 1994, Barty met Neville Longbottom, the son of Frank and Alice, while he was disguised as Alastor Moody. When he read the name of Neville off-of the class register, he showed interest. He also performed the Cruciatus Curse on a spider, in front of Neville, who was shocked and frightened. After that, Barty invited Neville to his office for a cup of tea, and gave him a book about plants. In fact, Barty gave the book to Neville in order to help Harry Potter, who was Neville's room-mate, to help him in the Second Task of the Triwizard Tournament.\n\nIt is unknown how Neville reacted after he learned that his Defence Against the Dark Arts professor was in fact one of the wizards who tortured his parents into insanity.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore was one of the participants in Barty's Council of Magical Law trial. Dumbledore, like all of the participants, agreed to send Barty and his fellow Death Eaters to Azkaban forever. He was also shocked by what Barty did to the Longbottoms in 1981. Barty was disguised as Moody and went to Hogwarts, while planning to send Harry Potter to Voldemort. During the time Barty lived at Hogwarts along with Dumbledore, Barty used Occlumency in order to prevent Dumbledore from learning who Moody really was.\n\nIn 1995, after Harry Potter returned to Hogwarts from the Little Hangleton graveyard, Barty told Dumbledore that he would go along with Harry in his office, despite the latter's insistence that he not. In fact, Barty wanted to kill Harry and learn what had happened at the Graveyard. Dumbledore realised that he wasn't the real Moody, knowing that the real Moody would never have removed Harry from Dumbledore's sight after having been told not to, and ran at Barty's office. Dumbledore stunned Barty just as he was going to kill Harry. Harry noted that Dumbledore was in such a fury, that his eyes seemed like having a blue flame, and Harry realised why Dumbledore was considered the one wizard Voldemort always feared. Dumbledore was disgusted by Barty's patricide, as well as abusing and ignoring the love his mother and Winky gave him, and bound him up for it. After Barty's exposure, Dumbledore learned that he was given the Dementor's Kiss, and noted to the Minister that this was a poor move due to the destruction of a valuable piece of evidence, showing he still had some pity for what Barty became as it also meant the Crouch family blood line was permanently ended.",
