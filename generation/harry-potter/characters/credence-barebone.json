  "content": "Aurelius Dumbledore[12][13][5] (born c. spring 1900),[1] also known as Credence Barebone through adoption, was an English-born American half-blood[4] wizard who lived during the 20th century. He was the son of Aberforth Dumbledore and an unnamed woman. One year after his birth, he was unexpectedly taken to America with his aunt. Five years later at the Adopted Children Register, he was adopted by Mary Lou Barebone, the leader of a No-Maj anti-witchcraft group called the New Salem Philanthropic Society. Due to the repression of his magic from the amount of his abuse he endured, just like his aunt, Ariana Dumbledore, Aurelius developed a dark parasitic force known as an Obscurus and became an Obscurial twenty years into his life. While most Obscurials die before their tenth birthday, Aurelius lived into adulthood, which was previously unheard of in the wizarding world, and a testament to his incredible power.\n\nAurelius was sought after by Gellert Grindelwald, who wanted to use his power to kill Albus Dumbledore, whom he saw as the greatest threat to his revolutionary cause. While in search of his true identity, Aurelius heeded Grindelwald's call and joined his army. Dying as his own nature slowly poisoned him, Aurelius renounced his allegiance to Grindelwald and went home with his father, Aberforth Dumbledore.\n\nAurelius Dumbledore was born in at least spring 1900, to a Godric's Hollow girl whom his father, Aberforth Dumbledore, had a relationship with during the summer of 1899.[5] It is unknown if Aurelius was born in England or in France, despite the fact that he took a boat in France heading for America.[2]\n\nHis mother was \"sent away\" from Godric's Hollow, likely by her parents. During his first year of living there, Aurelius was taken care of by her and her sister. Aberforth's brother and Aurelius' uncle, Albus Dumbledore was aware of flowing rumours that the relationship had resulted in a child, but due to the distance between the Dumbledore brothers, Aberforth never confided in or sought Albus's help and/or advice with his family situation.[12][5]\n\nIt is unknown what happened to Aurelius's mother one year into his life, though, in 1901, baby Aurelius was taken with his aunt without Aurelius's mother on a ship heading to America. He was sound asleep when he was switched in the crib by a young Leta Lestrange for her half-brother Corvus because his crying was getting on her nerves.[14] The ship later sank during a storm and Aurelius was taken by Leta and Irma Dugard to a lifeboat. Their lifeboat was sailing safely, but the lifeboat his aunt and Corvus took capsized, drowning them both. Baby Aurelius was taken to America and was put up for adoption in Corvus's place by Irma Dugard unbeknownst to anyone but Leta,[15] at the Adopted Children Register at the New York Department of Health as number of entry.\n\nAurelius was in the Adopted Children Register for four years before he was adopted on 21 October 1905[1] by Mary Lou Barebone, an American No-Maj woman who led the New Salem Philanthropic Society, a hardline anti-witchcraft group.[16] At the Children Register she renamed him, Credence Barebone, raising him in New York at the Second Salem Church alongside her two other adopted children, Chastity and Modesty. Credence was the eldest of the three.\n\nWhilst under Mary Lou's care, Credence was physically and mentally abused by her in an attempt to suppress his magical abilities. She often used his own belt, leaving marks on his hands. The frequent abuse would lead to Credence developing an Obscurus and becoming an Obscurial.\n\nMary Lou considered Credence's birth mother to be a \"wicked, unnatural woman\", suggesting that she was aware of his heritage.[16]\n\nDuring one meeting, Mary Lou was physically abusing Credence but was suddenly magically assaulted by Auror Tina Goldstein. The open use of magic in front of a group of non-magic people required extensive Obliviation and was a major scandal.[17]\n\nBy December 1926, Credence was losing control of his Obscurus, and it manifested in outbursts that were wreaking havoc in New York. These disturbances were noted both in the Muggle press such as the New-York Clarion and the wizarding press such as The New York Ghost.[18]\n\nDuring that time, Credence came in regular contact with Gellert Grindelwald, who was assuming the identity of Percival Graves. Grindelwald seduced Credence into tracking down an Obscurial that he had seen prior due to a vision he had received, as he believed Credence to be connected to it somehow. In exchange, Credence was promised to be made free and taught wizardry.[19]\n\nOn 6 December, after a failed attempt by the Second Salemers to garnish the support of Henry Shaw Senior and being insulted by his son Senator Henry Shaw Junior,[20] Credence's Obscurus manifested later that night and attacked a fundraising dinner at City Hall, killing the senator as a result. This act of violence unwittingly exposed the wizarding world in front of the many No-Majs present.\n\nOn the next day on 7 December 1926, when Grindelwald visited Credence again, he gave Credence his Deathly Hallows necklace. The necklace was enchanted in someway, so it would allow Grindelwald to track the movements of the wearer. Grindelwald gave Credence the task that if he found the child, he must touch the Deathly Hallows symbol of the necklace, so he could easily locate him.[17]\n\nThe next day, Credence found a toy wand in Modesty's bedroom. Mary Lou immediately concluded that the wand belonged to Credence when she entered the scene, despite Modesty claiming it to be hers. As she prepared to beat him yet again, Credence's Obscurus burst free. The dark force killed Mary Lou and Chastity, also causing heavy damage to the house.\n\nStill in the form of Graves, Grindelwald arrived at the remains of the Second Salem Church and urged Credence to bring him to Modesty who had fled the destruction to her old childhood home, since Grindelwald now believed that she was the child that he foresaw.\n\nOnce there, Grindelwald told Credence that he had no further use for him and dismissed Credence as being a Squib, despite his promises. This betrayal caused Credence to reveal his Obscurus, to the surprise of Grindelwald. Although Grindelwald attempted to apologise and offered to train him, Credence willingly let loose, transformed completely into an Obscurus and went on a mindless rampage of destruction through New York.[16]\n\nPursuing him to the subway station, Newt Scamander managed to calm Credence down only to engage in a battle with the treacherous dark wizard before the Magizoologist could gain his attention. Provoked by the fight, Credence resumed his Obscurial form, though Tina managed to get him to stop once more. Rapported by the attack, Seraphina Picquery and Aurors from MACUSA arrived at the scene and proceeded to attack him with many spells, only stopping when they believed he was destroyed. However, a single shred of his Obscurus form fled the scene, unseen to anyone but Newt.\n\nThis attack resulted in Grindelwald's capture and the believed destruction of Credence. Ultimately, thousands of No-Majs were obliviated in order to protect wizarding secrecy.\n\nWithout anyone's knowledge, except Newt, Credence turned out to have survived, because an Obscurial could not be killed while in their Obscurus state. Credence, as a single shred, fled away from the subway station to the destroyed Second Salem Church. When all shreds of his Obscurus connected together, Credence returned to his human form. He desperately searched the collapsed building until he finally found what he was looking for: his adoption papers.\n\nSometime after finding the document he joined the Circus Arcanus, a travelling wizarding circus owned by a cruel ringmaster, Skender. Together with the whole crew, he sailed on the SS Ondine to Europe and ended settling in Paris. During his time in Europe, Credence befriended a Maledictus named Nagini, with whom he seemed to have a close relationship.\n\nSix months after the events in New York, Gellert Grindelwald escaped during his transfer to Europe and three months after that he also journeyed to Paris in search for Credence, in order to utilise his abilities to kill Albus Dumbledore.\n\nRumours surrounding Credence's identity began to circulate. Yusuf Kama believed he was Corvus Lestrange V, the son of Corvus Lestrange IV who Imperiused Kama's mother into marriage. Kama had made an Unbreakable Vow on his father's deathbed to kill who Corvus IV loved most, which he believed to be Corvus V.\n\nHaving had enough with their mistreatment, Credence and Nagini plotted their escape from the Circus Arcanus, where both Kama and Tina Goldstein had located him. Credence managed their getaway by releasing several of the beasts and fleeing in the ensuing chaos.\n\nFollowing this, Credence hid with Nagini at 18 Rue Philippe Lorand, being followed by Gunnar Grimmson, the bounty hunter. At that location Credence found Irma Dugard, the half-elf, whom he believed to be his mother, as her name was on his adoption papers. Dugard revealed that she did not want to give him up, and noted that she was merely a servant to the Lestrange household.\n\nAfter a brief moment of tenderness, Grimmson trapped Nagini in the wall to kill Irma on Grindelwald's orders to keep Credence's identity a secret from him. The Obscurus manifested and Credence attempted to kill Grimmson, but failed to do so.\n\nAfter that, Credence and Nagini were hiding in the house near the Eiffel Tower, where Credence was caring for a chick. Grindelwald tracked him down and offered him a chance to find out his true parentage. Credence, ready to learn the truth, accepted the map to the Pere Lachaise Cemetery given by the Dark Wizard.\n\nAt the Lestrange Mausoleum, Credence and Nagini crossed paths with Kama and Jacob Kowalski. Kama, believing that Credence was Corvus, prepared to kill him, but they were joined by Newt Scamander, Tina Goldstein and Leta Lestrange, Kama's half-sister. Leta insisted that Credence was not her half-brother, as the real Corvus Lestrange died. Leta recounted her father sending her and her brother to America on a ship. Wanting to relieve herself of her screaming brother, Leta swapped him with another baby on the ship, that baby being Credence. The ship sank before Leta could switch the babies back, and the real Corvus Lestrange drowned.\n\nAfter Leta's confession, Credence and others attended Grindelwald's rally, which ended in the Aurors storming against the host. Grindelwald created a circle of blue flames, an enchantment designed to test the loyalty of his followers: those who entered with complete fidelity would survive; those who did not would perish. Against Nagini's insistence, Credence entered the circle and joined Grindelwald, trusting that he had knowledge of his true identity.\n\nSometime later, at Nurmengard in Austria, Grindelwald revealed to Credence that the baby bird he had been caring for was actually a phoenix. According to legend, a phoenix will appear to anyone of the Dumbledore family in dire need. Grindelwald then presented him with a wand, and falsely claimed that his \"brother\" sought to destroy him, in reality part of Gellert's plan to use him to murder Albus, unknowing what truly happened that Summer in 1899. Grindelwald also stated his birth name: Aurelius Dumbledore.\n\nCredence was shocked at what he had just been told, and when Grindelwald left Credence alone to ponder over his new life, Credence gestured with his wand, sending a ball of light crashing through a window and then into a mountainside, causing it to collapse. Credence was left in sheer awe at the discovery of his magical prowess.[12]\n\nIn the span of the five years since learning he was a Dumbledore, he grew out of his black hair to shoulder length. His demeanour and the way he carried himself changed monumentally, he started to wear black clothes only, to show his change of himself as his master is Grindelwald.\n\nIn 1932, Credence was sent on a mission by Grindelwald to China to capture a baby Qilin. He reported it in person to his new master. Later, Credence had a conversation with Queenie Goldstein; she told him that Grindelwald regularly asked her to spy on the young man and tell him his thoughts, but she revealed to Credence that she did not tell Grindelwald everything. After that, Credence looked in a mirror and saw an inscription: \"Forgive me\", which he erased immediately.[5] Credence had been sending messages in that same mirror, desperately, now having his identity, for he now wanted to \"come home\", though, at first, he was unaware the recipient of his notes was actually his very own biological father.[21] One evening, Grindelwald watched Credence's phoenix circle around the young man; he told Vinda Rosier that it was Credence's pain that made him strong.[5]\n\nLater, Credence met his uncle, Albus Dumbledore for the first time in Berlin, Germany. Credence either killed or incapacitated a German Auror that was following Dumbledore into an alleyway with a green spell from behind; Dumbledore turned around to observe him, and kept walking.[22] On a Berlin street, Credence faced his uncle, and started a duel with him. At the beginning of the duel, Credence's phoenix flew past Dumbledore and Credence told him that the phoenix was there for him, not Dumbledore. Using his Obscurus powers, he tried to consume Albus but was rejected. He ran toward Dumbledore while his Obscurus followed, destroying the street.[23] Dumbledore ultimately overpowered Credence, but realised that he really was a Dumbledore - the son of Albus' brother Aberforth and thus Albus' nephew - after witnessing Credence's phoenix drop ashes on him. Expressing compassion for the young man's pain and his inability to help, Dumbledore helped Credence up and the two parted ways without further conflict.[5]\n\nAfter his encounter with Dumbledore, Credence managed to send a message to Aberforth Dumbledore that he wanted to come home and attempted to lie without success to Grindelwald about there being only one Qilin. By this point, Credence was slowly dying as his Obscurial nature poisoned him, the real reason that his phoenix had come to him, something that Dumbledore had recognised after having seen something similar with his sister Ariana, who was also an Obscurial. Dumbledore told Newt that unlike Credence, however, Ariana had never learned to express her magic before her death.[5]\n\nLater, in Bhutan, Credence helped Bunty Broadacre and Newt expose Grindelwald's attempts to become the new Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards. When Credence helped to reveal Grindelwald's deception with the Qilin, his phoenix flew overhead and dropped an ash onto the Dark Wizard's face which Credence then smeared with his thumb. After that, Grindelwald fired a spell at Credence. However, Albus and Aberforth blocked the attempt, saving Credence and breaking the blood pact.[5]\n\nAberforth was able to carry Credence down the stairs so he could sit down. In the aftermath, a weakened Credence shed a tear on his left cheek signifying he was feeling immense pain. He asked his father if he had ever thought of him and Aberforth assured Credence that he always had. Credence nodded choosing to accept his father's invitation to go home with him. Aberforth picked up and carried him down the stairs of the Eyrie, followed by his phoenix.[5] Despite Aurelius having found a place with his father, his uncle, meanwhile, was convinced that his nephew couldn't be saved due to his Obscurial nature poisoning him, meaning that young man only had limited time left despite Grindelwald's failure to kill him.[3]\n\nAurelius, now having recognised himself by his name of birth, was taken home back to Scotland, either to the Hog's Head Inn or Hogwarts Castle likely via Portkey from Bhutan, by his father Aberforth, followed by his phoenix, to be taken care of, despite his ailing health.[21]\n\nHe often appeared to be troubled, nervous, or embarrassed.[24][25][26][27] He also tended to stand with his head bowed. In 1926, he wore a bowl cut, with a black tie, a dress shirt, a brown striped vest, a fancy coat, a brown leather belt with a rectangle buckle, and black and white striped trousers.[8] In 1927, he cut his hair to a short, thin style with the same length all around and a scruffy beard. Wearing a reddish-brown dress long sleeve, and grey and black striped trousers.[8] In the 1930s, he grew himself long, silky hair, and wore a black velvet coat with a red tie, and a black leather vest.[5]\n\nCredence was described as \"troubled\" and \"mysterious\".[28][29] Shy and withdrawn, this made him far more vulnerable to the abuse that came in response to the slightest infraction of his adoptive mother's strict rules. His timid personality also made him susceptible to manipulation by Gellert Grindelwald, who took a personal interest in him.[30]\n\nHowever, when he was insulted or threatened, Credence's Obscurus form was unleashed. This Obscurus form was triggered by his negative emotions and experiences, and therefore was induced by them to act violently. This caused widespread destruction and death to those who provoked Credence. Namely, he attacked Mary Lou Barebone because of the abuse the latter inflicted on him for so long, and Henry Shaw Junior for the way the arrogant No-Maj politician had mocked him.\n\nAfter being nearly killed by over 20 MACUSA Aurors on the orders of President Picquery, Credence became embittered towards most of the magical community, and, desperate to survive, and learn his true heritage, he joined the Circus Arcanus and befriended fellow outcast Nagini. However, Grindelwald was once again able to manipulate Credence — taking advantage of the youth's desire to learn of his true heritage, Grindelwald convinced Credence to join his acolytes, convincing Credence so effectively that even Nagini was unable to dissuade him. After finally being given a wand by his new master at Nurmengard Castle, Credence accepted his true heritage as Aurelius Dumbledore, and seemingly agreed to help Grindelwald bypass the blood pact and kill Albus Dumbledore.\n\nCredence subsequently became a loyal acolyte of Grindelwald, but he retained much of his kinder nature. During a duel with Dumbledore, Credence let out his anger at supposedly being abandoned by Dumbledore who overpowered him and recognised that Credence was actually his nephew, the son of Aberforth who was \"sent away\" with his mother before or after his birth. Dumbledore's compassion towards Credence and his pain, which Dumbledore understood all too well after having seen Ariana go through the same thing, appeared to break Credence's allegiance to Grindelwald. Credence subsequently helped his father, uncle and Newt expose Grindelwald's lies.[5]\n\nWeakened and dying, upon meeting his father for the first time, Credence simply wanted to know if Aberforth had ever thought of him rather than expressing anger over Aberforth never being there for him. When Aberforth promised that he always had and extended an invitation for Credence to go home with him, Credence joined his father, having finally found the family that he had been searching for.[5]\n\nAs the son of Aberforth Dumbledore and a member of the Dumbledore family, Credence is naturally powerful, although for most of his life his magical abilities were suppressed due to the abuse of his adoptive mother. Unlike many Obscurials, including his aunt, Credence eventually learned how to express his natural magical abilities, proving himself to be a powerful wizard in his own right outside of his Obscurial abilities.\n\nAt birth, Credence, born as Aurelius, did not meet his father and was sent away alongside his mother. Therefore it would be decades before he would ever be able to truly meet and get to know Aberforth. Thus, Credence found himself with feelings of abandonment when he learned his true identity by his father and his paternal uncle Albus Dumbledore; Incidentally, Grindelwald had previously lied to the boy to make him believe that Albus and Aberforth were his brothers.[8]\n\nIn 1932, in Nurmengard, Credence communicated with Aberforth through a mirror. After his encounter with his uncle Albus Dumbledore, Credence managed to send another message to his father at the Hog's Head Inn, saying that he \"wanted to come home\". Later, in Bhutan, Credence helped Bunty Broadacre and Newt expose Grindelwald's attempts to become the new Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards. After Credence betrayed him, Grindelwald tried to murder the young man with the Killing Curse. However, Albus and Aberforth blocked the attempt, saving Credence and breaking the blood pact. After that, Aberforth was able to carry Credence down the stairs so he could sit down. Credence asked his father if he had ever thought of him and Aberforth assured Credence that he always had. Credence nodded choosing to accept his father's invitation to go home with him. Aberforth picked up and carried him down the stairs of The Eyrie, followed by his phoenix. \nAfterwards, Aberforth took Credence back home with him to look after him, despite his poor health.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore developed an interest in Credence and worked with his former student, Newton Scamander, twice in order to protect him from Gellert Grindelwald. It was unknown, though, if Albus was aware that the Obscurial he wanted to protect was possibly a lost member of his family. Though Grindelwald claimed that Credence was Aurelius Dumbledore, Albus's younger brother, this seemed unlikely as Albus's parents had both died before Credence was born. Later on, Credence agreed to help Grindelwald bypass the Dark Wizard's blood pact and kill Albus.\n\nIn 1932, Credence met his uncle, Albus Dumbledore for the first time on a street in Berlin, and they had a conversation about Credence's abandonment, for he still believed Grindelwald's lie that he and Albus were brothers. At the beginning of a duel, Credence's phoenix flew past Dumbledore and Credence told him that the phoenix was there for him, not Albus. Using his Obscurus powers, he tried to consume Albus but was rejected. He ran toward Dumbledore while his Obscurus followed, destroying the street. Dumbledore realised that Credence was really a Dumbledore - the son of Albus' brother Aberforth and thus Albus' nephew - after witnessing Credence's phoenix drop ashes on him. Expressing compassion for the young man's pain and his promise that he didn't know about his existence, Dumbledore helped Credence up and the two parted ways without further conflict.[5]\n\nLater, in Bhutan, with the help of his brother Aberforth, Albus protected Credence from the Killing Curse. Afterwards, Dumbledore watched as the phoenix followed Credence and Aberforth home.[5]\n\nUnknown to Mary Lou Barebone, the woman she believed to be Credence's mother was in fact the Half-elf servant of the Lestrange family, Irma Dugard. Dugard unknowingly ended up with Aurelius after the young Leta Lestrange switched him with her baby brother Corvus Lestrange. Irma later took care of the young Credence, signing his adoption paper and handing him over in the care of Mary Lou Barebone.\n\nCredence feared his adoptive mother due to years of emotional and physical abuse. She beat him with the intent of teaching him to suppress and be ashamed of his magical traits. By suppressing his magic, he developed an Obscurus. It was noted by Tina Goldstein that out of all Mary Lou's adopted children, Credence was the most hated.\n\nCredence learned over the years to willingly surrender his belt for a beating when he knew he did something wrong. He tended to be passive when it came to the beatings and he learned to take them submissively. Despite living in an environment where magic was shunned, Credence was drawn toward the ideas of wizardry and even entertained the thought of becoming part of the wizarding world. Mary Lou seemed to be aware of Credence's interest in magic and did not hesitate to beat him for it. When Mary Lou was about to attack Credence, he transformed into his Obscurus form and killed her.\n\nModesty was kind to her older foster brother, and he was close to her as a result. One of the reasons Credence shared a close relationship with Modesty was because she did not possess the same zealous attitude Chastity did in regards to their adoptive mother's anti-witchcraft stance.\n\nModesty was young and curious; she shared Credence's secret interest in magic. Because of this shared interest, they trusted each other. When Henry Shaw Junior meanly insulted Credence, she took his hand to reassure him. Modesty often witnessed the beatings he got from their mother and comforted him.\n\nModesty occasionally confided in Credence that she missed the nine brothers and sisters she had before she was adopted. When Credence found the toy wand under Modesty's bed, Mary Lou believed it to be his and beat him, despite Modesty's attempt at convincing her it was hers. This shows that she defended him when he was about to be whipped by their foster mother. After the Obscurus took control of Credence and killed their adopted family, she became fearful of him. Despite her immense fear of him, he showed no anger towards her and did not try to harm her, as she had been one of the few people in the world who had ever showed him any kindness, which he clearly respected her for.\n\nDuring his time at Circus Arcanus, Credence befriended fellow outcast Nagini. These two broken souls quickly developed a close relationship, due to their similarly tragic pasts. Nagini is Credence's only friend. After they escaped the Circus together, and wishing to stay together, Nagini assisted Credence on his quest to find out his true identity. At the time, Nagini became very caring and protective of Credence. An example of this is when she comforted him with a hug after they witnessed Irma Dugard's death, and refused to step aside when Yusuf Kama was at the point of killing Credence. Despite his friend begging him to stay with her, Credence joined Grindelwald's army in the end, leaving Nagini devastated and heartbroken afterwards. However, Nagini's devastation over losing Credence induced her to officially join the Global Wizarding War against Grindelwald.\n\nGrindelwald disguised himself as Percival Graves, and used Credence to try and locate the Obscurial terrorising New York, whom he believed was Modesty Barebone, promising him entrance into the wizarding world and training to perform magic. To Credence, \"Percival Graves\" was his only friend, and the only person who truly understood and supported him. \"Mr Graves\" thus healed Credence's hands, and comforted the youth when Credence confided in him about his mother's mistreatment.\n\nAfter the Obscurus attacked Mary Lou, \"Mr Graves\" told Credence he had no use for him, calling him a Squib, and pursued Modesty. Because of the emotional strain, Credence lost control over the Obscurus and, after \"Mr Graves\" realised it was him, offered his partnership and training in wizardry. Credence was deeply hurt by his manipulation, and angrily fled, now seeing Grindelwald as what he truly was. MACUSA's Aurors chased and attacked him, and when Newt and Tina attempted to calm him and protect him, Grindelwald interrupted them to provoke Credence to cause more destruction in the hopes of achieving a war between magical and non-magical people. Despite how he had earlier coldly dismissed Credence, it appeared that after Credence's magical heritage and power was revealed, Grindelwald considered him to have been unjustly treated by his mother and later the whole MACUSA, as he showed genuine emotions of rage when MACUSA destroyed Credence and later showed a level of pity when referring to how Mary Lou Barebone had nearly destroyed Credence.\n\nIt was revealed one year later that Grindelwald was so desperate to gain the New York Obscurial's allegiance because he believed that this was the only way for him to kill Albus Dumbledore without violating the blood pact, as Grindelwald believed that the Obscurial was the only wizard other than himself powerful enough to kill Dumbledore. As such, Grindelwald remains desperate to sway Credence to his side, promising to reveal the youth's true name and heritage to him. Ultimately, the desire to be his true self was too much for Credence to resist, so he joined Grindelwald's acolytes at the Lestrange family Mausoleum. Credence readily accepted \"Aurelius Dumbledore\" as his true name, as well as Grindelwald's gifts of a wand and a Phoenix, as well as seemingly agreeing to help Grindelwald kill Albus Dumbledore.\n\nIn the span of the five years since learning he was a Dumbledore, Credence continued to reside at Nurmengard, his master's castle. The young man subsequently became a loyal acolyte of Grindelwald, but he retained much of his kinder nature. During a duel with Dumbledore, Credence learnt that this master lied to him. After that, in the basements of Nurmengard, Credence attempted to lie without success to Grindelwald about there being only one Qilin, and Grindelwald violently attacked him. Eventually, Credence broke his allegiance to Grindelwald. In Bhutan, the young man subsequently helped his father, uncle, Newt and Bunty expose Grindelwald's lies. After that, Grindelwald tried to murder Credence with the Killing Curse. However, Albus and Aberforth blocked the attempt and saved Credence.\n\nCredence had an ambiguous relationship with Queenie, who provided Grindelwald with insight into how he should best approach Credence after he joined the Alliance. Both lived at Nurmengard as members of Grindelwald's Alliance. One day, Credence had a conversation with her in a room; she told him that Grindelwald regularly asked her to spy on the young man and tell him his thoughts, but she revealed to Credence that she did not tell Grindelwald everything. Later, at a dinner, Grindelwald asked Queenie to speak to Credence, as he knew that his student failed in his mission (which was to kill Albus Dumbledore). Grindelwald told Queenie that all he cared about was Credence's loyalty. In Bhutan, both Credence and Queenie ended up betraying and leaving their master.[5]",
