  "content": "Professor Pomona Sprout (b. 15 May)[2] was a witch who worked as Head of Hufflepuff House and Head of the Herbology department at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She attended the school in her youth, where she was Sorted into Hufflepuff and excelled at Herbology. Some time after her graduation, Sprout returned to Hogwarts to teach.\n\nDuring the 1992–1993 school year, Professor Sprout grew the Mandrakes that would later be used in the Mandrake Restorative Draught to cure those who were petrified by Slytherin's Monster. She also opposed Dolores Umbridge and her tyranny over the school in the 1995–1996 school year, which the rest of the staff were happy to join her in doing.\n\nSprout opposed Lord Voldemort during the Second Wizarding War. She voted for the school to remain open after the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, and assisted in ousting Severus Snape in 1998. She later took a group of students to the battlements during the Battle of Hogwarts and threw Devil's Snare and various other dangerous plants onto the invading Death Eaters.\n\nShe ultimately survived the war. By the early 21st century, Neville Longbottom taught Herbology, alongside her.[21] By summer 2020, Professor Sprout had formally retired from her position as professor of Herbology.[17]\n\nPomona Sprout was born into a wizarding family of unknown degree[4] on 15 May[2] in Britain or Ireland.[19] She presumably purchased her wand from Diagon Alley at the age of eleven, prior to attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\nShe was Sorted into Hufflepuff House[18] upon her arrival at Hogwarts and excelled at Herbology, which may have been taught by Professor Herbert Beery at the time,[22] and likely achieved a high-graded O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. in the subject.\n\nPomona and Minerva McGonagall's student time at Hogwarts overlapped by two years. Pomona was initially very homesick at Hogwarts, not having spent much time away from her parents at all. Minerva noticed this, and gave Pomona a Fanged Geranium, which she decided to name Gerald. It was because of this that the two students enjoyed an excellent relationship both then and in later years.[23][24] They also helped each other learn the subjects they eventually taught.[25] During her time at Hogwarts, she enjoyed attending Quidditch matches.[26]\n\nAt some point after her graduation, Sprout returned to Hogwarts as a member of the Herbology department.[6] She taught her classes in the greenhouses at the back of the castle[6] and used one of the greenhouses as an office.[27] At an unknown time, Professor Sprout became Head of Department and Head of Hufflepuff House.[20]\n\nProfessor Sprout used to bring the most interesting specimens, some of which could dance and talk, from the Herbology greenhouses to decorate Hufflepuff Basement. This was one of the reasons why Hufflepuffs were often very good in her subject.[9]\n\nProfessor Sprout was Nymphadora Tonks's Head of House[28] in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Sprout did not make her a prefect in her fifth year due to what Sprout deemed an inability to behave herself.[29] However, Tonks presumably surprised Sprout after she earned at least five N.E.W.Ts in her seventh year.\n\nSometime in between 1987 and 1990, Gabriel Truman, a third-year at the time, got into a duel with a Ravenclaw Prefect who argued that the famous Arithmancer Bridget Wenlock must have been in his own house, not Hufflepuff, as she was in fact. Gabriel felt he deserved a week's worth of detentions for his own actions, but Professor Sprout went easy on him, sending him off with a warning and a box of coconut ice.[9]\n\nProfessor Sprout experimented with dragon dung fertiliser over the summer of 1986, as she told a student during the first Herbology lesson of the 1986–1987 school year before setting the class to tending valerian sprigs. Towards the end of class, when Penny Haywood went to fetch a pot, she screamed as a werewolf burst from the stack. The class panicked until Professor Sprout cast the Boggart-Banishing Spell with her wand, revealing the supposed werewolf was a Boggart. Professor Sprout explained what a Boggart was and then dismissed the class to see Professor Dumbledore, as a Boggart had never appeared in the Herbology Greenhouses before.[30]\n\nAlso this year, she provided earmuffs to Penny Haywood and her friend in the Herbology Classroom so they could uproot a Mandrake to extract a hidden Chocolate Frog Card from its soil.[31] Later, while Penny's friend was helping Bill Weasley with Career Advice, Professor Sprout tasked Bill with teaching the student how to grow Leaping Toadstools in the Herbology Classroom to test his suitability as a Herbologist. Although the student's Toadstools were sickly and couldn't jump, Professor Sprout encouraged them, saying all good Herbologists learn from mistakes.[32]\n\nAt one point, she was concerned because Gerald was wilting. She initially thought the soil was poor and tried to acquire a new potting soil mix from Rubeus Hagrid. However, she was called away to a conference before the mix was ready, leaving Gerald in the care of Hufflepuff students and another student of an unknown House. They discovered Gerald was wilting because the magical friendship bond between Minerva and Pomona was fading, so they held a re-potting party to lift spirits and re-forge the professors' bond.[24]\n\nDuring the 1987–1988 school year, following a Dementor attack on Penny Haywood, Professor Sprout attended a meeting in the Headmaster's office with the other Head of House and Penny's friend, who revealed the attack was instigated by \"R\", a cabal of Dark wizards.[33]\n\nLater into the school year, after failing to grow an ailing Puffapod, Sprout secretly took to the Herbology Classroom the Mirror of Erised, where she saw herself surrounded by flourishing plants. Penny Haywood and her friend found the Mirror while searching for Dumbledore, and Sprout admitted taking it. Sprout and the students informed Dumbledore of the former's intentions. When they returned for the Mirror, it was missing, prompting the students to search for it.[34]\n\nSprout allowed the student, who was trying to feed a Niffler, to take edible plants and venison she fed to Snargaluffs, as she didn't know what Nifflers ate.[35] Later, she permitted them to take Lady's Mantle from the Herbology Classroom for a Beautification Potion, suggesting they seek Rubeus Hagrid for ginger root from his garden.[36] She also taught the student, Charlie Weasley, and Liz Tuttle how to cultivate Bubotubers for the Forbidden Forest.[37]\n\nOn 14 February 1988, Sprout taught fourth-year students the Herbivicus Charm to accelerate the growth of red roses for Valentine's Day.[38]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year, the student and Liz Tuttle came to her in the Herbology Classroom and requested she create a local rainstorm inside the classroom so an Augurey could fly. She created the rainstorm with meteolojinx recanto after the students sprayed some Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent on some Flesh-Eating Slugs that were attacking Mandrakes.[39]\n\nAlso during this year, while reviewing plants with fifth-year students in preparation for their upcoming Ordinary Wizarding Levels, Jacob's sibling asked Sprout about gathering seeds from a Venomous Tentacula, which she informed was both highly difficult and dangerous, informing them they were a Class C Non-Tradeable Substance.[40]\n\nDuring the 1989–1990 school year at Hogwarts, Sprout grew sage, dittany and lavender in the greenhouses, which she gave to a student to give to the centaurs in the Forbidden Forest. She explained the various magical properties of each plant to the student.[41]\n\nShe also attended the memorial ceremony for Rowan Khanna held in the Great Hall, in honour of Rowan Khanna following their death, where she followed Professor Dumbledore's lead in raising her wand in honour of the fallen student.[42]\n\nAlso during this school year, she ran out of Regerminating Potion, to which Severus Snape had his sixth-year Potions brew the potion for her in class.[43]\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year, in response to an invasion of Doxies that was swarming Hogwarts Castle and sending lots of students to the Hospital Wing with venomous doxy bites, Professor Sprout sought to help the situation by growing cowbane, hemlock, and tormentil in the greenhouses, the ingredients for Doxycide, so it could be brewed and used to eliminate the doxies. She had Chiara Lobosca, Barnaby Lee, and their friend harvest these plants in the Herbology Classroom.[44]\n\nProfessor Sprout was still teaching at Hogwarts by the 1991–1992 school year. Just before the start of the new school year, Albus Dumbledore trusted her to contribute to the defences of the Philosopher's Stone Chambers.[45] Sprout, being the Herbology professor, possessed considerable knowledge of plants and thus planted a large amount of Devil's Snare in her Chamber. The Devil's Snare in the chamber broke the fall of the one trying to get the Stone, but also tried to kill them. As the dangerous plant liked the dark and damp, the trick was to use fire[46] or sunlight[47] to force the Snare to retreat. If the victim struggled, however, the plant would tighten its grip until they were dead.[46]\n\nThat year, she taught her first-years three times a week in Greenhouse One and taught them how to care for various herbs and fungi.[6] The first lesson focused in recognising plants found in the Hogwarts grounds, using a copy of the Ingredient Encyclopedia as a reference.[27] Other lessons covered the Severing Charm[48] and the Fire-Making Spell.[49] Sprout also lectured her students about specific plants, such as Devil's Snare.[46]\n\nThat year, Sprout met the famous Harry Potter who was among the first-years she taught.[6] She was also present at the End-of-Term Feast where Slytherin lost the House Cup to Gryffindor ending their seven-year winning streak, which likely pleased her immensely along with the rest of her House.[50]\n\nAs the Herbology teacher, Professor Sprout was in charge of doctoring the damaged Whomping Willow by wrapping bandages around the broken branches after Harry Potter and Ron Weasley drove a bewitched car into it. On the first day of term, Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, gave her useless pointers and arrogantly made out that he was a better Herbologist than her, which made her look distinctly cross and not at all her usual cheerful self.[51]\n\nShe was further irritated when Lockhart took Harry out of the lesson to speak to him, rudely closing the door in her face before she could make her opinion known. That day, she taught her second-years how to re-pot a new growth of Mandrake, whilst also warning them about the teething Venomous Tentacula, giving the plant in question a sharp slap to make it withdraw the long feelers it had been inching over her shoulder.[51] This lesson and the Mandrakes would later prove to be very useful.[52]\n\nSprout and her colleagues were understandably unnerved by the opening of the Chamber of Secrets. After Mrs Norris, the cat belonging to Argus Filch, was found petrified, Professor Dumbledore decided that they were to use a Mandrake Restorative Draught to cure her.[52] Professor Sprout was put in charge of maturing her Mandrakes until they could be chopped up, stewed, and used by Potions Master Severus Snape for the draught.[52]\n\nSprout attended the Quidditch match between the Gryffindor and Slytherin teams, sat high up in the stands with Potions Master Severus Snape, Charms Master Filius Flitwick, librarian Irma Pince and Governor Lucius Malfoy.[53]\n\nWhen the Hogwarts faculty were informed of Ginny Weasley's abduction into the Chamber of Secrets in the staffroom, Sprout was utterly horrified, clasping her shaking hand over her mouth. When Gilderoy Lockhart entered the staffroom, Sprout and the other professors goaded Lockhart to enter the Chamber and rescue Ginny, knowing perfectly well he was a cowardly fraud who would soon flee the school, much to their delight. After that, McGonagall ordered her and the other two Heads of Houses to inform their students that the school was scheduled to close due to the kidnapping.[54] However, as Harry Potter thankfully rescued Ginny alive from the Chamber the same night, the school was kept open.[55]\n\nBy the end of the year the Mandrakes had reached maturity and the Mandrake Restorative Draught was completed and administered to those who were petrified: Mrs Norris, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Colin Creevey, Hermione Granger, Penelope Clearwater, and the ghost of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington.[55] At the Leaving Feast, Professor Dumbledore and the rest of the school applauded Sprout for her contribution in the brewing of the Mandrake Draught.[56] During the End-the-Term Feast, Gryffindor also won the House Cup for the second year in a row and Hagrid returned from his confinement in Azkaban.[55]\n\nThe next school year, the 1993–1994 school year, was relatively uneventful at Hogwarts. On 16 October, the Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs had Herbology class together, and Sprout taught them how to harvest Puffapod beans.[57] Ron Weasley accidentally dropped some of these beans onto the floor of the greenhouse they were working in and they instantly bloomed, earning him Professor Sprout's disapproval. During the same year, Sirius Black, a \"dangerous mass-murderer\",[58] escaped from Azkaban and tried to get into Hogwarts on two occasions.[57][59]\n\nOn Christmas, Pomona Sprout was one of the thirteen Christmas Feast attendants. During the Christmas feast she was privy to the tense conversation between McGonagall and Trelawney.[60]\n\nAt the Start-of-Term Feast of the 1994–1995 school year, Professor Sprout sat next to the Astronomy Professor Aurora Sinistra, with whom she spoke.[11]\n\nIn the first lesson of the school year, Sprout taught her fourth-year students how to squeeze pus from Bubotubers. Some of these students found this to be disgusting and Seamus Finnigan was not sure he heard her correctly. By the end of the lesson, each student had collected several pints. Sprout then gave the pints to the school's matron Madam Pomfrey, since it could be used to treat acne.[61]\n\nAt some point early on in the school year, Professor Sprout told Bartemius Crouch Jnr (impersonating the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Alastor Moody) how good Neville Longbottom was at Herbology. \"Moody\" then lent Neville some books on plants and fungi called Magical Mediterranean Water-Plants and Their Properties[62] and another called Magical Water Plants of the Highland Lochs.[63]\n\nThat school year the Triwizard Tournament was held at Hogwarts and one of the Triwizard Champions was sixth-year Hufflepuff Cedric Diggory,[64] whom Sprout knew very well.[8] Cedric was not the only Hogwarts Champion; Harry Potter had mysteriously been entered into the Tournament, an act which many in Hufflepuff perceived as an attempt to steal Cedric's glory.[64] As such, Professor Sprout seemed to act somewhat distant towards Harry.[7] On Christmas Day, Professor Sprout attended the Yule Ball where she danced with Professor Dumbledore.[65]\n\nAt the end of the year, Cedric Diggory was murdered during the third task of the Triwizard Tournament on Lord Voldemort's orders.[66] Harry Potter at the risk of his own life brought Cedric's body back to the school grounds. Sprout spoke with Amos Diggory and his wife, since she knew their son well as Head of his House.[8] She attended the Memorial Feast in Cedric's memory[67] and believed Harry and Dumbledore's claims that Lord Voldemort had returned.[68]\n\nThe following school year, Dolores Umbridge was made Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts by the Ministry of Magic in accordance to the Educational Decree Number Twenty-Two.[69] Umbridge was despised by the majority of the staff, including Sprout. When Umbridge interrupted Professor Dumbledore's welcoming speech in the middle of the Start-of-Term feast, Sprout was taken-aback and scandalised at the audacity, raising her eyebrows high enough that they disappeared into her hairline. During Umbridge's speech she was observed as exchanging a significant look with Professor McGonagall, both of them understanding the message that lay beneath the officious and flowery rhetoric.[70][68]\n\nThe Gryffindor O.W.L.-level class was lectured by Professor Sprout on the importance of the examinations during their first Herbology class.[71] Sprout also had the students make a practical exercise which involved using dragon dung fertiliser. She also set them a long essay for the following lesson.[71]\n\nSometime this year, Sprout held career consultations with her Hufflepuff fifth-years.[72] She also held mock O.W.L.s on the Herbology Greenhouses for those wanting to revise for the exams.[73]\n\nAfter Harry Potter took part in an interview for The Quibbler about the events at Little Hangleton the previous June, he was put in detention by Professor Umbridge.[74] The rest of the teaching staff, however, found the interview an act of bravery on Harry's behalf and, being forbidden of discussing it per the Educational Decree Number Twenty-Six, found other ways to express their feelings; Pomona awarded Harry twenty house points for Gryffindor for passing her a watering can.[74]\n\nThe teachers' capability of teaching was examined by Umbridge, as part of her duties as High Inquisitor. Sybill Trelawney, the Divination Professor, was sacked and almost dragged out of the castle by Umbridge. Albus Dumbledore, finding a loophole in one of the Educational Decrees, allowed the sacked Trelawney to remain occupying her premises on the North Tower. Trelawney was escorted back to the Castle by Sprout, Minerva McGonagall and Filius Flitwick.[74]\n\nWhen a mass breakout from Azkaban was announced in the Daily Prophet, Sprout read the article in the Great Hall on the subject with great consternation, and was so intent on doing so that she failed to notice she was dripping egg yolk into her lap from her breakfast spoon.[75]\n\nSprout managed to show Professor Umbridge her teaching capability and avoided being sacked herself.[74] She must have been relieved to have Umbridge removed from the school at the end of the school year, and would have welcomed Professor Dumbledore back as Headmaster.\n\nWhile giving out the student timetables on 2 September, Professor McGonagall remarked that Sprout was going to be delighted to see Neville Longbottom back with an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. in Herbology that school year.[76] To start off the year, she taught her sixth-years about various extremely dangerous plants. She also permitted them to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula bit them or seized them unexpectedly from behind.[77]\n\nNot long after, Sprout had her sixth-year class harvesting Snargaluff pods. She chided Harry, Ron, and Hermione for being slow; as they were still strapping on their protective gear (and talking), while Neville had already harvested his first pod. The trio's first pod bounced free while they were trying to open it, and rebounded off the glass roof of the greenhouse, knocking Professor Sprout's battered hat off.[78]\n\nIn late April of that school year, Sprout helped the new Potions Master, Horace Slughorn in picking some potion herbs. She left towards her Greenhouses after she had collected enough for Slughorn's third-year class, with some to spare.[79] Slughorn also proceeded to steal some Venomous Tentacula leaves while Sprout was not around.[80]\n\nAt the end of the year, the Battle of the Astronomy Tower took place, with the Death Eaters invading Hogwarts and fighting against the students, teachers, Aurors and the Order of the Phoenix. Professor Sprout likely participated, as did Minerva McGonagall, Filius Flitwick, and Rubeus Hagrid.[81]\n\nAfter Professor Dumbledore's death, Sprout met with fellow staff members Minerva McGonagall, Filius Flitwick, Horace Slughorn, and Rubeus Hagrid to discuss the future of Hogwarts. She was a staunch advocate of keeping the school open, stating that Dumbledore would have wanted it so. She also supported the suggestion that Dumbledore should be laid to rest at Hogwarts, though no Headmaster had ever received a burial there before.[82]\n\nSprout attended Dumbledore's funeral and led the Hufflepuffs down to the grounds where the ceremony was held, looking cleaner than she ever had been before; without a single patch on her usually battered hat.[83]\n\nOn 1 August 1997, the Ministry of Magic was taken over by Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters.[84] By the next school year, Severus Snape was made Headmaster of Hogwarts while his fellow Death Eaters, Alecto Carrow and Amycus Carrow became the Muggle Studies and Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers respectively.[85] Despite the school now in the grasp of Lord Voldemort, or perhaps because of it, Professor Sprout returned to the castle to teach and protect the students.[86]\n\nThe Carrows were put in charge of all discipline and punishments, though Sprout and the staff never sent students to them if they could avoid it. She also, with the other Heads of House, tried to protect the pupils from Alecto and Amycus.[87]\n\nOne night, after being woken up by Minerva McGonagall's cat Patronus, Professors Sprout, Flitwick and Slughorn, and, still in their night-clothes, went to find out what she wanted. They found Minerva McGonagall duelling Snape to the death, and, after being defeated, Snape then ran into a classroom, chased by Flitwick, Sprout and McGonagall, and flew out of the window, escaping them.[86]\n\nAware that Lord Voldemort would soon attack the castle, Sprout and the other professors set to defend the school and the students, noting that they could at least hold him up if not keep him out entirely and expressing a desire to see how the Death Eaters fared in combat with her deadly plants.[86] Sprout retreated to the greenhouses, collecting various dangerous plants, and, with the help of a dozen of her students (namely Neville Longbottom), lobbed Mandrakes and everything else over the battlements and onto the Death Eaters.[88] She took a troop of of-age students up to the Astronomy Tower, where they could easily work spells and drop plants such as Venomous Tentaculas and Snargaluffs.[88]\n\nDuring the hour-long break in the Battle, Sprout helped treat wounded fighters in the Great Hall.[89] Sprout also witnessed the duel between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort in the Great Hall. During which Voldemort's spell rebounded on him and Harry emerged the victor. After the duel Sprout, Flitwick, and McGonagall all reached to hug Harry at the same time, while everyone else joined in.[90]\n\nAfter the bodies of the deceased were moved from the Great Hall, a celebration feast was later held. However, no one sat at their proper house tables. Teachers, parents, residents of Hogsmede, students, and others were all jumbled up and chatting among themselves.[90] Sprout sat by Filius Flitwick and Horace Slughorn, fellow Heads of House. The three were chatting and drinking cups of tea.[89]\n\nSprout remained teaching at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as Herbology professor. By 2008,[91] her former student Neville Longbottom had joined the Herbology department and taught the subject alongside her. She oversaw the Sorting Ceremony at the beginning of the 2008–2009 school year with her fellow Heads of House, including Neville who had become the Head of Gryffindor.[21]\n\nDuring the Calamity, she was able to give twenty-three six-hour classes regarding everything she knew about Herbology and herbal remedies to members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force for increased recovery,[92] and co-teach along with Professor Flitwick on how different magical approaches, when combined with teamwork, could achieve devastating effects to enhance the efficiency of enchantments cast on a teammate.[93]\n\nBy summer 2020, Professor Sprout had formally retired from her position as professor of Herbology. Following her retirement, she met with a Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, informing them of some modifications she had made to their Greenhouse Charm that would enable it to be cast more frequently in succession. She later met with the same Calamity Investigator with further modifications to the spellwork of the charm, improving the investigator's technique and increasing the amount of ingredients the charm could produce.[17]\n\nThe same Calamity Investigator later attended a retrospective on Sprout's Hogwarts career, with the tales of her tenure at the school proving unexpectedly informative, providing lessons such as \"never turn back on a teething Tentacula\" and \"for best results, pick Lovage at dawn\".[17]\n\nDuring a Calamity surge in August and September 2020 focused on Grim Fawley's first year at Hogwarts, Sprout suddenly and clearly recalled an unfamiliar memory of a conversation with Grim in which he claimed to have developed enough influence over the Calamity to modify it and that the surge was almost entirely made of his memories of his first-year experience and his professors, with her relaying this information to Minister for Magic Hermione Granger.[94]\n\nProfessor Sprout was described as being a squat little witch with short, grey, wavy hair.[11] She usually wore a patched and battered hat. Her clothes were noted to almost always be covered in dirt and earth, and her fingernails were noted to be so filthy they would have made prim and proper Petunia Dursley faint in horror. Sprout also almost always had a smile on her face.[51]\n\nProfessor Sprout was noted to be very cheerful, positive, and loyal,[51] but was also very professional and just and would chide her students if necessary.[78] Thus, Sprout possessed all of the virtues and aspects belonging to Hufflepuff House. She was kind and nurturing to the students, and surely encouraged Neville Longbottom's penchant for Herbology because he was anxious to show her his Mimbulus mimbletonia.[95] Sprout was also the most maternal of all the Heads of House, an example being when she calmed and got all of the students back to bed after the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.[82]\n\nShe also seemed horrified when she learnt that Ginny Weasley had been kidnapped by Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk and taken into the Chamber of Secrets, clasping her shaking hand over her mouth in shock.[54] Professor Sprout was also very brave, always ready to fight for her side. During the Battle of Hogwarts, she did not question McGonagall's decision to defend Hogwarts and immediately sought to provide whatever assistance she could, collecting various dangerous plants to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters,[86] showing her utmost loyalty and dedication for defending her school and standing up for what is right.\n\nAs the Head of Herbology at Hogwarts, Professor Sprout was an accomplished and skilful Herbologist, as well as a powerful witch in her own right. Testaments to her considerable abilities were her proficiency in the subject she taught, and her participation of and survival of the legendary Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nThe relationship between Professor McGonagall and Professor Sprout dates back to when both attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The two students maintained an excellent relationship, which was kept well into their adulthood.[23]\n\nWhen Dolores Umbridge stood to speak during the 1995 Start-of-Term Feast after her introduction by Headmaster Dumbledore, the two professors were both taken aback at this, and even exchange glances of disapproval.[70] Furthermore, during the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May 1998, Pomona was shown to have similar traits and the same views on protecting the Castle against Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters.[86]\n\nPomona was always friendly with Neville Longbottom; she was quite impressed with his skill in Herbology. According to Alastor Moody (Death Eater Bartemius Crouch Jnr in disguise), Sprout told him that Neville had a natural skill for Herbology.[62]\n\nIn return, Neville always respected Sprout as one of his favourite teachers. In 1995, Neville became excited in the prospect of showing her his Mimbulus mimbletonia.[95] Neville helped Sprout to use Devil's Snare, Mandrakes, Venomous Tentacula, and Snargaluff pods to attack the Death Eaters in the last battle.[88] Neville eventually succeeded Professor Sprout as the Herbology teacher or taught alongside her.[16]\n\nBecause Cedric Diggory was a Hufflepuff student, Professor Sprout knew him well.[8] When Harry Potter became the second Hogwarts champion in 1994, he felt that she had became distant with him as she was supporting Cedric.[7] After Cedric Diggory was murdered by Peter Pettigrew on Lord Voldemort's orders, she spoke to his parents, as she knew him best.[8] It can also be assumed that during his memorial feast she felt a sense of tragedy in regards to his loss.\n\nPomona was usually kind to Harry Potter (as well as to his friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley).\n\nDuring the Triwizard Tournament, however, Sprout became somewhat distant towards Harry as she thought he was stealing Cedric Diggory's protagonism as Hogwarts Champion.[7] After Diggory's death, Sprout became friendlier to Harry once again.\n\nProfessor Sprout rewarded twenty house points to Harry Potter for his bravery in speaking out shortly after the publication of his interview on The Quibbler about the return of Lord Voldemort, saying that she was giving them to him for passing her a watering can (defying the position of the Ministry of Magic and Dolores Umbridge, then-High Inquisitor of Hogwarts).[74] In May, 1998, Sprout helped defend Hogwarts to give time for Harry to find Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem.[86][88]\n\nProfessor Sprout enjoyed a very good and professional relationship with the most of Hogwarts staff. Despite her respective strong friendship with Minerva McGonagall,[86] Sprout also very much respected Albus Dumbledore.[83] After the Headmaster's death, Sprout was distraught.[83]\n\nShe was always friendly with Filius Flitwick, the Head of Ravenclaw house and Charms professor. Both Sprout and Flitwick supported Albus Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix, although they were not official members. After the death of Dumbledore, Flitwick and Sprout (along with others) sat and discussed about it and about Severus Snape's disloyalty.[83] The next year, they both tried to protect the students from Amycus and Alecto Carrow and fought at the Battle of Hogwarts and survived.\n\nSprout also appeared to be friendly with Horace Slughorn, the Potions Master. In 1997, Sprout helped Slughorn pick some herbs for potions. She left towards her Greenhouses after she had collected enough for Slughorn's third-year class, with some to spare.[79] Slughorn also proceeded to steal some Venomous Tentacula leaves while Sprout was not around.[80] However, he fought at the Battle of Hogwarts with Sprout.[89]\n\nOther Hogwarts staff that she had a good relationship with were: Poppy Pomfrey, the Matron, Argus Filch, the caretaker, Rubeus Hagrid, the Care of Magical Creatures professor.\n\nIn Roman mythology, Pomona was the goddess of fruit trees, gardens and orchards.[103] Sprout is a verb meaning \"to begin to grow, shoot forth, as a plant from a seed\".[104]",
