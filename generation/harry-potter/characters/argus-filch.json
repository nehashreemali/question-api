  "content": "Argus Filch was a Squib and the caretaker of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry since around 1973. Filch usually wandered around the school corridors with his cat Mrs Norris, trying to catch students breaking the school rules and complaining about Peeves the Poltergeist.\n\nIn 1992, after Mrs Norris was petrified by Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk, Filch was furious; however, his cat was healed by the end of the year. In 1995, when Dolores Umbridge became High Inquisitor at Hogwarts, Filch gladly supported her. The next year, he was responsible for recognising Dark objects that were brought into Hogwarts.\n\nFilch helped the students evacuate during the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998 and participated in the battle himself. He kept his job of caretaker after the Second Wizarding War. Filch was also the only one of the Hogwarts staff to stay at Hogwarts Castle during the summer holidays.[11]\n\nLittle is known about Filch's early life. He was born to at least one wizard parent sometime before 1951,[1] presumably somewhere in the British Isles. Despite his magical parentage, Filch was a Squib, meaning he could not perform magic.[2]\n\nIn around 1968,[12] Filch joined the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,[10] succeeding Apollyon Pringle as the Hogwarts Caretaker.[13] Filch waged a constant war against the students and Peeves, the school's resident poltergeist.[14] He disliked the students and constantly hassled them over the littlest infraction and took delight in the doling out of detention-worthy write-ups.[15] By the end of the 1970s, Filch had already filled at least one thousand and fifty-six boxes with punishment records.[16]\n\nFilch lived in a dingy and windowless office containing filing cabinets with detailed records of all the students Filch had disciplined. A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch's desk. He always begged Headmaster Albus Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.[15] Filch frequently patrolled the hallways at night-time with Mrs Norris, his scrawny cat, hunting down students wandering out of bed and looking for excuses to give them detentions.[17] In his years as Caretaker, Filch learned all about the Castle's secret passageways and hidden doors better than anyone but the Weasley twins and the Marauders.[14]\n\nDuring the 1970s, Filch did many write-ups of James Potter and Sirius Black, occasionally accompanied by the names of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew.[16] Most of the write-ups were petty wrong doings. In the 1977-1978 school year, Filch, probably on a tip-off from Severus Snape, whose obsession it had become to expose his arch-rival, James, in wrongdoing, confiscated the Marauder's Map after the Marauders over-reached themselves and were cornered.[18] Filch stored the map in a cabinet marked \"Confiscated and Highly Dangerous\".[19] Although Filch was a Squib and could not make the map work properly,[19] he did know that it was called the Marauder's Map.[4]\n\nIn the 1984–1985 school year, Filch and Mrs Norris found the cursed ice. Suspecting it was linked to the Cursed Vaults, he was about to report to Dumbledore, but spotted Professor Snape first and told him instead. He brought the professor to the corridor where he found the ice.[20] Filch later approached a student towards the end of the year, asking them where they were going. When he realised that Jacob was their brother, he told them he should punish them while he still had the chance, given their brother's bad reputation.[21]  During this school year, Jacob's sibling tried to invite him to Rubeus Hagrid's birthday party, which was pretty successful and he attended the party, although Professor McGonagall considered it a miracle if he agreed to celebrate anything whatsoever.[22]\n\nDuring the 1985–1986 school year, Filch allowed Jacob's sibling and Penny Haywood to have Fang and the former's cat approach Mrs Norris, so Fang could overcome his fear of cats. Filch later took Mrs Norris to the pet gathering, telling her to behave after she hissed at Fang again.[23]\n\nDuring the 1986–1987 school year, he confiscated Jacob's notebooks in the Three Broomsticks Inn from Jacob's sibling on Snape's orders to confiscate all items related to the Cursed Vaults.[24] Following this, Jacob's sibling and Nymphadora Tonks conspired to scare Filch from his office to retrieve the notebook. They brought either a Nose-Biting Teacup or Fanged Frisbee from Zonko's Joke Shop, and after Jacob's sibling placed the prank device inside his office after hiding themselves with the Shrinking Charm, Filch opened the box containing the prank device which forced him and Mrs Norris to retreat, allowing them to read and retrieve the notebooks.[25] During the same school year, he also caught Jacob's sibling with Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington in the Potions Classroom. After insulting Sir Nicholas and threatening to report them, Sir Nicholas denounced Filch as a low-class bully and that he was supervising said student. After this, he was forced to award them ten house points, much to his and Mrs Norris's displeasure.[26]\n\nBy the 1987–1988 school year, he had been pranked three-hundred and forty-nine times in his caretaker career.[27] During the year, he helped Jacob's sibling with their quest to become a prefect by giving them advice on how to properly dish out punishments, something he thought Jacob's sibling didn't have the nerve or understanding of school rules to properly do.[28] Also during the year, he gave advice to them, Tulip Karasu, and Tonks about the best prank to pull on Rita Skeeter after the three cleared his office of frogs, which had happened due to one of Tulip's earlier pranks.[27]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year, the Marauder's Map was stolen from his office by a thief whom he suspected to be Peeves.[4] In 1989, when Valentine's Day was around the corner, Madam Pince, entrusted by Headmaster Dumbledore to organise the Valentine's Day Ball, talked to Filch about the arrangements. Filch was later approached by Jacob's sibling who was concerned about Pince's plan for the Ball and told him Pince loved gorgeous settings such as flowers, music, and refreshments instead. During their next meeting about the Ball, Filch brought it up and Pince was eventually convinced. On 14 February 1989, Filch attended the Valentine's Day Ball with Pince.[9]\n\nNear the start of the 1989–1990 school year, Jacob's sibling approached Filch in his office, where they asked him if he had seen their brother Jacob who had been spotted on school grounds. Filch first demanded they confess to having set off a Dungbomb in the Gryffindor common room, given their habit of trouble. After placating Filch, he told them he had not seen Jacob, but that he if he had, he would have loved to have sent him to the British Ministry of Magic in shackles. However, he did reveal to them he had heard rumours that he had been spotted in the Hogwarts Library.[29]\n\nThe Marauder's Map, brought back to be kept in Filch's office, was again stolen by Fred and George Weasley. They 'nicked' it during their first year after being hauled to his office for setting off a Dungbomb in a corridor.[19] The Dungbomb in the common room, which Filch at first suspected to be the work of Jacob's sibling, was also the work of the Weasley twins.[29]\n\nLater in the school year, Filch was speaking to Snape and Madam Pince in the Potions Classroom when he was introduced to Brazilian exchange student, Alanza Alves. He was surprised and displeased when he realised that Mrs Norris was showing Alanza affection.[30] Later during this school year, he caught Jacob's sibling and their friends on the Training Grounds at night after hours, and took them to the Headmaster's office for punishment.[31] Later in the year, Jacob's sibling and Merula Snyde interrogated Filch to see if he was the \"mole\" for \"R\" in his office. They attracted his attention by sticking a Blood Pop in Mrs Norris's fur. He let them go after threatening to send them to Dumbledore, taking Mrs Norris to see Professor McGonagall to clean her fur.[32]\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year, Filch was tricked into giving Madam Pince Hiccough Sweets, causing her to leave the library's Restricted Section unattended.[33] During this school year, he tasked Jacob's sibling with finding a missing Mrs Norris. She had got trapped in the roots of the Hogwarts Whomping Willow where she was found by Fang, and was returned to Filch promptly. Filch thanked the student for their help, despite his usually grouchy nature.[34]\n\nBy the 1991–1992 school year, Filch had Mrs Norris following Rubeus Hagrid every time he went up into the castle.[14] During the Start-of-Term Feast in the evening of 1 September, Filch stood by the double doors leading to the Great Hall as Headmaster Dumbledore gave his start-of-term notices.[35] On their very first morning of the school year, 2 September 1991, Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley managed to get on Filch's wrong side. Filch found them trying to force their way through the door of the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. Despite their truthful claims that they were lost, Filch did not believe them and threatened to lock them in the dungeons. They were saved by Professor Quirrell, who vouched for them while passing by.[14]\n\nOn 12 September, Draco Malfoy challenged Harry Potter to a duel in the Trophy Room at midnight. Malfoy, however, never showed up and instead tipped Filch that there would be students out of bed in the Trophy Room. Filch almost caught Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Neville Longbottom, but they successfully managed to hide in the Forbidden Corridor as Peeves refused to share any information with Filch.[17] On 8 November, Filch helped Professor Snape to apply bandages in order to dress the wounds on his leg after the Potions Master had been bitten by Fluffy.[36] On Christmas, Albus Dumbledore gave Harry Potter his father's Invisibility Cloak. Harry used it that night to sneak into the Restricted Section and research about Nicolas Flamel, which he knew was related to the Philosopher's Stone. After he opened a book that screamed, Filch arrived on the scene almost immediately but was unable to see Harry. Filch warned Snape at once and Harry, while trying to avoid them, hid in an unused classroom and stumbled into the Mirror of Erised for the first time.[8]\n\nAfter Harry Potter and Hermione Granger had carried Norbert to the Astronomy Tower, so that Charles Weasley's colleagues could take the dragon to Romania, Filch caught the pair roaming the Astronomy Corridor on their way back to Gryffindor Tower in the early hours of 10 May 1992.[37] The caretaker took them to McGonagall's office, where they were joined by Neville Longbottom and Draco Malfoy who had also been caught out of bed. They were given detention in the Forbidden Forest, along with deductions of fifty house points each.[38]\n\nOn 26 May, Filch brought the four students to Hagrid, who was assigned to lead them into the Forbidden Forest. Filch tried to frighten them, by telling that many dangerous creatures lived there. In contrast to this warning, Hagrid remained his jovial self and tried to assure all of them that they were safe.[38]\n\nAt the beginning of the 1992-1993 school year, Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley arrived at school, not via the Hogwarts Express, but in Arthur Weasley's Flying Ford Anglia; Minerva McGonagall, their Head of House, gave them different punishments. Ron had to help Filch polish the silvers at the Trophy Room without using magic for his detention.[39] Ron spent the evening of 5 September 1992 with Filch, and kept burping up slugs all over Tom Riddle's Special Award for Services to the School.[40]\n\nDuring the school year, Filch tried to improve his status as a Squib using a Kwikspell course. Of course, as Filch had no inherent magical powers, this was of little use. After the Gryffindor Quidditch team's practice on 24 October, Mrs Norris saw Harry Potter who was covered in soil and dirt. Soon, Filch discovered Harry and took him to his office; however, before he could punish Harry, Filch heard a loud crash and realised that Peeves had damaged a very valuable Vanishing Cabinet.\n\nHe left Harry and ran to find Peeves, excited that he might finally be able to persuade Dumbledore to throw Peeves out of Hogwarts. However, when he returned to his office, he learned that Harry had read his letter about Kwikspell courses. Filch was furious and kicked Harry out of his office, trying to convince him that the letter was not his, and ordering him not to tell anyone.[15]\n\nDuring the school year, a mysterious, dangerous monster roamed around the Castle and tried to attack Muggle-born students. The first individual to be attacked was Mrs Norris, Filch's cat, whom he had a very close relationship with. The cat was found petrified under a message written on the wall saying that \"THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE\".\n\nThis caused Filch tremendous stress and concern: he believed that Harry Potter was the one who petrified her, as he knew that Filch was a Squib. Severus Snape agreed with Filch, not because he had the same opinion, but because he wanted Harry to be punished. However, Dumbledore managed to convince Filch that Harry was not responsible, as he could not have performed such Dark magic, being twelve years old at the time.[2][15]\n\nAfter the attack, Filch frequently paced the corridor in which it had taken place, as though hoping for the attacker to return. He even put a chair against the wall to keep guard there. On occasion, he fruitlessly scrubbed the message with Mrs Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect. During this time, he became more vicious than ever, and wrote students up for things like \"breathing loudly\" and \"looking happy\".[2]\n\nSometime in January 1993, Moaning Myrtle flooded her bathroom after Ginny Weasley tried to dispose of Tom Riddle's diary in her bathroom. Filch shouted in a hysterical voice about all the work he would have mopping up all night, and ran to Headmaster Dumbledore, slamming a door behind him.[40]\n\nIn early February, Professor Sprout kindly assured Filch she would have Mrs Norris back in no time, as the Mandrakes, who were maturing for the Mandrake Restorative Draught, were already moody, secretive, and with acne.[40] Filch was also present when in a corridor with all the other staff when a new message from the Heir of Slytherin appeared on the wall stating that Ginny had been taken into the chamber and that her skeleton will lie there forever.\n\nAt the end of the year, Filch attended the End-of-Term Feast, reunited with his cat.[41] Mrs Norris was cured via the administration of Professor Sprout’s  Mandrake Restorative Draught, brewed with Professor Sprout's Mandrakes.[42] He learned that the one who petrified Mrs Norris was the memory of Tom Riddle, the one who controlled Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk.\n\nDuring the next school year, the alleged mass-murderer Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban and the Ministry of Magic stationed Dementors around the entrances to the grounds in order to protect the school and Harry Potter, which was thought to be Black's target.[43]\n\nOn 1 September 1993, Filch attended the Start-of-Term Feast, and stood in the raised platform by the High Table while the school choir and orchestra led a presentation of Something Wicked This Way Comes.[44]\n\nOn 31 October, Filch stood by the Entrance Hall checking the names of those going to the first Hogsmeade trip of the term. He later told Harry Potter off for wandering around on his own, which he thought suspicious.[45]\n\nLater in the evening of that same day, Sirius Black broke into the Castle and tried to enter Gryffindor Tower; this resulted in the destruction of the Fat Lady's portrait.[45] Filch helped secure the Castle on Professor Dumbledore's instruction, lowering the portcullis and bolting the front doors of the Clock Tower.[46] Filch searched both the dungeons,[45] the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery,[46] but found no sign of Black. Filch was also charged with restoring the Fat Lady's portrait,[45] and he did so expertly.[47]\n\nThat same year, Harry Potter was given the Marauder's Map by Fred and George Weasley, using it to sneak into Hogsmeade Village and walk throughout the castle, without Filch noticing him.[19]\n\nIn December, Filch attended the Christmas feast, in which he departed with his usual brown coat and wore a very old and rather mouldy-looking tailcoat.[48]\n\nAfter Sirius Black's second break-in in the evening of 5 February, Filch bustled around the corridors boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes.[47]\n\nBefore the start of the school term, Filch extended the list of forbidden objects within the school premises so that it included four hundred and thirty-seven items, including Screaming Yo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs.[49]\n\nThat school year, the Triwizard Tournament took place at Hogwarts. Delegations of students from Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and Durmstrang Institute came to Hogwarts in order to watch the Tournament and sign up to be chosen as one of the champions.[49][50]\n\nIn October, Filch underwent an extra-thorough cleaning of the Castle and acted ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes. On one occasion, he terrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics.[50] During the Hallowe'en feast on 31 October, Filch wore his mouldy old tailcoat and added chairs to accommodate Igor Karkaroff, Olympe Maxime, Ludovic Bagman, and Bartemius Crouch Senior at the Staff Table. Filch later brought the jewel-encrusted casket with the Goblet of Fire inside.[51]\n\nOn several occasions in December, Filch had to take Peeves from inside suits of armour, where he had taken to hide, singing Christmas carols with very rude lyrics of his own invention.[52]\n\nFilch attended the Yule Ball on Christmas night, where he stood alone with Mrs Norris on his arms humming the waltz tunes to his cat.[53]\n\nIn the night of 21 January 1995, Filch almost caught Harry Potter while he was on his way back to Gryffindor Tower after having been in the Prefects' bathroom trying to solve the golden egg riddle for the Triwizard Tournament. Harry sank into one of the trick steps and got stuck in it, making his golden egg break open and wail. Hearing this, Filch thought that Peeves stole the egg. This made him even more hopeful that Dumbledore would kick Peeves out of Hogwarts for it.\n\nFilch was then joined by Severus Snape when the two got hold of Harry's egg and the Marauder's Map. As Snape discussed with Filch, he wanted to take those objects in order to find who they belonged to (suspecting that they were Harry's). He also told him that someone had broken into his personal office.\n\nThen, Professor Alastor Moody (actually Barty Crouch Jnr under the Polyjuice Potion) appeared and made them leave, convincing them that no one was there, saving Harry and later giving Harry's things back.[54]\n\nAt the end of the year, champion Cedric Diggory was murdered, while everyone learned from Harry about Lord Voldemort's return. The Second Wizarding War began.[55]\n\nAfter Lord Voldemort's return, and as part of its campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter, the Ministry of Magic instated Dolores Umbridge as Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.[56]\n\nPrior to the start of the school term, Filch fastened the list of forbidden items to his office door in an attempt to make students read it. He also told Professor Dumbledore, in what he said was the four-hundred-and-sixty second time, to remind the students that magic was not permitted in corridors between classes.[56]\n\nFilch attended the Start-of-Term Feast in the evening of 1 September 1995 in which he stood by the double doors leading to the Entrance Hall, and listened attentively to Dolores Umbridge's speech. He apparently realised the Ministry of Magic was going to interfere at Hogwarts that school year, and clapped enthusiastically.[57] Umbridge was a sadistic woman who, like Filch, enjoyed torturing and punishing students. Thus, the caretaker started to support Umbridge and follow her orders.\n\nOn 7 September, Filch got a tip-off that Harry Potter was sending in a massive order of Dungbombs. When he got to the Owlery, he found Harry (who had just sent a letter for Sirius Black) and Cho Chang (who was sending her mother a parcel for her birthday).[7] Hermione Granger later speculated that this was Umbridge's doing, as she probably needed an excuse to read Harry's post.[58] But Cho vouched for Harry and stated that he was not ordering Dungbombs.\n\nWith the passing of Educational Decree Number Twenty-Three, which appointed Umbridge to the post of High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, the Ministry effectively started its interference at the school.[59] Umbridge started passing Educational Decrees to suppress and outlaw behaviour of which the Ministry did not approve.[60]\n\nIn the morning before the first school trip to Hogsmeade of the school year, Filch matched the names of those visiting the village to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to do so. When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though to detect a whiff of Dungbombs.[61]\n\nOn 7 October, Filch hung a copy of the Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four on the Entrance Hall.[57] He was also probably the one to affix the notices with the Decree on the noticeboards of the Common Rooms.[60] Filch also assisted Umbridge when she had Trelawney sacked, something he most likely took pleasure in, as it caused Trelawney great stress and reduced her to tears.\n\nOn Valentine's Day 1996, Harry Potter and Cho Chang departed for Hogsmeade together. Filch signed the students out in a queue in the Entrance Hall.[62] Later that same month, after Gryffindor's abysmal performance in their Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, the Slytherins sang Weasley is Our King so loudly and frequently that Filch banned the song from the corridors out of sheer irritation.[63]\n\nIn the evening of 20 April 1996, Marietta Edgecombe denounced the unsanctioned Dumbledore's Army to Umbridge. Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad then managed to catch the students leaving the Room of Requirement and Harry, head of the organisation, was taken to the Headmaster's office while joined by Umbridge, Edgecombe, Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall, the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge and his Junior Assistant Percy Weasley, and two Aurors.\n\nProfessor Dumbledore took full responsibility for the group, and was to be escorted to the Ministry, where he would be formally charged, and then sent to Azkaban to await trial for conspiracy and sedition. Dumbledore then incapacitated the Ministry officials, and left the school undetected.[64] The Ministry passed the Educational Decree Number Twenty-Eight overnight, making Umbridge Headmistress of Hogwarts.[65]\n\nUnder Umbridge, Filch walked around in an extremely good mood. He hummed creakily under his breath, under the prospect of the changes Umbridge had announced him. He was going to be permitted to bring back the \"old punishments\" and give students whippings, and she asked the Minister for Magic to sign an order for the expulsion of Peeves, the resident Poltergeist.[65] However, the counterattack against Umbridge was now in full force: much of the student body opposed both her and Filch.\n\nOn the former's first afternoon as Headmistress, Fred and George Weasley set off an enormous crate of Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs which spread all over the school. At the end of the day, Umbridge was dishevelled, sweaty-faced and soot-blackened from trying to extinguish the fireworks, and Filch set one of his brooms ablaze when he tried to swat at the fireworks in midair.[65] Harry Potter helped Dean Thomas mess up the clock in the Clock Tower, Colin Creevey sent the Inquisitorial Squad several rude Howlers in chocolate boxes, and Parvati and Padma Patil poured Babbling Beverage into the school loudspeakers.[66]\n\nSometime after the Easter holidays, Fred and George set off a Portable Swamp on the Fifth Floor Corridor, and left the school in a blaze of glory.[67] They did not leave instructions on how to remove the swamp and as such, Umbridge and Filch tried fruitlessly different means of removing it. The other teachers, who could have removed the swamp in an instant, preferred instead to watch Umbridge struggle. The area was roped off, and Filch was given the task of getting students across it to their classrooms in a small punt.[68]\n\nInspired by the twins' legendary flight to freedom, a great number of students wreaked havoc in the school: Lee Jordan[69] put Nifflers into Umbridge's office, which promptly tore the place apart while searching for shiny objects and leapt on Umbridge when she entered, trying to gnaw the rings off her fingers. Dungbombs and Stink Pellets were frequently dropped in the corridors, so that students performed Bubble-Head Charms on themselves to get a supply of fresh air.[68]\n\nDue to all those misdeeds, Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands, desperate to catch students in the act, but the problem was that there were now so many of them, he never knew which way to turn. He was aided by the Inquisitorial Squad, but odd things like antlers sprouting from their heads kept happening to its members.[68]\n\nNo one, however, could compete with the master of chaos, Peeves. On two occasions, he shut Mrs Norris inside a suit of armour, from which she was rescued by a furious Filch, yowling loudly.[68]\n\nAfter the skirmish between Umbridge and the Forbidden Forest centaur colony and the Battle of the Department of Mysteries on 18 June, Umbridge was confined to the Hospital Wing in what Madam Pomfrey said was a case of shock. Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term, having crept out during dinnertime in hope to depart undetected.[70]\n\nShe, however, met Peeves on the way, who chased her from the premises, whacking her alternately with Minerva McGonagall's walking stick and a sock full of chalk as the students and teachers watched.[70] Filch brought her her luggage, as she was stopped by a mob of Daily Prophet reporters who took pictures of her escape.[57] Filch was reportedly miserable, as he thought Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts.[70]\n\nUmbridge's Educational Decrees were abolished, as well as her Approval for Whipping, as Albus Dumbledore was reinstated as Headmaster, meaning that Filch never got the opportunity to inflict corporal punishment on the students.\n\nNow in open war, upon the students' arrival at the school on 1 September 1996, Filch was charged with checking the students and their possessions for dark objects with Secrecy Sensors. At one point, he confiscated a shrunken head from Vincent Crabbe. Filch also had the responsibility of checking all the owls to prevent potentially harmful objects from entering the premises.[71]\n\nDuring the Start-of-Term Feast, Albus Dumbledore informed the students that Filch had asked him to remind the them that there was a blanket ban on any joke items bought at Fred and George Weasley's shop, Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.[72] Filch, however, was hoodwinked by Fred and George's Owl order service, in which their products came disguised as perfumes and cough potions.[73]\n\nAfter Harry Potter's discovery of the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he learnt several new spells such as Langlock, a jinx that glued the victim's tongue to the roof of the mouth. Harry cast this jinx twice, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Filch.[74]\n\nIn October, Filch stood as usual in the Entrance Hall checking the names of students who had permission to go in a Hogsmeade weekend trip. The process took longer than normal as Filch triple-checked everybody with his Secrecy Sensor. Ronald Weasley demanded to know what did it matter if the students were smuggling Dark objects out of the premises, and his cheek earned him a few jabs with the Sensor.[74] When the students arrived after the attack on Katie Bell, who had touched a cursed necklace, Filch held his secrecy sensor aloft, but was dismissed by Minerva McGonagall who told him to take the necklace, wrapped in a scarf, to Severus Snape, the school's expert on Defence Against the Dark Arts.[74]\n\nOn 19 December, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger argued and speculated whether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other.[73]\n\nIn the evening of the Slug Club Christmas party, on 20 December, Filch caught Draco Malfoy lurking in an upstairs corridor, most likely going to the Room of Requirement to repair the Vanishing Cabinet. In an excuse to escape punishment, Draco told Filch he had been invited to Professor Slughorn's party, and Filch dragged him by the ear to Slughorn's office to see if his claim was true. Once there, Slughorn said that he had not issued him an invitation. Draco then told Filch that he was trying to gatecrash. Filch said that this did not make him happy, but the look on his face seemed to say otherwise, but as it was Christmas, Slughorn let Draco stay with no punishment.[73]\n\nIn the evening of 1 March 1997, as Rubeus Hagrid was escorting Harry Potter and Hermione Granger from the Hospital Wing where Ronald Weasley stayed after ingesting poisoned mead, Filch came across them threatening the students with detention. Hagrid vouched for them, but Filch rudely undermined Hagrid's authority as a teacher, with Hagrid insulting Filch for being a Squib in retaliation. The two argued loudly as Harry and Hermione hurried off on Hagrid's instruction.[75]\n\nOn 17 March, Filch did his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor as some of the sixth years departed the school for an Apparition lesson at Hogsmeade.[76]\n\nOn the evening of Aragog's funeral, Harry Potter, presumably as a consequence of having taken Felix Felicis, strolled the Castle on his way to Hagrid's cabin in the grounds without meeting anyone in his way. Upon arriving at the Entrance Hall, he found that Filch had forgotten to lock the front doors.\n\nHarry met Horace Slughorn by the Herbology greenhouses and told him this, in which the professor said he would be reporting Filch, as \"he's more concerned about litter than proper security\". As a result, Harry managed to take information from Slughorn about the Horcruxes Voldemort created in order to become immortal, and how he could destroy them.[77]\n\nFilch had been looking for someone to clear out his old punishment files, and when Severus Snape put Harry Potter in detention for hurting Draco Malfoy, he put Harry to work by making him copying out the misdeeds and punishments afresh and making sure that they were in alphabetical order without the aid of magic.[16]\n\nOn 30 June 1997, a small gang of Death Eaters managed to penetrate the magical protections around the Castle with the help of Draco Malfoy and an assault took place at the Astronomy Tower and the corridors beneath it. Snape joined them, and killed Albus Dumbledore atop the Tower[78] (in fact, Snape was a double agent and was working on Dumbledore's orders, meaning since Dumbledore was already slowly dying, Snape's killing of him was a mercy killing).[79]\n\nIn July, Argus Filch attended Dumbledore's funeral in an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothballs, paying his respects for the man who, despite their opposing views on student punishment, gave him employment as a Squib. During his funeral he sat next to Irma Pince, something Harry Potter took notice of, as he suspected a romantic relationship between the two.[80]\n\nOn 1 August 1997, the Ministry of Magic was taken over by Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters.[81] By 1 September 1997, Severus Snape was made Headmaster of Hogwarts while his fellow Death Eaters, Alecto Carrow and Amycus Carrow became the Muggle Studies and Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers respectively, as well as Deputy Heads.[82]\n\nThe Carrows were put in charge of all discipline and punishments, which were violent, including beatings and placing students under the Cruciatus Curse.[83] Filch was kept working at Hogwarts in his capacity of caretaker. It is unknown what was made of Filch, or even if he was mistreated by the Carrows simply for being a Squib. Apparently, Filch lost some of his duties, as punishment seemed to be given out exclusively by the Carrows and Severus Snape.\n\nIn the evening of 1 May 1998, Argus Filch was patrolling the corridors while Harry Potter and Luna Lovegood went to Ravenclaw Tower.[83] Later, after Lord Voldemort gained knowledge from Alecto Carrow that Harry Potter was in the school premises, the Heads of House started conjuring protective enchantments around the school, preparing to fight and waking up students. Filch, unaware of what was happening, came to Professor McGonagall shouting that students were out of bed. Frustrated, McGonagall sent him to do something constructive and find Peeves, for the Poltergeist would be helpful against the Death Eaters. Though clearly thinking that Professor McGonagall had gone insane, Filch complied.[10]\n\nLater on, Filch and Madam Pomfrey oversaw the evacuation procedure of underage students and of those not willing to fight, via the Room of Requirement.[84] The caretaker stayed in the Castle during the battle,[85] although it is unknown how, as a Squib, he participated in the battle; perhaps he stayed to tend to the fighters' injuries or to aid the Hogwarts forces with his extensive knowledge of the Castle layout and secret passages. During the first stage of the battle, Filch was left with a deep gash in his left arm.[85] During the one hour-long interruption in the battle, Filch was at the Great Hall, where his injuries were treated by Horace Slughorn.[85]\n\nWhen the Death Eaters marched to Hogwarts Castle with Harry Potter's \"dead body\", Filch stood by Pomona Sprout, Poppy Pomfrey, and Horace Slughorn with a gloomy expression on his face.[85] The battle recommenced shortly afterwards, and it all ended when Lord Voldemort was finally defeated and killed by Harry Potter in the Great Hall.[86]\n\nImmediately after the battle, Filch grimly looked at a large pile of rubble in the Entrance Hall, which he dutifully began trying to sweep up, while the fighters gathered in the Great Hall mourning over the dead and celebrating over their victory.[85]\n\nAfter the battle, he returned to his position of caretaker, as he was immediately seen sweeping near the Great Hall.[85] He presumably kept doing what he was used to: punishing the students and arguing with Peeves, even under the new Headmistress Professor McGonagall.\n\nAt some point following the battle, Filch became acquainted with the Hufflepuff students Grim Fawley and Constance Pickering. While Filch complained about Grim like he had about all other students, Grim still made sure that both Filch and Mrs Norris had presents under the tree during the Christmases he spent at Hogwarts, much to Filch's happiness. Constance, meanwhile, pranked Filch with a Flobberworm, although Filch was unaware she was the one who had done it.[87]\n\nIn the 2008–2009 school year, Filch was still working at Hogwarts. He caught a student hiding something which he was suspected was a Bombtastic Bomb Box. They denied it and escaped after which they ran into Daniel Page. He told them Filch was also after him for stealing ingredients from the Potions Storeroom, which he denied doing.[88]\n\nDuring a Calamity surge in December 2020, Filch became a Foundable, with members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force managing to return him to his original time. After his Foundable was returned, Filch was cleaning his chains in his office when he suddenly developed a clear memory of an adult Grim Fawley telling him to tell the task force that the surge was his doing and that the resulting Foundables were based on Grim's memories of Christmases spent at Hogwarts with only the ghosts and portraits of the Hogwarts founders for company. He also asked Filch to tell the task force that they were \"getting close\". Knowing that the conversation hadn't really happened, as he hadn't seen Grim since he graduated from Hogwarts, and wanting to respect the kindness that Grim had previously shown him and Mrs Norris, Filch visited the British Ministry of Magic and informed Constance Pickering of Grim's message.[87]\n\nArgus Filch was a rheumatic man[65] with hunched-shoulders[10] and a hunchback.[75] He had a horrible, pouchy[54] and pasty face[15] and bulging, pale eyes,[8] along with sunken, veined cheeks.[7] He had long hair with a bald spot on the top of his head and quivery jowls.[7] Skinny-ankled,[75] Filch would usually wheeze[14] and shuffle when walking.[15] He had knobbly hands and whenever he got the flu, a bulbous and unusually purple nose.[15]\n\nFilch usually wore a brown coat,[48] although on special occasions, he would wear a mouldy-looking tailcoat[48] or an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothballs.[80] At night, while not patrolling the corridors, Filch wore an old flannel dressing gown.[54]\n\nVery foul-tempered, cantankerous, and easily annoyed, Filch had an extremely unpleasant personality. Despite working at a school, Filch deeply resented the students and was greatly disliked by them in return,[14] and some members of the staff, as well. However, when called on to oversee the evacuation of the majority of the students before the Battle of Hogwarts, Filch led the children to safety without hesitation.[10] In keeping with his dislike for students and their inevitable tendency to create messes and disorder (which he, as caretaker, would get stuck cleaning up), Filch idolised \"the old ways\" of discipline and constantly lamented that he was no longer allowed to use corporal punishment.[38] Filch was obsessed with keeping the Castle neat and tidy, and was infuriated when students made a mess with potion ingredients, or forgot to wipe their feet.[15]\n\nHe was also very domineering, controlling and paranoid, as demonstrated by the numerous times he asked students what they were doing when they were simply wandering around in what he thought was a suspicious manner.[45]\n\nHe seemed to be bitter and embarrassed about not being able to use magic, as was demonstrated when Harry Potter accidentally discovered his Kwikspell letters in 1992.[15] Ron Weasley also suspected that Filch was always in such a foul mood due to his status as a Squib, and thus resented young wizards and witches as a result.[2] Filch also had difficulty in recognising potions, due to his lack of magical knowledge as he did not notice the love potions disguised as perfumes and cough potions by the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes,[73] nor did he notice the poisoned mead sent in by Madam Rosmerta (while under the Imperius Curse cast by Draco Malfoy), showing he was not particularly observant despite his obsessive personality.\n\nFilch also did not suspect anything that was from Rosmerta, another factor that would have permitted the necklace and poisoned mead to enter the castle as well as a flaw that Draco attempted to take advantage of.[78] His obsession with the castle's cleanliness led him to neglect actual security at times, as he forgot to lock the doors at least one time even in the more dangerous hours, something Slughorn reprimanded him for.[77] Likewise, his focus on maintaining the simple rules led him to be inattentive to the bigger picture, best demonstrated when he called out for students being out after curfew, not knowing that they were supposed to as Voldemort was approaching with his army. Professor McGonagall, aggravated by Filch's poor priorities, condemned him as a \"blithering idiot\".[10]\n\nHowever, Filch did occasionally show something of a sentimental side. He was extremely caring towards his cat, Mrs Norris, with Constance Pickering claiming that \"no one who loved an animal that much could possibly be all bad.\" Moreover, while he stated he would normally never be a \"messenger owl\" for anyone, he was willing to deliver a message for Grim Fawley due to his appreciation for Grim always making sure he and Mrs Norris had a present on Christmas when he was a student at Hogwarts, even claiming that he might have \"gone soft\" in his old age.[87]\n\nArgus Filch seemed so interested in punishing rebellious students in the old manners. It is rumoured that he used to clean the shackles in his office hoping the Headmaster would let him use them on students again one day. He also asked the Headmaster to let him use the shackles on Jacob's sibling as they were, in his eyes, very rebellious for facing the Cursed Vaults.[89]\n\nPossibly the only being in Hogwarts that Filch actually liked was his beloved cat, Mrs Norris.[2] She had dust-coloured fur and yellow, lamp-like eyes. Mrs Norris, like her master, was infamously bad-tempered with anyone but Filch himself. The two shared a strong bond that linked them somehow; anytime Mrs Norris spotted someone breaking a rule, Filch would arrive soon afterwards.[14]\n\nFilch talked to her and called her \"my sweet\".[17] When she was Petrified by Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk, Filch was devastated and started sobbing, which made Harry Potter feel slightly sorry for him, though he felt a lot more sorry for himself, fearing he might be expelled. Filch even threatened Harry after finding him standing by the petrified Mrs Norris, Dumbledore had to calm him down.[2] It can be assumed that Filch was grateful after Mrs Norris was cured.\n\nFilch fought a running war with Peeves, the Poltergeist, and the two were sworn enemies for more than twenty-five years.[10] Filch never ceased his futile efforts to get Peeves expelled from the castle, and Peeves never stopped taunting Filch.\n\nTo annoy Filch, Peeves would trap Mrs Norris in suits of armour,[68] drop chandeliers,[68] play tennis against the Castle walls in the middle of the night,[37] stick wads of gum in keyholes[90] and caused general mayhem, which Filch was later responsible for fixing and cleaning up. It is presumed that this on-going war between them continued after the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nThe twins Fred and George Weasley had as bad a relationship with Filch as Filch had had with Peeves ever since their first year. Sometime in 1989 or 1990, Fred and George let off a Dungbomb and were caught by Filch, who took them to his office and threatened them with his usual unpleasant punishments he always had in mind. The twins noticed a filing cabinet marked Confiscated and Highly Dangerous so, curious, they let off another Dungbomb in his office and \"nicked\" the Marauder's Map, which was stored inside that drawer, from him.[19]\n\nThe caretaker had punished them many times during their Hogwarts years, for their trouble-making. Among his many file cabinets documenting the punishments he handed out over the years, Filch had an entire drawer dedicated to the twins.[15] Upon the opening of the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, Filch has placed a blanket ban on all the joke items that could be purchased at their shop, but the twins managed to sneak past security by disguising all their Love Potions as cough potions and perfumes.[73]\n\nAlthough Filch disliked most students, Harry Potter was one of those he disliked most. In 1991, Harry and Ron managed to get on Filch's bad side on their very first day at Hogwarts School, when he and Ronald Weasley got lost and inadvertently tried to enter the out-of-bounds third-floor corridor.[14]\n\nThe next school year, Filch was furious when Harry learnt that he was a Squib.[15] Then, he believed that Harry was the one who petrified Mrs Norris, Filch's cat, as he was one of the few people who knew he was a Squib.[2]\n\nDuring the next years, Harry disliked Filch even more, especially when the caretaker took the side of Dolores Umbridge, during Harry's fifth year.[65]\n\nDue to his dislike of Filch, Harry twice jinxed him with Langlock in his sixth year, humiliating Filch much to the amusement of everyone who witnessed it.[74]\n\nHowever, Filch, in a way, helped Harry and the Order of the Phoenix defeat the Death Eaters, as he helped McGonagall call Peeves during the Battle of Hogwarts.[10] During the Battle, when the Death Eaters marched towards the Castle with Harry's \"dead body\", he was clearly solemn as he stood by Horace Slughorn, Pomona Sprout, and Poppy Pomfrey,[85] despite all their differences, as his death meant the victory of the Death Eaters. It is unknown how Filch reacted when Harry revealed himself to be alive and managed to defeat Voldemort once and for all.\n\nAs Dolores Umbridge was a sadist who enjoyed torturing students, Filch could relate to her views on a number of levels.[65] Also, as Umbridge granted Filch permission to torture misbehaving students,[67] whereas Dumbledore would never even think of such things, he had loyalty to her.[65] He was one of the few people who actually liked her at the school.[68]\n\nUmbridge had gone through great lengths to gain Filch's loyalty, such as giving him permission to torture, and to have Peeves dismissed, due to Filch's knowledge around the school's secret passageways being second only to the Weasley twins.[65] Otherwise, she did have a low opinion of him, telling him not to stun some enchanted fireworks and having it explode all over the place, when it was in fact her own doing. This also showed she was unaware of him being a Squib, which is rather ironic given Umbridge's hatred for non-magical people.[65]\n\nAs Severus Snape was a very strict and somewhat cruel teacher, Filch respected that and acted a loyal subordinate to him.[36] They both very much liked to give students a hard time, unfair punishments, and cruel aspects of such punishments.[74] Snape, however, did not show much respect to the caretaker, and simply treated him as a minion.[54] Furthermore, while Snape gave some leniency to students of Slytherin, Filch saw no such mercy with any of the students.[73] Filch was also caretaker when Snape was a student at Hogwarts.[16]  The one thing that the two absolutely agreed on was a mutual dislike of Harry Potter.\n\nDuring his tenure as Headmaster, Snape kept Filch working at Hogwarts despite his status as a Squib.[83] It is unknown whether this was for his loyalty to Snape, his long years of service to the school, or his ability to catch troublemakers through his extensive knowledge of the Castle's secrets.\n\nHarry Potter once speculated that there was \"something going on\" romantically between Filch and Irma Pince, the equally ancient and irascible Hogwarts librarian.[73] Unbeknownst to Harry, Filch and Pince had indeed shared a romantic relationship starting in 1989, when the two attended the Valentine's Day Ball together.[9] It's unclear whether the relationship was still going on by the time Harry attended Hogwarts, but he did see them stay together at Dumbledore's funeral.[80]\n\nHe admitted he liked that \"Madam Pince won't stand for rule breaking\" and he liked it \"in a witch\".[29]\n\nFilch's relationship with most professors was unknown. The only thing that is known is that he respected many of them, and did what they say without question.[73][74] Most of the staff appeared to dislike Filch's grumpy and antipathetic personality, such as Minerva McGonagall, who could often be irritated by his behaviour (to the point of forgoing her usual politeness with fellow staff by calling him a \"blithering idiot\"),[10] and Horace Slughorn, who intended to report him for being more concerned about cleaning up than with the students' security.[77] Slughorn seemed to have, however, put their differences aside when he tended to Filch's injuries during the Battle of Hogwarts.[85] Others, like Pomona Sprout, were sympathetic and kind towards him.[40]\n\nFilch also appeared to respect Headmaster Albus Dumbledore very much. Dumbledore appeared to like Filch, although the latter was unpleasant. When Filch's cat, Mrs Norris, was petrified, Dumbledore seemed to care about Filch and his cat.[2] However, Filch did always plead to Dumbledore to permit him to use corporeal punishments on the students, a request that was never granted, which became a primary reason why Filch preferred Umbridge as head of the school.\n\nFilch disliked Rubeus Hagrid, the Gamekeeper and later Care of Magical Creatures professor.[75] Filch thought that Hagrid was an oaf, and he also told Mrs Norris, his cat, to watch Hagrid when he entered the castle.[14] Filch also did not care for Hagrid as a professor and treated him as if he were inferior, possibly because he was half-giant.[75] Hagrid, on his side, insulted Filch, calling him \"that old git\",[14] and a \"sneakin' Squib\", when the latter insulted him.[75]\n\nFilch greatly trusted Madam Rosmerta, the bartender of the Three Broomsticks Inn, in that he would actually neglect the proper protocols and allow anything from her to enter the castle without properly inspecting them beforehand. Draco Malfoy, well aware of Filch's trust of Rosmerta, took advantage of it by sneaking in a cursed necklace and poisoned mead through her under the Imperius Curse in an attempt to assassinate Professor Dumbledore.[78]\n\nThe name \"Argus\" comes from Greek mythology, where it was the name of a giant with one hundred eyes who served the goddess Hera as a watchman (much like Mr Filch's role in patrolling the hallways of Hogwarts). His surname, \"Filch\", is an English word meaning \"to steal\", usually in a sneaky manner.",
