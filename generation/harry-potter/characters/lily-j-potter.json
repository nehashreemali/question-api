  "content": "Lily J.[8] Potter (née Evans) (30 January[1] 1960 – 31 October 1981) was an English Muggle-born[3] witch, the younger daughter of Mr and Mrs Evans, and the younger sister of Petunia Evans. She learned of her magical nature as a child, after Severus Snape recognised her as a witch and told her of the existence of magic. Lily attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1971 to 1978. She was Sorted into Gryffindor House and was a member of the Slug Club. In her seventh year she was made Head Girl and began dating James Potter.\n\nAfter Hogwarts, Lily married James. Along with their friends Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew, the couple joined the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War. She and her husband defied Lord Voldemort himself three times. Shortly afterwards, Lily and James had a son, Harry James Potter, of whom they made Sirius the godfather.\n\nHowever, the family was forced to go into hiding after a prophecy was made concerning Lord Voldemort and their infant son. It referred to a boy who would be born at the end of July in 1980, who had the power to defeat Lord Voldemort. She and James were betrayed by Pettigrew and were murdered by Voldemort on Hallowe'en night in 1981, while trying to protect their son.\n\nLily briefly appeared again through the Resurrection Stone to encourage Harry in his own sacrifice during the Battle of Hogwarts in May 1998. She appeared along with James, Sirius, and Remus. After the end of the Second Wizarding War, Lily had three grandchildren through her son: James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter, and Lily Luna Potter, the last of whom was named in memory of her.\n\nLily J. Evans was born to Mr and Mrs Evans, two Muggles of the Evans family, on 30 January 1960. Her family lived in Cokeworth, England.[9] She had an older sister Petunia, whom she was quite close to during their childhood. At the age of nine, Lily became friends with Severus Snape, who lived down in Spinner's End, which was within walking distance of the Evans' house. However, her family was apparently better off, since Petunia sneered at Snape for coming from that poverty-stricken neighbourhood.[3]\n\nSeverus was the first person to tell Lily that she was a witch, and he went on to teach Lily a great deal about the wizarding world while the two eagerly awaited the time when they could attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry together. Lily's magical abilities and friendship with Severus caused problems between the two sisters. Envying her sister's abilities, Petunia wrote to Albus Dumbledore, asking if she could attend Hogwarts with Lily. However, the headmaster kindly refused her petition. The letter was later found by Lily and Severus.[3]\n\nAt the age of eleven, Lily bought her wand from Ollivanders in Diagon Alley. The wand was 10¼ inches, willow, \"swishy\", and according to Garrick Ollivander, good for charm work. Shortly before her departure to Hogwarts, Lily and Petunia argued about magic again. Her sister called her a \"freak\" for possessing magic power and said it was better that she went to that school so \"normal people\" would be safe.[3]\n\nAt the age of eleven, Lily started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she was Sorted into Gryffindor house. She became quite skilled at Potions, attracting the attention of Professor Horace Slughorn, who made her a member of his Slug Club for the students that he considered talented and possibly successful in the future.\n\nIn her fifth year, Lily stood up for her then best friend, Severus Snape, when he was being bullied by James Potter. Lily attempted to stop his bullying, addressing James only by his surname and vice versa in this moment. It is implied that such bullying had happened more than once. However, Snape lashed out at her in his humiliation, calling her a \"filthy Mudblood.\"[10]\n\nHe then begged for Lily's forgiveness, but she asked him if he still intended to join the Death Eaters. When he didn't deny this, Lily realised that Snape wasn't willing to change for her and didn't understand what was wrong with the Death Eaters. This led to a parting of ways between Lily and Snape, as the former had already become dismayed by Snape's fascination with the Dark Arts and friendship with his Slytherin house-mates Mulciber and Avery, both of whom were aspiring Death Eaters.[3]\n\nBy Lily's fifth year, James had developed a crush on her, but she didn't reciprocate, calling him an \"arrogant toerag\" because he bullied other students, particularly her best friend. James's best friend, Sirius Black, later commented that James couldn't resist showing off and making a fool of himself.[10]\n\nDuring their seventh year, James matured somewhat, proving himself to be responsible and brave. However, it is implied that he still had the desire to bully Snape, but was willing to stop actually doing it for Lily's sake. This led to her agreeing to go out with him; gaining genuine affection for him in the process. Due to their academic achievement, skill, and responsibility, the young couple eventually were chosen to be Head Boy and Head Girl.[11]\n\nIn late 1977, Lily and James had a disastrous first meeting with Petunia and her then-fiancé, Vernon Dursley,[9] which presumably took place over Christmas break, as they were both still at Hogwarts. When Vernon tried to impress James with his car, the wizard in turn boasted of his own material wealth, and a row ensued.[9] The evening ended with both Vernon and Petunia storming out of the restaurant and Lily bursting into tears, with an ashamed James promising he'd apologise and make it up to them (which, due to his and Lily's untimely deaths, never happened).[9]\n\nPetunia was married by the end of 1977. Lily and James were invited to the wedding, but her sister refused to have Lily as a bridesmaid, which upset her deeply.[9] At the reception, Vernon wouldn't talk to James, but described him as \"some magician\" within his earshot.[9]\n\nAfter graduation, at only eighteen years old, James married Lily Evans and Sirius served as their best man at the wedding. It was a quiet ceremony because of the dangers of the First Wizarding War. Lily's older sister Petunia did not attend, for she was highly against Lily being a witch and marrying a wizard, which greatly upset Lily.\n\nIt is highly likely that Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew attended, as they were best friends of James. Both James' parents, Fleamont and Euphemia Potter attended the wedding.[12] It's unknown as to whether either of Lily's parents attended as well.\n\nLiving off James' family fortune, the Potters became full-time members of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, along with their friends Sirius, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew.[13] During the war, Lily and James defied Voldemort on at least three occasions, the first being when they refused to join his cause when he tried to recruit them.[14]\n\nLily became pregnant in the autumn of 1979. Around the same time,[15] Sybill Trelawney made a prophecy in front of Albus Dumbledore, predicting that \"the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches\" and would be \"born to those who have thrice defied him\".[16] The first part of the prophecy was overheard by Lily's friend, Snape, who had since become a Death Eater.[17] He loyally reported what he had heard to his master, but became horrified when Voldemort came to believe that Lily's son was the subject of the prophecy.[17][3]\n\nIt was the threat to Lily that led Snape to change sides, warning Dumbledore of the Dark Lord's plans, and vowing to do anything to keep the woman he still loved safe. It was Snape's continuing devotion to Lily, that made Dumbledore certain of his double agent's true loyalties.\n\nThe Potters went into hiding while Lily was still pregnant.[13] Their son, Harry James Potter, was born on 31 July 1980. Due to the danger they were in, Lily and James chose to keep Harry's christening a \"very hurried, quiet affair\" with Sirius as the only guest.[18][19] The couple also chose Sirius to be their son's godfather.[20] Lily sent a birth announcement to Petunia; it was to be the last piece of information she ever sent her sister,[9] though Petunia would later send Lily a vase for that Christmas.\n\nIn a letter to Sirius dated around Harry's first birthday in July 1981, Lily mentioned that the family had a pet cat and relayed a story about Harry flying on the toy broomstick Sirius had given him as a birthday present, in which she shared a tea with Bathilda Bagshot.[21] The Fidelius Charm was placed on their home in Godric's Hollow. Their Secret-Keeper, Peter, was chosen as a less-likely target for the Death Eaters than Sirius, but he betrayed the Potters by telling Voldemort of their whereabouts barely a week later.[22]\n\nOn 31 October 1981, Voldemort entered their home. James told Lily to take Harry and leave while he held him off, although he and his wife were wandless and thus couldn't defend themselves. James was murdered before Lily and Harry could escape the cottage. Trapping mother and son in Harry's nursery, Voldemort, honouring Snape's request to spare her life, offering Lily a chance to step aside. However, she steadfastly refused to stop shielding her son, so Voldemort murdered her.\n\nBecause Lily's death was a pure loving sacrifice (she intended to die and wasn't hoping to save herself, despite having the choice to), Harry was marked with the protection of her love and Voldemort's Killing Curse rebounded off the child. The rebounded curse destroyed the Dark Lord's body and temporarily defeated him. Harry was left unscathed, except for a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead. Thus, Harry became known as the \"Boy Who Lived\", and his fate was sealed.[21]\n\nAfter Lily and James were murdered, Petunia fostered her sister's only child.\n\nIn an attempt to stay hidden from Argus Filch, the school caretaker, Harry stumbled upon the room where the Mirror of Erised was being stored. Upon looking into it, Harry saw his late parents, Lily and James Potter.[23] Over the next few days, Harry proceeded to visit it as often as he could to see his parents' faces. The Mirror also occupied his thoughts beyond anything else, to the extent that he disregarded Ron's warning that he was growing obsessed with it.\n\nHarry only stopped visiting the mirror after Dumbledore found him one night. Dumbledore found Harry and  explained what the mirror was all about. Dumbledore told him that the mirror was to be moved and requested that Harry not go looking for it. 1992 was the last time Harry saw his parents faces in the mirror. Later, at the end of Harry's first year, Rubeus Hagrid gave Harry a special photo album containing pictures of his parents.[24]\n\nIn his third year, whenever Harry encountered a Dementor, he was forced to relive his parents' deaths. The death he was particularly forced to relive was Lily's.[25][26] This could be due to Harry being in the same room as Lily when she died, while James was murdered in the hallway. Therefore, Harry did not witness nor hear James' death.\n\nIn Harry's fourth year, Wormtail had placed Voldemort's rudimentary body into a cauldron containing the nearly finished potion. He added the first two ingredients: his hand and Harry's blood, as Voldemort believed it would make him stronger and make his enemy touchable. This was because he indirectly received Lily's sacrificial protection. However, this action also bound Harry's life to Voldemort again but inversely: Harry couldn't die as long as Voldemort still lived, which ironically meant he couldn't kill the boy.[27]\n\nDuring Harry's duel with Voldemort in the Little Hangleton graveyard, they experienced Priori Incantatem. Shades of his mother and father, and others whom Voldemort had murdered came out of Voldemort's wand, encouraging Harry and distracting Voldemort so the younger wizard could escape from the graveyard.[28]\n\nIn his fifth year, Harry entered Severus Snape's memory of being bullied by James and Sirius via the use of Pensieve, and saw his mother standing up for Snape. He also witnessed Snape calling Lily a Mudblood, which instigated the end of their friendship. This was considered Snape's worst memory.[10]\n\nIn 1998, Harry relived that same memory of Snape's, as well as many others containing his mother, in the Pensieve after Snape's death. The memories showed that she and Snape had been best friends since their childhood and brought to light Snape's unrequited and continuing love for Lily, years after her death.[3]\n\nFinally, during the Battle of Hogwarts, when Harry believed himself to be walking to his own death, he used the Resurrection Stone to bring back the spirits of Lily, James Potter, Sirius, and Remus. Both James and Lily told Harry that they were \"so very proud of him\" for his outstanding courage and strength, and assured him that they would stay with him until the very end. Harry described their very presence as his courage, the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other, with Lily smiling at him and James nodding encouragingly.[4]\n\nMany years after Lily died, her son married Ginevra Weasley and fathered three children. Harry's only daughter, Lily Luna Potter, was named in memory of her paternal grandmother.[29]\n\nLily was a beautiful woman with thick, dark red hair that fell to her shoulders, and almond-shaped, bright green eyes.[21] Apparently, her eyes were extremely distinctive, because every person who knew Lily would always see them in her son, Harry. When the aged Harry travelled back to the past, he commented that even in the face of death, she was still beautiful.\n\nLily was known for being a vivacious, talented, and popular student.[19] She was a responsible student and leader to be Head Girl in her final year at Hogwarts. Horace Slughorn noted that Lily was witty and charming.[30] Remus Lupin once described her as an uncommonly kind person with a habit of seeing the best in others, even when they could not see it themselves.[31]\n\nLily was a woman of sound moral principles and would stand by them no matter what it cost her, though her actions sometimes were ineffective. On at least one occasion, she called out James Potter and Sirius Black for their bullying of her best friend, Severus Snape. When she realised Snape's devotion to Voldemort's genocidal cause (of which she was a target at the time) and increasingly deep fascination with the Dark Arts, she ended her friendship with him permanently.\n\nThough she had a sharp tongue and had no problems in standing up to others when she was in a temper, Lily was still the type of person who would give others a second chance when they had proven themselves worthy of it. The most notable instance of this quality would be how she finally agreed to date James after he had matured out of his bullying ways despite the fact that she didn't have a good opinion of him during their early school years.\n\nLily's and her husband's most celebrated virtues were their courage and capacity for self-sacrifice, defying Voldemort three times as members of the Order of the Phoenix and even dying to protect their son Harry. It was noted by Dumbledore that Lily was very much like her son, especially in strength. Her strength is further commented on by her grandson Albus in that she would understand her fate and the fact that she would never see her son grow up.[21]\n\nLily was considered such a powerful and accomplished witch, that Lord Voldemort overlooked her Muggle-born status and actively tried to recruit her.[14][32] Lily was noted for her particular talent in potion-making. She was also able to conjure a corporeal Patronus in the form of a doe, a mark of superior magical ability.[33]\n\nLily had a happy home life and a close relationship with her parents. They were very proud to learn that Lily was a witch and apparently favoured her over her older sister Petunia.\n\nLily initially had a close relationship with Petunia, whom she often played with. When Lily began demonstrating magical ability, Petunia was \"torn between curiosity and disapproval\". Her sister was disdainful of the friendship Lily struck up with Severus Snape, the poor wizard who had taken to spying on Lily and informed her that she was a witch. In turn, Snape was quite insulting to Petunia for being a Muggle. When Lily was invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Petunia wrote to the headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, requesting that she be permitted to do the same. Although his refusal was kind, Petunia became very bitter and jealously deemed her sister a \"freak\", even saying that their separation would be better for her safety.[21]\n\nTheir relationship seems to have deteriorated greatly and become distant afterward, especially after they dated and eventually married very different men. Despite the bitterness on Petunia's end, the two sisters appeared to still be in contact when Harry was an infant, was said to have \"smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent [Lily] for Christmas\". Petunia also grudgingly took her sister's son, Harry in, at Dumbledore's request, after Lily's death. However, even as an adult, Petunia resented that her parents were proud of Lily's magical abilities and took out her enmity on Harry.[21]\n\nLily's relationship with James Potter was initially a volatile one. They first met on the Hogwarts Express just before the start of their first year at Hogwarts, at which time Lily was angered by James' and Sirius Black's mockery of her best friend, Severus.[21] Although James was a talented Quidditch player and well-liked by most, Lily considered him an \"arrogant bullying toerag\" and treated him with contempt, mostly for his bad habit of hexing innocent students for fun and his hostile relationship with Snape. However, she didn't hate James, admiring how he stood up for his friends and other people who were cruelly treated by aspiring-Death Eaters.\n\nBy his fifth year, James started to have romantic feelings for Lily and would show off to try to impress her, without success.[10] It is not known whether he asked her out more than once. It seems that, by that time, James had \"deflated his head a bit\" and \"stopped hexing people for the fun of it\".[10] However, it is implied that James still had the desire to bully Snape, but was willing to stop actually doing it for Lily's sake.\n\nBy her seventh year, Lily began to give James a chance and eventually grew to fall in love with him as well. The two had similar positions in Hogwarts as Head Girl and Head Boy. Shortly after their graduation, Lily married him and joined the Order of the Phoenix with their friends, fighting at his side several times. They eventually had a child, Harry James Potter. Her Patronus took the shape of a doe, while her husband's was a stag.\n\nOn 31 July 1980, Lily and James' first and only child, Harry, was born. They loved their son more than anything, hiding for months so he could survive from the prophecy concerning his fate with Lord Voldemort. On Hallowe'en in 1981 they sacrificed themselves at 21 years old in order to save him from when he was just an infant. Albus Dumbledore always maintained that the love his parents had for him (and in return Harry's love for them) was his greatest power. Harry grew to resemble both of his parents greatly, his personality being more similar to Lily's. He also endured mistreatment from Petunia, though much harsher.\n\nHarry barely knew them, but nevertheless regarded them with great reverence and fiercely defended their memory if anyone spoke ill of them. In 1995, he punched Draco Malfoy for insulting his mother, and he was frequently at odds with Professor Snape, who taunted Harry that James was not the great man others made him out to be. An incident that Snape would have delightfully used as an example was witnessed by Harry in the spring of 1996, when Harry accidentally watched James bullying Snape with no provocation (other than the already-existing animosity between them) in one of Snape's own memories, during his Occlumency lessons. Harry began to question how his mother even came to marry James when she clearly despised him for acting in such a way, though Remus and Sirius later assured Harry that his father had changed his ways, having matured enough to become Head Boy and eventually win Lily over.\n\nThe few times Harry ever saw his parents were in pictures given to him by Rubeus Hagrid, through a vision within the Mirror of Erised, as spectral forms which came out of Voldemort's wand during Priori Incantatem, as stored memories within the Pensieve, and again as spectral forms when he \"recalled\" them during the Battle of Hogwarts, by using the Resurrection Stone. Lily's spirit was described as looking at Harry as if she couldn't do so enough, and Harry asked his mother to stay close to him as he approached the Death Eaters' camp and certain doom. Both James and Lily told Harry that they were tremendously proud of him for being so brave and strong despite all the pain and suffering he had endured, and gave him the support he needed to sacrifice himself to Voldemort. Harry later avenged his mother when he killed Voldemort at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nHarry eventually named two of his children after his late parents and godfather, James Sirius and Lily Luna Potter, whom was named in memory of her. When her youngest grandson, Albus, time-traveled to the day before her death he noticed the love in which she placed the blanket over her son and that she clearly treasured and loved her son deeply.\n\nSeverus Snape lived near the Evans family when he was a child and soon began spying on Lily after he noticed that she was a witch. The two became friends when he started telling her about the wizarding world, being excited of attending Hogwarts together. They were best friends until their fifth year at Hogwarts, despite being sorted into different houses. Similarly, both Lily and Severus were the top students in Potions.[3]\n\nHowever, Lily became increasingly dismayed by Snape's friendships with people such as Avery and Mulciber, who disdained Muggle-borns and who practised the Dark Arts. When Snape called Lily a \"filthy Mudblood\" in a fit of anger and humiliation when she defended him from his bullies (including James and Sirius), it was the last straw for Lily. When she later asked him if he still intended to become a Death Eater and he did not deny it, she expressed feeling betrayal and ended their friendship. Rowling stated in an interview that while Lily only loved Severus as a friend, had Snape not been so involved in the Dark Arts, not become a Death Eater, and surrounded himself with other loathsome people and acts associated with them, Lily might have developed romantic feelings for him down the line.[37]\n\nDespite the ending of their friendship, Snape still loved Lily. He had believed that when he joined the Death Eaters, this would impress Lily and she'd want to be with him.[37] When he realised that it was Harry who Voldemort had fixated on as his enemy mentioned in the Prophecy, Snape begged him to spare Lily's life. However, he showed no concern for the life of her son or husband. Voldemort agreed to this request and offered Lily several chances to step aside. Her refusal to do so even though she had a choice was what created the magic that protected Harry.[7]\n\nThe deep love Snape held for Lily for almost all of his life also influenced his Patronus, which took the form of a silver doe - the same as hers, caused him to spy on Voldemort for Albus Dumbledore. He also protected her son until his own death, where he told Harry \"Look at me\", wishing to see Lily's eyes once more before he died as it was the only part of Harry that resembled his mother, the rest looking very much like his father. Lily's second grandson, Albus Severus, has both Lily and Harry's eyes and was named in honour of Snape.\n\nLily met Sirius Black on the Hogwarts Express at the same time she met James. She disliked them both, as they quickly began teasing Severus, Lily's best friend at the time, though it was Snape who had initiated the argument by mocking the other boys' preference of House. When Lily and Sirius were both sorted into Gryffindor House she remembered him from the train and turned her back on him when he made room for her at the Gryffindor table.\n\nLily eventually married Sirius's best friend. She, Sirius, and the Marauders became members of the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War and fought in several battles against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. When Dumbledore cast a Fidelius Charm to hide the Potter family from Voldemort, the couple originally wanted to make Sirius their Secret Keeper, knowing he could be completely and utterly trustworthy. Lily sent him at least one letter written in a cheerfully tone and a photograph of her family during her time in hiding. However, Sirius had proposed that Peter Pettigrew be made Secret Keeper instead, thinking that Voldemort would not expect a \"weak, talentless thing\" like Peter to be given a such crucial role. This turned out to be a fatal mistake, as Peter had turned traitor and become a spy for the Death Eaters. Barely a week after the Fidelius Charm was performed, Peter betrayed James and Lily to Voldemort, leading to them being tragically murdered.[22]\n\nSirius was deeply devastated for his friends' death; attacking Peter and attempted to kill him. He was godfather to Lily's son, Harry Potter. They shared an intimate relationship; Harry regarded Sirius as a mixture of friend and older brother, and Sirius viewed Harry as an exceptionally brave and matured adult with rights to knowing difficult truths, fully capable of shouldering burdens that many wizards much older and wiser than he could not.\n\nLily's relationship with Remus Lupin is not known in the books, although they are portrayed as friends in movies. It is probable that they are neutral or friends because Lupin was the only one who didn’t bully Snape. When Snape insisted there was something strange about Remus, Lily answered that she didn't care about what the Marauders did. Most likely, she had also realised that Remus was a werewolf, but didn't care. After graduating from Hogwarts, Remus helped James and Lily hide, and would have willingly died for his friends rather than betray them to save his own skin. When James and Lily died, Remus was devastated and initially believed, along the rest of the wizarding world, that Sirius had been a traitor.\n\nLater on, Remus grew close to Lily's son, Harry Potter. He taught Harry the Patronus Charm and protected him throughout the Second Wizarding War, while Harry ended up becoming godfather to Remus's son, Teddy.\n\nDespite Peter Pettigrew's cowardly nature, Lily became more friendly with him as she warmed to James, even affectionately referring to Peter as \"Wormy,\" from his nickname \"Wormtail.\" When James and Lily went into hiding from Lord Voldemort, the couple trusted Peter enough to make him their Secret Keeper, though only at Sirius' suggestion to use someone less obvious than himself for the role. By then, however, Peter had already become a spy for Voldemort and betrayed his dearest friends out of fear for his own life. One time Peter saw Lily and James while they were in hiding, Lily noted that he \"seemed down.\"\n\nAfter Voldemort murdered Lily and James, it is possible that Pettigrew felt some regret for his treacherous, heartless betrayal. In 1998, Pettigrew unintentionally saved Harry from Lord Voldemort, who was trying to kill the boy through Pettigrew's silver hand, by briefly hesitating when Harry reminded him of his life debt. This one, tiny impulse of mercy, however, led to Pettigrew being killed by the same hand.\n\nDuring her time at Hogwarts, Lily demonstrated extraordinary talent in potions, becoming one of Potions Master Horace Slughorn's \"all-time favourites\" and a member of his Slug Club. He considered her to be one of the brightest students he had ever taught (while being known to also teach students like Tom Riddle) and knew her to be a vivacious, charming, talented, if sometimes cheeky girl. Slughorn even stated, \"I don't imagine anyone who met her wouldn't have liked her...very brave...very funny...\", though he was surprised by her Muggle lineage.\n\nIn the films, Lily gave Slughorn a present, probably as a token of her respect and love for him as her teacher: a bowl of water, on which a petal from a lily floated, and as the petal sank, it transformed into a fish, just before it reached the bottom. He named the fish Francis. When Francis suddenly disappeared one day, Slughorn realised that Lily had died.[36] Her death haunted him for many years. Her son Harry used Slughorn's sympathy and grief for his mother's death to his advantage while under the effects of Felix Felicis, persuading Slughorn to give him the true memory of Tom Riddle's inquiry about Horcruxes, by encouraging him to be as brave as his mother was and claimed that it would undo whatever great wrong he had done.\n\nLily was on close terms with her neighbour and fellow witch Bathilda, by the time the latter was in her older years and herself in hiding with her family. Bathilda was the only one to join the Potters during Harry's birthday tea when he turned one year old, doting her son. Bathilda even spoke to the younger woman on the closeness between Grindelwald and Dumbledore, though Lily remained somewhat sceptical given the strange statement and Bathilda's possible senility.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore was Lily's Headmaster when she was a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Dumbledore invited Lily to attend Hogwarts, her sister Petunia became jealous and sent a letter to Dumbledore requesting to be enrolled in Hogwarts as well. He answered Petunia that she could not, though in a way Lily found to be \"very kind\". During Lily's years at Hogwarts, Dumbledore became very fond of her, seeing her as a talented witch with a pure, kind heart, and eventually appointing her Head Girl.\n\nAfter Lily and her friends graduated from Hogwarts, they became members of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation Dumbledore founded and led. When James and Lily became targets of Lord Voldemort, Dumbledore offered to be their Secret Keeper in an attempt to protect them, but the role went to Peter Pettigrew instead, at Sirius' suggestion. This turned out to be the couple's death sentence, as Peter betrayed them to Voldemort, who found them and killed them.\n\nDumbledore was deeply upset by their deaths and dedicated the rest of his life to keeping their son safe, though he knew what might be necessary to fulfil the Prophecy. He eventually became Harry's mentor, often telling Harry of the love and goodness of his parents and continually insisting that Harry's love for his parents was his greatest strength and a source of incredible power — \"the power the Dark Lord knows not\".\n\nMinerva McGonagall was the Transfiguration Professor and also the Head of Gryffindor House while Lily attended Hogwarts. She would have been unable to become Head Girl if she wasn't approved by her Head of House, which implies that McGonagall trusted her. After Lily left Hogwarts, both she and McGonagall became allies of the first Order of the Phoenix and fought against Voldemort and his Death Eaters.\n\nAfter Voldemort found and killed the Potters, McGonagall was devastated to learn of Lily and James' death, to which she actually broke down into tears. Professor McGonagall was fond of Lily's son and protected him as best as she could throughout his time at Hogwarts.\n\nDuring the First Wizarding War, Lily was a member of the Order of the Phoenix and  fought alongside many of its members during the First Wizarding War. She appeared to be friendly with some members, such as Rubeus Hagrid, Elphias Doge, and Marlene McKinnon. She appeared to be very upset when she learned about the McKinnons' death, crying all night.\n\nThe given name Lily comes from the name of the flower, which is a symbol of purity.[38] The flowers continue to be representative of purity and love in Europe. Specifically, the lily is often associated with the Blessed Virgin Mary; one type of the flower is known as the Madonna lily. Greek mythology also links lilies to the Muses and to the goddess Hera. In China, lily means \"forever in love\" and were thought to be capable of averting evil.[39]\n\nLily's maiden name was Evans. \"Evans\" is a Welsh or English surname derived from the given name \"Evan\"[40]. As a Welsh name, Evan means \"young warrior\". Interestingly, this could have been foreshadowing the birth of her son, Harry, who was described as a \"young warrior\". Lily herself was also a young warrior, having fought in the First Wizarding War at age 21. \"Evan\" can also be considered a form of the name John, (named after the apostle John), meaning \"God is gracious and merciful\"[41]. Her surname was inspired by a famous writer Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under pseudonym George Eliot.[42]\n\nLily's married surname is Potter. It traditionally refers to the occupation of making pottery. Potter is a very common surname of English origin.[43] J.K Rowling has also commented that she has liked this name since childhood, due to a relationship with two friends who were named Ian and Vikki Potter.[44] Beatrix Potter was a well-known English children's author, which might be a reference to Rowling. Potter's Field is the name for a burial ground for the unknown or unclaimed dead, particularly soldiers and orphans.\" It is first mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew, the Potter family had many members that fit that description. The Potter Box is a model for making ethical decisions developed at Harvard University.",
