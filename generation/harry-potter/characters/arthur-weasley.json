  "content": "Arthur Weasley (b. 6 February[1] 1950)[2] was an English pure-blood[4] wizard in the employ of the Ministry of Magic, as well as a member of the second Order of the Phoenix. He was a staunch believer in the equality of all magical and Muggle folk and was the head of the Weasley family.\n\nArthur was born to Septimus and Cedrella Weasley (née Black) and had two brothers. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1961-1968 and was sorted into Gryffindor house. Soon after graduating, Arthur married Molly Prewett. During the First Wizarding War, he and Molly had seven children: sons Bill, Charlie, Percy, twins Fred and George, and Ron, as well as their daughter Ginny. He was not a member of the Order of the Phoenix during this period, and it is unknown if he participated in any way in the First Wizarding War. At some point after graduating from Hogwarts, Arthur began working for the Ministry, in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office.\n\nIn 1996, he was promoted to head of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects by the new Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour. When the Second Wizarding War began, Arthur joined the Order. While guarding the Department of Mysteries, he was attacked by Lord Voldemort's pet snake Nagini, but he made a full recovery. Arthur participated in the Battle of the Seven Potters (1997) and the Battle of Hogwarts (1998), in which he suffered the devastating loss of his son Fred; however, he survived the war.\n\nAfter the war, he saw his family expand even further with the addition of twelve grandchildren, through the marriage of many of his surviving children and eventually named Head of Department.[13]\n\nArthur Weasley was born on 6 February[1] 1950[2] to Septimus and Cedrella Weasley (née Black).[15] His mother was disowned for marrying a \"blood traitor,\" as her family believed strongly in the notion of pure-blood supremacy. Arthur had two brothers.[16]\n\nHe attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1961-1968 and was sorted into Gryffindor House. In his third year in 1963, he chose to take Muggle Studies, likely due to his interest in Muggles.[17] While at school, he met and began dating fellow Gryffindor Molly Prewett. Arthur got caught out of bed by the school caretaker Apollyon Pringle after he and Molly went for a night-time stroll one evening and was severely punished.[18]\n\nShortly after graduating from Hogwarts, Arthur and Molly married. Their marriage was rather rushed, as Lord Voldemort was gaining power during that time and the First Wizarding War began.[19] Arthur was not a member of the first Order of the Phoenix. It is unknown if he was otherwise involved in the war, although he was familiar with the Death Eaters' use of the Imperius Curse and the trouble it caused the Ministry of Magic at the time.[20] During the course of the war, he and Molly had seven children: Bill in late 1970, Charlie in 1972, Percy in 1976, twins Fred and George in 1978, Ron in 1980, and the first daughter to be born into the Weasley family in generations, Ginny, in 1981.\n\nThe war ended soon after Ginny's birth, but not before Arthur's brothers-in-law Fabian and Gideon Prewett, both Order members, were killed by Death Eaters.[21] Arthur was upset when some Death Eaters, such as Lucius Malfoy, were able to escape punishment by claiming that they had been under the Imperius Curse. Arthur believed they were lying, and he and Lucius were hostile towards one another whenever they crossed paths.\n\nAt some point between his graduation from Hogwarts and 1992, Arthur gained employment in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office at the Ministry of Magic. He also purchased a Muggle car, a Ford Anglia, and bewitched it to make it fly; in order to do so, he made sure to include a loophole in a law he wrote for the Ministry: as long as he was not intending to fly the car, it would be legal. The car was part of Arthur's substantial personal collection of Muggle artefacts, which he kept in a shed and included plugs and batteries.[22]\n\nAt one point in either 1985 or 1986, Arthur walked in on his twin sons attempting to make an Unbreakable Vow with five-year old Ronald and, in Ron's own words, \"went mental\". Precisely what happened was never elaborated on, but it was the only time Arthur was ever seen to have been as angry as his wife and it left Fred feeling \"his left buttock has never been the same\" for years afterwards.\n\nArthur and Molly visited Hogwarts on at least two Christmases in the 1980s, when Charlie was attending Hogwarts. During these visits, Arthur met Jacob's sibling.[23][24]\n\nIn 1992, Ron, Fred, and George borrowed their father's car to rescue Harry Potter from Privet Drive, after not receiving letters from him all summer.  When Arthur returned to The Burrow after a night of Ministry raids, he was pleased to find out the car could indeed fly. That was until he caught his wife's eye; he then poorly reprimanded the boys for doing so. When asked if he had found anything during the raids, he responded that they had only found a bunch of shrinking door-keys and a biting kettle. He was also introduced to Harry Potter and asked him about rubber ducks, due to his fascination with muggles.[22]\n\nA few days later, the family, as well as Harry, went to Diagon Alley to purchase school supplies for the upcoming year. While there, they visited Flourish and Blotts, where Gilderoy Lockhart was having a book signing event, during which Arthur got into a fist fight with Lucius Malfoy over Arthur's support for Muggles. He was very excited to meet Hermione Granger's parents, both Muggle dentists, insisting on taking them out for a drink.[22]\n\nWhen Harry and Ron were prevented from getting on Platform 9¾, the pair borrowed the Ford Anglia to fly to Hogwarts. As this was a serious potential breach of the Statute of Secrecy, Mr Weasley faced an inquiry at work over the incident.[22]\n\nIn the spring of 1993, Arthur and Molly were called to Hogwarts when it was learned the Monster of Slytherin had taken their daughter, Ginny, into the Chamber of Secrets. It turned out that Lucius Malfoy had planted an old school diary of Tom Riddle's on Ginny, which subsequently possessed her and forced her to open the Chamber. Ginny was nearly killed, but was saved by Harry Potter and her brother Ron.[22]\n\nArthur won some money in a Daily Prophet drawing and he and his family travelled to Egypt to visit his son Bill. In autumn of the same year, when Sirius Black had escaped from Azkaban and was believed to be seeking Harry's death, Arthur wanted to tell Harry the truth. He discussed the matter with his wife in secret, not wanting Harry to panic. Harry, however, overheard their conversation. On Platform 9¾, Arthur and Harry briefly discussed what Harry had heard; while pleased that Harry was not scared, Arthur urged Harry not to go seeking Black.[25]\n\nIn the summer of 1994, Arthur managed to get himself and his family (as well as Harry and Hermione) tickets for the Quidditch World Cup from Ludo Bagman because Arthur had helped Otto, Ludo's brother, out of a minor scrape. Arthur was among the Weasleys who fetched Harry from the Dursleys via the Floo Network. While there, he expressed his fascination at various Muggle artefacts in the Dursley's house. The group sat in the Top Box, where they were confronted by the Malfoys, who were there by a personal invitation from the Minister himself, though both Arthur and Lucius were able to restrain themselves out of respect for Fudge.[18]\n\nA little while after the Weasleys, along with Harry and Hermione, had returned to their tents, a group of masked Death Eaters began storming the camp-site, jinxing the camp-site manager's family and anything or anyone that got in their way. Arthur, along with Percy, Charlie, and Bill, went out to combat them. Before he left, he told Fred, George, Ron, Ginny, Harry, and Hermione to seek refuge in the woods, and that he would find them when it was safe.[18]\n\nUpon seeing the Dark Mark in the sky, Arthur, along with other Ministry officials, Apparated at once to the location from where the mark had been cast. Upon arrival, he and the other Ministry officials immediately sent out Stunning Spells towards the suspected perpetrators, before realising it was Harry, Ron, and Hermione standing in the clearing. He dismissed the possibility that Harry, Ron, or Hermione would have conjured it, even if they had known how to.\n\nAfter looking in the bushes in the direction that their Stunners had gone, they found Crouch's house-elf, Winky, unconscious and on the ground next to her was Harry's wand, that he lost sometime during the Quidditch match. Despite the evidence that Harry's wand had, in fact, been the wand used to summon the Dark Mark, Arthur refused to believe that either Harry or Winky could have been the ones to do it, and that someone else must have been responsible.[18]\n\nAfter the event, Arthur departed the campsite in the morning and returned to The Burrow with the others. Arthur was angered when he was shown a scathing article written by Rita Skeeter in the Daily Prophet, which harshly criticised the failure of Ministry officials to prevent the riot from happening, which even indirectly mentioned himself. Arthur and Percy then returned to the Ministry headquarters straight away to help straighten the mayhem befalling the Ministry.[18]\n\nIn 1995, Arthur learned about the return of Lord Voldemort and joined the second Order of the Phoenix. He did this in preparation for the upcoming war. A week into the summer holiday Arthur got into an intense argument with his son Percy. Percy had recently been promoted to Junior Assistant to the Minister, working directly for Cornelius Fudge. Percy had hoped his family would be pleased, but Arthur suspected it was a move by the Ministry to put a spy in the staunchly Dumbledore-loyalist Weasley family.\n\nPercy proceeded to insult his father, claiming that ever since he started at the Ministry he had to struggle against Arthur's reputation. He stated that Arthur had no ambition, as why Arthur was still working in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office because he had no desire for advancement. This was in Percy's eyes, the reason behind the family's poor economic status. Percy continued by saying that Arthur was an idiot to align himself with Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter, as he did not believe their statements that Lord Voldemort had returned.\n\nPercy's own loyalty lay with the Ministry of Magic. Percy soon moved out and found a flat in central London and did not speak to his family for a long time. Arthur took the betrayal of his son very hard, to the extent that he would break whatever he happened to be holding whenever Percy's name was mentioned.[21]\n\nWhen Harry broke the International Statute of Secrecy by defending himself and his cousin Dudley against two Dementors on 2 August, Arthur escorted him to his disciplinary hearing before the Wizengamot on the 12th. While he normally Apparated to work, Arthur felt arriving in a non-magical fashion would make a better impression, given for what Harry was being disciplined (underage magic). He was not allowed in with Harry while the trial was in session and waited for him outside the courtroom.[21]\n\nOne night, while guarding the Hall of Prophecy for the Order of the Phoenix, Arthur was attacked by Voldemort's snake Nagini; the attack was witnessed by Harry, through his mental connection with the Dark Lord. Critically injured, Arthur was taken to St Mungo's. Because of Harry witnessing the event and alerting Dumbledore to it Arthur survived the attack and hence he was transported to St Mungo's in time.[21]\n\nArthur was required to take a Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour. At the suggestion of trainee Healer Augustus Pye, he tried stitches, a Muggle alternative, which Molly did not like. However, the stitches were not effective; Nagini's fangs apparently had a poison that dissolved them prematurely. Eventually, an antidote to the poison was found and he was cured, coming home to find fellow Order members Severus Snape and Sirius Black in the middle of a heated argument. Despite this near death experience, Percy did not so much as question about his father's well-being.[21]\n\nAfter the Ministry finally accepted the truth that Lord Voldemort had indeed returned to power, Arthur was promoted to the Head of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. He had no less than ten people working under him. However, this promotion by Rufus Scrimgeour might have been an unsuccessful way of trying to warm Harry up to the Ministry, given the time frame of events that took place.[26]\n\nScrimgeour was put down by Dumbledore on the idea of Dumbledore approaching Harry on Scrimgeour's behalf to get Harry to become a \"mascot\" for the Ministry of Magic. Having been told by Dumbledore that Harry would not want anything to do with the Ministry following the events of the previous year at Hogwarts, Scrimgeour, who knew that Harry was close to the Weasley family, might have then decided to promote Arthur so that Harry would possibly be more open to joining the Ministry (Molly did say that Arthur's promotion had been within days of Harry's arrival at The Burrow). During the summer, The Burrow also became the home of his son Bill's new fiancée, Fleur Delacour, much to his wife Molly's dismay.[26]\n\nThe Burrow was later placed under the highest security the Ministry could provide, due to arrangements to have Harry Potter stay there for the summer holiday. During this time Arthur would sometimes bring home news of odd accidents or disappearances. One of these disappearances was that of Garrick Ollivander, he brought home the news before it even reached the Daily Prophet.[26]\n\nArthur later accompanied several of his family members, as well as Harry and Hermione, to Diagon Alley, under the Ministry protection of Rubeus Hagrid. Harry later spoke to Arthur about suspecting Draco Malfoy of joining the Death Eaters and having purchased a Dark artefact from Borgin and Burkes to presumably use at Hogwarts, before leaving himself for Hogwarts. Later, Arthur once more personally searched Malfoy Manor for any possible Dark objects, to no avail.[26]\n\nThat year, he sent a letter to his son, Ron to inform the latter that Harry's suspicions were correct.[26]\n\nHarry, Ron, and Ginny spent Christmas at The Burrow, where Harry tried to persuade Arthur and Remus Lupin that there was indeed something Dark about Draco Malfoy. His argument went unheard, as neither believed his theory regarding him. Arthur also tried to keep the peace between Molly and Fleur during the Christmas holidays, the latter of whom had made a negative comment about a song Molly was particularity fond of.[26]\n\nNewly appointed Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour also arrived at The Burrow, with Arthur's son Percy in tow. Molly was overjoyed to see Percy, while Arthur and the twins remained stone-faced. When the Minister announced his intention to speak to Harry alone Arthur prepared to speak, but Harry dismissed him stating that it was fine. Scrimgeour attempted to recruit Harry, with little success, while Percy once again fell out with his family.[26]\n\nHarry's suspicions about Draco Malfoy were later proved to be true. He helped Death Eaters to infiltrate Hogwarts and Dumbledore was killed by Severus Snape. Arthur and Molly later arrived at Hogwarts shortly after the Battle of the Astronomy Tower to see their son Bill, who was gravely injured by Fenrir Greyback during the conflict. The Weasley family sadly attended the funeral of Dumbledore, a man they respected greatly and who had led them as the head of the Order of the Phoenix.[26]\n\nDuring the summer holidays, Arthur participated in the plan to evacuate Harry from the home of his aunt and uncle, before his seventeenth birthday. This was done due to Harry needing more protection from Voldemort and his Death Eaters, along with the protection of having a \"place to call home\" being broken on his seventeenth birthday. The original plan of evacuation was to have Alastor Moody side-along Apparate Harry to The Burrow, but that plan was moot as Pius Thicknesse, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement was under the influence of the Imperius Curse and had sealed off the house. Arthur flew with his son Fred.[27]\n\nUnfortunately, dozens of Death Eaters ambushed the Order members and the Battle of the Seven Potters ensued. Alastor Moody was murdered by Voldemort himself in the conflict, while Arthur's son George lost an ear at the hands of Severus Snape, and Harry's owl Hedwig was killed by an unknown Death Eater. Harry, however, was successfully transported to The Burrow, which was protected by powerful enchantments. Arthur was confronted on arrival by Kingsley Shacklebolt out of paranoia of him being an impostor or otherwise bewitched; his fatherly concern for George caused the normally laid-back and calm Arthur to not only yell at, but threaten his friend and ally with bodily harm if he did not back off and let him see his injured son.\n\nDuring the wedding of Bill and Fleur, Kingsley Shacklebolt's Patronus arrived informing the guests that the Ministry of Magic had fallen to Voldemort and his Death Eaters. The current Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, was brutally tortured and murdered. Death Eaters then interrupted the reception and the Weasley family was placed under constant watch. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, escaped to 12 Grimmauld Place.\n\nAfter they arrived, Arthur's weasel Patronus appeared and informed them that the rest of the family was safe, but warned them not to attempt contact as that might cause problems.[10]\n\nHowever, Harry saw Arthur again while disguised as Albert Runcorn by use of Polyjuice Potion when he, Hermione, and Ron infiltrated the Ministry of Magic. He found out that Arthur was under surveillance by the Voldemort-controlled Ministry for his \"blood traitor\" status. Arthur was one of the few people who made his disgust for the Ministry's anti-Muggle and Muggle-born stance very clear. He confronted Runcorn (unaware that it was really Harry), who seemed to have been considered very intimidating by most Ministry employees, about turning Muggle-born wizard Dirk Cresswell into the Muggle-Born Registration Commission.[27]\n\nArthur also had a file at the Ministry regarding his blood-status, his family's status, and his status in the Ministry. The file was kept in Dolores Umbridge's office. Harry (as Runcorn) tried to warn Arthur that his movements were being monitored by the Ministry, but Arthur thought he was trying to threaten him.[27]\n\nWhen Harry accidentally broke the Taboo on Voldemort's name in 1998, the Death Eaters realised that Ron was with Harry, and the other Weasleys, including Arthur, were forced into hiding and prevented from going to work. They stayed with Molly's Aunt Muriel during this time.[27]\n\nIn May, Arthur arrived at the school to take part in the Battle of Hogwarts. His estranged son Percy arrived just in time to apologise to his family. Percy also expressed his wish to take part in the fight against Voldemort's encroaching army. Arthur and Percy reconciled, and all the Weasleys took part in the battle.\n\nDuring the second half of the battle, he and Percy duelled and defeated Pius Thicknesse and also witnessed his wife kill Bellatrix Lestrange after she nearly killed Ginny. He also witnesses Harry's final defeat of Voldemort. During the battle, Arthur lost his son, Fred, which devastated him, his wife and the rest of their children, as well as Harry and Hermione.[27] After the Battle, he was seen sitting with several members of his family.\n\nHaving moved back to The Burrow following the Battle of Hogwarts with his wife, in the years that followed, their family grew even larger, with most of his children marrying and having children of their own.[28] Shortly after the final battle, Arthur returned to his old job as Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office,[12] as he had previously missed working with Muggle artefacts during his stint at the larger division.[29] Sometime after this, however, Arthur, having embraced the efforts to de-corrupt the Ministry by Kingsley Shacklebolt, later rose to a higher office within the Ministry when he was promoted to the Head of Department on Level Two.[13]\n\nTheir home also became \"quite the photo op for wizarding history buffs\" following the publishing of a book titled One Hundred Historical Sites from the Second Wizarding War,[30] whereupon its role as the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix became public knowledge. Ron suggested that they should charge a fee for the number of tourists that subsequently showed up to photograph and be photographed with their old front sign, an idea that Arthur firmly refused to go along with.[31]\n\nBy 2020, his son-in-law Harry Potter had taken over as Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement.[32] Noted to have been particularly proud of the accomplishment that was Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, in his old age, Arthur was often found perusing their products while visiting Diagon Alley.[31]\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Calamity, Arthur, while retired, still assisted the newly created Statute of Secrecy Task Force in returning Foundables that had been displaced in the Muggle world.[30] Around the same time, a younger version of himself appeared as a Foundable, forcing volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force to track him down to free him, allowing him to return to his original time.[33]\n\nIn April 2020, a massive influx of tourists began visiting The Burrow as a result of its mention as an important historical site in One Hundred Historical Sites from the Second Wizarding War, leading to a Calamity surge focused on The Burrow and its residents. Arthur helped Molly manage the tourists and deal with the Foundables spawned by the surge, with Molly making sure that Arthur's shed was under enough protective enchantments to ensure the tourists wouldn't steal any of his Muggle artifacts. He was regularly confused by seeing Foundables of a younger Ron appearing at The Burrow, believing that Ron had come to visit them. Ron later sent Arthur a box of Decoy Detonators in an attempt to scare off the tourists, but they only managed to startle the family chickens, who covered Arthur in feathers and pecked him relentlessly. However, Molly did not allow Arthur to break from helping her return Foundables following his experience with the chickens. Arthur was also pleasantly surprised to see the Flying Ford Anglia appear again as a Foundable. The tourists eventually began to die down, but Arthur and Molly were secretly pleased that some of them had erected a plaque \"in honour of the Weasley family's contributions and sacrifices\" during the Second Wizarding War.[30]\n\nIn the spring of 2021, The Unforgivable threatened Harry Potter and Hermione Granger after the two began wrenching control of Calamity surges away from the cabal. The two feared that their children would be targeted, but Harry insisted on continuing to fight against The Unforgivable. Harry redirected a Calamity surge and controlled it using memories of the Marauders. In response, in April of that year, both Ginny and Ron were attacked by members of The Unforgivable. Although Ginny was able to successfully fend off her attacker, The Unforgivable were successful in abducting Ron.[34]\n\nAfter a Foundable of Arthur was returned from a Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes-focused Calamity surge, Arthur suddenly received an implanted memory of Ron warning him that The Unforgivable couldn't guarantee his safety if the Ministry didn't do what they demanded. Arthur reached out to Harry to inform him of the memory while Ginny attempted to reassure him and Molly that Ron would be alright. Fortunately, Ron was eventually recovered, but his memories were completely Obliviated, necessitating Harry and Hermione to continue helping Calamity Investigators return Foundables related to the trio's Hogwarts years in order to help return them.[31]\n\nLike many other members of the Weasley family, Arthur had bright red hair, though he was balding by the early 1990s. He wore glasses and had green eyes, and also possessed the tall, thin build inherited by his sons Bill, Percy, and Ron.[22]\n\nHe also had visible marks somewhere on his body from a decent caning whilst at Hogwarts, for being late. The punishment was set by the caretaker at the time, Apollyon Pringle.[18]\n\nIn the wizarding world, Arthur Weasley was known for being a well-meaning, reasonable and competent every-man, trying to take care of his family and do the right thing. A man of principle, he was strongly opposed to the discrimination of Muggles, Muggle-borns, half-bloods, half-breeds, and cursed beings such as werewolves, and did not think highly of those who subscribed to such intolerant beliefs, despite it being the prevailing views of so many of his fellow pure-bloods. While this earned him respect of his friends and family, others, such as Lucius Malfoy, considered him to be a \"blood traitor.\"[22] and a \"disgrace to the name of wizard\". The latter, however, he never truly took to heart, as his opinion about what disgraced the name of wizard differed greatly from theirs.\n\nWhile Arthur Weasley was often seen as \"fun\" in the earlier years, with the return of Lord Voldemort and the gathering crisis in the wizarding world he shouldered a role of increasing challenges, assuming duties within the Order of the Phoenix in addition to new responsibilities at the Ministry. He was protective of Harry, and at times assumed a father like role, a position previously occupied by Harry's godfather Sirius Black, and by Albus Dumbledore. He was a man of principle and remained loyal to Dumbledore, even though this impeded his advancement in the Ministry of Magic and cost him the respect of Percy, who also worked at the Ministry but agreed more strongly with the policies of the Minister for Magic.\n\nA devoted father, Arthur was the more laid-back parent than his wife, but was nevertheless very protective of them, and loved his own flesh and blood so much that the only times he was seen to lose control of himself was when any of his children were hurt. In addition, he could also get just as angry at them as his wife if they did something very seriously bad; an example of this was when he went berserk on catching Fred and George trying to trick Ron into making an Unbreakable Vow, a potentially lethal act of magic, and his reaction was so pronouncedly different from his usual temperament that Ron still recalled it over a decade later and Fred swore at least one part of his anatomy was never the same since.\n\nArthur was fascinated at how Muggles were able to go about their lives without magic. Whenever he found himself in close proximity to them, he had a hard time containing his enthusiasm. During Harry's stays at The Burrow, he liked to sit next to Harry, in order to ask him questions about living with them and had at various times attempted to engage the Dursleys in conversation about electricity. In 1992, when he learned Harry had never travelled by the Floo Network, he joyfully began to ask about the \"escapators\" in the London Underground. When the Weasleys and Harry met Hermione Granger in Diagon Alley that same year, Arthur was ecstatic to meet Hermione's parents, both Muggles, who were exchanging money at Gringotts. While the other family members went shopping for school supplies, Arthur insisted on taking Mr and Mrs Granger for a drink in the Leaky Cauldron.[22]\n\nIn addition to his Ford Anglia, Arthur also collected a number of other Muggle items. He had a large collection of plugs and batteries, as well as other undisclosed items in his shed. After successfully transporting Harry to The Burrow in the aftermath of the Battle of the Seven Potters, Arthur showed Harry the remains of Sirius' motorcycle and told him he was eager to learn how the brakes worked and that he also wanted to put it back together when Molly was not around. In time, Arthur did put it back together and returned it to Harry.[27] When given the chance to use matches to light a bonfire, Arthur enjoyed it immensely, even though he was not successful.\n\nBecause of his fondness for Muggles, in 1992, he drafted a proposition for the Ministry called the Muggle Protection Act. Many pure-blood wizards took offence to this, and Lucius Malfoy attempted to sabotage Arthur's plans; by planting Riddle's diary on Arthur's daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and bury the legislation.[22] So adamant in protecting Muggles, he was outraged at Fred and George's prank on Dudley Dursley, even though the twins did not target Dudley because he was a Muggle, but rather he was a horrible boy.[35]\n\nWhen he took his family, Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup in 1994, he was adamant about remaining incognito. He insisted on putting up their tents by hand and cooking their food outside with a fire. While somewhat familiar with the concept, he had trouble with a Muggle matchbox; he would light a match and subsequently drop it in surprise. In the end, he managed to get the fire lit with Hermione's help and seemed to have a great time. When Death Eaters started a riot after the cup, Arthur was one of the people who acted to protect Muggle victims.[18]\n\nHis wall in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office was covered with Muggle pictures, including several of Muggle cars (one of which was a disassembled motor) Muggle post boxes, which he appeared to have cut out of a Muggle children's book and a diagram of how to wire a plug. His greatest ambition was to find out how Muggles were able to keep aeroplanes airborne. Arthur's love of engineering and Muggle technology was inherited by his sons Fred and George in that they too possessed Arthur's ingenuity and almost compulsive need to invent or modify things from their intended purposes, resulting in many of the twins' joke items.\n\nArthur was the son of Septimus and Cedrella Weasley. They were both pure-bloods, although Cedrella was disowned by her family, because she married a blood-traitor. The relationship between them is unknown; it is possible that his father's point of view made Arthur realise that there was no difference between wizards and Muggles. Arthur also had at least two brothers.\n\nArthur eventually married Molly Prewett, whom he had been dating since Hogwarts, and they had seven children; Bill, Charlie, Percy, the twins Fred and George Weasley, Ron, and Ginny. Arthur was less strict than his wife, and his children thought he was funny. He had a good relationship with all of them, before his son Percy became angry with him. However, during the Second Wizarding War, Arthur appeared to have been more protective, because he was afraid of what happened to his children.\n\nHis son Bill was a very good student; he had become prefect and Head Boy during his years at Hogwarts. He later worked for Gringotts in Egypt and married Fleur Delacour.\n\nCharlie was also a good student; he was prefect and Captain for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He studied dragons in Romania, but he never married.\n\nHe also had a good relationship with Percy, but their relationship was broken up in 1995. Percy was more serious than his father, and they both worked for the Ministry of Magic, although Percy loved to obey the rules and was also very ambitious. Arthur forgave his son in 1998, during the Battle of Hogwarts when Percy was ready to apologise for his previous actions.\n\nHis sense of humour was similar to Fred and George's. He loved them very much, and, although they were not model students, Arthur knew they were very clever wizards. Though not as strict towards their mischievous behaviour, a few rare exceptions are when they attempted an Unbreakable Vow with Ron in their earlier years, in 1994 when they left a Ton-Tongue Toffee for Dudley Dursley to have, and in 1995, when he agreed with his wife on their irresponsible use of magic ever since they had come of age. Fred was killed during the Battle of Hogwarts; Arthur was grief-stricken over his death.\n\nArthur was very protective of Ron and Ginny, who were his youngest children. Ginny was the youngest and the only daughter. When she was possessed by a memory of Tom Marvolo Riddle, in a diary, Arthur was very upset; he shouted at Ginny, saying that he had told her not to trust magical objects that had a mind of their own. He also helped Ron to his mission; he hexed the family ghoul, along with Fred and George, in order to make it look like Ron, who had gone to help Harry and Hermione find and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes.\n\nAfter the Second Wizarding War, Arthur's family extended even more, through his children; he appeared to have at least twelve grandchildren: Victoire, Dominique and Louis, who were the children of Bill and Fleur; Molly and Lucy, Percy and Audrey's children; Fred and Roxanne who were the children of George and Angelina Johnson; Rose and Hugo, who were Ron and Hermione's children; and James, Albus and Lily, who were Ginny and Harry's children. He had a good relationship with his grandchildren, but, according to Ron (who may or may not have been joking), he would not let them marry any pure-bloods.\n\nHarry Potter was Ron's best friend. He met Arthur in 1992, at The Burrow. Arthur liked to discuss Muggle things with Harry Potter and had entrusted Harry with certain information that many felt him too young to understand, such as in 1993 when the Ministry would not tell Harry that they thought Sirius Black was going to seek him out. Harry had also saved Arthur's life once when Harry saw him being attacked by Nagini in the Department of Mysteries before Christmas of 1995. They fought together at the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts, and both survived the Second Wizarding War.\n\nAs Molly once said that Harry was like a son to her, it is possible that Arthur felt the same way. Arthur became like a father to Harry. Harry married Arthur's daughter Ginny and became Arthur's only son-in-law. He also had three children with Ginny, who are some of Arthur's many grandchildren: James, Albus, and Lily.\n\nBecause of her friendships with Ron and Ginny, Hermione Granger became friendly with the entire Weasley family. She spent a portion of many of her summer and Christmas holidays at their home of The Burrow and attended some family outings with them, such as shopping for school supplies in Diagon Alley and attending the 1994 Quidditch World Cup with them.\n\nArthur was fascinated by the Muggle world and thus Hermione's background and even invited Hermione's parents for a drink upon first meeting them in Diagon alley before the start of her second year. He seemed to like Hermione, as if she were his daughter. Hermione married Ron, and became one of Arthur's many daughters-in-law. She also had two children with Ron, who were Arthur's grandchildren; Rose and Hugo.\n\nArthur considered Albus Dumbledore as being the greatest wizard of all time. Dumbledore was the Hogwarts headmaster at the time Arthur attended Hogwarts. They were both sorted into Gryffindor house and appeared to be on friendly terms. They both believed in the equality of all wizards and Muggles. Dumbledore seemed to like most people, especially the Weasleys, because they were all fair and good people. Arthur also served in the Order of the Phoenix during the Second Wizarding War with Dumbledore, who was the leader. When Arthur was bitten by Nagini, Dumbledore was upset; he helped find him, using the portraits that were hung at the office of Dumbledore.\n\nIn 1997, Arthur learned about Albus Dumbledore's death and that Severus Snape was the murderer. Arthur was very sad and sat with his family, the professors, and other students, discussing how Snape killed Dumbledore. In fact, Dumbledore, who was about to die as a result of wearing a cursed ring, had asked Snape to kill him, because Dumbledore did not want the other Death Eaters to guess Snape's true loyalties, did not want Draco Malfoy to become a murderer, and did not want to die a painful, drawn-out death.\n\nAs Arthur was a lower-class person and having a poor family, Cornelius Fudge always neglected Arthur while having a manipulated friendship with his wealthy rival, Lucius Malfoy, due to Fudge's swaying of money and power. Fudge also happened to consider Arthur strange because of his obsession with Muggles, causing Fudge to think he lacked proper wizarding pride, thus he held Arthur back within the Ministry.\n\nWhen Lord Voldemort had returned, Fudge suspected Arthur being in league with Dumbledore since he was aware that the two of them were friendly. He even invited Arthur's son, Percy to become his Junior Assistant in an attempt to spy on the Weasley family and Dumbledore, which led to Percy defecting from his family after a row with Arthur. Fudge ignored Arthur and Harry's existences when he and the Wizengamot exited Courtroom Ten. After Fudge was disgraced and forced to resign, Arthur was instantly promoted by Fudge's successor.\n\nArthur and Lucius Malfoy despised each other (as Arthur himself noted, the two of them had very different personalities), often exchanging insults when they met and even getting into a fistfight on at least one occasion. Lucius disdained the Weasley family for their poverty and so-called blood traitor status; while the Malfoys prized their pure-blood heritage, the Weasleys accepted Muggles and Muggle-borns. He and Arthur apparently clashed multiple times over this at the Ministry of Magic, where Arthur worked and Lucius visited regularly to see Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge.\n\nWhen Arthur proposed the Muggle Protection Act in 1992, Lucius was furious to the point of trying to sabotage Arthur by placing an old diary of Tom Marvolo Riddle’s on Arthur's eleven-year-old daughter, Ginny, endangering her life as well as those of Muggle-born Hogwarts students, as this led to the opening of the Chamber of Secrets.[22] Also, Arthur never believed Lucius' claim that he had been under the Imperius Curse during the First Wizarding War, indicating that their enmity likely dates back to their younger years.\n\nArthur had a good relationship with most members of the Order of the Phoenix. Arthur was not an official member of the first order, but he became a member of the second order during the Second Wizarding War.\n\nHe seemed to know Sirius Black since the First Wizarding War. After the war, Sirius was imprisoned in Azkaban for betraying the Potters to Voldemort and killing twelve Muggles. In fact, Peter Pettigrew had committed the crimes and blamed Sirius. Arthur believed that when Sirius escaped from the prison, he wanted to kill Harry Potter. He told Harry not to try to find Sirius, as he knew that Harry would learn about Sirius's crimes. Harry, Ron, and Hermione learned the truth in 1994, and Pettigrew escaped again.\n\nArthur and Sirius became friendly in the second Order. They lived in the same house for a short time; Sirius also tried to comfort Arthur's children when Arthur was bitten by Nagini. Sirius was killed by his cousin Bellatrix Lestrange, during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Arthur's first reaction is unknown; he only tried not to talk about Sirius in front of Harry, knowing how that would make the boy feel. Arthur and Sirius were also distant relatives, through Arthur's mother.\n\nArthur appeared to be on good terms with Remus Lupin, too. Remus was a werewolf, but Arthur did not care about that; he thought Lupin was a good person. Furthermore, they had the same beliefs about blood purity, and they were both poor. Lupin was the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts for a short time when Ron, Ginny, Fred, George and Percy were attending the school. They all thought Remus was a good teacher. Arthur and Remus became members of the Order during the Second Wizarding War; they fought together at the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts; during the final battle, Remus was killed. His body lay near Fred's, and the Weasley family looked very sad by both deaths.\n\nArthur seemed to like his daughter-in-law, Fleur Delacour. Unlike his wife and daughter, Arthur did not dislike her; after the war, Arthur had three grandchildren through Fleur.\n\nRubeus Hagrid was a member of the Order and very loyal to Dumbledore. He seemed to know the Weasleys since their earlier years, as they appeared to be friends in 1992. Hagrid told Arthur not to argue with Lucius Malfoy, believing that he was not worth it. Hagrid was also the Care of Magical Creatures professor of Ron and Ginny. The whole Weasley family appeared to be friendly with Hagrid. They were members of the Order who fought together at the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts. They both survived the war.\n\nArthur had a high opinion of Alastor Moody, whom he had met at the Ministry of Magic. He thought Moody was a little mad but a very powerful and brave Auror, who had captured dozens of Death Eaters. They were friends, as well as members of the second Order. Arthur's children thought Moody was mad, too. Moody led the group of order members that fought at the Battle of the Seven Potters. Moody was killed by Lord Voldemort during the battle. Arthur was sad about his death.\n\nArthur also seemed to be on good terms with Severus Snape, despite the fact that Snape disliked his children. However, when he learned that Snape killed Dumbledore, he and his family obviously turned against him but that was most likely retracted when he learned of Snape's true loyalties from Harry. In addition, one of Arthur's grandchildren, Albus Potter, was named after Snape.\n\nArthur was also friendly with Nymphadora Tonks. Tonks was a young woman, as well as an Auror. Arthur and Tonks also knew each other through the Ministry of Magic. During the Battle of the Seven Potters, Tonks was responsible for Ron, they were paired together. Tonks managed to save herself and Ron from Bellatrix Lestrange, and then Arthur thanked Tonks. She was eventually murdered by Bellatrix during the Battle of Hogwarts. Her dead body was put near Fred and Lupin's, and the Weasleys looked very sad by the deaths of all of them. It is unknown if he had met her son Teddy Lupin, but considering how Teddy was the godson of Arthur's son-in-law Harry, coupled with the fact that by 2017 Teddy was dating Arthur's granddaughter Victoire, it is possible that Teddy and Arthur were on good terms.\n\nHe appeared to be a friend of Kingsley Shacklebolt, as well. They were only members of the second Order. They fought together in many battles and survived the Second Wizarding War.\n\nMany members of the Order were killed during battles in both wars; it is likely Arthur got on well with them.",
