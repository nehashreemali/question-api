  "content": "Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, known after his death as Nearly Headless Nick (d. 31 October 1492), was a wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Gryffindor House.\n\nHe was a wizard of the royal court as an adult. He was executed by an improper decapitation, after he had a magical mishap with Lady Grieve. He tried to straighten her teeth but it backfired and she grew tusks. Since then, he became the house ghost of Gryffindor Tower at the Hogwarts Castle.\n\nLittle is known about Sir Nicholas's childhood. He lived in the fifteenth century and was the son of Gwallter, a member of the noble Mimsy-Porpington family[10] somewhere in the British Isles.[4]\n\nWhen he turned eleven, Nicholas attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he was Sorted into Gryffindor.[9] It is unknown at which subjects he excelled in, but he was apparently poor in Charms.[11]\n\nIn his adulthood, Sir Nicholas openly associated with Muggles. He was knighted and was a courtier at King Henry VII's royal court.[8]\n\nSir Nicholas met Lady Grieve while strolling in the park on the evening of 30 October 1492. He was certain he could straighten her crooked teeth, but his attempt to do so backfired, causing her to grow a tusk.[11]\n\nSir Nicholas was immediately taken into custody and sentenced to death as a result of this mistake. Before being locked in a dungeon, his wand was taken from him, thus preventing him from using magic to escape.[8] Throughout the night he cried that he would soon undo the damage done to Lady Grieve.[11]\n\nA priest came to Sir Nicholas's cell to comfort him and escort him to the execution site at dawn the following day. He became a \"gibbering wreck\" when the executioner told him to kneel before the block. However, the executioner's axe was blunt, as the grindstone used to sharpen it had been misplaced. Thus, it took forty-five hacks to kill Sir Nicholas and even then his head was only partially severed. Naturally, these acts of betrayal and idiocy alone were not enough to condemn Sir Nicholas to such a brutal death, but the rampant acts of previous juvenile encounters led to an unsympathetic public.[11]\n\nAlbus Dumbledore explained in his notes on The Wizard and the Hopping Pot that Muggle executions of wizards such as Sir Nicholas were rarely successful, given that wizards could magically protect themselves and escape.[8] Sir Nicholas had his wand taken away, however, thus was unable to leave his dungeon cell.[11]\n\nSir Nicholas chose to linger as a ghost rather than \"go on\", because, by his own admission, he feared death.[12] He became the resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and would spend his life after death there.[4] By at least 1890, there was a bust carved in his honour that was located in the Faculty Tower, next to one of Phineas Nigellus Black.[13]\n\n\"Nearly Headless Nick\", as he was called by the majority of the student body, was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction when late to class.[14]\n\nBy 1890, his bust had been gathering dust, and he wanted someone to clean it. He asked Scrope the house-elf to do so, but was rejected, and had to manipulate Scrope into doing so.[15]\n\nSir Nicholas held a Deathday Party on 31 October 1985. He was preparing for the party when Erling the Great arrived at Hogwarts. Since they shared the same deathday, Jacob's sibling and the Fat Friar suggested the two celebrate together, but it got rejected by Erling.[16]\n\nThis collision gradually escalated to a strife in which Sir Nicholas attempted to sabotage Erling's party by preserving the food which was intended to be spoiled. This act, planned and committed by Sir Nicholas, Jacob's sibling and Merula Snyde, was discovered by Professor Sprout, who later ordered Sir Nicholas to give his food to Erling and help with Herbology classes. However, upon seeing Erling's pompous attitude, he decided to carry on throwing his party despite the lack of food.[16]\n\nHalfway through his party in the Deathday Ballroom, the Fat Friar brought him to see Erling in the courtyard. Seeing as neither of their parties were going well, with Sir Nicholas's no food and Erling's requirements not fulfilled, the Fat Friar suggested once again that the two hold a party together. Sir Nicholas eventually agreed and cleared out space in the ballroom to allow Erling and his guests to join the party.[16]\n\nDuring the 1986–1987 school year, Sir Nicholas helped Jacob's sibling find the Folio of Fortinbras, a book which belonged to an old Charms Master called Fortinbras, in order to learn more about the Cursed Vaults. After they found and read the book in the Charms Classroom after searching there, they then searched the Artefact Room, where they found a scroll detailing the Beaker of Bartholomew, a bottle belonging to an Potions Master called Bartholomew. They went to look in the Potions Classroom, where he partially removed his head for them after they inquired about his name, much to their disgust.\n\nAfter finding the beaker and reading its inscription, he defended Jacob's sibling against Argus Filch who had found them there and threatened to report them, calling him a low-class bully and telling him he was supervising them. Afterwards, they searched the student's common room to find a house sigil which contained more information. After finding one, Sir Nicholas reported to them in the Great Hall he had deciphered the meaning of the sigil, he told that the message read that while Hogwarts was supposed to be safe, it kept dangerous things, thus making it more unsafe. After helping them, he told them he would happily help them again if needed, and went to stop Peeves hurling Snape's soup bowl.[17]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year, Sir Nicholas met with Jacob's sibling on the Grand Staircase to discuss how Beatrice Haywood had got trapped in a portrait with the portrait curse. He mentioned to them that he had heard a rumour years ago that a student had been stuck in a painting in the Lower Chambers Portrait Corridor, but when he had gone see the student, they had already been freed, if had ever been stuck. After mentioning a faceless interloper who had been tampering with portraits, he told them to seek Professor Binns, given he was not asleep.[18]\n\nLater during the school year, Jacob's sibling met Sir Nicholas in their brother's room, with Bill, Charlie and Percy Weasley, along with his pet rat Scabbers, where he remarked how the Fat Friar had told him about their intention to locate the Marauder's Map, which reminded him about how their brother believed a dragon could be within the castle, which only the map could reveal.\n\nHe believed the map could be within the dark and dirty room as Jacob had once been in possession of. After they searched the room with the help of Jacob's sibling Wand-Lighting Charm, they found a hand-written letter from Jacob to a student called Olivia Green, whom Nick remembered for possessing exceptional bravery for a Ravenclaw, and told them to seek the Grey Lady for answers.[19]\n\nAlso during this school year, he helped Professor Binns, a fellow ghost, teach fifth-year History of Magic students about witch-hunts of the 14th century, using his knowledge of his own execution on the subject.[20]\n\nJacob's sibling later spoke to him in the Gryffindor common room to ask if he had Peeves about, as they wanted the Vault portrait from him. He gave them advice and told them to seek the Grey Lady.[21]\n\nDuring this school year, he again helped Professor Binns teach History of Magic classes, this year helping Binns teach sixth-years about ancient runes.[22]\n\nOn 1 September 1991, Sir Nicholas, the Fat Friar and the other ghosts had an argument on whether Peeves should be allowed to attend the Start-of-Term Feast or not. Sir Nicholas was of the opinion that the poltergeist gave the ghosts a bad name with his misdoings, while the Friar wanted to \"forgive and forget\". During this discussion, the ghosts passed through the Chamber of Reception, in which the first years were waiting for the start of the Sorting Ceremony. Sir Nicholas was surprised to see the newcomers.[4]\n\nAt the feast, Sir Nicholas sat opposite Harry Potter and patted his arm when the latter was Sorted into Gryffindor. He later introduced himself and showed the result of his botched beheading: his nearly chopped neck, when Seamus Finnigan wondered how could someone be Nearly Headless.[4]\n\nLater in the year, Sir Nicholas told the Grey Lady how Harry Potter was made Seeker of Gryffindor.[23]\n\nIn 1992, Sir Nicholas tried to join for the Headless Hunt, although his application was denied by Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore, who only accepted huntsmen \"whose heads have parted company with their bodies\". Nick was embittered that \"half an inch of skin and sinew\" connecting his head and neck was not good enough to qualify as \"beheaded\".[2]\n\nAfter Harry Potter returned to the Castle after a rainy Quidditch practice on 24 October 1992, Argus Filch took him to his office in order to fill in a write-up in which Filch accused Harry of \"befouling the castle\" with mud. Sir Nicholas convinced Peeves to smash the school's Vanishing Cabinet over the office as a distraction. Nicholas later invited Harry Potter to his upcoming Deathday Party, in order to try and convince Sir Patrick to let him join the Headless Hunt.[2]\n\nIn the evening of 31 October, Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger went to Sir Nicholas's Deathday Party. Sir Nicholas greeted the attendees at the entrance of the dungeon in which the party was held. The trio did not find this party fun in the least and were eager to leave. The trio was also disgusted by the rotten and mouldy food that was present, which included stinking salmon, charcoal-black burned cakes, a maggoty haggis, furry green cheese and a tombstone cake. The Headless Hunt arrived at the party at the time for Sir Nicholas speech and became the centre of attention, as they began a match of Head Hockey leaving the embittered host ignored.[2]\n\nAlso Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore, the leader of the Headless Hunt managed to offend Sir Nicholas by pointing out that he was not properly decapitated, but the other guests found him quite amusing. This left Sir Nicholas humiliated and embarrassed for the remainder of his party. It is unknown what happened after the trio left, but it can be assumed that the party did not get any better for Sir Nicholas.\n\nLater that same evening, a message was left on one of the Castle's walls, announcing the opening of the Chamber of Secrets and Mrs Norris, Argus Filch's cat, was found petrified.[2][24]\n\nLater in the year, on 18 December 1992 Sir Nicholas was petrified on one of the Castle's corridors, along with Justin Finch-Fletchley.[25] Sir Nicholas inadvertently saved Justin's life by taking the brunt of the Basilisk's otherwise-lethal gaze, with Justin seeing the basilisk through Nick rather than being directly exposed to its vision. Nick received the full blast of its power, but as a ghost it was naturally impossible for him to die again.[26]\n\nJustin was then carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra, but nobody seemed to know what to do for Sir Nicholas. This could have been the first time that a ghost was petrified, as Petrification does not seem to be something that happens often, seeing as it is incredibly advanced Dark Magic. In the end, Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan and gave it to Ernie Macmillan with instructions to waft the ghost up the stairs, most likely towards the hospital wing.[25]\n\nBy the end of the year, Professor Sprout's Mandrakes had fully matured and were used to make a Mandrake Restorative Draught which was administered to revive all those who had been Petrified, including Sir Nicholas. The method by which the draught was administered to Sir Nicholas is unknown.\n\nHe was later seen in the Great Hall at the End-of-Term Fest greeting Hermione after she was revived. He was not present in the Great Hall when Hagrid returned to the school after his stint in Azkaban.[27]\n\nDuring the Hallowe'en feast on 31 October 1993, the school ghosts provided the entertainment, as they did a bit of formation gliding. On his five-hundred and first Deathday, Sir Nicholas hosted a reenactment of his own beheading, which was deemed a success.[28]\n\nIn the afternoon of 1 September 1994, the Hogwarts ghosts gathered to decide whether Peeves should be allowed to attend the Start-of-Term Feast. The Fat Friar wanted to give him another chance, but both Sir Nicholas and the Bloody Baron decided against it.\n\nAs a result, Peeves wreaked havoc in the kitchens, spilling soup all over the place and scattering pots and pans everywhere. At the Start-of-Term Feast, Sir Nicholas let this incident slip at the Gryffindor table, shocking Hermione Granger that \"slave labour\" made their dinner.[29]\n\nBy 1995, there was a tetraptych of Sir Nicholas hung in the Suspension Bridge entrance.[30]\n\nAt the Start-of-Term Feast in 1995, Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Neville Longbottom found seats together about halfway down the table, between Sir Nicholas and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown.\n\nAs the Sorting Hat sung a song warning students to stand together, Sir Nicholas told them that the Hat gave warnings at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school and that peaceful cooperation between the Houses is the key. Ron ended up saying Sir Nicholas was terrified of the Bloody Baron, annoying the ghost.[10]\n\nA week later on 7 September, Sir Nicholas looked for the Bloody Baron to see if he could dissuade Peeves from dropping a bust of Paracelsus on top of anyone who passed the corridor in which the bust stood.[31]\n\nOn 20 November 1995, Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, while on their way to visit Rubeus Hagrid after his return, crossed paths with Sir Nicholas, who was gliding along absent-mindedly humming something that sounded like Weasley is Our King.[32]\n\nAfter Sirius Black, Harry Potter's godfather, was murdered at the hands of Bellatrix Lestrange during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries on 18 June 1996, Harry asked Sir Nicholas if he could return as a ghost. Sir Nicholas explained to him that only a wizard afraid of death might choose to become a ghost and that a person like Sirius would not do something like that. Nicholas apologised that he could not be of more help to Harry and departed for the Leaving Feast.[12]\n\nWith the rumours of Harry Potter's status as the 'Chosen One' following the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Sir Nicholas noted during the Start-of-Term Feast, on 1 September 1996, that his friendship with Harry had increased his own reputation among the other ghosts as a possible source of information. However, Nicholas openly stated his loyalty to Harry and his refusal to pester him for information.[33]\n\nOn the early hours of 22 April 1997, the Bloody Baron saw Albus Dumbledore return to the Castle from one of his missions to find Voldemort's Horcruxes and reported it to Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington. Sir Nicholas later told this to Harry Potter.[34]\n\nAlbus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts, was killed at the hands of Severus Snape in the former's plan on 30 June 1997.[35] The Hogwarts ghosts were known attendees of his funeral in early July; this likely included Sir Nicholas.[36]\n\nOn 1 August 1997, the Ministry of Magic was taken over by Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters.[37] By 1 September 1997, Severus Snape was made headmaster of Hogwarts while his fellow Death Eaters, Alecto Carrow and Amycus Carrow became the Muggle Studies and Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers respectively.[38]\n\nThe Carrows were put in charge of all discipline and punishments, which were violent. It is likely that Sir Nicholas, as did the Heads of House, tried to protect the pupils from Alecto and Amycus.[39]\n\nOn 2 May 1998, the Battle of Hogwarts ensued after Voldemort learned Harry Potter was in the premises. The ghosts, including Sir Nicholas, attended a gathering in the Great Hall, in which Professor McGonagall gave instructions on evacuation of underage students and Kingsley Shacklebolt organised the participants for battle.\n\nHarry Potter, needing information on the whereabouts of Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem, asked Nick who the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower was. Although he was initially slightly hurt that Harry needed another ghost rather than him, he pointed the Grey Lady to him.[40] Later on, the ghosts gathered at the Great Hall, joining the mass mourning over the fallen.[41]\n\nWhen the Second Wizarding War came to an end, it is highly likely that the ghosts (including Sir Nicholas) celebrated Harry's victory and Voldemort's demise.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of the Calamity, Sir Nicholas met and befriended Constance Pickering, who enjoyed listening to his stories despite finding him \"terribly daft\".[42]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the late 2010s or early 2020s, Sir Nicholas met with a Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, where they discussed how his long time spent being living and dead had given him a unique perspective on loss. Nick suggested to the investigator that emotion could fuel desperate acts of magic, heightening the investigator's understanding of the Calamity spell. Nick also met with a member of the task force training to become a Professor and discussed his fears about death and avoiding dying with them, helping them to increase the amount of damage they could withstand during combat.[43]\n\nDuring a Calamity surge in May 2020 focused on the Inter-House Quidditch Cup, Sir Nicholas was trapped as a Foundable, with members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force returning him to his proper time. Professor Minerva McGonagall wanted to ask him for his opinions on the Calamity, as, having been somewhat separated from his original self already, he might have had interesting insights into the nature of Foundables.[44]\n\nDuring a Calamity surge in December 2020 focused on Grim Fawley's memories of Christmases spent at Hogwarts with ghosts and portraits of the Hogwarts founders, Sir Nicholas suddenly developed a clear memory of Grim telling him to stand guard in the Grand Staircase \"until he's been found\". Nick informed Professor McGonagall of this memory, with McGonagall discussing with Minister for Magic Hermione Granger as to whether Grim was trying to tell them that someone was hiding in or behind one of the portraits in the Grand Staircase. Nick's memory was later revealed to be in reference to Kit Gerrard, whom Nick found trapped within the portrait of Merlin in the Grand Staircase with no memory of who he was or how he had gotten there.[45]\n\nAs a ghost, Sir Nicholas was pearly-white and slightly transparent.[4] He would usually sport a ruff, which would ensure his partially severed head stayed in place,[2] as well as tights,[4] a pair of breeches,[6] a doublet[29] or, occasionally, a tunic.[2] He had a preference for extravagant plumed hats.[2][12] He also sported long curly hair, and a small moustache and goatee.[2][6] He carried himself in a prim fashion[10] and spoke in an airy,[2] delicate tone.[4]\n\nSir Nicholas was affable, kind, and always willing to lend a hand to any of his fellow Gryffindors whenever they needed it.[14] Nicholas apparently enjoyed eating during his lifetime, as after his death he spent the feasts at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry looking wistfully at the food.[10] He was also polite and delicate, staying away from potentially indiscreet questions[14] and sensible about the fact that he was no longer living.[10][33]\n\nNicholas showed interest in the lives of the students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and took delight in showing off his wound to the dismay of those around him.[14] He was very proud of his bravery and noble heritage, getting easily offended if anyone referred to him as a coward.[10] He was very sociable, being friends with the Grey Lady,[23] Harry Potter,[2] and a number of other ghosts who attended his five-hundredth Deathday Party.[2] He also had a cordial relationship with the Bloody Baron[10] and Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.[2] He did not enjoy being known as Nearly Headless Nick, and preferred to be addressed by his full name or Sir Nicholas.[4]\n\nNicholas is from the Greek Nikolaos, \"victory of the people\". Nick is a jokey, ironic nickname and pun -- one definition of nick is \"to cut slightly\", and he received more than just a little cut when he was beheaded. Sir indicates he was knighted by a British monarch when he was alive. Porpington is a name Rowling made up and is closest to porpentine, an obsolete name for a porcupine. \"Like quills upon the fretful porpentine...\": From Shakespeare's Hamlet. Nick can be a prickly-tempered person at times. Mimsy may have come from the same word coined by Alice in Wonderland author Lewis Carroll. It appears in his nonsense poem \"The Jabberwocky\": \"All mimsy were the borogoves...\"",
