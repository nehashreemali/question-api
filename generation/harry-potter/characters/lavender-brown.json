  "content": "Lavender Brown (c. 1980–2 May 1998)[2] was a pure-blood[3] witch, the daughter of Mr and Mrs Brown, and sorted into Gryffindor. She started her education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991, the same year as the famous Harry Potter.\n\nWhile at Hogwarts Lavender began studying Divination, which she was fascinated by. In her fifth year she joined Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter that sought to combat the Death Eaters, despite Lavender initially doubting Harry's claims that Lord Voldemort had returned. The following year she started a relationship with Ron Weasley, though they soon broke up.\n\nIn her final year of schooling Lavender joined the reconstituted D.A. to oppose Death Eater control of Hogwarts and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. During the battle, she was savaged by werewolf Fenrir Greyback and died of her injuries.\n\nLavender was born in 1979 or 1980 to Mr and Mrs Brown. Since she was a pure-blood, all four of her grandparents must have been wizards.\n\nShe received her acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at age eleven, and purchased her equipment from Diagon Alley before the start of her first year.\n\nLavender began attending Hogwarts in 1991, the same year as famous wizard Harry Potter, at the age of eleven and was the first of the first-years to be Sorted into Gryffindor House, much to the delight of her peers.[6]\n\nShe shared a dormitory with Hermione Granger, Parvati Patil, and two other girls and soon became best friends with Parvati. However, she did not get along as well with Hermione as she did with the other three girls; Hermione was believed by most to be a loner and made friends with boys more often than girls, and she who was rather studious, may have been better suited with Ravenclaw girls than with the excitable, brave Gryffindor girls such as Lavender, Parvati, and their roommates.\n\nIn her second year, Lavender was one of the students present in Professor Binns's History of Magic class when Hermione asked about the Chamber of Secrets; like the rest of the class, Lavender paid much more attention at this point, even rising her head off her arms.[11]\n\nLavender attended Professor Lockhart's Duelling Club, and when Lockhart was disarmed by Professor Snape, she handed him back his wand.[12] It is likely that Lavender had a crush on Lockhart, like many other female students.\n\nIn her third year, Lavender started Divination and Care of Magical Creatures classes. When Divination Professor Sybill Trelawney saw a Grim (a death omen in the form of a spectral dog) while seeking divinatory insight in the dregs of tea in the bottom of Harry's tea cup, Lavender was amongst the very few students in the class who, like Harry and Dean Thomas (both students who grew up with Muggles and unaware of magic until their letters arrived), did not initially know what Grims were.[13]\n\nShe soon developed a good relationship with Professor Trelawney, who accurately predicted — or guessed — the death of Lavender's pet rabbit named Binky, when the professor said that what Lavender was dreading would occur on the sixteenth of October, and on that day, Lavender received news that her rabbit, who had been a baby at the time, had been mauled to death by a fox. Hermione pointed out that Lavender could not possibly have dreaded something unexpected and that the death must have happened days before the news arrived, but Lavender had faith in Trelawney's abilities and was upset by Hermione's rather tactless attempt at comforting her.[13]\n\nDuring her fourth year, Hogwarts hosted the Triwizard Tournament. This tournament was a series of challenges for wizards to enter if they believed themselves capable. There was also an age restriction on who was allowed to enter the tournament. Fourth year Harry Potter was selected as the Hogwarts champion, along with Hufflepuff Cedric Diggory. As one of the traditions, the tournament held a ball and Lavender attended the Yule Ball with fellow Gryffindor student Seamus Finnigan, likely just as friends, since there was no indication the two liked each other. Her best friend Parvati ended up going as Harry's date.[14]\n\nThat same year, when Care of Magical Creatures professor Rubeus Hagrid attempted to see if Blast-Ended Skrewts hibernated (which they did not), Lavender demonstrated her Gryffindor courage by staying to help collect the runaways. She, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and other Gryffindors did this instead of fleeing into the hut like the Slytherins. The Skrewts singed her school robes in the process. It is safe to say that Lavender (and her classmates) did not enjoy this lesson.\n\nLater that year, Barty Crouch Jnr, in disguise as Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Moody, used the Imperius Curse on her in class, thus forcing her to humiliate herself publicly by imitating a squirrel. Hermione Granger, who by then was an acquaintance of Lavender's, was not impressed that Barty Crouch Jnr had the nerve to teach the three Unforgivable Curses in school and was appalled when he demonstrated them on Lavender and the other students. She didn't come to the aid of Lavender when she was being humiliated, although she likely felt bad for her, but she did stick up for Neville Longbottom when he was horrified by the demonstration of the Cruciatus Curse on a spider.[14]\n\nAt the end of the year, Lavender would attend the leaving feast. This feast was held as a memorial service to the late Cedric Diggory. Cedric was murdered by Peter Pettigrew on the orders of Lord Voldemort, during the third task of the Triwizard Tournament. During this service, Albus Dumbledore took the liberty upon himself to inform the students of Hogwarts that Lord Voldemort was at large once again.[14] It is unknown how Lavender took this news after it was first announced.\n\nIn her fifth year, when Harry Potter announced the return of Lord Voldemort, Lavender, like many others, initially believed the Ministry of Magic propaganda that Harry was lying, much to her acquaintance Hermione's irritation. On the second day of the school year, Ernie Macmillan's public of support of Harry and his claims seemed to force her to begin to question her own beliefs.\n\nIt is possible that Seamus Finnigan, a fellow Gryffindor may have been putting doubts into her head also as he strongly supported the Ministry and Lavender was close with Seamus. The same year, Dolores Umbridge was appointed the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor as a way for the Ministry at large to keep tabs on Hogwarts.[15]\n\nHowever, despite the claims that Harry had been lying, Lavender was one of the first students to arrive at the Hog's Head for the first meeting of what would become Dumbledore's Army. She learned many different defensive and offensive charms from Harry. When the D.A. practised casting the highly advanced Patronus Charm, Lavender was only able to achieve puffs of silver vapour, and was becoming increasingly frustrated that she could not do it.[15]\n\nLater on in the year, High Inquisitor Dolores Umbridge began inspecting the teachers of Hogwarts and Lavender was saddened when Professor Trelawney was temporarily sacked by Umbridge after her inspection, and even brought her some nice daffodils, though she continued to take the class under the centaur Firenze, upon whom both she and Parvati had a crush, despite him being half-man and half-horse. This year Lavender took her O.W.L. examinations and practised basic Locomotion Charms with Parvati the week leading up to the examinations.[15]\n\nLavender achieved a high grade on her O.W.L. examinations for: Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, and Transfiguration, as she attended N.E.W.T.-level classes in these subjects. However, she did not continue on with Potions. Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger were the only Gryffindors who attended N.E.W.T.-level class for that subject.[5] It is also likely that she achieved a high mark in Divination as well, given her passion for the subject.\n\nBy the beginning of her sixth year, Lavender had developed a crush on Ron Weasley. She complimented him, flirted with him, and wished him luck in his Quidditch games. After a particularly good performance in one of those games, Ron displayed affection for Lavender as well, grateful for her wishing him luck, and the two had their first kiss and begun to date. This greatly upset Hermione Granger, as she had hoped Ron would attend Professor Slughorn's Christmas party with her and she had expected a more than platonic relationship to develop between them. It is unclear if Lavender was aware of her roommate's feelings for Ron, though it seems likely that she would not have gotten involved with Ron if she realised that he was dating her largely to make Hermione jealous.[5]\n\nDuring the two months in which the two dated, they were seemingly very happy together, and were often seen kissing enthusiastically in public. For Christmas, Lavender sent Ron a gaudy necklace which read 'My Sweetheart' dangling from a chain. He disliked it immensely and after the holidays, their relationship began to go downhill. Lavender was very upset when Ron was poisoned, and when he increasingly pulled away from her. He feigned sleep when she came to visit him in the Hospital Wing, avoided her, and became visibly annoyed with her affections.[5]\n\nWorried that her relationship with Ron was fading, she sought out the advice of his best friend, Harry Potter. She would talk to Harry about Ron's feelings, making him feel uncomfortable. Ron also reconciled with Hermione and spent increasing amounts of time with her, making Lavender suspicious. After she saw Ron and Hermione leave the Gryffindor dormitory seemingly alone (since Harry was under his Invisibility Cloak) she ended their relationship, much to Ron's relief, as he had begun to feel attracted to Hermione and felt as if their relationship was not the best thing for them. She attended Dumbledore's funeral at the end of the year.[5]\n\nDuring her final year at Hogwarts, Lavender joined the second Dumbledore's Army to oppose Death Eater control of the school. She most likely took part in the disruptions the D.A. were responsible for throughout the year. Like others, she eventually took to hiding in the Room of Requirement. She may have been responsible for it forming a bathroom with washing facilities.[16]\n\nLavender fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, along with other members of the D.A. She was most likely one of the many students who defended Harry when Pansy Parkinson wanted to hand him over to Lord Voldemort. During the battle she fell from a balcony and was attacked and savaged by werewolf Fenrir Greyback.\n\nRushing to her aid, Hermione blasted Greyback away from her with a powerful spell. Professor Trelawney then dropped a crystal ball on his head. Immediately after the attack, she was seen stirring feebly, and later died from her injuries.[16]\n\nLavender was a somewhat silly and sentimental girl,[5] though she was also brave, being sorted into Gryffindor house and fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts.[16] She was lively and loved to be the centre of attention, but tended to react in an extreme way to everyday situations, either laughing or crying hysterically and could be easily offended or emotional.[5] She was also known to squeal and giggle at certain things and did so frequently. She could also be insensitive and childish, acting very possessive and over-protective of Ron when she was his girlfriend, even going so far as to say he looked \"interesting\" when he was poisoned.\n\nShe frequently expressed her feelings for him in odd ways, such as calling him \"Won-Won\", sending him a necklace that made him cringe, writing his name in smog on the Hogwarts Express, and snogging him on a continuous basis, not infrequently in public view. Inevitably, her heart was always in the right place, and during their time of dating Ron reciprocated many of her affections as well. She had a tendency to offend or annoy other people, if not always deliberately.[5]\n\nShe had a great interest in Divination despite the subject being often regarded as \"woolly\" and had reverence for Professor Trelawney, even though she was something of a fraud.[13] This implied that she was gullible, often taking Trelawney's words to heart. Additionally, she initially believed the Ministry's propaganda against Harry Potter, but she eventually began to doubt the Ministry's claims, hugely because of her friends' influence.[15]\n\nMuch of her personality heavily implies that her social skills may have been poor. This is supported by the fact that she only had one known friend at school, Parvati Patil, and they often had awkward interactions at the expense of others. However, even Parvati was uncomfortable by the fact that her relationship with Ron was becoming increasingly unhealthy. She stood quite in contrast with her acquaintance and roommate, the more pragmatic and socially stable Hermione Granger.\n\nParvati Patil was Lavender's best friend and roommate, and was often seen in her company. The two seemed to share many interests and character traits, including a keen interest in Divination, as well as a fondness for more appealing types of magical creatures, like unicorns.[14] They were also brave as they were both sorted into Gryffindor house.[6]\n\nThe two were often seen giggling and gossiping together during their school days, and shared a friendship with Professor Trelawney. Parvati became very uncomfortable with how seriously Lavender took her relationship with Ron Weasley in their sixth year. Parvati was often embarrassed by the behaviour of her friend in regards to Ron, though despite this the two remained close.[5] Her reaction to Lavender's death is unknown, although she was likely devastated at the death of her closest friend.\n\nIn 1996, during her sixth year, Lavender developed a crush on fellow Gryffindor Ron Weasley. She took to complimenting him and flirting with him, which Ron seemed surprised and flattered by, though he was interested in Hermione Granger at the time. However, after Ron became angry with Hermione, he began to appreciate Lavender's care for him and entered into a romantic relationship with Lavender. The romance consisted mostly of snogging, often in public, much to the disgust of Hermione, who was jealous and hurt, and of Ron's younger sister Ginny, who considered him a \"filthy hypocrite\" because he insulted her for being caught kissing her boyfriend earlier in the year.[5]\n\nLavender was very affectionate with, and possessive of, Ron, adopting the name of \"Won-Won\" for him and sending him a necklace for Christmas saying \"My Sweetheart\" on it, which he greatly disliked and was shocked that she would think it was to his taste. The romance began to cool on Ron's end after the Christmas holidays, which Lavender noticed and was very upset by.\n\nShe repeatedly pressed Harry Potter for details of Ron's feelings for her, and alarmed even her best friend Parvati with how obsessively she threw herself into the relationship. Lavender was infuriated when no one thought to inform her after Ron was poisoned, especially since Ron took to feigning sleep whenever she came to visit him in the infirmary, and reconciled with Hermione. After being released, Ron took to avoiding his girlfriend.[5]\n\nRon was spared the difficult task of breaking up with Lavender when she ended things with him, convinced that there was something going on between him and Hermione. Afterwards, Ron was clearly content, but Lavender was upset for some time. For example, when Ron brushed fake snow off Hermione's shoulders soon after the break-up, Lavender burst into tears. Ron did show genuine guilt for having left her.[5] When Ron saw Lavender being savaged by Fenrir Greyback, he was clearly horrified and concerned, but Hermione beat him to saving her.\n\nLavender and Parvati were not nearly as close to their other roommate, Hermione Granger, as they were to one another. Though the girls did not appear to dislike each other, they had very different interests and sometimes clashed as a result. For example, Hermione scorned Divination, Lavender and Parvati's favourite subject.[13] She also became irked with Lavender for doubting Harry Potter's assertion that Lord Voldemort had returned in 1995.[15]\n\nThough Hermione was jealous of Ron and Lavender's relationship, she directed her anger mostly at Ron, perhaps indicating that Lavender was initially unaware of Hermione's feelings for him. Eventually, however, Lavender started to become jealous and suspicious of the time Ron and Hermione spent together, while her boyfriend was increasingly pulled away from her.\n\nAlthough Hermione was glad when they broke up, she tried to spare Lavender's feelings by not being openly affectionate with Ron.[5] During the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione spotted Lavender being savaged by Fenrir Greyback, blasting him away immediately, although it was too late as Lavender was already dead at the time.[16]\n\nLavender seemed to have a reasonably close and caring relationship with Divination professor Sybill Trelawney; she had an unwavering faith in the reliability of Trelawney's predictions and was often seen comforting or supporting her when she was experiencing difficult times. She and Parvati became offended on the professor's behalf when Hermione made her disdain for Trelawney and the subject she taught clear in 1993.[13] When she was temporarily sacked by Dolores Umbridge, Lavender and Parvati brought Trelawney some daffodils.[15]\n\nDuring the Battle of Hogwarts, Trelawney prevented Fenrir Greyback from savaging Lavender any further after Hermione Granger blasted him away by dropping a crystal ball on his head. However, during the course of the fighting, Lavender succumbed to her wounds.[16]\n\nLavender became a member of Dumbledore's Army during her fifth year. Dumbledore's Army was an organisation founded by Harry Potter, Ron and Hermione, and led by Harry, in order to teach the students Defence Against the Dark Arts, something that professor Dolores Umbridge did not; thinking that the students would use their magic against the Ministry of Magic.[15]\n\nLavender was a friend of fellow members Neville Longbottom, Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan. Lavender may have been a friend of Luna Lovegood, too, although, when the two girls met each other, Lavender made fun of Luna for her strange earrings.[15]\n\nLavender is a type of flower, as well as a name for the pale shade of purple of the blossoms. In flower symbolism, the lavender can symbolise affection, cleansing, or concealment. The Ancient Romans used lavender to scent baths, and its name is derived from the Latin verb lavāre, \"to wash\". In Western culture, the colour lavender can sometimes be used to symbolise decadence and the enjoyment of sensuality. Interestingly, \"Lavender\" is a colour and her last name is \"Brown\", which is also a colour.",
