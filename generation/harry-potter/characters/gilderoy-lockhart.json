  "content": "Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, O.M. (Third Class) (b. 26 January[1][2] 1964)[1] was an English half-blood wizard, a Ravenclaw student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and later a famous wizarding celebrity who authored many books on dark creatures and his supposed encounters with them.[3]\n\nPrior to his tenure as Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, specifically during the 1992–1993 school year, he received many prestigious awards, such as Order of Merlin, Third Class; Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defence League; and the Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile Award five times in a row.[5] He also invented an Occamy egg yolk shampoo at some point. This shampoo, however, was too dangerous and expensive for open market; it subsequently became his dream to be able to market and sell the product.[15] His favourite colour was lilac.[5]\n\nLockhart claimed he did many heroic acts, but it was later found out that he did not actually do them. He instead used his considerable talent in Memory Charms to force the actual people who had done them into forgetting what they did, while he took credit for the acts. Ironically, Lockhart lost all of his memory on 29 May 1993 due to a backfired Memory Charm cast by Ron Weasley's damaged wand.[16]\n\nLockhart then became a permanent resident of St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. He was institutionalised in the same ward as Neville Longbottom's parents (the Janus Thickey Ward for permanent spell damage).[14] Following his hospitalisation, he dictated his final book entitled Who Am I?.[17]\n\nGilderoy Lockhart was born on 26 January[1][2] 1964[1] to a Muggle father and a witch mother, and had two elder sisters, both of whom were Squibs.[3] As the only one of her three children to exhibit magical ability, Gilderoy swiftly became their mother's unashamed favourite, thus greatly inflating young Gilderoy's sense of self-importance. He and his mother forgot, in their excitement, that Hogwarts was a school for all British and Irish wizards, and thus his introduction into the school along with everyone else was, in his eyes, extremely dull.[3]\n\nGilderoy Lockhart entered Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on 1 September 1975, a year below Jacob, and four years below James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, Lily Evans, and Severus Snape. He was Sorted into Ravenclaw, but he came close to being a Hatstall, as the Sorting Hat also found him an excellent fit for Slytherin,[3][18] but decided against it by a narrow margin.\n\nHe had hoped to be greeted by fans and thus become very popular, as in his mind he was already a fully-fledged genius with an exceptional magical prowess; the fact that he was merely ordinary, that more talented and gifted children were there, and that nobody was particularly impressed by his naturally wavy hair, disappointed him. He did have above-average abilities, and he was cleverer than most of his classmates, but he had a bad flaw in that he would not try unless he was confident that he was the best of whichever particular team, group, or class he happened to be with at the time.[3]\n\nGilderoy did achieve good marks and his teachers did think that, with hard work, he might be able to make something of himself. Even if he fell short of his ambitions that he would freely share with anyone who bothered listening (he told them that he would succeed in creating a Philosopher's Stone before leaving school and that he intended to captain England's Quidditch team to World Cup glory, before knuckling down to becoming Britain's youngest Minister for Magic).[3] Despite this, according to him at some point during his education he managed to play as Seeker for the Ravenclaw Quidditch team.[4]\n\nHis vanity was such that he valued learning not for education, but because it granted him attention; he craved attention and prizes, and begged the Headmaster to start a school newspaper purely so he could see his own name in print. When this exploit failed to grant him any attention, he took to grander, more dramatic means of garnering attention. Though he had never been popular with the other students, he did manage to achieve small notoriety by carving his signature in twenty foot long letters into the Quidditch pitch (which also earned him a weeks' worth of detentions), creating a spell that shot a hologram of his own face into the sky in imitation of the Dark Mark, and sending himself eight-hundred Valentines, causing breakfast to be cancelled due to the number of droppings and feathers in the porridge. He increasingly devoted his talents to insincere shortcuts and cowardly dodges, focused on attention-seeking and neglecting true learning.[3]\n\nAfter his graduation from Hogwarts in 1982 (with a faint sigh of relief from the school staff), Lockhart became an accomplished author, travelling to exotic parts of the world and, having mastered Memory Charms shortly after his graduation, tricking accomplished witches and wizards into revealing their greatest deeds and then erasing their memories, pretending he had done the things they did in his autobiographies. This sole focus on Memory Charms came at heavy cost. He didn't use any other magical spell or charms, causing him to become rather unclever in other skills.[3]\n\nEach time he returned to Britain, he brought with him a new book that chronicled an adventure that had supposedly happened over his travels. The books themselves were also self-promoting and filled with a wealth of invented details that were nothing but conceit, self-praise, vanity, gross exaggerations, and idle speculations that were all hot air and bilge water;[3] known victims of his trickery included an Armenian warlock and a witch with a hairy chin.[16] His books were very popular, and he reserved a special quill of peacock feather just for book signings.[11]\n\nHe also received many awards for his supposedly great deeds and was invited to join the Dark Force Defence League as an honorary member,[5] all the while managing to successfully hide his fraudulence. His former teachers, who were unaware of his status as a con artist, began to think that they might have misjudged him, due to his supposed bravery and resilience in combating the Dark Arts.[3]\n\nAccording to Lockhart, he initially believed that the more exposure he got in the press, the better his career would progress. By the time he was writing his second bestseller, Gadding with Ghouls, he became overexposed, something that damaged his popularity. He then went mysteriously \"missing\" for three weeks, after which he leaked to the Daily Prophet that he had apparently been captured by trolls in the wilds of Stockton-on-Tees. The story boosted his popularity once again. Through this experience, he claimed that one must be \"sparing with [one's] public appearances, at first\", as one might become overexposed.[19]\n\nAt some point after the release of Wanderings with Werewolves, Gilderoy held a Wagga Wagga Werewolf symposium centred around his alleged experiences fending off the Dark Forces to talk about his supposed defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf. Many influential people attended, including Cecil Lee of the Werewolf Capture Unit.[20] During this event, he gave a public demonstration of the Homorphus Charm,[20] which he claimed he could cast so effectively as to cure werewolves.[21] During the same conference, he also said that werewolves were weakened by sunlight, which was incorrect.[20]\n\nOutside of writing, Lockhart was an amateur potioneer. He invented a shampoo that guaranteed lustrous locks of hair, one of his few claims that proved to be true. However, due to its main ingredient being too dangerous and expensive to procure, it was never produced for mass marketing.[15]\n\nIn 1988, Lockhart came to visit Hogwarts shortly before Valentine's Day as a part of his book tour. He invited six Hogwarts students to his book signing at Flourish and Blotts, claiming the students were randomly selected.[22]\n\nAfter the book signing, he and the six students went to Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop, where he informed the students that they were special guests and planners of an event called Voyages, Vampires, and Valentines! held at the tea shop on Valentine's Day. In reality, he was planning to use this as an opportunity to learn the students' stories and Obliviate them afterwards in order to use these stories for a new book. At some point, he talked about his plan on the Grand Staircase, where it was heard by the portrait of Sir Cadogan.[22]\n\nDuring the event, Gilderoy Lockhart interviewed the students. During the interviews, two of the students involved, one of whom was Jacob's sibling, figured out that Lockhart was using the students and planned to inform Albus Dumbledore. In order to avoid exposure, Lockhart cast a Memory Charm on the students. As the spell was cast hastily, the students only forgot parts of their recent memories. Lockhart soon escaped the tea shop by Disapparating.[22]\n\nLockhart returned to Hogwarts in the 1988–1989 school year and gave a speech about himself at the outdoor celebration of magic. He demanded to clear the dance area to demonstrate his duelling expertise, but Jacob's sibling intervened and duelled Lockhart themselves on the Training Grounds. After losing the duel, Lockhart still did not want to leave, so Jacob's sibling transfigured a gobstone into a skunk, which sprayed Lockhart, forcing him to leave.[23]\n\nIn February 1989, around Valentine's Day, Lockart held a book signing in Flourish and Blotts. Jacob's sibling approached him to ask for advice about love for an essay-writing competition. Lockhart gave them useful advice and was flattered that they asked him.[24]\n\nAlbus Dumbledore, the Headmaster during Lockhart's time, happened to know two of the wizards whose memories Lockhart erased and easily deduced the truth behind Lockhart's fame and decided to make Lockhart pay for his crimes. Even so, Dumbledore lacked hard evidence to back up his speculation. He correctly believed that dragging Lockhart into a normal, school atmosphere would reveal his fraudulence, and with a vacancy in Defence Against the Dark Arts having opened up, tracked down the author and offered Lockhart a job at Hogwarts (something Lockhart had not been too keen to do, as he saw how well his career as an author was progressing and because those who knew him from his time as a student like Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape were still there as well).[3]\n\nDumbledore slyly hinted that Harry Potter was a student at the school, and being a teacher to the \"famous Harry\" would propel Lockhart's fame into the stratosphere. Ego, fame-hunger, and glory-thirst overruled caution, and Lockhart took the job. The other teachers remembered Lockhart as the obnoxious attention seeker back then, regardless of his \"later achievements\", and were baffled at Dumbledore for inviting Lockhart to teach; Professor McGonagall, in particular, asked Dumbledore what possibly could be learned from such a vainglorious man, to which the headmaster replied that there was plenty to learn from even a bad teacher: what not to do, and how not to be.[3]\n\nHagrid correctly deduced that Lockhart only got the job because he was the only applicant for the jinxed position due to the fact that no one at the Ministry who was a specialist in Defence Against the Dark Arts with impeccable credentials or who was a trained professional who worked in either the Auror Office or the Dark Force Defence League wanted the job because of what happened to Quirinus Quirrell at the end of the 1991–1992 school year.[25] The only faculty member who wanted the job was Severus Snape, who did not particularly relish his current duty as Potions Master, but had done well at the job. Snape did not know the full story of Dumbledore's decision, and was perplexed at being passed over for a flamboyant wizard. Snape was at least correct in seeing Lockhart's lack of magical skills for such a job.\n\nLockhart thus became the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for the 1992–1993 school year, and several of his books were assigned for the course that year, resulting in an unusually expensive book list (as pointed out by the Weasley twins).[10] In August 1992, Lockhart went to Flourish and Blotts to sign books to his fans and announce his employment; it was there that he met Harry Potter for the first time. He became quite excited and dragged Harry to the front, taking as many pictures as he could with the famous boy and then gifting him all of the set books in an attempt to garner some of Harry's affection. This incident, in fact, embarrassed Harry, who gave his books to Ginny Weasley, both because he could afford his own set and also because he did not particularly cherish his interaction with Lockhart.[11]\n\nBeing the only willing applicant for the jinxed position, Gilderoy Lockhart became Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 1992–1993 school year. His classroom and office at Hogwarts were decorated with pictures and portraits of himself (before the class started, Fred thought that the teacher must be a fan of Lockhart, for which he was certainly correct)[5] which moved and smiled (there was even one of himself as a classical artist painting another medieval version portrait of himself).[26] He also decorated the office with copies of his publications.[25]\n\nFor his first lesson, he showed everyone in his class what he really was. He first did this when he gave his second-year class a \"little quiz\" which was filled with questions that had nothing to do with Defence Against the Dark Arts, but instead concerned his autobiography, Magical Me, and the parts of his books just referring to him, such as what his favourite colour and his ideal birthday present was; he simply wanted to see how much the class had read his books. Despite his claim of \"little\", it ran for three pages with fifty-four questions, and only Hermione Granger got all of them correct.[5]\n\nLockhart, delighted with Hermione's perfect score, awarded Gryffindor ten house points. He then showed his true colours a second time when he proceeded to release a cage full of \"freshly caught\" Cornish Pixies into the classroom, causing a large amount of pandemonium. He demonstrated his incompetence further a third time when he tried to stop them with a spell that had absolutely no effect on the pixies and then irresponsibly instructed Harry, Ron, and Hermione to clean up after the mess while running back into his office.[5]\n\nLockhart was not the least bit popular among his fellow Hogwarts staff members and constantly gave them unsolicited pieces of advice on their specialities. Harry and his friends (except for Hermione) also found him quite obnoxious and could not take him seriously as a Professor. Even Rubeus Hagrid, the Gamekeeper, who usually refrained from criticising a teacher, showed public disdain for Lockhart.[25] Many male students, such as Ron Weasley, immediately saw that Lockhart was an annoying and incompetent fool whose reason for doing so poorly was because he had no idea what he was doing, and gave him very little respect outside of his presence. However, Lockhart's charms had attracted many schoolgirls such as Hermione and Susan Bones. Muggle-born students who had recently been introduced into the wizarding world, such as Justin Finch-Fletchley and Colin Creevey,[5] also admired Lockhart due to their lack of experience with the magical community, and easily ate up his tall tales.\n\nAfter the pixie chaos, Lockhart did not bring any more live creatures into class, but instead read from his books and re-enacted several portions of his \"achievements\", sometimes dragging Harry to help him with it. The only reason Harry agreed to do so was to get signed permission from Lockhart for a book in the Restricted Section of the library, which Lockhart signed without even paying attention to what book they wanted (Hermione claimed she was interested in reading more about slow-acting venoms, but in reality she wanted to learn how to brew Polyjuice Potion).[27]\n\nHis idea of homework included composing a poem of one of his alleged achievements and offered a signed copy of his autobiography as a reward to the best composer.[27] Due to Lockhart's overall poor performances, the class did not learn anything about true Defence Against the Dark Arts, and Ron claimed that he only learned not to set pixies loose, and would have dropped the course had he been allowed to.[28] Lockhart's once powerful potential had been wasted from years of misuse and neglect, resulting in him being unable to properly teach (or even understand what he was attempting at times).[3]\n\nFor the majority of the year, Lockhart kept hounding on Harry, trying to use him to boost his own fame, much to Harry's humiliation and irritation. Lockhart made it look as though Harry was trying to use his fame of defeating Lord Voldemort to make a name in the wizarding world, that the Flying Ford Anglia he rode on to school was a publicity stunt, and that he was enjoying his companionship with Lockhart and ignored much of Harry's attempted contradictions to these ridiculous hypotheses.[5]\n\nAfter Hagrid told him that Harry was more famous than him without trying, Lockhart personally requested Harry to help him answer his fan mails for detention while bombarding Harry with his advice for fame and thought Harry would think of this as a treat, much to the contrary. In fact, Harry practically begged Professor McGonagall to be in Ron's detention in assisting Argus Filch in cleaning the Trophy Room instead, though the strict Transfiguration teacher refused. Harry then suffered several long hours of dull boredom, addressing envelopes. When Harry heard mysterious voices during this detention, Lockhart thought Harry was merely tired.[25] Following the disastrous episode in which he released \"freshly caught\" Cornish pixies in class, Lockhart staged dramatic readings from his books and often chose Harry to participate in re-enactments, much to Harry's aggravation.[27]\n\nAfter a Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin, in which Harry, the Gryffindor Seeker, had his arm broken by a rogue Bludger, Lockhart offered to help repair his arm, claiming it was a charm he had used on himself many times. Ignoring Harry's refusal, stating that Harry didn't know what he was saying, he accidentally vanished all the bones in his arm with the charm Brackium Emendo.[27]\n\nLockhart founded a short-lived Duelling Club for students. He made a fool of himself at the very first meeting by firstly being disarmed by Severus Snape and then falsely claiming that he had allowed Snape to do so. He also angered a snake conjured by Draco Malfoy by launching it into the air rather than vanishing it, causing it to aim at Justin Finch-Fletchley. Lockhart was also indirectly responsible for bringing out Harry's full-fledged Parselmouth ability because if he had vanished the snake successfully, there would be no need for Harry to run at the snake and demand it to leave Justin alone. The snake was subsequently successfully vanished by Snape immediately afterwards.[29]\n\nWhen Hermione Granger was in the Hospital Wing for a malfunction dosage of Polyjuice Potion, Lockhart sent her a get-well card, with an unnecessarily long introduction of himself as a signature. Hermione slept with this under her pillow, much to Ron Weasley's disgust.[30]\n\nDuring Valentine's Day, Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes, completely redecorated the Great Hall with pink flowers and raining heart-shaped confetti as a morale-booster to cheer up the mood against the Chamber of Secrets incident, much to the distaste of Ron Weasley and the teachers. Lockhart received at least forty-six valentines, one of which was from Hermione Granger, and made unwelcome suggestions about performing Entrancing Enchantments and brewing love potions, suggesting that they should ask Professors Flitwick and Snape, respectively. This made Flitwick bury his face in his hands in embarrassment, and Snape furious enough for Harry to make a bet that he would force the first person who dared to ask him for a love potion to consume poison.[30]\n\nHe even had dwarfs wear golden wings and carry harps to deliver valentines throughout the school, which they did (even if they have to do so forcibly), much to Harry Potter's embarrassment when one forced him to listen to one from Ginny Weasley by knocking him down. This event was, ironically, somewhat a repeat of Lockhart's attempt to earn attention during his youth in Valentines Day, being equally as annoying.[30]\n\nWhen the Chamber of Secrets was opened, Lockhart made false claims that he knew where the Chamber was and what Salazar Slytherin's monster was the whole time. He even claimed that he knew Rubeus Hagrid was guilty all along when the Minister for Magic arrested the gamekeeper, even though it was only done as a precaution. While the other teachers were serious and tense from all the attacks, Lockhart was the only one who remained relaxed and unconcerned about these security measures. For instance, after Ginny Weasley was taken into the Chamber, he walked into the Hogwarts staffroom and simply told the other present Professors \"So sorry — dozed off — what have I missed?\", showing his complete lack of awareness and smug nonchalance.[16]\n\nOn 29 May 1993, after the aforementioned occurrence, the other teachers, after giving him stony looks of hatred, told Lockhart to go down to the Chamber and deal with the monster, in response to his arrogance and many claims that he knew how to solve the problem. Instead of trying to rescue Ginny, Lockhart attempted to flee from the school but was caught by Harry Potter and Ron Weasley when they came to his office to give him information related to the Chamber, and he revealed his lifestyle of fraudulence.[16]\n\nAt wand point, Harry and Ron forced Lockhart to take them to the bathroom. Once there, Harry asked Myrtle about her death in the hope that she would confirm his hypothesis. She remarked that she heard a boy's voice speaking a strange language and then saw a pair of great yellow eyes which killed. When he further inspected the lavatory, Harry discovered a broken tap with a snake engraved on the handle. He spoke to the engraving in Parseltongue, and the entrance to the Chamber opened. The entrance was a pipe large enough for a man to crawl through behind the sink. Ready to take the plunge, Harry and Ron forced Lockhart into the opening and followed.[16]\n\nThere, Lockhart seized Ron's broken wand and attempted to perform a Memory Charm on Harry and Ron, planning on taking a piece of basilisk skin back up to the surface and tell everyone that he was too late to save Ginny and that the two \"tragically\" lost their minds after seeing her mangled body. The wand backfired and the charm hit Lockhart instead, blasting him against the rocks and causing him to lose all of his memories, giving him complete amnesia.[16] Lockhart was eventually rescued from the chamber with Dumbledore's pet Phoenix Fawkes, along with Ginny, Harry and Ron after Harry slayed the Basilisk, with him proclaiming that the whole situation was \"just like magic\".[31]\n\nAn amnesiac Lockhart then arrived in Minerva McGonagall's office with Ron, Harry and Ginny, where a returned Dumbledore was present, who then derided the clueless Lockhart of his recent memory loss, having achieved his mission of exposing his fraudulence, before sending Ron to take him to the Hospital Wing. His departure from school was met with the joy and celebration of many students and teachers, as he had ceased to be universally popular at Hogwarts.[32] He then became a permanent resident of St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, in the Janus Thickey Ward, for permanent spell damage.[14]\n\nBlissfully ignorant of his own fraudulence, or of anything else, for that matter, Lockhart's many crimes were never actually revealed to the public, presumably because his former employer, Professor Dumbledore, felt that Lockhart had already got what he deserved and decided against making his fate any worse by exposing him to the wizarding world and see him treated with contempt for the rest of his life for wrongdoings he had no idea he had even committed. This is evident by how not even the Healers at St Mungo's had been informed about the details around his admittance, as Miriam Strout, one of the employees at the long-time ward he was admitted to, spoke casually about how Gilderoy had been \"quite well-known a few years ago\" and were optimistic to the prospect of Gilderoy's signs of improvement later in his treatment.[14] Due to this, the ex-professor was allowed to continue his career as an author, after a fashion, getting someone to help him write the book Who Am I?.[17] Based on Miriam's statement, it appears that the wizarding world in general came to forget about Lockhart.\n\nOn Christmas 1995, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Ginny Weasley saw Lockhart at St Mungo's in the Janus Thickey Ward. He had regained his memory to the extent that he could write in cursive (\"with joined-up letters\"), and still enjoyed signing autographs. Ron felt somewhat guilty since his malfunctioning wand was responsible for damaging Lockhart's memories, but Harry felt less sympathetic, for it was Lockhart's attempt to remove their memories in the first place that resulted in this backfire. Overall, Harry observed Lockhart had not changed much and voiced this opinion, making Ginny giggle.[14]\n\nIt is known that Gilderoy never got visitors, suggesting that his family was either deceased or did not care for him. However, Lockhart still received fan mail including weekly letters from Gladys Gudgeon (further evidence that the foundation of falsehood on which he had built his career as an author never became common knowledge), though he had no idea why. He also kept his peacock-feather quill, though it had become somewhat battered by that time so that he could keep signing autographs.[14] Though he retained some memories, Lockhart never fully recovered. Fortunately, however, he was known to be happier that way.[33][3]\n\nDespite the fact that adversaries that carried his likeness were on the attack and caused them quite a bit of trouble at the height of The Calamity in the early 2020s,[34] when an agent of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force encountered the real Lockhart while treating a minor combat injury at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries in London around the same time, the addled state of his mind drew their sympathy nonetheless.[35]\n\nGilderoy Lockhart was a foppish, handsome wizard with wavy blond hair, bright blue eyes, and particularly straight and shiny teeth.[7] He was known for wearing flamboyant, flashy and incredibly extravagant robes in a wide assortment of colours.[11][5]\n\nHowever, during his moments of cowardice, Lockhart's handsomeness was lost, as he looked weak-chinned and foolish in the midst of his ineptitude.[16]\n\nGilderoy Lockhart's defining characteristics were his extreme arrogance, exceeding vanity, conceit, egomania, narcissism, impudence, insensitivity, inconsideration, and self-obsession.[11][5][16] He was a voracious self-promoter and claimed to have done many great deeds, though in actuality he was just a fraud who merely stole the credit for other wizards and witches' accomplishments and whose claims about himself were for the most part nothing but conceit, self-praise, and vanity and whose claims about other things were idle speculations, gross exaggerations, and pure sensationalism;[16] he went as far as to claim his winning of the Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile Award five times in a row was more impressive than Harry Potter surviving an attack by Lord Voldemort himself.[5]\n\nHe also made outrageous claims and suggestions, whether about other people's professions or in times of danger, in order to make himself look more important and powerful than he truly was. Like Stan Shunpike, Gilderoy tends to come up with fabricated concepts on the spot rather frequently just to impress his admirers. Even as a student, he already made far-fetched claims of his goals such as creating a Philosopher's Stone before graduation, intending to captain England's Quidditch team to World Cup glory, before knuckling down to becoming Britain’s youngest Minister for Magic, none of which he actually accomplished. His attempts to earn himself more fame also led him to attempt spells without fully understanding them (such as removing Harry's bones instead of mending them, and launching a snake into the air instead of making it vanish).[29]\n\nIt is also possible that he invented some incantations and names for spells that did not actually exist, such as Peskipiksi Pesternomi (a proven nonsense incantation),[5] and possibly the Transmogrifian Torture,[36] along with the Homorphus Charm.[27] Indeed, many of his books contained a large number of invented details to promote his supposed feats.[3] Lockhart was very proud of his books, since his falsely-acquired achievements recorded within were highly popular with its readers, and would always make reference to them whenever giving advice based on his so-called experience.\n\nIn addition to his self-promoting nature, he was also highly impractical, to the point of being reckless, in many situations. When the Chamber of Secrets opened, he made many pointless suggestions and false volunteers despite the seriousness of the situation, and his \"morale booster\" was more disturbing in both feelings and classes than building up confidence.[30] His school lectures and materials were simply selling his overly expensive autobiographies while reading out chapters from these uninformative books and even theatrically reenacting them, thus lacking any educational purposes.[27] He insisted on mass-producing his own shampoo despite the ingredients being too dangerous and expensive to procure, especially for something as superficial as hair-care.[15]\n\nWith a little flattering, Hermione Granger was able to get Lockhart to sign a permission form for a book within the library's Restricted Section, to which Lockhart did not even bother to look at the book she wanted, much less question her for reasons for wanting a potentially dangerous document, which other teachers would not be so reckless.[27] Later, being the only teacher to not take the reopening of the Chamber of Secrets seriously, he neglected his duties of leading his students to their next class when Harry and Ron flattered him, as Ron pointed out, in order to fix his hair. Even in his time as a student, his antics of garnering attention caused huge amounts of trouble that earned him scorn and loathing instead of the popularity and the praise that he desired.[3]\n\nLockhart's overbearing self-centred personality and insensitivity irked most of the people he encountered who were not included among his fans. His unprofessional behaviour earned him the dislike of the Hogwarts faculty, as well as many of the students. However, his arrogance did have limits and he recognised that Albus Dumbledore, his employer and Headmaster of Hogwarts, was a greater wizard than he was, as he never considered himself to be a better wizard than Dumbledore. Also, like many magical folk (human and nonhuman alike) Lockhart feared Voldemort to the point where he could not call him by his name. Lockhart was overall considered a joke by many people at Hogwarts, and when he left the school due to memory loss, the majority (if not the entirety) of the school was happy to see him go.[32]\n\nHe also seemed to be completely oblivious to the reactions he elicited from other people or misinterpreted them completely. When Ron looked revolted at his ostentatious peacock quill, Lockhart thought that Ron was admiring it. He ignored Harry's many attempts to contradict his theories of enjoying his company and attention, as well as Harry's pleas for Lockhart to leave his broken arm alone, and also completely failed to notice the looks of hatred he received from the rest of the faculty for his ignorance.\n\nHe asserted that Hogwarts was safe from the monster of Slytherin after Hagrid was arrested, claiming extra security was no longer necessary, and though proven wrong almost immediately, Lockhart stubbornly refused to retract his earlier claims, and continued to complain about how the extra security was tiring him out. His ignorance, arrogance, and self-serving nature ultimately led to his downfall when he attempted to use Ron's damaged wand to perform the complex Memory Charm despite seeing the backfires it has caused over the year (mainly in the Duelling Club), evidently forgetting the dangers of attempting such a feat (or that the wand was even damaged).[16]\n\nWhen he was faced with true danger, Gilderoy showed his true nature of a self-serving coward. He attempted to flee from Hogwarts when the other teachers pressured him into entering the Chamber of Secrets after Ginny Weasley's abduction (though this was more to get him out of the way so the teachers could get the real work done), and claim that his books can be misleading, contradicting his past vain support on them. Even after the location of the Chamber's entrance was discovered, he was willing to leave Ginny to die, attempting to modify Harry and Ron's memories to cover himself.[16]\n\nAlthough Lockhart started out as a clever and very skilled student, being Sorted into Ravenclaw house, his main flaw was that he would never try in his studies (or anything) unless he was the very best at it, having been spoiled by his mother's overly affection and his own ego. Even in his childhood, he already expected the students and teachers to greet him with admiration and excitement, as he deluded himself into thinking he is a genius above all others of undeserved rights, and was very disappointed and dulled when he was not given any special treatments. He studied not for education, but for attention and awards, and spent much of his time with annoying vanity projects for fame and glory that instead earned him a small notoriety.[3] He was never an unskilled or untalented wizard, just a lazy one who increasingly directed his talents to insincere shortcuts and cowardly dodges; his gifts wasted away, as the only spell he focused on was the Memory Charm. His abilities eventually deteriorated nearly beyond the point of recovery, which went past that point when he was struck with his own backfiring Memory Charm.\n\nDespite his ineptitude in most other areas of magic due to long-term neglect and misuse, Lockhart was skilled in Memory Charms, it being the one spell he focused on for his entire life, and was conniving enough to deceive other wizards and witches to thoroughly reveal their work to him before erasing their memories and claim the credits for himself. He also appeared to have been a skilled writer, publishing many books consisting primarily of his embellishments of other people's achievements, taking credit for them as his own. Given his propensity for lying, however, it cannot be said for certain that Lockhart himself actually wrote any of the books, though he did understand that the readers would not be nearly half as interested in his books if they realised his feats were no more than fictionalised plagiarism. He also added many invented details in such feats to promote himself further, distorting facts with fictional concepts.[3] Lockhart's fraudulent lifestyle has proven a certain degree of cunning, resourcefulness and disregard for rules, qualities that fall under the specifics of Slytherin, which he was narrowly able to avoid being Sorted into.\n\nIn addition to his other flaws, Lockhart may have had a spiteful streak in him. After learning from Hagrid that the Gamekeeper hadn't read any of his books and that Harry Potter was more famous than Lockhart without trying, Lockhart was put out and later insisted that Harry serve detention with him so he could show off his fan mail to Harry and gloat about it. After Hagrid's arrest, Lockhart openly claimed to be certain that Hagrid was truly guilty,[16] but whether this was a real hint of ill will or another sign of Lockhart's ignorance is unknown.\n\nBy his own claims (written in his many published works), his favourite colour was lilac, his secret ambitions were to rid the world of evil and to market his own range of hair care potions, and that he desired harmony between magic and non-magic peoples as a birthday present.[5] Given his egotistical and self-serving cowardice attributes, some of these may have been fabrications to boost Lockhart's own reputation as opposed to truth. Given his empty ambitiousness shown since his studentship, such as claiming to create a Philosopher's Stone before graduation, captain the England Quidditch team into championship before becoming the youngest Minister for Magic yet accomplishing none of these things, it is very likely his \"secret ambition\" and \"ideal birthday present\" were just the same meaningless claims to gain attention.\n\nAfter losing his memory, however, Lockhart became a much more humble and happier person, even if he did not particularly know it. Upon seeing Harry and Ginny after the spell hit him, he greeted them cheerfully and spent most of the time humming to himself absentmindedly. When addressed as Professor, he expressed surprise at the idea and remarked that he must have been hopeless, without any reluctance at all. Despite forgetting his desire for fame and attention, he continued to enjoy signing autographs and responding to fan letters, a trait that Harry noted had not changed.[14] However, by the time of the publication of his last book Who Am I?, Lockhart appeared to have gone insane due to not having any memories.\n\nLockhart was an accomplished author, with twelve of his books shown. Although nine of them were supposed to be about eradicating dark forces, they were in fact just recollections of his experiences (of which he stole from other people) and his personal profiles, somewhat an extension of his autobiography, and contained a good deal of invented details as opposed to pure facts.[3][16] All of these (with the exception of Who Am I?) were published at some point between 1982 and 1992, before his stint as a Hogwarts professor. Due to the immense popularity, the books were very expensive; he gifted an entire set to Harry Potter as a publicity stunt at Flourish and Blotts, which Harry donated to Ginny Weasley.[11]\n\nLockhart assigned seven of these books to be his textbooks for his Defence Against the Dark Arts course, though it was simply an excuse for him to sell his works to the students,[11] as none of them had any educational usefulness. He gave an overly long \"little quiz\" during the first lesson to test out how much his students took in from his collected works, but most showed little interest and did poorly.[5] After the first lesson ended up in disaster, Lockhart simply read from these books aloud and sometimes reenacted the contents to the class in a theatrical manner.[27]\n\nGilderoy was born in the Lockhart family, with a Muggle father, witch mother, and two elder sisters, both of whom were Squibs. His mother loved him more than she did her two daughters, which, when combined with Gilderoy's revealed wizardry and acceptance into Hogwarts, lead his vanity to grow like a weed. Both mother and son were too excited to remember that Hogwarts accepts all magical students from Britain and Ireland, and she was as deluded as her son in thinking that he was special amongst all children of his age. Due to Mrs Lockhart's overly love and pampering, she completely spoiled and deluded her son, which would lead to a very negative impact on his future.[3]\n\nWhen Gilderoy was admitted to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries due to self-inflicted amnesia, none of his family members nor relatives visited him. This implies that they too despised him and had no desire to spend time with him, or that they were unaware of his unfortunate predicament, or had simply cut all contacts with him before. Even his mother, who overly doted on him, did not visit, suggesting that she was either deceased or came to hate him for his vain and annoying antics.[14]\n\nMost of Lockhart's fans were composed of middle-aged housewives, such as Molly Weasley,[10][11] and young schoolgirls, such as Hermione Granger and Susan Bones.[5] They were charmed by his looks and impressive claims but neglected to notice other dimensions of his personality, like his narcissism and general incompetence. Lockhart's notable fans, such as Gladys Gudgeon and Veronica Smethley, regularly wrote him adoring fan mail.[25] Once Lockhart suffered permanent amnesia and disappeared from the public eye, the majority of his fans most likely lost interest in him, though some of them continued to send him letters at the hospital.[14]\n\nDuring his time as a Hogwarts student, Lockhart was already unpopular with the school's residents, students like The Marauders and Severus Snape and the staff alike, almost immediately due to him being a spoiled child with a brat's sense of entitlement, self-delusions, and obnoxious personality. He was expecting everyone to whisper and stare about him and found it dull and disappointing when they did not, especially when they were not particularly impressed by his naturally wavy hair, of which he was very proud. His attempts to gain himself more attention did him little good; instead they made him more of an annoying troublemaker when he begged Headmaster Albus Dumbledore to start a school newspaper solely for his own name to appear in its print, carved his name into the Quidditch pitch (earning him a weeks' worth of detentions), shooting a hologram of his own face into the sky like the Dark Mark, and sending himself eight-hundred Valentines, causing breakfast to be cancelled due to the number of droppings and feathers in the porridge. His squandering of his own talents and refusal to take his studies seriously also earned him the scorn of his teachers, when they once hoped that if he had worked hard, he might have made something positive of his gifts. Lockhart's graduation was met with a faint sigh of relief from the entire staff. It was easily apparent that all of them would not hesitate to and perhaps even looked for opportunities to punish Lockhart out of sheer annoyance of his troublemaking and attention seeking personality, with the only Professor who didn't resent Lockhart and was willing to tolerate his antics appeared to be Dumbledore, as he apparently saw Lockhart's antics as amusing rather than irritating, evidenced by the fact that Lockhart's pleads for Dumbledore to start a school newspaper was the only time where Lockhart managed to get away unpunished. When word of his supposed accomplishments of Defence Against the Dark Arts have reached his former educators' and, in Snape's case, peers ears, they began to think that they had misjudged him due to his seeming resilience and bravery, unaware he was a mere charlatan who stole the credit of accomplishments made by true heroes. This misunderstanding, however, did not change their opinion on his annoying, attention-seeking personality, and they would later see him as the incompetent fraud he was.[3]\n\nWhen Lockhart had erased the memories of two wizards Dumbledore knew personally, Dumbledore, having never been fooled by Lockhart's tall tales and always being suspicious of how Lockhart came to fame due to knowing just what kind of a person Lockhart was, easily deduced the truth behind Lockhart's fame and saw through his charade and decided to track him down and make him pay for his crimes. Dumbledore offered Lockhart a position as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, under the correct belief that school is the best location to expose the fraud for what he was. Lockhart was reluctant at first, as he was more interested in his successful career as an author, but was instantly swayed when Dumbledore mentioned Harry Potter's fame, which Lockhart would believe as a boost to his own.[3] The other professors, who remembered Lockhart as obnoxious, were baffled at Dumbledore's choice to invite Lockhart back to Hogwarts, and Minerva even asked what possible benefits could students gain from such a vain man;[3] according to Hagrid, the main reason for Lockhart's appointment was that he was the only applicant for the jinxed position after what happened to Quirrell, something the other teachers agree on, but still thought Lockhart's personality outweighed the desperate need for a new teacher. Dumbledore appeared to be the only one who Lockhart didn't express superiority to and possibly held some level of respect for his old headmaster.\n\nDuring his tenure in the 1992–1993 school year, Lockhart made an utter mess out of the subject due to his incompetence and ignorance. He also annoyed most of the teachers (some of whom remembered during his time as a student)[3] by making unsolicited advice to look as though he was superior to them in every one of their fields while constantly proving otherwise with his consistently terrible performances. As such, his coworkers found him extremely obnoxious and could not take him seriously as a professor. Lockhart's insensitive nature embarrassed Snape and Flitwick on Valentine's Day, when he made comments about Love Potions and Entrancing Enchantments regarding them, respectively, while disgusting everyone else by just overdecorating the Great Hall, and releasing dwarfs throughout the school to deliver Valentines, interrupting classes in progress.[30] By the end of the year, the other teachers were pleased to see him leave, going as far as to join in the students' applause of the announcement.[32]\n\nEven Rubeus Hagrid, who normally would never have criticised a teacher, publicly expressed disdain for Lockhart and did not believe any of Lockhart's fabricated claims, saying that he would eat his kettle if one word of it were true.[25] Lockhart, on the other hand, did not seem to notice the resentment that the teachers had for him, and instead kept on annoying everyone. When Hagrid was sent to Azkaban based on Cornelius Fudge's misguided beliefs, Lockhart adamantly believed Hagrid to be guilty of opening the Chamber of Secrets, despite future events and the continuous tension of the atmosphere proved otherwise.[28] This might have been the result of Hagrid claiming that he never read Lockhart's books and that Harry would not be giving out signed photographs due to being more famous than him without trying, both of which made Lockhart disappointed.\n\nGilderoy was particularly disliked by Professor Snape for not only taking the teaching post he coveted so much but also for his constant and presumptuous attempts to advise Snape with largely nonsensical suggestions. In fact, Lockhart was probably on top of the list of the DADA professor that Snape resented the most, with the only possible exception being Remus Lupin, who even then still got along better with Snape than Lockhart despite Snape's resentment. Snape looked as though he was prepared to kill Lockhart during the Duelling Club, as Harry described, and something even Lockhart eventually saw when he looked at Snape's expression.[29] He was the most miserable of the teachers of Hogwarts when Lockhart held a Valentine Day celebration, to the point Harry described Snape at this point as \"looking as if he had been forced to drink multiple Skele-Gro\" and when Lockhart encouraged the students to ask Snape to teach them how to brew Love Potion, Snape looked as if he would force-feed poison to anyone who dared to ask him.[30] When Ginny Weasley was taken into the Chamber of Secrets, Snape immediately sent Lockhart to deal with the monster within. The other teachers agreed unanimously, in the hopes of scaring Lockhart away, especially considering he had walked in obliviously while the other teachers were devastated by Ginny's impending doom; it was during this situation that they were all glaring at him with genuine hatred, something that he remained oblivious to. In revenge, they took Lockhart's earlier claims and used it against him, while ignoring his attempt to stammer his way out with feeble excuses.[16]\n\nWhile he was unpopular during his time as a student,[3] Lockhart, as a teacher, had a mixed relationship with the students of Hogwarts: about half of them admired him for his celebrity status, while the other half resented him for being obnoxious and fake. However, by the end of the year, when Lockhart revealed his own fraudulence and left school due to his accidental self-induced amnesia, pretty much every student gave their round of applause at the news.[32]\n\nThe half of the students who initially admired him were mostly girls like Hermione Granger and Susan Bones, who fell for his good looks, and Muggle-born students who actually believed in the accomplishments in his books, such as Justin Finch-Fletchley and Colin Creevey.[5] They remained ignorant of Lockhart's true colours, even when he revealed them little by little throughout his terrible performances. However, when he was finally exposed as a fraud, the boys most likely abandoned their faith in him.\n\nMuch like most of the faculty, the other half of the students simply found Lockhart to be annoying. Many of them showed little knowledge or interest in his history or published works, as they all did rather poorly on his \"little\" quiz that purely consisted of questions about him.[5] Him not teaching them anything useful had caused a rift for their education experience. Even those who showed no outright sympathy either for or against Lockhart, such as the Slytherins, appeared to have no respect for and could easily enjoy and mock him behind his back, as Draco Malfoy mocked Harry for being dragged into the spotlight by the professor,[11] and along with the other Slytherins cheered when Snape effortlessly grounded Lockhart at the Duelling Club with the Disarming Charm.[29]\n\nIt appears that the only one in the Staff and virtually all of Hogwarts who had any amount of pity and compassion for Lockhart and his current state was Dumbledore himself. While he had purposefully intended for Lockhart to be exposed as a fraud to the Wizarding World and evidently disapproved of Lockhart's attention-seeking, Dumbledore notably chose not to expose Lockhart's crimes to the public. Despite Lockhart's fraudulent nature, Dumbledore likely thought that the loss of his memory was punishment enough. Since Lockhart would not remember either the so called accomplishments or his fraudulent behaviour, it would be cruel to expose him to a likely sentence in Azkaban. It is also notable that unlike all the other professors, Dumbledore was always civil and cordial to Lockhart despite knowing of his crimes, further implying while Dumbledore decided to expose Lockhart, he bore no personal animosity to him and only did so to protect more heroes from being denied their rights to be acknowledged for their deeds. Lockhart himself clearly admired and respected Dumbledore, as he never claimed to surpass Dumbledore and was always polite to him and he never annoyed him directly or indirectly, which is a sharp contrast compared to his interactions with the other teachers, indicating that despite his vanity, Lockhart's acknowledgement of how great Dumbledore was also came with the acknowledgement that Dumbledore obviously surpassed him, a fact that was very much true. This, however, did not stop Lockhart from making his unhelpful suggestions and false declarations even within Dumbledore's earshot. It appears that before he lost his memories that Dumbledore was the only staff member that Lockhart ever had any respect for.[3]\n\nHarry Potter particularly disliked Lockhart for dragging him into the spotlight against his will, beginning with the book-signing during which Lockhart made a spectacle out of Harry as a publicity stunt,[11] and for making Harry seem as though he was constantly seeking attention only to finally get told by Hagrid that Harry was more famous than him without trying; the only reason Lockhart returned to Hogwarts to teach was under the presumption that getting close to Harry would boost his own popularity. Lockhart only further infuriated Harry by doing far more damage than help when he vanished Harry's arm bones instead of mending them when they were broken by Dobby's tampered Bludger, requiring him to use Skele-Gro.[27] Their first lesson was enough to make Harry realise that Lockhart was an incompetent fool who had no idea what he was doing,[5] and would spend much of the school year avoiding Lockhart to the best of his power, and practically begged Professor McGonagall to allow him an alternate detention when he was assigned to help Lockhart answer his fan-mails, which Lockhart thought was a treat, when Harry thought otherwise.[25] Lockhart would often drag Harry to the front of the class to reenact some of the more dramatic portions within the textbooks' contents in a theatrical manner as part of the \"lecture\", something Harry would have refused if he did not have a very good reason then.[27] Lockhart even offered Harry some private Quidditch lessons, to which Harry refused. Harry would further dislike Lockhart for insisting that Rubeus Hagrid was guilty of opening the Chamber of Secrets, simply based on the Minister's incorrect move of arresting Hagrid as a preventive measure, and barely resisted the urge to throw a book into his face.[16]\n\nBecause of his growing hatred for Lockhart, Harry would use Lockhart's ignorance against him with pleasure, by requesting him to sign a permission slip for a library book in the Restricted Section that no other teachers would so easily do,[27] and then have Lockhart return to class prematurely so Harry and Ron can sneak off from all security measures set. When Snape easily sent Lockhart flying backwards at the Duelling Club, Harry didn't feel any sympathy for him despite the fact that it was Snape who did it. Upon Lockhart inadvertently revealing his fraudulence in his refusal to enter the Chamber of Secrets, Harry's dislike and fury intensified, and swiftly disarmed Lockhart with such force that he sent the man falling back on his trunk. Neither Harry nor Ron had any qualms about attacking Lockhart and forcing him to enter the Chamber, and they even made him go first as a buffer for any approaching harm.[16] Harry's sympathy was extremely limited when Lockhart lost his memories after his Memory Charm backfired, as it was entirely his fault for attempting it on Harry and Ron in the first place in addition to his intent to flee and leave Ginny for dead.[14]\n\nRon Weasley, who was already annoyed the book-signing at Flourish and Blotts made it look as though his family was unimportant,[11] saw Lockhart for what he really was during their first lesson, when the professor gave a test completely irrelevant to the subject, and then released a boisterous group of pixies he was unable to contain.[5] When Snape easily sent Lockhart flying backwards at the Duelling Club, Ron didn't felt any sympathy towards him despite the fact that it was Snape who did it. Ron's disgust deepened over the year, when Lockhart's continuous ineptitude annoyed him repeatedly, going as far as wanting to drop out of Lockhart's class because of it,[28] feeling very revolted (alongside the rest of the staff) with Lockhart's over-decorative \"morale booster\" on Valentine's day,[30] sickened by Lockhart's overly lavish peacock quill (something Lockhart completely misinterpreted as admiration), and reached a critical level when Lockhart attempted to flee while allowing Ron's sister to die in the Chamber of Secrets; when they finally discovered where the fabled Chamber was, and that Lockhart inadvertently admitted himself as a fraud, Ron demanded that Lockhart go first into the Chamber as a test subject.[16] However, three years later, upon meeting Lockhart in the St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Ron showed some guilt for Lockhart losing his memories due to his Memory Charm backfiring from using Ron's damaged wand.[14] However, Ron's sympathy towards Lockhart was extremely limited considering Lockhart attempted to wipe out his memory along with Harry's and nearly cost his younger sister, Ginny's life.\n\nUnlike Ron and Harry, Hermione Granger was a big fan of Lockhart, showing excitement at the prospect at meeting him at Flourish and Blotts, saying that he has written almost the entire book list.[11] When Lockhart taught at Hogwarts, Hermione, unlike Harry and Ron, completely dismissed his mistakes, when normally she would become annoyed whenever anyone cast a single spell wrong, such as after Lockhart's first lesson, she insisted that Lockhart just wanted to give them some hands-on experience by bringing pixies to the class, and refused to see that he did not know what he was doing.[5] She also dismissed his blunders as the usual honest mistakes, such as when he de-boned Harry Potter's arm,[27] and talking about \"all the amazing things he's done.\"[5]\n\nRon Weasley also noticed that she had outlined Lockhart's lessons on her timetable with hearts. It was presumed she was shocked when Lockhart was exposed as a fraud. It was possible, however, that she simply fell for his good looks, as she was described to be breathless when she saw him at St Mungo's, despite Lockhart's true nature already having been revealed.[14] Hermione claimed that she admired \"the amazing things he had done\",[5] but she had showed signs that she only admired his good looks, no matter what she said to the contrary. Also, when she claimed that she didn't like someone just because they're handsome in their fourth year, Ron coughed the word \"Lockhart\".[43]\n\nWhen Gilderoy was admitted into St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries due to his self-inflicted amnesia, the Healer in charge of his ward, Miriam Strout, took great care of him. She was very motherly to him, catering to his condition with an affectionate tone, leading him back into his room when he slipped out while speaking kindly to him as though he was a child out of place. She also took pity on him for the fact that nobody visited him, not even any of his family members.[14]\n\nGilderoy was a name that J. K. Rowling found in Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. According to the dictionary, the name belongs to two different highway men who were both described as incredibly handsome.[44]\n\nGilderoy is an Irish and Scottish name that refers back to Gilroy, which means \"son of the red-haired servant\", or \"son of the king's servant.\"\n\nInterestingly, \"Gilderoy\" is similar to the term \"gilded\", which means both to cover something in a thin layer of gold to appear valuable and golden (when in reality it isn't), and \"wealthy and privileged\", both of which apply well to Gilderoy's character.\n\nJ. K. Rowling found the name Lockhart on a war memorial[44] at a church in Edinburgh, and found it to be \"a hollow kind of name\", befitting of the character.[45] Others have noted that 'Lockhart' sounds like 'lock-heart', which is reminiscent of Lockhart's use of memory charms to lock his victims' memories, though that is largely held to be coincidental.\n\nThe word Lockhart is of Scottish origin and is said to mean \"brave\" and \"hardy\", which is ironic compared to his character.",
