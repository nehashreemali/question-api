  "content": "Morsmordre was the incantation of a dark charm used to conjure the image of the Dark Mark, the skull-and-serpent sign used by Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, in the sky.[1] The Death Eaters cast their mark over the homes of anyone they killed as their calling card.[1] It was said to have been created by Lord Voldemort himself.[2]\n\nIn the First Wizarding War, Morsmordre became something of a signature move for the Death Eaters.[1] After a murder, the spell would be cast in order to both claim credit for the attack, and to further terrify the wizarding community.[1]\n\nAfter Voldemort's first defeat, the Mark was no longer seen since the method for casting it was known only to the innermost circle of Death Eaters. If these individuals had escaped death or Azkaban, they had done so by lying about their membership in the organisation, and therefore casting the spell would have been something of a give-away. It was noted that precious few wizards knew how to perform this spell.[1]\n\nBarty Crouch Junior cast the spell after witnessing a number of disloyal Death Eaters engaged in Muggle torture of the Roberts family and rioting after the Quidditch World Cup. His motive in casting this spell was primarily to terrify the former Death Eaters, as opposed to the other spectators.[3] This caused a widespread panic, as seeing the sign after 14 years made people think Voldemort had returned,[1] and Death Eaters feared the possibility of Voldemort's return more than the civilians due to their fear that their disloyalty to the Dark Lord may bring retribution from him.[3]\n\nAt first, the house-elf Winky was blamed for the act due to the fact that both she and the wand used to cast the spell were found together at the location from which the spell was apparently cast. After it was remembered that only a former Death Eater would have had the knowledge to cast the spell, both Winky along with Harry, Ron and Hermione were cleared of any involvement.[1]\n\nVoldemort later used his knowledge of this event to contradict Lucius Malfoy's claim that he was on the alert for any sign of Voldemort's return, and would have immediately rejoined him, upon his return at the Little Hangleton graveyard.[4]\n\nIgor Karkaroff was killed in 1996 by Death Eaters for betraying Lord Voldemort, and the Dark Mark was cast over the shack in which his body was found.[5]\n\nIt was cast over the Astronomy Tower at Hogwarts by Gibbon when the Death Eaters invaded the castle in 1997, in order to lure Albus Dumbledore to the tower so that Draco Malfoy could kill him. In this case, the Mark was cast before, rather than after, a murder.[6] Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter and Madam Rosmerta witnessed the Dark Mark over the school from Hogsmeade, and Rosmerta gave Albus and Harry brooms so they could travel to the castle as quickly as possible.[7]\n\nThe incantation of this spell appears to be derived from the Latin mors, \"death\", and mordere, \"to bite\". This alludes to the name of Voldemort's followers, the Death Eaters.\n\nAnother derivation may come from French mort, \"death\", and mordre, \"to bite\". The English word murder could also contribute. The literal translation of the Norwegian word \"morsmodre\" would be \"mothers killers\".\n\nThe incantation may also come form Italian morso, \"bite\", and morire, \"die\".\n\nIt may also be a reference to the word \"mord\", which means \"murder\" in Icelandic, German, Norwegian, Danish Polish and Swedish, since the spell is cast after someone has been murdered, and sounds like \"mass murder\" and \"mortal\".",
