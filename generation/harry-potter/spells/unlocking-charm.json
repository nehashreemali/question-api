  "content": "The Unlocking Charm (Alohomora),[1] also known as the Unlocking Spell[5] or the Thief's Friend[1] was a charm that unlocked objects such as doors or windows.[1][4][6] It was also able to open doors locked by the Locking Spell (Colloportus), and as such, acted as its counter-charm. The Anti-Alohomora Charm could be used to prevent this charm from working on a locked target.[1]\n\nThe Unlocking Charm had its origins in Africa, whereupon it was called the Thief's Friend. The first known person to have mastered the charm was an Ancient African sorcerer, who taught it to thief Eldon Elsrickle during the latter's trip to the continent in the 17th century. Upon returning to his native Britain, Elsrickle used it to terrorise London, stealing from homes of Muggles and wizards alike, until Blagdon Blay invented the Anti-Alohomora Charm. Before he died, Elsrickle gave knowledge of the Unlocking Charm in exchange for his freedom on the infrequent occasions he broke into a magical household, resulting in the spell being widespread in the country.[1]\n\nBefore the discovery of Alohomora, the most popular unlocking spell was Portaberto, which splintered the lock from a door but occasionally left a smoking hole where the key should have gone. Before Portaberto, however, the most popular opening spell was Open Sesame, which ripped doors from their hinges and tore them into firewood. All of these were more rudimentary and by far less subtle than Alohomora.[1]\n\nDescriptions of this spell were written in numerous books, including the first volume of the Standard Book of Spells series, where it was described in chapter seven.[2] and a spellbook that could be found in the Hogwarts Library.[7] This spell was also taught in Charms class in the first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was one of the first spells students learnt.[8]\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Harry Potter considered using this charm to unlock the cage of his pet owl Hedwig at 4 Privet Drive, but did not, since he knew that underage wizards and witches were not allowed to use magic outside of Hogwarts.[9]\n\nThe door guarding the Philosopher's Stone was protected against the Unlocking Charm; a winged key was necessary to open it.[10] A single door in the Department of Mysteries was impervious to this spell as well; it is possible that it opened in the room where the British Ministry of Magic studied the power of love in the Department of Mysteries.[11]\n\nThere was a spell called the Anti-Alohomora Charm which was used to counteract this spell.[1] Magical locks also existed and were placed on several doors, but could be unlocked with this charm.[7][12][13]\n\nJ. K. Rowling stated that the word was from the West African Sikidy figures used in geomancy and has the literal meaning \"Friendly to thieves\".[38]",
