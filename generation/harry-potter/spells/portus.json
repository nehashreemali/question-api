  "content": "The Portkey Spell[4] (Portus)[1] was a charm[2][3] used to turn an ordinary object into a Portkey.[1] Since creating Portkeys were restricted by the Ministry of Magic, the usage of this spell was, by extension, restricted as well. This was the subject of a question of the Theory of Charms O.W.L. in 1996[3]\n\nImmediately after casting, the target would glow bright blue, as the Portkey did when it was ready, but after a few seconds, it would return to its normal colour.[1] The time when the Portkey would disappear was set by the caster after casting the spell.[5]\n\nPortus comes from the Latin word \"portare\" which means \"to carry\".",
