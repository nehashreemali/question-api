  "content": "The Boggart-Banishing Spell[3] (Riddikulus)[1] was a charm that was used to defeat a Boggart.[1] It caused the creature to assume a form that was humorous to the caster, along with a whip-crack noise, thereby taking away the Boggart's ability to terrorise.[1]\n\nBoggarts were defeated by laughter, so forcing them to assume an amusing form was the first step to defeating them.[1] However, as the Boggart was amortal, the spell merely \"banished\" them, not destroyed.[4]\n\nThis was one of the spells that Professor Albus Dumbledore taught his Defence Against the Dark Arts class in the 1910s. Among those students were Newton Scamander and Leta Lestrange; the aforementioned of which mastered the spell, whilst the latter failed to do so.[5]\n\nAt the start of the 1986–1987 school year, Professor Pomona Sprout used this spell to banish a Boggart that manifested in the Greenhouse after Herbology class.[6] Throughout the school year, Jacob's sibling used this spell on various occasions against Boggarts that had been released due to someone having tampered with the Vault of Fear, including the break-in of the Vault by themselves.[7][8]\n\nIn September 1993, Professor Remus Lupin taught this spell to his third year Defence Against the Dark Arts class in.[1] Thanks to Lupin's teaching, Harry Potter was able to use this against a Boggart in the Triwizard Maze in 1995.[9]\n\nThis spell was apart of the practical examination of the Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L.[10]\n\nDuring the Calamity of the 2010s, members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force often used this charm to combat Boggart Confoundables in order to release Foundables.[11]\n\nA simple charm that required the force of mind, to cast, the spell caster must first acknowledge what they fear the most (as it will most likely be what the Boggart will take the form of) and then visualise it into something amusing.\n\nThe problem was because the Boggart would have assumed said form at the moment of direct encounter, the one attempting to use this charm would usually have lost concentration after seeing the Boggart manifest their worst fears, making this spell useless. As such, it was always advisable to first take one step at a time when practising this spell.[1]\n\n\"Riddikulus\" is an adaptation of the English adjective \"ridiculous\" as well as of the Latin noun ridiculum (\"joke\") and Latin verb ridere (\"to laugh\").",
