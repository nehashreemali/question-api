  "content": "Fiendfyre, or the Fiendfyre Curse (Pestis Incendium),[1] was a deadly curse that produced powerful enchanted flames of immense size and heat that were capable of destroying nearly anything and everything in its path, taking the form of gigantic fiery magical beasts such as serpents, chimaeras, and dragons that sought out living targets. The extremely volatile and sentient cursed fire spread rapidly, and incinerated nearly everything through mere physical contact. Fiendfyre required extreme skill and intense concentration to control.[2]\n\nThis curse was an advanced type of Dark Magic, and it was one of the few known substances capable of destroying Horcruxes.[2] The curse was also similar, but different to the protective dark charm Protego Diabolica.[4]\n\nFiendfyre was an immensely powerful type of enchanted fire, burning at severely high temperatures. It could not be extinguished by normal or conjured water.[2][5] It was also very difficult for the caster to control,[2] flowing from their wand in a continuous stream of flame. If the caster flicked their wand when the stream of flame was still running from it, a jet of fire would shoot off and take the form of a large beast made of flame that almost seemed to have a mind of its own.[3]\n\nWhen cast, the fire appeared with a roaring, billowing noise which gave its victims only a split-second's warning to escape, quickly consuming anything in the vicinity of its caster; it was difficult for the caster to control the movement of the abnormally large flames. The flames could take the form of fiery serpents, dragons, and Chimaeras, constantly mutating into other beasts as well as powerful, formless flames that spread rapidly, and were able to destroy all things around itself at the caster’s wishes. The fire even possessed a sentience of its own, a continuous (though far from latent) desire to burn anything it could.[2] It pursued and incinerated any nearby lifeforms and physical forces through mere physical contact, and was even able to kill its own caster if it had the chance.[3]\n\nFiendfyre required exceptional skill and full concentration in order to control it. There was also a counter-curse to extinguish the flames.[5] Vincent Crabbe never learnt how to control or extinguish the flames, therefore costing him his own life at the hands of the fire he conjured himself.[2] Casters with greater skill and experience had an easier time controlling the flames, and could even direct them to attack their opponents.[6][7] It is unknown if the fire was able to burn off on its own since it could not be extinguished by external forces. It also could not be extinguished with the Water-Making Spell.[2]\n\nFiendfyre was one of the few substances known with the ability to destroy a Horcrux. During a skirmish in the Room of Requirement during the Battle of Hogwarts, Vincent Crabbe's Fiendfyre destroyed Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem, which was the fifth of Voldemort's Horcruxes.[2]\n\nIn Latin, pestis translates to \"plague\" or \"pest\". A plague is defined as \"a contagious disease that spreads rapidly and kills many people\". Incendium means \"fire\". Together, Pestis Incendium can be translated to \"fire plague\", which alludes to the Fiendfyre Curse's ability to spread rapidly and incinerate anything in its path if left uncontrolled and/or unchecked. The wording pest can also be interpreted to allude to the curse's ability to create dangerous, rapid-spreading fiery beasts and animals that incinerated anything upon physical contact. As for the name of the spell, Fiend means \"enemy, demon, devil\", while fyre comes from the Old English word \"fyr\" and means simply fire. Together, it can be referred to as the \"devil's fire\" or \"hellfire.\"",
