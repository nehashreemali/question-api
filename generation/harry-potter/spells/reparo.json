  "content": "The Mending Charm,[1] also known as the Repairing Charm[3][4] (Reparo), was a charm that could be used to seamlessly repair a broken or ripped object and worked on most materials. This incredibly useful and practical charm was invented by Orabella Nuttley, in or before 1754.[3]\n\nThe charm was invented by Orabella Nuttley, an employee of the Improper Use of Magic Office in the British Ministry of Magic, in or before 1754. She used her charm to repair the Colosseum after it had been accidentally destroyed. Thereafter, it became famous; this instance was recorded in Book of Spells, by Miranda Goshawk.[3]\n\nThere were various textbooks containing instructions for this spell, including The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1 (a first-year Charms textbook at Hogwarts),[1] although there was still a spellbook designated entirely to the teaching of this charm.[5]\n\nDuring the 1985–1986 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, this spell was taught to second-year students in Transfiguration by Professor Minerva McGonagall.[6]\n\nThe Mending Charm was effective at repairing most materials. However, damage caused by certain rare, powerful curses such as Fiendfyre were impossible to undo.[3]\n\nThe charm was suitable for use only on inanimate objects. Use on living beings was entirely proscribed. Serious scarring could result if it were cast on a person or animal in an attempt to heal wounds.[3]\n\nWhile a properly cast Mending Charm was generally enough to fix an object, it seemed less experienced casters might not have succeeded in returning liquids to broken containers.[7]\n\nThere were some limits on what the spell could do concerning magical objects - it couldn't repair broken magic. For example, while the charm might fix the physical shell of a broken wand, the magic inside would remain damaged beyond repair, causing the wand in question to fall apart again upon attempted use.[8][9] The sole exception to this rule was the Elder Wand, which was used to successfully repaired Harry's wand, due to the strength and magnitude of the Elder Wand's power.[10]\n\nAdditionally, this charm did not seem to work on objects of powerful and complex magic, such as broken Vanishing Cabinets.[11] Draco Malfoy proved this by having spent almost an entire school year trying to repair the damaged cabinet through a more specific spell, due to the complexity of the magical passage.[11]\n\nThis charm specifically didn't work well on clothing, and was only able to repair small rips and tears. If a piece of clothing was torn to shreds or otherwise heavily damaged, then the Mending Charm wouldn't be able to do much.[12]\n\nTwo similar spells existed: Oculus Reparo, which was used to repair glasses,[40][41][42] and Papyrus Reparo, which could be used to restore torn pieces of paper.[35] Their history and relationship to the original Mending Charm - apart from the etymology and effects - are unknown.\n\nIt is also possible that these incantations were just the Mending Charm with the appropriate spell modifier added.\n\nReparo is a play on reparo (latin for fix, mend, or put back).",
