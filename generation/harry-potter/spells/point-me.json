  "content": "The Four-Point Spell (Point Me) was a charm that caused the caster's wand to behave as if it were a compass and point north.[1]\n\nThis spell was found by Hermione Granger for use by Harry Potter (whether she invented it or merely found it through research is unclear). Harry used this spell on a number of occasions, however mostly during the third task of the Triwizard Tournament, which involved finding his way through a dangerous hedge maze, without getting lost on his way.[1]",
