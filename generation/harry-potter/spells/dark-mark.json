  "content": "The Dark Mark was the symbol of Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. It refers both to a magically induced brand that every Death Eater bore on his or her inner left forearm, and to the same symbol summoned in the sky by the spell Morsmordre.[1]\n\nThe Dark Mark appeared as a glittering green skull with a snake protruding from its mouth.[1] This might have been inspired by the hiding place of the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets. When summoned, the basilisk would emerge from the mouth of the statue of Salazar Slytherin. The serpent was also the symbol of Slytherin house, and thus appropriate to be used by the Heir of Slytherin.[2]\n\nThe symbol might also have been related to Lord Voldemort being a Parselmouth, a gift he thought made him unlike the rest of the wizarding world. The Dark Mark on the forearm was black, while the Dark Mark conjured by Morsmordre was green; this was most likely for more contrast with each respective background as a black Dark Mark would be hard to see in the night sky. It was also said that the Dark Mark represented immortality and power.[1]\n\nThe Dark Mark in the sky and on the Death Eaters' arms were different in appearance. The one in the sky was plainly a skull with a snake coming out straight out of its mouth,[1] while the brand on a Death Eater's arm was much more intricate and detailed, the snake being much longer and winding.\n\nAn inactive Dark Mark appeared as a faint mark on the inner part of the left forearm, similar to that of \"a vivid red tattoo\"; an active one was jet black.[3]\n\nLord Voldemort placed the Dark Mark on his followers' inner left forearms both as a sign of their loyalty to him and as a method of summoning them to him when he or she desired.[1] This was done by pressing his or her finger to any Death Eater's Mark, which turned it jet black and delivered a burning sensation to any person with the Dark Mark, including traitors such as Igor Karkaroff.[4][5] Feeling the burn, the Death Eaters then could Apparate to Voldemort's side, but they were not forcibly compelled to do so.[3] It is unknown whether all Death Eaters would always feel the burning, or if Voldemort could choose to signal a specific person or people.\n\nThe deepness of the Mark's colour was connected to Voldemort's physical health. When Voldemort suffered his first defeat, the Marks on the Death Eaters faded, but as he began regaining his strength, the faded marks became clearer and burnt slightly, a sign of Voldemort's return to his Death Eaters; the burn may be sudden and stings rather sharply, as Snape suddenly gripped where his mark was during the night Harry Potter was solving the Golden egg riddle.[6] Death Eaters could also use it to signal Voldemort by pressing on their Dark Marks. Bearing this mark also allows the Death Eaters to bypass a Cursed barrier.[7] During the height of the Second Wizarding War, they were under orders to only signal Voldemort if they had successfully captured Harry Potter, or else they would face severe penalties by him.[8] After Voldemort was defeated for the final time, the Dark Marks faded to a scar, similar to Harry's lightning-bolt scar. They would no longer activate nor burn, but would still remain nevertheless; there was no possible way of removing the Dark Mark.\n\nOnly Voldemort's inner circle, namely the Death Eaters, were branded with the Dark Mark, which was considered a great honour among his followers. Thus, people like the Snatchers never received one.[9]\n\nHermione Granger used the Protean Charm to create special coins for Dumbledore's Army, which would heat up when signalling a meeting, and she claimed that she indeed got the idea from the Dark Mark.[10]\n\nPeter Pettigrew, despite being a low-ranking Death Eater for his cowardice and disloyalty, was branded with a Dark Mark.[3] However, he was not given the same respect as the other Death Eaters would have received, and was instead treated as a lowly household servant by both his master and his colleagues.[11][12][13][9] Voldemort used this particular Dark Mark brand shortly after his rebirth to summon his other Death Eaters in the Little Hangleton graveyard.[3]\n\nAs a signature of their work, the Death Eaters could also use a spell to create an image of the Dark Mark in the sky. The incantation of this spell was Morsmordre. The appearance of the Mark in the sky was similar to the Mark on the forearm, but green.[1]\n\nNotable uses included in the woods during the 1994 Quidditch World Cup Final, when it was cast by Barty Crouch Jnr, and over the Astronomy Tower of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry by Gibbon in 1997. It normally appeared where there had been a murder by the hands of Death Eaters or Lord Voldemort. Due to the terror Voldemort and his Death Eaters had brought to the world in the First Wizarding War, the Dark Mark being cast over a location brought deep fear to the community, even after Voldemort's first downfall.[1]\n\nDuring his studentship at Hogwarts, Gilderoy Lockhart shot a holographic image of his own face like the Dark Mark into the air, in an attempt to garner attention.[14]\n\nFred and George Weasley created Edible Dark Marks for their joke shop, Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.[15] When Harry mentioned that the Dumbledore's Army coin reminded him of the Death Eaters' brands, he incorrectly referred to the brand as a scar.[16]\n\nVoldemort summoning his Death Eaters by touching their Dark Marks and vice versa seemed to be the same, or at least a similar, magic to Aurelius Dumbledore summoning Gellert Grindelwald by touching the Deathly Hallows necklace Grindelwald gave him.[17]",
