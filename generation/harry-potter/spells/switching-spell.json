  "content": "The Switching Spell (incantation unknown) was a transfiguration spell[1][3] used to switch the positions of two objects.[4] By definition, it was a simultaneous transfiguration of two objects to make them look like each other.[5][6][7][8]\n\nThe spell was studied in transfiguration class by fifth-years[5][6][7][8] and fourth-years[3][9] respectively during the 1988–1989 and 1994–1995 school years. Hermione Granger, however, gained points for knowing about Switching Spells in her first year.[1]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year, fifth-year students, including Jacob's sibling, were taught the Switching Spell in Transfiguration class, with individual lessons on piggy banks with guinea pigs,[5] top hats with rabbits,[6] pillows with armadillos[7] and tortoises with hares.[8]\n\nNeville Longbottom proved unable to perform a Switching Spell by October 1994, a fact that was criticised by Minerva McGonagall, who called the spell \"simple\".[3] In preparation for the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, Hermione Granger idly suggested to Harry Potter that he might use this spell on a dragon to turn its fangs to wine-gums, but rejected the idea as impractical because as a rule it was nearly impossible to cast a spell through a dragon's hide.[4]\n\nIn 1996, Harry Potter forgot the definition of a Switching Spell when doing his written Transfiguration Ordinary Wizarding Level exam.[10]",
