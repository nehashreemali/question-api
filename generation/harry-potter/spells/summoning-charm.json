  "content": "The Summoning Charm (Accio) was a charm that summoned an object toward the caster.[2] It was able to summon objects in direct line of sight of the caster, as well as things out of view, by calling the object aloud after the incantation[2] (unless the spell was cast nonverbally).\n\nThis spell needed thought behind it, and the caster had to clearly visualise the object in their mind before trying to summon it.[2] Any distraction would make the spell ineffective.[3] The opposite charm of the Summoning Charm was the Banishing Charm.[4]\n\nThe Summoning Charm was one of the oldest known to wizarding society.[5] This spell's most famous use was, according to Miranda Goshawk, by the Accionites and their leader, Gideon Flatworthy.[5]\n\nIn the traditional wizarding tale \"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\" from The Tales of Beedle the Bard, the son of the titular pot's original owner summoned a lost donkey belonging to one of his fellow villagers.[6]\n\nThis charm was taught to fourth-years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Charms class[7][8] and was revised again in a student's fifth in preparation for O.W.L.s.[9] In the 1890–1891 school year, Professor Abraham Ronen had his fifth-years review the charm before they used it in a game of Summoner's Court.[10] This spell was located in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4 by Miranda Goshawk.[11]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the late 2010s and early 2020s, a Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force used a combination of this spell and the Slowing Charm to harvest hair from even the swiftest Granian winged horses. The investigator found that the hair from extremely swift Granians was even more potent, reducing the brewing time for their Exstimulo Potions.[12]\n\nThe Summoning Charm could not be used on buildings.[5] In addition, it would not work on living things, although they might be moved indirectly by summoning things they were wearing or holding.[13][14] It was risky to summon them in this manner, because they travelled at close to the speed of light and might be injured in the process.[13][15] The only known exception to this rule were Flobberworms, which were generally not considered worth summoning.[5]\n\nThe further the desired object was from the caster, the harder it was to summon. Hermione Granger, however, stated that it did not matter how far away the object was — so long as the caster had it clearly in mind, they should be able to summon it with ease.[2] In addition, the object's general location must be known, otherwise it couldn't be summoned.[16]\n\nThere existed counter-spells that could be placed on objects to keep them from being summoned.[17][18] Most wizarding goods sold as of the 20th century and early 21st century came pre-enchanted with an anti-theft charm to keep them from being summoned by anyone but their rightful owners.[5]\n\nHorcruxes also could not be summoned in any possible way due to the high levels of protections placed on them, as seen when nothing happened when Hermione tried to summon Slytherin's Locket, Hufflepuff's Cup, and Ravenclaw's Diadem.\n\nThe Latin word accio can mean \"I call\", \"I summon\", or \"action\". In the Hungarian translation, the spell is called \"Invito\", possibly from the word \"to invite\".",
