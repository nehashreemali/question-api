  "content": "The Disarming Charm (Expelliarmus) was a charm that forced whatever an opponent was holding to fly out of their hand. It was common to see this spell used in duels to make an opponent lose their wand.[1]\n\nIt is not known precisely who created the Disarming Charm. Some wizarding historians claimed that it may have been invented by Merlin himself, while others claimed that its first widespread use was in Madagascar in the 11th century. Even if any of this is true, the fact remains that it was not very popular until 1379, when Elizabeth Smudgling — the most likely inventor, in the opinion of Miranda Goshawk — used it in a duelling contest in Dartmoor.[4]\n\nThe Disarming Charm became Harry Potter's signature spell,[5] and it notably caused the final defeat of Lord Voldemort during the Battle of Hogwarts by rebounding his Killing Curse, because the Elder Wand recognised Harry as its master through the spell connection, and thus strengthened the Disarming Charm to the point that Voldemort's Killing Curse backfired onto himself.[6]\n\nThe Disarming Charm caused whatever an opponent was holding at the time, usually a wand, to fly high out of their hand.[1]\n\nA single Disarming Charm could also disarm multiple opponents if they were all in close proximity to one another.[7] Multiple or exceptionally powerful Disarming Charms were even able to send a target flying,[1] sometimes to the extent of knocking them unconscious.[7]\n\nLatin expellere (ex = out, pellere = to drive), meaning \"to drive out\" and \"arma\" meaning \"weapon\". Expelliarmus actually means \"to drive out the weapon\".",
