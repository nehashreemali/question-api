  "content": "Episkey[1] was the incantation of a healing charm that healed relatively minor injuries such as broken noses,[1] toes,[3] and split lips.[4]\n\nThe spell could create sudden temperature changes in the body parts being healed.[1]\n\nIt could also be used to relieve pain; as Jacob's sibling was successfully able to remove Tulip Karasu's headache after she hit her head on a branch while sleepwalking into the Forbidden Forest after she was inflicted with a curse from the Forest Vault.[5] It could also reverse the effects of the Full Body-Bind Curse.[6]\n\nThe word comes from the Greek \"episkevi\" (\"επισκευή\"), which means \"repair\".",
