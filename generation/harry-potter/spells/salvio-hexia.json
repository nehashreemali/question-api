  "content": "The spell was a powerful protective charm, with even low-skilled casters being able to produce an enchantment which protected a small area against most hexes. The more powerful the caster, the more powerful spells it would be able to block and the larger the area protected by the spell. Extremely powerful casters could cast the spell over entire castles.[3]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year, Patricia Rakepick, the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor for that academic year, taught this charm to her fifth-year DADA students, as something useful and practical to learn, considering the poor teaching that they had received from previous Professors.[2] Kingsley Shacklebolt also taught this charm to the students of Hogwarts when he was a special guest for the Dragon Club's part of the Student club challenge programme.[3]\n\nIn 1997, during their Horcrux hunt, Hermione Granger used this protective charm to seal off an area in the Forest of Dean where she, Ronald Weasley and Harry Potter were staying, to protect them from any dark forces that might have harmed them there, along with other protective charms.[1] Harry Potter cast this spell before he and Hermione visited Bathilda Bagshot.[4]\n\nIn 1998, Hermione performed this spell again to protect her, Ron and Harry in a field somewhere in Devon, after they disapparated away from the Lovegood House, where they were attacked by Death Eaters.[5]\n\nAfter the trio retrieved Hufflepuff's Cup from Gringotts Harry cast this spell on an embankment before breaking into Hogsmeade.",
