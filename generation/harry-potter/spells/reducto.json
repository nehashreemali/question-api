  "content": "The Reductor Curse[3] (Reducto)[1] was a curse that blasted solid objects to pieces.[1] It was rather easy to reduce a target to a fine mist[3] or a pile of ashes.[2]\n\nIt is unknown when and who invented this spell. It was featured in the Book of Spells, and was commented on by Miranda Goshawk, the book's author.[3]\n\nThe spell was commonly used by Ashwinder duellists during the time of Ranrok's goblin rebellion.[4]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the then Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor Patricia Rakepick taught this spell to her fifth-year D.A.D.A. students, in order to teach them something both highly practical and useful in their education.[5]\n\nThis was one of the offensive spells that Harry Potter taught Dumbledore's Army during the 1995–1996 school year in the Room of Requirement,[6] having previously used the spell during the Triwizard Tournament.[1] It was used heavily by members of the D.A. that participated in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries on 18 June 1996.[7]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the late 2010s or early 2020s, a Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force spent a series of evenings grinding hermit crab shells before remembering this spell. After focusing on mastering this powerful spell, they used it to blast the shells into an extremely-fine powder, although they also reduced their kitchen table to sawdust in the process. However, the process did reduce the brewing time for their Dawdle Draught.[8]\n\nThe incantation \"reducto\" is derived from Latin reduco, meaning \"reduce\" or \"bring down\".",
