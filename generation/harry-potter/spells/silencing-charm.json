  "content": "The Silencing Charm (Silencio) was a charm that rendered the victim temporarily mute. Working on both beasts and beings, it was immensely difficult to perform, more so on ravens than frogs. If performed incorrectly, the target would swell up to an immense size and begin making deafening sounds.[1]\n\nThe song of the Fwooper would drive the listener insane, so wizarding law dictated that fwoopers must be sold with silencing charms placed on them. Additionally, the charm must be recast on the Fwooper every month by any wizard or witch who owned one of these birds.[3]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Filius Flitwick taught his fifth-years how to cast this charm in Charms class, in preparation for their Ordinary Wizarding Levels that year.[2]\n\nIn October 1995, Professor Flitwick had his fifth-year Charms students practise this charm, and assigned it as homework to those who could not perform it competently in class.[1]\n\nPenelope Fawley was placed under the effects of a Silencing Charm whilst being trapped inside a portrait in her office at the British Ministry of Magic.[4]\n\nThe incantation \"silencio\" is Latin and Spanish for \"silence\".[14]",
