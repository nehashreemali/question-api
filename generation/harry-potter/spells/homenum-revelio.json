  "content": "The Human-presence-revealing Spell[3] (Homenum Revelio) was a charm which revealed the presence of other humans in the surrounding environment. The spell indicated a body by a marker.[2] It was also a variation of the Revelio Charm.[1]\n\nThis spell created no flash of light when cast. When this spell was cast on a person it created an odd sensation. According to Harry Potter, it felt like \"something was swooping low over him, immersing his body in its shadow\".[4]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Patricia Rakepick taught her fifth-year students this charm in Defence Against the Dark Arts, in preparation for their Ordinary Wizarding Levels that year.[5]\n\nIt was used in 1991 and 1993 by Dumbledore, nonverbally, to detect Harry and Ron under the former's Cloak of Invisibility.[3]\n\nOn 1 August 1997, Hermione Granger used this spell at 12 Grimmauld Place after escaping pursuing Death Eaters Antonin Dolohov and Thorfinn Rowle.[2] On 30 December 1997, Death Eaters Selwyn and Travers ambushed Lovegood House and Travers used this spell to locate Harry Potter.[4] It is possible that it was related to the spell Specialis Revelio, and it is very likely that the spell couldn't detect magical creatures such as house-elves, goblins, etc.\n\nHominum is the genitive, plural form of the Latin word homo, which means \"person\".[8] Also in Latin, revelo means \"I unveil or reveal\".[9]",
