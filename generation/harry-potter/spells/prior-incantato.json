  "content": "Prior Incantato,[1] otherwise known as the Prior-Use Spell,[3] was a charm that forced a wand to show an \"echo\" of the last spell it had performed.[1][2][4] Its counter-charm was the Eradication Spell, which removed these images.[1]\n\nPriori Incantatem, otherwise known as the \"reverse spell effect\",[5] was an especially rare manifestation of this spell that occurred when two wands with the same core (that is, taken from the same exact specimen of animal) attempted to duel each other. The winner's wand forced the loser's wand to produce \"echoes\" of the most recent spells performed in reverse order.[2][4]\n\nWhen cast, the wand in question would be forced to produce an image of the last spell it cast. The spell could be cast multiple times to cycle through the history of a wand's use, and it was for this reason that criminals would often borrow another's wand in order to commit crimes, as, if they were to use their own wand, it could be traced back to them.[1] Despite this forensic usefulness, however, the spell could only reveal what magic the wand had recently done and not who had actually performed said magic; the examinations of the wands of Morfin Gaunt and Harry Potter both proved they had cast the suspected dark spells (Avada Kedavra and Morsmordre, respectively), but not that they had been cast by the accused parties, Morfin Gaunt and Winky, meaning that if a wand was stolen, used in a criminal act and then returned it could lead to the wand's owner being falsely accused and even imprisoned.[1][6]\n\nAs dictated by the subtle laws of wands, when a duel occurred between wizards with wand cores harvested from the same creature, simultaneous spell-casting by both parties triggered a rare, powerful effect called Priori Incantatem.[2][4] Both wands became linked through a single, golden thread. Hundreds of smaller golden beams shot off from this central thread to form a cage around the duellers.[2]\n\nThe two wand holders were then forced to compete in a battle of wills by forcing golden beads of light to move along through the beam back towards their opponent.[2] When one wand managed to overcome the other, it forced the losing wand to regurgitate \"echoes\" of the most recent spells it had cast, in reverse order.[2][4]\n\nIf one of these spells was the Killing Curse, then a ghostly \"echo\" of the murdered person could emerge from the killer's wand. Such \"echoes\" retained the \"appearance and character\" of the deceased person. They were able to hold conversations and could remember the events leading up to and following their deaths.[2][4] However, these \"echoes\" were not ghosts, nor were they considered to be returning the deceased person from the dead;[4] indeed, they could only linger on the mortal plane for a few moments before they faded back into the beyond. The affected wand would also start emitting shrieks of pain, indicating that the process of being forced to reveal its previously cast spells (or murdered victims) was painful.\n\nIt is unclear if these \"echoes\" were actually conscious, sentient manifestations of the people in question, or merely conjured images. An \"echo\" of James Potter appeared self-aware enough to explain the predicament to his son and implore him to get to safety once Priori Incantatem ended; a similar \"echo\" of Lily Potter watched for an opening by which Harry could break the linked spells and duck to safety, and then pressed him to take it. Both \"echoes\", among others present at the time, were aware of their ability to linger and made use of it to distract Voldemort long enough for Harry to escape.[2] If these \"echoes\" were, in fact, recollections of the dead from behind the Veil, it would be only one of two known methods of effecting such, the other being the Resurrection Stone.\n\nMorfin Gaunt confessed to killing the Riddles and handed over his wand, which was \"proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles\". Prior Incantato was not able to reveal that the wand had been wielded by Tom Riddle at the time.[6]\n\nPenny Haywood used this spell on a lost wand to figure out that it was the wand that had been used to shrink all the furniture in the Hufflepuff common room. When Jacob's sibling later presented this wand as evidence, Florence Finnigan accidentally identified it as hers.[7]\n\nAmos Diggory cast this spell on Harry Potter's wand in the aftermath of the Death Eater attack at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup, in order to determine whether he conjured the Dark Mark over the campsite.[1]\n\nDuring the 2010–2011 school year, Linderina Crane cast this spell on the wands of Daniel Page, Ivy Warrington and their friend while investigating an attack in Hogsmeade.[8]\n\nLord Voldemort was resurrected by Peter Pettigrew using the blood of Harry Potter in the Little Hangleton graveyard on 24 June 1995. A duel ensued between Voldemort and Harry, during which their wands (which both contained feathers from the phoenix Fawkes) became connected, triggering Priori Incantatem. Voldemort's wand was ultimately overcome by Harry's, causing it to release \"shadows\" of people he had murdered with it: Cedric Diggory, Frank Bryce, Bertha Jorkins, as well as Lily and James Potter.[2][4]",
