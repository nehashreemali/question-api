  "content": "The Revealing Charm[3] (Aparecium)[1] was a charm that revealed secret messages written in Invisible Ink, or any other hidden markings written using other means such as Concealing charms.[4]\n\nOn 1 February 1993, Hermione Granger used this spell on Tom Riddle's Diary to see if anything could be read. Nothing appeared after she used the spell because that was not the enchantment placed on the book.[1] This spell was also listed in the Book of Spells (chapter 2) by Miranda Goshawk.[4]\n\nThe Revealing Charm may have been the implied spell Snape used when he tapped the Marauder's Map with his wand and ordered the parchment to \"reveal your secrets\" before being insulted by the Marauders.[5]\n\nDuring the 2008–2009 school year, a student used this spell to reveal the chains that were trapping Gossamer in his portrait.[6]\n\nThe Latin word appareo which means \"to become visible or to appear\".",
