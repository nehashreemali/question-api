  "content": "The Revulsion Jinx[2] (Relashio)[1] was a jinx that forced the target to release its grip on whatever it was holding. It worked on both living and inanimate targets, so long as it was holding something.\n\nThis jinx appeared as a jet of purple sparks.[3] Underwater, this spell fired a jet of boiling water at whatever the caster was pointing their wand at.[1]\n\nProbably from the French verb relâcher meaning \"to release, to set free\", Spanish relajo meaning \"to loosen up, to release\", or Italian rilascio (pronounced the same way as the spell) meaning \"I release\".",
