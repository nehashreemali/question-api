  "content": "A Portkey was a magical object enchanted to instantly bring anyone touching it to a specific location.[2][1] In most cases, a Portkey was an everyday object that would not draw the attention of a Muggle.[2] Travelling by Portkey was said to feel like having a hook \"somewhere behind the navel\" pulling the traveller to their location.[2]\n\nThe sensation of travelling by Portkey was universally agreed to be uncomfortable, if not downright unpleasant, and could lead to nausea, giddiness, or worse.[1]\n\nWizards who could not Apparate (dematerialise and reappear at will), who wished to travel by daylight (meaning that broomsticks, Thestrals, flying cars and dragons would be inappropriate), or whose destination had no fireplace (rendering Floo powder useless) would have travel via a Portkey as a last resort.[1] Portkeys also seemed to have no limit as to how far they could transport the users, as Eulalie Hicks and Jacob Kowalski travelled from New York City to the train where the rest of Dumbledore's first army was, which was en route to Berlin from London. New York City was more than three thousand miles from either Berlin or London. Lord Voldemort, on the other hand, had to fly a fairly great distance from Nurmengard Castle, Austria in order to get near enough to Malfoy Manor to Apparate there.\n\nAlmost any inanimate object could be turned into a Portkey. The incantation used to turn an object into a Portkey was Portus. Once bewitched, the object would transport anyone who grasped it to a pre-arranged destination. A Portkey could also be enchanted to transport the grasper(s) only at a given time. In this way, the arrivals and departures of great numbers of witches and wizards could be staggered, enabling such events such as the Quidditch World Cup to take place with few security breaches.[1]\n\nWhen secrecy was paramount and mass movement was planned, the chosen Portkey would be a nondescript object secreted in an out-of-the-way place so that it would be taken for a piece of unimportant debris by Muggle passers-by. Accidents were still known to occur, however. Two Muggle dog-walkers found themselves accidentally transported to a Celestina Warbeck concert in 2003 because their dogs had run off with an old trainer on Clapham Common (leaving an anguished crowd of witches and wizards to look frantically for their Portkey on a stretch of empty grass, hopefully seizing old crisp packets and cigarette ends). One of the Muggle dog-walkers was even invited on stage by Celestina to perform a duet of A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love. While the Memory Charm placed upon him by a harried Ministry official seemed to take at the time, he later wrote a popular Muggle song that bore an uncanny resemblance to Celestina's worldwide hit, with Ms Warbeck being unamused.[1]\n\nBefore the creation of the Hogwarts Express, Portkeys were used as a means of transportation to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to not draw the attention of Muggles. Eventually, another method was sought because the majority of students would either not find the item that was their Portkey or not arrive in time to take the Portkey. Many students were also 'Portkey-sick', and the Hospital Wing was filled with students for the first few days of term while they got over their nausea and distress.[3]\n\nThe sensation of travelling by Portkey was universally agreed to be uncomfortable, if not downright unpleasant, and could lead to nausea, giddiness, or worse. Healers recommended that the elderly, pregnant and infirm avoided using Portkeys. The suggestion of arranging Portkeys for the transportation of annoying relatives saved many a wizarding family Christmas.[1]\n\nSome Portkeys were preset to travel to their destinations at a specific time. Examples included the Portkeys that transported wizards to the Quidditch World Cup in 1994[2] and the ones that transported members of the Order of the Phoenix from the different Order safe houses to The Burrow after the Battle of the Seven Potters in 1997.[4]\n\nOther Portkeys were triggered immediately by a person's touch. Examples included the Triwizard Cup, which transported Harry Potter and Cedric Diggory to Little Hangleton instantaneously,[5][6] and the broken statue head that instantly sent Harry Potter back to Hogwarts after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.[7] It is unknown how one affected the difference between the two types of Portkey.\n\nBoth types of Portkey travelled to the destination along with their users. With touch-activated Portkeys, touching them again could transport their users back to their original location, as was the case with the Triwizard Cup.[8] Time-activated ones could be handled before and after their assigned moment of use without effect. However, they could also be enchanted to re-activate again after a short amount of time to return to their previous location for re-use by others.[9]\n\nThe Door in the office of the Rare, Obscure, and Confounding Case Division in the British Ministry of Magic represented a type of rare and unstable Portkey. Due to its unstable nature, it was impossible for a user travelling through it to know where they being transported to ahead of time.[10]\n\nIn or around 1932, the British Ministry of Magic passed legislation prohibiting the use of Portkeys without prior consent.[11] It is unknown what the punishment for doing so was, but the law was still in place by the 1990s, as Remus Lupin had knowledge of it. He warned that the creation of unauthorised Portkeys would incur punishment,[12] and Cornelius Fudge was furious when Albus Dumbledore created one in front of him without permission, although Dumbledore didn't appear to have received a punishment for doing so.[7]\n\nThe term \"Portkey\" originates from the French porter, meaning \"to carry\", and the English \"key\", in the sense of a secret or trick.[1]\n\nWhile unauthorised Portkeys are banned, it is not clear to what extent the British Ministry of Magic can detect their creation or usage.",
