  "content": "Vulnera Sanentur[1] was the song-like incantation of a healing spell which healed deep wounds, and could also be used as the counter-curse for the curse Sectumsempra.[2]\n\nFor maximum effect of the spell, the incantation had to be repeated thrice; firstly slowing the flow of blood to prevent death by exsanguination; the second to clear residue and begin to heal the wounds; and the third to fully knit the wounds, although dittany had to be applied to prevent scarring.[2]\n\nBody parts that had been completely removed with Sectumsempra could not be restored even using this spell.[4] It was also ineffective against werewolf-inflicted injuries, which were cursed wounds with no known way to fully heal.[5]\n\nDuring a large influx of students into the Hospital Wing during the 1986–1987 school year whilst Poppy Pomfrey was away visiting family, Minerva McGonagall asked Jacob's sibling to learn this spell so they could help fix minor injuries whilst she concentrated on the major ones. Jacob's sibling agreed, and learnt the spell from Filius Flitwick before helping out.[6]\n\nHarry Potter, being influenced by seeing how Severus Snape used this spell to heal Draco Malfoy, suggested to Madam Pomfrey after the Battle of the Astronomy Tower to heal Bill Weasley with a charm when he saw the damage inflicted onto Bill's face by the werewolf Fenrir Greyback, until he was notified that cursed wounds could not be healed by charms.[5]\n\nVulnera Sanentur derives from the Latin vulnus \"wound\", (in which the roots of the English \"vulnerable\" may be seen)[10] and sanare, \"to heal\"; it is translated \"may the wounds be healed\".[11]",
