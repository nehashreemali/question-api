  "content": "The Water-Making Spell,[3] also known as the Aguamenti Charm[2] (Aguamenti) was a charm that conjured a jet of clean, drinkable water from the tip of the caster's wand. This spell, in addition to being a charm, could also be classified as conjuration, an advanced form of Transfiguration.[1]\n\nIt is unknown when this charm was invented. The wand movement for this spell was a smooth wave movement from right to left.[1] The Water-Making spell also appeared to be the opposite of the Fire-Making Spell, which was used to conjure flames instead.\n\nIn the 1980s, this spell was taught at N.E.W.T.-level in Charms class at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, to sixth-years.[2][4][5] In the 2008–2009 school year, Professor Flitwick planned to introduce the charm much earlier that year to first-year students.[6]\n\nDepending on the caster's concentration and intentions, this charm can be anything from a simple trickle of water to a wave. It was taught to sixth year students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Charms class.[2][4][5] The spell's incantation was Aguamenti.[7]\n\nThis spell was useless against Fiendfyre, a spell that conjured cursed flames, as the water conjured from this spell would instantly evaporate on contact with the dark fire.[8]\n\nIn both Spanish and Portuguese, \"agua\"/\"água\" means \"water\" and \"mente\" (also in both Italian and Portuguese) means \"mind\"; these derive from the Latin terms \"aqua\" (\"water\") and \"mens\" (\"mind\"), the latter's singular dative case rendered as \"menti\" (\"to the mind\" or \"for the mind\"). Given J. K. Rowling's love of puns, it would also seem plausible that there might have been a hybrid of \"água\" and \"augment\", in the sense of \"increase\", in her mind.",
