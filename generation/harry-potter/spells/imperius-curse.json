  "content": "The Imperius Curse (Imperio) was a tool of the Dark Arts, and was one of the three Unforgivable Curses. When cast successfully, the curse placed the victim completely under the caster's control, making the victim unquestionably obedient to the caster. A person under the curse was said to be Imperiused.[1]\n\nNotably, a person with exceptional strength of will could resist the curse. The fact that this curse could be directly defended against, made it unique amongst the Unforgivable Curses.[3] The penalty for using this curse in Great Britain was the same as for the other two Unforgivable Curses (the Killing Curse and the Cruciatus Curse): a life sentence in Azkaban.\n\nUnlike the Cruciatus Curse, being subjected to the Imperius Curse — when adequately cast — was not an unpleasant experience, in fact, quite the opposite; the victim of an Imperius Curse was placed in a calm, trance-like state in which all feeling of responsibility and anxiety was banished, similar to hypnosis. However, when Harry was under the curse, he believed that his curse may not have been very strong, thus the sensation from casting a more powerful Imperius Curse may be more intense than the known account.[3]\n\nAn adequately Imperiused being was placed under the caster's total control and was directed to do anything and everything the caster wished them to do, including crimes such as murder, political corruption, embezzlement, and even committing suicide (as explained by Barty Crouch Jnr, disguised as Alastor Moody and teaching the Unforgivable Curses to a group of fourth-year students at Hogwarts that included Harry Potter, where he explained \"I could make it jump out of the window, drown itself, throw itself down one of your throats\").[1] Regardless, the Imperius Curse could also be used for good and not only evil purposes, depending on the caster's intentions.\n\nMost people under the curse were nevertheless completely under the caster's command, and could not resist it at the very least, performing many feats that they would normally be unable or unwilling to do. Also, whilst under the caster's control, the curse appeared to endow the victim with whatever skills that are required in order to complete the task at hand, such as increased physical strength, expanded knowledge, or granting them the ability to cast spells far above their level. For example, when Imperiused, Neville Longbottom was able to perform a series of \"quite astonishing gymnastics\" under the curse that he normally would not be capable of.[3]\n\nIt was possible for someone who had already been Imperiused to place others under the curse as well, which would allow it to spread. It is presumed that this would place the person under the control of the original caster. For example, Madam Rosmerta, who had been Imperiused by Draco Malfoy sometime during the 1996–1997 school year, was able to place Katie Bell under the Imperius Curse in an attempt to deliver a cursed necklace to Albus Dumbledore.[4] It is also possible that Corban Yaxley Imperiused Pius Thicknesse to place other high-ranking members of the Ministry of Magic under the curse in order to facilitate the overthrow of Rufus Scrimgeour.[5]\n\nWhen a correctly cast Imperius Curse was terminated — for whatever reason — the victims became themselves again, as happened after the final defeat of Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters in the Battle of Hogwarts, when all of the people across the country who had been Imperiused by him or his supporters were released from the spell.[6] Also, any pain that the curse had negated by the pleasant sensation would return, along with any other pain that the victim had suffered for the duration of the curse.[7]\n\nAlthough it was possible to use the curse on Secret Keepers to control them, it was impossible to use it to make them divulge the secret, as it must have been done on the Keeper's free will.[8]\n\nThe usage of the Imperius Curse on a person could be suspected or detected, as a Ministry pamphlet did note that one possible sign of an Imperiused person was acting in a manner inconsistent with their usual personality.[9]\n\nIf the Imperius Curse was performed poorly, it could damage the mind of the intended victim, an example being Muggle Junior Minister Herbert Chorley. It seemed the damage was long-lasting, as Chorley was sent to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries to recuperate, believing he was a duck.[10] This was likely due to the fact that powerful, Dark Magic might leave irreversible biological damage, such as when George Weasley had his ear cursed off permanently. Presumably, this is one of the reasons why the spell was outlawed.\n\nResisting the Imperius Curse was possible, but required great strength of will and character.[3][11] The fact that it could be resisted made it unique amongst the three Unforgivable Curses, as it was the only curse that had a direct manner of defence. Harry Potter,[3] Barty Crouch Snr, and Barty Crouch Jnr each learned to resist the curse after being subjected to its effects,[12] although the latter two took quite a long time before building the said resistance. It would also appear that in the event that the victim succumbed completely to the control of the caster, unsuccessful attempts at throwing off the curse could have adverse effects on their physical and mental well-being. It could also be resisted if the caster tried to compel the victim into doing something that the victim had prior knowledge of, such as when Lucius Malfoy used the curse to make Broderick Bode try and steal a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries; Bode, who worked as an Unspeakable, was aware that prophecies could only be removed by those whom they referred to and carried protections that would inflict injury on anyone else who tried to take them, and as such tried very hard to resist Malfoy's Imperius Curse when it compelled him to do so.[13]\n\nBarty Snr was able to resist the curse when it was placed on him by Lord Voldemort himself, but Crouch was ultimately unable to fully break free from its hold over him and became delirious as a result.[14][12] Professor Jakub Gorski put up a valiant fight against the Imperius Curse put on him by the Dark wizard Bly, after he was made to attack his own students. Gorski ended up fainting from the strain of resisting it.[15] According to Severus Snape, resisting the Imperius Curse was similar to Occlumency. Both required a great amount of willpower, though it is unknown if Occlumency would actually work against the curse.[11]\n\nThe curse could also be broken free of if the victim suffered considerable mental shock from another source; Broderick Bode and Katie Bell, both placed under an Imperius Curse, suffered such shocks (in Bode's case, protective charms around a prophecy sphere and in Katie's case, an extremely powerful and deadly curse from a necklace) which lifted the Imperius Curse from them.[3][4][13]\n\nThe Imperius Curse was invented during the early Middle Ages.[16]\n\nAfter the Wizards' Council was reformed into the Ministry of Magic, tighter restrictions were placed on the use of certain kinds of magic. The Imperius Curse was deemed by the Ministry to be Dark Magic, and, along with the Cruciatus and Killing Curses, were declared \"unforgivable\" in 1717.[16] The use of any of these three curses on a fellow human being would result in a life sentence in Azkaban, unless there was sufficient evidence that the caster did so under the influence of another's Imperius Curse; this was known to be a loophole that many Dark wizards and witches abused and lied about while they were facing trial and awaiting their sentence to prison time, particularly after the First Wizarding War.[1]\n\nMultiple Secret Keepers in the past were subjected to the Imperius and Cruciatus Curses in an attempt to divulge the secrets they kept, but to no avail, as the Keeper had to reveal their secret willingly and voluntarily.[8]\n\nDuring the First Wizarding War, when Bartemius Crouch Senior was in charge of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, he fought violence with violence, and legalised the three Unforgivable Curses for Aurors against the Death Eaters in order to win the war.[17] This was repealed once the war was over, as it was no longer necessary.\n\nIt was also at that time that many Death Eaters, such as Lucius Malfoy, Corban Yaxley, Walden Macnair,  Avery, Crabbe, Nott and Goyle claimed that they had served under Lord Voldemort only because of the Imperius Curse. While their claims were accepted, the Ministry assigned personnel to attempt to determine who was truly under the curse and who was lying just to escape punishment. However, they were not perfect in proving deception. Malfoy, Macnair, and several others still eluded justice under the cover of this lie.[18]\n\nLucius Malfoy was another such Dark wizard who avoided imprisonment in Azkaban after Voldemort's first defeat in 1981 by claiming that he had been under the Imperius Curse.[19] The Ministry was also flawed in several other ways when it came to detecting true Death Eaters; while a person’s pure-blooded heritage could be used as evidence to determine whether they were a Death Eater or not, this was nevertheless extremely difficult to prove, allowing many alleged \"victims\" to continue to escape prosecution, despite lingering suspicions.[1]\n\nDuring the first half of the 1994–1995 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Barty Crouch Jnr, disguised as Alastor Moody, demonstrated these three curses to his fourth-year classes on spiders,[1] despite the Ministry's disapproval.[20] Later, he claimed that he had permission to perform the Imperius Curse on students in order to teach them how to resist it,[3] though this might also have only been an excuse just to get back into practice with it.\n\nWhile Barty Crouch did not use the curse to make the students do anything they would vehemently object to, most of the students under the curse were nevertheless completely under Crouch's command, and could not resist at the very least, performing physical feats that they would normally be unable to do; Harry Potter was the only one who managed to resist the curse and eventually shake it off after several attempts, due to his exceptional strength of willpower.[3]\n\nIn 1995, Harry and the Order of the Phoenix considered the possibility that the Death Eaters may have placed an Imperius Curse on then-Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, but Albus Dumbledore suggested otherwise, which was of little comfort to them.[21]\n\nIn 1995, Lucius Malfoy twice used the Imperius Curse to try and acquire a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries for Voldemort, first on Order of the Phoenix member Sturgis Podmore and then on Unspeakable Broderick Bode to compel them to break into the department and steal the prophecy; both attempts failed, however, as Sturgis was apprehended in the act of trying to break in and Bode triggered the defensive spells around the prophecy when he attempted to take it, resulting in injury. Bode himself tried very hard to resist the curse as he knew about said protections and that they would trigger if he, who was not the subject of the prophecy, tried to take it.[13]\n\nDuring the 1996–1997 school year at Hogwarts, Professor Snape had his sixth-year Defence Against the Dark Arts class write an essay on resisting the Imperius Curse, and thought they were so poorly written that he had to \"endure\" them.[22]\n\nWhen Lord Voldemort took over the Ministry, the three curses were once again legalised: this time every wizard and witch had the right to use them as they pleased.[23] In fact, they were practised in Hogwarts as part of the curriculum in the Dark Arts class under the cruel tutelage of Professor Amycus Carrow. After Voldemort's death and the revolutionising of the Ministry under Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt, the three curses were once again forbidden, and many people under the Imperius Curse's influence felt like they were coming out of trances.[6]\n\nDeath Eaters made use of the curse in both the First and Second Wizarding Wars to force many innocent people to do their bidding. For example, Lucius Malfoy used the Imperius Curse to force Broderick Bode and Sturgis Podmore to try to steal a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries in 1996,[13] and Corban Yaxley placed the Imperius Curse on Pius Thicknesse (albeit with difficulty and great effort) as part of the plan to take over the Ministry of Magic in 1997.[5]\n\nAs the curse was legalised in 1998, even normally law-abiding citizens were permitted to use them during such time. Harry Potter used the curse three times on two different individuals in order for the Trio to break into Gringotts Wizarding Bank undetected.[24] Minerva McGonagall used it to force Amycus Carrow to bind himself and his sister.[25] After Voldemort was defeated and killed by Harry Potter, the victims throughout the country who had been Imperiused by the Death Eaters started to come back to themselves.[6]\n\nThis curse takes its name from Spanish Imperio ('Empire' in English), which in turn comes from the Latin Imperium, which means \"power\" or \"authority\", or Impero, which means \"to rule\".\n\nThis is also the root of imperative, which is the form of a verb that acts as a command: this is certainly what the Imperius Curse achieves.",
