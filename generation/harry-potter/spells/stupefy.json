  "content": "The Stunning Spell[6] (Stupefy),[5] also known as the Stupefying Charm,[4] or Stunner for short,[5] was a charm[2][3] that stunned the target, rendering them unconscious. This charm was exceptionally useful in duelling, as it can quickly end a duel without causing lasting damage.[1]\n\nThe spell also had the ability to halt moving objects.[7] The counter-charm to the Stunning Spell was the Reviving Spell.[5] It could also be defended against with the Shield Charm.[8] Stupefy Duo was a more powerful variant of the spell.[9]\n\nIn 1782, Flavius Belby attempted to use a Stunning Spell against an attacking Lethifold, but only succeeded in blasting a hole through his bedroom door.[10]\n\nIn 1927, Leta Lestrange used a Stunning spell on the Matagot security guards in the French Ministry of Magic to try to subdue it, but instead it multiplied itself and attacked her, Newt, and Tina.[11]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Bill Weasley taught this spell to his fellow fifth years on the Training Grounds.[12]\n\nThis spell was used by Ministry wizards to try to stop whomever cast the Dark Mark during the 1994 Quidditch World Cup Campsite riots,[5] and was used in the Forbidden Forest that same year by multiple dragon keepers at the same time to manage dragons for the Triwizard Tournament.[6] In 1995, Harry Potter learned this spell in preparation for the third task of the very same tournament. He practised it on Ron Weasley who complained about it not being easy to aim where you fall when you are stunned.[13]\n\nHarry also taught this spell to Dumbledore's Army during the 1995–1996 school year, during one of the meetings in December 1995.[14]\n\nThe spell was used numerous times during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, by both the D.A. and the Order of the Phoenix; it was also used during many other battles of the Second Wizarding War, such as the Battle of the Astronomy Tower,[15] the Battle of the Seven Potters,[16] the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor,[17] the 1998 Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank,[18] and the Battle of Hogwarts.[19]\n\nScorpius Malfoy and Albus Potter, discussed whether to use this spell to destroy the Experimental Time-Turner that they stole from Hermione Granger's desk at the Ministry.[20]\n\nThe Stunning Spell was used to instantly render a target unconscious without causing lasting damage.[5] The use of multiple Stunning Spells simultaneously will amplify the effect.[21] This was particularly useful towards creatures with spell resistance, such as dragons, trolls, giants and half-giants, but might result in injury for ordinary individuals.\n\nFor example, Professor McGonagall had to be moved to St Mungo's after being hit with the spell by multiple British Ministry of Magic employees in 1996,[21] and Madam Pomfrey expressed surprise that it did not kill her.[22]\n\nThe effects of a Stunning Spell may be counteracted with the Reviving Spell, but will also wear over time. It can also be deflected by a Shield Charm. Half-giants were resistant towards the spell; Rubeus Hagrid was unaffected by this spell when, in 1996, several British Ministry of Magic employees attempted to remove him from Hogwarts grounds.[21]\n\nIt was also possible to bewitch objects to be resistant to the spell. Fred and George Weasley bewitched their fireworks to explode when hit by Stunning Spells.[23]\n\nStunning Spells were also ineffective against Matagots, which would simply multiply and become hostile if the spell was used on them.[11]\n\n\"Stupefy\" comes from the Latin word stupere, meaning \"to be stunned\". Stupefy is also an English word, which means \"to stun\" or \"to amaze\".",
