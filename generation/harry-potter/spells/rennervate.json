  "content": "The Reviving Spell[4] (Rennervate)[1] was a charm that awakened a living target from a state of unconsciousness. Consequently, it served as the counter-charm to the Stunning Spell.[1]\n\nThis spell was sometimes accompanied by a flash of brilliantly coloured red light, as seen when Harry Potter used it on Albus Dumbledore.[3] However, when Amos Diggory used it on Winky, when Dumbledore used it on Viktor Krum, and when Dumbledore used it on Bartemius Crouch Junior, no light accompanied their incantations. It might be possible that Harry was a less experienced caster, or that Dumbledore was unconscious from an extremely powerful potion and not a spell, or both.\n\nIt could be used to counteract a single Stunning Spell, although it was ineffective against multiple Stunners hitting an individual.[5] It was also ineffective against Dark Magic, such as the Drink of Despair, when only used once.[3]\n\nWhen the spell was used on deceased bodies with the intent to reanimate them, however, they wouldn't come back to life, but rather their physical form could be controlled by the wizard in a form of necromancy.[6]\n\nThe original incantation was Enervate, which means \"to weaken\".[13] Due to this misconception, J. K. Rowling officially renamed it to \"Rennervate\",[13] which means \"to energise\".",
