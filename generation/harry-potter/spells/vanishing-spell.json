  "content": "The Vanishing Spell[2] (Evanesco)[1] was a Transfiguration spell used to vanish both animate and inanimate objects \"into non-being, which is to say, everything\".[3]\n\nThe Vanishing Spell was one of the most complicated spells taught at Ordinary Wizarding Level (A.K.A. OWL).[4] It became more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished; for instance, a snail, as an invertebrate, was rather simple, whereas the mouse, as a mammal, presented a great challenge.[2] The greatest challenge, however, was the vanishment of a kitten, which Hermione Granger managed to do by mid-year.[5]\n\nMinerva McGonagall stated that Vanished objects went \"into non-being, which was to say, everything\".[6][3] Certain objects could be enchanted to resist Vanishing Spells, such as fireworks. For example, Fred and George Weasley charmed their Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes fireworks so that if anyone attempted to Vanish them, not only would they remain but would multiply by ten each time would so occurs.[7]\n\nIn The Wizard and the Hopping Pot from The Tales of Beedle the Bard, the son of the original owner of the pot tried to vanish the pot, but the spell had no effect.[8] Also in the story Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump in the same book, the witch Babbitty Rabbitty successfully vanished a hat.[9]\n\nDuring the 1987–1988 school year, Professor McGonagall taught this spell was taught to fourth-years in Transfiguration at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[6]\n\nOn 23 June 1991, Harry Potter may have used this spell unintentionally to make the glass at the zoo disappear.[10] At the start of the 1992–1993 school year, after being forced to take a photo with Gilderoy Lockhart for Colin Creevey and then asked to sign it, Harry wished he knew a good Vanishing Spell to escape the embarrassment.[11] In May 1993, Neville Longbottom may have used this spell unintentionally during a Transfiguration lesson, in which Professor McGonagall stated that all students would still be having their end of year exams in one week, despite the attacks on students and the suspension of Albus Dumbledore and Rubeus Hagrid. Neville's wand slipped and one of the legs on his desk vanished after hearing the announcement.[12]\n\nDuring the 1995–1996 school year, Professor Minerva McGonagall introduced this spell in her very first Transfiguration class with the fifth-year students, giving them a lecture and then setting them on vanishing snails. This spell was referred to by McGonagall in its plural form when she introduced it, along with Conjuring Spells.[4] When none of the students except Hermione Granger could perform the spell properly, Professor McGonagall told the students to practise the spell overnight, for a fresh start the next day. In their second lesson, the students were given questions on the Vanishing Spell for homework.[4] On 6 September, however, the students were given a break from this spell and instead were given a long and difficult essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus Spell.[13] Later on in the year, Professor McGonagall returned the class to Vanishing Spells, this time working to make mice disappear.[2] However, in the week leading up to the Gryffindor vs Slytherin match, she abstained from giving them homework so that the Gryffindor Quidditch team could practise.[14]\n\nBefore 1 September in 2008, the Warrington sisters Ivy and Winifred both got Hogwarts acceptance letters, but their father didn't want Winifred to go, which angered her and resulted in her casting the Vanishing Spell on Ivy's trunk, but the spell rebounded and landed on herself.[15]\n\nDuring the 2008–2009 school year, after Cassandra Vole verbally bullied Daniel Page, Ivy chased her down and attempted to Vanish her wand, but missed and Vanished a suit of armour instead. Professor Neville Longbottom gave Ivy and her friends detention, during which they had to polish every suit of armour without magic.[15]\n\nThe incantation \"Evanesco\" is a Latin word meaning \"vanish\" or \"disappear\".[19]",
