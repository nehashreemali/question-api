  "content": "The Scouring Charm (Scourgify) was a cleaning charm used for washing things.[1] It could also be used to clean out smaller bundimun infestations.[2] This spell was listed in the third chapter of Book of Spells by Miranda Goshawk.[1] Many wizarding families used this spell, both for cleaning and punishing people who swore, as the spell caused human mouths to be filled with soap.[1] This spell was also one of the few methods of effectively cleaning the teeth of a Leucrotta, as they disliked having their teeth touched with a brush.[3]\n\nJames Potter used this charm to bully Severus Snape on the Hogwarts grounds, causing soap to fill his mouth.[4]\n\nIn the 1987–1988 school year, this charm was taught to the fourth-years in Charms class by Professor Filius Flitwick.[5] Jacob's sibling later used the Scouring Charm to clean up Bundimun Secretion in Rubeus Hagrid's hut and used it the following year to help clean the teeth of a Leucrotta they had befriended.[6][3]\n\nHermione Granger taught Neville Longbottom the Scouring Charm to clean frog guts out from under his fingernails in their fourth year.[7]\n\nThe Scouring Charm was used by Nymphadora Tonks when attempting to clean Hedwig's cage during their liberation of Harry Potter from 4 Privet Drive in 1995. The spell had only a minimal effect and Tonks admitted that she had never quite gotten the hang of \"household-y\" spells of this type.[8] It was later used by Ginevra Weasley on 1 September that year on the Hogwarts Express to clear Stinksap that had squirted from Neville's Mimbulus mimbletonia.[9]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the late 2010s or early 2020s, Gethsemane Prickle \"visited\" a Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force and was so offended that their cauldron failed to meet Ministry cleanliness guidelines that she spent the next forty-two minutes forcing them to practise the Scouring Charm while relentlessly lecturing them. To the investigator's chagrin, these cleaning methods reduced the brewing time for all of their potions.[10]\n\nPerhaps related to English scour, \"clean\". -ify is a common English suffix meaning \"to make ...\". Therefore scourgify likely means \"to make clean\".",
