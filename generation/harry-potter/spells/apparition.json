  "content": "Apparition was a form of magical transportation in which the user travelled instantly from one location to another without traversing the space in-between. This was accomplished by having the user focus on a desired location in their mind and then purposely disappearing from where they were to reappear at the desired location. Apparition was by far the fastest and most convenient way to get to a desired destination, but was tricky to pull off correctly and disastrous if botched.\n\nThe ability to Apparate was a relatively advanced skill for wizards, but other magical creatures were capable of disappearing and reappearing of their own volition as well, such as house-elves, Phoenixes, Diricawls, and Zouwus.\n\nApparition was a popular method of travel in the wizarding world, though it was stated that plenty of adult witches and wizards did not bother with it, preferring slower but safer methods of travelling such as broomsticks, the Floo Network, or Portkeys. Albus Dumbledore once noted that most people vomited the first time they Apparated. According to Harry Potter, Apparition felt like being \"forced through a very tight rubber tube\".[1]\n\nAccording to Wilkie Twycross, British Ministry of Magic official and Apparition Instructor, one had to recall the three Ds: Destination, Determination and Deliberation. One had to be completely determined to reach one's destination, and move without haste, but with deliberation.[2] A witch or wizard ordinarily required a wand in order to Apparate,[3] but, like many other spells, it could be performed without one.\n\nThis type of transportation could cause an audible noise, ranging from a small pop to a loud crack that may sound to Muggles like a car backfiring, depending on their skill. The more skilful they were, the quieter they were able to Apparate. Very skilled and powerful wizards, such as Albus Dumbledore, Lord Voldemort, and Narcissa Malfoy, could Apparate completely silently.[4][5] House-elves could also Apparate, but without any of the restrictions that wizards had due to their unique type of magic. For example, they could Apparate inside and outside of Hogwarts and even the Crystal Cave, where powerful enchantments prevented all witches and wizards from doing so. Also, when they Apparated, the sound was most often a loud crack.\n\nApparition was called \"Disapparition\" from the point of view of someone at the place being left behind and \"Apparition\" from the point of view of someone travelling to their desired destination, much like the words \"disappear\" and \"appear\".\n\nThe British Ministry of Magic required all witches or wizards hoping to Apparate to have a licence. One of the reasons was so that they could not Apparate into a Muggle bank and steal all the money therein.[6]\n\nApparition had a range limit,[7] and became increasingly difficult with the distance to be travelled. It was very strongly advised that intercontinental Apparition only be attempted by the most highly skilled of wizards,[8] otherwise risking splinching,[9] severe injury, or even death. Apparition also required a familiarity with the terrain of the place the wizard wanted to go to, as they needed to be able to visualise it clearly.[10] In 1996, Harry Potter performed Apparition very impressively to get himself and a weakened Albus Dumbledore over a long distance, most likely across the country.\n\nWhen Harry, Ron and Hermione were trapped by the Death Eaters in Malfoy Manor, Bellatrix Lestrange alerted Voldemort, who was investigating Nurmengard Castle in the Austrian Alps. In order to get to Malfoy Manor, Voldemort had to fly most of the way. He had to fly over a \"dark and stormy sea\" to get within range of the manor.[3] As such, even an extremely powerful wizard like Voldemort couldn't Apparate much further than the length of England. As such, wizards apparently could not Apparate somewhere outside of range by imagining that location and Apparating small stretches at a time, as doing so would possibly cause splinching.[9]\n\nBesides the user focusing in their mind on a desired place, the limitation of the choice of destination is unclear. It is most likely that the wizard or witch could only Apparate successfully to somewhere they had seen or been to before. During Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger's hunt for Horcruxes in late 1997, they Apparated to places familiar to Hermione, such as Tottenham Court Road[11] and other holiday places, with Hermione noting the past significance and familiarity of each place that she Apparated to. The same principle applied during late 1996 when Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter Apparated to the residence of Horace Slughorn in Budleigh Babberton, a place previously familiar to Dumbledore but not to Harry.[1]\n\nSeeing a destination through a photograph or other image was usually not enough to let the user Apparate there safely. Dumbledore had seen a picture of The Cave in which he suspected Voldemort to have hidden a Horcrux seen in Tom Riddle's room at Wool's Orphanage. However, as Dumbledore said to Harry in his sixth year at Hogwarts, he had been trying to locate the cave for a very long time.[12] This suggests that a witch or wizard trying to Apparate needed to have some idea of where their desired destination was. It was not enough to only have seen it or known about it.\n\nHowever, in 1997, Hermione and Harry were able to Apparate to Godric's Hollow without remembering the place, thus surely not being able to visualise it (Hermione had never been there, and Harry had been there only as a one-year-old child).[13] Hence, wizards and witches may have been able to Apparate to places they hadn't seen or been to before as long as they clearly thought about the name of the place and know the approximate location. Apparition was probably not completely accurate in this case, as they Apparated to Godric's Hollow, but apparently weren't able to choose where exactly in Godric's Hollow they would appear.\n\nIn 1890, George Osric accidentally Apparated to the West End instead of where Eleazar Fig had requested. He frightened the theatre-goers before realising his mistake and Apparated to the correct location. Eleazar had given him a very vague description of it, though George told him he had received even vaguer descriptions than that.[14] It was also used by Victor Rookwood, first in a failed attempt to intercept George, and again months later to kidnap a student, an act that would end in his own demise soon after. Anne Sallow, though too young to legally learn it, was able to Apparate with her uncle's dead body.[15]\n\nDuring the 1920s, the École D'Apparition Démoniste Limus, a dedicated Apparition school, was operating in the Place Cachée under the headmistress Madame J. Tardy. The school had been founded by the Warlock E. Limus and at that time employed Professor Antoine Charrier and the house-elf W. Pouffe.[16]\n\nIn 1979, Kreacher managed to escape the Horcrux cave via Disapparition, following Regulus Black's order to \"come home when he finished his task\". Later, in 1997, he brought Mundungus Fletcher into Grimmauld Place via side-along Apparition.[17]\n\nIn 1992, the house-elf Dobby was able to get into Harry's bedroom in 4 Privet Drive then Disapparate \"with a crack like a whip\",[18] and appear and disappear inside Hogwarts.\n\nIn 1993, an unnamed Ravenclaw student suggested that Sirius Black may have entered Hogwarts via Apparition.[19] Harry Potter learned more details about Apparition in a conversation with the Weasleys regarding travelling to the 1994 Quidditch World Cup.[20]\n\nCornelius Fudge appeared out of thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime Minister of the goings-on at the Quidditch World Cup.[21]\n\nPercy Weasley Apparated downstairs every morning while living at The Burrow, just to prove he could. Charlie Weasley failed his Apparition test the first time because he landed on top of a woman who was shopping five miles south of where he meant to appear.[20] Fred and George Weasley passed their Apparition test with distinction and enjoyed popping into other people's bedrooms at Grimmauld Place with a loud cracking noise, just to annoy people.[22]\n\nIn 1995, Mundungus Fletcher went AWOL and Apparated out of Privet Drive to buy some stolen cauldrons. His Apparition sounded like a car backfiring and caused a racket that disturbed the neighbours. When Mundungus got back, Arabella Figg shouted him down and hit him with her purse and her shopping bag, which was loaded with cat food, to rebuke him for deserting his post. Mundungus then Disapparated back to Grimmauld Place to report to Albus Dumbledore why he deserted Harry the night that Harry and Dudley Dursley got attacked by Dementors.[23][24]\n\nAlbus Dumbledore took Harry along by Side-Along Apparition for the first time in 1996. Harry stated that the sensation was uncomfortable, like \"being forced through a very tight rubber tube.\"[1]\n\nIn 1996, a notice for the 12-week Apparition course appeared on the Gryffindor common room wall, along with a sign-up sheet. These lessons began on the first Saturday in February and were held in the Great Hall, led by Ministry Apparition Instructor Wilkie Twycross. During these lessons, the first student to Apparate was Susan Bones, but she unfortunately got splinched and left her leg behind. The Heads of House surrounded her and fixed the problem. By the third class, student nicknames for the Apparition instructor included \"Dog-breath\" and \"Dung-head\".[2]\n\nIn October 1996, Harry caught Mundungus selling his loot to Aberforth. Realising that he was caught red-handed, Mundungus cast a jinx on Harry and Disapparated before Harry and Nymphadora Tonks could catch him.[25]\n\nThe Apparition Test took place in Hogsmeade on 21 April for those who had already turned 17, including Ron Weasley, who was struggling with the subject. He and Hermione Granger signed up for extra practice lessons in Hogsmeade. Hermione passed the Apparition Test on her first try, but Ron left half an eyebrow behind and failed. It is unknown when and where Ron took the test a second time, or if he ever passed or even retook it at all. Harry, Ernie Macmillan, and Draco Malfoy were too young to take the test in April 1997.[26] That would presumably include Neville Longbottom as well, since his birthday was a day before Harry's.\n\nHarry never took the Apparition Test, although he impressively initiated side-along Disapparition with Dumbledore to get him back from the crystal cave to Hogwarts when he was weak. Harry was still underage at that point, but he was holding Dumbledore's arm, and therefore the Ministry would not have Traced him. After Harry turned 17, he Apparated at least once alone to Grimmauld Place under his Invisibility Cloak,[11] and several times side-along with Hermione and Ron under the cloak. The Ministry never knew because, by then, they were no longer underage, so the Trace did not work.\n\nPius Thicknesse made it an imprisonable offence to connect 4 Privet Drive to the Floo Network, place a Portkey there, or Apparate in or out in order to prevent Harry from getting out of there safely, so the Order used the so-called Seven Potters plot with Polyjuice Potion and broomsticks to get Harry to safety.[27]\n\nDuring the Battle of the Seven Potters, Mundungus chickened out and Disapparated the moment he saw Voldemort coming, leaving Mad-Eye Moody open to attack from the Death Eaters, who finished him off with a Killing Curse.[28]\n\nDuring Voldemort's reign over the Ministry of Magic, Apparition to and from the Ministry offices was restricted only to the senior members.[29]\n\nA variant of Apparition used to transport two or more individuals at once was called Side-Along Apparition. This method could be used by adults seeking to transport underage wizards or licenced individuals could use this method to transport an injured party. To perform this version of Apparition, the more able party would Apparate with the other party holding onto an arm.\n\nThis method was recommended by the British Ministry of Magic for parents with underage children to escape from danger quickly. The party who could not Apparate had to hold onto the other as tightly as possible. House-elves could perform Side-Along Apparition as well. If both parties knew how to Apparate, they wouldn't need to grip so tightly, as the Apparator would simply be guiding their passenger.[12]\n\nSide-Along Apparition could also be forced, as when Death Eater Yaxley grasped onto Hermione Granger's arm when she, Harry Potter, and Ron Weasley escaped from the Ministry of Magic in 1997.[30] He was transported with her when she Apparated to 12 Grimmauld Place, and she was only able to escape by shaking his grip with a Revulsion Jinx and Disapparating again.[31] In 1998, Fenrir Greyback captured Harry and forcefully dragged him along when Apparating to Malfoy Manor. Harry found it impossible to break free of this forced Side-Along Apparition.[3]\n\nWhen hoping to Apparate with creatures, it would depend on their nature. Many had a magical nature which would not enable them to travel by Apparition.[10]\n\nGiant Purple Toads could disappear into boxes or other hideouts to spite wizards who harvest their warts.[32]\n\nHouse-elves could Apparate, including where wizards were prevented from doing so, such as Hogwarts, the crystal cave, and 12 Grimmauld Place. Dobby Apparated to and from the Hogwarts Hospital Wing to visit Harry Potter in 1992. In 1998, when Harry, Ron Weasley, Luna Lovegood, Dean Thomas, Griphook, and Garrick Ollivander were imprisoned in the Malfoy Manor cellar while Hermione Granger was being brutally tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange, Dobby arrived to rescue them. He first took Luna, Dean and Ollivander to safety by Apparating to Shell Cottage with them, then returned to rescue the others.[3]\n\nPhoenixes were capable of a form of Apparition-like teleportation, disappearing and reappearing in a flash of flames. Like the variant demonstrated by house-elves, phoenixes were not hampered by any restrictions that normally prevented wizards from doing so and they could bring other people along with them. In 1996, Albus Dumbledore used phoenix Apparition to escape John Dawlish, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Percy Weasley, and Dolores Umbridge after Harry was caught training Dumbledore's Army. Fawkes flew over to Dumbledore, who caught his tail and disappeared in a burst of flame.[33]\n\nThe Diricawl was a magical species of bird that could disappear from one location and reappear in another, similar to how a wizard was able to Apparate.[34] Pukwudgies were also capable of Apparition.[35]\n\nThe Zouwu, a magical species of cat, could jump from one location and land in another — much like Apparition — and its ability was extremely powerful, seeing as one was enough to bypass the French Ministry of Magic's defences and cross to the other side of Paris.[36]\n\nA licence to Apparate was required to practise Apparition legally, at least in Great Britain. These could be gained from the Department of Magical Transportation[37] and were required since at least the 1920s.[38] In Great Britain at least, one had to be at least seventeen years old to obtain such a licence, though other countries, such as Denmark, made underage Apparition legal. Lessons in Apparition were available, for an extra charge, to students who were or would be of legal age when the next test was administered. One reason why the British Ministry of Magic required all witches or wizards hoping to Apparate to have a licence was so that they could not Apparate into a Muggle bank and steal all the money therein.[6] Though it was physically possible to Apparate without a licence, it was strictly prohibited due to the dangers of unsuccessful Apparition, such as injury.\n\nSplinching could occur when one had insufficient determination to reach one's goal, causing certain body parts to fail to arrive at the destination with the wizard. For example, Susan Bones left behind her leg when she accidentally splinched herself during an Apparition lesson. Although her leg was successfully reattached, she was left shaken by the incident.[2]\n\nSplinching also occurred in 1997 to Ron Weasley after Disapparating from 12 Grimmauld Place.[31] Ron also failed his first Apparition test because his examiner saw he had lost half of his eyebrow at the last minute.[39] In cases of unlicensed Apparition when injury resulted, the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad could level heavy fines. In cases where splinching occurred, if the victim had not been treated properly, the injury could be much more serious, such as when Ron suffered severe blood loss after splinching away part of his upper arm while escaping from 12 Grimmauld Place in 1997, with the area of his upper arm only being able to be healed when Hermione Granger applied great quantities of Dittany to it.[6] It is unknown when and where Ron retook the Apparition test, or if he ever passed or even retook it at all.\n\nHowever, Harry Potter successfully Apparated multiple times without a licence between June 1997 when he brought Albus Dumbledore back to Hogsmeade village by Side-Along Apparition,[12] and many times during the Second Wizarding War.\n\nAt Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, students in their sixth year could sign up for Ministry of Magic Apparition lessons. Those who turned seventeen before the first Apparition Test date had the opportunity to take additional practice sessions in Hogsmeade.[6] Those whose birthday was not before the original date had the option of taking the test later. To earn the licence, one had to prove ability to Apparate flawlessly, with even the slightest mistake (whether splinching even the slightest part of the body or missing the target location) resulting in failure of the test.\n\nAn Anti-Apparition Charm and/or Anti-Disapparition Jinx could be used to prevent a witch or wizard from Apparating or Disapparating to or from a location. Many magical places, such as the British Ministry of Magic headquarters, the French Ministry of Magic headquarters, the Woolworth Building (the headquarters of the MACUSA), the Crystal Cave, Nurmengard Castle, Hogwarts Castle, Azkaban, and the cellar in Malfoy Manor, were warded off against Apparition, which prevented people from simply appearing inside those places, forcing them to have to physically venture to them or Apparate near them, as well as the Anti-Disapparition Jinx preventing people inside those places from being able to leave by means of Disapparition. The Anti-Apparition Charm was typically used to keep out unwanted visitors from a certain location. Hogwarts had an Anti-Apparition Charm and Anti-Disapparition Jinx cast upon it for most occasions. The Anti-Disapparition Jinx could also be used to entrap particularly targeted people from any means of escape within that location for certain purposes, as seen when Harry, Ron, and Hermione Apparated into Hogsmeade shortly before the Battle of Hogwarts. The Death Eaters had already placed an Anti-Disapparition Jinx on Hogsmeade in order to keep the three trapped there.\n\nThere was a method of teleportation used by house-elves which was not influenced by the charm or jinx, as they were bound by more powerful magic which required them to appear whenever their master called. However, it was possible that all known Anti-Apparition Charms and Anti-Disapparition Jinxes worked only on humans, for they had been bypassed by creatures such as house-elves and phoenixes.[3]\n\nThe Floo Network and Portkeys could also be used to access or depart from locations bound by an Anti-Apparition Charm or Anti-Disapparition Jinx. House-elves could also take humans along with them when Disapparating regardless of whether or not there was a charm or jinx on the area, as Dobby did during the skirmish at Malfoy Manor.\n\nApparition is derived from the word \"Appareo\" which is Latin for \"appear\" or \"I become visible\".\n\nIn the film adaptations of the series, Apparition differs greatly in deployment from the book series. The appearance of Apparition is also inconsistent between characters and uses. As it somewhat deviates from the books, the way Apparition is portrayed in the films is most likely a stylistic choice made to better suit the visual medium of a film. It could also be explained that the style differs by distance. Short range and/or without needing to change locations immediately, the less intense, black smoke form of the Death Eaters is used. Long range and/or needing to change locations immediately, the more intense twisting into and out of nothingness, the kind which was first used by Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter in the Half-Blood Prince, is then used.\n\nFred and George Weasley, near the beginning of the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, show Apparition as it is shown in the books, by merely appearing out of thin air with a loud noise, usually startling the people around them, like Molly Weasley. Interestingly, they were the only wizards in the films to Apparate such short distances until the film inspired by Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. In the film version of the Duel in the Ministry Atrium, Voldemort demonstrated vanishing and reappearing short distances in a disembodied and invisible state, which allowed him to communicate telepathically with Harry, as well as physically possess him later on. In the film version of Voldemort's Last Stand, Voldemort was able to pursue Harry through Hogwarts Castle by Apparating around the building, first appearing in the Seventh-floor corridor with Nagini in tow, and then at the Catwalks by the Quad battlements to try and ambush Harry. While first fighting Harry, he suddenly vanished from the bottom of the staircase below Harry and reappeared at the top of the stairs behind Harry.",
