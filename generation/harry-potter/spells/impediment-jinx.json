  "content": "The Impediment Jinx[5] (Impedimenta),[1] also known as the Impediment Hex,[4] was a jinx that hindered the movement of the target, slowing it down or stopping it in its tracks.[1]\n\nIt was a common spell used in duelling,[5] and since it only caused minimal damage, it was commonly taught in schools, including in Hogwarts' Duelling Club.[6]\n\nThe Impediment Jinx stopped or slowed down people or creatures, temporarily immobilising an attacker and offering the caster a chance to escape.[6] It was even capable of freezing a wasp in mid-air.[1]\n\nHowever, the effect was only temporary,[1] lasting only for a few seconds on average.[7] Additionally, even though it was effective against most animals and people, it was ineffective against armoured creatures, such as Acromantulas and Blast-Ended Skrewts. Unless the caster managed to hit them on their underbellies, which have no protective armour.[1] It was also useless against enemies that had no physical corporeal form, such as lethifolds.[4][6]\n\nWhile the jinx would usually simply immobilise a target,[1] it could also be used to push or throw a target backward,[3] or simply decrease the velocity of the victim's movement.[5]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Patricia Rakepick taught fifth-year students in Defence Against the Dark Arts how to perform this jinx.[8]\n\nThe incantation \"Impedimenta\" is derived from the Latin word \"impedimentum\", meaning \"a hindrance\".",
