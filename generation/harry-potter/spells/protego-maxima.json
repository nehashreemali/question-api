  "content": "Protego Maxima was a stronger version of the Shield Charm that, when cast in combination with Fianto Duri and Repello Inimicum, conjured up an almost impregnable magical protection barrier.[1]\n\nPeople who were out of the shield couldn't see and hear the wizards or witches that were protected. Spells cast at it (if not of enough power to break it) created large, resonating explosions. This spell was the core of the shield summoned around Hogwarts; it was the shield itself that was seen descending over the castle. It should be noted however that on occasion protective enchantments could be breached with a shield penetration spell.[1]\n\nThis spell was cast by Filius Flitwick, Molly Weasley and Horace Slughorn to protect the boundaries of Hogwarts Castle from the Death Eater forces in the late hours of 1 May 1998, prior to the Battle of Hogwarts that started at midnight the next day. The Death Eaters, on Voldemort's command, started bombarding the magical protection with spells, and it was ultimately brought down by a spell cast by Voldemort.[1]",
