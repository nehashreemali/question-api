  "content": "The Wand-Extinguishing Charm (Nox) was a charm[1] that caused the light at the end of the caster's wand to be extinguished, thus acting as the counter-charm to the Wand-Lighting Charm (Lumos).[3]\n\nThe Wand-Extinguishing Charm was invented by the same witch who invented the Wand-Lighting Charm, Levina Monkstanley. She invented the Wand-Lighting charm in the 18th century and invented the Wand-Extinguishing Charm around that time too, otherwise her wand would remain lighted indefinitely.[3]\n\nThis spell was taught to first-year students in Charms class at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1984–1985 school year by Professor Filius Flitwick.[4] It was also detailed in The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection[1] and Book of Spells.[3]\n\nIn Latin, \"nox\" means \"night\". Nox is also the name of the Roman Goddess of night derived from Nyx (Greek goddess of darkness and night).",
