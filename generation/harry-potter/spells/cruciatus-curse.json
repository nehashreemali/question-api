  "content": "The Cruciatus Curse (Crucio),[1] also known as the Torture Curse,[5] was a tool of the Dark Arts and one of the three Unforgivable Curses. When cast successfully on the victim, the curse inflicted intense, excruciating physical pain on them,[1] and would result in insanity if they were subjected to it for a prolonged time.[3] The penalty for the use of this curse on another human being was a life sentence in Azkaban, unless there was enough evidence that the caster did so under the influence of the Imperius Curse.[1]\n\nTwo well-known victims of this curse were former Aurors Alice and Frank Longbottom: the Longbottoms were tortured into insanity with it by Death Eaters Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan Lestrange, and Barty Crouch Jnr.[3][4]\n\nThe pain caused by the Cruciatus Curse was described by Harry Potter as being worse than \"one thousand white-hot knives, boring into the skin\" and beyond what most people would ever experience. The sensation of the curse was so intense that the person under the effects wished for unconsciousness and even death, as a means of escaping the searing pain.[2]\n\nThe pain from this curse would cause permanent physical and mental injury if exposed to for a prolonged time, as in the case of the aforementioned Longbottoms, who spent the rest of their lives in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries because of the terrible trauma the curse caused.[4] This incident was considered one of the most horrific fates for the victim, even worse than death. Presumably, such permanent effects were not uncommon if the victim was exposed to a particularly intense curse for a long period of time.\n\nAs Memory Charms could be broken through torture, the Cruciatus Curse was capable of such a feat, though it required a certain level of exposure in time and intensity to break through it.[6] Bertha Jorkins suffered such a trial, and the end results was that both her body and mind was damaged beyond repair.[2][6]\n\nAlthough it was possible to use the curse on Secret Keepers to inflict pain on them, it was impossible to use it to force the secret out of them, as it had to be done on the Keeper's free will.[7] If the curse hit an inanimate object, it might have caused it to shatter instead.[8][9]\n\nTo successfully perform this curse, simply uttering the incantation was not enough; the wizard or witch had to possess a deep desire to cause the victim pain and to take great pleasure in their suffering. For example, despite being furious with Bellatrix Lestrange for her murder of his godfather in 1996, Harry Potter was only able to cause her a brief moment of pain with the Cruciatus Curse because he used it out of \"righteous anger\", though he was still able to knock her off of her feet with it.[8]\n\nHarry performed it more effectively in 1998 on Amycus Carrow, who spat in Minerva McGonagall's face. Amycus was thrown into the air, thrashing and screaming in pain, and then knocked unconscious. This suggests that although Harry's curse was intense, he still lacked the fundamental sadism to make it last for a prolonged time.[10]\n\nBellatrix, on the other hand, due to being a witch with profound sadistic intents and an utter lack of conscience, was able to cast the curse with an almost daunting potency, and seemingly had an affinity to it.[3][11][8][12]\n\nWhen Lord Voldemort used it against Harry Potter at his rebirth in Little Hangleton graveyard, he would consistently maintain its effect by keeping his wand fixed on Harry, which left him momentarily writhing on the ground whilst feeling like \"his very bones were on fire\", screaming, until Voldemort raised his wand and thus broke it off.[2] When Gellert Grindelwald used it against Jacob Kowalski in 1932, he cast it once on him and Jacob was still hurting from the curse afterwards, until Vicência Santos cast a spell to free him from the pain.[13]\n\nOnce cast, there was no spell that could defend against the Cruciatus Curse.[14] However, there were still evasive options available against it. The spell could be dodged by hiding behind a solid object, and a particularly strong-willed wizard could merely resist the pain until the spell was lifted, as Harry Potter refused to plea to Voldemort when being tortured by this curse,[2] and Hermione Granger managed to lie to Bellatrix Lestrange through the curse[12] (though, as noted above, prolonged exposure of the pain from this curse would cause permanent physical and mental damage).[2][6] It is also possible that repeated exposure to the curse's effects could enable a victim to build some resistance to them, as Borgin was noted by Mundungus Fletcher as having recovered remarkably quickly following the curse's use on him by a Metamorphmagus Dark wizard.[15]\n\nAnother option was to interrupt the caster before they could finish speaking the incantation, as Severus Snape did to great effect against Harry Potter in 1997 by using Legilimency to anticipate the spells he would use.[16] Furthermore, like with the Killing Curse, it could also be intercepted with a few other powerful fast spells.\n\nShould the caster have used the Elder Wand, or actually any wand, without winning its allegiance, to cast the curse onto its true master, the wand would refuse to inflict any pain onto its master. However, there would still be a certain level of impact that could send the body flying.[17]\n\nAlthough the main purpose of the Cruciatus Curse was to torture, it could not be used to break through the defences set by the Fidelius Charm, as the secret had to be revealed willingly and voluntarily.[7] Also, if the victim did not possess the desired information (such as Alice and Frank Longbottom), then the usage of the curse served little to no purpose in information gathering.[3]\n\nDespite there being no spell defence against it,[14] Vicência Santos was somehow able to lift the curse from Jacob Kowalski in 1932, by pointing her wand at him and using a nonverbal spell.[13]\n\nAs its title of an \"unforgivable curse\" suggests, the Cruciatus Curse had only very limited practical uses.\n\nBesides its basic use to sadistically inflicting pain,[1] the curse was most popularly applied as a method of punishment and a method of interrogation. The advent of truth serums rendered the Cruciatus Curse an obsolete and generally impractical method for this specific purpose. However, should truth serums not be available, the interrogator might opt to use this curse instead.[18]\n\nCompared with the use of truth serums and even the Imperius Curse, the Cruciatus Curse was much less efficient, as the person being interrogated had a high risk of falsely confessing in order to relieve their suffering under the spell, regardless whether they actually held the information the interrogator wished to seek and extract. As the curse couldn't force a Secret Keeper to divulge the hidden information, it was essentially useless in that regard, despite many in the past had been subjected to such an attempt to extract the knowledge.[7]\n\nThe curse also could be used effectively in a duel, inflicting tremendous pain onto the opponent, disabling them from countering so long as they maintained the curse's effects.[11][8]\n\nThe Cruciatus Curse was invented during the early Middle Ages.[19] According to Barty Crouch Jnr, the curse was once very popular.[1]\n\nAfter the Wizards' Council was reformed into the Ministry of Magic, tighter restrictions were placed on the use of certain kinds of magic. The Cruciatus Curse was deemed by the Ministry to be dark magic, and, along with the Imperius and Killing Curses, were declared \"unforgivable\" throughout the UK in 1717.[19] The use of any of these three curses on a fellow human being would result in a life sentence in Azkaban without parole (unless there was sufficient evidence that the caster did so under the influence of the Imperius Curse or for other defensible reasons).[1]\n\nMany Secret Keepers in the past had been subjected to the Cruciatus and Imperius Curses in an attempt to divulge the secrets they kept, but to no avail, as the Keeper had to reveal it willingly and voluntarily.[7]\n\nDuring the 19th century, Noctua Gaunt opposed and attempted to change the family's use of the Dark Arts and wished to uncover more about Salazar Slytherin's legacy. While attending Hogwarts, she heard about and discovered the secret entrance to Slytherin's Scriptorium, and this was the last time that both her brother and anybody else in the wizarding world heard from her. Noctua embarked on a journey through the Scriptorium's convoluted puzzles but died in front of the final door that required the use of the Cruciatus Curse to advance, as she had nobody to use the curse on.[20]\n\nNear the end of the century, Noctua's brother and his family were still known for their pure-blood supremacist views and regularly performed the Cruciatus Curse on unsuspecting Muggles \"for sport\". When Ominis Gaunt, as a child, refused to perform the curse, he was tortured by his own older siblings and parents until he relented, prompting him to later cut ties with them. Using his wand to see around, the blind Ominis attended Hogwarts in the late 1880s alongside Sebastian Sallow, going to his friend's house in Feldcroft during the holidays.[21]\n\nOminis was a Slytherin student like all the Gaunts, though he felt ashamed by his legacy, and like Noctua, did not share his family's views on blood purity and was repulsed by the Dark Arts. However during his fifth year, a reluctant Ominis was convinced by Sebastian Sallow and another student to open Slytherin's Scriptorium once again. After he opened the door using Parseltongue and going through all the puzzles, the students at last found the trapped remains of Ominis's aunt. Still traumatised by his childhood, Ominis refused to perform the forbidden curse, forcing his friends to cast it on each other to escape and access the Scriptorium.[21]\n\nDuring the First Wizarding War, when Barty Crouch Snr was in charge of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, he fought violence with violence and legalised the three Unforgivable Curses for Aurors against the Death Eaters in order to win the war.[22] This was repealed once the war was over, as it was no longer necessary.\n\nShortly after Voldemort's first downfall, four Death Eaters — three Lestranges: Bellatrix, Rodolphus and Rabastan; along with Barty Crouch Jnr — captured the Aurors Frank and Alice Longbottom and tortured the two with the Cruciatus Curse for information on Voldemort's whereabouts. The repeated and prolonged usage of the curse caused the couple to become insane and the four to be captured and tried in front of the Council of Magical Law. All four of them were found guilty and sentenced to life in Azkaban. This act was considered to be one of the most heinous and infuriating attacks in modern history.[3]\n\nDespite the repeal of the curse's legal usage, in the 1994–1995 school year, Barty Crouch Jnr, under the disguise of Alastor Moody, showed these three curses to his fourth-year classes on spiders[1] despite the Ministry's strong disapproval.[23] However, since the use of the curse was illegal only on a fellow human being, the demonstration of the curses on the spider may have been within legal boundaries.[1]\n\nIn the 1995–1996 school year, Dolores Umbridge, in a last-ditch effort to draw information from Harry Potter, almost used the curse on him. She was certain in the belief that she would not be called upon to answer for it due to the only witnesses to the act being Harry and his closest friends (and the present Slytherin students would not support Harry in any way) and that she would be able to avoid punishment for the curse due to the political climate either way. However, she was dissuaded from using the curse by Hermione Granger, who gave Umbridge a false story in order to save Harry.[18]\n\nWhen Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange killed Harry's godfather Sirius Black, Harry chased down Bellatrix and performed the curse on her out of rage. However, it was performed unsuccessfully, as Harry was doing it with \"righteous anger\" and couldn't muster the will to actually cause her harm.[8]\n\nIn 1997, Draco Malfoy, in a fit of rage and recklessness, attempted it on an eavesdropping Harry and later in the same year.[24] Harry attempted to use it on Severus Snape during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower but was prevented from uttering the whole incantation due to Snape's use of Legilimency.[16]\n\nWhen Lord Voldemort took over the Ministry, the three curses were once again legalised: this time every wizard and witch had the right to use them as they pleased.[25] In fact, they were practised in Hogwarts as part of the curriculum of Dark Arts class under the cruel tutelage of Professor Amycus Carrow: students were required to practise the Cruciatus Curse on other students who received detention, and the Carrow siblings used it to punish students as they see fit; the likes of Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle greatly enjoyed practising the Curse on fellow students, earning themselves top grades in the class. Those who refused to comply, such as Neville Longbottom, were physically punished with knife slashes.[26]\n\nHermione Granger had this curse used on her by Bellatrix Lestrange during her interrogation at Malfoy Manor in March of 1998.[12] Harry Potter managed to successfully use it on Amycus Carrow without legal consequences as well as a result of this legalisation shortly before the Battle of Hogwarts on 1 May 1998.[10] After Voldemort's death and the revolutionising of the Ministry under new Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt, the three curses were once again forbidden and their original penalties were restored.\n\nHarry Potter had a vision of Lord Voldemort ordering Draco Malfoy to use the curse on Thorfinn Rowle after he and Antonin Dolohov failed to capture Harry at Tottenham Court Road.[27] Although he saw nothing of Dolohov's punishment, Narcissa Malfoy later mentioned \"what he did to Rowle and Dolohov\" when she was afraid to contact Voldemort.[12]\n\nCrucio means 'I torture'. Cruciatus takes its name from the Latin word for 'pain' or 'torture'. The root, 'crux', meaning 'a cross', can also be seen in other words such as 'excruciating' and 'crucifixion'.",
