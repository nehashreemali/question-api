  "content": "Ravenclaw Tower was a tower in Hogwarts Castle that served as the common room and dormitories for the students of Ravenclaw House at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In general, it sported several shades of blue with bronze (all associated with the house). It was also the airiest of the four common rooms.[1][2]\n\nRavenclaw Tower was one of the three tallest towers of Hogwarts Castle, alongside Gryffindor Tower and the Astronomy Tower.[1][2]\n\nOn 1 May 1998, Harry Potter and Luna Lovegood ventured into Ravenclaw Tower in the hopes of locating the legendary Ravenclaw's Diadem.[2] However, they were ambushed by the Death Eater Alecto Carrow,[2] who then attempted to summon Lord Voldemort to Harry with her dark mark. Luna quickly knocked her unconscious to the floor with a non-verbal Stunning Spell.[3]\n\nFollowing the commotion, Alecto's brother Amycus and Minerva McGonagall arrived to see what was going on. Amycus suggested that Ravenclaw students would be blamed for having attacked Alecto, with him spitting in McGonagall's face after she protested. Harry Potter then assaulted him with the Cruciatus Curse (under his invisibility cloak), knocking him unconscious, with him explaining to McGonagall the reasons for his presence in the school. Minerva then placed Amycus under the Imperius Curse and had him drag his sister's unconscious body into Ravenclaw tower, with her then tying them both to the ceiling, rendering them unable to participate in the Battle of Hogwarts which soon commenced.[3]\n\nThe entrance to the common room was located on the west side of Hogwarts at the top of a spiral staircase located on the fifth floor, and was a door without a doorknob or keyhole, but a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle.\n\nPlaced on a mantle halfway up the staircase was a marble bust made to honour an unknown Ravenclaw wizard and Ravenclaw house overall.[4]\n\nIn order to enter the room, a person must answer a riddle asked by the eagle knocker; if they answered incorrectly, they must wait for someone else who got it right.[2]\n\nThe Ravenclaw common room had a large eagle statue mounted on the wall and two sets of stairs on the left and right. The two staircases formed a circle and therefore both led to the same place.[4]\n\nThe Ravenclaw common room was one of the airiest rooms at Hogwarts. It was a wide, circular room with arched windows hung with blue and bronze silks and a midnight blue carpet covered in stars, which was reflected onto the domed ceiling. The room was furnished with tables, chairs, and bookcases; and by the door leading up to the dormitories stood a tall statue of Rowena Ravenclaw made of white marble.[2]\n\nOn the second floor of the common room, there was a spiral staircase that led to a rooftop terrace.[4]\n\nAccording to Prefect Robert Hilliard, the sound of wind whistling around the windows of the tower was relaxing while going to sleep.[1]\n\nDuring the day, Ravenclaw students had an excellent view of the school grounds, including the lake, Forbidden Forest, Quidditch pitch, Herbology gardens and the surrounding mountains.[1]\n\nThe entrance to the Ravenclaw boys and girls' dormitories were also located in the Tower, beside a statue of Rowena Ravenclaw.[2] In the dormitory, four-poster beds were covered in sky blue silk eiderdowns[5] on platforms and the sound of the wind whistling around the windows was very relaxing. A wall was decorated with the Ravenclaw crest and the windows had blue curtains. There was also a desk and stacks of books.\n\nThe four-poster beds were covered in blue eiderdowns with navy blue curtains, a wooden nightstand next to it and their school trunk at the foot of the bed. The four poster beds had two shelves at the back of the bed, an owl perch on one side, a small carpet next to the bed and a wooden nightstand at the end of the bed on one side.",
