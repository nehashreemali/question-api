  "content": "Eeylops Owl Emporium was a chain of shops that sold owls and supplies to care for them, such as food. It had three locations in Glasgow, Leeds, and London.[1]\n\nThe London store was located at 521 Diagon Alley,[2] on the North Side of Diagon Alley. It was described as being relatively small, and dark inside, likely because owls were nocturnal creatures. On the outside of the shop, many different colours and species of owls hung in cages, watching all of the passers-by. There was also a sign which read \"Eeylops Owl Emporium – Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown and Snowy\".[3]\n\nOn 31 July, 1991, Rubeus Hagrid brought Harry Potter into Eeylops Owl Emporium to buy him his pet owl, Hedwig for his eleventh birthday present.[3]\n\nDuring the Christmas holidays in 1992, Eyelops Owl Emporium was closed, as the owner went bird-watching in Wales.[4]\n\nIn August 1996, Harry and Ron Weasley bought large boxes of owl nuts at Eeylops Owl Emporium for Hedwig and Pigwidgeon respectively.[5]",
