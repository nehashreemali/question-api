  "content": "Little Hangleton was a small village in England, within which the most prominent family was formerly the Riddles.[1] The village was six miles away from the larger community of Great Hangleton[2] and was about 200 miles away from Little Whinging.[1] The pure-blood wizarding family, the House of Gaunt, lived just outside Little Hangleton in a shack.[2]\n\nThe Riddle House was the home of the snobbishly unpopular Riddle family, who were Muggles, in the early twentieth century. It was the largest house in town, and the Riddles were wealthy, owning much of the land around.[1] The son of the Riddles was Tom Riddle Senior, who was bewitched by the witch Merope Gaunt with possibly either the Imperius Curse or a love potion in 1926, leading to the conception of Tom Marvolo Riddle, who would come to be known as Lord Voldemort. Once Merope stopped bewitching him, Tom Riddle Senior immediately left and paid no regard to Merope or their unborn son. Merope died in childbirth and Tom Riddle Jnr was placed in an orphanage.[2]\n\nVoldemort killed his father, paternal grandfather, and grandmother in the house in 1943, and framed his maternal uncle Morfin Gaunt for the crime.[3] After the murder of the Riddles, the house changed hands many times. By 1994, it was said in the village that the wealthy man who owned it neither lived there nor put it to any use, owning it for ambiguous 'tax reasons'. The only permanent resident during that time period was Frank Bryce, the Riddles' gardener, who was kept on by the house's subsequent owners.[1]\n\nIn the summer of 1994, after Peter Pettigrew escaped from Hogwarts and found the semi-corporeal Voldemort, the two wizards returned to the Riddle house to plan for Voldemort's return to power. Whilst in the house, they plotted to have the Triwizard Cup turned into a Portkey to the local churchyard, and set into motion a plan which would end with Harry Potter captured. When Frank Bryce discovered Pettigrew and Voldemort in the house and inadvertently overheard them discussing their plans, Voldemort murdered him with the Killing Curse.[1]\n\nOn the outskirts of Little Hangleton lived the Gaunts, the last direct descendants of Salazar Slytherin. Years of inbreeding made the family violent and unstable, and left them in poverty. There were frequently many snakes about the property, as the Gaunts were all Parselmouths, like their ancestor.[2]\n\nThe townspeople gossiped about the Gaunts and thought they were mad, while the Gaunts in turn considered the Muggles who lived nearby beneath them. Marvolo Gaunt died alone in the shack, after he and his son Morfin were briefly imprisoned in Azkaban, and his daughter Merope married Tom Riddle Snr and left for London.[2] The Gaunt shack was also the hiding place of Marvolo Gaunt's Ring, which Voldemort took from his uncle and turned into a Horcrux after he murdered his paternal relatives. Years later, Albus Dumbledore visited the shack when he was seeking out Voldemort's Horcruxes, and found and ultimately destroyed the ring hidden under the rotting floorboards.[4] A year later, when Voldemort realised that Harry Potter was seeking out his Horcruxes, he immediately returned to the shack first, believing it was the least safe, and was furious when he saw the floorboards torn open and the ring gone.[5]\n\nThe local cemetery of Little Hangleton was the burial place for various members of the Riddle family, including Tom Riddle Senior. It was also the site of Lord Voldemort's rebirth on 24 June 1995.[6] The Triwizard Cup, turned into a Portkey by disguised Death Eater Barty Crouch Jnr, transported Harry Potter and Cedric Diggory there.[7] Peter Pettigrew killed Cedric on Voldemort's orders, and Harry's blood was then used as part of a Dark ritual to reconstitute a body for Voldemort, along with Tom Riddle Senior's bones.[6] The Dark Lord then called his servants to him with Pettigrew's Dark Mark, thus reviving the Death Eaters,[8] and engaged in a duelling with Harry. Because of Priori Incantatem, Harry managed to escape Voldemort and return to Hogwarts with Cedric's body.[9]\n\nThe ritual which Voldemort and Pettigrew performed in the Little Hangleton graveyard would also play a role in Voldemort's ultimate fall from power. By taking in some of Harry's blood - blood which carried the magical protection from his mother, who sacrificed herself for him when he was an infant - Voldemort anchored Harry's life to his own. This would allow Harry to survive the Killing Curse Voldemort struck him with during the Battle of Hogwarts in on 2 May 1998, destroying the Horcrux within Harry and setting the stage for their final duel.[10]\n\nThe Hanged Man was a local pub, in which many townspeople gossiped about the Riddle murders. Since the Riddles were slain with the Killing Curse, the Muggle authorities could not determine the cause of death (as the curse left no signs of physical injury), and many people suspected that Frank Bryce had murdered them.[1]\n\nThis cottage, bordering the Little Hangleton graveyard, was the permanent residence of Frank Bryce. It was from here that he saw lights from the Riddle House in 1994, and - thinking it to be local children causing trouble - investigated, leading to his death.[1]\n\nHangleton derives from \"hangle\", an iron pothook[13] and \"-ton\", a suffix meaning \"town\" and which is thus often used in the names of municipalities.",
