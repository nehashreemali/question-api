  "content": "The Hospital Wing[3][4] was a part of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It was run by Madam Poppy Pomfrey, the school's matron, from at least 1971.[2]\n\nThe students and staff who suffered mishaps and injuries during the school year were sent or brought to the Hospital Wing for treatment. Poppy would prefer there be six visitors at one time for one person.[2][5] There was a room adjacent belonging to the matron.[6]\n\nThe Hospital Wing was well equipped to deal with all kinds of magical and mundane injuries, from broken limbs to regrowing lost bones.[7] Only in the most severe cases were the patients sent to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries for further treatment, such as when Katie Bell touched a cursed Opal Necklace in 1996.[8][9]\n\nLocated on the first floor, and later one or two floors up, the Hospital Wing was where Hogwarts residents went to have their medical needs met.[2][7] Within the Hospital Wing were many rows of beds with white sheets, privacy screens, and bedpans,[2][7] which Ronald Weasley once had to scrub as the result of a detention from Professor Snape.[10]\n\nThe entrance had double doors. Madam Pomfrey's office was part of the Hospital Wing complex.[6]\n\nJust outside of the Hospital Wing stood a copper statue of a unicorn over a fountain. The fountain was said to give an air of serenity and calm to the Hospital Wing.[11]\n\nIn 1991, Ron Weasley suffered a dragon bite. Dragons were closely monitored by the British Ministry of Magic, so Ron did not feel comfortable explaining  what had bit him, but Madam Pomfrey simply treated the injury as best she could. Ron made a full recovery.[12]\n\nIn 1992, Harry woke up in the Hospital Wing following his encounter with Professor Quirrell and Voldemort. He had a long discussion with Professor Dumbledore regarding the power of sacrificial love. Madam Pomfrey was upset that Dumbledore had ignored her instructions, and allowed Harry to attend the Leaving Feast. She had wanted to keep Harry a little longer for observation.[2]\n\nIn 1992, Harry was once again in the hospital wing overnight, this time because Lockhart had (while trying to mend his broken arm) completely removed the bones in his arm. He was joined by Colin Creevey, who had apparently been Petrified by the monster within the Chamber of Secrets.[7]\n\nIn 1993, Hermione ended up in the Hospital Wing because of a failed transformation using Polyjuice Potion. Because this was a potion that’s use was restricted, Hermione could not say what caused her to halfway transform into a cat, but Madam Pomfrey simply treated her.[13]\n\nJustin Finch-Fletchley, Nearly Headless Nick, Penelope Clearwater, and Hermione ended up Petrified and were moved to the Hospital Wing.[14][15] Harry and Ron visited her during her time in the wing, often leaving flowers at her bedside.\n\nLockhart, who had erased his own memory due to a backfiring Memory Charm, was also taken to the Hospital Wing before being moved to St Mungo's.[16]\n\nThe presence of Dementors, and the effect they had on Harry, made him a repeat visitor of Madam Pomfrey's. After an encounter with a Dementor on the Hogwarts Express Harry avoided a stay in the Hospital Wing solely because of Remus Lupin's quick actions.[17]\n\nDraco Malfoy was injured in 1993 by a Hippogriff during a Care of Magical Creatures lesson.[18] His wound was quickly healed, but he malingered. Malfoy also used \"continuing pain\" from the injury as an excuse to get others to do his work for him.\n\nA flock of Dementors invaded the Quidditch pitch during a match, causing Harry to fall from an extreme height.[10] This resulted in a stay in the Hospital Wing for him. The events in the Shrieking Shack also resulted in Hospital Wing visits for Harry, Ron, and Hermione.[19] While they were there, Dumbledore arranged for Harry and Hermione to rescue Buckbeak and Sirius Black with a time-turner. After they completed their task and returned to the ward, Snape burst in and expressed outrage at Black’s escape in front of Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge.[20][3]\n\nDuring the school year, Professor Lupin appeared ill several times. He was also absent from several lessons; students suspected that he ought to be in the Hospital Wing. He was actually in his office during those time, as his \"illness\" was not something Madam Pomfrey could treat.\n\nViktor Krum (the Durmstrang champion) was stunned while guarding Bartemius Crouch Snr, and was sent to Madam Pomfrey to recuperate.[21] Harry ended up in the Hospital Wing following the Third Task, but rather than it being related to the Tournament, it was because of his duel with Voldemort and therefore he needed to recover.[1]\n\nWhile in the Hospital Wing, Minister Fudge denied Voldemort's return, and Professor Dumbledore assigned missions to various people in order to deal with his return.[1] It was in the Hospital Wing that Sirius revealed himself, and was forced into a grudging alliance with Snape.\n\nSkiving Snackboxes from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes (notably Puking Pastilles and Fever Fudge) were used repeatedly by students wanting to escape Umbridge's class. These snackboxes caused projectile vomiting and raging fever, respectively, students who used them most likely ended up in the Hospital Wing.[22][23]\n\nEarly in the year, Katie Bell caught a Quaffle to the face during a Quidditch practice. In an attempt to fix the resulting nosebleed, Fred Weasley accidentally gave her a Blood Blisterpod.[24] He and George shortly escorted her to the Hospital Wing.\n\nAnother student who ended up in the Hospital Wing was Montague, who had been forced into an old, broken Vanishing Cabinet and reappeared jammed into a toilet a day later.[25] Harry was trying to find Professor McGonagall, who had previously been hit with multiple Stunners as Umbridge attempted to dismiss Hagrid.[26] Madam Pomfrey, while spooning some blue potion into Montague, told Harry that Professor McGonagall had been transferred to St Mungo's.[26]\n\nFollowing the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Ginny, and Luna were injured and required Madam Pomfrey's ministrations.[27]All save Ron and Hermione were released shortly after. Dolores Umbridge was also there for treatment, following her confrontation with the Centaurs in the Forbidden Forest.\n\nIn 1996, Katie Bell accidentally handled a cursed necklace.[8] Her stay in the Hospital Wing was brief; she was injured beyond Madam Pomfrey's skill and was quickly sent to St Mungo's. Later in the year, Ron was accidentally poisoned and ended up in the Hospital Wing for several days.[28] Lavender Brown complained to Harry that Ron was always asleep whenever she visited, and Ron admitted to Harry that he was doing it on purpose.[5]\n\nHarry also ended up in the hospital wing at the same time as Ron, having received a skull fracture from a poorly aimed Bludger during a Quidditch match.[5] While in the Hospital Wing Harry realised he could have Kreacher tail Malfoy, something he had been trying to do himself with little success. Snape took Malfoy to the Hospital Wing after Harry (to avoid being hit with the Cruciatus curse) injured him with Sectumsempra.[29]\n\nFollowing the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Aurors, members of the Order of the Phoenix, and the students who had been involved were all brought to the Hospital Wing for treatment.[30] Harry heard news of the battle from the five members of Dumbledore's Army who had responded to his call (Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, and Neville).[30]\n\nWhile in the ward, Harry explained why Dumbledore trusted Snape, as he then understood it. It was there that Fleur Delacour affirmed that her wedding to Bill Weasley would not be derailed by anything as trivial as a disfiguring injury, which healed the potential rift between herself and Molly, which also made Remus Lupin's objections to dating Tonks start to dissolve.",
