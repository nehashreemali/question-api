  "content": "Ollivanders was a wand shop founded in 382 B.C.[4] Located in Diagon Alley South Side in London, England, it was owned by the Ollivander family, widely acknowledged to be the best wandmakers in Great Britain.[1]\n\nThere were two known locations of Ollivander's wand shop. There was a branch of Ollivanders in both Diagon Alley[4][1] and in Hogsmeade.[2]\n\nThe shop was described as narrow and shabby with peeling gold letters over the door of the shop read: Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C.[4]\n\nThe shop's display consisted of a solitary wand lying on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. The shop was tiny, empty except for a single, spindly chair in the corner. Thousands of narrow boxes containing wands were piled right up to the ceiling of the tiny shop, and the whole place had a thin layer of dust about it.[4]\n\nThe Hogsmeade branch was located on Hogsmeade's High Street, as the street served as the primary location for the wizarding village's shops. It was run by Gerbold Ollivander during the late 19th century,[3] and by an associate of Garrick Ollivander during the late 20th century. The Hogsmeade branch was very similar to its counterpart in Diagon Alley.[2]\n\nIt was believed by Garrick Ollivander, a descendant of the original Ollivander, that Ollivanders arrived with the Romans, setting up a stall (which, in due course, evolved into a shop) to manufacture and sell wands to the ancient British wizards, whose wands were crudely-made and inferior in quality and performance.[5]\n\nDuring the 1986–1987 school year, Minister for Magic Millicent Bagnold came to the shop to have Ollivander repair her wand. She was in a hurry and did not want Ollivander to take extra time testing her wand. Jacob's sibling approached her in the shop, and after cleaning up some wand she knocked over on the floor, spoke to her and persuaded her to attend Knarlenbarn, requesting she bring her pet Knarl with her.[6]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year, Mundungus Fletcher went to Ollivanders to ask about the wand of an opponent whom he had lost a duel to, but Garrick Ollivander couldn't tell much. Shortly afterwards, a Hogwarts student and a friend visited to find out about Fletcher, and Ollivander told them about the previous encounter with him.[7]\n\nAt some point near the end of the 1989–1990 school year, Jacob's sibling and Jae Kim came to Ollivanders to meet Mundungus Fletcher and Ollivander, who had some information on a dark witch who had been gathering information of Jacob's sibling and their wand (who turned out to be Verucca Buckthorn-Snyde).[8]\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year, Jacob's sibling and Ben Copper visited Ollivanders to investigate Ollivander's misfiring wand.[9] After Jacob's sibling, Penny Haywood and Professor Snape successfully brewed a counter-serum for Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution, Jacob's sibling offered it to the victims of the solution, including Ollivander, in the shop.[10]\n\nOn 31 July 1991, Harry Potter was taken to Ollivanders by Rubeus Hagrid in order to get Harry a wand for his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry tried dozens of wands before he was chosen by a wand of holly and phoenix feather. Finding it curious why Harry should be destined for such wand, Mr Ollivander, who remembers every wand he had ever sold, subtly reveals Harry's new wand to be a twin brother to the one that had killed Harry's parents, and cast the failed curse,[4] adding that the cores of both wands are feathers of the same phoenix, with the other twin wand belonging to the culprit. Before Harry purchases the wand, Ollivander reveals of the terrible things done by the twin wand's owner.\n\nDuring the Christmas holidays, Ollivanders was closed with a small notice on the door, which read \"Wandered out for a spell, will return later\".[11]\n\nIn 1996, Alexandra Walker attempted to rob the shop. This event made Daily Prophet headlines. When Harry Potter visited Diagon Alley in his sixth year, he found Ollivanders shop boarded up and its owner gone as he was kidnapped by Fenrir Greyback and a group of Death Eaters.[12] He was tortured for an explanation of why Voldemort's wand and Harry Potter's wand couldn't battle. Under the Cruciatus Curse, he told Voldemort that it was because of the twin cores, and that all Lord Voldemort needed to do was use another wand.[13]\n\nOllivander was tortured and held in the cellar of Malfoy Manor until Dobby rescued him, Luna Lovegood and Dean Thomas.[14] After recovering at Shell Cottage, he went to the Weasley children's great-aunt Muriel's place to be protected under the Fidelius Charm.[13] Whilst there, he made a wand for Luna as a thank you gift for the comfort and care she had given him during the incarceration.[15]\n\nOllivanders reopened after the Second Wizarding War ended and sold wands to new witches and wizards as usual. Before September 2008, a student bought their wand from Ollivanders. Ivy Warrington also brought her wand in for Ollivander to help repair but with help from the student, she learned she was only using it wrong.[16][17]",
