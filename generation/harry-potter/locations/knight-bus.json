  "content": "The Knight Bus was a triple-decker, purple AEC Regent III RT bus that assisted stranded individuals of the wizarding community through public transportation. It operated at a very fast speed and obstacles would jump out of its way, and it could also deceptively fit through small spaces.\n\nTo hail the bus, a witch or wizard must stick their wand hand in the air in the same manner that a Muggle might do while hailing a Muggle Bus in the United Kingdom, though it is possible to book tickets for travel on the bus in advance.[1]\n\nThe Knight Bus was a relatively modern invention in wizarding society, which sometimes took ideas from the Muggle world.[2] (Although few wizards were rarely open about such inspiration). The need for some form of transportation that could be used safely and discreetly by the underage or the infirm had been felt for a while and many suggestions had been made (sidecars on taxi-style broomsticks, carrying baskets slung under Thestrals) all of them vetoed by the Ministry.[2]\n\nFinally, the Knight Bus was first commissioned in 1865.[2] The idea was proposed by then-Minister Dugald McPhail.[2] While some wizards (mainly pure-blood fanatics) announced their intention of boycotting what was dubbed \"this Muggle-esque outrage\" in the letters page of the Daily Prophet, the Knight Bus proved hugely popular with most of the community and remained busy to this day.[2]\n\nDuring the early 1990s, the Knight Bus's conductor was Stan Shunpike, who greeted passengers and handled baggage, and was driven by Ernie Prang.[1] The Leaky Cauldron offered tickets for the Knight Bus as part of its room service.[3]\n\nIn the early 2010s, a strange incident involving the Knight Bus was reported by the Daily Prophet. On the night of 25 October, as the Knight Bus sped through London, the driver Prang saw a shiny pumpkin in the road and stopped. Stan found nothing unusual, so they carried on. Suddenly, hundreds of pumpkins appeared, bouncing behind the bus, only to vanish as they neared Northampton. Just as Ernie saw the fearsome scene, he heard Stan's voice muttering his name. Turning around, he was confronted by his colleague whose head was covered by a giant carved pumpkin glowing green. Reacting quickly, Ernie banished the eerie pumpkin and continued the journey. But an unsettling silence filled the bus. Checking the beds, he found every passenger gone, replaced by a single, silent pumpkin in each bed.[4]\n\nInside, during the night, the Knight Bus had beds, curtained windows and candles burning in brackets beside each bed. During the day, there were just seats that were apparently not bolted down. The bus did not seem to have much in the way of safety features, as passengers and luggage alike usually got thrown around the inside of the bus during its high speed manoeuvres. The driver seat was more of an armchair than what a Muggle vehicle's driver seat would be. Obstacles in front of the bus appeared to jump out of the way. It did not travel underwater, but could go anywhere on land.[1]\n\nA ride on the Knight Bus cost eleven Sickles regardless of the distance. (Harry Potter paid eleven Sickles both to get from Surrey to London[1] and to get from London to Hogsmeade.)[5] For thirteen sickles, the rider also got hot chocolate, and, for fifteen, a hot water bottle and a toothbrush in the colour of their choice.[1]\n\nDue to the haphazard manners of the bus's designs and services, the hot chocolate would end up spilling all over the place when served. Despite the Knight Bus being a popular travelling method for the wizarding community that had kept it busy to this day, most of its passengers seemed very pleased to get off when they finally arrived at their stop.[1]\n\nIn August 1993, Harry Potter stumbled across the Knight Bus after leaving 4 Privet Drive, following the inadvertent inflation of Marjorie Dursley. He was almost run over by the bus after seeing a black dog looming in the shadows. On the same day, Madam Marsh was using the Knight Bus to travel to Abergavenny. Harry got off the bus at the Leaky Cauldron.[1]\n\nOn 20 April 1994, Rubeus Hagrid and the Hippogriff Buckbeak travelled together on the Knight Bus for a hearing in front of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures in regards to Buckbeak's future following the attack on Draco Malfoy.[6]\n\nDuring the Christmas holidays in December 1995, Hermione Granger used the Knight Bus to join everyone at 12 Grimmauld Place after Nagini's attack on Arthur Weasley.[7]\n\nIn January 1996, Harry, Hermione and Ron Weasley travelled back to Hogwarts from 12 Grimmauld Place on the Knight Bus after the Christmas holidays. They were accompanied by Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks. Madam Marsh was also on the bus but had to get off due to illness.[5]\n\nThe Knight Bus is named after the various night bus services throughout Great Britain, as well as a play on the word \"knight\", as it gives the connotation that the vehicle comes to the rescue of those who need it.[8]\n\n\"The Knight Bus was so-named because, firstly, knight is a homonym of night, and there are night buses running all over Britain after normal transport stops. Secondly, 'knight’ has the connotation of coming to the rescue, of protection, and this seemed appropriate for a vehicle that is often the conveyance of last resort.\n\nThe driver and conductor of the Knight Bus in 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban’ are named after my two grandfathers, Ernest and Stanley.\"",
