  "content": "King's Cross Station was considered one of the main train stations to serve London, England. Students of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry took the scarlet steam engine named the Hogwarts Express to Hogwarts Castle from Platform 9¾ every 1 September at 11 AM sharp. To get to Platform 9¾, one had to run straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10.[1]\n\nWhen Minister for Magic Ottaline Gambol commandeered a Muggle train to serve as the new mode of transport for Hogwarts students, she also had constructed a small station in the wizarding village of Hogsmeade: a necessary adjunct to the train. The Ministry of Magic felt strongly, however, that to construct an additional wizarding station in the middle of London would stretch even the Muggles' notorious determination not to notice magic when it was exploding in front of their faces.[3]\n\nIt was Evangeline Orpington, Minister from 1849-1855, who hit upon the solution of adding a concealed platform at the newly built King's Cross station, which would be accessible only to witches and wizards. On the whole, this worked well, although there were some minor problems over the ensuing years, such as witches and wizards who dropped suitcases full of biting spellbooks or newt spleens all over the polished station floor, or else disappeared through the solid barrier a little too loudly. There were usually a number of plain-clothed Ministry of Magic employees on hand to deal with any inconvenient Muggle memories that might need altering at the start and end of each Hogwarts term.[3]\n\nPlatform 9¾ was the platform from which the Hogwarts Express was boarded on September 1st. The platform had a sign hanging over it, reading: Hogwarts Express, eleven o'clock, and there was a wrought iron archway bearing the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters over the entry/exit to the platform. At the conclusion of the school year, the Hogwarts Express returned to King's Cross, bringing the students of Hogwarts back for their summer holidays. It can be assumed that the sign over the platform changes on the day the train returns from Hogwarts.[1]\n\nIn order for someone to get onto Platform 9¾, they had to walk directly at the apparently solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. Molly Weasley advised that one should \"do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.\"[1] It is not known exactly how Muggles did not, or could not get onto the platform; however, it can be assumed that powerful magic of some sort was employed in order to keep them ignorant of its existence. However, it was shown in Severus Snape's memories that Lily Evans's family was present at the platform as she boarded it, which could mean that Muggles were able to enter the platform, if made specifically aware of its existence.[6]\n\nOther concealed platforms could be opened on an as-required-basis, for instance for large, one-off events such as Celestina Warbeck concerts.[3]\n\nIn 1991, Harry Potter, being a first-year, went to Platform 9¾ for the first time after being told to go there at King Cross Station. He had no instructions on how to get on and therefore he needed the help of the Weasley family, who he had heard discussing it. Harry and Ron Weasley first met at this moment, starting a life-long friendship.[1]\n\nIn 1992, Dobby the House-elf did something to the barrier dividing platforms 9 and 10, in order to prevent Harry Potter and Harry and Ron accessing the platform.[7] All that is known about the magic he used is that it somehow made the barrier which acted as entrance/exit to Platform 9¾ solidify, thus causing Harry and Ron to crash into it, as opposed to passing through it as wizards and witches normally did.[8] Consequently, they decided the only way to get to Hogwarts was to steal Arthur Weasley's Flying Ford Anglia and fly it to the school. This caused them both numerous amounts of trouble, as they were seen by Muggles and risked wizarding exposure.[8]\n\nIn 1998, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter allowed himself to be struck with a Killing Curse by Lord Voldemort, and he entered a Limbo state in which his spirit met with the spirit of Albus Dumbledore, at a location that Harry identified as King's Cross Station. The station was, in the unconscious mind of Harry, clean and empty except for something that looked like a small, naked child, curled on the ground, with skin that was raw and rough, as though it had been flayed, which lay under a seat. Dumbledore then revealed to Harry that the form was the final piece of Voldemort's soul that had travelled to Limbo as well when he'd attacked Harry and they had both fallen unconscious.[9][10]\n\nIn 2017, Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione sent their children - Rose Granger-Weasley, Albus Potter, and James Potter - off to Hogwarts. There, they caught a glimpse of Draco Malfoy and his wife Astoria seeing off their son Scorpius.[11]\n\n\"King's Cross, which is one of London's main railway stations, has a very personal significance for me, because my parents met on a train to Scotland which departed from King’s Cross station. For this reason, and because it has such an evocative and symbolic name, and because it is actually the right station to leave from if you were heading to Caledonia, I never knew the slightest indecision about the location of the portal that would take Harry to Hogwarts, or the means of transport that would take him there.\n\n\"It is said (though where the story originated I could not tell you; it is suspiciously vague) that King's Cross station was built either on the site of Boudicca's last battle (Boudicca was an ancient British queen who led a rebellion against the Romans) or on the site of her tomb. Legend has it that her grave is situated somewhere in the region of platforms eight to ten. I did not know this when I gave the wizards' platform its number. King's Cross station takes its name from a now-demolished monument to King George IV.\n\n\"There is a real trolley stuck halfway out of a wall in King's Cross now, and it makes me beam proudly every time I pass....\"[3]",
