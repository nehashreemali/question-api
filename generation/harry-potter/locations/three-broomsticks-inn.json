  "content": "The Three Broomsticks Inn (established 1452)[3] was a popular inn and pub in the all wizarding village of Hogsmeade, which was often frequented by students from the neighbouring Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The inn was often warm, crowded, and a bit smoky, but clean and welcoming.[1]\n\nA mirror behind the bar reflected the cosy atmosphere, and popular drinks such as Butterbeer and Firewhisky were served in glasses and in foaming pewter tankards, as well as gillywater, Mulled Mead, red currant rum, and even cherry syrup and soda with ice and an umbrella. The Three Broomsticks was owned and operated by Sirona Ryan in the late 19th century[4]and by Madam Rosmerta in the late 20th century[1] and early 21st century.[5]\n\nEstablished in 1452,[3] the Three Broomsticks was located in Hogsmeade, an all-wizarding village in Scotland, and was alleged to be the village founder Hengist of Woodcroft's old home.[6][7] It can be suggested that the village grew over time, as it was so near Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\nIn the 1890s, the establishment's proprietor was Sirona Ryan.[4] By the 1990s, it was Madam Rosmerta.[1] She managed the Three Broomsticks for at least twenty years, since Harry Potter's father, James Potter, was a student at Hogwarts.[1]\n\nAccording to Hermione Granger, in Sites of Historical Sorcery it was mentioned that the inn at Hogsmeade served as human headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion.[8] It is unknown if this inn was the Three Broomsticks though.\n\nBy the 1970s, Madam Rosmerta had become a barmaid at the Three Broomsticks Inn, and by the 1980s, she became its bartender, landlady, and proprietress.\n\nDuring the 1986–1987 school year, a Hogwarts student met with Madam Rosmerta and Rubeus Hagrid in the Three Broomsticks to inquire about their missing brother, Jacob. Rosmerta recalled Jacob often sitting quietly in the inn, writing in his notebooks, until Ministry Aurors dragged him away, leaving behind only a Black Quill. She agreed to search the backroom for it, while asking them to help with errands. They nearly spilled a mug of Butterbeer, but a wizard transfigured into a mongoose saved it. Rosmerta also tasked the student with gathering Sugar Shrub, Mallowsweet, and Moondew from Hogwarts to brew extra-sweet Butterbeer. Afterward, she found a notebook, but Argus Filch confiscated it on Professor Snape's orders, as it contained information on the Cursed Vaults.[9]\n\nLater that year, Rosmerta thanked Jacob's sibling for their help and asked them to fetch vintage 1707 Butterbeer for Bilton Bilmes at Zonko's Joke Shop. While she retrieved it, they minded customers for her.[10]\n\nThey also joined Hagrid in approaching Mundungus Fletcher at the inn, asking him to attend a gathering for Albus Dumbledore. Broke, Mundungus made them sell his wares to patrons before agreeing to come.[11]\n\nDuring the 1987–1988 school year, Jacob's sibling met Tulip Karasu and Bill Weasley to plan entering the Forbidden Forest, enlarging their Butterbeers with the Engorgement Charm. They were soon joined by Charlie Weasley[12] and later discussed the forest exploration over Butterbeer, again using the Engorgement Charm.[13] They met friends at the inn to persuade them to enter the forest and plan the expedition.[14][15][16]\n\nJacob's sibling also fetched lavender on Professor Snape's orders to spy on Patricia Rakepick, informing Rubeus Hagrid at the inn. Rosmerta was later confronted by Rakepick about Jacob's notebook and map. She claimed ignorance and threatened to report Rakepick to her top contacts in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, forcing the Curse-Breaker to back down. Rosmerta warned her not to return to the inn.[17]\n\nOn his sixteenth birthday, Jae Kim planned three birthday rituals: drinking Butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks Inn, eating a cake, and visiting Knockturn Alley for a gift. When the inn was closed due to a wand explosion, he was disappointed. Badeea Ali and Jacob's sibling surprised him with a painting of the inn, and once returned, Jae celebrated with his friends.[18]\n\nIn February 1989, around Valentine's Day, students celebrated at the inn with Butterbeer after the Hogwarts Express Railway Authority love essay competition, with Millicent Bagnold declaring Jacob's sibling the winner.[19]\n\nThat year, Patricia Rakepick tied up Mundungus Fletcher in the inn so he could speak to Jacob's sibling, agreeing to help locate the Marauder's Map in exchange for items.[20] Jacob's sibling later practiced Legilimency Spell on Madam Rosmerta, learning that their brother Jacob was also a Legilimens.[21] Later, Jacob's sibling met Charlie Weasley at the inn to discuss dragons.[22] At the end of the year, a farewell party for Bill Weasley was held at the inn to celebrate his Hogwarts graduation.[23]\n\nAt the start of the 1989–1990 school year, Jacob's sibling met Penny Haywood in the inn to discuss troubles with her sister Beatrice.[24]\n\nSoon after, Jacob's sibling met Charlie Weasley at the inn to discuss her meeting with Torvus. Charlie was troubled by Patricia Rakepick's betrayal and considered leaving Hogwarts for the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary, but Jacob's sibling convinced him to stay, cheering him up.[25]\n\nLater, Jacob's sibling caught up with Penny Haywood in the inn and asked her to brew a love potion, which she agreed to.[26] At the end of the year, a Hogwarts party was held at the inn, organised by students to celebrate school life, with the Weird Sisters performing and many staff and students attending.[27]\n\nAt the start of the 1990–1991 school year, Jacob's sibling and Nymphadora Tonks asked Rosmerta for permission to use the inn's fireplace to access the British Ministry of Magic via the Floo Network, which she approved.[28] That year, Jacob's sibling also met Corey Hayden for a drink of Butterbeer to discuss recent events.[29]\n\nThe Circle of Khanna held a support party at the inn for the hospitalised Jacob, showing his sibling they were not alone, and later celebrated the conviction of Kazuhiro Shiratori with Butterbeer.[30][31]\n\nJacob's sibling had multiple dinners at the inn with their father Peregrine, discussing family matters, 'R's plans, and lost time. Peregrine invited both children to further dinners, revealing \"R\"'s attempt to control corrupt Ministry officials and asking Jacob's sibling to join, which they refused. Peregrine also met the Circle of Khanna without Jacob's sibling, and later dismissed their warning about Dai Ryusaki's cursed amulet.[32][33][34][35][36]\n\nIn the 1993–1994 school year, Harry Potter and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger enjoyed drinking Butterbeer at the inn, where they frequently encountered Rubeus Hagrid and other regulars as well. During the school year, Harry was unable to go to Hogsmeade because of the events surrounding Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban.\n\nHowever, Harry sneaked into Hogsmeade to have Butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks with Ron and Hermione. There they overheard a group of Hogwarts professors talking with Cornelius Fudge about Sirius Black, thus unknowingly revealing to Harry the secret that Sirius was his godfather while Harry hid under their table to avoid being seen.[1]\n\nDuring this school year, owing to the escape of Sirius Black from Azkaban, a number of Dementors were assigned to patrol Hogsmeade Village. This caused a certain amount of trouble for Madam Rosmerta, as it discouraged visitors due to the grim atmosphere that followed the Dementors.[1]\n\nDuring the 1994–1995 school year, it was in this pub that Harry was invited by Hagrid to come and see the dragons that will make up the first task of the Triwizard Tournament; at the same time, it was learned that Alastor Moody's magical eye could see through Harry's Invisibility Cloak.[37]\n\nLater in the same year, Harry was offered information on beating the second task by Ludo Bagman, which he refused, and Hermione told off Rita Skeeter,[38] an action that resulted in Rita writing a scurrilous story for Witch Weekly about Hermione.[39]\n\nDuring the 1995–1996 school year, Harry's fifth year, needing a place to meet with other students who would later form Dumbledore's Army, Hermione chose to meet at the Hog's Head, rather than the Three Broomsticks, believing it would provide more privacy.[40] This hope proved illusory, which may be why Hermione chose the Three Broomsticks for a later meeting with Harry, Luna Lovegood, and Rita Skeeter.\n\nAt this meeting, Harry talked briefly with a morose Hagrid, who was thinking about his family, then was interviewed by Rita for The Quibbler about his experience the previous year when Voldemort had returned; the main wizarding newspaper, the Daily Prophet, was heavily influenced by the Ministry of Magic and refused to print the truth about Voldemort's return.[41]\n\nWhilst Harry, Hermione, and Ron did visit the Three Broomsticks in the 1996–1997 school year, Harry's sixth year, it was a cheerless visit, as it culminated in the trio seeing Katie Bell being cursed by a package she had apparently received there.[42] Katie almost died and had to be taken to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, as a result Hogsmeade weekends are cancelled for the rest of the year.[43]\n\nHarry did pass the Three Broomsticks later in the year, with Professor Dumbledore, but they did not enter: Dumbledore told Madam Rosmerta that he fancied a quieter drink, and headed towards the Hog's Head.[44] Returning from that trip, which had been cover for retrieval of one of Voldemort's Horcruxes from a mysterious cave, Harry and a greatly weakened Dumbledore return to Hogsmeade, where they were met by Madam Rosmerta who warned them of the Dark Mark floating over Hogwarts. She lent them two brooms, and Harry and Dumbledore flew to the school, where the Battle of the Astronomy Tower soon began.[45]\n\nIt turned out that Harry's suspicions were right and Draco Malfoy, who had become a Death Eater, had been given the mission of killing Dumbledore by Voldemort himself. Malfoy had placed Madam Rosmerta under the Imperius Curse, and thus had been aware of Dumbledore's absences. It had been Madam Rosmerta, under Draco's control, who had given the cursed necklace to Katie Bell earlier in the year.[45]\n\nHarry, Ron and Hermione did not attend Hogwarts for their seventh year in the 1997–1998 school year, but they did return there to hunt down a final Horcrux. Apparating into Hogsmeade, Harry, Ron and Hermione triggered the Caterwauling Charm, bringing Death Eaters out of the Three Broomsticks. Luckily, they were given sanctuary from Aberforth Dumbledore, the barman of the Hog's Head and Albus Dumbledore's brother.[46]\n\nIn December 2010, Rosmerta caught Renka Rabblehauser trying to put anti-werewolf posters up in the pub. She told her to take it down and leave. Renka tried to argue with her but she begrudgingly left after Aberforth Dumbledore, who was having a drink in the pub, also told her to get out. When she left, Rosmerta offered everyone in the pub a drink on the house. A student and their friends, including Abigail Grey, overheard and decided to ask the other customers about Renka.[47] That night, a thief tried to enter the Three Broomsticks. The student talked to Rosmerta outside the next day when she was fixing the damage the thief caused with Mending Charms. She told them it was the second time the pub had been hit.[48]",
