  "content": "Malfoy Manor was the home of the wealthy pure-blood Malfoy family, located in Wiltshire,[1] England. It was mainly used as the base of operations for Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters during the Second Wizarding War, much to the immense discomfort of Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco Malfoy.[2]\n\nLike many other progenitors of noble English families, the wizard Armand Malfoy arrived in Britain with William the Conqueror as part of the invading Norman army. Having rendered unknown, shady, (and almost certainly magical) services to King William the Conqueror, Malfoy was given a prime piece of land in Wiltshire, seized from local landowners, upon which his descendants lived for ten consecutive centuries.[4]\n\nOver hundreds of years, they managed to add to their lands in Wiltshire by annexing those of neighbouring Muggles, and the favour they curried with royalty added Muggle treasures and works of art to an ever-expanding collection. This expansion ceased when the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was passed, in which the Malfoys hotly denied any connections with Muggles to uphold their position of influence in the newly formed Ministry of Magic.[4]\n\nFollowing Harry Potter's survival of his duel with the Dark Lord after the latter returned to power and prior to his arrest after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Lucius would hold meetings with his fellow Death Eaters over the summer at his home. During these meetings, they discussed the Rebirth of Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter's survival of the duel with the Dark Lord, and the likely explanations for the odd reactions of their wands. However, Lucius' son Draco would grow increasingly (and secretly) envious of his school rival for being discussed seriously as an adversary, whereas he himself was still seen as a mere schoolboy by Death Eaters who met at his parents’ house.\n\nBy the summer of 1997, Lucius Malfoy and many other Death Eaters had escaped Azkaban prison, and the Dark Lord had made the Malfoys' home his headquarters, replacing the Riddle House in Little Hangleton. While the Malfoys were very uncomfortable with this, Bellatrix Lestrange, Lucius's sister-in-law, who also resided there, claimed there could be \"no higher pleasure\" than having Lord Voldemort stay with them.[2] Delphini, the daughter of The Dark Lord and Bellatrix, reported that she was born at the Manor.[5]\n\nShortly before Harry Potter's seventeenth birthday, Death Eaters Yaxley and Severus Snape entered the Manor to bring news of how the Ministry of Magic was being infiltrated and of the activities of the Order of the Phoenix, respectively. The resulting plans would lead to Voldemort's take-over of the Ministry using the puppet Minister for Magic Pius Thicknesse, and to the Battle of the Seven Potters. At this meeting, Voldemort also killed Charity Burbage, the professor of Muggle Studies at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and fed her to his snake Nagini.[2]\n\nIn 1998, the Manor was used to hold some prisoners of Lord Voldemort, such as Garrick Ollivander, Luna Lovegood, Griphook, and Dean Thomas.[6]\n\nWhen Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger were caught by a group of Snatchers led by Fenrir Greyback around Easter of that year, they were brought to Malfoy Manor so that one of the Death Eaters residing there could signal Voldemort with the Dark Mark. However, Bellatrix spotted the Sword of Gryffindor among the prisoners' possessions and delayed calling the Dark Lord.\n\nInstead, she interrogated and tortured Hermione with the Cruciatus Curse to try to find out how the trio had obtained the Sword, which she believed to be in her vault at Gringotts. Bellatrix also threatened to kill Hermione with her knife when Harry and Ron came in with wands they had stolen. All the prisoners managed to escape with the assistance of the house-elf Dobby.[6]\n\nAfter the Battle of Hogwarts and Lord Voldemort's defeat, the Manor was once more in the control of the Malfoys. At some point the estate became home to Draco Malfoy and his wife, Astoria, along with their son, Scorpius Malfoy.[4] Following the conclusion of the Second Wizarding War, two portraits had been added to the family's gallery[7] that depicted the late Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange which still hung in the manor by the end of the Calamity in December of 2021.[8]\n\nThe gravel driveway to the manor house was wide and had a large hedge curving alongside it. The driveway and hedge went past a pair of wrought-iron gates. These gates permitted select individuals (those who made some sort of salute) to pass through them as if they were smoke, and with others the iron contorted into a face which demanded the purpose of the person trying to enter the manor.\n\nThe yew hedge was known to have albino peacocks roving along the top of it. The outside of the manor was grand and the land surrounding it was vast, filling many acres. Those acres contained numerous types of trees and various plant and perhaps other animal life.[2] Exiting the hall, there was a fountain in the garden.[9]\n\nMalfoy Manor was a \"handsome manor house\" surrounded by elaborate gardens, including a fountain. The front door swung inward at the approach of a person (or perhaps just a select group of people) without anyone visibly opening it.[2]\n\nThe hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent carpet covering the stone floor. The walls of the entrance hall displayed pale-faced portraits lining the walls, and at the end of the hall was the bronze-handled door to the drawing room.[2]\n\nThe drawing room was a widely proportioned room. Probably the grandest room of the house, it had ceilings 30 feet high, two chandeliers, and a pipe organ at one end. It had a long ornate table, where the Death Eaters and Voldemort sat during their meeting. Also, during the Death Eater Meeting, the usual furniture was pushed carelessly up against the walls.[2]\n\nThe drawing room had a handsome, ornate marble mantelpiece with a gilded mirror which had an intricately scrolled frame on top. Many of the known activities of the Death Eaters took place in the drawing room, which had dark purple walls with more portraits, and a large crystal chandelier, which was eventually destroyed by Dobby during the escape of several prisoners.[6] It was probably restored (by magic) to where it was previously hung.\n\nThese prisoners had all been held in the secret room below the drawing room.[6] According to Draco Malfoy, the family's collection of Dark artefacts were hidden below ground level in this room so as to prevent any from being seized during Ministry raids, one such raid having been conducted in December 1992.[10]\n\nDuring Lord Voldemort's stay in the manor, the function of this room changed to that of a holding cell for the aforementioned prisoners. This room was completely escape-proof and had no light; only house-elves could bypass the room's securities. It had nothing in it except a water jug, a food bowl and a nail.[6]\n\nThe Malfoy family home featured other rooms as well, such as a room with a chair and a candelabra, a bedroom in one of its towers, a kitchen, a room featuring a pipe organ, and a bathroom.[11] Draco Malfoy's room featured a phoenix feather duvet.[12]",
