  "content": "The Forbidden Forest,[1] also known as the Dark Forest,[12][13][14] was a forest that bordered the edges of the grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[1] The forest spanned a considerable area, and was even considered part of the Scottish Highlands.[15]\n\nAs the forest's name suggests, it was strictly off limits to students — except in the case of detention,[1] or Care of Magical Creatures lessons that occasionally took place there.[10] Of course, with the various dangerous creatures living in the Forest, few students would even want to venture into it.\n\nDescribed by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn as \"massive\",[16] the forest was thick with trees, such as beech,[17] oak,[1][2][18] pine,[3] sycamore,[2] and yew,[10] as well as undergrowth such as knotgrass and thorns,[3] but there were paths, brooks, and clearings throughout the forest as well.  Off the path, the way was almost impassable, although people had moved through it and creatures as large as Acromantulas and a Ford Anglia had managed to get around.[2] There were areas around the edges of the forest that were part of the Hogwarts grounds, but which were out of sight of the castle. Hagrid set up a paddock for Hippogriffs in an area like this[7] and the dragons which had been brought in for the first task were confined here.[19]\n\nIt was not entirely contained within the boundaries of the school itself, however, as Bartemius Crouch Senior was able to enter the grounds by foot by way of the Forbidden Forest from somewhere outside of it.[20] Patricia Rakepick, who had lured one of the students at the school and attacked them and their friends, was also able to flee the scene of the crime by Disapparating following the murder of Rowan Khanna,[21] showing that if one went deep enough into the forest, one would eventually end up outside the school grounds and the boundaries of the spells protecting it.[22]\n\nIt was hard to navigate the Forest at night, as there were tree roots and stumps that were barely visible in near blackness. Also, clothes were known to snag on low-slung branches and brambles. The forest was home to a wide and strange assortment of creatures. Anything wild and dangerous that needed a place to live was put there. The hut of gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid was located at the edge of the Forbidden Forest.[23] Black flowers were also known to grow in the forest, along with Bubotubers.[24] There were, furthermore, ruins of a castle in the forest near the edge of the Hogwarts grounds.[25]\n\nDating back to somewhere between the First millennium A.D.[26] and the 19th century,[27] according to the Wizarding Examinations Authority's Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test, the Forbidden Forest may have started out as a small wood tended by a herd of centaurs.[28] Over the centuries since the school's inception, more than a few students had disappeared in the forest.[29]\n\nAs a sizable portion of the forest fell within the boundaries of the Hogwarts grounds, the groundskeeper at the school would sometimes have to attend to matters in the Forbidden Forest as part of their job. Over the centuries since the school's inception, more than a few students had disappeared in the forest.[29] Throughout his teaching career, former Care of Magical Creatures Professor Silvanus Kettleburn spent quite a bit of time exploring the Dark Forest, which may have accounted for some of his injuries.[16]\n\nAt some point during her magical education, Patricia Rakepick asked Professor Kettleburn about the easiest way to enter the forest undetected in order to study the magical creatures dwelling there in the hopes of learning enough about them to become a Magizoologist, which he against his better judgement explained to her. Upon learning how to enter the woods undetected, she allegedly spent as much time in there as she did in the school herself, though Professor Kettleburn later came to suspect she had ulterior motives to enter the forest.[30]\n\nAt some point during the mid- to late 1970s or quite possibly the dawn of the 1980s, a sleepwalking curse was unleashed when someone unwisely disturbed the Forest Vault, one of the five fabled Cursed Vaults of Hogwarts. This caused a number of students to sleepwalk into the forest, where some were gravely injured and even killed by the creatures living in there. Around this time, a student by the name of Jacob entered the forest hoping to break this curse, soliciting the aid of the Centaur Torvus.\n\nIn order to open the vault so he could break the curse, the pupil's research indicated that a specific jewel encrusted arrowhead was required. The arrow being a precious heirloom, the Centaur refused to hand it over to a human, prompting Jacob to use magic to steal it from their camp. He was expelled from Hogwarts before it could be returned where it belonged.[31]\n\nAt the start of the 1987–1988 school year, someone once again tampered with the Forest Vault,[29] prompting Jacob's younger sibling to locate and break the curse, just as their brother had tried to do. Distrusting of humans following Jacob's thievery, which lead to his own banishment from the herd for trying to help a human, Torvus challenged Jacob's sibling and his companions to a duel, and ultimately agreed to help them look into the future if Jacob's sibling could find the head of his arrow.[31]\n\nThe Forest appeared to hold some great interest for Fred and George Weasley, as both Rubeus Hagrid,[23] and less overtly, Albus Dumbledore, indicated that considerable efforts had been made in the past to keep the boys out.[32]\n\nDuring the 1989–1990 school year, Jacob's sibling, Rowan Khanna, Ben Copper and Merula Snyde ventured into the forest, hoping to intercept a meeting between Jacob and the insidious organisation known as R. They found an opal necklace in the forest, which Merula realised was a belonging of Patricia Rakepick, a Dark witch. They were then quickly surrounded by many Dementors, and they failed to keep the Dementors away with their Patronuses. A lioness Patronus then appeared and banished the Dementors, and Rakepick then revealed herself as the caster of the Patronus, and stated her intention to murder them all.[21]\n\nMerula and Ben began to duel her, with Rakepick quickly incapacitating Merula and defeating Ben proficiently after he tried several spells against her. She then fired the Killing Curse at Ben, hoping to kill him, but Rowan Khanna intercepted the curse and was killed instantly, having sacrificed themselves to save their friends. Rakepick then Disapparated, leaving the three students utterly devastated with the death of their friend.[21]\n\nJacob's sibling and their friends later returned to the Forest Grove to search for clues relating to Rakepick or \"R\". However, they were ambushed by a white werewolf; Jacob's sibling fought the werewolf off with magic before Chiara Lobosca appeared in her werewolf form to chase it away.\n\nTorvus then appeared on the scene to inform that Firenze had knowledge of Sybill Trelawney's prophecy and to meet them again at the Centaur Camp once they knew about Cetus.[33]\n\nAfter a Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, Harry Potter secretly followed Severus Snape to the outskirts of the forest, where he overheard a furtive conversation about the Philosopher's Stone, in which Snape asked Professor Quirrell if he had found a way past the three-headed dog, and threatened him further.[17]\n\nAs part of their punishment for being caught out of bed at night by Minerva McGonagall, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy and Neville Longbottom were assigned to help the gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid find and rescue a badly-injured unicorn in the Forbidden Forest. They split into two parties, and Harry and Draco found the unicorn dead, surrounded by its own blood.[1]\n\nA hooded figure crawled to the corpse and drank the blood, whereupon Draco fled, screaming. The hooded figure moved towards Harry, who was knocked out by an agonising pain spreading from his scar. When Harry regained consciousness, the hooded figure had gone and a Centaur, Firenze, offered to give him a ride back to the school. Firenze told him that the hooded figure was Lord Voldemort, trying to regain strength by drinking the unicorn's blood.[1]\n\nFollowing the re-opening of the Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Ron went to visit Hagrid and ask him about his possible involvement in the last opening, 50 years earlier, as described by Tom Riddle's diary. Before they could ask, Hagrid was taken away by Lucius Malfoy and Cornelius Fudge. Before leaving his hut, he advised Harry and Ron, hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, to \"follow the spiders\"[34]\n\nA day later, at their Herbology class, Harry spotted a stream of spiders heading to the Forbidden Forest. After their class ended, Harry and Ron hurried to the Forbidden Forest, following the spiders.\n\nThe spiders eventually led them to the Forest's Acromantula colony, headed by Aragog, the \"monster\" Hagrid had been accused of setting on other students 50 years ago. Aragog explained that Hagrid is innocent, but rather than letting Harry and Ron go, he decided to keep them as dinner for his children. Mr Weasley's Ford Anglia came blasting through the layers of spiders, and rescued the boys. Remembering that Aragog had said that Salazar Slytherin's real monster had killed its last victim in a bathroom, it occurred to Harry that Moaning Myrtle was that victim.[2]\n\nAfter being in the Shrieking Shack for several hours, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Snape and Ron's rat Scabbers, who had recently been discovered to be Peter Pettigrew, left the secret passage in the Whomping Willow. Unfortunately, Lupin had forgotten to take his Wolfsbane Potion, and the full moon caused him to turn into an uncontrollable Werewolf; when Sirius Black changed to his Animagus dog form to protect the others, Pettigrew took the opportunity to turn back into Scabbers and escape. After injuring Black, Lupin fled to the Forbidden Forest.[35]\n\nLater, when Harry and Hermione rescued Buckbeak and Sirius Black by going back in time with the Time-Turner, they hid with the Hippogriff in the Forest, while their counterparts were in the Shrieking Shack.[36]\n\nThe Triwizard Tournament was held at Hogwarts during the 1994–1995 school year. For the first task, the Tournament imported four Dragons for the Champions to overcome, which were kept in the Forbidden Forest and maintained by Dragonologists, including Charles Weasley.[19]\n\nNear the end of the Triwizard Tournament, Harry and the other champions were informed that the third task would be a maze, filled with magical obstacles. Viktor Krum asked to speak to Harry alone (about his relationship with Hermione Granger), but as they moved away from the Quidditch pitch, a barely coherent Barty Crouch Snr emerged from the forest. Crouch then asked for Dumbledore.[20]\n\nHarry left to retrieve Dumbledore, but was briefly held up by Severus Snape. Upon Harry and Dumbledore's return, they found that Krum had been stunned at the edge of the forest and Crouch was nowhere to be seen.[20] Bartemius Crouch Jnr, disguised as Alastor Moody, had murdered his father and hid his body using Alastor Moody's Invisibility Cloak, having stunned Krum in the process. He later returned, transfigured the body into a bone and buried it in the forest near Hagrid's pumpkin patch.[37]\n\nHagrid's first Care of Magical Creatures lesson inspected by Professor Dolores Umbridge involved mysterious creatures called Thestrals. For this lesson, he lead his class into the forest in order to experience the Thestrals (which most of the students could not see, due to the fact the only way to see Thestrals is by seeing someone die) in their natural habitat.[10]\n\nRubeus Hagrid, along with Olympe Maxime, paid a visit to a tribe of giants in 1995, on the orders of Hogwarts Professor and Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, to try and bring the giants over as their allies in the Second Wizarding War against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Along the way, Hagrid found his half-brother, brought him back to Hogwarts, and kept him hidden deep within the Forest.[38]\n\nThroughout the year, Hagrid regularly visited his half-brother, whom he had named \"Grawp\", emerging from the Forest with suspicious injuries he refused to explain to Harry, Ron or Hermione. During the final game of the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup, Hagrid brought Harry and Hermione into the forest and revealed Grawp to them, asking them to keep him company in the inevitable event that Dolores Umbridge should force Hagrid off school grounds.[3]\n\nIn 1996, Harry received a false vision that Sirius Black was being held and tortured by Lord Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries. When Harry desperately attempted to contact Sirius at 12 Grimmauld Place via the Floo Network in Umbridge's office fireplace, he was caught. As she was about to use the Cruciatus Curse to force Harry to reveal exactly what he'd been trying to do, Hermione claimed that Dumbledore had hidden a powerful weapon in the Forbidden Forest.[39]\n\nHermione lead Harry and Umbridge into the forest where they encountered a heard of centaurs. Umbridge foolishly insulted them, and an angry centaur picked Umbridge up and carried her off screaming into the woods. Hermione and Harry were able to escape the centaur's anger, which had turned to them for bringing Umbridge into the forest in the first place, amidst the chaos caused by Hagrid's giant half-brother, Grawp, crashing onto the scene. This event is known as the skirmish in the Forbidden Forest.[40]\n\nIn February 1997, as Hagrid was coming out of the forest one day, he overheard Professors Snape and Dumbledore arguing over something that involved Snape not wanting to do something any more. However, Dumbledore argued that he had promised to do whatever it was, and that was that.[41] Harry later found out the task Snape did not want to do anymore involved a promise he made to Dumbledore to fulfil the task assigned by Lord Voldemort for Draco Malfoy to kill Dumbledore.[42]\n\nTowards the end of 1997, while Harry, Hermione and Ron were camping out during their search for Voldemort's Horcruxes, they overheard Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Dean Thomas, the goblins Griphook and Gornuk discussing Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood getting caught trying to steal Godric Gryffindor's Sword from then-Headmaster Severus Snape's office, and being forced to serve detention with Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest; while Griphook was under the impression that this was a \"cruel\" punishment, it was undoubtedly Snape's way of sparing the students a far worse fate at the hands of Alecto and Amycus Carrow.[43]\n\nOn 2 May 1998, a great battle occurred within the castle and on the grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The Forbidden Forest served as the temporary headquarters of Voldemort and his followers. A horde of Acromantulas emerged from the Forbidden Forest and climbed into the walls of the Hogwarts Castle, attacking both Hogwartians and Death Eaters alike, as they had been driven out of their own habitat by the Death Eaters.[44]\n\nWhen Harry later learned he had to die for Voldemort to regain mortality, he headed in to the Forbidden Forest and, using the Resurrection Stone, called his parents, James and Lily, his godfather, Sirius Black, and his close friend, Remus Lupin, to give him the strength to face Voldemort for what he believed would be the last time.[45]\n\nHarry dropped the Resurrection Stone near the Acromantulas' hollow in the Forest, and he had no desire to ever go looking for it. Harry approached Voldemort with every intention to die, not defending himself when Voldemort struck him with the Killing Curse. After being hit by the curse, he was temporarily in limbo, but woke up on the forest floor. The stone was pressed into the ground by the hoof of one of the centaurs who joined the battle against the Death Eaters, and thereafter became buried, likely never to be found again.[45][46]\n\nIn the 2010s, the Forest was affected by the Calamity, and several beasts and plants were whisked away from their proper place and transported to elsewhere in the world. These included Buckbeak, Unicorns, Acromantulas, Salamanders, Snargaluffs and tree stumps, Rubeus Hagrid asked members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force for help returning them.[47]\n\nThe Forbidden Forest housed or had housed any number of magical creatures.
