  "content": "The Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and draughty, because none of the windows had glass in them. The lack of glass in the windows allowed the owls to come and go freely. The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles (rodents that are fed upon by owls) that rose right up to the top of the tower.[1] During the winter months, the room was very cold, to the point that one had to be careful with ice on the higher landings.[2]\n\nTalbott Winger spent in the Owlery during his time at Hogwarts. In the 1989–1990 school year, Jacob's sibling came to the Owlery to look for a white owl, and they searched together with Talbott. However, they were unable to find a white owl.[3]\n\nLater that school year, Talbott managed to spot a white eagle owl, but it flew away as soon as Talbott entered the Owlery. When it flew away, it dropped the letters it was carrying. Talbott told Penny Haywood about this, and she informed Jacob's sibling he wanted to see them in the Owlery. Jacob's sibling and Talbott looked through the letters dropped by the owl. One letter stood out as Talbott suspected it was written in Japanese, which made Jacob's sibling suspect it was to or from a Dark wizard who attempted to kill them.[4]\n\nIn 1995, Harry encountered Cho Chang in the Owlery at the beginning of his fifth year. She was sending a letter to her mother, and defended him against the suspicions of Argus Filch the caretaker at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\nDuring the Second Wizarding War, students and staff stopped using the Owlery for sending post to other people inside the Castle, because any letters that were sent using the Owlery were checked by Argus Filch. Thus, letters were passed via other students to protect privacy.\n\nIn 1998, Mrs Norris was seen chasing owls in the Owlery, during the Battle of Hogwarts.[5]",
