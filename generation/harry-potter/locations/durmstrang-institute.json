  "content": "Durmstrang Institute (Cyrillic: Дурмстранг) was one of the three largest wizarding schools in Europe (the other two being Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Beauxbatons Academy of Magic). Located in the far north of the continent,[1][2] the school was willing to accept international students from as far afield as Bulgaria.\n\nHaving existed since at least 1294,[5] Durmstrang was one of the three schools that competed in the Triwizard Tournament,[5] and was notorious for prominently featuring the Dark Arts in its curriculum.[6]\n\nDurmstrang only admitted pure-bloods,[7] but individual students didn't necessarily share this prejudice. In the 1986–1987 school year the student Pieter Talli visited Hogwarts and was shown that Muggle-borns were greatly different to what he had grown up thinking. Also, during the 1994–1995 Triwizard Tournament, Viktor Krum attended the Yule Ball with Hermione Granger,[8] who was Muggle-born and would not have been admitted at Durmstrang.\n\nDurmstrang, much like Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was a castle, though Durmstrang Castle was not quite as big as Hogwarts Castle. The castle was four storeys tall, and fires were only lit for magical purposes. It had very extensive grounds however, larger than Hogwarts, and was surrounded by lakes and mountains.[8]\n\nThe school was unplottable; Durmstrang concealed its whereabouts from plain sight. The institute was said to be situated in the far north of Europe.[6]\n\nDurmstrang was founded during the Middle Ages by the great Bulgarian witch Nerida Vulchanova, who served as the first head of the school. She was succeeded after her mysterious death by Professor Harfang Munter, who established Durmstrang's reputation for emphasising martial magic and duelling as an impressive part of its curriculum.[3]\n\nAround 1294, the Triwizard Tournament was established as a friendly competition between Durmstrang Institute, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.[5] But in 1792, a Cockatrice went on a rampage and injured the Heads of all the schools.[4] The Triwizard Tournament was then suspended indefinitely, only restarting in 1994.[5]\n\nIn the 1880s or 1890s, Gellert Grindelwald was accepted into Durmstrang Institute. Although the school was oriented towards the Dark Arts, Grindelwald's experiments in dark magic were considered too dangerous for the students. After a certain amount of time, Durmstrang could no longer ignore Grindelwald's dangerous studies, and expelled him.[9]\n\nBefore Grindelwald was expelled, he carved the calling card of his obsession, the mark of the Deathly Hallows, on a wall of the school; this mark stayed there long after his defeat, so, considering the opposition to Grindelwald in the school, it can be assumed he magically embued the mark so that it could not be removed.[10] Grindelwald was marked as the best student in the school's history.[9]\n\nAt some point after 1981, Igor Karkaroff, after being acquitted as a Death Eater by betraying information to the British Ministry of Magic,[11] rose to the position of Headmaster of Durmstrang and became immensely unpopular in this position, and several students were removed from the school by their parents for his ruthlessness. He insisted on an environment ruled by fear and intimidation from his students, leading many to view him as egotistical and unprincipled.[3] During his time as the school administrator, some students copied Grindelwald's symbol onto their books and bags to impress others, but were later \"taught better\" by those who lost family members to the Dark wizard, including Viktor Krum.[10]\n\nThe Durmstrang delegation arrived at Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament by ship, an enormous vessel in which they slept during their stay in Scotland.[4] The Durmstrang students sat at the Slytherin table during their meals in the Great Hall.[12]\n\nBulgarian Quidditch Seeker, Viktor Krum, attended Durmstrang, and was still in school during the 1994 Quidditch World Cup. That same year, the school participated in the recommenced Triwizard Tournament. Karkaroff brought twelve students with him to Hogwarts to put their name into the Goblet of Fire.[4] However, it was Krum who was chosen as the Durmstrang representative.[12] Karkaroff full-heartedly supported Krum with tremendous amounts of bias, both as a judge towards the champions and as headmaster to the students.[4][13][14]\n\nAs Krum was a celebrity, he was often followed by Draco Malfoy and other students who wanted autographs and the prestige of being close with him.[12] Krum mostly ignored these advances, but formed a close friendship with Hermione Granger, who was a Gryffindor student.[8] They continued communication after the Tournament through letters.\n\nKarkaroff fled after Lord Voldemort rose again. It is not known who took over, or whether the school's reputation improved or worsened due to this. However, none of the students appeared to be too concerned by this, as Karkaroff was unpopular among the school, especially when he had his students row the ship while he rested in the cabin during their arrival.[15]\n\nDurmstrang was an excellent school for those who were not a fan of the academic, this school was known for embracing the more physical side of wizardry, such as duelling and martial magic.[16] It was notorious for its acceptance and practical view of the Dark Arts, and had the darkest reputation of the eleven great Wizarding schools (though this was never entirely merited).[3]\n\nDurmstrang has, at least twice in its history, fallen under the stewardship of wizards of dubious allegiance or nefarious intent; Harfang Munter, who took over the school shortly after the mysterious death of its founder, Nerida Vulchanova. Then there was the headship of Professor Igor Karkaroff, he was in the service of Lord Voldemort as a Death Eater, but managed to escape punishment in Azkaban by providing the Ministry of Magic with the names of his co-conspirators.[11] It was during Karkaroff's reign as Headmaster that the school's reputation worsened, as his insistence of letting an atmosphere of fear and intimidation rule over the school led even parents to withdraw their children from the institute.[3]\n\nThe school was also known to have educated (and later expelled) Gellert Grindelwald before his ascension as one of history's most dangerous Dark wizards.[9]\n\nIt was possible that Durmstrang students were proficient in transfiguration, as Minerva McGonagall told Neville Longbottom not to let anyone from said school see that he was unable to perform a basic Switching Spell.[4] Viktor Krum was also able to turn himself into a shark during the Second Task in the Great Lake (although badly).[14]\n\nDuring the late 20th century, the educational style of Durmstrang was very ruthless. The Professors were highly strict, not allowing the students to do anything but listen to them. Lessons were delivered in a dull lecture-style, with students not allowed to take notes and expected to memorise the Professor's words. When learning spells, no wandwork was allowed in classes. Students were expected to grasp the theory within the class itself and students weren't dismissed until a pop-quiz had been taken.[7]\n\nThe teaching style of the Professors hadn't changed for decades. The Charms Professor at Durmstrang had been teaching for several decades by the 1980s, with his classes not changing in style since he started.[7]\n\nFrequently, when teaching spells like the Fire-Making Spell, students were only taught how to produce the most intense effects with the spell, without learning the finer points of wandwork.\n\nFailure wasn't tolerated at Durmstrang. Students who weren't able to keep up were left behind. As such, students often pushed themselves beyond safe limits, something which was encouraged by the faculty. Pieter Talli, upon dropping a suit of armour, a boulder, and an armchair on himself when practising the Levitation Charm repeated the phrase \"Injury is evidence you have given your all\". Indeed, visible signs of injury were common in Durmstrang, with several students sporting scars from their time there.[7]\n\nThis was a rather stark contrast to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry; at Hogwarts, the teachers prioritised the safety and wellbeing of their students, taught the finer points of the magical arts, and (with a few notable exceptions) tried to make learning fun.\n\nPunishments at Durmstrang were often very swift, harsh, and unfair. Professors would often place entire classes in detention because one student had displeased them, usually by talking or getting a question wrong.[7]\n\nStudents were taught only the most basic of subjects necessary in order to live in the wider wizarding world. Additionally, Durmstrang was infamous for teaching its students the Dark Arts, the only known school to do so (aside from Hogwarts, which briefly taught the Dark Arts during Severus Snape's tenure as headmaster when the school and the Ministry fell under the control of Death Eaters).[6] The school turned a blind eye to students practising the Dark Arts on each other, though it had its limits as Gellert Grindelwald was expelled for performing experiments on other students.[17]\n\nThe students at the school wore fur cloaks, fur hats, and blood-red robes.[4]",
