  "content": "Hogsmeade Village, or simply called Hogsmeade, was an all-wizarding village in the Scottish Highlands. It was founded by Hengist of Woodcroft. Hogsmeade was a picturesque little village of cottages and shops, with enchanted candles hanging in the trees during the holidays. It was also near the location of the train station used by the Hogwarts Express.\n\nSince before 1714 (when the 1714 Edict was passed), Hogwarts third-years and above had been permitted weekend trips into the village. By the late 20th century, it had become the only all-wizarding village in Britain.[1] Mainly, students frequented the High Street in the village, which contained the named speciality shops and pubs such as Zonko's Joke Shop and Honeydukes. Otherwise, they wandered on to observe the infamous Shrieking Shack.\n\nThe entrance to Hogsmeade was through the archway beyond Hogsmeade Entrance Bridge, which crossed a river (likely Rivers Edge or the one encircling the village) from the road leading from Hogwarts Castle. Other accessible ways included Apparition and other magical means of transportation.\n\nThe use of magic in Hogsmeade was regulated by certain unspecified spell limits.[2]\n\nAccording to tradition, Hogsmeade was founded in the 10th or 11th century, around the same time as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, by medieval wizard Hengist of Woodcroft as he was fleeing persecution by Muggles.[3][4] A sign over Hogsmeade identified its year of establishment as 914, though this is anachronistic as Hengist of Woodcroft was not yet alive in that year.[5][3]\n\nIn 1612, a goblin rebellion took place in the vicinity of the village. Hogsmeade served as the wizards' headquarters during the rebellion.[6][7]\n\nOn the 2 September 1890, Victor Rookwood and Ranrok unleashed two trolls which launched an attack on Hogsmeade. They damaged several buildings including shops. While villagers tried to stop them, a new student of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry intervened and took down one of the trolls.[5]\n\nIn November 1926, the Daily Prophet reported that Hogsmeade would play host to the first ever Magical Waterplants Festival.[8]\n\nSometime in the 1930s, Newton Scamander and his brother, Theseus travelled to Hogsmeade to visit Aberforth Dumbledore, looking for Albus Dumbledore. Aberforth told them that's his brother, and Albus came and told Theseus about how he needed to trust him to the fullest amount or else \"everything will become undone\". They moved towards a nearby window and Albus showed Theseus his blood pact.[9]\n\nAt some point in the village's history, it was acknowledged that some of its residents had a tendency to be particularly prone to accidents and injury, to the point where these unlucky locals were being consolationally awarded for their trouble. As of the 1987–1988 school year, one of its inhabitants, a former Care of Magical Creatures Professor at the nearby Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Silvanus Kettleburn, had received the Hogsmeade's Most Maimed Award ten years in a row.[10]\n\nAround Hallowe'en in 1984 an army of charmed skeletons descended upon the town looking for Jacob's sibling and Ismelda Murk, however they were driven off by Pumpkin Johnny.[11]\n\nDuring this school year, a festival was held in Hogsmeade.[12]\n\nHarry Potter's first visit to the village (outside the train station) occurred during the winter of 1993. Because he ran away from his guardians, the Dursleys, he was unable to acquire permission to go, and he visited with the aid of the Marauder's Map. While he managed to sneak around without being seen the first time,[13] after a close call, Harry used his Invisibility Cloak for his second trip.[14]\n\nAfter an incident that occurred during Harry's second trip to the village, Remus Lupin had to cover for him when Professor Snape questioned him about Draco Malfoy's report that he had seen Harry in Hogsmeade (when the hood of the cloak fell off of Harry's head). Lupin confiscated the Marauder's Map afterwards. The confiscation of the map ended Harry's chances of making any more secret trips for the remainder of the school year. Lupin also made Harry rethink his decision of ever journeying to the village.\n\nNeville Longbottom later lost his visitation rights for the remainder of the school year after Sirius Black had used the passwords to Gryffindor Tower which Neville wrote down (that were stolen by Hermione Granger's cat Crookshanks and given to Sirius Black). Later, Sirius, as Harry's godfather, gave written permission for Harry to visit the village.[1]\n\nHarry, along with Hermione and Ron, went to visit Sirius Black and Buckbeak in one of the caves in the mountains on the outskirts of Hogsmeade. There, they discussed the strange occurrences surrounding Harry's entrance in the Triwizard Tournament.\n\nIn the winter of 1995, a group of Hogwarts students that were unhappy about the recent Ministry interference at Hogwarts, formed Dumbledore's Army. Dumbledore´s Army (D.A.) was an illegal organisation that centred around Harry Potter teaching other students defensive and offensive magic. The first meeting was held in the Hog's Head pub. This is the first time any of the trio had been inside the dingy pub, Ron sarcastically commented on how lovely it was.\n\nHermione thought that the group would be safer at a more secluded spot, rather then one filled with numerous people. Sirius Black however debased this notion, the fact that if the pub they held their meeting in had heavier traffic flow then less chances of being overheard. Mundungus Fletcher was present in the pub and told the Order everything he overheard.\n\nOn Valentine's Day in 1996, Harry Potter and Cho Chang had a cup of coffee at Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop, and sat by Roger Davies and his girlfriend. Their date, however, turned out nightmarishly wrong; Harry already felt highly uncomfortable the moment he set eyes on the café's insides, as the decors reminded him of Umbridge's office and the intimate couples all around them made it even more awkward.\n\nIt only got worse when Cho started talking about Cedric, which made her cry, and when Harry mentioned (in a way that led to misunderstandings) Hermione Granger she became jealous and left dramatically, to the astonishment of the whole tearoom who stopped to watch them. Harry swiftly paid for the coffee and chased after her, but she had already disappeared from the street.[15] The experience left Harry a negative impression on the place, as he referred to it as a \"stupid teashop\" when reliving this disaster with Hermione.[16]\n\nHarry's visitation rights for Hogsmeade were later revoked by Dolores Umbridge as punishment for illegally distributing his interview in The Quibbler, but was lifted at the end of the year following Umbridge's removal from the school.\n\nThe first and only Hogsmeade trip of the school year was miserable, due to the extreme cold and bitter wind. Harry thought more than once that he, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley might have had more fun in the warm Gryffindor Common Room. The trio briefly took shelter in Honeydukes, where Harry had a short conversation with Professor Slughorn. After leaving the sweetshop, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked through a brick walled passage to get to the Three Broomsticks Inn for butterbeer.[17][18]\n\nWhile outside the Three Broomstick the trio had a run in with Mundungus Fletcher. Harry caught Fletcher red-handed selling Black family silver to the bartender of the Hog's Head, which had been stolen from Sirius' house; these items and the entire residence at 12 Grimmauld Place were left to Harry in Sirius' will. This enraged Harry and he confronted Mundungus using physical force before Mundungus Disapparated and went into hiding.[19]\n\nDuring this time, Madam Rosmerta was put under the Imperius Curse and through her, Katie Bell was also placed under the same curse in order to smuggle the opal necklace into Hogwarts in a plot to kill Professor Albus Dumbledore, attempted by Draco Malfoy.[18] As a result of this near-death experience, Katie was moved to St Mungo's and her recovery lasted months. Because of this incident all school trips to Hogsmeade were cancelled for the rest of the year.\n\nDeciding to look for the next of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes in the Death Eater-controlled Hogwarts Castle, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley Apparated into Hogsmeade village. Their arrival set off a Caterwauling Charm, alerting the Death Eaters of their arrival. As they were hidden under the invisibility cloak, the Death Eaters decided to send Dementors to find Harry.[20]\n\nThe Dementors, sensing fear, rapidly closed in, and Harry (fearing for his soul and the souls of his friends) cast a Patronus Charm to repel them. A door creaked open behind, and Aberforth waved the trio in. Aberforth then convinced the Death Eaters that he set off the alarm by letting his cat out, and it was his goat Patronus, not Harry's stag, that they actually saw.[20]\n\nHarry recognised the man as Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus's younger brother. Aberforth wanted them to escape the village the next morning, believing the Order of the Phoenix finished, Voldemort had already won the war, and those still fighting were only deluding themselves. When Harry refused, saying he must complete Dumbledore's mission, Aberforth berated Harry for following his brother, and asked if he knew the entire truth about him. Despite hearing of Dumbledore's past, Harry intended to complete Dumbledore's mission. Aberforth bowed to the inevitable and addressed Ariana's portrait, and she disappeared down a long, dark tunnel, soon returning with another figure; Neville Longbottom.[20]\n\nDuring the Battle of Hogwarts, Horace Slughorn rallied the residents of Hogsmeade to come to the aid of those fighting at Hogwarts. The Hog's Head Inn contained a secret passageway into the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts, and also served as a route for Order of the Phoenix members and supporters to enter the school to join the battle. The secret passageway also served as a means to evacuate underage students from the school.\n\nThe connection might have been broken since Vincent Crabbe unleashed Fiendfyre inside the Room of Requirement, although it is unknown if it completely destroyed the Room of Requirement or merely that particular form of it.\n\nDuring the 2009–2010 school year, a group of students in search for a mysterious map went to the Hog's Head Inn through the secret tunnel from Hogwarts to Hogsmeade to find the portrait of Harold, who knew the map was back at Hogwarts Castle and told it to them. Lottie Turner cast a Doubling Charm there to duplicate the portrait so that people wouldn't notice if the real portrait of Harold was returned to the castle. In the inn, the students also noticed their History of Magic professor, Jakub Gorski, trading with a Dark wizard. Headmistress McGonagall eventually found the students and sent them back to the school.[21]\n\nRenka owned a shop in Hogsmeade where she sold handmade house-elf figurines. It was considered creepy by some of the villagers. In September 2010, she ran out of business and closed down the shop.[22] She broke the figurines by throwing them on the ground outside and leaving the shattered pieces in the cobblestones.[23]\n\nThat year, third-year students including Daniel Page, Ivy Warrington and their friend visited Hogsmeade without breaking the rules for the first time. Headmistress McGonagall was seen there talking to Linderina Crane, likely about the Nocturnal Order of Tricks and Magical Exhibitions (NOTME). Victor Gridley staged a fireworks display which attracted Elliot Evers and three Hogwarts students, who, upon seeing each other, had a duel. Professor Longbottom arrived afterwards and he and the students saw red origami birds flying over the village, carrying a message signed by NOTME.[21]\n\nDuring this school year, Daniel, Ivy  and their friend often came to Hogsmeade to visit Victor Gridley in his caravan, who forced Daniel into completing a mission of retrieving his lost Skeleton Key from NOTME. After Daniel returned the key to him, there was a big fight in the dungeon of Gridley's caravan among Gridley himself, the students, the kidnapped Professor Longbottom and Dementors.[21]\n\nIn December, strange things started happening in Hogsmeade. A dense mist kept enveloping the village, the lights kept going on and off and there were break-ins. A Hogwarts student and their friends, Daniel and Ivy were visiting Hogsmeade when they experienced such an occurrence. Renka held werewolves responsible and started putting posters up around the village warning everyone about the dangers they posed. She also started protesting in the street, telling the people that gathered that they had to band together to drive out the beasts. While she was protesting, Abigail confronted her demanding proof. Renka replied only a beast could be causing these problems but Abigail responded that they couldn't have been doing that kind of destruction. The student supported Abigail but Renka called them naive and rude.[24]\n\nDue to the recent problems, Minerva McGonagall considered banning students from visiting Hogsmeade. However, the student and Abigail returned to investigate. They heard Renka arguing with Rosmerta in the Hog's Head who thought it would be ridiculous to have Ministry officials everywhere. Aberforth Dumbledore was also fed up of her fearmongering and claimed the village was getting fed up of her. They spoke to several villagers about the things that had been happening. One witch thought Renka was right about the werewolves, another didn't care if she was but wanted something to be done about the break-ins.[24]\n\nOne night shortly after, there was a spree of break-ins during a fog. Renka claimed she was attacked in her shop. Ambrosius Flume was hit on the head by the thief in Honeydukes and received a nasty bump. His wife found the shop and its products had been trampled on. Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop had a broken window where she discovered a pungent tuft of fur in the glass. Zonko's Joke Shop had claw marks on its exterior where someone was trying to get in, and the Three Broomsticks Inn had damage that Rosmerta fixed for the second time with Mending Charms.[25]\n\nThe next day, the student and Abigail investigated to try and prove werewolves weren't responsible like Renka was claiming during a rally in the village. However, the student had to admit it did sound like a werewolf did it because of the claw marks and tufts of fur. Abigail pointed out it was weird because there wasn't a full moon the night before and nothing was stolen other than a few potion ingredients for a Wolfsbane Potion. The student then wondered if the thief was trying to frame werewolves.[25]\n\nThe student and Abigail later learned there was a pack of werewolves living in the Hog's Head Inn but they claimed they weren't responsible and were only trying to make a home there. However, their Wolfsbane Potion was tampered with and when they turned, they dangerously walked on the streets of Hogsmeade.[26] The student and Aberforth tried to capture them but Renka interfered.[27]\n\nThe student obtained evidence that Renka was behind the break-ins and the werewolves were finally apprehended before they hurt someone.  The next day, Renka screamed at the werewolves in the village but was exposed by the student for faking the break-ins and sabotaging the Wolfsbane Potion. After she was arrested, the consensus in the village was that the werewolves tried to do the right thing with the potion. The leader of the pack, Gerard Grey, then decided that they would stay and live in Hogsmeade.[27]\n\nWithin Hogsmeade there were several communal areas where anyone could freely wander.\n\nHogsmeade and Hogwarts had a shared history, as well. There was one passage from the castle to the main entrance of Hogsmeade.[31] There were at least eight secret passages that ran between the school and Hogsmeade,[13] all but two of which were built for reasons unknown.[32][33] It is possible that some were used during major historical events, such as the 1612 goblin rebellion that centred in Hogsmeade;[6] and at least two used in the final battle to defeat Voldemort.[34]",
