  "content": "The Hog's Head Inn was a slightly disreputable inn and pub in the all-wizarding village of Hogsmeade. It was located one or two streets off of the High Street, the Hog's Head Inn was a fixture of Hogsmeade for several years. The Inn was owned and operated by Aberforth Dumbledore in the 1990s.[2] Earlier, in the 1890s, it was operated by Jasper Trout.[3]\n\nA worn-out wooden sign hung over the door, advertising with a 'wild boar's severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth around it'. It was known for its cheapness, at least relative to the Three Broomsticks down the street, and according to Albus Dumbledore, attracted an interesting clientele.[2]\n\nAccording to Hermione Granger, in Sites of Historical Sorcery it was mentioned that an inn at Hogsmeade served as human headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion.[4] It is unknown if the inn mentioned in the book was the Hog's Head Inn.\n\nOutside the tavern, there was a dock which gave access to the river. It was noted as a peaceful place to sit and relax, if one could ignore the dodgy dealings of the pub next to them.[5] There was also a sign with \"Hog's Head\" written on it, featuring the head of a hog.[6]\n\nThe bar in the Hog's Head was small and extraordinarily dirty and strewn with sawdust,[1] with the windows nearly opaque and the floor all but invisible beneath the dirt. There was an 'ancient wooden till' behind the bar that served as a cash register, and the entire room smelt strongly of 'something that might have been goats'. Even the rags behind the bar seemed filthy; at one point, as Aberforth Dumbledore continued to wipe a glass, Harry Potter noted that it seemed to be getting dirtier.[2]\n\nAbove the bar was mounted the head of a boar, which was presumably enchanted so as to seem alive. It had quite a fearsome look to it with four tusks, one of which was broken, and a scar over its left eye. There was a large amount of drool dripping out of its mouth at all times and it often rolled its eyes or snorted at patrons.[5]\n\nBehind the bar was a 'rickety wooden staircase' leading up to a sitting room, most likely an open area between the guest rooms, with a fireplace and a curtained window looking down at the street.[1] The guest rooms themselves were located above the bar,[1] and like the bar itself were not noted for being especially clean. Sybill Trelawney, for example, warned Harry against bedbugs.[7]\n\nAbove the fireplace in the upstairs sitting room was a portrait of Ariana Dumbledore.[1] Through this portrait was a secret passage, leading into the Room of Requirement in Hogwarts. This passage 'opened up' when Neville Longbottom began living in the room by the spring of 1998.[8]\n\nIn the winter of 1932, a sign was put up on the window sill of main front door which was labelled 'open' or 'closed'. It was made of dark wood with a chalk-board to draw on.[9]\n\nThe Hog's Head was known for being the kind of disreputable establishment that the shady type liked to frequent. Due to the shadiness of the place, it was somewhat a sense of fashion for the customers to keep their faces hidden, and Aberforth had never had a large number of customers inside at once prior to the recruiting meeting of Dumbledore's Army.[2]\n\nMundungus Fletcher was banned from the Hog's Head for life some years ago for an unspecified offence, however, it can be assumed that he was using the place as a venue for his dealing in questionable and stolen merchandise. Filius Flitwick confirmed to Hermione Granger that students were permitted to pay patronage to Hog's Head, though he strongly advised her to bring her own cup, as Aberforth was seen cleaning a cup with a rather dirty rag, only making it more dirty. The owner was also rather not fond of large amount of customers, as he looked irritated when about 28 students came to visit for the meeting.[2]\n\nDespite being such a run down and visually unappealing avenue, it had been the place of a fair share of remarkable events, including: the making of Harry Potter's prophecy,[10] the revelation of how to get to the Philosopher's Stone,[11] the first gathering of Dumbledore's Army,[2] and supplying rebels against Death Eaters at Hogwarts food and drink in their hideout.[1] It was also none other than the waiting place of Mulciber, Rosier, Dolohov and Nott, when Tom Riddle came to Hogsmeade requesting to secure a post with Headmaster Dumbledore.[12]\n\nA sign hung in the Hog's Head declaring that the sale of unicorn blood was forbidden and warning customers not to ask about it.[13]\n\nIn the aftermath of the Goblin Rebellion of 1612, a horn used during the rebellion was discovered behind the building with a wedge of gorgonzola stuffed inside to mute it.[14]\n\nAt one point, it was owned by Jasper Trout.[15] During the 1890–1891 school year, while drinking at the inn, Lodgok was approached by a new Hogwarts student who asked for his assistance in defeating Ranrok. Lodgok agreed to associate with the student and left the pub to lead them to retrieve the Helmet of Urtkot.[16] The same student later had the opportunity to hang the portrait of Ferdinand Octavius Pratt at the Hog's Head Inn instead of the Three Broomsticks if they so choose after retrieving the painting; in which case Jasper commented that the portrait was useful for target practice whereas Ferdinand would constantly complain about the establishment's smell.[17]\n\nSometime in 1932, Newton Scamander and his brother Theseus travelled to Hogsmeade to visit Aberforth Dumbledore, looking for Albus Dumbledore. Aberforth told them that was his brother, and Albus came and told Theseus about how he needed to trust him to the fullest amount or else 'everything will become undone'. They moved towards a nearby window and Albus showed Theseus his blood pact.[9]\n\nSometime after the meeting with Newt and Theseus, Albus Dumbledore went to the upstairs sitting room and looked at the blood pact with blood scars on his arm. At one point, Aberforth wrote 'closed' on a sign in the window of the inn while he and Albus had their sister's favourite soup in the main room.[9]\n\nWhile Albus Dumbledore was getting ready and putting on his jacket, Aberforth Dumbledore shared how his brother was once again leaving to save the world, against Gellert Grindelwald.[9]\n\nIn 1979, Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry travelled to the Hog's Head to interview an applicant for the post of Divination Professor: Sybill Trelawney. It was in the Hog's Head that Trelawney made one of her only two known actual prophecies, this one made to Albus Dumbledore himself about 'The Dark Lord and Harry Potter'.[10]\n\nAs it transpired, a Death Eater spy, revealed to be Severus Snape, was listening at the door of the private room where Trelawney and Dumbledore were having their meeting. Snape was thrown out of the building before he could hear the whole prophecy, however, he did hear enough to make the Dark Lord attack and kill Harry Potter's parents, and attempt to kill Harry when the information was conveyed to him.[10]\n\nRubeus Hagrid was known to frequent the Hog's Head. It was here that he allowed a hooded stranger to purchase him a series of drinks that intoxicated Hagrid enough to make him let slip how to get past Fluffy, Hagrid's pet three headed dog. During the same encounter, Hagrid played, and won a game of cards, earning him a prize in the form of a Norwegian Ridgeback dragon egg.[11]\n\nIt was the inn's infamously shady reputation that made Hermione Granger pick the Hog's Head as the first meeting place for Dumbledore's Army, to their detriment. Mundungus Fletcher, disguised as a witch wearing a thick black veil that fell to his toes, was spying on the proceedings under the orders of Albus Dumbledore, while Willy Widdershins, who was heavily wrapped in bandages, overheard the group planning their defence lessons, and reported it to Dolores Umbridge and Cornelius Fudge. The meeting was so peculiar for the inn's normally quiet nature that even Aberforth was apparently listening in on the meeting (though he is also a member of the Order of the Phoenix).[2]\n\nHermione had thought that meeting in such a secluded and disreputable place would lessen their chances of meeting anyone who would give them up, however, Sirius Black would later point out that having their first meeting in such a quiet place was rather unwise, and suggested that the Three Broomsticks Inn would probably have been a wiser choice for a first meeting. It was in this meeting that the foundation for Dumbledore's Army was made and each member attending signed their name on a piece of parchment to bide their loyalty.[2]\n\nFor about two weeks before the Battle of Hogwarts there was a tunnel connecting the Hog's Head to the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts. The opening to the tunnel was hidden behind a picture of Ariana Dumbledore. The tunnel was used as a means to allow people from the outside world into the Room of Requirement, which was acting as the safe haven for the reformed Dumbledore's Army. This tunnel was destroyed by Neville's grandmother Augusta Longbottom once everyone was through so no one else could use it. The Inn was also used by Death Eaters to 'traffick potions and poisons' as said by Aberforth.[1]\n\nDuring the 2009–2010 school year, a group of students in search for a mysterious map went to the Hog's Head Inn through the secret tunnel from Hogwarts to Hogsmeade to find the portrait of Harold, who knew the map was back at Hogwarts Castle and told it to them. Lottie Turner cast a Doubling Charm there to duplicate the portrait so that people wouldn't notice if the real portrait of Harold was returned to the castle. In the inn, the students also noticed their History of Magic professor, Jakub Gorski, trading with a Dark wizard. Headmistress McGonagall eventually found the students and sent them back to the school.[18]",
