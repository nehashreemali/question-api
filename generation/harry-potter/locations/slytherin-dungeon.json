  "content": "Slytherin Dungeon was a dungeon in Hogwarts Castle that served as the common room and dormitories for the students of Slytherin House at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[2] In general, it sported several shades of green and the mantle was adorned with a portrait of a serpent (all associated with the house).[1]\n\nIn Harry Potter's second year, he and Ron Weasley went into the Slytherin common room disguised as Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle with the aid of Polyjuice Potion to attempt to discover the identity of the Heir of Slytherin. The entry password was \"Pure-blood\" when Draco Malfoy let them in. The Polyjuice Potion's wearing off prompted Harry and Ron to leave after staying nearly an hour, still not finding out the identity of the Heir of Slytherin, but they did learn that Malfoy was not the heir, as they originally thought.[1]\n\nIn 1998, Harry, operating under the alias \"Vernon Dudley\", attempted to defend his false claim that he was a member of the Slytherin house by describing the location of the Dungeon to the Snatchers.[3]\n\nIn 2020, after Albus Potter's catastrophic adventures with the \"true\" Time-Turner, his father went to his dormitory to speak with him about the events.[4]\n\nThere was a door on the right side of the Entrance Hall (if coming down the Marble Staircase facing the front doors of the castle)[5] that was most frequently used by Slytherin students to get to their common room. Behind the door was a set of stone steps which descended deep into the dungeons.[1]\n\nNote that this door was different from the entrance to the narrow staircase that lead down to Snape's office.\n\nThe entrance to the common room was located behind a bare stretch of stone wall in the dungeons of Hogwarts Castle. A password was required to enter it; once spoken, the passage would be revealed.[1]\n\nThe common room was a dungeon-like room with greenish lamps and chairs. This dungeon extended partway under the lake, with three large windows on that side of the common room, providing an underwater view and giving the light in the room a green tinge. There was a grand staircase on the opposite side of the common room.[6] The common room had lots of low backed black and dark green button-tufted, leather sofas; skulls; and dark wood cupboards. It was decorated with tapestries featuring the adventures of famous Medieval Slytherins. It had quite a grand atmosphere, but also quite a cold one.[1] It is close to boys and girls' dormitories.\n\nAfter entering Slytherin Dungeon, one enters a small room with a statue of a pair of mermaids, and a staircase to the right. One can reach the Slytherin common room by going down the stairs, around an indoor waterfall.[6]\n\nThe password to the common room changed every fortnight, and was posted on the noticeboard. Slytherin students were warned never to bring students from other houses into the common room, or to reveal the password. Supposedly, no outsider had entered the common room for more than seven centuries until Harry and Ron entered it, disguised as Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle with the use of Polyjuice Potion.[7]\n\nAs of 2016, a portrait of Horace Slughorn had a place in the common room due to his bravery at the Battle of Hogwarts.[8]\n\nThe Slytherin dormitories were also located in the dungeon, the boys' dorms were located through a hallway on the left side from the grand staircase (from the perspective of someone facing the staircase). The girls' dormitories are located up the stairs through a hallway on the right side of the grand staircase. Both hallways circled back around to the common room, meaning that each one had two entrances, one by the entrance to the common room itself, and one by the grand staircase.\n\nThe doors for the dormitories each had a number plaque, designating what year the dormitory was for. They were lined up in order from First year to Sixth year. It started with the First year dormitories from the entrance near the grand staircase and ended with the Sixth year dormitories at the other end of the hall near the common room entrance.\n\nThe Seventh year dormitories were located at the top of the grand staircase. The Seventh year dorms were larger and more grand than the others.[6]",
