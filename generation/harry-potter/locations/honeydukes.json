  "content": "Honeydukes was a wizarding sweet shop located on High Street in the all-wizarding village of Hogsmeade. It was first established in 1641[1] and was owned by Ambrosius Flume and his wife, and was filled with \"shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets imaginable\".[2]\n\nIn addition to the standard wizarding candy that was sold there, the owners also made their own fudge and chocolate. For obvious reasons, the shop was quite a popular destination for Hogwarts students when visiting Hogsmeade on the weekends and during the Christmas season, one could barely move due to the crowd of visitors.[2]\n\nThe shop was run by Patrick Redding and his daughter Olivia in the 1890s.[3] By 1993, it was run by Ambrosius Flume, a rather large, bald man, and his wife, who watched over the shop when he went to the cellar to retrieve the sweets that the main shop was running out of.[2]\n\nHoneydukes also housed the entrance to a secret passageway from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry directly into the cellar of the sweet-shop; however, it was advisable only to use it to go from Hogwarts Castle to Honeydukes and not the other way around, due to the presence of a stone slide at the Hogwarts end.\n\nIn the Gunhilda of Gorsemoor Corridor on the third floor of Hogwarts Castle, one could find a large stone statue of Gunhilda. By tapping the back of the statue with one's wand and incant \"Dissendium\", one would open up the secret passageway in the statue's hunched back, leading down a short, cool stone slide.[2] They would land in a very low, very narrow earthy passageway that twisted like a rabbit's burrow, rising after an hour or so and reached a large, worn stone staircase after ten minutes of steep ascent.[2] There were over two hundred steps on this staircase, and those climbing it would usually be surprised when their head hit the hard, cold trap-door.[2] This trap-door led into the cellar of Honeydukes, and matched the dusty floor perfectly.[2]\n\nThe cellar of the shop was full of wooden crates and boxes, with a very dusty floor and a large wooden staircase leading up to the main shop.[2] In the cellar, one could hear the opening and shutting of the sweet-shop door, as well as the tinkling of the bell above it.[2]\n\nHoneydukes maintained and supplied the Honeydukes Express, a large food trolley which sold sweets to the staff and students riding the Hogwarts Express. It was driven about, and the candies were dispersed, by a kind, wizened old lady.\n\nIn 1890, a new student of Hogwarts stole dried Billywig stings out of Honeydukes' cellar for Garreth Weasley.[4]\n\nDuring the 1980s, Barnaby Lee worked in Honeydukes as a way to pay off the tab he gained by sampling every sweet in the store.[5]\n\nIn December 2010, Honeydukes was broken into by a thief one night who didn't steal anything but trampled on everything in there. Ambrosius Flume happened to be in the shop at the time and was hit on the head.[6]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the 2010s, volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force were able to make visits to Honeydukes with the usage of Portkeys. On these visits, they were tasked with collecting Wrackspurts seen throughout the shop.[7]",
