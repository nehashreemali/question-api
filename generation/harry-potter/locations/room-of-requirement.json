  "content": "The Room of Requirement, also known as the Come and Go Room, was a secret room within Hogwarts Castle, that only appeared when a person was in great need of it.[2]\n\nThe room had the unique ability to provide or transform itself into anything that a witch or wizard required of it at that moment in time.[3] Because of this, it was thought to have some degree of sentience. Although there were some limitations; for example, it could not create food, as that is one of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration.[4]\n\nThe room was Unplottable,[5] and did not appear on the Marauder's Map,[6] nor did its occupants, although this could simply be because James Potter, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew never found the room.\n\nThe room was located on the seventh floor in the left corridor of the Hogwarts castle and had a hidden entrance opposite the tapestry depicting the attempt of Barnabas the Barmy to teach trolls ballet.[1] The way to open the room was to walk past it three times while thinking about what one needed, and the door would appear.[2]\n\nThe Room of Requirement, true to its name, was able to provide anything that one required of it, or transform itself into anything that one required of it. For example, when Harry Potter needed a place where he and his allies could study Defence Against the Dark Arts, the room was filled with multiple books on defensive magic and various training equipment upon their entrance.\n\nHowever, it was advised that the users of this room be very specific about what they were looking for, as it had been shown that other people could enter the room and see what the occupant was doing if they knew how the room was being used. The Inquisitorial Squad found the hideout of the Dumbledore's Army in 1996 by knowing that the D.A. was in the room at the time. Neville Longbottom used this knowledge to create his hideout, as he specifically asked that the hideout be made unavailable to those who supported Alecto and Amycus Carrow.[7]\n\nDuring the 1890–1891 school year, Deputy Headmistress Matilda Weasley introduced the new fifth-year to the Room of Requirement so that they would have an area to focus on improving their abilities.[8] The student was later given access to the vivarium by Deek, a Hogwarts house-elf.[9]\n\nDuring the 1900s, the Mirror of Erised was stored here. One night in 1927, Albus Dumbledore came here to stare into the Mirror of Erised and reminisce on his past with Gellert Grindelwald, specifically them making their blood pact.[10]\n\nIn 1932, Albus Dumbledore, Jacob Kowalski, Newt Scamander, Theseus Scamander, Lally Hicks, and Bunty Broadacre took a Portkey in the room to travel to Bhutan in order to interfere with the 1932 International Confederation of Wizards' Supreme Mugwump election and stop Gellert Grindelwald from being appointed as the next Supreme Mugwump.[11]\n\nThe first mention Harry Potter heard of this room was in 1994, when Albus Dumbledore told Igor Karkaroff of his discovery of a room full of chamber pots when he needed to go to the toilet. However, he was unable to find the room again later like many of those who stumbled across the room.[12]\n\nIn 1995, Harry Potter asked Dobby if he knew of a place where Dumbledore's Army could safely meet. Dobby told Harry of what the house-elves called the \"Come and Go Room\" or \"Room of Requirement\", which he had used to treat Winky after she had gotten drunk on Butterbeer, as the room filled with antidotes to butterbeer and an elf-sized bed for Winky to sleep off her inebriation.\n\nHe also said that Argus Filch had found extra cleaning supplies in the room. During the first D.A. meeting, Fred and George Weasley revealed that it had once taken the form of a broom cupboard which they had used to hide from Filch.[2] Previously Dumbledore had also mentioned the Room of Requirement to Harry during the Yule Ball.[12]\n\nDumbledore's Army used the room as their headquarters and practice area. Among the items provided by the room for the D.A. were Dark Detectors and shelves of helpful books such as A Compendium of Common Curses and Their Counter-Actions, The Dark Arts Outsmarted, Self-Defensive Spellwork, and Jinxes for the Jinxed.[2] Hermione Granger was very impressed with the collection of books provided.\n\nAround Christmas, which was the last meeting before the break, Harry was cornered by Cho Chang under some mistletoe. Harry commented that the mistletoe was probably full of nargles. The two then shared a kiss. Harry later commented that the kiss was wet, as Cho had been crying at the time.\n\nThey were eventually discovered by the Inquisitorial Squad; due to the Squad wanting evidence, the Room provided the meeting room and the list of members.[13]\n\nDuring the 1996–1997 school year, Draco Malfoy used the Room of Requirement after  Lord Voldemort had given him a mission to let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts and ultimately assassinate Albus Dumbledore. Later on, Draco succeeded in fixing the Vanishing Cabinet, allowing Death Eaters, including Fenrir Greyback and Gibbon, to infiltrate Hogwarts.\n\nDuring the 1997–1998 school year, Neville Longbottom and several other students used the room as a hideout to escape the wrath of the new Death Eater professors, the Carrows. The problem was the lack of food, as it was one of the exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration. So the hideout adapted by adding an eighth passage into Hogsmeade, connected to the Hog's Head pub, whose owner, Aberforth, provided food.\n\nAlso, this advantage allowed members of the Order of the Phoenix to enter the school to help fight off Lord Voldemort's attack, without setting off the Caterwauling Charm on the village.[7]\n\nDuring the 2008–2009 school year, Ivy Warrington got lost in the castle and ended up in the Room of Requirement. She had no idea how she got there or what she was searching for. Daniel Page and his friend were trying to find her when the door to the room appeared.\n\nWhen they entered it, they saw Ivy sitting on a trunk. They encouraged her to leave before they were caught out of their common room after curfew and told her to bring her trunk, but she told them it couldn't be hers as it was there when she arrived. When they left, a hand inside the trunk opened it up and poked out.[14]\n\nThe Room of Hidden Things is one of the Room of Requirement's forms, appearing to those with a great need to hide or store something. It takes on the form of a storage room with a vast number of miscellaneous items that had been stored there over the years.\n\nThe Room of Hidden Things became inaccessible whenever the Room of Requirement was used for another purpose. As a result, during the Battle of Hogwarts, when the room was being used to provide passage to Hogsmeade and as a sanctuary, it had to be vacated of all people and \"reset\" before the Room of Hidden Things could once again be accessed.[7]\n\nAfter Simon Talmadge died, the Hogwarts Headteacher asked for all the furniture that belonged to a secret club that Simon had co-founded to be moved to the Room of Hidden Things.[15]\n\nAfter Tom Riddle resurfaced as Lord Voldemort and had his second request of becoming Hogwarts' Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher denied by Dumbledore, Voldemort managed to sneak Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem into the room, as a means to hide one of his Horcruxes.\n\nUnlike the others, he did not have time to set up many powerful spells to protect it due to time constraints, but believed that he was the only one who knew of the room's existence, and that nobody would look for it. This is another showcase of his own arrogance and ignorance, as he was clearly proven incorrect based on the mass of objects hidden by students before and after him.[16]\n\nIn his sixth year, Draco Malfoy spent the majority of his days within this room, fixing the Vanishing Cabinet that he moved from the school's hallway, in order to smuggle Death Eaters in and help him assassinate Dumbledore.[17]\n\nThe repair took most of the year, as Draco spent much time inside the room, and had his friends Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle remain outside in disguise to drop something onto the ground should anyone approach, to warn Draco not to come out.[6]\n\nHarry used the room in his sixth year to hide the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion Making. He found that many other students had used the room to hide a multitude of other objects, including the Vanishing Cabinet. Inside the cabinet in which he hid the book, Harry found a cage that contained the skeleton of something that had five legs.[18]\n\nAlso in Harry's sixth year, Professor Trelawney attempted to use the room to hide her sherry bottles, but Draco Malfoy threw her out.[19] Draco was using the room to repair the Vanishing Cabinet so he could smuggle Death Eaters into the castle via a counterpart Vanishing Cabinet in Borgin and Burkes, together forming a passageway. They did in fact use the room to infiltrate the castle in 1997.[17]\n\nLater that same year, during the Battle of Hogwarts, it was used as an evacuation route to move the students away from the dangers that followed. Later, Harry realised that Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem, one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, was hidden in the Room of Requirement, as he has seen it in his sixth year while hiding his Potions book and had even picked it up without realising what it was.[16]\n\nWhile the room was being used to maintain the passage to Hogwarts, the Room of Hidden Things couldn't be accessed. Harry, Hermione, and Ron cleared the room and accessed the Room of Hidden Things, where they were ambushed by Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. Crabbe let loose cursed fire that destroyed the Horcrux and many other objects, killing himself in the process. Ron wondered if the Room of Hidden Things could be accessed again due to the possibility of it being destroyed.[16]\n\nDuring the late 2000s or early 2010s, Lottie Turner and her friend went to the Room of Hidden Things to recover the secret club's pieces of furniture with the guidance of Gossamer and bring them back to the club space.[15]\n\nThe Room of Hidden Things may have had a special protection that prevented a Summoning Charm being used in it, meaning students had to physically find what it was they were looking for. This was the case when Hermione attempted to summon Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem, but failed, although this may be because the diadem was a Horcrux. She, Ron and Harry had to go searching for it instead.[16] However, this protection may have been placed by Voldemort specifically for the diadem, as he took similar precautions for his locket Horcrux.\n\nTom Riddle believed that he, and only he, was the only person that ever discovered the deepest secret in Hogwarts. He never expected Harry to discover this chamber. Additionally, even House-Elves cannot Apparate into the room, meaning they have to know what to ask the room to become into in order to access it.[2]\n\nWhile Harry discovered Draco is using this chamber to progress his plan, he could not make the room appear for him to see what the young Death Eater was up to, no matter what variation of thinking he used, thus giving Draco the privacy he requested.[6]\n\nThe room seemed to provide some form of protection to ensure the items stored inside would not be permanently destroyed so long as they remained inside, as despite Crabbe releasing Fiendfyre that enveloped the entire room in a sea of flames during 1998, about ten years after that, Lottie Turner and her friend were able to retrieve some furniture that had been stored inside since the 1820s.[15]\n\nHarry Potter saw many things that other students had hidden in the room, including:\n\nThe vivarium was an enclosure kept in the Room of Requirement during the 1890–1891 school year. Inside was an outdoor area which housed magical beasts and other creatures.[21] Creatures could be transported into the vivarium via a nab-sack.[9]\n\nCreatures known to have inhabited the vivarium include:",
