  "content": "Quality Quidditch Supplies was a store in North Side, Diagon Alley. It stocked many Quidditch related items such as Quaffles, Bludgers, broomsticks, and a Quidditch Starter Kit.[1]\n\nThis was where Harry Potter saw his first broomstick, the Nimbus 2000, and later the Nimbus 2001 and the Firebolt. It is possible that Harry bought Ron his Quidditch keeping gloves and Broom Compass from this store.\n\nQuality Quidditch Supplies also once displayed a full set of Chudley Cannons robes in the front window.[2]\n\nQuality Quidditch Supplies was Harry Potter’s favourite shop in Diagon Alley. He visited it often when he stayed for three weeks at the Leaky Cauldron, since that summer the new Firebolt racing broom had been introduced and the shop had one on display. However, he did not like the idea of the \"price on demand\" and realised that he already had a perfectly acceptable Nimbus 2000.\n\nAt Christmas that year, he received a Firebolt anonymously from whom he later discovered to be his godfather, Sirius Black. (Sirius considered this thirteen years of birthday and Christmas presents to Harry.) Quality Quidditch Supplies also once displayed a full set of Chudley Cannons robes in the front window.",
