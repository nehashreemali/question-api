  "content": "The Magical Congress of the United States of America (often abbreviated MACUSA) was the magical body in charge of governing the wizarding community of the United States of America. It was led by the President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America.\n\nUnlike the No-Maj United States Congress, which is divided into a House of Representatives and a United States Senate, the MACUSA was unicameral.[5] The MACUSA was located within the Woolworth Building in downtown New York City.[6]\n\nThe headquarters of the Magical Congress of the United States of America were located in the Woolworth Building, New York, New York.[7] The building that housed the Magical Congress of the United States of America was about as imposing as Gringotts bank. It was vast and grand, covered in gold, emerald, maroon and black.\n\nIt was the American equivalent of the Ministry of Magic, and had similar levels of ominous grandeur.[8]\n\nMACUSA performed many of the same functions as other wizarding governing bodies in other countries, such as the Ministries of Magic or Councils of Magic.[3]\n\nMACUSA was modelled on the Wizards' Council of Great Britain, which predated the Ministry of Magic. Representatives from magical communities all over North America were elected to MACUSA to create laws that both policed and protected American wizardkind.[3]\n\nIn MACUSA's early years, its primary aim was to rid the continent of Scourers, corrupt wizards who had hunted their fellow magical beings for personal gain. MACUSA's second great law enforcement challenge was the number of wizarding criminals who had fled to America from Europe and beyond, precisely because of the lack of organised law enforcement such as existed in their own countries.[3]\n\nThe Magical Congress of the United States of America was established in 1693 with the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy, as a direct result of the Salem Witch Trials. Thus this means that MACUSA pre-dates the No-Maj formation of the United States of America by around a century.[1] One of the representatives was Josiah Jackson, who became the first President of MACUSA. Josiah was thought to be strong enough to deal with the troubles caused by the Salem Witch Trials.[3]\n\nThe first task of the North American wizarding legislature was to put on trial the Scourers, an unscrupulous and brutal band of wizarding bounty hunters and racketeers, executing those convicted of murder, wizard-trafficking, and torture.[1] Josiah Jackson's main priority when he became President was to create and train Aurors. There were only a select few to start with, with only two of them surviving to old age. They won the enduring respect of the magical community in North America, which was extended to their descendants.[3]\n\nEventually, MACUSA created an enchanted edifice in the Appalachian Mountains as their headquarters. However, they had to relocate as it was in an inconvenient location.[3]\n\nMACUSA has had to move its location at least five times since its inception. Originally, MACUSA had no definite meeting place and moved around so it would not be detected by No-Majs.[3]\n\nDue to the fact that America had a very hostile relationship between magical and non magical people, there was no cooperation between MACUSA and the No-Maj government.[3]\n\nIn 1760, MACUSA relocated to Williamsburg in Virginia where then President Thornton Harkaway lived. Harkaway bred Crups, which possessed a great aggression towards non-magical people. When the Crups attacked local No-Majs, it led to a great breach of the Statute of Secrecy, and Harkaway had to step down in disgrace.[3]\n\nMACUSA then relocated to Baltimore, where President Able Fleming lived. However, when the Revolutionary War began, MACUSA decided to move to what would become Washington, decades before the No-Maj Congress even built the city.[3]\n\nIn 1777, then President Elizabeth McGilliguddy presided over the infamous Country or Kind? debate. It was an extraordinary meeting which led to the expansion of the Great Meeting Chamber. They discussed whether to support their community or their country and whether to fight for liberation from the British Muggles. They also debated whether it was really their fight. The argument did not go well and it led to a fight.\n\nPro-interventionists argued that by intervening, they could save lives, while anti-interventionists believed that they would reveal their community by intervening and place it in danger. They sought the advice of the British Ministry of Magic to find out whether they intended to intervene on their side, and they replied with only a four word letter — \"Sitting this one out\". McGilliguddy replied with an even shorter message stating \"Mind you do\". Ultimately, they did not intervene, but they did attempt to protect their No-Maj neighbours unofficially, and celebrated Independence Day.[3]\n\nMACUSA's fifteenth president, Emily Rappaport, presided over one of the largest ever breaches of the Statute of Secrecy when Dorcus Twelvetrees, daughter of MACUSA's Keeper of Treasure and Dragots Aristotle Twelvetrees, unwittingly revealed major details of the wizarding community to a Scourer descendant named Bartholomew Barebone, who subsequently used this information to start a brief, ill-fated but still highly damaging crusade to expose wizardkind.\n\nThough Barebone's efforts were unsuccessful, the incident nevertheless proved highly embarrassing for MACUSA, who were forced to relocate their headquarters and faced \"humilating\" censure from the International Confederation of Wizards with Rappaport herself being forced to admit that she could not be certain that the incident had been entirely contained.\n\nIn direct response to this breach, Rappaport's Law was drafted and passed into law which would enforce strict segregation between the No-Maj and wizarding communities. Henceforth, wizards were no longer allowed to befriend or marry No-Majs, and penalties of such fraternisation were harsh. Communication was also limited to only if necessary to perform daily activities. During this time, MACUSA worked strictly independently of the No-Maj government to decrease the possibility of exposure.\n\nUnder Rappaport's Law, MACUSA continued to avoid communication with the No-Maj community for many years, and MACUSA also continued to impose severe penalties on those who disobeyed the International Statute of Secrecy.\n\nAfter the Great Sasquatch Rebellion of 1892, MACUSA was forced to relocate its headquarters for the fifth time in its history, and moved from Washington to New York City at the Woolworth Building, where it remained throughout the 1920s. The rebellion was blamed on Irene Kneedander, Head of the Body for the Protection of Magical Species, as Kneedander had taken to attacking a Sasquatch that had done something wrong, which led to their decision to rebel. It had led to great Obliviations in Washington.[3]\n\nThey needed a new headquarters, and over the course of several years, wizards infiltrated the construction team of a new building in New York. By the time the Woolworth Building was completed, it could both house No-Majs and — if activated by the correct spells — transform into a space for wizards. The only outer mark of their new secret location was the owl carved over the entrance.[3]\n\nSometime at the end of the 19th century, legislation was introduced which would require all American wizards and witches to have a permit allowing them to carry a wand. This was a measure that was intended to keep tabs on all magical activity and identify the perpetrators by their wands, thus making the concealment of magic easier.\n\nRappaport's Law was still in operation in the 1920s and several offices in MACUSA had no counterpart in the Ministry of Magic.\n\nUnlike the No-Maj community, which had a strict Prohibition law against alcohol for many years, MACUSA allowed the wizarding community to consume alcohol, though many criticised this policy, pointing out that it made witches and wizards rather conspicuous around sober No-Majs. However, the then President Seraphina Picquery stated that being a wizard or witch in America was already hard enough. At one point she famously told her Chief of Staff that the \"Gigglewater was non-negotiable.\"\n\nHouse elves worked at MACUSA during the 1920s. One such House-elf cleaned wands with a wand polishing machine.[9] A significant difference between the wizarding governments of the United States and the UK of this time was the penalty for a serious crime. British witches and wizards were sent to Azkaban, whereas the worst criminals in America were executed. The penalty for escaping Azkaban, however, was the Dementor's Kiss, which could be considered worse than execution.\n\nIn the 1920s, the President of MACUSA was Seraphina Picquery. The Department of Magical Law Enforcement was headed by Percival Graves, a well-respected descendant of one of the original twelve American Aurors. It was during this period that MACUSA closely monitored the terrorism committed by the Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald and his followers in Europe, also co-operating in the international search for him.[10] It is also known that during this time, Grindelwald's ideals influenced some MACUSA workers.[11]\n\nBy 1926, Gellert Grindelwald had infiltrated MACUSA by assuming the identity of Director of Magical Security and Department of Magical Law Enforcement \nHead of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement Percival Graves, at a time when MACUSA's Major Investigation Department was attempting to discover the identity of an unknown magical force causing severe devastation throughout the city. He used this high-ranking position to manipulate Credence Barebone into revealing the identity of the unknown magical force.[12]\n\nIn December, British Magizoologist Newt Scamander was detained by former MACUSA Auror Tina Goldstein when he inadvertently caused a series of breaches of the International Statute of Secrecy related to his case of magical creatures. The severest breach occurred when Scamander accidentally swapped cases with No-Maj Jacob Kowalski at a bank in New York City, leading to various creatures escaping. The three then set about attempting to recover the escaped magical beasts without reporting the incident to wizarding authorities.[12] On 6 December, MACUSA was hiring Obliviators as No-majs were having more magical experiences than usual, because of the problems Newt Scamander was causing across New York city.[13]\n\nWhilst this was occurring, the unknown magical force killed a No-Maj Senator in front of guests at a fundraising dinner. As a result, the International Confederation of Wizards, already concerned with the rising levels of MACUSA's Magical Exposure Threat Level Measurer, sent a delegation to MACUSA Headquarters to hold an emergency meeting. It was at this meeting that Newt Scamander, Tina Goldstein, and Jacob Kowalski were falsely believed to have been responsible for the Senator's death and were arrested. Grindelwald, in his assumed capacity as Director of Magical Security, sought to have them executed after Scamander and Tina discovered a hint over his true identity. Newt, Goldstein, and Kowalski ultimately escaped MACUSA, becoming fugitives.[12]\n\nAfter Newt, Tina, Queenie Goldstein, and Jacob Kowalski were able to recover all of the escaped magical beasts, Grindelwald discovered that the identity of the magical force was Credence Barebone himself, while simultaneously revealing that the boy was an Obscurial. Grindelwald then attempted to persuade Barebone to join his cause after callously rejecting him, which provoked Barebone into transforming once more into his Obscurus form and caused him to go on a rampage across the city.\n\nThe rampage resulted in Credence Barebone being seemingly destroyed at the hands of MACUSA Aurors, Gellert Grindelwald being revealed and arrested by MACUSA, Goldstein and Newt pardoned and thanked for their role in helping unmask Grindelwald, and the en masse obliviation of the thousands of New York City No-Maj residents, and MACUSA engaging in a major clean-up operation to repair the property damage caused.[12]\n\nOn 30 May 1927, MACUSA, working with the International Confederation of Wizards, attempted to extradite maximum-security prisoner Gellert Grindelwald via use of a flying high-security carriage from New York to Europe. Several MACUSA Aurors escorted the carriage on broomstick, while additional Aurors, along with the ICW's Head of Incarceration Rudolph Spielman, guarded inside. The attempt was ultimately sabotaged by MACUSA worker-turned Grindelwald Acolyte Abernathy, whom in fact managed to switch places with Grindelwald before the extradition. Grindelwald subsequently attacked the transport in the skies of New York, assuming control of the carriage by attacking the Aurors and injuring Spielman, whom he threw off the carriage into the New York Bay, escaping with Abernathy into the night.[11]\n\nThe President of MACUSA and thus leader of American wizarding society was President Samuel G. Quahog by 2014.[2]\n\nFollowing the kidnapping of Hans the Augurey by American fans celebrating the American team's success in the quarter-finals of the 2014 Quidditch World Cup against Liechtenstein, several terse letters were exchanged between President Quahog and Otto Obermeier, Minister for Magic of Liechtenstein.[2] Luckily, Hans was returned the following day, 9 June 2014, and the relationship between the two countries seemed not to have been too damaged.[2]\n\nIn 2021, The Unforgivable unleashed a surge of Foundables related to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes where Ron Weasley worked. Ginny Weasley was attacked and Ron was abducted by the organisation. The Unforgivable succeeded in intimidating Harry Potter and Hermione Granger, Harry enlisted the help of MACUSA in the hopes of finding his best friend, this attack only made Hermione even more determined to bring the cabal to justice.[14] MACUSA obliged and sent Harry extra Aurors to assist with the investigation.\n\nThe first dozen volunteers to train as Aurors in the US had a special place in United States wizarding history, in part due to their sacrifice. Their descendants were given particular respect ever since. Of these twelve, only two survived into old age: Charity Wilkinson, who would become MACUSA's third President, and Theodard Fontaine, whose direct descendant Agilbert was the Headmaster of Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry by 2016.[3] Another vital part of the Law Enforcement Offices were the US Auror Divisions, which conducted Auror as well as police work.\n\nAlso of note were Gondulphus Graves, ancestor to Percival Graves, whose family were influential in American wizarding politics, and Abraham Potter, who genealogists would discover centuries later was distantly related to the famous Harry Potter.[3]\n\nAs with most other magical governing bodies, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement was the largest department in MACUSA.\n\nThe Magical Congress of the United States of America was a large body of government, and thus had many different positions and departments within it.\n\nThe President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America was the leader of the wizarding world in the United States and the highest ranking member of the Magical Congress of the United States of America, which they presided over. Josiah Jackson became the first President of MACUSA. Josiah was thought to be strong enough to deal with the troubles caused by the Salem Witch Trials.\n\nMACUSA had several departments in all, each dealing with different aspects of the wizarding world. It had a Department of Magical Law Enforcement, just as the British Ministry of Magic did. It was also the largest department, and all others more or less answered to it. Some of the departments were:\n\nMost of the departments listed had either something to do with magical law or No-Maj relations, as MACUSA spent a large amount of its resources toward keeping the American wizarding community hidden from No-Majes.",
