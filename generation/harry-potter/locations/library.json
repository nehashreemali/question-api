  "content": "The Hogwarts Library was located off of a corridor on the first-floor of Hogwarts Castle and contained tens of thousands of books on thousands of shelves. Every book, scroll, and object ever contained within the library were catalogued in the Archival History Records.[5]\n\nOverseen by Madam Irma Pince, the library was where students could go to peruse or borrow books to supplement their studies (or for personal enjoyment).[4] The library closed at 8:00 pm.[6]\n\nQuite strict where the rules in the library was concerned, Madam Pince was the kind of librarian who saw herself as the guardian and protector of the books, at odds with the students who try to use them, whom she did not allow to eat, talk, laugh, whisper, sneeze or scurry in the library.[4]\n\nOverall, her demeanour did not suggest that she would be very helpful, and conducting research was very difficult in the Hogwarts library. As a result, completing homework assignments that required additional information was unnecessarily tedious. If they'd had a helpful librarian, students would not have had to spend hours simply looking for the books they needed, and could have had more time for studying.\n\nThe Old Librarian was one of the first known Hogwarts Librarians. A portrait of him was later placed in the Library after his death.[7]\n\nIn the Tudor period, the Keepers built the Athenaeum beneath the Hogwarts Library as a pre-trial for someone in the future who could see traces and use ancient magic.[8]\n\nEarly in the 1890–1891 school year, Professor Fig and his student, who saw traces of ancient magic, discovered the Keepers after tracking clues from Vault 12 at Gringotts, which the Keepers had also left. They prepared to explore the library, but before they could proceed, Professor Fig was drawn away by Headmaster Black. As a result, the student sought the help of Sebastian Sallow, who had frequently entered the Restricted Section to find information on a cure for his sister Anne.[8]\n\nWhile in the Restricted Section, they were confronted by Peeves the Poltergeist, who alerted Madam Scribner, the librarian, to their presence. Sebastian returned to divert attention, giving time for the student to continue exploring and eventually discovere the Athenaeum.[8]\n\nBefore Harry Potter's time at Hogwarts, the Restricted Section had books about Horcruxes in it including Secrets of the Darkest Art. However by Tom Riddle's time at Hogwarts in the 1940s, Horcruxes were a banned subject and Albus Dumbledore was very strict about it.[9] It's unknown when, but Dumbledore eventually removed every book containing information on Horcruxes in the library.[10]\n\nThe entrance of the Vault of Fear was located in the library. During the 1986–1987 school year, several students including Jacob's sibling entered the Vault of Fear to defeat the boggarts inside. Rowan Khanna distracted Madam Pince by claiming their Self-Inking Quill was left near some books so their friends could enter past closing hours.[11]\n\nDuring the 1987–1988 school year, it held the election for the head of the decorating committee for the Celestial Ball.[12]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year, Barnaby Lee brought a Leucrotta into the library, which was against the rules (as creatures were not allowed in the library), to help Jacob's sibling and Tulip Karasu research ways how to clean its teeth. The Leucrotta repeated the insults from Kelly about Madam Pince aloud, which Pince overheard, with her giving Jacob's sibling detention in response, believing them to be guilty and not believing the story after their friends scarpered with the Leucrotta.[13]\n\nAt the start of the 1989–1990 school year, Jacob returned to Hogwarts to search the library for books, creating quite a mess in the process. When Jacob's sibling asked Pince if she had seen Jacob in the library, she said she was surprised to see rummage through the shelves haphazardly, as he had always been a model patron in the library who respected books. They then helped Pince clean up the scattered books.[14]\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year, Pince tasked Jacob's sibling with finding library books that were long overdue. She considered students with overdue books to be \"delinquents\". They managed to track down all the books for her.[15]\n\nIn December 1991, in his first year, Harry Potter used his newly-acquired Invisibility Cloak to sneak into the Restricted Section during the Christmas holidays. He went at night in order to look for information on Nicolas Flamel.[4] Unfortunately, he picked up a large black book near the bottom of the shelf that began screaming when he opened it.\n\nWorried that he would attract attention, Harry closed it and ran off.[4] Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger also read through various library books in the hope of finding information about Nicolas Flamel; Hermione in fact managed to find a book about Flamel whilst doing some \"light reading\".\n\nThat school year, Draco Malfoy once used the Leg-Locker Curse on Neville Longbottom outside the library to bully him.[16] Hagrid also visited the library this year in search for books regarding dragons in the Dragon Section of the library. He needed information on how to care for his newly acquired Dragon egg.[17] Also in this year, Professor Quirrell sent Harry to library to remove the curse he was under. On his way to the library he met with Albus Dumbledore, who suggested that he look in the Reference Section as a means of help.[18]\n\nDuring the 1992–1993 school year, Harry Potter eavesdropped on a group of Hufflepuffs, while hidden in the Invisibility Section.[19] The Hufflepuffs were discussing Harry and his ability to speak Parseltongue and the possibility that he might be the Heir of Slytherin.\n\nWhile researching on information about the basilisk who was attacking Muggle-borns and Mrs.Norris, Hermione Granger, together with Penelope Clearwater, was petrified by the basilisk, by looking at it in Penelope's mirror. They were found near the library and was later carried up to the Hospital Wing.[20][21]\n\nDuring the 1993–1994 school year, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger studied some of the material in the Legal Section of the Library. They hoped would help Hagrid at Buckbeak's hearing.[22] In 1993, it had an infestation of Imps. A Draconifors-dragon statue can also be found here.[23]\n\nDuring the 1994–1995 school year, Harry Potter received Minerva McGonagall's permission to enter the Restricted Section so he could research a way about being able to breathe underwater for an hour to compete in the second task of the Triwizard Tournament,[6] but had also made use of the regular section, and came across the book Basic Hexes for the Busy and Vexed when researching spells for the first task.\n\nHe was looking for books comtaining simple spells, as Sirius suggested that the way to deal with a dragon is relatively.[24] Harry also checked out books for the third task in order to prepare, some of the spells he learned were the Impediment Jinx and the Reductor Curse.[25]\n\nDuring the 1995–1996 school year, Harry and Ron researched the properties moonstone in for Potions homework in the library.[26] Alicia Spinnet was also jinxed by Miles Bletchley whilst she was studying, in an attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Quidditch team's chances for a Quidditch match versus the Slytherin Quidditch team.[27]\n\nLater that year, Harry saw Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle and Theodore Nott looking at him angrily in the library, as his recent interview published in the The Quibbler had outed their fathers as Death Eaters.[28] At Easter, Harry ate chocolate with Ginny Weasley in the library whilst reading books, however Madam Pince caught them and enchanted their belongings to chase them out of the library.[29]\n\nDuring the 1996–1997 school year, Harry studied Everlasting Elixirs in N.E.W.T. Potions class, taking notes on them in the Hogwarts Library from his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. In his copy of Advanced Potion-Making the Half-Blood Prince had made annotations on these elixirs.\n\nHe and Hermione were forced out of the library after Madam Pince saw his graffitied book and looked as though she was going to have a fit. Hermione warned him that if he wasn't careful, Pince would ban him from the library.[30]\n\nIn the 2010–2011 school year, the library had 137 books on Quidditch and none on how to care for a Flobberworm if adopted as a pet. This frustrated Kevin Farrell who wanted to learn how to keep one.[31]\n\nAt some point between the 2008–2009 and 2010–2011 school year, an unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student and their fellow students from Gryffindor (Kevin Farrell and Robyn Thistlethwaite) found Miranda Goshawk's spell journal that had been hidden on a quiet bookshelf in the Hogwarts Library.[32]\n\nThe library books had various spells on them to prevent students from defacing or stealing them, all of which were standard practice. However, Madam Pince had been known to place spells of her own on them as additional protection; one such example would make the book physically assault the reader should they dare to scribble on it.[29]\n\nHermione Granger tore a page out of a library book about magical creatures without being cursed, jinxed, or hexed by the book. How she did this is unknown. Chocolate and (presumably) other food was forbidden in the library. Harry Potter also showed signs of breaking the security of the library in his first year, when he entered the Restricted Section under his invisibility cloak.[4]\n\nStudents and teachers could take out books from the library, with the librarian’s permission. Books from the Restricted Section required a signed note from a teacher to be checked out.[33][19] Professor Severus Snape told Harry Potter that it was against the rules to carry a library book out of the castle. However, he may have just made that rule up to get Harry into trouble.[34] Students seemed to be able to place books on hold — during the 1992–1993 school year the book Hogwarts, A History had a two-week waiting list.[35]\n\nProfessor Dumbledore removed the books pertaining to the subject of Horcruxes, due to the fact that they involve such Dark Magic. He kept them in his office until his death, whence Hermione Granger summoned them before departing in her sixth year.[10]\n\nThere were overdue records on the library due date sheet. Ron Weasley had Quidditch Through the Ages overdue.[36]",
