  "content": "The Leaky Cauldron was a popular wizarding pub and inn located in London. It was the entrance to Diagon Alley and, indirectly, Knockturn Alley. The rear of the pub opened up onto a chilly courtyard that contains the entrance to both alley ways.[2]\n\nThe pub was built by Daisy Dodderidge, the first landlady, in the early 1500s \"to serve as a gateway between the non-wizarding world and Diagon Alley.\"[3] As a consequence, it was the oldest pub in London.[6] It had a bar, several private parlour rooms, and a large dining room.\n\nTo Muggles, the pub appears to be a broken-down old shop front on Charing Cross Road. This, however, was not the case prior to the imposition of the Statute of Secrecy and, prior to this, Muggle visitors were neither turned away nor made to feel unwelcome.[1]\n\nThe Leaky Cauldron was built in the 1500s by Daisy Dodderidge.[3] The pub was there long before Charing Cross Road was even planned. Its true address is number one Diagon Alley, and it is believed to have been built along with the rest of the wizarding street. Created some two centuries before the wizarding world community made the joint decision to go into hiding, the Leaky Cauldron used to be visible to Muggle eyes.[1]\n\nWhile the pub was, from the first, a place for witches and wizards to congregate — whether Londoners or out-of-towners up for the day to shop for the latest magical ingredients or devicesn— Muggles were not turned away or made to feel unwelcome, even though some of the conversations, not to mention pets, caused many an unwary Muggle to leave without finishing his or her mead.[1]\n\nWith the imposition of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy in 1692, Minister Ulick Gamp permitted the pub to continue its existence as a safe haven and refuge for members of the magical community.[1] Though insistent on numerous concealment spells and good behaviour from all who used the pub, Gamp was sympathetic to the need of wizards to let off steam during this difficult time, and further agreed to give the landlord permission to let people into Diagon Alley from his backyard, because the shops behind the Leaky Cauldron were now also in need of protection.[1] Out of gratitude, the landlord created a new brand of beer, Gamp's Old Gregarious, which tasted so disgusting that even with a one-hundred-Galleon incentive, nobody could finish a pint.[1]\n\nIn 1887,[7] the pub was faced with the possibility of being demolished when the Muggles set in motion the construction of Charing Cross Road. The Minister at that time, Faris Spavin, had become certain that this was the end of the pub, and given a melancholy, seven-hour speech in the Wizengamot about why the establishment could not be saved, only to receive a note from his secretary the moment he sat down, informing him that the magical community had rallied and, through the mass use of Memory Charms, had altered the entire route of the new road to accommodate the Leaky Cauldron, leaving the architects confused as to why there was a blank space on the design, and why said space did not appear to the naked eye.[1]\n\nThe Leaky Cauldron had changed little over the years; it was small, dingy and welcoming, with a few bedrooms above the public bar for travellers who live a long way from London. It was the ideal spot to catch up with wizarding gossip if one happened to live a long way from the nearest magical neighbour.[1]\n\nDuring the 1986–1987 school year, Barnaby Lee's grandmother tried to privately rent out the whole of the Leaky Cauldron for the Lee Family Toast, but the barmaid wouldn't let her. Eventually Barnaby's grandmother stormed off in a huff, and Jacob's sibling managed to convince her to hold it in a packed Leaky Cauldron, claiming that having the public there to witness the event would spread the Lee family's fame. She agreed, and the Lee Family Toast went ahead.[8]\n\nIn the summer of 1899, Albus Dumbledore and Elphias Doge stayed at the Leaky Cauldron, in preparation to depart for Greece, when Albus received word of his mother's death.[9]\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year, Zenith Xeep held a Meet-and-Greet for her beauty-and-lifestyle business, Xeep, at the Leaky Cauldron, and promoted her hair care potion, Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution. Rita Skeeter, Bilton Bilmes, Jacob's sibling and Garrick Ollivander attended.[10] Around the same time, a wizard went to the Leaky Cauldron to chat with Tom when the wizard saw the Muggle Artefact Smuggler.[11]\n\nLater during that school year, Jacob and their sibling had an awkward dinner in the Leaky Cauldron with their long lost father Peregrine.[12] They later met with their father in the inn to discuss their findings about Dai Ryusaki.[13]\n\nOn July 31 1991, Harry Potter and Rubeus Hagrid passed through the pub on their way to Diagon Alley. Tom, the innkeeper, greeted Hagrid there like an old friend. This made it seem that Hagrid was something of a regular. Some other witches and wizards who were there at the time were Doris Crockford, Dedalus Diggle, and Quirinus Quirrell and they took a great interest in Harry, queuing to shake his hand.[2]\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Harry Potter and the Weasley family travelled to Diagon Alley by Floo Powder. Harry mispronounced \"Diagonally\", and therefore travelled to Knockturn Alley instead. After doing their shopping, Harry and the Weasleys departed through the Leaky Cauldron's fireplace to The Burrow.[14]\n\nIn the summer of 1993, as well as stopping there for drinks, Harry Potter stayed at the inn for a time, having accidentally blown up his Aunt Marge. He also met Cornelius Fudge in a private room for the first time.[15][16]\n\nWhile the Leaky Cauldron was a favourite hangout for the magical community, its patronage took a turn for the worse in the summer of 1996, during the beginning of the Second Wizarding War. With Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters moving in the open, many witches and wizards avoided public places as much as possible, including the Leaky Cauldron. When Harry Potter, Rubeus Hagrid, and the Weasley family passed through the Leaky Cauldron that summer on his way to Diagon Alley, they noticed that the bar was empty with the exception of Tom.[17]\n\nOn 1 May 1998, at the height of the war, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, with the assistance of Griphook the goblin, staged a break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank. While passing through the Leaky Cauldron on the way to the bank, they noted that it was nearly empty. Tom bowed in fear at the sight of Hermione, who was disguised as Bellatrix Lestrange at the time.[18]\n\nAt some point after the end of the Second Wizarding War, Tom either retired or passed away. Hannah Abbott then became the new landlady.[4]\n\nThe Leaky Cauldron began to sell Stewed Mandrake Quiche during the Calamity in the late 2010s or early 2020s. The dish was described as \"disruptive\" and nausea-inducing, with a Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force believing that the food had resulted in a recent uptick of Traces in the area. In response, the investigator convinced management to modify their menu. The same Calamity Investigator later ran into Harry Potter at the Leaky Cauldron and engaged in a lively discussion about potions with him. Harry taught the investigator Severus Snape's method of preparing Sopophorous beans by pressing them with the flat side of a knife to release more of their juice, which they used to reduce the brew time of their Dawdle Draught.[19]\n\nMinister for Magic Hermione Granger later gave an impromptu talk about the Calamity at the Leaky Cauldron, which was attended by the same Calamity Investigator. From this talk, the investigator learned about the ineffability of the Calamity, from which they figured out a new way to improve their Trace Charm. The same Calamity Investigator also met George Weasley in the Leaky Cauldron, who discussed his affinity for pyrotechnics with them, resulting in their power increasing when having cast a critical blow.[19]\n\nLocated at 1 Diagon Alley,[1] The Leaky Cauldron was nested between a Muggle bookshop and a record store. Inside the pub, it was dark and shabby, with a bar and a number of tables in the shadows of the corners. In stark contrast to the grubby downstairs of the pub, there were some unexpectedly pleasant rooms upstairs where passing wizards and witches could stay for the night. These rooms were reached by way of a handsome wooden staircase, and contained comfortable beds, highly polished oak furniture, a crackling fire which was always burning in the grate to welcome the visitor to their lodgings, and, in Harry's case, a talking mirror.[2]\n\nA cellar was located beneath the ground floor,[20][21] that held barrels containing the beverage supply for the establishment as well as a chest for holding reserve Floo Powder.[22]\n\nA Private parlour was located behind the bar at the ground-floor. It had a desk, a window and a little table and two somewhat uncomfortable chairs. In 1993 Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge borrowed the room so he could talk to Harry Potter about his safety and that he didn't have to worry about Sirius Black (who was thought to be a mass-murderer). He also told Harry that two men from the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad were sent out to puncture Marjorie Dursley and modify her memory after Harry lost control in the Dursley family's home, and that running away was irresponsible.[15]\n\nRoom 10 was a room at the first-floor. In 1993, a young maid was about to clean the room when its owner roared at her and closed the door.[23]\n\nRoom 11 was a room at the first-floor which had a bed in the middle, a fireplace, a talking mirror, and a window. In 1993 Harry Potter and his owl Hedwig stayed in the room after Harry ran away from Privet Drive and was picked up by the Knight Bus.[15]",
