  "content": "The Hogwarts Express was the name of the train that ran between London King's Cross Station Platform 9¾ and Hogsmeade Station. It made this run semi-frequently, most notably on 1 September before the start of term and in June at the end of term.[5][6][7][8][9][10]\n\nThe Express dutifully carried students of all years to and from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It travels at the start and end of every term.[3] It was the school's primary method of travel. The train left Platform 9¾ without fail every 1 September at 11 o'clock in the morning, arriving at Hogsmeade Station in the early evening.[3] Some students took the train back to King's Cross Station to go home for the Christmas and Easter holidays, but some did not, as they stayed at Hogwarts.[11]\n\nAside from transporting students, where the whole train was exclusively reserved for their use only, the Hogwarts Express was used by witches and wizards who wanted to travel between Hogsmeade and London and didn't want to or couldn't Apparate or fly.[12] Travel on the train was impossible without a ticket, and tickets usually couldn't be bought on the train, though there were exceptions in rare cases.[12]\n\nIn striking contrast to Britain's later National Rail system, the Hogwarts Express took the form of a large red, 4-6-0 steam engine, named Hogwarts Castle. Originally steam fitted by the Muggles who built it, the locomotive later ran exclusively on magic.\n\nThe passenger carriages held compartments set off a corridor, allowing each compartment to function as a self-contained stage within the larger train. Prefects of the school rode in a separate carriage near the front of the train.[3] The compartments on the train appeared to be lettered; in 1996, the Slug Club met in Compartment C.[13] During the long journey to Hogwarts, students could enjoy treats from a trolley, such as Pumpkin Pasties and Chocolate Frogs; in addition, there was also a Buffet Car.[3]\n\nThere were usually no adults aboard the Hogwarts Express whilst students were being transported except the trolley witch and the driver.[3][14] However, occasionally, new teachers (such as Remus Lupin and Horace Slughorn) could be found aboard the train as well.[14][13] According to the trolley witch, the train didn't take kindly to students who tried to leave when it was moving, possibly implying that it had some form of sentience.[15]\n\nAs we know from early historical accounts, and from the evidence of early woodcuts and engravings, Hogwarts students used to arrive at school in any manner that caught their fancy.[1] Some rode broomsticks (a difficult feat when carrying trunks and pets); others commandeered enchanted carts and, later, carriages; some attempted to Apparate (often with disastrous effects, as the castle and grounds had always been protected with Anti-Apparition Charms), others rode a variety of magical creatures.[1]\n\nIn 1827, Ottaline Gambol rose to the office of Minister for Magic, and she made a daring and controversial suggestion to solve the ages-old problem of how to transport hundreds of students to and from Hogwarts Castle every school year without attracting the Muggles' attention.\n\nIntrigued by Muggle technology, the Minister saw the potential of using a Muggle steam locomotive as a secure and comfortable alternative to Portkeys or to unregulated means of travel. The locomotive for the Hogwarts Express itself was originally built by the Muggle engineers at Crewe, in Cheshire, England,[1] in the early-to-mid 19th century.\n\nIn 1920, the Ministry of Magic carried out a large-scale operation involving 167 Memory Charms and the most powerful Concealment Charm ever performed in Britain to acquire a steam locomotive for student transportation. The engine selected was a Great Western Railway 4-6-0, which was either purchased and modified through magical means or discreetly taken from Muggle railway stock. The morning after the operation, the residents of Hogsmeade awoke to find a gleaming red steam engine and a newly built railway station that had not existed the day before. Meanwhile, Muggle railway workers in Crewe were left with an unshakable feeling that they had misplaced something—one that lingered with them for the rest of the year.[1]\n\nThere was initial resistance from pure-blood families against using a Muggle-built device for wizard transportation. These families claimed that the express was \"unsafe, insanitary, and demeaning\". This was their stance until the Ministry decreed that students would arrive to school on the train or not attend at all.[1] There is no information on where exactly Hogwarts students were travelling from during the period after the acquisition of the Hogwarts express and the creation of the Hogsmeade Station and before the opening of King's Cross Station and the Platform Nine and Three-Quarters in the 1850s.[16]\n\nIt was on the Hogwarts Express that Harry Potter first made the acquaintance of Ronald Weasley in 1991, and first met many of the other people who played significant roles in his life, including: Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, Fred Weasley, George Weasley and, in later years, Remus Lupin and Luna Lovegood.\n\nThe second confrontation between Harry and Draco Malfoy occurred on the train on the way to Hogwarts when Draco sneered at Ron and offered Harry his friendship. Harry turned down Draco's offer abruptly, marking the beginning of a long-standing enmity and hatred between the two boys.[3] These enmity continued throughout their years at Hogwarts.\n\nHarry had his first encounter with a Dementor on the Hogwarts Express in 1993; the train had been stopped by the creatures to determine if escaped criminal Sirius Black was on board.[14] In 1996, Harry and others were invited to a compartment occupied by Professor Horace Slughorn;[13] the Express later ferried the students home early after Albus Dumbledore's funeral.[10]\n\nIn 1997 the train was twice stopped en-route to Hogwarts; first by Death Eaters searching for Harry Potter, where they were met with some resistance from its occupants,[17] and the second during the Christmas holidays, when they abducted Luna Lovegood in retaliation for her father's rebellious printings.[18]\n\nAt some point during the 2000s and 2010s, a new student aboarded the train, beginning their journey to Hogwarts.[19]\n\nIn 2017, Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione took their children to Platform 9¾ where they boarded the train to leave for Hogwarts.[20] In one of the old train's compartments, Albus Potter met Scorpius Malfoy and, in an ironic reversal of their own fathers, became fast friends. When the two were in their fourth year, and returning to Hogwarts on the train, they managed to jump off it in order to continue with a plan involving a Time-Turner, despite the efforts of the Trolley witch to stop them.[15]\n\nBetween 27 August and 3 September 2019, the Hogwarts Express fell victim to the Calamity, vanishing for a time before a member of the SOS Task Force Office intervened to restore it.[21]",
