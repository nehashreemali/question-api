  "content": "A Ministry of Magic was the primary governing body of the magical community in many countries. Headed by a Minister for Magic, a Ministry of Magic was responsible for regulating and enforcing laws for the magical community, as well as keeping said community hidden from the Muggle world.[1]\n\nIn Great Britain, at least, the term \"Ministry of Magic\" seemed to be synonymous with \"form of wizarding government\", since the term was, on occasion, loosely applied to also refer to the Wizards' Council that preceded the British Ministry.[2]\n\nThere were alternative magical governing bodies known to the international magical community such as the Council of Magic, the Argentinian one being a case in point.[13] The Magical Congress of the United States of America was another example. It is unknown precisely what distinguishes those magical governing bodies from a Ministry of Magic.",
