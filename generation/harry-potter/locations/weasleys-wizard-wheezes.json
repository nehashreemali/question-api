  "content": "Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes,[1] also known as Weasley & Weasley,[2] was a joke shop located at 93 Diagon Alley founded by Fred and George Weasley.\n\nThe shop contained practical joke objects, such as Extendable Ears, a Reusable Hangman, Skiving Snackboxes, and Fred and George's special WonderWitch products, such as Love Potions, Ten-Second Pimple Vanishers, and Pygmy Puffs. There was also a section of Muggle Magic Tricks, which were said to have done steady business, despite not being big sellers. The shop also sold a number of defensive magical objects.[1]\n\nThis establishment started out as an 'owl-post service' led by the twins from the Burrow, and later continued from Hogwarts, selling joke-products until the store front was opened.\n\nThe shop was the Weasley twins' dream. The seed money for the shop was Harry Potter's Triwizard Tournament 1,000 galleon winnings.[3]\n\nThe first official premises of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes was at 93 Diagon Alley.[1] The shop's exterior was bright and attention grabbing, when compared to the shops that surrounded it.\n\nIn 1997, the founders, Fred and George Weasley were known to be looking at buying Zonko's Joke Shop after it closed.[4] However, due to various complications such as Fred's death and the return of Voldemort, it is unclear if this purchase was made.\n\nWhile still students at Hogwarts, Fred and George were inspired to develop a number of practical joke products. They initially developed these products in their room at The Burrow. Their initial efforts were sold as mail-order items using owl post. Their mother discovered the orders while cleaning their room one day. She didn't support their wild ambitions, considering that most of the products that they'd created were dangerous. She also wished them to get jobs in the Ministry of Magic, like their father.[5] Even though she burned the orders, her twin sons still maintained their ambition to open a joke shop.\n\nTo raise money for their shop they bet their life's savings with Ludo Bagman, on the outcome of the Quidditch World Cup. They won, but Bagman paid them off with Leprechaun gold, which vanished after a few hours, wiping out their savings and putting their dream in peril.[3]\n\nLuckily, the twins got the money for the shop through Harry Potter's unwanted Triwizard Tournament winnings of 1,000 Galleons, while the three were alone before disembarking the Hogwarts Express at Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. They reluctantly accepted the winnings only on his insistence, with his only requests being that they not tell Molly where the money came from, and to buy Ron new dress robes without mentioning Harry's name. Since Harry gave them their start-up loan, after establishing their storefront Fred and George in turn insisted that he help himself to whatever he wanted, free of charge.[3]\n\nDuring their last and unfinished year at Hogwarts, Fred and George tested many of their products on fellow students, wishing to determine if everyone responded the same to their products. Gryffindor prefect Hermione Granger did not approve of this.[6] The twins apparently did not warn the younger students what the sweets would do.\n\nHermione was furious (while fellow prefect Ron Weasley refused to interfere) and she immediately told the twins and Lee off for experimenting on unsuspecting children. George and Lee tried to reassure her that it was not dangerous, while Fred claimed it was fine since they had paid their subjects, but Hermione insisted that they stop. Fred and George initially scoffed at her attempt to stop them, but immediately backed down when she threatened to tell their mother. Hermione was quite annoyed with Ron for not supporting her in standing up to the twins.[7]\n\nAfter releasing their Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs and Portable Swamp on school grounds and defecting from Hogwarts in order to rebel against Dolores Umbridge's tyrannical rule, the twins left to fulfil their dreams of opening a joke shop.[8]\n\nPrior to their departure, they offered a discount for any Hogwarts students who would swear to use their products to eliminate Umbridge.[8] Fred and George gave Peeves final instructions just before they left the school. Peeves saluted the twins, this was possibly the first time he had knowingly and willingly obeyed a Hogwarts student.[8]\n\nArgus Filch banned all of Fred and George's products from Hogwarts in 1996. However, as no one paid much attention to things Filch banned, this had little effect. The Triwizard Tournament winnings allowed them to purchase a storefront in Diagon Alley shortly after leaving Hogwarts in April 1996, employing a shop assistant named Verity.\n\nThey also intended to buy Zonko's Joke Shop in Hogsmeade in order to extend their business.[1] However, because of Hogwarts security being raised to the point that all Hogsmeade trips were cancelled,[9] they saw no point to this. However, they did start selling love potions by Owl Order disguised as cough potions, as Argus Filch couldn’t recognise one potion from the other.[10]\n\nThe twins were strict with their businesses, as they threatened a boy for attempted shoplifting and charged their younger brother Ron full price for all the products. However, they allowed Harry to take anything he wanted for free, as he was their investor.[1] They also accepted patronage from Draco Malfoy (whom they hated), allowing him to buy Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, which he would use against Dumbledore's Army later, something Ron would resent the twins for.[11] Their mother, despite not initially approving their dream, was glad to see they managed to make such success and joy in their career.\n\nAlthough much of their products were meant for fun and games, when the Ministry bought 500 Shield Hats for staff protection, the twins decided to expand their products to a more serious line of Defence Against the Dark Arts, as many bureaucratic employees could not cast so much as a decent Shield Charm. They also made a mockery of Lord Voldemort by placing one of their product's slogan on the front window: U-No-Poo, which led their mother to fear for their lives, but Ron to laugh.[1]\n\nIn 1996 the store was packed with customers. When Harry visited he could not get near the shelves. In the summer of 1997, the Death Eaters seized control of the British Ministry of Magic.\n\nIn the spring of 1998, it was discovered that the Weasleys had been helping the fugitive Harry Potter, and the family went into hiding. Although forced to close the shop in Diagon Alley, Fred and George continued to sell their products via mail order while at their Aunt Muriel's.[12] Fred and George both fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, where Fred was killed in an explosion whilst fighting alongside Percy Weasley.[13]\n\nGeorge continued to operate the business after Fred's death, despite never fully getting over the loss of his twin.[14] Two years after Ron became an Auror, he left the job, stating that he wanted to help his brother George with a shop he had always loved. Already a highly successful emporium, together they were able to turn Weasley's Wizard Wheezes into an even more gigantic money-spinner.[14]\n\nBy December 2010, some of the products invented for Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes including Boxing telescope, Fever Fudge, and the Electric Shock Shake, were also being sold at Zonko's Joke Shop.[15]\n\nThe shop was filled with boxes that were piled to the ceiling. When entering the shop the boxes that were in sight were the Skiving Snackboxes.[1] The Nosebleed Nougat were the most popular, only one battered box was left on the shelf. Within sight of the door on the way to the counter were bins full of trick wands. Near the trick wands there was boxes of quills.[1]\n\nThere were reusable hangmen located at the counter. Patented Daydream Charms were a large display near the counter. The WonderWitch products were near the daydream charms next to the window.[1] The WonderWitch products were a array of violently pink products that attracted the attention of girls. A cage of Pygmy Puffs was located there as well.[1]\n\nTowards the back of the shop was a stand of Muggle magic tricks. Near the Muggle magic tricks was a tub labelled edible dark marks. The more serious products that focused on Defence Against the Dark Arts were located in the back behind a certain out of sight.[1] The packaging on these products were more subdued and less flashy.[1]\n\nOwl Order Service was used by various business in order to deliver their products to buyers. The Daily Prophet used this service to deliver their newspapers and so does Weasley's Wizard Wheezes to deliver a wide range of products. The twins would send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions.[10]\n\nFred and George Weasley did this in order to smuggle banned items from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. They did this under the nose of caretaker Argus Filch, disguising the products as perfumes and cough potions.[10] Information regarding this service was explained on the back of the WonderWitch products the twins showed Hermione Granger and their sister Ginny in the summer of 1996.[1]\n\nAll employees at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes wore a magenta robe. Harry Potter noted that these robes clashed magnificently with Fred and George's red hair.[1]",
