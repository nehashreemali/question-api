  "content": "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, often shortened to Hogwarts, was the British wizarding school located in the Scottish Highlands.[6][7] Founded in the 10th century, Hogwarts was regarded as one of the finest institutions of magic in the wizarding world, alongside other notable schools including Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, the Durmstrang Institute and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, among others collectively forming the eleven long-established and prestigious wizarding schools worldwide.[4]\n\nAny magical children residing in Great Britain or Ireland who had reached the age of eleven by the start of the incoming term were accepted as students.[8][9] They were registered by the Quill of Acceptance and Book of Admittance when they first displayed magical ability,[10] and their acceptance was confirmed by owl post at age eleven. However, if the child in question was Muggle-born or raised by Muggles, like Harry Potter, with no knowledge of the wizarding world, a special messenger from the school visited the child and his or her family to inform them of their magical heritage and the existence of the wizarding world.[11] It was also possible for students to transfer to the school.\n\nThe precise location of the school could never be uncovered because it was rendered Unplottable. To Muggles, the school appeared to be an old, abandoned castle. Similarly, most wizarding schools' locations were protected in order to protect the students and schools themselves from any harm.[4] It was a state-owned school, funded by the British Ministry of Magic.[12]\n\nThe school's motto was Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus (Draco Dormiens Nvnqvam Titillandvs), which, translated from Latin, means \"Never tickle a sleeping dragon\".\n\nHogwarts School, located somewhere in the Highlands of Scotland, consisted of the large Hogwarts Castle and extensive school grounds surrounding it, which included sloping lawns, flowerbeds, vegetable patches, as well as a loch (called the Black Lake), a large dense forest (called the Forbidden Forest), several greenhouses and other outbuildings, and a full-size Quidditch Pitch. One of the castle's towers held an owlery, which housed all the owls owned by the school and by students.\n\nThe castle was set upon huge rocks above the Black Lake. Its three highest towers were the Astronomy, Ravenclaw, and Gryffindor Towers. The castle's 142 staircases were known to change position. The castle was known for its many updates and changes in layout throughout the years. It should be noted that some rooms in the school tended to \"move around\", as did the steps on the Grand Staircase. Albus Dumbledore once noted that even he did not know all of Hogwarts' secrets. The castle had been around for centuries, and consequently had a long history of ancient magic.\n\nThe school had numerous ancient charms and spells on and around it to safeguard it from danger. In addition to the fact that there were enchantments that prevented people from entering by stealth, it  was also impossible for a Muggle to see it, as the school was bewitched so that when they looked at it, all they saw were some old ruins and several warnings of danger. Witches and wizards could not Apparate or Disapparate in Hogwarts grounds, except for when the Headmaster lifted the enchantment, whether only in certain areas or for the entire campus, so as to make the school less vulnerable when it served the headmaster to allow Apparition. Electricity and electronic devices were not found at Hogwarts. Due to the high levels of magic, Muggle substitutes for magic, such as computers, radar and electricity, \"went haywire\" around Hogwarts. Radios, however, were an exception as they were not powered by electricity, but by magic.\n\nHogwarts was founded around 990 A.D. by four of the greatest wizards and witches of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.[13] They each represented an aspect of personality that they wanted to bring out in new students.[14]\n\nIt is a popular historical theory that the location and name of Hogwarts were both chosen by Rowena, who had a dream about a warty hog leading her to a cliff by the lake, the location where the school would later be built.[15] Legend also said that when the founders arrived at that location in the waking world, they discovered a Pensieve, a very rare and powerful magical object, half buried in the dirt. Supposedly another reason why they chose that location.[16]\n\nWhen the castle was built, they placed a multitude of Charms, including certain protective enchantments to ensure the well-being of their students, for which reason the castle and grounds had both always been protected with Anti-Apparition Charms.[7] Rowena also came up with the ever-changing floor plan.[17]\n\nAround the same time the school was constructed, the four founders employed the school's first caretaker, Hankerton Humble, who would often clash with Peeves, the resident poltergeist, which he would have in common with every successive caretaker after him in the history of Hogwarts.[18]\n\nFor a time, the four founders cooperated quite harmoniously, however, shortly after founding the school, Salazar Slytherin had a falling out with the other founders. It began when Slytherin desired to teach his students the Dark Arts, which the other founders disapproved of. As a result Slytherin constructed the Chamber of Secrets deep beneath the school, intended as a place where he could teach his students.[19] Later on, Slytherin’s relationship with the others was further strained over his views about blood purity. He wanted the school to be more selective and admit only pure-blood students. He felt only pure-blooded students deserved to learn magic, and those of other ancestry such as Muggle-borns and half-bloods were unworthy. The other three founders all strongly disagreed, especially Gryffindor. Slytherin, unable to sway the others, left the school, but not before repurposing the Chamber of Secrets. He foretold that only his own true heir would be able to open it once they arrived at the school, and the heir would unleash a murderous basilisk living inside to purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.[13]\n\nDespite the fact that the founders of Hogwarts were effectively in charge of the school during their time, none of them held the title of Headmaster or Headmistress of the school,[20] as that was only used sometime after Slytherin's departure, and held by another wizard, who was the first person to be entrusted the stewardship of Hogwarts Castle and the surrounding grounds after the three remaining founders passed away.[21]\n\nThe first student class to graduate from the school were immortalised in a portrait that would continue to hang in the school for over 1000 years.[22]\n\nAccording to the eventual Gryffindor House ghost, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, because Hogwarts Castle was always intended as a safe place, the school had historically shouldered the responsibility of protecting \"dangerous things\" from falling into the wrong hands, and carrying the burden of the job remarkably well despite the fact that subsequent heads of the school and members of the faculty came to recognise how it compromised the security of the castle.[23] Indeed: Albus Dumbledore would reiterate this truth to Harry Potter years later during their private lessons into the history of Lord Voldemort, when the then Headmaster described Hogwarts Castle as \"a stronghold of ancient magic\", and explained that his refusal to employ him as a teacher stemmed in part from the suspicion that the Dark wizard would unravel more of its mysteries and take advantage of untapped stores of magic within the school for his own, nefarious purposes.[24]\n\nAbout three hundred years after the school was founded, the Triwizard Tournament was established as an interscholastic competition between three of the most prestigious magical schools in Europe: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons (France) and Durmstrang (an unknown Northern European country). This tournament was considered the best way for wizards and witches of different nationalities to meet and socialise. The tournament continued for six centuries, until the death toll became too high. The tournament was discontinued until 1994.[25]\n\nAt some point in the 13th century, following the invention of Floo powder by Ignatia Wildsmith and the subsequent development of the Floo Network, a long line of Heads of the school refused to permit the school's fireplaces to be accessible this way, for fear of the castle's security could be breached.[26] However, by the 19th century, a network of Floo Flames had been set up that allowed students to quickly travel both within the castle, or between the inside and outside.[27]\n\nIn the Tudor period, four professors of the school, Percival Rackham, Charles Rookwood, Niamh Fitzgerald and San Bakar, formed the Keepers dedicated to keeping the secrets of ancient magic away from dangerous forces.[28] They welcomed Isidora Morganach to the school as a new student who started unconventionally as a fifth-year and learnt that she had the rare abilities of detecting and harnessing ancient magic.[29]\n\nProfessor Rackham, a wizard with similar abilities, mentored her to wield and master this power, but after becoming the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor,[30] Isidora ultimately went down a different path in which she used her abilities to extract pain from others,[31] sometimes even without their permission,[32] till the point where she ridded her father of all emotions, creating an ancient magic repository stored in the Keepers' Caverns. The Keepers disapproved of her actions and faced her in a duel, ending in Professor Bakar eliminating Isidora with the Killing Curse.[33] They then constructed a path leading to their portraits in the Map Chamber which might only be followed by another with abilities of ancient magic, and set up trials around the castle to make sure that their successor would be worthy of the power and make the right choices.[28]\n\nDuring the 1700s, there was a proposal to install an elaborate plumbing system in the castle. This threatened the secrecy of the Chamber of Secrets, forcing Corvinus Gaunt, a Slytherin student, descendant of Salazar Slytherin and Parselmouth, to protect the entrance to the Chamber by having it concealed behind plumbing fixtures and sinks in second-floor girls' bathroom, so only future heirs of Slytherin would know how to open the Chamber.[34]\n\nIn 1876, then caretaker Rancorous Carpe made a spectacularly unsuccessful attempt to rid the school of Peeves by trying to bait him into a trap involving a wide variety of Muggle weapons and a vast, enchanted bell jar reinforced with various Containment Charms, which resulted in the evacuation of the castle and a three-day standoff between the vengeful poltergeist and then Headmistress Eupraxia Mole. In the end, the good professor agreed to sign a contract promising him additional privileges, including weekly swim in the boys' toilets on the ground floor, pickings of stale bread from the kitchen for throwing purposes and a new hat — to be custom-made by the Parisian witch Madame Bonhabille. After this, Carpe went into early retirement for \"health reasons\"[35] and was succeeded by Gladwin Moon.[36] The faculty didn't attempt to evict the poltergeist again,[35] though he still had a strained relationship with them, notably Madam Agnes Scribner, the librarian, who had Peeves as her \"sworn nemesis\",[37] and Professor Phineas Nigellus Black, who at some point had taken over as the least popular Headmaster the school had seen[38] and was often tormented by Peeves.[39]\n\nIn 1889, Mudiwa Onai travelled from Uagadou to Hogwarts to teach Divination, bringing her daughter Natsai Onai to the school.[40] The spring of 1890 saw the injury of a pure-blood[41] student during the Quidditch final, leading to Professor Black banning Quidditch in the next school year.[42]\n\nThat year, a new student would arrive at the school who, like Isidora Morganach, would begin as a fifth-year. Professor Black and the Deputy Headmistress Matilda Weasley worked with the Ministry to devise a plan for the student to ensure their success.[42] They were personally mentored by Professor Eleazar Fig to hone their magical skills, and, through their unexpected detour while travelling to Hogwarts, showed abilities of ancient magic.[43] After enrolling, they successfully reached the Map Chamber,[44] whereupon they completed all four of the Keepers' trials.[30][31][32][33] Their time at Hogwarts coincided with the goblin Ranrok's pursuit of the power within the ancient magic repositories,[45] during which an uneasy alliance was formed between Ranrok and the Dark wizard Victor Rookwood.[31]\n\nAfter vanquishing Rookwood,[46] the student faced Ranrok in a final battle in the Keepers' Caverns aided by the faculty, and ended his rebellion. However, it also saw the death of Professor Fig, for whom the school held a memorial ceremony.[47] During this time, the student also joined their classmates Natsai Onai and Poppy Sweeting in taking down Theophilus Harlow,[48] Rookwood's right-hand man,[49] and thwarting the plots of poachers,[50] respectively. The student also helped Sebastian Sallow with finding a cure for his sister Anne Sallow, which ended in failure.[51]\n\nIn the 1910s, Leta Lestrange was bullied at Hogwarts due to the gossip about her being an unwanted child and the tragic death of her half-brother. She encountered Newt Scamander while searching for a place to hide from her pursuers, whom she had used the dark charm Oscausi on in retaliation for their malicious gossip. Newt and Leta developed a remarkably close bond, spending much time together over the holidays caring for an injured baby raven.[52]\n\nAt one point, when Albus Dumbledore was teaching students how to defend against Boggarts in Defence Against the Dark Arts class, Newt was asked to step forward and was revealed that he was scared of ending up stuck with a tedious office job. Leta went soon after and showed that her boggart was her half-brother drowning to death. Leta was later comforted by Newt near the Great Lake, when she was upset by her own Boggart. He show her one of the Bowtruckles he had befriended on the school grounds, because he was the only one they would not hide from.[52]\n\nOn 29 November 1926, the Daily Prophet reported that security had to be increased at Hogwarts in response to the growing threat of Gellert Grindelwald's impact on the Global Wizarding War. Measures included Headmaster Armando Dippet holding an emergency meeting with worried parents and students being sent home early.[53]\n\nTorquil Travers and Theseus Scamander came here to seek out the current Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Albus Dumbledore and talk to him about Grindelwald and his plans. Leta soon after walks around Hogwarts and reminisces on the past. Dumbledore finds her and they talk about their shared trauma of losing their siblings.[52]\n\nNewton Scamander, Porpentina Goldstein, Theseus Scamander, Torquil Travers, Rudolph Spielman, Nagini, Jacob Kowalski, Yusuf Kama, and an unidentified Ministry man came back to talk to Albus Dumbledore about Grindelwald's rally and the blood pact Grindelwald made with Dumbledore.[52]\n\nEven during the Global Wizarding War, Hogwarts was kept open and live, running and allowing students to attend.[54]\n\nThe existence of the school was threatened twice when the Chamber of Secrets was opened. The first time it was opened was in 1942, when Slytherin house pupil Tom Riddle, a direct descendant of Salazar Slytherin and the man who would become Lord Voldemort, opened the Chamber in his fifth year.[55]\n\nWhen a girl named Myrtle Warren was killed in 1943, the Ministry of Magic threatened to close the school. As Riddle spent his time away from Hogwarts in a Muggle orphanage, he did not want the school closed. His request to remain in school over the holidays was denied due to the situation he created. Upset with himself, he framed Rubeus Hagrid, and although Albus Dumbledore still suspected Riddle, Hagrid was expelled, and Riddle got off without punishment. He, however would leave a cursed diary which would allow him to possess anyone who used it in order to reopen the Chamber and continue the heinous work. It was only after the 1992-1993 reopening that Riddle's crime was exposed and Hagrid was exonerated.[55]\n\nThroughout the entirety of the First Wizarding War, which lasted for eleven long years and caused much distress among the students, Hogwarts Castle was perhaps the only safe haven in wizarding Britain, due to the presence of Albus Dumbledore. Dumbledore had risen to the post of Headmaster, and was the only one whom Voldemort was ever afraid of.[56]\n\nDuring that time, Severus Snape, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, as well as Lily Potter and James Potter attended Hogwarts and four of them were part of the infamous Marauders, who often bullied Snape frequently,[57] until they graduated in 1978.\n\nWhile war waged outside the ancient walls of the school and it remained safe from Dark Forces outside the castle, the existence of ancient threats hidden deep within it began to stir when a student by the name of Jacob became intrigued with and began to search for the fabled Cursed Vaults, five secret rooms of ambiguous origins somewhere within the castle said to house ancient magical treasures older even than the school itself.[citation needed]\n\nJacob grew increasingly obsessed with his quest to prove the existence of the Cursed Vaults throughout his school career and broke several school rules in his effort to locate them. The situation escalated further as when the pupil finally found it, he examined the outer chamber leading to the vault and, as a result of tampering with magic he did not understand, he inadvertently unleashed a curse that threatened to encase the entire castle in ice, injuring several students in the process.[citation needed]\n\nBy that point, Jacob's quests for the vaults were no secret. Rumours began spreading among the student body that he unleashed several curses upon the school, and even was cursed himself and that he eventually went mad. Ultimately, however, Jacob managed to break into the vault itself, causing the ice to vanish. Despite his part in ending the threat, however, he was found to have endangered the school, as he unleashed the threat in the first place. Jacob's resultant expulsion from Hogwarts was covered in the Daily Prophet.[58]\n\nWith the cursed ice gone from the halls of Hogwarts and his students once more safe from it, Dumbledore and the rest of the school staff did their best to dim the rumours that Jacob had actually located one of the vaults, treating it as an isolated incident that had more to do with Jacob's search for the Cursed Vaults rather than the vaults themselves. They hoped to discourage others from looking for them and maintain the common view that they were just a myth. This worked so effectively that while people still spoke of it a long time afterwards, no one, not even Jacob's own mother, believed that the Cursed Vaults actually existed.[citation needed]\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, Lord Voldemort's ascendancy was almost complete. While the Ministry of Magic did their best to both put up a fight and keep wizardkind a secret, a true resistance to him was being concentrated in the underground organisation founded by Dumbledore himself called the Order of the Phoenix. Several former students at the school went on to join the order.[citation needed]\n\nOn Hallowe'en of the 1981–1982 school year, news would have reached the school of the fall of Lord Voldemort and his failed attempt at murdering the infant Harry Potter, after which students and staff alike would have celebrated the fall of the Dark Lord.[citation needed]\n\nThe effects of the Cursed Vaults resurfaced around Hogwarts after the end of the war. It first started with the cursed ice reappearing in Hogwarts castle during the 1984–1985 school year. By that time, Jacob's younger sibling had enrolled, and it took two years for they and their friends to locate and break into the Vault of Ice and stop the ice from further spreading.[59] The rest of the Cursed Vaults had subsequently all been tampered with, contaminating the school respectively with Boggarts,[60] the sleepwalking curse[61] and the portrait curse,[62] but thanks to Jacob's sibling and their continually growing circle of friends, the next three Vaults were successfully infiltrated in three consecutive school years.[63][64][65]\n\nDuring this time, it was gradually revealed to Jacob's sibling and their friends that a secret dark organisation known as R existed and had also been trying to find the Cursed Vaults for the supposed treasures. At the start of Jacob's sibling's fourth year, the 1987–1988 school year, Patricia Rakepick arrived at Hogwarts apparently to help Albus Dumbledore deal with the Cursed Vaults,[61] while in fact being a Dark witch from R who sought to continue her unfinished business with the Vaults. She became the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor the next year and trained several students, including Jacob's sibling, to be her curse-breaking assistants. Arriving again outside the Buried Vault, she revealed her true nature to the students and attempted to go in before them, but was magically choked by Jacob's sibling and fled.[65]\n\nRakepick's ability to teach students to defend against the Dark Arts, ironically, turned out to have been a lot more competent than the professor who succeeded her in the next school year. With Dumbledore's permission, the fresh graduate Bill Weasley returned to the school to teach this subject after regular classes.[66] During the school year, yet another curse spread around Hogwarts, continuing to Petrify students, indicating the activity of the final Cursed Vault.[67] While working towards investigating R, the students encountered Rakepick in the Forest Grove, who attempted to kill Ben Copper, leading to the sacrifice of Rowan Khanna.[68]\n\nThe school staff held a memorial ceremony and suspended the lessons,[69] and the tragedy prompted the vengeful Jacob's sibling, Ben Copper and Merula Snyde to form a secret organisation of their own, the Circle of Khanna, to fight R and race them in locating the final Cursed Vault.[70] It was found to be under the Great Lake, and they had a final showdown with Rakepick outside. She was once again defeated before Jacob's sibling decided to seal the Vault for good to prevent the ancient statue curse from being unleashed again.[71]\n\nOn 1 September 1991, Harry Potter began his career as a student at Hogwarts. Already famous for being believed to be responsible for vanquishing Lord Voldemort at the age of one, he soon began, with the help of his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, to unravel the secret of the Philosopher's Stone being kept at the school. Harry discovered that the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, Quirinus Quirrell, was a host body for the barely-alive Voldemort, who wanted to use the Stone to restore himself back to his former glory and gain everlasting life.[1]\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione suffered a series of difficult challenges down in the Underground Chambers, in an attempt to stop the Philosopher's Stone being stolen by Severus Snape. The three believed Snape was trying to steal the stone, when in reality, Quirrell was. Harry discovered Quirrell in the chambers and was able to defeat him, thwarting Voldemort in his attempt to get the Stone and restoring his body. Harry managed this after realising that Quirrell's skin burned whenever he made contact with Harry. Dumbledore stated that Lily's self sacrifice left a mark of love in Harry and that Quirrell was so full of hatred, greed, and ambition that he could not bear to touch a person marked by something so good.[1]\n\nIn 1992, the Chamber of Secrets was re-opened by Ron's younger sister Ginny, under the influence of Tom Riddle's diary. The diary allowed Riddle's memory to possess Ginny and act through her to open the Chamber for a second time. She left threatening messages on the school walls twice, which were known as the Writing on the Wall. Several students were Petrified due to meeting the Serpent of Slytherin's gaze indirectly. Quidditch matches were largely cancelled. Towards the end of the school year, the situation at the school was so severe that it was possible for the school to be shut down completely.[55]\n\nDesiring to see Lord Voldemort return to power, Lucius Malfoy had slipped the diary into her bundle of school books, taking advantage of her ignorance that it was a Horcrux. His ulterior motive was to ruin the reputations of several great wizards, including Dumbledore and the Weasley children's father Arthur Weasley, the latter of whom played a big role in the enactment of the Muggle Protection Act. However, Harry discovered the truth and destroyed the diary and the Basilisk, thus bringing an end to these dark plots.[55]\n\nIn 1993, Harry's notorious godfather Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban. Sirius had been convicted of murdering twelve Muggles and Peter Pettigrew with the Blasting Curse. He also betrayed James, Lily, and Harry Potter's whereabouts to Voldemort in his duty as their Secret-Keeper. Because of the charges against him, he spent twelve years in a high-security cell in Azkaban. The Ministry of Magic also believed that Black was after Harry, as they heard Black murmur \"he's at Hogwarts\" in his sleep. As a result, Black was thought to believe that killing Harry would bring Voldemort back to full power.[72]\n\nBlack broke into the school twice: one time almost ripping the Fat Lady to shreds, and another time getting close to Ron's \"rat\", Scabbers. During the second break-in, Ron awoke, which resulted in him screaming in fright, as Black loomed over him with a knife. His screams woke the whole tower and alerted McGonagall to the incident. After this incident, security measures were further heightened. Harry, Ron, and Hermione met Black in the Shrieking Shack, along with Remus Lupin. Lupin had been a friend of Black as well as Harry's parents and Pettigrew during the time they attended Hogwarts as a students.[72]\n\nBlack revealed the truth to them. He was innocent, and it was Pettigrew who had done the things Sirius had been convicted of. To frame Sirius, he had chopped off one of his fingers as a red herring, turned into his Animagus form (the rat, Scabbers), and scurried off. Sirius had come back to kill Pettigrew, and now that Lupin had heard his story, he believed him and set out to help.[72]\n\nHowever, Harry persuaded them to give Pettigrew to the Ministry and let the Dementors have him. As they took Pettigrew back to the castle, Pettigrew escaped and returned to Voldemort to help him return to power. With the use of a time-turner, Harry and Hermione later helped Sirius escape on Buckbeak the Hippogriff while Ron was in the Hospital Wing, saving both Sirius' and Buckbeak's lives.[72]\n\nIn 1994, Hogwarts played host to the infamous Triwizard Tournament, this time with more powerful safety measures in place. It had been many years since the last tournament had been held, but in the light of the advent of advanced safety measures, the tournament was deemed \"safe\". However, more dark plots were being hatched. Barty Crouch Jnr, disguised as Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, managed to enter Harry in the Tournament by putting his name in the Goblet of Fire under the name of a fourth school, which ensured he would be chosen by the Goblet.[25]\n\nHarry's forced involvement in this plot caused him great misery at Hogwarts, as the representatives for Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, as well as many Hogwarts students, believed he hoodwinked the goblet and entered himself in the tournament. It was because of Crouch Jnr and his influence over certain house-elves that Harry ended up surviving until the end of the tournament and reaching the goal of the Third Task, along with fellow Hogwarts student Cedric Diggory. On Voldemort's orders, Diggory was killed by Pettigrew, and Harry was surrounded by Death Eaters in Little Hangleton graveyard. Voldemort was brought back to his physical form using Harry's blood.[25]\n\nVoldemort attempted to torture and humiliate Harry by means of the Unforgivable Curses. He used the Cruciatus Curse twice on Harry and the Imperius Curse once; Harry was able to resist the latter. Harry escaped and succeeded in alerting all of Voldemort's enemies, Dumbledore in particular, that he had returned. Dumbledore reestablished the Order of the Phoenix one hour after he was alerted. However, many, including Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, chose not to believe him.[25]\n\nHogwarts was further threatened when the Ministry of Magic began implementing \"Educational Decrees\" in 1995, as part of a conspiracy to discredit and ruin Dumbledore and Harry. Dolores Umbridge, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher and Minister Fudge's Undersecretary, was the centre of this plan.\n\nBy way of these Educational Decrees, she slowly took control of Hogwarts, eventually replacing Dumbledore as Headmistress. However, it was through the cunning of Hermione and the other members of Dumbledore's Army, which was founded by her, Ron, and Harry, that Umbridge was overthrown. The Ministry had no choice but to accept that Voldemort had returned. Umbridge was then removed from Hogwarts and Dumbledore was reinstated.[73]\n\nThrough the 1996–1997 school year, the new Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour ordered Aurors to guard Hogwarts for protection from Dark forces, along with the castle's defences being fortified in many ways. In 1997, Hogwarts was attacked by a mob of Death Eaters. Lucius Malfoy's son Draco was forced into the service of Lord Voldemort for fear of his and his family's lives.\n\nAs a result, Headmaster Dumbledore's safety was compromised, and he was killed by Severus Snape, in a secret coup de grace arranged in advance between them. Following this \"horrible\" tragedy, Professor Minerva McGonagall was appointed acting Headmistress, though the security of the school hung by a thread. There was no certainty that Hogwarts would remain open. The faculty agreed to follow \"established procedures\" and let the school governors ultimately decide what to do.\n\nThroughout the year students were taken out of school by their families for safety and fear reasons, such as Eloise Midgen and Hannah Abbott, while two of Draco's botched attempts to assassinate Dumbledore ended up dangerously harming Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley, which only served in increasing the anxiety in the atmosphere. However, when Draco succeeded in allowing the Death Eaters entrance, the full effect came to be when many parents rushed their children home, fearing that even Hogwarts, reputably the safest location in the wizarding world, was no longer safe from Voldemort.[56]\n\nRegardless of the school governors' decision, with the takeover of the Ministry by Voldemort, attendance at Hogwarts was mandatory for all eligible children. New, militaristic requirements were established, such as requiring students to provide proof of blood status. This enabled Voldemort to keep an eye on the entire wizarding world from a young age and identify Muggle-borns, including eleven-year old children who have no knowledge of their magical nature before their forced identification. Such youngsters faced the possibility of never entering Hogwarts nor returning to their homes ever again.[74]\n\nAcademic instruction at Hogwarts became corrupted. Muggle Studies became a required subject, and instruction in it took a new tack with an anti-Muggle bias, while Defence Against the Dark Arts had simply become Dark Arts. Students were taught illegal curses outright, with older students being instructed to practise curses on underclassmen. Snape was appointed Headmaster, and Alecto and Amycus Carrow, teachers of Muggle Studies and Dark Arts, respectively, had been assigned as his deputies. It was a time of great terror in which no one could be certain who was friend or foe.[74] Unknown to many, Snape was secretly aiding the Order and the resistance, and stopped the Carrows from inflicting inhumane punishments on erring students.\n\nIn May 1998, the Battle of Hogwarts took place as one of its most infamous alumni, Tom Riddle, better known by then as Lord Voldemort, returned to attack the school and subdue or destroy its defenders. Voldemort claimed he had no desire to harm the school or its students, but he and his Death Eaters spared no one who opposed them and recklessly damaged the school during their assault.[74]\n\nNumerous students, staff, parents, graduates, and friends of Hogwarts rose to the school's defence in its hour of need, including the notorious poltergeist Peeves. Thanks to Harry Potter, Lord Voldemort was permanently destroyed and his Death Eaters disbanded forever. Minerva McGonagall became the Headmistress of the school. Harry was celebrated as a true hero.[74]\n\nHogwarts sustained extensive damage during the battle. Multiple areas of the main building and adjacent areas were set on fire or blown up, and the Quidditch pitch was largely destroyed by fire.[74]\n\nAfter the battle, Hogwarts was repaired. Some students, such as Hermione Granger, returned to the school in 1998 to complete their education.\n\nTen years after the Battle of Hogwarts,[75] normal school life had resumed with Minerva McGonagall still as Headmistress and Rubeus Hagrid still as the Care of Magical Creatures professor and Keeper of Keys and Grounds, and Neville Longbottom had become the Herbology professor and the Head of Gryffindor House.[76]\n\nIn 2009, Jakub Gorski came to the school as the visiting History of Magic professor with his lemur \"assistant\" Bly, who later turned out to be an Animagus who had bewitched Gorski with the Imperius Curse as a part of his search of the Turner family heirloom. A group of students, including Lottie Turner herself, found out the truth during the school year and foiled Bly's attempt to use Lottie to obtain the heirloom.[76]\n\nDuring the 2010–2011 school year, Elspeth MacGillony was appointed the subtitute Study of Ancient Runes professor while Clodagh Dromgoole was on leave. Her real motive in returning to the school, however, was to find the crown of courage in the Great Lake, and she used the Imperius Curse on several students to make them find it for her. This was discovered by Headmistress McGonagall in time, and MacGillony was sacked and arrested.[76]\n\nIn the time that followed, Dementors attacked Hogwarts. At first there were minor-scale attacks, which the staff handled in time, but things took a turn for the worse when the Dementors summoned other dark creatures to fight for them. Headmistress McGonagall assembled the staff and put a magical shield around the castle to block the creatures. They managed to breach the shield regardless, which then led to a big battle.[76]\n\nBy 2017, many descendants of previous students were now coming to Hogwarts as new pupils, such as Albus Potter, Scorpius Malfoy and Rose Granger-Weasley. In their fourth year in 2020, Albus and Scorpius illegally used a Time-Turner to travel back in time and caused the timeline to deviate, therefore witnessing several alternate versions of Hogwarts in the early 2020s, including a version with only minor differences from the original one, and versions in which Dolores Umbridge was the Head in a world where Voldemort had won the Battle of Hogwarts. Nevertheless, they were eventually successful in correcting the timeline and restoring peace to Hogwarts.[5]\n\nTerm began on 1 September. Students usually reached Hogwarts via the Hogwarts Express, which left Platform 9¾ of London's King's Cross Station at 11 a.m. sharp.[1] There seemed to be other ways of entering the school, such as via broomsticks or Floo Powder, or simply Apparating to a nearby location such as Hogsmeade. Missing the Hogwarts Express for any reason was a very serious problem, but would not cost the student points as long as they got there before the term had officially started.[55] The Hogwarts Express brought the students to Hogsmeade Station. First years traditionally crossed the Black Lake in boats with the gamekeeper, travelling under an opening in the rocks upon which Hogwarts was built, through a curtain of ivy, and finally into an underground harbour.[1]\n\nOlder students travelled on the road in carriages pulled by Thestrals (invisible to any that hadn't witnessed death) to the castle.[73] The Start-of-Term Feast took place in the Great Hall. This feast included the Sorting Ceremony, followed by a few words from the current Headmaster or Headmistress. The banquet started after this, including large quantities of food and drink. The feast was closed with a few more words from the Headmaster or headmistress, including the usual \"start-of-term notices\".[1]\n\nAfter dinner, students were led to their house common room by a prefect. This was a special time for new students to get comfortable with their surroundings, because the next day classes would begin. The class schedules were handed out during breakfast by the Heads of House. After two weeks of classes, the Quidditch team trials and flying lessons for the first years usually occured.[1]\n\nHomework was usually assigned to students at the end of classes or at the end of the school term. It was usually completed by students in the Study Hall, Study Area, library, Gryffindor Tower reading room or another common room. A homework planner, a Shouting Schedule for instance, could be used to help students to keep track of all their homework assignments. Some magical planners also told the students to complete the homework when it was opened. If a student failed to complete the homework or was late in handing it in, they could be given a detention as a punishment.[1]\n\nHogwarts's school year was structured in a similar way to other non-magical schools and colleges in the UK, with a three-term year punctuated by holidays at Christmas and Easter and bounded by the long summer holiday of nine weeks. Students had the option of staying at Hogwarts for the winter and spring holidays. Those who chose to stay at the castle during the Christmas holidays did not have lessons and attended a feast on Christmas Day. Students also did not have classes the week of Easter, but this was much less enjoyable due to the large amount of work the teachers usually assigned students at this time in preparation for final exams.[1]\n\nOther than the breaks and weekends, students did not receive holidays. However, students in the third year and above were allowed to visit Hogsmeade, the local village, occasionally.[72] There were normally four feasts per year: the Start-of-Term Feast at the beginning of the school year, End-of-Term Feast at the end of the school year, and feasts at Hallowe'en and Christmas.[1] Feasts were also called to mark special occasions, such as the beginning of the Triwizard Tournament.[25]\n\nClasses would proceed normally and the next notable event occurred on the evening of 31 October: the Hallowe'en feast. Decorations included giant pumpkins and flocks of hundreds of bats flying across the halls. The served foods included pumpkin treats, tarts, cakes and all sorts of magical sweets. The Quidditch season started usually with the first Quidditch match in the first weeks of November. In the second week of December, the Deputy Head would take names of those who would stay at Hogwarts over the Christmas holidays. The first term usually ended about a week before Christmas, and most of the students and some of the teachers went home by the school train.[1]\n\nIn the Triwizard Tournament years, the Yule Ball occurred on the evening of Christmas Day, ending at midnight.[25] On 25 December, a Christmas feast was held in the Great Hall. Shortly after 6 January (Epiphany aka Twelfth Night), the Hogwarts Express returned to Hogsmeade; the second term would begin. The exact dates of the beginning of the Easter holidays varied every year. During these holidays, the students could go home. The final exams were held the first week of June and the results came out on the second week. In the evening before the Hogwarts Express went back to London, the Leaving Feast was held, and outgoing students would partake in a graduation ceremony. The Hogwarts Express returned to London during the third week of June. Some staff and all of the students left Hogwarts for summer holidays.[1]\n\nThe motto of Hogwarts was: \"Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus\", translated as: Never tickle a sleeping dragon. Quidditch was possibly the most popular sport at the school, with most of the student body turning out to watch each match.[1] Hogwarts also had a Frog Choir which sang at special occasions.[77][78][79]\n\nThe blazon of the Hogwarts Coat of Arms clockwise from top left: the Gryffindor lion, the Slytherin serpent, the Ravenclaw eagle, and the Hufflepuff badger, all circling the letter 'H'. The motto, \"draco dormiens nunquam titillandus\", carried in an escroll beneath the shield. The way that the house mascots are arranged makes the centre line divide the houses with warm colours and mammalian mascots from the houses with cold colours and saurian mascots.[1]\n\nThere was an official school song, though it was only sung when the Headmaster was in a particularly good mood and deemed it appropriate (which is therefore why it was only known to have been commissioned once from 1991 to 1998).[3] It didn't seem to conform to the strict opinions of older Headmasters and Headmistresses, such as Armando Dippet. As such it may have been an invention of the relaxed Albus Dumbledore, and certainly sounded like it was of his invention.[80] There was no standard rhythm to the song. Everyone could sing it how they like, as such the Weasley twins preferred a slow and deep style. The lyrics are shown below:\n\nHogwarts was the most heavily haunted dwelling place in Britain (and this was against stiff competition, as there were more reported ghost sightings/sensings on these damp islands than anywhere else in the world). The castle was a congenial place for ghosts, because the living inhabitants treated their dead friends with tolerance and even affection, no matter how many times they had heard the same old reminiscences. Each of the four Hogwarts houses had its own ghost.[81]\n\nSlytherin boasted the Bloody Baron, who was covered in silver bloodstains. He was well known for being extremely unsocial and many students, including those of his own House, were known to be slightly afraid of him. While alive, he was a hot-tempered man. The least talkative of the house ghosts was the Grey Lady, who was long-haired and beautiful.[81] She was the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, making her the only house ghost who was directly related to one of the four Hogwarts founders.[87]\n\nHufflepuff house was haunted by the Fat Friar, who was executed because senior churchmen grew suspicious of his ability to cure the pox merely by poking peasants with a stick, and his ill-advised habit of pulling rabbits out of the communion cup. Though a genial character in general, the Fat Friar still resented the fact that he was never made a cardinal.[81] He also frequently suggested that Peeves be given a second chance, whether or not he deserved it.[3]\n\nGryffindor house was home to Nearly Headless Nick, who in life was Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington. Something of a snob, and a less accomplished wizard than he believed, Sir Nicholas lounged around the court of Henry VII in life, until his foolish attempt to beautify a lady-in-waiting by magic caused the unfortunate woman to sprout tusks. Sir Nicholas was stripped of his wand and inexpertly executed, leaving his head hanging off by a single flap of skin and sinew. His ghost retained a feeling of inadequacy with regard to truly headless ghosts.[81]\n\nAnother notable Hogwarts ghost was Moaning Myrtle, who haunted an unpopular girls' toilet. Myrtle was a student in Ravenclaw house at Hogwarts when she died, and she chose to return to school in perpetuity, with the short-term aim of haunting her arch-rival and bully, Olive Hornby. As the decades rolled by, Myrtle had made a name for herself as the most miserable ghost in school, and was usually found to be lurking inside one of the toilets and filling the tiled space with her moans and howls.[81]\n\nThe highest position of staff at Hogwarts was the Headmaster or Headmistress. There was also a Deputy Headmaster or Headmistress, who would take over responsibilities of the Headmaster should the circumstances demand it.[55][56]\n\nThe Headmaster or Headmistress was appointed by the Hogwarts Board of Governors[88] to oversee the safety and the day-to-day functioning of the school, and had the power to override any decision made by any other authoritative facilitator at the school.\n\nThe Deputy Headmaster or Deputy Headmistress (depending on gender) assisted the headmaster or headmistress in his or her duties. In the event of a headmaster or headmistress' incapacitation, the deputy also served as temporary head until the Board of Governors could select a new, permanent one.[56]\n\nHead of House was the title held by a Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was responsible for looking after the students in one of the four Houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin. It was possible for a Head of House to serve concurrently as Deputy Head, but not as Headmaster/Headmistress.[1]\n\nA veritable legion of house-elves were enlisted by Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. They worked the kitchens, preparing feasts for the entire school. They also moved trunks and baggage to and from rooms, cleaned dormitories, and presumably other areas of the castle as well.\n\nIn 1994, they became angry with Hermione as she made attempts to free them. Dobby and Winky, who were under Hogwarts' employ at the time, were considered disgraces to the rest of their colleagues due to Dobby being paid and receiving a vacation, while Winky constantly became drunk out of self-pity.[25]\n\nDuring the Battle of Hogwarts, the house-elves fought against the Death Eaters with Kreacher leading them. They defended their masters by using kitchen knives to stab at the attackers' ankles.[74]\n\nHogwarts had in its faculty an abundance of wise and talented professors. Each specialised in a specific subject.[92][98] Other staff positions included that of a school nurse, caretaker, librarian, and Keeper of the Keys and Grounds of Hogwarts. There were a variety of classes taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[92][98] These included both the core curriculum and the electives, available from third year forward. Some classes could be dropped in the sixth year.[98]\n\nNumerous lessons were described, instructing the students in various branches of magic. Transfiguration, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Potions, Astronomy, History of Magic, and Herbology were compulsory subjects for the first five years.[98][99][92] At the end of their second year, students were required to add at least two optional subjects to their syllabus for the start of the third year. Five of the choices were Arithmancy, Study of Ancient Runes, Divination, Care of Magical Creatures, and Muggle Studies.[100][101]\n\nIn addition, Horcruxes were a banned subject at Hogwarts, due to their extremely dark and inhumane nature.[102]\n\nHogwarts students received career advice from their Heads of House in their O.W.L. year, some weeks prior to the examinations, to help establish what subjects the students needed to concentrate on to achieve the required O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. scores for their chosen occupations.[73]\n\nIn fifth year, the students would get career advice, which would help students choose their N.E.W.T. subjects. Bill Weasley told his younger brother Ron about it. Before their examination (during the Easter break) the students would receive a batch of leaflets, advertising different jobs available to Hogwarts students and the N.E.W.T.s required for them. Examples were: Healing, Muggle relations, Wizard banking, Training Security trolls, and working at the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.[73]\n\nDuring the first week of summer term, the students discussed their future careers with the Head of Houses during a careers appointment. Harry Potter discussed his wish to become an Auror with McGonagall, who described it as a difficult career path to take. The requirements were high: five N.E.W.T.s. and passing of character and aptitude tests. Auror training then took another three years of study.[73]\n\nPercy Weasley was still reading about his future career possibilities after his careers advice. In Diagon Alley, he read about the later careers of Hogwarts prefects, just before he started his sixth year.[55]\n\nHarry first thought of his career after Hogwarts when he discussed it with Bartemius Crouch Junior (disguised as Alastor Moody) in his fourth year. Crouch suggested that he (and Hermione Granger) would be suitable to become Aurors.[25]\n\nOddly enough, the students of Hogwarts did not appear to receive similar counselling at the end of their second year, when they chose the elective subjects that could determine their future careers.\n\nGrading on routine homework seemed to be along the same lines as that for Muggle students. Hogwarts students also had more difficult exams as they progressed higher in the system. O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) were a set of standardised tests for fifth year students, which determined what courses a student could continue to study in their final years at Hogwarts. They were the wizarding equivalent of Muggle O-levels.[73]\n\nN.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests) were optional levels of education for exceptional students, much like A-levels for Muggle students. To progress to N.E.W.T.-level, students had to receive certain high marks on O.W.L. exams, otherwise the student would not be able to cope with the increasingly difficult subject matter. N.E.W.T. tests occurred at the end of the seventh year and could not be retaken.[73][56]\n\nThis grading system was also used on W.O.M.B.A.T.s (optional tests taken outside Hogwarts), and was most likely used on N.E.W.T.s also, making this the universal exam grading system in wizarding Britain.[73]\n\nAll students at Hogwarts were required to complete a set of examinations to get into the next year of schooling. There was one exam for each subject. In fifth year, instead of end of the year exams, students sat their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels); the score they achieved on these was what allowed them to progress to N.E.W.T.-level. In order to progress to N.E.W.T., a student had to score either an 'Outstanding' or an 'Exceeds Expectations' on their O.W.L.[73]\n\nThe Charms exam consisted of attributing animation to an otherwise inanimate object. In 1992, the students had to make a pineapple dance across Filius Flitwick's desk.[1]\n\nThe Transfiguration exam consisted of transfiguring a being into an object. In 1992, the students had to turn a mouse into a snuff box. Extra points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, while points were taken off if it still had whiskers.[1]\n\nThe Potions exam consisted of brewing a potion from memory. In 1992, and in keeping with Severus Snape's unpleasant sense of humour, the students had to produce a Forgetfulness Potion.[1]\n\nIn the 1992 History of Magic exam, the test lasted for one hour and the students were required to answer questions about the invention of the Self-Stirring Cauldron by Gaspard Shingleton.[1]\n\nThese exams were not set in place due to Dumbledore's decision to cancel them due to the events in the Chamber of Secrets that year.[55]\n\nThe Charms exam required students to perform the Cheering Charm, Freezing Spell,[126] and others. A separate room stood at the ready, if a student overdid their Cheering Charm.[72]\n\nThe Transfiguration exam was said to contain difficult tasks, as when finished students emerged \"limp and ashen-faced.\" The exam included turning a teapot into a tortoise. Some students' tortoises still had tails, could breathe steam, and had willow-patterned shells.[72]\n\nThe Potions exam was to brew a Confusing Concoction. Points were taken off if students could not get their batch to thicken, as was required.[72]\n\nThe History of Magic exam may have included questions on Witch Hunts, as students were required to complete homework on the subject.[72]\n\nThe Defence Against the Dark Arts exam consisted of an obstacle course. It contained dark creatures, which included wading across a deep paddling pool containing a Grindylow, a series of potholes full of Red Caps, squishing your way across a patch of marsh while ignoring the misleading directions of a Hinkypunk, then climbing into an old trunk in order to battle a Boggart.[72]\n\nThe Divination exam included looking into a crystal ball and being able to distinguish what could be seen. Both Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley chose to simply make something up. Harry's prediction, of a hippogriff flying away, turned out to be accurate. As nobody was mentioned as having failed the exam despite several students admitting they were just making things up, it is likely that anyone who at least pretended to see something would have been given a pass.[72]\n\nThe History of Magic exam involved testing the students on their knowledge of Goblin rebellions.[25]\n\nAn Ordinary Wizarding Level (often abbreviated O.W.L.) was a subject-specific test taken during Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry students' fifth year. These exams were administrated by the Wizarding Examinations Authority. The score made by a student on a particular O.W.L. determined whether or not he or she would be allowed to continue taking that subject in subsequent school years, and whether they might be successful in obtaining a particular job.[73]\n\nEach exam had a written and practical assessment, so students could demonstrate both their practical and theoretical knowledge. The exams were taken over a two week period.[73]\n\nA Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test (often abbreviated N.E.W.T.) was a subject-specific exam that seventh year witches and wizards at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry took to help them pursue certain careers after their graduation. For instance, the Ministry of Magic only accepted Auror applicants with at least five N.E.W.T.s with top grades of either 'Outstanding' or 'Exceeds Expectations'.[73]\n\nNot much was known about these exams. Some students did not take these exams at all, as some careers in the Wizarding World did not require N.E.W.T.s.\n\nA first-year was a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was new to Hogwarts and in their first year of magical education. First-years were typically eleven to twelve years of age. First-years arrived at the castle by crossing the lake with the Keeper of the Keys in boats separate from the older students. They were not allowed to own a broomstick or be on one unless they were attending Flying class. An exception had been made for Harry Potter because he joined the Gryffindor house team due to his exceptional skills with a broomstick.\n\nFirst-year classes consisted of: Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Astronomy, Charms, and Flying.[1]\n\nA second-year was a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was in their second year of magical education. Second-years were typically twelve to thirteen years of age unless a student had to repeat the second form. The second year was the first year in which students were allowed to go with the rest of the school in the school carriages pulled by Thestrals up to the castle.\n\nSecond-year classes consisted of: Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Astronomy, and Charms. Unlike first-years, second-years were not obligated to attend Flying classes, although they were allowed to bring their own broomsticks. At the end of the year, second-year students chose two or more classes they wished to study as electives the following year.[55]\n\nA third-year was a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was in their third year of magical education. Third-years were typically thirteen to fourteen years of age. Third-years were permitted to go to Hogsmeade during certain weekends if they had a signed permission form from their parent/guardian.[72]\n\nThe third year was an important one for students, as it was the first year that they were permitted to sit elective courses. Third-year classes consisted of: Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Astronomy, Charms, and the two or more electives the student chose the previous year.\n\nA fourth-year was a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was in their fourth year of magical education. Fourth-years were typically fourteen to fifteen years of age. The fourth form was almost identical in its structure to the third; students sat two or more elective courses in addition to the core classes, and were allowed into Hogsmeade during selected weekends.\n\nFourth-year classes consisted of: Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Astronomy, Charms, and two or more electives. However, fourth-years typically got more work than third-years, so as to prepare for their O.W.L.s.[25]\n\nA fifth-year was a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was in their fifth year of magical education. Fifth-years were typically fifteen to sixteen years of age. The fifth year was enormously important for students, due to the fact that it was the year in which they must sit their O.W.L. exams, which would determine what N.E.W.T. courses they would be permitted to take later on in their education. O.W.L.s determined what jobs they could apply for in their future careers.[73]\n\nThe fifth year was also the year in which students received career counselling from their Heads of House. It was during this meeting that they would be advised as to what N.E.W.T.-level classes they should take in order to qualify for their desired career. Fifth-year classes consisted of: Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Astronomy, Charms, and two or more electives. Before the beginning of the year, one boy and one girl were selected by the Headmaster from each house to become Prefects.[73]\n\nA sixth-year was a student who was in his or her sixth year of magical education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Sixth-years were typically sixteen to seventeen years of age, although some could be older, if they have had to repeat a year like Marcus Flint did. The sixth year was the first year in which students sat N.E.W.T.-level classes. Sixth-years could also elect to take part in Apparition lessons for a fee of twelve Galleons.[56]\n\nBased on students' O.W.L. scores, and depending on the minimum requirements of the professor teaching the subject at the time, students were allowed to sit any number of classes as long as they met said requirements. If the student didn't meet those requirements, they could not attend the N.E.W.T.-level classes, having to repeat the O.W.L.-level classes and the fifth-year exams. While students did have the opportunity to choose whether they wished to continue in particular subjects, those who began studying N.E.W.T.-level subjects in their sixth year were expected to carry on with the subject into the seventh year and sit the N.E.W.T. exam in that subject. Sixth-year students were initially excited to have more free time, but this extra time was intended to help them study and do homework, as many, if not all, teachers assigned more homework and gave more difficult lessons in their N.E.W.T.-level classes.[56]\n\nA seventh-year was a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who was in their seventh and final year of formal magical education. Seventh-years were typically seventeen to eighteen years of age, although some may be older if they have had to repeat a year. The seventh year contained the most important exams given at Hogwarts — the N.E.W.T.s.[56]\n\nStudents concluded their N.E.W.T.-level studies in the seventh year, at the end of which they sat the N.E.W.T. exam pertaining to each of their subjects. A student in the seventh year would have the same schedule they had in the sixth year, and would sit only those classes in which they received O.W.L.s meeting the minimum requirement of the professor for that subject. However, not all students would take N.E.W.T.s, as some occupations required only O.W.L.s.[56]\n\nEvery year, a male and female seventh-year were appointed Head Boy and Head Girl. In most cases, the Headmaster selected the Head students from the seventh-year Prefects. However, students that had never been Prefects, for example Harry's father James Potter, could still be selected.[1] The graduation would have the students ride the boats out from the boat dock under Hogwarts onto the black sea and land at Hogsmeade Station and ride the Hogwarts Express back to King's Cross Station.[127]\n\nThe day would begin at 7:30 a.m. with breakfast in the Great Hall. During breakfast, the mail arrived in a flurry of hundreds of owls. A bell chime signalled the start of the first class at 9 a.m. The bell chimed again in one hour to signal the start of the next class.[1]\n\nThere were two class periods before lunch, scheduled according to house, though N.E.W.T. students could have breaks during some of these. After lunch, there was another break and two more classes. If there was a heavy snowstorm in between periods, certain lessons that took place outside (such as Care of Magical Creatures) could be cancelled, since it would be difficult for students to traverse from the castle to the outside.[55]\n\nDinner was served in the Great Hall towards the evening, after which the students were expected to be in their house common rooms for studying and socialising.[1]\n\nThere were Astronomy classes at night on Wednesdays every week (usually midnight).[1]\n\nThe students had to be in bed or in the common rooms by a certain time, after which was called 'after hours'.[1] The times were different for different years (for example, fifth years were allowed to be in the halls until 9:00 p.m.)[25]\n\nAmongst the many towers of Hogwarts castle, there was a Small Locked Tower that housed the Quill of Acceptance and the Book of Admittance. These two artefacts constituted the only process by which students were selected for admission to Hogwarts. Whenever a magical child was born in Great Britain or Ireland, the Quill would detect it, float up out of its empty silver ink pot, and write their name in the Book. However, the Book monitored those same children and refused to allow the Quill to write their name until they displayed additional magical ability, since a Squib could initially have some residual magical aura from their wizard parent in infancy. The Quill's sensitivity, coupled with the Book's implacability, never made a mistake.\n\nThe Book and Quill's decision was final, and no child was admitted into first year whose name had not been inscribed on the Book's yellowing pages. However, there were various examples of transfer students who arrived from other wizarding schools in later years.\n\nIn all the centuries since the school was founded, until the 2008–2009 school year,[128] no student had ever visited the tower, and not since the Founders placed them there had the two artefacts been touched by human hands. Although, many Headermasters and Headmistresses have visited the tower over the years, where they hoped to see the Book and the Quill in action.\n\nEach year, the Hogwarts Deputy Headmaster sent letters to eligible witches and wizards who would be eleven years old at the start of the incoming term. These letters invited the children to be students at Hogwarts. If for any reason a letter did not reach its intended recipient, owls would continue delivering letters until the person received one (as was Harry Potter's experience when he turned eleven). The letter contained a list of needed supplies, signed by the Chief Attendant of Witchcraft Provisions, Lucinda Thomsonicle-Pocus, which included uniform clothing, spell books, and cauldrons. Letters were also sent to existing students to inform them of the new supplies needed. Students usually obtained school supplies at Diagon Alley in London.[1]\n\nLetters to Muggle-born witches and wizards, such as Hermione and Harry's mother Lily Evans, as well as Tom Marvolo Riddle (Voldemort) and Harry (half-bloods who lived with Muggles and knew nothing of the wizarding world), who may not have been aware of their powers and were unfamiliar with the concealed wizarding world, were delivered in person by a member of Hogwarts staff, who then explained to the parents/guardians about magical society, and reassured them regarding this news. They also assisted the family in regards to buying supplies and gaining access to Diagon Alley.[55]\n\nHarry's letter was sent via normal owl delivery, since Professor Dumbledore had presumed that the Dursleys had explained to Harry about Hogwarts and the wizarding world. When no response came from the first, several more letters, each reflecting Harry's new location, were sent. Ultimately, Hagrid was dispatched to hand-deliver Harry's final letter. Once he found Harry, who was with the Dursleys in their vain attempt to keep all wizarding knowledge from Harry, Hagrid explained all about Harry's parents and what had really happened the night they died.[1]\n\nWhile Remus Lupin's father was a wizard, Dumbledore personally visited the family to invite the boy to Hogwarts given the fact that Remus had been afflicted by lycanthropy. Remus noted that it was only after Dumbledore became headmaster that he could have been accepted at Hogwarts.[91]\n\nStudents were allowed to bring a cat, an owl or a toad,[1] but exceptions such as rats and Pygmy Puffs were made. Moreover, students did not have to pay tuition fee, because the British Ministry of Magic covered the cost of all students' magical education.[56][129]\n\nWhile most wizards and witches in Great Britain and Ireland were educated in Hogwarts, they were not obligated to attend if they did not wish to, as some parents were noted to have home-educated their children (as Lyall Lupin originally intended to do for his son due to his condition) or send them abroad (as Lucius originally intended for his son Draco to Durmstrang Institute). This was temporarily changed in the 1997–1998 school year, in which the new Voldemort-installed regime mandated all eligible children to attend in order to weed out Muggle-borns from the school.[74]\n\nTryouts for House Quidditch teams happened at the very beginning of the school year. The Heads of house had a list of applicants, which they would pass on to the team captain, so the captain could schedule tryouts at their leisure. First years were usually prohibited from joining a Quidditch team, because they were usually inexperienced with brooms and were forbidden to own them in the first place.[1]\n\nHowever, exceptions had been made on both counts. Harry Potter was a noticeable exception, he was allowed to join the team in his first year and was the youngest Seeker in a century. Teams had different reputations; before Harry joined in 1991, the Gryffindor team was noted by McGonagall to be on a losing streak and that she could not bear any more of Severus Snape's boasting.[1]\n\nThe Slytherin team was considered to have no qualms with cheating and unsportsmanlike conduct. It was noted that the Slytherin team recruited players of brute strength, rather than skill.[1][55][72][73][56]\n\nStudents could go home for certain holidays such as Christmas and Easter. The students who chose to remain were treated to a feast along with some of the faculty.[1]\n\nWhen Christmas holidays ended, classes would begin again. In Harry Potter's second year, Gilderoy Lockhart organised a Valentine's Day celebration which was not continued after he left the school.[55]\n\nThe Easter holidays were not as enjoyable as the Christmas ones, as students were overloaded with homework in preparation for their exams, which were taken at the end of the year. Students were not allowed to use magic over the summer holidays until they turned seventeen; magic was also banned in corridors.[1]\n\nThe students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry were required to wear a uniform. The uniform consisted of a black robe and a black pointed hat (for daywear). Students wore their own socks and shoes. Students had to wear their uniforms during all lessons, and while eating meals or studying in the Great Hall. Students were allowed to wear their own clothes after lessons in their House dormitory and during the holidays.\n\nMost students were seen still wearing their uniforms in their house dormitory, most probably because they would need to change into their pyjamas to sleep before they go to bed, so they may feel that it is troublesome to change into their own clothes, then change again into their pyjamas.[1]\n\nJ. K. Rowling speculated that she might have subconsciously produced the name Hogwarts from the Hogwort plant she saw when walking round Kew Gardens.[130]\nIn the film Labyrinth, Sarah, acted by Jennifer Connelly, meets a goblin outside the gates of the Labyrinth who introduces himself as Hoggle. As they depart, she calls him \"Hogwart\" instead of his proper name, Hoggle. Also in the film Labyrinth, Jareth the Goblin King, acted by David Bowie, often calls his goblins by the wrong names and at one point he incorrectly calls Hoggle \"Hogwart.\" It is, of course, possible that the name may have derived from the word \"Warthog\", but simply reversed.",
