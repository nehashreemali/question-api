  "content": "St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries was a wizarding hospital located in London, England.[1] It was founded by famous Healer Mungo Bonham in the 1600s.[4] The emblem of St Mungo's was a wand crossed with a bone.[1]\n\nIt appeared that the hospital served the entire wizarding population of Great Britain. Muggles were also admitted when they fell prey to magical attacks and ailments, such as two Muggles who lost their fingers to Willy Widdershins's biting doorknobs and had to have their bones regrown and memories modified,[1] or Herbert Chorley who had his mind addled from a poorly performed Imperius Curse and had to remain in the hospital to recuperate as well as to prevent him from posing a danger to anyone.[3]\n\nResidents of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who were injured at school were usually treated in the Hospital Wing by the school matron, such as Noreen Blainey or Poppy Pomfrey. However, some cases were serious enough that the individual had to be sent to St Mungo's Hospital for more advanced treatment.[5]\n\nSeventh-year students at Hogwarts were also taught about the founding of St Mungo's Hospital in History of Magic by Professor Cuthbert Binns during the 1990–1991 school year.[6] In 1991, St Mungo's Werewolf Wing was reported by Daily Prophet to be closed.[7]\n\nIn the early 2010s, a mix up at a Quidditch exhibition in River Piddle caused dozens of players to suffer broken bones. They were taken to St Mungo's where their injuries required treatment with Skele-Gro. The hospital ran out of the potion and urgently needed fresh new fangs from fully grown Fanged Geraniums to quickly produce more Skele-Gro. They put out an advert asking witches and wizards to sell them their own harvested fangs in return for good money, so that they could save the trouble of charming orders of Fanged Geraniums into shape upon their arrival at the hospital.[8]\n\nTo enter the premises, one might step through the window of what appeared to be a red-bricked, condemned department store called Purge and Dowse, Ltd. This acted as a magical gateway to the main building, much like the barrier at King's Cross Station to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. Although the \"department store\" building housing the hospital might have been relatively small, this was not an indication of the true capacity of a magical building, the interior looked exactly as a hospital should. One way an individual could enter the building was speaking to an apparently inanimate dummy in the department store.[1]\n\nThe hospital was located where it was because no one could find a better place to house it. Everywhere in Diagon Alley was too small, so people came up with ideas to build it underground like the Ministry of Magic, but it was decided that underground was too unhealthy. Eventually, a normal Muggle building was purchased so that patients could come and go and fit in with the crowds.[1]\n\nThere was a strict guidelines of gifts that were allowed into the hospital, for the safety of the patients. As such, each and every one would be searched and inspected thoroughly and would be determined whether it was safe to be given. This is shown when Miriam Strout neglected the rule and allowed the Death Eaters sneak in a cutting of Devil's Snare, which Madam Strout mistook for Flitterbloom, into the ward, thus resulting in the death of Broderick Bode. Strout was suspended on pay as a result.[2][9]\n\nAnimals were also not allowed inside the hospital. However in the 1990–1991 school year, Jacob's sibling and their friends snuck Fang, Rubeus Hagrid's dog, into the hospital so he could visit Hagrid under the guise he was a transfigured wizard.[10]\n\nThe ground floor was reception and Artefact Accidents.\n\nInside, in a reception area filled with rickety wooden chairs and outdated issues of magazines, visitors were greeted by the Welcome Witch, though her demeanour (at least on busy days) was less than welcoming. This reception area seemed to double as a visitors' entrance and an emergency room waiting area. It was often filled with wizards facing strange ailments, such as hands sprouting out of their chests or steam pouring from their mouths, and Healers clad in uniform lime green robes hurry busily through the room.[1]\n\nThe St Mungo's Admissions Department was possibly located on this floor. The admissions department recorded the patients who had given entry on the Hospital and their respective injuries or illnesses. It was also presumably where specialist Healers from various medical departments went to look for new cases when their more 'every-day' duties was done.[11]\n\nThe receptionist helped anyone who was unsure where to go, incapable of normal speech, or unable to remember why they were at the Hospital.[1]\n\nArtefact Accidents dealt with injuries caused by magical objects, such as cauldron explosions, wands backfiring, broom crashes, and so forth.[1] Katie Bell would have likely been a patient on this floor when she was admitted to St Mungo's after touching a cursed necklace she was carrying.[5]\n\nThe Alchemy Room was a room in which healing potions were brewed by Healers, along with the study of alchemy to develop cures.[12]\n\nThe first floor was treatment for creature-induced injuries.\n\nAfter suffering a highly venomous snake bite in December 1995,[13] Arthur Weasley stayed in the 'Dangerous' Dai Llewellyn Ward: Serious Bites. This ward was small and dingy and had only one window, which lay opposite the door. It was mainly illuminated by shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling.[1]\n\nThe ward was named after Dai Llewellyn, an extremely famous Quidditch player who was eaten by a Chimaera.[14] It is unknown whether this incident was the one that led the ward to be named for him, or whether there might be some other reason.\n\nThe staff in the 'Dangerous' Dai Llewellyn ward included Hippocrates Smethwyck (Healer-in-Charge) and Augustus Pye (Trainee Healer).[1] Pye was interested in complementary medicine and attempted to help Arthur by using stitches on his wounds, though of course they failed to work, given the potency of the poison.[2] There were two other patients in the ward during this visit; one was a wizard who had been bitten by a werewolf (who Lupin talked to during the Christmas visit), and the other was a witch who wouldn't reveal what she was handling when she sustained her injuries.[1][2]\n\nThe second floor housed the \"Magical Bugs\" ward, which was dedicated to the treatment of magical ailments and diseases. It addressed contagious maladies such as Vanishing sickness and Scrofungulus.[1]\n\nIn the 16th or 17th century, Gunhilda of Gorsemoor developed a cure for Dragon Pox,[15] but the disease had not been completely eradicated. It was still treated by the Magical Bugs ward at St Mungo's.[1]\n\nThe third floor was treatment for potions and plant poisoning. It addressed rashes, regurgitation, uncontrollable giggling, and more.[1] This floor likely contained the Poisoning Department.[16]\n\nWhile visiting Xenophilius Lovegood on 30 December 1997 and being offered Freshwater Plimpy soup, Ronald Weasley retorted under his breath that people probably requested the recipe to show this department.[16]\n\nThe fourth floor housed the Janus Thickey Ward, which was for treatment of spell damage. It addressed unliftable jinxes, hexes, curses, incorrectly-applied charms, etc.[2]\n\nHerbert Chorley, Muggle Junior Minister, was admitted to the hospital, afflicted with a badly-performed Imperius Curse in 1996. The curse caused him to impersonate a duck. While being treated at the hospital, he tried to strangle some Healers.[3]\n\nProfessor Minerva McGonagall was admitted to this floor after receiving four Stunning Spells to the chest at the hands of Dolores Umbridge and several corrupt Aurors.[17] Nymphadora Tonks was a patient here after her duel with Bellatrix Lestrange in 1996, during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.[18] During the time of Arthur Weasley's stay, another patient had shoes that his brother had jinxed to bite his feet.[1]\n\nHarry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Ginny Weasley inadvertently visited this floor on Christmas day, 1995. While there they encountered Gilderoy Lockhart on the stairs and accompanied him to the Janus Thickey Ward (a.k.a. ward 49), where he was staying. Other residents of this ward included Broderick Bode and a witch named Agnes, as well as Frank and Alice Longbottom. During their visit, they ran into Neville and his grandmother and learned for the first time what had happened to them (and in Harry's case, got a first glimpse of the permanent result of their attack).[2] Madam Strout, a motherly-looking Healer, cared for the patients in the long-term ward whose brains had been permanently affected by magic.\n\nThe fifth floor was the visitors' tearoom and hospital shop, a place for visitors to relax and purchase gifts for patients.[1]\n\nMedics employed at the hospital were known as Healers and were well versed in Healing magic. Their uniform robes were lime green, and they all wore a badge known as the St Mungo's Certified Healer Insignia.[19]\n\nDilys Derwent was a St Mungo's Healer from 1722 to 1741. Afterwards, she became Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1741 to 1768.[1] Another Healer at St Mungo's was a man named Lancelot.[20]\n\nRequirements to become a Healer included taking Transfiguration, Potions, Charms, Herbology, and Defence Against the Dark Arts at the N.E.W.T.-level and earning at least 'Exceeds Expectations' on the N.E.W.T. exams for each of those subjects.[21] St Mungo's also operated a work experience programme for seventh-year students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who wished to become Healers after graduation.[12][10]\n\nEach ward of the hospital had \"Healer-in-Charge\"; such as Miriam Strout in the Janus Thickey Ward, or Hippocrates Smethwyck of the Dai Llewellyn ward. It is unknown if there was a Head Healer in charge of the whole hospital.\n\nMungo Bonham could have been named after Saint Mungo, aka Saint Kentigern, the patron saint of Glasgow.[42] His pregnant mother was abandoned by her family before his birth. He is considered the first bishop of Scotland. \"Mungo\" was also a nickname meaning \"dear one\" or \"darling\".",
