  "content": "On the ground to third floors, the tower contained various passages to other parts of the castle. On the fourth floor, it accommodated a spacious hallway that connected to the Magical Theory classroom and a bathroom. The classroom was adjacent to the Magical Theory professor's office. The fifth floor contained a corridor and a reading room, as well as the Astronomy professor's living quarters.[2] Further up were the Astronomy Room and the battlements of the tower.[3][4]\n\nDuring the 1890–1891 school year, one of the most advanced astronomy telescopes available to wizardkind was placed in this tower for the students and staff to use. During the same school year, the Bloody Baron would often linger in the tower's staircase, staring wistfully at the stairwell's Enchanted Ceiling which depicted the night sky.[2]\n\nDuring the 1991–1992 school year, Harry Potter's first year, he and Hermione Granger sneaked under his Cloak of Invisibility to the top of the Astronomy Tower to send Rubeus Hagrid's pet dragon, Norbert, to Charlie Weasley in Romania. Although they succeeded in sending Norbert away, they were caught by Argus Filch on their way down the tower, as they had forgotten to bring the Cloak of Invisibility with them.[5] Professor McGonagall also caught Neville Longbottom and took away 150 points from Gryffindor.[6]\n\nAfter Sirius Black tried to break in to the Gryffindor Tower on the evening of 31 October, 1993, all the staff was to search the Castle for any signs of Black. Argus Filch searched the Astronomy Tower and found nothing.[7]\n\nThe Astronomy practical exam took place here for the O.W.L.s. Under the supervision of Professor Tofty, students were required to fill out a star chart. However, Dolores Umbridge, John Dawlish, and several other Ministry of Magic officials attacked Hagrid during this practical, and the resulting skirmish caused several Aurors and Professor McGonagall to be severely injured, incapacitated Fang, and forced Hagrid to flee the school. All of this was witnessed by the fifth-years taking their O.W.L.s and Professor Tofty from the tower.[8]\n\nAfter the Death Eaters successfully infiltrated Hogwarts in June 1997, the Battle of the Astronomy Tower broke out in the tower and the corridor below. The Death Eaters set off the Dark Mark above the tower, and Albus Dumbledore was blasted from the ramparts by a Killing Curse cast by Severus Snape.[9] This was where Dumbledore met his death,[9] though at the time only he and Snape knew it was carried out on his own orders.[10]\n\nThe tower was the tallest in Hogwarts and was positioned almost directly above the front doors of the castle. The tower was also surrounded by a parapet and was tall enough to have a perfect view of the starry sky.[1]",
