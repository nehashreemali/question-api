  "content": "Nurmengard Castle was located somewhere in the Austrian Alps, and functioned as a wizarding prison. Originally built by Gellert Grindelwald to hold his opponents, it also served as the base of operations for Grindelwald and his followers. Ultimately, it was used to imprison Grindelwald himself after his defeat by Albus Dumbledore in 1945, until his death in 1998.\n\nThe prison was built on the orders of the Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald in order to hold his opponents.[2] Grindelwald's slogan \"For the Greater Good\" was carved over the prison's entrance.[3]\n\nBy 1926, the castle also served as the headquarters for Grindelwald and his Alliance during the Global Wizarding War.\n\nLater in 1927, Gellert gave Aurelius Dumbledore a spare wand and bestowed him alleged information about who he might be and what Albus Dumbledore is up to.\n\nIn 1932, Aurelius and the other acolytes brought to Nurmengard a Qilin kidnapped from China. Soon, the election for the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards there were to be held, which Grindelwald wanted to win. When the Qilin did not bow to him, Grindelwald cut its throat with a knife, and moments later in the creature's blood he saw visions of Albus Dumbledore with the blood pact pendant and Newt and Theseus Scamander heading to Hogsmeade.\n\nLater, Grindelwald had visions of Yusuf Kama heading to Nurmengard and Dumbledore in the Hog's Head Inn. When Vinda Rosier appeared, Grindelwald told her that they should prepare to leave the castle the next night, because they would have a visitor in the morning. As Aurelius's phoenix flew over him, Rosier asked Grindelwald if Aurelius could really kill Dumbledore. Grindelwald stated that the phoenix was supposed to protect Aurelius in connection with his assigned task, and Aurelius's pain was the only way he could defeat Dumbledore.\n\nSoon Grindelwald was visited by Yusuf, who told him that he was sent by Dumbledore to spy on him, and asked Grindelwald what report he was to pass on to Albus of this visit. Grindelwald ordered Queenie Goldstein to use Legilimency on Kama. Queenie read that Kama was furious at Grindelwald, after the Dark wizard killed Leta Lestrange, his sister. Grindelwald erased with the Elder Wand the painful memory of his sister's death, altering his memories.\n\nSoon after, a gathering of Grindelwald's followers took place in Nurmengard, where the Dark wizard gave his speech. After that, he reanimated the dead Qilin in the underground pools in order to use it during the election for Supreme Mugwump. In the water Grindelwald had a vision of the second Qilin and became enraged at Aurelius, ordering him to find the second Qilin.\n\nAfter a number of years of terrorising Europe, Grindelwald was confronted and defeated in a duel between him and his former best friend and lover Albus Dumbledore on the dawn of 2 November 1945.[4]\n\nGrindelwald was imprisoned in the top-most cell[5] in the highest tower[6] inside Nurmengard after his defeat by Dumbledore.[4] His cell had a small window, too narrow for a man to leave or enter,[7] a hard bed,[8] and a thin blanket.[9][10]\n\nIt is unknown if there were any other prisoners ever held at Nurmengard, but around the time of Grindelwald's death, it is likely that he was the only prisoner present as the past inmates were likely incarcerated there at Grindelwald's behest. Grindelwald was certainly fed and kept alive for fifty-three years, so there was at least a supply of food and someone (or something) bringing it to him, although he was emaciated, frail and missing teeth.[10]\n\nIn his quest for the Elder Wand, Lord Voldemort travelled to Nurmengard in 1998, using his skills of unsupported flight to break into Grindelwald's cell.[11][12] After confronting him for information on the Elder Wand's location, Voldemort killed Grindelwald[8] and then flew away.\n\nNurmengard was a stone fortress at the edge of a mountain. It had a tower with a cone-shaped top, possibly being a watch-tower. There was a building connected to the tower, that was slim with windows. Nurmengard also had a courtyard, which was gated. Whenever there was an outsider, one or more of Grindelwald's acolytes would interrogate them, while wanded.\n\nOn either side of the courtyard were prisons with black-coloured bars, very probably enchanted by Grindelwald to hold less powerful enemies, while the other ones were held captive further inside, in the castle's interior. On top of these prisons were houses. On the mountainside, at the back of Nurmengard Castle, were a series of steps that led to a hill, where Aurelius Dumbledore would wait for his phoenix to arrive.[13]\n\nHalf a decade later, Nurmengard turned into a gigantic, towering building made of black rock[7] and with high walls, that is described as \"jet-black\", \"forbidding\", and a \"grim fortress\".[14][15]\n\nInside the main building, there was a hallway with velvet carpet detailed with white lines and also a table.[13]\n\nThere was a room, possibly located underground within the castle, that contained two pools of water and only had stairs leading upward. The walls of the room were inscribed with rune symbols, including a stylised number three. Several candelabras were present—some standing on the ground, while others hung from chains attached to the ceiling.\n\nAurelius Dumbledore had a room, where he used a sink to wash his hands while talking to Queenie Goldstein. Above the sink, there were was a mirror that Aurelius used to send messages to Aberforth's mirror in Hog's Head Inn. Aurelius's use of the mirror was unknown to Grindelwald and the rest of the Alliance.\n\nConnected to the hallway was a room with large wooden doors. Inside the room held tables, chairs, a desk, cabinets with books, a gold chandelier, a stove and more things. The walls were coloured red and yellow with a pattern. They also had six different heraldic symbols on the walls. At the end of the room was a big window, with a staircase going down into a lower part with a table, chair and a table. Up the staircase, was a narrow staircase, leading into the tower.[13]",
